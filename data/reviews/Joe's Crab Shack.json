{"text":"I love the service at this place, and of course the food. They always try so hard to make you happy, it's pretty impressive. One thing, I wish they had more appetizers on their menu. Ordered Joe's Classic Steampot last time, was not disappointed."}
{"text":"I just fell in love with this place. I had never been before and the hubby suggested we try. It was awesome. Morgan the waitress was great!  Thanks for a wonderful meal."}
{"text":"Food was good service was slow I don't know why there was only 5 tables being served."}
{"text":"It was alright, but for the amount they give you it is really too pricey.  Was expecting more for my buck... I was expecting a lot more then what I hot... really disappointed. Customer service was good, but didn't cover the fact that I was still hungry after ordering what was supposed to be a pot of crab, when they stuffed it with crap, to make it look like a lot. Never going again."}
{"text":"I really love this place and drive from surprise az to eat here.... Really disappointed that they change the menu since 2 weeks ago i was here.. Losing like 26 items or so i guess. New menu is tough to understand as easy either .. Hope they change back ...."}
{"text":"15 years ago I vowed I would never go back to this restaurant. So last night I was feeling adventurous. Well to my demise I should have chosen a different restaurant. The service was as slow as ever. Our appetizer order was never submitted. We had to ask another waiter for utensils. When we asked the person who brought our food about our appetizer, the manager brought us the cold shrimp, when we had ordered the steamed shrimp. The dinner was lack luster. I ordered the king crab 32$ for 4 mediocre crab legs. Over priced, slow, horrible service. Derek was our waiter. I am sorry it may be another 15 years before I go back."}
{"text":"9/18/2013 Had dinner at Joe's Crab Shack, 5:00 PM. Ordered shrimp bucket COLD, got hot. Ordered Salad with BALSAMIC  VINEGARETTE , Got THOUSAND ISLAND. ORDERED Fish and Shrimp, got nasty old fish.  Ordered Dungeness Crab, must have been shipped at least a month ago. Manager came to table holding her stomach like she had some real pain.  Did the typical,  will make it right, but to late. This was the worst $70.00 dollars I spent in a long time."}
{"text":"A bit ignored tonight. Our server had a big party next to us and i felt sorry for them. She just dissapeared and since we came later we ended up stuck behind that mess too. No refills, one quick trip back to check on us, no offer of dessert or coffee. Just not a great or big plate of food for the price."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Joe's for the very first time for our anniversary tonight. It was filled about halfway and we were seated really quickly. Our server Ryan was really on it. Unfortunately he was also the bartender so we had to get his attention every time we needed anything. We ordered the Arbor Bay pot. Our food came pretty quickly. My husband and I were pretty excited until we started eating. Our food was really rubbery. Our lobster was so chewy I couldn't finish even half of it. I also was pretty disgusted that we had to devein all of the seafood ourselves which we only discovered after eating the first shrimp.  Overall I only gave it a two because our server was great. It he wasn't it would have been a one."}
{"text":"Worst food, dont go to this place, we ordered steampot and everything was soaked in salt water. Flavor was not good, I dont even know if it has a flavor lol. Seafood was not fresh, and they're small in size. I do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"I love crab, I've always near the ocean so when I came to Arizona and wanted crab..well we had this. I didn't like it that much, it was expensive and felt like a snack. I got the 2 for $40, and it wasn't enough. I've tried their apple crumble like thing with cinnamon ice cream, it was very sugary. I couldn't taste my sprite."}
{"text":"Utter disappointment. Stopped in for lunch on Sunday since we hadn't been here for awhile. Although our waiter was Mr. Personality at first, his lack of attention to our needs and satisfaction far outweighed his persona. We ordered an appetizer first, which was \"ok\". 2 iced teas, which I'm guessing refills are not an option; then entrees arrived. I ordered the East Coast platter. The crab cake was literally burnt and turned over on the plate to hide it. I took one bite and that was it. The shrimp were burned on the outside, and the fish tasted like the grease hadn't been changed in weeks. We didn't see our waiter again until it was time for the check. He didn't even ask how the meal was but clearly had to notice I hadn't hardly touched my plate. I had to share my Husbands meal. For a $50 lunch we certainly left there feeling pissed."}
{"text":"I went here a while ago with my cousin for lunch, hoping to get some fresh seafood and delicious entrees. Unfortunately, the service was beyond terrible and the food was no better. Our waitress continuously passed by and never checked up on us and continued to chit chat with fellow co-workers. In addition, the chicken dish I ordered was dry and expensive for such a small portion. While I was there, another customer also complained to the staff that her service was terrible and her food was cold. She asked for the manager and they promptly told her that he was not available. After the woman left, the waiter she was talking to rolled his eyes and started talking crap about the lady not two minutes after she walked out. As the staff continued to gossip and talk crap, my cousin and I were still being ignored and thus we walked out. This was also the first time I had ever been to a Joe's and it will be my last."}
{"text":"I got a Samuel Adams steampot. The crab was bland and half of the clams were just shells. The seafood buffet I go to has better crab legs and it's cheaper and you can get as many as you want. If you are going there for good food you might as well forget it it's more of an \"experience\" restaurant."}
{"text":"I love coming here! Great food and the service is always perfect!!!! Fun times!"}
{"text":"It's been a long time since I've been here. My wife and kids decided to treat me out for dinner. I'm going to start off with the \"Great Balls of Fire\" for my appetizer and the \"Ragin' Cajun\" Steampot for my main course. Our waitress/server is top notch!"}
{"text":"It was good. The service was nice. Our waiting staff was attentive even though the place was really busy. The crab nachos were out of this world. I would go definitely go back. No problems at all. Slightly over priced but I was actually surprised at how much food we actually got."}
{"text":"The is one of the best seafood restaurants I have been to in a real long time. The staff was very friendly and very helpful. I'm a critic and I have high expectations of restaurants in terms of food quality, efficiency, and service, and I am giving Joe's Crab Shack a 5 star rating. Not only was my waitress very kind and helpful but she worked well with the rest of team. Normally at restaurants you will see one waitress attending to your table and other waitresses pass by without a word or smile, but here, everyone works as one team. Waiters, kitchen staff, and waitresses worked like one machine with a human element. Wish other restaurants had this type of service. Great job Joe's Crab Shack!! I will be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"It is a good place to pig out crabs and seafood. Beer with crabs are the perfect match."}
{"text":"I love Joe's Crab Shack (I've been to a few others in different cities), but this one in Station Square is the coolest.  Right by the river.  Station Square is a great place to take some pics while you're in Pitt.  :)"}
{"text":"The food sucked. We left extremely unsatisfied, especially considering that we were super hungry coming in (it wouldn't have taken much to please us). Paid $55 for a meal we didn't finish. Did I mention I was super starving?  Ordered the garlicky butter bake because my boyfriend loves garlic. Turned out to be a disaster. The dish came out much smaller than expected (unlike the picture shown).  The lobster wasn't cleaned, had no flavor, and the meat was way too soft and fell apart. The one small cluster of snow crab legs we got was missing a leg. The corn was bland. The mussels weren't good, either. The garlic flavor leaned towards bitterness... The garlic bread was okay though.   Also got the skillet paella. It mostly tasted like tomatoes, even with the seafood in it. The worst part was broken pieces of mussel shells were scattered throughout. Unappealing and unappetizing. Like the garlicky butter bake, the best part of the dish was the two pieces of garlic bread (which wasn't even that great).  We were actually here sometime last year and the food wasn't so bad then. I don't know if they changed chefs or what, but it's safe to say that we definitely won't be returning here anytime soon.   I'm only giving two stars because service was pretty decent -even though they didn't ask us how our food was. I guess they already knew the answer."}
{"text":"We arrived at Joe's around 7:30pm on a Sunday night and the place was surprisingly half empty.  By the time we finished eating, the place was pretty much empty.  We were worried that this meant the food wouldn't be fresh.  We found out that the $5 appetizers had just ended the day before.  No worries because we were really here for the crab.  It's just that the TV commercials advertising the $5 appetizers were stuck in my head.  I went with the Joe's Classic Steampot with no extra seasoning.  This included Dungeness Crab, Snow Crab, Shrimp, Potatoes, Sausage and Corn.  I subbed in French Fries for the sausage and potatoes.  I got one cluster of each crab which were of a decent size.  The crab meat was fresh and didn't taste salty like some places that don't rinse the legs.  The food was very filling.  Our party enjoyed our time here.  Next time I will get either just Dungeness Crab or the Crab Daddy Feast which includes King Crab."}
{"text":"I went in with my two friends and their twin babies.  You know what that means, right?!  We were a high needs table, but the crew at Joe's didn't hesitate to make sure all our needs were met-from beginning to end!  Before my pals arrived I had sat at the bar and ordered a Strawberry Peach Sangria.  That cocktail is super good without being overwhelmingly sweet!  Very well done!  Both bartenders, Joe and another gal, worked as a team to make sure all bar sitters were taken care of.  They were uber-friendly, too, which is unusual and really awesome for bartender service.  You know how usually they are faaarrrr too busy to engage for more than your order?  Nope, not here.  Management has an eye for good people.  Once we were all seated with the babies in tow, we had a super cool server (Cherise?  She was short and spunky with glamorous artsy tats) that made sure we had everything we needed.  She made some good suggestions---I ended up getting the crab appetizer and the shrimp caesar salad.  They were both really good, but you MUST eat the appetizer slowly unless you want to tear up the roof of your mouth.  (Why, oh, why must some of the tastiest foods do this?  Captain Crunch Berries...THOSE BASTARDS!)  I'd also opt for dressing on the side next time, but all in all, these were great choices.  The service environment is superb here, lots of lively young folks that seem genuinely nice.  Pair that with tasty seafood and you've got a winner!"}
{"text":"First time visit on Sunday. Quickly seated, drink order taken right away - food was really good.   We tried their clam strip appetizer and the nachos - both excellent.  The shrimp was great - we had a nice casual meal ,the staff didnt rush you or push you , was friendly and personable. We will definitely be back ! thanks!"}
{"text":"I had been craving seafood so bad and after not being able to go to California, we went to joes crab shack. that was a very wise decision. Food is very tasty and generously seasoned. We got one of their steam pots and dessert. Very yummy."}
{"text":"We went about 130pm yesterday,  monday june 19 .. only 1 other small table in the place..i ordered dungeoness crab..1st they forgot to put the seasoning on it that the waitress recommended.. so she took them back and brought back a salty Mess poured on them..she had reassured me when she recommended that it wouldnt be salty, . I tried to crack one and it was like crab jerky so it had to go back, I just requested to get snow crab with just garlic instead.. it was like a waterlogged mess. shells were \"bendy\", and half of the meat was missing in the first one i tried, so it went back..  , .. I ordered a crab cake sandwich and it was like goop on a hard dry  bun..so i settled for not eating while the rest of my family ate.. two of our party had fish and chips and the fish was greasy, one has the mahi fish tacos and ate half of one taco and left the other one and a half because it tasted bland.. 3 had steamer pots, waterlogged crab legs,  undercooked potatoes and corn.. and then gratuity was added to each of our bills and I was charged 35% .. which had to be removed by the manager... this is by far the worst food in Vegas I've ever tasted...ive lived here 4 years and eat out different places at least 2x a week, .....WORST"}
{"text":"This is my first time at Joe's and I went with people who have been to several in the tri-state area. I was excited to see the dancing and experience what Joes is supposed to offer. I didn't see any dancing at all, Lisa our server was not polite or personable, the food for our party of seven had to be sent back because it was cold or overly salted. The one year old boy was considered a diner so that our tickets would reflect an eight person table. (A party of eight is an automatic 18% gratuity). We had four tickets within our table.   While we were sitting we saw almost every person's food get sent back. We saw many dishes prepared in the kitchen then sit at the end of the line for a server to take it to the front of the house. We saw one diner tell Paul Luedtke, the general manager, that he didn't want to wait for another plate to be prepared, he was told his food would come right back. It did not. Also, we heard Paul tell a table that their discount went on another tables bill.   When Paul approached us to check in, he told us that there was a new system in the restaurant and that the restaurant was hectic. The restaurant was not at capacity, not even half. Not long after Paul left, Lisa told us the real story was that the lock on the freezer door was broken and that the door was left open freezing everything.   I would not recommend anyone eating at this location. To say that I was disappointed would be an understatement. The only sort of saving grace was that we all got a 50% employee discount. (With the 18% gratuity added to it)"}
{"text":"Host staff was fine. Got seated sooner than expected. Once seated, it took a while to get anyone to acknowledge our presence. And by a while I mean about 10 minutes.  After finally having our server come over, she seemed to try to provide good service and was prompt in getting our drinks. But she seemed overall overwhelmed. The food coming out was slow. And we even had to ASK for silverware.  The food? Mahi was dry. Crab cakes were mushy. First order of coconut shrimp was raw. Second order, after being assured that it was cooked was also raw. Tip: Shrimp should not be slimy, shiny or rubbery. Even shrimp in sushi is never that raw. At least they took it off the bill.     I made a mental note to never come here again. And went home sad, frustrated and wondering what I will be eating in about an hour."}
{"text":"Seriously the worst service I've had at a restaurant in a long time. It wasn't very crowded, so there wasn't really a reason some of the food should have come out before the drinks.  I've been a server and I know very well how hard it can be, but instead of walking be and looking at out empty glasses and not saying anything,  it's simple to acknowledge that you see the empty glasses, and let us know that you will come back and refill the drinks.  The food wasn't terrible though."}
{"text":"What can I say, I have enjoyed other Joe's; BUT the wait staff seemed to feel is was more important to place the chairs on the table next to us and clean them as we ate. not the first time they have done this.....not the entertainment Joe's is known for"}
{"text":"One star is for great service...but  The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result.  The definition of dining insanity is going to the same restaurant after you swore you would never go there again and expecting the food to be good!  On TV I saw... \"Fried Lobster Bites\" which are two things I love: lobster and a light crispy breading (or so the picture on the TV represented them as \"lightly coated nuggets of wonder\").   Shame on me... what I got were overcooked erasers with a breading that was so thick it could have doubled as arctic parkas for tiny Eskimos.  The sauce had broken down, the corn on the cobb was dry, and gritts like paste.   I will now stop the insanity."}
{"text":"Stop by here after a day of wedding stuff and an evening of walking around Mt. Washington. It was surprisingly empty and thus very relaxing. Plenty of arm room and I could have a normal conversation. Now onto the food.   I'm not  big fan of Joe's. Back in Akron where I first had Joe's, I was so turned off I dubbed it \"Joe's Crap Shack\". Now it's gotten better since, but the seafood is still kind of average for me. I ordered some coconut shrimp, and it just didn't do anything for me. Other than this, the service and atmosphere were pretty good."}
{"text":"I continue to break my own rule of not going to chain restaurants when I come to Vegas by visiting the Joe's Crab Shack off 95.  Why?  The atmosphere.  The food is not great but how badly can you screw up a steamer pot?  The staff and atmosphere are great.  Music blasting...and everyone, even the staff having a good time.  I am taking the red eye home to VA tonight and off all my choices I chose to come here and was not disapoointed."}
{"text":"Communication and teamwork are some of the key elements in great customer satisfaction, especially working in a resteraunt atmoshpere. On Valentine's day I can understand how things can get sticky, granted I probly wasn't customer of the month. I did change the reservation time twice because my boyfriend had to work overtime, and we were still planning on visiting the chocolate factory all in the same night. So we ended up getting there 45 minutes early which worked out because my 3 children were able to play in the sandbox and slide area. However after checking in with the girl hostess she did not make it clear to the other hostess that we were waiting. So there were no amendments with the time. We waited 45 minutes to be seated, but an appetizer was thrown in for free to make up for the discrepancy. On another note Joe's crabshack was redeemed by server Brady who was pleaseant, prompt, accommodating and full of energy. He made the rest of the evening enjoyable. Brady kept a million dollar smile on his face the entire time. He made the experience fun and memorable for our kids. My daughter is normally very withdrawn but ended up giving him a high 5 at the end of the night anyway. I would have rated this resteraunt 5 stars if it wasn't for the hostess mix up. Server Brady saved my review from being poor to great!  The children's crab bucket portions we're excellent, however I do not recommend the stuffed lobster shrimps. They may taste good to other people, but they were just not to my liking."}
{"text":"Tried this place with the little one after a visit to the mall.  We were both very disappointed. The food was absolutely terrible. Neither of us could eat more than a few bites and then we left.   I can in no way recommend this location and suggest going somewhere else."}
{"text":"This location has gone very downhill.  This evening I was out with one other person. Hanna was our server, she took our drink orders, where I asked for a tea with no lemon. When I was brought the tea, it had lemon and in promptly removed it and put it in the bucket so it didn't get too lemony. She didn't apologize for bringing it with lemon.  We ordered an appetizer of clam strips. We later also ordered our main meal of a crab cake sandwich with a cup of chowder and fish and chips.  I asked to have ranch for the appetizer when it came out. I waited for some time - long enough to realize I hadn't seen her in a while. I was waiting then for anyone to come by so I could get ranch before the appetizer got cold. Finally, she came to bring the chowder and I asked about it and she said sorry and went to grab it for me.   Next, when the crab cake sandwich and fish and chips were brought, I realized I was brought the crab cake DINNER and not the SANDWICH. Which was very odd considering I pointed to it when ordering, she took the time to lean in and read it, and I had asked for it with fries which would have been weird if I'd ordered the dinner as the dinner came with fries by default and didn't have an option for another side. I mentioned this to her and said that I didn't want the 2 crab cake dinner for $19.49, I wanted the one under Handhelds on the menu for $12.29. She said it was no problem that she could just comp it or she could take it back. I stressed that I just wanted the cheaper one but if they wanted to comp me I'd just keep it so I didn't have to wait for them to make me new food. She asked if I wanted a bun like the sandwich would have had and I said no it's fine. So I started to eat. My friend asked for ketchup and I asked for a refill on tea before she left.  She came back not too long later with a glove and said her manager told her she could comp it if she took away my other crab cake, since the sandwich would have only come with one. I was kind of in shock. I was like hey, fine whatever - I'll only be paying for the sandwich portion anyway - but it just kind of seemed petty. Like they were treating me like a thief trying to get more and pay less. None of it would have happened if not for the bad service in the first place - I was very clear in my order. So she scraped one of my crab cakes away and left. We didn't see her for quite a while again. No ketchup or tea was brought from when we asked the time before.  She was mildly apologetic about things, but I didn't sense any sincerity. Almost every time we asked for something, we had to ask again, then the order was wrong, then the take back of the additional food - it was just a mess and really felt like we were being treated badly.  The worst part, when we got the bill (and this was our mistake) we didn't check before handing our card. We should have. The $19.49 crab cake dinner that I didn't order and was promised to be comped to the sandwich price of $12.29 was not. The dinner was charged full price and they did a comp of $4.00. We were trying to just get out, and should have looked to make sure it was right first. But no - they had the nerve to do all that bad service and treat us poorly, THEN charge us that way? Maybe if I kept the second crab cake it would have been justified, but that was just obnoxious.   The food was generally good for what it's worth, but the drinks (tea and soda) were not great tasting. Also the bathrooms were absolutely horrifying. We couldn't bring ourselves to use them.  We used to come here a lot - driving out of our way to go - but I don't know if we'll be back."}
{"text":"Used to really like this place but I have been so disappointed the last few times we came. Then on my last visit, we bought a steam pot and it was practically empty...such a waste of money!"}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE! AFTER I ATE HERE ABOUT 20 MINUTES AFTER I HAD THE RUNS! FOOD WAS AWEFUL, OLD AND DISAPPOINTING!  The restaurant was empty on a Wed. 10 o'clock PM. Our server was nice, (Chase), knowlegable, however when we complained about the corn it was raw. Chase, explained that it was a different type of corn so they stay firmer when cooked...I never heard of a certain corn that when cooked tasted and felt like RAW CORN when bitten into it. That is a LIE. Later in the conversation he offered to exchange it for another side, we declined. We ordered a Steampot, 2 Lobsters, sausage, 6 shrimps and a pound of clams, 5 Alarm Hurricane Margarita, a captains kid meal. Our meal was horrible! We ate what we could and brought the rest for our dogs to eat since I paid for it. What a waste of money! Your restaurant cooks seafood all day long, how do you get it wrong, your chefs need to be retrained to know that seafood cooks quick and it is imperitive to keep an eye on seafood if cooked too long it becomes RUBBERY! My 19 month old son did not want to eat his food, which was unusual, because he is an eater. So I tried his food horrible the a 1 small piece of fish, OVERFRIED! (The piece of fish was around 2 1/2 inches in length maybe 3 inches at the most.) It seemed like the fish had been refried. Old fish. I was totally disappointed. I did not speak to the manager, it's obvious that it wouldn't have helped to tell anyone. Since the manager must be CLUELESS, the atmosphere was sad. This is probably the worst seafood I have had ever. The service was not attentive, when asked for a little time to look at the menu I timed him waiting 10 minutes before I looked for him and found him NO where to be found. Waited 5 more min. He was in the kitchen. I finally had to bother the bartender by eye contact only, unlike the others he was doing his job and the servers as well. When the place is empty I expect for the wait staff/server to PAY attention to the 1 customer that he has. I asked for the server for more tartar sauce for my son, (19 months old, he can't speak yet.) Chase brought after I asked a second time. My son tried it and pushed it aside and kept using the empty tartar that he had?! So I told him it's the same thing, and pushed it back to him...but he didn't use it! Puzzled I dipped my finger in the \"tartar\" sauce Chase had brought and to my surprise it was Blu cheese dressing! :0( I feel so cheated I think I spent $60.00 on crappy rubbery lobsters. I will be YELPING THIS BECAUSE SEAFOOD CHAINS LIKE YOURS SHOULD BE EXPERTS AT COOKING SEAFOOD! *SERGIO the GM called me quick 30 Min. after I posted this review. He apoligized and offered a free meal for our next visit, I told him I will not return, but I feel I deserve my money back. He said he would return my money and asked politely to please give them another chance. He also said to give him a call and let him improve on our next experience. I will go visit again but I do not wanting special treatment, \"I just want good food with good service in a timely manner\" \"THAT'S ALL CUSTOMERS WANT\"  I just want to thank you very much for your service Sergio, as the GM you did the right thing."}
{"text":"Great drinks, especially the Hurricane. Surf and Turf burger was a little dry and bun fell apart. Fries were good and crispy. Service at the bar is great!"}
{"text":"i really like joe's crab shack i ate here 2 or 3 time and it's the best seafood i ever had  in las vegas i know it's a big franchise but it's better then a lot of big restaurants in las vegas it reminds of  Key West, FL and they have the best clam chowder in  las vegas if you want seafood  and your in las vegas   go to  Joe's Crab Shack."}
{"text":"I went to joes today with my brother in law, nephew and sister and had amazing service!  The manager Matt was extremely cordial.  Got us sat right away and knew we were hungry.  Took our order since we communicated we were very hungry and knew what we wanted. Five star accommodations.  We sat outside and I wish I had brought a jacket.  The manager without a beat light the patio lamp.  I am so grateful to feel welcomed so warmly like family and will be back again."}
{"text":"There is one in Laughlin on the water where the seagulls bother you. I prefer that over being bothered by a waitress who waits till my glass is bone dry before refilling it.   I guess I should have ordered crab since I was at a crab house but I didnt I ordered a shrimp platter. It seemed bland. not enugh coconut on the coconut shrimp, the beer battered shrimp weren't crispy enough and the diping sauces where in paper cups??? weird wasnt expecting that. This is a place to have a beer and sit at the bar not to eat"}
{"text":"First, I must impress that I write this as a person who does not like seafood. However, my family does and I am obligated to travel with them. Get the point? Good.  Second, the location is extremely far from my home. It takes a good thirty (30) minutes to get here. Given that, the place does a great job in servicing its guests. Wait times are good and the attitudes of the servers are great.  Thirdly, I would recommend that they open the menu up to those that aren't seafood connoisseurs. Albeit a suggestion, please take it to heart as it would bring me here more ofter (rather than being dragged here).   Lastly, aside from my distaste of seafood (yeah, it's a trend here), the experience is great. The staff is great, the restaurant is great, and the overall experience is great. Aside from the lack of choice concerning the food, I really can't complain. I would recommend this place.  Additionally, the price is mediocre overall, but considering that lobster is not cheap, it is about average. But you do get a lot!"}
{"text":"Great food and environment! The restaurant was busy buy we were seated quickly. Our waiter Savoy was awesome! Love Joe's Crab Shack!"}
{"text":"Visiting Vegas and neither my husband or I had ever been to Joe's Crab Shack so we ventured in. Food was great! Service was outstanding! Manager even stopped by to make sure everything was good. Our waiter, Jeremy,  was a ton of fun and very attentive. 5 stars all the way!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service EVER!   Which ever manager was working tonight was not helpful AT ALL (she didn't even give us her name), when we tried to use a coupon along with along side some family we saw dining here as well.  Instead of trying to figure out a solution she ( the manager) basically said we could deal with it or we could leave!!  So much for enjoying a birthday dinner.  The food was good but had a bitter taste after experiencing this with the manager."}
{"text":"The food was amazing! I got the shrimp pasta Alfredo and it was delicious the workers have a smile on their faces the atmosphere had the right by the beach feel to it although there was a bunch of flies flying around none went in the food just on the window so if you want to try and kill flies have a seat at one of the Windows other than that it's was great! I recommend the shrimp Alfredo it is just heavenly and their house salads."}
{"text":"Today I came into Joe's Crab Shack on Southern and McClintock. I was greeted at the door and taken to my seat right away. I sat in a booth underneath a steering wheel that looked like it was stolen off of the Titanic! It was pretty neat! My servers name was Hana. I only remember because she wrote it on a napkin and I took it with me. She was really nice and really knew her stuff about the menu. I almost just ordered everything. She just made it sound amazing! Then while I was eating, the manager Courtney approached me and asked me what brought me in to Joe's. I began telling her about my day and she actually seemed interested. Most managers just want you to say you're fine so they can go on their way. This one actually acted like she cared. Overall, my experience was better than any 5 stars could give credit to! I will definitly be coming back to this location!"}
{"text":"The Cajun steam pot is sooo good. Perfectly seasoned. I think its way better than hot n juicy's seasoning. There's snow crab, dungenous crab, shrimp , n sausage all in one pot. U can choose from fries n hush puppies as your side or corn n red potatoes boiled I'm bag also. Always a fun environment!"}
{"text":"Well here it is... my bad review.  The service is the worst! I am basing this review on my last 3 visits, sadly there will not be a 4th. The food is okay, but when you order crab it's always a \"crap shoot\" Maybe you'll get a good bucket, maybe you wont. If you complain and turn your expensive dinner out into a negative thing, they will attempt to make it better.  My problem with that is that I don't like to complain, for these prices I expect somebody there to check it before it gets to me. That \"somebody\" is supposed to be the server. My server has never delivered the food. Never. They take the order, bring drinks and deliver the check, all done to slow.  After we are promptly seated, we are forgotten. 5 - 10 minutes before we are greeted and offered beverages. Appetizers come out only moments before the entrees, water glasses are left empty. I get that is is a casual dining experience and so the service should make it appear relaxed and fun while at the same time giving at a minimum 4 star service. Our check is usually between $100 - $ 150 That equals $ 20 - $ 30 tip !!! The last 3 visits in my opinion the server deserved $ 10 !!! For the sake of management, who may wonder about this terrible review, I will tell you these 3 visits occurred on weeknights  between 7:00 and 8:00. Why so late ? We drive 45 miles to get there!                                                 PEACE OUT, JOE'S CRAP SHACK"}
{"text":"Great food and service! Had the crab stuffed mushrooms to start and I thought those were delicious.  The main entry was bacon wrapped and seafood stuffed shrimp. All I can say is yuuuuuuummmmm! Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Just waited for over an hour, then was told the table was ready, but needed cleaned up. After another 30 mins the table was still not clean. The place was quite empty. The staff just did not seem to care. Just had to leave, the kids were starving. Too late to go another place. Will get take out!!"}
{"text":"Took 15 minutes for hush puppies and 50 minutes for food.  Place not even busy. Went to the one by Mills and food came out 15 mins. And manager brought the food out like he did something. ... No silverware also."}
{"text":"Matt was awesome .. He took really good care of me and my best friend .. Really friendly and attentive"}
{"text":"Horrible. Food was a joke!!! Clams were sent to us EMPTY, no clams!!!!  Took so long for appetizer without us complaining they offered to comp it. Greens beans and  shrimp literally tasted like soap.  Waitress was so great, Jenny!!! She is better than this place.  I offered to pay for our beers ( as we ate nothing) and leave a tip on full bill, manager comped everything after he came out the first time and asked what the problem was.   We said you sent a bucket f shells, he said sometimes that happens.  He's wrong!!! I I nicely said don't insult yourself or us The Clams should never have been sent out empty in the first place!!!! Staff was nice but will Never go again, they should close this place down!,,,"}
{"text":"Been a little while since we've been here, but the family has been on a seafood binge last few weeks so this was one of the stops.  Food is OK but we go here for the atmosphere and the experience more so than the food. I wouldnt go out of my way to come here, but once in a while as a family dinner night we all enjoy this place a lot!  Not saying the food is bad, but its just not like WOW OMG...service is good, prices are fair. Overall 4 stars, maybe 3.5 but ill round up :)"}
{"text":"Only been here once but the service and food were amazing. My waitress was very attentive and was knowledgable and honest about the menu. All the employees were extremely friendly and welcoming. Looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"Sam is the best!  Very attentive and funny. Food, as always, really good and hot!  Fun atmosphere and great food."}
{"text":"First time at a Joe's. Started with a fun drink called TKO Punch. Had crab nachos as an app. Ate the steamed pot w lobster, sausage, and crab. Everything was so delicious! Only gave 3 stars because for a Friday night, there was only 1 waiter on staff. It's def not his fault he could barely check on us or bring us things promptly because he was very busy. Besides that he was very friendly."}
{"text":"We tried Joe's today for the first time.  Overall, it was an enjoyable experience.  However, the price is too high for the quality of the product.  Honestly, I enjoy Red Lobster more, which is half the price for Joe's, and Red Lobster gives you bread."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for the first time about a month ago for our anniversary. LOVED IT We shared a steam pot ($40) and we where both super full after.  Its a really down to earth kind of place and the staff is really friendly.  Going back there in a week! :D"}
{"text":"Went there for Valentine's date (: ! It was an amazing experience. Senta is the best waitress there ! Love that lady. Next time you stop by ask for her and she might just make your night."}
{"text":"I was forced to eat here one time.  Overcooked. Under-seasoned. Flaccid.  Nice staff though."}
{"text":"I love the coconut shrimp, especially the sauce.  The snow crab are a little on the smaller side but the sweet flavored crabmeat is delectable! I also really enjoyed the service. Gera was the kindest server I've had in a long time."}
{"text":"When we first walked in it was a bit weird. It seemed like the hosts didn't know how to do their job of seating. The couple ahead of us stood there for a solid 6 minutes before they were escorted ten steps forward where they proceeded to wait for anther minute for whatever reason(there were plenty of tables)  they sat us (party of 2) at a table for 6....whatever, not a problem. We shared the classic joe pot-DELICIOUS!! It is a little pricey our meal was 35 for 2 drinks (tea) but they were nice and the manager seemed to really care about what we thought. I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Best Happy Hour in town! Be sure to come on Tuesdays when they have $2 Hurricanes and draft beers! Also the fried pickles are awesome! The best is the friendly bartenders and half price appetizers! Woohoo!"}
{"text":"Great service and excellent food. Our server Hailey was awesome. We came in with a large group of people. She was really friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Excellent service and I appreciate my waiter he took the time to actually look for my lost retainer and found it! And when i came back to pick it up he even remembered me so thanks!"}
{"text":"Just left Joes; WOW thats about all I have to say; pure awesome!!! Hands down the best seafood I have ever had!!!! Tara was the best server !!!"}
{"text":"My husband took me to Joes Crab Shack for the first time and I had a good time. The tables were clean and there was not a overly strong fish smell. I ordered Joe's Classic Steampot and enjoyed it thoroughly. The food was flavorful and the shrimp were a decent size. I also ordered a side of crawfish, but it did not taste right. I suggest waiting until the crawfish season. My husband does not eat seafood and thankfully Joe's has non-seafood food.  I like how they offer different tools to use for the crabs, a bucket to discard shells, a tips on eating crabs placemat, a souvenir and scented wipes for when your done eating.   They were a little busy at the time we came in, but our servers were knowledgeable, and attentive. We also had a manager come to our table once and check on us, which we thought was nice.   We found the atmosphere fun, lively and energetic. I see many people complaining about the loud music and dancing employees. If I'm not in the mood for the experience that Joe's Crab Shack offers then I'll either eat outside, since there is a nice patio, order TO GO, or go another time. This place is the first I've been to with dancing employees. I think this is a fun and casul place to eat with friends and family. This location even has a kids play place."}
{"text":"Went to joes for valentines with my wife and we have been sick since then. 3 days so far. We called mgmt and they did nothing.  Had oysters and dungeness crab. We are both sick and can't leave the house.  Other than the lynching table picture that was the most horrible thing I've ever seen, the food quality is apparently the reason why joes in az has closed all but one store. Would have been nice if management responded. But due to liability they obviously won't take blame. Last time there for sure.  Only Bluewater grill from now on"}
{"text":"Back again at JOES!! It was $2 Tuesday yesterday so definitely busy. Me and my husband enjoy coming here every other week to be helped by Zuri. She is the only waitress we come for. Any who, Great Service. The only thing I just hate hearing from a wonderful waitress' mouth is, \"Sorry.\" She apologized for the food coming out late and being on the \"Slow Side\". I'm not sure if ANY of the management team reads these, but let me clarify. I'd much rather have a Friendly Outgoing Excellent server like Zuri, than have a server who you can tell doesn't care about the customers. Zuri, I'd rather wait a hour with great service and hospitality. Than have someone rush our meal and lack communication with customers.. $30 meal, $50 tip. You are the best they come. Don't apologize for anything again."}
{"text":"This is one of those places I want to like, but every time I go it disappoints. I've been there at least 5 times.   Food is very bland. Over priced. And just not very good.   The atmosphere can be fun, but that's all it has going for it."}
{"text":"id give it no stars if i had the chance.  this place is waaaaaaay too over priced for what they give you.   i couldn't even enjoy my dinner because i knew i was getting ripped off."}
{"text":"Went to Joe's this past Sunday. Never been there but said if it was any good I would write a review. Usually go to Red Lobster and was going to try Crab Corner but the buckets at Joes looked pretty good. We started with garlicky mussels. Broth was outstanding! Wine butter garlic sauce with lots of garlic and black pepper. Only a small piece of garlic bread cut in two came with. That was a bummer cuz that broth was the perfect dip for the bread. Had to order more bread which cost extra.  Ordered the Sunset  Fire Grill for 2 for $40. Came with Snow and Dungeness crab, shrimp, sausage,potatoes, and ear of corn. The spice on everything was flavorful and went with the seafood well. Tasted great on the corn. No drawn butter was served. Just dipped it all in the garlicky mussel broth. Snow crab was sweet and cooked perfectly. Dungeness crab was more work and arguably more meaty but was a little overcooked. I like King crab the best and will be trying that next time. Didn't understand the sausage served with. Would have been  better grilled, but really could have done without. Shrimp was chewy and overcooked and one was not deveined. Finished with key lime pie. Nice and tart topped with a layer of whipped cream. A dollop of cream was served with which I found to be a bit much.   An overall good meal. Around $100 for two. Can't give more than 3 stars- no salad, bread, drawn butter, and shrimp not that great. Also waitress disappeared for a while. I will get something different next time but will give the mussels and snow crab a 4.5."}
{"text":"This review is for our server MONIQUE! She is simply amazing, fantastic, incredible!!! So attentive, friendly and has it all it together. Of all the times, I've been to Joe's (many times on both coasts), she is the only one that made my experience the most enjoyable. For example, how many servers give you \"code names\" on your bib while you enjoy your meal, gets the shy guys to get up off their feet and dance, and maneuvers the dinning floor without breaking a sweat? Believe me, if you want to feel truly at home while you grub on those juicy crab legs, see Monique."}
{"text":"Not worth the money; $115 for 4 people and that doesn't include the tip! It was a zoo. We were seated by a table of about 7, 3 were children. I was amazed at how the parents allowed their children to run around, as if it were a playground, absolutely ridiculous!   For the amount of money we paid, I was expecting to had received more bang for my buck. The ONLY positive thing was the super great service from our server.   Definitely wont be returning."}
{"text":"Our waiter Jason was great however I was not a big fan of the hokey pokey dance the staff had to do.  It was a bit loud but it helped drown out the sound of the man behind me hacking up a lung. It was high energy and a nice change."}
{"text":"I was going to put 3 stars on this review but they finally decided to re-decorate and get ready of the knick knacks. Joe's Crab Shack is not bad for a seafood restaurant chain but this location is always busy since it's next to mall and highway. The one issue is service, we went on a Sunday night they were busy but staffed accordingly.  So what do they focus on? cheesy dance numbers and birthdays.  I love the dishes, usually order something with shrimp and clams or the pallea..But this last time I dared to order the steampot and was underwhelmed to say the least, it wasn't as big as I thought it would be."}
{"text":"We had a great meal but I kept thinking I wonder why they don't serve butter with there crab, so when our waitress La La was asked if we could get some our server said oh no! Cant eat crab without butter and 3 minutes later she came back with the butter and a hot plate of crab on the house. Great food great service great fun. We will be back."}
{"text":"Ordered the Honey Peach Smash from Stacie...its great and the bartender made it exactly as the picture shows"}
{"text":"Calamari appetizer was the best we've had in a long time. Great quantity too. The Bairdi crab Bucket was superb as was my Reel Big Catch. Our server Jamie was Great and it wasn't that busy for a Thursday night. Highly Recommend!"}
{"text":"Joe's crab shack is the place you go for warm, some times fake, family friendly atmosphere . I my self have celebrated two of my own birthdays in the confines of this eatery. I particularly enjoy the joe's steam pots. A little pricey in my mind as none are under 20 dollars. Their good though considering that the seafood your eating had to take 10 hour truck ride to get on to your plate in the middle of a desert. With titles that involves words like \"Cajun\", \"long Islander\" and \"Orleans\"  Joe's try's to sell culture to the urban sprawled and culture deprived suburbanites of the west. I Praise Joe's for their cleverness but it seems all to tacky eating the mussel and clam filled \"Long Islander\" while staring into a all to similar sea of brown housing tracts. The Steam Pots Besides their irony are simple consisting of the seafood that comes with the variation of the pot you chose, potatoes, sausage and generous amounts of melted butter. People Dog on Joe's steam pots for their lack of authenticity and that they have had better when their Grandma made home cooked crab when they where kids growing up in the boondocks of redneckville, Maine. Well i say unless you wanna back to grandmas house in redneckville I suggest you go to Joe's and relish their transplanted steam pots. Joe's is like many restaurant chains who try to inject culture to many culture less neighborhoods, sure the atmosphere is fake, the staff even faker , the food and the steam pots are just above mediocre but what more can you ask for your in the freakin desert!"}
{"text":"Discovered Joe's Fish and Shrimp a couple of years ago and have been here many times, with quite a drive to do so, since.  The fried seafood was as good as coastal fish and shrimp.  Went last night and they have changed the batter and it seems the fish and shrimp also.  It was as if I had walked into a Denny's, Village Inn or IHop.  Heavy batter that tasted like the frozen boxed you get from the supermarket and fry at home.  If this is what you eat at Joe's I hope you will do as I did and let the manager know and maybe they will go back to the previous preparation."}
{"text":"2 stars for service only . Server was very nice ( almost overly so, too chipper). 11:45am: only two tables seated, one guy eating at bar.  Should have turned and left.  Lobster bisque was over diluted, no flavor, no lobster bits.  WAs taken off The bill. Server very apologetic. Guy at bar complains of grease soaked food immediately afterwards. Hostess staring at customers while they are eating. Very unsettling feeling Strike 2. Shrimp wrapped in bacon over dirty rice. Bacon both burned and raw, quite the culinary feat! Rice had funky flavor that unfortunately lingered, not in a good way. Shrimp po boy : meh .  Again not much flavor. Mediocre at best. Fried pickle chips were good. Millennial manager made rounds to the now whopping 5 tables seated at height of lunch hour. Expressionless , going thru motions. Let him know about bisque:'yeah, that's how it comes to us' and wandered off. Whoa , calm the excitement! Bottom line : overpriced mediocre food at best. Suggest going elsewhere."}
{"text":"The staff was really friendly. The atmosphere was really fun. The buckets were good but I was a bit disappointed when I cracked open all those crabs and got barely any meat.  But then again, when I did get some, it was delicious =)"}
{"text":"The problem we had with this Joe's Crab Shack was the portion size. We ordered a bowl (not a cup) of the lobster bisque and received enough soup to barely cover the bottom of the bowl. We asked the waiter to top off the soup, instead of adding a dollop of soup the manager came by to argue with us. All you get is 4.0 ounces of soup, and that's it! I suppose that's marginally better than No Soup For You, but the attitude was the same.  The rest of our meal was a couple of crab cake sandwiches and french fries, the number of fries each of us received could have been counted on one hand.  Left hungry (this has never happened to us before at a Joe's Crab Shack)."}
{"text":"I think the food is good. But I went to California recently to a place called The Boiling Crab. The amount of seafood you get and the price is superb. It makes Joe's crab portions look like appetizers and definitely overpriced."}
{"text":"Service great, friendly. Queen crab delicious. Everything else horrible. Stuffed crab mushrooms, bad. Cesar salad, bitter couldn't finish it. Shrimp skewers over rice still had colon canal in them. Pass on this place."}
{"text":"Talk about service, they went so far as to go next door to get celery for my crab dip appitizer. Thats great service.  Oysters spicy. Mmmm mmmm good  Grest value Great service"}
{"text":"Let's start from the beginning. No hostess in sight. The place was maybe 20% full on a Sunday at 5pm; servers and buspersons running around; bartender looking clueless, and no one even has the courtesy of greeting us and letting us know the hostess is on her way. What's the time limit on neglect at the front desk? Five minutes before you start feeling invisible? The hostess did apologize profusely, stating that she was showing a co-worker how to do \"something\", but who cares? We just wanted a table. When she finally seated us, she apologized again and tried to make up for the lack of attention by recommending to us HER favorite drink on the menu. We were so honored to have her recommendation. We ordered beer instead. The server, an Ashton Kutcher lookalike, greeted us with much of the usual and boring flair expected in a chain restaurant. What is it these days, that a server does not bother to write down the order for 3 people? Do they all think they have superhuman memories? Does management discourage writing down the order? I don't get it. Inevitably, Mr Kutcher screws up the order by bringing me the correct fish ( it was supposed to be blackened, but it wasn't) and cole slaw. I haven't ordered cole slaw in well over 40 years due to food allergies. I knew when I saw the cole slaw that something was wrong. I sent it back for the corn on the cob that I did order and chastised Ashton for not writing down the order. Ashton tells me I didn't order the meal the way it should have been ordered. Hello! Blackened Redfish! Is there a different way of saying it? The meal that he brought was very good, but it seems I should get what I ordered. Is that asking for too much? Next time, I am asking for LaLa. If she's not there, I'm moving on. And then, with the restaurant still more than half empty, we have to sit there for 10 minutes staring at dirty dishes because no one has the presence of mind to clear the table. Hey Joe, drop the flair and the reconstituted and unrecognizable traditional birthday song and provide something customers really want. Service that even an average Joe would expect when dining out!!  CLOSED? I wonder why....."}
{"text":"Chicken sandwich was like a piece of leather.    Go figure that one.    Got a boiled dinner.    Not much to full one up!    Sorry Charlie, this fish is not going back"}
{"text":"We had a great time! Our server La La was top notch! If you have the chance to visit this location, definitely request to be seated in La La's section. The food was YUM and service was great. La La will be sure that your experience is amazing!!! Get it!"}
{"text":"My overall experience was: NOT WORTH IT!  Atmosphere: Nice and cheerful.  Food: Average at best.  The shrimp was rubbery and hard.  The crab cakes were ok but nothing to write home about.  The breaded fish was soggy.  The buckets of seafood had good flavor but were very expensive ~$30.  Overall, the mediocrity of the food does not justify the prices.    Service: As we looked around we saw that other tables were receiving placemats and bibs by other waitresses.  Our waitress didn't even refill our drinks.  She was distracted, inattentive, and unhelpful.  We decided that we wanted dessert and she failed to mention that each dessert was meant for two people.  We all ordered a dessert and each was entirely too much to handle.  I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"Too bad I can't give zero stars Arrived June 8th around 5pm. Promptly sat down at a table. Maybe 4 other tables with customers. Watched about 20 different servers walk past out table. Nobody stopped to help us. After 10 minutes we walked out and the lady who sat us said, \"thanks for coming\" I said nobody served us. She said, \"where were you sitting\". SMH.... Place was empty, with 3 different  groups of young servers standing around  joking. I'd say poorly managed but that would imply there is management. What a joke, do yourself a favor and spend your hard earned money somewhere else that appreciates it's customers."}
{"text":"Drove into Pittsburgh really late at night. So late the city had pretty much shut up shop. Walked around Station Square for literally an hour passing this place three times before finally having lost all sense of reason and succumbed to the kitsch seafood decor, flying shark with mardi-gras beads in its mouth and party lights. I am allergic to crab but thought hey you only live once right?! and ordered the lobster and king crab steam pot from the extra super buff teenage waiter whose shirt was so tight I could not understand how he could carry around a tray full of food. He was pleasant enough and although the place was practically empty he was never around when I wanted him and always around asking if I needed anything while I was stuffing my face full of sea creatures. The steampot was fine but the whole box of spices they add to it completely ruin the dish and I shudder to think they try to do that to hide how not-so-fresh the seafood is..ugh..Well I didn't have my face in a toilet or have exploding diarrhoea after or die from sea creature poisoning so there's a plus. The prices are really high for what they serve but Pittsburgh is pretty far from the ocean. On the plus side I love trains and you can sit right next to the train line and not even hear them pass every 20mins. Also the view across to the city is amazing across the river framed by the monumental massive amount of bridges and you are literally steps from the funicular to walk off your dinner. So whats the lesser of two evils this place or the Hard Rock Crappe next door?"}
{"text":"Buyer beware.  They've cut their portions at this place and are still charging the same amount.  Won't be returning and have added it to my Sh@t List of Las Vegas Restaurants that is pasted to my refrigerator in my kitchen.    I guess these chain restaurants think we're all stupid and don't see what's going on."}
{"text":"Date night: went to joe's crab shack with my BF for dinner after he raved about the crab steampot he'd eaten there recently.  We were immediately seated at a table once the hostess learned we weren't waiting on a booth.  It quickly became apparent that we would not be conversing with one another on date night where we were seated.  Apart from the intermittent \"line dance\" known to all who frequent this place, the din in the restaurant was deafening.  My BF quickly asked that we be re-seated at the bar where he knew the service was excellent from his previous experience.  He got the same \"crab daddy\" steampot as before.  I ordered the \"beantown steampot\" complete with 2 entire lobsters (my nirvana).  To start, we both ordered their lobster bisque.  It arrived semi-warm and chock full of flavor albeit a little \"orangey\" colored, which begged the question as to whether it was infused with cheese or ???  I was ravenous and ate most of what I ordered. So did my BF with still plenty to take home.  The lobsters, with shrimp, clams and potatoes were very well- seasoned!  An NBA playoff game, nailbiting, down to the wire was airing on the tv's during our dinner which, in my mind, made the experience exciting and memorable.  It also made for a lively crowd.   I walked out, satisfied and full to the brim.  Romantics, it's probably not your place.  But if you're comfortable in your relationship (i.e can wear a bib with your BF and he still desires you) and looking for a satisfying seafood evening that won't break your budget try joe's instead of red lobster."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of seafoods, but I am picky about what I eat. Joe's Crab Shack is probably the best restaurant I've eaten that's similar to Crab Pot in Seattle. I tried Boiling Crab and was not impressed, but Joe's Crab Shack? Definitely satisfied my standards!  The menu varied. I only tried the steam pots - the KJ Steam Pot and the newly added Texas Steam Pot. Both were filling and tasteful! The portions were slightly large but big enough to be finished.  The corn was sweet, but not too sweet. The crab legs were amazing in size and taste! So. Much. Meat.  I had a great first impression here, with the food and the customer service. Our waitress was very kind and constantly checked up on us.  I recommend this place for people who aren't afraid to get their hands dirty when eating. Also, if you ever tried Crab Pot in Seattle and enjoyed it then you'll definitely enjoy Joe's Crab Shack :)"}
{"text":"If I could request Stephen every time I come here, I definitely would. Amazing service. Dude was completely on top of it all night on what looked to be a super busy Friday night. On top of that, we had a party of 7 and he made sure everything was perfect for each member of our group. I'm not a fan of crab, so I had the shrimp sampler. I expected like 3 coconut, 3 crispy and a small handful of popcorn. Nope. Shrimp for days. I usually don't make it a point to count my food, but I did this time because it surprised me a bit. 6 of each with a good size of the plate being conquered by the popcorn shrimp. I finally understood the plight of the Three-six Mafia when they said, \"I eat so many shrimps I got iodine poisoning.\" I'm not a skinny kid by any means, I like to throw down on some food, and this plate had me down to the last two shrimp. I had to make the conscious effort to not let this plate beat me. My wife looked at me and it had an Adrian and Rocky feel to it. As I finished the second to last shrimp, I could hear her cheering me on in my head, \"You're doing it! You're gonna do it!\" It was just me and this final shrimp now. No way was I going to let it beat me. I'd eaten his family, now I had to eat him. No way was I going to let this shrimp come back and get revenge on me or my family in the days to come. I made it a point to look it right where it's eyes should've been , ripped off the tail and popped the whole thing in my mouth. (Warning: the next part is very graphic, so if you have a weak stomach, please stop here) I chewed on this shrimp until his body was only mush rolling around in my mouth. All I needed to do was swallow and the task would be complete. I was stuck. My own body betrayed me. It's as if my body had somehow made a pact with the shrimp to double cross me at the final moment. Sitting there in a room full of people, with a mouthful of chewed up shrimp that I couldn't swallow. I was too full. My own body. I couldn't believe it, I know we had our disagreements, like when I forced it to run or do exercise, but I never thought it would betray me like this. I sat there with a sense of determination, I was not going to spit this shrimp out into a napkin. Not today. I reached for my sprite and my stomach churned, almost to try and tell me it knew what I was about to do. I smiled, for I knew that victory was within reach. I took a swig of that clear, bubbly sweet liquid and as it came into contact with the chewed up remains of my fallen foe, it created a slurry that confused my body and made it past the doorman. The mix of shrimp and sprite started to go down and I knew the battle was over. I had beat the shrimp. I raised my arms in victory and my wife snapped me back to reality. \"What are you doing?!\" She was completely unaware of the grudge match that had just taken place before her very eyes. \"Nothing, just stretching,\" I replied. I could never let her know how closely she had come to catastrophe. For her own safety, I took a secondary swallow of sprite to clear any remnants and sat back in my chair, ready to once again join the conversation with my friends and family who will never truly know the devastation they came so close to that night. (Note: this started out as just a positive review that went sideways on me. I had an awesome night here with great food and  service, and I hope my narrative doesn't detract from that overall message. This place is great. If you're on the fence about going there, just give it a shot. If you end up with Stephen [possibly Steven, I'm not 100 percent sure of the spelling] he will make sure your night goes as well as mine.)"}
{"text":"Our experience tonight was full of awesome surprises!  The food was fa fa nominal!  Obviously the drinks were too...  Manager Ashley and bartender joe were attentive, fun, and made sure we had a fun time.  We will return over and over because of our experience tonight!"}
{"text":"OMG! Can I tell you how much I love crab!! I don't know why it's taken soo long for me to try this place, but let me tell you YUM!!! We got the trio combo crab bucket- UGH it was soooo good!!! Ask for some garlic and mix it with your melted butter with lemon....YUM YUM YUM!!!"}
{"text":"This is a fun little eatery.  That said, don't expect too much.   The King-crab legs look like they came from anorexic crabs but hey, you have a wastebasket right on the table where you can throw away the shells, along with a roll of Bounty to dry your hands. Yes that means you can eat with your fingers - the kids love it. How cool is that?   The crabs taste ok."}
{"text":"Last time I went to Joes I had a good experience. But this time I was very disappointed. First of all our server didn't bring us silver ware nor did she bring crackers to open the crab legs. She only came to our table once and that was when she delivered the food, she didn't come back until we had to chase her down for the check. I ordered the KJ steampot which comes with queen crab legs, mussels and scallops (along with corn and potatoes) I honestly felt like I wasn't given enough food. I was only given 3 scallops, 2 crabs, 2 potatoes, and most of my mussels were still closed. I will not waste my time or money on this place again...such a disappointment."}
{"text":"Always the best customer service and the most delicious sea food! We love Joe's and so does our 4 year old \"Joe's crab stacks\" is what she calls it! The pineapple piña colada is amazing and steam pots are more than worth the cost! We definitely refer our friends and family here! Can't wait to use our autism donation voucher in the very near future!"}
{"text":"Low score for poor cleanliness. Filthy floor and tables. Made us wait with half empty place for a table to be cleaned, then sat us with a baby at a very dirty un-wiped table. Ordered 3 crab pots. All pretty good. A little pricey. $29-$32 each. Fairly pricey for 1 1/4 lbs.  Ok. Not bad. But just to dirty for us."}
{"text":"Went to have dinner Wednesday night.  It wasnt busy and we were seated right away.  We had the best server ever...Kristin!  Since it was my first time there, she explained how to order and made suggestions depending on what i liked.  She was attentive and checked up on us to make sure we were ok.  Oh yah, we were fine and happy with our crab!  The food was good and for sure I'll be back for more next time.  What I especially liked was how Kristin chased after us to return my friends daughter's ring and bracelet she had left on the table.  I thought that was cool.  Thanks Kristin...youre the best!"}
{"text":"Worst dinning experience ever. Management put the whole restaurant in danger by not handling properly an argument between 2 booths.   As a Manager, you should worry more about the big scenario. Your concern about having the 2 checks from those tables only had the result of having an entire restaurant angry.  You let the issue escalate from a single misunderstanding to what it seemed like a talk show fight. Managers did a terrible job. Been coming to this restaurant for years solely for the crab buquets, but Def not coming back at all"}
{"text":"TOOK MY FAMILY HERE TONIGHT.  FOOD SUCKED AND JEREMY WAS A TOTAL IDIOT ACTING LIKE A TEENAGE GIRL. worst experience of any restaurant I've ever had in las vegas I should have asked to speak to the manager because I think that Jeremy should probably be reprimanded I'm not sure what was going on in his life today but maybe he should have taken the day off. I am asking the manager to email me personally so I can give a more detailed review."}
{"text":"The cigarette stench at the front door was so bad, I almost went somewhere else. The food and service was excellent - but I won't be coming back if they don't get that horrible problem corrected"}
{"text":"Went here months ago, but only rated it now, because I was cleaning out a piece of luggage and found the business card from an Assistant General Manager, Paul L.  So, I dropped in for lunch while in LV for a business trip.  Basically I wanted seafood at a reasonable price, where I didn't have to drive back to the casino, deal with the crowds, or navigate the casino to get to a dining area.  Food's pretty good.  I mean, it's a chain restaurant, so don't expect anything that's off the charts.  However, the service was good, the staff was courteous, and I wasn't rushed, even though I was just a single guy dining there.  Overall, if I were in the area again, I would definitely drop in again."}
{"text":"Drinks were amazing, food quality was mixed amongst the table, but Tonia was the best server EVER! Request her and you'll have the best time"}
{"text":"The service was great.  The food was tastier then I expected.  The atmosphere reminded me of a club. The waitress dances for you to keep you in good spirits.   I would be honest, the steam pot was a bit pricey.  I would recommend their tiki drinks which gives you a signature glass to take home. Clearly it was too good to get a photo before I finished it off."}
{"text":"Jesus was our server, awesome service!! He was very informative regarding menu choices. I'll definitely be back when I'm in town, as long as \"Jesus\" works there.  Aloha"}
{"text":"Incredible Dungess crab and their steak is delicous. Great place for a Friday night out."}
{"text":"Great service! Had a wonderful experience! and the manager Amber checked on us more than once. She was full of energy and Super friendly!, don't see tht everday! Very impressive, Also the drinks mmmm yummy! and happy hour, wow what a great deal. I think i found my new favorite! See you guys soon for shure!"}
{"text":"Matt is awesomistically amazeballs!!! Thanks for putting up with my needy butt! Its always yummy and def worth the price!!!"}
{"text":"Best service we've had at this Joe's location since 2004. Thanks Judi!!  She works Thursday and Friday!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"My dad and I came in for a later lunch on Sunday and there weren't many people, probably because of the terrible weather. We were seated by the window which gave us a nice view out onto the river. Our server was friendly and made conversation easily.  My dad and I shared a Classic Steampot and the Blackened Mahi Tacos. I thought the steampots came with both corn and potatoes, but our pot was missing potatoes. My dad wasn't bothered enough to say anything. The food was cooked well, but all the seafood and meat was too heavily seasoned and too salty for me. The only exceptions to this were the corn in the steampot (I ate the half covered by the husk, and it was delicious--crunchy and sweet) and the chips that came with the tacos. My dad and I also found that there wasn't nearly enough pico de gallo to eat with all the  tortilla chips.  It was a nice meal, but I'm not big on seafood so I probably won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Joe's Crab Shack twice, once in San Antonio and in Henderson this week. I have to say that I was disappointed in the quality of the dungeness crab and Alaskan King crab.  The dungeness tasted old and dry and the crab legs were dry and salty. My friend had the mahi and said it was good. So be careful what you order."}
{"text":"This is our go to restaurant for big, family style meals. Our family of six orders three steamer pots and three appetizers and we leave happy. Last night we took our pop for his 70th birthday and Joes did not let us down. Our waitress was very attentive and pleasant. The food was a bit on the cool side but we were hungry so no one complained. I love the sausage which is an odd thing to say about a seafood restaurant but there it is. The crab is lush and there is plenty of melted butter.  Joes is well kept despite its casual atmosphere. Tables were clean and well stocked. It's a bit pricey. I have to be honest. $170 for 8 people eating  family style. But it's not often that we go so it's certainly a treat."}
{"text":"Prompt service, accommodating server, decent appetizers, we had both sausages the andioulli is my preference. It.s not as spicy as others I've had. The smoked was not very smoky flavored, crab in the classic bucket was yummy, the peel shrimp was over cooked therefore chewy. Had cheesecake for dessert and was an excellent end to dinner. Can't say enough good things about the service.   Overall it's what you would expect of a chain. Fun place to eat, I think they intentionally seated families with little kids away from groups with no kids. I appreciate this. I don't have to listen to your baby cry and we have a nice adult meal without background kids. On purpose? I don't know, appreciated? Wholeheartedly."}
{"text":"Sorry but I will not visit this crab shack again, the place looks like it might need some remodeling and some real cleaning I went kinda of early so there was only a few other customers in and our food still took forever to get out the kitchen , we had three rounds of drinks before our food came so what do that tell you, lol we was feeling tipsy, the customer service was crap these kids these days need to learn how to treat customers if they want good tips, this is Vegas you would expect grade A hospitality"}
{"text":"Everyone was friendly from the hostess to the manager. Our server was fast and courteous. The food and drinks were great. I would definitely recommend to people looking for a great place to eat."}
{"text":"My husband and I just moved to Arizona and we are excited to try new places. We came to Joe's tonight and the service was amazing. Our server was friendly, helpful, and offered some suggestions for us.   We both ordered steampots and our food was very good. The server checked with us a few times, a manager came by asking if our food was ok, and they put fun bibs on us before we ate.   Thank you for a nice evening out, Joe's!"}
{"text":"This place isn't so bad.. It's not good either.. It's pretty much in between good and bad. The food is ok... This is not the place to spend money for food occasionally."}
{"text":"Went on 10/18 for my birthday. As we walked in we were asked if we were celebrating anything ? I said it was my birthday and that was the end if that. Why ask then ? The crab was delicious. However the Lobster special was over battered and dry not the way it looked on TV. Ashlee was our server she was great. Next year we go somewhere else to celebrate"}
{"text":"Came here for a buddy's birthday on a Monday so we wouldn't have to fight a crowd. Well, that was a huge mistake! There was no crowd but they obviously had their \"D\" squad working. From forgetting our drinks and messing up a medium rare steak. It was pretty sad and I felt bad for our waiter because it wasn't his fault the kitchen staff couldn't read the order. You could tell the manager was tired of dealing with us but it was seriously one thing after another. Save your money and go to a real seafood restaurant!"}
{"text":"service was great hut food sucked. undercooked potatoes and soggy crab legs. you would think the crab shack knew how to cook crab legs. go to red lobster. alot of money to still be hungry. environment loud. not a pleasant dining experience."}
{"text":"I can't stop thinking about last nights dinner, I'm so excited for my lunch today. Portions are so big that I was able to take some to take to work today. Donny helped me out and even broke out into a little dance, it was great! My son loved it as well and can't wait to go back. The play ground was awesome it's shaped like a ship and it kept my little one super excited, he got home and fell right asleep.. definitely coming back!! Thanks Donny and the amazing staff!"}
{"text":"We waited for 10 minutes after getting seated.  Nobody ever came to take a drink order, let alone a food order.  The folks around us were getting waited on and they sat after us.  Good team work there too, the hostess asked a server to seat us, she flat out said \"no\".  Wow, way to get he business in.  We took our $60 to Bahama Breeze.   You can't be that shitty with so many restaurants in sight of yours."}
{"text":"Customer service gets 5 stars the manager was very kind and came to our table to check on us and before that we overheard him checking on other tables and making an older couples day with a little chit chat.  We ordered chicken strips with fries Mac and cheese with Apple sauce Chipotle crab cake Caesar salad - yum!  Yes I think Joe's is over priced but everyone knows this and you still go back and the prices are the same so stop complaining they have unique items and they're delicious. Drinks are fun too We had a server in training and she thought ahead and was super nice, the gentlemen training was helpful and very observant  We'll be back"}
{"text":"Saw pictures of free mason jars and it is not true at all. Servers lost track of their tables and was asked multiple times of food that was not ours. Took 15-20 min just to get a waiter as two tables that day after us received their drink orders and they ordered heir food already. Once I went to ask for a waiter was given a free desert for our wait but still waited a long time for everything."}
{"text":"crabmeat was slimy and they no longer have FIREGRILLED flavor ,and my crabdaddy was missing the king crab"}
{"text":"I had a BLAST! Great food, great drinks and even better service! We were seated without a wait which was perfect (on Valentine's Day). My server Katie was awesome. I'm from the east coast so I'm familiar with all things seafood but my partner wasn't. She helped him with his food selection and also gave him tips and pointers on how to crack open a lobster, crab claws and peel shrimp. Katie was the best! We had a great time. Definitely planning another trip here soon."}
{"text":"Hubby and I go there probably twice a month.We live in El Mirage so it's quite a drive. But today he took me and our 2 adult daughters there for my birthday.  The food is always great, as is the service. Today however my king crab (which I get every time)  was a little salty so I sent it back. The manager ( Grace ) came to apologize and proceeded to completely shock us w/ some excellent customer service skills. I did'nt think management like this existed anymore. We will definitely be going again and again. It's really nice to know that the place you patronize appreciates your business. Marriah, was our servers name and she was also very nice. By the way , neither of them knew it was my birthday which made what they did even nicer. Will definitely keep going there and would also recommend."}
{"text":"Had a large crowd of 1967-1972 McClintock High School alumni getting together the end of June, 2016.  The staff accommodated our need which was not an easy job.  They kept the drinks, appetizers and dinners coming all night.  We missed our waitress, Judy, who has in the past done a remarkable job.  Hope we can get her again in December.  Thanks to all the waiters who served us."}
{"text":"The manager Amber was really nice and irrationally talked to us and every other table. The service was fabulous as well. I had the sampler platter, the east coast platter and had the shark bite + pineapple piña colada. Food and drinks were all amazing but I was really impressed with the fabulous service definitely a fun place to go for dinner."}
{"text":"We had such great service from our server Adrian, he was so helpful and knew the menu! The food is always fresh. The manager was great, he came by to check on us and made us feel that our business was appreciated. Great staff & Great food! We'll definitely be back, we've never had a bad experience at this location!"}
{"text":"I was shocked to see that the crab bucket for two was so large and seemed like it would feed an army, but I was even more shocked by the fact that the shrimp served in the bucket were not deveined, deshelled, and hardly cooked.   The waitress was hardly attentive and didn't keep our drinks topped off or ask if there was anything we needed. Dishes continued to be filled up with the empty crab legs and she did nothing, even when we waived our hands to get her attention.   Outside the place, they do have a kids playground, but I wouldn't recommend taking your kids here. Better take them to Chuckie Cheese instead. The strobe light at Joe's is annoying enough for the adults, but didn't seem to work well for the babies at the next tables either.   Save your time and money and avoid this place! If you're looking for seafood, go to The Salt Cellar. At least there, you'll get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Service has always been very good to excellent here. Everyone shows some enthusiasm and the mood is upbeat here. Sometimes a manager will make their rounds asking each table how everything is.   The crab quality can be a hit-or-miss at times, but it's probably more dependent on the season than anything else. Decent menu selection with plenty of options for those who aren't in a seafood mood. Great for groups or for a casual night out."}
{"text":"How to begin this review - I'm at a loss.  My expectations of these national chains of family restaurants must be too high, because I am consistently disappointed with them.  Joe's Crab Shack is no exception.  My grandson picks Joe's every year for his birthday dinner.  I think it's partly because he walks out of there every year with a handful of plastic sharks, and partly because of the playground.  Whatever the reason, he loves the place and because of that, JCS gets 2 stars instead of one.   The service is mediocre at best, the food is edible but flavorless, and the decor looks like it's all been picked out from yard sales.  On this occasion, we waited more than 45 minutes for our food (for a party of 7, that's an excessive amount of time).  One side salad had croutons, two others did not even though they were identical salads.  My daughter in law ordered her meal with the sauce on the side, but it came drenched in the gooey liquid.  When the waitress was told, all we got was a \"sorry.\"  The entree should have been removed from the bill.  I had the Crispy Jumbo Shrimp, and they were anything but crispy or jumbo.  They tasted soggy and bland - fortunately, the cocktail sauce served with them completely muted the flavorless dish.  We also ordered the s'mores dessert, which was pretty tasty.  Bottom line: highly overpriced, marginal quality food, and substandard service.  Go somewhere else - you'll be glad that you did."}
{"text":"We were greeted and seated very quickly. I immediately put in an order for my children and drinks. Manager came out and told us kids food was accidentally burned and would make sure to give us some freebies (basket of fries) which I had to remind them about once the food came out. I did enjoyed my fish and chips. Hubby ordered a Steampot and almost everything was over cooked. Service could have been better I had to ask for almost everything... refills, to-go boxes, check etc our waiter just wasn't around checking if we needed anything and it wasn't even busy (Wednesday night)"}
{"text":"I have been to his place twice thus far and excited to go back! Seated quickly, good food,  and nice atmosphere for the family. I also got to have my picture put on website,  totally think that this place was friendly and had good customer service! keep Rockin on Joe's Crabshack!"}
{"text":"Look at all those happy coconut encrusted shrimp just waiting to be inhaled!!  This place was way better than expected! Service was slow, but thats cause they had two HUGE parties inside and one on the deck so I can totally understand. Our server Jessica was apologetic and stayed on her game through the whole meal, remembering everything and delivering it in a timely manner. What I liked best about this place was the playground for Lucy. Thats such a HUGE perk. When your a parent you wonder why the heck dont ALL chain restaurants do this?! lol check it, for just $12 bux I got twice as much plump and juicy coconut shrimp than you woulda got any where else. Stina had the steak and it was delicous. The foods a little lacking on presentation and the sides were a bit boring. Overall though the main course is amazing enough to make up for whatever is lacking in the foods that flank it. Kids under ten get a free drink to! Totally happy and trying the crab next time!!"}
{"text":"Here's the deal.  This place is kind of cheesy, but I was limited in options for dinner, and skeptical about going in.  I'm glad - sort of - that I did.  The place was packed, so that was a good sign, and it seems that regulars really do like when the staff leads the customers in song.  Weird.  I didn't have crab, but I was pleasantly surprised by the salmon with dirty rice.  The salmon was cooked perfectly, again I was surprised. I don't know why I expected so little from Joe's but I enjoyed myself there. And enjoyed the restaurant's selection of beer.  Sam's Summer Ale in Reno?  I'll take it.  One strange moment: I was sitting at the bar enjoying my dinner and a mother, presumably, ordered her infant fruit juice in a sippy cup.  She ordered herself a \"Category 5 Hurricane\".  Read the drink menu here: http://bit.ly/JmHDty.  I guess I now understand why I was so skeptical at first."}
{"text":"Great service. Matt did a great job. We have had him before and Matt continues to be wonderful. Restaurant is nice for young kids with the playland and beach, enclosed area. Kids love it. Food is good, everybody is full. My favorite is the chipotle bacon burger. Not seafood. I know. But that's me. I like burgers."}
{"text":"A good cheap fried fish joint. Steamed Mussels are great too!  Staff is kind of \"not there for you\", but it is a corporate chain so I imagine low paid manager/babysitters and everyone is just concerned with going through the motions of their \"Points of Service\" so the Corporate Overseers don't have that talk with you about your \"Flair\"  Fried Fish Platters are the way to go, they tend to fail at the harder cooking techniques"}
{"text":"It's a crab shack. Good crab, a little on the salty side. Good prices for the amount you get. It's a little dirty due to the nature of eating and cracking crab legs, but it's goes with the ambiance. Fast service. Recommend. Wednesday's are all you can eat FYI"}
{"text":"The food and the service at this \"restaurant\" are equally terrible.  The last time I was there, which will BE the last time I ever go there, we waited 10 minutes to order drinks.  We waited even longer to GET our drinks.  This didn't even include ordering food, much less GETTING it.  The waiters/waitresses were always hanging out by the bar, laughing it up and completely ignoring their customers.   The food is very bland.  The crab legs tasted like they had been sitting in a freezer for a while.  Poor service, terrible food, don't waste your time or money going to this one!"}
{"text":"Helpful customer service.  The crab was very delicious. Each crab leg had a lot of meat on it. The potatoes that came with the steam pot were very soft. The seasoning used on the crab made the crab taste even better.   Very satisfied  customer!"}
{"text":"This location used to be good. Joe's in Pittsburgh recently changed to a no-tipping policy, paying all of their servers a hourly rate. Bad idea, they don't want to put in the extra effort. Our waiter took our order and disappeared, someone else brought our meal. I had to go to the bar to get a refill on my drink.   I ordered the Arctic Bay Steampot. If you've been to Joe's before you know that these steampots come with your shellfish in net bags. Both of the bags in my pot were opened, I had 1 snow crab leg and 2 shrimp in one bag. The other bag with the lobster was another story. A whole lobster but the only meat in the lobster was in the claws, there was no meat in the rest of the lobster at all, not even the tail. It looked like someone else dug into this pot before I did. I complained to the manager and got a new lobster for my efforts but no crab or shrimp.  My guest ordered the King Crab bucket. Again, it looked like her food was picked over as well. 2 of her crab legs were cracked and had no meat in them. Another complaint to the manager. However with this we received no compensation and just a \"That happens some times\".  So after we finished what turned out to be half of the food that we ordered we waited 20 minutes to look for someone to get our bill. Finally the manager returned with the full bill, no apologies, no credits, not even a coupon for the next visit. I expressed to the manager our dissatisfaction with the meal and service only to receive a reply of \"I'm sorry to hear that\" as she was walking away from us.  Needless to say we will not be returning.  This was the worst restaurant experience that I've had in several years."}
{"text":"We were seated quickly and got a bug-free breezy, table outside. We looked over the menu and waited for a server. There were lots passing by in their brightly colored tie dyes! My husband was able to flip flop on his dinner decision 6 times while waiting for someone to stop. After 15 minutes we left. No one stopped. Maybe next time, Joe."}
{"text":"This place used to be good, the last 3 times have just been All Bad.  IF they even have the menu item you order the portions are so mediocre its SO not worth the money.  Its sad Joe's used to be our favorite date spot but after this last experience this past weekend we've both decided that would be our last time going there. We actually almost canceled our order and left but thought to just stick it out at the end the meal lacked luster and well the experience was disappointing. $68 later for two people and inly one of us got a steam pot, we could've enjoyed a better meal up the street at Red Lobster or even the Olive Garden."}
{"text":"Nigga! This place is super flame! Pretty pricy but it does pay off in the long run. Everything is deliciously! The Ragin' Cajun tho is my favorite! Check it out!"}
{"text":"Came here on a date with my boyfriend and our waiter, i think his name was Jose, flirted with me the whole time. I was obviously uncomfortable and so was my boyfriend. The food was not good, and i'd like to be able to sit down for a meal with my significant other without some creep hitting on me the whole time! I guess i'd say don't come here for a date unless you want to be pestered with advances and eat crappy overpriced food."}
{"text":"First time with my wife on our 3 yr wedding anniversary!  We're from Seattle where we can have fresh seafood all the time so even tho it's not fresh per say we still had a blast!  Come see ya self!"}
{"text":"We have been to Joe's several times and have never been disappointed.  The food is very good ~ the steamer pots offer lots of good food, cooked perfectly healthly.  Each time we have had very nice, friendly and efficient waitresses.  We like Joe's ~ it's a little pricey ~ but the portions are huge.  Blessings : ) KC"}
{"text":"Joe's Crap Shack is a more accurate name for this overpriced, tasteless restaurant.   I'm not sure what we were thinking when we decided to eat lunch here yesterday. One of my dining companions was lured by the word \"crab\" and a stomach twisting hunger, so we stopped in. Everything on the menu sounded good in theory, but it didn't pan out so well in practice.   For $9.95, I expected the crab cake sandwich to be almost a work of art- succulent crab, perfectly spiced and neatly fried. Instead, the sandwich was a lukewarm lump, devoid of flavor, unless you count the lingering aftertaste of old fish. The remoulade sauce served with the sandwich was tasty with fries, but it did nothing to save the sandwich from the pits of nastiness. The crunchy fish sandwich is usually served with cheese. I asked for mine without, but regretted it immediately. The fish fillets were the blandest I have ever had, and the cheese probably provides the only flavor this sandwich has. Honestly, i've had better fish fillets from the frozen section of the grocery store. Another thing to dislike about the crunchy fish sandwich is the fact that they didn't serve tartar sauce or any other condiment with it. Who has a dry fish sandwich? Blech.  The blackened tuna sandwich looked promising when it arrived at the table, with  inch thick slab of tuna steak sitting atop the bun. One bite shattered that notion. The fish was dry and overcooked, while the blackening spice seemed to be more likely ground up charcoal. No taste.   The one redeeming aspect to our lunch was the crab dip. That was really tasty, but I doubt if i'd return for just that.   Skip Joe's Crap Shack if you're in the mood for ocean critters. I wish we had. I felt dirty and cheap after paying our $46 lunch bill and walked out of the place very unsatisfied, and a little pissed."}
{"text":"My family attended Joe's as a party of four. First thing to notice is that inside the restaurant it is terribly noisy, not some place you'd want to go if you wanted to actually talk to your fellow diner. However this does perpetuate the party attitude the restaurant holds. We started off with an order if calamari. The calamari was quite good with a generous portion for an appetizer. After our appetizer however we had to wait over 25 minutes for two orders of fish and chips, an order of garlic mussels, chicken club sandwich and a bowl of clam chowder. After finally getting the majority of food, our waiter had forgotten about our order of clam chowder.  As for the food itself, the fish and chips were surprisingly good. The pieces of fish were large in size and more than enough to fill a person up. The only downside is that they were a bit too salty. Everything was a bit too salty. The clam chowder (once we got it), the fish and chips, and the mussels were all too salty. The club sandwich was great.   If I were to rate just the food, Joe's would receive a 3 out of 5 but their service drops it down to a 2. We had long waits for our appetizer and our entrees. Our waiter hardly came around to check up on us. Our glasses were empty a majority of the time  because of this.   Joe's Crab Shack has alright food with mediocre service."}
{"text":"We had a larger party (10) that we had a reservation for. Once we arrived, we still had to wait for a half hour. Once seated and ordered, we didn't get our food for another 45 min. I was told from the people in my party that ordered the pot meals that they had no flavor. I ordered a steak entrée, medium. It came out like leather and tiny. My girl ordered an ahi meal. It was even smaller. We will never return."}
{"text":"So this place use to be great . Lots of people amazing food and great customer service . However that has all changed . There was one. Table in here around dinner time , they got rid of most of the steamer buckets , and it seems like they raised the price on the only two that don't give you clams or mussels , but that's not the biggest thing . We have been coming here for four years , my wife has gotten the same thing every time the east coast platter sub fish for extra stuffed shrimp . It has never been an issue , and the willingness to accommodate has always made this location shine . But when we asked our waitress tonight , a look of panic came across her face and she said o I have to go ask my manager , we got a new gm and he doesn't like that . At this point we didn't even tell her what we wanted to sub the fish out for , she just came back and said you can only get fried shrimp , that's what the gm said. We asked for the stuff shrimp she just said no and walked away . We canceled out orders and went to famous daves next door , lots of people , and great food"}
{"text":"$50 later & I've got that sinking feeling again... This was an awful meal. I ordered some grilled shrimp plate w/ broccoli & corn. The broccoli was cold mush, the corn was just cold. My shrimp was cold as well & smeared with a disgusting \"mango pico de gallo\" they called it. I, however, tasted nothing you could decipher as mango. My husband's dinner was just as disappointing. Crispy panko chicken should be CRISP & not smeared with cheese sauce. I don't understand their menu, I don't agree with their flavors, simple as that. Save your money."}
{"text":"Had a craving for crab and knew of Joes Crab Shack.  After reading the reviews there were not too many people that wanted to go with me due to the service reviews in Yelp.  Regardless I talked them into going after all.  The reviews warned about the service being slow.  As we were getting seated I noticed at least four large groups doing birthday parties and that the rest of the place was pretty full.  I also noticed a lot of tables did not have food yet.  I was thinking to myself, service will be slow.  We were barely in our seats when our waitress Ashlee came by to check in on us.  She was very pleasant and helpful.  We had drinks and apps in no time.  She constantly came by to check on us.  I am a big water drinker and she never made me wait for refills.  Despite the other large groups in the restaurant she never made us wait.  Dinner was delivered on time, hot and delicious.  Ashlee was on top of her game and we would gladly recommend this place to all.  I will be back next time in Vegas. Thanks Ashlee and staff."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was nice but our waitress was very poor. Our food was not fresh, it tasted like it was prepackaged, and the portions were small. Furthermore you could tell it had sat under a heat lamp because the shrimp was rubbery and the fried fish was mushy. There is no chance I will ever return it was an overall very bad experience."}
{"text":"I want to eat here everyday! Management has definitely made the experience a lot better! Snow Crab BBQ style!!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome place. We drove up and first our teenagers were excited about was the playground. Cassie, the manager was awesome. We had a little defect on one crab leg. It was missing its meat. Cassie handle it very well and quickly. Our server, Jamie was wonderful and very attentive. Thank you Joe's Crab Shack for making our first visit fun and we will be back again and again."}
{"text":"I never really liked this place. Every time I dined here I always had a bad meal. Not worth the money. The seafood dishes are bad and the meat dishes are even worse. I think Red Lobster is better, not by much. Save your money and do not even come here."}
{"text":"We just had lunch at Joes Crab Shack.  What a waste.  The clam chowder is mostly diced potatoes.   It was not served HOT.   The Cesar salad dressing had so much vinegar my wife could not eat it.  The King Crab was Not king crab but something else bland and tasteless and cold.   I asked the waiter if the shrimp were deveined and he had no idea what I was talking about.  The same waiter told me the crab we ordered came with two russet potatoes.  They were COLD RED Potatoes.  It was terrible and cost $50.00.   We had to stop on the way home to get something to eat"}
{"text":"Nice alternative to Red Lobster.  The staff is always friendly and their customer service is spot on. I liked the fact the Manager took the time to stop by, introduce himself, and asked how everything was going. The decor reminds me of being at a seafood shack on the coast, a nice escape from this desert. The food was excellent."}
{"text":"Awesome place to enjoy some seafood and great service as well. Our waiter Taylor send it to our every need and was very nice. We didn't have to wait or call for reservation on top of that restaurant was clean as well. I couldn't finish my play because it was so good that I was already full. I would definitely come back here for round two and so on."}
{"text":"My wife is a picky eater. I guess we were not specific when ordering her crab. She said it was just ok, not great. She sad she likes the crab at Red Lobster better. I ordered the coconut shrimp. It was good, however, I've had better at Red Lobster & Rib & Chop House. The key lime pie was to die for! I would come back just for the key lime pie. Be forewarned, one serving of the key lime pie is really big. After a big dinner, it was a good size for sharing."}
{"text":"The (Crab Shack) restaurant is so very good....hot, fresh & just great - we love the crab legs here, and the seafood buckets.....have a cold beer and a bucket of crab, it don't get any better than that.....love it."}
{"text":"Broil shrimp Cajon style was very good lot's of it with corn and potatoes and sausage  delicious with mild sauce"}
{"text":"With a bigger crowd service is always a challenge but the young lady did ok. Mama of course got cold food but they recooked it. My shrimp stuffed with lobster had no lobster but the shrimp was good. Little tiny cup of cole slaw - so good thing i got a lot of potato chips. Highlight of dinner was mama's red velvet cake."}
{"text":"This place is a great quality food fast service i would recommend to all my friends and family."}
{"text":"good seafood.  the huge buckets have plenty of food to fill you up.  the apple desert is to die for."}
{"text":"This was a horrible experience from beginning to end. We went at lunch and it was almost empty, which is when we should have walked back out, but we didn't.  First, instead of proper napkins they have rolls of brown paper towels like you find in a bathroom on the table. The roll was completely saturated with greasy fingerprints. Disgusting. Whoever thought that was a smart idea should be fired. Talk about unsanitary. But, it gets worse from there.  We sat there for a good five minutes before the waiter finally showed up to take our drink order, and then it was another 10 minutes before be brought out the drinks and took our order. Recall, if you will, the place was almost empty.  Now, to the food. I ordered a platter that included a crab cake, fried fish, onion strings, french fries and bacon wrapped shrimp. The crab cake was cold in the middle. The fried fish and onion rings tasted like old grease. There was almost no fish inside the greasy batter. The bacon wrapped shrimp had so much cheese in it that it was just a greasy ball of cheese. The only thing that was good was the french fries.  I hardly ate anything on the plate. Then the waiter came out to bring out drinks and his hand was bleeding. I had to point out that he got blood all over the salt shaker.  It was just an overall bad experience. The only reason I have 2 stars instead of one was because the manager could tell we were unhappy and came out to talk to us. They took care of the bill, which we did appreciate.  I don't know if all Joe's Crab Shacks are like this, but I don't intend to find out. First and last time."}
{"text":"I have always loved joes crab shack but this location is top of the line. Food is always great. service is usually on par. This location succeed in both categories. My review has more to do with the friendlyness (is that even a word) of the staff. I sat at the bar as it was just myself and wanted to watch the rest of the penguins game. I just moved to Pittsburgh and am currently staying in a near by hotel while finding a place to live. The bartender introduced herself as Paige and asked for my name and used it all night. Made you feel apart of the experience. As I was the only one at the bar, in between her attending to her tables, we chatted about the area, where to live, places to see, etc. Other waitresses got involved and were all just as helpful. Pretty soon the banter turned to all around convo and the night flew by. The customer interaction I encountered will have me back more and more. Excellent. Even if the food sucks, which is few and far between, the staff is more than a good reason to keep coming back."}
{"text":"Wife and I went there last week for lunch.  Ordered the Classic Bucket for two.  Our waiter was Derek who was great - friendly,  helpful and attentive. When the food arrived and we started - major letdown.  Since we had the double order, we asked for one King and one 'Queen'.  Couldn't tell the difference,  both were the same and were too small for what was called 'King'.  We eat crab quite often, so are not unfamiliar with good crab. The crab had been frozen too long - the shells were soft; meat was shrunk and taste was bland.  Same thing with the corn.  Too bad - portions were good but overall quality a big disappointment.   Too many other good crab places within  Las Vegas area for your dollars.  Last year we went to a Joe's Crab Shack in Laughlin Golden Nugget where everything was much better quality.  We won't be back at this Rainbow location."}
{"text":"I love this place been here three times and the food is always fresh and reasonable priced for a seafood place. About $25-$30 a stem pot, depending on what you order, you get a half to whole crab in your pot, plenty of shrimp, a few clams, a sausage, and corn. They give a shellcracker to take home, I dropped mine and they brought me a new one and I took both home. The place has great decor makes you feel like you're at a lake or the seaside. I love the Cajun steampot is my favorite."}
{"text":"Super yummy and tasty can't believe it! First time of many. Ask for matt super great server"}
{"text":"In town from southern california. Sat in bar area at table top for at least 10 minutes before anyone acknowledged me. Ordered my beer and food. Came out quickly thanks to nice young brunette girl. Finished food and beer with no follow up whatsoever. Food was average. Original server FINALLY came over to check on me after sitting for at least 20 minutes. Asked for check and that was the quickest service of the night. Seem like good kids working there just no leadership. Needless to say their tip was minimal."}
{"text":"I've been there before and it wasn't great but.. I will not be going back it is expensive and disgusting.  I got the platter with fried shrimp, fish and scallops, the scallops were small and didn't taste fresh and the coating was just falling off.  The fish was whitefish or something as cheap and 2 very small pieces a little dry, the shrimp were barely ok and a little peppery like the very small paper cup of cole slaw.  Fries were not hot and also kind of dry.  Tartar sauce has pieces of what seemed like blue cheese and the kids ranch was watered down. I thought red lobster was expensive with very little food but this is much worse and at least at RL you get good cheesy buns.  A total waste of money."}
{"text":"We went to Joe's Crab Shack On East Sunset Road in Henderson NV tonight and had one of the worst dining experiences. Our server was named Nashima. She wrote her name on a paper towel and told us to wave her down if we needed anything. We order cocktails, had a view of the bar area from our booth and there were less than a hand full of people at the bar. 10 minutes later server said our drinks should be up soon, and she took our order. Watched the bartender put up a few drinks at the pickup station, and 5 minutes later, server brought over those drinks. Our food was served to us, but eating utensils were not setup on the table. Server brought over forks, no knifes, just forks. We had taken only a bite of food when asked if everything was okay. Food was good. Never saw her again on the floor. Our empty plates were in front of us for about 10 minutes when she came over to ask about desert, we passed, and asked for the check. The check was NOT our check. Server had also given the check to the booth not far from, we got her attention and told her about the check. Server swapped checks with other booth, reviewed check, still not ours. We requested to see the manager, and we received the correct check. The other booth had also received the wrong check. We left a 10% tip, and will not be going back to this establishment again."}
{"text":"Crab was seasoned well with Old Bay.  Moderately overpriced due to the very small portions of sides."}
{"text":"Went here this past Monday night for dinner. It was very quiet. I ordered the crab cake sandwich, and honestly it tasted pretty good, but oh god. Later that night (about 2:30am) I woke up in the worst pain I've ever experienced. I then proceeded to have terrible, explosive diarrhea, for the rest of the day. I had to call off work. My friend who went with me reported a similar experience. I can only imagine the state that the kitchen was in... It takes a lot to make someone that sick. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Great food , great atmosphere and great service from our server, Matt. We will definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"Love how the restaurant always clean. The staffs nice. The Tuesday  $2 drinks /promotions are great!"}
{"text":"Our entire experience was terrible, from the DEAFENING music to the limp, pale french fries.  Of my fish & chips, the chips were inedible, the fish frozen and mushy, the batter thick.  Malt vinegar helped the fish, but the fries were baaadd.  This is a place better suited for a family with loud, messy kids, or a large group of rowdies.  Our bill was $80 for 3 people, 1 cocktail, 1 beer, 1 iced tea, 1 salad, 3 entrees.  Our guest wanted to go there, it's a first and last time for us.  John V. was right.  Adult Chuck E Cheese about covers it."}
{"text":"The service was good but unfortunately the food really upset my stomach (the crab). This was not my first time here and I've never had an issue before but this time around it's bad.  Not only that but when I asked for a beer it took 20 minutes for the bar to say they were all out. So when I asked for another beer it was an additional 10 for them to tell me they were out of that too. Finally I settled for what was in special.  The waitress was really nice hence the 3 stars but after these bubble guts I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Went there for Brunch, will go back for life    I'm from the East Coast and after 20 years of Upscale restaurant work I know good when I see it. Joes Crab Shack was a pleasant surprise. We ordered steak, crab, shrimp...a wide selection of the menu and were stunned by how good everything was. This included our waitress \"Amy\" who was so bright and attentive my wife asked: \"Are you always this cheerful \"?   I am used to seafood in Arizona being overcooked, over seasoned \"or something\". This was not. Everything was great. The notable exception was the malt vinegar at our table ( which had turned). Hence four stars instead of five.   The portions were also impressive. They have made a fan for life."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to a Joe's in a while since North Carolina and decided to try this one. While the atmosphere was good and our server was attentive, the food was lackluster for the price and we had a issue with our final charge (after we left).  Regarding the food, the amount of seafood you get for the price of a stream pot is very small, there were more potatoes than anything else with a very small loster tail, 3 shrimp and two small crab legs that even for a chain restaurant there should be more quantity to justify the price. The second entree of a crab cake sandwich was more breading in the cake that it seemed like a bread patty on a bun. The more serious issue was regarding our bill. Our check was $60 and we left a $11 tip in cash, but when my bf checked his bank statement that night he noticed that his card was charged $72! He called and told the manager that the charge wasn't correct and we left a cash tip so why was $12 added to his bill. After some sort of excuse that their pos system puts an automatic tip on that gets corrected at the end of the night ( which I know it's not how it's done) he was told it would be corrected. The charge was corrected the next day, however if he hadn't caught it who knows. I work in food and beverage and know that systems don't work like that and it happens when the server edits their tips. Either way, I don't like the idea that either knowingly or not that extra money was charged when cash was given. Seems sketchy to me and unfortunately I won't be back."}
{"text":"As usual, Joe's Crab Shack disappoints.  I either get a bad meal or you way too little food for the money.  My advice - look for a real seafood place."}
{"text":"Manager Casey is super rude and condescending. We are regulars and were going to book a big party here but forget it now. Never coming back."}
{"text":"Spectacular seafood!! The food is great- lots of flavor and lots to choose from.  Prices are not cheap; most items are over around $15 and up.  Fun decor in the dining room- although it is a little dark. The service was ok- it was slow and I had to order the same things over and over again... Maybe that was because they were short staffed. Anyway, I'm definitely gonna start comming here more often because the food makes my tastbuds sing!"}
{"text":"We just left the place!!! It's ridiculous! We had to wait for almost 15mins to have a service! They gave us a free appetizer with a hair!!!! And they give me a cold england clam chowder soup! Wouldn't recommend this place at all! Service sucks!!!!"}
{"text":"We've stopped in a couple of times over the last couple months while running errands in the area.  Each time, we've grabbed a seat at the bar.  The bartender was great (we had the same one both times).  She was attentive, courteous, fun, and always had a smile on her face. The crablegs are delicious, the coconut shrimp is excellent, and we really loved the lobster bisque.  We love the relaxed, fun atmosphere the restaurant provides. Donny, the manager, was also wonderful and his upbeat personalty made the whole experience a great one!  We look forward to heading back soon!"}
{"text":"I liked Joe's Crab shack; the waitstaff were always friendly to us and made sure the food was good and the drinks flowed.  I thought the crab was delicious and plenty of it.  The crab pots are fun and full of good non crab food as well."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, friendly staff. I was torn between crab and tacos and the waitress asked the chef to make me crab tacos. They were amazing!"}
{"text":"I went there with my husband my son and my daughter-in-law we've gone there on several occasions and each time the food is absolutely fabulous we always ask for the server by the name of Gera. I think that is how you spell her name she is always very very professional very accommodating our food is always correct we always enjoy our dining experience there especially because of her. We just went there a couple of days ago my husband and I went to the manager Adam to let him know what a great job she does. In spending a few minutes talking with him we quickly realized what a wonderful manager he is as well thank you Joe's Crab Shack for hiring great staff and a great manager the food is great but Gera is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Kayla was the AMAZING! She is such is such a sweetheart. Great food and experience. Will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"The food is so so and  don't believe the menu that is posted on Yelp there are many dishes listed that they no longer have very disappointing!!!!!"}
{"text":"First time having the crab! It was good. I enjoyed the snow crab legs! The waitress amber was very sweet!"}
{"text":"You get huge portions for the price you're paying. I recommend their steampots 100%! They could have been seasoned a little better but amazing nonetheless if you're looking to fill a seafood craving.   Appetizers are delicious as well. Stuffed mushrooms were nice and cheesey, Jack Daniel's sampler was full of crispy, flavorful options and a delicious dip. Drinks are bottomless to wash down all the heavy stuff you'll be eating.   Service was phenomenal! Waiter was very attentive to us and talked story for a while during our meal and when we were waiting for our check. Manager came out and thanked us for dining at Joe's too. They are doing something right and keeping customers happy!"}
{"text":"The service here is great and most everything we had was super tasty. However, I ordered soup and it tasted like it had gone bad. I never send food back, but I couldn't eat it and it smelled moldy. I've only ever been to one other Joe's Crab Shack before and the crab was chewy, very overcooked. I won't be going back. I have to be able to eat the food the fantastic wait staff brings to my table."}
{"text":"Well, for average seafood this is your place!  Being from the west coast we've been spoiled... But the service was great and we had fun!"}
{"text":"They claim to close at 12 but the managers close the grill down early to get out. So if you arrive after 11pm you will be asked to leave. I spoke to the general manager but I don't think he is aware of what is going on the night shift !!!! The managers don't care about profit or taking care of the guest needs... They should post 11pm as the closing hour this way the cooks and the managers can get out early. I would be afraid to eat there after 11 if they served me ....I would wonder how it would be prepared due to interrupting there closing down the equipment. Good luck to anyone that dare goes there after 11pm...Try Shucks they have great seafood and great guest service..They have specials and the hours posted are real hours...I would not recommend eating at Joes Crab Shack !!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"the clam strips are good, but make sure you ask for fresh french fries. mine taste old ."}
{"text":"Group came into be served. We walked in at 6:45 and it's now 9:12 and we just...JUST ate. Several of the orders were incorrect and the servers began to get upset that we were upset. I will NEVER ever come back here nor will I ever recommend it. I've been to many Joe's Crab shacks and I've never had such a horrific experience. The suggested gratuity is a joke...they'll get half."}
{"text":"Food is good and we did not have to wait.  We had southern bacon wrapped shrimp. And ckams.  Very good!  dessert is divine! We had the apple cobbler with ice cream. Service was good"}
{"text":"Imagine your birthday with a Campfire S'Mores!! But it only tastes like a wonder.  Most try dishes, 1) Crab Cake sandwich    or Crab Cake Dinner 2) GREAT BALLS OF FIRE 3) Appetizer sampler  And if you are a true foodie, I dare you to go for their bucket crabs!"}
{"text":"This was our first time to eat at Joe's Crab Shack. Our server (Lala) was excellent and knew her menu fairly well. Considering we had a rather large party, our bill was pretty reasonable."}
{"text":"This is a fun place, a little loud but that's the ambience they're shooting for. The food was actually very good and the portions were generous. A plus for me is a dedicated gluten free menu. The salmon was great and I'm told by others in my party, the fish and chips were good also. I tried crawfish for the first time, they actually had experts who come to the table to explain and demonstrate how to remove the meat from the little buggers. The meat had a nice flavor but I left the head sucking for someone else. All in all a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"It was okay don't like the high prices and I didn't even get a lobster bucket. The people were really nice I just didn't like the manger. Also the alcohols drinks are not that good it's more fruits juice then alcohol. I rather go to boiling crab any day . Sorry"}
{"text":"Excellent customer service from Manager Adrienne Sanford. Had dinner there yesterday, waited an hour due to short staffing. The manager apologized and gave us the meal on the house, BEFORE we could even complain about the wait. As for the food, I have had their King, Dungeness, Snow, and Queen crab, but that's all I'm interested in eating there. I read some reviews here of people getting sick... I have never had any problems with what I've ordered there. I will return!"}
{"text":"My family and I had a horrible dining expierence on 12/09/12. It was $122 for dinner for 2 adults and 2 children, which included one adult beverage for $10.  We all ended up sick later in the night.  My wife ordered a steak medium.  It arrived barely cooked.  We sent it back, it returned in about the same condition.  I had the cajun seafood pot.  The shrimp and crab were both very dry and rubbery.  The sausage was very greasy and the potatoes and corn were way overdone.  We ate our food and went on our way.  Our son was the first one ill around 11pm that night. My wife, daughter and myself soon followed.  I would've been fine just leaving never to return to this restaurant, but the poor quality of the food, and the level of illness we expierenced, was overwhelming.  The following day I contacted the restaurant.  The manager said all he could do was offer some discount coupons or make a report and have the corporate office do an internal investigation.  We are never going back, so discount coupons were not an option.  I asked for the corporate investigation.  After a week I received a call from the corporate office after they had done their investigation. There were no problems found, no issues to report.  They couldn't explain why we all were sick.  I can only speculate, but does anybody really think there will be anything found when a company does a \"self-audit\", a week after the incident?  We weren't looking for a free meal, or a refund, or even legal action.  I wanted them to be aware that they charge way too much for horrible food.  We've eaten at Joe's a bunch of times in other states.  We never had a bad meal there.  But this is definitely one Joe's that you want to stay away from."}
{"text":"I have always liked Joe's Crab Shack. They have a great happy hour from 4-7pm half off all appetizers and great drink specials."}
{"text":"Went for happy hour, 2 of us...ordered mussles, calamari, stuffed mushrooms, crab dip, bucket of shrimp, dessert, and two soft drinks for $44. And we couldn't even finish it all. Service was great and everything was delicious! Would def be back!"}
{"text":"I went here and it was unusually chilly for AZ today. I sat outside with 2 other couples, and looked inside at 10:58am and the place was dark, with no employees in site. Across the street, Claim Jumper-- with the same hours- was letting people in and fully set up. So much more professional. So I went across the street."}
{"text":"Clean, friendly family place that sounded like a great idea but was not what I expected. The waitress was obviously new but that didn't bother us that much except she got our drinks wrong. I think it might of been what we ordered but when we opened the lid it was cold, and had way too much flavoring. However, the part that didn't suck was that we got $11 off our appetizers from an email coupon. We're not really planning to go back based on our visit."}
{"text":"I remember eating here after my cousin's wedding and I kept wondering where they got the fish from. It's Las Vegas, the desert, with no ocean or river currents flowing in or out of the area. Where do Las Vegas restaurants get their fish anyways? To make it better it was my first time going to a Joe's Crab Shack, it was good and the fish tasted awesome."}
{"text":"We stopped by for lunch on Sunday. The parking lot was packed with an old car show that benefited cancer research. We sat on the patio where the people watching and music was good. First off the server(Ashley) was great. We had the Seafood Fun-Do. It tasted better then it looked. We had really good long island iced teas (made with tea not coke, ask for it that way) which enhanced the whole experience. Then we split the original steam pot. Everything in it was good with the exception of the shrimp. They were not cleaned. I just don't like cleaning my shrimp at the table or biting into shrimp poo. The bibs were very handy in saving a trip to the dry cleaners. The food is messy and unpretentious. The napkins are a roll of brown paper towels. The atmosphere was good with the car show going on. I don't know how often I would come here but it was nice to sit outside and chow on some seafood."}
{"text":"Their crab and shrimp is good. I like to get the crab with spicy boil. Prices are reasonable. Service seems consistently solid."}
{"text":"Came in a month ago with my wife and jesus was our server.  Excellent waiter, recommended a classic sampler, not a fan of calamari but he was able to sub it out for mozzarella sticks.  Balls of fire were amazing!   After looking and looking we weren't sure what to get we wanted a combination of crab legs and lobster  He suggested an artic for 2 it wasn't on the menu but he said we would save $10  Great food. Great service Will come back to be served by him!!!"}
{"text":"Yay!  I'm a fan!  The rating says it all.  I love seafood, so maybe I'm bias.  I'll say right off the bat, that the seafood isn't the BEST I've ever had (easy, Drake), but for what it is this place is pretty awesome.  I had lunch here when I was in Vegas one time.  No crowd, no wait, walk right in and sit down.  First star goes to the staff.  Fun, full of energy, always on top of it, and they give you awesome bibs (haha!).  Next star goes to the restaurant.  For a bar/seafood pot restaurant, it's very clean!  The one in Henderson is fun like a sports bar mixed with a bubba gumps.  Just so many random things hung around on the walls, it's interesting.  The last two stars is for the food.  Between 3 of us, we had 2 pots and a couple appetizers.  The pots are full of flavor.  Every piece of seafood takes on whatever flavor you choose to have.  One of the pots we had was with the cajun flavor, SOOOOO GOOD!!  The other pot we had was your typical garlic butter flavor...also very good!  The apps that we ordered were the spinach dip and coconut shrimp.  Both dishes again were very tasty.  As mentioned, the seafood isn't the freshest ever, but it's still very flavorful.  When you get those pots, it's like opening a christmas present of food.  You're usually not disappointed with a christmas present.  Overall, I'd recommend Joe's Crab Shack.  If you live in Hawaii, you ALWAYS see the commercials and for the most part, those commercials are true.  Great food, great place, great price!"}
{"text":"This is my first time to a Crab Shack.  We arrived just before a large group, but this didn't seem to slow our service down at all.  The service was fast and the food was great.  For the price I think it's a good deal.  We had the calamari, which everyone sells but few get right.  I'm glad to say it was great."}
{"text":"No. I've always wanted to try this place. What a rip off! It's way too loud. They hafta keep stopping to announce birthdays, line dance, or whatever. I couldn't hold a conversation with my date. It was very annoying. The food is not fresh. It's shipped in and heated up. With tip and no booze, for 2 people was $100. The meal was $25 tops. I'm talking both our dishes combined. You can find 200 other places in the valley with way better seafood, and elegant setting for the price they charge. Service was fine. Fuck Joe!"}
{"text":"Went on Wednesday to find out they had an All you can eat crab leg special where you can even have each batch prepared differently. We definitely took advantage. The crabs were amazing & our server was super friendly & attentive."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Joe's Crab Shack.  What a disappointment!  First our food took over 30 minutes to get to our table.  I asked for A-1 steak sauce at the time I ordered then again when our food arrived.  Never saw it.  Matter of fact our waitress disappeared the minute our food hit the table.  Never saw my A-1 steak sauce, never got refills on our drinks, never were asked how we were doing.  We did not see our waitress named Jacque until we were done.  When we brought all this to her attention, she just stared at us.  When we asked if she could do something with our bill to make up for our bad experience, again she just stared at us.  I will certainly pass on my experience to friends and obviously will not return."}
{"text":"Been few a few times.  Never great service,  however tonight we were seated right away. ( a very slow night.  Almost empty)  We waited 20 mins.  And no one ever showed up to get our drinks.  So we got up and left.  We handed out menus back. Told them our wait.  They said sorry.  But clearly didn't care.    This is poorly managed and probably why it was slow on a Saturday night.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"Love this place now ! Has great hours so we can come have some yummy food after work. Were greeted very nice and dont have to wait long for a table. Very friendly staff and delicious food ,definitely will be back .I recommend the cajan steam pot !"}
{"text":"1 star may be too much.  I'm going to keep this short and to the facts...9 min til waiter addresses us. 17 min to get lemon for ice water...had to ask twice. 30 min, 30 to get appetizer of hush puppies. 30 min. Really??   No plates for app, no silverware. Had to get up and ask host for them. Ordered fish and shrimp and a crab daddy.   Crabs were RIDICULOUSLY hard to crack..they were so soft you had to peel it. It was not fresh at all.   Fish was suppose to be crisp and beer battered. It was mush. And the shrimp...no flavor. I killed the cocktail and tarter sauces and asked for more to choke it down.   It was a sun night around 8:45 pm with hardly any tables...service sucked. Food sucked. Was looking forward to a great seafood meal even though it's Nevada but ugh this was soooo disappointing."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a trendy seafood restaurant, Joe's Crab Shack isn't it. However, this place is great to go to if you just want to kick back, relax, and have a yummy but casual meal with friends or family. They have a great selection of beers and pretty much everything on their menu is delicious. My personal favorite is the fried shrimp or the fish and chips. Staff is always friendly and super-laid back."}
{"text":"Good place to definitely make a regular visit to.  My mother and sister from out of town were here to celebrate my sister's birthday for the week, and this was one of her picks of restaurants to dine at. She got the huge lobster steamer pot...1.5lb lobster, shrimp, sides for $30...can't go wrong!  Mom got crab cakes dinner which was good (to me).  I got crab stuffed shrimp dinner.  good choice there too! My mom didn't personally enjoy her crab cakes all that much, only ate like 25%.  The only reason I gave the 4 star instead of 5 was cuz they didn't go out of their way to offer replacement or satisfaction...but like I said, I liked the crab cakes; it was just her personal taste. The 3 of us for dinner, with a couple drinks and an appetizer came up to like $80ish."}
{"text":"Joe's Crab Shack by Arizona Mills Mall was wonderful. I went with my girlfriend and my parents to celebrate my birthday. The waitress we had was Marissa. Marissa was really sweet, kind, attentive, and updated us on the status of our order until the food came out. She checked up on us regularly throughout the night and gave us refills on our drinks throughout the evening. She was definitely a terrific waitress, that contributed to the wonderful evening. Thank you, Marissa and thank you, Joe's Crab Shack!"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at a Joe's Crab Shack.  We went for dinner at about 5:30 and it wasn't too crowded.  The service was great and our waitress was friendly and on the money.  I had the Samual Adams boil and it was great! I loved the atmosphere and casual feel of the place.  Will definitely eat there again!"}
{"text":"Joes fun shack. Ladies and gentlemen the captain recommends you wear the bib, it's gonna get messy. The truth is, I never come here expecting to find exceptionally good food. The food is good but not wow!.. good. The reason I stop at this place is because is fun, also for the service and the ambiance and to get away from the ordinary, it feels like you're far somewhere on a beach. The place can get loud, you know, party loud so if you expect to have a serious conversation this would not be the place to go to. Once in a while the waiters do some kind of dancing for entertainment around the restaurant, and there's also a guy going around making balloon animals and hats for the kids. Try to keep your birthday a secret or you will be embarrassed in front of everyone or embarrass your friends by telling the waiters that is their birthday, either way someone will get embarrassed.  We ordered the bucket of snow crab legs and the crab stuffed shrimp but before that we had the calamari rings with marinara sauce for appetizer which it was very tasty. It could get pricey if you get carried away with them crab legs but with all the entertainment going on and the fun way the place is decorated you'll feel like a kid again.... All the way down to the bib."}
{"text":"First time at Joe's crab Shack i've never ate in there before and I find it to try it out.  When we got there it was really busy but they were very nice at the front to take down our seat and waiting not a bad wait. Would I go there on a date probably not unless my day really love lobster That would be the place.  The atmosphere is very loud and busy.  They do have a playground for the kids if you have a big family. Overall I enjoyed my food it was great, the only disappointment that I have was, our service our waitress was never around to be found, we were left waiting around once we Carter, she would disappear again for a while that would be my only complaint."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time or money. Had no wine glasses after ordering a bottle of wine. Ambience is like a fast food joint. Restaurant was not even busy! Head to King's Fish House."}
{"text":"Amazing food!! The Lobster and all  of their crab selection is great. We've been here multiple times and have had great food every time. The Bar and Drink selection is all very well done and consistency of the drinks made are on point. Can be busy at times. But we always call in before arriving. Thumbs up to all waiters and waitresses."}
{"text":"I'm so sad..this WAS one of our family's favorite spots. It's gone downhill, fast. Our poor server was so sweet, but had too many tables. As a former server, I can tell the difference between lazy/incompetent and overworked/overwhelmed. She couldn't get to her tables for anything, waited 10 minutes for an initial drink order. The food used to be amazing. Used to be. The quantity was disappointing. We've spent $32.00 each and my kids left hungry (adult potions too). My hubby (who never complains) got 4 crab legs in his pot and I thought he was going to go nuclear! For $32.00? Are you crazy? She did go complain for us and got him 4 more legs. Got my usual pot delivered and I almost cried..I knew it was the last time there. We will never be back..just left sad. Had to feed my husband when we got home. After dropping $145 for 4 people! Get back to basics Joe, quality, quantity (priced accordingly) and adequate staff & you'll get some customers back. Cut out the gimmicky crap going on around us, and just feed your customers!! Keep things simple."}
{"text":"I really like Joe's Crab Shack. This place is casual fun & of course the crabs are super tastey. Love the margaritas too. They go down especially well with the crab. YAY Joes! Keep up the good crackin' crab & good times."}
{"text":"Dont usually give bad reviews so 3 star is bad, its too much everything someone has a birthday the most annoying thing happens. Staff professionalism training never happened. Food average  Not going back their again"}
{"text":"I have been to this location several times over the years and am disappointed to find that the quality of food and service is declining as well as the singing of the staff. we had to request a song in order to have the entertainment  that we were accustomed to listing to"}
{"text":"Wasn't great, wasn't bad. I avoided the lobster, I can shell shrimp but can't have my food look at me. The shrimp was good, sauce had no taste. Potato cake was neat. The guy got all you can eat crap, think he was happier than me. Real annoyence was everyone, even the manager kept hitting my booth and never said sorry, got old fast."}
{"text":"My mom and I were on a weekend trip to the Burgh, and wanted a seafood experience, so we decided to give Joe's Crab Shack a try.  We put our names in at the front door as there was about a 15 - 30 minute wait.  We walked around Station Square enjoying the fountain show and the music.  When we were seated outside, we were thrilled at the atmosphere, picnic tables, lots of elbow room, buckets of silverware and napikins, buckets for shells and crablegs.  Our waitress took our drink orders and we read over the menu.  Our drinks came back really fast, a Pina Colada for my mom, and a Sangria for me.  We both ordred Steampots of Crab!  Talk about fantastic!  I got Joes Classic, with crab, shrimp and sausage, potatoes and corn.  My mom got one with three different types of crab in it.  We laughed and ate, and laughed some more.  This was one my best restaurant experiences."}
{"text":"Food is all right. Have been a fan of steamy pots. Ordering mixed drinks might be a waste of money as they do not adjust if you want something less sweeter on the side. Servers were slow to respond even thought there were few people on a Wednesday evening and lacking any enthusiasm to be there. Will try again and hopefully they have worked out few kinks to making it a good place again."}
{"text":"The wife and I went last night to this restaurant and to our amazement were seated immediately (never a good sign.) We immediately noticed how HOT the place was and we asked the waitress about it. She told us and I quote: \"We can't lower the A/C to anything below 79 or it freezes up.\" Well let me tell you it was every bit of at least 95 degrees in there. After a few tentative looks from the wife we decided to get up and go to the OTHER Joe's on Baseline. It was much much cooler there and we had a great time. We love the crab pots and the salmon sunrise. We hate the heat and won't be coming back to the location on Southern unless they fix the A/C."}
{"text":"Today is the re-grand opening, a shaky start, but things are moving forward, lots of management presence. Place looks better staff very outgoing food is amazing!!"}
{"text":"OK I really wanted to have seafood and while it is not Spondivitz (Check it out in Atlanta area), I was pleasantly surprised. In the past I found them overpriced and food was always small crab legs and normally cold.  This one is located in a touristy area near the river.  I had been to other ones and thought a little overpriced for the quality and what you get.  This time I was pleasantly surprised.  I ordered the Steam pot (forgot which one) but had crab, shrimp and sausage and it was very good.   The food was really hot so that was nice.   The waitress (yes it was a lady) made me wear the bib which I did not like but I played along.  I was full and the draft beer hit the spot.  I would recommend this one and give it a 4."}
{"text":"I've been to this location twice, once for my bothers birthday the other for my anniversary and I loved it both times. The portions are very huge and honestly one steam pot can be shared between two people. The drinks are big and some are stronger than others, so you get your money's worth. The last time I went I printed off a coupon and was able to receive a free appetizer for up to $15, we ordered the crab dip, which I would highly recommend.  They are very pricey, but that is to be expected at a seafood restaurant."}
{"text":"Really upset with myself as I forgot to check in on Yelp!     Anyway, 2nd time here @ Joe's and it was as nice as the first~ just apps & cocktails both DEEELISH! They really have great cocktails especially the Patio Punch  very nice taste and cold for the HOT days here in Henderson.   Our app was the Coconut   Shrimp, also quite good and generous portion certainly enough for sharing.   The servicer, Joe was very attentive, as always and he was also the bartender~ so this is a great guy to become friends with. No rush and easily paced allowed us to chat and catch up as we girls like to do"}
{"text":"If you read my other review, you'll note that my husband and I went to the Joe's Crab Shack on Baseline a few months back; the experience was less than stellar for my husband and tepid for me.  We decided to give it another try at a different one.  This experience was marginally better for me and significantly better for my husband.  Like the last time, I ordered the crab nachos because they were good as well as a large-enough portion size that it wouldn't have been necessary to order anything else.  My husband ordered the Blackened chicken club sandwich.  Taste wise, my food was good.  It was freshly made and well-plated.  Nothing tasted overcooked or bland.  My husband's food looked great and was plated well, too.  The chicken was blackened sufficiently.  He enjoyed everything and said it was much better than the last time.  The service was good.  Not great, just good.  Our server seemed like she enjoyed what she did.  She enthusiastically shared her preferences about what to choose.  She brought us our drinks in a timely fashion and refilled on cue every time.  My husband's a fan of extra condiments with his food, i.e., ranch.  He was never without, as she brought an unending supply of it.  I walked away with not much of a better impression of Joe's Crab Shack.  It wasn't because this experience soured me; it was because my collective experience in Phoenix didn't compare to what I enjoyed in Florida.  Maybe there's a natural difference between the West and East Coast attitude?  I don't know.  What I do know is that I walked away with a tinge of sadness of a decline of former greatness.  As a counterbalance, my husband's opinion grew exponentially.  He's definitely a promoter."}
{"text":"The two-star review is the average between my husband's experience and mine.  I grew up in Florida, so I have known about Joe's for a while.  I had gone there several times and had always found their food to be great and of good quality.  However, it's been more than 10 years since my last visit.  My husband had never even heard of them, let alone dined there.  We decided to go there a week ago.  For me, when I walked in, it was just like old times.  The smell of seafood wafting through the air, the spacious tables, the busy waitstaff all took me back to Florida.  Customers seemed pleased being there.  Yet the first experience was with the host.  She seemed utterly bored with her job, because she didn't smile or seem welcoming.  She boringly asked us if we wanted to dine inside or out and got our menus and directed us according to our response, which was inside.  After having been seated, our waiter came to the table.  He was nice-looking, which isn't shocking, since they want them to be tipped well, but he was the most disinterested waiter I had had in a long time.  He dryly asked us what we wanted to drink, didn't offer suggestions, and didn't bother to ask if we had been there before.  This was a purely transactional relationship to him.  I'm tolerant of disaffected waitstaff, but my husband isn't in the least.  The bright side is he brought out our drinks correctly.  We then ordered our food through him, and, again, he was disengaged and appeared to have his mind on something else.  And this is where the problems came about.  Fifteen minutes later, my food had arrived but not my husband's.  My husband told me to go ahead and eat, since we thought his food would arrive shortly thereafter.  Twenty minutes after that (and of me snacking on my food in an attempt to wait), his food still had not arrived.  The waiter hadn't stopped by or didn't proactively try to determine what the issue was.  We had to flag down one of the managers to find out what was happening.  Apparently, the staff in the back either forgot about the meal or had some issue with the oven.  My husband's an easygoing fellow, but where he will let his feelings be known unequivocally is in restaurants when he feels he receives poor service.  He certainly shared his feelings with the manager in no uncertain terms.  However, the manager's responses were great.  He smiled and said that he didn't want us to be made (I wasn't) and started rubbing my husband on the arm (in a consoling fashion) and making a few jokes to get us to laugh, and it worked for me.  For my husband, not so much.  I thought it was a great way to recover our service, but my husband's a tough one to placate after you have irritated him.  Regardless, the food came out five minutes later.  It was freshly cooked and looked great.  And despite my husband's protestations and hell-bent expectation of not liking the food, he admitted (when we got home) that the food was good.  From my perspective, I would have given them three stars, which includes a rating on the quality of the food and the service recovery by the manager.  My husband would have given it one star because of the entire experience.  The average is two stars.  Would I return?  Sure.  But it's clear that I'll be going without my husband in the future.  He's been forever turned off the place, which is understandable, considering this was his first-ever experience."}
{"text":"This was the worst meal we've had in years and really, really disappointing. We had dinner as a party of 6 on the patio, as has been our yearly tradition when friends come down for baseball spring training. (Not coming here next year, that's for sure!) Our waitress, who was obviously overloaded with tables, did her best but she was not as attentive as we would expect. The worst part, though, was how bad the food was. My Dungeness crab was tasteless, the potatoes tasted like they were cooked yesterday, and the corn on the cob was tough and tasted like field corn, not sweet corn. My husband ordered the Wednesday special of all you can eat shrimp and it, too, was awful. The coconut shrimp, sadly, was the worst. It was tasteless and soggy/soft in the middle - scary what's up with that and we're hoping he doesn't get sick tonight. Given how much food was left on our companions' plates, we suspect their meals were just as bad but it wasn't discussed, probably for fear of putting a damper on the evening. Don't waste your money eating here."}
{"text":"Could have bought triple the amount of crab legs else where and I wouldn't have had to deal with the terrible service, at other tables I saw wrong food coming out and waitresses that honestly could have cared less. Dining room was a comfortable -20 and I just wanted to leave to feel my extremities again. Our waitress even told me that my $16 lobster was frozen. $70 well spent and a $10 tip expected. Two stars for the shark."}
{"text":"Slow service and mediocre food at best.  Calamari breading had no seasoning, the grilled shrimp were very overdone and tough.  Food took 40 minutes to come to the table even when the restaurant was empty."}
{"text":"This was probably the best most pleasant service I've ever gotten. I eat out lunch almost every day and it's hard to impress me. The manager Donny was out talking to guest as you would expect in a good service establishment. But more importantly the managers expectations oozed from his employees as they were cheerful, pleasant and engaging. just good wholesome people that seem to care and wanted to help, but yet not overbearing at my table every five seconds. just great all around service from the server to the greeter to the manager. With higher-quality food you get a little bit higher price so this isn't a place that I can afford to eat every day but it's definitely worth a try. And if you get creative with appetizers and sharing pots you can keep it affordable."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time/money. The saddest lamest coldest crab cake served over a bed of wilted lettuce with an unripened tomato."}
{"text":"Steampot was meh.  Driest mussels I've ever had.  Crab legs blah & I just realized that it didn't have any sausage in it.   My friend asked waitress if they had Mudslides & she said no. Then we saw it on menu & she ordered it & the waitress said \"oh, ok.  Would you like a shot of alcohol in it?\"  We informed her it was mostly alcohol & she was like, \"oh. I've never heard of it.\"  Why does she not know the menu."}
{"text":"Brittany, our server was wonderful. She explained the portion sizes that we saw being served that helped us to make good choices.  This was or first time at Joe's and didn't have a clue. We ordered the shrimp po-boy that took me back to New Orleans! and the sampler appetizer platter. Big portions and freshly made potato chips. Even go cups for our drinks for the very hot day. A great experience."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with Joe's Crabshack. Oysters were shriveled. Steamed clams and lobster were overlooked. Clam chowder and French fries were too salty. The products were fresh but not prepared properly. Oysters were fresh  but must have been shacked too early and sat too long on ice that they were all shriveled up. Lobster was fresh but over cooked. Must have sat too long in steamer pots. Kitchen needs retraining on how to properly prepare good and fresh seafood. Will give Joe's another try when you've retrained kitchen. Give me a holler then."}
{"text":"This is the best Joes Crab Shack I have ever visited. Christina my waitress was the best waitress and provided excellent customer service.   She made some really great suggestions, and up sold my original order, which turned out to be some really great crab legs.  Thank you Christina for providing great customer service. Keep up the good work. Thank you Christina for providing great customer service keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Great meal and great experience! Ideal place to celebrate a birthday or fun event!  Service was great and food was brought out quickly! Our particular server was cool and the manager initially came by to greet us. He came back again to check on us later. The employees dance for an occasional song (about every 30 mins or so) to encourage more of a fun festive atmosphere for customers. Some may not like the music, but I liked it and most people enjoy it! Seafood in general is usually kinda high priced anywhere, but Joe's is no more expensive than the next place."}
{"text":"Great service. Good food. Our favorite seafood spot! We have been coming here for years. Our kid is a huge fan of crab and they never disappoint. We'll be returning for many more occasions.."}
{"text":"Used to go to this Joe's location somewhat regularly back in 2005-2008 until we relocated. Long story short, we moved back home in August. Once we got back and settled, we made a point to return to our old hangout. Needless to say, while the outside remained the same, much else has changed. Inside is completely different and menu wise it is substantially different. Mainly,  prices have hiked to a level where Joe's has become a \"once in a blue moon\" visit instead of a regularly visited establishment like it used to be. The service was very good however, although I wish out server would have had exact prices of the menu items. We were told the shark bite drink for two was $9; once we got it and began drinking it, we were informed it actually was $15. $6 may seem like no big deal, but it certainly would have made a difference on whether we chose to buy it or not. When we have drank out of it, we can't exactly say \"oops, no thanks.\"  Other than this, Joe's is a nice little establishment. The manager Scott seems to genuinely care about you having a good experience, the food was good as always, everyone was extremely nice and my kids enjoyed themselves. No complaints otherwise than the ones listed above. Price is a bit steep and the staff should be a little more aware of pricing."}
{"text":"Food was served fast and hot. Drinks were above average with a good pour. My waitress Hanna was attentive and professional and personable. Manager on duty was perky and nice. For a Tuesday evening, after the mall closed hours, this staff was on top of things compared to other Joe's I've been to in other states."}
{"text":"So we go to Joes again for my son's birthday and all three of us order the Arctic Stream pot, well again the food was terrible, the food was cold and very very rubbery like it was sitting out all day. This would be the second time that joes let me down. We ended up having to go to taco bell because it was late. Very disappointed. What made it worse is that we told the waitress about it and all she offered was ice cream to fix the problem. Now that's customer satisfaction if I ever seen it... Lol We are here on two different birthdays and both times we were not satisfied. Needless to say we will not be eating at Joe's again..."}
{"text":"Fun, kid friendly atmosphere! Service was fantastic from the moment we walked in, and they were quite busy too. Great Balls of Fire are AMAZEBALLS!! My daughter had the Dixie chicken salad which she said was fabulous. Got Crabs??"}
{"text":"Not a review of the restaurant or food, just the bar.  The bar tender was awesome and fun and served up some fun drinks.  SHARK BITE!!!  Thanks."}
{"text":"Loved the waiter! Super nice and personable! The food came out perfect and so did the rest of my party. The only thing is that I got really sick off of just eating the chicken."}
{"text":"Really bad food, very disappointing!!! Lobster and crab was over salted and smelled way too fishy! My husband ordered steak and it was just as bad. Not coming back again!"}
{"text":"This location is so much more low-key than the one in my hometown of Sacramento, California.    I immediate noticed that is was actually quiet and it wasn't cluttered with all the crap that they usually put on the walls. I was able to eat in peace. Being able to hold a conversation without having to say \"huh\" and  leaning over my crab to get my ear closer the person speaking was a pleasantry!   The food came out timely and hot. The service was great.   One ULTRA big plus was that the employees didn't come out on the floor to sing and dance around us like a bunch of banchees.   I enjoyed my experience here and would come back!"}
{"text":"OMG worst experience I've had, my family and I visited this location today, and although the person that waited on us was great the food was bland and unflavored, if this meal was representative of seafood greatness then I would denounce my love of seafood forever and never step foot in another seafood restaurant. $258 dollars latter I feel like my family and I were robbed of a great, and tasty experience and left with the memories of how good this restaurant once was, it wasn't worth the time,effort, energy or money, and we remain highly disappointed."}
{"text":"I got sick and the lady at the front desk was so rude. I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Granted, I did not order a \"bucket\" like I have twice in the past. Not paying $30. I had the East Coast Platter. Fried fish, crab cakes, 3 stuffed shrimp, fries, onion strings. Fish was mediocre and super- greasy. The crab cake was a joke. This place serves crabs; I found 2 small pieces of crab and it had zero seafood taste (I hope their entree was better). The shrimp were shrimp, and what chef puts fries and onion strings together. My  domestic draft was $4.20. For the shrimp, my wife's strong drink, and the waiter, 2 stars."}
{"text":"We just had dinner at Joe's Crab Shack in Tempe, AZ. The service was terrific!! Our servicer was so helpful, especially since we had never been here before. She helped us navigate through the menu, beginning with drinks, then appetizers, and finally explaining the difference between the different types of crab entrees, buckets, combinations, etc. all with a smile on her face! As I looked around the room, all the servers were doing the same thing at various tables. Joe's was filled with good food, smiles, and laughter. We look forward to returning with friends. If you've never been there, give it a try!"}
{"text":"OK so this place lost stars for a couple of reasons.  First off, both my husband and I ordered the same thing, Fish and Chips. My husband's fish was great, however mine was slightly burnt and just down right gross. This is because they fried my fish with old grease which made it dark brown and burnt. The coleslaw is really watery which makes it difficult to eat. We also ordered an appetizer, the bucket of shrimp which was awesome and the seasoning was to die for. Judy the server was superb and we were even greeted by the manager and served by him personally. When I informed them about my food they gave me two gift cards for free appetizers for my next visit which was great. The service was 5 stars but I had to deduct 2 points for inconsistency of meal quality. I would come back but only if they get their cooks to use fresher ingredients."}
{"text":"Just came here yesterday for my birthday.  The atmosphere is ideal for kids. This location on Rainbow and Lake Mead has a playground outside for kids to play in. Although its Las Vegas and it's hot out, kids will be kids and will not allow the heat to deter them from playing on it. Upon arrival the hostess wasn't as friendly as a hostess should be, but our server definitely made up for that. Our server Lacy was awesome. She had a positive bubbly attitude. She was so helpful and super friendly. I really appreciate her as my server.   I ordered an appetizer of a bucket of 18 shrimps. Although the shrimps were a little on the smaller side, dipping it in the cocktail sauce made it delicious. Only problem was that the seasoning was smuthered on the outside of the shell on the shrimp. When the shell is peeled off, the Old Bay seasoning went along with it.   For main course, i ordered the new Queen crab. The queen crab was new and was supposedly in season and was the most popular item, so I ordered that with the garlic herb spice. The crab was disappointing when it came out. The meat was described as meaty and juicy on the menu. When arrived, the shell sure looked big, but when cracking it open, the meat was tiny and unfulfilling. I don't recommend the queen crab. The meat was a little on the dry side. The flavoring was a disappointment. I recommend making your own sauce with lemon juice, tobasco, and pepper.   The stuff snapper was an item that was also order, and it was delicious! the crab meat on top of the snapper gave the fish a delightful taste.   The kids menu was good with a variety of burgers and chicken suitable for kids with a choice of vegatable or fries. Beware: there are no refills on juices or milk. I suggest ordering a soda or lemonade if your kids are thirsty from playing outside in the playground.  Since it was my birthday, the people who brought me here expected a free dessert. They DO NOT offer a free dessert, even for your birthday. What they do offer is a song and pony ride. They came out and sang a birthday song, expecting for me to gallop around restaurant. I believe this is geared more towards kids and an adult. Although embarassing, the kids found it fun and entertaining.   All and all i give this place a 4 star."}
{"text":"Best crab and lobster I've ever had. First time here and it was amazing make sure to try the Arctic if you can it has everything!"}
{"text":"The servers and hosts always wonderful, however tonight for the first time we got something.other than.a steampot. Don't!"}
{"text":"Corporate greed at its finest. Build up a businesses reputation and then cut costs and reap the profits.   We used to frequent Joe's Crabshack. During the rough economy we watched the portions get smaller, crab clusters coming out with 2 & 3 legs on them and the size getting smaller. We vowed to never return.  Fast forward 2 years or so and we figured we would see if things had changed. They did. For the worse. The crab now are so small I honestly think they are buying juvenile crab from poachers that are illegal to catch. You know? The ones that you are supposed to throw back?   Well that was the final straw. No matter how much we missed the BBQ crab, we will not return.   After spending $100 on dinner for 2, I had to go next door to Famous Dave's for a burger. $11 for an actual meal. I would have had to order 10 crab buckets @ $22.99 each to make a meal at Joe's. Disappointing to say the least."}
{"text":"My wife and I went there for the first time  What i didn't like is that you pay for something that you hafta settle on. Im really not into french fries and there is no substitute like onion rings instead but other than that the service was really good and our waiter Sergio did a fantastic job and was spot on,Just wish they had a better variety of food is all. I don't think i will be going back. For what i spent there are better places available"}
{"text":"That was an experience I don't care to repeat. The servers were friendly enough but the food, not so much. The batter for the shrimp was so heavy I could have used it for floor mats. There was no flavor in the hush puppies. I did have 1 of the category 5 hurricane drinks, that was good. All in all this was my first and probably last visit to Joe's Crab Shack."}
{"text":"First time at Joes.  The atmosphere average for a restaurant chain, the wait staff very friendly and accommodating, service good, but the food less than average.  The mussels appetizer was good with a slightly spicy garlic juice.  Could have used more bread for the juice.  The crab bucket came in a green bag with a piece of corn and shrimp in the shell.  Extremely dry, no moisture and overcooked.  The shrimp was tough since it had been cooked to long in the bag.  Seems like it was a bag that came directly from food supplier and heated in a steamer or microwave.  The fish and chips were greasy.  You could see the oil in the batter when cutting it with the fork."}
{"text":"This place in general is a little too cheesy for me.  They offer mediocre seafood with over the top waitstaff.  The waitstaff remind me of the movie Office Space where they try to be overly excited that you are there.  It is almost like you are buying a used car.     I will start with the food.  It is very messy and drizzled in butter.  Don't wear any good clothes or risk having butter splotches all over.  The food itself is just ok.  Nothing to write home about.    The on-tap beer selection is less than desired.  If you like mass produced beers then you are in luck.    I would say save your money go to a locally owned restaurant where you won't be subjected to all of the cheesiness."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. I have no idea why we decided to come here but we ended up here and it was truly as mediocre as you get.  Service was a young gal that seemed friendly enough but when we needed to check on food status, which by the way was *painfully*slow, she was too busy scrubbing a tables chair legs. Not the time to be housekeeping in the middle of dinner kitchen rush.  The food was really mediocre. I know, it's mostly fried seafood and yes, it can be done even decently well, this was not however. It tasted of old oil and dripped of it to... A disgusting mess, all around.  For what we paid and what appeared on our plates, it was a joke to even imagine we'd come back again. No way.  I'll give it two stars because the staff was over nice and welcoming and the balloon guy made my kids really neat balloon figures. That's it."}
{"text":"Ok we thought we would try this place ONE MORE TIME because let's be honest that 30 shrimp for 11.99 is a deal. We walked in and were seated right away and told who our waiter  be (Maurice) he came right away and took our drink orders and we placed our order which arrived promptly. During our meal the manager (I believe his name was Paul) came over to check on us very friendly and gracious offered to bring me a new water instead of refilling my empty one. He thanked us for choosing their restaurant for dinner. Maurice was efficient and took care of us. We will go back after this experience. Thank you for that great service!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed, next time I'll go to red lobster! Very small snow crab clusters missing legs, no healthy side options and when I asked for a side salad instead of their fried options I had to pay an extra $3.50 for a poorly thrown together salad. Not worth the prices they charge!"}
{"text":"In my opinion you go to a crab shack, and you get crab!  And the crab there is excellent, get the QUEEN CRAB IN RAJUN CAJUN, you wont be disappointed However if  you're that one person whose dragged along for the ride there are of plenty of non-seafood items on the menu that are just as good.  Servers are very friendly and knowledgeable, just ask them their suggestions they are more than happy to explain things to you.  Weekdays are great for Joe's, they have happy hour specials at the bar, and no wait time.  The weekends may be a different story, obviously more people go out on the weekends and it can get pretty busy, so waiting longer should be expected, just be patient and have a good time  I give this place 5 stars because service bends over backwards to make you happy, and if your food doesn't come out right or burnt they usually replace and give you something else or extras."}
{"text":"When going to any restaurant, I walk in the door knowing the tip will start out at 20%. My tip is always based on the service, not the quality if the food or the wait time to get the food. I began to decrease the tip amount when the service begins to fall below normal \"good\" service. My daughter, her boyfriend, and I visited Joe's Crab Shack on 9/18, arriving at 11:00 am. Since it had just opened, there were very few customers in the restaurant. Our server, a young man, came over quickly to take our drink orders. Although he was not very friendly, he was efficient & brought the drinks in a reasonable length of time. He came back once to refill our drinks. My issue started when we finished our meal. There were still very few customers in the restaurant. We sat for at least 15 minutes trying to get our waiters attention to bring our check. He seemed to avoid looking in our direction. My daughter finally walked over to the hostess to request our waiter be sent to our table.  The tip went down, at that point to 15%.  When he came with our check, I gave him my credit card & ID. He took everything then began to wait on another table, leaving us waiting for another 5-10 minutes. When he brought the ticket back, although he had my ID,  which is female, he handed everything to my daughter's boyfriend. I could understand this if the restaurant was busy but he was working 2 tables. At that point, the tip went down to 12%. The food was good, the service was fair until the end of the meal. I believe in leaving a fair tip and in this case, I think 12% was fair."}
{"text":"I like this place for the potential of something crazy happening here. Every single time I've been here I've witnessed something hilarious.  One time I ate too much and went into a food coma and was too stuffed to drive and almost got in an accident...with a co-worker...  We went here for my friend's birthday. They are SO awesome. It was me, a bunch of my guy friends, and their families.  They brought costumes out and picked an 80's purple prom dress, a pink feather boa, goggles, etc. A bunch of girly, goofy stuff. He had to put them on and walk around the restaurant. Good times!  They don't force you or pressure you to do anything. I just think you're a lame, boring person if you're afraid of being embarrassed. Life is too short...dance at Joe's!  The food is good. It's nothing spectacular, but it's decent. I enjoy the appetizers.  The only thing is...I'm 21 and always have the urge to play on the playground.  Also, it can get pretty loud. But this isn't some place where you go for a quiet, romantic dinner in your designer clothes.  I've never wanted crabs this much... *cough*"}
{"text":"The service was OK.  The food was OK.  Kind of on the expensive side for the quality but like I said, it was OK.  I wouldn't say it was the best seafood I ever had but it certainly wasn't the worst.  I dunno, it's sort of borderline between 2 and 3 stars but our overall experience was decent."}
{"text":"I have only been here once and it's been awhile.  I remember it being a little pricey for what you get, but the food was decent.  Red Lobster is probably a better bet, especially if you don't want your waiter pressuring you into making a fool of yourself in their conga line."}
{"text":"Came twice: once because I had a free kid's meal, once because I had a gift card. I can't deny that I do love the song and dance this place provides as well as the seafood,which I would eat everyday if it didn't cost so damn much. I guess the prices are competitive, but it's still a bit pricey to me, which is why I only go when I have a GC or freebie.  Last time I got the steampot with crab, shrimp, sausage, corn, and red potatoes. My kiddo had  a kid version of the same thing and we both enjoyed it much. The only thing is i wish I had enough to take home-for the same price I can go to hash house and have enough for 2-3 meals, but no seafood in it. I hate how expensive seafood is in Las Vegas.  This place has cool cocktails, beer on draft, and neat looking decor hanging from the ceiling. Of course I will be back, but I do need a coupon!!"}
{"text":"I was treated VERY badly there today by the truly awful hostess.  She has major issues and should NOT be the first thing one encounters upon entering.  She made me wait to ask her for a table, I was patient while she did some \"busywork\" that did not seem particularly pressing.  I asked to be seated outside.  She disappeared for an inordinate amount of time then came back & said she had no tables free & it would take 10-15 minutes to clear a table. Mind you, this was at 2pm, the place was not very busy & I had just seconds before seen 3 tables free & clean on the patio, which is why I requested one.  She argued w/me on that point (great customer service).  I said my children are very hungry, can I put in their order while we wait for a table?  She replied bluntly, \"No.\"  I then said, \"So you're willing to lose the business of our whole family because you won't seat us outside when there's several tables available?\"  She shrugged her shoulders & went back to her \"other business.\"  Highly recommend you avoid this place unless you like your seafood with a huge side of ATTITUDE!"}
{"text":"Yes!!! Great service from the AWESOME Shalena!!! My food was Amazing....my service was Amazing....the manager was Amazing! What more can we say. I don't even live in the state but I do frequent Joe's in California and this is by far my best experience. Can't wait to come back.  Thanks Shalena!!!!"}
{"text":"Matt is the best waiter!! Thank you for serving me and my family!! We sure will come back a second time!! Plus thank you for helping me with the menu for a first timer!"}
{"text":"Great place to take the family because of the friendly service.  The food is okay but the portions are small and leave you wanting more.  The lobster tail was too salty and the steak was good, but small.  I like the personal service, but I don't like how small the meals are.    Go to a seafood buffet at The Rio or M Resort.  Their prices might be higher, but at least you eat till you can take no more.  Plus, the crab legs are tasty & plentiful."}
{"text":"Wednesday 7pm.  This place is your average over priced, lack of taste chain food restaurant and this place was no different.   I have to say, I was super disappointed as I have always heard rave reviews, now I'm starting to question who I associate with and their taste in food.  Service=slow. Food=just tastes like salt Noise=loud and they do a dance...like a lot.  Go somewhere else and skip Joe's Crabs."}
{"text":"Um I don't know.. the food was okay, the fish and chips were disappointing, it tasted like a vanilla battered fry and our waitress tonight is nice but she is serving other people and hardly checks on our table. So we waited a lot as in waited until we stared her down till she sees us. I'm not sure if I'm coming back. Eh I prefer Hot N Juicy Crawfish or Angry Crab Shack or the one in L.A. Boiling Crab  I'm sorry but I wasn't satisfied tonight at Joe's Crab Shack"}
{"text":"Came in last night for dinner. We were quickly seated by the host and asked if we had ever been to Joes. We said no, and she said ok well your waiter will answer any questions you have. Ok, then why did you even ask us? Just seemed odd...  I'm not a huge seafood fan so I opted for calm chowder, hush puppies and a side ceasar. The ceasar was the absolute worst salad I've ever had. Some of the lettuce was brown/black on the edges and I think they may have given me half a teaspoon of dressing. Disappointing. Hush puppies were super greasy and a little overcooked. A side order included 8 - way more than I expected.  Others at the table really enjoyed their food! Our waiter was prompt and refilled our drinks quickly.   I would suggest coming for lunch - cheap options. Or on Tuesday, all day, they have a whole $2 menu with lots of items."}
{"text":"Having Birthday lunch at Joe's was a wonderful idea; my son chose it himself and I'm glad he did. Our waiter, Joe - yes, Joe - was amazing, fun, attentive to the Birthday Boy, and made the experience one to remember. Thank you Joe! And Joe's Crab Shack, you need more waiters like Joe!"}
{"text":"OMG! This place is terrible.My husband and I came to Joe's on  a Tuesday because they were advertising their 2 lbs of shrimp with corn and potatoes for 22.00.The steam pot came out with only a little seasoning shaken on top of the overly steamed shrimp.It had no flavor,the corn was rubbery and old.We told the waitress and she said sorry I will get you new corn and she came back with burned corn that tasted like the cook left it on the grill .We asked for the manager .kennica came over and I told her about our food experience.She said ok ,ok and walked away.Where's the I'm sorry or can I do anything to make it better.Wow! Just wow! We will never return and since we are both union workers in the community we will be sure to spread the word about the horrible food and service this Joe's offers."}
{"text":"Disappointed. The battered clam strips were great. The snow crab was pretty good. The king crab was pretty bad (it's maybe my favorite food but this was poor enough I didn't even finish it.). The lobster was small and over cooked. Didn't finish it either.   The kid at the bar that served me was great."}
{"text":"I have been to other joes crab shacks, I usually love their crab. This particular location is absolutely the worst one I have ever been too!! The crab was brown and tasted nasty. I barley ate any of it!!"}
{"text":"So I have always been a fan of Joes but tonight was not the best service we had.  My food was ok but my dads shrimp had to go back cause it was cold.  What makes me mad is that the manager didn't even do anything about it.  I don't know if he knows what customer service is."}
{"text":"I've been to other Joes & around the country and this one is the pittssss .. charging double for fish they ran out of ... keep away tourist trap.. and the king grab ,nothing to cut it with.."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a late lunch. Great atmosphere. Had the appetizer sampler and the VooDoo chicken app and that was enough to fill us both up with extra to take home. Food was delicious and the service was adequate, not great."}
{"text":"We have eaten a Joe's m any times and we wish the would bring back some of the Old Steampots they use to have but the Arctic Bay and Crab Daddy Feasts are still really good the calimari & steamed shrimp appetizers are yummy too."}
{"text":"Great location! I come here often for drinks or dinner because this spot is my favorite. I almost always have or see my favorite server there, \"Kitty\". She's fun and nice, and has recommended some great menu items. BBQ shrimp was my favorite and I miss it! Only thing that catches me off guard is the random dancing. When my drink is empty, I don't wanna hear Cupid Shuffle! Other than that, I'm always a happy guest here."}
{"text":"The overall appearance and atmosphere of the place is nice. It's open with adequate lighting, and a play area for kids! However, that is about the best I can say for Joe's Crab Shack. The hostess became our waitress and it was obvious that everyone was in a hurry, even though the restaurant was only 1/3 full. She checked on us frequesntly to get our order, only reread off the menu to answer our questions and after the food quickly arrived she was almost no where to be seen. We were each given 1 refill on our drinks without being asked if we wanted them or anything else. The steampot was a joke, and after making it known she had the manager come over who did nothing but joke around.   I ordered the fish and shrimp. The fish was lightly breaded, but crumbled apart when I tried to eat it. Fish did not have the best flavor either. The shrimp was great, but then I was again disappointed in the fries as they were not crispy, but limp and chewy.   Husband ordered the steampot with crab legs, veggies and sausage. Sausage and veggies were great! Crab legs were absolutely dismal. The snow crab legs were short and extremely thin, like a ball point pen. The queen crab legs were a bit better than the snow crab, but not by much. It was more work to get out what little meat was even there than it was worth. Horribly overpriced, not filling, poor value.   We ordered the fish and chips for our daughter from the kid's menu, which was the best value in our order. Her fish was beer battered, crispy, very tasty. The fries were the same, limp and chewy.   in summary, we will not be back. The food is nothing special, very over priced, and we left without getting so much as an apology from anyone."}
{"text":"When you order 33 shrimp for $11.99, you really have no one to blame but yourself. What are you expecting? Fresh, jumbo prawns straight out of the Atlantic? This is Joe's Crab Shack in Arizona.   I had low expectations and they were basically met. The beer battered shrimp looked like the dried shrimp you'd find in a styrofoam ramen container, wetted up and semi-brought back to life. No biggie. The coconut ones were kinda yummy in a no-frills sort of way.   Really sweet server and hey, you know what? I like this place. Just know what you're getting when you pay 36 cents per shrimp."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere and great service! My husband ordered the crab and lobster bucket and I ordered the snow crab legs. The crab legs were delicious and they give you tons of food. You definitely will not leave hungry. Our waiter was super funny and helpful. Great place to grab a beer and seafood. Family fun and friendly."}
{"text":"Very clean and friendly service. Jeremy was our server and he was as nice as they come. He did not hover and attended our needs as necessary. Thanks Jeremy.....see you next time"}
{"text":"My first time here! Great music! Felt like dancing to every song. Happy hour was awesome! The crab dip was to die for and the hurricane drinks on happy hour were to good! Bucket of Queen crab was amazing!! Staff was super friendly and knowledgable. Definately will be going back!"}
{"text":"Between the prices and food quantity it's not that great. The flavors are good on some items like the shrimp jalapeño poppers and garlic mussels."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible. From the service to the sanitation to the food!! First we waited quite sometime for someone to greet us. Then, we ordered my son (who's birthday it is) a cool little drink. The guy served it with the entire presentation to another table. The kid played with the shark the drink came with cuz the grenadine was poured out of it, the server took the drink and shark from that kid and served it to my child. Wth?!? Nobody offered a new one or apologized! The food wasn't prepared properly. Tacos were blackened weren't supposed to be, missing items from my kids steam pots, crab nachos were gross, shrimp was what looked to be fried two too many times! No silverware was given and by the time we saw our server to ask for it, the food that was at our table was cool! At one point the server said she was sorry and that the kitchen was a little flustered due to a 50 top. I didn't see more than a handful of people in there and I can now see why!! There was no apology or discount at the very least for my sons drink. But to top it off our 8 top (3 kids) was added gratuity. We went there last year for my daughters b-day (10 mo ago) and it was great! The food was still just ok at best. We will never return, you can definitely find better food and service somewhere else!!"}
{"text":"Shocked that someone wrote a review and actually liked the CRAB CAKES...which is what I ordered.  I have never had crab cakes that either looked like these or tasted like these.  They had way too much pepper for one thing and no breading at all.  It looked like they shredded some crab and tried to make patties that didn't stick together and them baked them....they were HORRIBLE!  The side of coleslaw was about 2 tablespoons worth in a paper cup!  I've been here twice before....and didn't care for it either time so shame on me for giving them another chance!  One STAR is being generous."}
{"text":"I've been a huge fan of Joe's for years, and normally I'd give it 5-out-of-5 stars.  But they just recently gutted their menu, eliminating half their items!  And, of course, my favorite (Go Shrimpin') was one of the meals that didn't make the cut.  When I first got the menu, there were so few items on it I had to ask the waitress if they accidentally gave us the lunch menu instead."}
{"text":"What a great place! Amazed with the customer service. Never been to a place before that goes so above and beyond for a customer like the manager Kaitlin and her Staff."}
{"text":"I have been a customer for years. Being from MD this was one of the only few options. I miss the McClintock & Southern location. The staff was always friendly and my food was always correct. So I waited to write this review to see if I still felt negative about my last experience. On Halloween my son & I went to this location it was kids eat free. When we arrived around 8pm one whole side of the restaurant was already closed down and there wasn't a lot of people maybe 10 tables. Our food took over an hour to come out my potatoes were raw and my crab legs and corn were cold. The waiter wasn't too friendly and seemed like he was ready for his shift to be over he never offered refills. When I told him about my potatoes no apology he took them and came back with more that were uncooked my corn had so much seasoning I could only eat one side. For almost $40 I expect hot odd that is fully cooked and asked if we would like a refill. After this experience I will just cook my crabs at home instead of wasting my money and being treated wrong . I was a customer like the people at all the tables. I still tipped the waiter even though he did not deserve it doing the bare minimum. The casino has crab legs twice a week for a better deal I suggest going there instead."}
{"text":"Joe's Crab Shack saves the day. Driving into Vegas we were starving, from the long ride. We got there just in time, right before it got crowded. As soon as we arrived, we got seated. Perfect!  Our waiter was very personable, efficient and attentive. The restaurant was clean and designed like your typical Crab Shack. I already knew I wanted, some fried shrimp, so of course, thats what I ordered.   Food  Jumbo Shrimp & Fried fish - This was my first time trying it, it was very good. I wish I had ordered more shrimp. Joe's Classic -  crab, shrimp and andouille sausage. I did not care for the sausage, but the Shrimp & Crab was good. Drinks - Pina Colada was very sweet. Did not enjoy it. The rum was surprisingly absent. (bummer)  I'll probably stop in again just for the fish & shrimp."}
{"text":"Awesome experience snow crabs we lit so delicious drinks food 5 stars way better the waitress Bryson was awesome  great place to come and eat"}
{"text":"An very disappointing dinning experience.  Extremely overpriced for what you get.  I ordered the king crab and got a small and abused looking half of crab.  There was no pincer, half of one of the legs was missing, and the crab shell had holes in it from being mishandled which allowed boiling water inside and contaminated the flavor of the meat."}
{"text":"We went here because of the hype that was in Hawaii about not having a Joe's Crab Shack in Hawaii. I was curious to see how this place would differ from Red Lobster and other seafood restaurants. It was great! When we arrived, we were quaintly seated in a booth. Our server, Andrea, was the best. She wasn't like some waiters who wanted to be out of there. She genuinely (or at least she had the feeling of) wanted to take care of us and wanted us to have a wonderful time. The array of menu selections seemed to look ordinary and we thought it would be the same as R. Lobster.  We ordered the starter appetizer that had the calamari, dip, and poppers. It was delicious. We were all scrambling for the last piece of chip to dip.   The courses, though it tasted great to me, wasn't of the best taste to my parents.  My mother ordered one of the seafood platters and thought it tasted okay at first. Unfortunately, when she bit into one of her scallops, it was mostly batter and a pebble sized scallop in the middle. My father, though he enjoyed his fresh seafood bucket, felt the \"fresh seafood\" was lacking. As he ate his crab, he said it tasted overcooked and that it had hardly any meat in it.  I, on the other hand, had a great experience. I also had a seafood platter which included the.crab cake, crab stuffed shrimp, onion strips, and fish and chips. The crab cake, stuffed shrimp, and onion strips were delicious, but what amazed me was the fish from the fish and chips. The fish was battered and fried just enough so that it didn't taste like batter. It was also VERY crispy which made it taste even better. That was the best fish I had.   While waiting for our meal, the employees engaged in playful dancing that enjoyed everyone at Joe's.  Would I go back again? You bet'cha!"}
{"text":"First time here..wasn't that great. Better off making it at home or a buffet. After all it is vegas and pretty sure you can get much better seafood for the price you'll pay here or even cheaper!! But my experience here..food wasn't cooked all the way and pretty much no seasoning (got one of the buckets..don't remember what it's called but it had a citrus seasoning). Took about 10mins to get someone's attention--place wasn't even busy/packed. Ended up getting the manager..he was nice and took care of the problem. Food came out better, seasoned, fully cooked, and he took 50% off of my meal. Which me and my sister appreciated. In my opinion I wouldn't go here again.. :/"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time during lunch. Someone suggested it and I'm not sure why I've never been here before. The service is very friendly. The host and our server came with a smile. We ordered the steam pots on the menu. The crab legs, lobster, and clams are flavorful and delicious. The shrimp was okay in my opinion. Comes with potatoes, corn, and sausage. I'm a seafood lover so I enjoyed my meal. Would come here again."}
{"text":"To be entirely honest the experience did not look too promising at the beginning. We ordered drinks from the bar. Mine was decent enough BUT my husband's was terrible. Our waitress was fantastic and immediately took it back, saying it would be taken off our bill. But then the bartender comes over to our table with a sour attitude, basically interrogating my husband about why he did not like the Margarita and asking if he's ever even had one. First off, excuse me? & secondly he stated he made it with a \"knock off\" Grande Marnier, who uses Grande Marnier in a Strawberry Margarita? We did not appreciate his attitude at all. And he is the sole reason for a missing star.  Our food came out and it didn't look like what order at all. I ordered the Samuel Adams Steam Pot and my Husband ordered the Classic with Garlic. We asked for both to have shrimps substituted for the Sausage. BOTH came with Sausage. Mine was missing both the Clams and the Shrimp. We kinda just rolled with it, at this point we felt like we made a mistake coming at all. Our waitress seemed flustered by the kitchens mistake and went back to order the missing items for us.  But then, about 5-10minuteslater another waiter was wondering around, looking extremely confused. I laughed and looked at my husband saying, \"wanna bet those pots are our real ones?\" He came over to our table and I asked what types they were and as I thought they were our actual pots. It was a bit comical at this point. Now the manager came over, we did not call or ask for him. He was very nice and simply said \"keep it all, the extra Steam Pots, the extra orders, everything. It's on the house for our mistakes.\"  We were so shocked but it was handled in such an amazing way. We did not expect that at all. All the staff, minus the horrible bartender, had such amazing service and attitudes! It turned our night from, \"wtf did we do coming here?\" to \"wow, this is great customer service\"   We would definitely return!  Also, our waitress, Hannah, was superb! She handled all the bumps like the pro and it was only her 2nd night as a waitress! She is most definitely a keeper Joe's Crab Shack!!!"}
{"text":"We walked in, and the entire staff was doing the chacha slide. We stood and waited for a good 5 minutes before ANY one even acknowledged us. Another couple walked in....took menus and seated themselves.  Our server was Senta and she was kind and funny. We ordered a dozen oysters on the half shell. Mahi tacos, southern stuffed shrimp and a kids chicken tenders. I asked for extra avocado lime dressing.  Oysters come, and they are delicious, as always.  As we are waiting for food, a balloon artist comes and asks to make our daughter a balloon animal. We decline.  As our food comes..... No extra dressing for me. We wait. Our waitress comes by twice and still doesn't have it.   The bacon wrapped around the shrimp could have been a little crisper. But other than that, they were great. My dressing finally arrives, and now we wait for refills on water.... Which also doesn't come right away. She forgets about two times, long enough for us to all be done with our meal.  While she was forgetful, she is great with kids. She painted a zebra for my daughter on her dessert plate (current favorite animal) .   Service and attention is kind of lacking."}
{"text":"Food horrible, server sucked, didn't bring napkins or silverware. Food is better at long john silvers"}
{"text":"I've been to joes crab shack on many occasions but this past one was extremely memorable. Samantha our server was very attentive. She filled my glass of water multiple  times without me having to ask once. The icing on the cake was how they played the Cupid shuffle just so I could dance to it. The food was good but it was the great environment and fun staff that will keep me coming back."}
{"text":"Awful, looks great but all the food is thrown into a bucket so everything has the crab taste. The crab is wimpy and more like crawdads and the ambiance is more of a indoor picnic area than restaurant. It was hard to even get one good piece of crab to dip into some butter after paying a good price for the King Crab special. I have given the place 3 tries and finally gave up. Sorry."}
{"text":"We went here when there was construction and they had a good happy hour.  I returned today and everything was horrible.  The Fat Tire tasted like Budweiser and there were no specials for food during happy hour.   Fat Tire needs mixed gas not CO2.  I told this to the bar tender but he didn't care.  The food is just average, but you can buy a t-shirt with some STD innuendo."}
{"text":"I have one hour for lunch, from 11:30am to 12:30pm. Joe's Crab Shack is close by and the drive is minimal. I am seated by the hostess by 11:35am. I was not seen by a waiter as 11:45 comes to. I left. The place was empty except two tables and two people at the bar. The wait staff was hiding in the back kitchen. Very poor customer service."}
{"text":"I'm giving them a 5 star review for how they handled a poor experience we had.  My family came here for my brother's birthday a few weeks back, and two of our four dishes came out undercooked.  We brought it to the attention of our waitress, who brought the manager Adrienne over.  They both apologized profusely and took the charges off of our bill, which is what I would expect.  We were polite and appreciative of their apology and really didn't expect or ask for anything else.  However, they also offered to give us a credit to come back another time so they could prove to us that it was just a one time mistake.  We took them up on the offer, and sure enough the food was excellent the second time around.  Our server was fantastic, Adrienne came by to make sure we were happy, and the chef even came out to make sure we were pleased with the meal.  They really went above and beyond to make sure we left with a positive opinion of their restaurant.  Everybody makes a mistake once and awhile, but not everyone has such excellent customer service to correct it!  I will gladly return here as a result."}
{"text":"I don't understand the negative reviews at all!  After seeing commercials for Joe's for years but not having one close by we were thrilled to be staying at a hotel so close to one.  My husband, my daughter and I couldn't wait to go for dinner.  We weren't sure how crowded it would be but we were willing to wait as long as we had to.  When we arrived we were told 15-20 minutes, but it ended up being about 10.  The service was excellent and the food was to die for.  We had the sampler appetizer.  The crab balls were amazing, the calamari perfect, and the crab dip was amazing.  My husband and I each got the Sam Adams Steamer Pot and our 10 year daughter got her own Classic Steamer Pot.  She ate every crab and shrimp in the platter.  The sausage was a little too spicy for her and she didn't like the Old Bay on the corn, but her dad was happy to help her eat those, and she had plenty to chow down on without it.  I would love to have a Joe's in Lancaster, PA, though I would have to get a part-time job to support our crab habit."}
{"text":"Though the management tried to make things right after the fact, it was just bad from the get-go. Listening to a painting class on microphone on TOP of the already loud restaurant was god-awful and made it impossible to converse. Asked for a drink 3 times, from 3 different waiters, finally got one from the manager. Our waiter seemed stoned. One of the meals was not at all what we ordered. The fish and chips tasted funny; the breading? Not quality fish? On the plus side there was a LOT of it. Had to go get our own ketchup from another table, as no one checked on us nor brought drink refills. I get this is a casual chain, but I'm still spending hard earned money and would like good service."}
{"text":"I've been to many of Joe's locations throughout the country, and I would typically give them 4 stars.  But, on this occasion, it was my waitress, EVE, who caused me to give a 5 star review!   I pretty much know what to expect as far as the food goes.  Great chowder, crab legs, shrimp, etc.  But, Eve was the big difference for me on this visit to the Vegas area.  She was so very friendly (only in a professional waitress sort of way) and attentive to my requests for drinks, food, refills, etc.  My wife and I eat out almost every night, all over North America. My expectations are very high regarding how I should be treated by a waiter/waitress. Eve went far above and beyond what most servers typically do when it comes to prompt, efficient and respectful service.   The meal was wonderful and Eve was a delight.  Kudos to the manager who hired her."}
{"text":"Really great food tonight awesome service from JAKE on point with everything......he deserves a raise for sure ......good loookin in that steak for my mother in law"}
{"text":"It's a good 10 miles or so from the Vegas Strip.  But this location of this chain crab and seafood restaurant is so totally Las Vegas.  It screams \"tourists, come inside!\". You've got the tacky weathered all wood pseudo shack with \"Joes Crabshack\" sign outside.  Inside, there are Christmas lights all year, the big goofy 12' long fake fish hanging from the ceiling, men's bathroom with \"Dudes\" on it, and a special on 60 oz. pitchers of beer. And as a special treat, the kids had the best balloon guy ever.  For one kid, he did a Darth Vader all black \"hat\" with a black sword.  For a little girl, he created an orange fish with blue bubbles.  And for her sister, created a six petaled flower with green steams.    We were seated in about 5 minutes at 7 PM on a Friday night.  I really had low expectations of this place since I didn't enjoy my surf and turf meal at their Denver Colorado location a few years back.  Although I love crab, I hate to get my hands and shirt all dirty at a restaurant.  I will get sloppy at home where I can take a shower immediately after, but not here.  Pots of crab and seafood were the most popular item here.  A lot of the items are fried, like fish and chips, fried crawfish, fried shrimp.   My brother had the lump crab cake dinner with two crab cakes, a small bowl of coleslaw, and french fries ($13).   The two crab cakes were moist and naturally sweet with the true subtle crab flavor coming through, with just a slight douse of onion and garlic.  The fries were tender and crisp, and not too greasy.  The cole slaw had bits of red and green cabbage, and carrots in a slighlty tangy and very sweet mayo dressing. I would give that meal a 4.5 rating.  I had the half and half crawfish combo ($12) with one half crawfish etouffee with bits of crawfish in a warm creamy sauce.  The other half was deep fried crawfish tails. It was served with rice and cocktail sauce. Both are actually good and not overcooked.  I only at 1/3 of it because of my New Year's resolution to reduce my intake of fried foods. Myh meal was perhaps 3.5 stars. Our meals were enhanced by the beers on tap. My brother had Sam Adams regular lager, I had the Blue Moon.  Service was attentive enough. Music playing in the background was classic rock and pop from the 70s to the 90s.  The place is loud and energetic, with little kids and adults loving the tacky atmosphere, comedic balloon guy, and the food.  It was a pretty good experience here.   ."}
{"text":"I am sad to say that I used to love this francise. The casual, tie-dyed, cheeky, dancy atmosphere has just gone flat. The corporate boredom has set in.   I was in here last week and it seemed as though the staff went out of their way to be unobservant of our waiting to be seated, with my girlfriend being brushed aside by a staff member going toward the bathrooms without so much as a greeting/acknowledgement.  After half flagging someone down (who seemed quite irritated to be bothered by our presence) we were shown to a seat near the bar.   We waited for a moment and our drink order was taken promptly. After that we chatted. Waiting for our server to come take our meal order, we chatted through many subjects....then crickets. Looking around, there didn't seem to be a server in our area. The bartender occasionally would look in our direction. Finally, the bartender came over and asked if we were ready to order.   Waiting waiting waiting again. The meal took close to 40  minutes to come out. The salad for my girlfriend came out at the same time as the meal, and after the food finally arrived, the bartender, and manager were at our table asking how everything was about every 5 minutes or so.   In all, not a positive experience. My girlfriend's salad was more dressing than anything else. The food was so-so, but the service was dismal.  With all the good places out there ready to be gracious and welcoming, I can't suggest this as a place to drop your hard earned cash."}
{"text":"The food I got which was basically every side they had on the menu was kinda gross. But the drinks on thursday are cheap strong and pretty good. Mine came in a cute tiki cup. I got a bahama mama yum then I got the honey peach thing. It was syrupy and gross. Butttt they have a play area outside for kids and a cool patio with misters. Great place to grab a drink or fries with the kids on a gitl date friend date etc!"}
{"text":"Went there on a Saturday night. There were pretty busy we waited about 20 mins. Love the decor! I ordered mange strawberry freeze it wasn't that good. I preferred the one at Taco's Bell. But the food was delicious. Some of the comments claimed the food was salty since I like salty food it was perfect. But in general it might be a little too salty for other people. Appetizer was yummy. We got a platter. My favorite was crab dip? I don't remember the name but it was sooo good! The steam pot was big. My boyfriend order some fish and shrimps the portion was huge for the price we even have leftover!   Manager made his round twice to check on the customers which was very nice. But our server which I don't know his name wasn't that great. Definetly going back there again for my seafood fix. Yummy and Messy crab juice!"}
{"text":"Love, Love, Love Joe's Crab Shack.  This is our go to place when we are craving crab.  I always enjoy the Steam Pot of Crab: Queen crab with the Old Bay Seasoning, ear of corn, and new potatoes.    Always friendly service but it can be kind of slow at times."}
{"text":"My husband and I took our 5yr old daughter here and were able to get a table outside right next to the playground right away and off the kiddo goes to run off A LOT of energy. Our waitress was named Wei, and she was so cheery and very helpful. I have a dairy allergy and I told her about it while ordering my food. She advised me she would check wirh the kitchen to be sure they could accommodate. What I wanted, I couldn't have lol (because everything tastes better with butter!!!!! I really miss butter!!!) So she brought me out the menu to order something else. As I was browsing,  the manager came out to touch base with me and reassured me that they would do what they could to make me something that I can eat. At this point I am over the moon, because this is not typically the case which is why we don't eat out much.  I asked if The Steamer was a good route and she said she was fairly certain it was with the exception of the garlic bread, but she would again check to avoid any mix ups. The oh so yummy sounding garlic bath is butter based, but they could just steam the seafood and I got garlic oil on the side.  The food for all of us came out in a reasonable time considering they were packed.  My seafood was cooked perfect, the clams here are hilariously tiny, but we're in AS and it is what it is. My husband had a platter as well and all of the food was cooked well, but fried food is exactly that.. All the while, our very active 5 year old has eaten her fill of penne pasta and mandarins and is back running a muck on the playground while we sit and enjoy our dinner.  The waitress, Wei, was very attentive and we never had an empty glass on the table, but she wasn't in our face every 5 min either, which was nice. The manager even popped back over to check on us a few times.  As a local, I would definitely recommend this location as a family friendly spot.  Thank you Wei for great service!!! Thank you Ms. Nice Woman FOHM"}
{"text":"Worst restaurant experience I have ever had. The waitress was absolutely terrible. After not being able to answer any of the questions about her menu, I got tired of waiting for a refill, so I walked to the server station, and asked another server to get more water. Then wanting to pay for my bland shrimp order and leave this dump took absolutely forever. Definitely go somewhere else to waste money on crappy service and food."}
{"text":"Say what you like about chain restaurants. I despise almost all of them. Almost. There are certain standards expected that chains rarely have the skill set to pull off. Chain diners don't fall into automatic failure, and Joe's Crab Shack also remains unaffected.   Shack, it's in the name, so you can't complain about the decor. Having been born on the east coast, my mom is from Maine-dad from Maryland, I know seafood. And you can't complain about the seafood here. The clam strips are gigantic and delicious, not sure how they could go wrong unless they were frozen, small, chewy bits of fried dough. Which they were not. The corn was very sweet for this time of year, that troubled me, but didn't stop me from eating it. The Snow, Queen, and King crabs were all delicious as well, stay safe and get old bay seasoning version.   Now the reason for three stars. There is zero beer selection. For anyone that would like to drink a delicious draft beer paired with seafood, you will not find the non chain/shore town seafood house selection. Just the normal collection of crappy, watered down pilsners made from corn and rice. To bad they didn't start stocking Mad Dog 20/20 to match, I would have ordered a fruit punch one. Or perhaps some Boone's Farm, Colt 45, or PBR. Hold on a minute, I take it all back. I've just been informed that they have PBR."}
{"text":"It's our own fault.  We violated the first of the 10 commandments of dining.    If the parking lot is almost empty at 5:30 on a Friday then drive away.  That is a telltale sign of a problem place.  We sinned and went inside anyway.  My wine ($11) had a paltry quantity in the glass.  The Rum Island Shrimp ($14.99, in other words $15) tasted like a boxed leftover that had gone bad in the fridge.  I traded it in for a bucket of shrimp but I was charged for the more expensive one even though I sent it back.   The crab stuffed mushroom ($8.99) was good & our server was nice.   The manager must have had the night off because I saw no one resembling a such a title.  Moral of the story: follow the 10 commandments of dining."}
{"text":"I think this place is very much what you would expect from a seafood chain! I ordered a crab cake sandwich that came with fries. It was nothing out of the ordinary, but delicious none the less. My friend ordered fish tacos and love them but wished there was more sauce. I also had a mango margarita that was DELICIOUS, but she got a plain margarita that lacked almost any flavor.   I will say- on a beautiful day when you can sit outside, you probably won't even care about the average food you're eating because the view at station square is spectacular! On a warm spring day with a margarita in my hand looking at the city, it was honestly hard to find any complaints."}
{"text":"The hostess? Hmm... maybe don't pick the greasiest table in the corner for the only black people in the building. Just saying. The waiter? Hmmm.. If I had skin or acne like that I would at least adopt a great attitude. Double eww! The whole staff was totally inhospitable and cold including the insincere gm who never came by any of the tables. I felt like we were at Dick's, or on an episode of punk'd, hah! Not how I wanted to be treated with my mom on her Birthday. That's what we get for trying to find seafood this far from the ocean. Can't wait to take a trip back to California where we can get some \"REAL\" Joe's, yeah baby!! We left probably before the cook even got our main course order. I shouldn't have even had to pay, but the $15 bucks (total for a 1/2 lb order of peel n eat shrimp, which were great, and a cup of clam chowder which in and of itself was a whole other joke) was worth it to know not to EVER step foot inside the tired assed Tempe location ever again, hah! But you all enjoy! ;)  BTW that 1 gold star is for the shrimp."}
{"text":"We enjoyed dinner here tonight.  The best EVER service.  The server (Shawn?) knew the menu, answered all of our questions and gave us just the right amount of attention.  The food was hot and very fresh.  Nice portions for the price.  This is our favorite Crab Shack now!  Amazing!"}
{"text":"Terrible service, the management needs an overhaul. This place has been here for years so it's not going to matter but it's horribly ran at this time. The food was cold upon arrival and the waitress only had our table to wait on and saw to us once. We should have known, the place was empty"}
{"text":"Being a displaced Jersey Shore girl (the year round residents, not the wankers from up north and NY who comprise the cast of the MTV show of the same name)  I have grown up knowing that the best basic seafood comes from little run down looking places, especially fish markets with a few tables outside the front door. I'm not talking about seafood that is done as a form of art such as Eric Ripert executes at Le Bernardin- I'm talking minimal preparation with little more than lemon juice, butter and Old Bay seasoning.  The kind of food you get at the legendary Berkeley Seafood Market in South Seaside Park, or used to get at Spike's market in Point Pleasant before they changed hands and raised prices a decade ago.  I've never been a fan of corporate restaurants, and derisively refer to Red Lobster as the Frog Lobster.  My first experience with Joe's was in Toledo, OH, when they opened up in 1996. Back then they had an overly unctious crab soup my ex was enamored of, and more raw bar offerings. One thing that has been consistent however is the coconut shrimp, and that's why I go there. Unlike most chains and non chains alike that buy the coconut shrimp frozen and pre-breaded, Joe's breads their shrimp to order as fried shrimp should be breaded.    I confess I don't bother to order any of the fish filets or other items at Joe's, but I will say that they get the straightforward items right- crisp fries, fresh coleslaw without too much vinegar, sugar, salt or mayo and balanced in flavor and I do like the chutney like dip for the coconut shrimp. My bf has been going to Florida for over 60 years and he likes the fried shrimp so it must be decent.  Maybe I'll go there the next time I get a yen for classic fish and chips, but living in Buckeye it's easier to just do that at home.  So, everything in life being relative, if you're looking for basic fresh seafood prepared simply, eat at Joe's. Anything more elaborate, wait until you're in a town on a coast."}
{"text":"Not like it used to be!! I used to be a regular here about 10 years ago. The place was always packed and we would get great service. Well....Went back tonight and found it to be over-priced with poor service. No wonder the place was empty.   Shameful."}
{"text":"Second time I eat from this chain, first time in this location.  Drinks were weak, service was \"okay\", food was decent.  I personally find this establishment overpriced and not even fresh enough.  The seafood lacks a natural, well, seafood flare! Lol!  Their seasoning is rather heavy, almost as if they are trying to hide a frozen food taste!!! Also, this location was oddly located by a loud street and not well decorated inside... Overall, not a great seafood lunch/dinner environment.    We rather not come back...."}
{"text":"wow..where to begin...I guess it's really my fault for thinking a chain could do shrimp and grits but the photo looked so good...sucker. When the food finally arrived it was in a cast iron pan and was luke warm..the biscuit was a hockey puck, the shrimp was super gritty...gross.The grits had a weird texture, more like over processed polenta. I thought I could just eat the grits on the second round, they were hot but terrible, I tried hot sauce...that didn't work, it was suppose to have sausage which was exactly 2 small pieces that I had to look for and tasted like processed hot dog. So I paid for the service, left hungry and went somewhere else...how sad never again Joe."}
{"text":"The place was way too loud, could hardly have a convesation. Food was poorly cooked and greasy and way overpriced. Would not recommend and will not be back"}
{"text":"Have visited several JCS over the years in many cities, but this is by FAR the worst as far as the food is concerned. I have great balls of fire for appetizer, HORRIBLE to say the least! They were so dry and overcooked. I asked my waitress for a fresh batch, but she tried to tell me that's how they were suppose to be (as if it were my first time having them). My crab legs were small and tasted watery. I couldn't believe how bad all my food was there! I can't believe the cook is employed there! WRONG COOK! He doesn't have a clue of what he is doing.  I will not return to this location....."}
{"text":"My goodness I Loved the specials they had. Our server was Will and Tuesday night was the perfect time to come. They have $2 appetizers that were so delicious I had to order them twice. I ordered the Bean town bake and it was sooo worth every penny! The best plate I've had in a long time. After, I ordered the sea turtle sundae for dessert and it was a perfect way to end dinner. Definitely coming back more often. Thanks again Will"}
{"text":"This is the place for seafood! Of all our meals in Vegas this stands out most. First off the whole place is a neat sea based place. I would say it almost borders on tacky but doesn't  get all the way to tacky town. Again I don't know the prices but I heard it wasn't actually that bad. We had crayfish? For an appy and they were great. Every fish dish we had was amazing. The service was awesome and the drinks mmmm. In Vegas if you like seafood stop in!"}
{"text":"Damn some of the gift cards I get as a teacher. I feel obligated to use them, even if I'd really rather not. The $30 I just got for Joe's Crab Shack was such a dilemma. So Hubby and I went yesterday since we would be in the area anyway. Our expectations were pretty low, so some elements of the meal actually met or even exceeded those expectations.  We had the seafood fondue appetizer, which was OK, but complete garbage compared to Pappadeaux's. Hubby had the shrimp po-boy which came in a traditional presentation but with fried shrimp that he described as one step above cocktail shrimp. I myself would not have taken it so far, and out of pity, I gave him a bunch of superior shrimp from my platter. I had a reasonably decent mix of coconut, Parmesan panko, and seasoned fried shrimp. I also made the wise choice of asking for a sub of onion rings instead of fries. Hubby's fries were inedible, as if they had been triple fried. Hard as a rock. My onion rings were thin and mostly crispy. At least they tasted fresh.   When the bill came, we were rather shocked. It was pretty pricey at over $40 for lunch. Frankly, I wasn't all that thrilled about spending nearly $20 (with tip) after my gift card was applied. When you consider that we would have gotten a far superior meal at Pete's Fish and Chips for about $12, Joe's is a sad place- no wonder they were practically empty.  UPDATE: I just returned from a wedding where I happened to run into a former student who works at the Joe's at Arizona Mills Mall. She said her store has been rated the best in the Southwest, whereas this Southern & McClintock store is just not very good."}
{"text":"Sometimes a girl just needs steamed crab legs with butter....     Joe's crab tastes like it's been sitting in seawater for a month.  The legs are soft and thin...  Also, the drawn butter tastes like oily movie theater popcorn butter.     I actually prefer Red Lobster!!"}
{"text":"Good solid food and Matt was a great server.  The kids menu was the best I've ever seen."}
{"text":"Went with friends from out of town. French fries were cold, never once filed my water glass and we were there at least two hours. Jumbo coconut shrimp was delicious, service was lacking.brought someone else's refills on crab to our table.  Everyone seemed to enjoy the crab."}
{"text":"I was here for lunch today, the food was okay but the service was terrible. Our server never checked on us and the table next to us had to go find her for drink refills."}
{"text":"Today we stopped in for a few drinks after being here last week and being surprised at how great the happy hour is at this location.  If you sit at the bar and get Cynthia count yourself lucky!  Great service. Drinks are priced right and the food comes out quickly.  Ive seen the bad reviews but I just dont get that. 2 times in 2 weeks and I am a happy camper at this hapoy hour."}
{"text":"Their crappy fish gave my wife food poisoning and their harem of ASU whores made me want to vomit myself. (Not to mention the blue dye they have in their fake pond outside. What the hell is that about?)  I will never go to this horrid place again."}
{"text":"We used to eat here a couple times a month but overall the whole experience has gone downhill and now we stop in once every few months.    Its not bad but not as good as it once was.  The servers have always been nice,  but some are not always as attentive as they should be but for the most part the service is fine.  The shellfish in the Sam Adams steampots seemed to have shrunk and the last few times it and the calamari has been over cooked,  but with everything else (corn,  sausage and potatoes) its still enough to fill me up.    I still enjoy the atmosphere and one of the draws to this place is the playground for my toddler.  He also liked getting up and dancing with the servers but apparently they stopped doing that awhile back."}
{"text":"Oh joes. It's a cookie cutter of a place. If you have been to one you have been to them all. But when it comes to a bucket of crab they do a good job of it. We sat outside and enjoyed the sunset over two great buckets of lobster and crab. But really. I enjoy going about one time a year and they always provide good service and a relaxed very casual setting. It's a little pricy but hey it's crab. This joes is clean and has good service with the food flying out right behind it.  The only bad thing about almost all the joes I have been two is the shrimp is always over cooked. I can tell they toss it in with the crab that takes longer to cook to speed things up but it just comes out a little tough. So avoiding the shrimp in the buckets the other shrimp is always good including the stuffed shrimp. I also really enjoy the crab dip and key lime pie when I get it. For a chain it's a great place and this one in station square is very good."}
{"text":"Love the customer service an and how they dance on ur birthday and at random times...great atmosphere:)"}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure Joe's Crab Shack is one of Pittsburgh's top seafood options, even if some new restaurants have come in and started competing with them for the seafood crown. If it doesn't sit on the seafood throne overlooking the entire city, it definitely rules in Station Square. In fact, the only reason I've detracted a star from Joe's is that I personally think they could use a few more non-seafood items on their menu, but considering the words \"crab shack\" are in the place's name, I really can't hold too much of a grudge on this one.  That said: if you want crab, get on over to Joe's and take a seat somewhere in their eclectic, funky, beach house themed dining area. You'll get an entire bucket of it - as long as you're willing to lighten your wallet a substantial amount. Their steampots, which feature mixed seafood samplers, are also very popular. And of course, most of the appetizers you can get to go with the bucket of crab or other enormous seafood platter are also seafood based. (I highly recommend the stuffed mushrooms.)  My meals and the service alike have never disappointed when I've visited Joe's. I do have one word of caution for my fellow casual dieters out there: nothing is small. If you want to eat healthy during your night out, a salad here will not help you reach that goal. Even the margarita glasses are gargantuan in size; it's hard to even wrap a single hand around them, and they're so heavy at first it may take two hands to pick up the glass without taking the chance that you'll drop the entire thing. The smallest menu items I know of are things like the Sunset Salmon, a well seasoned strip of salmon with potatoes and green beans. It's simple, but yummy - I recommend it.  If you have the time and the money saved to satisfy your craving for some really good fish, this is your home sweet home for a wonderful evening out. Everyone else? Better learn to love seafood quickly. Or just try one of the Square's other restaurants."}
{"text":"Not so good. They seated us at a small table in the middle of the room and right next to a restroom with a noisy swinging slamming door. Service wasn't so great; neither was food. 3 stars for a cool name and fishing pier decorations."}
{"text":"First time at Joe's. had an awesome experience, loved the food, great service. Had the campfire s'mores for dessert...OMG!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend, my daughter and I decided to come here after our IKEA trip, we went to the Robinson location. I have never been there before and I was pleasantly surprised at how good this place was. My boyfriend had the king crab meal. They got him a bib and brought out this big bucket of crab legs, he loved it. I didn't really want crab legs so I ordered the garlicky mussels, some type of steam pot (with crab rice, hush puppies, and shrimp & bacon skewers), It was great especially the shrimp concoction. My daughter got some pizza and fries I think (normal kids stuff). We all shared This Ice cream turtle thing, there was more than enough of it for all of us. Everything was absolutely fabulous and our water Jake was great. We sat outside which has a kids little play area, gives the adults some time to talk and keeps the kids busy. Great place would definitely come back!!!"}
{"text":"Several years ago this place was great.  Now the food is terrible, no taste it tastes bland. And the customer service is worse. When I spoke to the manager about my complaints., they just blew me off. Never again."}
{"text":"Last night we visited this place. First of all, let me start by saying that the wait staff and manager were great.  The food, was a totally different thing.     So they were having a special of $15 lobsters so we ordered a few. When they came out, I was surprised at how tiny they were. The meat from the tail was approximately 2-3 inches long and mushy. They were filled with water so all the meat was not only wet, but cold. The manager took them off the bill and asked if we wanted something else. We were still starving so I asked for some crab legs. He brought me out a side order which was one cluster. I told the waiter that wasn't enough so I ordered 2 more \"sides\" of crab legs. They were fine but not filling. The sides that accompanied the lobsters were boiled, unseasoned potatoes and an ear of plain corn. Flavorless. The hush puppies were meh. So the only person in my party of 3 who was full was my 10 year old who ordered the crab leg dinner. The bill still came to $70 so I don't think I'll be returning because it just wasn't worth the money. Outback Steakhouse has lobster tails for $10.99 and they are 3x the size of these. We get them often. Joes seems like a lot of work and dismantling for little reward. If you're looking to smell like fish and like cracking stuff this is the place, but you may still be hungry when you leave"}
{"text":"Took my family to Joe's Crab Shack for my son's birthday! Matt was the best server we ever had in any restaurant that we've been too. Casey the Manager was super awesome. Great experience all around!! Matt and Casey were totally awesome!!!"}
{"text":"AMAZING! Customer service was great and the food was just delicious. The manager even came up to us and greeted us, and solved any problems. A++"}
{"text":"We went on a Wednesday when there was an unlimited amount of crab to eat for$29. My husband and daughter had snow crab and I had the Singapore Shuckers which was  filling with six oysters,.  We had the garlicky mussels as an appetizer and I had the house Caesar salad.  I thought our meal was tasty and worth it."}
{"text":"This was the worst experience I've ever had. We had a party of five and there was plenty of tables ready to go however we waited over 15 minutes to be seated. They seated us at a table where my family and I were split up. We had to ask to be moved. I ordered fried clams, they messed that up and brought out plain uncooked clams. It took 30-45 minutes to get the correct clams 10 minutes after I got my food. My crab was way over cooked. My moms food came out cold. We had to wait over 5 minutes just to get forks. They didn't even try to offer to take the clams off my bill after messing it up so much. It seemed like no one knew what they were doing or how to do their jobs. I was very disappointed with my experience. If I could leave a zero star I definitely would."}
{"text":"How do restaurants like Joe's Crab Shack thrive?  Let me tell you a little story.  It might sound like I'm complaining about my (future) in-laws, but I'm not.  I promise.  My fiance's parents love the Crab Shack.  Every year, we all spend a week in Coronado, California for a much-needed escape from the desert.  Every year, we find ourselves driving across the bridge into San Diego in search of a crappy seafood dinner courtesy of Joe and his under-motivated teenage staff.  Every year, my meal both amazes and disappoints me.  How awful is a restaurant when it just keeps getting worse?  I am totally certain that the kitchen contains nothing but enormous bags of frozen seafood and deep-fryers the size of swimming pools.  One time, we had a waiter that kept calling all the men \"bro.\"  I am not your bro.  I am paying for and eating food that would get even a Red Lobster cook fired and, as such, am entitled to no less than five-star treatment.  If there is anything positive to say, it is that the bibs they hand out to people eating crab are HILARIOUS.  I've got the pictures to prove it.  I'll visit the Shack once per year out of obligation.  I'll even be (sort of) happy to do it, considering those close to me seem to love it and I'm not going to rain on their parade.  You will never ever ever ever ever ever find me at one in Arizona, however.  Ever!"}
{"text":"I only am giving three stars because I ah-dore the Great White shark hanging from the ceiling and their extensive line of witty teeshirt (crabs?). Otherwise, my first, and probably last visit to Joe's was nothing but a vibrantly colored-glorified Red Lobster.  I was super excited to go because, ahem!, I like to eat crab and the place looks funfully inviting. AND IT IS (again, super witty tees)! I enjoy the colors, I enjoy the \"wharfy\" planks I had to carefully walk over in my stilettos, and hello? the commercials are pretty catchy, too.  Amber was a sweetheart. She grabbed a shark toy (cocktail flare) to give to my 2 year old nephew, gave her feedback on menu items, was bubbly, and thought everything we were ordering was delicious! I like her.  The calamari was boring and boring. My kid and I love calamari but this wasn't it. I'm pretty sure it was served with marinara sauce, not cocktail (where's the bit o' kick?). My....(wait, what did I order?)...oh yeah! My crab cake sandwich DID SAY it was served on an english muffin. Never before have I been so put off with consuming an english muffin - room temp, white, bleh. Tomato slice and shredded lettuce on the side. Some remoulade sauce (which I used to slather into my sandwich) was the hit the plate. My daughter got the crab nachos. They were yummy the next day. Sis-in-law had coconut shrimp & fries. I think she ate it. I had one and it was pretty good. But can you ever go wrong with coconut shrimp? IDK?   In all, I'm pretty sure I won't be back to a Joe's Crab Shack. Okay, okay, maybe to grab a witty teeshirt."}
{"text":"Food always tastes amazing but the pictures are deceiving. They look over flowed but when i got my steam pot it was barely full of crab legs. The service was a bit slow and uncomfortable, we kept getting asked if we were done while we were still eating crab, just felt unwanted or the table was needed. We were without drinks for a good 10 min waiting for refills, our server seemed busy but unsure. Crab is always amazing but stick with regular 1 1/4 lb pots no specials pots, you get jipped."}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot to get food. Jesus was a great host. He has a good attitude and is one of my favorite servers there. The food was also amazing!"}
{"text":"Went inside with my boyfriend around 10pm on a Thursday and it was a ghost town. Sat ourselves at the bar and waited five minutes. Saw two servers walk into the bathroom but no one greeted us and no bartender appeared, nobody came to talk to us! Left and went somewhere else! RED FLAG."}
{"text":"Joe's Crab Shack is definitely not the freshest or finest seafood in Phoenix, nor does it pretend to be, but it sure as heck gets the job done.    I usually visit with my coworker when we have \"meetings\" that really just turn into us drinking and being social adults. (We work with kids)  We've been there quite a few times and I like the fact that they do not rush us out when we're done eating.    They've got great service, and a pretty kitschy atmosphere, but hey, it's a chain and it works.  As mentioned before their food isn't the best seafood I've eaten, but it's pretty dang good. (And what I've sampled from their drink menu, well that's good stuff too!)"}
{"text":"Have to agree; probably the worst place for \"seafood\" around. And the corporate atmosphere reminds me of outback or chilis.... enough said."}
{"text":"It was alright... nothing special. My mahi Mahi taco was dry as hell. I used my cheese from my chips for my taco. I asked the waitress for an extra side of cheese she told me it was $5.99 for a small plastic container of cheese. Smh."}
{"text":"I took my mom here for  an early mothers day lunch. Our server was Cody who was nice but didn't bother letting us know there was a special going on. I overheard other servers telling their tables. We ordered the classic sampler the dip and the balls of fire were delicious but the calamari was chewy and there was some kind of clam strips that were extremely tough. I ordered the arctic steampot. The shrimp corn and potatoes were awesome but the lobster was super overcooked and tough and the queen crab was so over cooked I couldn't crack the shell because it was so rubbery. The crab meat inside did taste good what little of it was there. My mom had the main grill and her lobster was way overcooked and rubbery and didn't looked grilled at all. She said her shrimp was good and the dirty rice was good as well. We split an crumble with ice cream for dessert that was really amazing. I dont know why the seafood was so bad this visit I wish I could get some of the money back. I did not get what I paid for which ended up being $86 not including the tip.Previous visit was amazing, what happened. Sorry mom"}
{"text":"Came for the 19.99 all you can eat special. Coconut, fried, and peel and eat shrimp. Delicious. Ate so much and still was.able to take alot home. Server was great too."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was a 3, value was 2, service was 2. Fairly loud but it's expected. Got appetizer and 2 meals with soda and total came to a little over 55$ which wouldn't be bad if the food tasted better. Waiter was fast but I drink a ton of soda and only checked on us 2x with my 2nd refill of soda being as I got the check. My wife likes this place but I like angry crab shack a little better I think."}
{"text":"Not a bad place to stop.  Sat at the bar first, got served well and fast.  Friends came in and I moved to their table.  Bar staff was great helping me move and even served my friends before the waitress who was to serve us came around.  I have to say the food was decent and tasty.  I had the seafood sampler - Crab dip, fire balls and calamari.   All three warm and tasty.  My only sad thing is moving to the table.  This young waitress needs to find another job.  She not only was having a bad day, which everyone can have.  But she had t with an attitude of she was in the right at all times.  Even when the bar tender came and helped out.   So sad.  Wish I had never moved.  The service was horrid with this young lady."}
{"text":"Great food but the customer service is lacking. They got our table mixed up and seated us in the wrong area and then got our food order wrong. They did correct it and the food was delicious. They have a nice playground by the patio so the kids can play while we have drinks. The kids really liked their kids menu as well."}
{"text":"Came in on a Sunday afternoon and was honestly surprised at the flavors of our seafood.    We ordered the 1/2 pound peel & eat shrimp spiced Hot for $9.99 and they were delicious.    Then we ordered the Classic Sampler for $12.49 which had a bunch of different seafoods, my fav was the bacon wrapped shrimp on a skewer.    Our entree was the East Coast Platter w 2 nice fish filets, fries and other seafoods on it.  A bit pricy at $19.49 but still pretty good.    Service was a bit inattentive- more concerned with texting on her phone instead of taking care of customers but ultimately we had what we wanted, mostly when we wanted, so I can't fault the restaurant for that.    Gotta give them 4 stars for the freshness & flavor of the food."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch as I had received an e-mail offering a free appetizer with the purchase of an entrée for today only.    The place was about 25% full and I was greeted right away by the hostess.  Dining alone, I told her I'd be sitting at the bar.  It only took Joella a couple minutes to come over and offer me a drink.  I opted for ice water with lemon.  She handed me a menu and gave me a few minutes to decide on lunch.  She noticed the menu closed and sitting on the bar and came back over to take my order.  I ordered the Crab Nacho's ($10.59) and the Blackened Mahi Taco's ($11.59).  The nacho's came in about 10 minutes.  They were a mountain of salty chips with shredded lettuce, diced tomatoes, corn, black beans, guacamole 'spread' and some crab flavored mushy stuff that was the color of buffalo chicken dip.  It wasn't bad... but it wasn't good.  I got through about half of it and a full glass of water before deciding to stop to check my blood pressure.  Joelle offered me a to-go container and I accepted- I hate to leave food.    My Mahi Taco's arrived (3 of them) which consisted of a decent 'tender' of broiled fish, some shredded cabbage, diced tomatoes & onions and (I think) a drizzle of that same guacamole dip.  I added hot sauce.  They were accompanied by a small handful of those same salty chips and a small cup of pico de gallo to spread on them.  The fish was a little on the dry side, it could have been pulled off the broiler a few minutes sooner but the taco 'wrapper' was nicely warmed and stayed together rather well.    I don't want to bash the place seeing all the other reviews but this visit did not leave me with a good taste in my mouth and I don't see any reason to return (to this one or any others)..."}
{"text":"Plenty of free parking. Never been to a Joe's Crab Shack so this was a first for me. I know this may not be a fair review because I had their sirloin steak but I don't eat seafood. Service was friendly and attentive. I had the sirloin steak (med) but it came more well done. I got it with a side of broccoli (over cooked and mushy) and coleslaw (pretty good). The steak was served with a bottle of A1 steak sauce, which always concerns me, because that usually means the steak flavor isn't that good, which proved to be this case. Even the people in my group who did get various seafood items said the food was ok. Overall....ok."}
{"text":"Awful!   Cold food.   Cold server.  Cold manager.  No service recovery.    When asking to have food that was BURNT returned and make it over, the waitress just grabbed the food off the plate and took it away.     Manager made excuse after excuse with responsibility.     Ya think 1-2 bucks off the bill?   Nope!   First and last time here!"}
{"text":"Wait wasn't too long. Food was good. But, we had all gotten our dinners and the appetizer never came. So I told the waitress I no longer wanted it. We were more than 10 minutes into our dinner and she brought it anyways. I told her again I didn't want it. She left it at the table and Frickin charged me for it. Not cool. My son didn't want to make a fuss and paid it. Not worth the drive across town."}
{"text":"I love the food at Joe's Crab Shack. I eat here whenever I am in Station Square."}
{"text":"Joe's is your typical cajun seafood restaurant.  The signature food here is the giant seafood steampots. There are several different steampot mixes and each one comes with an assortment of seafood, which includes lobster, crab, shrimp, crawfish, sausages, potatoes, and corn.  My biggest issue was that the seafood wasn't too fresh. It was also heavily seasoned, which seemed to intentionally mask the age of the seafood. The restaurant was also very loud and chaotic.  Joe's didn't meet my expectations of other restaurants with the same concept that I have been to in California.  --  taste / 3 aesthetics / 2 vibe / 2 service / 2 price for quality / 3 OVERALL / 2.4"}
{"text":"Just wanted to let you know that service and food were excellent this visit.  But the best part was our server, Mike (buff Mike!).   What we asked for he was right on it.  Extra HOT butter - done.  Offered cole slaw - done.  Hot water with EXTRA lemons after dinner - done.  We gave him about 22% tip - way over above anyone ever gets most of the time.  Remember that the word TIPS means To Insure Prompt Service.  We didn't need to insure anything with Mike - thank you !"}
{"text":"Yikes.. I should have checked the Yelp before going here for my FIRST EVER CRAB LEGS EXPERIENCE. Is this place specifically designed to annoy? As we sat there eating very mediocre crab (it's not supposed to taste really fishy right?), the volume of the music doubled and all of the employees line danced to \"COTTON EYED JOE\" by Rednex which is possibly the most annoying song of all time. This lasted roughly two minutes and was followed by a Smashmouth song. To add to the annoyance factor, there are multicolored Christmas lights strewn throughout the restaurant and the staff wears tie-dye shirts. Thinking about it is giving me a headache. Would maybe go back as a joke. The hush puppies were good."}
{"text":"This is the 3rd time I've been to this location and the food & service is always top notch.  We went for Valentine's Day earlier this year and they rocked our socks off.  This time I was on vacation and the wife 7 I decided to have lunch at Joe's and we couldn't be happier.  We went around 1 PM. and we got seated right away and our server Tara was awesome.  She recommended a Pina Colada drink served in a whole, cored out frosted pineapple.  This drink was the bomb and if you love Pina Coladas you need to order this.  We started out with a sampler appetizer and a bowl of clam chowder.  I then ordered a Arctic Steam pot and my wife ordered the East Coast Fish platter.  No matter what time of day you come, there food is always fresh and tasty.  I love crab legs and I can't find a better place in town to enjoy crab legs that aren't hard to break or the shells being soft from over cooking.  I love this location so much.  Keep up the good work Joe's!"}
{"text":"As always food was great Derek was excellent server suggesting many items and we got in on the happy hour today Drinks we had a Hurricane  delicious in fact we had a couple each  ..appetizers was only ,$5.00 each so we had a couple of them .but the crab combo was to die for. Really good"}
{"text":"Alex was great, smiled all the time and made sure we were taken care of. It made Sunday lunch so much better"}
{"text":"I love this place. Everytime I come and visit my sister we come here for dinner. We both love their steamer buckets. Their crab nachos are awesome, the crab dip is great, the sam adams steam pot and basically any pot with crab is amazing too. We always order 1 pound of crawfish on the side too- and they do them perfectly! I love the cocktails too- especially the shark attack one or whatever its called thats blue. yum. we always have THE BEST service from Toni (we always get the same person lol). I love it here and if I was to complain at all it would be that my lobster claws in my steamer bucket were a bit overdone last time. its also a tad bit pricey but it is seafood. also, its good for kids cause they have a fun outdoor area for them to play."}
{"text":"We visit here once a year after working an event.  We've come here for 5+ years and it is now our guild tradition.  Always a large party.  We have always had amazing service, great food, and unending patience as we can be quite rowdy at times.  Or servers have always been personable and playful.  Food is always great.  Only disappointment was this year there was no carwash or macarena dancing... But we made up for it with our own sword fight.  I look forward to our annual visit and can't wait for next year!!"}
{"text":"the place was okay, i went there saturday night. when I entered i noticed the music right away. every time i had passed by the place going to the mall i always wondered what it would be like to eat there, but ive gone to eat mostly everywhere in the west valley and all over the south  phoenix. so my boyfriend and i gave it a try.  when we entered it felt like they were trying a bit too hard to give you the \"beach\" feeling. i thought it was somewhat corny, i think some of the food was over priced and it wasn't as good as i thought it would be. its more of big family atmosphere, they drink i had was going to get had alcohol in it, it was super strong or maybe because i hadnt ate all day until then. I had asked the waitress if i could have it without alcohol but she insisted that it was better with it so i went for it. I ate the shrimp alfredo and my boyfriend had a burger. the alfredo was alright nothing to special about it, but the burger and fries were BOMB!. dont get me wrong i love my seafood but i dont know about their seafood seems kind of funky.  i would say go to the waffle house across the street. 2pm - 9pm all you can eat.   and the food is better and a lot less expensive."}
{"text":"I'm kinda bummed that this place lived up to the bad reviews. The hosts seemed to have no clue what they were doing. They seated tables that were obviously still dirty which was gross. The drinks took a while and the food took 25 minutes. The server was cute and friendly but didn't save the meal unfortunately. The staff stopped and danced which was cute but I wish they had payed a little more attention to their tables instead. I ordered the blackened mahi sandwich. It came with a big piece of fish on a cheap bun with lettuce and tomato. It needed something else. I had to use the sauce from my friends crab cake sandwich to give it more flavor. A manager came and checked on us but only briefly. I wish the experience was better than it was. Unfortunately I probably won't go back here."}
{"text":"I will never return to this restaurant.  I have seen the commercials and decided to try the place out.  1st thing that I noticed was that every plate is 1/2 full with fries and/or fried onions.  I love fries and fried onions but when I'm paying around $17-20+ a plate the fries had better come on an extra plate.  I felt like the food was mediocre for the expensive price.  I decided to return again and ordered the crab cakes, big mistake.  The things smelled and tasted rancid, and I'm not using that term figuratively.  They exchanged them for some fired shrimp but the damage had been done.  Again the prices were way too much for below par food and the amount of plate filler is unacceptable.  To top it off both times I was there the place seems to have staff, mainly teenagers, standing around chatting but no one is doing any work.  Bad food, high prices and poor service pretty much sums up this gem.  If you're in the mood for seafood I would strongly recommend against this place."}
{"text":"I was in need of assistance! I had a disabled friend with me, and she really wanted crab legs. I asked if someone could help us at the table cracking legs for her, and the manager, Donny was just delighted to assist! He was fast and was very funny too! Thank you for making our Easter outing a happy and less complicated gathering!!  Let Donny know you saw him on Yelp!!"}
{"text":"A really nice place for seafood and lotsa crab! Jesus was our server, took care of us helping with suggestions for the perfect Boil Pot for us...a nice time and a great meal! I"}
{"text":"I want to be a fan, but I'm just not. Everything is WAY overpriced for the quality. I've had one of the steam pots at a different location about five years ago and it was OK. I opted for steamed shrimp and the hush puppies. The shrimp was exactly that. Shrimpy...as in the kid that played kick ball in third grade with you that you let run to the bases. That kid was also a little dirty, too. So was my shrimp. Yick to uncleaned shrimp.The hush puppies were pretty good.  They did have a list of appetizers that were half off during happy hour which is a good deal...but they should be that price all the time for what is offered.  I will give this place 5 stars for service. We had a very large group and they accommodated VERY well. Kudos to that."}
{"text":"Yelp, you need a minus star system!  It has always been my practice not to enter a restaurant with dirty windows. But it was between lunch and dinner so we gave them the benefit of the doubt. We were seated promptly and once settled in we noticed at least 3 dirty tables. There was some sort of  (blaring) techno dance music that sounded like the soundtrack for a gay porn movie playing.The waiter took our drink order (a beer and a glass of water) and they wait began. After what seemed like a long time he returned with 2 waters and asked if we were ready to order. I chuckled and asked him if they had to go to Germany for the beer. He apologized and said the bar was backed up. Now mind you the bar was empty and there were a total of 4 tables occupied. When he returned with the beer he set it on the table (did not offer to pour ) next to the glass. About this time the staff decided it was time to clean the dirty tables. These kids have obviously never been trained on serving or bussing a table. The clatter of glassware and dishes was a welcome change from the loud music however. Finally someone dropped a few dishes and they crashed to the floor. When they came out with a broom and dust pan we suddenly realized the charcoal gray floor had a film on it from a poor mop job from some time in the past. Once the clean up was complete the broom and dustpan remained propped against the table for the rest of our stay.  We decided on a pot that consisted of crab, clams, mussels, hot link and shrimp. When it arrived it was luke warm and no melted butter. The server trotted back to the kitchen and did not return until we flagged the manager down to ask about the butter. By now the pot was cold!  Now lets talk about the food: Its obvious these pots are pre-portioned and put in net bags where they are dropped in hot water to cook. There is little to no quality control. There is very little broth ladled into the bottom of the pot and the net bag is set on top. So the ingredients in the pot are not cooked in the broth described in the menu. The food here is not prepared it is assembled. Clams: minuscule and tough Mussels: Non descript and dry Crab. Nice looking shells full of air and very little crab. Shrimp: Mushy Hot link: unable to cut with the knife provided.  The bucket in the middle of the table (for shells) had not been thoroughly cleaned from the last diners and the roll of paper towels was damp on one end. These towels serve as napkins.   Word to the wise. Stick to the dirty window, do not enter practice."}
{"text":"Oh my God, this definitely isn't my type of restaurant. I hate having my dinner conversation interrupted with disco lights and an extremely loud version of the YMCA. Children probably love this restaurant because of how loud and colorful it is. And for birthdays they usually have the guest of honor dance around in fairy wings or some other Halloween costume accessory. So I guess this would also be a good restaurant to take someone for their birthday if you really want to embarrass them.  Never the matter, I hate all of it. But despite the obnoxiousness that is guaranteed to accompany my meal, I continue to frequent Joe's Crab Shack because their crab steampots are sooo effing good and only run about $20-25 each. Oh and the crab nachos are pretty good too.  I don't really have much else to say about the food because those are about the only things I order when I'm there. But I've been there at least once almost every day of the week, at different hours, and I've never had to wait more than two or three minutes for a table.   A quick tip though: Don't sit outside unless you have a big selection of where to sit. The outside tables are like wooden picnic tables and many of them mysteriously wet or slimy because of week-old ketchup that was spilled and never completely cleaned off."}
{"text":"I've been here twice so far because a family friend enjoys the food, but personally I wouldn't recommend it.   On the first visit, I shared a steam pot with my boyfriend. Our server was great but the food was extremely salty. For almost $50, we expected enough food to at least be satisfied, but we left hungry.   Tonight we returned, and he and I chose separate menu items in the hopes that the food quality/quantity would be better. I think it was worse! The iced tea was watery, the food was bland, and they charged over $14 for like 10 tiny shrimps, a small portion of soggy broccoli, and a scoop of pico rice that tastes better coming from Del Taco. To top it all off, our server was inattentive and we had to call him over for multiple things because being polite didn't work on him (We hate \"summoning\" servers; we know you're busy. We aren't impatient people. But if you are ignoring one of your FOUR tables, there's a problem.) He collected the check and his $15 tip without even saying goodbye. Either he's just totally rude or someone needs to train him better.   Anyway. I don't want to come here again anytime soon. We're better off spending money at a cheap buffet for seafood."}
{"text":"I just recently ate here for the first time in years. I remember it being much better. All around, this was an awful experience. We were sat quickly and greeted by our server relatively fast. After that it goes downhill. Every drink we ordered (alcoholic or not) took 15 to 20 minutes and on several occasions, I had to wave the server down for bibs or drinks or dining utensils. The food was mediocre. I remembered it as having a fresh taste and everything tasted like it had been frozen for weeks before cooking. I had the grilled salmon and it was chewy. Overall, it was awful."}
{"text":"We travel to Las Vegas a couple of times each year. This time we were in the mood for seafood and decided on Joe's Crab Shack. We've eaten at a number of these in a number of different places over the years and always enjoyed the crab pots. The one here in Las Vegas is pretty much a cookie-cutter version of most of the others.  We were pretty early. We asked for a table in the bar area for happy hour but they only had four tables and all were taken. They offered us a seat at the bar but my wife is not physically able to get up on or sit on those high bar stools, and they would not accommodate us with a booth adjacent to the booths in bar area... Apparently somebody else's seating area. No exceptions.   Other than that the meet, greet, and seat was per usual. The server came over and took our drink orders, brought menus, and since we were having our usual, the crab bucket done with the fire grilled spices, she took our appetizer and dinner order as well.   Everything arrived within a reasonable timeframe. And true to form, mussels (appetizer) and the Andouille sausage was excellent, as were the shrimp, potatoes, and corn on the cob. Absent were the clams though. Must be a cost cutting measure. The crab was good but a little mushier than we are used to getting from Joe's Crab Shacks.   Our server less attentive than most of the servers we have ever had at any Joe's. She just kind of set things down and flittered off, only stopping by to check on us once. Not much for words. After dinner she just dropped off our check and disappeared ... Oh well, we will do dessert at home...  The food was good enough. Our server wasn't. But we will eat here again. We will just make sure to get a different server."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in for lunch here today.  The service was very friendly, but could have been more attentive.  The food was very good.  The Sam Adams Boil was on point.   If I could give a 3.5 I would.  My wife wanted me to round it up on this one and that is the 4 star ratine."}
{"text":"This past Thursday night I was at Joe's and I chose to sit outside. Big mistake. It took me about 20 minutes to get a menu and about another 30 for someone to come take my order. The only reason that my order was taken was because I had to flag down another waitress who was very abrupt with me and told me that she would find my server. My food took about another 30 minutes to receive at which time my steak was overcooked and leathery. I didn't want to say anything because then I would be waiting another 30 minutes to eat again. Needless to say, the experience was not a good one. I wonder why they have outside seating if they are going to ignore us and treat us like we are not paying customers?"}
{"text":"Terrible experience:  should receive ZERO stars.  *We order Coconut Shrimp, this should be call OIL  shrimp.   *We order Grill Salmon was complete burn, black from both sides.  *We complain to the manager on duty about the burn salmon and he said: that i did not like \"\"the black flavor\"\".  This thing was incinerate, and sure full of  carcinogenic substances do to the ashes.  *Was our daughters birthday, we told the hostess, and our  daughter got zero attention  regarding her birthday no song or even a congratulation.   *Was our the worst dining experience ever!!!! :("}
{"text":"The food wasn't fresh at all. Slim to no seasoning at all. Good service but prices were waaaaay too high for the quality. Is recommend hot n juicy if you want good quality sea food."}
{"text":"From the hostess to the waitress and even the fun balloon lady.... This place has HANDS DOWN the best customer service.   Nasheema was our waitress. While ordering I casually said how I wanted the easier crab to crack for my daughter as I always spend my time cracking hers and never get to eat. This wonderful girl offered to crack hers so I could eat. That's just going above and beyond.   The balloon lady remembered us from last time and was just so sweet.   Other than the ac is broken and we are a lil chilly.... We love this place."}
{"text":"Came here on valentines day with a girlfriend. We had to wait over an hour which was expected, I didn't mind. I was just ready to eat! Been here a handful of times and I'm just not a fan of joes crab shack. Feel like seafood? Check out boiling crab or hot n juicy!  Anyways while we were waiting a little boy who was with his family went to go ask the hostess how much longer. I believe his family sent him. I went up there to ask how much longer the same time. The hostess( blonde hair, young, and had a nose piercing) was not even acknowledging the people walking up. They had to talk to her. The little boy finally got her attention and ask how much longer. She holds up the two sheets full of names and says this is how many people are waiting. The little boy walks away and tells his family. Mom was furious and speaks to the manager. The hostess heard everything and wasn't too happy. Everyone of her co workers that walked up she told what had happened and even pointed at the lady who complained! I just found it to be very unprofessional and rude. My friend and I both work in a restaurant and there is no way that would have been allowed. I understand it's crazy busy, but that girls behavior was ridiculous. When she called our name, she tells us wow you guys get a booth. That's what you get for being patient. I don't know what she meant by that.   Next off the food. Anything fried there is pretty good. I don't eat unhealthy but I figure it valentines day, so wth. My friend and I shared the sampler! It was pretty good. I asked for a Caesar salad sub balsamic dressing on the side. I reminded him twice and it still came out wrong. Our waiter (an older gentleman) knew too but chose not to say anything and I didn't want to complain.  So I ate it. I gave this a low rating because I don't plan on returning,   The food is not that good. And my overall experience was not that great. gosh I'm still shocked on how that hostess reacted."}
{"text":"I came here on a Tuesday evening for dinner while working in the area. It's a pretty big restaurant, and was almost empty when we arrived. Over the course of the meal, one other couple was seated by us, but it was pretty quiet otherwise.  We were seated immediately and our server, Kate, was very nice. I ordered the crab cake dinner, which came with hush puppies, fries, and coleslaw. I felt it was a generous amount of food. I liked the crab cakes and the slaw was really tasty. The hush puppies were slightly savory and spicy, but I'm very sensitive to spiciness so it's possible that they aren't really that spicy to other people.  My friend got a steak, which looked appropriately medium rare. She seemed satisfied with it. She also got a side salad that looked more like an entree size to me. The vegetable of the day was broccoli and carrots.   This wound up being one of the more expensive meals we got in the area, coming out to around $40 before tips for the both of us. However, I thought that was reasonable given what we ordered. The restaurant is located near some other restaurants and there is plenty of parking nearby."}
{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised how good the food was for a chain restaurant. It came quickly and was tasty and well cooked for seafood. Our waiter seemed to be a little all over the place. He was making drinks at the bar and serving several tables as well which seemed to be a little much. However that being said, he handled us very well and never disappointed us. Go Chris!"}
{"text":"Quality seafood at a reasonable price. I was shocked how fresh the crab was. The $1 oysters special was very fresh. The shrimp and calamari was great.   What they may lack in decor and sophisticated table settings (it's paper towels, buckets and bibs on a wood table) Joe's Crab shack makes up for in real quality seafood.   The server Eddie was great and the manager Paul were both very accommodating and checked up on us.   Best part is the sports game and the \"sand lot\" where the kids can play in the playground while the adults can enjoy their meal.   There is nothing fancy about this place but it warrants 5 stars for value and quality of food."}
{"text":"Let's start this honestly...I'm difficult. I want things my way and I've a tendency to make...minor changes to menu items. That being said, HOLY CUSTOMER SERVICE!  Go in, ask for Nick then relax. He'll give you exactly what you ask for and he'll anticipate your every need."}
{"text":"Where do I start?  Waited a long time to get seated. Waited a long time to get drinks. Waited a long time to place an order. Waited a long time to get our food, refill, etc. Waited a long time to get out of here. We basically just waited and waited and waited.  Lobster and crab were cold and like rubber. No hot melted butter!? It was nothing special.  Worst part of it was I tipped 15% and the girl still called me out in front of everyone. \"Oh was everything OK because you only tipped this much.\" Blah blah blah... And on our way out we she was still complaining. I was being nice when I tipped, really should have given them NO TIP or a bill for wasting my time.  I don't know what she was thinking but someone clearly doesn't belong in the hospitality industry.  Definitely the last time at this location."}
{"text":"My wife and I had dinner here. It's better than red lobster. Nice atmosphere, open and kid friendly. Good variety. When you add up everything you need to order for a complete dinner......it's not cheap. The fish seems very fresh. It's a chain, but it is an above average chain. The food was prepared well, and the service was good."}
{"text":"So delicious! I had the burger with the shrimps. I'll be going back for buckets :) my server was ehhh, maybe she was having a bad day.  Someone else was happy to help me though :)"}
{"text":"I will always love you Joe's!!!!!! No matter where I go in life. I still have all the toy sharks I got with my drink in my tub from you guys !!! I love them! And even tho I can't eat crab legs anymore I still love you !!!!"}
{"text":"We really only go here for the play ground, the food is okay, the drinks are great and the service is always great."}
{"text":"When I walked in I knew I was in trouble. Everyone was more interested in dancing than seating me.  Then they handed me off to a server who took me to her section, but the only tables she had were huge tables - and I was a party of one. So I said, no problem- I'll just eat at the bar.  I went to the end of bar and found an empty seat. After a couple of minutes I was able to get the attention of a bartender to help me. He was pleasant and took my order.  My side salad came out super fast and my appetizer of stuffed mushrooms did not take long either. Both were good - nothing amazing, but tasty.  Then I waited for my fish. Grilled Mahi over rice with a side of coleslaw and broccoli - pretty simple.  The lady next to me sat down after my app arrived and ordered a drink and a burger.   After about 15 minutes the bartender said, let me check on your food (never saw him again). Another 5 minutes and the woman's food arrived. Then I said to a different bartender - do I need to catch my own fish? Yes - my patience was thin.   The bartender went in the back and came back 60 seconds later with a steaming hot meal for me. He did apologize and the food was average/good. Nothing special.  Also sitting at the bar, myself and the woman next to me were freezing. The cold air blowing full blast on us. She was lucky to have a jacket, which she put on to eat - I just  froze.  I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Great ambience! Beside the river, city view, within a few feet of a train track, and food is good for a chain. Eat outside! Service is excellent. Everytime I have eaten here the manager has walked over to ask how everything is."}
{"text":"I am pretty easy to please when it comes to eating in restaurants and I was definitely happy with this restaurant.  The food was good, it took a little while to come out but they were busy.  It's pretty easy to mess up a bloody mary and theirs was fantastic.  The lobster claws were a little over cooked but still pretty tasty.  The crawfish were good and spicy.  The staff was courteous and the manager came over to check on us.  Our server had forgotten something with one of our orders just as the manager came over and when it was brought to his attention he brought it out himself and apologized.  I will definitely go back and recommend it to my friends."}
{"text":"When we got here we were seated right away. The whole resturant was LOUD! Now our waitress was pretty attentive to us. The food {not really amazing} was served nice and hot. The beer was nice and cold. Really wish I could of talked my wife into Outback. There I said it."}
{"text":"We've seen commercials here in the Bay for Joe's...but we've never visited one until we drove by one in Vegas last week.  We walked in not really expecting too much (I was yelping as we were walking in!)...but lo and behold!  We ordered a few (yes, a few!) buckets of crabs and wow!  They were SO tasty!  AND, they didn't have any snow crabs that day, and had to substitute Dungeness for Snow....so we got a lot more for our money!  I think this is the first time that I've ever gotten full off of crabs sans rice!  Though we didn't have vinegar with garlic and salt....the butter did just fine!    Service was also great and we were all glad that we FINALLY got to experience Joe's!  Now it's time to make like a tourist and head over to San Francisco!"}
{"text":"So disappointed! Paid about $25 for tasteless Dungeness crab legs. Even the butter was tasteless. Just awful! ... And the karaoke sucked as well. Who has karaoke at 5pm?"}
{"text":"We went to Joe's Crab Shack on Southern Ave for the first time last night for a birthday dinner. For a Tuesday night it was very empty but almost everyone was there for a bday celebration . Our waiter was Ian and extremely attentive and speedy. The food was excellent though I am glad for a good steak lol. Tuesday's are a great deal for select appetizers and drinks for $2. But do be wary of purchasing gift cards online as the bait and switch on the extra $5 promo for purchase is not good till another future visit. The waiters/waitresses do make a great performances for each birthday celebration !"}
{"text":"Personally I don't care for the \"wAcky\" environment with the servers running around singing YMCA, etc. and the prices are a little high for what you get.  But it always tastes good, the crab is fresh and we manage to make it here every other month or so.  From what I see outside, there is a good looking playground so if you bring kids they'll have a great time.  All in all, nothing to write home about...and if you want lots of crab a good buffet is better, but still enjoyable and good for a change of pace."}
{"text":"I use to love this place and couldn't get enough. But not anymore. The food is gross, I had musscles that were dry, that must have been made at 8am and then served for lunch. I am fairly forgiving but this happend on more then one occassion.  I wouldn't be surprised  to see this place go out of business."}
{"text":"Here's the main reason I'm giving it 5 Stars, Customer Service. My husband and I got there about 4pm on a Saturday. They had a 30 minute wait time. Since there were available seats at the bar we decided to sit there while we waited for our table.  Our bartender Elizabeth, personable, friendly, courteous, multi-tasker. This young lady was on top of it! They had a rush and got crazy for awhile. The smile from her face never faded. If she took a tad too long she was apologetic, her customer service was on point. So guess what??? When our table was ready we decided to stay at the bar and order there!  The food was good the service was better! Thank you Elizabeth for your great customer service. Service likes yours makes people want to come back."}
{"text":"I went here because of a massive craving for shellfish and it is not far from my house. I was sadly disappointed in almost every component of this experience.  Service: Honestly some of the worst service I've ever had. After ordering a cocktail, I was very disappointed when after 20 minutes my server returned to my table, noticed I didn't have my drink yet and said \"No one brought your drink?\" It is a huge pet peeve when servers do not take responsibility for their tables and it seemed this is what he was doing. My drink ended up coming, but a few minutes after my food. Two other factors played into this horrible service experience. My table was about three tables away from the computer the servers used to ring up orders, and I heard one of the servers very loudly talk about how he was \"screwed out of a tip\" by a table. Very unprofessional. Finally, the manager of the restaurant did not really seem to care about his restaurant. He stood near the bar socializing with a young woman the entire time I was there, not once did he leave to check on tables or do any work. The only reason I even knew he was the manager was because the servers kept coming up to him with questions.  Food: My food was served cold. Despite being in a steam pot...and it was all incredibly over-cooked. It was like they had steamed my shellfish and then let it sit in the steamer for hours before it was given to me. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Service was great, the waitress was very polite and helpful, she continued to come back and help when need but not too pushy. Food was good but not great, could have definitely been better. Overall was a decent experience, service definitely made it worth it but food was lackluster."}
{"text":"I haven't been to JCS in Las Vegas. In California it has been over 10 years. My mom-in-law was visiting and wanted to stop by the JCS off Rainbow. It was not busy which was a good thing. The atmosphere was pleasant. The food was nothing special. She enjoyed the food, but for me it was average. I had the crab cakes, French fries, and slaw. The watermelon sangria was delicious. She had a Queen Crab boil which she said was seasoned perfect. I tried it, but I thought it was too bland."}
{"text":"I give it three stars since the first time it was outstanding. We are there two weeks ago and simply loved it actually raved about it so on another trip last night to be exact 12/22/16 we took our daughter and her family there. It started off good but went downhill from there. Jake our server seemed to be into his job but after the initial order taking seemed to disappear. My wife and I order the same meal as we did last time the food didn't even come close to tasting the same way overestimate seasoned and just plain terrible but Jake who took our order but didn't bring it out was gone honestly just ruined Joe's Crab Shack for me I like when I get the same meal it taste the same every time or at least close. It's a sad day shame the other Joes is out of the way.  Now I know why it's so empty the times we went hopefully you'll go on a night when the cooks are good"}
{"text":"As a flight attendant....I had the unfortunate circumstance of having a layover in Pittsburgh. While I've never been a fan of the Joe's crab shack chain, my company insisted that we stop and give it another try. We came on a Wednesday it happened to be \"all you can eat shrimp\" Now, while being leery I ordered a round...of course there was a long black shiny hair on one of my crispy shrimp. I informed my server, she then informed the manager. The manager reluctantly apologized and offered us another round of shrimp as opposed to asking us how we would like to be compensated. Thanks but no thanks never again."}
{"text":"My first time being here and I can say it was very relaxing and enjoyable to eat here. I've always a place to have seafood around where we live. The server was helpful and came by at a reasonable time when needing help. I ordered a jumbo shrimp, a basic battered shrimp, fries and hush puppies! Definitely recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"For my first time I came to this place it's was  so amazing place to eat I'm in love whit this place I will cam back a gain this place has so many things to do eat drink in the bar or tables wahoo"}
{"text":"I had low expectations, but I don't feel those were even met.  The food here is greasy and over-cooked, and not all that appetizing. I had the Fish and Chips platter, and the scallops in particular were mushy.  The service was very good.  The prices were fairly high.    I'm not a fan of Joe's."}
{"text":"When in Vegas this is the one place we've never left town without visiting at least once...... until now. We've had some issues with service in the past were even been refunded for the crappy service we received the last time we were there.  The one thing this particular location has is that it is very consistent at being inconsistent, we always order the steam pots and the portions vary every time--never the same! Although when we complain about the smaller portions they are corrected, we shouldn't have to do that. The other thing this location is inconsistent at is the quality of service, we have never had great service--it always ranges from OK to bad. On this last visit, the manager Robert tried very hard to ensure we were provided with quality service and if it wasn't because of him, our server would have once again provided us with bad service. The service is slow, it takes servers forever to come get your order and then your order takes forever to make its way to your table even if there are only a handful of people in this place. The facility is starting to show its age as well, the smell and graffiti in the bathrooms has increased over the years and has never been addressed by management, it just keeps getting worse. The steam pots are starting to out price themselves, they taste great but I have found other places who provide great taste at a lower price. On the next trip to Vegas Joe's crab shack might just find its way off our list of \"must go\" places."}
{"text":"Food was good and service was ok. Nothing to really brag about. Food is slightly over priced and doesn't offer too much variety. The menu choices all looked and sounded the same to me. I'll probably go back later on down the line but not anytime soon."}
{"text":"Went to Joe's for my daughter's birthday, we had reservations since there was 14 of us and this was handled nicely.  Place is noisy!  To top it all, they turn up the music louder every hour or so and the servers do some kind of a performance.  Most everyone in my party ordered a seafood hotpot which was pretty good especially if you like shellfish but it is also a lot of food for one person, best to share.  As I am deathly allergic to shellfish, I told the server about my condition and he was very attentive to my situation!  I ordered mahi mahi and for the price of $15.00 was not totally worth it.  The side veggie dish was overcooked and soggy, amount was very little, \"dirty rice\" as it was called which was rice cooked in sausage and spices was soggy too...  The mahi mahi was okay but definitely not worth the money.  The server was good and attentive, kudos to him for serving a big table of 14!   The place was super busy as it was a Saturday night and our order took more than 30mins to come...  Place not bad but because of the noise level and the slow food service, I may not frequent this place..."}
{"text":"Poor service. My best friend bought me a gift card to this place for the Christmas holiday. When I went to use it the manager kept on looking at me funny. When I asked him if everything was ok he then interrogated me about the gift card like as if he didn't want me to use it. He would rather I pay with cash. After I put him in his place I didn't hear a word from him. I will never go there again. They treat their customers like crap. Avoid this place."}
{"text":"Great service unlike their Rainbow location. I would make the drive to go back to this location. Employees and manager were very friendly and helpful. Great food like always. The Redfish and Lobster is delicious."}
{"text":"Arrived at 9:30pm the place was 90% empty but we still waited almost 15 minutes before a server even asked us what we would like to drink.   I had always avoided Joes but it was the only place open so we gave it a chance.  Slow service mediocre to lousy food.  Need I say more?  Will not be back."}
{"text":"Beware! Served under cooked fish. They remade the order and that fish smelled and tasted really old. Made my husband and I sick.  Also my order was brought out with wrong side items. Charged for things I didn't get and service less then desirable.  Wish had at a Long John Silvers. Would have had a better meal at a much cheaper price."}
{"text":"The food was a bomb here.. wow so delicious everything was warm the crab taste amazing my family like this place... from now this our favorite place to go.. I'm definitely recommend it to everyone... We love to go here.."}
{"text":"We have always gone to Joe's Crab Shack for birthdays... They didn't disappoint... Sevice,atmosphere, and food really Great... I tell everyone about Joe's Crab Shack..."}
{"text":"Haven't been in quite some time and wanted to try again. It was really good. The kid and I both had the queen crab and loved it!  SEAN was a great server.  We asked for gloves and thankfully that had some for us. Will be back again.v"}
{"text":"Came here for sea food. Service was slow and food was alright. Tried to sign up on their website to get a free appetizer but the email didn't come through Until the next day and followed with a $10 off coupon. Try to sign up one day ahead get get any discount offer."}
{"text":"Everything was just....ok. they kept trying to give us the wrong food...twice. not cool when you are hungry. Our food took forever to arrive. I understand that happens every now and then but at least apologize for delay or offer to check on food for us. Once our steampots arrived, they were't even hot. More like room temperature which leads me to believe they might have sat in the back.  Although I have a coupon to come back next month I am not sure I will."}
{"text":"Great selection of food. Ended up with the Classic Sampler (which I highly recommend), the Great Barrier Steampot, and the Crab Apple Crumble Pie for dessert. All were pretty darn delicious. Prices could be a bit lower, but it was definitely a great experience. Definitely recommend for those who love seafood."}
{"text":"This was our first time here & it did not disappoint!!! The food was AMAZING!!! We had the Cajun steamer pot and it was beyond delicious! Our kids shared the kids steamer pot and loved it as well!!! The \"shark bite\" was a really fun drink to try out. Our waiter was also the bartender [Ryan] and he was incredible. Super friendly and helpful with our 3 small children. He's was great bartender as well! After we ate, our kids enjoyed playing on the playground right outside. It was such a fun family time, exciting atmosphere, & great food! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I'm from the tropics, so I don't really bother with seafood unless I see the water.  Maybe it's people like me who are used to very fresh seafood that give this place poor ratings.  I on the other hand, stuck to \"seafood-infused\" items like pasta and fish and chips.  It's a great place to bring your kids and tourist friends to drink and get messy and have fun.  The menu could be improved, but we were still happy with our orders, especially with my tea vodka infused Sunshine Tea. YUM.  Must replicate this on my birthday.  Service is EXCELLENT.  If you're real nice, they'll give you the drink jars to take home.  Want to see some food porn? :-) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/joes-crab-shack-las-vegas-2?select=yLUv1dh0WPNhhj0L9fQQ5w#yLUv1dh0WPNhhj0L9fQQ5w"}
{"text":"Love the POTS!!! I've been here more than a couple times, Great service? Not all the time but those Steam Pots are what I go back for!!  This last time we did have a very great experience.... Service was great and so was the food. Diablo Steam pot Is my fave and the Diablo mussels. Pretty much if you expect great service every time you go in... it's not happening=/ Food is good to great depending on what u order and it is a bit pricey."}
{"text":"Mgr Robert Stone Jr. And Server Dominique were top of the line rep of Joe's Crab Shack- Henderson!  Dominique's personality was a perfect example for any server to follow!  And Robert was a Class Act Manager from Minnesota!   DT from Denver"}
{"text":"Not happy about the food at all! But our server El done a great job as a waiter and was a cool guy! We use to come here years ago and the food was good but can't say that I will be back! But definitely happy with my server!"}
{"text":"Below expectations. Quality is declining. Service was great but the food was very disappointing. Crab was tasty but over cooked. Shells were too soft to crack and meat was sticking to shells. If your signature entree is crab, it has to be prepared consistently and done well.  I don't mind paying for quality food but $120 for lackluster crab is like salt in a wound.  Probably not going back until reviews improve."}
{"text":"This place is great for kids if you can sit outside because of the playground. The service was ok. Had to ask for drink refills 3 times. The crab was good a lil on the salty side. But good. I think our waitress tried she was just busy. The Thursday night 1 Lb.  crab for $15 bucks is a good deal. Overall decent place."}
{"text":"Went to Joes on Valentine's Day and it was PACKED. The guy at the booth told us the wait was an hour.. It could have been worse, the one at Az Mills had a two hour wait.  So we waited, and the name was called twenty minutes early! I was really surprised.   We were seated and Marina was our waitress. This was my first time at this location, and after reading all the horrible reviews, I was a little nervous.  But Marina made us feel right at home, and definitely proved that you should see things yourself!  Not the best seafood I've ever had, but for Arizona standards it was fine.  (Heck I'm from Seattle)  Long story short, I was really impressed with this location!"}
{"text":"Very poor service, unfriendly, inattentive, food was just barely fair. Once before we were there an never got waited on. This time it was about 10 minutes.."}
{"text":"This whole area looks brand new so it's not surprising that I have to add this location.  I enjoyed eating here after watching all their commercials which are pretty decent and the jingle stays in your head. When we arrived there was an hour wait and since we didn't have anything better to do we decided that sitting at the bar would be a better time waster than in the lobby or outside on a bench. I ordered one of their drinks that had some kind of a cutesie name like \"The Wild Tornado\" or \"Sunrise splash\" or something. It tasted fine and I got halfway through it when our buzzer told us they had a table available, it had only been about a half hour so that's a plus on their end. Our party ordered various crab baskets to basically share and get a taste for everything they had. All the food was pretty much average. I got chunks of sausage and an ear of corn along with a few king crab and snow crab legs. The corn was chewy and the sausage was meh, but the seafood portion of everything was good. A little spendy for the flare that is everywhere but none the less we all had a great time and were full when we left. So I suppose you can give this a shot if you're in the area with a few bucks to kill."}
{"text":"Had to wait an hour and ten minutes long to eat dry food on picnic tables - that should say enough . Didn't even know seafood could come out so dry"}
{"text":"I like all the choices! Much better than Red Lobster! They have a nice kids menu. Clam chowder is good!"}
{"text":"From 7/14/15  We came to Joe's Crab Shake to stuff our faces with what else crabs because you can't just come here and eat a burger! The location is On N Rainbow Blvd and West Mead Blvd, you seriously can't miss it considering there is a light up sign that says \"Joe's Crab Shack,\" with an arrow pointing to the restaurant.   Once seated, you can get a good view of how this restaurant is set up. There is tons of seating, and the décor is nautical, it honestly reminds me of how some of the seafood restaurants in NY that are on boardwalks with a beachy vibe.   Our server was pretty awesome and told us everything we needed to know about this place, the various ways to have your crab cooked or season and the rest of menu. I ordered the KJ Steam Pot, which is snow crab, mussels, scallops, corn, and potatoes cooked in a Kendall Jackson wine sauce.   I really loved the flavoring of the crab it really did not need to be dunked in butter because it was seasoned perfectly. However the mussels did, for some reason they were sort of bland- everything else in the pot was the bees knees though.  This was my first time at a Joe's ever, and I look forward to coming back, I'll have to try something else next time I dine here."}
{"text":"I don't think I would have ever ventured into this place on my own, but my sister loves it, so I find myself here a few times a year. I'm not really charmed by the ambiance or impressed with many of the menu items--and their beer selection is really lame too. HOWEVER, if you're looking for some delicious Dungeness Crab all the way in the desert, this is your spot. That's pretty much what we get every time. I'm from the San Francisco Bay Area, so I know that the best Crab is Dungeness, and you can't really find it just anywhere here in the Valley. But, at Joe's they've got it in abundance. Get a steam pot. Get crackin'. Get dirty. Get filled up. ...Then get outta there. That's my game plan. Oh, the Paella is good too."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my visit today. Food was good, kids were enjoying the ballon maker and we were all happy with our meals. In field home run in my eyes. Thanks CS!"}
{"text":"So good!! We always share a pot of Joe's bucket of crab and shrimp. Delicious. Love the atmosphere too!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for happy hour today and I must say this is one of the better happy hours. When you think it couldn't get better, come here on a Tuesday. On Tuesday, their special are two dollars hence the theme Twosday. After 3 hurricanes, I can honestly say my hour is happy...lol."}
{"text":"Passed by this place for several years and was on way home and felt rich so we stopped in about 5 pm. It was a whim decision. Wife had the bacon wrapped shrimp, How can one go wrong with BACON. She liked it and it served her no white food diet. I had the fish and chips, I thought I ordered the fish and shrimp but wasn't making a stir about it. The fish was very good and the fries were great as cut from fresh potatos The little cup of coleslaw was very good too. I was really thrilled at the plate being served HOT keeping ones meal hot. Nothing worse than the plate taking all the heat from ones food. Our server was attentive enough to keep us happy and earned our top rate. 20+%.  I would  go here again before I would go to Red lobster which I can handle maybe once every other year."}
{"text":"I tried Joe's classic sampler. This included great balls of fire, crab dip and calamari.  I had bowl of New England clam chowder as a starter. You can get better clam chowder from a can. We found the food to be below average in quality and slightly overpriced. There are so many better places to go such as Luke woollies wild Alaskan grill or the grand concourse. Mitchell's is far better in that same price range.  We will never go back!"}
{"text":"Decent bar food is about it...best thing about this restaurant is the view! I've read some bad reviews about their 'crab nachos' and I have to agree...where was the crab?!! This app is listed on their menu as 'killer' and I have to disagree...I also had a crab cake which was decent if over seasoned a bit...she had some seaside trio thing which was passable at best...highly doubt a return visit."}
{"text":"Jesus was our waiter tonight!  He was awesome!  No one came to our table right away and he noticed, even though it was not his area and he helped us.  He was kind and very attentive.  I'll go back to Joe's Crab Shack because of our waiter's stellar service and attention to detail."}
{"text":"Wonderful time, my son's first time with anything in a shell our server Katy,  was great helping him learn as well as a as a pure joy to talk with.  Runner Darrell was also very pleasant,  I would pass Joe's on to my friends and family.  Thank you all for a wonderful dinner and plenty of smiles."}
{"text":"Made Joe's Crab Shack our last dinner stop during our vacation in Las Vegas and we were very happy we did!!!  The crab nachos started off our dinner and they were delicious! !!  My wife and I ordered the Steam Pot for 2 and that was amazing!!!  We had NO COMPLAINTS about our dinner, our service or the atmosphere! !  We make our way to Las Vegas twice a year and from now on Joe's will be our final stop before we come back home.  We sure wish Joe's Crab Shack would open a location in Albuquerque, NM or anywhere in NM would work for us!!!"}
{"text":"Good service, good crab and clams. The lobster bisque was gross and the fries were too salty by a mile."}
{"text":"NOT for vegetarians  I went to Joe's because I was with a group that wanted to go. There is nothing vegetarian on the menu. When I asked the waiter, he said I could order a pasta dish with no seafood on it, so I did. I got a measly amount of what was basically plain noodles that I was still charged $16 for (what it cost on the menu for the shrimp pasta)."}
{"text":"Ah, yes. Whenever I start wondering what it is I don't like about chain restaurants, I can always find a Joe's or other current-or-former Landry's restaurant to remind me why.   Bland, tasteless, overpriced, swill."}
{"text":"This place has descent food depending on what you order and I got to TRY MOONSHINE HERE! I don't like the crowd, tends to be more hill billy's."}
{"text":"I took my Mom here for her birthday in December... I know, I'm late in reviewing. I'm originally from Boston and living in AZ I find good seafood at an affordable price is hard to find.  My Mom and I split one of the seafood buckets.... the Boston one of course! It included lobster, clams, corn and sausage - it was the perfect size to please us both for dinner and I think it was priced fairly. We enjoyed our meal and the staff occassionally broke out into song and dance which kept it lively and gave us a good chuckle too. It's not a fancy place by any means but so far one of the better places I've enjoyed for seafood here in AZ. Go in with a fun attitude and you'll enjoy yourself as much as we did. Now if they could only open one of these places in N. Scottsdale or Phoenix..."}
{"text":"We dined last night and each ordered an array of food.   The first think we noticed was the water they served was very much tap water. Tap water from very old pipes from the taste.  Our food was good but nothing super special. I ordered the crab daddy steampot, it was okay. Crab was a bit over cooked.  My mom and brother shared the joes classic for 2, they enjoyed it but the sausage didn't look completely cooked, and was dripping in grease.   My step dad had the crab cakes and he said they were fabulous,  no complaints.   My husband had the popcorn shrimp and the clam chowder. The popcorn shrimp were fantastic, clam chowder slightly watery.   Overall atmosphere was good, it's VERY LOUD there but the employees were fabulous. Our waitress was sweet, loud and swift to refill drinks.   Not to mention they have a playground, and my 2 yr old had a blast."}
{"text":"Fun. A regular spot for early dinner with friend. Not a great diversity in seafood selections, but it is a crab place"}
{"text":"While I love seafood, I'm afraid I have to agree with the previous poster - had a horrible experience here with one of the Crab Pot dishes - one thing about seafood such as crab, mussels, etc., is that it needs to be very well cooked, or one is asking for trouble!  My dish was not, and as a result, I found plenty of trouble!  It's too bad, because we had gone here in September of 2010, and it was much better.  Things seem to have really gone downhill since then."}
{"text":"Fail.   Sat before other tables yet we had to finally stop someone for service. It would have not been so bad but the staff stands around like a social gathering. Must be nice to be working (or you should be) and laugh and get paid  Then let's top this no dinner salad and our order comes out wrong.  Hope if they get it right they don't spit in it"}
{"text":"Yes it's a chain. But they did their standard fare well.  Beforehand, I had low expectations judging from the Yelp! reviews (I especially love the reviews where people go to Joe's MFing C R A B   S HA C K and order chicken and then complain about the food). I was more than pleasantly surprised. We came for dinner on a Saturday night and it wasn't very busy. We sat down right away and our waitress took our orders quickly. Drinks and food came out quickly. The wife and I shared the classic Joe steam pot for two and we were stuffed. It tasted really good -- especially the andouille sausage. The kids got the mac n cheese and the grilled shrimp which was done pretty much they way my kids like. We ordered a couple side salads and got a couple cocktails. I was pretty happy with the food, the service, and whole experience. Definitely will return."}
{"text":"I was excited to come to this restaurant as I only heard good things about this food chain. However, it was utterly disappointing. I am not sure if they just had a lot of bad servers that night or just decided to train everybody in the middle of the week but the service was horrible. Right when we walked in the door we noticed it wasn't busy at all. We knew we would be seated immediately. We were not even greeted warmly. The host were too busy having a conversation to want to help us right away let alone even take time to notice us. After coming to seat us they were confused as to where to put us. Finally they decided to put us in a booth in the center of the restaurant. We didn't even meet our server until 15 minutes after sitting down. She brought us menu's and took over drink/appetizer orders but we didn't get our drinks until 10 minutes later. Our appetizer went to another table luckily she figured it out before they started digging into it. We ordered our meal and it came to us in a typically time frame (about 25-30 min). The food itself was good however the portion that came in the steamer somewhat shocked me. It wasn't as much as I thought I would get. I ordered 1 1/4 lb queen crab. It was maybe 2 small crabs. Nonetheless, it was good the service was just terrible,It took our waitress too long in between for her to check on us, take our orders, bring us our check or even refill drinks. I never got a drink refill, and my boyfriend only got 1. I would never eat there again, at least not at this location."}
{"text":"Alright seafood. Nothing great and way overpriced."}
{"text":"I had made a reservation for 10 for a Bachelorette party. We arrived on time with our entire party, but were still made to wait about 15 minutes to be seated. They did give us a few complimentary appetizers to make up for the wait, so that was nice, but the place was not overly crowded so I don't understand what the issue was.  We devoured the crab nachos pretty quickly, though I wish there were more crab and less unidentified creamy saucy stuff.  Since it WAS a Bachelorette party, we decided to order the most ridiculous cocktails on the menu. I had something called \"Gone Fishing\" which was bright green, had gummy fish floating in it, and tasted just like the Jungle Juice of my college days... though it wasn't nearly as strong. My fault for ordering this, should have stuck to sangria, which was enjoyed by all.  I had the trio of shrimp as an entree, all were good, my favorite being the crab-stuffed shrimp. The portions were huge and I couldn't finish.  After our meals, the staff came out with a plate of whipped cream and told the bride she had to find the cherry without using her hands. After her face was sufficiently covered with whipped cream, they revealed that there was no cherry to be had. Ok, I get that this place has a \"zany\" vibe, and I'm all for a good time, but what the hell? No young woman on her big night out wants to mess up her make-up and make a fool of herself in front of all of her friends and a restaurant full of strangers. Save the antics for kid's birthday parties!"}
{"text":"I went there today food was good drinks were great and service was great until I got served moldy bread.  I ate half of it before I noticed. The manager came out and offered me a new app and when I said no he just took the app off my bill.  I said hope I don't get sick and he laughed and said I would be fine and walked away. This review was from a couple months ago."}
{"text":"bucket of crab steamed without heavy flavoring. that's the way fresh seafood should be cooked!  prefer Joe's to Red Lobster.  never ever finished the whole bucket by myself; such generous portion!"}
{"text":"This is one stop we always make once or twice when I'm Vegas. We come for the Siunset Fire-Grilled Queen Crab buckets!! Yummy!! The food was actually just a bonus. Our server, Monique was so awesome!! Her smile & personality are so bright & infectious!! And, the manager, Paul was awesome, too!! Will definitely be back again & again!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here yesterday for the first time. I ordered the cheesy Mac n cheese for my child, which btw, was straight out of the Kraft Mac n cheese box. I don't feed that to my children any day of the week plus it was dry and lumpy. I had the east coast something a rather... fries were limp old soggy and everything else seemed out of a bag and put on high heat. It came out warm... I'd probably never come here again."}
{"text":"I had my family in town and my sister wanted to go to Joe's Crab Shack.  I haven't been here in years.  So it sounded like a good plan.  We arrived and there wasn't really a crowd and we were seated pretty quick.  There was 8 of us.  This is a chain so there wasn't anything that that stood out.  The waitress was typical, she came every once round every once and awhile.  My wife, sister and I ordered some steam pots.  Wow, these little things are really expensive.  They included shrimp, lobster, clams, potatoes, corn, and a sausage. I wasn't impressed at all, especially for the price.  My wife gave me her lobster claw.  Now I ate it and it tasted funny.  You would think I would spit it out.  But I didn't!  I have never been this sick after going to a restaurant.  I was a mess!  I will never go back to this place ever again.  They're so many better seafood options in Vegas.  Sorry Joe's."}
{"text":"Took my wife out for Mother's Day and this hit the spot. Make sure you make reservations it gets packed. Shared a steam pot with Cajun seasoning. Very well seasoned and a little spicy but I will be coming back soon. The atmosphere is very upbeat good place to take kids. Below is the aftermath of what was left"}
{"text":"Food was excellent but what made our experience the best was our server GINA she was super awesome and so attentive to our needs. From the time we sat down she took care of all of our needs and then some. I highly recommend this place the staff is great which made the food taste even better. Thanks GINA for making my first experience there the best"}
{"text":"First time going and I was excited. It ended up being horrible. It was freezing cold to the point we had to tell them how cold it was and our waitress wasn't good either. We didn't get our appetizers until after we got our meals. The manager told us the appetizers were taken off the bill so that was good. Thoroughly disappointed with the waitress. Not sure we'll be going back to this one"}
{"text":"Went for date night at the beginning of March, had Travis? I'm pretty sure, I know it started with a T and he has been there for about 3 years.  He was really good until his station filled up and got a trainee Andrea...then he was less attentive but still decent. The shrimp in my steampot had a weird taste so he got me extra fried pickles because I really liked them, and he had to get me another side of potatoes since mine weren't cooked all the way. Of course we will go back since I love seafood and know I won't die from eating theirs."}
{"text":"This used to be a great place to take the family.  But, the food has gone down hill.  Went this past Friday - I got the Crab Cake salad and my wife got the Crab Cake sandwich and both smelled of something rotten.  The kids always get the fishermans catch.  My one daughter said \"dad this does not taste right\" so I took a bite of the fish stick and it did not resemble anything like fried fish.  When the manager came around, we told him about everything.  He did seem concerned and offered to make us new meals but it was too late.  We paid the bill and ate over at TGI Fridays."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I'm allergic to shellfish...shrimp, crab, lobster, which really sucks bcuz I'm originally from ME, this in an allergy I developed when pregnant w my first 2 kids. That being said, I LOVE scallops & clams. The choices here for me were limited. Fried clams, fried white fish, fried scallops...everything fried. They did customize slightly for me because of my allergy but it had to be approved by the manager 1st. I wanted to substitute the fried scallops for something shrimp on the plate, after the server talked to the mngr, he said I couldn't get scallops but I could double something else offered in the combo, so fried fish or fried clams. The fish was nothing special & neither were the clams. I think I could've went to the grocery store & found the same items in the frozen food section. The fries were decent.  My guy was a regular here a few years back & said the quality has decreased dramatically.  I wish we'd gone to Red Lobster. Similar pricing, MANY more choices! We won't be back."}
{"text":"Good place. Went here with the family at 1 o'clock on a Thursday afternoon. The place was almost empty. We ordered the fish and chips, snow crab legs with Old Bay seasoning and they were delicious. Obviously it did not take long for our food to come because of the crowd. We got a free appetizer for signing up online of crab dip and nachos."}
{"text":"Fish dish was decent but really salty.  Didn't like the taste of the broccoli. The green beans were very good."}
{"text":"I like Joes! It's not gourmet, it's not fancy and the food is cooked well but not what I would call exceptional. But if you like seafood and a beer, great service and you want it reasonable priced; Eat at Joe's."}
{"text":"The King Daddy Fest and 12 Shrimp Bucket were okay, considering that they came with Cajun spice, I would have preferred Garlic Herb. I'd started out with an ice tea, which I was charged for and took an inch of drink of and asked for a water. The water must have been off today and the server assistant, not my server, said that people have been complaining about the water even though the water is filtered. The small salad wasn't drain very well, it was very watery and they forgot to mix the old lettuce with the new because all we got was the lettuce that had one more day in the fridge. The lobster bisque was really thick like yogurt, it had crumbles rather than pieces of lobster, and tasted really fishy. All three servers assistants made up for the server's lack of eye contact and service. Granted it was a Sunday and kinda of busy the server never made eye contact, only when he dropped off the check and when he thanked us for our patience. Then another messed up thing the server did was tell us after he dropped off our drinks was say he would be right back to take our order. However he took another table that came right after us their drink order, brought their drinks and took their order. He forgot about us had he told us in the beginning that he was running behind it would be a little bit more forgiving. However you can totally tell his manger was berating him because I could see him doing this. Which is never cool. I was really disappointed as this was my first experience at Joe's Crab Shack considering I live 400+ miles away and have heard nothing but good things about the Joe's Crab Shack in Savannah, Georgia. This rating only gets a two star rating considering we are like pigs."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Joe's Crab Shack. I came here with several of my classmates to celebrate our last day of clinic and school. We had reserved a big table for 14 people and they were able to accommodate us which was great. The reason for my 2 stars is because of the service. It took forever for us to order and get our drinks and food. I know that we had a big table but there were two staff members taking care of us. The waitress was great but the waiter was super slow and had forgotten about us our something because one of my fellow classmate and I had ordered some alcoholic beverages and it took him 20 minutes to check up on us and asked if we wanted anything else and I was like umm yeah...our drinks! I have to say my Bloody Mary was delicious though so my annoyance for the delay disappeared. The food was okay. I had ordered The Ragin' Cajun to share with my friend. It was a little bit too salty for me but squirting some lemon juice on top made it taste better. Overall Joe's Crab Shack was okay. I don't think I will be coming back. I'll get my seafood fix somewhere else."}
{"text":"Dirty Dirty Dirty place!!  And it stinks.  Torn seats in the booths.  Old and dirty.  Gross!  The blinds by the booths are torn and the dirtiest thing I've ever seen in a restaurant.  Geez...Twilight zone!  I can only imagine what the kitchen looks like.  Where are you health department??"}
{"text":"Joe's Crab Shack is amazing the food is amazing I love how they have specials for different days the servers are on top of the service I just wish they would add the \"all you can eat\" so you can pick from anything on the menu not just once specific thing but other then that if you love crab I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place. While growing up, my family and I visited the Sunset location frequently for birthdays to embarrass my siblings, or other special occasions.  Over the past 5-7 years I'd say its slowly been affected by numerous things. Maybe the economy, which possibly caused them to use a cheaper product? This is strictly an assumption based on it going from great, to good, to just ok, to I won't return. The fish and crab just does NOT seem fresh, and I wouldn't doubt it being re-heated. Not to mention, the portions undoubtably have gotten smaller. I do really like certain items like the crab stuffed jalapeños, and the spicy flavor to the hot option of crab. And the service is always decent to above average. But hey if I'm paying $100 for a meal, I expect it to be fresh, filling, and pretty much awesome. Not just a perky server and an appetizer I can pass up on if its the only thing I am looking forward to. I appreciate the fact that they still sing and dance, but even the enthusiasm in that has reduced.  Sorry Joe, if its crab I'm in search of, ill stick to Boiling Crab or Cravin Cagin!"}
{"text":"We just had just arrived last night around 6:30,  after a 9 hour drive from Colorado, and were ready to unwind and enjoy a decent dinner. Never got to it because the nose was so loud in the restaurant we couldn't talk to each other and could barely hear the waiter. The staff was shouting over the PA system about playing musical chairs (adults) and getting everyone riled up. It was crazy loud!  Was just not what we needed or wanted after a long day, so we apologized to the water when he brought our waters and left for a place where we could enjoy a conversation. Not sure if it's always like this, but will not return to find out."}
{"text":"There were 6 of us for the Wednesday all you can eat snow crab and I have to say that it was the best.  We did not leave hungry and it was nice being able to switch up seasoning on them with each order too.  Our waitress Zuri could not have been better!!!!!  She was bringing more cry without us having to ask and she was constantly making sure we were doing okay.  I was so impressed with her, that I plan on contacting the manager to let her know how much we appreciated the service that Zuri gave us."}
{"text":"I've been to this location twice. Once four years ago and more recently just this past weekend. I had family in town who live in Tucson but decided to come to Tempe for the day to sightsee. We settled on Joe's as a place to meet for a little convo and noshing before they headed back home.   Upon approaching the front door, it swung open and a young man greeted us cheerfully and welcomed us to Joe's. We immediately noticed our family members already seated in a corner booth, so we waved and headed in their direction. The hostess was sweet and polite as I explained it looked like they already had a table for us.   We barely sat down and the waitress came over to take our drink order. She was back in MAYBE 2 minutes and wanted to know if we wanted appetizers or were ready to order. We asked for a few more minutes. Honestly, she gave us just that...FOUR minutes and she was back. I think this happened a handful of time before we actually were ready to order. Although the interruptions were annoying, she was really nice and was doing her best to offer great customer service.  Now for the food. My husband and two family members had a bucket of king crab, with two potatoes and a piece of corn. They were all in heaven. Said it was really delicious. I had the coconut prawns with a side of fish--which was supposed to be a beer battered fish from fish and chips. I got Talapia. I asked for beer battered fish and got this pathetic little piece of cod (I hope!) with a light dusting of bread crumbs on it. My meal, although I devoured every bit of it, left me rather dissapointed. The shrimp were, well....shrimpy. I was thinking I was getting PRAWNS--nice, large, butterflied prawns like in the picture. Instead I got these itty, bitty, teeny, tiny SHRIMP that were butterflied to make them look bigger. I will say the french fries weren't bad--but who messes up FRENCH FRIES??  I won't be returning here again. Not to this location at least. Being from Washington, I am a bit of a seafood snob (which I really hate to admit, let alone BE) so I know FRESH, DELICIOUS seafood. That isn't what I got at Joe's.   Like some other reveiwers mentioned...Pappadeaux's is MUCH better. Pass on Joe's and head there instead."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic. The service was very poor.   The manager greeted and checked on my table several times and left his business card. Kinda weird.   The employees dancing and clapping can get ridiculous pretty quick."}
{"text":"The waitress by the name Jamie kept touching my baby son.  I mean grabbing his hands and touching his cheeks expressing how cute he is.  I finally had enough and I had to say, \"look I don't appreciate you having your hands all over my son, so stop!\"   The other employees were also touchy Feely... No respect for babies whatsoever or respecting boundaries. I would never eat here again. The food was okay but not worth the discomfort."}
{"text":"It's been a few years since we've been, menu seems to be all about \"steamers\" or buckets, didn't see much in the way of individual meals.  Wasn't crowded when we were here, yet our waitress seemed to rush everything out."}
{"text":"The food is just not good. The crabs legs are so skinny. I should have gone some where else."}
{"text":"This is our go to place for big family dinners they have no problem taking in tables of 9 and bigger and its a good place for kids to kinda be themselves without everyone staring at you and the crab buckets are to die for!"}
{"text":"Hanna is a TERRIBLE server! She has no clue on what she is doing! We had to wave her down for our plates! Then for a refill! Never checked to see if we needed anything and anytime we did we had to wait for her to come from the back. TERRIBLE service! Great food! HORRIBLE service."}
{"text":"If you get shrimp or lobster tail, they aren't cleaned. Every one comes with a free shit vein!"}
{"text":"It's ok. used to be better but nonetheless the crab dungeness was perfect !!! corn  delicious. needed more juice seasoning and shrimp was plain boiled. I guess I'm comparing to Hot & Juicy Crawfish restaurant. They cocktails very very good. I had watermelon sangria and mason jar classic margarita with gran gala !!!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome. The staff was friendly and pleasant to talk to. Everything about this place  was on point!! We came out here from AZ, and got to sit by the window over looking the Pittsburgh skyline, and all of the snow on the ground (something not seen in Phoenix)."}
{"text":"I was really impressed with the service and technology at Joe's Crab Shack.  We gave our names to the host and he asked for our cell phone number so that they could text us when our table was ready.  We got a text right away confirming our place in line.  The text had a link to web site where you could see your estimated wait time and it also had games and trivia for you to do while you wait.  In addition, my son was able to play on their outdoor playground to help pass the time.    Our waitress was really friendly and the other servers do occasional dance routines to certain songs.  It's a great atmosphere for a fun night out.    And of course the food is delicious!"}
{"text":"I've dined here a couple times being its so close to where I reside at. I almost always get the same thing and opt for the steam pots. I get the joes classic steam pot and ask for a lot of Cajun seasoning on it. Food was delicious, and service was good. I only come out to joes whenever I'm feeling a bit lazy to buy and cook my own seafood haha!"}
{"text":"To start things off on the wrong foot, the place was dirty. Only 2 other tables were taken but sat us at a dirty table. We ordered an appetizer and drinks, brought me the wrong drink, never got the appetizer.. While we waited 45 min for our food, the waiter stood behind the bar on his phone, during our meal he never came to check on us. Finally I called him over to show him the fish I ordered was raw. He tried to convince me it was cooked, but luckily I know what raw fish looks like and I asked to see manager...I wish I could give negative stars, I've had better service at a McDonalds."}
{"text":"We love Joe's Crab Shack.  We make the trip down from Scottsdale at least twice a month to enjoy Joe's wonderful Steam Pots.  A family favorite is the Lobster Daddy Steam Pot.  Even our 4 year old son loves Joe's.  Always a happy, family friendly environment."}
{"text":"Decided to give this Joes Crab Shack one more try.  The staff is always friendly but the food is less than spectacular.  This visit was a pleasant surprise. I had the island steak and shrimp.  It had a nice sweetness and was cooked the way I ordered it.  Nice job!"}
{"text":"The music was so loud that we literally had to yell just to hear each other. Even the waiters ha to yell at the customers so they could hear. I asked them to turn it down, but that never happened. The waiter wasn't good at all and rushed us out.. Horrible experience!!"}
{"text":"Took the wife for her birthday dinner. Food was amazing, just how we expected it to taste. Our waitress just topped of the dinner. Sandra gave us tips on different plate choices and add ons, chatted with the wife and I. Sandra definitely made the evening enjoyable. I would recommend stopping and meeting the great staff, ask for Sandra and enjoy the great food."}
{"text":"Great Food & Good Service! My family & I visited here from Cleveland where the city no longer has this restaurant. The Appetizer Sampler was a great start. You can't go wrong with any of the platter entrees. Oh and the chocolate cake was a great ending to our dinner. You will definitely enjoy!"}
{"text":"I've gone to Joe's Crab Shack many times. In the past, I'd have given this place more stars. Typically, the service is good, the food comes out well, and we generally leave satisfied. Last night was definitely the exception.   My family and I went, and the place was packed. So I understood the delays in the waiter coming by - to a certain extent. I ordered iced tea and my usual steampot, with broccoli in lieu of the potatoes. They bring my iced tea, but no sweeteners out. It takes half an hour to track down our server to get sweeteners. Then my meal comes out, and it's missing many things. In the pot, there's crab, a couple shrimp and a sausage link, that's it. No broccoli, nothing. So they get the broccoli after a few minutes. Then I realize I didn't have any warmed butter, a knife to cut the sausage, an infamous bib, a cracker to break the crab shells, or most of the things that a waiter typically brings with an expensive steampot order (25.99). I ate the tiny broccoli portion and the shrimp while waiting for the server to come by to request the other things. Then of course it takes him 20 minutes to get them. By the time he came back, my crab was cold. Oh and I never got a refill on my drink.   Then, suddenly when it was time to drop the bill off, our server was abruptly nice and had all the time in the world to laugh and smile with us. Clearly hoping for a bigger tip. Granted, he got 15 percent, but I probably won't be going back to this Joe's Crab Shack anytime soon."}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely amazing!!!! The people are nice and at the time I came it was fast and quiet. (4:30 pm Tuesday.) The crab nachos were awesome as well as the calamari. A++ in my book!!"}
{"text":"My fav any day!   Upbeat,  live and popping.   Best seasoning on the crab legs,  crab dip is awesome,  just order it all!! Coming from the east coast no one compares to Joe's on Baseline!"}
{"text":"Food is always delicious.  Service is good and we enjoy the entire experience.  This location always keeps us coming back!!"}
{"text":"Used to be good back around...1999-2000 or so. I had great memories and used to love the food there. However, more recently a bf who had heard me make good comments about the food, took me there and the food was not good at all. It was edible, but there was more of a \"fishy\" not fresh taste this time. I know not to expect most seafood in AZ to be as fresh as if we were on the beach, but it used to be great. They no longer had some of the menu items they used to. It just wasn't impressive and certainly didn't live up to the memories I had.  Good news is I no longer crave it and have to travel across town and spend the money to go there. :)"}
{"text":"Tonight was our third time here. Always excellent service and fantastic food. Our server tonight, Angie, was amazingly helpful and so gracious. My son ordered a Cajun bucket, then decided it was too spicy. She took it back no problem, no complaint, no charge. Had his new bucket out on the fly. The manager was equally as great and helpful. We will return!"}
{"text":"Best place to eat seafood.  I love the Alaskan King Crab Legs, they are amazing.  We have eaten at several locations and all of them are AMAZING..............Laughlin @ The Golden Nugget overlooking the river and in Ventura, Ca."}
{"text":"I have been to a Joe's Crab Shack in New Jersey, but the experience we had at the Henderson location was very surprising.  For one thing, I don't recall ever seeing the staff dancing at a Joe's. I have seen it at Johnny Rockets locations where the staff half-heartedly does performances every so often. There is a clear difference between what I have seen there and the staff at this location; the staff members here actually seem like they are enjoying themselves. If they really aren't, then they are adept at making it seem that they are. Even the \"Happy Birthday\" routines were different from table to table. For such things that the staff is required to do regularly, I could see how difficult it is for them to be \"convincing.\" I give them quite a bit of credit for that accomplishment.  Food and service were top notch here. I would consider returning to this location in future trips to Vegas as an \"honorary local.\""}
{"text":"Crab was very small (immature) shrimp was small and \"rubbery\" (not fresh at all)  Service was excellent"}
{"text":"Wife an I go there about once a year! Service and food have been good! This past Saturday our service was excellent (courtesy of Jordan) food was great! I left my credit card there on accident - came back a couple of days later and guess what it was there with no compromise. Great team there, I think I will visit more often. I'll even buy the portraits every time! Thank you!"}
{"text":"We ate here a month or so ago and I can't wait to visit again. It was my first visit and I really enjoyed it.  The food was great! Or maybe the Hurricane I had made it seem that way.  Prompt and friendly service! Great food!   We'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Waste of time, jumping into the Ohio river with your mouth open in search of your own catch like a Pelican would have been a better option. This place is nothing but another chain with mediocre food and spoiled college kids working tables.   The crab was over cooked, the fried fish was soggy and deep brown. It was 6pm when do they change their oil? For the overall quality you are given the value is 2x what you should be paying. It's on par with Red Lobster, the only difference is they shove everything in a pale. My 4 yr old like that...If I was that Pelican I would have flown away if I knew better.  That was the first and last time for us at Joes.    Score Food Quality 2 Service 2 Atmosphere 4 ( it's Pittsburgh how can you score bad!) Value 1  Recommend 1"}
{"text":"If I'm going to eat seafood might as well do it right... The atmosphere is what I needed right now. A little get away from that noisy chaotic Christmas traffic. Enjoy"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch or dinner with the family. I love this place for the kids as well. They have the kids play areas on the side."}
{"text":"I had a good experience at the station square location so I stopped in this one before a movie. Once again got the sampler & calamari for apps. Great once again. The fried shrimp entrée was good and worth the money. The only problem was the server, not very attentive. After our order we didn't see her til our check, we had to stop other servers when we needed something."}
{"text":"Very good food & drink. Love a the app sampler.  The calamari is great. Got the steam pot for my entrée,  it was good put for the high price the portion was small. Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"Surf and turf burger is terrific. Crab boils are always a favortie in my book. Staff always friendly and well trained."}
{"text":"All I can say is me and the wife and daughter ate here for fathers day,  me and my wife both got food poisoning .when we called them to let them know they didn't seem to care and just blew us off. We will never go to joes crab shack again."}
{"text":"I decided to go to Joe's with my girlfriend and her friend to start off a Sunday Funday. They were understaffed with servers as the place was pretty full with only 3 servers. It took 20 minutes to receive my drink. They were out of what I wanted(Crawfish). So I opted the build your own boil and added clams in place of crawfish..... I chose to have it seasoned with Old Bay. My girlfriend and her friend split a Steampot with mussels, shrimp, and clams. Both of our steam Pots were pretty dry. Definitely over cooked and not seasoned very well. We were all a little underwhelmed with our food. Even my crab was pretty dry. I was happy with our server as she did what she could and was pretty pleasant."}
{"text":"I suffered minor food poisoning eating here.  It was a Saturday night and I ordered King Crab Legs and a Sangria.  The crab legs itself was old.  It tasted old, but did not have any strange smells so I figured it was okay.  I figured this is Arizona, I can't get fresh seafood here so I settled for mediocre tasting food.  That was fine because from reading the reviews, I didn't expect much.  What I didn't expect was that the food was beyond bad.  I stomach turned right after I finished my last bite.  Usually this is a sign the food is pretty bad.  I had indigestion for the next few hours.  Minor problems, I figured.  I woke up feeling pretty awful.  I took some natural and prescription antibiotics in the afternoon and only then did I start to feel better.    The service was very good.  Bartender and staff were very friendly.  I've been a fan of Joe's Crab Shack from back in Dallas and Fort Lauderdale.  Those locations were always packed to the bone on a weekend night.  I had greatly enjoyed the seafood there and have never gotten sick eating there before.  This particular location is different.  Crab was totally off and the place looked rather vacant for a Saturday night from 9:00 PM - 10:00 PM.  Maybe the other customers learned their lesson already?   Not worth risking my health here again.  I gave this two stars because at Joe's, at least the staff is positive and friendly.  You can count on that."}
{"text":"Took my daughter because she earned a free meal coupon for good grades. We have eaten at Joes before numerous times but in California. We were seated outside which was fine but after a few minutes we were invaded by pigeons because the kids sitting behind us were feeding them. The servers said nothing so I ended up getting up and saying something to the other customers. They did stop but it added tension because they were aggravated that I said something even though I was sweet as pie when I said it. The server took forever with every part of the meal. The food was good and hot but if took her forever to bring me my check. While waiting for the check I noticed about 4 giant flying roaches! It is expected to see these in the dessert but usually with regular pest control visits you shouldn't see any! The servers were amused with the activity of the bugs but everyone that was sitting outside was not."}
{"text":"If you like using dirty paper towels off of a paper towel roll that someone with dirty hands grabbed from the top and left their dirty hand print all over, then this is your place.  Furthermore, if you like eating out of a metal mop bucket, this is your place.  Order a steam pot and when you're done eating, ask for some hot water and a mop. Fill the bucket and get to work, no other reason to come here. In all fairness, the employees are nice when they aren't being over the top party-bubbly. I came here to eat, not for peer-bonding.   I'm sure the whole \"drink from a jar, eat out of a mop bucket while wearing a bib\" thing might be the \"down home real folks\" thing somewhere along the Mississippi river, but it doesn't work in the land of hot and cold running water.   The food might have had a chance but after looking at the dirty paper towel roll and the mop bucket steam pots, the experience was over for me and I checked out psychologically. The Coca Cola is great! I also loved the tabasco sauce and to their credit, at least they don't expect for you to eat with your hands. Knives and forks available!"}
{"text":"I don't get here often, but tonight we had an amazing bacon wrapped shrimp with dirty rice and broccoli. Just delicious! The fries were fresh and the fried shrimp were tasty. I will make a point of coming back."}
{"text":"Steam pots galore. Great taste, good service."}
{"text":"By far the worst and most disgusting experience I've had to date and I don't foresee myself ever coming back to this establishment. While out on a date with my wife, we were eating our crab buckets when my wife saw a bug crawling on one of her crab legs and freaked out. She immediately ran to the bathroom because all she could think about was that she possibly already ate something that she shouldn't have. When approached by the manager, he stated, \"I won't give any excuses, unfortunately this happens at times\" WOW! I was appalled, why would a manager of a food establishment be comfortable relaying to a customer that they have a bug problem from time to time??? We immediately left and we will not be back!"}
{"text":"It's Saturday and we got there around 6ish. There was a line to get a table, but it went fairly quickly. We got the last open table then people had to wait after us. Our server Daphnie was super cool. We ordered the Samuel Adams Steampot to share and my husband ordered the Classic Sampler, a cup of clam chowder, and an extra side order of popcorn shrimp. We got two sodas too. I loved the Steampot. It was delicious! The clam chowder was ok. Hubby said he didn't really care for the dip in the sampler, but he liked that the popcorn shrimp was crunchy on the outside and hot on the inside. The calamari from the sampler was ok, but the balls of fire were yummy. After dinner I was craving dessert. I decided on the Sea Turtle Sundae. It was deliciously good!!! There are brownies, ice cream, candied walnuts, and caramel sauce on top. It was soooooo good! I shared with my dad and hubby and we all loved it. I duno what some of those other people were saying about it. I thought the ambiance and decor were fun. It's not a fancy place. You gotta get a Steampot and get your hands dirty! I'd definitely go there again.   Update: We're back again on Monday around 6:30 pm. There's no wait for a table because it's pretty empty. If you don't want to wait, I'd guess the weeknight is better to go."}
{"text":"Good $10 Burger With Onion Strings   Late night feeding after fear farm festivities on a Sunday night when only almost nowhere is open after 10pm...  I'm not a crab, shrimp or lobster fan like he rest of the group so I settled in for a burger and was not disappointed.   All in all the service was friendly and all was good in the neighborhood...."}
{"text":"I love the calamari!  The shrimp boil on the new patio menu is fabulous and plentiful! !"}
{"text":"OMG!!!  My husband put his business card in the bowl for a business get together for up to 20.  Well they drew his dard and for over a month have been planning this event. Today was the day.  We arrived and waited for the other members of our party to arrive. We were at this time informed 1 appetizer per 4 people. The waiter came over and introduced himself and proceeded to take drink orders. This is where things start to go bad.  First of all it was happy hour, but only in the bar. The waiter states you can not order in the bar and then take drinks to your table..  what gives!!!  One of our party members went to management and then they agreed to give happy hour drink pricing. Now it is time for the appetizers, there were 3 total. They  were brought to our table of 12, and with NO plates to share. The nachos were soggy before we got plates. Now we all ordered meals. This was fairly painless. They all arrived within each other so we all ate together.  One member had the all you can eat crab. Took over 30 min to get a one crab leg refill. The other 10 party members had already left. The drink refills were few and far between, the service was SUBPAR at best. When it was time to leave my husband went to management to critic the nights performance. I am pleased to say management agreed with this assessment and comped our next meal. I was soo utterly disappointed!!! If they do not improve soon, this location may lose business and have to close their doors like the  other tempe location. ."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for awhile but since the beginning of the year the food quality has taken a big step down. Second visit in the last month and yesterday will be my last. Father's day dinner as my dad wanted to go, waitress was on top of things but we got our food after the table next to us did and they sat down 10 minutes after we did. Food arrived and it was undercooked. I advised waitress and she had the manager come over. Very professional and offered free desert but appetite was gone. Bummer food used to be very good here."}
{"text":"I wouldn't eat here.. one of their franchises out in Minnesota 2 years ago have a placemat picture a black man being lynched.  And it's not the first picture of racism to be at Joe's Crab Shack ..they had to remove others all over the country.  Who wants to be associated with any company that is racist, past or present doesn't matter. Joe's Crab Shake is still a corporate franchise with racist ties. They have already had 40 locations shut down in the country and they can keep on closing. There are better seafood restaurants to put your money in that doesn't have corporate racist ties."}
{"text":"My family and I decided to grab a bite to eat today at this particular Joe's Crab Shack.  The food was great.  Our waitress Selma was extremely courteous and so was the management and hostess.  However, there were menus laying on the floor and a few waiters just decided to walk over them without picking them up.  Also, the scallops in my dish were not cooked properly AT ALL!  They were almost charred black. I know they're difficult to cook for someone inexperienced but they literally looked like they were rolled all around the grill.  Not appealing at all."}
{"text":"This was my first (and most certainly last) visit to this restaurant. We were seated in a half empty dining room and had to wait 30 minutes to place an order. The dinners were served 90 minutes later. Each of the six entrees were lukewarm. The fries were cold. The shrimp had no old bay seasoning. Popcorn shrimp was void of any flavor whatsoever. On a scale of 1-10, this meal rated a 3 at best, one level higher than Long John Silvers. At $150 for six meals, we would have been better off ordering a pizza and had it delivered to our boat. Never again."}
{"text":"We went in with a group of 4 on a Wednesday evening, with the amount of employees working it seemed like an even paced night. We were seated promptly as well as greeted and drink orders were given. Then the 15 min wait happened to get drinks delivered to the table. We ordered aprox 20 minutes into the visit and were served 20 minutes after order. Fish and chips were stale similar to microwaving normal fish sticks. Side orders were forgotten because waiter was not using note pad. Beer reorder was forgotten. This was our second visit here and will be the last due to not only poor service but lack of a decent sea food meal for the price."}
{"text":"I went there with a friend after a day spent in Henderson. I had never been to Joe's Crab Shack before, so I wanted to give it a try. This is a pretty good chain, but definitely nothing special.  Let's start with accessibility. It's pretty far east of the strip, but not too far from 515. The place offers a pretty large parking lot so parking should pretty much never be a problem.  We ordered the appetizer sampler and their bacon burger and both tasted reasonably good without offering anything special. For a place that is supposed to specialize in sea food, I would have expected more options along with more creativity with the food. Still decently good nevertheless!  To conclude, I would say that this is a pretty good place, but I would advise you to go only if you are already in the area and really craving some sea food. Feel free to message me for any additional details that you may need!"}
{"text":"Just a resounding meh.  This place is okay, but it's meh.  It's a chain restaurant, I didn't have high expectations.  My friend had the mahi mahi and I ordered the KJ Steampot, which had crab legs, mussels, and scallops.  I asked for mine with no mussels.  The waiter said that was fine but that I would not then get extra scallops.  I understood, I just really hate mussels but liked scallops.  It took FOREVER to get our food, so long that the manager came over and completely comped my KJ Steampot which was unexpected and nice of him.  So nice, I feel bad about this next part:  my friends mahi just sucked.  It was cold.  I think it must have been waiting for my meal to be served.  I could have made smething better at home.  then again, I could have hand reared the mahi mahi fish from egg to dinner in the time it took for our food to come out.  The presentation of my KJ steampot was cool, the scallops were on little sea shells.  They were also completely over cooked so they were chewy, and the flavor of the butter garlic sauce over powered them.  Basically there were a vehicle for garlic butter.    The crab legs themselves were also VERY overcooked which made them really hard to eat, the crab meat kept flaking in the shell and overall...just not amazing.  Also no happy hour except on Tuesday.  I will possibly be back, but it will be a while before I return!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, I really want to like this place.  I came once several years ago and did not have a positive experience, so we decided to give it a shot for a Sunday lunch, maybe the experience years ago was a fluke.   We walked in and the atmosphere was great, the people were extremely friendly and we were seated quickly.  We were seated in a booth that had good views of several televisions, as well as the interesting decor around the dining room, and the board with the specials.  Unfortunately, the dining room was extremely cold, and just seemed to get colder the longer we sat there...so off to the patio we went.  Sunshine, a light breeze, and now the pleasant lunch is back on track because we can concentrate on the food and not our teeth chattering.   Out appetizers arrive at out abel, the Garlicky Mussels, and they were phenomenal.  If you like garlic and mussels they are perfect.  Enough garlic in these things to make you vampire proof for days, but that is how I like them.  After a short time, our entrees also arrived.  Unfortunately, there is not as much positive to say about the entrees.  One platter included fish and chips, stuffed shrimp, and a crab cake.  Everything looked fine upon arrival, but the plate was so hot that the sauces provided were breaking in the containers they were in.  When we dove into the dish, everything was bland.  There was no distinct flavor to anything.  The other entree we received was one of their advertised specials, with a pound of lime shrimp.  Again, there was botany real flavor to the dish.    The food itself was not bad, but had no flavor.  Given the different textures of fish and seafood, this made for an extremely odd meal.  This place needs to add some flavor to their food to live up to the great service their staff provides.  I may try it again because of how awesome the staff was, but I think next time I may stick with appetizers."}
{"text":"Went in to this place lookin for crab legs ... Found the crab legs .. Yet it was kinda dead inside (made me nervous) but service from Nick was fast and the food was pretty good I got the garlic herb crab daddy bucket and my girlfriend had ordered the joes classic steam pot ,garlic herb style as well .. That sausage though was  delish  .. I will be comin back ...But next time I'm getting it Cajun style!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE!    I was sick for two days after eating here.   I was so sad, because I loved Joe's Crab Shack in Oklahoma City.  The decor is the only thing this place had in common with it.  The food was bland, and I missed two days of work from eating it."}
{"text":"Salmon was a good portion and delicious, but the broccoli and potatoes weren't fresh at all."}
{"text":"Unfortunately took a long time with my order . No check ins and the not worth the pricing for what I ended up receiving. The service was not what I was expecting considering we weren't there for very long . Seemed our waiter was more focus  on the newer table he got rather then ours."}
{"text":"Just had dinner at Joe's Crab Shack and I have to say that this is some of the best service we have ever had from a restaurant. Our server was Vimani and she was a very attentive and friendly and made our experience one to remember. Management was on point and extremely friendly, making sure all of our needs were met and our experience was good. we eat out a lot and his has far exceeded our expectations. If you plan on visiting Tempe, go to joes, get amazing sea food and great southern hospitality.  And if you get vimani as a server, you have one of their best servers   - Charlie and Madison"}
{"text":"I will never go back to this location. Me and my fiancée went here for Valentine's Day. It was busy, as we expected. There was a 35 min wait time which was fine, but the hostess, who was rude in the first placed, skipped over me and my fiancée until he brought it to her attention. That was frustrating, but we did get seated soon after that. The worst part of my experience was the food. I couldn't even eat mine. I tried my lobster and was disgusted. It had no firmness to it whatsoever. It was horrible! We both received significantly smaller portions than usual. Our bill totaled  $120. Money well wasted because I left hungry and extremely unsatisfied with the entire experience. I highly recommend people to stay away from this particular location."}
{"text":"This is a tough review to write because we've been dining at this location for over 8 years and it has always been consistently inconsistent.  For example, I like to order the fish and chips. Years ago, Joe's used a fish called 'Hoki' to make their fish and chips. You would receive three fairly generous-sized portions of fish. I had never heard of Hoki before, but combined with the batter mixture they use, it was a great flavor I couldn't get anywhere else.  A couple years later, they replaced Hoki with Cod and the portions became smaller, so I stopped dining there as often. When I finally went back recently, they've once again replaced the fish in the fish and chips. Instead of Cod, now it's Pollock and the portions were generous again (still three pieces.)  Over the years we've had bad service, but good food. We've also experienced great service with bad food. And we've had bad service with bad food and good service with good food.   I'm guessing this is because there is such a high employee turn over rate. I've met no less than 4 managers of this particular location over the years, and none of them are still there.  The restaurant used to have all these cool decorations adorning the walls and ceiling and a disco ball and lights that would come on when the restaurant got busy. The reason for that was to get all the wait-staff to dance and distract the customers while the kitchen could get caught up during the break. I thought this was a brilliant idea.  Unfortunately, someone decided that was out-dated and they have completely (and, in my opinion, unnecessarily) renovated the inside and removed all the cool decor, and even the large shark that used to hang from the ceiling. What a shame. Now its just bland on the inside. Nothing special. I wish restaurants would focus more on the quality of the food and the cleanliness of the restaurant. I don't go to a restaurant for the decor and I don't go to a museum for the food.  All that said, I'm happy to report that on my most recent visit, the food was delicious and the service was excellent. However, I was a bit worried that my order was forgotten. Typically a salad comes out right  away.  They ended up bringing the salad out at the same time as everything else. I have no idea why they did that, but it's the only complaint I have for an otherwise perfect dining experience.   I did like the Pollock much more than the Cod, but I sure wish they'd bring back the Hoki. That's what made them unique. Fish and chips is often made with Cod, Pollock, Haddock, or even Halibut. I've never even heard of Hoki before. What a shame they choose to be like everyone else when what they had was so unique and delicious and couldn't be found at any other restaurant that I've ever been to in the Phoenix area.  I was initially going to make this a 3-star review, but everything was done so well on my most recent visit, I've bumped them up a star. Now, if they could just be more consistent with the menu, the food quality and the service..."}
{"text":"The service was great but the food was mediocre. We both got the admiral steam pot and the crab tastes great for the first few minutes but gets cold fast. The corn was bland and lobster was nearly tasteless. We won't be back especially at $70 for two meals."}
{"text":"I've been to one of these in San Diego and we had a group go in today after a meetup. Quick food service, waitress and staff very nice, manager came around to see if everything was alright.   Food was good and plentiful but it turned out being $17.40 for a Dr. Pepper and Fettucini Alfredo Shrimp... can get the same thing at Chili's for like $11...  Idk did'nt seem like $20+ with tip was worth it  - just sayin"}
{"text":"Want better tips then practice better service like not slapping menus down on the tables and refilling drinks as needed and throw in a smile make people feel welcomed and not unwanted  Not going back...."}
{"text":"Wait staff needs to chill out, it's food, not a life changing experience. Shrimp Po Boy and Fish n Chips we're just ok, not special. Two different margaritas were average."}
{"text":"every month my grandma and i come to this location and grub on crab together. it's a great way for us to stay connected and enjoy delicious dungenus crab that was so easily accessible in the bay area.   we always get a cup of clam chowder and enjoy 'crab in a bucket' which gives us the option between dungenus, snow, or king crab. after we pick our crab of choice, we choose a flavor, place our order, and it's delivered to us within minutes.   i was reviewing the other reviews and i was shocked to read they had horrible or unpleasant service because we have always had great service, but maybe it's because i have my adorable grams with me.   for affordable seafood, a good time, and catching up with your grandma, i would definitely recommend joe's. =)"}
{"text":"My experience at Joe's was less than pleasant . We were seated promptly at our table and given menus . The kids menu was unreadable . It was simply printed on a printer that seemed to run out of ink . We sat at our table for more than 15 minutes before anyone came up to us . To make a long story short , the service here is horrible . The food is below average , seafood gumbo had shrimp shell bits and tasty like it was setting in the pot for hours . And to top it off , it's expensive . Our bill was 85.00 for me and my two kids . Avoid this place and go to angry crab if you really want good seafood and great service ."}
{"text":"I definitely love the food. I just never understand how a company doesn't have the proper number of staff working. We walk in and there are 20 tables wide open but they can't seat us because there's not enough servers. Of course this only means that 15 min later when we are seated that it takes forever to get served. So this affects the waiters tip. Smh. They have to do better!"}
{"text":"Had dinner with cousins after the WVU - Pitt game. My burger tasted like fish. Overall the service was great. There was only one obnoxious WVU fan & we apologized for him when he left. Seriously we're not all that bad."}
{"text":"I was happy with ny dish . Hubby had ordered steak told waiter plain steak. Didn't get it that way. Waiter apologize.  I will come back . Wish we had one in Prescott Valley. We need more variety up North. Also love the Peace sign tye dye t-shirts .well here the deal. Took my plate off ,not his. Had to re-just the bill.  They tried."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, having heard some good things from a number of folks, but in the end it was just kind of meh in my two visits.  The positives are the drinks, which are tasty and reasonably priced, and the apps.  We had a sampler on both visits and they were great.  The rest of the food? Only so so.    I had one of their fried shrimp dishes the first time, which was ok but not great, and tried the crapcakes on the second visit, which were middling at best. Kind of tasted like pre-made ones you'd get frozen to be honest. On our most recent visit, my wife had their seafood soufle thing (forget what it was called).  The seafood and cheese sauce were tasty, but it had a bread topping that was so thick the dish was pretty much predominately bread.   Service was decent on each visit, but the ambience is pretty much non-existent. They blast music so loud it is almost impossible to carry on a conversation at your table, or engage in any kind of normal human interaction.  Even our waiter had a hard time hearing what we were saying on the last visit."}
{"text":"Dirty table, bathroom, silverware and plates.  The appetizers came out cold and sloppy.  The potatoes were undercooked.  Not a fan."}
{"text":"The worst. Just left after 2 hours. Waited an hour before they told us they were out of crab - after we told them upfront that we needed to be in and out as quickly as possible. Our toddler only had 2 meltdowns - amazing since we spent 2 hours there when it was all said and done. They \"miraculously\" found some crab but it must have been 6 years old and at the bottom of their freezer because it was flavorless and over cooked. Luckily the manager comped that part. They overcharged us for the kids meal but I already felt so bad because it was my husband's birthday, that I just paid it so we could leave to get our son to bed. Bathrooms were gross and out of toilet paper. Everything was over salted. They don't even have real butter - just that melted kind that's so gross. If zero stars were an option, that's what I'd give them. Nothing. Yuck. Never going there again."}
{"text":"I rate this a 3 because it was an OK seafood chain experience. I try to avoid chains whenever possible, so I probably wouldn't go here again, especially since I was not blown away by the food.  We took the Monongahela Incline down to Station Square from Mount Washington. Now I've learned to go the other way because Station Square is a tourist trap! There is no local flair at all...your choices include a Hard Rock, Buca di Beppo, Houlihan's, Subway... We had never been to a Joe's Crab Shack so we decided to give it a try.   Our server Colleen was great. She happily answered questions about the menu and was very cheery overall. Great service really makes the meal and she did a great job. Plus, she shares my name and we had a little giggle about that.  We decided to go with the Mussels as an appetizer. The mussels were ok, but they tasted a little overdone.   We decided to split The Big Hook Up, which included Fish and Chips, coconut shrimp, crab stuffed shrimp, hush-puppies, coleslaw and their signature \"Great Balls of Fire\" which were deep-fried balls of dough stuffed with cheese, crab and jalapenos. It was plenty of food for the two of us to split, but I didn't really think about how the majority of it was heavy and fried. They gave you a sizable portion of each and everything was good. The Great Balls of Fire were definitely a favorite while the hush-puppies were very disappointing (I LOVE HUSH-PUPPIES) and very dry.  We sat outside so we had a pretty cool view of the waterfront and loved that we got to see a train go by while we were eating.   Overall, I wouldn't go out of my way to go back here, but it was an OK experience for a seafood chain."}
{"text":"Expensive and busy!  The food came out cold, but I got the bacon wrapped stuffed shrimp and if it would have been hot I would highly recommend!  Fun atmosphere but brought a child and not the best place for kids!"}
{"text":"I use to eat here all the time after a while everything started to change customer service and food went downhill, it takes them for ever to get my drinks n food isn't right last time we went it took them over 15 mins to get my drinks the place was empty  don't understand what took so long."}
{"text":"Oh God. So. I have never been to a Joe's Crab Shack. Though, I've heard stories about it. Mostly from my family. Namely my Mom. Every year around my brother's birthday I get this hour and a half long phone call from my amusing and horrified mother because my brother asks her to go to Joe's Crab Shack for his birthday. It's kind of funny to me. Probably because I don't have to partake in the festive activities. They're in Michigan and our birthdays are two days apart from each other. But I get this phone call and hear a whimper: \"HE RODE THE PONY AROUND THE RESTAURANT WITH A PARTY HAT ON.\" And then I laugh for a solid five minutes and ask her how the fried fish was.   I finally got to try Joe's Crab Shack on my own venture though with sister. Just not in Michigan. Unfortunately there aren't a lot of options around Station Square for fine dining and almost everything was a chain. So it was a toss up between Hooters, the Melting Pot, Houlihans, and this shizzle. Your utensils are presented in buckets. But we weren't going for fancy. Together we split an order of hush puppies, some kind of crab nachos and a side salad (to be healthy, you know). The hush puppies were way more cake like than I remember them supposed to be. Maybe the cornmeal just wasn't moist enough. And there were actual chunks of corn in them, which is a huge mega turn off for me because I hate corn. HATE. Because they are niblets and I'm WEIRD. But I will eat cornbread and other various things made of corn. The crab nachos were made with a mayo like paste. Kind of tasty but also kind of sickening and too heavy.   If we want to talk about sick, that was my drink. I can't remember the name but I remember exactly what it was: Landshark beer with tequila, lemon and hot sauce. The waiter joked saying, \"It might be too SPICY for you!\" It wasn't too spicy for me. It was just disgusting tasting. While MJ was trying to convince me 'to heal the world' in the background, I realized, you know, I'm not really missing out on anything. We don't actually need a Joe's Crab Shack in New York. This place kind of sucks. At best, it's just another Red Lobster minus those cheesy biscuits."}
{"text":"Meh, it's What you would expect from a moderate seafood place. The beach theme is decent, and the wooden tables add to the atmosphere. The decor, like most of their locations, is extremely cluttered. The T shirts and other items they sell are at the front when you walk in. It's really loud, so don't come here expecting deep conservations.  The wait wasn't long because we went early. The waitress was average, but didn't really stand out. She did her job, but that was about it.   I had the peel and eat shrimp appetizer. The shrimp were fine, but nothing beyond what I could do by defrosting shrimp from the grocery store.  The crab basket was nothing memorable and was a bit over cooked and too salty. I was not too impressed, since crab legs are fairly easy to cook.  Nothing really exciting here."}
{"text":"Had the rum  island shrimp it was really good but I found two short pieces of black hair on my plate while eating and everyone in my table had color hair and or long hair and no I was not rude to the staff working there but any how I told them and our server Sean was nice enough to handle it I got a new order of the rum island shrimp and they hooked us up only gave 3 stars because my stomach is turning not knowing where that hair came from ."}
{"text":"The best service as soon as we walked in drinks were served they said are we ready to party and eat good and we said we are more then ready we had little bite of every seafood plate almost and it was very tasty and the moonshine flavored drink were great combo nice buzz good food and our server was really friendly and the whole staff was too and the mgr came over to mak sure we were having a good time and we thanked him great lunch didn't expect to have this much of a great meal and drinking fun at the same time..... We will be back we were spoiled !!!!!"}
{"text":"Where do I start?? Ive been to several JCS's in the past but this one put such a bad taste in my mouth, I wont be visiting any of them, anytime soon. First, I wanna say it wasnt busy for a Saturday night but by the way are waitress \"Britanny\" was acting, you would think a tourist bus just pulled up. The 3 of us ordered cocktails and appetizers first, well the food came first, delivered by another person and cocktail arrived about 15 minutes after the appetizers. We then ordered 3 entrees thru Britanny and 2 entrees got delivered, I asked the food carrier where's his entree and she looked very confused and said, let me go check. Fifteen minutes later his food arrived, needless to say we were all pretty mad by then. We also asked  for extra garlic bread, well that was silly, we were done with are entrees by the time it came. Through this whole ordeal we only saw Britanny 2 times, she gets a \"F\" in are book. The manager heard are complaints and understood, discounted are bill and gave us a couple of appetizer coupons, not sure we will be going back."}
{"text":"Best food and drinks for great price, a happy hour favorite, the great balls of fire (yum), crab stuffed mushrooms wow and $3 hurricane, great"}
{"text":"Met some friends before a movie. I ordered the regular fish fry. The fish was hot and crispy. The fries were fresh made. Their coleslaw is awesome and I am a pretty picky coleslaw eater. I prefer a vinegar and there are few I like with a mayo base but this was tasty. Hope to go back and try crab cakes. Another item I love and am picky about."}
{"text":"Yeah -- this was a disappoint.  1.  We were seated and our waiter \"Brady\" took 30 min before coming over on a very slow night! 2. Nice warm evening so we opted for outside..big mistake..they have an outside play area and the children were screaming & throwing sand & running into the tables. 3. The food is cold when served.   Thumbs down for this visit."}
{"text":"Joe's Crab Shack is delicious, I give them 5 stars because, their staff is friendly especially Jamie :) she is always very helpful, kind, and cheerful. My daughter loves their food, it is our family's favorite restaurant. Therefor I strongly recommend it :)"}
{"text":"A bucket of crab partnered with corn on the cob results in a pretty happy self. Nothing outstanding, but everything you'd expect from a seafood chain. They even start the disco lights and do a little dance randomly during the meal. Left satisfied without hurting my wallet."}
{"text":"Joe's has excellent customer service,  food is amazing. They have a spectacular view of Pittsburgh from the patio. The vibe is fun , seafood all year 'round !"}
{"text":"I think that we will stop being customers of this business. Our crab cakes contained lots of meat but tasted so-so, and we did not finish eating them. The best-tasting food on our entrees was the French fries. The crab dip appetizer did taste good. The waitress was nice and prompt. Overall, the rating is 2 stars for the mediocre taste of the enteees, which left our stomachs hungry."}
{"text":"Yum Yum Yum!!  This place is one of my favorites. We met my daughter in law and her husband here for her Birthday with their 5 week old baby in tow. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. The food was very good and our waiter Matthew was great, gave us all custom bibs :-) Looks like they remodeled since our last visit and I liked the new look. The only reason for not a 5 star was I thought the prices were a little high and we had some trouble switching some of the side items. Not sure why they can't give my wife Broccoli instead of Potatoes!"}
{"text":"We decided to head to Joe's Crab Shack instead of the Rio Seafood Buffet and we are so happy about our choice! Our server was very helpful and friendly, and our food was ready within 15 minutes of our arrival to the restaurant. It was delicious and the atmosphere was fun. The manager came out to our table and made conversation that was entertaining and very welcoming. I am very glad that we chose this over another overpriced impersonal buffet."}
{"text":"My family loves to come here. Great for kids, great for adults. The kids usually get done quickly so they can play on the playground, so getting the kids to eat their food isn't a problem, the fact that they love the food helps too. We usually start with a sampler, but really to meal is big enough that you wouldn't need anything. Getting a bucket of seafood is wonderful, allows you to share, so you can get a little taste of everything. The service is the best, the waiters and waitresses have been perfect every time. Shrimp is going to pop in your mouth, crab and lobster is not going to be rubbery."}
{"text":"Have been to Joe's a number of times and enjoyed their food.  We have had terrible service every time, though.  It's worth going because the food is good and the atmosphere is fun.  Just be patient, and your night will be fine."}
{"text":"Update: since my last review they seem to have gotten their act together. My server was on top of things and the food was good. Glad tgeyve shaped up!"}
{"text":"It's a tourist trap with over priced old sea seafood and a gimmicky environment. Annoying people come to the table trying to get you to take a picture for a key chain and it's \"free\". Joe's is not the place it used to be and it's sad."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been going here at least once a month for the past year. If you think about how far this place is from any coast, the food is surprisingly fresh. They definitely have the most consistent crawfish in the whole city. Just remember, if something isn't in season, don't expect it to be amazing anywhere in a landlocked state.  They always seem to have a lot of new waiters, but everyone has a great attitude and tries their best. If you haven't ever been to Joe's before, it is usually loud and crowded; perfect for people with a noisy two year old who loves seafood.  If you go all out with the big steampots and drinks, expect to spend $30-$40 per person."}
{"text":"I am not a huge fan, but I have always liked the Steam pots. I went on Sunday after about a 6-8 month hiatus and the quality has really declined. Dinner came with potatoes that were frozen in the middle, and corn on the cob that was 1) not hot and 2) probably old enough to vote. Service was OK. They gave us an $11 credit to address the two bad steam pots and replaced the potatoes and corn. Unfortunately, the replacement items were not seasoned, clearly not fresh, and the corn had some black kernels on it. The crab seemed to also not be as good as it used to be there. Not sure if they just had an off night, but I don't plan to go back."}
{"text":"Just finished here, the portions were small but that's okay, seafood is always expensive. Gaberial was our server , he was awesome ! Such a nice guy . the crab was good and so was the calamari !"}
{"text":"Went Friday night, 6::00, figured to be waiting for a table, got right in. Awesome. We were looking for some quiet time to unwind, maybe Joe's atmosphere wasn't the best choice, but we were in the mood for crab legs....so. Basically, everything was good. Service was good, food was good. What I didn't like was people interrupting our meal to hustle raffle tickets for some charity promotion they were promoting. That might sound harsh, but if they want to donate, then do it, and if I want to donate, I will. I don't want to be hustled while I'm eating. Sorry. Looking for other crab leg joints....suggestions?"}
{"text":"It isn't that I didn't enjoy my food and the service.  It just didn't live up to my experience at other Joe's I've been to.  I have been to Joe's in two other cities and had better, more memorable experiences.    To some extent, we felt rushed.  Only a few minutes after taking our drink order, the server came back three times asking if we were ready to order.  I felt pressured to make a choice.  The drinks and appetizers came out very quickly as did our main meal.  Too quickly.  We had barely dug into the appetizers when the entrees were brought out.  Usually this isn't that big an issue, but when you are having one of the hot pots, you basically have to start eating it right away (because who likes cold crab legs or clams?).  We were there on a Saturday night, so perhaps they are set up so they can have a quick turn around and get a lot of people through with minimal wait times, but I personally like to take time to savor my meals.    If you like food with a kick, I highly recommend the \"great balls of fire\" appetizer.  Filled with flavor, but with just the right amount of spice to not kill your tastebuds.  For an entree, I had the Joe's Classic steam pot.  It was tasty, but didn't seem as flavorful as I had expected.  My dining companion had chicken tenders and he thought they were very tasty.  It is nice that they have options like steak and chicken tenders at a restaurant that focuses on seafood.  Many similiar locations have far fewer options.  Overall, food was decent and service was OK.  There are just a lot more restaurants that I'd prefer to visit again (or for the first time) before I'll come back to Joe's."}
{"text":"Ditry, Dirty, Dirty and I don't mean the rice!  I don't even know how to start this review. Positive first:  The food was pretty good, had calamari and hot pot of crab and clams.  They had a huge wait for a table and the hostess suggested we sit at the bar.  It was fine and we got good service BUT....... We sat too close and saw what really goes on back there.  Me originally from Calif. and being Calif State Certified in Food Saftey and Sanitation have issues with their food handling practices.  Here comes the BUT:  The bartender keep taking money, alot of cash $ and would ring up the sale and never wash his hands before dipping his hands in the ice and making a drink.  He would squeeze lime, lemons, break up mint but never once washed his hands.  I even seen him pull dirty straws out of glasses by the top of the straw and then make a drink.  Twice a manager looking type stepped in to make drinks, she walked back started making drinks without washing her hands, I must note that she did wash her hands before she left the bar area.  One other thing I saw that grossed me out...... A girl walked behind the bar, seemed like maybe she had worked eariler, she had her purse on her shoulder went to the tip jar and grabbed the $, she dropped the $ on the floor and picked them up, for some reason she dropped the $ again, she finally put them in her purse and walked over to the drink counter, with her purse on her shoulder made a drink.  OMG her hands had been everywhere and never, ever washed.  Don't get drink from the bar, especially ones from a glass, dirty hands all over the place, hands that dip into the ice bucket over and over.  Don't get me wrong, its a easy fix, they were very nice."}
{"text":"Really nothing special. The three of us ordered different pots and shared. Definitely too much seasoning on everything...too salty and took away from the  flavor of the food. I had to wipe some of the bay seasoning off my corn cob just to be able to eat it. Crab seemed just  a bit over cooked but okay The crawfish were ridiculously small and the biggest disappointment of the choices.  The andouille sausage was good.  Dessert was a cobbler which I did not finish as its consistency seemed not quite right. The service was however very good."}
{"text":"Great food, you get your money's worth here compared to their competitors in town. Atmosphere is fun for family or a date. Servers are friendly. Location is close to freeway and plenty of parking. I will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"I'm from NYC, we see these commercials all of the time, I was very curious.  Went after a hockey game and we were the only people there.  I was a bit leery, but decided to grab a bucket of Coronas anyway.  Got the crab and spinach dip.  It was delicious.  Honestly though if you are ordering a bucket, forgo the appetizer.  The crab buckets are huge.  With that said I got the Ragin Cajun.  It had a great seasoning with crab, shrimp, corn on the cob, potatoes and an andouille sausage.  The crab and shrimp were absolutely awesome, the corn was good, potatoes were ok and the sausage was eh.  It was a ton of food though and very fairly priced."}
{"text":"I ordered the Sam Adams steam pot, and it was pretty tasty.  However, most of the mussels were not in the shells and were pretty dry.  Tho good, i dont think i would order again. Don't get me wrong, the service and atmosphere was great, but the fact that i was still hungry after the meal was gone didn't justify the price.   The dessert was amazing (multi tier chocolate cake) and the beer prices were great) All in all the four of us had a great time, but for me, not fully satisfied."}
{"text":"This was our first time here at Joe's Crab Shack!! Def worth it!! The staff is extremely nice and helpful and the food was great!! Not to mention my tiki Mai tai. :) we will be returning to a joes in the future!"}
{"text":"Great seafood spot!  This is a great place to go if you love shellfish. They have different baskets of different combinations of them to choose from. The seating didn't take long, the service was pretty quick, and the food was delicious. I highly recommend the basket with the steamed mussels, clams, shrimp, corn on the cob, potatoes, and sausage!"}
{"text":"M and I have eaten here a few times and went again on Monday for lunch.  We had a gift card from Xmas and were happy to spend it.  I ordered the lunch portion of the Crawfish Etoufee and M had the lunch cocount shrimp and fries with a side of hush puppies.  The food tasted really good.   The etoufee had plenty of crawfish meat and was just spicy enough.  He had plenty of cocount shrimp and the hush puppies were SOOOO delicious.    We had their steam pots before that are served with corn on the cob and potatoes.  They were good, but the classic starts at $20 and you don't get that much food.  They do have a great collection of specialty drinks that I intend to work my way through.    The classic Joe's Crab Shack quirky decor is all around, along with an outdoor play area for the kids.  Too bad, I would have liked to see a sandy area with lounge chairs for the adults!  Ha ha."}
{"text":"Driving past this place everyday, and a lover of all things seafood, my boyfriend and I had to give it a try. Plus this place looked so fun for families from the outside since they had a children playground next to the entrance and a huge shark hanging from the ceiling on the inside.   Upon arriving we were seated right away and greeted by a server named Zuri. She was the best thing about this place and the best server that we've had in a very long time. She deserves 5 stars for her service. You go girl! :)  We ordered a large bucket of shrimp and a raging Cajun steamed bowl. The food was tasty but very salty and not worth the $ we spent. We paid about $50 for the two items and another $20 for two sangrias. We left hungry and went across the street for some Thai.."}
{"text":"This was my first time to this restaurant. I ordered the shrimp and fish plate. It was very good. My sister and brother-in-law ordered one of the steamers. It looked amazing. I tried some of their shrimp and crab and it was very good. I would recommend this place and it is also kid friendly."}
{"text":"It was the 1st month of year and it was already kicking our ass so some coworkers wanted to get together for an happy hour/dinner and the place picked was Joe's Crab Shack, alright I'm in.  I was lucky enough to work the early shift that day so another coworker and I headed off and got there around a quarter to 5, just in time for happy hour! 5 dollar drafts & apps! Hello!! So I ordered a blue moon or 2 or 4, whose counting lol and some crazy good crab dip.  The crab dip was loaded with crab meat in a melted cream cheese & parmesan mix, it was great! Went well with the Blue Moon!  Everyone arrived around 6pm so off to a table we went, I knew I wanted crab and that's what I went for!  A bucket of Queen Crab but in the Cajun flavoring, came with French fries and hushpuppies, it was 1 ¼ pound of crab, and it was good! I enjoyed my dinner! Service was great, food was good! Great times were had!"}
{"text":"The menu has changed.  The skillet paella dish has been removed.  Ended up getting two plates that was fried.  50%+ was breading.  The calamari was too large and rubbery. Not small and tender.  Should have gone to Pollo Loco in the Arizona Mills shopping center.  Our server Matt was attentive and very good.  The problem was with the menu.  Need more grilled or broiled items.  Crab cake was extremely salty.  Unless you are having a steampot, there are only a few items on the menu that are good for you.  Need more grilled/broiled items.  Too many kids wandering around without adult supervision.  Not a good experience with the exception of our server Matt."}
{"text":"If you love seafood this is the place to get it. Every meal is great and the  staff is very well versed in the menu."}
{"text":"Seating arrangement sucks.  Tried to seat me at a table with a booth and two chairs open area by the trash area."}
{"text":"Been here about 3 times before but this last experience was the icing on the cake... Made a reservation for seven people at 6:30pm. Arrive & the hostess says yes, they do have our reservation but many other people also made reservations so we have to wait 20 minutes. Hmmm. So, because we had a toddler with us we decide that instead of waiting we would just sit outside instead. After about 15 minutes without a server coming by I go inside & tell the hostess. Then the waiter comes over & takes drink & appetizer orders. Brings the drinks but forgets my husbands for about 20 more minutes until we finally ask for it. At this point the music turns up about 50% louder, blasting. We couldn't hear each other...it was crazy loud. We ask out waiter to have it turned down. At this point he gets very augmentative & tells a member of our party to go inside & hear it in there cause it's even louder in there & we shouldn't be complaining about it. Soo we ask for the manager, who promptly comes out & explains it's just loud for 1 song that they dance to inside. No problem, our server could've just told us that. Our food comes. No drawn butter or the metal cracking tool for the lobster claws. I have to go inside to find out waiter. Next we need to ask for refills on our drinks. At this point our waiter is acting like we are putting him out & a huge pain in his butt. I was a server, so I know how it is...but this guy is in the wrong field. The food was fine, but the service left a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"Good food. The server was very helpful. He was a bar tender too so double duty. Did a good job. It was very cool for the manager to introduce himself and ask about the service we were getting. This is our second time here. Good place"}
{"text":"Went in for my first visit last night with a party of 20.  Service was great but the menu consisted of nothing special.  This is one of those restaurants where you know one visit is enough.  Womp, womp."}
{"text":"The decor and the atmosphere is great, the food is awful, desert is worse...a complete waste of money...!!"}
{"text":"Love it!!! I love seafood and eat there all the time.  Great food at reasonable prices.  Always fun."}
{"text":"The only bad thing about this place is how much I overeat every Wednesday with their all you can eat snow crab legs.   I love it."}
{"text":"First thing first, I must say that I had amazing service here.I'm visiting my cousin's from New York and after shopping we decided to eat here for lunch and I must say wow.Once we arrived we were seated quickly and decided to sit outside. Our server (Adrian) was amazing. You can tell that he really enjoys what he does. I asked him to recommend a strong drink and boy did he ever. Our drinks came out pretty fast followed by our appetizers. He engaged us in conversation and we was talking about his tattoos.He was really friendly and made our lunch that much better. There was also another Adrian there  that made us laugh as well.The food was really good and fresh, I ordered the calamari which came with this really good dipping sauce,The shrimp buck has a nice kick to it if you like spicy.Overall I would definitely come back here again next time I'm in Arizona."}
{"text":"All you can eat Crabs .... YaaaaaayMatt was a great server and made sure the whole experience at Joe's Crab Shack was enjoyable! Great food, Great service, and everyone here was very friendly.. Be back next Wednesday for MORE CRAB LEGS!! :-)"}
{"text":"Service was decent - our waitress was friendly enough & fast.   Every now and then, the wait staff will come together and do the Macarena.  It's somewhat entertaining for the first 2 minutes, but gets a bit annoying beyond that.  Can't say much for the food.  Not too filling and not that tasty.  I guess you really can't expect too much from a seafood restaurant chain."}
{"text":"I am a Joe's Crab Shack lover. When I moved from San Diego and saw they had one here I was ecstatic! I had by birthday party there last year, my daughter's baby shower there in June and I take people there all the time. I took my daughter there for her birthday on Thursday, August 11. I ordered the great balls of fire appetizer  (outstanding) and two of the Raging  Cajun pots. Well I was totally disappointed. The Crab was cold, the Crab was old and very dry to the point I had to spit some out, the butter was cold and it wasn't even real butter, it tasted like Olive oil and when we ask for more it took over 7 min to get it and it was just as bad. I ask for more shrimp instead of sausage but that did not happen and when I tried to tell the waiter he said it was and walked away. The waiter started off friendly but as the night went on he was rude and unattending. As much as I love Joe's I may not come back. So disappointed! I still tipped him but 80.00 wasted"}
{"text":"Why did I come here when I know damn well there are great seafood places all around town?    When we got here, the place was empty.  The server was nice enough, but the food took forever to come out.  I had some sort of overpriced pot with crab legs and shrimp.  It was around 25 bucks and didn't even fill me up.  Joe's Crab is to seafood as Olive Garden is to Italian.  Just safe options that appeal to the masses.      For the same price at Hot & Juicy, I could have has 2 and a half pounds of Cajan snow crab.  Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere if you want seafood."}
{"text":"Last time we went to Joe's Crab Shack they changed the rules on us... I was a bit p.o.'d.....   But TGIF's was very accommodating....."}
{"text":"Two stars because the server and staff were great. The food was horrible. Get a clue, if you are serving snow crab legs, they should crack in half which makes it easy to get the meat out. They did not crack, they bent. Bent as in overcooked hours ago. Granted it was towards the end of the night but that is no excuse. If your doors are open, serve fresh food."}
{"text":"The food is okay.  The service is great.  And the staff is super fun."}
{"text":"I wasn't too hungry tonight, so i can only speak to the service, chowder, and dessert. The service was great. Our server took great care of my family even when the problem was my 7 yr old and not their fault. The chowder was pretty good. I've had better, but as my main dish since i wasn't that hungry, it was pretty good.   The fresh berry cobbler was very good. I ate way too much of it and still have hiccups as a result of that binge. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Fantastic food unbelievable we order crabs  It was taste so good. Customer service is awesome great server we had a great time at the restaurant on North rainbow Las Vegas would definitely recommend it to anyone who like crabs.  We enjoyed very much thank you."}
{"text":"I have to say it was not so good There food is :( Not like the one on lake mead and 95  There service was ask for many times To be getting the right stuff  We don't think will come back again:((((((((("}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Food is great, our server Styles was awesome he really took care of us. We even came here Friday where it was very busy yet style still manage to  accommodate us in every way. Thanks styles we need more people like you. I would definitely recommend this place not just because of the food but also the quality of service."}
{"text":"Food was excellent. The wait was kinda long. We really enjoyed our visit. Very attentive server. Prices were lower than expected. The food looked like the picture on the menu. Overall very satisfied."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a loooooong time, mostly because, you know, the fried food thing...not that they only fry all their food, only the good stuff like fried shrimp, fried coconut shrimp, french fries, fried crab cakes, fried beer...yeah pretty much that.   This was the first time sampling one of the 'pots' and I was impressed. Plenty of steamed and seasoned goodness of crab, corn, shrimp, potatoes and andouille sausage.   Service was good despite, and I'm not kidding, an unexpected group of over 100 in the same room.  Good times and good food. Cheers"}
{"text":"I was actually surprised with Joe's. The server at the bar really tried to accommodate my menu request and they changed up the menu. The crab cakes were phenomenal!!! Onion strings and fish were also very deelish. The place is huge with a lot of room. Servers were ever smiling and always friendly. 5 stars."}
{"text":"First time here was not a good experience - found a fly in my crab pot, 4 years later I thought I'd give it another shot...Big mistake! No fly but service & food was not good. Sampler Appetizer was cold & all you can eat shrimp was more like All you can wait!"}
{"text":"Great food, fun atmosphere, nice place for date night. Prices are a little steep, but definitely a great place to eat."}
{"text":"This is the place to go if you want crab!  There is no other place to compare with this place.  You order buckets of steamed crab in a steam pot which comes with a corn and potatoes.  You can get lobster and clams as well.  You eat with your hands.  You can spice it with garlic herb, BBQ etc. on the crab.  It comes with dungeness crab, snow crab and/or king crab.  This is the best food.  It is casual dining in a simple american rustic place.  Love them!  I recommend them to everyone from out of town.  Especially asians who visits the United States.  Just good food and fun to eat."}
{"text":"One of my favorite place to eat, JOE'S!!! Forget Red Lobster, if you want quality seafood and you are not by the ocean, this is THE place. One this occasion I wanted crabs (duh) and muscles. So what did I order? A steampot naturally! This pot contained legs, scallops, muscles, and the standard corn and potatoes.  As is tradition, I asked for a side of Old Bay and a bottle of malt vinegar to create my own paste, which I greedily dunk the meat in. The server, Nicole, was very patient as I requested these things and when I asked for Sweet N Low for my iced tea, I wasn't upset when she explained that they didn't carry it.   I got a side of hushpuppies to accompany my feast and was not disappointed in the least. I believe I may have converted Darren when he tried one after he told me he didn't like hushpuppies.   Growing up close to the Chesapeake Bay area, I have perfected the art of picking crabs and managed to get all of the meat out of almost every leg segment in whole. Darren loves watching me at work, never using a fork, and rarely using the nut crackers, or what they call crab crackers. These scallops were the best I have ever had! Seared on only one side and deliciously soft and juicy on the inside. The muscles were also amazing! I was saddened that I didn't have an endless plate of scallops and muscles. I have to say that I did have a pleasant surprise. When I was finished I looked under the plate that was in the pot and noticed an extra scallop and extra muscle! It felt like getting a small bonus!    I got the chocolate cake for dessert. It was huge! The flavor was ok, but I took home the few bites I couldn't finish and discovered that the cake tasted better after sitting in the fridge for a few hours.  I CAN'T WAIT TO EAT AT JOE'S AGAIN!"}
{"text":"I am a Joe's groupie. Their crab legs and steampots all rock my world as do their drinks and desserts. It's the next best thing to the type of places I went to when I lived down south."}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed myself at Joe's Crab Shack. The atmosphere is great for family and friends. The waitress was attentive and fun. It was my  boyfriend and I and our friends Vicky and her fiance Rob.   We started off with a bucket of shrimp nothing spectacular the shrimp was clean (that's all I ask for... devine  properly please). As for the main dish...I ordered Seafood Enchiladas, which was heaven. The best enchiladas I've had!  I topped it off with a Perfect Patron Margarita and I was good to go (other than the large amount of ice, it was good). My boyfriend, Vicky and Rob all had Joe's Classic Steampot, the waitress gave them their bib's and they went to town...crab meat was flying everywhere! At the end of the meal, we were satisfied and full. I would recommend anyone to Joe's Crab Shack!"}
{"text":"We went to Joe's yesterday to take my parents out for lunch. We are regulars and normally have a lovely time. However, this time there were some serious issues. All my elderly parents ordered was a bowl of soup each. The soup came out the FIRST time cold--ok, that is understandable. However, when this was explained to the waitress, Eryn, she was incredulous. It seemed to be beyond her grasp this was a possibility, and we must be witches with some sort of power over the space-time continuum because \"there is no way the soup could have gotten cold. It just came from the kitchen.\" After some discussion about the unbelievability of the situation, she agreed to get them new soup.   When she came back for round two (\"Ok, this time I saw it poured, and it was steaming!\"), once again, the soup was cold. This time I had a taste, and sure enough, it was tepid at best. Eryn was once again astounded, but gave the impression that we were beginning to annoy her with our requests for food served a the proper temperature. By the third try, they finally got it right. While the rest of us had almost finished our meal, their soup came out, and it was hot.  I understand that servers don't have a lot of control over what happens in the kitchen, and I am sure that Eryn was just having a busy lunch rush and didn't mean to appear skeptical and annoyed. However, there was NO visit from the manager to apologize for the problems, and both soups were on the bill. To sum up, it took them three tries to get a bowl of soup right, so my elderly parents had to sit there and watch the rest of us eat for most of the meal, AND they charged me for this experience. Really? No visit from the manager?!?!  I won't be returning to Joe's Crab Shack."}
{"text":"Love this place! It's always fun eating at Joe's. We celebrated my bestie's birthday at Joe's on Baseline last Sunday. Jesse was our server. He was excellent and very attentive! The wait staff make it fun by doing periodic line dances all over the restaurant. They also sing silly birthday songs to the birthday guests. \"I rode the pony and got crabs at Joe's.\" Be sure to check out the gift shop and the strategically stacked t-shirts. \"Got Crabs?\""}
{"text":"The food is kinda pricey but its good. The waitress that we got was kindda in a hurry to leave so she was kidda like \"hurry up\" and they were not even close to closing the restaurant.  She said she had to get her daughter from the sitter (well its kidda your job to stay and serve) if not call in that you can't make it to work. We asked for dessert and she rolled her eyes.. well we didn't leave a tip."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of seafood bit this place is Fantastic! Their sampler is to die for! I got the coconut shrimp and the smores dessert, yummy! Our server, Juan did fantastic and was such a fun and sweet guy. There's something to be said for attentive and fun staff. The atmosphere is a ton of fun and the portions are huge! I will definitely be returning. Even though we came on a huge celebration night where a ton of people were present, the food was still perfect and the staff treats you like long term friends. 5 stars easily. Keep up the fantastic work guys!"}
{"text":"Food was delish and service was super amazing!!  As soon as you walk in you're seated right away.. Surprising since we came on Valentine's Day. All the workers were in a great mood which I loved! I'm big on great service and that's exactly what they gave! The manager also walked around to introduce himself and thanked us for choosing them to eat at. He also gave up \"7$ off\" card for our next meal. Super nice! Our server was a sweetheart as well and very quick!  Our food was delish! I got the lobster stuffed shrimp which came with chips and coleslaw and I got a small side of the dirty crab rice! My boyfriend got the east coast platter which came with crab stuffed shrimp, crab cake, fish and chips, and onion strings! Although I wasn't a big fan of the plain chips (which I probably should've substituted for something else) both meals were super delicious and fulfilling! We both got strawberry peach sangrias.. Can never go wrong with sangria mmmmm! It came in a mason jar that we were able to keep PLUS our servers brought us 2 extra to take home! Super sweet of her!  Definitely comin back whenever we're cravin seafood!"}
{"text":"Our server Gera, was great and the food was suprisingly fresh and tasty! I was pretty impressed. Got Queeen crabs and my kiddo got the kids snow crab bucket (how cool is it that they have a kids crab bucket?!) with shrimp, corn, sausage and potatoes. He loved it! Then they had great perfectly portioned kid desserts for under $2. Did I mention there is a playground attached?! Can't wait to go sit out on the patio once the weather cools down. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Comming from Westport Washington we got our dunginess crab live off the boat and had it consumed within the hour!  Only Joe's comes close to this experience.  After 5 years of eating there = this is the best!!!  Ted H."}
{"text":"Took the fam. Wasn't busy. Got seated right away. Not a huge seafood fan, but the kiddos wanted to go. Service was great. Got the fish and chips. Three nice sized pieces of fish. Fries were soggy, but that's because I drenched them in vinegar and salt. Yum. Asked for extra tartar sauce and actually received enough! My daughter got the steak. Youngest got the steam pot kids meal, and my wife and other son split another full-size steam pot. Good all the way around. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Good food average service tonight with a stuck up bartender. Another bartender who left early was awesome."}
{"text":"Love this place and the staff is excellent. Management will put on a song and dance with you after time that they do their thing."}
{"text":"I've been to this Joes quite a few times.  Most of the time our service and food was pretty good.  The prices are pretty steep for me, which is why I come maybe twice a year.  But their drinks are a good size and aren't badly priced.  However, this last week I went with some friends for lunch, and I was pretty disappointed.  Our server, Sean, was great.  He had a great attitude, knew the menu, I have no complaints about him.  I enjoyed his service.  I ordered the Mahi Mahi tacos, which is usually what I get for lunch.  They are normally very good, excellent flavor, and very filling.  However, this time my tacos were horrible.  One taco had a lot of fish and slaw, the other two hardly had anything.  And the fish itself didn't taste like Mahi, but rather very bland, and the sauce that comes with it was sparse.  I was not happy.  I don't really know if I will want to come back."}
{"text":"The wait was not long to get a table,  our server Morgan was great, friendly and attentive. The food was amazing. We always get the steam pots, we tried the bucket of shrimp, which was great. A few new menu items, next time we will be more adventurous and try something new. My go to is always the Rajun Cajun, and have never been disappointed. The staff is all great and interactive. The GM Steve has always stopped by our table to check on our experience. I go to both locations, but this one is my favorite. It is always a very welcoming experience."}
{"text":"CRAB CRAB CRAB... Great place for seafood lovers!!! My drink was good, service was very helpful and friendly!!! I'll probably go back!!!"}
{"text":"Ehhhhh I think Joe's has gone downhill in the last few years. I don't think I have had a great experience at a Joe's in a long while and by a while I mean at least 3 years maybe even longer and it used to be great.   Well first off the food was not fresh or hot like it should be. They have a great selection but it just isn't good food at all. I think you can get fresher fish at a Long John silvers. The steam pots ate good, I have had better though! Prices are high considering the quality. The drinks tasted watered down and are way over priced. Service was OK had to wait at times for way to long. They were polite but just not attentive. Won't be back unless I hear they make some changes!"}
{"text":"I was reminded why I hadn't been to joe's in a decade. The bartender was awesome but the food...not so much. Tasted like it was reheated from frozen. Sorry Joe's."}
{"text":"If my partner were to write this review, it'd begin with, \"Can you believe they make you shell your own crab!\" Let's just say he wasn't a fan of the experience of breaking down a lobster and crab legs.   I loved it.  It may be sloppy and sometimes crab shells may pop you in the face, but the juiciness of the meat is so worth it.  The lobster was a bit on the overdone, rubbery side, but the crab was cooked to perfection as expected from a place that specializes in crab.  The potatoes were delicious and the corn was a bit on the over seasoned side.  Correction: only one side was seasoned, and seasoned heavily, while the other side was good.   Joe's is probably one of the most consistent chains out and one of the few I will return to.  The only reason I cringe at going back is the song and dance.  It can be a bit overabundant and take away from the dining experience.  The song and dance also distracts from good service.  It wasn't bad, just not good."}
{"text":"Well why in the heck!!! Would you come to Joe's Crab Shack and not order the crab!! Why would Joe's run the same promotion that it has run the previous 2 years and change that you can't order a crab dish and get one free the server should have warned us that we couldn't order any of the crab dishes answer that!"}
{"text":"We love Joe's Crab Shack. It's our dining choice in every place we visit that has one. Last night's dinner was great as always. The service was superb and quick!"}
{"text":"Had the KJ Steampot and the Southern-fried lobster.  Drinks were generous and came in a take-home Mason jar.  Good service and reasonable prices.  Would return..."}
{"text":"An incredible meal at Joe's Crab Shack for My Wife and I and even my 5 year old boy had no complaints. We started off with the Great Balls Of Fire appetizer, which is jalapenos, cream cheese, crab, breaded and fried. Each is freshly made per order. They had Outstanding taste and worth every bit. For Dinner we had The Grill Daddy Feast Steam Pots, that consist of Alaskan King Crab, Snow Crab, Shrimp, Red Potatoes, Corn on the cob, all in a Steam Pot of a well seasoned Broth. All had soaked in the tasty seasonings making everything in it mouth watering good. Both types of Crab were sweet and meaty, the whole pot was outstanding. Watch those Kings though, they like to prick you with their sharp thorns, and mine got me good. But I pushed onward. My son said to say that the Fish Fingers and Fries for kids was a great pick for any kids. Our server Lisa did an awesome job too. Basically, We have never had a bad visit to Joe's."}
{"text":"So this is chain. I may have set my expectations a bit high. I get that. But bibs? Where you've written things on them I can't read? Not cool folks, not cool.   The crab was excellent, but at 30 bucks for four big legs, it seems rather steep. Perhaps I'm still an undergraduate at heart when it comes to my checkbook. Plus, yes I know we're in the middle of the desert, but come now folks - it can't cost that much.   Over all I give you 3 stars. Because in the desert I have yet to find better seafood, however I think I just need to take more trips places where seafood is more prevalent."}
{"text":"Had such a great time at Joes! The waitress, Haley, was awesome! Extremely friendly and took excellent care of us. It was nice that one of the managers dropped by and asked how everything was. He was super-friendly and thanked us for coming by! I love the atmosphere and happy employees. That makes a huge impression when the staff is actually happy. I ate the salmon and would recommend that! It was cooked perfect. Overall, this was a great experience and a great place to eat for a date night with the wife!"}
{"text":"Great, fun atmosphere, and good food! What more could you ask for?!"}
{"text":"I honestly don't know how this place can have less than 4-5 stars.  The food is very good.  The service is always great.  Beth and Jen are awesome bartenders.  Beth has now served me twice and both times she's had a great attitude, is attentive and awesome. Donny I think is a manager he's always on the floor and checking in with me making sure I'm ok. I Jamie is a manager too and she was awesome helping everyone out and checking on me.  I will definitely be back to this place.  Thank you for awesome service."}
{"text":"Table was so dirty and we have to ask for cleaning. waiter dud was pritty friendly thats why i gave 3 stars. Manager was so great and come few times and ask how we like the food. hopefully he can goto kitchen and cook him self, food taste would be better. We knew he wanted to make thing pretty positive and tell you to do change from the hostess to the chef will be making the better place to eat."}
{"text":"The loud club music while trying to eat is very obnoxious. I've never heard such a thing at any of the Joe's I've been to on my travels."}
{"text":"Our first experience with Joe's Crab Shack. It was delicious!  The Malibu Shrimp (12 grilled shrimp) with dirty rice was so good, I stuffed myself. I even ate every bit of rice! My husband had the Coconut Shrimp, too many for him to eat! The dipping sauce was so delicious. We both really were glad we came here. Ask for Alissa ' s section, very attentive, wonderful service!"}
{"text":"Been to many Joe's Crab Shack's and this was by far the worse I've ever been to.  The crab legs were cold and shrunken terribly in the soft plastic like she'll."}
{"text":"I went there last night with my girlfriend in this place has changed  for the worst,!! ordered shrimp on the skewer with rice and vegetables, First of all the shrimp was micro sized I've never seen  small shrimp like this , the rice was uncooked , the potatoes were uncooked as well as the vegetables, and most of all it was all in small portions, I would never go here again!!"}
{"text":"AWFUL is the only word to describe this experience would of understood if the restaurant was busy. The one entree was not up to standard but since server constantly disappeared could not say anything . I definitely feel that this is turned me away from Joe's crabshack the food was all right but it was difficult to enjoy when the other entrée it was not edible. Was there a half hour before the server reappeared. Would love that they would see this and reach out to make said love to go in detail with the management. Have to say this company's guest relations text comments very seriously and has changed my mind and I will give them another shot"}
{"text":"Overpriced mediocre food. My party left unsatisfied and needing a gallon of water.   Calamari to start as an appetizer. It was rather greasy than crispy. Portion was generous but that doesn't say much when you just get a basket full of greasy mess.  I ordered Maine Grill ($26). For a second I thought it was a good deal because according to the server, it comes with a plate filled with lobsters, bacon wrapped shrimps and scallop with dirty rice.   Dirty rice is way too salty. It is so salty that I kept needing to ask for a water refill. Lobster? Barely any meat on them. Mostly shell that made the plate look full. It's ridiculous how there's barely anything on the plate, just a plate full of empty shells to add to a good presentation.   Also got a bucket of King's Crab ($32). You get to choose a flavor and we went with garlic herb. This was definitely worth it.   Lastly I got their Blackened Mahi Tacos ($11) to go. Although the grilled mahi was a nice big piece, it was dry and tacos overall were bland.   Service is friendly and cheerful. Super upbeat staffs that danced around. I love the energy and good vibes which makes for a perfect place to drink and have a good time with friends and family. Service is the only reason for 2 stars, otherwise it would be 1 star. I won't be back."}
{"text":"I drove to Joe's after seeing the \"Southern Fried Maine Lobster\" commercial and now wished I would have stayed home and made a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.  What you see in the commercial [lots of lightly breaded lobster] is absolutely not what you get......Sure, if you enjoy dragging a mound of overly seasoned breading through equally over-seasoned butter, then go nuts!  But if you are looking for lobster, you'll need to go \"Indiana Jones\" on your plate of food...... and if you're really lucky, you'll find lobster...............but only the tips of the lobster claws and a few random claw knuckles.  I 'dug' through two plates [I sent the 1st one back] and after an exhaustive effort, came up with maybe 3 ounces of actual lobster surrounded by over a pound of breading.  The mac & cheese was good, as was the corn, but you will not find a more cut-and-dried case of  bait and switch anywhere [pun intended].  So if you are looking for lobster......look somewhere else."}
{"text":"Crabs in a bucket + Playground + Picnic Tables + Friendly Service= High Return Factor  The last time we were in a Joe's we were visiting Tucson and we were overwhelmed with loud music, obnoxious waiters and a line dance that wouldn't stop.  So with that memory we weren't rushing to come in to check out this local eatery.  My husband swore he wouldn't go back-well, I changed his mind.   We sat in the outdoor dining area, complete with wooden picnic tables and located next to a sandy-filled play area which the kids loved and so did I.  This was the perfect lure.  I was able to take my time and read the menu, order a cocktail (complete with a toy shark) and we enjoyed some steamed King Crab Legs (which I highly recommend), a side of scallops (which were teeny tiny) and some corn on the cob and potatoes.   Overall the menu and the service was enjoyable. I loved the kids menu which also offered crab legs!  I love a kids menu that features the restaurant specialties and not just a frozen heat up plate of nuggets.  Overall a convenient nice place to stop when you want some good food, decent prices and a fun atmosphere without going over the top (at least it was on our visit)."}
{"text":"The food was excellent. Our hotel provided a voucher for a free appetizer. This appeared to be fine. However when the check arrived, the appetizer was charged. The waiter had the check reissued. This time we were credited for the app, but a second app was added!  This was no mistake. We will never return. BEWARE!"}
{"text":"First time here, came with my son because he wanted to try lobster, the food was great! Service was excellent ! Our server was very friendly and awesome! Robert, the manager on duty came by our table to make sure everything was great. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Everything tastes so good behind these walls from the seafood to the mason jar drinks.  I am a regular and plan to continue that trend."}
{"text":"I normally don't get too excited about dining at a chain eatery, there are a few that I really like, and Joe's Crab Shack is one of them. Yes, I know most of the shrimp is frozen and prepared elsewhere and shipped to the 200 or so Joe's all over the country. Maybe it's the atmosphere, location, I think it's all of those reasons, and the food. I did a quick tip and proclaimed the burger with the fried shrimp and Cajun mayo one of the finest burgers I've ever had. Think about it, a juicy quarter pound burger still pink on the inside, a handful of tender fried shrimp on top of that. Purple onion, tomato, shredded lettuce and a huge dollop of spicy Cajun mayo that tastes so good it makes you want to swear. That's not all, the salads are amazing, the crab pots are good but not my thing. Onion rings are a Joe's specialty, I'd walk across broken glass and hot coals in a two dollar pair of Old Navy flip flops for those onion rings. Leave it to me though to go to a seafood place for a burger, but i say build a better burger and they will come. For an appetizer I love the spicy stuffed mushrooms or the crab cake. Not the best crab cake mind you, but it will do to take away the craving. I wash it all down with a super sweet and salt around the rim \"Shake a Rita\". It's not a meal I'd eat weekly or even monthly, but when the gang says let's go to Joe's I'm the first in the car with mouth watering!"}
{"text":"I've gone to Joe's a couple of times and I was disappointed both times.  The first time I got some platter and it was so bland and one note. It all was just heavy and fried.   Last night I went and got some soup and salad. The clam chowder was terrible. It literally tasted like buttery milk with some weird textured potatoes. The Caesar salad was standard.  I love the ambience. I love how fun it is. The manager came and talked to us which was nice. I never got my water refilled until before we left.  I always assume chain restaurants have good or decent service but I guess not.   The seats are crowded. Hard to get around.  I'll give them another shot and get a steam pot or something but I believe I'll stick to hot n juicy for seafood with corn and potatoes in a bag lol."}
{"text":"Came to Joe's Crab Shack and didn't eat any crab...  Wasn't terribly impressed by this place. The whole experience was very average bordering on below average. Got seated in what I can only assume to be the bar area because they asked, (didn't card) if we were over 21.  We ordered:  Cup of Clam Chowder- 3/5 Decent cup of clam chowder but it was really gritty which I don't like, but other than that the flavor was good.  Shrimp Alfredo- 2/5 One it was penne pasta not Alfredo. Two the shrimp were under cooked to the point where I was too scared to eat them so I just left them on the side of the plate. Three the Alfredo sauce was missing something. I don't know what it was but it just fell short.  Grilled Shrimp Salad- 4/5 This wasn't bad. We didn't like that it came with hush puppies in the actual salad but those were easy to pick out.  Maybe we should've gotten crab, but for the prices we saw the amount of crab people were getting and it just didn't seem worth it to pay that much for such a small portion of Crab.  This place just isn't for me."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to a Joe's Crab Shack. I had to ask the hostess to be seated twice as the first time I asked they were distracted helping someone else and never wrote my name down. Once we sat down the wait for our server to even approach us was about 15 minutes. Our server was not very approachable or nice (no judgement, everyone has bad days) but it just sort of put a damper on the mood. Once the food came, the bucket of king crab and clams were ok quality. I think the overall price of everything was way too high for the amount and quality of the food you get. One redeeming quality was the manager walking around in a crab hat who seemed to be the only person who genuinely cared about everyone's dining experience. Glad we went to get our seafood kick but probably won't be coming back."}
{"text":"We went to Joe's for a friend's birthday (at her request). The service was ok, but the food was ...not awesome at all. We all ordered Steamers ('cause they seemed like fun). They're not terrible ...but it seemed like they were all pre-made somewhere far away and not as fresh as they could have been. It was a fun place with lots of potential ...but unrealized potential during our visit."}
{"text":"First timer here at this establishment in Tempe.  Doesn't look like much from the outside, but inside is nice, clean, and casual.  Wait help are dressed in the Joe's Crab Shack t-shirts (that are also available for sale)  Did not have any appetizers, but started off with some cocktails.  Hubby had their Bloody Mary (spicy) and it was outstanding.  I should have had this instead of my usual.  We both had the Samuel Adams Steampot that consisted of lobster claws, snow crab cluster, clams, sausage, potato and a cob of corn.  It's steamed with Sam Adams brew.  It was very good for a casual place.  Love that Old Bay seasoning was used.  Skip the butter that they serve with the food -- just dip your seafood in sauce at the bottom of your plate of the steampot -- makes a world of difference.  Service was excellent and staff were helpful, courteous, and friendly.  Would definitely return to this place on our next visit to AZ.  Want to try everything on their menu."}
{"text":"The food is not bad , but the place is super filthy every where I can't imagine the kitchen, the bloody marry is good, nice ceiling lights"}
{"text":"Closed. Good. Went for lunch before a flight, and the server was so uninterested in assisting us. She was wrapped up in some conversation with other staff at the bar, whenever she was done speaking with us, she went straight back to that barstool. Still, we were just craving some good shrimp, so we got the platter. We barely got into our food when I noticed the shrimp were not cleaned before cooking!!! When the woman eventually showed back up, I pointed out that these shrimp were not prepped.   \"Oh, yeah. We don't devein our shrimp here. I guess that is an issue for some people.\"  She may as well have said, \"Yes. We feel that most of our patrons would enjoy eating shrimp poop!\"  Neither of us could get through the meal. I live in the South. Like, Deep South. We've been to plenty of places where the grind of sand covers the floors and sticky salt air coats everything; but they can clean and properly cook a damn shrimp!  \"We don't devein our shrimp....\"  Haunts me to this day."}
{"text":"Steamed crab legs were perfect. Chose our own seasonings. It is a treat to go, after tip $75 for myself, one teenager and two littles. Fun times making a mess, thank goodness for the large crab bibs."}
{"text":"Joe's Crab Shack never does wrong. I have been here a few times, and have enjoyed every meal. This particular meal the service was great, as refills were on spot at all times.   This time I opted for the Shrimp Trio which consisted of crab stuffed shrimp (YUM), grilled malibu shrimp (served with a unique flavor of sweetness and spice), and coconut shrimp (with a marmalade sauce). The meal came with steamed broccoli as well. As far as the flavor goes, it was amazing! I usually go for a pot of crab but was feeling on the lazy side.   Everything from service, to food, to atmosphere was great. I recommend this place to families and friends that are looking for a good catch from the ordinary."}
{"text":"Kind of a dysfunctional place on the evening of 12/12/11.  Wait staff was in a bit of an argument with the kitchen staff.  Not much oversight.  I ordered the fish and chips, and it was served with burned pieces of deep fried fish batter chunks.  Not a great presentation.  We should have gone elsewhere, and will in the future."}
{"text":"I hate to start out a review with words like \"terrible,\" \"horrible,\" and \"sucks\" but there's no choice here. This place is all that and more. The pits... with sprinkles.   My complaint is not even the childish decor which looks a massive toy box explosion while the walls were covered in glue. Or the bedazzled staff with multiple points of flare.... So early 80's.  My party arrived early, like old people early-bird early, the hipster young folks weren't even awake yet. This didn't stop the good people at Joe's from creating a violently loud, incredibly obnoxious environment for us.    Within in minutes the Bee Gees came over the PA system at about 125 db, so loud you could feel it in your soul.  It was \"Jive Talkin.\" The tired, sad, middle aged food server then jumped up and started dancing. It wasn't festive or cheeky. It was sad and pathetic. Was this a restaurant? Or was a freak show trying to mask the fact that their food ain't all that?   I'll never know.  I asked the silly girl posing as a hostess how often this Bee Gee atrocity occurred. I was hoping it was a one time thing for somebody's birthday or something. She stopped twirling her hair and thought for a moment . She then advised it happened every 45 minutes.  She added with disinterest that if we ate really fast we could avoid the next deafening catastrophe.   Now that's customer appreciation!  We left without ordering. A dime would not be spent from my pocket at this dump. We went down the road to another location I shouldn't mention (but I will: it was Red Lobster) and enjoyed a great dinner with great service.   Never again will enter this establishment. I don't know how others do.  The real tragedy of this experience: this Joe's Crab Shack has ruined the Bee Gees forever for me."}
{"text":"Best place to get sea food at affordable price and great drinks don't go anywhere but here for seafood other places are joke and the prices are crazy for nothing and the service is great and clean restaurant"}
{"text":"Believe all the other reviewers on this one.  They are all very accurate.   Despite that,  I decided to try it last night because it's close and we felt like seafood.   Now the food is not so bad that it's inedible, but it's nothing incredible, and you can get much better elsewhere.  And the guy who said the margaritas are weak, well I can say that the mojitos are very weak as well.  Our waiter was too busy chatting and trying to hook up with the hostess than to wait his tables.   Everything about this place is mediocre."}
{"text":"I'm puzzled with all the negative reviews? My hubby took me here for nice Saturday afternoon lunch and if was wonderful! I got the Queen crab bucket and had it prepared with a spicy boil Old Bay bay on top and it was out of this world! Service was great and the drinks were awesome! All around great experience!!"}
{"text":"This is the best Joe's Crab Shack I've ever been in and the hardest working staff I've seen at any restaurant."}
{"text":"Food is decent. Pricing is ok. Good atmosphere. Staff was doing pretty good until about 7pm when it got really busy and we had to wait 15 mins for the check, another fifteen minutes after that for desert (even though it was ordered before the check) then another 15 mins to get out cc ran for dinner. Offers seating inside and outside."}
{"text":"Food was great. Service was even better. Took a party of 18 and they were so accommodating! The Manager, Wade, was so helpful and took the time to check on us several times. They gave us a more family friendly area and we were able to hear each other and feel like we were hanging out. It's still pretty pricey but seafood brought from the coast is. Most had the build your own steam pot and that saved a few bucks. Playground is great for kiddos too. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Gotta love crabs! The steam pots are delicious. The raging Cajun steam pot is so flavorful and the perfect amount of food.  The crab dip and jalapeño balls are amazing! They also have a great kids menu that my kids always loved"}
{"text":"Good Food Excellect Service from Our Waitress. Only thing i Have to Say is Don't order the lobster unlelss you like eating shoe leather."}
{"text":"Should have written this sooner. Was here last summer while visiting in Sierra Leon and we stopped here for dinner the night before I returned to DC. The steamed King Crab was fabulous as was the service. Wish I could remember out waiters name, but he was attentive without being pushy and had a great sense of humor. Our dinner was so good. I truly had not expected the crab to be so fresh and succulent. I will make sure to stop here again when I'm in town."}
{"text":"Being a popular chain restaurant, these guys are decent. Granted, I only ordered shrimp/calamari combo w/fries. All deep fried too. Was pretty good but used a little too much breading for my liking (it shouldn't overpower the seafood).  Our server was energetic and engaged w/our table, I felt. Did frequent, but not pesty, check-ins.   Their \"fun dance\" time is a nice touch and I assume it's one of their trademarks. But. I do have misophonia (certain pitches and tones are painful and irritating to me), so this was triggered during a few of their interactive dance sessions. Just please turn the volume down and add more bass/less treble? For the love of God. Because I was triggered, I shoved even more fried goodness dipped in tartar sauce. It did work.   Although it's not Pacific NW seafood quality (due to geographical location), it is decent in Sonoran desert."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant for my grandson's 9th birthday party. when we arrived, we ordered drinks. I ordered a Corona light and it smelled  like a skunk. I had the waiter smell the beer and he agreed and brought a new one. Every one ordered their food. I ordered the double lobster dinner with clams and other items. The lobster was totally overcooked, the clams were like little hockey pucks. My wife ordered the jumbo stuffed shrimp and was surprised to see the size. We have had larger shrimp in shrimp salad. It was a joke. We had 10 people, and not one person enjoyed their meal. We will not be going back."}
{"text":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSFpcNUTy0c  All you need to know about my experience here. In short, eat literally anywhere else, it'll be better."}
{"text":"I live in Maryland but have visited Pittsburgh twice (July 2008 and July 2009) as a mini vacation with the wife and kids. Both times I have eaten at the Station Square location. The first time was for lunch before we boarded the Gateway Clipper steamship. This place instantly became a favorite of my two boys (ages 4 and 7). Months after I visit, I ask my oldest son what was his favorite part of the visit to Pittsburgh and he says \"eating at Joes Crab Shack\". The food here has always been good, I cannot remember what we ordered in 2008 but I know it was great and the service is better then most places and that is amazing for a chain. Our 2nd visit was for 4th of July weekend and we ate there on the 3rd, not overly busy and we were seated right away. I wasn't too hungry so I figured a burger would be a light fare. I ordered the Surf and Turf burger thinking it would be skimped on becuase most platters with seafood the portions are stingy. But here that burger was a mouthful and then some, I literally sprained my jaw trying to open my mouth wide enough to take a bite into the burger. I was beyond full with that meal. My kids ordered off of the kids menu and ate almost all of their food (not an easy thing to do as they are picky eaters), so that is a testament of the quality of their food. Joe's crab shack has now become our family's place to go to eat out as a family, just like how my family did when I was a kid. We live near the Gaithersburg, MD location and frequent that location because of the good times and food we enjoyed at the Station Square location."}
{"text":"Sunday was a beautiful day - high of 78 without a cloud in the sky - and I was craving seafood and a pretty view for lunch. I had never been to a Joe's Crab Shack before, but my husband runs by this location frequently and mentioned that it would be a good place to hang out by the river.  Station Square seemed a little busy (for Station Square) so I hopped out of the car before my husband parked to grab a table. I wasn't surprised that the inside of the restaurant was very quiet - only 5 or 10 parties - but I was surprised that the outside wasn't even full. The two of us were seated at a large picnic table - that could seat about 8 people - and enjoyed the beautiful outdoors under a large awning.   I started with the Southern Spiked Tea, which was a good sized beverage served to the brim of a mason jar. The alcohol content was low, but it was a tasty drink. For my meal, I ordered the Seaside Platter with a side of Hushpuppies. The food was as I had anticipated - descent fried seafood on the pricier side. Our final bill - for my drink and meal and my husband's meal - came to $55. If we had eaten in the smelly (fishy) interior on a crappy day, I would've been crabby about this cost, but I thought the view and weather alone was worth a good amount.  Though not blown away by the food, I was delightfully surprised by the service. Our waitress checked back with us multiple times, bringing us several refills and a couple different condiments. She wasn't the most bubbly or friendly girl but definitely did her job efficiently."}
{"text":"Management doesnt care. Servers don't care. Customer service non existent. Food bad. Never going back. How is this place still in business?"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few time, I love the Southern Stuffed Shrimp, the best! It has a little kick to it! For appetizers this time we got the Crispy Calamari which was delish as well as the Mozzarella Sticks. I enjoyed a Rita :) and the kids enjoyed their Beach Sliders and Simply Salmon as well as they enjoyed the Kids Sand Box!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch while we walked the market square to pass time on our family vacation. The waitress and manager was very attentive. The waitress didn't think the crab was cooked right so she ordered another another set without us asking. The boys grubbed up their kids crab pot. The manager came by and noticed our two boys and brought by two you sharks to entertain them (and that it did).  My dad and husband ordered Joe's classic pot, doubled. My husband is a huge seafood fan and he said It was perfect. As he gladly exclaimed 'I'm in a crab coma'!! Thank you Joe's for a great afternoon."}
{"text":"If I could give place ZERO stars I would. Went here for lunch and the place wasn't too crowded and seemed nice at first. We sat down and waited...and waited...and waited. 20 minutes later a waiter came by and took our drinks order. We waited...waited...waited. 45 min passed by and we asked to speak with a manager. They apologized and said they took our appetizer er...waited...waited...waited...see a common theme here? After we'd been there for 1.5 hours (not kidding) we just walked out. What a way to ruin a day of your vacation! This place is a P.O.S.! STAY THE HELL AWAY!!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here. Got the steamed snow crab pot with fries and hush puppies. The food was really good. Plenty of crab legs, and the fries were pretty good. The hush puppies had really good flavor. It just seemed like so much work to enjoy a meal. Everyone was so busy cracking crab legs that there was not much conversation.    They give you bibs to wear, which is good. However, I was not really pleased with the 'funny' sayings the waitress wrote on them. My father-in-law had one that was cute, it said 'Love me some crab'. My husband was given one that read 'My waitress gave me crabs', and mine said 'I came for a good time, and all I got were crabs'. Maybe if I had been in a party state of mind, or with a big group of friends I would have found this a bit funnier than I did.   The stars are for the food. The waitress was very nice, but a bit overwhelming at times. Her heavy perfume was kind of unexpected at a restaurant.   We sat in a booth, and for some reason my husband and I were really uncomfortable. Both of us had really stiff muscles part way through our meal. It was if the springs inside of the seats were all busted.  If I was to return, I would have to try something completely different. I saw someone get a plate of nachos. Not sure what was on them, but they looked good."}
{"text":"excellent service... they do not rush you to make a decision..erin was my waitress and she was amazing!!"}
{"text":"I'm gonna give this only 2 stars BC the service seems to always be slow. I keep saying to my self we will never go back but we have been coming here since my oldest was 4 and today she is 14.  The server was all over the place but she was good I guess.  Food was pretty good. A few new items on the menu."}
{"text":"The service I received was phenomenal, but there were flies on my food, and I found a hair in my drink, the place was not clean, and their prices are through the roof, I don't recommend this restaurant to anyone unless you're looking for good service."}
{"text":"Staff was super friendly. Our server, Cindi, writes her name on a napkin for us to remember and checked on us regularly.   The food came all at one time and was perfect! I would recommend this place to others while they are on this side of the island or make the trip here.  There is a bucket in the middle of the table for all the shells and trash to go which is pretty unique as well.   If you are going to come here, the hot pot buckets are definitely worth it!  Entertainment? Well they do this dance which is kinda like the electric slide. It was goofy, but fun."}
{"text":"Pretty good food, farily okay service. Very expensive buckets, jesus. I can understand -- we're hundreds of miles away from an ocean -- but still! Incredibly overpriced. The bib this was a pretty good idea, since there's no nice way to really eat crab. As someone with arachnophobia, the crab legs gave me the heeby jeebies. That aside, the service was meh, the food was meh, and the price was crazy."}
{"text":"I love Joes! It is always such a fun time at this place particularly if you love good fish bowl sized drinks and crab legs! I love the crab cake chipotle Cesar! This is a meal in itself! Great place to share an appetizer and a bucket of crab legs! I guess the service is hit or miss here since our waiter completely checked out! He didn't take our drink order didn't bring out butter for crab forgot to bring out second drink etc!"}
{"text":"I stopped into Joe's last week and was ecstatic to see an all-you-can-eat special for $29.99.  It started off great (large snow crab legs and three bundles in the bucket).  After that, it was a complete disaster.  The procedure after the initial table delivery was to tell my server when I was ready for more.  I waited approx 20 minutes (with nothing to eat) until the next delivery.  When I got it, it was one bundle of skinny/small legs!  I went through this about 2 or 3 times thinking the legs would get more meaty.  They never did.  Additionally, the time commitment began to get ridiculous.  The manager was less than concerned about my issue and told me that to do anything else would be \"against policy\".  He did eventually remove the meal from my bill.    This was very disappointing to me as I have been a Joe's customer for a long time.  I am used to eating their delicious snow crab legs, but was unaware they would sacrifice quality for their promotion."}
{"text":"My mother loves sea food, and Joe's seemed like the place to be for her birthday. It's our first time and the food was delicious! The wait time for food to arrive was reasonable. It is a friendly environment and well decorated- according the the style of food: sharks, lobsters, and clever quotes about sea food (\"Bite Me\"). I will be back!"}
{"text":"Worst food ever eaten in Vegas, only stopped because we were late and kids hungry.There were many unattended children in a dirty play area screaming as well. Service extremly slow, calemari, chewey and tasteless."}
{"text":"Not the best experience we have had at Joe's. The food quality has declined. Our server was far from friendly. He was obviously anxious to turn the table, offering dessert in the middle of our meal and trying to clear our plates while we were still eating, and only offering drink refill once my drink was completely empty for part of the meal."}
{"text":"Eat at Joe's! That's what they say...if you're looking for a fun seafood restaurant, this is the place.  It's pretty much your typical chain restaurant but I would definitely choose Joe's over Red Lobster.  Most of the meals are decent and you'll pretty much get what you'd expect.  This location is great after a day of shopping at Arizona Mills Mall or a day at the aquarium."}
{"text":"What can I say, we love Joe's.  We moved from Colorado recently where we went all the time and now we go to this location about once a month.    Nothing fancy, just get one of their buckets and enjoy some fresh crab legs.  Decent prices and good service and I am good to go!"}
{"text":"If you're easily annoyed by hearing restaurant staff sing Happy Birthday every few minutes I would recommend a different place.   It's actually been a little while since our visit to Joe's Crab Shack. I'm not at all going to regret saying we will never go there again. In a town where restaurants are everywhere they have to be on their A game to make it.  My wife and I with a couple good friends make it a point to eat out once a month. Just to catch up and have good food. Unfortunately Joe's Crab Shack was my choice so it may be a while until they accept a suggestion from me :-). Since I'm writing this so long after our visit it won't be artistic in any way, just a list from what I remember.  1) Constant \"Happy Birthday\" singing from the staff. This is VEGAS PEOPLE! Joe's Crab Shack? Really?  2) Several times a service person attempted to take my wife's dessert away without asking her if she was finished.  3) Saw manager standing near the fire exit for several minutes texting.  4) When we were finally ready to go, we had to practically hit our server in the head with the receipt book to get his attention. Walked by our table a dozen times without acknowledging us.  Never again Joe's Crab Shack. Sorry. If you can't appreciate your customer's why should they appreciate you."}
{"text":"I tried to give it zero....  The funny thing is, we tried three times to go here but the wait was too long so we went elsewhere. Claim Jumper is right next door. I suggest you jump over to there and save yourself. I wish I had.  Finally got two seats at the bar on the fourth try. Because I don't eat seafood, I was spared what was to come (spoiler alert). SO I get $11 chicken fingers, so dry and bad I just drank my beer. Which was fine.   My copilot ordered the KJ (Kendall Jackson) Steampot. Looked pretty neato with all its netting in there. Had mussels and some crab legs. Well, the seafood wasn't really that steaming and the corn was funny-tasting. My copilot ate the small amount of food ($25+) and we were on our way to a much-desired movie right after. But that was not to be...  Because lurking in the \"not hot enough Steampot was some badddd germ that attacked during the movie and my copilot spent the final hour of the movie worshipping the porcelain god at the Arizona Mills movie theater. And that is not fun. For anyone. After several stops by the side of the road on the way home, we were kind enough to call Joe's and alert them of the possible threat to all of you, the FUTURE DINERS of Joe's.   The response? \"I can't help you. Let me take your number and the general manager will call you tomorrow\". Well, after the level of illness, she retired for the evening. Next day, no call. Third day, we called them and were referred to the main offices in Houston. She spoke to them and was asked \"did you eat an unopened mussel? That can make you sick.\" I won't go on any further, but not only were they unapologetic, but they finally offered her a small gift certificate to THE SAME RESTAURANT. Seriously..  So I called the health department and needless to say, this was not the first call.  So, my advice is: if you go to Joe's, buy a cool tee shirt and watch them dance to Cotton Eyed Joe. They are the only safe activities there. Seafood in the desert is risky anyhow. Go to CA or ME for that. Have some ribs instead...."}
{"text":"Happy hour Joe's patron Rita $5!! Kids eat free on Mondays with an entree. Plus they get to play outside"}
{"text":"One star just for the hospitality, 157$ for four pounds !!! Of shrimp and crew shiit.. Lack of flavor!! Not compared with Angry crab"}
{"text":"We came in on a very busy Saturday night and had great service and good food at the bar."}
{"text":"I feel a little bit weird about giving a sub-par rating.  I'm not much of a seafood fan, so my opinions might not be too strongly formed.  Though, it seems plenty of other folks have given this place less than stellar reviews.  I ordered a \"New Orleans Pot\" or something like that.  The menu described it as shrimp and sausage with some spicy cajun seasoning.  Turns out it had crawfish too, but maybe I just didn't notice.  The sausage was just one link and a bit bland.  In fact, the shrimp was bland too.  The waitress \"warned me\" it would be spicy, but after removing the shrimp shell the shrimp tasted like regular ordinary shrimp.  The shrimp was a bit mushy too, is it supposed to be like that (like I said, I'm not a seafood expert)?  The pot meal came with corn on the cob.  I asked the waitress to substitute with a side of steamed broccoli.  She said that wouldn't be a problem.  I suppose she forgot (it happens, not *that* big of a deal).  Problem is, she seemed to have quite a few memory problems as she also forgot to bring out my friend's side salad.  Also, the food was really slow to come out.  The restaurant was practically empty.  It felt like it took forever."}
{"text":"This place should be renamed \"Chucky Cheese for Grownups\". The wait staff is more interested in dancing the Macarena than bringing food to their customers. Our waiter, Dusty, arrived while I was waiting for the rest of our party and practically insisted I order a drink. When we all sat down, he returned and hung around after taking our drink orders, intent on engaging in further inane conversation. The drinks arrived in \"twos\", that is, two were dropped off while the other two were delivered 10 minutes later. My food order came after the other parties at the table were served. There was much confusion among several waiters before my food was finally delivered. The order was wrong but by that time l was too exhausted to complain. The loud music returned as a birthday was being celebrated at another table. Much singing by the wait staff was performed while on hobby horses galloping from table to table. We ordered dessert but were forced to wait while our waiter performed in a conga line. No one was getting food or attention during these \"performances\" . During this miserable evening I remained polite since we were with guests but had I been alone I would have left and never returned. By the way, if you must eat at Joe's, don't forget to bring a wad of cash. Be prepared to pay mightily for substandard seafood, the loud obnoxious atmosphere and horrible service."}
{"text":"Sunday 6:30 PM. It was PACKED in there. Bit loud, but fun atmosphere. We were in no hurry so I don't really remember how long it took to get our drinks... I was too busy reading the drink menu, I actually told our waitress to take care of other tables and come back.   Southern sweet tea, rockin' poppin' something something, and gone fishin' as drinks. I don't like the fact that they don't list price on any of their drinks (I guess that's trend for every corporate restaurants...) They were all around $8.50 per drink. Drinks were pretty and yummy. But expensive for casual restaurant.   Calamari, Balls of fire, and stuffed mushrooms as a starter. Calamari was way too soft. I guess all you Americans like soft Calamari... my Asian taste buds ask for more chewy texture... Other \"balls\" were tasty.  Pots. We ordered the Orleans, Ragin' Cajun, and Diablo. Looked so much better on picture than the actual meal. I thought it was too salty. Crawfish was gross... Crabs were pretty good. Corn and potatoes tasted the best.   Overall, really expensive. Bill was $165 between 4 people. Food, meh. Service, pretty good. 3 stars."}
{"text":"I thinking giving 1 star is generous.  I don't know why I went back here.  Thought maybe the years since we have been that maybe it improved..nope.  It was promising at first because the server came quick...but it went downhill quickly.  Then she never came back to refill drinks, I asked for ketchup for my daughters dinner that never came either.  Food took forever, the manager came by and seemed concerned and then didn't care of our complaint.  My lobster tasted old and over cooked so not worth the money.  I asked for dessert for my daughters and waited 15 minutes and still never came.  When we asked about it she just seemed so flippant about it.  Boy was she quick to bring the check and swipe that card though.  I hadn't been there in at least 8 years and I will never go back to see if they improved.  Don't waste your time, patience and money on these losers."}
{"text":"I ordered the Loaded Fries! I also tried te Mahi Tacos , let me tell you the Loaded Fries are Phenomenal!!!! So if you happen to show up and are undecided , then try the loaded fries! You will not regret it!! The place is neat giving the fact that it's a busy place the place is well maintained. The staff is friendly and they are good at what they do. A huge plus of eating here is the great view o the river and the city ."}
{"text":"Blacked out here during A friend's birthday meal, broke up With boyfriend and puked."}
{"text":"Marg was good, sandwich was okay, service was alright but  OMG the kitchen is  S.  L.  O.  W... Really now, more than 45  minites to wait.  Shame.  After looking at our watches and determining the time my husband arrived and when the order actually had been taken it was closer to an hour. One last thing that sticks out is the patio umbrella situation.  Four tables, at least three umbrella stands, but only two umbrellas.  I had asked if we could get an umbrella for our table since we had been there more than an hour before our food arrived and it was noticeably HOT.  Being in uncomfortable conditions doesn't make for happy campers.  And waiting an unreasonable amount of time for the food doesn't help.  Would have spoke highly of server had she jumped on bringing an umbrella over from a recently cleared table but that didn't happen, no, we got up and got that cement base holder and rolled it over and pulled the umbrella and got that set up. And did ANY of the staff offer to lend a hand?! Hmpf.  Yeah, right.  Fix your patio too cuz it sounds like a few of those boards are gonna break.  They're definitely a hazard to walk on even if they don't break."}
{"text":"On tuesday afternoon I attend the networking lunch at this location and over the last 4 weeks the service and staff has gotten much better about getting our orders out in a timely manner. I really enjoy the staff and they're very friendly and efficient. Foods pretty good. It has a very laid back atmosphere I would recommend it if you have time to hang out and have some pretty good food. If you're in a hurry though I would choose a different location or restaurant they still take a little time to get things out."}
{"text":"I come more than my check ins reflect. The food & service is always great. I usually get one of the steam pots, which is always a can't beat. I usually don't order an appetizer, but tonight we had the crab dip. Definitely a new favorite. Our server, Gabriel was on the money. As The Terminator would say, \" I'll be back\"."}
{"text":"Fantastic experience. We went mid day and the manager checked on us a few times. My father in law and I got the standard crab legs boil. My wife and mother in law has the fish and chips.   My kids got the crab legs and loved using the tool to crack them open. Some of the legs were a little soft in the shell so to make sure the kids had a good experience they made them a second bunch of legs. What a great thing to do, and we didn't even ask.   I would definitely visit again. Tomorrow we plan to hit another one close to the hotel and I'm hoping the experience is the same.   Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"We decided to hit another Joe's Crab Shack, this time in Robinson township.  Started with a tall Sam Adams and ordered the special which is a basic boil for 16.99. 1/2 lb of dungenous crab, corn and potatoes.  Added an entire lobster for 15 bucks.   Browsing the menu I noticed the Mason jar Bloody Mary.   I love places that add a twist to the Bloody Mary. This one has a crab leg in it and looks wonderful.   I didn't get one, but I will next time.   Anyhow, the meal was great. Joelle was attentive.   Another win for Joe's Crab Shack!"}
{"text":"Food was disappointing and service was even worse. Tried a margarita that the manager recommended and it was awful, tried the spiced iced tea which had no alcohol. Server (Marcie) was negligent and never asked for refills on drinks, didn't bring a knife for the steak order or a bib for my daughter's pot order. Medium rare burger was well done and medium steak was well done. Won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"I've always gone to angry crab so my BF, roommate and I decided to go to this place and check it out on Memorial Day. Did not disappoint me! Wasn't too busy (I'm sure cause of the holiday) and it was a perfect setting especially for the loud and busy weekend I've had. Ordered the queen crab legs basket with Cajun seasoning and garlic and herb butter on the side. So full and so good! Will be revisiting again whenever I get a craving for sea food again."}
{"text":"This place have really gone down the drain. The water tastes like they got it fresh out of the toilet bowl.The seafood gumbo taste like burnt garbage with a side of cleaning solution. The crab cakes, which I used to love, were crunchy like it had crab shell in it and tasted like it had toilet bowl cleaner in it. They tried to stiff us by overcharging us for items we sent back to the kitchen. We will not be visiting this place again. They have totally lost our business! Our daughter walked out of the restaurant with the urge to vomit. Now I am on vomit watch for the evening. Very disappointing!!! And one more thing I waitress and I won't say her name even though she wrote it on the paper towel, didn't I refill out of drinks even though the water that tastes like toilet water, didn't offer to give the children refills either, she forgot to give the kids straws, and she didn't do a very good job of responding to the errors of their ways with their nasty food. The manager really didn't have much to offer as far as the nasty food went, other than, \"Oh, I'll give you your money back and I'm sorry you're having a bad experience. Every once in a while, you know, you get that person that gets that really bad experience and I'm sorry it's happening to you.\" Terrible... GROSS experience!"}
{"text":"Wow I loved this place and I been here when it's has been busy but it's not best today they were quick to sit us at a table but we sat there for 25 mins before we said screw this and then when we got up and that's when someone finally acknowledges us. And all they can do is ask us if we want another server. Never going there again."}
{"text":"We had never been to a Joe's Crab shack before, and thought we would finally give it a try. I wanted a good fish and chips and my husband, who does not eat fish, saw a few other items on the menu he would try. Just like Olive Garden, or Red Lobster, is is a sad choice for any type of food. Our very expensive bill - for a 'shack' was over 70.00 for two people. I had the $12.99 fish and chips, with a ton of salty chips and the batter on the fish was so heavy it was inedible. It also had a weird sweet taste that was almost like pancake batter. My husband ordered the pasta and chicken for $16.99. I get it, it's not an Italian restaurant. But for boxed penne pasta and well done frozen chicken, a meal fit for Burger King. The salt level in this plate of dog food was enough to clean the roads of Mt. Charleston after a good snow. The over priced margarita in a mason jar - $9.00 - should have had me on my a$$ after 2 - I got nothing. We added a couple apps, don't waste your time. All in all- yeah, we won't be showing up there ever again and for that price we could have hit Gordon Ramsey's down on the strip and saved us a 20. Even better- head to Farmer Boys for a quick Fish and chips deal."}
{"text":"We have been regular customers here for several years and have always gotten the steampot for 2.  The last time we were here we noticed that the food content had been cut in half...but the price has remained the same.  We won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I just left maybe 5 munutes ago. We were there to celebrate my birthday. There were 11 of us, 3 of which were kids, so I made a reservation to make sure our larger party was not a surprise to them. We were sat in a timely manner. Skip ahead to when the food arrived. All of the food arrived except mine, my dads, and my grandmas, we waited almost 10 min before the waitress came out to tell us our three meals had been taken to the wrong table and they were making new ones for us. Again we waited,25 minutes later our food arrived, by this time everyone but the three of us were done eating. Mine came out cold after all of that. The manager was the one that brought them out so she was aware of the situation. The waitress did not make another appearance until we were then done eating. She didnt even offer for us to order dessert, which the kids meals came with and dropped off the checks. Not one penny was removed for everything that had gone wrong. I asked to speak with the manager and told her everything that had happened and she appoligized. She said since we had already paid the bill ($250 plus tip) she could give me 2 coupons for free appetizers our our next visit. I declined because i do not see us visiting again. The only redeeming factor was they had a play place for the kids. Poor service, bad managment."}
{"text":"Certainly not on the same level as other Joe's.  Whole establishment was marginally clean and there was a shortage of flatware, napkins and dishes.  They do not clean their shrimp, they do however over fry their fish and bring the wrong drink order.  Twice.  The crab and corn were inedible.  Terrible atmosphere, crowded and loud, couldn't even have a conversation... a balloon clown late on a Saturday night?!"}
{"text":"Ugh, tried eating here again for my birthday and because it wasn't busy. What a stupid mistake and a huge waste of time and money! Save yourself and stay far far away. The food was maybe edible? The fried shrimp had some sort of spice on it that the person I was with had one shrimp and could not eat the rest. Even the coconut shrimp had a spice on it, which I have never had before.  The coconut pieces in the batter were so hard you could have used them as nails. The service here has sucked every time we've visited. Today was no exception. The waiter never checked on us even though my glass was empty when he dropped off our lunch he was too busy to fill it, with tea.  Well good reminder of why not to visit any other Joe's Crab Shack. They care less about the customer and more about punching the clock."}
{"text":"This was our first time at a Joe's Crab Shack. It was very busy, and we were told it would be a 45 minute wait for a table. Thankfully several of the parties on the list were a no show when their names were called, so we only waited about 15 minutes. There was a long wait for our food, but the manager took a hefty amount off of our bill to make up for it. The food was delicious, and I would prefer it to Red Lobster. I got the the Bairdi crab bucket, my husband got Joe's classic steamer, and my daughter got the Double Shrimp. I would definitely recommend Joe's Crab Shack to someone who is craving seafood!"}
{"text":"The food was good, but the portions were not worth the cost. The entertainment was fun and the overall service was great. The only thing that would ever bring me back despite the cost would be their New Englad Clam Chowder...AMAZING!"}
{"text":"We will never go back to this Joe's even though we have been to other locations many times. The place was so noisy we couldn't hear each other talk. We went that day for the advertised oysters and though signs were all over, they were out of them at 6 pm. They have an outdoor play place which means kids are running all over like chuckee cheese, and it was so crowded people had trouble walking between tables. The food was not up to Joe's standards either."}
{"text":"My first time here. I won't be returning. Absolutely horrible service. Arrived at 5:30. Seated quickly, server didn't come by for about 15 minutes. Got our drink order in, turned out wrong. It is now 7:54pm and we still haven't gotten the right bill. Crab was over cooked. The meat was so over cooked there barely was any. Didn't get any extras we asked for. Pretty sure we were forgotten about by our server. As she only came by 3 times total. Once for drinks, taking the order, and dropping off the food. I'm giving it 1 star only because I have to and because the hostess was friendly."}
{"text":"We had lunch here around 2pm on a Tuesday. The wait was no existent. And we were promptly seated. Our waitress was super nice and kept checking on us. We were seated by the windows facing the AZ Mills. The view was nice except a lot of flies kept bothering us. Our order started with the crab nachos. I have had bad experiences with this dish at other locations, and for some unknown reason - I thought this time would be better. The crab topping was cold and way too salty. I suspect the tipping comes premade- so the franchise should conduct some further testing on this product. My wife ordered the fish and chips and I had the endless soup and salad. Both dishes were great. The fish was hot and crispy and my salads were fresh and crisp. I would eat here again - minus the window table and crab nachos."}
{"text":"Food and service is good, manager Adam came out and greeted customers, thanked is for having lunch."}
{"text":"When I first moved to Vegas I had constant crab cravings so this was my go to spot. Crab cravings can get expensive, but Joe's allowed me to satisfy my craving at a reasonable price.  One of the best things about this location is that I've never had to wait for a table. Even when nearby restaurants have a wait I've been able to get in easily. I'm always warmly greeted and the service has always been consistently attentive and friendly. On my most recent visit the service was great. I believe our server was Paul.  I love the crab buckets at Joe's. It's simple with crab, potatoes, and corn. I like that they have several seasoning options as well. The crab is always easy to crack. This is why I come here for crab over Red Lobster. The prices are great for crab. My husband has ordered a variety of meals and always enjoys them. The drinks are tasty too."}
{"text":"I have eaten at plenty of Joe's in my day. This one is a bit run down, but the service we received was great! I ordered the Cajun steam pot with old bay, and the hubs got fish and shrimp fried with fries and hush puppies. My food was sooooooo good! It was crab,shrimp, sausage, corn and potatoes and I devoured it all by myself :) The fish that the hubs ordered was really thin and dry, but he liked the shrimp. I'm not sure where one should really go to get seafood in a landlocked State, but if you are in Tempe and need a steam pot of goodness, come here."}
{"text":"I went to Joe's the other night with my family. We had a terrible experience. The restaurant was not crowded, but the service was horrendous. We waited for 50 minutes for our food to arrive. I have kids and they grew very restless, waiting for their food. I had to flag down our server inorder for her to check on our table at all. The food, once it arrived, was just mediocre. The kids' meals looked as if they had been frozen and microwaved to heat. I will ever go back to this location, it was a big disappointment."}
{"text":"consistently the best seafood in town. great atmosphere & service. limited menu-very few choices outside of seafood. king crab is great. the bbq style is not real good though. dungeness is alot of work and snow just doesn't have enough meat. go with the alaskan king crab w/butter. awesome!!! a little pricy compared to other options in town but worth the $$$. steaks are cooked perfectly & seasoned well. veggies are always hot & crispy. the corn & potatos in the steampot are fabulous"}
{"text":"The most fun & happier restaurant in Las Vegas! It's my boyfriend & I first time here, but we already felt the happiness ambiance & comfortable in this restaurant. The food was amazing also, we ordered Garlicky Mussels for appetizer and it was sooo delicious.. The main course about to serve now  the waitress & chef's all dancing and entertain all customer with the fun music every 30 min or so.. Kids were all dancing around with the waitress, cool place! Overall, we will def come back"}
{"text":"Overrated.  while the food was decent, and the service generally good, the ear of corn was dry, no butter or sour cream brought out for the potato.  the lobster was hard, and the booths tables were too high ( I don't like to have lean up to eat my food). these might seem small things, but for 25 to 30 dollars a meal and 9 dollar drinks that had half of it being ice, I expect it to be first rate.  First time we ate there.  One and done for us."}
{"text":"We went there last night after the line at the new Fudd Rucker's was out into the parking lot.  LOL!  As usual, the food was fabulous, our server Matthew was a card and on top of everything.  All in all, a great dining experience!"}
{"text":"Mike he is an amazing server!! He know how to talk and hold a conversation with his tables.  Also on top of all his tables."}
{"text":"Amber was a great server The food was tasty and the three dollar Margarita happy hours were awesome.   Oh ya. SHES HOT TOO"}
{"text":"I love seafood & although I do live in the desert this Joe's Crab Shack is on point. Eating seafood can be risky in Las Vegas due to thew travel time it takes to get the product here but I've never had an issue with getting non quality food. I've come here multiple time for dates & have had family dinners here. I don't live close to this location but the drive is well worth it & I won't mind making it again"}
{"text":"I wish I could say something about this place stood out to me, but it was pretty basic. The menu was shorter than I would've liked, and our waitress just seemed to disappear for nearly the entire meal. I ordered shrimp pasta which I will say was amazing. The presentation was awesome as well. My boys seemed happy, but my hubby felt it was rediculous in price for what we ordered. I thought it was cool they had an outdoor playground for the kids shaped like a ship, but let down again with the fact they had no sunshade for it. We're in Arizona . How can anyone play out there without burning themselves in the equipment? Don't think we'll be back. Food was great, but for that far of a drive and the prices I'd expect better service."}
{"text":"Got seated quickly and waiter was lots of fun! We had the Great Balls of fire appetizer which were spicy hot and yummy.  The Queen crab legs with garlic took a while  to come out, but again very very very yummy.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Food tastes good. Portions today were sparse. Ordered Dungeness and got one Cluster and another end of a cluster with no legs attatched to it? Great Balls of Fire appetizer was fantastic. Service @ the bar was awesome. They now have signs up everywhere saying no tipping and tips not accepted. Then on the reciept it says any money left on the table will be given to charity. I then found out it's not charity, it goes to a foundation. I'm sure those beautiful waitresses will move on with this no tip policy and the service will be crap with hi turnover employees. It's truly a shame. So for a $60 dinner tonight i got small portions, left hungry and told i couldn't tip my favorite waitress.. I will definately go less often."}
{"text":"The first new restaurant of the New Year, and it can only get better.  I used to pass a Joe's all the time on my way to I-95 in central New Jersey.  It never beckoned to me then, and that didn't change when I saw the one on Rainbow here in Vegas.  But when we were invited to dinner here, I figured, why not give it a try?  So I'll tell you why not.  First, a disclaimer:  I did not have the crab.  It could very well be that what has kept them in business lo these many years is that they offer fabulous crab.  And that's why I've given them two stars, just in case that's the case.  It wouldn't be fair to ding them on their eponymous coup de table (I made up that French term, but it may really exist) without trying it.  I like crab cakes, if they're not mostly breadcrumbs, but that's where my love affair with the crustacean ends.  Besides, it's not polite to order the most expensive items on the menu when someone else is footing the bill.  Unless that someone else is a billionaire.   Second, the ambiance:  None.  Nada.  Zilch.  Old, with peeling paint.  You get the drift.  I would be supremely embarrassed to invite anyone to dinner here.  So I ordered chicken, of the herb and lemon variety.  I also broke my own \"no fried, no salt\" New Year's Resolution that I didn't make and got deep fried pickles as one of the sides.  But a twinge of conscience had me go with steamed broccoli as the other side.  My husband, the copycat and chicken-all-day-every-day guy, also ordered the same chicken, except with sweet potato fries, well-done, please, and corn on the cob.  The chicken:  Yes, Virginia, there was some chicken with the salt.  So. Much. Salt. Nothing but salt.  Herb, who is never sensitive to that condiment, was gagging, but ate it anyway.  I gave up after half of it.    The sweet potato fries:  Decent taste, but soggy.  The broccoli:  What broccoli?  The waitress returned to tell me that they had no broccoli, but were putting up a corn for me.  What if I didn't want corn?  I decided to go for it, and the unadulterated, UNSALTED, corn was just as corn on a cob should be.  What else can you say about plain corn except that it was cooked?  The service:  No real complaints, except that we did wait a long time at the beginning.    I never like to say \"never,\" but I can state unequivocally this time that, to paraphrase the immortal words of the second Mrs. de Winter in Hitchcock's Rebecca, \"I shall never return to Joe's Crab Shack.\""}
{"text":"I ordered a chicken sandwich to go.  I wanted seafood, like a crab or shrimp salad, but I had a hell of a time trying to find a moderate portion of nonfried food.  I asked for advice on a non fried seafood portion that wasn't huge, but the hostess couldn't think of anything.  The sandwich was mediocre, and the fries were soggy and limp.  I wanted a salad rather than fries, but the hostess wasn't able to figure out how to order that instead, and rather than wait I just went with fries.  If you go here, go hungry, know the portions are huge, and skip the chicken sandwich."}
{"text":"I have been craving crab for the longest time! I was disappointed with my choice though. What I chose was a sampler that had crab dip, calamari, and shrimp poppers. I couldn't really taste the seafood because of the cheese and most of items being deep fried hid the taste. It just tasted like salt to me. I should have paid more and got the bucket of crab! They also had salad with Coconut Shrimp in it. I thought I would have enjoyed that more but alas it was too late so we moved on to dessert.  We had an apple crisp type of dessert with drizzled caramel topped with ice cream. That was delicious!  I should have just stayed true to what I really wanted instead of being concerned about getting messy!"}
{"text":"This place is so great. The Food is fantastic, the service is Wonderful, this is my favorite place to go for CRAB CRAB CRAB. I recomend the King with boiled garlic seasoning. Also the seasonal crab is always a good call, try the Snow fire grilled for a treat ;-D"}
{"text":"If you want to order shrimps, make sure you get it spicy!!! One of the best shrimp restaurants.   I order fish and shrimps but I didn't like the fish. I don't recommend fish.  I give 3 stars out of five for the price."}
{"text":"Had dinner here Wednesday June 18th. I had the East Coast Platter, my guest had the Maine Platter and her daughter had a Crab bucket. Everything was quite good, the server was very attentive and we did not have a long wait. This despite having a large group she was also handling. We also had the crab nachos as an appetizer. They were recommended by hostess. It was a good recommendation so give them a shot. The Manager stopped by and said hello which I thought was nice. There were a couple of happy birthday songs during our stay but we did not find them a bother. The menu has changed but for the better. Also plan to spend a bit more but a good ROI.. Next time I need a seat closer to the TV need to see the scores. JS"}
{"text":"The service was great but the food was a little cold and nit as flavorful as I am used to; but my son enjoyed it and had a great time"}
{"text":"Been here twice, both times were disappointing. Food was bad, service even worse. Wont be going back."}
{"text":"We have visited Joes a few times now. It seems like our experience gets worse the more we visit.  The first time the staff was dancing, food was great, and the service was fast.  The last time we were missing parts of our order even after waiting more than 30 minutes for food to be brought out. Crab was overcooked too. When we sent the crab back, it was brought out with a different seasoning than requested.  And finally, our bill was wrong.  Poor experience."}
{"text":"Experience:  Met some of my girls here for a \"paint night\". It was 7pm on a Wednesday.   Facility: Decent place for a franchise. We sat literally in the back room, since the group of all the painters was so big.   Service: The waitress assigned to the back room seemed pretty overwhelmed. We had to waive her down and asked for a drink and the menu. She came back a Ott 10minutes later with a menu in hand, but gave it to another lady. Huh?!?! Couldn't she bring mine at the same time?? Luckily, the lady was sitting in front of me, and shared gets with us. About 20min later, I finally got my beer and my menu. The only thing the waitress did right was when they messed up my friend's drink, she gave it to her for free.   Food:  wow, was I disappointed. I ordered the coconut shrimp 2/5, since this was easy finger food to eat while painting. The portion was big, and the fries were good, but that's all I have to say that was positive. The shrimp was very dry and overcooked. The cole slaw obviously was pre-portioned and sat for a while uncovered, because it had a film on it. I didn't even try it. I really was disappointed and only ate 2 shrimp.   Overall:  I might come back again to a Joe's, but I won't order the shrimp, and probably won't come to this one. I guess I would eat one of the pots with steamed seafood eat time."}
{"text":"Happy hour on Tuesdays is the business! On a light note, Joe actually works there. Ha ha ha the bartender's name is Joe and he gets teased all day every day about that. The Two dollar menu with appetizers and drinks is the business! The crab dip is definitely the best ($5). $2 fried pickles and calamari are a close second, as for the voodoo chicken, I can't vouch for the voodoo portion of it but for two dollars, I'll take it. The fried shrimp n fries was nothing to write home about. If you're planning to order a sandwich from the menu, you should definitely pass on the crabby patty because it's pretty dry and unflavorful or at least not what I was expecting. We can leave that to SpongeBob. But the two dollar hurricane... #TurnUpTuesday"}
{"text":"One of the best Clam Chowders in Phoenix. Everything is good here. Especially if you like shell fish. We usually get the Calamari or another App., Some Chowder and then we enjoy a nice big piece of Key Lime Pie for desert. Is hard to beat."}
{"text":"The servers are all really polite and friendly. The food is always very good! This blonde girl I forget her name was super nice."}
{"text":"I rarely get to eat seafood so I was excited for an opportunity. Unfortunately, I failed to remember that they deep fry everything here. I shared a mixed plate that had stuffed shrimp, fish, clam strips, cole slaw and fries. Nothing was very good and it certainly wasn't cheap. I ended up with left overs and didn't bother to take it home. The atmosphere is fun and our server was friendly. There were some good $2 happy hour eat deals but they are discontinuing them so they aren't on the menu."}
{"text":"We really like this place! It's very tasty! The only thing we did not like is we went once during dinner and once during lunch. We got the same exact thing both times, and the portion shrunk drastically during dinner. Not sure if that was common or not but it was kind of disappointing. Other than that the food is amazing!"}
{"text":"Good red fish and liked the glass of white wine I had with it. Sat at the bar so not too much to report."}
{"text":"Went to Joe's Crab Shack specifically to see the close up Magician working there, Jason Powers, and he was incredible and very entertaining. In addition to the Magic, my girlfriend and I were treated like royalty from the time we got there til the time we left. Our waiter Matthew was very attentive and even helped us with the menu. If anyone has been to Joe's then u know the food is top notch! A very enjoyable and entertaining evening!"}
{"text":"Used to be one of my fave spots to enjoy, after yesterday, we won't be back.  The host quickly went over the \"NEW\" menu with us, and recommended the Salmon Orleans.  So i  ordered it, asking for the salmon to be cooked medium, quickly told \"NO, it's against kitchen policy\". So, now disappointed, i just order only a bowl of Clam Chowder for my meal.  The bowl has decreased by at least 1/2 in the size that it used to be (this was supposed to be my MEAL, i didn't order a cup), and the potatoes were raw and crunchy.  As i'm picking them out of my bowl, the manager came up to us (fairly late into our meal) and apologized about not being able to prepare the salmon as ordered.  Then she goes to explain that they can't cook it less than well done because it's FROZEN and packaged.  Really? Isn't this a seafood restaurant?  I then told her that the potatoes are raw.  The manager then offered to cook me \"another bag of clam chowder\".  I just looked up in disgust, now.  The clam chowder, which had always been one of the yummiest dishes there, is PREPACKAGED?   If i wanted frozen fish and prepacked chowder, i could have saved money and gotten similar quality at Long John Silvers.   My husband got the Grilled Malibu Shrimp.  Average to say the least, surrounded with dry, mushy, over cooked (was frozen) broccoli.  The best thing that we were served was the Applesauce cup that my son got as a side for his Popcorn shrimp. The service wasn't too great either.  It was about noon when we got there, and a total of 4 small tables.  So, there isn't much of an argument as to why we had empty tea glasses most of the time we were there. The manager did end up taking care of our meal, but knowing what i do now, we just will not ever be back.  Good going corporate Joe's."}
{"text":"I will absolutely never be back. The service, or lack there of, absolutely sucked here. We sat at our table for two hours total, 45 of those waiting on drinks, dinner, or even acknowledgments from any of the floor staff.   We had ordered a beverage from the bar which took 15 minutes alone, followed by a refill of sprite which also took approximately 15 minutes to get to the table.   Our food was over cooked and over seasoned. We were checked on once. The Crab was super rubbery, which, I understand we live in Arizona, but come on!! It's in the name!!   The floor manager roamed the floor for about 5 minutes before returning to the kitchen, not even giving us a chance to speak with her.   We were drastically over charged, but that is partially our own fault for not checking our bill before handing the server our credit card.    Finally, my fiancé spent the evening and next day in our hotel room ill."}
{"text":"celebrated my mother's 50th birthday here on their AYCE snow crab wednesday! we went early afternoon around 1pm and it was surprisingly not that busy. we were greeted & sat very promptly. the server (forgot his name :( ) was super friendly and accommodating.   there were 6 adults total, including 3 very hungry men. we all did the AYCE and were able to try all the flavors. our favorite was the old bay classic seasoning. the crab did take a while to come out because we killed our orders so fast. they limit the ordering to 1/2 lb at a time after the first lb. the server realized that it wasn't working because we'd finish so fast so he'd put in another round as soon as he dropped off the current.   the manager, ROBERT, was extremely attentive to our needs as well. i believe we were a handful (extra butter, lemons, refills, more crab!!) but the server & robert were superstars and really made my mom's birthday seamlessly special. thank you so much!! we'll be back for more."}
{"text":"I've been to Joe's before, but not this location. I was never impressed with Joe's. But stopped here last night and was very impressed. Waitress was fabulous, efficient and friendly. Food was good,  perfectly cooked and I loved the Cajun spices. I was pleasantly surprised!"}
{"text":"Great Food very reasonable price for the the huge portions service is awesome. As you can tell my favorite restaurant I Also enjoy the margaritas !!"}
{"text":"You know you are in for trouble when your nose is immediately hit with a whiff of overpowering fishiness when you first set foot into a restaurant.  Nevertheless, we still decided to eat here, and like many have said before, for the price you pay, the quality is lackluster.  Service was equally as lackluster, despite us being only 1 of 2 tables having dinner that night.  I'd probably steer clear of this restaurant, at least for this location."}
{"text":"Compared to the Crab Shack on Southern and McClintock, this is the far superior location.  The food, service, and cleanliness of this place is better, despite them being both part of the same seafood restaurant chain.  The seafood itself varies, as the queen crab was pretty tasty and sweet, but the lobster in my Arctic Bay steamer was pretty bland.  The shrimp that came with it were good since they were the ones that soaked up a lot of the Old Bay seasoning.  I also tried some of the crawfish platter, which was a delicious mix of crawfish etouffee and fried crawfish on top of white rice."}
{"text":"We had really great service by Juan. Food was delicious of course. My crab cakes could have had a better consistency and no shell. My wife's fish was wonderful. Sauces were tasty. Atmosphere was happy with at least 3 birthday celebrations."}
{"text":"The first 4-5x I ate here, the food and service were really good. The last two times, including my last time ever, the steam pots have been over cooked and the service staff appears to be Perkins castoffs.   Our service was really good tonight, but the food wasn't. The corn looked like it had AIDS and tasted like I think AIDS would taste. The crab was overcooked and I had to scrape it out of the shell to eat it. My wife's hush puppies were really dry and tasteless as well. The fries had roughly 3 pounds of salt, so I could get heart disease to compliment my the aforementioned Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome. Lastly, some server who apparently forgot she wasn't at home in her mobile mansion kept yelling to her co-workers every time she walked by our table. Nothing says ambiance like white trash and giant sharks.   I'm done with this location and will take my crab needs to the Joes in Station Square."}
{"text":"Good food and drinks.  All you can eat crab legs on Wednesday.  Oh Lawd I'm about to be Crab Leg wasted!!! I like their coconut shrimp but today it was hard and over cooked. I like the hush puppies."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Friday night around 8pm after doing some shopping at the near by Arizona Mills mall. The wait time was about 25 minutes so that gave us time to look over the menu prior to being seated. We placed our order with the server who was very friendly however our food was brought out by another employee and it was cold as if it had been sitting out for a while before being ran to us. When it came time for the bill she was no where to be found. At this time the dinner rush had slowed down quite a bit however we still waited 20 minutes for her to bring the bill even after asking several other employees if they could track her down for us. When she finally showed up we paid in cash right away. Literally another 15 minutes went by before she brought back the change to the table and when she did it was $5 short lol..  In all the food was ok but the service was horrible."}
{"text":"Well the spicy boil is gone:(. The crabs were served cold. Luckily the waitress and manager checked on us before we could find out, then reappeared after we ate. The shrimp was warm and delicious. I used to love this place but the last two times I've been tremendously disappointed. One of the crab buckets was comp'd so that was one star back. Inge more try, then it's dead to me."}
{"text":"Why did I rate Joe's Crab Shack 3 stars when I rated In-N-Out Burger 4 stars in my last review? Interesting since Joe's Crab Shack is a casual dining restaurant that I get to visit once in awhile as a treat whereas In-N-Out Burger is a fast food establishment that I would normally dine in. The answer is employee enthusiasm. When I spend $6 in In-N-Out, the employees greet me with enthusiasm. However, when I spent $23 in Joe's Crab Shack you could kind of say the waitress was like a crab. The waitress wasn't nasty or bad at her job. She gave me the impression that she didn't want to be there. When I write reviews, I push on customer service and cheerful employees. Attitude could make or break my ratings.    The fact that I was disappointed in the waitress's friendliness shouldn't have been. When I originally set foot in a Joe's Crab Shack in Orlando, Florida the restaurant was overflowing with a good times vibe. All the employees were friendly and at the top of the hour they'd dance. Enjoying an upbeat atmosphere over tasty seafood was my kind of scene. Joe's Crab Shack had a name for good times and seafood. It was a name that would draw me into a Joe's Crab Shack on vacation. When I moved to Las Vegas, the Henderson location lived up to the name. But in life things happened and Joe's Crab Shack disappeared from my life. On Sunday, when my brother and I were hanging out in Barnes & Noble, I was like, \"Joe's Crab Shack is a block away on Rainbow. Let's try it.\"    When we stepped foot in the restaurant,  which also sells gifts by the way; it was sparsely populated for a Sunday late afternoon. The hostess was friendly. If the waitress had had the hostess' s attitude this review would of taken a different tone.    I ordered the Big Shrimp combo. The dish featured coconut shrimp, fried shrimp, and stuffed crab shrimp with fries and cole slaw. Over the years the menu must of changed. It wouldn't be surprising since the personality of Joe's Crab Shack had. Kind of like the waitress' s attitude, the Big Shrimp combo leaves me unenthusiastic. Why? Two of the three types of shrimp were breaded. Breaded shrimp reminds me of Mrs. Paul's. And I could just walk into aisle 2 of Walmart to pick it up. Now the stuffed crab shrimp was delicious. The thing is it was tiny in proportion to the breaded shrimps and fries. In my honest opinion, Joe's Crab Shack would have been smart to follow Red Lobster's example of giving a choice of shrimps and less breaded shrimp. For the record, the fries and cole slaw was delicious. When all is said and done, the Big Shrimp Combo with a Coke and tip wasn't worth $23.      Dining out is precious. I work hard for my money and deserve to eat in a restaurant where the waitress wants to be. In reality, it will be at least 6 months until I patronize this location. Red Lobster, Bubba Gump, and lets face it In-N-Out Burger are better choices."}
{"text":"Kind of expensive and you have to work to get your crab out. The don't have the shell crackers, only a zip tool."}
{"text":"Outdoor dining available. Prices ok. Fish tacos at least have non fried fish but are dry. Needed more salsa or some wet concoction.   Every menu item includes calorie count. Be prepared to be shocked and not pleasantly so. Who knew 2 tacos with chips and a little cup of queso could be between 1300 and 1500 calories or a shrimp sampler of 3 types of breaded shrimp, hushpuppies, and slaw could have 2800?  Ow.  Service slow."}
{"text":"Just found out that the Joe's Crab in the southern location and this one have different ingredients. Not sure about other flavors, but definitely the spicy boil is much better in this location. 5 stars for anything in spicy boil, but other flavors are a 4 star for me."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times over past year...I can't say enough about my dining yesterday 8.1.17 -- my server was Sabrina, a very delightful young lady who was patient, had great sense of humor and was just a pleasantly fun server. She was extremely cognisant that I was there very early for my dinner meeting and never took the fact I was early for granted. My iced tea was constantly refilled, asked if I need anything and although she took the order 45 minutes early it was promptly delivered between 610-615 as I requested. That made me notice how awesome she was. ASK for Sabrina anytime you go there... she'll will make your dinner amazing....had the food been bad she would have made it palatable...$60 bill...$20 tip...that's rare for me!!!"}
{"text":"food was alright I had the coconut shrimp they were a little on the over cooked side. I just felt after we ordered there was a long wait granted we didnt order a appetizer but usally restraunt give you rolls bead of some sort.. oh well probably wont go back nothing really wowed me."}
{"text":"It's been almost a year later and we finally visited again.  What we ordered was a little different but it was close.  The shrimp was absolutely delicious.  However, the fish'n chips tasted very, very fishy.  I'm not sure if it was the fish, the batter or the oil it was cooked in.  Either way, I didn't like the fish'n chips.   Not sure I'd order it again.  Thus, I took the star down by two because the shrimp was good despite the fish and the server definitely wasn't nearly as efficient as the one we had last time.  My water glass emptied without a refill.  Thank goodness my husband's hadn't."}
{"text":"I am VERY unhappy with my experience tonight. I came in around 6;30 PM and was seated around 7. We had a group of 11 people. Everything was well and we ordered. Our food did not come out promptly...AT ALL. and one of our people didnt get their food until everyone was done. I asked for a refill on my drink twice and watched my waitress tend to the same table four times (I counted) in  about 20 minutes while I waited for a refill. My boyfriend asked for butter for his lobster and did not recieve it, even after asking twice, until he was already done with his meal. We split a steampot with lobster and crab legs and shrimp. We got a lobster that hardly had anything. It looked like the middle fell out and it was plated anyway. Our crab legs must have been from baby crabs. And we had about three shrimps at the bottom of our plate. When the waitress came back, it was all excuses, blaming other people in the restaurant for the bad service. When we were trying to leave, it deemed impossible for the waitress to figure out how to split our check into two. And as I was leaving, the waitress tried to laugh off basically neglecting our table. I would understand if it was packed and she just couldnt get a break to get to us, but I watched her go to a table at least four times after I asked for something, and then just forget about what I asked for. VERY unhappy."}
{"text":"Came in around 12 on a Friday & the place was dead. We asked if we could sit outside because the weather was actually nice!   Was given the lunch menu & had to ask for the full one, just to see what else we could order. I was going to settle for the crab cakes from the full menu but my coworkers insisted that the crab nachos were to DIE for. I mean who could argue with that? So I opted for the crab nachos. I looked at the pics on Yelp & it just didn't look very good.  It smelled soooo good when it came to our table though. I guess I expected A LOT out of it cos my coworkers just hyped it up so much. Lol but it was just okay. Nothing amazing. I did like their fries? Lol   The service also wasn't great. She didn't really come by & ask if we needed anything. That was my first time & I just don't think it's anything to go out of your way for. Maybe if I do come back, I'll actually try their crabs. Hopefully those are better."}
{"text":"I've stayed away from this place because of the reviews, but its right down the street and my Mother wanted to go.  It was Easter Sunday, 1 PM,  so, it wasn't crowded at all.  2 of us had the Jumbo Bairdi Crab Boil and it was absolutely fantastic...meaty and sweet.  Mom had the Jumbo Fried Shrimp plate and took half of it home...just great.   Perhaps, it was because it wasn't that crowded that everything was fresh and service friendly and timely.  I would not hesitate to go back! I didn't rate it as a 5 because \"As good as it gets\" only comes fresh out of the ocean...this was as close as you're going to get in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I went here with friends who were in town visiting. We are all New Englanders so we are very picky about our seafood.   The waitress was nice -- friendly and attentive. She got everything right and didn't miss a beat with drinks. She got our food out quick and with no mistakes.   My two friends each had burger (wtf? ;) ) and I had a seafood sampler -- fried shrimp, scallops and fish.   They both said the burgers were great but we found it weird that they didn't come with cheese. But one of my friends said it was so good that he didn't even notice til he was almost done.   My other friend really like the spicy sauce that came with her burger. Fries were kind of plain.  My food was only ok. It was nice and hot and the batter had great seasoning but the scallops were small and the fish was very dry. I will say that the shrimp was decent in size and tasted fairly fresh.   Overall it was an ok experience. Nothing extra special. I just found it weird that at a seafood restaurant the burgers were the best thing we ordered."}
{"text":"The food was not worth the price. It was slow and I still waited five minutes to get a refill on tea. Had to go ask for the check. Will never go back to any Joe's Crab Shack"}
{"text":"We wanted to go here last night. Since it was a Friday night we called ahead to see how long the wait was. Well, actually we TRIED to call ahead. Multiple time. They kept picking up the phone and just hanging up. We drove out there (while my fiancée was calling again to see how long the wait was) and they still kept hanging up on us. When we got there and told the manager what was happening his response was \"Well we're busy.\" No apology whatsoever. Guess you're too busy for these customers because we will never be returning."}
{"text":"I love this place! Staff is nice, place is neat, and food is great!! I love their great balls of fire app. But their bucket of snow crab legs with the garlic herb seasoning is to die for!!"}
{"text":"It had been awhile since we had been to Joe's so we were excited to go back. But we were greatly disappointed. I ordered a Crab pot with King crab. It was a lot of crab but it was over cooked and rubbery. The portions of cole slaw and macaroni salad were good but small. I had a lot of potatoes. I left most of them. My meal was supposed to have andouille sausage. It did, but it was two tiny bite size pieces.  My husband ordered the Sam Adams pot. It came with lobster that was tough and had a very funky/weird taste.  Our server was excellent but the food was far from it."}
{"text":"Went here for a late lunch with family on Saturday afternoon this place was not busy, but service was slow. We have to ask the manager if our food is ready, her  reply was, 'let me check, i dont think it's ready' . We're about to stand up and just left, but waitress brought one of dishes out, then all other food that we ordered was brought out too."}
{"text":"Jacque was great and very attentive.  We sat outside with a cool breeze on us.  Our meals were very delicious and filling. Convenient off the freeway. The entire wait staff seemed like they enjoyed being there. We'll be back again for sure."}
{"text":"Awesome service by Erin. Had fried shrimp and it was great. Best tartar I've ever had. Onion straws were yummy. The hush puppies were too dry.  Cole slaw was good. Son had shrimp too and he loved it.  Hubby wasn't overly impressed with the Cajun pot though. Overall a fun experience."}
{"text":"I love this place but wow. Service couldn't be more disorganized. I was told two hr wait for table. Took 50 min. Then I get table and nearly 40 min later no food still. Manager looks lost. It's freezing on here. Turn the ac off please. Bar tried to charge me for things I didn't order. Tables are sitting empty and unclean with people waiting in line to sit. ?  No direction. A rudderless ship.   Hope the food makes the last 90 min of sitting and waiting worth it   Hmmmmmmmm wait wait wait."}
{"text":"My husband loves sea food.. We never go out to eat at a sea food places because I love steaks! I'm here to tell you the steak was super awesome and we will be going there again for sure! My husband is so excited!!!"}
{"text":"Okay, my bartender was Meagan and she was wonderful!!! She was pleasant when I walked in and pleasant when I left. She was very informative with the menu and suggested certain utems on the menu that was popular. i loved that. My long island ice tea was to die for! It was nice and strong and made exactly how I like it. I ordered the sampler with chips and cheese and lobster dip, jalepenos stuffer lobster balls, and calamari and everything was delicious and fresh!! I couldn't stop eating. The flavor was excellent and had just the right amount of heat....just like I like it. I will for sure visit this Joes again."}
{"text":"Sam, our waitress was amazing. Will come back and request her every time. She was knowledgeable, very friendly, and gave us the best experience. Thank you Sam!!!! Lake Mead and Rainbow location"}
{"text":"I had a wonderful meal here, but that's beside the point-Chris our server, is God's gift to Joe's Crab Shack. Combining a fun dining experience with personality, poise, and humor, I am sure to come back. He went above and beyond his line of duty as a server to ensure we had a stellar experience. Cannot wait to come back to see what Chris suggests for my next meal!"}
{"text":"Here from Anaheim CA,  where I have one by my house within  a mile away.  Never go there because  of how busy it gets because  of Disney.   I arrived at 8pm and got seated immediately.  They server was extremely  nice  considering  it was his first day.  O asked about the Pico rice  that they had and he couldn't  explain.  It's OK its his first  day.   I ordered GRILLED MALIBU  SHRIMP."}
{"text":"I was pretty disappointed on this visit. The food was great but the service sucked. We had to wait a while and the server did not really interact with us. I ordered an appetizer that never arrived and the server acted like he did not even know I ordered it. Maybe he should write down what his customers ordered instead of relying on his memory. It seemed like he was there to just do his eight hours and then get out of there. After we finished our meal he took the plates but the rest of the table was still a bit messy. We ordered dessert but we had to clean the table ourselves just to make sure it was clear.I don't expect an immaculate table but at least make an attempt to make sure the table will be ready for when my dessert arrives.  I might go back but if service is like this again I will not ever return."}
{"text":"Went to dinner 4 of us had the worst service never got refils, never got ketchup when our food was brought and we asked for it! I got snow crab it was so over cooked it was discusting. When the manager came over akeem was totally unprofessional if he managed my restuaraunt he be fired. How to treat your customers so rudley. He asked us if we knew where our waitress was? Why would we know and he was so rude!"}
{"text":"Went here not too long ago, and to tell you the truth....way too expensive for what you get.  The quality wasn't that great either...but again, we're in the middle of the desert and i can't imagine it being super fresh.  Had the crab legs...it was whatevers, but our server was super nice...and cute ;)"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Joes but not this location and here's why.  When our appetizer arrived I was excited just to eat. But I soon found the calamari was chewy and the crab dip was very bland and seemed to have an overwhelming mayo taste.  For my main dish I ordered a steam pot that was short of steamy. The food was room temp and the scallops in my pot were chewy (They also had little burnt bits of whatever pan they were prepared in.) My family member ordered the steak and asked for medium rare, there wasn't a streak of pink in his steak. He did enjoy his French fries though crunchy on the outside and warm and soft on the inside.  Though I appreciate the laid back atmosphere of Joes, the crew here seemed to take it to a new level. Many choosing to stand in groups talking to one another. Also the appearance of multiple staff members looked as if they just rolled out of bed. (Bed hair and all) And they had no energy at all! The little ones in my family were very disappointed that there wasn't dancing like the Macarena as seen in other locations. I work in customer service and energy is a big thing. If you show you excited to be at work then you customers will be excited with you. I really hope it was just a bum Friday night.   Usually my family and I come here on special occasions but I think we are going to look for other options now."}
{"text":"It was such a great place. The service was absolutely amazing, the food came out quick and it was a beautiful setting. Our server Tony was really really great and he always made sure we had what we needed and he was very outgoing with an awesome personality!"}
{"text":"This place constantly delivers on food, service and a fun family friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"We always love getting their classic steampot and surf and turf burger. We don't eat pork so instead of the sausage they allowed us to have some extra shrimp.  Their desserts are also awesome. At one point they had a seasonal pineapple upside down cake that was absolutely addicting with the sauce they served it with.  Great service and great food!"}
{"text":"Meh. That's all I can really say about my experience here. I stopped in with a friend for lunch after doing some damage at the mall. I started off with a Passion Fruit iced tea which was probably the best part of my entire meal. Between the two of us, we ordered the Sampler Platter, lobster bisque soup, the Crab Cake Burger and the Surf N' Turf Burger. The bisque tasted like it came straight from a can, the seafood, crab and cheese balls was the only thing I liked from the sampler and both burgers were pretty meh. The saving grace of this visit was the service, which was pretty good minus the trainee who didn't seem to want to make eye contact or speak to us. Oh well, she was learning!  I had heard great things about this chain and was pretty excited to try it, though it was kind of a let down to be honest. If I ever return to a Joe's Crab Shack, I will probably order what they're known for, which is the steam pots or their fried platters. Maybe I'll have better luck then."}
{"text":"Very average food, sub par service. I've been to this location twice, in late October and early December, and the service has ranged from moderate, to absolutely terrible. The food has stayed in the center, being good, but nothing special. I've had this place described to me as 'Very touristy' and I think it fits that mold quite well. I don't know how to write what constitutes a touristy restaurant, but if you've ever been to a Joe's Crab Shack, I think you know what I mean. Anyway, the food is good enough, if slightly over priced. The service leaves something to be desired, as most customers do not want to wait for ten minuets at the host/hostess station only to be rudely 'greeted', as if they were doing you a huge favor. It's possible we caught them on bad nights, and I would hate to write a review based on exceptions to a standard, but I highly doubt I will return to a Joe's Crab Shack anytime soon."}
{"text":"Love the service and playground! Our family's top pick for \"family date night\" Have to try the cheesy chicken- crunchy and oh so flavorful!!"}
{"text":"Wednesday nights all you can eat crab for thirty bucks. Nothing more really need to be said. I will continue though to say the staff is always friendly and fun. A few times a night there will be dancing to the music or wishing someone a happy birthday. This will definitely be my Wednesday night destination at least a few times a month. Also happy hour from 4 to 7 with $5 apps and $3 beers."}
{"text":"Didn't wait long to be seated! Very quick and friendly service. Matt was an awesome server! He did a great job helping up celebrate our sons birthday. He was on top of things!! And the food was delicious!"}
{"text":"To say our experience there was less than desirable would be a great understatement! After ordering our app. we were told that they let it sit in the window too long and they had to heat it back up, meaning they threw it in the microwave. While waiting for our app. our \"steam pot for 2\" arrived. When we received the pot we asked if that was really the two person portion to which we were emphatically told it was. Then our server came and took it back bringing us our app. We asked the server if that size was right because we had seen many pots go by us that were much larger and she told us that it was the right size. Once done with the app. she brought out the same small pot as before but this time it was nice and cold. About five minutes later she came back to inform us that what she brought was indeed the steam pot for one and that she would bring another. Upon getting the bill we see that she charged us for both single pots instead of the cheaper pot for 2.   Needless to say we are very disappointed. There is no way that we would go back to this establishment given the poor service along with the sub par food. If you are looking for a good place for seafood in Pittsburgh try somewhere else because this is not the place to go."}
{"text":"My party of three arrived here at 8:15pm on a Sunday night and was surprised to see that the restaurant was pretty empty. I drive past the restaurant on my way home every night and it always was busy and full.   We were greeted immediately by the host who was extremely animated and welcoming. He sat us at a booth and our waitress Zuri came over to introduce her. Zuri was amazing! Probably the best waitress I've had in a very long time. She was extremely nice, attentive, efficient and had a great personality. She deserves 5 stars for her service.  I was not impressed with the food. The menu makes the dishes look really good and impressive! However when the food comes out, it's another story. We ordered the bucket of Cajun shrimp which was overly salty! The shrimp were not of good quality and the shell was hard to peel off. (They were too steamed and the shells were extremely thin and stuck to the shrimp) The Ragin Cajun Steam Pot was decent. The crab were of good size, the shrimp were better of the ones in the bucket of shrimp and the seasoning was tasty. Although the steam pot was ok, I don't think I would come back here for the food.   The ambiance was good. It was a fun place to sit with friends and catch up over drinks. A good place for families and kids (there is a play ground for kids). However, if you're in the mood for good Cajun style food... I'd recommend Hot and Juicy or Boiling Crab!"}
{"text":"Crab in the micraddle of the desert?!!!   i know - right?  Still, the crab pots are great.  They show up at our table and there is a hush for about a half hour as we crack, crack, crack away.  Dungeness crabs are the best, being as I'm from the SF bay area I may be a bit prejudice, but try them all and just try to disagree with me, go ahead, do it.  Fried calamari was good.    Atmosphere is loud and fun.  I enjoy sitting at a table with a bucket right in the middle of the table for shell disposal.  Sat at a picnic bench their once and will NOT do that again, bum was sore afterwards.  Friendly servers."}
{"text":"Why is it so hard to get good service?! I am extremely disappointed with the service I received from this place. I have been to this particular location several times and come here instead of the one on Southern because of the atmosphere overall but today was another story.  We made a reservation for our party of 6 and when we arrived we got seated right away, this was a plus. We got our drinks and appetizers ordered and everything seemed to be going well. Our waitress brought out appetizer plates and as they were being passed around the table we noticed there was still quite a bit of food on the plates. You know when you heat something up and cheese gets stuck to the plate and won't come off unless you scrub it, yes that kind of stuck. This leads me to believe that they don't scrub the plates that they use, gross. We showed the waitress and she said she would get us new plates when the appetizers came out. About 5 minutes later our appetizers came out but our waitress was no were to be found with the plates. We finally asked someone else for plates and they brought us great big dinner plates. Overall appetizers were excellent. We ordered the crab stuffed mushrooms and the seasoned bucket of shrimp, beware seasoned shrimp is super spicy.   It took another 10-15 minutes for our food. I had the Redfish and lobster which was really good. It has a little bit of kick to it on the spice but the sauce they use it prepare over the fish is phenomenal. Another person in my party ordered BBQ snow crab and the bucket they gave him only had 1 claw instead of the normal 2-3 that the usually give. Surprisingly the manager noticed this when they brought the food and asked us if it had come out like that. When we told him yes, he said he would send more food out and we could continue to eat what we had already been given. Some random brought the missing food out which I personally thought should have been a manger. He never came back out to check to see if the order was corrected or to make sure everything was right. Another person in my party also ordered the BBQ snow crab but when he got his food it wasn't BBQ flavor it was something different. When I told the waitress she went back and checked the ticket and figured out that she entered it incorrectly. She apologized and asked if there was something else we wanted. At this point i just wanted to leave. A manager never came over and this was the 3rd mistake they made for our table. It was almost time to leave and we got a drink refill it was supposed to be a Diet Coke and she brought a regular Coke. Mistake #4 and still no manager.    Food was good but service was horrible. Unfortunately, your good food does not take precedence over good service. I can go somewhere else and get both. I work too hard for my money and I'm not going to give it to someone who isn't going to work hard to get me to come back."}
{"text":"It was good as always. I'm in a hurry to get to a show but I really wanted to post this picture of Jen. Lol"}
{"text":"This place was pretty good for our first time. We had a cajun bucket for 2. Didnt have a fishy taste like i hate and food was good. For someone who isnt really a fish eater, i enjoyed this place!   3 stars? Waiter was GREAT.  Hostesses? TERRIBLE. The girls were snotty and stuck up while not even greeting us or bothering to notice we had even entered. When i told them table for 2 please, the 2 girls just looked at me with a disgusted look on their face and said they were busy counting menus that it would be a 40 minute wait. 40 minutes?! There was hardly anyone in there for a sunday at 8:00pm! When they finally sat us the girl didnt even bother to hand us our menu instead threw them on the table and left without saying a word. Uh ohk?   Im a little torn on coming back. Food was great, service was not the best. Food isnt worth the price if you cant even get decent service."}
{"text":"The servers have 0 personality and the Malibu shrimp were really bad. Over priced ..."}
{"text":"I always get the Crab Daddy Feast. It used to be my favorite, but the portions have gone way down and the prices have gone up. In the Crab Daddy feast, I used to get 1.5 pounds of crab (1/2 pound of 3 different kinds of crab), but now it's probably less than half of that.  My birthday is tomorrow and this will be the first year I won't be having my birthday dinner with my family at Joe's.  Probably just gonna go to Red Lobster. At least I know what I'm gonna get. Boo!!"}
{"text":"Heard so much about this chain and was curious and decided to give it a try. Walked in to about 15 people standing in the entry all waiting to be seated. About half of the tables were empty, so we wondered what the deal was. We stood waiting for several minutes at the unattended hostess stand and finally decided to head down to Burgatory.... Peace out Joes Crab Shack!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and the best customer service you could ask for.  Thank you Sara Jean for being such an amazing server and making our experience so great."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is amazing, staff is friendly, and food is delicious! Well at least the crabs, potatoes, shrimp, and corn on the cob are really good. Their since of humor puts a smile on my face. Plus they do entertaining dances! What more could you want?  Ps: Sabrina is an amazing server! I'm not just saying that- she checks in frequently enough to make sure we are all good, but doesn't over do it."}
{"text":"All in all, it was just ok. One step above meh.  We came here to celebrate a recent life victory. I expected much better service considering we were only one of three parties in the entire restaurant. Service, however, was glacial. They were perfectly nice and cordial, just very very slow.  I ordered one of their special drinks and it took nearly 15 minutes to get it. Then we started waiting for dinner. I had to move my drink away from me because I was actually getting sick drinking it on an empty stomach. The food itself was okay...just ok. My husband's steak was overdone but he seemed to really enjoy his meal and didn't complain. I got the lobster and it was rather good. But, everything else was so salty I could barely eat it. Plus, it was served lukewarm. We then waited a long time for the check.   Overall, I can see that would it have been busy, we would wait a long, long, long time. At least at Red Lobster we would have gotten cheesy biscuits while we waited. The prices were higher than at Red Lobster and the food not much better, the service about 1/4 as good. Sorry, Red Lobster is the closest comparison I could come up with for this one, and Joe's loses."}
{"text":"We were there on 9/30/17 for dinner. I had a spiked lemonade to drink and it was yummy. Our waiter was awesome and the food was good and came out fast."}
{"text":"The hostess took a while to set up our table.  Although we saw her clean the table when we sat down it was not done thoroughly and my spouse put her hand into what appeared to be drawn butter that had dripped onto the table and had somewhat solidified (at least I hope that's what it was).  We flagged down a person who quickly got a bus person to come and clean the table again.  The person used a hot steamy towel this time and made sure it was very clean.  I got the Joe's Classic steam pot with garlic and a cup of gumbo.  The gumbo was okay; I've had better at other local seafood restaurants.  The corn on the cob and potatoes were okay; somewhat bland.  Even though I had requested garlic, they still sprinkled Old Bay seasoning on the seafood.  The garlic flavor was very minimal.  So, I'm wondering if they gave me the Old Bay seasoning and not the garlic & herb I had ordered.  There were two different kinds of crab legs.  I could not tell you which legs were the dungeness vs. snow, so I'll explain it by size.  The larger legs were flavorful.  The smaller ones had very soft shells and very little meat inside the legs and were almost a waste of time.  The shrimp were okay; rather bland like the corn and potatoes.  The drawn butter and salt helped kick up the flavor with the bland items.  The service was pleasant but slow at times.  I'm not thrilled on the prices but I understand to have seafood in the desert, there is a lot of overhead cost to get it here.  I would like to see more happy hour food choices and possibly more daily specials.  Overall I enjoyed the experience and am willing to go back and try other menu items."}
{"text":"I have no idea why the reviews are so low. The food here is always great. I take the family and split the Sunset Fire Grilled steam pot for two and its exception. Best seasoning I've ever tasted and the crab legs are always big and fresh with great shrimp to top it off. The atmosphere is very fun and family friendly. Can get a lil pricey but that's how seafood usually goes. Love this place!!"}
{"text":"Steampots are always good. Apple crumble was delicious and not too sweet. If I'm going to splurge on a dining out night, it's not bad."}
{"text":"Horrible experience as I'm typing this.   We were with a group that was supposed to be seated at 7 pm. Got seated at 7:45pm.   Frustrating when you  go into the restaurant and there are tons of empty tables that you cant are till you seated .  Do they think you don't notice stuff like that?  8:15pm and still no waitress.   This food better be dang good      Which still won't make up for the inattentive waitress.  I swear we were invisible!   Maybe her tip should be too!"}
{"text":"Got the sampler with calamari and crab dip. It was amazing. Then i ordered the coconut shrimp that was amazing. The dipping sauce was really good. My mom ordered the fish and shrimp and really liked the fish. We tried the twice baked potato and we will never get that again. The service was good. The manager even stopped by to see how are meal went. The food was delicious."}
{"text":"Sure we have one by us back in the South Bay that we never go to, so we saw the commercial before leaving and I added it to the itinerary as a b onus it is not far from the resort we stayed at. I think we found a new seafood restaurant to add to our list. The prices are reasonable and the service is good. The place is not very clean though. We watched the servers as they cleared the tables around us, just drop the stuff they wiped off onto the floor. One table had a puddle under it and they tried to seat some people there but they asked for another table and they never cleaned it up and sat another couple. But enough of the negative (Just check the seats and under the table before accepting table). The food was great, I ordered the fisherman's platter so it had Popcorn shrimp, a generous fish filet, Great balls of fire (handmade seafood and crab with jalapenos mixed with cream cheese and coated with breadcrumbs fired up and served with Ranch dressing) and fried calamari (The calamari was a little overdone) but the overall meal was amazing and generous. I think we got our money's worth though we were too stuffed to order dessert. My wife ordered the Skillet Paella it sure looked great clams, mussels, shrimp, scallops and sausage with a tomato based sauce and served over rice. YUMMY! We'll definitely go back and try the ones closer to home."}
{"text":"I am now a true fan of Bairdi crab. Never heard of it before, usually it's King, Snow, Dungeness, and sometimes Queen, but now I know if it's being offered, Bairdi is the way to go. The meat is sweet, and reminds me of Snow crab, just bigger!  Our waitress was friendly, I want to say her name is Ashley, but honestly I could be mistaken. She topped our drinks off, and made suggestions when asked. Sweet kid.   No dancing on this visit, probably because there were only a couple of people in the restaurant at 3pm in the afternoon. The manager checked in on us, and was very attentive, but we had no problems with our service or our food."}
{"text":"Whenever I see their commercials it always makes me want to come here, but when I do, I'm always disappointed because the food doesn't meet my expectations.   The five stars is for our server and nothing else.   When we first walked in, there was two hostesses at the front, the restaurant wasn't busy. We told them we had a party of four and waited to be seated. They were waiting for a busser to clean our table, but instead of telling us what was going on, they gave each other a couple of glances and basically had their backs to us. No \"It'll just be a couple of minutes  while your booth is being cleaned\" or \"Thank you for waiting,\" nothing.   I'm so glad our waitress was the complete opposite. MEGHAN was spectacular. She was busy with another table, but when she walked by she gave us a courtesy, \"Sorry guys, I'll be right with you.\" She was super nice and very attentive, we got sauces and refills right away.   She would be the only reason for my return., just saying."}
{"text":"From the moment we walked in we were greeted with a smile and feeled very welcomed. Our server Monique was AWESOME!!! She was friendly and gave great recommendations. My daughter loved her and enjoyed her first visit to Joe's Crab Shack. Also, the food was delicious.  We will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"1st time at any Joe's Crab Shack & loved it!  We had a steam pot for 2. 1/2 was spicy style & the other 1/2 was fire-grilled style. The spicy style was good but the fire-grilled was outstanding!  Both included plenty of crab, corn on the cob, potatoes & sausage. Everything was very good & we finished with the Key Lime pie. It was excellent & more than enough for the 2 of us.   Great service topped off the experience & we'll definitely return!"}
{"text":"We've always liked Joe's Crab shack and the one at the Mills is really loud so we decided to try this one. Anyways, it's the normal looking Joe's with merchandise to buy. The music isn't blasting so it was better and better atmosphere to eat at. The servers dance as usual for all the customers every once in awhile.   To start off, we had the Classic Sampler which included fried calamari, Jalapeno balls, Tortilla chips with a Crab dip. The calamari was okay and the Jalapeño balls had a really nice kick to it and the crab dip was pretty good. Nothing great. Nothing to write home about. Also, my wife and son ordered the clam chowder. They always have to try everyone's chowder. This was probably the most disappointing chowder. I tried it and it didn't have a lot of taste plus it was luke warm. Not good.   For dinner, I had the Artic Bay Steampot. It had Lobster, Crab legs, Shrimp, Sausage, potatoes, and corn on the cob. It was okay. Not a lot of taste. At the middle of my meal, everything was cold. Not a real fan. Seafood was okay. The sausage seemed like it had a hard skin and wasn't very tasty. The best part of the meal was the corn in the cob.   My wife had the Spaghetti Lobster. It was served cold. So she didn't eat it. Wasn't at all impressed.   The manager came by to ask us about our food and we told him that the clam chowder and spaghetti lobster was cold when we got it. He apologize and took it off our bill. Plus he gave use a few coupons for free appetizers.   So as you can see, we didn't have a very pleasant experience today. Food was so so and cold. Not impressed at all. If we do ever come back, it probably won't be for a long time cause there's just too many place to try. Good Luck at this place."}
{"text":"Being as this was my first trip to Pittsburgh, I wanted to avoid chain restaurants... but considering the arctic temperatures outside, we ended up here after a 2 minute walk from our hotel. I've been to Joe's many times, but this was one was the best!  We made it just in time for the half off appetizers and $3 hurricanes and margaritas! We ordered 3 different appetizers, all were PHENOMENAL! The crab nachos were my favorite. SO SO GOOD.  Our waiter was so awesome, he unlocked the door to the patio, had us jump the fence and took a picture of us in front of the river in 5 degree weather. We just had a wonderful time! he even took the time to recommend some places for us to go in the area. Overall, a wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"I'm a regular here and always leave a happy customer. Mariette is an outstanding server and we always ask to sit with her. We always get the same thing, the 18\" peel & eel shrimp with a steaming bucket of crab and they both always come out perfectly. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The food was great as always, The service was excellent! We like the Henderson location more than the one in Summerlin. The staff in Henderson is much more friendly."}
{"text":"The service has always been good, so why not we are in the area. The worst experience I have ever had after spending a $157.00. The pots are smaller, the wait staff is taking away from duties to dance. It took asking 3 times for a glass of water. It was seafood so I give it 1 star but I will never again walk through the door. We had a to-go box left it on the table for not even 2 minutes and they had all ready thrown it away. Never again. In fact I came home and down loaded this app because I am that mad. We should have gone to Rudy's BBQ."}
{"text":"I have visited joes a couple of times during lunch time & its never overcrowded. A really good place to have good attentive service and some seafood during lunch. They seat well (away from other parties) its spacious and has booths in different ends of the room. The management both male and female (Courtney) really live up to what a manager should be like. Beth,  the waitress (with her pretty modest makeup) is by farthest the best waitress hands down!!!!! She is pleasant, doesn't take forever to check back and is a gem overall. She makes suggestions and aims to please. They are lucky to have her!  I have, honestly, never been in a establishment where I continue to get treated the very same way all the time I pay a visit. It could be because when I visit it ain't that busy but still I love the acknowledgement! I hope every guest gets treated that very same way. The food is good but they def play a role in us coming back.   Now the food,  ain't fail us yet!!! We have tried a range from the crab tapers to the great seafood rolls to the calamari, the mussels, all have been seasoned so good & it always taste so bomb! The cooks are soooo consistent there. An the music, OMG, they have like the bomb.com 90's mix station. You will hear Brian McKnight to TLC there to a nice Joplin beat.   Annnnnd to top it off, they even offer $2 bites (some come in a bed of fries) and every Thursday is 50% off drinks. I love this place."}
{"text":"I love this place I had crab for days it was juicy and perfect! Our server Nadia was super sweet !"}
{"text":"20min wait 4 beer ,cold appetizers, no frys no hush puppies. Tough lobster  nice talkative Waiter. Like Red Lobster  more bedder."}
{"text":"We sampled four appetizers, one bowl of soup and two entrees at Joe's Crab Shack. Our bill, excluding beverages, tax and tip, came to about $62. Not bad!  Pros -   Reasonable prices, Kid friendly Cons -      * Food is nothing to write home about * Not vegetarian friendly  * Gift shop on premises  Description      * There's a quite large playground in front of the restaurant, and a small arcade on the inside.     * Joe's Crab Shack has a gift shop in the front of the restaurant.     * The decor is comprised of wall-to-wall, ceiling-to-floor knick knacks, watchamacallits, and doodads.     * I hear that in the evenings the music and the servers add to the campy ambience. Not so at lunch.     * Pretty extensive kids menu.     * If you go to Joe's Crab Shack and you don't have a coupon, your AAA card will get you a discount."}
{"text":"There was a small 15 min wait for the 6 of us on New Years Eve at 5:30 pm (no big deal)  We get seated and get a fantastic and I do mean FANTASTIC server.  He was an older gentlemen who you could tell right off the bad that he loves his job.  He was informative, funny, friendly and was quite amusing when he suggested a few things on the menu to us.   We started off with 2 sampler appetizers which were great.  Some of us then had a cup of lobster bisque or clam chowder.  The soups were ok at best.  They were warm NOT hot, lumpy/thick (and it wasn't because of the filling in the soup).  I ordered the paella (however u spell it) and it had a good amount of seafood in it (mussels,clams,scallops,shrimp topped with crispy calamari) over tomato sauce rice. The rice really wasn't great and was too tomatoey but it was alright, definitely nothin to complain about though. The others said the same thing about their steam pots. It was all good but nothin great.  Dessert was the smores and a HUGE carrot cake. I tasted a little of both and it was good but not something I would typically enjoy. But the others seem to really like it a lot.   Would I come back again??? ehhhh... maybe for lunch or appetizers but not for dinner."}
{"text":"Had the rum shrimp; my best friend got the mahi plate and boyfriend got fish and chips. The fish was flaky and amazing; the shrimp was sweet and the rice has pineapple, beans and corn which somehow worked. Server was fast and nice; calamari appetizer also was crunchy and melted compared to rubbery chewy ones I've had at other places. Great overall!"}
{"text":"I'm with everyone else.  Joe's Crab Shack isn't anything to write home about.  The menu has the normal shrimp, crab and fish dishes on it, and pretty much everything is going to be deep fried and greasy.  The only things on the menu I like are the 'Great Balls of Fire.'  Don't laugh- they're really good.  They're cheese balls stuffed with jalapeno and crab or shrimp and then they're deep fried.  Delish.  Other than that, I wouldn't come back to the Shack unless it was on somebody else's dime.  I wouldn't pay for a meal there again."}
{"text":"You know...I have no idea why I eat crab legs in the first place.  The work necessary to attain the amount of usable sustenance, just makes me cry. But my wife actually enjoys using those miniature forks, and digging the crab meat out of those things.  For me, it's torture However, this place has good service, good food (once you salvage it), and is well-lighted (which is good considering you have to work with tools in order to eat.) The prices are reasonable, as well. My only complaint about this particular place, was the incredibly loud music. We were only one of four couples in there, and I could not hear my wife who was just sitting across the table from me (normally that's a good thing, but there was no TV for me to watch, as is the usual routine.) But here is where they lose the star: We asked them if they could possibly turn down the music a little (keep in mind that it was intensely loud), and they said that they could not. The waitress explained as to why not, but I could not hear her explanation due to the loud music. Maybe it's just me, but when I eat lunch in a restaurant, not being able to converse at the table, doesn't make a whole lot of sense."}
{"text":"Place was hopping for lunch. Food was good and hot but too pricey. That's expected, the last time I looked the ocean was not anywhere in site."}
{"text":"Save your time and money, unless  you are going for the appetizers and drinks. The appetizers we had were really good, but our main course was sub-par and nothing spectacular. How do you screw up fish and chips? They managed and served the most mediocre crab cake I have ever had. Unfortunately, this place is nothing special, mediocre at best."}
{"text":"The service was great and the food delicious and fairly priced. We went for lunch and sat outside on a gorgeous day. We weren't in a rush but after 20 minutes, we had out drinks but no one had come to take our order so I went inside to let them know. They were extremely apologetic, not rude or annoyed as some people tend to get. Our server for the rest of our time there was very attentive and friendly. They had the manager come say hello and make sure we were satisfied with everything, which we were. I ordered the Crabcake, which was the perfect size for lunch.   We had a lovely time and hadn't been upset once, even over the initial delay. However, they truly made up for that and even took $25 off our bill to apologize. I will definitely go back there. The food, service, and atmosphere made for an enjoyable time."}
{"text":"We went a few weeks ago, it wasn't our first time at Joe's but was the first time at THIS location. food was the same as before, GREAT! they have this AWESOME WHIPPED BACON BUTTER! WHAT?!?! WHIPPED BACON BUTTER- YES everything nummy in the world on a knife! DEL-ISH. But the best part of our visit was our server, JOSHUA! He was awesome, very attentive and friendly, and when it came time for them to dance he was hands down the best dancer on the floor, he hit every beat better then the girls did! We came for the food but fell in love with the service!  THANK YOU JOSH! YOU ROCK! if you go ask for Josh and tell him about this review."}
{"text":"My husband had the Bucket of Pacific Dungeness Crab while I have the Redfish N Lobster. Both dishes were good. Since I finished my plate quickly and my husband's took time to finish, I ordered the key lime pie. It's of a huge portion and I could only eat less than half of it. I didn't eat or drink anything afterward and about 2 hours later, my stomach started protesting and I had to take up residence in the restroom at home. It's after 2am in the morning and I still could not sleep because my tummy still felt a bit twisting and cramping after I took the peptobismal.  I cannot imagine what'll happen if I ate the whole slice of that key lime pie."}
{"text":"We were staying across the street and went over for lunch. Service was good, food was good, but very pricey! $32 for half a king crab is pretty steep.  Overall, good place to eat :-)"}
{"text":"Every trip to Vegas we stop by this Joe's Crab Shack  the food is good with the service to match plus the wait is never long. Their best waitress in my opinion is Andrea, her attention to detail and impeccable memory is impressive for example she remembered us our EXACT order and even the location we sat in the last time she served us over 3months apart.. if you're big on customer service Eat at this Joe's!"}
{"text":"I was there on June 6th and had the worst service ever. I got to the restaurant around 6:30 it wasn't busy I was seated and a waitress named Tamara came and said she was my waitress. She never returned to the table. I called another waitress over and asked if she could get Tammy. She asked what can I get you? I replied I want to order now that Wes's after I waited 20 minutes. So another waitress came to take my order- I ordered clam chowder ( which was luke warm) and garlic clams. Then the manager came to ask was it a bowl or a cup really? I said a cup then my order came and it was mussels again it was wrong and had to wait again. Must I say more....."}
{"text":"Simply wonderful evening out with the family. I'm a fan of the large fenced in play area and sitting on the deck when the weather cooperates. We ordered two of the Lobster Daddys and I ended up trading the hubby for his crab legs. He likes lobster, I love crab so we were both equally happy.  Mike was a great server refilling our drinks, getting our order out in a timely fashion and making suggestions. The crab legs were fantastic. I had them Chesapeake style and the hubby went for the garlic and herb so I had a little of both. Some how I managed to stab myself in the hand while opening crab legs and a nice server came by and brought an antiseptic wipe with a bandaid. I can still eat crab legs, even while wounded.   Joe's has a great Patio Punch on the menu. I did notice they a sign for 2 for $2 oysters on Tuesday night. I'll have to remember to come back on Tuesdays. Overall a great dining experience with something for everyone."}
{"text":"Joe's service is fast and friendly, entertaining atmosphere and lots of food for a decent price.  Wish they would give you more sides, the platter is full of fish though."}
{"text":"It was ok, just had the fish & chips though & hubby had salmon. Wait on a Sunday was about 20min then they asked if bar stools were ok, which it wasn't for our party of 5, so we waited an additional 40min. Wasn't worth the wait imo"}
{"text":"I lived in Maryland for 20 years and I love steamed crab legs. This place was very good and I am so glad that  I went despite some of  negative reviews. I have wanted to goto this place for years, but have not because I don't live very close to either of the locations and my husband does not like eating at chain restaurants.   Our waitress, Elyse, was very nice and gave us great recommendations for dinner selections. The Bloody Mary was delicious and they put a crab leg in the drink as garnish!  The service was relatively quick for seating and service. I did hear one of the waitresses say they weren't very crowded that particular evening. The serving amounts were ample. There was a crowded table next to us  and I noticed they stopped talking for a good 15 minutes when their food first arrived. That's usually a good sign of a good meal.   My entire family enjoyed this place and we will be going back."}
{"text":"The staff here are always nice and the pricing is very generous for the steamed crab and lobster.  The ambiance isn't our thing necessarily, but we've been here a lot regardless and sat at the bar.  All the bartenders are really nice!"}
{"text":"Bad experience. We were seated quickly, and for a Friday night, it was busy but not packed. At first our waitress was attentive, but once we place our order, we hardly saw her. It took an HOUR to get our food after ordering, and in the mean time, I was never offered a refill on my water, nor was anyone else at our table. Once the food started coming, they would bring two entrees (there were eight of us), and then it would take another five minutes or more and they'd come out with two more, and so on. All I ordered was fries, and I got my food about ten minutes after everyone else did. When everyone FINALLY had their food, we were short one side order, one person received the wrong side order, and my wife's salad was not made according to how she ordered it. When she was done eating, I was going to finish her salad, but after a few bites, I had to stop; it was just bad, absolutely no flavor at all. They knew our service was bad too, because without us saying a word, the manager came to our table and apologized for the slow service, at which point I also pointed out all the mistakes on our orders, and she took 10% off of our bill. I appreciate her attempt to fix the bad service we received, but I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I am so happy that we have a Joe's Crab Shack near. My daughter for Mother's Day (she was not able to be here), sent me two gift certificate for Joe's.   I always get the Dungeness Crab Boil, it's costly but they always have it and very good. I problem that I have with them is that their potato's are not cooked (very hard).    The Service is great!  I do not drink, so I do not know about the drinks."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and can you say awesome? Unpopular opinion is I like their crab legs more than Red Lobster but Joe does have Crab in the name. The people here are friendly. The location is beautiful enough that when it's warm eating outside on the patio is a must. Me and my friends used to regular this spot in celebration of their two dollar Tuesday specials. It's an all day happy hour that is totally worth it. I had the Queen Crab the last time I was here and it was all types of awesome. Also try their hurricane drink. Your taste buds will thank you."}
{"text":"Good food but bad service! People were running around like crazy, like they don't know what they're doing. There was a glass of water that spilled on the floor on a table in front of us, no one dared to clean it. Not very organized."}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed, took 10 minutes for a server to come to our table... The appetizer was \"ok\".. we got a queen crab bucket with garlic seasoning, didn't taste any garlic, the potatoes and corn were very bland and unseasoned. Bloody Mary was decent.. way too many other good places to go In Vegas, don't waste your time or $$$"}
{"text":"It was okay. Nothing special. We don't have these in my neck of the woods and that night I felt like wearing a ridiculous plastic bib and spending $40....  Sat at the bar where the service was so-so. Got the classic steampot which I enjoyed. More shrimp would've been nice."}
{"text":"I think I liked my experience at this location a shade more than I did at the one in Robinson, if for no other reason than I just got down and dirty, y'know?  Instead of trying to order civilized, traditional fare like crabcakes and fish filets, (what kind of flake orders chicken or steak at a seafood restaurant???) one has to indulge in a bucket or steampot  to truly capture the gist of JCS.   So I went with an Arctic Bay Steampot; a metal pail filled with queen crab legs, a split lobster, shrimp (complete with shells, legs...and eyes!), potatoes, a sausage, and a cob of corn all dusted with that arcane seasoning that makes anything taste exotic: Old Bay.   It's work I tell ya. You have to be careful. Spines from the armor of these critters will rend you, and when the seasoning gets inside those lacerations, your nerve endings scream. This time I was more savvy however, taking my time, imagining myself to not be in a chain restaurant but seaside with Bourdain on some trip, eating everything out of a bag on a bench.   It takes a stretch of time to get through everything. I had this innate need to save the best things for last, but I ignored it, going for the lobster midway through the meal. Yes, you're cracking and twisting and zipping, dismantling the poor, dead things like Magnus taking down robots sometime in 4000 AD. All you want is that meat--a nice, intact, large portion of that meat-- to drench in melted butter. Your fingers wiggle in anticipation of that perfect morsel.   It never seems like enough, though. You fill up on the boiled potatoes, corn, and dessert, but you still want more seafood. You slurp on the empty shells just to get one more taste of the ocean, obsessing over creatures that fishermen drown trying to catch for your enjoyment.   Kay did allow me to try one of her mussels and a couple of her scallops, which I rather prized after baptizing them in that clarified butter.  Speaking of dessert, The Crabby Apple Crumble hit the spot, the grainy cinnamon ice cream serving as the ideal cap for this snug, full-bodied, rectangular twist on an American classic.   So I guess I kinda like JCS. Like I said, get a bucket or steampot, don't cogitate over it, and make sure you can afford it. Our bill was $84.56!!! Yipes!! Thankfully Kay had a $25 American Express gift card to give me some breathing room.   P.S. This JCS is a little hard to find. It's behind the former Island Cafe (now called Steel City Slammers). We had a heckuva time trying to locate it, wandering up and down Station Square like Mr. and Mrs. Magoo. Luckily I had their number in my cell phone.   P.P.S. We had no issues with the service."}
{"text":"Eh, part of me thinks that if Joe's Crab Shack's prices weren't so out-of-line, I'd enjoy them more.  Kay wanted to come here so badly, it was killing her, a craving for crab legs driving her to the brink of madness. I had to take her. There was no choice.   She enjoyed the hell out of her meal, especially with me footing the bill, which came to $150 after the tip.   It's partly my fault. I caved and bought a steampot that contained two whole steamed lobsters, shrimp, sausage, and corn cobs. I can't recall what they call this combination exactly, but man did it make my wallet scream.   If a restaurant puts lobster on their menu, I have trouble passing it by.   What formidable critters of the deep lobsters are with their crimson, armored hides. Imagine if they were the size of men or...elephants.   Regardless, tearing at these monsters taught me to respect them anew, and savoring the briny, plump, tender meat morsels reminded me how tasty they can be when dredged in clarified butter.   The Crab Nachos were an easily enjoyable appetizer (crab dip on tortilla chips topped with pico de gallo, black bean corn relish, Jack cheese, and avocado lime dressing doesn't require pinching the nose to devour). as was my dessert: The decadence dance Joe calls the Campfire S'mores (How could one with a sweet tooth hate on a chocolate cake, marshmallows, graham crackers, and a Hershey bar stuck under a broiler together on a plate? Hell I could make it at home and should!).   Nonetheless, I must deduct stars for sticker shock, regret (for what I spent, it should have been the meal of my life), and somewhat absentee service."}
{"text":"Over-priced. Over-cooked. Over-staffed.     This was my first and last time visiting a Joe's Crab Shack.  The food itself was barely edible. I ordered a Sam Adams Steam Pot.  My lobster was over-cooked, and the clams included were about the size of a nickel. Laughable.    My fiance ordered the KJ Steampot. This was appealing being scallop lovers, and the scallops pictured on the menu looked quite large and terrific. However, those were not the scallops we received. The scallops we received were rubbery, and about the size of a quarter.   How they were pictured http://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/800x600q90/843/47cv.jpg   What we received http://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/800x600q90/855/q0n7.jpg    The entire time we were there, the wait staff was just awkwardly standing around. It was about 7pm. Dinner time, and we were only one of about 3 tables being serviced. Despite the place being over-staffed, it took the food forever to come out.     After this experience I will not be returning, and I would advise anyone else to stay away as well."}
{"text":"Love this place. Haven't been in over a year due to their crab nachos falling off in taste awhile back. Today was great. The crab nachos were awesome and their crab pots were even better. Service for drinks and appetizers were on point but when it came to bringing out my kids meals, they were slow to deliver. Our waiter kept our drinks on full and even made sure our service was up to par. Granted, their prices are a little pricey but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"I worked in the plaza where this Joe's Crab Shack is located for a year and a half, and never visited there once. The \"Free Crab Tomorrow\" sign brought a smile to my face too whenever I'd see it, but the word of mouth from people I worked with was that the food was mediocre. And they were right.   Today was my friend's birthday and she was looking for some seafood in the area since we were taking a lunch break. Pete's Fish and Chips was thrown around as an option, but she decided on Joe's Crab Shack. Seeing how it's her day for a super happy birthday extravaganza of fun, I conceded. And all I have to report on the experience is coupled with a shrug and an, \"Eh.\"  If you like the corporate atmosphere of TGI Fridays or Bennigan's or any of those other places where they put shit on the walls, you'll probably enjoy Joe's Crab Shack. You'll be prepared for the pitfalls as well. It's overpriced and under-seasoned. It's dried out when fried up. It's unoriginal and bland. But if you douse everything with malt vinegar and tartar sauce, I contend that even cardboard would go down smooth.  I've been here several times on others' bill, and have left with the same lackluster impression and a belly full of grease. I've had the combos, fried and grilled, the crab sandwich, the fish and chips and the crab dip, and I really can't even rank them in order of best to worst because nothing stands out as stellar or atrocious. It's all just...there.  Plus their margaritas are weak.   Eh."}
{"text":"we have not been here in years and were really pleased upon return. We were greeted by a friendly staff and also the Manager was available on the floor. We were seated promptly-served with ambition and the food was great. I feel the prices were fair and the Beer was cold( very important) will definitely return!"}
{"text":"This place needs to shut down. Crab was cold. The red potatoes served were basically raw. Server was bust talking to co-workers. I will never return. Forgot to mention that the floors were filthy."}
{"text":"I am always amazed that the less people a server has the slower it is. Arrived only 2 other people inside at 12:05 pm first clue. Seated right away and 7 minutes before anyone noticed us or took our drink order. Our waitress had 2 tables and came out of the back after the 7 minutes. It may just be me but no one really seems to care anymore? Food is ok and prices are reasonable but maybe a buffet is better as you control your own destiny.  The new mediocrity in service workers. It seems like no one wants to cover the floor anymore or interact with customers. Not smother them but at least have a presence in the floor.  Then the 10 minute wait for the check."}
{"text":"No crab in the crab nachos, no lobster on the redfish lobster which was 1/2 of a small fish, no flavor in the lobster buckets, the eastern platter was all French fries and fried onions.   Only star is for the Great Service, nice people, but will never eat in the Pittsburg one again.   If visiting station square eat at Texas de Brazil  New Brunswick one is great, actually has crab in the dip."}
{"text":"Worst lobster I've ever had.  Wateterd down.  David the manager was a prick.   Service was good but ill never go back."}
{"text":"Joe's has really gone down hill steadily for the last 3 years. I'm sad to see this considering the prices are still high. I was given bad crab meat, via a sub par crab, cheap sausage, and a waiter who is just a bit off. Bye Joe's."}
{"text":"Ordered the Artic Bay Steampot and a side of twice baked potato cake. Sauce for crab/lobster pot was good but nothing special. Thinking back I should have tried the Cajun sauce because it was slightly bland. However, the baked potato was yummy.   The manager came over, introduced himself and thanked us for coming in. He asked about the service and the food. Very personable.  Server was friendly and nice.  Cute interior; restaurant had a very southern bayou theme with the fake fish on the wall, crab traps, life jackets etc.  Happy hour 4pm-7pm. Mon-Fri.  Bathroom: nice and clean"}
{"text":"This is actually my first time here. Let's just say, I want to move to Phoenix now. The food was so delicious!  The crab was my favorite part, so moist and full of flavor. To top it off we had a really attentive waiter. Very nice and full of smiles, he recommended certain foods, certain drinks. Overall a really cool guy! The restaurant was clean, and at the time I went it wasn't packed at all, which was 10pm."}
{"text":"I am being generous with a 3 star. We went there for lunch today. First off Michael our server was great, but the food was not. I had ceasar salad and clam chowder. The salad had hardly no dressing. The chowder had a plastic straw in it yuck ! They took the chowder away and said they were doing a new batch. I watched the cook put my FRESH chowder in the microwave oven. My husband had one of the crab and shrimp buckets and the shrimp was not deveined yuck again. The server Michael and the martini was great but nothing else."}
{"text":"The place was not even busy and yet no one waited on us.after asking for help someone said they would get someone for us but no one showed.  So we left."}
{"text":"Great seafood ,very friendly staff , shrimp was perfect, Bacon wrapped shrimp was out of this world,"}
{"text":"Not allergy friendly at all. My wife has Celiacs disease and is therefore Gluten-Free. She ordered a simple shrimp salad with NO Croutons. The server was very friendly, understanding and accommodating to her food allergy. The salad came out with Croutons. The server caught the mistake after she set the plate down and brought it to the back and asked the chef to remake it. When the salad came back out we could see the crumbs from the croutons which were picked off, not to mention he forgot one. We spoke to the manager who was very understanding the the situation and offered to bring another salad out, but by then they lost our trust. Needless to say my beautiful wife opted to not to eat there."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this restaurant.  Good atmosphere, service and food.  The tables were a bit too close together for my tastes.  Also, it was slightly pricey.    A good experience overall, and I will be going back."}
{"text":"Downhill is the key word - I don't know what happened to this particular location but I am shocked they stay open. The crab cakes are abysmal and just about everything else is at best mediocre. Spare yourself and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"i must have low standards compared to the other reviews for joe's.  i ordered a caesar salad and thought it was just okay.  i'm a fan of the king crab bucket with joe's bbq seasoning and 3 small potatoes and 1 large corn.  not that it was enough food but i asked for a sausage too.  i can't have a bucket without sausage.  i was pleased with my main course.  jerrod was our server and i thought he was good especially when he ran out to the parking lot to catch us because we forgot our to go box.  the karaoke singing was something i would avoid next time but would return."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat!!  Service is great!   Try the Joes Famous BBQ seasoning on the Dungeness crab! It's the only seasoning I order on my crab! Delicious!! Also their crab dip is so goooood!  Also they have an amazing happy hour Mon-Fri 3-7 at the bar!!  I have never had a bad experience here. Make sure to sign up for their email club, they send you great coupons!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were promptly greeted and seated. The waitress was friendly and fast. We were crossed between ordering the king crab or the queen snow crab and she recommended the queen since everything is done by weight. It was delicious! We replaced the potatoes for an extra order of corn! Perfect decision! The crab cracked/snapped with the meat gliding out! I only needed the crab cracker to open the claws only. We look forward to coming back!!"}
{"text":"Expensive for what you get. Both my sister and I had tummy aches after eating here so be warned! She got the New Orleans pot while I ordered the Snow Crab. The portions are really small compared to places like Hot N Juicy or the Boiling Crab. Service was also a little slow."}
{"text":"Used to be so better. Crabs taste like been frozen and processed."}
{"text":"I had a bad experience with the food and serving sizes, but the manager was very understanding.  He made up for the bad experience and turned it around. I was very satisfied after talking to the manager and seeing how passionate he was about his restaurant and making guests happy."}
{"text":"I came here with the wife and was eventually joined by my sisters in law.   We were seated quickly, which is what I'd expect on a Monday night. We were greeted promptly and given our drinks which consisted of lemonade and iced tea.  We eventually ordered our meals. I had one of the combos which included a crab cake, fish and chips, stuffed shrimp, and onion strings. My wife ordered the queen crab pot with a garlic butter sauce.  First off, I'll start with the good - the crab legs were good. The crab cake seemed a bit overly salty, but was overall pretty good.   Now, for the rest. Service overall was very slow. When we decided to try a mixed drink it took 15 minutes before it arrived at the table. The meals, save for the crab legs, were generally over salted. The stuffed shrimp were.... interesting. They give you 4, 2 were plenty for me because I couldn't eat any more of them. The onion strings were good if you got the edges of them. The middle of them was soggy and seemed like they hadn't been in the fryer long enough. I don't know what the heck they did with the fish fillet, but the batter was salty, and the flavor was wrong. That's the only way to describe it. The fish itself definitely had the frozen-thawed sense about it. Definitely not fresh. The tartar sauce they gave me may as well have been mayonnaise. That's all it really was.  When the checks arrived the waitress disappeared and we waited another 15 minutes before we'd finally had enough and sought out the manager to take care of our bills.   I would like to give them another shot but I just can't feel it's worth the money to gamble for a sub par experience."}
{"text":"I decided to have my dinner tonight with a colleague.  Ordered side salad & Mozzarella Sticks for dinner as I wished that they'd have more selections for vegetarian,  Love the place."}
{"text":"Ate here the day after Christmas because I did not want to cook. Our food was surprisingly good for this chain restaurant. I had snow, king and queen legs. Steamed perfectly.Hubby had a big fried platter and he liked it. So why 3 stars? Well, my dish wad 31 dollars, and while this is seafood, I feel this a little overpriced for 1and a 4th lbs. Of crab legs. (More shell than meat) There was also an issue with dessert but it was taken care of by the manager. Service was 5 stars but I am not sure we would return just because it is so pricey. Our bill was 78 dollars and I feel like the Angry crab is just as good amd cheaper."}
{"text":"Used to be a fan of Joe's but the last two trips have been disappointing. Our recent trip had us eating undercooked calamari, so/so fish and stuffed shrimp that I think they forgot the shrimp. Hate to say it but I think this was my last trip here."}
{"text":"So as a belated birthday, My family treated me to Joe's Crab shack, the anticipation was unreal.. so we roll in Saturday 06/02/2012. The drive was fast, and the  Location - Not bad to get to Appearance- Liked it Seating-  Ample ... although not sure whey a party of 4 was put in the party of 6 or larger but what ever. Service- Surprising SeaFood - NOT even CLOSE to the portions on menu or in the commercials Now Hamburgers and Fries---Awesome. Saddest moment in a very long time..  that the desert was better than the meal...  Sad part the\"Hype\"did not even come close...  Sad"}
{"text":"So let me start with saying we've been here multiple times over years but today was just terrible. Our kids had had dental work in the morning and were restricted to soft foods so they had pancakes with them. Hubby and I were just trying to have a nice lunch on a day we'd taken off to go to the dentist anyways. Nope was not to be. We walked in and the place was dead, maybe 1 or 2 other tables had customers. As soon as they tried to seat us and they saw the pancakes and said no sorry you can't have outside food here you'll need to leave it in the car. Ok sure, but since I'm walking out to my car anyways why should I bother to walk back in? But hubby wanted to try anyways and asked to speak to a manager, so the \"on duty manager\" talks to him and she says that it is the general manager's policy and also it is a health code violation. A health code violation? No way, I don't believe it. So he asked to talk to the general manager directly. Well the same on duty manager comes back and says well he said there can be an exception due to the kids dental work, but just this one time. He didn't even bother to talk to us and tell us himself or enforce his own policy. BTW if really was a health code violation there shouldn't be ANY exceptions, so this is obviously an arbitrary rule. Needless to say we left, they aren't going to have our business today or any other day. We have plenty of other options that won't provide harassment to customers willing to pay $80 + for lunch."}
{"text":"People really crap on this place in the reviews... I'm from Alaska and so naturally I'm a huge seafood brat and a huge critic when it comes to all seafood in Arizona. Usually pretty bleh but this place wasn't too bad. And I have absolutely no complaints about the service! People need to cut this place a little slack .. definitely not the best seafood I've had, by far. But decent and pricing isn't bad at all for seafood in the middle of the desert."}
{"text":"I am giving t four stars because my boyfriend acted like he had never had food so good.  For me it was more like a three star experience.   We had a couple of buckets of crab legs.  I believe we had queen legs.  We also had calamari.  It was all good.  The boy paid (as it is supposed to be) so I can't speak to cost  The food was fair to good.  I wasn't blown away.  Lots of flies so that was gross."}
{"text":"I went for lunch today got a table wated 5minutes for the server to come to get me a drink took my order another guy deliver the food my server never came to ask me how is my meal I didn't get refill for my drink I needed lemon and souce I never seen the server come for me at all so eat ask for the check and leave. There was this girl going around every table to see how everything was exept mine I tried to get her attencion and she didn't even look . I don't know if cause I'm brown they did this too me but never going back to this racist restaurant"}
{"text":"Solid food and service. I had no claw extremities on either of my crab clusters. For a dish that cost me 27 dollars and them... corn .10; 31/35 shrimp(max) 6 @ $8/# is $1.5; potatos (3 small reds) a couple cents; snow crab $5-6/# for a half # cluster; and the dungeoness which is a little more expensive, 8ish . So about $7 their cost. How can they justify such a mark up and neglect to send the claws? Would call this a 2.5 star mistake but its not available."}
{"text":"Food good but wait staff over extended took  1 hour to get food.  Couple seated across gave up and walked out. J"}
{"text":"I ordered the Sampler platter.  It came with cheese balls, lobster spread with tortilla chips and calamari.  The tortilla chips were a bit oily than I would have liked.   The waiter was nice and attentive. We had a late dining experience and he still had a smile on his face.  I'm not use to using fried foods so I got full really fast."}
{"text":"We dined here a couple times so far this year.  The Station Square location is okay.  We really wanted to eat outside, but the picnic tables looked pretty dilapidated.  So, we opted for a booth inside.  This place is so kitzy.  Even the tables are a designer's worst nightmare.  They have beach junk everywhere.  Both times, our service was fairly attentive.  On our recent visit, I went crazy and got a Crab Daddy feast.  Three kinds of crab legs:  Snow crab, Dungeness crab and and King crab!  I honestly don't know which was which.  My bf even had to train me in the use of the crab cracker and the claw.  Love, love, loved playing with my food.  Nothing more fun than eating with your hands.  What a mess!!  It came with my choice of seasoning, I picked Chesapeake Style which is basically Old Bay Seasoning even on new potatoes and corn on the cob.  BJ got the Skillet Paella.  The skillet had clams, shrimp, mussels, scallops and sausage a tomato basil sauce served over rice and topped with crisp calamari.  No mess here.  He was cheating!  I believe there are three very important elements for a great dining experience.  Service, atmosphere and quality food.  Joe's Crab Shack seems to get by without any of these three......LOL"}
{"text":"Love the meals they Are the best sea food in the Arizona area"}
{"text":"Joe's is the type of place you go because the kids like it and are entertained... which is exactly why we went. Godson got an award at school and he wanted to go to Joe's as his celebration dinner. Here is how it went down:  PROS: Again, this place is designed for kids, it seems. The playground kept them busy when they were over their dinner after 10 minutes. It is sort of cartoony and looks more like a theme park than a restaurant. I am not into the singing and dancing, but again it entertains the kids, so whatever. The servers are friendly enough and the service was decent, though they tend to run around like they are going crazy. The location is easy to get to and parking is never a problem.  CONS: The food is just not good, especially for what you get. The prices are pretty ridiculous, actually. In the steamer pots the crab we got was tiny and impossible to crack open. We had to ask for shell crackers to which the response was, \"Oh, Ill see if they have some in the kitchen.\" What? This is a seafood restaurant. They also put unshelled shrimp in the kids meal, which isnt a big deal, except when you are 6 and have no idea how to remove a shell from a shrimp.   Overall, this place entertains the kids, but the prices are insane for the portion and quality of food you get, especially in a town awash with good seafood options. If you want some great seafood at decent prices I suggest you try The Boiling Crab."}
{"text":"I really thought this place would have a better rating! I am giving it only 4 stars because of how ridiculously priced everything is, aside from that food and service were great! I came here with my mom and sister this past weekend and really enjoyed the food! They really give you a lot, in fact I could barely finish everything! I would say it is about on par with  Red Lobster as far as flavor but it really satisfied our seafood craving. I would visit again...on a particularly hefty payday..."}
{"text":"Seafood is one of my favorites, I usually don't like the chain seafood places becase it just doesn't seem as fresh somehow, but I got to hand it to this place it has some pretty decent flavors, freshness and mixed assortment in my steam pot!  Large Anartic king crab legs, clams, shrimp, New Zealand green muscles, smoked sauage, steamed with a spicey white wine and old bay seasoning. It wasn't mushy or chewy as I thought it might.   Service was good, entertainment was fun and food pretty decent."}
{"text":"A family fave, Joe's did not disappoint! Every time we come to the mainland, we go to Joe's. Some times are better than others. This time? Exceptional! Our server, Monique, was awesome!!! Such great energy!!! She put smiles on all of our faces as soon as we sat down! She was always their with a smile and conversation when we wanted it, left us alone when we were busy talking or eating, and always available if we needed anything. Smart, friendly, and beautiful, We all loved her! Paul, the manager, personally checked on us and thanked us for choosing Joe's. He was so genuinely friendly, not just doing his job.  I was very impressed with the service!!! Queen crab - Fire grilled: a winner to the nth degree! The crab was so sweet that I didn't need any butter (and I really  butter!)! The corn was crisp and juicy, the potatoes, perfectly done! The \"Sunset Fire Grilled\" style, rub, sauce, whatever, left me licking my fingers! Go to Joe's Crab Shack on N. Rainbow Rd in Las Vegas, if you have a chance! Ask for Monique and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed not even the slightest, I am from Boston so I am spoiled when it comes to fresh amazing seafood spots. The clams where the size of peas which is what ruined it for me the most. The clam strips where nothing more that a batch of fried batter. I know moving out to the desert I would be giving up my love for seafood on a regular basis, and only being able to indulge when I visit home. I figured i would at least give it a try,but It will probably be the one an only time I ever disappoint myself like this again.  P.S stop adding New England names to to your menu items because its not even comparable to the greatness of back home recipes."}
{"text":"Went there with family who was visiting from Florida. Will NEVER go back, the portions were very small, the food was cold, the food was not very tasty, we had to wait forever for our food, they did not serve the appetizers until the meal came, the service was very poor, and then to top it all off - it was way overpriced.  NEVER AGAIN!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is fun, and customer service was awesome, food is good, and prices are okay. Since I have to force my husband to come with me to seafood restaurants he actually had a great time here. He liked the ambiance and music. He loved the dancing, he actually joined in.   I got the steam pot with Dungeness crab, shrimp, corn and potatoes. Wish they had more spices but I'm just wishing they would open a boiling crab here in AZ. Anyway it was good and we enjoyed dinner here. It was kind of packed when we went, parking was kind of scarce but maybe because it's near a mall."}
{"text":"My Husband and I just ate at Joe's and had a wonderful meal .  The food was great and our server Robby was amazing.  He was so helpful with my husband deciding on his meal because his eyes were bigger than his stomach and needed help deciding what to order. He even shelled out the crawdad's for him.  Robby kept checking on us to see if everything was fine and if we needed anything.  He was amazing and we look forward to coming back to see him and enjoy more great meals."}
{"text":"Ive been to a couple of these around the country. but for this time this year, the service was horrible no thanks to cody d. looks like it is run by freshmen, college kids were just hanging at the hostess counter. cody forgot my chowder and didnt apologize. but ill say that the crab cake dinner was good so ill give an extra star for that."}
{"text":"Service has been a wee bit slow. Bad luck is table/waitress. Hope the food is better."}
{"text":"Went to Joe's for a seafood fix. Living in Phoenix we weren't expecting it to nock our socks off therefore we weren't disappointed. The service was good. I got the shark bite drink it was good but not very strong. Three of us split two crab buckets. We had the Sam Adams with crab,clams, sausage and corn and potatoes. It was good but not anything memorable. The other bucket I didn't have much of but it featured a different kind of crab that was spicier and better flavor then the Sam Adams in my opinion. The environment is fun and the service was good."}
{"text":"Amber was great. The manager surprised us with some fresh coconut shrimp after she noticed my buddy's was a bit burnt.  He hadn't even noticed. Good example of great service."}
{"text":"Let's get the obvious out of the way:  It's a chain restaurant.  They have goofy stuff on the walls.  The staff does goofy dances.  They have balloon animals.  And they have a bucket on your table that you can throw scraps into.  Now let's get into the heart of the review: It's pleasant.  They know their shrimp and crab, and their Salmon Orleans is delicious.  Our waitress was funny and went above and beyond in providing good service.  The atmosphere was relaxing and very casual.  They have live music.  Sometimes a seemingly ordinary place can just remind you of what's it like to simply have a good time during dinner.  If anything, it reminds me of those little tourist seafood shacks that you visit on vacation with (again) the goofy stuff on the wall, but the food is excellent.  Take that vacation feeling, put it here, and there you go.  I've eaten here before and have never had a bad experience, but this last time, with the food and the attitude just inherently worked for me.  It's also reasonably priced, with a decent selection, so you can easily find something notable to eat here.  If you want that vacation beach resort attitude without the ocean (trust me, Vegas EXCELS in not providing an ocean experience), you can't do much better than here."}
{"text":"first of all we would like to thank el.he was awesome.  he made our dining experience very nice. loved the dancing, they had some guys who really danced awesome.  thanks for everything.  karren and phil gonzales"}
{"text":"I have to start off by saying that the portions are great. I came here with one of my good friends around his birthday, and he's a guy who pretty much always finishes his meal when he goes out. But this place was an exception. We had plenty of food to take home. We also paid enough for it; this place isn't the cheapest!    All said and done, I think it was worth it. The crabs are good, of course, but so are the other dishes. Their specials and platter options make it pretty easy for you to try quite a few different foods between your appetizer and main dish. It's in a cool spot too. I'd recommend it."}
{"text":"There's really nothing inherently wrong about chain restaurants. I don't like when people automatically write off a place just because it has other locations...  I printed off a coupon and got a free appetizer worth about $10! That's already a plus of a chain restaurant because the websites are great, organized and offer coupons. Anyways, I thought the amount of food and the taste of food were great! I took my family here this past weekend and everyone came back full and satisfied! We ordered 2 steampots, the crab nachos and the jumbo coconut shrimp. Surprisingly, it was enough for all of us (granted, my sis doesn't really eat seafood so she was happy with her hushpuppies and fries...). I really recommend the KJ steampot because it came with loads of goodness: snow crab, scallops on a stick, clams, 3 Maine lobster claws, an ear of corn and potatoes. The garlicky sauce was yummers! Although I did see in one of the pictures posted here that it should have come with some tubs of clarified butter. We did not get those. Oh, well.  The crab kit that everyone got was super cute and the buckets at every table were useful. I liked the setup and the speed of the food coming was fast as well. Our waiter was friendly enough but kind of slow at responding to things...e.g. I asked him for a knife since it didn't come with that as part of the table setting. He just stared at me for a few seconds and left. After 15 minutes, he came back with a huge bucket of knives. Lol, one would have been enough but at least I got my knife!  The atmosphere was lively; it certainly a popular restaurant in Station Square. It smelled fishy and the furniture looked slightly damp. I just wish they provide free cheddar biscuits or something..."}
{"text":"My buddy was leaving town and decided to have his final dinner here. It was a large party but they seemed to handle all of us well. I actually ate prior to coming since I didn't find out until last minute.  I like that they have patio seating if you want to be outside.  The food I did have was some of my friends nachos which they gave a big helping of and it tasted good. I also ordered a strawberry and (mango?) smoothie. It cooled me down. I also had to try the root beer float and was not disappointed! I also tried a bite of a fish burger and it tasted good.  I definitely have to go back and order my own food next time hahaha. I give 3 stars for decent food and good service."}
{"text":"Normally after a visit to this restaurant, I would be raving about how yummy the food was, or how much we enjoyed the service.... Unfortunately, this is not the case this time around. Although our waitress, Mariette, was super awesome (no, like seriously, she rocked), there was another server  (name unknown) who completely ruined our entire experience.... She had dark hair and large hoop earrings who you could see through the opening in the kitchen area eating food off of readily prepared plates on the warming line. Being in the culinary industry myself, it sickened me that not a single person on the kitchen staff stopped her from grabbing some poor patron's food off the plate and shoving it in her mouth where people could clearly see! To make it worse, and more shameful on her part, she walked out of the back STILL CHEWING on her way to continue waiting her tables!!!! Standard hospiatlity tells you not to walk out on the front end chewing food, but SNHD regulations (as well as ServSafe and General culinary guidelines) state that a server should NEVER have their hands in your plate. Thankfully it was not mine, but I am still disgusted beyond reason, none the less. I left a note for the manager to read after we left, because I was not looking for anything to be discounted, but definitely wanted this issue brought to light. Needless to say, I would no longer recommend this establishment to ANYONE, EVER! And we will most definitely NOT be going back again thanks to the unsafe food handling practices of this disgusting excuse for a \"waitress\"."}
{"text":"I wasn't all that impressed with this place. The food doesn't seem all that great. It's just regular quality Seafood. Not terrible, but for the price and hype I expected more"}
{"text":"[2.5 rounded up to 3 at best] My increasingly rare visits here just further add to my disappointment.   I find myself here with family or friends who are still convinced they have to stop in here while in the Valley.    I have no issue with the environment or the service. What I do have an issue with is the food quality.  Unless you like your seafood fried or are just here for some apps and drinks, there are better places in the Valley for seafood for the price.  Although, I wouldn't get the occasional employee flash mob dance routine.    My last trip here I ordered one of their steamer pots with the seafood, corn on the cob, potatos and a sausage.  The pot I chose had crab and shrimp. The crab was meh and the steamed shrimp were super over cooked.  I could do better at the frozen food section at the local grocery.   Next time I am invited to join folks here I may just pass on the invite."}
{"text":"I have to give credit to our server for trying his best to make sure everything went smoothly but stuff beyond his control just kept backfiring.    My wife orders the 3 crab sampler.  They only give her king crab and then the manager wants to do a whole reorder on the damn thing and take her king crab away?!?!?  It took 30 min to come out and then they want her to wait another 30 cuz they screwed up?  F-that.  They just give us a another order leaving us w/ waaay too much crab which is fine w/ us.    They forget the sausage in my steam plate..not that it was that big a deal but whatever.    No lobster/crab cracking utensil in the entire place.  Whaa?????  Some douchebag at the next table in front of all his friends asks our waiter \"Do they still make you dance?\" in such a belittling way..I really felt bad for our waiter.    But the food they actually served us was fine for the price but I'd still take the crab at the Wynn buffet over this though."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to it and sadly disappointed with the reality. Undercooked shrimp and scallops and low quality fish."}
{"text":"Had my husband's birthday party last night at this location.  We had 1 server her name is Sandra. Our server was Outstanding! She was very attentive.  Very professional and helped our small party turn out great. I gave 4 stars because our crab legs were kind of dry. Overall we had a good time. Sandra should be rewarded for her hard work. Thank you Sandra."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate this casual destination chain over the weekend. We both had crabcakes which were delish. Drink was eh, tasted syrupy. The place is a good one to get together with friends. There is stuff hanging all over the walls and ceiling. Kitschy fun."}
{"text":"Been to this Joe's about 4-5 times.  Always enjoyed it.  It's not fine dining, but eating crab is usually a little work so expect that.  Fun place.  Try it for casual dining and a good time."}
{"text":"First off Elizabeth and Steven were great bartenders. I ordered the Crab Dip appetizer and the East Coast Platter entree (crab cake, southern stuffed shrimp, fish and chips, and onion strings, with Tabasco pepper butter sauce on the side). Overall i was dissappointed in the food but the bartenders brought it up to 3 stars. Crab dip was pretty darn good but after half a boat of dip I started to notice it was pretty salty. For the Entree  the fries were limp and soggy with grease and only lukewarm. The fried onions were pretty bland but crispy. The crab cake had an initial hint of lemon but was so overpowered with pepper, that I couldn't taste any crab.....that's how peppery it was. The crab cake finally had a decent crab flavor when i got to the middle of it. The stuffed shrimp was flavorful at first but the spiciness was completely overpowering after a few seconds. I would have chalked one up to being \"southern\" but then the bacon was cooked on top but raw on bottom. Dissappointing. Description says served with Tabasco sauce and the sauces were on side. No warning that the dish would be so spicy without sauce......time to take omeprazole. Fish was OK nothing bad but nothing to rave about. The tartar sauce was sweet (like it was made with sweet pickles because I tasted no dill) with too much mayo (never had sweet tartar before.......maybe it's a southern thing). Bathroom was clean but smelled like sewage........not the best smell after ingesting seafood but I'm lucky I have an iron gut. Maybe one more chance but it's iffy."}
{"text":"Hadn't been here for several years. Now I remember why. Great service from our waiter. He was very nice. But TINY portions of crab! And just sub par quality overall. Went to red lobster few weeks after this and got way more crab for less money. This place is just low quality in general. Paid $60 for a meal where the best part was a $2 fried shrimp appetizer."}
{"text":"I grew up and spent most of my life in tempe, and have passed by this location many times always thought about going in. My first time, was horrible. It was a tuesday and really slow. We sat outside. Our server took for ever to bring us our drinks and completely forgot my beer. I cancelled my beer and figured id just order it from the bartender. When I go to the bar, no one is bartending (hmmm wondrer if thats why drinks took forever). Find out my outside server is actually the bartender! Shes supposed to handle the drinks for the entire restaurant and take on outside tables? Just horrible, when we ordered our food, we waited 45 minutes before we decided to jist cancel the order. Management looked confused and did nothing to help besides offering to comp our food. I don't want free food, I just want food. Worst experience ive hlever had, and will not ever be giving Joe's crab shack another try. How has the place been there so long?"}
{"text":"They do try to please their customers. When I came here, service was slow (seated at 7:30, started eating at 9pm) and I was pretty ticked off, and i thought they had just forgotten about us. but turns out that they did realize we were waiting and the manager came over to our table to apologize (without us complaining to the staff) and took the appetizer we ordered off our check.  A for effort! I have to say, their staff was really friendly though even though there was a little mishap  Food is delicious, but nothing dazzling."}
{"text":"Service was GREAT!!!  The food was not even sub-standard.  Had the East Coast platter. Crab cake was good. The bacon on the bacon wrapped stuffed shrimp was half cooked.  The fish was soggy with grease and barely warm.  A shame because JCS used to be decent...but then it was 70% empty on a Saturday night so that speaks volumes. The bill for my dinner and coke was $21. Was not worth $5."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the waitress was excellent. After that there just isn't much more to say that is positive. The peel and eat shrimp were overcooked, the salmon was fishy and the chicken was awful. I want to like Joes because I think the concept is great but the food quality just isn't there."}
{"text":"Service is really good. Customer service is excellent . Shout out to Johnny who's very helpful to us and friendly as well. (Location: Rainbow) hopefully you see this comment. We're the couple that ordered crab daddy on 07/09/17. He deserves a raise or promotion!"}
{"text":"I had the salmon Orleans, which was quite tasty.  I also ordered a dinner salad that I had to return as too much of the lettuce was spoiled.  This is a common problem with those of us who orders salads frequently-- lettuce spoils easily.  The manager did come over to apologize, which I thought was very nice of her."}
{"text":"The staff was extra nice for our Dinner. We had groups in earlier in the week and did not have a good experience. We shared that information with the manager and it seemed to help."}
{"text":"Every time we go to Joe's crab shack, it's been great. Our servers were always friendly and attentive. Great place to actually receive SERVICE in the phoenix area."}
{"text":"I hate reviewing chains.  That being said, Joe's seems to get a bad rap from people thinking that the seafood should be fish-off-the-back-porch-and-fry-it-up fresh. This Joe's is in Arizona, folks. And it's not bad.  We've been there several times. Are there better seafood restaurants out there? You bet. But I think this place has a decent bang for the buck.  The service has been at least adequate if not outstanding every time we've visited. I'm not crazy about the line-dancing routine that always happens, but the staff are good about refilling drinks, menu knowledge and experience.   The cooks are decent at preparing seafood, making sure it's not too tough or underdone. Usually, though, it's on the side of overdone that keeps me from giving more than 3 stars.  If you're expecting a lobster place in Maine, go to Maine. If you need a seafood fix at a somewhat reasonable price....here you go."}
{"text":"If you're looking for very poor service and over cooked seafood for over $40 a person then you're in the right place! If not, save your self the trouble and go some where else!"}
{"text":"I've always seem to like this place. Their food never seems to disappoint me. Besides the prices being outrageous, this place still seems to find a way to satisfy me every time.  When we come here to eat, we usually get just about the same thing every time. A pot of seafood, with crab legs, shrimp, sausages, and corn. Every now and then we get a appetizer, but usually the hot pot is good enough to fill us up. Spices we usually get the same thing, the lousiana spice or new orleans, something like that, I don't really want to go back to the menu to look. But yea, it's the same spice we always get.  Food is pretty filling, but prices are crazy expensive. I really rather go to Boiling Crab or something similar because it is a bit cheaper for more bulk. On top of that Joe's Crab Shack isn't very friendly on location. This particular restaurant is in LV and we're from the Bay Area, the closest Joe's Crab Shack is in San Francisco which is a about an hour away from where we live.  All in all this place was alot more friendlier than the place in San Francisco, and I mean ALOT more friendlier in service. That alone has me rating this place slightly higher than the other Crab Shack."}
{"text":"We went to try there Fish fry for $10.99 available Monday, Tuesday & Wednesday. I have to say, you get a lot of food for the money.  But the fried calamari was the best.  The plate was full of calamari & frys.  Could not finish it all.  One of has the fish and the other the shrimp.  Also comes with green beens, onions rings, hush puppies & coleslaw.  Signing up for there club also gets you $$ off coupons almost weekly."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  The service was perfect and the food was phenominal!  I also like that the manager came to the table to see how our food was and if we were happy.  I will definitely return to this restaurant!"}
{"text":"First time at this place.. We were seated rite away.. Food was DELISH but our server PAUL was the worst... When we needed him, he was no where to be found.. Other waiters/waitresses were giving their customers GREAT service.. NEVER RETURNING TO THIS PLACE EVER.... Thanks to PAUL.."}
{"text":"I have only been to Joe's crabshack one other time.  I don't really remember how the food was the first time, but after eating here again I know why it's not memorable.  On my latest visit I ordered a dish of crab stuffed shrimp.  How awesome does that sound?  Sadly, it was so bland!   The night that we were there was Super Bowl night and the restaurant was nearly empty.  So I was a little confused why our food took so long to come out.  It took 45 minutes and it was only my husband and I at our table.  We're the cooks watching the game instead of making our food?    The food wasn't great and we waited too long.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"I like the crab pot steamers they have and they seem to get fresh oysters.  The service is good, ambiance fine and the drink menu delicious.  Although they are getting away from the deep fried fish and creamy sauces, dieters beware this place can pack a lot of fat and calories.  Gr8 atmosphere for kids but not place for a business meeting."}
{"text":"We just left due to the lack of service.  We were the very first customers. Our waiter didn't have good knowledge of the menu and didn't seem to care, should've been our clue to leave.  Took over a half hour for him to bring us our drinks and appetizer.  I had to go find him to order another round, it was then that we were fed up with the service.  The manager wasn't any better, didn't seem to be put out by us leaving.  We will NEVER go back...I would advise you do the same too.   *i wouldn't have given a single star but the app wouldn't let me post without leaving a star."}
{"text":"Dou you ever try to go back to a restaurant and order something you loved the last time just to be disappointed. The last time I had the Sam Adams pot and the flavors were full and unique. this time someone forgot the beer or something, Very disappointed it is not consistent. Server Matthew could be more attentive, he disappeared for long periods.  Could be better, had better."}
{"text":"First time here. My wife and I were in the mood for crab legs. The place was 2/3 full. We were seated immediately, and greeted within 3 minutes. The server was very helpful making suggestions, and really knew the menu inside and out!  We went for 2 of their crab daddy feast, and some alcoholic beverages. The food was hot and tasty and served in a timely manner. The server took a pic for us in our bibs LOL!  A bit overpriced for the food, but the ambiance and service made it worth it!  4 stars. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Great service!!! Had the classic crab pot SOOOOOO GOOOOD!!!!    Bartender was great!   He will hook you up!!!"}
{"text":"They do not clean the seafood. My fiance and I got one of the bucket meals with lobster and shrimp. The shrimp still had the poop veins in the middle and the lobster was covered in crap veins once I opened the shell. Very disgusting. The manager on duty at the time stated she ate the shrimp all the time with crap still in them. Only offered to take care of our appetizer.  Will never go back.  Red lobster is so much better."}
{"text":"Terribly overpriced food. I know the place is suppose to be a \"shack\" but feels dirty . Food was okay overall.  $70 dollars for two adults and a child ."}
{"text":"It was my first time at any of these shacks and I wasn't disappointed. The costumer service could have been friendlier and that's the reason for the stars but the food was good(: I will definitely go back at some point in life."}
{"text":"It's really not fair that I even rate this place since I grew up on the coast eating fabulous seafood all my life...but when you are in a land locked state and just want a quick, expensive seafood fix don't come here. Snarky, young, and stupid wait staff seem to be the norm. Purchased an appetizer and drinks and the little wench brought us out our meal meal immediately after giving us our appetizer and then grunted and groaned that she could put it in the back and bring it out again later, not offering to let us enjoy sour appetizer and drinks and bring us a fresh meal in 10-15 minutes or so. WTF? Of course we said no with that kind of offer. WTF? So sorry to put you out, you drain on society. This young woman is the one millennial who gives the millennial generation such a crappy reputation! WTF? Sorry for my rant - in the future if you need a seafood fix and don't want to spend a lot of money $$$$, the seafood chain to choose is Red Lobster. Say NO to JOES."}
{"text":"Great service ,fast,friendly, even though they ran out of ketchup and we had to use packets for 4 kids meals * Gera* still made it a pleasant family dinner for us"}
{"text":"This is one of the worst Joes we have been too. Service was terrible had to ask for a refill 3 times our waitress was hardly seen the clam strips were over cooked we asked for our fries crispy it was obvious they kept the clam strips cooking w the fries they were chewy and obviously over cooked . Hopefully this was just a bad day for them and they need to train there staff"}
{"text":"I can't even give them 1 star because we never ate. We were never acknowledged after we waked in the door. The guy at the for told us you can go sit at bench table. We sat and sat as numerous employees, can't call them servers cause no one offered any service. Watch a girl texting & moving papers around then go back into kitchen. So we left & will not ever return. They just watched is leave. Not a word or nod."}
{"text":"I thought we'd give Joe's Crab Shack a try and when we arrived at the restaurant, I remembered I had eaten at Joe's Crab Shack before but in Clearwater, Florida!  It's the exact same building and the same decorations inside and outside of the building.    On to the food - we wanted to go on the light side - so we ordered soups for everyone - lobster bisque was pretty good and the clam chowder was creamy.  We then ordered the Cajun Shrimp on ice appetizer and the \"fireballs\" (I thnk that's what they call it) was pretty yummy, too.  Then, we had the Joe's Original Crab Steampot for 2 and it was sizable and tasted OK - came with 2 corns and some potatoes and quite a no. of  dungeness and snow crab legs.  I think it needed a little more salt.    The zipper was a neat tool for eating the crabs!"}
{"text":"Always stop at Joe's when I go to Pittsburg. Staff is always nice and the seafood is awesome."}
{"text":"Went there with some friends for lunch after a PodcampAZ meeting. Had the Crab Cake Chipotle Caesar Salad. It was pretty good, nice southwestern twist on the caesar. I'm sorry those other reviewers had such a bad experience. The waitress was friendly and even with 6 of us we weren't waiting too long for food or service at all. To be fair it wasn't very busy either at 1:30 in the afternoon on a Saturday.   Had a good time, would go again."}
{"text":"The crab legs were delicious and fresh!  We ordered the crab bucket that came with a variety of different kinds of crab.  I was less of a fan of the king crab because those were harder to open and more spiky, but still tasty.  The atmosphere is definitely tailored to a certain crowd (families with little kids) because I could have done without the loud music interruptions and dancing, but that is what Joe's is known for I guess.  I would come back again to eat that crab bucket!  For all the reviews of bad service, I was concerned. But our server was more than attentive and helpful.  We had no complaints!"}
{"text":"Came for first time this Joe s crab Shack and my experience was beyond amazing. From the moment we entered the door till we left the staff made us feel special.   Our server Reem went above and beyond so we can have amazing experience at Joe s crab shack.   As far as food and drink goes it was really good.   Thank you everyone for making our experience great. I can't wait to come back!!!!"}
{"text":"Very simple seafood choices here. No stress. good steam pots and new menu choice. One of us order the salmon and over done, so have them under cook it. One order stuff shrimp with crab, delicious. One order maui mahi, very good. and of course coconut shrimp was Ono licious."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for excellent seafood when away from a coast. The staff is ALWAYS willing to personalize my meal and they make sure you leave happy!  Service is stellar if you engage the management if needed.  If you get crappy service or sub-par stuff, speak up in a nice way and they will take care of you.    Skip the Red and eat here!"}
{"text":"Came here for a late night craving at 10:45pm... Arrived 15 minutes before kitchen closes and they let us order still. Had the queen crab bucket with garlic and it was delicious. I would have loved if I had more garlic flavor but I was still loved it! Of course we were the only ones there eating except for the guys at the bar since it was so late but the employees were super nice and the manager talked to us twice. Had an awesome night with delicious food"}
{"text":"Joe's Crab Shack is the kind of place you try once and never think about it again.  The food is nothing impressive, the atmosphere is a bit gimmicky, and the service isn't the best.  Although they give you enough food to cover their prices, it's not exactly the best seafood place in Arizona.  Then again, we do live in the desert!"}
{"text":"I'm just not that impressed. The menu isn't that great.  The prices are higher than they should be for what you get.  They atmosphere is fun in a \"this was designed to look like every other fun location\" kind of way - but completely lacks it's sincerity.    I've gone twice with someone who LOVES seafood, and her favorite restaurant is Red Lobster (Ultimate Feast every time...).  Even she wasn't impressed.  It didn't do anything for her.  She said it appeared that the crab legs had been previously frozen and then re-heated too quickly (she thought maybe microwave).  I don't cook, but she does more than regularly so I'm going to trust her on that one.    We wanted to like it so we tried once more in case it was a bad night for both them and us and decided that really, this just wasn't it for us.    Their \"Free Crab Tomorrow\" sign always makes me smile, but at least now I know to laugh at the joke and just keep on driving."}
{"text":"I'm not impressed. I knew it wasn't going to be a good experience when our waiter Matt couldn't repeat our drink order back correctly within less than 2 minutes of giving it to him. What's so hard about 2 ice teas and a child lemon aide???  Geez!! I ordered the main grill which is a whole lobster, cut in half, bacon wrapped scallops and bacon wrapped shrimp and dirty crab rice. EVERYTHING but the rice was overlooked and burnt!!!  The lobster was so over cooked the meat was shriveled and reduced to lobster jerky!!!  The shrimp and scallops so charred they were actually bitter. The only thing that saved this dish was rice. It was very good.   I doubt very seriously I will ever go here again. I only went to this one because it was convenient for my daughter and granddaughter.  The one on Rainbow is so much better.  Maybe they should cross train their cooks!!  The place wasn't busy and it was at lunch time so it wasn't like they were under a lot of pressure.  I should have complained right then but I didn't and that's my fault.  Still not going back though."}
{"text":"Went for the snow crab, and my girlfriend got the queen crab, both absolutely amazing! It is definitely pricey stuff, but you also have to take into account the great quality with no close oceans. Service was great as well, our server zach was very friendly and attentive but didn't overstay or get in the way of us enjoying our meal.    Hush puppies weren't my thing, but fries were good. :)"}
{"text":"If youre thinking about going here, or seated at the restaurant reading this, BAIL.  Brutal. Worst meal Ive had in a long time and I paid $40. SEEEE YA"}
{"text":"If I lived on one of the coasts, I would never go to Joe's.  However, living in landlocked Phoenix, Joe's is where I go when I need a crab leg fix without spending a ridiculous amount of money.  I ordered the steamed shrimp appetizer, which was not seasoned AT ALL, although it's supposed to be seasoned with Old Bay.  When I brought that the waitress' attention, she brought out some Old Bay for us to use, and told us that they don't steam the shrimp with the seasoning, they just add it after the fact.  So, they're basically seasoning the shells.  Nice.  For my meal I ordered the Diablo crab leg pot, and that also was poorly seasoned.  All in all, I wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"Talk about annoying - the wait staff, especially. No, it's not the service. It's the gimmicky, corny and self-humiliating \"dances\" they perform for their customers every few minutes. I guess eating mediocre food in peace isn't good enough.   The disco, flashing lights come on. That's your warning. It's also a free headache, compliments of Joe's. Then, there's clapping, hooraying, twisting, turning to music like the Village People. Absurd.   The food isn't that much better, either. Instead of a headache, you get to walk away with an upset stomach. Maybe it's the combo. Smile and nod. \"Yes, I'd like to order the Bucket of Shrimp with the I Want to Puke Music and Dancing.\"   So, why 2 stars? Beer. It's about beer - all about beer. Since it's Oct, everyone and their mother has a special pumpkin ale available. The one in the pic on the menu looked like the perfect mix to wash down bad service and even badder (yes, i said it) food. The waitress recommended Sam Adam's Oktoberfest instead. She brought me two huge samples of each... they probably both, together, made up a 1/2 pint! I was buzzed before I placed my order!   She was right, though. Sam Adam's is what to order.   I picked at my crab-stuffed shrimp, polished off the steamed veggies and washed the rice down with Oktoberfest that, almost, made the entire experience worth it.   What i wouldn't give right now for another pint of Oktoberfest. (But I'll be damned if I'm going back to Joe's to get it.)"}
{"text":"This place was pleasantly great for dinner.  Reminded me of living in the Seattle area.  Great selection on the menu and anytime a bib is an option, you know it's going to be fun.  Many different seafood options including many different bowls to dig into!  Highly recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"Arrived around 7:00 on a Thursday evening with a party of six.  Waited about 10 minutes for an available table.  We were six business associates so being seated at a booth was a little bit of a squeeze, but fortunately we knew each other well.  Turns out the table was a bit small for the food we ordered and six adults were battling elbows all evening. The service was fast, friendly and efficient.  I had the soup and salad, hard to mess that up, right. The salad was good as was the corn muffin, but the baked potato soup was somewhat lacking in flavor.  The meat entrees for the rest of the table were well received, but since barbecue sauces of various flavors are supplied on the table, we didn't understand why the mat came slathered with some other sauce that overwhelmed the flavor of the meat. In general it was an enjoyable meal albeit in very close quarters."}
{"text":"Sometimes you just need seafood and Phoenix, and if you're looking for a fun feel and a fair price, this Joe's is a good bet. I of course got the crab, and it was very tasty and larger portions than what you will find anywhere else."}
{"text":"Seriously this place/location has gone down hill! Service sucks, the food sucks, & it takes too long for anything. My Mahi-mahi was dry, the \"mango\" pico was gross plus it wasn't even mango someone used pineapple. They forget what they advertise...when we walked in I noticed the board above the hostess station. It's stated that if you follow them on Instagram & post a photo, show your server get a free appetizer. I did just that....she tells me she needed to speak w/ the manager. Comes back & asks for me to show her where I saw this because the manager didn't think it was up there. I agreed an lead the way to the hostess stand & showed her. She went to the back again & out walks the manager to check with his own two eyes. I got my free appetizer & have not been back."}
{"text":"Ordered jumbo coconut shrimp they weren't jumbo shrimp they was butterfly cut and double batter to give the look of jumbo shrimp was ok got the mahi fish was over cooked and rubbery place is a bit over priced for sea food can get better quality sea food other places for that price staff was great and friendly and fast that is the only reason I gave it a 3 star or I would gave it a 1 star if service was bad as the food"}
{"text":"POS system broken. Hair on food.  Had to ask for drinks order to be delivered after a 10-15 minute wait with maybe 4 tables occupied in the place. Worst restaurant experience I've had in years.  Word of advice: AVOID WITH EXTREME PREJUDICE   Bar Louie across the way is still corporate but better run, customer focused, and cleaner"}
{"text":"Ate here last night after driving by it for years. The stuffed mushroom appetizer was wonderful! Clam Chowder was o.k., a little salty. My date and I both enjoyed our dinners. Portions are good sized for the price, which you expect when you get off \"the Strip.\" We asked to sit outside although it was a little breezy, but the atmosphere was so worth it. When we got near the end of the meal, the server dropped the check and said he'd be back for it. No mention of coffee, after dinner drink, or the slightest suggestion of a favorite dessert. He just assumed we were done, maybe he shift was almost over?    Also, the manager came by during our meal to check on everything and introduce himself. That was a wonderful surprise and rarely happens in Vegas! Good for you Joe's! That is a personal touch!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent location, especially if you're going to shop at Arizona Mills.  This was my second visit to this particular location.  First time was great!  But, this time around, the service was slow and the food was mediocre.  It wasn't a busy day considering it was just after lunchtime (well, close to 1 PM).  I'd say that 25% of the restaurant was occupied.  That being said, there's no excuse for slow service.  Had to wait too long for drink re-fills and our food took too long to get out to us.  On a good note, this establishment appeared very clean."}
{"text":"The food is very good, however the service is rather slow. They brought us a drink to share and it was too sweet. We waited 10 minutes to trade it in for 2 beers. Wish they'd be a little more attentive....."}
{"text":"Very good visit everybody is so friendly and the place is so inviting!! The food was good and plenty of it!!! The crazy good crab dip is ah-ma-zing!!!!! Our waitress was friendly and so patient (we had 3 drunk guys haha) she did so good!!! Definitely will be coming back! The reason I gave it a 4 out of 5 was because sometimes we had to repeat and repeat and repeat or order but it does get a little loud so I understand so overall I loved it!!!!"}
{"text":"Great place with awesome customer service and good food!  We went to get dinner and my bf ordered king crab legs that were definitely on the small side so he asked for a new order. They were more tham happy and agreed that they were small. The waitress, Sarah (? I think that was her name? ) and the manager, Amber, were extra nice. James was also super nice! Thanks for a great dinner and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I hadn't been to Joe's in years and so my bf and I went last night. We ordered the crab dip and it tasted like fish dip... Horrible.  Lobster bisque soup.... Bland and tasted nothing like lobster.   Fish and chips were bland. We were both really disappointed by the whole meal. I don't know what happened to them but I'm done. I already told FB and I'm telling yelp now, don't waste your $$. WHAT HAPPENED TO THIS PLACE. WE USE TO LOVE IT.  OH and the server girl was nice and attentive but knew nothing about the food... We asked what kind of beer was used for the batter on the fish... She said she would ask and never came with a answer. I am also a server and pride myself on knowing my menu!!! So after finding out she had been with the company a while and was still clueless... Was sad. Part of being a good server is knowing the product!"}
{"text":"Run... This place should be condemned. Food is horrible, bathrooms are over run. This makes all the Joes Crab Shacks look Horrible  Lobster over cooked and was the size of a large prawn  Oysters were spoiled  Corn was under cooked too hard to eat  Crab legs over cooked and barely legal size"}
{"text":"This is not anything like the Joes Crab Shack you'll find in Anahiem, California. Read on...  After about 30 minutes waiting to get seated (in a nearly empty facility) and get menus our group of 6 were greeted by a half awake Joe's Crab Shack employee. She forgot my drink because she \"Didn't write it down.\"   After the staff danced around to \"Car Wash\" like they were zombies our waitress took our order. I ordered the Steak and Shrimp a 17 dollar meal. Steak well done. After a total of 1 hour walking into the restaurant I get my meal. The steak was dry and tasteless.   I concede that well done to some restaurant means cooked beyond belief, but usually the staff can give you heads up on stuff like that. This was not the case.  So with a bad dry taste in my mouth I say, don't go to this Joe's Crab Shack. You'll be better off going to the Claim Jumper next door."}
{"text":"My husband and I have always liked the food and service at Joe's, so it was a no-brainer to bring my step-family there last night while they were in town. After an awesome meal (with balloon characters for the little ones), my stepbrother dropped his wedding ring! We were outside on the deck, so there are pretty big gaps between the wood planks. After about 25-30 mijutes of searching, the family gave up. The staff did not, and just before leaving, they found the ring! Their service is absolutely exceptional, and their food is mouthwatering! Thanks Joe's for yet another unforgettable night of dining!"}
{"text":"My mom suggested going here tonight and although I was not really enthused, I went along for the ride.  My parents really like this place in general.  They come here pretty often.    The service was slow, which is odd because we got here before six p.m. on a Friday night and the place was pretty dead.  We did not leave until after 7:30 and we are fast eaters.    The service was also... annoying.  I'm not the type to like places where they dance or sing.  Beyond that annoyance... the server called me \"Sweetie\" and \"Sweetheart,' neither of which I welcomed or appreciated... especially coming from someone younger than me.  If she was in her sixties, maybe it would not have bothered me.  It just came off as condescending.  I know I look young, but stick to calling the kids \"Sweetie\" and not the adults.  THANK YOU.    As far as the food, the appetizer was good.  My stepdad liked his crab steampot.  My mom ordered my kiddo two kids' meals (that's another story) and my kiddo just ate her mac n' cheese (likely Kraft).  I had the fish and shrimp.  Fried shrimp, fried fish and fried... fries.   When my food arrived, it was just dropped without anyone asking if we needed anything else.  We did, but we figured the waitress would come back to ask us within a couple minutes.  I like to eat shrimp and fish with lemon and I needed ketchup for my fries.  I did not see the waitress for more than 10 minutes.  By the time she returned with my condiments, my food was cold.    The fish in my meal was just gross.  I ate one bite and could not eat any more of it.  The shrimp was fine.    The manager came by a couple times to check on us, but even seeing our empty glasses did not offer to get us refills.  We had waited for more than 15 minutes for drinks before our server refilled them.  My mom waited longer for her water refill.  In fact, the server forgot it twice.  I won't be coming here again unless my folks beg!  I typically can't stand eating at national chain restaurants and this one was no exception."}
{"text":"UPDATE:  Unfortunately the Southern location is now closed so this is our only option.  We came back, only 3 people this time, during the day, and received much better service."}
{"text":"Had the crab-stuffed shrimp with seasonal veggies (broccoli and carrots at the time) and dirty rice. It was okay. Not mind-blowing, not terrible. Also had the Shark Bite cocktail with Bacardi Limon Rum, Skyy Vodka, sweet and sour, blue curaçao and a touch of grenadine. The grenadine came on the side of the glass in a test tube with a little shark plastic figure. Cute.  Hubby had the Alaskan King Crab Legs with the Joe's Famous BBQ flavor. We both found it delicious. Hubby's grandma had either oysters or mussels, garlic flavored which she liked. Said it had a slight kick of spice to it.  Waiter was okay. Not overjoyed to be serving us, not entirely bummed out. Overall, an okay experience."}
{"text":"Nothing too memorable. Staff is nice, and the service is pretty good, but not anything different. They have some pretty cheap Patron Margaritas, which are nice for my inner lush. I haven't had anything from the menu that I've been a die hard fan of. Most of their corporate drinks are good, but extremely overpriced. I'll be back, but it's not a place I frequent."}
{"text":"We almost always visit the Joe's crab shack in Mission Beach California, but we live in Arizona and decided to give it a try. I have to say I'm disappointed in my king crab that I ordered, it looks nothing like the photos from the menu. It was the size of snow crab not king crab. A $90 lunch that was not worth the cost at all.  The s'mores dessert however was delightful and decadent. I was very pleased (so were my kids)!"}
{"text":"Location: the restaurant is big with lots and lots of tables. The restaurant is generally clean. This is definitely a great place to host a huge party.   Service: I've been here at least 10 times now and the service has always been consistently great! Every single time I am here (literally...every single time), the manager of the day will always stops by at least once to say hi and to make sure that everything is great for the customers.   Food: I always order the queen crab bucket with garlic Herb flavor. Crab legs have a decent amount of crab meat in it, but my only complain is that I cannot taste the garlic flavor much in the meat itself. Other than that, their seafood is always fresh and I've always enjoyed coming here. All buckets also comes with corn and potatoes, but you can substitute them with other side dishes if you like.   Rating: I will definitely come back here again. I love the fact that they have a huge roll of napkins for you to use - which is important to me since it is a bit messy eating seafood with hands lol."}
{"text":"I've tried this place a few times, that was my last time. The food is not good to me."}
{"text":"You will see that based on my reviews, I like seafood.   I am trying joes crabs shack again and I just finished one of their steam pots.   It should be called a s--- pot.    This and red lobster are the reasons some people dislike seafood.   Gobs of potatoes, some not even cut.    A few unpeeled \"medium\" shrimp on the bottom and a sausage.  I almost don't want seafood again.    The place is empty.   No disrespect to the people that work here other than management.  Speak up ....  maybe not."}
