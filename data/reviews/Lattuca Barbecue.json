{"text":"Their brisket and beef rib are pretty damn amazing ! Their beer has nothing special, we had to wait quite a bit before ordering, and had really no clear idea of the price we would be asked in the end since there were no written menu, but you instantly forget about it when you taste a bit of their brisket ! It is honestly the best meat I've ever eaten ; I won't forget it and definitely will come back ! It's worth noting however, that their prices are not so cheap as they used to be : the trinity which was 17$ is now 26, and since their beer is not cheap either, we ended up paying 45$ with tips and all."}
{"text":"Pour les vrai amateur de barbecue Lattuca est la seule place à Montréal j'ai voyager dans 47 états goûter aux meilleure resto bbq,mais à mon avis il est égal et même il meilleure que certains champion americain"}
{"text":"We went on a busy Saturday night when they said they are not sure they can take walk ins - hint make a reservation - after a bit of walking around we came back to check again and got a seat right away after they were certain they will have enough meat for the night. Clear sign that they do quality over quantity.   The food was amazing with a great atmosphere and service. What made the experience even better is our quick chat with John, the owner before closing who told us all about his process of getting meat each day for that night.   Next time I'm in the city I will defiantly be coming back!"}
{"text":"Wow! Best BBQ I've ever had! I had the resurrection, pulled pork, brisket, beef rib, pork rib, beans (you have to choose this side!) and cole slaw - everything was AMAZING, except cole slaw, boring, skip it. The meat is tender and has so much flavour! Here's the thing, I don't like smoked meats, I found myself with a group who wanted to try this place so I went along, I LOVED IT and you will too. Go!"}
{"text":"Was visiting from the Toronto area and I am glad I found out about this place via Chowhound.  Definitely one of the better BBQ spots I have had in Canada.  I wouldn't hesitate to go again and the owner and server were both really friendly.  It isn't a fancy spot, they have an open kitchen so you can see them cutting up the meat, preparing your meal.  I can see this place getting really busy on a nice summer's day but when I went they have everything available."}
{"text":"This is by far the best BBQ I ever had. Everything was incredibly good: the brisket, beef ribs, pulled pork, beans and coleslaw. The service was great. John Lattuca, the owner took the time to talk with us and explained us what he offers. The waitress made sure everything was good and everyone was very nice. Make sure to try this place for lunch or dinner. In my opinion, this is the place to go if you want proper BBQ. Montreal has finally found its Pitmaster."}
{"text":"We enjoyed fabulous BBQ, which was served by an efficient wait staff and an impressive pit master/owner. We recommend making reservations!!!"}
{"text":"Beyond some of the best barbecue I've had, the owner John is friendly, accommodating and wonderfully informative about his barbecue.   We had an assortment of the days barbecue and it's hard to decide what was best, for me the pork ribs were stand out. The coleslaw side was crisp and complemented the BBQ perfectly.  Even though we walked in late without a reservation - we we're still treated to the best meal we've had during our weekend in Montreal. I will be back every time we're in Montreal."}
{"text":"-understaffed -warm/dry food -dry noodles they call mac n' cheese -no ice -pre-cooked food -very few options -small portions -overpriced  I was very excited to try this place!  I saw the reviews and the photos on here.  Don't be fooled.  Save yourself the disappointment and go to  Blackstrap BBQ.  It is far superior in every way, especially the food."}
{"text":"Fantastic BBQ. Carefully prepared brisket and ribs that are so very tender. Great establishment and a friendly owner"}
{"text":"Amazingggg meats. The owner is the nicest person ever. Sides are also great! Everything is made daily."}
{"text":"Hands down the best BBQ I've had in Montreal. I've had a hard time finding something comparable to what I've had in the south and this place really hit the spot. John, the owner was very welcoming and really new his history.  His BBQ reflects different regions in the US and adds a Montreal twist. You immediately sense his passion for BBQ.  For those of you who love southern BBQ, this place is for you. No bells and whistles, just good ol' classic BBQ."}
{"text":"\"The early bird gets the worm\"  This rings so true for this diamond in the rough.  If you like BBQ you will love it after visiting this place."}
{"text":"You know a barbecue place will be bad when you walk in and can't even smell the barbecue.  This place is clearly not a restaurant!  1. There is no kitchen in this entire place. The food is all pre-made somewhere else and is sitting in heating bins under the bar, waiting to be served up to you. This is the reason they don't have fries or any other things that require last minute cooking, only luke-warm food probably violating many of Quebec's health food safety laws.  2. There is a shower in the bathroom, leading me to believe this is some illegal cafeteria conversion.  I don't know who showers in here, maybe this is a temporary pigsty which would explain...  3. The decor, layout and lighting are terrible. It feels like you are eating in a dark dark pigpen. Not only that, but the floors are messy and the chairs are very squeaky and close to the floor.  4. There are 3 people working this entire place: from the \"food preparation\" to the bar tending to the serving and the ordering. The staff is clearly overworked but also incompetent.  5. Even with reservations, It took them 10 minutes for them to even take our drink order, and another 20 minutes for us to ask ANOTHER server to even take our \"dinner order\". Not only that, but they told us they only \"take orders 6 at a time\" when the restaurant was full.  I feel bad for the pour souls who were still sipping on their 8 dollar bottles of local beer (!) when we left. I can't speak for the food, but I'm giving this place two stars because at least my soda wasn't flat. I hope you all get a visit from the health department soon.  Oh boy lattucca, more like lametucca because honestly you left me so, so disappointed."}
{"text":"Great food! The pork ribs and pulled pork were my favorites! They offered four choices the day we went. Go early or make a reservation."}
{"text":"AMAZING!! I got the Trinity (brisket, pork rib, pulled pork)- it was the most delicious BBQ I've ever tasted!! The meat was so flavorful, I barely used sauce. The owner and waitstaff were incredibly welcoming. It was fascinating to learn how he got his start in the world of BBQ. He is incredibly passionate about his work- it definitely shows in the flavor of his food!! Reservations strongly recommended."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible. I'll write my review point by point to get my message across :   1. The restaurant is clearly understaffed. 2 people in their so called \"kitchen\" and 1 waiter for roughly 50ish people just isn't enough and this clearly affects their service.   2. Let me delve into the definition of their \"so called\" kitchen : 3 oven-like food warmers where hunks of meats stay warm. The coleslaw they use is 100% store bought. How do I know? I know because it tastes identical to the \"Moishes\" coleslaw you buy from Costco. Oh and the Mac N Cheese is actually good. But too bad I only got 3 bites worth of it on my plate.  3. Value.. yea that doesn't exist at this restaurant. 28$ for a plate consisting of : 1 thin pork rib, 1 slice (thin) of brisket and some pulled pork with 3 bites worth of Mac N Cheese (No lie!! 3 bites) and 1 pickle SLICE! with store bought coleslaw.   4. The restaurant is known to run out of food and the waiter gladly warned us about this a week in advance to come early to avoid this happening. I assume that they prepare a certain quantity of food per day and if it runs out, well then they just stop taking people in. We arrive at 6:35pm and they are already running low on food... 35 minutes AFTER THEY OPENED FOR THE DAY... how could this be.   5. So how was the meat? The so called meat that people rant and rave about? It was good. It wasn't bad. That I can't say. Was it the best BBQ I've ever tasted... far from it.   All in all, this resto has to fix many things before I consider going back. I was actually looking forward to coming to the restaurant due to the high reviews, but it happens to be that the negative reviews were right this time.   -A disappointed customer."}
{"text":"Don't need to write much. If you enjoy BBQ, and actually know your BBQ, come here.   This is the real deal."}
{"text":"Oh so tasty. We had a large party if 12 and they gave us the sampling plate with beef ribs, pork ribs, brisket, and pulled pork. So much food most of us couldn't finish it but it was so tasty. I've had BBQ all over North America and this was definitely one of the better ones. Definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Was a quiet night, (Wednesday) BBQ sampler plate was great, baked beans side were fantastic. Great experience."}
{"text":"We found this place while walking through old Montreal.  Oh boy was it good.  Brisket sandwich was just the right amount of tenderness and sweetness.  We were in Texas earlier in the year and this is equal to what you get down there.  Mac & Cheese side is good - has a nice light and spicy kick to it.  Coupled with a cold beer - was just awesome."}
{"text":"Went to John's place Saturday night. The man lives and breathes bbq. The food was excellent, wait staff very attentive. I'm from Jersey which is a good thing, otherwise I would be there once a week.can't wait till next time."}
{"text":"The food was okay (not worth the high price, IMO), but the service was so incredibly slow. Also, I'm not sure what this establishment is supposed to be. It is certainly unique in that there is no kitchen, the food is kept in these containers, and there's no menu in the restaurant or on the website to see the prices beforehand so that you know what you're getting yourself into. I see the effort, but wish I didn't waste my time."}
{"text":"Delicious!  Had the Trinity and enjoyed every bite!  Brisket worthy of a world championship!"}
{"text":"We went here for dinner on a weekend trip to Montreal. We had the brisket and it was fantastic... Highly recommended! An excellent and unexpected Texan-style barbecue find in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Calling y'all fellow Texans and Barbecue lovers. If you find yourself needing a barbecue fix in Montreal, Quebec (yeah I said Montreal Canada) then Lattuca Barbecue is the place to go.  Being a fellow Texan I won't be ashamed recommending the place to my family and friends.  Owner/Chef John Lattuca is spreading the barbecue philosophy to Montreal.  Definitely try the three meat combo.  It's all about the beef at Lattuca Barbecue."}
{"text":"This place is the best of the best! Definitely the best BBQ in Montreal and the best service. John the owner took great care of us. We were the only patrons in the restaurant so we got extra special care. John has such an interesting story to tell and is a BBQ mastermind. We all had the trinity and the sides are the perfect addition. We live in NY but we will most certainly be back for the BBQ. Thanks John!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing barbecue.  I've planned road trips and family vacations around where I can get mouthwatering barbecue.  I've been to Austin, Kansas city, St. Louis, and Memphis and Lattucas is as good as any of them.  The beans are the best I've ever eaten.  I always get the 3 meat plate to see what meat a joint can do best.  Usually only one or two meats shine but the Montreal trinity of a beef rib, pork rib, and brisket was spectacular across the board.  I tried the sauce just to try it but the meat is best left to shine on its own.  If you like BBQ or meat in general you need to eat here.  I will be coming back to Montreal just to eat here again."}
{"text":"Terrific BBQ place near the river. I was in the mood but the last thing I thought I would find in Montreal is a chef who knows how to do BBQ right. Brisket, pulled pork were great, but the beef ribs were exceptional. Friendly place, too!"}
{"text":"Questo bellissimo ristorante scoperto grazie a Yelp  è stato una bellissima  sorpresa. Il locale è molto informale che è la cosa ideale se si vuole trascorrere una serata in compagnia di amici. Dietro consiglio della cameriera abbiamo bevuto un ottimo vino rosso importato dall'Italia, il Milleuve. La loro birra è anche molto buona e rinfrescante. Il cibo ha superato di gran lunga le nostre più rosee aspettative. Da un locale che si pregia del titolo di \"Brisquet Champion Of the world\" (campione mondiale di brisquet) ci aspettavamo un buon pasto. Quello che abbiamo ricevuto è stata un'accoglienza in stile famiglia da parte di Gianni Lattuca e una qualità indescrivibile.  Il loro brisquet si scioglieva in bocca tanto era tenero. Le costole erano divine.  Viaggio spesso per lavoro in tutto il mondo e sono stata diverse volte in Texas ma la qualità della carne di Lattuca supera il miglior ristorante texano che ho visitato finora.  I prezzi variano dai 22 ai 26 dollari e le porzioni non sono abbondanti ma giuste."}
{"text":"Start off with the great . Beef rib , brisket and pork ribs couldn't have been tastier . Owner John Lattuca and the two waitresses couldn't have been nicer . Great people . But... It is run like it was just opened by a first time restaurateur . Portion sizes varied greatly between the 4 of us , they gave us tiny portions of cole slaw explaining the had run out and were making more , no BBQ sauce was offered and we had to practically demand it (it was fantastic) , our reserved table was taken and they had to kick out what appeared to be friends from \"our\" spot , had to ask twice for water which was served in our empty beer glasses and finally no desserts offered at all .   Am I being picky ? No . Frankly 4 stars is generous but the staff are so nice and the meat is so good , what the hell . By the way they are only opened 4 days a week . Owner hopes to open more days this summer , expand the menu and a bunch of other stuff. We shall see. I've seen lots of well intentioned places like this fail ."}
{"text":"I'm a Texas boy that smokes meat all the time. The food here really impressed me. Great job."}
{"text":"Although we arrived without a reservation (first sign of a popular place), we were greeted warmly and told that we could sit anywhere we could find an open table. Unfortunately the draft beer taps were broken, but with a bottle of beer, a glass of white wine and a pitcher of water we anxiously awaited the arrival of our award winning beef brisket! We were very hungry while we waited which only added to the excitement. Once the food arrived, we began what I can only describe as the dance of the BBQ! The Kansas City Pit beans were to DIE for!! I am not a bean fan. Baked beans are about as exciting to me as watching paint dry. These beans were tremendous!! On to the foot+ long beef rib and brisket I had... they were smoked to perfection and tasted fantastic. We hold all BBQ places to pretty high standards as our \"home\" BBQ joint is the Dinosaur BBQ in Syracuse, NY. this place ranked right up there!! As they grow and mature as a business, they will become harder and harder to get into. I'm sure of it.  My only suggestion to them would be to offer a couple of different sauces. If you're not into the one that they offer, your stuck eating fantastic BBQ without sauce. So not a bad place to be!! Thank you for the great meal on our impromptu 10th anniversary dinner. You made the night!!"}
{"text":"I think we may have come in at the worst possible time. In any case, it was clear that the owner was not prepared for a night of big business. He was also NOT friendly at all. To break things down:  1 - this was a bad weekend to come in (there was apparently a Grand Prix? We didn't know about it). The restaurant was packed by 6pm. Our fault for not making a reservation because it was obvious that whatever popular meat was left was saved for those that did. We even overheard the owner talking to his \"reserved\" guests about all the meats he had after we were told there was only one meat option available.   2 - this place was understaffed tremendously. The owner clearly looked upset that we walked in (our mistake for not reading Yelp) and he seemed so peeved to take our order. He also didn't want to talk to us as much as his customers that made reservations. Why? We were paying customers like everyone else. The waitress asked if we talked to the owner at all before he left. We complimented him on his food and he didn't even thank us! The waitress felt bad and said \"sorry about that, his brain is fried\". Not an excuse for terrible behavior.   3 - food was decent (not as good as American BBQ). Can't believe it took about 30-35 mins to receive it though. At one point, they thought we had eaten already since we were just sitting there. Nope. It would also be nice if there was something that listed the price in writing when you come in. There is no menu, rather, you are told the price from the wait staff.    To summarize, we felt we were treated as more inferior to customers that made reservations since we walked in. The wait staff were actually very friendly, but the owner was unnecessarily rude and picky about who he wanted to talk to and take compliments from. Why even bother having a restaurant if you can't treat ALL of your guests with respect?"}
{"text":"We went to Montreal for the weekend, a bit of a getaway for the wife's birthday.  She chose one dinner restaurant, I chose the other.  This one was my pick.  I had the pulled pork and the brisket, with mac and cheese and cole slaw.  She had pulled pork and the beef ribs, with the baked beans and mac and cheese.  All were excellent.  The brisket was the best I've ever had.  It was perfect.  I cook a mean brisket myself, and my measuring stick when I go to BBQ places is, \"Is mine better?\"  In this case, I wasn't even close.  The pulled pork came in second.  A huge portion, great flavor.  The beef rib tied for second.  :)  Awesome texture, good smoke flavor.  My previous experience with smoked beef ribs was not positive - this has changed my mind and has opened my imagination as to how good they can be.  The side dishes were excellent, as well.  The baked beans were especially good - a mix of beans, with a bit of a kick on the back end.  Drool-worthy.  The cole slaw was vinegar style, not mayo - and very good.  The mac and cheese was done properly - no coagulated curdled cheese!  The proprietor came around, and asked how our meal was - very friendly, very attentive.  If I lived within 50 miles of this place, I'd go weekly."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying \"John has ruined me for BBQ!  He has set the bar extremely high!  This was an unexpected find on our weekend away to Montreal while walking along the port.  Coming from Southern Ontario, we don't have an abundance of bbq places by any means, and really none worth noting that I've found.  I've never had BBQ this good, and it saddens me that I may not again until I get back there for a return visit.  The mouth watering Brisket, the tangy coleslaw, and the smokey campfire baked beans warms your soul.  My wife who doesn't care for the beans absolutely loved them as well.  In a post conversation with John you can tell he loves his cooking and he puts an enormous amount of effort and knowledge into preparing the menu.  He's also just a nice guy to talk to and we both enjoyed our time at his restaurant.  Thanks John :)  I always say, if your going out to eat food prepared by someone else it should knock your socks off, and John does not fail to deliver.  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Incredible BBQ. Best pulled pork, brisket, and beef ribs I've ever had. The BBQ sauce is unique and amazing. Will make this a stop every time I come back to Montreal."}
{"text":"Easily the best ribs in Montreal !!! Their brisket and beef ribs are amazing as well but the pork ribs are incredible !!!"}
{"text":"Making reservations at least a day or two ahead is ALWAYS better.   Since they do limited-batch barbeque, it's first come first serve -- want to come reallly late at night, then you risk them running out of meat -- in which case, if you talk to the boss-person (he's always in the front) you can *maybe* get a special plate made.  --- just don't ask for special exceptions when they're super busy! (which I suppose is just common sense in general)  Big selection of bottle beers, including Beau's (organic) and Glutenberg."}
{"text":"On mange dans son plateau mais on est bien au restaurant! Le principe est particulier mais si l'on veut manger de la viande on est au bon endroit. On se vante de la meilleure \"brisket\" mais je pense que la réalité est toute proche. Un bon repas avec une bonne bière locale (un grand choix à votre disposition en pression ou bouteilles). On choisit une version 1, 2 ,3 ou 4 viandes pour les plus gourmands ou ogres... Accompagnements très sympa notamment les beans qui se marient bien avec cette viande. Personnellement, la version deux viandes m'a conquise. Un coup de coeur pour ce resto."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best bbq I have ever eaten... the owners and cooks are extremely enthusiastic and passionate about what they cook"}
{"text":"Service was poor, we had a reservation and because of a big group it took 20 mins before having water and 1h to have our plates. I had to ask refeel of water twice. Food was good, not the best BBq place in Montreal... and seriously... 1 pork rib, like really 1 lol"}
{"text":"This place is awesome but TINY! Reservations would be very much recommended. Great location right by the old pier. Very small staff trying to do the best they can and are super friendly and helpful. We were the 2nd bachelor party in one night for them and they did an awesome job in trying to accommodate us when they were already swamped.   Food is amazing and I could hardly believe I was in Montreal when I was gnawing on the beef rib they had. Pork was super tender as well and sauce was just the right balance of spicy and sweet. Honestly the brisket and beef rib stands up to some of the best I've had in the South, Texas included!"}
{"text":"Texas-style BBQ in Montreal! The brisket was better than what I've had in Texas, which is excellent. Melts in your mouth. The beef rib was amazing too! John said it was a 9 hour smoke. The focus here is really the meat. There were just 3 tasty sides. Sorry vegetarians, this place is not for you.  Call ahead and get a reservation. The place is cozy and open only part of the week. The owner/pitmaster, John, is super cool and very friendly so ask him about BBQ. It's his passion."}
{"text":"I went to Austin in August for a brisket trip and having done that I can confidently say this place is equal with greats. The brisket was tender and buttery and not overly smoked. The bark had the right amount of crunch and saltiness. Most pulled pork relies on a vinegar sauce for flavor. This had a smoked sweet depth of flavor I have rarely experienced. But the true winner was the beef rib. Tender, smokey, and with an incredible bark.  John Lattuca was a gracious host and it is clear he takes great pride in his craft. Finding this place was a happy accident but I will definitely come back when I'm up in Montreal again."}
{"text":"This place serves THE BEST ribs and brisket. Period. The owner is super nice and hospitable. The meat was smoked slowly for 12 hours to perfection. The place was homey and cozy. This place is a hidden gem."}
{"text":"The best was tasty but the meal lacked adequate side dishes.  The brisket had too much fat."}
{"text":"I rarely give 5 stars... But this place deserves them all. The chef and owner John his behind the bar/counter when you enter, giving love and cutting his meat for the night. He explained to us last night that unfortunately, (for the resto but not for us :P) due to the weather many people canceled their reservation for Valentine's Day, and since he smokes just the day before, and only the quantity required based on reservations, he had too much meat. Thus, we had incredibly generous portions, and the chef even passed at our table to offer more ribs. How awesome is that? Lattuca maintains a very strict high quality standard and you can be assured that the what will be served in your plate is the tenderest, juiciest, and most savoury Southern-style barbequed meat ever. Smoked the day before during 14 hours (the waitress explained that 14 hrs is for the brisket, not sure if its the same for their ribs...), and served the next day only. Will be be back."}
{"text":"My friends and I came here on a whim on the weekend while we were in Montreal because the other restaurant we wanted to go to was closed for renovations, but this was a great second choice in the area. Situated right by the St. Lawrence River, I imagine this is a great spot in the summertime when they open the patio. It's a grill/barbecue house, where the chef has won world-championships on his braising of beef brisket, his pork ribs, and his tenderous pulled pork. Although the pricing was on the more expensive side (starts at $27 a person, plus $2 per additional meat), and hurt my wallet a little (help), the taste is amazing and the portions are generous. Even between my friend and I's hungry boyfriends, they were getting full from the portions... That's how generous it is! Definitely get the pork ribs - super flavourful and meat falls right off the bone - and the beef brisket, that's what they are known for. If you know your BBQ or love ribs, this is the real deal. Try it for a premium rib/meat lovers'/BBQ lovers' experience."}
{"text":"Real barbeque in Montreal..... Who thought?!? It was right on with all the flavors. The sides were great too. We had the resurrection (all four menu choices) and it was very filling!!! Between my husband and myself we also had all the sides. The menu isn't extensive but each item is delicious - sides and main dishes. I'd much rather a limited  menu done really great than a large menu done mediocre. And John, the chef/chief smoker/owner, knows his stuff and we found his passion to be contagious!! Keep smokin' John!!"}
{"text":"OK:  So I am from Brooklyn, not exactly the home of BBQ, but I know a thing or two.  This place is amazing.  I was in Montreal for a few days and my daughter was begging for BBQ.  For whatever reason on this night they were only taking cash.  No problem at all as the owner pointed me to the nearest ATM.  They were unbelievably sad that they make me go out.  Didn't bother me at all.  I was promised a killer plate as payment.  Boy did they not disappoint.  Onward to the actual food:  I got the trinity.  It had brisket, pork ribs and a monster beef rib.  No sauce required.  It was so good I really don't know where to begin.  My favorite was the brisket.  My jewish grandmother never made anything quite like that.  Holy cow was it good.  Daughter filled up on the pork rib / beef rib combo.  She devoured it whole!  Net net...Go!  If you are lucky enough to be wandering around the old port of Montreal, don't even think twice.  There is always some other day for poutine.   Lattuca can't wait!"}
{"text":"Delicious bbq in Old Montreal. Friendly staff and great owner. We had a nice chat and you can see the passion he puts into his food. I had the pork spare ribs with Mac and cheese and coleslaw as sides. Spare ribs were nice and tender with an excellent bbq sauce. The Mac and cheese hit the spot. Nice vibe and location. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Weird concept place. Its slow cooked meat and when its gone they close the restaurant. Its a new place as well so there are some kinks in their service but the atmosphere was cool. We happened to go in without reservations and they had just seated a party of 12 so the service was really slow and we had to wait about an hour to get served and fed. But it was worth it. my gilrfriend and I both had two meats and two sides. there are four meats to choose from, pork and beef ribs, beef brisket and pulled pork. The pork rib and the beef brisket were by far the best with the sauce on the pork ribs really shining for us. The sides were mac and cheese coleslaw and baked beans all of which were awesome although were really small and left us slightly unsatisfied. Would go again this time making reservations, and probably getting more meats. More expensive than expected but the service atmosphere and quality of the food was worth it."}
{"text":"Best bbq in the city and in many US states I've had the pleasure of eating southern comfort food.   The brisket is melt-in-your-mouth tender. It's the highlight of the menu considering everything else is also excellent.   The beef ribs are huge! The bark has the right amount of saltiness and crunch.  The pork ribs and pulled-pork are very tender and fall-off-the-bone. They have just the right amount of sweetness if you like more of a dry-rub style BBQ.  The sides are good, but not the stars of the show. Although, the baked beans was excellent with smokey bits of bacon and brown sugar.  The staff is also very friendly and the owner is very passionate about his BBQ!"}
{"text":"Huge portions  The meat is excellent - we had the brisket and it was amazing   Great for kids too- we've taken them here twice and they love it   We also found the staff to be terrific as well"}
{"text":"I came here tonight with a group of six people. We made a reservation for 5pm and the chef only got there at 6pm. On top of that we had to wait 45 minutes for our orders. The servers were unprofessional and got the orders wrong. The sides are too small and there aren't too many options. The BBQ once you actually receive it is ok, but go to Blackstrap BBQ in Wellington instead -- superior service and they have mac and cheese cubes."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! Latucca Barbecue saved us on a cold and snowy Sunday night, with a warm atmosphere and the best brisket, ribs, and mac & cheese in Montreal. The secret recipe baked beans topped it all off.   The menu is flexible based on the supplies and what passes Latucca's high quality standards, rendering everything on the ever-changing menu delicious.   The craft beer selection coupled with the rack of bourbon bottles made our experience at Latucca Barbecue one of our best restaurant experiences in Montreal, and of course, the entire staff is hospitable, friendly, and great story-tellers. If you want a solid go-to spot, Latucca is it!"}
{"text":"This was a great find since our time here in old Montreal. The man manning the 'pit' takes pride in his work like a mother to her child. We tried the \"Trinity\" plates and immediately set up our reservation for the next day!       I prefer the 'fall off the bone' pork ribs, because that's my BBQ meat of choice ( enjoy the 'cream' aka the fat that you would occasionally spit out at other BBQ places ).        And the service is 5 's. They were attentive, but not hovering."}
{"text":"Whaaaat! It was that good!  So this place is the real deal!!!! Simple menu; 4 meats but done proper!!! Portions are deceivingly large. Brisket and beef rib are Divine!"}
{"text":"In Montreal for the evening from NYC. Walked in at the end of the evening and was greeted by the pitmaster John!  I want to say I haven't been treated this well in sometime and the food was so amazing and authentic Texas barbecue! I can't say enough about how great everything was. I would make the 6 hour drive from New York just to eat his amazing food. Thank you John for working so hard to make such a great product."}
{"text":"Review the comments I provided upon checking in. Eat here if you want outstanding barbeque; you will not be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"This was such a fantastic experience all around! We walked in and were greeted with the smokey smell of bbq'd meat throughout the restaurant, amazing! The atmosphere was casual and inviting and we easily found a table with a great view of their larger beer selection. The options are simple- 1, 2,3, or 4 meats with 2 or 3 sides, but don't let the lack of options get you down because everything was phenomenal! The meats were fall off the bone, cut with a fork, tender and the flavors were powerful. The sides were a good portion and compliment to the meat. It was a bit pricey but in the end worth it. Will definitely return during our next visit."}
{"text":"been there 3 times and counting, honestly everything just tastes SO GOOD especially the brisket&the ribs. Beers are also worth a try  The only thing is u gotta call before u go to make sure they're not sold out/fully packed for the day. There's one time my friends and I took a 15min Uber&got there before 10:20 (it closes at 11) just to find out they are sold out already.. literally tears coming off-_-"}
{"text":"Was in Montreal for work with coworkers and Lattuca was reccomend to us to try. This is barbecue at its finest where the meats are only  highlighted with salt and pepper( no sauce) and smoked to perfection.  John the owner was an amazing host and is a master of his craft.  I have had BBQ from all over the United States and his is at the top of my list.  This is a must if you are visiting old montreal.   Will definatly be back."}
{"text":"So I finally get to sit down and right this review almost a month after I visited Lattuca. My experience here was pretty good considering I had a large group of 12 and all of them very demanding (you can't choose your family) and few of them used to attending a place that doesn't have menus since they are older. The waitress we had was on her first night of work and answering our questions really seemed to overwhelm her and when we got our orders confused it started to frustrate us as well. However the owner-who is more than hands on at his establishment- swooped in and helped to sort things out even with an packed house. While I'd give the service here a C+ for their attitude and disorganization (because with a packed house it's even more important to maintain your composure-they didn't.), the food itself is well worth the trip. Don't go here expecting the frills and attention of a 4 or 5 star but come hungry for some kickass BBQ."}
{"text":"This is a great place!  We called a day ahead to set up a feast for a large group.  We had pulled pork, Brisket, chicken and monster beef ribs. All of the meat was perfectly done as well as the sides of beans, slaw and mac & cheese.  The staff at Lattuca is outstanding and it is obvious they take pride in producing a great meal."}
{"text":"A perfect place for carnivores.   Good =b : the employees are very kind and speak both of French and English fluently.  Good quality of meet. I and my husband had three different kinds of meet - beef ribs, beef brisket and chicken. I recommend beef ribs and chicken. They are decently juicy and tasty. But the beef brisket was too lean and tasted a bit dry to me. Which can be good for who's on a protein diet. :)  Bad =p : Why only 4 stars then? The bill was $74 for two. We had two meals and a beer. A bit pricy for us expecting just a casual dinner."}
{"text":"Tres manufique, BBQ that does not need sauce.  This joint is meat church.  We had 4 way, brisket, pulled pork, pork ribs and a giant beef rib.  These meats are so well cooked that they do not need sauce.  John must be a meat whisperer, he extracts all the flavor that is available in the meats.  Everything was fanflipingtastic!  Beef ribs almost always end up a little dry and chewy.  Somehow these beef ribs were so tender after the meat slipped away from the bone I could gently cut across the grain with my fork (never even looked at the knife) and the depth of flavor was like there was no bone between the marrow and the meat.  Shredded coleslaw, excellent.  Mac n cheese, wanted more.  The beans, damnnn how does he do it??   Large selection of beers and ales, what more did we need?  Nothing, absolutely nothing.  I wish we had this restaurant in the Bay Area.  Make your reservation, get there early, you do not want to miss out.  When the meat is gone it's gone."}
{"text":"Yummy yummy to my tummy.... Pulled pork sandwiches excellent mac and cheese is good quality last night's vinegar-based not Mayo based.  Very simple menu very simple choices for drinks beer, wine, water....but everything is perfection"}
{"text":"This place is a must visit if you love BBQ!  All the presentations of pork and beef are excellent.  Staff here is great as well."}
{"text":"Really fantastic barbecue (and that's coming from someone who lived in Texas for 7 years, and is married to a KC barbecue snob). The brisket was delicious - perfectly smoked, with creamy fat and great flavor. The pulled pork was also excellent - nicely flavored, and still juicy. The Mac &a cheese was tasty, but I liked the coleslaw best. It's a vinegar based slaw, so it's a perfect counterpoint to the barbecue. If you're in Montreal, you'll be missing out if you don't come here."}
{"text":"Best BBQ I've had in Montreal. No sauce needed the meat is super tender and flavorful."}
{"text":"Authentic BBQ paired with great service in a trendy location.  I would recommend the pulled pork and beef brisket.  The owner and pitmaster John is truly enchanted with sharing his love for real, authentic, reasonably priced and delicious BBQ in old montreal."}
{"text":"I've had bbq in the us south  and Texas. This place competes very well with both! Try the beans , sweet and slightly spicy. The portions are a bit small for \"bbq\"; not for big appetites. However, if you like BBQ, this is the place!"}
{"text":"Pour être court: si la quantité était égale à la qualité... j'aurais mis 4 étoiles.  Bouffe Qualité = très bien. Un peu déçu par le Brisket, trop sec à mon goût. Par contre mon Dieu la côte de boeuf !!!! fondant, juteux, succulent !!! Pareil pour les pork ribs. Belle sélection de bières bouteilles (essayer la Kissmeyer Nordic Pale Ale). Dommage qu'ils n'aient que 2 bières en pression.  Bouffe Quantité = pas top !!!! C'est de la bouffe de gars !!! et un homme c'a prend plus qu'une tranche de brisket, 1 pork rib et 1 beef rib !!! Lorsque tu vas aux US et que tu payes 30$ dans un smokehouse.... tu sors en ayant pris 2 tailles ! Ici tu reste sur ta faim.  Service: très bien aussi  Sérieux les gars.... faites des portions sérieuses ! Çà gâche l'expérience."}
{"text":"First BBQ experience in MTL. Let me tell you this first off. The food was absolutely to die for. I order the brisket, pork ribs, side of Mac and cheese and the baked beans.   Single handedly one of the best BBQ experiences I've ever had. Flavour, texture, appearance. All good.   To be honest, I think we were there on a rough night. Keg was tapped, no beer on draught, and was taking a while to get out food.   The food looked and tasted amazing. The service was excellent.   Unfortunately, the prices didn't add up. Firstly their menu is stupidly confusing. It's posted right outside their door, but if you ask them for a menu inside, they don't got one.   Secondly, it's important to note that you have the option of ordering a second meat for a $2 upcharge. The problem with this is that they reduce your initial meat.   In fact I got more secondary meat than I did primary. So you're basically more for less.   The owner though is top notch nice guy who has a great personality, is friendly, checks in on you and most importantly is a pit boss.   Good is great. Prices are too high."}
{"text":"An absolute must if you love BBQ and are in Montreal. Ordered the beef rib, pork rib, brisket and pulled pork with sides of Mac n cheese and beans. Hands down one of the best BBQ I've tasted. Large portions, great owner and staff and a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"After weeks of reading the reviews about Lattuca BBQ I just couldn't help myself and needed to try it myself. So the good the bad and the ugly. We all had the tray with 4 meats and 2 sides. The brisket and pulled pork by far the best I ever had. So moist and tender and served the way BBQ should be served with no sauce!  The pork ribs also money. Fall off the bone. The beef rib well the best way to describe it is , bark candy. A full dark rim of smoke that will knock your taste buds into a new dimension. As for the sides we liked the beans best. The coleslaw and macaroni and cheese are ok but not great. That's the good part the bad part, well the bad part is your sad because there is not enough food on the tray. I would of liked more especially the brisket and pulled pork. As for the ugly part it's not their fault but the parking is horrible. But overall If your in the neighbourhood don't hesitate one second to try it you will go home happy happy!"}
{"text":"Where do I start..... amazing BBQ, John is the man no wonder he won the Jack Daniel's world championship in 2012 . The real deal !!! You won't be disappointed. Bring him your empty stomach:)"}
{"text":"I like this place a lot. Flavourful and tender BBQ with beans make me feel very good on a winter night. They have pulled pork, beef ribs, pork ribs and brisket. This shop won some competition with their brisket but they were all sold out the night we were there.  My favourite was the pork ribs. The pulled pork was a bit dry. Their BBQ sauce was pretty awesome as well, very different than the store bought ones for sure.  For less than $30, you get three choices of meat and 2 choices of sides.  This will be my go to place when I feel like trying out some ribs."}
{"text":"Located right on the old port. They have an oral menu here, which consists of four options: pulled pork, pork ribs, beef ribs, and/or beef brisket. You can choose to do 1 or all 4, and the portion sizes will be adjusted. Also comes with 2 sides (choose from beans, mac and cheese, and cole slaw).   The meats: some of the best BBQ I've ever had. The brisket is probably hands down the best brisket - so amazingly tender with just the right amount of fat. The pork ribs were of thick and generous portions.  Didn't initially plan on visiting a BBQ spot in Montreal, but I definitely have no regrets."}
{"text":"Unbelievable BBQ--probably the best I've ever had. The single meat portion was plenty but if you feel like you want to try a variety, go for more. I had the ribs and my boyfriend had the brisket and both were unbelievably amazing."}
{"text":"Pitmaster, Mr John Lattuca, is passionate about his BBQ.  He understands the science behind smoking and serving the perfect meat.  Some of his meats are smoked for up to 16 hours (always reserve minimum 24h prior to avoid missing out on some of his expertly prepared dishes).  For my first time, I tried the Trinity, a generous tray of 3 meats (pork rib, beef rib and brisket) and 2 sides (I took mac&cheese and Kansas style beans)... This is the best plate for first timers as you get to try most of the meats.  The beef rib was prepared with a perfect blend of dry rub, without any fancy sauces to mask the flavors of the meat... It was delicious!  The brisket, the golden meat, is unlike anything I ever had, extremely fatty, but incredibly flavorful, tender and juicy.  Although the meats are the highlight, the side dishes do a fantastic job at honoring them.  Both the Mac N Cheese and the Kansas style beans had me wanting more.  If you're in Montreal, heck, if you're anywhere outside of Texas, this is the best place for some meat, smoked southern style.  Montreal finally has a real smoke house!  I'll be coming back for more.  Next time, I'll be trying your pulled pork..."}
{"text":"Very delicious food, beef ribs, pork ribs, pulled pork, and brisket to die for!  Small place with a good beer/spirits selection.  Friendly staff, but limited amount of people working, two wait staff members for the restaurant."}
{"text":"Good restaurant, one of the few of its kind in Montreal. There are no menus as the kitchen gives you the choice between 4 kinds of meat and 3 kinds of sides. Foods come fast as it's prepared the night before by the pit master. However since everything is prepared the same day, they might run out of some options, in my case I initially went for the brisket but they were out of it. I would recommend this place"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, lovely people. Not expensive, yet great food. More than worth it! Initially the plate may seem like not much, but boy, I couldn't even finish it. Awesome!"}
{"text":"We have all four, the brisket, pulled pork, pork rid and beef rib. Pulled pork and brisket are the best, but unfortunately they come at the smallest serving size. The beef rib is huge but not as good as them(maybe because it's not fatty so the taste is a bit dry) although it's still delicious. The bill is 44$ plus tax and tip. I think the food worth it."}
{"text":"I'm always on the lookout for  smokey BBQ goodness. And finally I went to Lattuca in Old Montréal. My expectations were both surpassed and unmet at the same time. What's in the box is more important than the box. Function over form... but form still matters. And I'll start with form.  The restaurant itself is rather, shall we say Spartan not to say unfinished-looking. It feels like the owner took the prime location (La Commune) on the old port, stripped it, painted the walls, forgot to put in a ceiling and barely slapped anything on the walls. The décor is cold and somewhat sterile and almost void of decoration. I mean there's a shower in the lavatory. The tables seem leftovers from a bar, the seating comprised of tiny little plastic chairs. It was underwhelming. I expected some more creature comfort, better décor.   Even the food presentation could have used a kick in the balls. I know he's going for authenticity - traditional BBQ joints in Texas serve the food on paper lined tray. Which is fine, but this is Montréal, we take it up a notch. A nice wood board, for the meats and room for quarter-mason jars for the sides or mini cast-iron skillets or something, anything.   Thus endeth the bitching.  Because what was on the tray was way out there in both flavor and smokey goodness. I had the \"Resurrection\" platter or as I like to call it, the \"gimme everything you got\" platter. This means Beef Rib, Pork Rib, Pulled Pork, Brisket, Beans, Mac n' Cheese, and Slaw. To give you an idea of how mind-blowingly delicious the plate was. The restaurant doesn't place salt, pepper or BBQ sauce on the table. What you get is what you eat and NOTHING needs to be added to it. Nothing needs to be removed as well. It was all near-perfect.   My only kvetch was that the beef rib may have been a tiny bit on the dry side, but when you eat it with a bit of fat or caramel tasting bean \"sauce\" it's freakin' awesome. The brisket has just the perfect amount of back fat on it, the pulled pork... wow what a perfectly delicious and moist pork, the perfect amount of seasoning. I could imagine its taste on a toasted and buttered bun topped with that delicious vinegary crunchy slaw. The pork ribs were perfectly smoked, tender and tasted like goddamn candy is what it was. I could have eaten a bucket of those ribs. The mac was cheesy and well-seasoned. Can't complain about the food, it was far above my expectations, except for one part. No desert? We had to go to Laptopistan  (Second Cup) for that and coffee.  I went there with my girlfriend for my birthday expecting a restaurant experience. Unfortunately this restaurant doesn't work that way. You order and quickly get served your food quite rapidly and head on out. Not a place to linger.  The service was great, warm and accommodating. The owner was one cool dude that obviously loves his craft and to explain his process. I would definitely go back from the awesome smoked meats. Many BBQ joints have come and gone in Montréal in this new BBQ madness and some deserved to perish but this one, I hope it sticks around. Authentic BBQ while strolling around in Old Montreal's Old Port? Hell Yeah!  For all my biching, I'm still giving it a 4 outta 5 because DAMN GOOD SMOKEHOUSE."}
{"text":"This was coooool. We had 2 plates of 2 meats each (in order to try them all - you have to set yourself ambitious goals in life.) We finished them up in 40 minutes, then we rolled back to our place and were happy for the rest of the day.   I loooved the beef brisket - everythink was super, super delicious, but I think it was my favorite. There were no Mac & Cheese when we went, just coleslaw and beans - both were good. Just be aware that beans (like pulled pork, and like the other meats too actually) are super sugary, due to the barbecue sauce. If you are not used to it, it can be surprising."}
{"text":"If you are looking for the real deal in bar-b-que, this has to be it. Authentic southern meats--beef and pork ribs, brisket like you can't get anywhere else in Canada. John is an incredible host, and serves up the best meal you'll find in you're hankering for meat. (Go for the resurrection--you'll be glad you did. Easy to see why he's a Jack Daniels World champion pitmaster.)"}
{"text":"Great BBQ!!  The beef ribs and brisket were outstanding. Very laid back atmosphere. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Really amazing but the prices are no joke! We weren't warned or given a menu and had to pay $70 for 2 meals!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of BBQ, so I was so happy to finally try this place. The menu isn't very big but they execute there BBQ to a T. We were a group of 4. So we took everything on the menu. Beef ribs were my absolute favourite. Looked like it came from a dinosaur it was that big.  There menu ranges from ribs to pulled pork to there championship brisket. It's very tasty the bark on the meat is delicious. Take the bbq beans as a side. I am not kidding when I say they were the best beans I ever had. Period   Would definitely come back. The pitmaster, I think his name is John, know what he's doing! Wow  The only issue I had was the decor wasn't that fancy but then again it is BBQ, and took a while for us to get refills on our water and the sides are a little small"}
{"text":"I'm not a meat eater , but OMG this is changing from now on ! His meat is the best meat I've ever had !!! By far the best piece of meat in town !!the brisket is to die for !! Try the mac and cheese and the coleslaw ! Yum !!!!we needed this in montreal !! Finally !! So happy :)"}
{"text":"Amazing BBQ that only time and love can make. John really showed us hospitality coming from California and the portions were huuuuge! I'd opt for the combination plate to try all the meat he has to offer! Pretty damn good meat, I say, pretty damn good. :)"}
{"text":"Poor service. Poor selection. Sat down... had to walk to a waitress for service. There were only 3 tables total... but I had to inform the waitress we needed menus. Ask for a beer and a water... never received. Waitress tells us they only have braised beef (dry) and the only sides left for the night were cole slaw and Mac n cheese.... sure. We'll take it. Someone comes over later and gives us braided beef and bread... \"oh we're out of everything. Beers on the house, what do you want\"  Order beer again. Never got it...  Ate. Demanded I only paid for 1 meal. And left."}
{"text":"I'm an American with 40+ years of eating BBQ, and several years of preparing and pitting BBQ  commercially for offshore oil field workers off Texas and Louisiana  This is extremely legitimate BBQ, and though the style is unique if compared to American regional styles, it absolutely works. This is \"salt/pepper/smoke\" BBQ, and the meat itself is the star.  The meat is extremely well prepared, with a light smoke and light bark. It's drop-off the bone tender, with a fully developed flavor, and the moisture /salt/smoke/texture is literally perfect.  I had the \"Resurrection\", so that I could sample everything, and the meats, beans, mac&cheese, and slaw are really absolutely spot-on perfect.   I chatted with the owner a bit as he was assembling my order, and he seems like a nice guy, and his crew were all friendly and knowledgeable.  The space itself is very nicely done, and very comfortable.  Portions are generous and prices are quite reasonable.   Really a very pleasant surprise, and absolutely top notch all around!  I'll make it a point to stop in the next time I'm in town!!  Oh and a note: This type of meat takes HOURS to prepare ... If you just walk in without having made a reservation the previous day, or come later in the day, they very well might be sold out of a particular meat. So no griping!"}
{"text":"The meal started off well with a nice beef rib.  Good taste and base seasoning.  Pork rib had very little taste, brisket was dry, pull  pork was nothing special.  Sides: of mac and cheese was thick and beans were just salty.  No one refill my water either.  Just very disappoint at the overall experience.  Not worth going for a second time."}
{"text":"I didn't give it a poor rating cause the owner is genuinely nice but everything of the resto sucks. Ran out of food at 8pm Food took forever.  Food was cold. Waitress was slow. Nice guy but not a place to go eat"}
{"text":"I made reservations here after reading the reviews on how amazing their BBQ is. We arrived and we're greeted by the really friendly staff. They don't have a menu for food or drinks, but your server will tell you what's available. I got the beef rib and brisket with mac and cheese and coleslaw. And he originally asked for the same but with pork ribs as well. Unfortunately, they had no pork ribs left. So he got the same as me. It did not take long to get our food, and once it came I was astounded at how big that beef rib was!   Honestly speaking, the mac and cheese and coleslaw were nothing to mention. Extremely standard. However, the brisket was the best meat I've ever had in my life. Oh my god. It literally melts in your mouth. The beef ribs were delicious as well, tons of smokey flavour. BUT THAT BRISKET THO. I will be going back, and getting just brisket.  It is quite pricey, for 2 of us just getting the 2 meat dishes, it costed about 77$, and no drinks. But if you are craving some damn good BBQ, check this place out!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came late on a Saturday night. We were the two last clients in the restaurant and they only had two meats left. Luckily it was exactly the two meats we wanted - one brisket and one beef rib. Unfortunately there was no more side of mac and cheese left. :( I will come back and try it one day. Mark my words. So instead we had the beans and the coleslaw. I know... not Evey exciting. Honestly I wish they had more side options because I wasn't excited about the sides at first. I would have liked some fries or mashed potatoes or cornbread but they don't have any of that stuff. You don't come here for the sides, people! You come here for the meat!! And the meat does not disappoint!! The beef brisket melts in your mouth and it's perfectly fatty and juicy. There was no need for sauce. My bf had the ribs and although it was more dry than the brisket he really enjoyed the ribs. For me, out of the two, the brisket wins hands down! The waiter recommended the beans and frankly I was surprised at how good they were. It's def not like the kind of beans you eat at breakfast places or at Cabane a Sucre. There were different kinds of beans cooked in a delicious dark sauce. It was not too sweet. The coleslaw was like every other coleslaw out there. I had a beer with the meal and I left very full and satisfied. The owner John came around and talked to us. What a  friendly guy! I like that he comes to every table and says hi. Turns out Lattuca is his family name. He was nice enough to offer us a shot of bourbon which we did with him. So fun! The staff was very friendly too. One waiter, Jacob, is an actor who starred in Bon Cop Bad Cop 2 and has an upcoming show on CTV. So cool and he's so down to earth! I would definitely recommend this restaurant to all the meat lovers out there! Go if you haven't yet!"}
{"text":"An uncontrollable \"hmmmm... \" came out of mouth followed by a meaty moment of bliss was felt after every bite I took from my humongous platter of carnivorous heaven. That smokiness... That perfect sweetness... Everything was so good. The beef rib is so big to the point where I could use the rib bone as a riot baton. The fat on every piece of meat is an excellent way to throw a party in your mouth. Lattuca is definitely one of my favorite place in Montréal now.   My only complain is the big useless knife that took too much space on the table - the fork was enough to pull apart the meat."}
{"text":"I went with a friend and we ordered The Resurrection ($31), which contained all four cuts, and split it.The idea was to split for now and then eventually add more (of the cut we liked) later, if we were still hungry. It was enough though, we were full after it, so the serving size was fairly good. They gave us two of each side too, because they knew we were splitting it.  All cuts tasted amaayayayzing, favorites were the brisket and short rib. All four cuts had meat that were all super soft and basically fell apart on the first bite. I learned that they smoke the days' meat overnight, the previous night. Also, do NOT miss out on those beans.   Great vibe, service, and food. If youre craving barbeque (or meat in general), don't go elsewhere."}
{"text":"This is a nice restaurant for meat lovers. It's interesting that the restaurant doesn't have a menu. Each day there's three kind of meat. You can choose one type or two type or three type. There's also three choices for sides. You can choose two from them. So easy to decide what to get! Lol.  I ordered beef. Very delicious. The service is ok. It's a little bit expensive than I expected from a two dollar marque ($$) restaurant. But, I guess it's the level of $$ in Old-Port."}
{"text":"Amazing experience from beginning to end. The restaurant ambiance was perfect; relaxed, hip and the best music selection...great combo of classic and indie rock. The food was beyond amazing. The best bbq I have ever had. Not only was the quality of meat exceptional but the portions were massive. The owner was one of the nicest and accommodating restaurant owners I have ever met. We came into the restaurant about 1.5 hours before closing time on a Sunday and the owner hooked us up with all the meat he had left. It was so much food that we had to get it packed up. He even packed us extra Mac and cheese and coleslaw for no charge. He even offered to bake us fresh bread!!! You will not be disappointed with your entire dinning experience."}
{"text":"Epic BBQ at Lattuca! Straight up meat (plus sides) so there's no menu, server just tells you what's available. Minimal drinks (some beers, wines, etc) but the focus is obviously on the meat.   Our party of 4 had the resurrection with beef ribs, pork ribs, brisket, and pulled pork (plus bbq baked beans and mac & cheese).  Lattuca is known for his award-winning brisket and it did not disappoint. It melted in your mouth. The ribs literally fell off the bone. Pulled pork was great as well.  The owner is passionate about BBQ and that can be tasted in the food.   There's not a lot of tables and it filled up very quickly, so reservations are highly recommended."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of southern style barbecue. Nothing beats deliciously tender, well seasoned meat that has been smoked for hours. I've had barbecue in Kansas, South Carolina, Georgia and Florida (amongst other places). Well, I can say that John Lattuca has nothing to envy from the most famous pitmasters!  His brisket was one of the best I've had in my life. Seasoned to perfection, it was tender and flavourful. So much that I didn't need to drench it in sauce.  His beef ribs were awesome as well. I'm not usually a big fan of beef ribs, I prefer babyback pork ribs. I think that's because most places I've had them, they are not tender and hard to eat. Here, it wasn't the case. They were melting and simply perfect.  I had taken the Trinity, but unfortunately that day I couldn't taste the pork ribs, they weren't ready. Sadly, I'll have to go back :-)  My only complaint would be the sides that came with the Trinity plate. The barbecue beans were excellent, the mac n' cheese however was fairly blend and uninteresting. I would have preferred a slaw, for a fresher/brighter note with the meat, and a little bun (because bread).  But overall, an excellent meal, with a generous portion of meat, for a very reasonable price. It was well worth the 30 minutes roundtrip from the office. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"3.5 !  It was good BBQ but not a fan of no menu.  I like looking at a menu and reading the description!  Our waitress told us about the 5 meats and thank goodness they had all five and usually they sell out and blah blah and we didn't know about sides and so I thought since we are 4 people I asked about a sampler platter to share.  She said good idea.  I got a Japanese beer (?) Sapporo and my husband went with La Fin Dumonde.  He loved it and the kids a Diet Coke.  With that being said, it came to $225.00 Canadian .  I thought that was slightly high.  It was well seasoned but a tad dry for us.  Didn't like the coleslaw but loved the baked beans."}
{"text":"Lattuca, lattuca BBQ... After 4 months of anticipation, I finally got to sample the BBQ.   The meats they offer are beef brisket, beef short rib, pork ribs, and pulled pork.  If you choose 1 meat out of the 4, it's 17$, 2 costs 19$, and the trinity (3) costs 23$. Which led me to ask, why is there a 2$ difference between 1-2 choices, but a 4$ difference between 2-3 choices?   Being a big fan of southern BBQ, I ordered the trinity (beef brisket, short rib, and pork rib) with mac n cheese and kansas style beans as sides.  The Jack Daniel's World champion brisket is made texas style. No surprise, if Texas had a holy BBQ animal, it'd be beef. Looking at the crust, I'm thinking they used a dry rub consisting of pepper, salt, paprika in equal parts. I saw a good pink/purple smoke ring surrounding the extremities of the brisket. The flat was a little dry and lacked in seasoning however. I didn't get the chance to sample the burnt ends and point, but those were good apparently.   The beef short rib has a nice smoke ring, and had the same flavour profile as the brisket, but it was a bit undercooked (parts close to the bone was still bloody). As the meat was still rigidly attached on the bone, I used a knife to scrape it off (cutting motion alone wouldnt do the job).   The pork rib (yes, one single rib) was made kansas-style, I suspect. In terms of taste, it was ketchupy sweet and very flavourful (onion powder, garlic powder, salt, pepper, cayenne, etc). Probably the best single rib I had at a restaurant in Montreal, but who the f**k orders 1 rib at a time?? If I had a half rack or more, I'd be able to judge it more thoroughly (the ribs on the sides are often burnt and dried out).  Mac N Cheese: pretty good mac n cheese, comparable to the one at Smoke Signals Q down in Lake Placid. I liked the idea of sprinkling a little bit of pork dry rub for enhanced taste.   Kansas-style Beans: very tasty but not very smoky. It had chunks of scrap meat and a hint of celery (that was very nice).  What was good about Lattuca's BBQ is that it doesn't come bathed in a heavy complementary sauce and it doesn't need one. The meats are obviously fresh so the taste of the meat alone was enough.   The downside was... I was secretly hoping to taste contest level meat -- kinda disappointed because I can reproduce this pretty easily in my backyard (it was 6 celsius yesterday) at a third of the price I was charged.   Overall, Lattuca serves hands down the most legit BBQ in Montreal, so if you haven't had southern american BBQ, you gotta check it out."}
{"text":"Excellent quality BBQ ! We ordered the holy Trinity (beef ribs, porc rib and brisket) and the proc ribs with brisket. Th brisket and beef rib were the clear winners! They were tender and moist and melted in your mouth without any sauce needed. Very similar to Texas quality BBQ. The sides of mac and cheese, coleslaw and beans were delicious. They were the right portion and not greasy or heavy which paired well with the meat. Attentive service. We really enjoyed our meal, it's a bit pricey at $27 a plate but BBQ is alot of work and ingredients cost more than in the Midwest of the USA. Worth stopping by! They also have a terrace for the summer."}
{"text":"Une des meilleurs place à Barbecue à Montréal. Repas typiques et savoureux. Une bonne sélection de bières. JE RECOMMANDE"}
{"text":"I came across this little gem while walking near the Port! Now I'm a Texan so I proceed with caution when it comes to BBQ joints, specially some where outside TX like in Montreal! The menu is very limited so it makes it easy to choose. I picked 2 meats which came with pulled pork and brisket, 2 sides , mac n cheese and slaw. I took the first bite and oh man was I in heaven! The brisket was perfectly juicy and smokey... I had to meet the chef! I told him how this was by far the best brisket I had outside TX (it was even better than some places in TX). He was so sweet and told me a little about his background and his love for BBQ, he even brought over a shot of whiskey... now that was an honor! The portions are huge so luckily I had some left overs for the next day! They also have a great selection of local beers so be sure to try them! The waiter (I forgot his name, sorry) was super attentive and suggested some great beers! I would def go back to this place whenever I'm in town! One little suggestion though, a piece of Texas toast, biscuit or a dinner roll would've completed the meal!"}
{"text":"Great people,amazing food....so good. John  and his food makes you feel right at home. We went for the hole THING...it's almost paradise! One bourbon, one rib, one beer. Amazing value for the $. Really worth it ...world class winner, world class food!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was in front of the St Lawrence River which I would bet is a prime location when it's warm out.  It was beautiful but awfully cold when I went for my visit. My boyfriend and I tried to go in on a Friday night around 8pm and was told they didn't have enough food to serve the rest of the night. I should've expected that since it's New Years weekend. We really wanted to try it so we made a reservation the for the next night at 7pm. It was delish and I'm so happy we went back. The brisket was tender and didn't need any sauce. I could I Say the same about the pulled pork. I got Mac and beans as my sides as they were delicious as well. I'm originally from Texas where bbq is king so that is saying a lot about bbq in the middle of Canada. It was perfectly moist and outstandingly tender.   For what I got which was a two meat with two sides was priced at $29 which I kind of thought was over the top coming from a Texan who can get the same meal at way less but I won't complain too much for it being outstanding and in Montreal of all places.   I would definitely recommend it. The restaurant is cozy and has very friendly staff. It was my first time in Montreal and they were some of the first people I spoke to that spoke and communicated effectively to a person like me from America that doesn't know a lick of French. Please give this place a try. It's awesome.   ."}
{"text":"This was on the places to see while in Montreal. We wanted good BBQ brisket, and this exceeded our expectations! The waiter told us there was a limited menu. We went with the brisket and the beef rib. They were amazing.   I only submit positive reviews, so I only post what is worthwhile. If you have a desire for great BBQ, you will not be disappointed.   We chatted with the owner about hockey, and it was obvious that he is just as passionate about his Canadiens as he is about making great food!  I hope this review helps you to make good food choices while in Montreal. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Hands down the best bbq place i've tasted by far!!! I've had bbq from a lot of places in the states and in Montreal and this place is oh so good!!! I just got home from it and had to write my review.  First. Service was very good considering the fact that it was a new staff. Super nice, friendly, patient... I can go on. Especially because i was with my husband and his colleagues. All construction workers that were kinda tipsy, loud and HUNGRY! ;). The waiters and chef/owner were up to par. I am a sucker for hood service and this place delivers it all!   Food:  Hands down the BEST bbq place you can find here in Montreal. To me the best all around. I ordered the trinity. Beef brisket, beef ribs and pork ribs. Deliciously tender, tasty, fall of the bone. You DON'T need any sauce like some other place. Trust me.  Sides:  Mac and cheese. Cheesy goodness. Coleslaw. Perfect freshness and crunch. Baked beans. Tender sweetness. Bring your appetite because the portions are generous!   This is the place to go if you want real, authentic and heavenly tasting bbq! No wonder they won the Jack Daniels bbq contest! Chef, your food speaks your passion. Bravo!!!"}
