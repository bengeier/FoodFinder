{"text":"I have had it with this location! We have called on numerous occasions for takeout and they seem to always be out of the one thing they are Known for....Shawarma! It did not matter if it was 5:00pm or 7:00pm, the response is always the same, please hold.....wait for it...response.... sorry we don't have any left!  I will not recommend this restaurant any more, nor will I frequent this restaurant!! Truly disappointing as the food was good, and I was even willing to overlook the premium pricing we paid!  Guess we're going back to Hanna's Shawarma,  So yes I rate them a zero, but Yelp does not go that low."}
{"text":"The food is great. The customer service is inconsistent. The person on phone is generally very nice but when we go to pick up the food it's a different story. My husband asked if he could have a side of banana peppers and was flat out told \"no.\" He asked if he could pay for them and he was told \"they are not for sale.\" Yikes! Maybe this person was having a bad day but their meals are not inexpensive by any stretch and this is a ridiculous response. I have been there to pick up food and also very rushed and short responses and curt. The service inside restaurant is much better. Again the food is great but they may need to re-educate the staff that the express still means good service. If someone wants to have a side of something, provide it!, Even if you charge for it!"}
{"text":"WOW. What a rude waitress. First time here and I night never come back just because of her."}
{"text":"Take out is disappointing as always. I'm always trying to give this place one more chance, but I've had it with them. Potatoes are dried out and wrinkly( see photo). Chicken has been sitting around-its dried out and hard. The eat in places are both really good, I don't understand why the express is so awful. And it's not just once this happened. Dinner is ruined, and money wasted. Lesson learned. Avoid this place."}
{"text":"Its not a bad place to get a quick bite. I went there last night and i tried their dinner shawarma it took 25 minutes for a shawarma  to come out which i think its a long time for a shawarma."}
{"text":"Went for a friends birthday dinner on a Saturday night. We had reservations for 6pm when we got there they said it was for 5.30pm and so we were late. They got us a table and informed us since we were late each person has to order minimum 25$ worth of food. The service was so lousy and waitress was rude. They were out of shawarma on a Saturday night by 6.30... Seriously??? Food was pretty good but the experience ruined it."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised to find that everyone's favorite middle eastern restaurant (located next door) now has a quick walk in take out location.   Prices are super reasonable ($7.95) for a HUGE chicken shawarma pita. Tasted great and fantastic value as the pita was stuffed to the brim!  I spoke with the lady behind the counter and discovered that they essentially carry everything that the sit down restaurant carries with the exception of the sweets and seafood!   Toppings were all fresh and the baba ganoush and tahini were fantastic!   Yumm!  Well I'm going back to enjoy this now. Happy Sunday all and hope you come here the next time you have a on the go middle eastern food crazing at me va me express :)"}
{"text":"Yes it does get busy and service can be slow at times but that's what you get with a middle eastern pickup joint. If you have no patience don't bother.  But the food is great, coming from a guy who lived in Israel and ate this.   The sandwiches in pita are delicious and the different topings are great. From fried eggplant, hummus, babaganoush, cabbage and others try the sandwiches . Shnitzel is huge and is good for 2, and the dark meat is great.  However the falafel and shwarmma need work, just being honest.    Overall a great place to experience and eat!"}
{"text":"I don't know why this place is called \"express\" anything. It's been 20 minutes since I ordered a simple pita with falafel. The staff are chilling in the back on their phones. This place is also over priced, I won't be back."}
{"text":"I called in to order lunch and was put on hold without even a warning. When the lady came on the phone she was rude and not helpful at all. I was inquiring about what my options were for salads and she had an attitude in her answers like I was supposed to know what they offered. Regardless of checking the menu before the customer service at this location is very poor. Even the sit down restaurant servers have an attitude. I love the food, but it really makes me uninterested in ordering with you guys again"}
{"text":"2 stars = Meh, I have had better (to be fair I'm middle eastern). I ordered the Jerusalem pita (chicken hearts and liver). It took 10 minutes to prepare but it was well worth it knowing that the meat was being prepared fresh. It tasted OK but maybe I should have just ordered chicken shawarma or falafel instead. Toppings were what you expect at a middle eastern restaurant (fried eggplants were good). Pita wrapping was alright but not up to par.  Overall I wouldn't mind grabbing some to go when I'm hungry and in the area but its surely not the place I will go to when I'm craving middle eastern food."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch.  Lovved the fod and the prices. Big portions.  Downside was the pita literally fell apart one bite in.  The people working don't seem to friendly."}
{"text":"Best Shawarma in the GTA! Lived in the area for a long time but just discovered this place not too long ago. Their hummus is to die for. Just try to avoid the lunch hour rush because you can easily be waiting 20-25mins for your order. Other than that, this place is the bomb diggity."}
{"text":"The biggest shawarma sandwich in town. Lots of options for toppings and sauce with delicious bread which is not pita. I have always got food from their express restaurant for take out so I can't really comment on the full menu and service. I have never been able to finish a sandwich in one go so for me the sandwich almost always ends up being two meals.   Food: 4.5/5 Price: 5/5 Service and atmosphere: N/A Overall: 4/5"}
{"text":"The food is good, however definitely nothing special. It lacks seasoning for sure. The pricing I can say is ridiculous especially with so many other middle eastern places in the area."}
{"text":"I usually order the Schnitzel sandwich on a baguette with a side salad. Sandwich is good,salad is good, but my only issue is HOW THEY PUT TOPPINGS ON THE SANDWICH. My god! can ME VA ME please figure this out... It's really hard to eat the sandwich when all the topping are resting right on top of the sandwich and NOT IN THE SANDWICH one bite and PLOP ALL ON THE PLATE."}
{"text":"Reasonable price for large portions of food. Food is fairly well prepared and tasty, but sometimes it's a miss when the meat is overly dry or overcooked. In general, the food in the restaurant is better. This takeout place gets pretty busy at times, so it's not even really an \"express\" in some cases."}
{"text":"Me va me is one of my favourite places to eat.  I have had different experiences at different express locations, but this location was fantastic!  Lots of seating.  Very clean.  Friendly staff.  I had the Kefta.  It was very moist and savoury.  I also had the roasted vegetables and hummus.  Fantastic food and reasonable for the feast that I had.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Had an amazing dinner party a few days ago with some friends. Take out was great. They were fast and spot on with the order. Got the party of 16 people in 25 min.   Shawarma, rice, schnitzel, salad and veg. All great and everyone enjoyed.  Only issue I had with the order was no pita was included.  After ordering that much food I still had to pay for pita. I found that annoying. Most other places in the area include pita based on volume of food."}
{"text":"I was really disappointed. Just stopped by and got 2 shawarma pitas.  I'm sure they used to add more meat (as I used to come here quite a bit) and I'm a regular at other middle eastern places. First off, they are more expensive that other middle eastern places in the area like Yummy Grill and they give a much smaller portion, particularly of the meat.  We got 2 shawarma pitas - about $15 with tax The fill them less than half full and then add the salads... I personally don't like TOO much salad but that's what they try to fill the pita with. I could barely taste the meat. Usually, I can't finish a pita but this one I finished and probably could've had another.   They've gotten very stingy. If you want good middle eastern food in fair portions for great prices try Yummy Grill or Orly."}
{"text":"Food tastes good but it took over half an hour to get felafel balls and fries.   Got there at 5:20 with my hungry son and we stood there, with minimal other foot traffic I should add, while they took more than 30 minutes to put felafel balls and fries in the deep fryer. Not only is felafel fast food, but the sign say EXPRESS.   When we complained, the girl said they are short staffed. She offered no compensation  even when we complained and said they should at least compensate us somehow and didn't bother to tell us about the delay  before we ordered. She just let us stand there.   As a regular customer to their dining room, I'll now be considering other middle eastern  restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Me Va Me - from it's humble beginnings to what it represents today - it's done well. The food is god here. The portions are good here. The quality is adequate for the price point. The service is friendly. Next time you feel like Israeli cuisine, this place is worth a consideration. The popularity of late has resulted in longer waits now.  Personally, it's not take out worthy to me (they have a take our counter next door), but if you want an easy dine-in experience, without worrying about breaking the bank - it's good. In terms of comparisons, it's almost like thinking about eating at a chain restaurant - you know you get consistency and decent pricing - is it the best? No, is it crap? Definitely not."}
{"text":"Price increases, quality decreases and a cut in selections. Not sure what's going on here, but they've definitely lost a loyal customer."}
{"text":"2.5   There's lots of Me Va Me locations, so I decided to finally venture in and try it out. It was ok...but nothing too special.   I didn't get the Mediterranean food here which is their signature cuisine, and instead opted for salad and soup as I was in the mood for a light lunch.   The soup is the soup of the day so it varies, so I got broccoli on the day I visited. It was pretty good, but I would say you could easily make it at home. Same thing with the salad - good taste and fresh but easy to make at home.   I think I paid some amount close to $13 with tax...this is what really affected my rating. The service and food taste is fine, but for what you are getting I don't think it's particularly worth it. I may try Me Va Me again if they are having daily specials, but there are comparable places in the area with bigger portion sizes and similar dishes at a much better price point."}
{"text":"Good middle eastern food in a casual atmosphere.   Service was a little slow but appropriate given the price range."}
{"text":"So this place is great, and it's a regular spot for me whether I stop by for pickup/takeout, or I call for delivery. My only intake on them is that they're very slow at times, it's a busy location and you should be prepared with more staff both on the service level And on the line. Their wraps (on the express side) are kinda on the pricey level, however, they're very large for the average eating person bit always tastes good. Delivery usually takes about an hour to an hour and a half from ordering time, and it's NOT always available, as they seem to have some shortage with their drivers. I highly recommend the schnitzel Laffa wrap, and the falafel wrap, as well as their mushroom salad is always PERFECT. They should also work on their cleanness, especially customer facing part as it looks very dirty and not appealing as per the photo I had posted here, and if customer facing looks like this, then I could only hope that the kitchen does look better. They need to work on these points above to keep the name on the same good level as their food."}
{"text":"Used to love this place, but service has been terrible past few times. Came in and made a $100 order, promised 15 minute wait. 45 minutes later, finally it's ready, girl gives me attitude, and on top of that after asking a side of pickles (which I've gotten the last 20+ times) she laughs and says \"you gotta pay for that\". Enjoy my money, won't be coming back. Food is decent but hard to enjoy with a shitty mood."}
{"text":"I frequent this place and it's always busy, but worth the wait every time.  There is nothing bad to say about the food.  If you are hungry and you are impatient, then I don't recommend you come, because you would give it a bad review, and it is NOT fair thing to do because your food is being prepared fresh.  You can taste the difference.  I am telling you, their falafels are the best ever!  You can't get better than this, with all the toppings...you are going to indulge in the flavors.  Moroccan cigars are another treat.  Oh, there are the amazing schnitzels and sauces and meats and....you get the message...it's all amazingly good...no, it's actually great.   It's take out brought to a whole new level.  It's perfected.  They are busy, yet super clean, incredibly friendly and above all amazing service and the food is worth the wait.  It's an experience I will continue to enjoy.  Thanks Me Va Me Express.  If you have time, their busy restaurant is another experience to take in with a group of people, or with your partner.  Great family spot too.  Like I said, they have it all"}
{"text":"Try their chicken shawarma pita--pretty reasonably priced. Excellent taste. The service was very good with all fresh ingredients. Like they say, the baba ganoush was great!!!"}
