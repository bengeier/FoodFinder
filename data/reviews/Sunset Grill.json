{"text":"Horrible experience there. I went there early today with couple friends. The server there ignored us a few times and when she did come to the table, instead of asking us what we want she gave us a lesson on how to order food in Canada, telling us arrogantly that we should close the menu to indicate her the fact  that we are ready to order. Lol. And when we finish the meal and telling our feelings to the manager there, he couldn't care less and again taught us that we really should close the menu. What can I say. Food not so good there, service there disgusted me. I would never ever going back to that place."}
{"text":"Mixed experience.  Sausages and home fries were cold.  Server seemed genuinely upset.  In summary:  Service? Great!  Food?  Not so much."}
{"text":"My hubby and I like these guys fine.  Fans of the real old school greasy spoon (ie. The Stem) they deliver a good solid big grease fare.  The service this morning was excellent.  Why only three stars?  Slightly more costly than a real old time spoon, I love booths to sit in and good tunes with my breakie.  Otherwise I can easily rely on the Grill as a comfortable easy fall back."}
{"text":"I've been going here for years and finally decided to write a review. 

This place has changed owners a few years ago and hasn't been the same since.  The portions were much larger before and prices have increased with the new owners. 

One thing I really wish they would do is ensure that all employees wear a hair net and gloves when handling the food. I have found one too many hairs in my breakfast because of this issue.   Some wear them but others do not and I hate the thought of someone touching my toast with their bare hands. 

The waitresses have high turn over ever since the new ownership.   Overall they do a good job and are fairly quick in serving you. 

Oh and forget about asking for extra anything like extra piece of celery or carrot with your blt sandwich.  They charge for every little thing. As minor as it is.   

Overall good food but they really need to revamp their menus and provide kids portions at cheaper prices.  They also need to focus on hygiene."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Had to grab my own menu, my own cutlery, food was sub par for what they charge (a side of bacon is the same cost as purchasing an entire package at a grocery store). Over cooked, and small portions. \"Fresh squeezed\" orange juice.. Not fresh.. Full of preservatives. Server threw the bill at us at the end of the meal. It wasn't overly busy, and we never raised complaint, so her behaviour was kind of unexpected and rude. Wont be going there again and will be advising others that it's not worth going to. Next time we stay home and just make our own.."}
{"text":"Really good find! This place is primarily a weekday breakfast/lunch spot located in a business area. Open 7 days a week. 
Food is really nice quality, with some vegetable additions and options. They have standard breakfast, but was happy to see some twists off the standard fare.
One reason I love this place, is it has lots of space. I am so sick of waiting for a crappy table at Coras to get some overpriced food.
Decor is outdated, but it is clean.
Waitstaff is super friendly without being annoying.
Highly recommended."}
{"text":"For reasons beyond me, I dragged my boyfriend here to celebrate our anniversary. I thought it would be like the location downtown, which seemed to have good reviews. Big mistake. I ordered an western omelet, that came with homefries. The omelet was hugeee, but lacking in flavour. The home fries were terrible, roasted potatoes that looked like they had been scraped from the bottom of the pan. My boyfriend had the steak, which arrived undercooked and almost made me sick to watch him attempt to eat it. I won't be returning here.

PS: They also don't accept debit or credit card, so be aware. They do have a pricey ATM at the entrance, though."}
{"text":"Fantastic place for breakfast, brunch or lunch. Scott, our waiter, was over the top outstanding. Menu selection is excellent and prices reasonable for being in Toronto. Definitely a place to come back to."}
{"text":"Worst egg Benedict ever in my life!!!!!  1St time hear that it comes with FRIED EGG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  then get the waters to change.  Attitude changed immediately!  Ive adviced to the waitress to make sure the eggs aee runny, guess what,of cause when i got my plate, the eggs are hard boiled!!!!!! Wtf......Will never go again."}
{"text":"Sunset  grill is one of the best breakfast places. The food was so good especially the veggie delight and the the.waffles where so good while hot and the grilled cheese sandwich was delightful. Got I this place it is so good."}
{"text":"I come here often for breakfast/brunch on the weekends. It is hands-down the best value in the neighborhood. I'll often walk by a number of other breakfast spots with crowds and lines outside, but there is never a line or wait at this place. That being said, the places with lines and crowds are fancier, and have higher quality food. But if you just want a simple eggs, meat, toast combo, or a simple omelet, this place is great. Big portions for cheap. Friendly staff. 

So if you are looking for a decent, cheap (under $10 for meal with coffee) and quick (in and out in 30 mins) greasy spoon in the Dundas/Dufferin area, you should definitely stop in here."}
{"text":"Good food but the restaurant is too loud to have a conversation due to a bare steel ceiling that amplifies the noise. 

***Accessibility tip: If you have any sensitivity to loud noise or hearing difficulties I strongly recommend avoiding this restaurant and trying another location.***

I've been here twice. The first time the restaurant was packed and my Dad and I could barely hear each other talk but the breakfast platter was good with eggs, sausage and real fried potatoes and the service was fast. 

I went again with my boyfriend on a weekday thinking it wouldn't be as busy or as loud but the noise was still deafening despite a smaller crowd. Again, the service was friendly and fast and the food was good, standard breakfast fare. I had the sunset sandwich with potatoes (good) and vegetables (one carrot and cucumber stick, amusing)."}
{"text":"Decidedly average. Nothing here to write home about, just your standard breakfast fare from standard wholesalers, cooked to standards in keeping with your average diner."}
{"text":"I love a good brea kfast and have been atr this location about 4 times. I am not impressed with the food. Its ok ...and sometimes ok is  well ok. Its about 8 bucks. Not bad but I have had better breakfasts at the Aris on Roncesvalles ( the one closest to High Park Avenue) . Its certainly cheaper than the Easy Breakfast ( cost me $22 for regular breakkie and coffee and tip) Unlike the sunset grill on Dundas , homefries doesnt come with  all your breakfast and the meat seems a little cheaper. The biggest thing that bugs me, is that their coffee is not great. Its  hardly good either. That is the sign of a great breakfast place . I think they water it down too much.  I will say that the staff was nice.  
Overall, I dont find there much in the BWV area for breakfast ( a few bakeries) so you kinda have to suck it up. 
I will be back again.. I dont have that much to chose from."}
{"text":"Weekdays off work are a rare thing for me and my old fella so when we both happened to have Friday off I had 2 things in mind: generally slothful behaviour and a good greasy breakfast. Sunset Grill is just a 5 minute walk from my humble abode so I thought we should give it a try. Now, breakfast is pretty hard to mess up. I can honestly say I have never had a truly awful breakfast. I have however, never had my breakfast delivered at a speed that I need a Stephen Hawking book to understand.  This was the fastest service I have ever seen. Period.  As for the food itself, I had the Florentine Omelet  (nice healthy spinach & tomatoes cancel out the fries I swear!) and he had a standard egg/bacon combo.  Good work from the chef on the crispy bacon,as I find chewy under-cooked bacon repellent. Yeah, I'm the girl that eats off her boyfriend's plate - you got a problem with that? I didn't think so! I will definitely patronize this establishment the next time I'm too lazy to make breakfast!"}
{"text":"I like this place. Fast service. Pancakes are much much smaller than Sunset Grill Richmond Hill (1500 Elgin Mills). I mean way smaller!!!!! What's with that? All in all, good service, friendly, fast.  I will go back."}
{"text":"My hubby and I had popped in for breakfast at the William Kitchen location  in Scarborough and was in for a treat! The place was immaculately clean, the service was amazing and the food was delicious.  Would definitely recommend the \"French Connection\" platter.  The French toast had a lemony zing, the orange juice was awesome, the poached eggs were perfect! Loved it and will be back for more."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, tasty and generously sized meals, and comfy vibe.

Ordered the 3 egg breakfast, with home fries, bacon, toast. Came out just as I would have wanted it. Bacon slices were much larger than I expected! Cool.

My wife ordered the western omelette. Advice....if you choose to also order one, be hungry or split it. It was made from 6 eggs!! Humongous! 

Coffee refills were plentiful, and the prices were in line with the quality of the food.

Looking forward to another breakfast here."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. The pancakes are divine and no matter who I go with there is always something everyone enjoys.


 They sell breakfast all day, are in the perfect location for watching the world go by and the staff are phenomenal.


 There is always a queue to get in and once in the world just stops and you are never rushed or hassled. I wish I could go to breakfast here every weekend."}
{"text":"The Pancakes and the Waffles are delicious, also the Eggs with bacon, the coffee, just everything  Did I mention the home fries? It's awesome to get a wonderful breakfast at a very low price.


 The staff is extremely friendly and attentive, the employees give you a smile and you have to smile back, automatically!


 Unfortunately, the Sunset Grill isn't an insiders' tip, so maybe you have to wait a couple of minutes."}
{"text":"One of my favourite sunset grills. The service is always great and the bacon is crispier! I love coming to this location."}
{"text":"It's hard to have anything bad to say about the food quality at any Sunset Grill location. Always spot-on tasty and a good size for the price.

What I was disappointed in was the service at this location on my last visit. The moment we entered our server was not happy. If we are spending money on going out, we don't want to feel unwanted and have to deal with an angry server. 

I asked for a very simple substitution, as did my friend, the server was completely rude and replied with \"I won't do that\". Not being able to substitute something is completely okay (although this substitution would have meant less cost and more money for them and was reasonable), but being rude about it was unacceptable. We were basically hurried out the whole time, despite it being dead inside and not busy.

Food came fast and warm, no complaints. Refills were brought okay.

Before I literally put the last bite of food in my mouth she scooped up my plate, saying nothing and bringing the bill. She would not reply to anything but simply go ahead on with it.

In short, this place would be perfect if they taught their servers (or this one in particular) that they need to throw a smile on, or maybe even ask if things are okay, not rush customers out (especially in a dead time). 

And servers, you know your tip will be greatly higher if you just try not send attitude towards customers?"}
{"text":"Great place. lots of seating outdoors.Odd mix of parrot heads, bikers,yuppies, punk rockers, hipsters, children, dogs and boaters. My only gripe is that if ya wanna walk around the park with a beer ya gotta pay the semi high prices, So an all day bbq can get pretty pricey. I wish ya could get a discount on a carry out, but i understand the reasoning. It is one of my favorite places in Cleveland."}
{"text":"After having to go to the bar for a drink because the server wouldn't come to our table, the food that came was obviously prepackaged.  Salsa was like Pace's.  Gross.  The grilled chicken salad was like one at a school cafeteria.  The new name and management didn't do this place any good.  Just say no."}
{"text":"same eggs and pancakes and waffles, and lil steaky bits for breakfast, same blackwater/coffee but if you ask me you can find better places, Zet's in mississauga, or even Dennys or Cora or the Grille, they're better and have better accommodations as well, I am 5'11'' so not the tallest person in the world but the chairs and tables were sort of cramping and cheap and uncomfy, the only good thing, pretty good french toast, i did like them and thats why the three stars otherwise it's just a two star."}
{"text":"I think that this might be a case of a franchise growing too quickly for it's own good. I've been to the Sunset Grill in the beaches and it felt like a family restaurant. This location felt like Frans. If you have read my review of Frans, you will know that this is NOT a compliment. The breakfast was pretty boring & tasteless.

Our server was friendly and efficient. There, that's one good thing that I can say. 

**There are other spots in this area to eat at that are better for brunch.**"}
{"text":"A lot of small things end up for a poor experience. Came in Sunday at noon, well pass the rush. Table for 2. First thing I noticed was the wasp flying around our table and the amount of bread crumbs that were brushed up against the window. The server spilled my orange juice on the tray, so once it was on the table we had puddles of juice that she didn't wipe up throughout the entire meal. Eventually I checked to see if the cup was leaking...it got really messy. There are no napkins on the table, we used our straw wrappers to clean what we could. Also for $4 for juice, I would have liked a full glass. The food was sub-par at best. Scrabbled eggs so badly overcooked and very dry. You could get fresher scrambled eggs at a buffet. Over easy egg had a broke yolk that was cooked through completely and covered with potatoes, cook must have thought we wouldn't notice? Potatoes had pressure bruises and sprouts that were never removed before cooking, otherwise potatoes were dry and unseasoned. I don't know how to explain the corned beef hash, but there were white flakes that must have been potato of some sort, I don't know why it isn't mixed with their homefries, but you get the hash and a side of potatoes. Bacon was very fatty, not crispy and sitting in a puddle of grease on the plate. Sausage was typical grocery store brand and went untouched. 1 jam packet comes with your toast, which was actually just warm bread, not toasted and only partially buttered. The middle was soaked and the sides untouched. The juice and coffee were good. Server never did a quality check just asked if we were done. I was going to let her know of the problems and we desperately needed water but she just never came to us. We did get a good chuckle as a server asked the next table if they wanted hot sauce with their meal and for them to give an awkward response that french toast and hot sauce don't mix. Breakfast for 2 was $38 plus a tip. Far too expensive for poor diner food and bad service. We should have went to Symposium or Ajax's original Sunset Grill on Bayly. We live around the corner and this was a huge letdown!"}
{"text":"this is actually not a bad place for breakfast.  the service was pretty good as well, very fast and friendly.  I have to say, the potatoes are not that good, everything else was pretty normal.  portions are pretty decent and price is typical.

we ordered a sunset club sandwich and the French connection.  the chicken and bacon in the sandwich was cooked very well.  eggs, french toast and bacon were pretty good as well in the French connection.  the only thing not that good was the potatoes. 

to be honest, my preference would still be dim sum for breakfast.   just enjoy the variety as opposed to a single plate of food.

will I come back...  yes.  can't always be so Chinese.  lol"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my visit here.  A 'hidden' gem in Scarborough I think. 

I did get the older lady server who really anticipated everything, including asking if I wanted HP or Frank's hot sauce!

Bacon was alot fresher than alot of other places I've been, and premeal bacon as well.  I actually tasted the 'freshness' and flavour of it.  I find most places taste burnt, or bland, or dry. 

Hope my future experiences there is as good as my first."}
{"text":"Breakfast was awesome, been 4 times, peameal bacon always juicy and delicious, prices are very affordable. Service was very efficient, drank a whole pot of coffee each visit. Very clean. Lived 5 min from the original Sunset Grill in Toronto in the 80's , so happy to get my Calgary Sunset fix....."}
{"text":"Hearty omelet and good coffee along with polite, fast service. Recommend for anyone in the area looking for breakfast."}
{"text":"Just love this place. The interior is a little too IKEA like but the service is fast and friendly. The food is fresh and the prices are affordable.

If you want to feast get the Sunset Supreme!"}
{"text":"I usually eat out from this location. But I must say, the food is always delicious, their bacon, eggs, buttered toast &  home fries are the best from a small location. Sure it may cost $7 or so for the breakfast, but I must say it's well worth the money for the amount given compared to a mcdonalds breakfast combo, which is just a 1/4 of the amount of food given for the same price. 

When I'm really hungry, I'll buy 2 or 3 of the Sunset Super combo. (I can eat a lot, and I'm a larger built person naturally)."}
{"text":"Would not recommend. This place could be so much better if they had better management. Skip to bottom for summary if you're short on time.

It's a restaurant. People come to eat and have fellowship with friends and family. They don't come for harassment, overcharging, or lies.

Positives: Our server was polite and is the ONLY reason I left any tip at all. I enjoyed my food. 

Negatives: First we were seated at a table right by the door which was constantly being opened by people entering (-12 degrees outside, for context), despite there being a better table close by . I wasn't allowed to sit there because I didn't have my complete party present. We asked to be moved after the party was complete and got a better seat. Again, not an issue with the servers, just the seating policy.

Second, we were billed incorrectly. My friend and I ordered two different meals at two different costs, but were charged for two of the more expensive meal. We had to ask for the bill to be changed. Let me repeat. We had to ASK to be charged the correct price for our food. Let that sink in.

Third, the manager (I assume, because he wore no uniform and was arrogant enough not to be polite), asked us to hurry and pay after trying to take my drink away from me while I was still drinking it. I had to ask for my drink back. Let me repeat. I had to ask for my drink back. Let that sink in. He returned 5 minutes later and claimed that we had to leave because there was a single group waiting to sit and everyone else was still eating. I'm quite sure that's not how a restaurant works. You wait however long you have to wait, because you expect that when it's your turn, you will not be hurried out of the place. Silly me.

Fourth, when I went to pay, I expressed to him (as he was also handling the cash register) that I did not appreciate being rushed out. My exact words were, \"I have to say, I do not appreciate being rushed out of here.\" His response? \"FOUR HOURS. You were here for four hours guys.\" FALSE. We were there from 11:10am until 1:20pm. Anyone who can count and tell time knows that's not even two and a half hours, let alone four. Why lie TO your customers ABOUT your customers? Is this the way to do good business nowadays? Treat the customers you already have like shit so you can get more? I'm pretty sure that's a bad plan. When we both confronted him about this saying that we had NOT been there for four hours, he simply said, \"okay okay\" in a much quieter but equally rude voice. Also, if you have the audacity to put 18% as your minimum expectation for a tip on your debit machine (which is higher than the generally accepted standard), you had better provide service worthy of an 18% tip, and we definitely did NOT get that. You also don't argue with a customer in front of other customers when they tell you they don't like they way you personally treated them. 

TL; DR - Food's all right. Individual servers are all right depending on who you get. Manager (again I assume that's who he was) is rude, arrogant, insulting, and has poor customer service and communication skills. Will NOT return. Would NOT recommend. 7 West a block away, heck even the Longo's supermarket  next door has better food and better service. 

Truly disgusted."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying this - our server was great. Fast friendly & efficient. Unfortunately, I will not return to this location despite the friendly servers we have had. Why? You ask... well, the owners told us to never return. After shouting at us calling us cheaters. Our bill was $37.10. Impeccable service deserves a nice tip. So I wanted to pay with (3) $20 bills. The female owner was at the cash. And tried to tell us that we only gave her (2) $20 bills, which caused her to raise her voice and refer to us as \"cheaters\".. still keeping our composure, we responded in a calm manner just telling her that she was mistaken. And that we gave her $60. After we told her that she really shouldn't speak to her GUESTS like that, she replied with WELL I DON'T CARE and her husband stepped in and told us CUSTOMER NOT ALWAYS RIGHT GET OUT. We did get the correct change back. She either knew she made a mistake and couldn't admit it, or just wanted us out. 

After all of that we approached our server and handed her a $10 tip and continued to thank her for her service. The male owner interrupted pulling her by her arm frantically telling her to come to a table they're waiting. 

How rude can you be? Learn the ropes before you try to run a business. Fools."}
{"text":"Sunset Grill is my preferred chain when I am in the mood for a casual brunch. This placed was packed on a Saturday morning! Luckily we arrived just before the crowd showed up. I ordered sausage and three eggs (cooked over easy), which was served with home fries and thick toast, and my boyfriend ordered salmon eggs sunset. His eggs were slightly overdone but everything was otherwise delicious. Portions are generous and the prices aren't bad either. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I'm a regular so perhaps I'm bias but this place is consistant and delicious.  Service is always good if not fair when I first starting going.  Would recommend to anyone who's got a smile on their face and is happy to eat some REAL breakfast.  For loners/downers/stressers maybe not the best place to be.  Stick to Tims for a quick bite, this place is purely bright and cheery and ready for you to devour some serious bacon products."}
{"text":"Has a breakfast after Christmas. Staff is was friendly and nice. I arrived at 10am and the place got crowded at 11am, so if you want a table arrive early. 

The food is very good, had some pancakes and a turkey bacon with eggs. Everything was well prepared and definitely worth the price."}
{"text":"Der Sunset Grill in Toronto ist eine super Adresse, um selbst zu den ungewöhnlichsten Uhrzeiten lecker zu frühstücken! Das All-Day-Breakfast kann auch wirklich so verstanden werden, man kann selbst mit einem ordentlichen Jetlag bei angebrochener Dunkelheit noch wunderbar frühstücken ;-).
Das Angebot lässt keine Wünsche offen, beim Lesen der Speisekarte läuft einem schon das Wasser im Munde zusammen! Die tollen Omeletts mit verschiedenen frischen Zutaten sind schwer zu empfehlen, es können jedoch auch Eigenkreationen ganz nach persönlichem Geschmack bestellt werden.
Auch das Herz der Süßspeisenfans schlägt höher.. Waffeln und Pancakes in allen Variationen mit frischen Früchten oder Honig. Kaum etwas, das es nicht gibt! Die Preise sind für die Stadt durchschnittlich.
Für uns in Toronto die erste Adresse, um lecker zu frühstücken. Wir waren nicht nur einmal im Sunset Grill! :-)"}
{"text":"Service: Good 

Food: tried the Greek I omelette and really liked it. Very big and cheesy!! 

People also tried the eggs Benedict and it looked ok but I've had better.

Atmosphere: we sat on the patio and were a group of 10. The patio had just enough space for all of us but no one else could fit anymore."}
{"text":"Went get only because it was close and wanted to give it one more try. But definitely loss 2 customers today. Food was decent but could have had been better. You'd think you should get the basics right - coffee, eggs, bacon and potatoes should be on point if it's your main reason why people come to your restaurant. Lets just say, never liked their coffee and waited to go to Starbucks after my meal for a decent cup at $2.25 (regardless if it was bottomless). Note to Waiters:  Tips are for service and if you got a side of attitude, be prepared for less than 15%"}
{"text":"I have been going to Sunset Grill about twice a week for nearly 2 years now, and it remains to be one of my favorite places to grab breakfast and lunch. The staff is always extremely friendly and helpful, and the food is always made to order fresh, is consistent, and is made in a very timely fashion for those in a hurry... Not to mention the restaurant is always clean. The roast beef panini and the fish 'n chips are two of my favorites... and the prices are reasonable, between $7 and $15 for an excellent meal. Definitely check this place out... the chef is so great that he will whip up special orders, even if they aren't on the menu! THAT'S customer service at its finest."}
{"text":"I went there for a late breakfast, just before they closed for the day. I ordered the smoked salmon and poached eggs. Delicious! The service was fast and the servers were very polite. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"If there was a way to give zero stars i would. The waitresses use a phone instead of a pad and paper to take the order. It took a while to realize that and because of that it seemed as if she was texting or scrolling facebook while she was taking my order. She stared at the phone the whole time and it was very impersonal, even once i realized that was how she was punching in the order. The homefries were a mixture of burnt and undercooked. It seemed like the cook had potatoes left over from the previous order and rushed out the fresh ones once he noticed they were burning. The bacon was burnt and extremely salty. It was closer to resembling jerky than bacon. Up until now i thought it was impossible to screw up bacon and eggs but sunset grill proved me wrong.  0 out of 5"}
{"text":"I go the Sunset Grill on Kingston Rd. near Lawrence when I'm visiting my mom.  Breakfast is my favourite meal of the day so I'm happy when I have a neighbourhood haunt I can rely on.  This restaurant is super friendly and the service is fair to good.  I've had eggs benny, which were yummy and french toast which was delicious.  The hash browns are a bit dry and probably from frozen, not home fried.  Prices are very reasonable and portions are generous.  Friends with me have had eggs and bacon and liked them.  The restaurant itself has a slightly  cavernous feeling about it because it's big but don't worry, there's no echo.  Seats are comfortable.  If  you want to read a paper or visit with friends it's quiet enough for both.  I recommend this place for a reliable, informal breakfast that won't break the wallet."}

{"text":"I have recently returned to Canada and found lovely apt. in Port Credit. Then I got luckier and found the above Sunset Grill run by Simeon De Borja, a charming and efficient host [ who is not above cleaning tables !] Also the waitstaff is consistently good humored and help each other where needed.How does  that theme song from \"Cheers\" go ?\" There 's a place where they know my name .......,\" that's how this place feels like to me. By now I have eaten my way through the menu and liked all that's offered ! The restaurant is a success but I just wanted to add my two bits.

{"text":"I can't believe anyone would find fault with this restaurant the food and the people are amazing"}
{"text":"Bustling location, service was good each time despite line waiting.  Solid breakfast omelettes are fresh and fluffy, and surprisingly good roasted potatoes."}
{"text":"Awful.  No other word aptly describes this place. How hard is it to make a decent grilled cheese sandwich? Slapping melted cheese in between two pieces of toast is not grilled cheese. And the eggs Benedict....... Yuck."}
{"text":"You'd think a place that did breakfasts all day would be called the Sunrise Grill, but I digress...

The Sunset Grill is like a greasy-spoon without the grease (at least off the plates), but for me, the grungy, morning-after feeling of breakfast joints are half the charm. Still, Sunset Grill does a workmanlike breakfast at a reasonable price, and though it's a chain, it doesn't really feel like it.

it's quite family-friendly, and \"safe\" in every sense of the word: clean, simple, unimaginative. It's a good place to go if you have a lot of noisy little kids; a not-so-good place to go if you want to avoid lots of noisy little kids."}
{"text":"Good breakfast & great service.. Must try breakfast..great new innovative technology with there ordering techniques.  They take our order on an iPad and it goes straight to the kitchen. Less room or error."}
{"text":"Breakfast-for-lunch is a standby, each thursday, in my office and this place is our destination of choice.  When the call for 'Bacon' echoes across the tops of the monitors, about eight of us shuffle down here for artery-clogging goodness.

They do a mean plate of hashbrowns, eggs and bacon or sausage.  Their pancakes are great, and their french toast will put you into a blissful sugar coma.

Its my favourite way to take the edge off an expected afternoon meeting.

Make sure to plan for the gym later, for the cholesterol will kill you.

They do have an expansive menu, and serve more than the just bacon&eggs -- but I haven't tried most of it.  One of my co-workers says they have a great burger.  I wouldn't know :)

Also, infinite coffee is in direct supply and the waitstaff are friendly."}
{"text":"Average place to have breakfast. Nothing fancy but quick service.

Total was $25+tip"}

We enjoyed excellent customer service & very reasonable prices.
More important, I ordered 3 eggs over-easy with home-made fries; let me tell you: the eggs were done the best way, just like the book says!

So clean place, smiling staff, great place to come back to again and again."}
{"text":"This specific location was not that great in my opinion. Of all days that I wanted to try a new place for brunch this is not a great day for me. I really was hankering for some eggs benny for a while. And to my surprise this specific Sunset Grill isn`t the place to get it.

I'm used to my eggs benedict with poached eggs. They served them with sunny side up? I was confused. Maybe it was my hopeful/wishful thinking and didn't read the description to the Eggs Sunset properly but I was pretty disappointed to receive it. On top of that I felt rushed. Busers just took plates on hand after they asked us if we were done... Of course being rushed didn't get our bill for 20 minutes... yeah. I don't get it. 

Less to say I'm not going to this specific Sunset Grill ever. I'll stick to what I already know down town even if I have to walk an extra 10 blocks."}

{"text":"STAY AWAY. This place excels at providing you with the most inconvenient, frustrating, and awkward dining experience. The manager guy loiters around the cash area and stares at the servers and customers with a worried look yet does nothing at all to help. The manager's eyes staring at my party and I were enough to make us want to leave. Everything about this place is difficult. From ordering your food to paying the bill nothing is easy. Notice how I haven't even began to talk about the food.

The food is absolutely horrible. It's that simple. The eggs suck, the bacon is soggy and extremely fatty, the coffee sucks, nothing is seasoned, the \"home fries\" are basically half cooked potatoes which again are not seasoned and taste like nothing and the place fosters panic attacks. Do not I repeat DO NOT go there with even the slightest hangover as the chaos that place breeds will surely induce you into having an anxiety attack. 

Yes it's cheap and yes it's close to me which, judging by other reviews on here, is a big reason why people keep going back. Let me just say this: you get what you pay for (or in this case LESS than what you paid for), and for $3 or 4 more you can go LITERALLY RIGHT NEXT DOOR to Gayley's and have an infinitely better dining experience. There you will find that the coffee is fresh ground (not the packaged stuff that Sunset and other \"we don't give a sh*t anymore\" places use, the food tastes good because there is some passion and effort put into the preparation, it's consistent, and it's reasonable. You will also notice that everyone is doing something, there is the pleasant absence of a manager/owner type hovering around the cash staring at everyone with an extremely worried look on his face yet doing nothing himself. The service is excellent and the food is amazing. I live across the street and can't for the life of me understand why people still go to Sunset when there is a place next door that is 500 times better.

To be clear, this is not an advertisement for Gayely's. This is a review I've been wanting to write for a very long time now, approximately 1.5yrs. Every time I made this mistake of going to Sunset to save a buck or two I always end up coming out and saying \"I really have to write a review on this place that was incredibly horrible.\" Unfortunately I have better things to do but today was the last nail in the coffin. The food was so bland and the experience in there so awkward and frustrating (the antithesis of relaxing) that I said f*ck it I'm yelping it. So that is why this seems like a rambling but please to anyone reading this, try to understand how frustrated and disappointed I am with this place. Bottom line: STAY AWAY. There is Gayley's, Lakeview, the Federal, etc. all within walking distance of this monstrosity. Go there and you will be much happier.

{"text":"The place was totally dead when we walked in, unfortunately my daughter was in the midst of one of her Terrible Two's Tantrums and the waitress with short black hair & BAD MAKE-UP was not impressed at all................ooh duh children cry all the time...............Anyways she asked me to leave my stroller at the front near the entrance.............Did I mention that the place was totally EMPTY. As I was struggling to calm my daughter and leave the stroller at the front, the waitress rolled her eyes not once but several times and my friend gave me the heads up that  \"WE WERE NOT WANTED\" in this greasy dive........

So here is to the Sunset Grill at Bloor West Village indirectly across from the No Frills...............Don't be rude to potential customers because you have no idea when & where they will write a REVIEW about your Restaurant.............

Mother's with Children BEWARE you are not very welcome in this Restaurant"}
{"text":"Ive been here multiple times, its usually really busy. Today it wasnt, food arrived quickly. I had the sunset benedict and 2 buttermilk pancakes. The benedict was really good but the potatoes were saltier than normal. The pancakes were really dry, i was looking forward to them as i havent had pancakes in a really long time. The food was better previous times ive been here."}
{"text":"Come here almost every weekend, never disappointed by the food quality or service. Always get a table quickly and coffee as soon as we sit down.  Very clean restaurant and staff is friendly and knowledgeable. All the staff is fantastic, always makes me feel welcome!"}
{"text":"Food poisoning. Vomiting, diarrhoea, the whole nine yards. I haven't been this sick in twenty years. Never again."}
{"text":"I love this particular location of Sunset Grill. I dine here often with my colleagues, and we are warmly welcomed each time we come to the restaurant. I've tried many different dishes off both the breakfast and lunch parts of the menu. The greek salad with chicken is good, as are the omelettes. The only complaint I would have is that the home fries are kind of soggy, so I often substitute tomato slices or veggies and dip."}
{"text":"Solid breakfast spot.  Get there early to avoid the weekend lineups.  A bit pricey if you get premium items like fresh squeezed OJ or real maple syrup but all around one of the best breakfast spots around.  +s: big portions, eggs bene, good service.  -s: lineups if you're there after 10."}
{"text":"Food is medicore.  Like McDonald's food (tastewise) without the containers and costs alot more.  Staff is friendly.  What makes this a 1 to me is not only the extremely high price but charging us for things we didn't order"}
{"text":"Service ranges from exasperating to stellar at this location. It just depends on whom you get.  Most of the regular servers are in the \"stellar\" range...attentive, but never intrusive and genuinely friendly.

The omelettes are loaded and tasty.  The pancakes are huge in size, but light.  I like the bacon, but my friend does not.  I like my bacon crisp and not fatty...he prefers it more on the greasy side.  The eggs are a smaller size, but I like them that way.

The homefries are made from scratch.  Usually, they are delicious, but if they are too busy, they tend not to allow the potatoes enough time to form that golden crustiness that I love in homefries.

This is a solid, reliable place to get your breakfast food fix downtown."}
{"text":"The most inconsistent restaurant I have ever experienced!!
For their basic eggs and peameal (all day breakfast) the portions for peameal changes all the time. 2 slices one day, 3 slices the next.
For a restaurant with fairly basic menu, they seem to have a problem ordering inventory.
They have run out off tomatoes, and yesterday....mustard!

The servers are friendly and pleasant.  It's too bad about obvious disorganization behind the scene."}
{"text":"This place is one of my absolute fav spots for breakfast. It's well worth the trek out to the Beaches for their amazing waffles, eggs and french toast. The place is somewhat small and there is almost always a wait on the weekends, but tables turn fast. If you can get there during the week you really get to appreciate the small Mom and Pop feel of the place over a great endless cup of coffee. It's right on the Queen East Beaches strip with shops and parks all around for a leisurely day after a great breakfast!
Go!"}
{"text":"Our Friday go to place!!  And sometimes Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday!  We love this place - it's close to work so it's convenient, but the staff and the food is what keeps us coming back for more!"}
{"text":"It was a rather disappointing experience. I ordered chicken and egg; chicken was okay but the home fries were stile and tasted like cardboard."}
{"text":"I would say this is more of a 3.6 star rating. I went here one day by myself and it was really busy. I was situated somewhere near the back. I did enjoy my meal here (I ordered a sandwich with some salad) and it was great. 
The service was a bit slow, but I didn't mind because I understood that it was really busy and it could get overwhelming. Whenever I did get service, the waitress was really friendly, but so were the other staff members, so that also can compensate the slightly slow service. My order came by really quickly, which was amazing considering how busy it was. I ordered and within 10-15 minutes, I got my order. Amazing!"}
{"text":"I frequent this location of Sunset Grill retaurant, and my reason for not giving it a 3 star YELP rating is that the food is edible, but honestly - not the best I've ever had.   The other day I went in for a chicken breast thinking that I'd be all healthy, but it was cooked on the same grill that saw greasy stuff, and it tasted like it too -- so much for a grilled chicken breast - it might as well have been fried. 

The burgers are pre-fab too, no home made options at this place, and the grease and sodium content in all of the food is extremely high, so I don't see myself really coming here too many times again in the future.  So all in all - ya its ok, but there is way better choices out there."}
{"text":"The good: good food and speedy service.
The bad: value compared to nearby options like sunny morning isn't there. 
The ugly: the bathrooms were gross. 

Overall, sunny morning or the grille are better options in this area."}
{"text":"Came in while waiting for my cell phone to be fixed. Just had a taco salad but it was really good! Not expensive at all but really big!! 
The ladies behind the counter are so friendly and willing to help to make my experience amazing!!! The atmosphere is so calming, it's just a nice place to have breakfast or lunch! Thank you ladies I will be back!"}
{"text":"Sunday morning, 9 am - ish, after a night of fun and enough alcohol consumption, got woken up, well more of got pushed out of bed to make breakfast. Checked fridge, not enough eggs for two. Checked coffee, no coffee. 

So we decided to drive down a couple blocks to Queen St. E, The Beach ( and yes I like to call it The Beach instead of The Beaches, one syllable shorter, easier to say and sounds cooler). Was hard to find a parking spot at first but after 5 minutes or so, we end up parking in front of this restaurant, with people walking and in out, like H&M or GAP on boxing day. I can smell bacon and over boiled - not poached - eggs, from the outside, so we decided to walk in. 

Luckily there is no line up, even tho the place seemed packed, we got our table right away, sat down and had our about to be devoured hangover breakfast order taken away. I had their steak and eggs, the steak is not how I really wanted it, but my friend ordered it for me as I went to the bathroom ( and there's this bathroom story later). She got me medium - well, but its ok, it's a breakfast steak, can't expect too much. My over easy eggs were over easy, home fries were seasoned nicely, and my brown toast were brown and nicely toasted. The lovely lady who served our table were lovely, friendly and very pleasant. My friend seemed to have enjoyed here breakfast, can't really remember what she had. Service was quick and fast, it was quast. They don't accept debit though, so bring cash. Its cheap, so you will not need to bring a lot, our bill end up around $20.00, so its not bad at all, and you get to walk around and enjoy The Beach!

The Bathroom Story:

I went to the bathroom, did my thing (the thing where I have to stand up and release some waste fluid out of my body, and not the dirty alone lonely thing), then suddenly I heard noises, farm noises! There was a cow, chicken, hmm maybe horses. I opened the cubicle, thinking maybe there's some kind of a farm in there , and making sure I'm not drunk still or something. But it was empty, nothing! Then the cow mooooooed again, I looked up and there's a speaker on top, they play farm noises in the bathroom, weird thing to play but gave me a story to tell."}
{"text":"My first time there today, WILL NEVER GO BACK AGAIN!! THE SERVICE WAS AWFUL. The waitress (especially the one with long straight hair) knew we were there because she looked at us more than two times but she just kept ignoring us. I was totally appalled by her impoliteness. We all have our bad days but customers expect to be treated with dignity and respect. If I was the owner, I would fire her right away!! TERRIBLE SERVICE!!!!!"}
{"text":"We live in the area, food was great and the service was amazing. All the servers are so friendly. Big fan of Sunset  grill, cause the menu is so versatile. Too much food on the plates if you ask me..."}
{"text":"I was personally really excited to see this open at the CBC building as it is very close to my workplace. The service is great and the prices are relatively cheaper compared to nearby all day breakfast places.

I almost always get the 3 eggs which comes with 2 toasts (white/ whole wheat/ rye) and home fries. This location does their home fries pretty well as they are not burnt or under cooked unlike some other Sunset Grill locations I tried. If you can make it before 11 am than you can get this breakfast as special for $4.99 otherwise, I think its $1 more which is still pretty cheap."}
{"text":"Bigger portions compared to its downtown locations and friendly service. Came here for early breakfast and was seated immediately. As per usual, I got the 3 eggs which includes home fries, toast with butter (no salt on eggs/ home fries as it gets too salty a lot of times) and coffee. The food arrived quickly and they always made sure that you had enough coffee which was great. I find myself flagging a server down multiple times for refill in many other locations.

The bill worked out to be around $8 per person which was pretty good price and had the toast remaining for take out (aka lunch). Definitely come early before the breakfast rush (around 10am ) as it does tend to get really busy!"}
{"text":"Ordered pancakes and waffles. Being a breakfast place, really disappointed with the food. It was doughy and bad"}
{"text":"I came here recently to try the french toasts and they were not bad. I would say the food here is no difference from any other breakfast restaurants. Sure I have tasted better but weird enough if I was looking for breakfast in the morning the first place I would think of would be Sunset Grill, but I would probably try a different location.

The store itself in here is very small compared to other ones I have seen. It does not get as much business and does not look as professional as the others. But this one does have a back patio which a few do not. 

Nothing really special, just ordinary breakfast.

Overall, I give this location of Sunset Grill 2 stars, simply because though the food was alright and itself should have been a 3 star. The environment and the inside has brought the rating down to a 2."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a quick breakfast before work. Have visited Sunset Grill half a dozen times in the last year. 

Coffee is great and the servers make sure to keep your cup topped up. The menu is simple and straightforward - nothing fancy, which is perfect. The price is right - two can easily have breakfast for under $15. I've ordered a few different things from the menu and have never been disappointed, the portions are generous and the food is decent. I also love that they have a \"light\" menu - if you don't want to fill up on fries first thing in the morning, swap for a bowl of fresh fruit.

Unlike other reviewers, I have never had a problem with waiting for a seat. Same goes for the service: maybe it's not the warmest I've experienced, but the staff are anything but rude.

Will visit again."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast with my boy and was put off by the brisk attitude of the wait staff. 

My sons pancakes were good,  but my omelet and bacon were both over cooked and greasy."}
{"text":"This is a great all-day (until 3pm) breakfast place.  For Ajax, this feels like an authentic greasy spoon diner, run by a mom and pop kind of rabble.  The servers are friendly, without getting into your business and the food comes quick and at a good price.
Although it can be busy at times the line goes quickly.
The food is always the same and the serving sizes are generous.  I usually get the same thing every time I go but sometimes I feel adventurous  and go off script which has never been a disappointment.
This place offers good value and an old school atmosphere that is slowly dying in Toronto and not present in the big box / franchise land of Ajax"}
{"text":"Left after being ignored by staff. Waited 15 mins didn't get offered any coffee. Watched 3 staff members clear a table beside us while we got zero service. It's a shame because it was great in a pinch for a greasy breakfast. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to breakfast this morning with my 2 nieces and my toddler and we had a very good experience.  The service was very good. Our server was very pleasant and entertained everyone at the table.

The food was all great.  I really enjoyed the corned beef hash and the gluten free toast that was available was certainly a plus.  As a person with celiac disease, I have pretty much given up on ever having toast and when I alerted the server to my allergy, he let me know about the gluten free option!  I was over the moon!  My niece's french toast was huge and looked delicious, as did the rest of the table's food.  We were all very happy.  

A wonderful experience overall.  I will be happy to return!"}
{"text":"Sunset Grill is a pretty standard breakfast/lunch place. The pluses are that there is a ton of space & seating and plenty of it is lovely window seating which provides you a great view of the waterfront & river adjacent to the location. The waiting staff is always good, they check in often and make sure the meal is ok. Portions here are well sized, I usually get the omelette and they take up most of a large plate. Usually I will leave full. They are somewhat lacking in innovation & different flavors but they stick to what they know."}
{"text":"The food is alright, but EVERY time we go there we wait at the front door for about 5 minutes while we get ignored by multiple waitresses, before somebody bothers to seat us (or even acknowledge us). The last time this happened, the waitress who clearly should have been seating us was instead choosing to have a long conversation with a friend of hers, less that four feet away. She didn't even look at us.

This restaurant seriously needs somebody greeting customers as they come in, and seating them immediately if there is seating available. At minimum, ANY waitress that passes somebody waiting at the door should at least have the courtesy to say \"we'll be with you in a minute.\"

I get that they're busy, but Bloor West has a lot of Brunch options, many of them better than the Sunset (Good Forks is way busier, but has phenomenal service). Also, I've been to the Sunset Grill downtown many times, which is A LOT busier than this one, and I have never had this problem there. They run it like a customer-friendly, well-oiled machine. This place, by comparison, is sloppy.

I like eggs Benedict, but after several attempts to give this place a chance, I'm probably never bothering again."}
{"text":"The service was good and the food didn't take long at all to arrive which was nice. The food is always good although the home fries could have been done much better. Basically a pile of chopped, partially mashed and barely cooked potatoes. The rest is always good and the coffee is noticeably tasty."}
{"text":"This is a great place to relax and have a couple of beers by the water.  Very relaxed atmosphere, picnic tables, shorts and t-shirts. I have only eaten here once, I got the cheeseburger and it was pretty good."}
{"text":"I came here because there's always a line on weekends. So I thought, this must be really good! I'm wrong.

This is your typical neighborhood joint to go to when you feel too lazy to go anywhere farther so you'd rather settle for sub-par food. Very typical and uninspiring dishes, average services and prices. Will not go back there again."}
{"text":"I want to give more stars, I really do. The atmosphere is great during the summer and early fall. I highly suggest this place for grabbing a drink and checking out the lakeside scenery or live music that's regularly scheduled.

BUT whatever you do...do not plan to eat here! It's awful. We spent over $50'on slop. The salad sounded great, some kind of Caribbean chicken, but it was a pile iceberg lettuce with a few pieces of chicken on top, not very good. Nachos were plentiful but covered in canned nacho cheese sauce and cold chili. Wings were overcook badly but they were the only thing that at least had some potential. 

Overall really cool place to grab a drink but don't bother with the food. Menu makes it sound way better than it is."}
{"text":"We've been to this restaurant a few times, and have always been pleased. Service can sometimes be hit or miss, but the food is always delicious! We went there on Sunday, and my daughter was struggling through her day. Nothing specific, just having a tough day for a 3 year old. She sat on my lap after we'd ordered our food, and we tried to cheer her up. It wasn't working. The pouting and sniffles continued. When our food came, she looked at her plate for a few minutes, then told me \"I want to sit in my own chair.\" Then she started to eat, and her mood improved. She ate some homefries (gasp! Voluntarily eating veggies!) and some smoked salmon, and laughed when I showed her what happens when you lick a lemon.

So thank you, Sunset Grill, for making food even a moody, picky 3 year old loves! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Can you give Zero stars?
Well - that is the actual rating the sunset on Elgin Mills deserves, unfortunately I must give at least one star so I am adding my experience in detail below:
50 min wait for our order with the lame explanation that the kitchen \"lost\" our order is not really acceptable 
Neither is acceptable to wait 20 min for coffee 
But beyond all is the taste and sloppiness of the food servers to the table 
The omelet with cheese was done probably 10-15 min otherwise it is hard to explain why the cheese was cold in the omelet
My spouse ordered salmon plate which came 4 pieces of salmon, 4 onion rings (white not red as per menu) and bunch of capers to our question - it does not include bread or tomato and all this for the amount of $8 !

To top our experience was the manager (owner?) response: \" sorry, what can I do?

Well, here is suggestion - find another line of work!

Never again at this place."}
{"text":"Really good service!!! It's always packed but you're seated very quickly. The waitresses and waiters are very accommodating and friendly and the food is pretty good! Great sandwiches and eggs! I've been to other locations but this is by far the best. Overall a very good breakfast place."}
{"text":"The food was alright, I had driven 3.5 hours so anything would've tasted good at that point tho. Pancakes were good af not gonna lie. But the coffee? Absolutely atrocious"}
{"text":"Your basic breakfast joint.

Somewhat dreary in the back. Quite dated furniture and layout.

Don't go in expecting anything amazing and you will be fine. I wish there were more options on the menu."}
{"text":"Mixed feelings about this place, based on service. Most of the times I go, foods fine, and service is great GREAT, I usually am served by this tall cute girl with short hair, very sociable and knowledgeably. A couple times I was served by this other girl...and she was just HORRIBLE.. i asked for sweetener, it was like i was asking for her to give me the moon....i asked if there was a SIDE yogurt...she says \"yes\" I was served a humongous meal portion yogurt....apparently she does not understand what a side portion is and she just came off so rude. Overall the food is good, and 4 out of 5 times i get good service so I will come occasionally"}
{"text":"Probably the best breakfast restaurant I have been to.  Excellent friendly staff and fantastic food great portions - delicious and super value."}
{"text":"Breakfast special average.. I think the cook counts home fries pieces, plate half empty.. 4.99 special, 2.25 coffee.. 
Portion can improve."}
{"text":"I was excited by their menu and prices, but they are unwilling to deliver as close as 2 miles away."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly service and good breakfast.  No complaints.  I would eat here again."}
{"text":"Been here a few times, it's pretty cheap food for the most part but not a whole lot of variety on the menu.  Staff is friendly so all in all, not bad."}
{"text":"We've been to many Sunset Grill locations. Most are slightly above average, a couple are great.

This one stinks. Slow, plodding service, dirty tables, waiting 1/2 hour for a simple breakfast, dishwater coffee. 

Just had the wrong order plunked down on our table then got attitude. Paid for our coffees and walked out.

Steer clear of this location."}
{"text":"Perfectly respectable breakfast place. Average prices, average food, average service. And right around the corner, which often tips the balance when hangover decisions are being made."}
{"text":"Best roadhouse breakfast you will ever have!"}
{"text":"We had breakfast here thanks to a YELP review and we're happy we did. The service was tops and the food came out within 10mins. Piping hot and good! Great stop for a family or anyone wanting a quality breakfast."}
{"text":"The food is really good with a wide selection of breakfast options. Waiters are extremely welcoming and efficient. My only issue is that it's pretty crowded. Would recommend this to friends though!"}
{"text":"ate here a few times .  the food is  not very good.  the home fries  were under cooked and the service is generally slow.  other sunsets might be better but this one is to be avoided"}
{"text":"By far, this is the best Sunset Grill location. The service is always quick and efficient. The food is consistently great, portions are big and it's a great deal considering this location offers free coffee/tea with your selected specials.

Avoid the Runnymede location!"}
{"text":"changing my review because the last 2 times I've been here, my eggs benny have been hard when I specifically requested soft.  I'll still come because it's close to my house, but won't be tell my friends about it."}
{"text":"A very reliable place to get a delicious breakfast. The staff are always quick and friendly and serve just as you ask. The menu is limited, but you aren't there for gourmet food are you? Get your eggs and sausage and eat up, friend!

I only wish the coffee was a little better. It's very standard, but an improvement in the coffee could go a long way."}
{"text":"This is my go- to spot  for breakfast on the weekends where my family/friends and I come to catch up from the week. 

I usually keep it traditional with the 3 eggs and some kind of protein on the side. However I have tried the pancakes and they are by far the most fluffiest pancakes I have had without being too heavy. 

With the non-stop refills of coffee and the generous portions I can't complain. 

It might not be high end but if you're looking for a greasy spoon where you can get the best bang for your buck then this hits the spot !

The only downfall is that I work outside the city, and I can't take advantage of their daily breakfast specials. 

P.S. I would like to comment on the on Angelique's comment. On the debit machine you are able to select an other amount for gratuity. I have never had a problem with the staff here. Considering they moved you upon your request when a table was available away from the door, I think is actually accommodating.

Happy eating :)"}
{"text":"Not a bad spot... Very clean and presentable. Food was fast and quick. I would say French toast would be the way to go if your a toast man. Unlike the other franchises this one actually makes the French toast from scratch (some cinnamon and nutmeg would make it stellar). But ye.... If you in the area, hit it :P"}
{"text":"They serve a good, honest breakfast here. I've never had a bad experience.

For the price, the portions are large, so you don't walk away thinking you didn't get your money's worth.

I've seen people order chicken caesar salads, or even yogurt/fruit bowls, and the amount of food they received was surprising.

Don't expect anything fancy when it comes to decor or anything like that. It's a neighbourhood greasy spoon that attracts a lot of regulars and is slightly better than your average greasy spoon."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast with a friend. Food was a bit on the pricy side but the quality was excellent. I will be going back whenever I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Love the breakfast at this place! Their eggs are fantastic, the home fries are grilled to perfection and have just the right amount of seasoning on it. The portions are really great and the prices are reasonable.

My favorite breakfast is the eggs, home fries and toast, it's super delicious and they know how to cook the eggs just the right way. I've also had an egg white omelette with veggies and that was huge and delicious.

The only slightly negative feedback I have is that I wish they allowed substitutions and didn't charge $3 extra for egg whites. The other breakfast places we go to only charge $1.50 so this place charges double and I wanted to take out the onions and peppers and sub for spinach but they would've charged me an extra $2.50. That was disappointing.

Otherwise the food is fantastic, the service is attentive, it's never too loud and there is always a table. Prices are great too."}
{"text":"One of the best sunset grills I've been too.
The food is always fresh and still hot when they bring it to you.
The staff is always very welcoming."}
{"text":"Great local ambiance, average food, not worth the line up. C'mon guys this is a DINER."}
{"text":"Had the crab cake benedict with scramble eggs instead of benedict eggs with potatoes and aspragus...meal and service was great! They brought me a can coke with cup of ice for my drink order....no refills....I would eat here again"}
{"text":"Great breakfast food for a relatively cheap price.  Omelettes are tasty and fluffy - not the flat lifeless things you get at most breakfast places.   I've lived in the Beach for the last 20 years and tried them all - this is by far the best breakfast place for good food and a warm friendly atmosphere (if you like it busy and loud but not so loud you can't hear your conversation).  Granted, if you're looking for 'fancy' creative breakfast places this isn't for you. This is simple food served by friendly wait staff."}
{"text":"Rotten cucumber sticks, unwashed lettuce and tomatoes and I ended up getting food poisoning. Waited 25 minutes for my meal. I don't need a discount! I handed cash 18% to the poor busy waitress while the 3 of them stared at me blankly after I had politely mentioned about the rotten vegetables."}
{"text":"Food is bad here. They are lucky that there's no competition around. Corned beef hash and the strawberry jam taste funky. Bacon looks dehydrated"}
{"text":"Visited this place on a Sunday morning.  Had a long wait to get a table. The waitress was in a huge rush and wasn't that attentive or friendly.  Eggs Benedict were good, pea meal bacon a bit tough though. Home fries overly cooked and crunchy.  I stepped on some home fries under our table and asked the waitress if she could clean it up, she told me that she would do after we left.The decor reminded me of a high school cafeteria. No debit cards, cash only. Don't think I will be back."}
{"text":"I have never had a bad meal here. Service sometimes slow, unless you get Paula, Paula is an awesome waitress."}
{"text":"I can always rely on this chain for a tasty, well-portioned, cheap breakfast with a good variety on the menu for whatever food-mood I'm in that day.

The Yonge/Richmond branch is really nice and was surprisingly busy for an early Sunday morning close to the financial district.

The service was very friendly and helpful and the food was as good and reliable as always. I had the three eggs, home fries and toast (which for some reason was cheaper than one egg, toast and salad?! Lol weird?) and my boyfriend had French Toast with real maple syrup. Both left us refreshed, full and happy as we headed to Union for a ten hour train ride.

Would definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Being going to this location for over 20 years. Since the new owners took over it has not been the same. They don't serve egg's ben from scratch. The last visit the served the egg's ben really over cooked, burned home fries, and burned english muffin.
Peamal was so hard that it could not be cut. When addressing it they did not care.
My bill for myself and 2 children was over $40.00 for Sunday breakfast did not get a penny back, I did'nt ask and they didn't care. Their attitude was toooo Bad!
Try other places on the beacher they derserve the business."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. 

I'm just moving into the neighbourhood and came here for a noon-time breakfast on a Monday based on the reviews. 
Now, I was crazy hungry and I'm also not very picky. I ordered eggs Benny and a coffee. 
Coffee was typical diner style, nothing major or unique- which is fine by me!
My potatoes were pretty salty. I'm a salt fiend - but even I thought this might be a little much. My eggs were cooked as I asked but the hollandaise was definitely nothing to write home about. Very globby and paste-like I was a bit disappointed. Also, about half of one side of my English muffin base was super burnt. 

Now, that being said... It was still totally fine and edible but I will hope that this is not the best breakfast I have in the Beaches. 

Maybe other dishes are better. I'd come back, but get something else.

Also, poor cooks were having a lot of dishes sent back but I couldn't tell if it was by the same customer or not."}
{"text":"This is my go-to breakfast restaurant. The place isn't exactly the cleanest, i don't really like touching the menu and ketchup bottles cause they're oily. Crowded and could use a renovation, but i guess they like the \"old\" look. 

Food is marvellous! Staff are alright... 3/5, nothing special. Avoid getting seated in the back, the server that serves there isn't really friendly, i like the front tables. 

Overall, food is good, decently priced.
Service is meh
cleanliness is meh

I only keep coming back for the food!"}
{"text":"Clubhouse lunch special you cant go wrong with. Breakfast is just like every other place. Im giving the 4 stars based on the price of the lunch special considering you also get a salad on the side and the great service. Fyi they only have home fries which are always under cooked but the salad makes up for it in my mind."}
{"text":"I go to this location at least twice a month for take out. The service is fast and very friendly. When I get back to my desk my food is still hot and absolutely delicious. If you've been lining up at Cora's down the street move on down the block and check out this new Sunset Grill. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I grew up in a place where there were diners on nearly every corner, so believe me I know my diners. And this one was pretty damn good!

The food was plentiful and had just the right amount of grease that's required for a diner breakfast. The coffee was a little bleh, I've definitely had better. But that won't stop me from coming back here.

I came here for breakfast as a group of four. Almost every single egg dish comes with three eggs and a plentiful, almost unhealthy amount of bacon (please don't think I'm complaining). You really had to search hard for a plate with only two eggs. I ordered the French Connection, which totally hit the spot as I was after French toast, eggs and meats. Other dishes that were ordered included poached eggs with 5 strips of bacon and a massive Florentine Omelet that took lots of work to finish. Plus you can order rye bread as a side.

The place had a nice feel to it, mostly tables and chairs instead of bright coloured booths (although I am a fan of those, too).

Definitely bring your appetite. I came here for an early breakfast and was set until nearly dinner time. The food itself is nothing above and beyond a typical diner breakfast but is delicious nonetheless. Plus it beats making those greasy dishes at home!"}
{"text":"Chocolate chip pancakes have just the right amount of chocolate chips spread evenly and taste just right with maple syrup! Greek omelette was fluffy and delicious as well as the french toast! Kids menu great for children and adults. Would recommend this to everyone! Also portions are very big"}
{"text":"Horrible service.  On more than one occasion we've been ignored for 15 or more minutes, and when we finally get someone's attention they argued with each other \"they're not my table. They're not my table.\"

Today after waiting 10 minutes for a hello... I waved to get a waitresses attention she just smiled, winked, and continued to ignore us. 

Maybe it's because we had a baby with us - either way we felt like dirt.  Will never go back."}
{"text":"I hate choosing at breakfast so I like getting the \"everything\" breakfast that includes pancakes or french toast with bacon and eggs when I go out.  Today I chose the Sunset Super.  The pancakes were great... they were large and fluffy as advertised! It also came with 4 strips of reasonably thick bacon.  It was nice that they didn't chince out with only 2 strips of thin stuff.  

The one real knock was the \"home fries\" which were potatoes.. but were so pale they didn't look fried at all.  In fact, after seeing it on a dish being delivered to a different table, my friend decided to go with the chicken caeser salad instead of getting something with home fries.

How much I paid - $9.50 plus tax and tip (no beverage)

Good for - someone looking for a reasonably priced greasy spoon.

Will I go back? Ya there's nothing to suggest that I wouldn't go back... but I wouldn't go out of my way to go there."}
{"text":"I think like all places - it depends on when you go. Because I've gone quite a few times, some are good, some are bad. Sometimes it's super busy, other times it's not. 

Your portions are big, so you're never left feeling hungry after. The special is 3 eggs, bacon/sasauge, home fries, toast and tea/coffee. It's fast service and the staff has been nice overall. 

Definitely the best place for a Sunday morning cure!"}
{"text":"This sunset grill is really good, this was the first sunset grill I ever visited. It was so yummy!!  I tried to go to the sunset grill closer to home at Kingston and morningside but their food just didn't compare, it actually kind of sucked.  So now this is the only location I go to, food and service is always quick and delicious."}
{"text":"Decided to go here cause Denny's was packed. Honestly could not have been happier. Service was the best I've had in a long time. 

The staff was nice and friendly and very easy to talk to. The food was filling and delicious, grab the combo plate they offer!!

Definitely willing to come back, the atmosphere itself was inviting. Only drawback was the place was a bit small, but that was barely noticeable once seated."}
{"text":"I went to this place around noon on a Saturday initially looking for a hot cup of coffee and a quick bite to eat. When I got there it was jam packed with a waiting line 6 deep so it took a while for the tables to turn over before I got seated and into my 1st cup of coffee and ordered the Big breakfast. By the 3rd cup however still no food and the waitress actually came by and asked me if I wanted my bill??? 
I laughed and told her I hadn't even actually received my food yet to which she was quite flustered and profusely apologetic. The food came quickly after that with an extra piece of bacon lol
The food in general was pretty good. Your standard fare of 2 eggs, bacon, potatoes and pancakes. Can't really go wrong. 
Now I know a lot of people would have deducted points for the delivery of food mistake but I am old school. I was raised in an era where people make honest mistakes all the time. No harm. No foul. 
But I'm appalled and embarrassed about all these self entitled condescending a-holes that have zero ounce of humanity for food servers in an obviously busy environment. 
I left a $5 tip on the table and went to pay for my meal at the cashier where low and behold a woman was arguing with the cashier about her service and demanding some kind of compensation. 
Seriously lady. Get over yourself. 
This is why I hardly go out to eat... not because of the food/food service but because of all the stuck up crybabies that visit them. 
/end rant"}
{"text":"Simple, cheap breakfast. No frill, no nonsense. Just cheap, good bacon and eggs. I've been really getting into the eggs sunset, which is their version of eggs benedict."}
{"text":"I discover what peameal is all about. Sad part is that peameal is not available here in the States."}
{"text":"I used to come often to the Sunset Grill here in the beach, but in recent years not so much.  Brunching here last Sunday reminded me of why I've been away so long.  Pretty much whatever you order defines the term \"greasy spoon\" and that's exactly how I felt for the rest of the afternoon.  Ten years ago this greasy spoon was standard fare, but nowadays there are a couple of healthier brunch joints right on Queen East.  Oh well, give a nod to the nostalgia but now there's better."}
{"text":"We live in the area and while there are tons of amazing breakfast places, we seem to go here when my husband's parents are in town. They are 'safe eaters' so this usually does the trick. Not anymore. I can no longer stand to go here as the food is just too bland and terrible. The line cooks could care less what they are putting out and all the waitresses are wearing their sweatpants and complaining loudly about customers. They were even making FUN of an older woman when we were in there. Bad food is one thing, but bad service and AWFUL comments being made by employees is just ridiculous and shouldn't happen. I'll never go back...ever."}
{"text":"Pros:

- a rather old fashioned traditional restaurant 
- very good food
- excellent seaside location 
- good service 

Cons:

 - regrettably no outside dining
- pricy 
- can be quite crowded....too many tables squeezed in
- they don't take reservations for less than 6 people

A place \"for the special occasion\"."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and was stuck in a corner.  The waitress came by the tables around me and ignored my table.  She then proceeded to have a lengthy conversation with the table in font of me.  I got up and left.  Bad customer service"}
{"text":"The breakfast tasted delicious and cooked perfectly, the employees were very polite and they have  great customer service. The prices were also reasonable but It gets a little busy at times but its worth the wait."}
{"text":"I have ordered lunch here several times.  Everytime I get it delivered, the food is good, but the fry's are soggy.  Still a great meal and the prices are good.  I wouldn't recommend the salads, but the sandwiches are great!  I haven't tried much else, but I'm still expanding my food horizons!"}
{"text":"This place is a great example of why good service matters. The servers are all so nice and friendly and helpful! I like that you can get a giant breakfast full of stuff to fill you up any way you like and it's always served fast and with a smile. Coffee refills keep coming and children are accommodated well. We've been at least half a dozen times over the last couple of weeks and will continue to give these guys our business as they really deserve it, they provide such great service."}
{"text":"The first time I went I have very good service so I decided go again but the second time I came here they have a old lady ignored me three time when I want order food , also I asked the sauce to two different lady but they totally forgot , when they clean my desk I want order pancake to go but the old lady just clean up and left and give me a receipt, I feel so sad . The food is delicious but the service was really really bad ......"}
{"text":"Great little breakfast place near our hotel. If you go there make sure you want three eggs. That's the norm. The bacon was crispy, the eggs were runny and the pancakes were fluffy. Homefries could've been crispier but that's just a personal preference. Friend had the crab cakes eggs Benedict. He couldn't stop raving about how good the were. Portion size is excellent for the money. Definitely would go back."}
{"text":"I stopped in for breakfast which was very good and brought out in a little over 5 minutes. The restaurant was very clean and the portions very generous. I will definitely come back when in the area."}
{"text":"Went in at 8 am,  got seat right away,  and ordered right away.  Friendly service.  Food was delicious and I was stuffed after eating.  Definitely will go back."}
{"text":"Pretty wide selection of omelettes. I had the meat-lovers omelette which comes with peameal bacon, bacon, cheddar cheese and hash browns. Portions are pretty massive, but the quality isn't that great. At least the coffee is bottomless."}
{"text":"Sunset Grill is my go-to breakfast place near work.  I regularly come here with co-workers for a quick meal.  They have pretty average run of the mill food but their service is impeccably fast.  Although the food isn't amazing, it's nice to have a breakfast that isn't completely soaked in grease.  Prices are more than reasonable as well."}
{"text":"Really nice, good omelet, nice service and good value for your$$. Portions are generous. I like the open kitchen."}
{"text":"Great service with the waitresses, they make this location special.  Shortly after sitting down, she already had a coffee chambered for my grandpa. 

The staff works as a team and you can tell by the great service we received."}
{"text":"Great breakfast with huge portions. Had the Western Omelette and couldn't finish it. Price is right too. Two complete breakfasts for $26.
I would definitely be a regular there if I lived here."}
{"text":"Work had sent me to Toronto for the weekend and this place served me my first Toronto meal. Gotta say, it was a pretty good start.

I had just finished a 6-hour long greyhound ride from Montreal (took the bus option over flying-- never again), and unfortunately the outlets weren't working so I couldn't charge my phone. By the time I got to Toronto, I had 2% battery life left and check -in wasn't til 1. I quickly Yelp'd the nearest (yet good quality) breakfast joint and cue: Sunset Grill.

The host was kind enough to sit me near a power outlet so that I could restore life to my phone. I ordered the 3 eggs, hash browns, bacon, toast combo with coffee. It was a pretty busy morning but the food came within a reasonable time. 

The food itself was delicious. Eggs over easy were made fairly well, not 2, BUT 4 strips of crispy delicious goodness bacon fried in perfect strips, great potatoes (although I thought they'd be fries because the menu said home style fries), and 2 slices of toast cut diagonally into 4 pieces and already buttered. The coffee was good too, very strong, just the way I like it.

The service was alright. I was not checked up on until I had finished my meal (no coffee refills, no water refills). The waiter also didn't tell me that I pay at the front; I was foolishly waiting at my table with the bill for a good 10 minutes. To be fair, it was a very busy day. Buuuut to be fair to me, I'm still paying the same amount on that busy day as someone else would on a slow day so I expect that we're paying for the same service. 

All in all, delicious food but just okay service. I imagine the service would be fantastic on a slower day because the waitstaff, in general, were pretty friendly."}
{"text":"Second time at this location, service was excellent. Staff well informed and friendly. The food was yummy...atmosphere is relaxed. I felt very comfortable and enjoyed all it had to offer.  I will definitely go back, I am looking forward to my next visit.  Leaving with a sucker was the bonus part for me...lol."}
{"text":"This particular location used to be Just Desserts, right before they went bust.  The location is right by the waters, where the rich yacht boys roam about.  There are a lot of trendy-wannabe restaurants in the area, along with an unusual high number of tanning salons.  I think you get the demographics.

The restaurant can seat up to about 50 customers and is setup in a very typical diner style, with addition of big windows all around.  As far as cleanliness goes, it is not dirty, but not spotless either.

Food is very standard, but nothing really stands out aside from the thick crispy bacon.  Everything else was pretty forgetful.  You probably would never crave this place for breakfast... just one of those places you go to and fill up.

Just like the food, the staff is neither friendly or disgruntled.  Standard issue service here (\"I wonder how many hours left until home time\"), and a couple reminders were needed for coffee refills.

Prices are about 30-40% less than Cora's; about $10 per person should suffice, depending on your appetite."}
{"text":"Freebird! Never have so many ears been assaulted by so many meathead mulleted 80's cover bands in succession for so long. Clear Channel approved purgatory of classic rock wastes the best located bar in the entire Midwest. Food tastes like it was left on the bar in 1986, too. If the \"Redneck Country Band\" doesn't scratch the itch on your ass, perhaps Colin Dussault's seven thousandth performance of Stairway to Heaven will. Take your beer, leave, walk to the lakeshore, and thank your almighty savior you were warned. Cleveland Cliche at its worst - take a great thing, cover it with worn out horseshit Musak doesn't even try to sell anymore, and pretend it's the fucking Louvre."}
{"text":"Came here with some friends on a Sunday morning. It got really busy around 10 am but we beat that rush. Thr atmosphere felt very much like a Tim Hortons patio. Not very cozy. When all the tables are filled with people it also feels a little crowded. We ordered the eggs Florentine, and French connection. All the  eggs were correctly cooked but the hollandaise sauce was a little bland on the Florentine.  Also the home fries could have been crispier.  The service was friendly and mostly attentive. It's probably the better breakfast place I've been to outside of the city."}
{"text":"Save yourself the time and money! I understand that this a chain breakfast joint and I wasn't expecting a high end breakfast, just simple eggs and bacon and potatoes. But they cant even get that right. The potatoes were super dry and starchy and arrived cool to the touch; eggs over cooked. Ham and bacon was fine. Server was good too, she offered us a free fruit cup for the lousy breakfast but this is our second time (same issues the first time) at this location because it's 3 mins from our home and will never return again."}
{"text":"Great breakfast here. My parents have been taking me here on the weekends for 25+ years. Cheap and exactly what you need for your morning craving. Only downfall is the operating hours and machine powder juices."}
{"text":"Excellent service friendly staff , Sunday's were jammed packed . The eggs Benedict with crabcakes were amazingly delicious!"}
{"text":"I love the Sunset Grill on Laird, so I've tried this one a few times.  It's quite terrible. I ordered the strawberry supreme pancakes, which was actually 5 giant dry box-mix pancakes with about 6 strawberry slices, a tiny bit of jam, and whipped cream. AND it was about $10. Worst breakfast I've ever had."}
{"text":"They flatten their bacon here. Amazing.

No, really, they throw those bad boys on the grill and put what appear to be iron presses on top as they cook so they come out perfectly long and flat. None of this shrivelled wrinkled crap.

Prices are definitely very reasonable - for about 8 bucks you can get 2 slices of french toast (or pancakes), eggs, bacon AND sausage (don't you hate when they make you choose? It's freedom here!).

The brunch options here are not mind-blowing by any means, but they definitely hit the spot for a well-made, proper breakie. Agree with Kat F. on the busy factor. We swung by around noon on a weekday and the place was bustling with families and couples abound. Doesn't anyone work anymore?"}
{"text":"4 stars - food was excellent and priced well. Our server left a lot to be desired, which is why I didn't give it 5 stars. The other employees were friendly, though."}
{"text":"I would definitely recommend Sunset to anyone looking to have a nice/peaceful and filling breakfast with friends or family! 

For all the times I have visited this location for breakfast, I have had exceptional customer service! The staff is very friendly and kind! I remember on one occasion, there debit/credit machine was down and the manager actually let us leave the restaurant to get cash and return later to pay. Made me feel like a trusted and valued customer! 

During all my visits, Ive always got an omelette with a side of potato wedges and toast. I find the food is always well cooked and served in a large portion for a good price of 10-14$. The restaurant is also kept quite neat and clean, a bonus considering how busy this place can get."}
{"text":"Almost didn't want to review this place so I could keep it to myself lol.... but I love it! The staff are super welcoming and friendly. The dining space is a good size surrounded by glass windows to enjoy the beautiful morning sunshine! 

Arrived just a little past 11am on a Friday. My cousin and I both ordered the same thing which was 3 eggs with sausage, home fries and rye toast ($7.49). I got mine over easy and she got hers sunnyside up. My other cousin ordered their eggs sunset which is basically their version of eggs benedict. The hollandaise was broken and lumpy but my cousin said the flavour was spot on. The eggs were perfectly cooked to the way we ordered them and the staff made us feel at home. We also ordered a stack of pancakes ($5.49/3) to share since we each wanted one. When we were almost finished eating our own dishes, the pancakes were untouched. Our waitress noticed and let us know that she could help us warm them up on the griddle again since they got cold. We just ate them as is but she was willing to go the extra mile and I thought it was a very nice gesture. 

Everything about the atmosphere, food and servers was so familiar and comforting it ultimately made our dining experience that much more enjoyable. 

Without a doubt, will be back! If you're into standard, wholesome and delicious breakfast with fast and friendly service, definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Everything is excellent!!!
Went with my wife and 2 friends. 
I really enjoyed the French Connection. 
I'm glad Sunset Grill opened in our area."}
{"text":"Exceptionally well run cafe, well organized and staffed. The French toast was terrific. Stopped by for a quick meal, very satisfying."}
{"text":"It's really good food and very clean and great customer service but try not going on Sunday around noon because that's when it is extremely busy and can get a little too loud"}
{"text":"Wandering to find a place to have lunch and stumbled upon this place.  It looks similar to Cora but the first thing I noticed is the tables and chairs are sticky.  The open kitchen fans are not really powerful.

The waitress are good to always around us waiting for us to make a final decision.  

The Sunset Pancakes Supreme which served with fresh strawberries, strawberry preserves and whipped cream is sufficient to fill my stomach.  The pancakes are soft and layered them with whipped cream and maple syrup in between makes them taste so yummy.    The Benedict looks good but I did not try it.

Not a bad place to grab a lunch but not wearing clean or light pant sitting on the sticky chair!"}
{"text":"My wife's omelette  took about 25 minutes, when we asked the waitress to check on it we were told the grill is only so big, and it depends on what they are making!! ??? This is a breakfast place, what do you think they are making. It was just OK, not sure I would come back to this one."}
{"text":"I don't want to hate but honestly not my favourite place to go for breakfast.

I was there this past sunday and we had to wait forever for our food and it wasn't very good. I've been to the Sunset Grill in Blue Mountain a few times as well and don't ever enjoy it. 

However, I have to say they're fairly priced...weekdays especially they have very cheap breakfasts!"}
{"text":"Sunset Grill has always been a go-to for me.

This location in particular features very friendly staff, but not a lot of space... Large parties are hard to find space for. 

Still a very wonderful location. Close by a lot of stores, a theatre and a bookstore."}
{"text":"Been to a few places
This is one of the best Sunset grill, great taste, big portion, great environment.
We would come back any time."}
{"text":"Eggs benedict to die for breakfast like you would serve yourself at home good portions lots of home fries they now take debit not just cash anymore most of the staff have been there for many many years which is always a good sign in the restaurant"}
{"text":"Food and service is excellent. Sunset is a very busy restaurant and any lineups move fast."}
{"text":"Sunset Grill. Like many other locations, the stockyards location satisfies their following with their typical menu surrounded by typical breakfast foods. Now unlike many other locations, the one at stockyards actually has the luxury of a bigger space for customers, especially for the rather long folks like myself. anyhow if your near the Stockyards area this seems to be a rather decent choice for breakfast at any given time of day. I rate it."}
{"text":"This place has to be the most inconsistent place when it comes to service.  As soon as they have more than a few customers, the service breaks down.  I would come back....only if no one else was eating there."}
{"text":"Be truly honest here, not a good breakfast place. Although shootout dings and seating are great, and so does services, they are nice and fast. But the breakfast there aren't really good. Scrambled eggs taste weird and dry, ham is super salty and the sausage as well. French toast is the only good one there."}
{"text":"Love this place. Good food and the friendliest service I've ever had. 
Eggs Florentine are delicious and their portions will definitely satisfy. 
One of the better food choices in the Plaza"}
{"text":"Was looking for a place to grab a bite to eat before bouldering at Refuge Climbing Gym and discovered this little restaurant. Ordered the French Dip, was delicious and also came with an order of fruit. Prices are very reasonable. Definitely recommend if youre looking for a place to eat lunch or breakfast."}
{"text":"Good consistent breakfast and friendly service. A usual for anyone who lives in the area."}
{"text":"Great service! Really nice waitresses and food came perfect timing, I was very pleased with everything:)"}
{"text":"Seem a busy place.  Staffs are working hard. cleaning up and refill coffee. From I ordered to the meal arrived. It took 14mins.."}
{"text":"I'd give it 5 stars, but my steak tasted like a leaf of lettuce....absolutely no flavour...restaurants insist not using any salt, or marinade to grill their meats, and they taste like nothing. 
Everything else was spot on though, eggs were good, sausage was good, and the fries were fine too. Waitress was very attentive, and was constantly topping off our coffees. I definitely recommend their breakfast, but not the steak...just get extra bacon, or sausage instead."}
{"text":"This place is affordable and has a good selection of traditional breakfast dishes and fruit/low cal alternatives. The staff are friendly and want to accomodate customers. 

Draw backs

1. You have to arrive early. It's usually  
    busy and getting a good seat is not
     always guaranteed       
2.  Not the place for a quit breakfast. A lot 
     of friendly chatter and families

Over all, the wait is not long compared to Coras. And the food comes quickly after 
ordering and it good. I recommend sunset grill 
Ajax. Breakfast for 2 $20.00 with tip."}
{"text":"The service here is terrible, very poor. 
We got seated. The restaurant was not too busy with many waitresses working;  Then our waitress comes.  No introduction, no hello, no greeting.  Just \"what do you want to drink?\"  we said coffee with milk and glass of water, but then she literally ran off, before we had a chance to say we were ready to order.   She came back 10 min later with coffee, and brought cream instead and forgot the water. She ran off again without taking order, even though we said we were ready.   She didn't come back again for another 10 minutes.    Suffice it to say we got up and left.  

It is sad.  If you don't have the most basic skills of waiting on people.  If you can't even say hello to customers, then this is not the right job for you.  
It's called \"waiting\" on people, not cutting them short and running off.  
Too bad the manager doesn't teach the waiting staff to properly wait on clients, and if they don't dismiss them."}
{"text":"Classic breakfast fare. Good sized portions and friendly service. The only downside was that there was a bit of a wait, due to its popularity, and inside it can be a little cramped. Other than that they do what they do well."}
{"text":"Sunset Grill is conveniently located in my office building complex. I only knew it existed because I drop the rent check next door at the property management office. My husband had dropped me off at work because my car was in the shop AND I had inconveniently forgotten my lunch at home so I was stranded and hungry. I decided to give Sunset Grill a try and it turned out to be a good decision. The menu is pretty extensive for the size of the place. I called in my order and left right away to walk over. My food was ready when I got there. The staff was friendly and there were several people dining at tables (even at 1:30 pm). 

I ordered the Southwest Ciabatta Sandwich with fries. The fries were kind of cold, but still had good flavor. I'm not a huge fan of \"breaded\" fries so maybe next time I'll try a different side. The sandwich was warm, flavorful and the perfect size. 

I didn't give it more stars because the tomatoes were pretty yellow (aka not ripe) and while I will come back if I need a close, decent place, it was just kind of average."}
{"text":"I've always managed to visit this restaurant at just the right time to not have to wait for a table. This location does get very busy during the peak times on Saturdays and Sundays. The wait staff are nice and the food was as expected with service pretty quick! Great little place if you want breakfast!"}
{"text":"The French toast is de-licioussss! They make it a bit different compared to the Scarborough location and it's so good!  Visited twice so far and the service on the first time was on point. Quick attention and food. 2nd time around not so much. We were kinda disappointed and didn't get refills of coffee fast enough before we left and also we were missing toast.  Despite telling our waitress we still didn't receive and no discount offered on the bill - only downfall.  Will definitely check it out again and hope for an experience like the first visit."}
{"text":"The food here is just okay, the coffee is terrible, but we go often to this place for breakfast, only because choices aren't many in the area.  But after our last experience we will not go again. We just finished having breakfast and while we were talking for a few minutes, the owner of the restaurant came by and showed me where to pay, in a way that I thought we were being kicked out, so I asked the man at the cash register, \"did he just ask us to leave?\" He said \"yes\". Well there was no line up, empty tables and we weren't drinking any more coffee.  Last time we will ever go there!!"}
{"text":"Let me say that the food is fine. Portions are good and everything tastes good. It's the not best breakfast place around (try Cora's or Pickle Barrel), but it's certainly good.

The reason I don't go there anymore is that we were waiting in line once and watching a waitress bundle cutlery while wiping her nose with the back of her hand and wiping down the spoons with the nastiest dirty towel. We simply walked out and have never returned."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast. Delicious food, great service and very clean. 
I would highly recommend the blueberry pancakes."}
{"text":"I was out by the Beach with a friend from Vancouver so we decided turn to Yelp to guide our breakfast choice. 

I know that this is a grill/diner experience, so I have to adjust my expectations to meet this type of setting, but breakfast was really nothing special at all.

I was really looking forward to these homefries someone raved about. I guess to each's own. The potatoes were basically boiled and lightly grilled with some paprika sprinkled on top. They were boring. 

I found the menu to be pretty standard and it seemed like the same ingredients were repeated in different arrangements in different omelets and fritattas, but there wasn't really anything that caught my eye or I felt was out of the ordinary. 

The one bonus point I might be able to give is the egg-white options for those who are looking for healthy choices."}
{"text":"Friendly and attentive staff. A bit overpriced for what it is. Good quality burger and fries."}
{"text":"The fresh orange juice was so good. Big plates with reasonable prices."}
{"text":"This is my favourite sunset grill so far! It's the cleanest, has the best atmosphere with the friendliest staff! 

I got the eggs sunset,  and asked for added spinach. The portion is generous-worth the price and it did not disappoint! The eggs were the perfectly cooked (asked for overeasy),  delicious home fries and they did not cheap out on the hollandaise sauce. My boyfriend got the sunset super,  which he was very pleased with. He's very particular with his pancakes but they were delicious- fluffy, soft and moist! 

Our server Sarah was great! She was knowledgeable and attentive. Definitely will be coming back here very soon!"}
{"text":"Came here twice for brunch and both times Sunset delivered!

Clean, friendly service and good food. 

If you're looking for a simple brunch place, they have all your regular breakfast needs for a very reasonable price. They've even upped their game by having a crab cakes benedict ($14.99), which was surprisingly good.  

Service was friendly,  a little bit on the slower side but manageable. 

Definitely one of the better sunsets I've been to. Hope they keep it up!"}
{"text":"Standard chain breakfast joint. The eggs benny were a bit disappointing, but edible. Definitely better than getting your breakfast at McDonald's, but not worth going out of your way."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come here all the time. It's our favourite place to eat breakfast.  We both always get the All Day Breakfast with scrambled eggs, sausage, home fries, and toast.  I love all of it. 
  Yes, it is not for people who are looking to eat healthy. If you want to eat fruit and egg whites for breakfast, don't go here. But it's not too greasy to the point of being disgusting. I've never been sick from it and the portions are massive. I usually end up eating the rest of the meal later on in the day. 
  The service is good. We've gotten take-out once and it was fast and delicious as always.  It would be nice if they took debit, I guess, but a $20 bill is always enough for the two of us."}
{"text":"NEW OWNERS NEW ONNERS NEW OWNERS 

This being said same decor a lot of new staff. 
This place has made a comeback. The vibe is better the food is better the staff attitude is better and the New Owner is Better. So if it's been awhile for you. It's time to come back to this smaller franchise restaurant that is making them proud.  Breakfast is still to expensive but at least this place is 100% consistent with their food. 

Good views of the lake and the other breakfast place across the road which is empty for a reason. This is the new truth in this place. 
Way to go on the comeback. :-)"}
{"text":"Clean, friendly and timely service.  The manager was very approachable and appeared sincerely grateful for our visit.  Good food.  Good portion size.
Would go again."}
{"text":"Affordable, always a line up out the door and portions are good.  I've had their omlettes."}
{"text":"This restaurant is recommended!

I went early on a busy Saturday, and despite all the busy tables and bustling staff, we were treated in a very friendly manner. Prices are good for all the delicious food you get, and the waitresses almost constantly refill your coffee as they pass by."}
{"text":"As a caveat, this review is for the Queen St East location, near Kew Beach.
At first it looked inviting, service was friendly and quick.  However, the ventilation is not great and there is a haze of smoke that permeates everything.  We ordered the spicy omelette and the spicy frittata, with the latter having only egg whites.  Both arrived with very large chunks of tomatoes and jalepeno peppers which made the egg dishes wet and unappetizing.  
On the positive side, the portions were generous and the coffee was decent."}
{"text":"Paper thin bacon - Take a pass on this place if you like bacon - NOTE:  Wouldn't let me post because my review was too short, so all I have to add is, \"Paper thin bacon - Take a pass on this place if you like bacon\""}
{"text":"Good Service. Clean enough. Food came out quickly. Had an omelette. Not bad. Coffee is starkly inferior though.  Nice relaxed atmosphere. Will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"A very good place to have a brunch on weekends. I had Florentine Omelette, A tasty h omlette with cheese and baby  fresh spinach dish and bunch of potato.It was really great. My husband had Veggie Delight and it was really good as well.We will be back definitely."}
{"text":"Benedicts are good, sandwiches are good, but whatever you do don't get the hashbrowns because those are super stale and gross"}
{"text":"Another location of the expanding Sunset Grill franchise, this one is actually located at the North-East corner of the CBC building on Wellington, right next to the Ritz. 

While some poor saps are freezing in line for Cora's, there's no lineups at Sunset Grill. We ordered the Sunset Omelette ($10.99) and a 3-egg breakfast with bacon ($7.99). Both came with home fries and pre-buttered choice of toast (white, brown, or wholegrain rye). The home fries weren't anything special (I prefer mine a bit crispy). Based on the 3-egg breakfast, the omelette must have been made with a minimum of 5-6 eggs with a hefty amount of peameal bacon and Swiss cheese; large enough to satisfy a pregnant woman. Four strips of 6 inch long, 1 inch wide bacon was tasty and crispy, and surprisingly, wasn't dripping with grease, giving the entire meal a wholesome feeling. Round everything off with a standard breakfast drip coffee and quick service, this place won't blow away your taste buds but who needs to be blown away by brunch after a long night out on the town.  Interior was bright and clean and the staff courteous and attentive to our depleting coffee levels. I seriously considered giving this place 3 stars just to ward off massive crowds from encroaching on this place.

{"text":"I've been to this location multiple times and they are always packed but even though there are dealing with a lot of people they still seem to give great customer service. The food hear has never failed my taste buds it always taste amazing. Also the price is very affordable if your feeling for some breakfast. I suggest that you get to sunset early if you don't want to wait it will get busy on the weekend. Other than that this place is hands down my favorite breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Not a lot of places near Bloor and Yonge open at 7am for breakfast, and the hotel had a coupon for a free pancake. There's a big patio section outside, and a large dining room inside and I think just one waiter serving everyone. He was also the cashier when you wanted to pay. I'm hoping more staff start showing up for lunch, although he did handle the room and patio pretty well. I ordered a waffle with fruit, which was great. Coffee was nice."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  Great food,  great atmosphere,  large portions, reasonable prices, but most of all, the servers, Jesse and Laurie are incredible. So helpful in making selections on the menu, to making suggestions, refilling your coffee and just going beyond being a server."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place and completely disagree with comments made by Tiff and Desiree.  The waitress are friendly and welcoming...always have a great smile on their face.  I'm a regular and they greet me and my companion with smiles and hugs each week...especially the one with the long straight hair!  Who cares if they wear yoga pants, they are comfy and not nearly as scantily clad as the waitress you see in many, many other establishments.  I have never, ever seen any of them with low cleavage...that statement is totally incorrect.   Its a breakfast joint, the presentation is just fine for what you pay.  If you need presentation, then go to The Royal York.  I've been to many Sunset Grills and this is by far the best in customer service and quality of food. Of course its busy, they specialize in breakfast and close at 3pm on the weekends.  Sometimes you have to wait and sometimes you don't.  They have a best eggs in the city and if you had an issue with anything, you should have told them, they are always happy to get something redone or get something different. If you had bothered to look around at any other table, you would have realized that you pay the bill at the front cash, it doesn't come to the table.  Weekends wouldn't be the same without a visit to this great little gem."}
{"text":"This is an amazing place to go to! They have absolutely fantastic pancakes along with great customer service skills. 

Story: I came there for a meeting, but had to take a phone call in between that lasted longer than expected, by that time I came back the pancakes were cold. They served me again with warm pancakes. Absolutely fantastic customer service! I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Love this place. Wife and some of our friends stopped by Sunday to watch the sunset. Ordered 4 Strawberry daquiris. THEY SAID THEY DON'T DO FROZEN DRINKS ANYMORE...WHAT!!! ARE YOU KIDDING ME..LMAO. You have to have frozen drinks to watch a sunset..ahahahaha Come on guys...get it together..our wives are not the bucket of beer types..ahahaha.Still giing this week. But really miss the old owners sometimes."}
{"text":"Food is good. Service is average at best but they have a couple pretty bad service people. Eggs Sunset is good but the quantities aren't consistent. French toast should have powdered sugar on it and cooked better"}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff, good price. We are regulars now. The weekend is saved :)"}
{"text":"Great place for good old greasy spoon grub! It's the remedy for the morning after an entertaining and long night. Love the eggs benedict!!"}
{"text":"Not all that bad .
I had a western sandwich with home fries
And a coffee. Price was $9.00.
Coffee was good , home fries under seasoned . Western was also under seasoned.  But a good size .
Price a bit high but not bad for Port Credit.
Service was a perfect 5 stars."}
{"text":"I came here for my lunch break from work and loved their \"Eggs Florentine\", great poached eggs in the middle of the day."}
{"text":"Went back here the other day and this time, with a friend who has driven by the place since he now works in the area.  Happy to say that he enjoyed his meal and service very much.  I was also happy as usual, with special thanks to Eugenia.

This time I had their Bacon Cheeseburger which really hit the spot. Mind you, it tasted pretty much like any other bacon cheeseburger but I loved how generous they were with the bacon! Bacon is life, afterall.  Also, the burger was huge.  I can't believe I actually ate the whole thing.  I guess it was that good that I didn't want to really take any home.  Instead, I brought home the rest of the fries and their delicious gravy.  4/5.

Speaking of their gravy, make sure you get a side of gravy if you're going to have fries.  It's absolutely delicious and the portion is big that 2-3 people can share it.  5/5.

Now, their coffee is probably the best out there next to McDonald's.  It's so good that I actually had about a cup and a half with my burger.  I mean, who has coffee with a burger?? 5/5"}
{"text":"I really hate having to point out flaws about the service but I guess it's also needed.  If Management reads this, please take this as constructive criticism. 

I walked in and since they had a sign that said \"Please seat yourself\", I did just that.  At least 20 minutes have gone by and none of the servers approached me to offer any drinks.  All I got was \"Oh! I didn't see you there!\", but she still walked away.  So I literally had to stop the other waitress (who walked by me a few times), for a glass of water.  My party ran late so I was sitting for some time and another maybe 20 minutes had passed until one of the waitresses finally offered coffee.  I do however, appreciate her accommodating my request to move to a larger seating area as my party consisted of an infant who will be in a car seat/stroller.  Oddly enough though, the service that I was expecting, was only really given when the rest of the party came.  Who knows what the reasons were but it was a little disappointing at first.  I still gave a 20% tip since their service was on point WHEN it actually started about 40mins after my arrival.  Now on to the food review...

Crab Cake Benedict - Were good sized cakes and although I asked for soft poached eggs, was still a little too overdone.  Was still pretty good and the hollandaise sauce was also generous and creamy.  I think it needed a little bit more lemon and the cake itself needed a little bit more seasoning.  Normally I'm good with just adding pepper but this time around, I even put a lot of hot sauce.  4/5. 

Bacon - Can't go wrong with bacon really, but some places still don't do bacon well (not evenly cooked).  Theirs were good.  I was happy to pay extra for the side of bacon. 5/5.

House Fries - Seems like the potatoes were boiled a bit before being fried. Needs way more seasoning as they were quite bland.  Would also be nice if it had more crisp to them.  4/5."}
{"text":"Great food, great prices, great service! I highly recommend this location as it's quick and efficient and the food is always of good quality. 
They represent a breakfast diner really well and you can always count on getting exactly what you've ordered and it tastes really good."}
{"text":"Sunset Grill is located in the office complex that I work in so our group orders once every week or so.  The fare is simple but the food is always great.  You cannot imagine how FAST they get food to you.  I am writting this review to let you know that I stumbled onto the Southwest Chicken Cibiatta sandwich today.  Holly crap was it amazing!  Fantastic flavors.  Definitely my new lunch of choice there."}
{"text":"Service was really quick and cashier suggested me how to order breakfast in order to save ur money. Satisfied with everything . Will go back with in this week."}
{"text":"Sunsets are pretty standard. I love that they have a big menu and this one is always clean and friendly. The owner/manager is really great and coffee is always full. Plus one or the few places that have turkey bacon when I'm pretending to be healthy :)"}
{"text":"We came here for breakfast and the place was jam packed . We sat down and was seen within minutes. The service was slow and they were all over the place . They got our orders wrong . They offered to change it but we've been waiting 20 min for eggs already so we declined and ate away. 
The sausages were undercooked and so was the pancakes but other than that everything else was ordinary and usual."}
{"text":"They serve you tons of food and the service is quick. They're frequently lined up out the door on weekends, but they move quickly and I've never waited more than about 15 minutes. I've tried a few different things-pancakes (piled sky-high with fresh whipped cream and strawberries), french toast and the standard eggs with toast and bacon- everything has been great."}
{"text":"Worst breakfast
Worst service
I'd even consider going to highway 7 golden griddle over this place.
Vaughan location"}
{"text":"Start off with the positive. Food was good. Well priced and pretty tasty. Now for the negative. Our food took forever to get. Our waitress kept apologizing for it taking so long. I watched my order sit under the heat lamps for 5-10 minutes before it was brought to our table. Next our waitress while filling my water also poured the water over my foot. Nice. The only thing that came quickly was the bill. We had barely received our order when the bill was placed at our table. I know that I would not eat here again."}
{"text":"Great food, excellent service. The 2 servers are so hospitable and kind. Genuine customer service. Will go again. Thank you very much!"}
{"text":"I've been coming the the Sunset Grill for some time, typically during the week and for an early breakfast, and never been disappointed when those conditions are met. They have a weekday breakfast meal -- eggs, toast, home fries, with the option of adding on some meats for extra charges -- that is a great value in terms of how much food you receive. I tend to add sausage and coffee so, once tip and taxes are accounted for, I'm paying around $10-13. 

Early morning the service is fast, coffee and water filled regularly, and the bill delivered with utmost haste. Sadly the same cannot be said of weekends, when the Sunset Grill fills up with people out with their kids and friends for a cheap breakfast and time to gab. Over the weekend this breakfast joint is loud, a bit slow, and prices aren't as low as they should be for the quality of food provided. 

I would advise you to generally do a basic breakfast, perhaps with a fruit dish as your 'special extra'. The French toast is a particularly sad meal option: it has the under taste of an omelette which is, perhaps unsurprisingly, not quite how I want my French toast to taste! If the cooks are utilizing any vanilla in the batter for such toast I suspect it's wafted within feet like incense and not actually poured into the mixing bowl. 

In short, I conditionally recommend coming here. Not on weekends. And don't adventure too far off the basic breakfast track. But if you're here on weekday mornings  you can be sure to relax, enjoy a simple and hearty breakfast, and leave to start your day with a very full belly of cooked goodness."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: The review is strictly on the customer service and not the quality of the food (didn't get a chance to dine at the restaurant). 

Having been to many other Sunset Grill restaurants in Toronto, I was extremely disappointed with the Ajax location. My friend and i decided to drop by after working out at Goodlife around noon. When we got in the restaurant there were, 2 different parties waiting for a table. The restaurant was pretty much empty with the exception of 5 tables (a total of 15 guests max). We noticed that many of the empty tables had not been cleared. The wait staff walked by the waiting us, the waiting guests, several times and did not acknowledge our presence. While waiting, a couple came in and proceeded to seat themselves. In passing they told us that they were the owners. After hearing that, we were pretty sure we would be seated right away but instead the wait staff proceeded to clearing a table for the owners to sit. After waiting for another 5-10 minutes, it was evident that the wait staff had no intention of clearing the tables to seat us so we left, and so did the other waiting guests. Needless to say we will not be returning to this location. The staff at this location require a lot of customer service skills, perhaps from  Sunset Grill headquarters. 


 We ended up going to That 50's Diner in Pickering and it was friendly and delicious!"}
{"text":"I can't really rate this restaurant very high at all. I ate there twice and was disappointed each time. On both occasions the meat served was dry and without flavour. I tried two different dishes and both came out the same way. The floors were dirty and unattended and the coffee was weak. That's my two cents. I'd pick another diner up the way."}
{"text":"A great greasy spoon with a no frills attitude that I love. My boyfriend and I are huge fans of the charming eastern European waitress who has a sharp wit and a great sense of humor. Good place for basic, non-hipster, affordable breakfast."}
{"text":"Sept 4th were there.  Walked out after being treated so rudely by a blond waitress.   She was rude to everyone,     too bad this will be our last, never again."}
{"text":"A great little greasy spoon, but this restaurant can get packed on the weekends and if there is air conditioning, I've never felt it. Gorgeous little back patio for sunny days. It isn't a fancy breakfast place but it gets the job done and is close to home. Usually filled with lots of families and hungover hipsters so it's very casual.

This is our regular spot on the weekend to get our greasy breakfasts quick and without fuss. The servers are all friendly young women. 

Our favourites are the classic big bacon, eggs, sausage, homefries, toast deals for around $6-7 or the Sunset Special Sandwich (a fried egg sandwich with peameal bacon and cheese). We also frequently order omelettes - I like building my own spinach and feta cheese omelette. The omelettes are huge and filling. 

A great place for a huge breakfast and coffee for under $10. 

Things I wish they had on the menu: milkshakes! Seriously, why do breakfast places not have milkshakes? :)"}
{"text":"Service friendly, prices are good music annoying food equal to Eggsmart and Cora nice decoration specially the lighting"}
{"text":"Awful Service:
All waitresses had attitude and I'm not exaggerating. They were all wearing yoga pants and tops with low cleavage. I have nothing against this personally, but come on, this is a family restaurant not Hooters. 

Food:
Presentation for every dish was Meh. Potatoes were overcooked and burnt at the edges. My eggs benny was overcooked and not runny. Coffee also tasted burnt.

It took us forever to get the bill. At least three waitresses gave us the index finger and walked off. We ended up just going up to the counter to pay.. we should have just walked out. 

Point is, I'm never coming back here."}
{"text":"I just bought a new house in the area and since we couldn't find our dishes we decided to venture out and find breakfast somewhere. We went into the Sunset Grill \"blind\" having never heard of it or read any reviews. It is a \"homey\" rather than sophisticated restaurant and while they were busy on this Sunday morning we were seated right away. They have a breakfast and lunch menu and I decided to go with a standard breakfast of eggs/bacon/home fries etc and my son had French toast and bacon. We also split a fruit plate. The food was terrific and came out pretty quick too. I am somewhat picky of my eggs (Sunnyside up, lightly basted, runny yolk) and they cooked them perfectly. The portions were huge and we were both particularly impressed with the bacon as it was thick cut and we each got five pieces! My only issue was that our waitress did not refill our coffee that often and I found myself looking for someone, anyone really, to refill. We will definitely be back though and would recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"Really great service and food. The portions are very large for the price you pay. I found the house potatoes were perfectly done; not too soggy and not over cooked. Also, the eggs were extremely fresh and cooked very well. I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. One of my buddies wanted to go for breakfast. I was hungry so we went.

The decor is actually fine. It's sort of like an updated diner. Has a minor lake view, which is nice. It's also right in the Port Credit area, which I love. That concludes all of my positive comments.

For breakfast I had a burger... what is wrong with me. As far as burgers go, it was one of the worst ever. I wish I could say it was greasy, but that'd be a lie. It was so overcooked and dried out. If I were to collect sawdust, and compact it into a burger patty shape, they'd have the same texture and flavor.

The service was also terrible. My server wasn't attentive. She never came by to refill my water. Forgot to bring me cutlery, while bringing it for my friend. Didn't come back for ages, had to go to the counter to ask. It was brutal, she just did not care. I was thankful to pay at the counter at a register, it was easier that way to give her no tip.

I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, but maybe I just got unlucky."}
{"text":"Sunset Grill is my good ol' reliable brunch place.

If I'm having brunch in the Bloor/Church area, I alternate beween Sunset Grill and Lola's Commissary.  It depends on who I'm eating with.

I found that  Sunset was an easier place to eat for people with allergies.

One of my friends has a gluten allergy and another friend is allergic to sesame seeds.  It's surprising how many places use seasame crusted bread to make french toast (Sunset doesn't)!

I always order the same thing here, the Sunset Super..
And it sure is super delicious and filling!
It's a real breakfast.
Sausage and/or bacon (I do both), 2 pancakes, 3 eggs, and of course home fries!

My cup of coffee always seems bottomless!  
I've never had an issue with service here.

This place may not be trendy, but for casual diner style brunch, this place has never let me down!"}
{"text":"The Sunset Grill is my family's favorite place to go for Sunday brunch, but it's a comfortable spot for just a sociable coffee break too. Our granddaughter loves the kids' menu and activity sheet with crayons. The French toast is thick and custardy, not dry and shrivelled, with a pitcher of real maple syrup. Side options include fresh melon and berries, non-greasy home fries and fresh juices. Best of all is the endless cup of coffee! Another thing we like: the staff recognize us and remember our favorite menu items. Last but not least, big windows offer a scenic view of the Credit River with swans and geese floating by, as well as the Port Credit Lighthouse."}
{"text":"Delicous meal. Group of 10 Saturday morning - fast service, hot food, big portions & tasty. Yes we'll be back."}
{"text":"Such a beaches staple! If you are looking for no nonsense great food served hot and with plenty of food, this is your spot!

This is such a reliable brunch spot, and you always know what to expect. Fast and friendly service."}
{"text":"My friend & I were there for a late lunch.  The welcome was friendly, sincere & immediate. Our orders we taken quickly and arrived hot and tasty. When we realized that we were the only guests left we were assured that there was no rush to leave.  Summary: friendly, clean, good food/prices. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Lining up outside the Sunset on the weekend is almost a Beaches tradition, which holds that causal, low-cost, cheery, plenty and friendly is what works -- probably why there are three diners in the main part of the strip, and only one or at most two fine dining spots. 
The toast is always thick and I really enjoy the dark rye. The fruit bowl is always good. My dad would never eat pork and beans because he ate so much during the Depression, but beans are a popular side dish here, altho they are a bit sweet and have not much of a distinctive taste.
I like diners most when a yearning for an old fashioned Happy Days breakfast to get over a hangover won't go away; at other times I get disappointed. That must be me today because I'm wishing there was something more distinctive about the beans or the eggs -- something like local and sustainable or something far away from a can of pork and beans from the 1950s.
The other thing I enjoy in diners is the look of people getting a start on life. The waitresses are always good-humored and efficient in a friendly way, and will be going somewhere when they've saved a bit of money; and the short order cooks are immigrants who are making their way in an industry that isn't too expensive to get into and relies mainly on hard and steady work.
As I argue in my book Food for City Building, providing a start in life is one major function of a restaurant strip, and you can see that here."}
{"text":"Server was friendly, but this time, she was sweeping right under us as we were eating!   Hardly checked on us, had to wave her down a few times.  Food good."}
{"text":"Sat down and waited 35mins before the food came. When the food finally got to our table the waiter didn't give us cutleries. Waited another 5mins horrible service!"}
{"text":"Food was quickly delivered.  Enjoyed a good breakfast.  Service was ok but it was near closing time so they were cleaning up."}

{"text":"My husband and I have been searching for a typical \"breakfast\" restaurant since my return to Toronto (my hometown) in early January 2016 and his relocation to Toronto in early July 2016. Sunset Grill at the Stockyards Shopping Centre is it!

We were greeted promptly, seated immediately, had a friendly server, had beverages in a split second, ordered a standard two eggs with choice of meat (bacon, sausage, ham), potatoes, and pancakes for a good price... everything came quickly, hot and tasty.  Efficient!

Ample parking. Though we were just two, we also spotted a bunch of larger family groups... and they had a slightly longer wait for a table."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I have been testing out Alberta's food scene on our adventure to Australia. For the first time, we felt like we hit a gold mine. Ivan, our server, was prompt, friendly, and always with a smile. We were blown away by the quality of the food, the cleanliness of the kitchen and restaurant itself and how professional the staff were. It's sad to say we won't be on this side of the world to visit this location again. Thank you, Ivan and staff, for the wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"Ok place food was ok but overpriced. Turkey bacon was good hash browns not so much. Terrible coffee. Not pleased for what I paid. Won't be back"}
{"text":"Another big chain with not much to offer. One star for our server as she was nice and friendly but our food was not the best. 

The location is quite big and their are plenty of seats. But wow the food did not have taste as we struggle to finish breakfast the easy meal on the planet to eat. The eggs we not done the best and the potatoes were a disgrace. The best thing about the meal was toast with butter!

I will have to try another Sunset Grill location so see if this was a franchise issue or a hit and miss."}
{"text":"This location just recently opened in a new strip mall complex.  Google Maps street view shows it under construction.  I had been to another Sunset Grill in Toronto years ago.  This one seems like its a well oiled machine.  We happened to sit in front of the monitor where the orders were coming in.  The servers actually have tablets where they take the orders and show up at the front so they know when they are ready pick up.  I don't know if there is an internal performance measures in terms of getting orders out to the customers, but it was a very neat way of using technology.  

As expected during brunch, it was very busy even though we were seated right away.  The food we ordered, eggs benedict and a big breakfast were very tasty.  

Even the manager was very friendly and attentive.  I asked for more jam for some toast and without hesitation he helped and asked if we needed anything else.  

I know sometimes customer service is hard to maintain, but given that it is a new location, I would hope that it remains the same."}
{"text":"This Sunset Grill opened recently at a good location for me. I have been to other Sunset Grill restaurants throughout Toronto, so I know what to expect from it. Although the Sunset Grill franchises are in general an \"all right\" place to go to, you have to even further lower the expectations on this one. Food is not what I'm used to (except for the bacon, I find their bacon has always lacked in quality, and it was the same on this restaurant), the service was non-familiar and waiters walked around with a blank face like they are serving jail time instead of working at a family breakfast place, and they tried to rush us out, plus the overall standard quality I have experienced in other franchises was totally missing here. I double checked the door sign upon exiting, to make sure we were on an actual Sunset Grill, instead of a horribly bad developed knock-off. Will not come back, I can find much better places to enjoy my weekend brunch."}
{"text":"Line up out the door...my friend and I got in right away because it was just the two of us and they had a small table available. Not expensive at all (was Sunday so we couldn't get the $3.99 deal, but was still reasonable). Received our food in less than a minute...they have the food rolling out quickly. Definitely worth checking out if you're just looking for a quick in and out. Too busy or loud to stick around and socialize much (at least on the Sunday)"}
{"text":"I have yet to find one of those all day breakfast diners that has totally knocked me off my feet and felt excited about. I keep comparing the Canadian stops to the American diners and keep getting disappointed. Alas, I'm still on the lookout!

Came here just before the brunch rush. I gotta say this location looks nicer than some of the ones I've visited in Scrabs. My coffee mug was always hot and filled and the service was wonderful.

However...their new crab cakes benne did not live up to my expectations :( not much flavour. I am a crispy home fries kinda gal so when you serve me soft potatoes I'm not impressed. 

The pancakes are nice and fluffy and it tasted as good as the French toast. I wouldn't write this place off just yet though. I'll give it a go again and try another dish so to be continued!"}
{"text":"Can you  judge a place by its customers? 
Pushy obnoxious loud mouths all around us. 

First place I have gone to that doesn't have a \"super breakfast \" that includes all three VA on ham and sausage with pancakes -  that would be a $25 meal here.  Their super only has choice of one Shamefully priced sides at $5 per side. 
FRESH OJ tasted watered down. 
Ended up ordering corned beef hash. Wife got eggs bacon and toast. 
Meal took 30 minutes to arrive at table. 
Mine was cold hers was okay. 
Food was good though temperature notwithstanding."}
{"text":"Sit down is pretty quick even though it looks busy. Service was good, food is ok, it'll get you through the morning. Pancakes are decent."}
{"text":"I met three friends here this a.m., and we all had typical, solid, Sunset Grill breakfasts. Well prepared and plenty of it. The standard breakfast included 3 eggs, thick-cut toast, voluminous home fries and tons of bacon (for those who's ordered it).Our waitress was very friendly and attentive as well.

Hard to go wrong here."}
{"text":"Standard Sunset Grill -  good breakfast done cheap...but this location has no soul.

It's a big, open place that caters to business people and tourists distinguished thusly - the business people were on their Blackberrys while the tourists were on their iPhones.

Our waitress was friendly enough but a tad slow on the coffee.

This is a safe bet if you're in the area craving a quick, standard breakfast, but if it's your first Sunset Grill, I'd recommend the one in the Beach."}
{"text":"This is my 5th, and least favourite Sunset Grill.

It was bright and clean, but a bit cafeteria-like. That vibe, plus a few other negatives (below) reduced the rating from a 3-star = average rating.

As this breakfast was on January 2 (holiday for most), we had a bit bigger turnout than usual (6) for our weekly breakfast, so I have a larger sample on which to judge.

The following negatives, though small details on the surface, combined to result in a deduction of 1 star from the average;

-2 of our party had poached eggs, and both found them overcooked. (They weren't asked how they would like them, but both of these experienced poached egg eaters agreed that \"runny yolk\" is the default method.)

-The waiter refused to give us separate cheques, as it was \"their policy\" with 6 guests and up. (We only wanted 3 cheques.)

-Default straws in glasses of water. This is a major pet peeve of mine. Imagine how many plastic straws are wasted in a year by providing this \"extra\". VERY few restaurants include this unnecessary item in water.

-The home fries were substandard. I have found the home fries a highlight at other Sunset Grills, especially the original on Queen St. E.* These were overcooked, crumbly and tasteless.

The rest of our meals were satisfactory, the coffee flowed freely, and the waiter was pleasant.

*My understanding is that the original at 2006 Queen St. E., and one other (at 1602 Danforth, I believe) are owned by the original owner. The owner sold the name and logo, and all the others are operated by other entities."}
{"text":"The place is very clean and decorated quite nicely for the holidays and the staff is very friendly. The coffee cups are a little bit small but it's OK cause there's free refills. Lots of parking and all day breakfast. What more can you ask for."}
{"text":"I would give 4 stars if the server didn't lead us to sit  beside their station that's close to the kitchen. We had to hear their cleaning noise through out the whole meal! I mean..why do you have to prove it to me that you're a hard worker that you wiped the utensils and thew them to the buckets, you cleaned the garbage, and you organized the plates?? Oh right, it's close to the kitchen so it's less walking distance for you to deliver our meals. 

I do like the breakfast though, it's cheap and big portion you get."}
{"text":"I went with my team for brunch over at this location. The location was clean and we were seated quickly and the server was quite friendly. 

Looked at the menu and there were plenty of choices but to my surprise I saw what no man has seen before a \"crab cake Benedict\". Boom and I ordered it! It was heavy and greasy but I munched it down the throat.

A great breakfast indeed."}
{"text":"Had to leave the underseasoned homefries and smoked salmon tasted off. Bill came to 58.00 now i have to go to a&w for something edible. Coffee took 15 mins to arrive after asking twice. No cutlery for one of us. Wrong toast on the order and attitude when we asked to change it. I would never tip 0 so 10% was what I left but we all feel ill 2 hours after"}
{"text":"Your typical breakfast place! 

Been here a couple times and food never disappoints! I order different things each time depending on what I feel like that day! I've had their blt sandwich, bacon/eggs/sausage/fries combo, grilled chicken sandwich, and pancakes! 

They always try to serve you as quick and efficiently as possible, no matter how busy. Waitresses are super friendly! I've been able to make friendly conversations with all of the ones I've had there.

I've been to better breakfast places but you can never go wrong with sunset grill!!"}
{"text":"Exactly what you expect from a chain breakfast joint. Passable food and service, but nothing is made with love."}
{"text":"This, the newest of the GTA locations, is no doubt the hardest to find.* 

If you've been to any of the franchised Sunset Grills, you'll recognise the decor, vibe and menu. Food was good, and service was excellent. We were a table of 7, and had 3 different servers attend to our every need (i.e. coffee). Separate cheques (5 in total) was not a problem. Hear that, Sunset Grill at 120 Bloor St. E.? http://www.yelp.com/biz/sunset-grill-toronto-7#hrid:ULQHUMrktRPGEYw__WqUYA

So, solid food + excellent service = 4 stars.

*It's located within a big box-style development that includes an HMV, South St. Burger, La Senza, Subway etc...so if you see any of these familiar signs, you're in the right place. SG is on the inner, north side, NOT facing Wicksteed."}
{"text":"I've been to this, my 5th location of this iconic Toronto institution, a number of times but keep forgetting to review it. 

I had the 3-egg breakfast special, and it was just above average. 3 fairly large eggs, accompanied by a large helping of real home fries, and standard brown toast, was washed down with a bottomless cup of average diner coffee. The waitress was friendly and attentive, and served our large (8) group admirably. Others were suitably pleased with their standard breakfast special.

A more adventurous member of our group ordered the Eggs Florentine (three eggs over easy served on sautéed baby spinach with melted Swiss on English muffins topped with Hollandaise sauce), not to be confused with the Florentine Omelette (fresh baby spinach and Swiss cheese). She enjoyed it.

Another tried the Great Canadian Omelette (bacon, mushrooms and cheddar), and also gave it the thumbs up.

My lovely wife ordered poached eggs - soft - but they arrived closer to medium.

All in all, you can't really go wrong with breakfast at a Sunset Grill, but this location lacks the vibe of the original on Queen St. E. (We were in the back section due to the size of our group. I would recommend sitting closer to the front...at least you'll get some natural light.)

NB If you order water and don't like wasting plastic, ask for \"no straw\"."}
{"text":"I think I take this place for granted.  We've lived in the Beach for almost 20 years, and I've only been there half a dozen times.  Always figure, \"why wait in line when there are always other options\"?

I met a friend there today (Saturday) at 9-ish, and it wasn't busy at all.  I had the vegetarian omelet (mushrooms, onion, tomatoes and spinach, if memory serves) and it was very good.  Well above average for a \"greasy spoon\".  Friend had the \"Popeye\" (spinach, cheese and smoked ham?) and was very pleased as well.  Homefries and thick toast were excellent as well.

I guess I should go back a bit more often...with CASH in hand (What up wit dat, SG???)"}
{"text":"Very slow service, some waitresses come in with major hangovers on Sat or Sun morning which then they get the order wrong. Coffee takes forever to come and prepared food sits at window waiting for waitress to pick up."}
{"text":"I came with a company of 4 and we were greeted warmly by the waitress. When I asked for hot water, the waitress was kind enough to offer lemon slices and honey to go with the hot water. 

The Florentin tasted good, the egg is soft with a lot of spinach and red onion chunks. The sauce is the soul of the dish. It lightens up the whole dish. The breakfast is a bit too big for me and I could not finish everything on the plate."}
{"text":"The seats are very tight.
Took 15 mins for someone to take our order and food took forever to come.  The server never came back to let us know the status.  We asked another server for our status and he told us to wait for \"our server\".
Terrible service!"}
{"text":"Very busy typical breakfast restaurant in the financial core. It is packed with tourists on the weekends. It serves your typical breakfast food. The service was great during the time I went and my swiss cheese burger was good. Nothing to rave about, but would come back."}
{"text":"Yellow Light, Not sure if I would suggest it to you but you may like it. Classic diner with a menu breakfast based that goes until the afternoon. Pancakes, eggs and yogurt options made nicely without any fancyness. Fair for the price they ask. Personnel was quick but without much attention to the customer. I want to go again to make my final decision on the rating because based on just the pancakes and the coffee I had I can't tell yet."}
{"text":"BEST BACON AND LOTS OF IT!!!

Very impressed. Waitress was super friendly as well. French toast was spot on."}
{"text":"I've eaten in a lot of diners and this one is among the best. Great omlettes, and the best pancakes I've ever had. I ordered 1 pancake and they are huge. Sunset yogurt and berries huge and delicious, topped with fresh strawberries and swirled with strawberry purée. I wish we we're going to be here longer because we would come back every day!"}
{"text":"This is worst place for breakfast! I ordered corn beef hash with 3 eggs and hashbrowns with toast my scrambled eggs with cheese weren't cooked all way runny and cheese not melted all the way my corned beef was Spicy and then on second bite I found a grey HAIR. in my hash! My toast was best part as my hashbrowns were kind of burnt when I gave plate to waitress and showed hair she said I'll take it off got to register and she took only a few dollars off I still was made to pay for my eggs and hashbrowns with toast! Never going back I will stick to Panagio's grill at Creditview they are way better and alot cheaper!"}
{"text":"Service was quick and attentive, and the good was quite good. The pancakes are massive which was awesome!"}
{"text":"For an all day breakfast spot, these guys definitely deliver. Big portions, fair pricing and again, all day breakfast. Servers are always happy, which makes me happy.

It's my go to breakfast place. No frills, no thrills, but definitely will get all the breakfast fixin's you're looking for"}
{"text":"This is a decent place for breakfast and lunch with no surprises.  I usually get the BLT which is pretty good, although it could use a bit more bacon, but what couldn't?  :-)  My husband usually gets the Eggs Sunset which is their version of Eggs Benedict.  Both come with home fries and veggies and dip (which is a cucumber stick, a carrot stick, and a packet of ranch dressing).  I tried the pancakes once and they were pretty good, but I was disappointed they don't do waffles which I prefer.  they don't offer much that isn't breakfast food, even in the sandwiches, but you wouldn't go to a breakfast place expecting something else.  Service can be slow if you come late in the day (they close at 3pm) but is always friendly."}
{"text":"Wouldn't suggest going to this location at all. Every time I asked for something it seemed like
The waitress was kissed that I was asking for ice water with extra Ice"}
{"text":"I have never had a bad experience here. 

I come to this location quite often and have had great food and service every time.  
Food is always great and fresh, the 1 time they mixed up my order they gave me a gift certificate which was very generous.

The service is always fast and pleasant.  

I guess my only complaint is that my girlfriend always seems to get more home fries than me every time we go. :P"}
{"text":"I won't wax on about my experience here, it was, ok. You come to expect a certain consistent level of service and food from big chains and when it falls flat, well the proof is in the eggs benny as I might say.

I always get Eggs Benny, it's my go to, I love it. End of story. So walking in here last weekend, I knew what I wanted; freshly squeezed orange juice, coffee and eggs benny. I didn't even look at the menu, I made it easy for the server, she took my order and away we went.

I wait a standard lengthy of time and notice I've not received my coffee or OJ, easily the first things to come out right? Nope, my server forgot about me entirely. Suddenly another server plops down something that was supposed to look like what I ordered to eat, except not at all - two fried eggs made to look like Eggs Benny (which should always be poached).

Still having not received my drinks I did the whole, look over the crowd with a long neck for my server until I make eye contact and give her the cold \"come hither look.\" She looks at my table and asks if everything is ok? 

Really?!?!?!

I point out there are no drinks and what exactly is in front of me for food?

She says, :Oh yes, your drinks! We'll get that to you in a moment. What's wrong with your meal?\"I flick the over-cooked fried egg in disgust and don't say a word. She replies \"Oh on weekends the eggs come over-easy unless you say otherwise.. it says it on the menu\"

My response, \"You double checked with me twice on what my drinks were so i find it hard to believe that you got the food order in and not the drinks... there were two after all. Also, you handed me the menu and I ordered in front of you without even opening it, so you knew I didn't read your policy on over easy... which these are not, yet you said nothing.\"

\"Would you like us to remake it?\"

Hand her plate without a word

\"It was on the menu for you to read, right there...\"

Number one rule of customer service - customer is always right

Number two rule - when in doubt, refer to number one.

(Clearly this irritated me more than I realized - sorry for the novella folks)

Eatcrest OUT (and never coming back)"}
{"text":"Every so often you come across a place that tickles your taste buds, delights your senses and fills your tummy tum tum with delicious goodness. Unfortunately this morning at Sunset Grill was not one of those time.

I'll begin by saying if there is anything a dislike more than a poorly cooked meal, it'c complaining about it (or writing a review about it). In my opinion every kitchen makes a mistake from time to time, however when that happens its up to the front of house staff to make amends for it, and when they don't own up \"it really grinds my gears\". 

I want to say that this review is not a reflection on all Sunset Grills, just this location. I've had many a great breakfast and service at other locations however this one needs to get back to the quality standards that their many other locations adhere to. 

Attending breakfast with a friend this morning we were both dismayed at the quality of our respective meals. 

Order#1: Bacon and 3 eggs
Problem: Bacon cooked to a charred imperfection, over-easy eggs were too over and not so easy (to swallow) and possibly the worst was the hash brown potatoes - burnt on the outside and cold and mushy (still frozen) on the inside ----YUMMMYYY (NOT!)

Order#2: Corned Beef Hash and 3 eggs
Problem: Corned Beef was a lovely paste consistency, not freshly cooked at all, similar to a toothpaste (gags once), eggs same as above (gags twice), potatoes ...... well you get the picture.

As I mentioned above I am not a complainer, and I hate to slow down a busy restaurant by returning food or sending items back. Instead I decided to mention our poor experience to the manager and cashier while I was paying, not in an effort to receive gratis food but to make them aware so that they could adjust their quality standards for other restaurant patrons. 

The reaction I received is what bothered me. The cashier starred at me blankly and asked what I would like for her to do about it while the manager looked at me and went back to his notepad without saying a thing. Not even a thank you? Come on guys - Bad News Business Bears.

My recco, give this location a TV time out for a little while, maybe check back with them in about 6 months or so (that's my plan). I'm all about second chances."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast with 5 friends on a Sunday morning. I ordered the eggs benny which was decent.  Nothing extraordinary (I still prefer Eggspectations eggs benny). 

One of my friends ordered pancakes. His order was completely raw from the inside. When we told the waitress she did not apologize or anything. She sent the manager over about 10 minutes later who said sorry and took it off the bill. 

My other friend noticed the Tabasco tasted odd. Turns out it was expired so she asked for a new bottle. The new bottle, which was brand new still wrapped in plastic, was also expired. We didn't say anything the second time because we didn't want to seem annoying. 

Overall it's a definite no for me. The service was beyond poor and the food was way too average for me to return. Good service can sometimes make up for bad food but this establishment lacked in both aspects."}
{"text":"I've went here a few times and the food is very inconsistent. First off, it's usual greasy, my eggs are never cooked right (soft poached came out hard poached), but the meats and potatoes are pretty good. 

I literally live 5 mins away and love breakfast food, it's unfortunate that I always seem to be harassed to leave early.  I been going here for a year and I vow never to come back again after my last dinein experience. A few weeks ago my daughter and I along with a few friends came on a weekend for brunch. Our server was nice enough and that is the only reason why we even left a tip. My daughter started fussing and crying a bit (along with most kids her age when seated for a period of time), but the audacity of the manager still riles me up. Our bill was 100+ dollars and we sat for only a hour. We were still drinking our coffees and finishing our breakfast when the bill was set on the table. There was a line up and the short dark hair manager had the nerve to tell us to leave because one my daughter was disrupting other peoples brunch and that we sat here For two hours when there's a line up for other people to sit. First off, we sat here for maximum only an hour, second, no one seems to have a problem with my daughter fussing a bit, and thirdly, how the hell can u kick us out when we are paying customers that hasn't finished our food?!

I never liked this manager because he's rude, never smiles when u are a regular, and is just so pretentious. This store needs new management and maybe not so many customers would write bad reviews. Cos all the bad ones I see here is because of this middle aged man.

The other times I been here when it's not busy it's not so bad. But this place has potential if they got chefs who can cooks eggs rigt and manager who smiles and is nice."}
{"text":"You generic breakfast/brunch spot. The staff is friendly and the food is great. You can't go wrong with Sunset Grill for a delicious weekend brunch."}
{"text":"Had breakfast there for the first time this weekend. They claim \"famous\" all day breakfast -- I'm not sure I'd call it famous, but I give it a thumbs-up for sure!

Service was friendly and prompt. They even remembered I had decaf when they brought the refills around.

Had the three egg breakfast with toast, sausage and potatoes, and it was all prepared just right. Eggs were over medium and done right. At $7+, I wouldn't call it a deal, but it's on par with other breakfasts in the area.

I'll definitely go back. In fact, I live in the area, so I might become a regular!"}
{"text":"Pretty average breakfast - nothing mind blowing. Service is hit or miss, Eggs benny is OK but I find the hollandaise to be far too buttery. I ordered the Eggs Florentine and the spinach was not cooked enough. 

In past visits I've found the bacon to be either over cooked or excessively fatty, no consistency. 

I've been a few times expecting different but I consistently have felt rushed, and under attended to, with the food falling short. This isn't the first time I've been let down by this chain in general so I'm beginning to understand that it's not a one off but just how they do business. 

Ah well anyone can do a good bacon and egg, well almost anyone."}
{"text":"As a chain, Sunset Grill tends to be fairly consistent in terms of service and food no matter which location you visit. This is why, when taking my mama-bear out for breakfast somewhere between Aurora and Toronto, we searched for something with a reputation as such to avoid any Mothers Day disappointments (we leave the exploration for other days where a screw up can leave you in the dog house for awhile).

We did the smart thing and called the day before to get a handle on what the wait time would be like around our anticipated arrival time and the person on the phone was spot on when telling us that there would be a 20-30 minute wait if we showed up @ 10:30 am.

When I arrived I had my doubts as the crowds spilled out onto the sidewalk and into the parking lot. I pushed my way through and was relieved to find that the crowd had already put their names down and many were part of similar larger groups, so I added my name down and went outside.

True to their word, the staff at Sunset managed the Mothers Day brunch crowd, calmly and professionally and moved everyone through like a well oiled machine - we were seated in roughly 30 minutes.

Once seated our experience was pretty good. The servers were well organized despite the mothers day insanity and never left us alone for long enough to feel neglected, in fact our server was on her game for the most part and checked back with us on the regular before ordering, once the food arrived and post meal for bill and tidy up. The only flummox was with my meal in terms of what type of bacon I ordered... not a big deal, but I think the stress of the day was getting to our server because when I flagged the small error she argued with me about what I had ordered as opposed to just making the correction. No real fault here, just a stress thing.

For 4 of us, each ordering more than we could eat, the total bill came in just over $70 (less than $20/person), which I felt was more than fair considering how full our table (and our bellies) were.

I'd come back again to this location

Eatcrest out"}
{"text":"Not a fan of this place.  The food is nothing special, the decor is underwhelming and the service is below par.  It's a no flare place for cheap breakfast food.  The server did not look happy to be there and pretty much ignored our table once the food came out.  I will not be returning or recommending anyone to eat here."}
{"text":"Oh, come on, it's the Sunset Grill.  It's legendary for a reason.  Good food in the best neighbourhood in the city."}
{"text":"Just love the eggs but my toast could do with  a lot less butter. Good breakfast for sure love the coffee"}
{"text":"Basic diner-like atmosphere, but good food at a decent price. This afternoon, we ordered breakfast and it was at the table inside 3 minutes. And hot and fresh. Also, toast was not dry and cold, like so many places. I should come here more often."}
{"text":"The food was phenomenal plus they serve breakfast all day long. I had their Canada 150th Birthday special breakfast which was Strawberry Cheesecake French Toast. It was delicious, but I would recommend getting a more balanced meal for your breakfast. It definitely took me back to my childhood days of eating dessert for breakfast.

The staff were all very pleasant and worked with a sense of urgency. I would definitely return again!"}
{"text":"The only thing I like about this place is that every time I've been, the food has always come out fast, and they're always quick to give you your bill. It makes for a fast experience, which is nice, considering I usually feel sick afterwards and want to leave ASAP. The potatoes make me feel sick.. I don't know what it is, maybe all the oil they use? French toast and pancakes always have a weird taste to them. I think the grill needs to be cleaned better before putting them on. I only kept going back because my boyfriend loves the French toast with all the whipped cream, syrup, and strawberries. But even he agrees with the funny tasting pancakes/French toast. We've been sticking to Coras for a while now. Even though our bill is usually double in price, it's a lot more enjoyable."}
{"text":"Great staff, super friendly and always smiling. Food is good but slightly overpriced for the simple menu items offered. The Salmon in the Salmon eggs Benedict doesn't taste fresh unfortunately, I ordered it twice on different visits in case the first time was a miss. The yogurt parfait is good and location is prime."}
{"text":"Just ordered take out from there and got the chocolate chip pancakes with a side of fresh strawberries. I paid for strawberries but didn't get any and only three out of five pancakes had chocolate chips. FAIL!"}
{"text":"I always love coming here when my day isn't so busy and I can actually take a long lunch. All day breakfast is definitely my jam! I was very sad to see my favourite menu item go without notice (the crab cake eggs benedict - please bring it back!!) but then again I might be better off not eating that so often... ahem.... Anyways, they have a great steak and eggs breakfast thing that's surprisingly good so I get that now instead and my waistline is probably thanking me. 

The menu here is pretty standard, but what I do find quite special is the kind customer service you get from all of the staff.  I always feel very well taken-care of here so I'll be back again and again. :-)"}
{"text":"First timer here at sunrise grill , the service was good the , bathrooms were clean , overall the place is clean . The only issue I have was the home fries and that is they were really dry"}
{"text":"We had a group of 8 for a breakfast meeting. Were seated very quickly. The waitress was very attentive and checked in often. The portions are very hearty and the bacon was full sized and not paper thin with quite a bit on the plate. Not a lot of customers but I think that is just because it's fairly newly opened. 

Great spot for breakfast or brunch any day of the week. Very reasonably priced as well for the portions you get. 

One minor negative comment... When I poured the little milk thingys in my coffee the first time they curdled. The waitress quickly replaced my coffee but not the container of milk units, luckily it didn't happen again."}
{"text":"It's a Saturday morning and we arrived at a busy location with a lot of action. Normally my girlfriend and I would avoid a breakfast chain but in this case we needed a place to kill time while changing tires.

I have to say we were pleasantly surprised by many aspects of this place. We were greeted by a friendly server named (Debbie) who was very attentive and had a good sense of humour. The food was served quickly even with a busy crowd.

Besides service, let's talk about the food. We ordered the peameal bacon and eggs breakfast and it was served flawlessly. The eggs were done exactly for both of us (overeasy) and the peameal pieces were HUGE. 4 of the them and not like the small kind you get at the supermarket. 

If you are in the area -- stop in for breakfast as this has changed my opinion of at least one sunset grill."}
{"text":"If you are in the area, you feel lazy and don't wanna prepare your breakfast and you are not so picky about food, this might be the place to come. Came here for the first time as we have seen this restaurant passing by and this place is exactly the passing by restaurant. The restaurant was kept clean not too dated as it should. No food is special, over cooked omelet, soggy waffles with not so freshly squeezed juice with cheap coffee to summarize. Definitely in need of complete menu overhaul. There are better options for breakfast in the area, look for my other reviews."}
{"text":"I came with some friends during lunch because it was close to work, the price and portion is really good (which is why I gave it one extra star) for a restaurant located in the downtown core.

My eggs were cooked perfectly, but the bacons are a little overcooked to my liking. Portion wise, it's very good for $8.

If you're looking for a gourmet breakfast experience, don't expect to find it here. However, if you're looking to fill up and save money, then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Is place it always so great and homey doesn't matter which location you go. Great food if you want a nice breakfast or brunch, and the amount that they serve will definitely keep you full for a very long time."}
{"text":"We had so many choice but we ordered the pancakes, the french toast, turkey bacon and breakfast potatoes. All of which is good but the side of bacon was like almost 6 bucks way overpriced!

Maybe this is Canada's version of IHOP? The food was standard of IHOP. For what you pay you get a lot of food. I mean alot! The waitress was able to point out that we werent from Canada almost right away. We joked about each others words and accents for the rest of the morning. This was a good trip with good food."}
{"text":"Cute little place around the corner from skinny fats which has become way too overcrowded to make it a viable work week lunch spot (thanks tourists). The workers here were super friendly and the menu is straightforward and budget friendly. The BLT with garlic aioli and a side of fruit was the perfect amount of food. My only disappointment was breakfast isn't served all day, but I'll definitely be back to try it!"}
{"text":"I went to this place for breakfast twice over the last week. It is fun to have breakfast on the weekday while watching people to scurry off to work. The location is spacious and well lit. Great place for a cheap breakfast in downtown. The portions are huge and the food is excellent. Their omlettes and eggs benny are recommended. And the bottomless pot of GOOD coffee is always a plus!"}
{"text":"Good food, very good selection of items. All sorts of different options all at a good price. Food was fresh, tasty and quick. Service wasn't too great though... waited 15 minutes to even be brought a coffee and it was not busy. Good basic breakfast, great for families. Would recommend if your in the beaches looking for a breakfast spot."}
{"text":"This is one of many Sunset Grill locations just around the corner of Bloor and Church. My impression of this spot is not very decent from my initial encounter.

I was there for lunch and being the first one to get a table, waiting to be seated. Another women comes into the restaurant behind me and some old grumpy-looking waiter actually served and brought her to table first. I noticed he saw her enter the door after me too! Moment after and seeing me waiting, he never got back to me. It was nice to have another waiter come by. Plus, I have to mention that there were many empty tables and the restaurant wasn't busy. 

As for the food, I had an Egg Florentine and got to try the Great Canadian mushroom omelette. Both were very delicious in its own way. The Florentine had three eggs and it worked well with the muffin base and hollandaise sauce. The omelette was super mushroom-y and good too! They put in a lot of mushroom and had strong bacon flavour within every bite - totally didn't ripe us off on it.

The only thing I didn't as enjoy as much was their potato wedges (home fries). It wasn't as soft and fried on the outside, and were somewhat dry.

Despite the initial encounter, service for my table was great. The waitress had a much nicer attitude compared to the initial guy. Overall the restaurant is not too noisy and is a good place to relax too."}
{"text":"We went there for Saturday breakfast with kids. The place is on a busy plaza but we really like outdoor patio area, it is tucked away on a side and kind of protected from the street and parking area noise. I had Greek omelette and it was quite good. In general, the food there is ok and the service is quick. I guess I added one extra star for outdoor seating, it was really nice to be there on sunny Sat morning :)"}
{"text":"Amazing customer service, I felt like home, you are treated like a king but unfortunately the food wasn't that good either the price. I'll be back to try more food! P. D. The Malibu Chicken Sandwich not worth it, just a bun with a chicken inside."}
{"text":"Love this place, very good food and fast service, wish to see you more often, weekend is too busy I don't like to wait lol but in week days I know is good xoxi"}
{"text":"This was our second time for Brunch. We had the crab cake Benedict and eggs Florentine. The food was great  and the service was prompt. Recommend this for a Saturday, Sunday breakfast Brunch. They also have a new menu which is refreshing."}
{"text":"Decent food but REALLY loud. Get there early or late to avoid the rush crowd. Service was good."}
{"text":"Honestly the food was discusting.. Me and my hubby were craving Eggs Benedict and usually go to Sunset on Bloor but it was still closed at 7am so we decided to try out the new Sunset at the stockyards (figuring the food would be the same)...we ordered take out because we were in a hurry

We neglected to check the food before we left as we figured it wasn't hard to screw up eggs benedict... well we were SUPER disappointed... instead of poached eggs.. they served us fried eggs with Hollandaise sauce on top... so basically we got the $4 fried egg breakfast special and they charged us over $12 for adding hollandaise sauce.. also the potatoes were tasteless

When I called to complain, the girl who answered the phone said I should have been specific on what I wanted and that it was my fault .. Im sorry but for as long as I've known and even if you GOOGLE Eggs Benedict.. it calls for POACHED eggs ..not fried eggs .. needless to say, we will never go back there .. the chefs are lazy and the person who answers the phone is rude"}
{"text":"Despite being a chain, this small breakfast spot hidden in a strip mall is a gem! It's always packed and for good reason! First off even with a line of people waiting, we only had a 10 minute wait for the table. The menu is extensive including a kids menu. The service is fantastic, lovely waitresses. Feel like I'm in an old school family owned diner. Overall the food is really good, if you're feeling guilty there are many healthy options. Looking forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"Food and service were great in all respects.  The washrooms were pristine, considering I went there on a Saturday at 10.30am.

If you go, bring a can opener.  You'll need it to be seated at your table and to get out of it.  I have never, ever, been so crammed in cheek and jowl to fellow customers.  I get it, it's a busy diner at a rush period.  Still, I shouldn't be a less than foot away on either side of other customers' tables, and even that space was lost when the sever had to squeeze in between my table and another to take an order.  Brutal!  So much for a nice Saturday morning breakfast."}
{"text":"I'm usually not a big fan of going out to breakfast because it is one of those meals that I can make easily at home at the same or better quality. I'll usually choose something ethnic open early or a quick to go sandwich over a sit down breakfast. Despite that, sometimes it just seems right and during our recent trip to Toronto it did. Not only that, it was open and in our walking area serving fresh food which made it one of the few options we had other than pre-made Starbucks breakfast. 

Pleasant interior to the establishment and, despite the popularity on a Sunday morning, our wait to sit down was minimal. Food took a little longer than expected but not out of line compared to how many people were there. Loved the fact that they had both fresh orange and grapefruit juices for us to enjoy with our meals. I've seen far too many \"fresh poured\" juices and these were obviously of decent quality if not fresh squeezed in house. Looking for something slightly different, I went with the pea meal bacon (Canadian bacon crusted in cornmeal and pan fried) and 3 egg meal while my GF went for the standard 3 egg/bacon/French toast combo. Both meals were acceptable with a few high spots. The pea meal bacon was interesting although I would want a little more corn meal on mine. My GFs bacon was nicely crispy and all the eggs were cooked properly to order. Hot sauce, HP sauce and ketchup were all available for use as well.

Not a bad option although a touch pricy for what you get."}
{"text":"The service was pretty consistent and attentive the day we dropped by, and I guess that's also due to the fact that there weren't as many people at the 2pm mark?! Lol, anyway, the food wasn't terrible but it wasn't amazing either. My sausages came back looking charred on all sides on every single one lol which we kind of laughed at lol and the potatoes/eggs were done to my liking. The orange juice I ordered didn't come with ice, so as the meal progressed, so did the sourness. After this encounter, my boyfriend said the food didnt sit too well with him later on even though all he had were pancakes and sausages?  and chocolate milk. Anyway, would recommend if you're looking for a chill place to hang out during the day to grab a coffee or meet up with a friend and don't care too much about 5-star quality."}
{"text":"I have had worse for sure.  The home fries were nothing more than boiled sliced potatoes.  The waitress really didn't want to be at work today.  She should join the military. She just spilt water all over the floor from the windows to the cash register.  Wow.  What a slob.  Never cleaned it up.  I hope no one slips.  $$$$$"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant with my family. It was one of the best experience we had. Food was amazing, portion was pretty good and service was exceptional. All the waitress were very friendly and welcoming. We went on Saturday and expected it to be busy and it was. But food came quickly and there were delays. 


I would strongly recommend anyone with kids to this new breakfast place."}
{"text":"Blackened chipotle chicken wrap was pretty bland: chunk chicken (no trace of blackened) with a shit ton of shredded iceberg lettuce and some underripe tomatoes on a plain, cold tortilla wrap, with some not at all flavorful mayo sauce. I could have opened a can of chicken  and it would have as much flavor. Fries are decent. 8.50 for wrap and side. 50 cents extra to use a credit card. A couple of outdoor tables. Cheesy 8x10 Xerox pictures of someone's family in Hawaii on the tables, with the fake orchids. Friendly staff. And no evil styrofoam.

update 12/8/15: ordered delivery of a Malibu Chicken sandwich. Somehow got a plain ole' squished, cold and greasy, barely any cheese having grilled cheese sandwich, but was still charged the full price. $10 for a terrible grilled cheese and bag of nasty ass Lay's potato chips, no thanks. I won't be making this mistake again."}
{"text":"You probably won't see it from Steeles or Kennedy unless you've been there before, but you can get to it easily from the Lowes parking lot.

I always get some waffles or pancakes covered in whipped cream and fruit, because it's always delicious. Although their chicken sandwich, and bacon and eggs are good too.

I would give them four stars but the quality of their food drops off noticeably if the restaurant is more than half full. For example their bacon is perfect when they're less than half full, but as soon as they go over half then the bacon will come to you overcooked and too crispy."}
{"text":"Unlike the other sunset grill, this one is actually great! The waitresses are one of the reasons why I come here. I couldn't care for the breakfast potatoes but the rest is good. Mostly, I eat their french toast (delicious) smoked salmon english muffin (AMAZING) and their egg breakfasts. Just the perfect basic diner right around the corner to complete my weekend routine."}
{"text":"Just had lunch at Sunset Grill  and it was a good experience. I have eaten here before....i have had the philly, Denver Omlette and Turkey Burger. The food has been very good and the portion size on the omlette is huge. The owner is very nice, nice atmosphere. 

Only slight negative was on my omlette it took a little longer than what it should have. Other people got their food before i recieved mine.....

Still highly recommend this place....."}
{"text":"Go early! Great food with large portions. The servers are quick and efficient; they are ready! Your drinks are brought immediately and they soon return for your order. The wait for food is minimal. It's a well oiled machine!"}
{"text":"At this price point, Sunset a grill cannot be beat for breakfast.  If you're looking for your standard eggs, bacon, toast, pancakes, and home fries, Sunset a grill is a great choice.  The food was delivered quickly, was plentiful and well prepared.  The service was quick, although perhaps could have used a little polishing.

We would definitely return if we are looking for breakfast without all the fluff like Cora's."}
{"text":"This place is great if you're looking for a huge breakfast and don't care about your health too much!  The food here is greasy as with all the sunset grills across the GTA, and don't expect to come away feeling refreshed and full of energy.  The food consists of something close to what you would get at Dennys, but better.  Eggs, toast, bacon, sausages, potatoes and fries are the main courses for most meals here.

Service staff are relatively friendly and come by once in a while to fill your juice or coffee.  Also the place is usually fairly clean, something which can't be said about Dennys.  The decor is that of a retirement home restaurant so don't expect much from that either.

Overall a decent place to grab a hearty breakfast and you will come away with food to take home as well.  My personal suggestion are the pancakes as they are probably the least greasy of all the foods on the menu.  If you're a heath freak though, this probably is not the best place for you as there isn't even a fruit or salad option for sides here."}
{"text":"Came for breakfast before work this morning- it's a Sunday at 8, we just finished our breakfasts and we're happy. 
I ordered the sunset special- eggs, home fries, bacon and 2 pancakes. It was all cooked perfectly. The bacon crispy, pancakes actually tasted a bit like cake (mmm...), home fries seasoned well, and scrambled eggs were perfect. 
Service was pleasant and quick.
The coffee wasn't great- which is why I'm giving a 4 star instead of 5.
Ill return- for sure..."}
{"text":"Been for breakfast Sunday morning. Very busy place but the server was still managing well and no mistakes with food served. The coffee refill was quite adequate. The only thing required is to tone down their price for breakfast which will boost me to come back regularly. Overall a very nice and comfortable place to spend a Sunday morning with family and friends."}
{"text":"There was a short wait, and the hostess seemed a little frazzled with how busy it was. However, once we got seated everything went rather quick. I got the salmon bennie and it was pretty good. Home style fries were a bit soft and soggy? Plenty of parking, outdoor seating, and good selection of breakfast foods!"}
{"text":"Just simple old fashioned breakfast-and cheap! It tastes great except for the home fries! Bland and burnt. Why can't they add something like Montreal steak spice? Or onions and lemon?"}
{"text":"The service are good. Nice location closet to my house, although the fruit doesn't taste fresh and they title themselves all day breakfast but they actually only open till 3pm...."}
{"text":"This place I recommend to anyone that lives or is traveling to Canada. The food was amazing and the service was great. Waitress was very on her job. Will come back again"}
{"text":"The name of the restaurant here is a bit confusing. The address is correct, but it's actually called Egg Sunrise Grill.

In any case, the food here is pretty good but not particularly amazing. It's pretty much your typical diner fare with above average portions for a cheap price. The space itself is functional and comfortable, great getting grub with a few friends.

Service was prompt and very good. The waitress that's served us on two different occasions seems very experienced with working in an accessible environment. We had a friend with us that couldn't use his hands very well. She made a point of putting straws in his drinks after seeing him struggle on our first visit. 

With the exception of the washroom downstairs, the place is extremely wheelchair friendly and tables are spaced far enough apart."}
{"text":"It's a pretty standard breakfast joint. We came to this location because both Fran's and the Senator had 20 minute waits. This location accommodated us immediately. Food and service were perfectly fine."}
{"text":"3.5 stars
We were randomly walking a few blocks from the Hilton one last morning before our flight out and stumbled on this breakfast place so we went in to eat.
I really liked my smoked salmon plate - came with bagel, cream cheese, lots of salmon, capers, $10.99.  OJ large was another $4.25.
Hubby's breakfast of likely canned corned beef hash had potatoes and egg, coffee, $10.99. Wasn't too bad at $30 for 2 (not including tip). The place is well lit and we had a window seat to watch folks ambling by like we did.  
Service was OK, not the friendliest as they're busy and staff act as if, \"It's just a job\" attitude."}
{"text":"I always come here when I was pregnant with my little one, but now I'm busy taking care of her I couldn't get a chance. I always love the warm welcome whenever I get in and service is perfect from beginning up to the last. The food is good. Fairly reasonable for the price. Will def come back and take my baby here."}
{"text":"If you don't know how to cook a simple breakfast then you shouldn't cook at all. This is the case for Sunset Grill, an all-day breakfast restaurant. I went here around lunch and found that its nearly vacant even the owner popped out and was disappointed that the restaurant was \"quiet.\" 

The breakfast I ordered contains decent sunny side eggs, stale dark bread that of which I dont know if its toasted or just hard, bacon that doesn't taste good and the most bland and disgusting potatoes I had ever eaten... for about ten bucks total, thats totally ripping you off.

For the service, its what u expect for a diner.. they check up on you often (although the diner was nearly empty) and the waitress was nice enough to cut a discount for me. 

I seriously don't know why this place is good, the fact that its a diner doesn't excuse it to be that bad... I rather go to Wimpys than this place and their portions are huge and actually have flavour rather than me sprinkling a shit ton of pepper on the potatoes to make it at least editable..."}
{"text":"Awesome food for an even better price. It can't get cheaper than this. This is a great place for people on a budget and you really do get a bang for your buck. The service is always amazing, they are always checking up on you and bringing coffee around. I do wish they had more vegan options, but I can't complain more than that. They've got a decent veggie burgers, fruits, and home fries! But of course, it is a breakfast place and we all know breakfast foods are rarely vegan. I come here quite often with my friends, and we are all students with not a lot of money, so this place works for everyone."}
{"text":"I am shocked the reviews for this place is so low! I absolutely love coming here whenever I'm visiting the old hood. I pretty much get the same thing every time, which is simple, but consistent. I will get their 3 pancakes plus a side of sausage, and a chocolate milk to wash it down. Their pancakes taste like a delicious cake, and their sausage is perfectly cooked. I have never had to wait for a table here, but it does get busy. I find their service very prompt, and for those who drink coffee, they are always asking if you need a top up. Bills are paid up at front.  It's located in a plaza, with tons of parking nearby. Honestly if you want a simple breakfast, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"This is a fantastic diner! We stopped here back in May while visiting Toronto and it was exactly what we were looking for - a classic diner serving great food, with good service, and a great price. We loved our meal and it was a great way to start our day. I highly recommend this place for a great breakfast!"}
{"text":"From the outside and even once I was inside, I had really low expectations of Sunset Grill. It's a Canadian chain, the inside was drab and very chain-like, and it was in downtown/financial area of Toronto.

As it turned out, the coffee was pretty good (hot and it kept coming), the eggs with peameal bacon and home fries was far better than it should have been. The eggs came out as I wanted them to, fried over easy. They were small eggs, and they should be since you get three, but no matter, the plate was overflowing with bacon and potatoes.

I wouldn't call this a stellar top notch breakfast, but for what it is, it's pretty good."}
{"text":"Service was friendly but my Caesar salad had ranch sauce on it instead and my pancakes tasted like they were made from no-name ingredients"}
{"text":"Ordered the light and fluffy pancakes as described on the menu. Service was fair and my beverage came quickly. Pancakes arrived at the table looking great . Real syrup was available at a great cost and I didn't want pancake syrup (caramel coloured liquid sugar) so I passed on both. The pancakes were hard to cut with a knife and didn't taste like much. Out of the 3 original pancakes  served I returned 2 1/2  for the bin. Nice atmosphere but won't be returning here anytime soon."}
{"text":"Sunset Grill, 205 Wellington St W. Toronto. 
Happened in to this place look for a breakfast, glad we did. Serving breakfast only with a complete menu. They use locally sourced small eggs so most meals come with three eggs. We tried lots of food, the omelet, blueberry pancakes, thick cut French toast both with great maple syrup. The link sausage is the mild pork inside a crisp casing. The thick cut bacon, is sweet and cooked crisp. It is chewy rather than just crumbling from the crispness. I had to try the corn beef hash so our table was out of space. The corn beef hash was cooked perfectly on the flat top with a little sear just like the home style potatoes. Kimmy was a delightful server, prompt and provided suggestions with the food. All the wait staff was very efficient. Get your next breakfast here."}
{"text":"Went in the early afternoon for some hangover breakfast food. I was planning on getting the veggie omelette but as I ordered the waitress recommended a special they were having that was a spinach, tomato, and goat cheese omelette with home-fries toast and coffee for $9.99, so I said \"O, yes please\". It was so worth it! I get veggie omelettes all the time so this was a delicious change. The waitress was friendly and there were many waitresses trying to keep our coffee cups full at all times. It reminded me of the diners in New Jersey except the menu was breakfast food only, and I didn't see any booths in the restaurant. It looked like all of the tables had pullout chairs, in a very open seating design. The food came out very quickly. There were a decent amount of people eating here and there was a lot of available seating. There were awards on the walls for their food. The prices were very affordable and I will be returning here."}
{"text":"We requested a delivery order, as we are often too busy to get out for lunch.  The staff was SO friendly.  The food is great - exactly what you hope for at lunchtime. We had a Sunset Philly and Tuna Salad Sandwich - both very good.  We liked the side-options. Really great experience!"}
{"text":"I read about this place in one of the magazines at my hotel...one of the best breakfast places!!"}
{"text":"I recently visited this Sunset Grill in the hopes of finding a great egg breakfast. While the place was clean and the food wasn't terrible, it was still pretty much the worst breakfast I've had in Toronto. The food tasted absolutely bland, the serving size left distinctly less than any other breakfast place you would go to. Just to add to the experience, the server we had was rude, slow, and clearly didn't care about her job or our experience at all.

The highlight of the visit was walking out and seeing a wall of \"Reader's Choice\" Awards for every year in the 2000s. Whoever those \"Readers\" are have no idea what good food is. Are they all crazy? I strongly suggest you walk away in any direction to find a better place nearby!"}
{"text":"We came here for breakfast one weekend. There was plenty of space around 10:00am and the parking lot was empty. 

The service was quick (which was excellent, because we were in a rush). We ordered the eggs benedict with salmon and a breakfast platter with strips of bacon (THE BACON WAS THE BEST PART). You can't go wrong when you order something with bacon. For the price, the portions are quite large and the food tasted fresh. It's exactly what you'd expect and want out of a breakfast place."}
{"text":"Love love love this place....straight up greasy spoon with some amazing food. Idon't think you can compare this location with the others. The food is WAY better at this location than the others. Not just bigger portions but fresher food. My favorite is the greek salad with grilled chicken. Wow, I can't get enough. My husband always gets a spanish omelette with jalapenos. Theres enough for his lunch the next day. Service is superiour. We've never had to wait long for our food. Looking for a good brunch/breakfast in the beaches, this is the place to go. ps. they do debit now but no credit."}
{"text":"I rarely come up to Stouffville for .. pretty much anything, so when a friend suggested we come here for breakfast, I figured 'why not'.

A good amount of seating, and a large open area makes this relatively smaller location seem bigger than it really is. A simple menu with good staple choices, it makes for a nice breakfast place. 

I got the regular bacon and eggs option, and it was quite good. Eggs made to your preference and nice bacon, with home fries. Doesn't get much simpler than that! Was quite happy with the overall brekkie since I was pretty hungry. 

Service was pretty good with friendly servers is always good, but there wasn't anything particularly special in the service though. 

A better experience than I anticipated from the star rating, but I probably won't be back as I'm used to go to Cora's and getting way more food! Plus, it's a bit 'far' for just some brekkie!"}
{"text":"Undercooked potatoes.  Bad service. Waitresses are not attentive. Will NOT return to this location (Erin Mills & Eglinton) ."}
{"text":"Breakfast here is awesome! The bacon is thick and perfectly cooked. Potatoes are devine. Eggs are cooked to your liking. And the prices are decent. I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"Not bad for the price. I had corned beef hash and the ratio of potatoes to the corned beef was a little too much. Other than that, the food was standard for a breakfast place, nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"Maybe we hit on a particularly bad day, but apart from our eggs, the food was dreadful, the home fries cold, tasteless and far too hard to bite through. I suspect they had been sitting in a pan for at least a couple of hours. The toast was equally bad and, really, how does a person ruin toast? It, too, was cold and hard and barely buttered. No love in this food prep at all. The one star, then, is shared between the eggs and the charming décor. But what a shame. We frequent the Sunset Grill up on Danforth at Coxwell and in all the times we have been there have never had anything but a delicious meal."}
{"text":"As far as hung over breakfasts go this one has to be one of the best I've ever had. It's not very often a lumberjack's breakfast lives up to it's name but this one surely did. The highlight had to be their thicker cut bacon which was a treat. I'd recommend the french toast as your side over the pancakes or waffles. 

As for the restaurant itself they pack you in and that's ok but my friends and I felt like giants sitting at a fischer-price kids table. Nice skylight at the back but beware they are a cash only business so hit the bank down the road before you get slammed by the ATM."}
{"text":"SLOW service. Food is bland. I've been here a few times and its always tough getting someone's attention. The last time I literally had to chase the waitress down who was too busy texting, just to get my bill. I don't like giving bad reviews and generally don't but this has happened too many times. Being told a coffee refill is coming and then never getting it, being passed over and not being checked on after an hour is unacceptable, especially when there were only two other tables occupied, one who was a single person the other a couple. If you're ok with mediocre food and have a lot of time and don't mind bad service ..well this would be the place, personally I would recommend Eggsmart Warden and Ellesmere or Coras off Mccowan for brekki."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a good \"greasy spoon\" in the city, then Sunset Grille is what you're looking for. It's cash only so make sure you come prepared.  See Ryan N's 5/23/13 review as I too had the lumberjack and would recommend the same - French toast as a side instead of the pancakes. Bon appetite!"}
{"text":"Just are here and the menu is good and the service was outstanding !! The waitress even brought us extra home fries for free !! The account was working a little to we'll was my only complaint"}
{"text":"Good food, ample portions, friendly, professional staff!  Need I say more?
This diner style restaurant serves a bottomless cup of excellent coffee.  The menu has varied breakfast choices. The food is well prepared and served quickly!  We liked it well enough that we're headed back there tomorrow morning before we leave town!"}
{"text":"Fast service, low prices, friendly servers and delicious food. Usually you only get two, maaaaybe 3 of those. This place hits all the marks. THE breakfast spot in Oakville."}
{"text":"I have never in my entire life had to wait for over 30min for bacon & eggs with French toast. The restaurant was only half full at the time and other tables which were seated after me got their food well before I did. 

My server said coffee was on the house due to the wait, yet the home fries which comes as a side did not even cover a quarter of the plate, you could count the individual fries that's how few there were. 

After receiving my food my server was no where to be found and another server who saw my frustration had to handle my bill. 

I don't know if this was an off day with my server but it's still unacceptable. I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Came to sunset grill for a quick bite before going to the library in the beaches. This location was cute, lots of room for seating. I ordered an egg white omelette with no oil or butter and got rye bread with it. Perfect and healthy way to start my day. The service was good but nothing too spectacular"}
{"text":"Neighbourhood breakfast joint. They seem to have a lot of regulars coming in. Good old traditional breakfast. Nice clean place. 

Ordered three eggs and ham. Scrambled eggs a bit dried. Pan fried homefries pretty good. Large portion for the price! Thick cuts of dark rye toast. Beware that they automatically put butter on, so if you don't want it ask for it on the side. 

Fast service, in and out. Nice and friendly servers! Annoys me a bit when the coffee and tea doesn't come w a saucer."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious and fresh.   Their salmon Benedict is phenomenal!  The service is usually great, but if they're slammed maybe not so much.  The portions are huge unless you order a light plate, but it reheats well.  In general, stay away on holidays, but go any other time."}
{"text":"This place has delicious food. It's not l greasy at all. The servers are all very friendly and the coffee is good. The Meat Lovers Omelette is my go-to, along with the pancakes, which are fluffy. They offer 3 types of toast."}
{"text":"There was nothing inherently wrong with the food, until I bit into an eggshell the size of a dime. They offered to remake my meal but I was off eggs after that. They didn't charge me.

You can find better breakfast all over town. This is just meh. Wait staff bring you the wrong stuff a lot, things kept getting mixed up. I'd pass."}
{"text":"It was a nice resturant; don't get me wrong! A bright and clean dining area, I had high hopes for Sunset. I ordered the Sunset breakfast which came with three eggs, four sausages, homefries and two pancakes. The price was pretty average for that standard fare at around $11. I was kinda dissapointed with my sausages which were heavily burnt and were evidently store bought; they lacked flavour and true sustance. I was happy with the preparation of my sunnyside up eggs though! As for the highly anticipated pancakes, I was quite dissapointed. They were quite dense and as a result, difficult to cut and were chewy. The avocado toast was fair, at around $5 for a dense slice covered in mashed avocados, peppers, and feta cheese. Overall, I recognize the effort of the cook staff and the attention to detail. Their waitstaff was courteous and accommodating, and service was quick! Perhaps due to the newness of the establishment, they do have a fair bit to go to compare to neighbouring breakfast establishments in Markham. Worth a shot for a mediocre breakfast, but it wasn't terrible."}
{"text":"Came for breakfast noticed wifi but they stated they don't share modem access in today's society one would think you offer it. No free refills, each cup you got to pay for. Overall not the best but not the worse."}
{"text":"Sub-standard breakfast. You're better off going across the street to Starbucks and getting a refrigerated breakfast sandwich. 

I ordered the turkey bacon & 3 eggs. The potatoes were just ok, and the toast was SLATHERED in butter, very inedible. The turkey bacon was also very overcooked. 

Service was terrible, had to ask another waitress to refill my fiance's coffee. 

And I'm sorry but the waitresses are all very unattractive and wear ill-fitting yoga pants. No one wants to see big wedgies walking around during Sunday brunch. BARF!!"}
{"text":"pretty happy that they opened a sunset grill near me.great portion sizes.i took off a star because they did not have wifi.once the waitress found out i was doing a review for yelp she we noticed that she started to pay more attention.she immediately said wow yelp!overall i was pleased with my breakfast sandwich."}
{"text":"Cool looking dive breakfast place with decent food, however the service is pretty slow.  I went for breakfast and it was fairly dead and it took about 25 minute's for our food.  This wouldn't have been terrible, however other tables received food before us that arrived after us.  Overall, it was okay."}
{"text":"I used to love this place, going at least once a week.  The staff is very friendly, the service is fast, the premises (and washrooms) are clean BUT  the food is no where near as good as it used to be.  The Eggs Benedict is terrible, today I tried their chicken club and chicken was way too salty.  It is a shame becuase as I said, I used to love this place."}
{"text":"Whether you love, or hate, the food here you can't deny that the location make up for any shortcomings.  A truly unique outdoor summertime hangout place in CLE with an eclectic crowd with above par live entertainment."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place because its right in the neighbourhood I grew up in, but the service was awful. The kid serving us was nice enough but just completely complacent.  He forgot our cutlery, coffee, and toast.  One of those is bad enough but all three?  Neither one of us got our toast til we were basically done out meal. And we only got it because I got up and told them.  Who did they think that toast sitting by itself under the warming lights was for? The food is decent but its breakfast, not Parisian dining, so food can't save this place. Management needs to wake up or It won't last."}
{"text":"A more wallet friendly breakfast joint. Small and always busy but service has been great the many times Ive visited."}
{"text":"I had tried another sunset grill location and was disappointed. I wanted to give sunset grill another try and was disappointed again. Both time I had eggs Benedict and I had the most terribly blend eggs ever. While the food is not something I'd recommend there, the staff and service was good."}
{"text":"I found the portions to be on the small side and wasn't thrilled with the taste of the home fries. Service was excellent. Prices average for this type of restaurant. There are better choices out there for a breakfast restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm going to make this quick.

There is NO reason for a table of 2, to wait (literally!) 56 minutes to get our food on a Thursday afternoon.

That's all."}
{"text":"I have been to many Sunset Grills and fondly remember some of them with great gusto. The one at the beaches for example: A hearty greasy breakfast at a good price at a very retro looking locale... with a skylight! ;-)

However service and quality seem to be going down over the years as Sunset Grill opens new locations and unfortunately, this one epitomizes that very downward slide. 

Which is a shame to me, since this one is within walking distance from me now and used to be a waffle's throw from my previous place... and you know I like me a lazy brunch. 

Alas, the only reason I went there last time was because I was sporting a fractured leg, was cast-ridden and wanted to avoid trekking too far a distance. Which does not say much for the quality of the food, does it?

Not only that, I also had made reservations in the past and they messed it up.  The first time they completely forgot/lost the reservation and had us --as we were a larger group, first wait for 22 minutes for a table to clear and in the end as no two tables did, had us squished into a single table with barely enough room to operate cutlery. Plus it was winter and the table was just left off the entrance, but that was just bad luck.
 
The other two times this happened, I was advised they did not take reservations anymore because they were too busy in the mornings --even though they literally had taken mine over the phone a day or two earlier. Seriously? 

So when that happened the second and third time, we just left and went to Spirits Bar and Grill on Church and Hayden St. which has a reasonable breakfast but it is not the breakfast place I had in mind and breakfast is not that bar's forte. The point is, I gave their service more than one chance and they did not come through. 

From a decour perspective this place lacks the retro vibe of some of the other locations and is in fact, in my opinion, just a little less drab looking than a Golden Griddle. 

Sadly, I am of the belief most customers come here due to its incredibly central and accessible location but the food... although at times served in large portions, it is still somewhat par and generic at best, specially when stacked up to comparable breakfast joints."}
{"text":"Cheap breaky alert!
How can you NOT love this place\"  they have an early morning special where you can get a full breakfast for UNDER 5$ 

It's a great location for something quick in the midst of financial district and close to the mall.

free refill coffee- which I always expect with restaurants but sometimes they don't offer, or the servers aren't attentive to the fact that my blood only circulates when it has 75% caffeine content

oh yes, and once i brought a friend over (yeah that's right..i suually like to have breakfast alone) and he was attempting to pick out some options and rearrange to get the optimal breakfasy combo- the server said, \"no, you probably don't want to do that\" and THEN suggested the EXACT same combination of food but in a CHEAPER way- \"this way you save money!\" she said.

How can you NOT love it when the server WANTS to save you money on a 5 buck breakfast?

Yes, I love it here."}
{"text":"I have been a loyal customer at the Erinmills location for years now. With that  being said, I was not surprised that I would equally be in love with this location  conveniently minutes from work. I only have a half hour lunch, so the girls and I ordered take out and pick up. Service was quick, and very friendly. The girls have ordered here before, and the owner seemed to have remembered them. It's always pleasant when a business takes the initiative to remember their clients. I ordered the light breakfast which came with one egg, fresh fruits, and toast with Jam. I am a big eater, which means it takes a lot to fill me. This meal filled me!! The fruit came in a separate container filled to the top. The egg was perfectly moist, even for take out and was definitely more than one egg. I opted for Rye which must have been cut from a large loaf because the two pieces of Rye was as big as my hand. For a \"light\" breakfast I felt great, it was healthy enough for me not to get sick, yet filled me for the rest of the afternoon. I think I will have to order this more often now, because I have reconsidered my usual \"French Connection\" order."}
{"text":"Good Service, Good Food, and Reasonably priced. What more can you ask for from a downtown Toronto breakfast place?"}
{"text":"Many are probably familiar with the Sunset Grill chain, and those who like it won't be disappointed.

It's a great location, situated right downtown Brampton. It's nicely decorated with nice high ceilings and a good layout. When I visited last weekend, it was already quite busy, so word is getting round and many clearly come here due to their name.

My experience was about the same as I've ever had at other Sunset Grills, a solid breakfast place that executes fairly well - though nothing that's going to floor you either. My kids liked their pancakes and I thought the corned beef hash was pretty good - albeit just ok. My wife thought her pea meal eggs benny was okay, but could've used something more.

Worth checking out, and it delivers on a solid breakfast. I may not necessarily find it exceptional, though it seems others do."}
{"text":"I have not heard good reviews about the Sunset grill breakfast chain but had to check out the one in my area for myself. I would say the service is slow and the food is average, nothing really special. My husband had the cornbeef hash with eggs and I had the chocolate pancakes with a side of peameal bacon. The pancakes seemed small for the price and not as light and fluffy as they advertised. As well, the season on the cornbeef hash was great, the beef was too finely minced that it did not have as much substance as other cornbeef hash we have tasted. Probably what made up for the meal was the freshly ground coffee and the homefries which were well-seasoned and tasted like roasted potatoes and not deep fried."}
{"text":"Pretty straight forward breakfast....I was in a rush...and they got me in and out pretty quick.  I thought coffee would be included...but that's my mistake."}
{"text":"I've been to other Sunset Grill locations before, and had a good experience, but I think my visit to this one was the first and last.
Food is pretty standard, as it is on the other locations... with room for improvement, but the personnel service was what completely shocked and dissapointed me.
I felt rushed from the moment we came inside, we couldn't take a couple of minutes to say \"hi\" to our friends, who were waiting for us there, because we were being harrassed to order, then to eat, then to pay and leave.
We barely finished our plates and were going to ask for a last cup of coffee, when the restaurant's manager asked us to leave the establishment because they were \"busy\"... sorry, but somebody needs to have some Customer Service 101 lessons before being hired for this position.
If you are in a rush, and don't care about the way you are treated at a family restaurant, then be my guest... but an all-day breakfast restaurant, in my opinion, should be a place where you can go, and enjoy the company or a read, while having delicious food brought over.
Food might be OK here, but that doesn't cut it."}
{"text":"Location: 3255 Rutherford Rd Unit 1 Vaughan ON L6A
Price: $$
Service: Okay

A lot of people told me to visit cause their breakfast is really yummy. I decided to go try. To be quite honest, it wasn't anything other breakfast place wouldn't have...

I ordered the French connection, while my mum ordered the sunset super. For the price that you pay the meal is pretty big. Their eggs are okay.. I liked the french toasted a lot; it was made on a Texas bread so there was a lot of room for soft dough inside. The home fries are ehh- I've had better! Overall the breakfast was okay... Would I go again? Probably maybe not..? 

A good thing is that they had wifi!! 

Verdict: try"}
{"text":"Good place to have breakfast. They have everything from eggs, bacon, sausage and toast to pancakes, waffles and omelettes. I really like florentine omelette and of course classic eggs and bacon and french toast. Fast service and good atmosphere. Free coffee refills."}
{"text":"Slim pickings for good standard breakfast food in the downtown area.   This place has been my go-to when in the area.   Like the coffee and Western sandwiches."}
{"text":"I've visited another location from this chain before and was less-than impressed. I was in the area and needed a good breakfast heading into a long day, so I decided to try it again.

This location is relatively new, and nicely decorated. The server was alone at the time, but managing about 10 tables and doing a great job in spite of that. That was at 7am on a Saturday, so they seem doing well for business.

I ordered the corn beef hash, which came with the usual suspects (toast, 3 eggs). I don't know what the standard preparation of the dish is, but I view Jim's Hideaway in Streetsville as my personal standard. In that regard, I prefer Jim's which integrates the potato and corned beef together; whereas here it was separate. I also feel the corned beef preparation wasn't as good either - not to say that I didn't enjoy it however. The scrambled eggs were a bit overcooked which mirrored my previous experience at another Sunset.

This experience was at least better than my other visit to this chain, and at least opened me up to coming again. That said, there's a few other places I'd choose first if I'm closer to them."}
{"text":"Portion size here is much smaller than every other location. Their service? Terrible. 

Ordered 3 pancakes - we received 6 instead and waitress told us we ordered the 6 and failed to fix the order. We ended up keeping it as we saw the conversation with the waitress wasn't going anywhere. 

As we're eating- we notice the pancakes near the bottom were half the size of the top two. They gave us tiny little baby pancakes...

Ordered grilled cheese -it was burnt. The side of potatoes I received was less than half the amount I get at any other sunset grill location. 

What a shame."}
{"text":"yay! great breakfast/brunch/lunch place!

the portions are huge and delicious!
the prices are great.
and it's a great destination to aim for if you're biking along the waterfront trail to the west of Toronto."}
{"text":"Excellent diner. Food is really good, fresh as can be. The service is relaxed and easygoing yet quick and efficient, always ready with the refill. My food came inside of 10 min. I had the Sunset Super - standard breakfast with pancakes instead of toast. A lot of food, I am stuffed. The coffee is great as well - what you'd find at a coffeeshop, not watered down at all. Come before 11am for free coffee with breakfast. This place satisfies body and soul."}
{"text":"Very very good breakfast. Was very busy in the restaurant but food came exceptionally fast. As well as the food itself was very good."}
{"text":"big portions and its a busy place.  Overall i suppose it was OK.  I suppose the price was about average too.  We were looking for a decent breakfast and other locations have provided this in the past but today, it just didnt come together.  I would suppose there were not enough servers on staff during this holiday season, the eggs were overcooked, the toast was cold, and not enough butter, the home-fries were bland.  I will give the another try later on, but this time it was a bit of a disappointment.  The coffee was the best part of the meal."}
{"text":"Now i have been to many locations of the Sunset Grill and enjoyed them all but I was not expecting this reliable feel good food place which I like so much to fall apart like this today.  A cluster of things that all just rub me the wrong way for a place that calls itself world famous.  When we arrived, the sign said seat yourself, so we did.   10 minutes later someone said hi as they walked by then handed us the menu they picked up from the greasy fingered patron 3 tables away.  OK I can overlook this.  Time passes, I can feel another grey hair taking root and suddenly our waitress appears.  Thank goodness, I don't know how to talk to my family without coffee.  This should be quick, there are only 3 of us.  Ana orders a simple vegetarian omelet but with a twist, she wants ham and cheese added to it.  So the entertainment is to watch the waitress struggle with their tablet ordering system on how to turn a veggie omelet into a pork and cheese offense to peta freaks.  This took a while, seriously took a while , but once we cleared that hurdle it was smooth sailing.............so I thought.
I ordered the Western sandwich with cheese on white and it comes with home fries, and ya my coffee.  My son wants the same and asks for the Western sandwich with cheese on white.  I said how about some sausage on the side, and Ana asked for a glass of orange juice.  Confusion time again.  You should have read the order back to us.  Our drinks came promptly.  But after a lengthily wait, our food finally arrived.  It must have sat a while because it was barely warm.  OK bye bye server, but wait! We don't have any utensils on the table.  *%#@%* how does that happen?
Find the waitress, ok not our waitress but a waitress and get some knives and forks, but three people need three knives and three forks, and we were short a knife.  I would have asked for another knife but we never saw the waitress again.  I ended up cutting things for my son.  He is 13.  Its been years since I cut his food.  I felt like a total tard.  The food was cold, and bland and now I have an attitude problem because this is not how its supposed to be.  Left a tip, why I don't know.  Paid at the cash register, why I don't know.  I am not going back.  Not to this location.  This cluster left a bad taste in my mouth that outweighed the bland food.  Nobody asked us if we wanted more water or coffee or juice, and the sausage was overcooked and the potatoes were mushy and bland.  I don't usually show up for amateur night for any event and don't want to waste my time here again.  So take away one star for the wait, take away one star for not knowing how to use your system, take away one star for no utensils, and take another for short changing us on the utensils you brought and take another star away for the bland food and another star is deducted for not keeping my cup full.  You owe me one star.  Understand, I'm not happy to pay you $41 plus a tip to endure that joke of a service and bland food."}
{"text":"Walked in and sat down right away. I ordered the French toast and my kids ordered the chocolate chip pancakes. You are served a lot of food so don't worry about not being full. The food came out fast which I liked.  Service was good also."}
{"text":"Decent spot. Lots of seating space. The breakfast was average. Tried the salmon eggs with hollandaise. Pretty good. Definitely sizeable portions for the money."}
{"text":"October is the BEST time at Whiskey Island.  No bugs!

They still are carrying Red Stripe's BIG STUBBIES!  Yeah!"}
{"text":"We've been regulars here for several years. Love that they have real maple syrup - many restaurants at this price point only give you the fake stuff. It's extra, but worth it.  Pancakes aren't greasy and I welcome the recent addition of blueberry and chocolate pancakes. Would like to see a salad option in place of potatoes for the egg dishes, though."}
{"text":"Came here with my girlfriend for breakfast. It was super busy around 10:30 am , but our server helped us get seated quickly.

I ordered the salmon breakfast and my girlfriend ordered three eggs with turkey bacon. 

My salmon breakfast came with a toasted bagel , cream cheese , lettuce, smoked salmon, onions, capers, and some veggies. I was a bit disappointed that all the ingredients came separately and I had to make my own bagel sandwich. However, on the plus side, the salmon portions were quite generous and the food tasted good. 

My girlfriends food came as three scrambled eggs, 4 slices of turkey bacon and a generous portion of home fries. The home fries were delicious while the eggs and bacon were mediocre. 

My girlfriend noticed a hair in her turkey bacon midway through her meal. The server took her food back and quickly brought her another full meal without any arguments.

The service was great as all the servers were super nice. There was a person walking around refilling coffee, another person taking orders, and another person picking up all the dirty dishes. In addition, our food came out extremely quickly which was a bonus.

Overall, a nice place to visit for some breakfast. Nothing I would go out of my way for though."}
{"text":"The staff here does not understand the concept of lines. Very slow service. Very bad hygiene practices, waitress had a persistent cough and did not wash her hands as she expelled droplets all over her hands in plain view of the manager, Disgusting!"}
{"text":"We went to Sunset Grill for lunch at a last minute second decision. Service is walk up counter service and they bring the food to you. Service was quick and friendly. The BF got a club sandwich, basic with the usual and he said it was good. I got the Blackened Chicken Chipotle Wrap, it was good. Basic, blackened chicken, lettuce, tomato and chipotle mayo. BF got potato salad which to me tasted like it had some jalapeno in it? It was good though. The portions are a good size. It was nice to visit a different local lunch joint but I don't think we'll be back unless we are in the area. They seemed to get alot of business from the shops and other business in that area, so it's good to know they will stay busy."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service. Menu is quite large but unfortunately not too many vegan and vegetarian options. The fruit salad and salad I ordered was a bit pricey. My mom and aunt both ordered burgers which was a better value. They both enjoyed it and the portions were a very good size."}
{"text":"Second time to Sunset.  Had the strawberry pancakes last time and they were delish.  

Busy on a Sunday morning but didn't wait too long for a seat.  Ordered veggie omelette this time around.  

Coffee is a bit weak 

Service is friendly and great.  Definitely come back again and again"}
{"text":"I came here and ordered steak and eggs.  I always get my steak Medium Rare and it was decent for the price. Steak and Eggs is around $14 and their classic breakfast is a great price as well. I find their food can be to salty sometimes and consistency is not always the greatest.  However, their service is always on point and the staff are very friendly.  I usually always go to Sunny Morning in Mississauga so my expectations are pretty high for breakfast joints....and after all they say that Breakfast is the most important Meal of the day so you might as well make it a great one!"}
{"text":"We go here occasionally with a lunch group that gathers every Friday at different restaurants. The food is pretty good. My complaint is they can't seem to serve a group of 8 to 12 people and get all the orders right. Plus, they serve half of us and by the time food comes for the others, the first bunch is almost done eating. Toast never comes out at the same time as the meals. It's toast.How hard is it to  make that? I think if they had even one more person on staff, they could get it right. And yet, we keep going back."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast and lunch place.  Always fast and consistent quality.  Service is also great."}
{"text":"Location: Near the Rogers Center, where I spent the majority of my day lined up for the U2 show!

The place: It's of a decent size with a basic decor. It's a chain restaurant and I guess you kind of get that feeling when you walk inside. In any case, I wasn't going for the decor so.... 

The goods: I ordered a vegetable omelet, a side of turkey bacon and lemonade. The omelet was huge! Lots of vegetables - it was good. The turkey bacon was also good - there were 4 slices but it's those wide strips - not the skinny ones like proper bacon. I liked the lemonade though it was a little too sweet so I added water to it.

Service: Good. 

Price point: Well - had I known it would cost me $30 to eat breakfast, I would have gone elsewhere. The bacon extra was $5, for starters. You can likely eat elsewhere in TO for a lot less. Check the prices before you order!"}
{"text":"I guess you get what you pay for. I did not enjoy anything here. Cora's might be more costly but much tastier then this place."}
{"text":"I like having a diner in the Financial District (FiDi). I was seated at a cozy booth by the wall since I was dining alone I liked that they did that.

I ordered the Sunset pancakes. Comes with three 4\" pancakes ($5.99). She tried to upsell me on whipped cream and strawberries which sounded delicious, but I am watching my calories, and my wallet (just came from a stellar job interview).

She brought my coffee promptly and refilled it routinely throughout my stay.

Price was around 9 bones including tax for cakes and coffee, not a bad deal."}
{"text":"Walked in for a Valentine's Day brunch around 2:30. Honestly the food and coffee was really good.

I got the waffles which is probably the best I've ever had (better than de metres)!! And their coffee is really good as well. 

My partner wasn't so thrilled with his food. He asked for well done eggs and found his yolk was still a it running. His French toast wasn't very French toast like - it looked more egg toast than sweet with cinnamon and nutmeg etc. He was also surprised the sunset special didn't come with toast as most places serve toast with plates containing eggs, sausage, home fries and add ons. 

Overall it is a good breakfast place."}
{"text":"Sunset Grill is the perfect place for a weekend brunch. Customers are lined up out the doors on the weekend but the wait goes by fast as you and the other members of your party pick out your favourite cat drawings on a huge poster titled \"100 Cats and 1 Mouse\" that hangs in the entryway. 

The service is fairly fast, the wait staff friendly, and the food cooked up fresh. I always opt for the default breakfast spread - 3 eggs, bacon, home fries & toast. It is on the greasy & heavy side, but  the generous portions are overall pleasing. 

I recommend a post-brunch stroll of local Queen St. East shopping or walking along the lakefront boardwalk to help with digestion."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS NOW CALLED THE WHISKEY ISLAND STILL & EATERY
https://www.facebook.com/sunsetgrilleohio

During a visit to Cleveland this past weekend we enjoyed some time on a boat docked at the Whiskey Island marina, which is adjacent to the Sunset Grill.  After a bit of time on the boat, we moseyed over to the Sunset to listen to the band and do some people watching.  We were not disappointed!  

While I have no idea about the food as we didn't eat here, reading from the prior reviews, you may be better off bringing a cooler.  You could eat from said cooler on some picnic tables closer to the marina if you so chose that option.  Just putting it out there.

The location is awesome, the views are spectacular, and the people watching was a delight.  Lots of drunk people (and a few sober ones) dancing, including one middle-aged woman who's shorts dropped to her ankles while she was gyrating to a \"GunsNRoses\" cover by the band.  Nice purple thong, m'lady!

The beers are cheap, the crowd is fun and the band, at least on this night, was what you could hope for with no cover charge.

I'll be back on my next visit to town, hoping to see more purple thongs."}
{"text":"Since this place has opened, the food, presentation of food and overall quality has gone down hill. Its like they are getting cheap with what they put on your plate.
I was in the other day to give it another try.....
Ordered food, and the server got my partners food wrong and my food was luke warm. (sent it back) 
No one really cared that the food that came out was wrong and cold. The lady at the cash didn't even ask how my food was... just more interested in taking my money....
Go to the Coach House on Yonge and Church... much much better"}
{"text":"First time. First impressions were excellent; hostess, server, food, service, price - all good.  The iPod ordering system was pretty cool - first I've seen in a restaurant. 
Debbie was our server and she was awesome!  She was open to questions about the ordering system and offered me to place my own order with it. 
I'd go back, the food was very good including decent coffee. The OJ was a little pricey at $2.50 for a small glass but it was fresh squeezed and very good. 
It wasn't very busy for a Sunday morning so it's still a well kept secret but may not be for long as its only been open 6 months. 
Check it out.."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here on a recent trip and enjoyed it. Pretty busy for early Sunday morning with friendly staff. Very tasty meal and would highly recommend it. Don't order the glass of organge juice. . .$$$."}
{"text":"Sunset Grill at Whiskey Island is my favorite spot in the summer. Its reminiscent of something you'd see in a larger city, with the outside bar and small green space located next to a marina. 

In the summer, watching the sunset over Big E is a grasping visual. In the summer, I'd say the views from the Grille beat that of any bar or restaurant in Cleveland. Literally, you're on the water. Okay, not 'literally' on the water, because then you'd be some type of superhuman or one of the figures from the Bible. 

Wendy Park is right next door. If you find yourself boatless, play some sand volleyball (the courts are right along the lake) or have an afternoon picnic and visit the Sunset Grill for a nightcap (you're also allowed to buy alcohol from the Grill and take it into the park). As an added bonus, you'll get to watch all of the fancy sunburned boaters come off their fancy boats. You'll consistently use the term \"fancy\" with sarcastic tone because you'll be jealous they own a boat and you don't.

Pets are allowed. There's an area to fill up water bowls. On a weekend, you can bring a blanket, lawn chairs, your pooch, listen to the band and throw back some cold ones. Who would actually throw a cold one? Where did that phrase even come from? Why am I questioning that phrase during a review when I could just erase the text before I hit submit?

The drinks are priced a little higher than your average watering hole in Cleveland, but they're a little cheaper than what you'd find in trendy spots like the Warehouse District or Ohio City. Food was good from what I've had. Simple, no frills items like bratwurst, Angus burgers and beer can chicken. [EDIT: They've updated the menu and some of the facilities since this review, the items are the same, no frills, but still decent enough] Most of the items are under $10 and the quality of the food reflects the price. If the food would be a little higher quality, this spot would easily be five stars."}
{"text":"Breakfast might be our most important meal of the day...at least after a late night out so we headed for Cora's which we had been to before many times, but after leaving our hotel walked right into this place. It seemed worth a shot so we went in. We were seated right away and our waitress came in and took orders promptly. The food was really good especially the home fries and when the bill came the damage wasn't too bad at all. Would definitely stop here again, especially if you are looking for a greasier, heavier breakfast."}
{"text":"I've been to Sunset Grill plenty of times and they never disappoint. The service is fast and friendly and the food is fantastic. The only downside is that you often smell like breakfast food after you leave!"}
{"text":"Newly opened and still some things to figure out (such as not offering poached egg on a Benedict... isn't that in the definition?). 

We waited about 45 minutes for our brunch, with apologies from the waitress as she blamed the kitchen for being 'new at this'. We were more disappointed in her attitude than anything else. When the food came, it was great, and on par with other locations.

This area really needs food, and good food. I look forward to changing this review to one more positive in the months to come!"}
{"text":"Ever since the new owner took over this location has gone steadily downhill. The food that was always cooked perfectly before has needed to be sent back and is overall lacking. The new owner consistently walks around with a scowl on his face and appears less than well groomed. There is a young female waitress there with many colored braided weaves who is unpleasant in attitude and unprofessional at best. So sad to see what it has become since owners changed :("}
{"text":"The restaurant is very nice. It's a very casual and laid back atmosphere. I had eggs, homefries, and bacon. It was really a good breakfast! 
I've been going here for my entire life, my parents would bring us down to the beaches and then we would go out for breakfast. 
Good prices too. 
Very traditional breakfast."}
{"text":"Very plain. Nothing special. There's much better restaurants and brunch places in this area. But if ur just looking for something simple like eggs and bread, this is ur go-to place"}
{"text":"Perfect spot for brunch! This sunset grill is still relatively new, opened up shop a month and a half ago (I took my time writing this so it's late lol). Really enjoyed my visit here as the food and fruits were fresh. I ordered the crazy big breakfast with blueberry pancakes cuz I was feelin like a champ. Everything was freshly made and I absolutely loved every bit of it. The place itself was clean and the staff were very friendly! Lots of room inside but some people may feel like it is cramped. I personally found it just fine, maybe not if you rock a winter jacket. Service was quick, even for a busy long weekend. I will definitely be visiting again if I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"I like this place! Service is friendly, although a little slow. Food is decent and portions are good for the price. Omelets are HUGE and the pancakes came in a maple leaf shape for one of the breakfast combos! :) one annoying thing about this place is paying at the cash register.. Overall a good place for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Food is greasy but great if that's what you're looking for! Their lumberjack breakfast is great value... you will definitely leave full. I've had their bennys before and they were decent - no complaints."}
{"text":"Now I consider myself a breakfast expert, because I love Breakfast! 
I mean I got super excited when I found out that you could have breakfast any time of day in North America. 

I've also always considered Bloor West a great \"filled with people\" street. I found my experience here very blahhh. On a weekday morning around 10am I am mostly looking for coffee and protein or carbs with syrup. 

What bugged me the most about this place was the constant loud complaints between staff members about non present staff members. Add that to an already bland breakfast gives this place a pass."}
{"text":"I mean , all sunset grills are pretty much the same. There a bit pricy but good. Nothing special. Also few years when they first opened we were there and they kicked us out because we were done eating ... so I mean would I go back ? No. but there all the same."}
{"text":"Delicious all day breakfast.  Light and dark rye options!  Reasonably priced and the service is excellent.  Very attentive staff... Even got a coffee to go with my breakfast!"}
{"text":"Have only been here twice in the morning during the week.  You can seat yourself and both times the place had plenty of seating options.  The food is the standard of what you would expect for a breakfast place and service was really great both times.  Food came quickly and was good.  Only reason I took off two stars was because when we were paying at the cash we saw one of the kitchen staff handling the food with his bare hands - he was patting down bacon strips and sausages on a greasy rag (I guess to soak up more grease) and then he took the food with his bare hands and was putting them on 2 customer plates - I would like to believe that his hands were clean but still don't understand why utensils weren't used instead.  Not sure if we will be coming back."}
{"text":"Decided to check out this location since it is right around from where my parents live!

At first, we were very happy with the service -- she was speedy and courteous.  Did she forget a request that was made? Yes, but minor detail. What was frustrating was that waitresses who were waiting other tables told our waitress that we clearly needed service, and still, she thought it would be a better idea to sit down to talk to a gentleman at another table.  Frustrated, I made my way to the cashier and asked to pay for my bill.

The food was good, but for some reason, the pancakes were, in my opinion, very \"yummy\" for pancake quality.  Not too sure why, but I ended up only eating half of the two pancakes.

The establishment is clean and bright, but while the photos on yelp indicate that it has an outdoor patio, it actually does not (I walked all the way around).  Just thought I'd note that -- since I am a fan of outdoor eateries!"}
{"text":"It was early morning and I was incredibly hungry for some eggs. I was eating junk food the day before and desperately needed real food. I recommended going here instead of Cora's or Denny's (that were in the area) because I went to sunset grill in downtown Toronto and it was great. The restaurant itself was clean and good looking. The servers were all very friendly. 

But my food was HORRIBLE and the coffee tasted watered down. I ordered the eggs benedict with smoked salmon. The salmon had a funky smell and taste to it. It definitely was not fresh. The eggs were runny and they drowned them in hollandaise sauce. I barely finished half. It was a nightmare to eat and a waste of a meal. 

The bathrooms also smelled absolutely disgusting.  Not sure what cleaning product they used but it smelled like sulfur."}
{"text":"The first thing that struck me in regards to that place is the wooden furniture and the rooster in the middle! The location is pretty sweet with lots of parking spots and free WiFi. I ordered sausage and egg breakfast and it tasted fresh. The waitress was friendly. You can never go wrong with an all day breakfast diner."}
{"text":"This is more a 3 star place, but I am giving 4 stars because of the excellent service.  All the servers were joyful, smiling and helpful and helped my day get off to a good start.  In addition, they use iPods to place orders so that the orders go directly to the kitchen. 

I had the eggs sunset, which is basically eggs benedict.  It's typical diner version of eggs benedict, but they give you three eggs instead of two eggs.  Also, eggs were poached perfectly.  A nice runny yolk oozing over the English muffin under the Hollandaise sauce. A perfect high calorie breakfast for a Sunday morning. :-)"}
{"text":"I like the breakfast specials from this place.  They are fairly cheap. 4.99 for 3 eggs,home fries and toast.   The eggs are good and this fills you up for the day since they give you a bunch of starches.  

However, being a breakfast place, I'm a bit disappointed by the coffee quality as it tastes like the old McDonald's coffee (before they improved to the McCafe style coffee).  Also, the potatoes are too salty.  

But if you're really hungry and need food for breakfast, it's not a bad option if you are in the area, but not worth any special trip there.  

It'll do the job for protein and carbs in the office but there are much better options in the Yorkville area if you're visiting the area."}
{"text":"I always enjoy getting brunch at Sunset Grill at this location. The prices are reasonable, and the food is consistently good!"}
{"text":"I love breakfast- it is my all time favourite food.
I can eat it at anytime of the day. I heard this place had great Back bacon breakfast and since its my hubby's favourite I thought I'd surprise him and take him and or son out for some Breakie.

Sunset grill reminds me of the mom n pop places you find a bit further north of vaughan. Its got that homey feel.
We went for an 11:00 am saturday brunch (because lets face it, with this much breakfast who's got room for lunch?) and I don't know if it was our poor waitress who was tired or overworked or what but we felt really neglected from the get-go.
You walk in and the sign says PLEASE WAIT TO BE SEATED.
10 minutes later a waitress who has her hands full says..sit where ever you want. (ok)
Then 10 minites in we're trying to sneak a peak at their menu on their wall until my husband spots some menus at another table so we got our own menus....(hmm)
Then we take a quick glance at the menu items.
This place is not a pricey a la Coras..but it is not cheap breakie either.
Our breakfast came to $25 after tax and tip.
The back bacon is really great, I will say that. Its cute quite thin and its properly cooked and you get about 4 pieces.
The rest of the breakfast is standard. 3 eggs, toast, and homefries.
Although the portion size was quite a bit smaller than what I expected it was still a lot of food. And the homefries are FRESH. at least thats how it seems..they are actual potatoes with peel and all. So it was nice to not get the standard pre-frozen, deep-fried homefries.
The price for a standard breakfast with either bacon or sausage is about $5.99
The backbacon breakie is about $8.99
And the steak n eggs is $11.99 (Which I will probably try next time)"}
{"text":"À name far too ironic to enjoy the food. Why call it sunset grill if it's a breakfast restaurant? It was extremely difficult to explain to my son the difference between sunrise and sunset, due to his disabilities, and this restaurant really threw a monkey wrench into it. The waffles I had were still great however, and my two kids liked the friendly staff, despite being confused by their name to no end."}
{"text":"C'était un très bon restaurant, j'ai pu avoir de la nourriture pour deux à moins de trente dollars et nous étions vraiment rasassies. Par contre, je pense que que l'on s'est fait avoir pour la portion qu'on a eu.
En effet, chez Cora j'ai le même déjeuner (3 oeufs, saucisse et bacon, 2 crepes) avec en plus des fruits et du pain pour a peu pres le même prix pour encore deux personnes.
La nourriture était bonne, mais les pommes de terre était un peu fade et pas super bien cuit. J'ai du rajouter du sel a deux reprises même si habituellement je n'en prends jamais...
Mais bon...A vous de juger a votre tour :-D"}
{"text":"Always crowded, which is awesome because its worth it! Have been going to this breakfast place for a long time, and love every time I visit. 

Their eggs are to DIE FOR. Omelettes, Florentines, Sunnyside up, yum! So good, everything better than anticipated. The hollandaise sauce is absolutely exceptional, definitely a favorite. Pancakes, waffles, and all their items are DELISH! 

Really like the staff and customer service; fast, sweet, and apologize & admit mistakes if anything goes wrong (which barely happens). Keep up the great stuff! :)"}
{"text":"Most unorganized place i went. 
When we sat down, 1 person said this is reserved and i asked where is the sign? 
We ordered, foods were getting ready by the cook and keep putting on pickup conter but between 9 wait staff nothing was going to tables each food was sitting there for 10 minutes. Our food came and i touched was cold and told the waiters that i want fresh because its been sitting there and its cold, with attitude  she shows the other side of resturant and replies that you see its busy.
Took the food back change the sausages only and in 1 min brought it back to me. My sons, wife and daughters food were cold as ice. VERY BAD MANAGEMENT, POOR WAIT STAFF. If you like COLD breakfast then go here, otherwise dint because you will waste tour money."}
{"text":"Nice clean place, but somewhat lacking in food quality for the price. I'd been wanting to come since the sign went up (it opened recently), but I was surprised at how tiny and crowded this place felt. Plus, cold air kept us cold throughout our meal. 

We had the French toast, which were nicely cooked, but with no taste (had to add lots of syrup), and when I asked for whipped topping they charge $2.50!!!

We also had bacon & eggs. The bacon was good, but the potatoes were too salty and unevenly cooked. 

Everything else was just ok, but not worth it. I'll be sure to try them again another time."}
{"text":"I came here on the weekend while my family was in town. It was jam packed with people which is always a good sign.

However, I found the food pretty meh at best. My pancakes were burnt and overcooked, they tasted like it for sure. The potatoes were very bland, not an ounce of seasoning. That was disappointing but I guess that's why there was salt and pepper on the table. My mother's bacon had a few raw strips of bacon, like they looked like they didn't even touch the heat! My husband said his food was good but the same issue with the pancakes. So all in all, the food is not good here at all. In spite of this, the service was really good from our waitress. She was super bubbly and happy and was very apologetic when it came to my mothers food. She was the only redeeming quality about our visit here."}
{"text":"I love the breakfast on a weekdays here. Went few times.

The waitress that works by herself is so nice and helpful. Its also REALLY affordable.
Definetly recommend to everyone!!!"}
{"text":"Went here for brunch. Food was delicious! Came out quick. I couldn't finish my sunset breakfast (eggs Benny on peameal). 3 eggs!!! The potatoes were so good!! I'd return. 

Only complaint was service was a bit slow. They only had 2 servers on though. 
Food is fresh & they try to buy local where possible. There are lighter options on the menu which is nice to see."}
{"text":"First time here for breakfast. They don't make eggs with just the egg white. We didn't think it was asking a lot (just don't put the yolk in) but the waitress said no the cooks won't do it. 
Food was good. Not fantastic. Staff walk around using iPods. 
Conclusion Angelique's is better."}
{"text":"I had the bacon, poached eggs, home fries and toast.  It was passable but certainly not memorable.  The poached eggs had an odd texture - the whites were a bit overcooked even though the yolk was still slightly runny in the center.  The home fries were ok-ish.  I'd still return just because there aren't a lot of places to have a fast cheap hearty breakfast in the downtown core."}
{"text":"This is a great place for an inexpensive, large, delicious breakfast or lunch (they are not open for dinner). I have been here several times and have always been happy. You order and pay at the counter then they deliver you food. I like the daily specials and the french fires are really good. Bonus, they deliver to the surrounding area."}
{"text":"I wanted my eggs stirred and fried but not scrambled. They wouldn't do.it for me that way. I explained that he action of scrambling eggs while cooking releases sulphur and scrambled eggs give me a headache but wait person just told me to take it up with head office. So I ordered the blueberry pancakes. They came plain on a large plate. Taste like raw batter I'm the middle but flavourful was ok. I asked for a small glass of milk on the side for my coffee because I don't like creating extra waste for the environment with tons of those little plastic containers. She refused to do that. But yes she WOULD let me order a glass of milk and pay for it. I have never been refused this request before in all.my years of eating in restaurants. I requested real maple syrup for the pancakes and she brought a small bottle but it wasn't sealed. So I assume they refill the small bottles. THEN I was charged $2.99 for the maple syrup without advising me!!!  So I THINK it was real maple syrup but not sure. My friend's hash browns were very salty and he didn't even add salt.  I requested Splenda as a coffee sweetener but they don't have it. I don't want to use Sugar Twin because it is made with cyclamates. So I had to use real sugar for my coffee. Recap: NO stirred fried eggs, NO Splenda, NO milk on the side for my coffee, unsealed maple syrup, salty hash browns, hidden charges  and undercooked pancakes. THEN confrontation with the manager at front counter. He WAS UNBELIEVABLY rude. Made us pay for the maple syrup. I didn't know it was on the tiny menu. He yelled at me at the front counter, asked me if I wanted to make a scene and told me I complained about everything and expect to get it for free. That is not what happened.  I will NEVER GO TO A SUNSET GRILL AGAIN. They don't care about customers."}
{"text":"I was seated for one person , when I came in the girl sat me near the washroom and gave me a menu. The store was NOT busy , I waited for 20 minutes and tried to get the server ( 5 of them standing there) that were at the front cash eye contact . No one looked at me, so after 5 mins more of waiting I walked up to the front and asked the cashier \" is anyone going to take my order \"? The 4 ladies looked at each other and one said oh did anyone not take your order?? And I said no I was waiting for my serve to come back but no one came . I asked to change my seat to the front of the restaurant. The girl took my older but really seemed like she didn't care . I was very disappointed with the food quality and the service! I can't believe they forgot about me , it's not like the attire was supper busy ... there was only 5 people in the restaurant and 5 servers doing nothing but talking to each other . Never again. , the worst service ..."}
{"text":"This was our second time coming here for breakfast and like the last time, we enjoyed it! We stay at the Trump hotel and this seems like the closest diner. Just a 4 minute walk up Bay and then Richmond. The atmosphere is nice for a diner -sunny and airy feeling with plenty of table space. Chocolate chip pancakes are great! And I love that when I order the toast, it doesn't come smothered in butter. The breakfast potatoes are nice, too. Not too greasy and not too heavily flavored -they border on being bland. Eggs are the worst here, though, unfortunately. They are very small and not cooked enough, even for over easy. They often seem watery and way too runny -almost seem like they're not cooked enough, safety-wise. Coffee is also not that great, here. We often stop at a Starbucks/Timmy's on the way here. Will probably keep coming back though as long as we stay nearby! Convenient, good service and decent breakfast food!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and food was okay. Burger was a little charred/overdone and they also got the order wrong."}
{"text":"Best crab cake eggs Benedict I have ever had. Girlfriend and I came for her birthday in Friday morning. Staff was super friendly and food delicious. If you're in the area and are hungry for some breakfast, don't miss out. One downside, bill came before we asked, it wasn't busy so there was no need for that"}
{"text":"Good food, decent portions, lots of seating for everyone, very casual and easy going environment and great friendly staff was my experience in this place and I've been here twice!"}
{"text":"Wonderful service. Solid breakfasts. Large portions.     They serve Molson Canadian too. Great stop if you are headed north from Toronto."}
{"text":"Love this place for breakfast. Servers are fantastic and the food is exactly what you'd expect from a breakfast place. Get there early to avoid the lines, it's busy for a reason!"}
{"text":"It's nice location and the food here is ok. It's a little greasy which is not good for breakfast. It would be better if they keep the store cleaner as well."}
{"text":"I just returned from Sunset Grill and was very disappointed.  I will never go back!  I had a craving for pancakes and so ordered \"fluffy pancakes\" from the menu.  Bad move!  They were solid, not at all fluffy.  A woman next to me ordered a waffle with fruit but told the staff she couldn't eat it and to take it back, she'd have toast instead.  How hard can it be for a breakfast place to make good pancakes?"}
{"text":"Great spot for a casual breakfast eatery in Aurora. Their menu has everything I look for in a breakfast place and the prices are reasonable. Their are waffles, pancakes, French toast, omlettes, breakfast sandwhiches and more.  Today I had the strawberry waffles and added a side of bacon. The waffle was soft on inside and crisp on the outside / just right; it came with strawberries prepared two ways, fresh cut up and a small bowl compote style with whipped cream too. I enjoyed it!  My mom had the 3 eggs & bacon (your choices are bacon, sausages, ham or turkey bacon) home fries and toast ( white/whole wheat or pumpernickel choices). She was pleased. I tasted the potatoes it was a bit hard today. 
Service was great, the server came frequently to refill our coffee and she was friendly.  
We had a relaxing morning with some good food."}
{"text":"I ate here right after flying into Toronto and stopping at the hotel. We had to wait for about 10 minutes, as the place was completely packed. That being said, when we did sit down, we had to wait awhile to get service. However, once he came, our server was fantastic! He was funny and gave great suggestions to the kids at the table. I ordered the eggs florentine, which was delicious. My only complaint was that the side \"home fries\" were undercooked. Seriously? What kind of breakfast place undercooks potatoes... especially since it comes with at least half of their dishes. Anyway, this is a cool little place to try if you're by Yonge Street."}
{"text":"This place is great for breakfast and for sandwiches and things but it's definitely not the best place open. Service is good and everything is so-so. I will definitely be coming back but I do wish they would improve their service and their prices a bit."}
{"text":"Website says open at 4pm on Good Friday, they actually closed at 3pm. What's the point of website hours then?"}
{"text":"Great and friendly service, very kid friendly. Food is consistently good. Good brunch place in Richmond hill"}
{"text":"I came here last week and was not disappointed. The bacon here is juicy and thick, not thin and burnt. The eggs were fluffy and the portion sizes were hefty. I always leave with leftovers for a late morning snack because they put so much on your plate. Of course, the home fries are a bit crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Service is always impeccable!"}
{"text":"Food was very good the service was very good. Your typical breakfast restaurant. I wish you could give half stars. If i find myself back in the area i would return."}
{"text":"For someone that never has Breakfast prior to start of work, it is nice to have a  STANDARD Breakfast during LUNCH break from time to time.  The advantage of this place is that you KNOW what you will get coming to this place.

3 Eggs, Ham or Sausage, Home Fries, Toast & Jam.  That is ALWAYS what I come here for and it's great because I never have to read the menu ever.  That and a cup or two of Coffee-flavoured Coffee makes a great start to the 2nd HALF of my day.

I've tried OTHER items here too but I do not associate Sunset Grill for those items where you can get those at other places.  My PHILOSOPHY at Sunset(only location I've been) is K.I.S.S.  

I guess I can always cook the same Breakfast for much less $ before I head to work but then I'm always LATE to work already and IF I ever make food in the morning I think it should be for lunch which I never bring anyways.

TIP: If you come in and see the waitress BUSY, grab your own SEAT and MENU... She'll be right with you but then you should already know to get 3 Eggs, Ham or Sausage, Home Fries, Toast & Jam, and Coffee!"}
{"text":"Update... There's a small special page of Moksha Yoga Menu
Not too many items but looks healthy which leads to pricE.
Healthy breakfast ingredients I cannot pronounce except for Eggs. 
Maybe the Yogis know what those superfoods are?

I stick to my Sunset Sandwich(Peameal style Bacon, Egg and Cheddar)"}
{"text":"Always a great breakfast. Weekends are busy so budget your time accordingly. But during the week, always fast. And regardless the day...always a smile from the staff. Usually served by a gentlemen with glasses (I'm afraid I forget his name) - anyway, he's been there for years and he's an absolute pleasure! Great spot! Omelettes are phenomenal"}
{"text":"I've been to the location on the Danforth but it's my first time at this location. Definitely more modern looking but still has an old time diner feel to it, and it looks awesome -- very spacious, perfect lighting, and a decent amount of seating.

Our waitress was nice. She was cheerful and helpful with recommendations. 

To eat we got the Caramel Apple Waffle Supreme -- caramelized apples, cinnamon, icing sugar, whipped cream, and strawberries; it was to die for! Extremely sweet though so if you're not looking for a sweet breakfast, go with something else. We also got French toast and cut it up and added it to the waffle supreme. Additionally, we ordered a side of home fries which were average, I've had better. To drink we got the freshly squeezed OJ which was so good. My only critique about the OJ iit's served in such tiny portions. 

Overall, I'd come back to his location and would recommend it to others."}
{"text":"Very bad customer service! We didn't get our order until after 30 mins. The server keeps texting, she keeps on ignoring the customers."}
{"text":"It sucks when they don't seat you even though there's tables available. One less star for that. The seating staff are very inconsiderate but once you get pass them it gets better from there. The service for drinks excellent. Our server was quick. The eggs Benedict with smoked salmon was very delicious. Hollandaise sause spot on. However the potato wasn't crispy enough for me. Very busy place which is a good thing."}
{"text":"Always here for the $4.99 breakfast special which comes with 3 eggs, home fries and toast. After 11am on weekdays it is $5.99. Hands down the cheapest place in the city for a hearty breakfast. Their french toast is my biggest addiction!!! It's SO good!! Service is always friendly and prompt. Food comes out in less than 5 mins."}
{"text":"We stopped in here before going to the Jay's game.  There was a bit of a line up.  We noticed that everyone's meals were huge.  So if you are really hungry, this is the place to go.  We weren't that hungry and the waitress that we had was super nice and let us split a meal which was the perfect amount of food.  We got our coffee and breakfast in a good amount of time.  the food was hot and tasted pretty good.  The only downfall about the place is the long line ups, but I guess it just proves that the food is worth waiting for.  I also noticed people getting food to go."}
{"text":"I always come here with friends, and family for last minute breakfasts/brunches. Amongst entering the restaurant everyone is always so welcoming. The surrounding areas, and tables are always clean. Regardless to what you order you won't be disappointed. The food is well worth the value, and the portions won't have you leaving empty stomached!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing, the staff on point & they have free wifi amazing  bacon the sunset grill special. Sometimes you have a little wait, you might think you'll be better off walking some place else but in the time it'll take you to go some place else. You could have had a seat to experience an amazing breakfast. It's worth it the wait!!"}
{"text":"Three words: All Day Breakfast.  Ever wake up late on a day off and crave a hearty breakfast?  This is your spot.  

I partook in their three egg breakfast with hash browns, ham, and toast.  The order arrived fast and it was exactly what I expected.  Nothing too fancy or unique, but absolutely perfect for breakfast at noon."}
{"text":"I'm here visiting from the states and of course I'm looking for great places to eat. Sunset grill was recommended to me by a good friend. I tried one of the locations a few days ago and wanted to come back. Me and my friends ended up going to a different location, located on Eglinton Avenue. The location was by far some of the worst service I've experienced in any restaurant. To start off, out server was bad. She had the worst attitude and it made us a little upset. I think it's bad when the conversation at the table is about the server the entire meal. I can't begin to explain how much I disliked the nasty attitude and energy she was giving us. It gets even worse. In the middle of our meal, one of my friends finds hair in her food. The server removed the items and after that we didn't hear from her. She didn't do anything to comfort our friend who was visibly upset. 
We had to ask for a manager, who removed the items from our bill. 
This location was so bad that I could not possibly come back. I really think they should teach severs that their attitude affects the people they are helping."}
{"text":"By far the best breakfast/brunch/lunch place!! Have been here several times (almost every weekend) for breakfast/brunch and have never been disappointed. The service is always great (minus one server who lacks professionalism), the serving sizes are very generous and the prices are very reasonable. We highly recommend this place for anyone searching for a great place and great food!"}
{"text":"Very busy location even on a Tuesday morning at 11am. Lots of tables in this little place, kind of bumped elbows with tables around us since they seemed to have set up a little table in the middle of the floor. Service was friendly but the food took a little long getting to us."}
{"text":"Favorite choice for weekend breakfasts.  Typical breakfast fare.  These folks can change over tables and have good prices for what they serve.

Their coffee is below par, but the food is great.  

I especially like the eggs florentine."}
{"text":"Worst breakfast i have ever eaten...potatoes/eggs are all cold. I'm a big breakfast lover and this restaurant has disappointed me in all regards. Would rather get McD instead..."}
{"text":"Just ordered a club sandwich with no tomatoes on it. It came with tomatoes which is normal so I sent it back with no complaints. When the sandwich came back the second time I noticed the chicken was not cooked in places. I then received a dirty look from the cook for complaining about being sent raw chicken. This place not only sucks but is also a health hazard."}
{"text":"I came here with my husband while attending a wedding in Canada. After a looong day of travel the day before, we needed a yummy breakfast while still staying healthy. Picking this spot was a home run for us.

\"All-Day Breakfast\" is EXACTLY what you want to hear when you're jet-lagged and boy does this place serve up some yummy eats. I had the Eggs Florentine with a side of fruit and was overjoyed in breakfast bliss! My husband who had very little to eat the night before was also in love with his meal. Our waitress was attentive and made sure I got my coffee, which was very much needed. 

If you're in Mississauga, give this place a try. All-Day Breakfast - you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Our favourite breakfast place in Toronto. We have been coming to Sunset Grill for years. Amazing service. They are fast, friendly, and efficient. Breakfast is always good and plentiful. Lots of choices to satisfy almost anyone. Not fancy food, but good quality. Good value for the money. Highly recommended if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Everything from pancakes to French toast to omelettes to eggs with toast.  All were delicious.  Has to be the breakfast stop if you're in town.  Prices are very reasonable and it's quick service."}
{"text":"For a lot of us getting Sunset Grill back is joyous. Of all places in Cleveland perhaps Wendy Park and the Sunset Grill most represent the wonderful diversity of our part of Ohio. Cleveland and Ohio for that matter are so diverse that outsiders disapprovingly judge us for failing to meet their limited expectations. Even many who live here do not appreciate this unique city of mills, museums and maple trees. 

At Wendy Park there are planes overhead, trains to the south, boats to the east and north, and cars and trucks along the Shoreway. A short walk takes you to the busy Cuyahoga, to the architecturally dazzling but deserted Coast Guard Station, and past trees that beavers have seriously gnawed. Sunset Grill offers a place to enjoy this distinctive setting with bar food and drink. I clearly wrote bar food. No celebrity burgers, no on site brewed beers, and no designer anything. No LA pretension or San Francisco snobbery or New York know it all is here. This is where people who toil, who make things, who have common sense come to sit along the water in the sun glad to be in Cleveland. 

This is a very laid back place. The pace is slow. No one rushes to get you out or rushes to serve you. Bring a book or a dog or friends. Enjoy conversation or watch boaters dock or the sun set or a train pass. Sunset is one more waterfront location that locals harshly  criticize  rather than appreciate. Those not enjoying Sunset and Wendy Park must be quite frustrated being in Cleveland."}
{"text":"After a long absence, my friend and I returned to the Sunset Grill at Yonge/Richmond. While I will admit that I prefer the Yonge/Eglinton location (now closed) and the Coxwell location in East York, this one is not bad and very convenient when we are downtown. The restaurant is big and bright, with mostly glass windows along both streets, and some food-themed pictures on the other walls. The service is generally okay but nothing special. Since I've never been there alone, I am not sure about music, but I think there is some playing in the background while we talk.

The menu has all the usual breakfast items, egg breakfasts, pancakes/french toast, fruit and yogurt. I usually have a combo like the French Connection, which is french toast and eggs and home fries, but my friend was hoping to add a pancake to her (possibly Greek?) omelette, so I had the Sunset Super instead. All the food was fine, 3 eggs and bacon and home fries along with the pancakes. The omelettes all come with home fries and toast. The one thing that I do not like about this particular location is that they always seem to chop their onions too large, which is why I do not order their corned beef hash as I do at the other locations. I didn't pay the bill, but breakfast is usually about $15 per person. Overall, an okay place for breakfast if we're in the area, but again nothing special to highlight."}
{"text":"This particular location of Sunset Grill was one of the first places I went for breakfast when my kitchen was being renovated back in 2009, and I have continued to come back whether alone or with a friend. The service is fine, and usually quick as I seldom go during the breakfast rush.

Yesterday I had the corned beef hash with scrambled eggs, one of their best plates. I like their version because the onions are chopped fine (this is not always so at the other locations where I have been). Everything is well cooked, and there is plenty of corned beef and home fries, along with 3 eggs and 2 slices of toast. Coffee is served in a small cup, but is constantly re-filled so always hot. Total bill was $15.

Other good options are the French Connection (French toast with eggs and home fries) or a good-sized omelette. I have never had a bad experience there or at any of the other locations. I do not recall if I have had take-out service from this location, but it's always fast at the Coxwell location. Overall, a strong recommendation; I will definitely be returning in the future."}
{"text":"I'm a local resident here Pickering,Ontario. Nice breakfast theme here colourful lights news playing in the background wood decor etc. Started the day off with avocado toast and coffee. Coffee cups are small but makes up with the dark roast ordered the corned beef hash with yogourt parfait. Food was well made, yogurt was sour but the honey and granola gave it a perfect taste. Corned beef was light not greasy looked like has hash browns. Overall a great place to eat breakfast and brunch"}
{"text":"Chicken was perfectly cooked! Nice presentation for the salad however Greek salad ..... no olives??????that is just a salad with cheese! Ask the waitress and she said owner hates olives...... I ask the owner and he waved his hand in the air and ignored me! Maybe if I ever return I will bring my Olives...... but I feel that if I am paying for Greek salad........ mind you this is a breakfast place.....maybe just don't order salad!"}
{"text":"The pancakes were delicious and IMO tasted better than GOLDEN GRIDDLE'S. It came with 5 for $6 and they were reasonably sized so it was a great value. Did I mention the service was super quick and friendly? Seems like a great place for breakast and brunches if you ask me."}
{"text":"Me and my friends came here one day because the line up outside Fran's was waaaaaaaaaaay too long one Sunday Morning.

We were seated quickly and handed the specials and the regular menu.

Their menu was pretty much standard breakfast fare. But their specials of the day looked good.

My friends ordered the special - Smoked Salmon Eggs Benedict with Spinach.

I ordered the 2 eggs sunny side up with potatoes with Coffee and Rye Toast.


My food : Was okay. Nothing special. My eggs were over done, but I was too hungover to complain. The potatoes tasted a bit raw. The toast was standard rye.

The Smoked Salmon : Disgusting. They used some really cheap smoked salmon that looks like it was reheated or fried. It tasted super fishy and smelled really bad. The spinach looked like came out of those frozen spinach box. Puke-alicious.

I'll probably never come to this location again. There's def a reason why there was a huge lineup outside Fran's @ Victoria and Shuter, and no line up here. 

Also, parking was a nightmare.

I've been to other locations (The one in Jefferson Square in Richmond HIll and one in Sauga..i don't know the location) and they were decent.

This place was dismal."}
{"text":"It is a cute diner setting. Very friendly waiter. Prices were a little more than average. Portions were decent.

We had the Three Eggs with Bacon and another with Sausages. One of us had the Sunset Sandwich. The food was quite casually prepared. Sunny side up eggs were fine. Potatoes (their \"home fries\") weren't exactly cooked through. Sausages were a bit burnt on the outside. Bacon was fine. Brown toast was fine. Sunset Sandwich was fine.

If you're just looking for a fill, this can be it! Lots of calories to get you through the day!"}
{"text":"The food here is standard breakfast food... they don't have many things that are on their menu. Was there recently and they didn't have daily soup or any soup, plus no healthy option or oatmeal. Their biggest issue is shortage of staff though. Especially on the wkds when you know youre going to be busy, it would be smart to have extra staff in. Took us a while to get water, menu, order, coffee refill, fork or anything else. 

The sausages were salty and pancakes were card boardy... i'd rather pay a little more and go to Bobby's in Streetsville or even Cora's"}
{"text":"I dont usually come here unless I'm out eith s group of friends. Needless to say, the place gets very busy. The food we order is pretty good, however st times it is very hard to wave down a server in case you need something. We kind of have to do that awkward stare at someone until they notice.

All in all, pretty good place. It loses a star though because we were waiting for about  30 minutes to be seated."}
{"text":"Like Sunset; however this location was mediocre. The home fries were basically huge boiled potatoes cut up and the quantity of the eggs and home fries were not to par of other locations. 

Had better."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast twice while in Toronto. Nothing speciala bout this, but its not bad either. It got the job done, and it was pretty affordable. I did appreciate the fact that they offered Turkey Bacon, so many breakfast spots outside of New York(with the exception of IHOP) don't offer pork alternatives. It was really close to our hotel so it was convenient, but its not the type of place that I would go out my way to go."}
{"text":"The service is awful ! Waited 20 minutes for waitress to take my order . Then another 20 min for a yogurt . Eventually , I got a dish I didn't order ..."}
{"text":"Went there after the sporting life marathon on May 8 for brunch. There was a line up, but we didn't have to wait too long to get seated. 
I ordered steak and eggs weekend special for around $15 or $18. Steak was not bad, but not as good quality as the other steak I had with this price. Both steak and eggs were cooked as I wanted. I'm not a big fan of potatoes, so I can't really tell about it.
Good customer service, the waitress was friendly, and she came several times to fill up my friends' coffee and tea."}
{"text":"This specific Sunset Grill boasts some of the most anthemic career waitresses one could ever find North of Highway 401. From the moment you walk-in and start joanzing for that first touch of coffee to your lips to the last bite of turkey sausage, the team has you covered; impeccable service. The food is simple, rustic, increadibly breakfast like and very tasty. Quick, quick, quick, and always with a friendly smile."}
{"text":"Great food for a good price. I got the bacon and eggs (three) with home fries and toast. The bacon is VERY flavorful and you get five pcs! Very fast and friendly service. Its a nice (loud) atmosphere. Will be going back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Sunset grill is a good old faithful brunch place that I've shared with many of my friends. The service is incredible- they are very attentive and consistently kind. This place isn't about an innovative menu or interesting ingredients; just the essentials of bacon, eggs etc. But what they do, they do well. The food always comes out fast and hot. The omelette portions are incredibly generous and come with a large side of home fries and toast (white, brown or rye). The prices are very reasonable considering how much you get on your plate. They have been serving their all day breakfasts since 1985 and the customers still keep coming, so they are clearly doing something right!"}
{"text":"At 9am on a weekday, it was very busy - always a good sign for a breakfast restaurant. After seating ourselves, we weren't quite sure of what to do next. None of the waiters approached us for a good 5 minutes. There was a cashier and a big menu along one of the walls, so as I got up to approach the counter to order, I was finally stopped by a waiter. She apologized for missing us, and that she would get to us with menus shortly. No real faults here, just a product of a busy morning. 

I ordered the salmon eggs sunset, which is their form of a salmon eggs benedict - typical english muffin, egg, smoked salmon, topped with hollandaise sauce. It was accompanied with home fries. The food was decent, but it was clear that the preparation took no more than a few seconds. Again, no faults here as it is a breakfast diner, but it did leaves something to be desired. 

Sunset Grill is good for what it does, and its unarguably popular among locals. If you're in the area and are looking for breakfast, then check it out. But otherwise, don't bother going out of your way to come here."}
{"text":"I go here often for brunch because the food is good and what you would expect. The menu is extensive sns the prices are very reasonable. The reason I keep returning is the service. It is friendly, fast and sincere."}
{"text":"Fed my fams here two days in a row. Excellent service. No waits. Eggs, sausage, bacon, potatoes consistent. We always left full and happy. Not a big dent in the wallet either. Breakfast special with meat was 6.99. This week was free coffee week.  Oh Ya. I was flying at the right altitude after every meal. Nice servers always kept my coffee full. Breakfast special ends at 11."}
{"text":"The gods wanted me to eat here, we literally broke down right outside the restaurant. 

Excellent breakfast sandwich pea-meal  bacon  with potatoes seasoned just right and a cucumber and carrot on the side... I thought I was just getting a breakfast sandwich! Jason the owner gave me a takeaway container that seemed too big for just a sandwich. Was I glad when I opened it and saw the potatoes too! 

Thanks for the excellent food and the energy for the rest of the day."}
{"text":"Thought this food was gonna be mediocre but you know somethin'? It wasn't. 

Don't get me wrong now; you're gonna forget you even ate there afterwords.  Nothing game changing going on at this establishment.  But you get BIG pancakes. I ordered the strawberry supreme and like, DON'T order that. It tasted good but who really needs 5 big pancakes? Get three.  And you better get some fruits and some topping cuz if you're dealing with just syrup, you're gonna taste the the no name quality batter that they use.  Also, they put the toppings on the side cuz it's just not enough too cover all 5 pancakes; that's how they trick you!

You can watch the chefs cook your food, which is a good thing.... I think.  I didn't get bacon, but if I did, I wouldn't care for seeing it wrapped in some weird towel until I ordered it...I know that's to absorb the grease but EW.  I also don't care for food service workers NOT wearing hairnets and handling my food with their bare hands... I don't care how clean people think they are; get gloves.  It's all fun and games till somebody pulls a hair outta their mouth. 

Wont be back cuz Starving Artist is right around the corner but... 4 Stars!!!"}
{"text":"I read the previous review with only 3 stars and had to comment. I have been having breakfast at least once or twice a week at Sunset Grill for about a year now and highly recommend it. It is reasonably priced, the service is excellent and they are always willing to go that extra step to make you feel at home.... oh, and of course, the food is great!"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast. Very clean place, free parking and good food. On the downside, there is usually a wait and sevice is a bit slow therefore four stars from me."}
{"text":"This particular location is my favourite Sunset Grill. The staff is extremely kind and welcoming. They take the time to get to know their customers and know many of them on a first name basis. Service is very fast, whether if you're dining in or taking out. Their quality of food is always consistent and have yet to be disappointed. I highly recommend this location!"}
{"text":"If you just need some food go there, if you want an enjoyable breakfast out do not go there.  I was surprised their sign says famous. Famous for what? Bad food and service?  We ordered the 3 eggs breakfast with juice, coffee and water.  The coffee was not refilled until the end of the meal, the water was never refilled and the juice never came.  There were 4 other tables in the restaurant, and 4 staff working with a manager.  The waitress seemed put off when I asked for marmalade.  Will not return even though it was cheap.  The bacon was salty, the toast was not really toasted, the eggs were a little runny, the hash browns were under cooked...."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since they opened and almost always get the French toast w/ cinnamon and icing sugar, comes 2 or 3 slices. They also have great sandwiches and other brunch related delectables! On the weekend mornings is gets SUPER busy and on rare occasions gotta wait up 30mins. As for the prices, they can seem steep on some things but your paying for quality here so don't be afraid to tell them about your food not being up to par. Oh and their coffee is phenomenal!!"}
{"text":"Fast, friendly service and fantastic food.  Mike (the owner) sat down with us ans made sure everything was to our liking and truly cared about our dining experience. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Two stars solely based on the sincere and prompt service but otherwise the food was not pleasant to eat. 
Over processed sausage, stale pancakes, soggy/chewy home fries, and somewhat decent eggs left me nauseated."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service.  Waitress came by a few times to top off the coffee and see how we were doing. 

The breakfast came pretty fast considering how busy it was.  I had the corn beef hash and eggs.  It was perfect.  A very hearty meal.  

We have been to the one near home in Pickering and this location is much, much better."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service.   Breakfast was hot and delicious.  Very good decaf coffee.  I had blueberry pancakes this time with a side order of bacon.  They might want to consider a menu offering with only two pancakes.  It comes with three.  I find this too much to eat."}
{"text":"We waited an hour before the waitress came to us and asked what we ordered because they lost it. They hadn't even started making it. Not all the locations are this bad. Walked out and went to Cora's.  Probably saved us time."}
{"text":"This place has really grown on me. It has great breakfast food and the friendliest waitresses."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday morning for breakfast.  Restaurant is very clean and inviting.  Staff very friendly and attentive.  Food was amazing and portions are generous.  The selection on the menu is enormous.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"We came on Boxing Day to the location at Weston road and Highway 7 just after 10. The four of us ordered the standard breakfast far: Eggs potatoes and a choice of meat for about $9.00 each or a bit more if Turkey options are preferred. Coffee refills are complementary, and the price of a coffee is $3.00 each, so you are looking at about $12.00 or so for a relatively hearty breakfast as noted above, with a side of toast and jam. 

The service is quick and efficient, with the place filling up quickly on a holiday, the staff are quite adept at turning over the tables. They asked at least one if we like a refill, however at the end as it got more busy our plates were not removed.

The food: as it may be common with a quasi greasy spoon, the food was a bit on the oily side, the potatoes a bit undersigned and not seasoned, and you leave generally with a bit of tummie troubles. 

A bit pricey for the coffee, , a bit on the mediocre side and undercooked, and a bit on the greasy side overall for $60.00 breakfast for 4 people still an ok option for a full up on a cold day"}
{"text":"A solid choice for breakfast in Oakville.  The service is excellent, the food is good and the combinations a good value.  The coffee is good and they serve both coffee cream and 2% milk.  We had the French connection (3eggs, two pieces of French Toast and home fries) and the Eggs Sunset (an eggs benedict with three eggs, peameal bacon on an English muffin with hollandaise sauce).  The portions are nicely sized and the food very good.  The hollandaise was particularly good for a breakfast spot.  The French Toast was nice and thick and well prepared.

If I lived in Oakville, this would be a go to spot.  Why not a five star?  Like most production kitchens (there was a short wait when we came and a line when we left), special requests are very hard to fulfill.  \"Softly scrambled\" eggs came out the usual way and well done home fries were not well at all.  I did not complain and the food was still very good.  

All in all, highly recommended."}
{"text":"These guys are experts at speedy greasy breakfasts!
Yesterday morning, my husband suggested a trip to the local diner for a cheap egg breakfast. I countered with this place because I walk by all the time and figured it would deliver the desired effect in a nicer atmosphere.
A little pricier than the diner, Sunset Grill still gave us the goods. I ordered the three eggs and bacon, served with toast and home fries, and could not eat it all - 6 slices of bacon is more than I need! My husband went even bigger and got the eggs, bacon, pancakes and sausage and he had the same problem finishing it. In fact, we could have split his plate and been fine.
Coffee was good and refilled, and fresh squeezed orange juice tasted very fresh.
The decor is simple and plain, tables and chairs are basic, nothing fancy. The food is nothing fancy either, but it is good and so is the service. A good alternative to the greasy diner."}
{"text":"Very fast and friendly service, good food, very clean and well laid out (the washroom was spotless). This location even has a nice little patio out front.

One of the better Sunset Grill locations I've been to."}
{"text":"Love breakfast here. Long term favourite of mine is Corned Beef hash with 3 eggs, however everything else I've tried was always great too. We have been to many locations, usually the Yonge and Gamble, but there isn't any significant difference. This place gets super busy around 11am-12pm on weekends"}
{"text":"Consistent breakfasts. Rarely have I had any egg dish here that was not cooked the way I ordered it. Substitutions usually have a premium added, for example, subbing fruit for home fried potatoes adds a couple bucks. A breakfast with coffee often runs about $12. 

On the weekends especially, the place fills up and you can be caught in a lineup if you don't get there early."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfasts. I love an all-day breakfast from time to time, but certainly, in the mornings, I really love my bacon and eggs with toast and hot sauce. SG has consistantly hit the nail on the head and quality is always paramount."}
{"text":"Yummy food! The server was really nice but she was really busy and distracted it took forever to flag her down for a coffee refill!"}
{"text":"Divey awesomeness!!!!
Happy hour with knuckledraggers I work with on a sunny Summer evening and the world was whole and good!!!
Finger foods were fine and Summer Shandy on tap was perfect!!!!
The clientele seemed to be like our party as well, out from work having an enjoyable happy hour and just kicking back.
I bet that changes as the night wears on but who cares? If you are a social observer like me it should make for GREAT observations into the human condition!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm a very picky eater. But the breakfast was yum. The waffles r delicious. They serve the most delicious turkey bacon I've had. The staff r super friendly plus the service was fast. By far the best sunset grill I've had my breakfast at."}
{"text":"It's summer folks!  Grab your sunglasses and flip flops and head down to Whiskey Island!  Whether you're there for the volleyball league during the week nights, or there on the weekend to enjoy the sun and gorgeous North Coast View, this place is a must visit  to grab some libations.  They have a full bar, and buckets of beers at a rather reasonable price.  Best part - they allow you to bring your own snacks to enjoy at the picnic tables, as long as you're buying alcohol.  That's a change from last year!  

The restaurant has the indoor space with a bar, plus the outdoor patio with 15+ large picnic tables with table service.  The patio is right on the marina and is a beautiful view. You can kick back and look at the water while incredibly kind servers bring you PBR tall boy after PRB tall boy (my preferred beer of the moment).  On a nice day, the picnic tables will fill up - so get there early to grab one! 

The food options are ... sparse.  It's not as diverse as when they had the Cropicana experiment last summer, but it's traditional bar food - burgers, chicken, fries, etc. Not great, but not bad.   

Best part, the music!  They have live music every weekend, and it's a lovely way to enjoy the Cleveland Sunset."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best service restaurants I've ever been too!  Staff is always on point, very friendly and the food always comes out quickly and well prepared!  Good food for a great price and the service is second to none....I've heard some bad things about other sunset grills but this is by far the gold standard so keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Now goes by: Eggs Sunrise Grill (that's what all the signage and menus said).

Overall, for a small spot, place was the bomb! So much food for super cheap! My friend and I split the French Delight. 

$9.75 spent on 3 eggs, 2 pieces of french toast, 2 sausage, 2 bacon strips, and home fries! Soo worth! 

Definitely check it out if you're in the area. Not too crowd and was immediately seated for a group of 6 and we went around 11:30 AM on a Saturday morning."}
{"text":"So, me and the BF went to Sunset Grill this weekend. As my BF is a former server at restaurants he gets very ticked with poor customer service.

We had an older waitress with blonde hair and who took our orders and seemed quite cold. Didn't have a very friendly demeanor at all. I ordered the Super Breakfast (2 pancakes, 3 scrambled eggs, homefries and bacon) with a coffee.  My BF ordered something similar but he had no pancakes, sausage instead of bacon and toast instead with a hot chocolate. Our food came out in a timely manner which was great but we were given no utensils. 

As we kept a watchful eye for our server we were hoping that's where she ran off to but instead she got distracted doing something else. I even tried to look for cutlery to swipe so I can start eating but there wasn't any put on the tables. It's clearly given when the food is delivered. My BF was getting agitated b/c no one likes to eat cold scrambled eggs so I decided to get up and just ask a random waitress for cutlery to which she replied \"Oh! You weren't given utensils for your meal?\" and then came by and dropped some off for us. I saw her mention it to our waitress and shortly after that the waitress who had no emotion poured me a fresh cup of coffee and asked how our meal was. She seemed pleasant then.

Our total came up to $25.  Not bad for two breakfasts. The food was good but it wasn't remarkable. The coffee was delicious. The restaurant itself was clean and I liked the decor."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch and ordered a fresh orange juice and the sunset super (3 eggs, pancakes, home fries and a choice of sausage, bacon or ham) I don't eat pork so I asked to substitute that with a piece of toast but was told that it could ONLY be substituted for tomato slices. Pretty sure a piece of toast costs less than the meat but anyhow was disappointed at the lack of accommodation for my religious dietary restrictions. Other than thay our server was actually very pleasant and the service was really quick. The food was decent- the pancakes were really fluffy and delicious and you can't really mess up scrambled eggs. The potatoes however were not that great. They were not uniformly cooked- some pieces were just straight up boiled and some were like fried or sauteed but tasted like they had been sitting there for awhile. They were also too salty. I don't like eating extra carbs unless its for a good reason so I had some time to separate the potatoes into two piles while my friends finished their teas but they also didn't eat their potatoes. I was also doubtful about the orange juice being fresh squeezed but can't say for sure. I wouldn't be opposed to coming back because the service was really good but wouldn't go out of my way to come back because there are a lot of other good brunch options in Oakville."}
{"text":"I was totally unimpressed by the food the few times I went. 
I recall the location in the Beaches being much better.
In BWV I'd much rather go to Bloor Jane diner."}
{"text":"You don't come here for the service I learned that really quick

I came on Saturday at 11 it's a seat yourself environment so that in itself was very chaotic there was not much organization and I waited a really long time before I even got a menu or anyone acknowledged me but I will say once my food was ordered it came within 5 to 10 minutes so they made up in that area

I ordered the three eggs with peameal bacon which came with home fries and two toast I loved the home fries they were so good but overall everything was good and Made to Perfection my over easy eggs were done exactly how they should be and the bacon was very tasty it wasn't burnt and it wasn't under cook I would definitely go back but with lower expectation in regards to service"}
{"text":"When we first got in the waitress came up and got our drink order, she brought us our drinks and said she would give us a bit with the menu. She never came back, after sitting for half an hour no one came to help us. It seemed like a steady pace for a Sunday morning but there was more than enough staff to help the number if guests. After realizing the family that had came in before us was already 3/4 done their meal we decided to just get up and leave."}
{"text":"Our office orders here at least 3 times a week. And they are always fast and great!!"}
{"text":"Great for breakfast or lunch! Prices are very reasonable and service has always been good! You can't beat traditional breakfast meals, no matter what time of day!"}
{"text":"Went to Friday brunch. 
We sit small patio. Food was okay. 
But the sever really didnt care us ;("}
{"text":"First time there, good for breakfast, but we were there for lunch, so it was ok. I got the classuc burger which had little meat... i will try their breakfast plates next time, very affordable prices, fast and friendly service."}
{"text":"This sunset grill location is extremely disappointing. I wouldn't return to this location, I'll continue to frequent the locations on Erin Mills and Dixie instead. 
Usually most sunset grills are consistent in quality, that was not the case here. I got over cooked eggs and barely toasted toast. The home fries just tasted of boiled salted potatoes (other locations add some seasoning and a little fry to them for flavour). In my entire time there I never received a coffee refill, I had asked for water when I ordered and it arrived to my table as the server was clearing my plate. I had asked for jam since there was none at my table, I was given honey. When I said I'd really like some jam please, the server sighed and handed me marmalade, I ended up just getting jam myself from the empty table next me. 
This poor lady with her young child was seated next to me and she had been waiting for her plates to be cleared midway through my meal. When she began chatting to me that she found the service to be bad and that she had been waiting for 20 minutes, the server came and wedged herself between us and began to tell me that they were slammed and under staffed (that's fine but I didn't need an apology, the lady with her child did. Also why are you telling me this at the end of my meal?). 
I have had pleasant experiences at sunset grills before but I'll return to those locations, not this one"}
{"text":"Our go-to breakfast place. We've tried other locations but it's not the same as this one and the one on Trafalgar (same owners). Eggs sunset are killer, omelettes, french toast. All great."}
{"text":"Our go-to breakfast place. We've tried other locations but it's not the same as this one and the one on Cornwall (same owners). Eggs sunset are killer, omelettes, french toast. All great."}
{"text":"If you told me that this place was a chain, I would of not believed you, After a night go drinking and a hangover, my girlfriend and I were looking for a spot to refuel. We did a quick search and found this place. We were seated quickly. We had water and coffee brought to us quickly. Our waitress was super friendly, The tables were pretty small, and I was worried that it may not fit all of your food, lol. 

For food, I ordered the super sunset breakfast: three eggs over-easy, two pancakes, home fries, bacon, and that. It was amazing! I started with the home fries.They were crispy and small which made them the perfect bite size. The pancakes were fluffy and perfectly soaked up the syrup. With every bite, I felt myself sobering up. The eggs were great, especially when soaking the toast in the yolk.

My girlfriend ordered the greek omelet. She didn't expect the omelet to be so hearty. There were a lot of veggies, and a lot of feta cheese. There was the equivalent of an infant's fist worth of feta cheese for a base. It definitely tasted great with some hot sauce. 

Would definitely come back here!"}
{"text":"It's the original Sunset Grill location, and it lives up to that, as it is your traditional diner, which hasn't changed one iota since opening. It's quaint and fun, and hard not to love for that reason. Even though the breakfast isn't the best in town, it's exactly what you expect for a little greasy spoon. The value for dollar also isn't bad (with typical early bird specials being a real deal, and the \"Lumberjack\" being the best value for dollar of the standard breakfast fare, in my opinion). The staff has always been pleasant. They now take debit in addition to cash. Biggest gripe I have with all Sunset Grill locations: the style of their home fries (large chunks of potato that often have a mushy undercooked texture, but that's a personal preference thing).

If you're going to go to one breakfast/brunch spot in the Beach area, try this one, it's the authentic experience."}
{"text":"Sunset grill is a solid little breakfast joint.  The food is good - well executed but not overly fancy.  Everything is fairly efficient and things move quite quickly with the servers ordering your meals on tablets and everything being very automated. 

My fav item is chocolate chip pancakes and I often upgrade to that from the sunset supper.   yummy :)

Pricing is not the cheapest but it's all pretty reasonable."}
{"text":"You know, there's something pretty GREAT about a basic, fresh, friendly deli! There's nothing AMAZING about it, food wise, but everyone is always SUPER friendly and nice. The food is your basic deli type of items, none of it is horrible at all. It's all good. However, just normal, basic sandwiches, burgers and stuff. 
Again, it's all about the service here. GREAT people. GREAT smiles. It's always a pleasure coming here."}
{"text":"When you are in need of a breakfast right away that will soak up the alcohol, then check out this chain restaurant.  It does the job well for cheap when need be.  I wouldn't come here all the time a a brunch fave...but once in a blue moon it's ok.

the service at this particular spot was super friendly - our server (whose name I've forgotten) was so pleasant and friendly that even when she forgot my home fries I was ok with it :)

I ordered a bunch of sides (not a big egg fan) - I got 4 slices of turkey bacon, the fruit salad and the side order of home fries - which is more like a main order of home fries because it was a HUGE ORDER!  

It's clean, the food comes pretty quickly which is a good thing when you got the morning hunger pains."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday for breakfast .
Was surprised it wasn't rammed and we were seated right away . 
Was pleasantly surprised at the service and quality of food . I had the salmon Benedict it was great .
I would definitely come back !"}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot great prices a d decent services . I love the salmon sunset it's definitely my fave to order ! Nothing like freah coffee and OJ in the morning !"}
{"text":"Great location , waitress' are very friendly and helpful . Food quality is very good and fresh .
Location is clean and easy access to the 410 .
Weekday mornings are peaceful but weekends can get busy !"}
{"text":"2.5 stars. (Food: 2, Whole experience: 3)
Standard breakfast food, pretty big portions, convenient location: right next to canoe club.

It was a pretty packed Saturday afternoon, and we were a big group, but they seated us as quickly as they could and still had big smiles on their faces.

I got the sunset sandwich which came with home fries and a piece of carrot and cucumber-- not too exciting. The sandwich itself was very greasy in the middle, but had very dry bread, and tasted very bland overall. However, the home fries were really good. Everyone else at the table seemed to really enjoy their pancakes, waffles, and omelettes.

The service was great. They were super friendly and came over to check on us pretty frequently. Most restaurants usually pre-charge large groups a certain % for tips but this place didn't. Will be back if I ever find myself in that area again!"}
{"text":"The food is ok, love the roasted potatoes.
The BLT sandwich is standard but with its cheap price it's a good deal!"}
{"text":"I cam to the Sunset Grill on a Wednesday morning - 9am, during the Christmas break and although the place was pretty empty when we first walked in, it filled up FAST - families, elderly, friends, all different groups.
There were probably 2 people working on the floor, and man in the open concept kitchen, but he was pretty efficient, at least our table was!

The meals were large - pancakes can be ordered in 5 (super size me!) and a smaller portion of 3. I don't think the orange juice was fresh, so that was a downer.

I ordered the yogurt with strawberry puree, granola, and strawberries and honey. The portion was huge and everything was delicious. The prices are great, compared to a premium breakfast joint like Cora's so I think this can be a regular... if only I lived in the area.

3.5+ super cheap, good food"}
{"text":"We were excited when this place opened because it's so close to our home.  All was good when it opened but in our last visit we were disappointed. First the whole place was smokey and wreaked of bacon.  This wouldn't bother some people but it bothered folks in our party.  And second the potatoes they served with everything was soggy and not crispy. Tip to management: get a more powerful exhaust hood and more attention to the food please."}
{"text":"Yum!  Egg dishes to die for. Clean bright airy. Friendly service. First time certainly not last time. Really hit the spot"}
{"text":"Well today I didn't even get to eat. It's not that they were seriously busy. I was about to be seated at table right in front of the register. I asked nicely if I could sit at another table. ( my mother has Dementia so wanted less traffic area.) The white lady is like. Honey look around and waves her hand with an attitude. There's not many places left. But yes i saw at least 6 tables! So I sat there. She then goes back to the register and I see her and an Asian man lol and smirking. I left and got up. Bad vibes! Go to Flips around the corner. Great food, huge plates and better prices!! Amazing service at Flips thank you Brittany!"}
{"text":"we just went there this morning and the place is great hopefully it will stay open longer than the one did at Yonge & Wellesley
nice and bright big with high ceilings
it is nice to have another choice
friendly wait staff"}
{"text":"This is a must visit if you are new to the beaches and want a big, greasy, delicious breakfast. It's the original sunset grill that is popping up all over Toronto now. The prices are pretty decent and the meals are huge. Their omelette uses 5 eggs! The line ups out the door every weekend prove that this is the place to eat."}
{"text":"Our first time here ... located around the corner from Nandos ... Chantel was a great server ..  checked on us a few times ... was pleasant. Got a Diner feel even inside a shopping complex. The food was hot, fresh and tasty. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Only really three options for grub in this area and I tried all three this week.... service and timeliness of the food prep is outstanding. Got the blackened chipotle wrap, previous review was spot on, too much dressing and lettuce and no trace of blackening mostly just seasoning. Also side pasta salad was very unsatisfying how ever the menu is extensive enough I m sure I will find something I will like  and other's plates looked promising."}
{"text":"This doesn't taste like breakfast made in someone's kitchen.  It tastes like restaurant food.  I know, I know that seems like a picky distinction but some of the best breakfast joints taste like family dinners.

Still...this place has lots to recommend it.  The food is tasty.  The service was ALL I could ever dream of.  Beverage refills fast and aplenty.  Smiles. (5 stars for our server!)  Affordable prices. Breakfast ALL day!! The portion fed me for 3 meals.

My menu offering was delicious.  The french toast not overly eggy but substantial and golden. The poached eggs perfectly soft.   One of the diner's found there was an odd mustard taste to his hollandaise on the crab benny.  The other diner who had eggs florentine, found no mustard taste but the flavour of the sauce was a little flat.

I would return to this homey establishment with natural light, great service and solid breakfast offerings."}
{"text":"We came on a Sunday for brunch, and the place was packed! But within 15 minutes we were seated. I ordered the corn beef hash breakfast with over easy eggs. Quite good, portions size were good, and prices are comparable to Cora's or Eggsmart."}
{"text":"Straightforward, non-nonsense, always busy Sunset Grill is perfect for an all day breakfast meal.  

Recommended meal:  Eggs with your choice of white or wheat toast, choice of peameal, regular bacon or sausage, on a plate filled with homefries (chopped up potato grilled) is the way to go.  Fresh-squeezed orange juice is available, too.

You may see a line-up (expect it) but the line goes quickly, so stick around.  :)"}
{"text":"The place is very dated and needs an upgrade asap. The staff are cowgirls. Be aware if you complian about sonething, You will get lectured. See pic, This is what $14 gets u! Never again."}
{"text":"Sunset grill is alright, breakfast is probably my favorite meal of the day so my expectations are usually abit high for breakfast spots. Sunset grill is as tasteless as you can get. But their servers are good. I've come here a few times giving them the benefit of the doubt but the food hasn't been good any of the times."}
{"text":"Food is pretty generic. I've gone a few times just because it's close to work but each thing I got had no flavor or anything special. Jr club sandwich, Cesar salad and this last time the blackened chicken. With the blackened chicken all I could taste was cumin and tomato ( the menu doesn't even say it comes with a tomato and I didn't ask for any) and the prices are pretty high for what the food is. I doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"Great service. Nice breakfast. Fresh orange juice and good coffee. Fast service and not that long of a wait to get served."}
{"text":"I would put no star if I could. Terrible and slow service. Waited to be served and didn't even get a glass of water. There were more people standing around and cleaning tables than serving customers. Awful experience and will never come back again."}
{"text":"All I wanted was fluffy pancakes. The pancakes were cold and hard. The sunset omelette was warm and looked like it could've been spectacular if you to been prepared properly. The potatoes were cold and not very crisp. The coffee was bad. The service was slow. Pretty much the worst meal I've had dining out in Toronto."}
{"text":"Good reliable breakfast place.  I know they are open later and offering non breakfast items but I haven't tried. Why is this place not called sunrise grill?"}
{"text":"If you want a simple, clean breakfast this is where to go. Whenever I want a simple breakfast I head over to this Sunset Grill. 

My Go to order is 2 eggs, home fries and well done Turkey Bacon. It's actually pretty healthy too (minus the potatoes). 

The eggs are fluffy, Turkey Bacon is cooked to perfection and I am feeling good. It's also a great price. 

Keep Eating,

{"text":"I have been here on several occasions with friends and it is a good place for brunch. Service is quick and the food is freshly made. They have very good portion sizes and their prices are perfect. 
It is exactly what we want out of brunch, and they deliver."}
{"text":"I quite enjoy the breakfasts here. Actually, I find the food here to be much, much better than Boom nearby on Eglinton (except Boom does make a good smoothie).

Overall, the portions at Sunset are generous and you won't leave hungry.

If you like corned beef hash, order it! I like mine with over-easy eggs on top, rye toast, and fries instead of home fries. Now THAT is a damn good breakfast."}
{"text":"Are you looking for a place to get a super fast breakfast while also having it taste good? Why not try the Sunset Grill, where you'll probably be in and out in less then 30 minutes!

That sounded like an advertisement, so let's try this again. I brought some of my friends from Connecticut here on Saturday morning while in search of a  fast and filling breakfast. I can tell one of my friends was skeptical due to thinking all chains are terrible (he's yet to learn that Canadian chains are much different then American ones) but this place was able to prove him wrong. We came in around 9AM and it was super busy but we were able to get seated immediately. The waitress we had was super friendly, super helpful, and had a fantastic sense of humour. I decided to order some chocolate chip pancakes since I'm a child and need chocolate chips in as many things as possible. From the minute we ordered to the time we walked out the door, it could not of been more then 20 minutes! This place was lightening fast and had all 4 breakfast's in front of us in no time. My chocolate chip pancakes were very, very good and it was exactly what I was hoping for. You can't ask for much more then  good service, good prices, and good food. I definitely recommend  the Sunset Grill to anyone looking for some early morning grub!"}
{"text":"Basic greasy-spoon breakfast dinner. Good service and cheap. No frills but the staff is friendly and the place is clean."}
{"text":"Breakfast was pretty basic. Food reheated rather than cooked fresh. potatoes were almost cold. Overpriced for what it was. Pretty much the worst breakfast I had in Toronto."}
{"text":"Sunset Grill knows what they're doing.  It really is that simple.  Fast, friendly service.  I was in for breakfast on Pancake Tuesday, so I think they were doing even more brisk business than normal selling $1 pancakes for the Canadian Cancer Society.

We got seated quickly, and had an attentive, but not pushy server who wanted to know what we wanted and to get it out to us quickly.  Lots of visits to check on coffee refills, too.  You really can't ask for much more.  They have a pretty extensive menu of options, and pretty reasonable prices.  Great way to cap off this trip to Toronto."}
{"text":"A huge portion. Had a giant burger, which might have been one of the tastiest burgers I've had recently. Juicy and bacony yum. Service was friendly and quick. The homefries was okay - a bit too soggy for my likings, but still pretty good. Did I mention the delicious burger?

My mother got a salad, which turned out to be a giant salad. all delicious."}
{"text":"Love love love this place. Amazing customer service. Everything is so fresh. Favorite place to come for breakfast. Oh and the coffee and pancakes are sooooo good!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever!!  The server was like a drill sergeant taking our order, never refilled our waters, told us it was just impossible to have our homefries cooked more well done.  Then when we went to pay the guy running credit cards was very rude, especially when we asked how to skip the tip portion on the cc machine since we were leaving cash.  He barked at my friend and said just don't put anything, well newsflash buddy the device doesn't let you just \"not put anything\" you had to pick $ or %, we needed instruction on how to skip that part!! Complete pompous douchebag!  Food was mediocre at best, my friend had the steak & eggs the steak looked old and it was very fatty/over cooked.  I had scrambled eggs/toast/homefries...no flavor!  Save your money and the aggregation -GO ELSEWHERE!!!"}
{"text":"I give these guys a 3.5. They are seemingly the only decent place in the area to grab some breakfast-style food. The prices range from $8-11 for most meals including the Bennies, Omelettes and Steak and eggs. 

Although I have yet to have the pancakes and bennies here, I'd have to vouch for the omelettes being the safest bet to get your money's worth. They serve up a hot heaping omelette alongside some relatively tasty stovetop grilled homefries (a healthier alternative to the deep-fried counterparts in most greasy spoon joints).

I had the Steak here once...never again. It was almost jerky level dry, but hey, can't expect Ruth's Chris for 12 bucks I guess.

In all I much prefer this place to the Golden Griddle on Eglinton (and in general). It's not gourmet eating, but you get your money's worth and it fits the bill for a hangover fix."}
{"text":"After several years this is still my number one place to grab brunch around Yonge and Eglinton. Their lunch specials are so reasonable, large and most importantly tasty. I come here almost religiously every Tuesday and Thursday for the omelet special."}
{"text":"I'd seen the sign and never thought much of it, but after crashing at a friends place one night a group of us all headed to Sunset for breakfast the next day and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised.

The service was quick and friendly, and the place was fairly busy which is typically a good sign. I ordered a big breakfast (I can't remember the name of it) but for $9 I got three eggs any style, toast, hash browns, bacon and sausage. Juice was separate, but a good serving (not the kids size juice you sometimes get at breakfast places). Everything was cooked to perfection and we were in and out of the restaurant in under an hour. 

I'd go back again. In fact, I kept reminiscing about it for a few weeks after because it was  that good. 

Worth the trip, and there's more than one location. Check it out"}
{"text":"Service was kinda rude 
Came in and the person just threw our menu on the table.

When the waitress came by, I was curious about the French toast because usually when I go to other places for breakfast, it comes with stuff like cinnamon or peanut butter. So when I asked, the waitress was acting like I was an idiot and all she said was \"French toast....\"

Food came pretty fast though"}
{"text":"this was the best experience I have experienced in all of the sunset grills that I have gone to for breakfast. The staff and the owner are very professional efficient and great customer service.. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to appreciate a good breakfast.

{"text":"Do you love bacon? I love bacon. Say it together now, bacon bacon bacon. This place is all about bacon. Ok, I'm being unfair. They have more than bacon but that is all my bacon eyes see. 

Pancakes are thick & yummy.  Bacon is crisp. Waffles are tasty and bacon is crisp. Eggs are always cooked for perfection.  If you aren't a baconater they do have sausage links. You don't have to get bacon but isn't that a crime?  The home fries are made so perfectly. I don't even know words to give them justice. They're tender (cooked perfectly) and seasoned right. 

The BLT is awesome too. I stopped in for lunch for more bacon. 

The service is always prompt and friendly. I will be back for more bacon next time I am in town."}
{"text":"Run of the mill breakfast place. Clientele snobbish with bratty children that should be eating in barn instead of at a table.

Been here few times for breakfast. Disappointed by the lack of a deep fryer. how dare they offer a burger with no fries.

Order a waffle way over cooked more like a taco shell.

Waitresses seem lost"}
{"text":"By far, one of the best brunch place in the NW Calgary area! It's comfortable, clean and spacious overall. The eggs Florentine was delicious. The food overall, is quite cheap with the large portions. The hot chocolate is quite tasty, although taste like cheap powdered version. The potatoes are delicious with the right amount of seasoning. The spinach and hollandaise sauce on my eggs are generous in portions! Overall, a great brunch place to meet friends and have a relaxing chat on a week day. Will be back again for more!

Been back a few times since then, always have food then I can finish. Everything I tried so far are all great!! Really decent price!!"}
{"text":"Nice place for lunch. Nice menu variety is present and the prices aren't too bad. I would call ahead and order first."}
{"text":"I'm just surprised by other people rating this place. Having been to other breakfast place. This place wasn't that impressive. We went in with my 3 year old stroller. They act as no one have ever gone inside with one.
Food wise it was ok. I had their big breakfast in which it includes 3 bacon, 3 small eggs, potatoes and 2 pancakes. Coffee was extra. The bacons was good. Eggs were pretty small and the potatoes were unevenly grill. Pancakes were big but taste battery."}
{"text":"This was our second visit to Sunset Grill, and we won't be back. The first time was meh, but it was a busy day, so we thought we would give it a second chance. The food is nothing special. Bacon is over salty, poor quality and over cooked.

We asked if they could make a grilled cheese in a clean pan (not on the grill where they make the eggs) due to a severe egg allergy. As long as it was a clean pan, we'd be fine.

The manager (via the waitress) REFUSED. They said they would only make it on the main grill where they make the eggs, they would not make it in a clean frying pan. We could *SEE* the row of clean frying pans sitting there, but they refused. Most places will be happy to make my son a grilled cheese in an egg free pan, we were surprised that they refused. 

It was not even a \"We are sorry, we cannot guarantee it will be egg free.\" That would have been ok. But they said \"No, it HAS to be made on the main grill with the eggs. We will not use a clean frying pan.\" We found that really rude."}
{"text":"Tasty Breakfast!
I had the Favorite Eggs Sunset!  My BF had 2 eggs, bacon, potatoes an toast!
I preferred Cora's because of the large portions of fruit!
Still quite tasty!!
The RYE toast is Delicious!"}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out on a whim while out and about with my girlfriend and our 18 month old. Great atmosphere, the service staff are amazing (my coffee was never empty) and the food was amazing! Portion sizes are huge, especially for the price tag, so bring an appetite. Expect a bit of a wait for food when they're swamped because they don't premake anything. It's all fresh to order. I highly recommend checking these guys out and I look forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"Sunset is our go-to Saturday brunch location. Be aware of the long line up sometimes -- its worth the few minute wait. The food is always good and the staf are really excellent. The few issues we had, the owner personally handled it. And, the next time we were in, apologied personally, remembering the issue. That said, you shouldn't have any issues here. My fav is the Sunset Yogurt with berries and honey...with a side of bacon. My wife enjoys the omlettes -- they are large and packed with veggies."}
{"text":"Sunset Grill is a solid spot for an average breakfast. Coffee is weak, French toast is mostly bread, eggs and bacon are standard.

If you eat here on the weekends, there is usually a wait. This goes fairly quickly, but there will be a squabble (count on it) amongst those waiting as to who was \"here first\", etc. I have never been a victim or a perpetrator of the etiquette train wreck here, but have always observed it. The waiting area at the door is limited and spills out on to the sidewalk.

If you make it to a table, space is tight. Service here is ok, not great. They make up for service lapses with friendliness, which is more than many places can say.

The really nice thing (and why I return) is that you can have a table service breakfast here with fairly quick service and generally decent prices. The food is (if nothing else) consistent. I know what I will get every time I come.

3 and 1/2 stars"}
{"text":"Went there today on Mother's Day with my family. We thought we would try this new place, we were planning to go to Cora's. 

The food was ok. And I was not impressed with the service. The server did not ask us if we wanted anything more and just got us our bill. It seemed like they were in a hurry to get us out.

You can give this place miss."}
{"text":"The experience I've had here is usually fantastic but today was completely subpar.
They served my food without utensils then when the guy proceeded to give me my fork and knife he almost POKED my eye out! 
Toast should come with butter on the side because everyone has different nutritional needs. Not everyone wants butter and some want more than the amount they provide. Sometimes you want Jam instead of Butter.

Anyways just disappointed as I've been there before in the past and I've never had this happen before."}
{"text":"Taste 2/5  
Food was blend for a breakfast. Didn't have much taste to any.
Very crowded place.
Servers were nice though."}
{"text":"Exactly what you'd expect from an all day breakfast joint. Service was good...food was good.

It's a franchise so it does lack that charm of an independent or family run business but I'll go back for sure."}
{"text":"Came for Mother's Day breakfast. The place was packed!  All things considered the staff did a great job. The cooks did overlook most things today however I come here all the time and it is always spot on. Great service. Good good. Extremely family friendly. Huge portions for a great price. You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Good food with ample portions. Old fashioned greasy spoon breakfast - nothing fancy and not for the pretentious crowd."}
{"text":"just ate here today and i must say it was one of the worst dining experiences I had. 
I had brought my mc donalds coffee not knowing I was not allowed to, there was no sign posted anywhere that no drinks were allowed. my server told me that the manger told me to throw it out and i literally just bought it. I asked if i can just put it in a mug and he said no. i thought maybe he can give me a coffee on the house because of the whole situation but no all the workers and the manager was just starring at me and my boyfriend during the whole time we ate which was so uncomfortable. my server brought our waters late, forgot my boyfriends whipping cream that was an extra $2 and forgot to get my toast until the end of my meal... lol wth?"}
{"text":"Great early morning breakfast joint!! If you're an early morning riser like me you will be happy to know they open at 7am so you can grab breakfast before heading to work.  This is a pretty standard \"all-american\" breakfast place, but what they have they do well.  I ordered the 3 eggs any style with ham, it came with two thick slices of toast and potatoes on the side for $6.50!  The food came out quick and hot and you could see the cook in the kitchen preparing it which I always like.  The service was great, our waitress took our orders quickly and frequently came around to fill coffee cups. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a breakfast place in the Beaches, great food and relaxed atmosphere and you can't beat a breakfast under $7 !!"}
{"text":"We always pass this one so decided to stop in for brunch. I've been to other Sunset Grill locations and thought they were fine. THIS one was super! The decor is clean the staff are all friendly. Tables tidy, place looked after. No mess left. The staff are also professional. We had freshly squeezed orange juice (yum!) and both had the special: steak with 3 poached eggs w hollandaise sauce. Of course they asked how we'd like our steaks done but then they even ask us how we'd like our eggs poached (soft, reg or hard). I think I've been asked that maybe one other time in my entire life! Also, they ask how you'd like your bacon done as well. Impressive!  Satisfying, great service, fresh, flavourful food and the prices were okay. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is one of my top hang out restaurants in my neighbourhood. It's serves breakfast all day, the staff is quick and friendly, there's a wide variety and the food (although not the cheapest of breakfast hash) is really great. 

I especially like that they offer freshly squeezed juices of the day and you can choose from either a meal (the light breakfast for me) or you can pick from their individual items list if you're more picky (which I am). I often find myself starving at 2:30 in the afternoon, with no groceries in the house, so I go down there to get just one egg with toast and a tea. Costs me like $3 and it's a nice little snack to get me happy until supper (when the fact that I have no groceries in the house becomes a problem yet again). 

Oh, and for some reason I L-O-V-E the sausages here. So greasy, so good."}
{"text":"Love this location. Go for lunch sometimes during the work week. The food is good, fair pricing and the service is amazing. I love Jennifer! It's like she can read my mind and always knows what I want or need before I ask. She's friendly, super accommodating and just overall great at her job."}
{"text":"This is an okay breakfast place but it is local so I visit regularly.  The problem is that their tea and coffee suck so everyone goes next door to Starbucks gets their coffee and eats breakfast at Sunset.  Recently Sunset decided to ban this practice so you can no longer bring anything from outside.  When their tea doesn't come semi warm in a little tin pot from the 50s then I will happily drink their tea but until then I will go for breakfast somewhere where they will want to take my $20 for breakfast and maybe overlook a $2 tea from elsewhere."}
{"text":"Home of the $3.99 breakfast.  No, it doesn't only come with ham, toast and jam.  This came with 3 eggs, homestyle potatoes, 2 slices of toast and jam.  

It's only available Mon-Fri at that price so if you want a quick and filling breakfast before work, Sunset Grill is where it's at.  Other breakfasts I've tried is the Eggs Florentine, which was around $6.89, which also came with homestyle fries and toast.  Everything was terrific, -this place is a solid 3.5 / 5."}
{"text":"Passable place to grab a quick sit-down breakfast, but definitely nothing memorable. Then again, it's hard to screw up eggs, bacon, and potatoes, yet the potatoes managed to be a bit soggy and flavorless. Dining companion's omelet fared a bit better, but I'm not writing home about it anytime soon. 

They do a bustling business on weekends, yet turn people over very quickly. Service is prompt, if not a bit gruff (though that could be just our server), though coffee refills were hard to come by. 

Prices are reasonable, and even more so on weekdays with the specials they run. So if you come in not expecting much, you'll be cool. But having eaten at Eggspectation the next morning, I'd recommend walking a few extra blocks and heading up there instead. 

Also, not quite sure if it was just the December morning we were there, but it must have been 85 degrees in there. If there's anything worse than being hungry and hungover, it's being hungry, hungover and REALLY hot."}
{"text":"This place gives you the best bang for the buck for a breakfast meal. I actually prefer this than an overprice Cora's.

Sunset grill offers a variety of breakfast meals on their menu. It's nothing too complicated and a great to meet and hangout and enjoy the nice view that thy offer.

I don't recall the name of the meal I ordered, but the meal consist of bacon, potatoes and eg with toast. It doesn't have much, but it's all i really need...everything was cooked just like it was a home cooked meal and seasoned well that i left the plate with no crumbs.

The reason why I would recommend this place is the price, view and location. To top it off, no line ups. It's simple and quick, and I like my breakfast the same way."}
{"text":"Great food. The owner went out of his way to accommodate us. We got the Salmon Eggs Sunset and the Fruit Waffles, really good food and fast service."}
{"text":"Not bad food. The basics...although pricier than other places in the area.
Service is uneven....on a few occasions we've felt that were actually bothering the staff by coming in.
I always order egg whites and the extra charge is ridiculous ! 
Home fries are excellent, as is the yogurt/granola concoction..."}
{"text":"Popped in today. Ingrid, our waitress was fantastic! She was funny, warm and engaging. Clone her !"}
{"text":"Although I've been to 5 or 6 other Sunset Grill locations, I've never been inside this particular spot.
Located in a plaza that also contains a Baton Rouge, Burger King and a FedEx, it's fairly easy to miss. In fact, this spot used to be a florist shop until Sunset a Grill opened a year ago.
We ventured in on a Wednesday morning, on the way to a nearby Costco. 
The place is bright and airy. Although a sign at the door stated \"Please wait to be seated\", a voice yelled out to sit wherever we wanted, so we chose a seat at the front in the sun. 
Our waitress was over shortly thereafter and took our drink order. She was friendly and efficient. When she returned with our drinks, we placed our food order.
I had the pemeal sandwich with cheddar cheese on marbled rye. It comes with egg and I asked if I could have it without and was told \"of course\". It was great......the cheese was not a processed cheese slice, but grated cheddar. Score. Home fries and veggie sticks rounded out the plate. Huge amount if food for $6.99
My dining companion had the grilled cheese sandwich...bacon and cheddar on marbled rye. It also had home fries and veggie sticks and was the same price point as mine. He said it was excellent.
Coffee was replenished frequently.
Our waitress looked familiar and we couldn't place where she's been our server before, so when I went to pay, I asked where she had worked before. Turns out she was our waitress at Kotsi, a breakfast place on Highway 7....who left there to become the manager of this Sunset Grill. She was great and the three of us chatted for a few minutes about the difference between Sunset Grill and Kotsi. 
We'll go back."}
{"text":"Typical Sunset Grill...if you've been to one, you've really been to them all.
Arrived on a Thursday morning at around 7:30am......a friend was having surgery at St. Mike's Hospital and we had a few hours to kill....so we thought we'd hit the Eaton Centre once it opens. Unfortunately, Richmond/Queen intersection was under construction so getting to the restaurant wasn't easy, but that's no fault of the restaurant (I believe the city was laying tracks for a streetcar as well as doing sidewalk repairs)
It was fairly quiet when we arrived (maybe because of the street work out front) which meant we had no wait for a table. We were promptly seated and within a few seconds a waiter was over taking our drink order. When he returned with our drinks, we placed our order for bkfst and away he went.
Food arrived fairly quickly...both of us ordered the grilled cheese with bacon, which came with home fries and cucumber/carrot stick (with Ranch dressing for dipping). Food was good...home fries were a tad bland...little flavour to them. Salt and lots of pepper took care of that.
Fairly decent place for bkfst...I'd go back if in the area."}
{"text":"Typical Sunset Grill with great staff (better than average for the \"chain\").

Although this location is not easy to find (it's in a parking lot on Highway 27, near the Walmart and LCBO), locals seem to have discovered it as its VERY busy on weekends. We popped in here today (Monday morning at around 10:00am) while killing time waiting for an oil change to be competed (at the Mr. Lube in the Walmart). We practically had the place to ourselves....I think there were maybe 4 more customers...but as the time got closer to lunch, groups started to filter in.

I ordered a grilled cheese with bacon on dark rye (pumpernickel), as did my dining companion, and it was excellent. For $6.99 you get a grilled cheese with bacon, home fries and a carrot and cucumber slice (with a Ranch dip). Just the right amount of food for bkfst. This Sunset Grill has fantastic home fries....far superior to the location in front of Vaughan Mills.

I'll drive the distance to go here if it's during the week...but I avoid it on the weekends due to crowds and wait-times."}
{"text":"Clean. Fast. Friendly service. Good basic menu. All day breakfast.  Like the one in The Beach, only without the lineup.  Would come again."}
{"text":"It's a great place for breakfast/brunch in Mississauga!!!
A very clean place, nice ambiance, tastefully decorated and in a great location.

The food is fresh.... delicious!! 
A good selection of items in the menu... and the best part is, the food tastes like home cooking, seems they do not use artificial taste boosters or other non-natural ingredients.

The staff members are very friendly and caring... excellent customer service!!"}
{"text":"Been many times so far. Average food you'll find at any breakfast spot. Waitresses are beautiful and the main reason I continue going. I also organized a men's breakfast with 14 and the service was impeccable. I've been to the location at appleby / Dundas and it's like being served by you're grandmother.

I'll be sticking with my original choice."}
{"text":"all the breakfast here is really good especially most of the dishes service is always very good and efficient sometimes it's hard to find a good breakfast place in the burbs This is one of the better ones"}
{"text":"I came here expecting an average diner experience. Was pleasantly surprised by the cleanliness of the place and almost laughed out loud when my server proceeded to take my order on an iPad! Appreciate the effort, would come again."}
{"text":"Place is alright. Alot of seats which is very accomidating. Ordered the waffle with strawberries, strawberry preserves and whipped cream. Waffle was kind of dry, it was decent but i have had better. And for some reason they gave all the topping on the side for me. Im not sure if she thought i wanted it on the side. But it wasnt a big deal just unusual. Im not sure if i will come back. But if you live around this area they open early at 7. 2.5/5"}
{"text":"Nothing special here; more or less just your run-of-the-mill breakfast joint. The good news is that they do it properly. Eggs are cooked correctly and the quality is dependable. Food is pretty good but nothing special or mind-blowing. Did not find the service to be particularly commendable, but it got the job done. Place gets busy over the lunch hours but they keep the crowd moving along pretty quickly it seems, and I don't think I ever saw a notable line waiting for a table despite the influx of the corporate crowd during the weekday. I prefer this over Fran's just around the corner, but I'd still take Eggspectation over this."}
{"text":"I really like the friendly and efficient staff at this location. Typically I've never been in line to get a table with the exception of a few times over the last two years. They always have a weekend brunch special menu with some breakfast entree and an included unlimited coffee or tea, which, for me, is a really good deal because I do spend a lot of money on coffee on weekdays.  Their breakfast items are not the best I have had, but that isn't to say it's not fair for the price and still yummy. My favourites are the corned beef hash, the egg sunset (their version of eggs benedict). The portions are usually generous, with the exception of a few times where I felt I didn't get as much food in my plate as during a prior visit."}
{"text":"In the mood for some brunch, me and my gurrrrlfriend walked into the sunset grill hoping to sanction our breakfast cravings. 

We were seated by the window with a beautiful view of the parking lot as sunlight glazed in, lighting up the whole restaurant. We both ordered omelettes, mines greek and hers being a simple egg and cheese. We waited for quite awhile considering the restaurant wasn't busy on a weekday morning. The washrooms were located all the way in the back, with boxes stacked by the wall, which was not the most accessibly friendly way to get to the closest lavatory. 

The server was kind, and joked with us, which was appreciated, however I find the payment method odd here because the bill was delivered to our table, but you had to get up to the register to pay, not knowing whether your tip was going to the kind waitress or the grouchy manager behind the desk.

Anyways, food here is average, nothing to rave about. I found the salty feta in my dish really helped the omelette as without it, it was unseasoned and lacked a lot of flavour. The home fries were alright as well, not quite seasoned as well. I appreciated the fact that the bread that came with the meal was already buttered. The meal itself is a huge portion which can easily be shared among two people. One thing that struck me was that the omelette didn't taste very egg-like, which makes me wonder what do they substitute the omelette with mostly....egg whites? more milk perhaps? God only knows.....Either way, it was not the most breakfast satisfying joint I've been to, but it did the job."}
{"text":"I liked the breakfast a lot here. I got the French connection.

French toast, potatoes, 3 eggs and bacon. GREAT portions for $11. This place will fill you up for breakfast to get your day going."}
{"text":"Best sunset grill I've been to by far. The service is amazing with lots of locals. This location carries a hot sauce called \"Joanne's Tasty Hot\" which is very addictive from the first bite. It was so good I had to buy a bottle, give it a try!"}
{"text":"Great service but unfortunately the food was not on par with the service. Ordered 3 scrambled eggs that looked like 2 also being overcooked, freshly squeezed orange juice was Tropicana of sort(rip off), overcooked omelette, dry potatoes and overall the food is pretty bland."}
{"text":"Located in the heart of Toronto Sunset Grill is an average breakfast place.  The staff is really nice,  the menu is average but tastes good. Even though the eggs are the small size you can taste the freshness, the bacon was a bit chewy but overall it was all right. Not sure if I would come again"}
{"text":"Newly opened location near the four corners area and city hall. It has a great view due to the large floor to ceiling windows on two sides.

Since it is new the service and food is really good quality and we have been here a number of times. As a chain i am disappointed with the Sunset Grill due to having great service when opening a location then cutting costs impacting quality after a couple of years (Hurontario/Bovaird). I hope it does not happen to this location

We ordered a greek omelet, 3 eggs, and eggs sunset. They were good but 2 out off the 3 dishes had a hair in them. The server was apologetic and advised they would talk to the owner to prevent this again. The manager came by, apologized and advised it would not happen again"}
{"text":"I had not been here in years so its like starting again keeping in mind its under new management. We came on a holiday Monday and there was barely anyone here. It was also hot because it was July and there was no air condition.

The waitress was nice but the menu now said no substitution on menu items. I had the Eggs Florentine which was good but kind of room temperature, their thing seems to be leaving food to go cold before serving it and it wasn't even busy. Also, we had to send someone's pancakes back because we found a hair.

The moral of the story is that the restaurant should not be warmer than the food. Next time i would go to the new one that opened near the Four Corners."}
{"text":"I would never go to an establishment like this but the group I was with wanted some breakfast type food.  I can only comment on the meal I ordered: cheeseburger and home fries (they don't serve french fries).  It was disgusting.  I could barely touch it because the meat smelled so bad, which turned me off of everything else. The presentation was awful too - just everything thrown on the plate with no effort whatsoever.  I so desperately wanted to say something but I was with two friends and one of their husbands.  My friend's husband loves it there and he's so nice that I didn't want to ruin his lunch.  I cringed having to hand over my hard earned money on spoiled meat.

I guess Mississauga is not as strict as Toronto on dining safely but I would keep checking this site prior to going.

I know that was bad meat they served me."}
{"text":"Probably the worst eggs Benedict I've ever had in my life. We were going to go flips originally but settled for this place when the lime was too long at the other place. Waitress was trying to juggle 5 tables at the same time - not cool to any of the tables because she was forgetting stuff left and right. HIRE MORE PEOPLE. Given that, she did do her absolute best so must give credit where credit is due. The food however, was terrible. It was worse than making eggs in your own kitchen blindfolded. The French toast was burned and my eggs Benedict that I usually love so much were placed on a dry English muffin and a thick, not so well cooked, slice of ham on top. Chewy and not comfortable. It was even difficult to cut through the thing! On top of that, someone at the table accidentally spilled an apple juice and the manager wouldn't replace the cup! Also not cool. I'd give one star but the Waitress was nice and tried to take care of us. Overall, bad service and bad food."}
{"text":"This is that type of place where you want to come during the morning on a weekday. The waitress who works in the morning is so polite and so amazing at her job. The food is cheap if you stick to the specials for breakfast ($3.99 for 3 eggs, toast and potatoes or add an extra $2 if you want bacon or sausage). Worth it since it's fresh to order and tastes great. Stay away on weekends. It gets packed in there and food quality decreases a bit due to busyness."}
{"text":"If you want a good, large breakfast at a decent price, this is the place for you. I always get the French connection with bacon and scrambled eggs. The bacon is crispy, the eggs soft and fresh and the French Toast is actually tasty. The reason why this is 4 stars is due to the wait staff and the decor towards the back. I've been there on many occasions and have seen wait staff be rude to people who need assistance moving furniture for customers with mobility devices. On one occasion it was so bad that I stepped in. I understand that this is a busy location but it wasn't an excuse for a staff to refuse to place this person where they asked and to be outright rude. Otherwise, great location but the staff could either use more support or have better training regarding accommodations for mobility assisted persons."}
{"text":"Food tasted and was made very well - everything I ordered was made correctly. Server had an issue understanding my boyfriend's accent. But we caught the error on the order screen and it was corrected in time. Overall a good experience, however our server could have been a bit more enthusiastic and attentive. Always good food and good prices at Sunset Grill."}
{"text":"An Ontario chain planning to expand in Canadian. The place is often crowded but the waits, if necessary, are brief, the food is plentiful, tasty and cheap. Today I had the Canadian burger featuring a half pound patty,- slab of the Torotospecialtypeameal bacon, tomato, lettuce and two good slices of pickle. About $8.00US.
We have eaten here every day since our arrival."}
{"text":"Yummy! The chicken fingers are fire! I eat here everyday and love it. They are quick, friendly and the restaurant is kept very clean. The bread is so soft and tender :)  The daily specials are always delicious  and original."}
{"text":"Was there for breakfast on a whim. Ordered a smoked salmon plate, and a sunset sandwich. (Peameal, eggs, toast). The smoked salmon was nice but there were some pieces with dark spots which should've been removed. Also presentation wasn't there at all. Just piled on. The sunset sandwich had eggs that were way over cooked, dry. Peameal an potatoes nicely done. Loved the ambiance there but the deciding factor for the one star was the dry service. While mildly attentive the waitress seemed rude / not interested in making the patrons feel at ease. Very blah. Think that set the mood for the rest of the meal. Possibly resulting in me not liking anything much after. Not a place I would visit again. Still disappointed."}
{"text":"This Sunset location is clean with lots of seating and a basic breakfast and lunch menu. The problem here was the length of time it took to get served after being seated. They were understaffed and that definitely tainted our experience. The food is OK, however the service was, in our case, very bad or I should say slow since the server we did finally get was very nice. 

If the service was better, I would frequent this place more often as a decent breakfast spot."}
{"text":"I think this place deserves better than a 2.5 average review. Came here on a Friday afternoon at around 1pm. The place was pretty busy at this time but service never suffered. 

Salmon egg sunset $13.99 - Comes with three poached eggs but only two slices of muffin bread. The smoked salmon tasted great. The hollandaise sauce went well with everything. Also comes with cubes fried potatoes which is basically home fries. 

All day breakfast peameal $9.95 - Comes with three eggs of your choice, home fries, three large slices of peameal and your choice of bread. I was surprised how good the peameal tasted. It was soft and tender. Tasted great. I have never had peameal this good before.

Orange juice $4.25 - I guess this is where they make their profits.

Service was fast and friendly even though it was busy."}
{"text":"While my mom and I were wandering the streets of Toronto, breakfast sounded really good considering we were starving. So we came in here, we got seated right when we walked in. Right then I noticed how busy this place was on Tuesday afternoon around 1pm. This joint must have great food....I thought to myself. I have heard great things about Sunset Grill, despite all reviews I was reading on here. Meh, I'll give this place a shot. 

Our waiter came up to take our order right away when we got seated. I ordered the traditional breakfast containing 3 eggs scrambled, 3 strips of long bacon strips, home potatoes, and white toast. Along with what tasted like a freshly squeezed Orange juice. My mom got the exact same order but with ham. I think we waited about 10 mins before we got our order which was oddly fast considering how packed this place was. What I liked about my food was that I actually got long strips of bacon that was cooked right, they didn't try to cheap me out on a couple of scrawny strips. My moms food was alright the ham tasted normal. Our potatoes weren't mushy, thank God. 

Here's what I didn't like, everybody here seemed a bit squished together. Maybe it was because it was busy or maybe their seating is a bit weird. Don't be surprised if you get seated right beside an elderly man reading his news paper. Also what I didn't like was that my waiter didn't ask me if I wanted a small or large OJ. I guess he just assumed I wanted a large, it came to my surprise when I got charged 4 dollars for it on my bill. The food was great, no complaints there. However in my opinion I think some things on the menu are a little overpriced, and no matter how freshly squeezed an OJ may be I don't think it's worth paying almost 5 dollars w/ tax for it. For the price you are paying at the end of day, I would expect the food to be a little more over the top."}
{"text":"Great dollar value. Ordered Eggs Florentine. Eggs were cooked to perfection, lots of spinach & the hollandaise was nice. It was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Great food, fast service and friendly staff. Our family has been going to this place regularly for 5 years now and we find that the balance of quick service and great tasting food can't be beat. The 'Sunset Super' is the only way to go, great for the hungry adult or excellent for sharing between a couple of kids"}
{"text":"We saw two locals down on the harbor and asked them where a good breakfast place was and they had a difficult time thinking of one \"close\". They finally thought of Sunset Grill and said, \"you should go there. It's ok food.\" They were spot on. The food is fine. The setting is ok. The service is actually fairly good and the speed of the good prep was great. 

If you are staying at the Westin this is the closest decent breakfast place unfortunately. It may seem far on the way there, but on the way back you realize it isn't that bad. Turn right our of the Westin and then left on Yonge until you see it on your left on the corner of Queens East I think, 6-7 blocks.

I ordered the Sunset Grill, which is their version of Eggs Benedict. The \"bacon\" is of course, Canadian Bacon... aka Ham. I'm not sure why I didn't see that coming, but I definitely prefer that over \"bacon\" on my Eggs Benedict anyways. I had Eggs Benedict at Cora's earlier this week and actually liked it much more, and there are several non-traditional options for it there as well (I had one with Brie!).

Overall, it is an average place that suffices for a quick breakfast, but not a place you will remember as a visitor or return to on your next trip."}
{"text":"Had a nice breakfast with my daughter. She enjoyed the blueberry pancakes while I tried the western omelette with potatoes and rye toast. 
We were seated promptly by our wonderful server Katie. Our table was clean and orderly. The ambiance is casual, perfect for a Sunday morning. 
We started with coffee and juice which arrived quickly. The first cup of coffee for the day must be rapido! The coffee was a touch strong which was perfect for me. Complementary refills were frequent and timely. 
The food came within minutes and was fresh and hot.  The omelette was chock full of onions and ham and the potatoes were plentiful, although a touch undercooked for my preference. The blueberry pancakes were fresh off the griddle and teeming with fresh berries. A bit of whipped butter and syrup and you've got lots of energy to take on the day. 
A special shout out to our awesome server Katie! Her service was second to none."}
{"text":"For ages I kept hearing my friends rave about this place, and I jumped at the opportunity to go (after all, who doesn't love hot breakfast?). I've been three times now, and I still don't understand the hype.

The service is consistently good, and although this place is always busy, I've never had to wait for a seat and I've never felt like that place was too crowded. It can get a little noisy though, making it difficult to talk without feeling like you're shouting.

I typically get scrambled eggs with bacon, home fries, and rye toast with coffee. It's just okay. My biggest issue is with the home fries. Hands down, these are the worst home fries I've ever had. They are always cold and hard; they definitely have not been cooked enough, I may as well have eaten a raw potato. On my first visit I thought maybe this was a fluke and gave them another chance, but it's happened every single time I've eaten there. Hugely disappointing, as the home fries are always my favourite part of going out for breakfast. The eggs, bacon, and toast are fine, but nothing is good enough to make up for those home fries. There are much better places to go for a hot breakfast."}
{"text":"Tasted alright, nothing really surprised me about their food or their service. If just want somewhere to eat, food that tastes good but not excellent as well as service that is good enough to take your order and bring you food, then this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"I want to say that this place is super awesome, firstly because of the food and secondly because of our waitress Lindsey. 

I had friends visiting from N.Y., so I wanted to take them to a great brunch spot. And, I love the sunset grill franchise, so I decided to bring them here for some good old fashioned breakfast.

We started our breakfast journey with a cup of coffee. The coffee was ok, definitely drinkable. Our mugs were consistly refilled by our magnificent waitress. She was always on point when our mugs was low on coffee. I then ordered the Sunset super which consisted of three eggs and two pancakes served with home fries, with the options of adding bacon, ham, or sausage for a couple more dollars. You can order your eggs to your preference, which is awesome because they do it exactly the way you like it. I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed every bite, especially the eggs and pancakes. The pancakes were so fluffy and buttery. The home fries were slightly undercooked, but when you add ketchup it wasn't that bad. And, at $8 for all of that, it's a very good price point. 

The customer service was excellent. Our waitress Lindsey would consistently check to see if everything was ok or if we needed anything. She was always smiling and super polite. You will definitely see me back here. Great food with many breakfast options, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Really, really watered down drinks.  When we asked the manager about this his response was \"If you don't like it.. leave\".  We have a boat at Whiskey Island Marina and after that I said I wouldn't go back.  It's a shame because it's such a beautiful place.  But you are treated like a nuisance and it's horribly under staffed."}
{"text":"Pancake Tuesday did not disappoint.  Great deal and the money goes to Cancer research which is important to me as I'm going through treatments myself.  Apart from relying on them when I just couldn't cook, my kids and I have been going to this location about 2-3 times per month since it opened.  We used to live in Richmond Hill and now we are just down the street in King City.  Either way, I prefer this location to other locations. They are a great family run business. All the servers are very attentive and genuinely happy to see you. The owner is very accommodating with any special requests.  You should go!!"}
{"text":"If theres anything more creepy than middle-aged boat guys or Affliction wearing, weekend warrior motorcycle guys I dont know but this place has it all and its hillarious.  Im not going to mention my dining \"experience\" or the dining \"space\" because Ill leave that up to the Yelpsters.  This place serves burgers, fries and wraps in a basket.  They serve domestic tallboys and shots.  You will have to sneak in your Founders, Dogfish Head IPA and Moscow Mules if you want a true patio experience.  90% of the seating is outdoors and I know people will cream their Z Cavariccis over that on Yelp.  They usually have some sort of local bands playing but you look up from your Apple product long enough they might actually play a Mumford and Sons song for ya!  They do beer tastings for local breweries in the area which is good to see.   Great mix of people watching and the shitter is always broke.  I feel right at home.  Pho and pupusa would only make it a true Yelp-worthy dining destination (crosses fingers!!)  Because Cleveland needs more of that."}
{"text":"What's that saying? \"Never brunch without a plan?\" Okay, there's no such saying... But there should be--to prevent people like me from just going into random places for brunch on the weekends.

So we walked around one weekend and just figured there are plenty of places to grab breakfast around town. We'll just eat when we get hungry. Well, we got hungry around Yonge and Richmond, and we thought \"hey, this place usually always has people in it\" and \"we kinda still want breakfast food\" and \"Le Petit Déjeuner is far and there will inevitably be a long wait\" so let's try this place: Sunset Grille.

There was a wait, but it wasn't too long. And it was busy, but not too the point that the servers weren't going still and checking on the customers. 

When we sat down. We were given the menu, shortly thereafter the server can't back and took our order. Then we waited for our food.

Next to us was an extended  family with some kids. They weren't overly loud, but we could certainly hear them and noticed them... And it looked like one of the kids wasn't feeling so good. And strangely enough, instead of taking the kid to the washroom, they urged him to throw up into the plate at the table. All this while some of the servers were walking by, yet no one stopped to ask if they could do anything to help or suggest the family take the kid to the washroom, etc.

It gets worse. When the family leaves, the next set of people are walked to the table to sit... While the throw up was still in the plate that was still on the table, in clear sight. 

And then our food came. We were horrified, but tried to move on. Dug into our food. Both of us got eggs of some sort or another. Neither of us were able to eat more than half of our plates. It tasted like everything was soaked in butter and then cooked and then soaked in more butter again. 

When we walked out the door, our immediate reaction was, there is a Tim Hortons next door?? Why didn't we just walk a few more steps and see that? Given a redo, we'd go to Tim Hortons... Or Dineen on the next block for coffee and croissant."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast. Budget friendly place. They have a 3 eggs special for $4 and some change. I got the 3 eggs with sausage breakfast for $6.50. It came with toast and potato. The food was good. I also had the tourist minicard to get a free pancake with my meal. Even on a weekday at 11am, the place was pretty busy. My waiter was friendly. Refilled my water whenever it was low. Fun fact, wheat bread is called brown bread in Canada. Learn that when I came to this place."}
{"text":"Decent breakfast. Eggs good, bread good, potatoes hard and dry as if they were reheated after being prepped 3 hours earlier. Price is ok and service is good!"}
{"text":"This is the place you should go to if you want to see your breakfast about 30 minutes after you've ingested it.  Is that TMI?

I don't know anyone who can properly digest the breakfast here.  It is *that* greasy.  I'm not sure if that is an endorsement or a warning, you decide.

My SO had the eggs benny which he described as the \"greasiest, heaviest\" version of the dish he has ever had.  Ugh.  Hollandaise sauce is an art people, not a competition in calories (altho it's full of those too).

The food is decent, but it is far from the best option in the area.  If you are craving something greasy (read: have a wicked hangover) I suppose it's worth a try, but when you find yourself running to the nearest bathroom, don't blame it on the night before."}
{"text":"We often go Sunday mornings at 9am. It is usually steady, but not too busy. Warm and friendly service. This week I had the French toast on multigrain with strawberries and maple syrup, but I also like to make my own omelette. My husband likes the very reasonably priced breakfast sandwich. Home fries can be substituted for sliced tomatoes no charge."}
{"text":"Sunset grill is just a basic breakfast diner. I have experience under cooked home fries and They don't except reservation. Sun set grill is quick and cheap breakfast but if your coming in a large group you might wait half an hour before you get a table. Their biggest table that seats 8 people is situated in the back in a crammed area. There are other tables that only seat 2 - 4 people."}
{"text":"It's a nice comfy place. Service is great. Food is yummy and to our surprise they serve HALAL meat and chicken and turkey."}
{"text":"First time i have been to this place and I am vey sure it will be the last time. I went there alone and once they see a young woman, they think she won't tip well so why even bother asking her how her food is?! Service: fail!  Food: just okay, she gave me wrong order but I didn't want to return and make her feel bad. The lady at the cashier gave me the receipt, no \"thank you\" nothing till she saw I tipped her 5bucks and she turned color. Unbelievable!!!"}
{"text":"Good food and even better service!

SUPER PRO:
- Sue! She was just awesome! Very friendly, good recommendations, and just super in general - God Bless :)

PROS:
- Clean
- Family friendly
- Good food, made with love
- Nice portions
- Very reasonable cost

CONS:
- No Halal menu options

VERDICT:
Great customer service, good food, reasonable prices - this is hands down one of the best. They only thing I would suggest to the management is to bring some Halal menu options. Pretty please! :)"}
{"text":"Hi everyone the server she was polite she did served me right away with hot coffee and she took my order but I got my breakfast very late and cold 
Also the Coke man he did add onion and cheese  I didn't ask for it
Not a pleasant experience in that branch
Thank U"}
{"text":"Last time coming here, everytime I come here I ask for extra well done home fries and over easy eggs and,well, have a look at the photo I attached, the eggs are mega runny, the potatoes are barely cooked and my girlfriend is now in a bad mood. Breakfast fail. Egg fail, potato fail, never coming back, they wouldn't let us just keep our Tim Hortons tea off to the side so they took them to the front. Dunno what's wrong with me for coming back and subjecting myself to this kinda lack of care. Whatever. No stars if I could."}
{"text":"Sunset, a consistently subpar breakfast spot.

Absolutely no thought put into their menu (\"you can have an all meat omelette but not an all meat breakfast, but you can order the bacon breakfast and the ham breakfast and...\")... yes I would like 3 separate breakfasts just for me, instead of paying a few dollars more for a couple sides... thank you. 

After 30min we found the sides after glancing at the menus again sitting beside our table, and they are $5 for an extra few pieces of ham, another $5 for a few pieces of bacon, etc. Other breakfast joints charge $12-15 for all the meats and eggs and toast and potatoes. Here the equivalent would be over $20...

Staff all seem so sad and depressed. Sunset just always seems to be a generally badly managed chain. This is the 6 or 7th time I've been at different Sunset restaurants and they all seem to be the same."}
{"text":"A cute, quaint, tasty breakfast. No fuss just eat and get on with your day. Service was good, fast, and friendly as well. Avocado toast was sooo good."}
{"text":"I love sunset grill.  I've been to several locations and they are always able to help me out in getting a good breakfast.  This did not happen today.

This is not a knock at the chain.  I love the chain.

I have some food issues.  I must avoid gluten due to health concerns.

I typically am able to get a fruit cup, a couple of eggs, and some bacon cooked in a separate pan.

This location was spotless.  The decor was nice.  The restaurant smelled clean.  The staff was very friendly.

All of that, and the restaurant was unable to think of one thing that they could serve me.

I get it.  It can be tough, and there can be some real effort in making a special breakfast, but every other sunset grill that I have been to had a plan in place so that people like me can eat.

I've had to leave several restaurants like I did today, and then I realized that feedback both positive and negative helps restaurants to cater to their clients.

I hope that this reaches the ears of those who are able to make a change on this."}
{"text":"If you're in the downtown core area and are looking for an affordable breakfast Sunset Grill is the place to go. I'm glad they serve breakfast all day because I usually wake up past 10:30 am lol.

We arrived for breakfast on a Sunday morning and were promptly seated. Last time I was here the wait was too long so I left. Good thing I got to try them out this time! Our server was friendly and took our drink orders first. We both ordered a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice. It was about $3.50 a glass and it wasn't a tall glass so I thought it was a bit overpriced. For our meal we both got either the bacon or sausage with three sunny side up eggs accompanied by toast and home fries. The food didn't take too long to come out which was good because we were starving. Our meal was good but I prefer Cora's home fries more. 

The only negative thing from our visit was the time it took to get our bill and get the change back."}
{"text":"I had the Philly cheese steak with extra cheese. It was pretty good. I also like that they have seasoned fries. Solid place to eat."}
{"text":"We had a long wait due to a local charity event. The server was friendly. We ordered the crab cake Benedict. I am not sure how many crabs were harmed to make it, maybe more like crab with a \"k\" (aka fake crab). The sauce was good. We had French toast. It's made with thick bread as was the white toast. We ordered a couple standard egg- bacon breakfasts that comes with some excellent potato cubes. Prices were very fair for an in the city restaurant. We took another Yelpers advice and brought our own coffee from Starbucks which is right down the street."}
{"text":"Fantastically friendly staff, good music, good food. I was served promptly and found even on a weekday this place is buzzing. Food was clean and tasty. I will be back."}
{"text":"I think what bugs me the most is $5.49 for extra bacon and $2.99 for maple syrup. To give a little credit the syrup comes in a reusable bottle so you can take the unused portion home with you - but I like a place where I can put together my order piece meal and have the items add up to the price.  If all I want is french toast and bacon - why can't I have that w/o paying for a bigger meal and asking them to hold half the things?  So the pricing is why I knocked two stars.  See, knocked TWO stars.  The food is great, the service is great.  I'm just unhappy because I couldn't get what I want for what I'm willing to pay.  

Granted - the server did listen and she was wonderful.  My meal came as ordered.

p.s. Half a star knocked off as well for not having the ability to season my eggs BEFORE they hit the plate."}
{"text":"Not bad at all. I went there with three of my friends for a weekday brunch service on Thursday. Three of the guys had the regular pancakes, and one of the guys had the \"Sunset Deluxe\" (bacon, eggs, toast and sausage). No complaints from anybody, and the food was really inexpensive. I did find the pancakes to be a bit generic and it tasted a little bland without maple syrup. My buddy said that the Deluxe meal was fantastic, though.

What really made the difference was the customer service. Despite the restaurant being packed, our server was very diligent and refilled our coffee every 10 minutes. The woman was very polite and kind, and was never too far away. 

Decor was excellent: very modern look.

I would come back, but I would get something different than the pancakes."}
{"text":"Should have left...one waitress for an entire restaurant, who also plays the hostess and cashier...you can't be serious."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast this morning after staying at the Marriott on Bloor (super close by). We chose to eat on the patio-service was quick, friendly and service of our food was fast. If you want a classic breakfast, cooked well without any bells or whistles-this place is it. The dishes were hearty and we left full and happy-what more could you want after a late night out."}
{"text":"Sunset Grill -- the food is nothing special, but it's cheap and it comes with friendly service, a central location, and a good selection of classic breakfast options. I came on a weekend and it was busy, but we had no problem being seated promptly. 

I had the orange juice (freshly squeezed! none of that gross 'from concentrate' stuff) and the vegetarian omelette, which uses 3 eggs + tomatoes, onions, green peppers, and mushrooms. I added cheddar cheese for $1.50 extra. The omelette was tasty, served with hash browns and toast. My DC had coffee (free refills!) and the eggs florentine. She liked her meal and was pleased that our server read her mind and brought out the hot sauce without her asking (okay, she is South Asian, so maybe our server was stereotyping... but in this case, he was right!). The portions are big, so come with an empty stomach! 

The menu also includes waffles, pancakes, sandwiches, and burgers. There is an early bird special if you come before 11am. 

Service was great. Very attentive and our server anticipating any need (brought out glasses of water immediately) and seemed to genuinely enjoy his job. The food came out quickly, but we weren't rushed out the door once we were done. You bring you bill up to the cashier to pay when you're ready."}
{"text":"Every now and then a big chain can replicate the joys of a greasy spoon.  This place is one of the best at that.  

Now - if you get their early bird special, you're looking for a good cheap meal.  If you're there later on, look to pay about 11 bucks a plate.  That's not too too bad, to be sure, and many of the Torontonians see that as an acceptable breakfast price - sadly I remember the days where five dollars, after tax and tip, got you a meal of eggs, bacon, hashbrown, and toast.  But that's when they had bees on their nickels, or some such nonsense.

If you don't feel like cooking, and you're close by, it's not a disappointment."}
{"text":"The food isn't that good. The waitress was very friendly and attentive, but the food was below average. I actually drive to Cora's in Barrie (20+minutes drive) for a good breakfast place"}
{"text":"Nice place with good service,  a little pricey for lunch, but the food is really good ,  the egg salad is just the way I like it and the staff is friendly"}
{"text":"Not a bad spot for a quick lunch, or breakfast. We sat outside on the patio during a lunch break this week. It was beautiful weather, so the patio was pretty busy, but the inside was dead.

The service was on the slow side, but at least the server was perfectly nice. 

The food (greek chicken salad) was ok, but there was way too much going on with the chicken seasoning, so much going on, in fact, that it was overpowering, and I actually tried to cut the outside of the chicken strips off, so I could spare my taste buds the assault. It wasn't easy or successful, so I just had the salad. The rest of the salad was good, and it was obvious the ingredients were fresh which is always nice. 

The checks came out wrong, and then there was a debate about whether or not they could be separated. I find it hard to believe that separating checks is an uncommon request, but in the end they were separated and we paid and went on our merry way.

Good spot for a quick bite, but I'd probably walk another block or two before I went back here."}
{"text":"Good food, HUGE portions, good price! 
Definitely don't go in expecting anything fancy, but it is great for what it is: a classic breakfast. 

The service is good and I've never had to wait too long for a table, even when it's busy."}
{"text":"Good food, quick service and right in the centre of downtown - can't really go wrong. It's a nice spot when you want some comfort food brunch."}
{"text":"its a nice place for breakfast .the hamburger i ordered was very tasty.unfortunately my family didn't like much the food they ordered .Waitress did good job to serve us!"}
{"text":"I'd give this more of a 3.5* then 3 but both kinda work. 

I mean what can you say about breakfast. It was bacon & eggs. The bacon was crispy enough but the potatoes we undercooked even though we asked the waitress (Irene) to be sure they were crispy. The dark eye was very tasty. I would do this place over again but don't have high expectations, ok! 

P.S. The cashier \"Andy\" was rather grumpy & mentioned that he'd overindulged last evening. Everyone is entitled to have some fun but just don't bring that to work. Smile for your customer!"}
{"text":"This was a solid breakfast. Our server was very efficient & extremely pleasant. I ordered the standard breakfast of Bacon, eggs & home fries with dark rye toast. The bacon was not as crispy as I like. She took it back & delivered back a plate full of heaven! The bacon was EXACTLY as I like it. Very crispy! It was delicious. If I could have created the perfect breakfast...this was it!"}
{"text":"I've been visiting this place very frequently and realized the people who work here are very nice and very welcoming. 
The food choices are always changing which I feel keeps it fresh. I sometimes wish they were open longer than 3pm but that's okay. 
The omelette I ordered was very filling and the vegetables were cooked really well inside the egg.
Their coffee is something different which I like, I usually end up ordering 3-4 refills because it tastes freshly brewed.
Overall, it's a great place to visit if you're single or in a group of 6-8 people. 
However, I feel the prices can be a little more affordable if possible as a bill for 2 can exceed $30 if you're really hungry."}
{"text":"Food was ok ...love the potatoes...problem is i feel they throw everything in the plate

Also...i dont know if they have a problem with the kitchen fan but we smell the food really bad after our visit..."}
{"text":"First time here at this Sunset Grill for breakfast. Great local joint..2 minutes from home. Food was great, portion is good and most important food serve hot which is awesome!!! We had the club sandwich comes with home fries and 3 eggs with Ham. Busy place, it gets packed and can feel cramp between the tables, music was a bit to loud for such a small space. I also like that I did not feeI rushed to finish my meal. I would recommend and will be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Been back here several times and the service is consistently good.  The food is consistently good.  The place is consistently clean.  You just have to know how to work the menu to get the best deal for your money."}
{"text":"Ok, so this is jut an update to my absolute favorite breakfast joint in Toronto.  I now eat here twice a week on the weekends....I would eat here more if work did not impede;)  I have tried too many other breakfast places in Toronto to count and can honestly say that no one comes close to Sunset on Queen Street.  Great Food, Great Service, and Great Value!  Doesn't get any better than this."}
{"text":"my 3rd visit to this particular location. usually go on weekdays and it was alright. However went on Saturday Morning; and what a difference.  (yes, it was packed with people)  so staff was running around and kitchen was busy.  Lacked customer service.  Had to keep asking for coffee refill, server was not keeping an eye on us for 'service'.   Served us 3 plates of pancakes, and then had to be flagged down for \"SYRUP\". Honestly, where do you get pancakes but no syrup?!
I ordered white toast, and was brought brown bread, not too serious could easily be corrected.  Except when I waved down the nonhelpful server and showed her the error she tried to convince me it was white toast.  I had to hold it up against the people at the next table toast to show her : \"they have white toast , this is wholewheat/brown toast\"  Please just go bring me white toast before the eggs get too cold.  ((((  I won't be going back ))))
   If you want to go see for yourself, then by all means ................  you'll be shaking your head, and ask is this the Twilight Zone"}
{"text":"first time at this spot, just off hwy401.
 parking lot behind.   (seat yourself)
Coffee was Good, menu also has lots of choices. Saw what other tables were getting, looked appealing. Bacon&Eggs w/toast done just right!!  The kitchen has their act together.
  tasty, good presentation and fast.   The waitress however, not quite.  Her timing seemed off, she didn't have the necessary common sense.  had to ask for \"cutlery\" .
table beside got pancakes, he had to wait til she appeared to ask for syruP. who serves pancakes and not put out syrup?!
   I'd go back, just be hopeful there was another server's shift. 
 5star food subtract 2 for table server= 3star"}
{"text":"I really like this place! It has great and fast service , the prices are reasonable and in the summer they have a small area to eat outside and people watch. This is my go to breakfast place in the are :)"}
{"text":"Average place, taste is bland, prices are high. If u like to eat close to the next table then this for you, not for me. Brunch time very busy I don't know why people like this place? 
No handicap washroom!!!

Friendly restaurant up the road blows this place away!!!"}
{"text":"Faced with choosing between a $26 per person breakfast at the hotel, or taking a walk down here, I decided to try this place.  It was well worth the short walk from the hotel.

This place was busy.  But, even on my first trip, during a busy weekend, it didn't take long to get a seat.  The breakfast options are plentiful.  I went with the pancakes and home fries on day 1, and the yogurt/fruit blend on day 2.  Both good options, depending on the amount of food you want.  

Service is good, and the food is delicious.  The cost for two of us was about the same as the cost for 1 breakfast buffet at the hotel."}
{"text":"Ah, the omnipresent all-day-breakfast diner. What better place to come here after getting out of bed at 1 pm on a Sunday?

I've always had a weakness for eggs florentine and the version at Sunset is what you should expect at a greasy spoon. Mmmm, the rich yolk as it soaks into my English muffins. And you know it ain't good for you, but the Hollandaise here must be the saltiest and the oiliest I've ever had; it practically sticks to your arteries.

And the homefries, the homefries. Salty, cripsy, white starch. I do love you despite what good nutrition says. You are small, bite-sized and cooked perfectly so that they crumble lightly in the mouth.

Definitely a secret guilty pleasure."}
{"text":"I typically don't like going to these chains when I want to eat a quality breakfast but my friend really wanted to go to Sunset Grill. We arrived at this location and got seated right away. My friend ordered a coffee and somehow the server spilled coffee on the table. Bad start but it got a bit better. We ordered our meals - bacon and eggs. There was a ton of bacon on my plate, maybe 5 strips which was nice. Usually places don't give you enough. The homefries tasted decent, not too much of the spices other places usually overdo, and the eggs were the typical over easy. The server came by to refill our coffees consistently so that was nice. Not much else to say about this place as their breakfast is pretty standard."}
{"text":"We come here at least every other sunday. Service is amazing even when it is crazy busy!
Food is always perfect, great portions and the price can't be beat for what you're getting!
I highly recommend this place! Best breakfast in the GTA!"}
{"text":"Kinda torn between three and four stars, but I'm feeling generous. I'm apparently one of the few people who liked Cropicana, and I don't think much changed menu-wise, except things are even more basic and simple now. That's not all bad. My husband got some respectable ribs and I got a perfectly serviceable black bean burger. The service is quick and pleasant and the prices are reasonable. The crowd is pure Cleveland (I give myself license to lovingly tease as a native) -- lots of mullets, jeans shorts and questionable tank tops. Maybe people will approach this place with more realistic expectations now that the Crop name is gone.  It's still a great locale to enjoy the open air and the waterfront in a friendly and inclusive setting."}
{"text":"I wish I could give negative stars. This was hands down the worst breakfast I've ever eaten out. I admit, I'm a brunch fanatic and as I get older I start to favour the fancier kind over the old school diner but I believe an all-day breakfast place should make a decent breakfast. They didn't.

I had a very simple three eggs, fruit, toast and homefries. Easy right? The homefries tasted like sawdust. The eggs were fine but bland, maybe it's the kind of egg they use, I don't know. The fruit bowl was slimy and not sweet. 

My bf had a peameal & egg breakfast - the peameal was dry, same notes about the homefries and eggs. 

The plusses - our waitress was quite nice, the coffee wasn't bad and well, it's cheap. 

I'd discuss the decor but why bother if the food is bad. That said...the table on the patio was dislocated top from bottom so I almost wore my coffee when my bf figured it out. The table we were at was against the fence next to their garbage - complete with a cook coming out with a steaming bag of fresh garbage to add to the ambiance. I should have stayed home and made my own."}
{"text":"So I heard about this from a friend and they told me to try the breakfast burrito. I placed a to go order and must say the burrito was really good! Also priced well. Will be returning ;)"}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed my poached eggs with smoked salmon.  It was served on an English muffin, with Hollandaise sauce.  My waiter was cheerful and friendly.  My daughter had pancakes which were delicious as well.  They didn't offer her any maple syrup though - I thought that was odd.  But, I would definitely eat here again.  The food arrived hot and quickly, just the way I prefer!"}
{"text":"I don't understand why this place has bad reviews.  We got here at noon on a sunday, and there was no line up.  The food was great, the price was great, and service was fast and friendly.   There was a short wait for the french toast, but everything else came out in under 10 minutes after ordering with a full restaurant.  COME HERE FOR BREAKFAST!"}
{"text":"Our family of 3 asked when placing our order if our home fries could be cooked longer and/or be crispy. The waitress told us she would try and ask but wasn't sure because it was busy. Our food came and our home fries looked like boiled potatoes that had barely hit the flat top for browning. We asked the waitress why they weren't able to accommodate our requests and she said if we wanted them crispy she would take them back and we would have to wait 20 min. We asked why wasn't the request put forth when giving in our order since that was what we asked for and she stated that on weekends they are very busy and everyone asks for it and if they were to accommodate everyone it would be crazy. I questioned her if everyone asks then why do they not provide crispier home fries and she got upset and said she would take our food back and we said no at this point and continued on with our meal since we didn't want to wait an additional 20 min. My husband then saw her go to the gentleman that was attending to all the payments from customers (we were assuming he was the manager or owner) and told him what we were asking for and he squinted his face in and shook his head as if he was saying no way and as if we had asked and brought something up so  ridiculous. We couldn't believe how horrible the customer service was. The waitress did not even ask us how our meal was while we were eating and asked the table next to us loudly so we could hear. 

The message we clearly got is that this location only cares about pushing food out as fast as they can so get the next table in. They do not care about their customers and cannot even provide the basic of customer service. We definitely will not be going back for this reason on how something so simple was mismanaged and poorly taken care of. 

Since it was horrible service we did not tip. We always tip over and beyond but definitely felt the woman did not deserve anything with her attitude and how she handled the situation.

Breakfast here is so so and the only thing going for them is the location. I'm sure that's all they're counting on for business and will continue with crappy service. Hopefully more people can provide their reviews and make them realize there is a way of handling customers better than they currently are."}
{"text":"Service is super fast and friendly! I like coming here early in the morning as it doesn't seem to be as packed as lunch can be. It is a bit pricy, but it's nice for treat once in a while!

I was a bit disappointed that my side of strawberries seemed to be a few dollars extra for a tiny cup of maybe one and a half cut up strawberries but the waffle was so good that I forgot about it haha!"}
{"text":"I've been to a few Sunset Grill's around the Toronto area. While the portions are ample, I don't find the food rather memorable.

Breakfast joints are a dime a dozen, but  I didn't find it any more special then Denny's frankly.

Left with no where else to go, it's a good choice, but not my fist choice when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Who doesn't like going out for a plate of good breakfast?

This place I did enjoy but I find it VERY overcrowded...I think this is the only place in Ajax now for breakfast.  There's used to be Baywood but they vanished. 

Another issue I had with this place is that I think they only use a somewhat dry cloth to wipe up the tables to the point where they are still sticky with syrup or whatever was spilt on the table. 

Hence the reason my friends and I nickname this place \"sticky tables\" lol.

Other than that though the food is great and prices are reasonable. 
There is A LOT of selection for everyone and everything comes piping hot.

If you don't mind a little bit of a wait to get a table and somewhat of a loud atmosphere for your early morning meal, then this place is an ok place to check out."}
{"text":"I ordered the eggs sunset and asked for my eggs to be poached soft. 1/3 eggs were actually soft, the other 2 were medium. Should've gone to Eggsmart. Not impressed. The home fries were good though but doesn't make up for the botched eggs I received."}
{"text":"Typical breakfast place. I like their eggs and bacon, speedy service and pleasant servers. 
Makes Saturday/Sunday mornings pleasant."}
{"text":"After being seated it took about 20 minutes to flag down a waitress. I really felt like soup, and for the first time ever, I was told that the \"soup of the day\" was that they had NO soup. 
I read other reviews on here and apparently half of the menu is always missing.

I dunno, the food was \"okay\" at most, but I think this is the worst location for this place. The atmosphere and waitress weren't the worst but I didn't feel comfortable at all. We had to ask for things multiple times, and were just looked at very strangely multiple times instead of just saying \"yes right away\" or something. As if asking for peanut butter and jam is so bizarre with toast."}
{"text":"I had to change my review from
4 to 2 stars. Which I've never done. But the service here is just ridiculously stupid. They have little devices to write the orders down so that even a monkey could do the job...yet they fail...and fail miserably every time! But this last time was the worst. Fine...if I order tea and you don't ask me which kind and bring me basic Orange Pekoe, that's forgivable and apparently a norm. But my girlfriend asked for a side of tomatoes instead of homefries, and she got homefries. You asked me if I wanted white, brown or sark rye bread for my sandwich, i said brown, and u bring me dark rye.

I mean...you have ONE job! And the only restaurant I know that gives you a personal electronic notepad to make it easier...but seriously, every damn time."}
{"text":"My first time here, meeting a friend for breakfast. Lots of parking in the plaza!!
Place is clean, including tables, chairs and washroom!!

I ordered decaf, they freshly brewed it for me :)
I had scrambled eggs, sausage and bacon, toast.  Food was good, no complaints!

Service from staff is excellent, came around to ask if you wanted to refill coffee often.

Very happy with my visit here. Tues morning around 10am, it was fairly busy.


Reading previous reviews, i wasn't sure about coming here, but my friend insist that he gets better food and service at this location compared to other sunset grills and eggsmart locations. I can agree now. Also, the lower star reviews are a few years ago, 

5 Stars for service ( friendly staff)
4 Stars for food (good size serving)

Looking forward to doing a follow up review in the near future."}
{"text":"The food was mediocre. That's fine - you get what you pay for. 

What wasn't acceptable was how several groups were seated before us, even though they arrived after us. The reason stated was that these were groups of 3 or 4 and we were only 2, and larger tables had become available earlier. That's fine and I don't mind waiting when it's a one or two larger groups that arrive after us, who are seated earlier. But when it's like 5 groups that one watches get seated time after time that's unacceptable. 

Further when this was pointed out to management, she shifted blame to the server and said \"if I knew I would have seated you\", rather than taking accountability for the policy and apologizing. 

It's less the policy than the managers attitude that incensed me, as I also deal with customers and when something goes wrong and the customer is unhappy, I immediately apologize and TAKE accountability. 

There's waaay better places for the money as well and I'd suggest you take your business there"}
{"text":"It was my first time at this place. I had a good experience in general. Food didn't take too long. Servers were friendly. Prices are decent."}
{"text":"Great service and perfect breakfast at a really nice spot. Typically busy tho"}
{"text":"I've been here once and can honestly say, there isn't much for the health-conscious meat-free diet here. For everyone else, expect your standard breakfast options. 
Totally diner style, and probably much louder inside now than when it had just opened, wait staff is friendly and the food is precisely what you can expect from such a place."}
{"text":"It took far too long for the food to come. The restaurant was moderately seated (it's a small space). There were no power plugs that we could see.

The corned beef hash was good, but the portion size was disappointingly small for $10.49.

Wifi password is goodfood77, but the wifi didn't work. Staff directed us to use the dealership's wifi across the road, I'm amazed I got signal that far away."}
{"text":"Nice place. Had the Sunset Healthy for brunch. Service was great. All the people that I interacted with were very nice and courteous"}
{"text":"I came here for breakfast with my team on a Friday. Weekday mornings are not busy and food is served pretty quickly. Their bottomless coffee is okay (not expecting much given price).  Eggs benny are always my go to comparison entree whenever I have breakfast/brunch at any restaurant.  I had the Egg's Florentine and enjoyed the meal. The hollandaise sauce was smooth but not rich. The servings are quite big meaning you won't be too hungry for lunch!"}
{"text":"Great quality meal. Had a late breakfast here and would definitely eat here again. Food arrived quickly and with very friendly service."}
{"text":"Greatest way to start a morning after a long night of drinking is with a greeeeezy greeeezy breakfast! Sunset Grill is the go to locale for Sunday or Saturday brunch.  The menu is fairly consistent.  I've been here a few times and they always seem to prepare the food exactly the same way they did the last time. Consistency is key and when you're hung over the last thing you want is a cook going rogue and deciding to put cilantro in your scrambles eggs.  Just gimme the regs gawd dammit! LOL.  Nice and over easy with some corned beef hash, a side of french toast with crispy bacon all smothered in good old 100% Canadian maple syrup.  Mmm Mmm good!  Hungry yet?  I'm not because I just consumed over 2000 calories of breakfast glory. Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"This place has very quick and good service. The food is always good and never disappoints. You can't go wrong by the scrambled eggs, potatoes and toast! We generally get the fluffy pancakes and they are delish. We recently visited during Mother's Day and our server was fast and attentive. She brought my son a plastic cup with a straw so he can enjoy his orange juice and refilled our water and coffee. At the end of our meal they gave me a rose which was very sweet! This is my go to breakfast place!!"}
{"text":"Sunset grill never disappoints me to disappoint me. Tried something new this time and ordered the crabcake benny. Not great, not delicious. The crabcake tasted like...not crabcake. The eggs were slightly overcooked, half not runny. And the worst part about SG's bennies are their hollandaise sauce. Servers at sunset grills except the one in downtown always has the \"i worked all night\" look on their face."}
{"text":"If Sunset Grill is your only option for brunch, drive down the street and go to Tims. I never had good experience here, and this time, I found a fly looking thing in my food.

The hollandaise sauce tasted nothing like egg yolks, and it wasn`t at all creamy and thick. It was as if I was eating some artificial sauce. After I complained about my food, the waitress gave me a new plate where the eggs were fully cooked (for a runny benny)."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday morning close to noon, place was pretty packed but there were seats available. 

Our server took our order and food came quickly. I got the Organic Yogurt with The Works, thinking it would be super healthy - yogurt & fruits. But when I digged into it, there was strawberry jam. Don't get me wrong, it definitely made the bowl of yogurt 10x tastier, but I was going for the healthy option. Overall my food was average, nothing special about it, nothing you cannot make at home.

Friend got the Meat Lovers Omlette, which I thought wasn't too bad. 

We had trouble getting our servers attention at times but Sunset Grill is definitely a decent spot for a quick brunch in downtown core if you don't have insane expectations for brunch like me."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for a long time but just had the worst meal ever. Ordered a steak and egg but I also got a side order of grease. My eggs were covered with grease. I took a bite of the steak and it was completely nasty plus grease went all over my shorts. 

I told the waitress I couldn't eat this. She asked if I wanted anything else and after all what happen, I rejected. She spoke to someone else (I'm assuming he was a manager because he didn't introduce himself) and he came over. Didn't apologize but instead try to justify the meal. At the end he asked if I wanted anything and I once again rejected. 

I gave it 3 stars because I had great breakfast before but I will not be returning. Thanks sunset grill for the pass great meals but it will be the last time. 

My wife's meal, 2 OJ and coffee cost = $24 (including tip because waitress didn't do anything wrong and she shouldn't get punish) 

My ruin shorts = $70

I left the restaurant empty stomach with a $96 bill and shorts that will be going to garbage."}
{"text":"Terrible Servers: Did not check up on us the entire time, forgot about any request we've asked for ex. Maple sauce, napkins and ketchup, and wasn't friendly. 

Wait time: We ordered our food and had to wait 40 mins, the server did not acknowledge, update us or seem apologetic. 

Food: spent $85 on food for 4 people. Food was cold, dry and just not made properly. I had steak and eggs and it came with home salad so I asked for Greek salad but she said that request meant only Greek sauce on house salad.... 

There are plenty of places to eat at. This shouldn't be your first choice!"}
{"text":"Location/Service:

Located on Weston, just a couple blocks from the 401. It is tucked in the corner next to a glasses place. The private parking lot is at the back and so you have to walk to the front to get to the restaurant. 

I have always wanted to check out this franchise breakfast joint and decided to come to this location since a couple of us were near by. We got there at 10:30am on a friday morning during 2 days before the new year and the place was busy! There wasn't really a line up, just almost every table was filled. While I was perusing through the menu, I can see that the staff there work really fast so the turnover is quite fast. A waiter came over to our table not long later asking if we wanted to start off with some drinks and most of us got coffee (~$2.25 bottomless) and then we proceeded to looking at the menu again. 7 minutes later, the waiter came over and quickly got our orders down. 

Food:
There was just a lot of choices to choose from, but in the end, I got the 'Sunset Super' for $7.99 + tax. It came with 3 eggs (style of my choice), 2 pancakes and home fries. I asked for poached eggs and it was way too hard for my liking. Next time I should tell them to make it soft poached because I like my eggs a little runny. As for the pancakes, it was the WORST pancakes I have ever hard. It was TOO hard and not fluffy. It was tasteless, or more like the taste of FLOUR. It was really gross and even maple syrup didn't help it. I couldn't finish pancakes as they were just awful :( The home fries were okay, but I have definitely tasted better.
The staff there came over periodically to refill our coffees so that was nice. 

TIP: They have a breakfast special (3 eggs, toast and home fries) for $4.99 + tax Monday through Friday if you order before 11am. I should have ordered this instead to avoid the awful taste of the pancakes. 

Not sure if it is just this location, but I might try other locations to see if the food quality is the same."}
{"text":"I had lunch today at the Sunset Grill Restaurant.

I felt like having breakfast for lunch so ordered 3 eggs (over easy) with peameal bacon, white toast and a glass of milk.  There was a lot of food and it was good!  I ate the eggs and meat, some of the fries and a couple pieces of toast.  I'd get it again!
 
Sahara was my server.  She was quite busy but she was extremely friendly and took excellent care of me."}
{"text":"Just had a late breakfast here and everything was amazing!! The service was quick, the food was hot and taste delicious!! We both ordered the turkey bacon with three eggs and home fries. We also had a bagel and blueberry pancakes. Needless to say we left full! Every single item was cooked perfectly and I would definitely recommend coming to check them out! The prices here are also on the low side for the city. We paid $45 CA for 2 big orders. Check them out while in Toronto!!"}
{"text":"Mothers Say Brunch expected to have a long wait. 30 minutes we were seated. Food is simple and wholesome. Our waitress was very nice . Our coffee cup was always kept full with a continuous round of fresh coffee. 
Unfortunately for me I felt the atmosphere was too rushed, and the seating too tight. Will go back as food was good."}
{"text":"Worst breakfast ever. I ordered poached eggs and sausage. The eggs were full of water and when I had my first bite I crunched into a shell. That grossed me out. They exchanged to scrambled egg, which was full of oil. The side of potatoes were dry. Not one of my better breakfast.  I give one star only because our server was very nice."}
{"text":"Even though this place was very small, busy and crowded, they found a clean and pleasant table for me to sit by myself. The very affable and attractive waiter was most efficient and polite, bringing me a glass of ice water and menu, quickly followed by a generous portion of Eggs Benny (3 eggs!). The waiter was attentive, despite being quite busy. My only complaint was that he didn't mention the specials, I would have ordered the Eggs Benny with salmon had I known. But the food and service was so lovely that he got a good tip anyways!"}
{"text":"Saturday at 945am and we were seated quickly as the resto was 3/4 full. Our server was pleasant and the  pace of the coffee refills was excellent!  We had this chain in Toronto and so happy they have opened up here. It's a cozy, rustic country place tucked behind a London Drugs and adjacent to Walmart. We didn't  even know this place existed as the sign is not obvious from a major road. 

Our food came quickly and apologies for not taking pics fellow Yelpers!  Hubby had a traditional breakfast with 3 eggs, toast, sausage and potatoes. Portions are huge. They advertise that \"small\" eggs are used but they're not small...I'd be curious to know what their source deems as large eggs!!! I had a pea meal bacon benny with potatoes and hollandaise on the side. My bacon had a nice grilled crust and the sauce was a perfect consistency and without that nasty onion flavour that many packaged hollandaise sauces have!  Our son had corned beef hash which came out finely chopped with wee bits of sautéed onions to bring out the flavour. And it was not super salty, bonus!!! It came with 3 scrambled eggs and potatoes. All our dishes tasted great! Of course you can choose your eggs over easy, sunny side etc. 

We had an excellent first experience here and will be sure to return and try other items!"}
{"text":"I have been to other Sunset Grills so this one was a little disappointing because the service was so slow. eg. We waited 10 minutes just for the bill. The food and everything else was the same level of quality, but ordering the food, receiving the food and then the extraordinary long wait for the bill was all significantly longer than normal on multiple occasions visiting this location. I would still keep going there, but don't expect any prompt service."}
{"text":"Okay, I really wanted to like this place because I'm a big fan of Sunset Grill generally, but we just didn't like it. You really shouldn't be able to do much wrong with breakfast but if you can't cook something, just don't. We're here on a Sunday morning so maybe the weekday crowd is different but, wow. Everything looked pale and unappetizing but was \"just okay\" to eat except my eggs Bennie, which were hard cooked and dry with very little hollandaise. The waitress replaced it quickly but the potatoes were still pasty and the eggs now erred on the undercooked side. Just kind of sad. We were finally waved up to the cash (from across the restaurant) without being given our check to review. It was a very disappointing experience. Our biggest test is always whether we'll go back. Other people seemed content but we aren't likely to return."}
{"text":"We are regulars at this location and have yet to be disappointed. Crispy bacon, nicely cookèd eggs, well done corned beef hash - always fast service. They also carry gluten-free bread, which is a huge plus because of a wheat intolerance. Servers are always friendly and efficient, and a shout out to the bus staff who are so careful with clean-up and little details. Always a great experience."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast today. I ordered the corn beef hash. The hash didn't really taste like corn beef or potatoes, but definitely wasn't horrible. The breakfast potatoes that come with it are a bit undercooked and would probably be better if they were deep fried.

The waitress was kinda sketchy, i flagged her down to order a tea and she did a double take look at me and walked away to clear a table and the place wasn't even packed like there was anyone waiting for one.

Probably wouldn't bother going back to any sunset grill again. And what the heck is with the $5.99 charge for 4 pieces of turkey bacon???"}
{"text":"We ate here on a Friday morning. Service was good (hence the 1 star) but the food was subpar. French toast was made with what looked like wonderbread. Bacon was neither crispy nor slimey but to me tasted like spam. My husband did not like the home fries but he's picky, I didn't mind them. Coffee was not that great either. I've been to the sunset grill in Ajax and from what I remember the experience/food was good. Unfortunately, we will not return to this location."}
{"text":"The time before last that we ordered delivery from here, it took them more than an hour to get here. When the delivery girl arrived we asked if the food had been sitting in the car that long (it was a 110 degree day), she said she did do some other deliveries but the food should be fine. We took her word for it but shouldn't have. I ordered egg salad and it was really warm and my french fries were cold and soggy. Took one bite to realize before I threw it all away. 

We decided to give them another try today. They got here in a timely manner, probably about 30 minutes. I opened my container. Being the picky eater I am, I started to take off the lettuce and tomato before taking a bite, good thing because if not I probably wouldn't have noticed the hair in my egg salad until it was in my mouth! Ugh! Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Friendly service and your order does come quickly but it will be totally unremarkable. Still searching for somewhere to go on Holiday Mondays when Kravingz is closed."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast.  Yummy Blueberry pancakes and great coffee.  Have been to other locations and this one is the tops!"}
{"text":"Our neighborhood is growing in leaps and bounds, guess it was only a matter of time when new breakfast / lunch places would pop up.  Since its been a few weeks since I went here, this review is stale, however do remember the ambiance to be bright and cheery, Sunday morning brunch was packed with local folks from the nearby condos, and service was good.  I hope to provide a better review of the food after my next visit, therefore am ok with a 3 star rating for now."}
{"text":"Definitely a decent, clean, quick normal place with friendly staff and good food. My wife and I went into a building close by for a quick meeting, and this was a good quick after meeting restaurant to go to for brekky."}
{"text":"Great breakfast food at good prices with fast service. The bacon was especially good. I think some of the previous reviewers expectations are unrealistic. This isn't meant to be a high-end place. It is like a Denny's but better quality."}
{"text":"Perfect place for an affordable, delicious breakfast. Large portions, good atmosphere and great service. Very pleased with this experience! Will definitely come back next time im in Toronto."}
{"text":"As far as breakfast goes this place receives five stars for service, good coffee and great food.  Service was with a warm friendly smile and they took the time to answer all my questions.  Made many changes to the menu to accommodate my order.  Peameal bacon was very good for the first time to ever have it.  Breakfast potatoes where not out of a frozen bag and deep fried.  They don't even have a deep fry machine.  All the food is cooked in front of your eyes.

Awesome breakfast and I will be ace tomorrow."}
{"text":"This place is a well oiled breakfast machine.

Expect a line on the weekends. This is a basic breakfast diner. Nothing fancy, but you'll get decent breakfast food at a decent price."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 4 stars.  I don't care about the other 2 people that gave it 3 stars.  

I was walking around downtown Toronto Labor Day morning in search of a cafe with wifi.  Sadly, this proved to be difficult, as the city seemed dead.  I was still hopeful, but then pangs of hunger started to affect my vision.  I was clawing at the sides of the buildings with the cafes that were closed.  I happened to turn my head to the left while on Victoria Street (heading north), when I saw a mass of people outside this establishment.  I trotted over (jaywalked too!), and put my name in for 1.  I was seated quickly.  I looked over the smallish menu, and decided on the \"French Connection.\"  Just coming ffrom Montreal, I thought this was fit, but in reality, I just wanted some French Toast with my eggs and bacon.  

The drinks came with the meal (which I didn't care, some like it prior; also it was really busy), and it was very amazingly delicious.  I had trouble typing it because I thought about the food as if I were eating it now.  5 strips of bacon, 2 scrambled eggs, a side of home fries, and 2 slices of French Toast.  I was in heaven.  

Maybe it was because I was hungrier than I have ever been (slight exaggeration?), maybe it was that there was no wifi and I couldn't distract myself from the taste, but it was good, and I ate it all.  

For some reason, the food in Canada isn't cheap, I spent $17 Canadian here ($12 food, $5 tip [lot of tip, but what's the point of leaving 3 bucks?]).  Usually this meal would've cost about $8 US.  Whatever, I was happy, and the walk back to my hotel room was like walking in air."}
{"text":"Today, I was there and it was not a good experience. Potatoes smell like rotten and coffee cup smell fish!! I let them know about that, the guy reacted very normal. To me it sounds like happening many times and they kind of used to it. Never come back to this location."}
{"text":"This is an okay place for breakfast or lunch. Not great, not horrible, just okay. 

We both had the Greek omelette with home fries and it was pretty good, though quite greasy. Coffee here is absolutely dreadful though and that's unacceptable at a breakfast & brunch place. We were here on a Monday afternoon and only 3 tables were occupied but it took a really long time to get our food.

I won't necessarily make plans to get back here but I also won't throw a temper tantrum if I have to eat here again.

{"text":"A landmark breakfast location in Ajax. No frills quality food breakfast place with lots of coffee. Usually packed weekend mornings and only accepts cash. Plenty of good food at a cheap price."}
{"text":"Just happened to stumble upon this place since it was right next to our hotel, I really enjoyed my breakfast here.  I'm a simple girl and breakfast doesn't have to be all fancy to be enjoyable.  I had a waffle with eggs and it was just that simple, but rewarding.  The waffle was hot and the batter was good with the Canadian maple syrup.  Eggs were good as scrambled eggs can be.  Everything came out hot and it tasted good which is what is important to me.  I'd come back here."}
{"text":"Horrible service the employees give sass and they kicked my family out of our table for an other family.  I am pissed off that that bitch kicked us out. My brother has autism and we needed a extra chair. AND LOOKED WHO FUCKING SHOW UP?!?! Sass ass (the employee that was a bitch) she said to my mom: \"sorry honey you can't put a chair here\" so we went to a different place. Don't go here it is BAD and I don't plan to go there again. I wish they were shut down"}
{"text":"Nice spot on Yonge Street/Richmond to pick up all day breakfast.

Came in about 10:30 in the morning, my friend wanted to order a beer but was told beer couldn't be purchased until 11, she than began to ask the waitress every time she came by if it was 11 yet.

Speaking of the waitress, she was friendly and accommodating, service was good.

Food was good, basic breakfast fare but there were also non breakfast items.  I had the 3 pancake dish, definitely enough, no need to get the 5 pancake option, 3 was more than enough to fill me up. Pancakes were fluffy and tasty.

Also had a side of sausage that was well cooked and delicious.

One friend had a burger that she thought was good and the other had the sunset sandwich special, that features Canadian bacon, egg and cheddar cheese, she too said it was delicious.

All in all a good meal at a low price, worth a visit if you're in Toronto."}
{"text":"Decent food, classic diner atmosphere, very bustling."}
{"text":"We ordered 2 piece french toast, the vegetable omelette and 3 eggs with no meat. 

It took about 10 minutes before the food came. The server checked on us once. 

I discovered pieces of ham in my vegetable omelette, and I informed the server. She took it to her manager , and came back with 'We will not do anything about it. There is no way we would put ham in it.'  No empathy or sorry, no basic customer service was demonstrated. 

If you have a food restriction due to dietary or religious beliefs. Be cautious!!"}
{"text":"I have been visiting this place with friends and family every once and awhile over a period of about 6 months. It's a solid 3 star place. You'll never come away with your socks knocked off, but for the price and chain-ness of Sunset Grill, you'll be satisfied.

I've never run into any of the atrocious service that other reviewers have mentioned. While my servers generally range between 'fine' and 'good' in terms of friendliness, they're still adept at taking my order quickly and keeping the coffee filled. 

The food is pretty decent (although not going to blow your mind) and it's served surprisingy quickly. Not in a did-that-just-come-out-the-microwave way but because the cooks are good at what they do.

I'm giving this four stars because for what it is (a mid-range breakfast chain) it delivers well."}
{"text":"Definitely a positive change with the new management in charge with more friendly and much faster service. 

The staff is more courteous and the manager/owners are right in the there pitching in with the service to make sure you're take care of.  Sunday crowds are always busy but the turn around on tables seems to be moving at a faster pace.

The overall atmosphere is lighter and the food is very consistent for breakfast/brunch.

Location is still great and parking is sometimes a challenge but the experience will not disappoint.

Keep the coffee flowing - we will be visiting a lot more often."}
{"text":"Good spot for affordable, filling breakfast or lunch. Lots of tables, good variety on the menu and fast service. Simple but satisfying. Near Bloor Station so easy to get there."}
{"text":"I didn't find the food amazing, the flavour was quite simple. The omelete was huge but honestly didn't enjoyed. The steak was good though. The staff was friendly."}
{"text":"This place has become somewhat of a monthly visit for us. The food is reasonably priced, comes fast and the portion sizes are good. They make a great tuna sandwich, which I always order. It comes with hashbrowns and a few veggie sticks with dip. Their gluten free bread tastes great and their tuna salad is excellent. I never thought I would be the kind of person that eats tuna at a brunch place, but pregnancy does strange things to you. My husband always gets the steak and eggs and always enjoys it. 
There is often a wait depending on what time you go, but you won't wait long to be seated anyways. I think the longest we've had to wait is 10 minutes and the food literally comes 10-15 minutes after ordering. Great place to stop by for a cheap, casual breakfast. We usually pay under $35 to eat there and leave full."}
{"text":"Love this place! In terms of breakfast, it's probably hands down the best place to go. The food is always delicious, the wait staff has always been attentive, and the food is NEVER greasy! Win! I've been to other breakfast joints and always found the food to be too greasy in general, leaving me with a bad stomach ache after. 

I'm also a tea addict so free refills=major win of life, basically, which this place does :). I've been here a few times and would recommend it a thousand times over Cora's, which I find overpriced and the food meh. 

Port Credit is also a beautiful area so I mean... Great food and beautiful view? Why wouldn't someone want to eat here? Next time you're craving breakfast food, hit up Sunset Grill!"}
{"text":"I've been to this sunset twice in the last month or so with my friend after we've finished yoga. We usually arrive just before lunch and its not too busy for a Saturday morning. The service here is pretty prompt, but nothing special. 

The food is good and standard for sunset grill fare. The hashbrowns are always under cooked and not brown and crispy enough so be sure to ask for them well done. I've had the \"healthy\" breakfast sandwich, which had spinach, egg whites and cheese, which was good, and a regular breakfast sandwich, with bacon, cheese and a fried egg. Both were good but both tended to fall apart as I ate them and became a mess.

Not much else to say since its a typical sunset grill. Nothing will amaze you but its some nice, standard breakfast fare at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Greasy spoons hurrah!!!

If you want a yummy grill style breakfast without the inflated prices of Golden Griddle and the shitty service you get there, Sunset Grill is a good one to add to your list.

As others have stated, this place is usually busy and for good reason so get there early or be prepared to wait for a table. If you're in the mood to meander and chat and have a two-hour breakfast, go to Cora's. This is the kind of place you come to when you have a hankering for pancakes, eggs, sausages, bacon and toast and you want it NOW.

I've rarely had bad service here but that's not to say service is fantastic either. But really who are we kidding? I come for the food!

I've had the grilled cheese, one of the breakfast plates, the tuna melt and pancakes over the years and none of them have disappointed. Other than that, there isnt much more to say! Simple food, done to order and it'll fill your belly up :)"}
{"text":"I had a craving for Sunset Grill last week and in the past, I have never been disappointed with this choice until last Friday. The server was not pleased to see me as it was 3 and the place closes at 4. I understand that part. My biggest complaint and of which warranted this low rating is that the pancakes I ordered were disgusting - hard on top, obviously old and tasteless. What a disappointment. I will not return to this location."}
{"text":"Ohh just writing this review makes me want to this place again. I  think this is the best breakfast place I've been and for a while there, I was eatin' a lot a brunches. Breakfast is not my fav meal but this place is both big and cozy at the same time. It's got a great family feel and food is hearty."}
{"text":"Pretty good. It was the shortest walk from our hotel that was still serving breakfast at noon. I liked the potatoes. Not crazy about the ham. Delicious bagel and cream cheese. Eggs were, well, eggs. Oh, and chocolate milk :-)"}
{"text":"The food was great, service was a bit slow.  I'm starting to find that all these breakfast places are getting a bit too expensive to go."}
{"text":"Well, you can't get much better than this location. Watching sunsets over the lake is one of the best things in Cleveland.

But don't go here for the food. You'll get in a line to order food, wait 10 minutes, and then be told you need to be at a table to order food. But lo'! There are no tables to be had. You'll go inside and ask at the bar about food. They'll tell you order at outside bar. What! So you wander back to the bar and figure out there is one particular line that you wait in to order food. Wait another 10 minutes. Order. Stand at the bar for 20 minutes while you friends are having fun by the water. Get told  they are out of what you ordered and take whatever they give you that takes the least amount of time because you are about to freak OUT.

Stick to drinks."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Sunset Grill, especially their location in The Beaches.  We came to Toronto the other day without knowing that the subway line was down, which forced us to stay in the downtown core.  Luckily we spotted a Sunset Grill right away and we went their without hesitation.  It was a Sunday morning so we expected it to be busy.  We got seated almost right away, I give their host props, he was very efficient.  Sunset grill has a breakfast special during the week,  but since we were there on the weekend, the special is a few dollars more.  We each ordered the 3 egg special with bacon and potatoes for $6.95.  The potatoes were hot and well seasoned, the bacon was plentiful but a tad salty and the eggs and toast were great.  Our server was very informative and genuine.  I would definitely come back the next time i am in Toronto."}
{"text":"This is the place to go if u are in the mood for a true classic dinner breakfast.  The restaurant is on the small side, sit near the back, there is seating near the grill but it gets very hot there.  Our waitress was funny, even though she was serving half the restaurant she was friendly to everyone.  The coffee is hot, and every sight of an empty mug she comes right over and tops you up.  I had the classic breakfast consisting of 3 eggs bacon toast and homefries.  Considering their location they could really up the price but they keep it reasonable, 6.95 on the weekends.  i definetely reccomend the sunset grill."}
{"text":"The quantity of the food is big, we ordered 2 omelette, really good.. the egg tastes really fresh.. the house fries are not over fries, and very good also.. the toast is a little over do. But that's fine.. will come back if I come back to Aurora again.."}
{"text":"I think this place is worth 4 stars because the service and food quality was on par.

I usually order the Sunset Super (in photo) which comes with 3 eggs, 4 sausages (or ham or bacon), home fries and two pancakes and boy is it filling.

The food quality every time ive been here was 9/10.

Service was a 7/10. I wish they just come and check up on you a little bit more. You also have to pay for your bill at the front and not with your server.

Lastly, the only reason i did not give a 5/5 is because they dont have any earl bird specials or specials like their competitions. 

You'll see me here more often with an early bird special, Sunset Grill!!"}
{"text":"I ordered eggs florentine and they tasted like poison, like burnt plastic or mothballs or something. It was the spinach because my friend's eggs sunset were fine. I've been to the Whitby location and it's good as far as prepackaged breakfast goes. Something went terribly wrong at this location when I went. I would definitely say it's a safety hazard because that's not the way spinach is supposed to taste--did they forget to take it out of the bag before they cooked it?!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast place great service friendly staff and good pricing. They serve fresh squeezed orange juice and a variety of different things to eat. They do have take out in case you can't wait, be prepared to wait in line for a seat cause this place is always packed. It is totally worth the wait"}
{"text":"Always friendly and the food is consistently good. Great place to get away from the office for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"As someone who has worked in the restaurant and service industry, I know that one of the most important parts of your restaurant is the bathroom. It's the first thing you check when you open and last thing you check before you go home. 

Went to this place to have breakfast with my friend and had to go to the bathroom. And I realized there are no papers after I entered the bathroom!!!!! Feeling extremely disgusted I walk to the server and she says \"whatsup\"!! And when I tell her that there are no sort of paper towels in the bathroom, she hands me a roll and tells me I have to take it to the bathroom since she \" CANT\" walk into the men's washroom!! Do you also want me to wash your dishes? Or clean the kitchen as well?

Unprofessional staff! Unprofessional practice!"}
{"text":"Had a great breakfast here. I can definitely see how it could get easily packed given the small space, but ill base this review more heavily on the food and service.

First off id like to give these folks some recognition for their homefries...they got it right as far as im concerned!! The pieces of potato are soft and well seasoned and I love the bits of crunchy pieces mixed in- makes it all the more interesting.

Eggs are not easy to screw up so...they didnt screw those up. A perfectly runny over easy is my go to. 

And the sausages, though appearing burned, dod not taste bad at all. They had the perfect bite to them. Not too soggy/floppy and not too hard. 

Oh, and I had pancakes too (these choices are whats causong my belly to grow) But anyways, they were good pancakes. Fluffy, not dry and crumbly. Overall good. However, my favourite pancakes definitely remains as eggsmarts. I like how soft they are at eggsmart, and the splash of vanilla makes them taste like pancake minus the pan. 

Prices are good too at sunset. The option I chose (top left of menu I believe) was $11.99 and included homefries, 3 eggs, choice of meat (either 4 sausages, 5 bacon, or 2 of each) and 2 pancakes. In other words, more than enough food."}
{"text":"Above average food with some creativity in pancakes: apple cinnamon pancakes or chocolate chip for the kids -- which are huge by the way, so younger kids should share a plate.  The waitress was good enough to point this out.  The friendly waitresses here are what really make this place great."}
{"text":"Came here during lunch hour. Restaurant wasn't particular busy. They had two servers and three cooks in the kitchen. but food wasn't ready until after waiting about 25 minutes. We ordered a sunset burger and a sunset sandwich. We had to get everything to go. Food ended up being delicious and they packed all the condiments. I just don't recommend anyone coming during office lunch hour. They do have a cute kid (maybe about 6 years old) working beside the coffee machine, just drying the cutleries."}
{"text":"Owner seems to be a good dude. Food was classic breakfast food. It was pretty much out of a movie. Quaint little grease spoon type place"}
{"text":"Sunset Grill never disappoints this awesome breakfast comes with choice of bacon or ham, or sausage & three eggs and of course a side of pancake for the likes lol . Service was good, they came and refilled my coffee twice which is always great. Eggs were cooked perfectly and couldn't be happier."}
{"text":"Several months ago, my team at work was eating at Nando's, which is across from Sunset Grill. I was talking to a colleague and indicated that I have never been to a Sunset Grill in my life. She told me that the one closest to her home was really good, and that she and her husband go there regularly.

Our team at work goes out for lunch every Friday. I had made the suggestion to go here in November. Unfortunately, I couldn't attend.

Yesterday, I was in the area. It was 13:00 and I was hungry. I decided to give Sunset Grill a shot.

I walked in and there was a family in front of the please-wait-to-be-seated area. I didn't know what to make of the place until the family decided to clear out. 

I was promptly greeted. He asked whether I wanted the table that was just in front of the cash area. I asked for a table further down, mainly because I didn't want to be in front of the doors opening and closing, and my ultimately freezing.

My table was in front of the cooking area. It's not a bad thing to see three happy chefs work and joke with one another. It is oddly a pretty quiet area.

I was greeted by Lisa, who was friendly, accommodating, and talks as swiftly as she works. I asked for a Diet Coke. She asked me whether I wanted a glass with ice. Sure!

She came back and I placed my order. I love French toast and pancakes. My toughest decision is to decide which one. I went with the former and asked for three slices. Done! I also wanted a side order of sausages. She entered everything on her handy iPad mini. She also mentioned that my order wouldn't take too long to make, which was nice.

She brought my Diet Coke in a can, glass containing ice, and maple syrup to my table. I enjoyed my drink while waiting for my meal.

My French toast and sausage came. Yay!

For the longest time, I have been going to Wimpy's Diner for my occasional French toast fix. After having such scrumptious French toast here that used thick slices of Texas toast, what was I thinking back then?! So good!

The best part? The maple syrup served is thick. You pour it on your French toast and it takes its time. When it's finally on your toast, it sits there and doesn't want to budge until you cut into your food. That's the consistency of maple syrup that i have missed. It's not like that runny cheap stuff that you typically get that looks like sugary water.

The sausages were yummy. You get four of them. This place doesn't skimp.

Lisa came by to pick up my empty plates and provide me with the bill. She provided friendly, fast, efficient service. We wished each other a happy 2018.

I went to the cash area to pay for my bill. The place allows you to pay by cash, or you can use your Visa or Mastercard.

These breakfast-lunch places tend to close by 15:00. I am glad that I made it in time to give this place a try. I'll be back to give the pancakes a go!

{"text":"Was craving a burger one afternoon so hubby & I went to Sunset Grill as he'd been there before. The burger was decent, though the bun started falling apart. The homefries that came with the burger weren't too impressive as some of them were burnt. Hubby says that's the way they're supposed to be but I don't like any of my food burnt! Anyway, I'm not sure I would come here again. It's a pretty small place that looks like it needs a reno. The walls are kind of grubby, furniture & decor looks outdated. The nicest thing about the place was our waitress! Call me a snob but I like a place that sweeps the food off the floor before the next customers arrive."}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice, gotton coffee here every day this week and I can say, super nice people work here, the food is pretty good for a quick meal. The coffee is, well, coffee. I had the Blackened Chicken Chipotle Wrap with fries for $6.25. It was really good. The second trip i ordered the Chicken Caesar Wrap with potato salad which came  in a distant second to the Chipotle Wrap, but still tasty. nothing fancy but i would go back next time im here at the Las Vegas office and in need for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Awesome weekend specials were awesome! Texas omelette - corned beef, peppers, onions with hash potatoes, and toast! The specials also comes with coffee or tea! The only thing that was missing was cheese in the omelette!"}
{"text":"I love this place, it's cheap and cheerful. The service is friendly, fast and efficient.
Never had a problem being seated within 10 minutes even on a busy weekend. My only complaint would be that when sitting inside, I always come out smelling like bacon grease... though I'm sure that is a very sexy scent to my husband, I would love if there was better ventilation."}
{"text":"We hit Sunset today for our hangover breakfast and it hit the spot. 

I could just as easily have given Sunset 4 stars but being from NJ which is basically the diner capitol of the world I couldn't justify the \"Yay\" rating. However that being said, our breakfast was very good. I went for the French connection which came with french toast, eggs, home fries, and sausage. French toast was bangin, and the sausage was better than expected as well. 

The dining area is open and airy with a view of the kitchen in back. Big windows in front make for some good people watching as well."}
{"text":"Very friendly and kind service which is always nice to get early in the morning. No specialty coffee (simple filter only) which is not good at all, at least for me. The food is OK. I do like their Salmon Benedict though, they do it with 3 eggs instead of the usual 2 and its pretty tasty. If you're in the area check this place out, but i wouldn't drive more than 5 min to eat there :)"}
{"text":"Seat yourself, I hate joints like that.... most of the time when you're solo you'll fly under the radar and won't be tended to, or maybe it's a sunset grill thing, sit yourself and we'll see you, eventually.

Once someone did swing by they asked if I was ready to order. Again, maybe I'm atypical but I like to get my coffee and then peruse the menu... usually just looking at pictures and looking at what I'll get next time... but sitting, sipping and reading....

I asked for coffee and when it arrived again asked if I knew what I wanted... shoot, if you say me down and asked for my drink we wouldn't be in this groundhog perpetual state asking if I knew what I wanted...

This place is a 2 overall but the food was good enough to pick it up a star.

Greek salad, dressing on the side, love it! Portion size large was Caiptal L arge. Not sure about \"fresh\" but definitely cool crisp and yummy.

Omelette was really good..... and the coffee, I do regular and most of the time when you add cream and sugar your a coffee heretic, and I agree, but this place had hot and none watered down coffee. It was good..

I might go for a coffee or a meal to go, but I'm put off by the seat myself, go pay at cash, little quirks that led to more deficiencies in my experience.

As a takeout I'd give it a 4."}
{"text":"This place is cozy and family friendly. The food was excellent, fresh not greasy. But our order did take a very long time. I understand it's busy, but breakfast shouldn't take over 25 minutes to prepare. 
However, I'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"I ordered a breakfast sandwich (peameal, egg, cheese on white bread) came with potatoes and veggies. My bf ordered the blueberry pancakes. The sandwich was delicious! The potatoes could have been seasoned a bit more. The pancakes were really good! They didn't use the artificial blueberry pancake batter mix. 
The service is really fast. We got our food within 5-6 mins of ordering! Would come back"}
{"text":"This place is hands down the worst breakfast place in the metropolitan area, the food taste like \"grool\" with ketchup. I don't know why the Toronto Star hasn't reviewed this hole and exposed these people for the awful service they provide. The manager should be brought up on charges for being a douche"}
{"text":"I like the novelty to eating all-day breakfast on a weekday afternoon if only to fool myself into thinking it's weekend brunch and I don't have to go back to work after all.  *sigh*

Met a friend for lunch and ordered 2 breakfasts with bacon, toast, 3 over easy eggs and hashbrowns ($6.99 each).  Food came to the table amazingly quick.

Breakfast was good, nothing outstanding but then again, it's pretty hard to screw up eggs.

Service was friendly.  We were in and out in less than 30 minutes which is great for a quick lunch.

The only downside - Having to spend the rest of the afternoon in back to back meetings at work."}
{"text":"Too loud. Food is stale (got a bagel with mold). I'd say, eat someplace else."}
{"text":"Average experience. The atmosphere of the restaurant isn't pleasant due to the high exposed ceilings that seem to amplify the sound of everything from crying babies to the crashing of pots and pans from the kitchen. 

My Great Canadian omelet was all right but the amount of greasy cheese was overwhelming and the bacon inside of it wasn't crispy as I would expect it to be. The bread was fresh but my fried potatoes had green and rotten parts in them that I had to put on a side plate. You'd expect the cooks not to serve those to customers. My husband left behind most of his bacon and fried potatoes as he said they just weren't good. 

The waitress was friendly but very distracted. I'd rather drive further down St Clair to Boom for better quality food and service."}
{"text":"Cheap and cheerful, diner-style breakfast/brunch (also lunch) restaurant. Food is good, service is great. Real Yonge and Eg neighborhood spot. Can get line-ups out the door on weekends for brunch."}
{"text":"Came here for a late Saturday brunch (1 PM) and the place was half empty.  floor was greasy with bits of food scattered around. We stood around our table for a few minutes waiting for someone to come by and clean up the floor but were ignored so they finally grabbed a mop and wiped the floor up myself.  

Service was slow despite being half empty.  Pancakes were rubbery.   Bacon was cooked properly.  Waffles tasted like LaQuinta Hotel waffles (we are from the southwest).   That's not a complement (at least the ones are LaQuinta are free).  Would not recommend."}
{"text":"It's a classic diner with a focus on all day breakfast--what's not to love?  Yes of course they could probably do a few more healthy breakfast options.  And yes, the portion sizes are, well, very American.  But on those mornings when you have already decided to splurge a little why not Sunset Grill?"}
{"text":"The location is good to me. The food is good as other Sunset. I like the coffee especially. Somehow I don't feel the waitress is friendly. Maybe they didn't want my mother and I took the upper level tables at lunch time. It's not a good experience as I had in other Sunset."}
{"text":"Part of a chain with several locations in the area, this is a good place for breakfast. The food is good, the service is efficient and the atmosphere is pleasantly sedate, which I appreciate in the morning. The prices are reasonable and I would consider them standard for a restaurant of this type.

The morning menu here features standard North American breakfast fare. My colleague and I both had the Mediterranean Omelette which included spinach, tomato and feta cheese. It was accompanied by tasty home fries and toast. I have to mention that our server was particularly good and was quite adept at her job. This added positively to our experience there. The prices were what I would expect for this type of restaurant. With a coffee to drink, the total bill with tip was $32.96 CAD, which was not unreasonable. I would not hesitate to recommend this establishment for breakfast if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Food was delivered quickly, very small portion of hash browns but tasty. Waitress was totally  inattentive, did not check in and I had to flag her down to ask for a coffee refill which she then forgot. Apparently chatting with her coworkers was more important that her tables, it was not very crowded!

Unlikely to return to this location"}
{"text":"This place is ok, you get what you pay for.

If you eat just bacon and eggs than this is your place, anything else outside of that realm it's not great at all.

I've found their feta and yogurt to be gross, almost as if it's turning"}
{"text":"I was their for team meeting.  My usual habit is to order Benedict in every brunch place so I can compare but this is is just the most disappointed of all.  For those who have not try egg Benedict; the egg should be pouch. The eggs were here is actually fried .... I should say overeasy egg.....I used to go to other sunset grill location but it wasn't bad at all.  I won't get it there anymore."}
{"text":"i go here every so often with my sister for breakfast. ok service, decent food.. although i usually just get fruits and toast, my sister sure enjoys her breakfast most of the time.. she gets the normal (eggs, toast, sausage, bacon) etc."}

{"text":"Always a pleasure eating here, the staff is friendly, the food is good and the prices are so awesome for what you get! They are always adding awesome new things to the menu and the food is consistently good. Never had an issue. My family comes to this location almost every weekend and the staff remember us well. The tables are always full or near it, so get in early or call ahead!"}
{"text":"I ordered the eggs florentine and it was okay, despite the two hairs I found. It was extremely busy and crowded, our table got bumped a lot and my best friend's home fries were ice cold. The tea was good though. And the water didn't taste like toilet water."}
{"text":"It's not wow. It is a very basic brunch! The potato was not that good! The egg white was a little raw!"}
{"text":"The hubby and I were looking for a breakfast spot that would be filling and cheap. There was a short 10 minute wait to get in but it was totally worth it. I ordered the French breakfast which consisted of two pieces of French toast, two eggs, home style potatoes, and FIVE pieces of bacon. My husband had the samebut no French toast just regular wheat toast and orange juice.  The totally was $20. I would highly recommend it. The service was great and quick. I do believe they offer maple syrup but for an additional $2."}
{"text":"So came to sunset grill in pickering I usually go in Richmond hill... I like my sandwiches with over easy egg and this supposed chef refused to do it, this is how I always order my sandwiches he refused so I paid for our drinks and left.... This gentleman who is the owner or chef... Whatever came over as I opened my mouth he just said no we can't do that... Great I didn't even want to give a star! Worst sunset grill experience ever!!!"}
{"text":"It's ok. The waitress was friendly and sweet. The rest of the staff didn't seem interested in being there at all. No smiles, no greetings - just straight robotic motions to take me to my seat, hand me a menu, and clean up nearby tables. Food was pretty ordinary. Standard breakfast fare that tastes pretty average. A little bit on the greasy side, but at least it's pretty cheap."}
{"text":"Another option for breakfast in my neighbourhood. My usual go to order is some sort of eggs Benedict. They don't do poached eggs here, but the over easy is more or less the same. Service was eggs-celent. Very friendly server. Good portions. I will be back."}
{"text":"I really need to stop coming here. Service is slow. Waiters seem to run around like chickens with their heads cut off."}
{"text":"Face pace, accurate, and friendly service with a .  Food taste great, I always love their \"French Connection\"...pretty awesome taste... gotta love those French Toast... extremely delicious."}
{"text":"Been here twice and the food was consistent and yummy! Fluffy pancakes, good home fries, and quick service. I removed a star because I think their drinks are overpriced. I like that you can see the action while you're waiting or eating your food.  They also have a large menu and can substitute a meat with turkey bacon, which I prefer. Great location at The Stockyards with ample parking and it gets busy but I haven't had to wait long during brunch times. They do takeout as well."}
{"text":"Started off the day with breakfast here. The coffee was pretty good and the server came around plenty of times throughout my stay to top it off. Excellent service! When deciding to order, the menu has no pictures but there are indicated favourites. I was in a mood for French toast so I got the French connection. Choice of ham, sausage, or bacon. I chose sausage and do not regret my choice. They were cooked perfectly and was not too fatty. The home fries however were mushy and unappealing. Eggs can only be scrambled, sunny side or over easy. They only serve thick sliced toast here which can be good or bad depending on preference. My friend got pancakes. I think the price point from regular pancakes ($5.99) to supreme pancakes ($11.99) was a bit high for whipped cream and strawberries. The food came out fast and overall we enjoyed our breakfast here. It is a bit cramped for seating though especially now with all the puffy winter coats. 3.5/5."}
{"text":"Typically a breakfast goer, this is perhaps one of the poorest breakfast spots in terms of the customer service I have ever experienced.

My girlfriend and I had breakfast at this place at 10 AM on Saturday evening. We called prior to our seating to ensure that we did not have to wait long as we were in a bit of a time bind.

We were seated at 10:20 and made it critical that we did not have a lot of time and that we had our orders ready. The waitress promptly took our order and we waited.

We waited a total of 40 minutes for our order to come out.

The waitress unpleasantly told us, \"I have the timer on your order and it says it has been 20 minutes, not half an hour.\" Considerably one of the worst experiences I've had. 

The food to go was good, unfortunately the experience left a bitter taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"A pretty solid place for western breakfast, allbeit a little expensive. It's about $80 for four people after tax and tips to have coffee, juice, and a full breakfast meal. I had tried their blueberry, breakfast sandwiches, etc. and it's pretty standard fare for a chain. 

I wouldn't go out of my way to go to a any Sunset Grill, but if you are in the neighbourhood and looking for some not-too greasy american breakfast (they only serve homefries and not fries etc.), you can probably pop by without being too disappointed."}
{"text":"Ordered the crab cake Benedict:

Eggs were cooked perfectly (over easy) 
Crab cakes (2) had more imitation crab meat & less real crab meat
The hollandaise sauce is excellent 
The potatoes were a little starchy. Could've used a bit more time on the skillet (I like mine a bit crispy)
I thought I would've gotten asparagus spears but instead got one asparagus sliced up (green round things that I thought were onions)"}
{"text":"We have been going to this location for years now. This is hands down the best place for breakfast. There is never a problem with our meals and the service is on point! Kudos to the owners who are always checking up on you and making sure your meal is never less than perfect and the staff who are quick, courteous and great at what they do."}
{"text":"Excellent service, happy chefs, yummy food. Sunset poutine was delicious. Home fries a little under done but real potatoes. Nicely busy, good atmosphere."}
{"text":"Sucks my burger was not cooked properly and they forgot the bacon and they brought it after and it was cold and charged me without a discount . I have been a de more times and there was always a problem with the food . I really enjoy other sunset grills but this location sucks big time avoid it at all costs ... Go to the others for much better food .. The one at major Mack much better  the best one in the city is at laird and Eglington"}
{"text":"This was one of my most satisfying lunch choices in a long time.
I ordered the Club, and it was PERFECT!
I decided to go with a ceasar on the side. (Also, a Great salad)
Everything was prepared perfectly."}
{"text":"Great service & good food. The servers were really friendly to my kids so we really enjoyed the environment. 
Pancakes were the best. It was fluffy & filling. I got the French Connection which had eggs, sausages, fries & French toast.  Yumm.  =)"}
{"text":"This place is a disaster.  You can't beat the fantastic location on Whiskey Island.  However, the service was incredibly slow, even though we could see at least 20 workers behind the counter, and many of them weren't working at all!  It wasn't clear where you should place your order, and we waited 20 minutes in various lines and it didn't seem like anyone was being served at all.  When we got to the front, the lady informed us that she couldn't take food orders; that was someone else's job, and we would have to wait.  We stuck with beers only, and aren't planning to go back unless they get their act together.  If you want to eat on Whiskey Island, BYO food instead of wasting your time and money at this place."}
{"text":"Good service, fast breakfast seems to be their specialty. Lots of options, I had the egg white omelette with toast and veggies and was surprisingly tasty. Looks like they had a break in the night before, odd for port credit but the front window was smashed, they still got their game together and were serving up a storm."}
{"text":"This is close to our place and our go to for brunch on the weekends. The food is pretty good and the service is good. They do get busy but after a short time wait you are seated. 

Good brunch place. Good food."}
{"text":"Breakfast/Brunch

This is a great place for that mom 'n pop type of feel for breakfast, The portions are great and the food tastes great. Their service can be a bit better but I like the food which is why they get the 4 stars. We have not had any bad experiences at this location.

Kudos! Hope this place keeps it up! It does get busy but there must be a reason why."}
{"text":"Man, I miss summer.  
This is one of the only places to sit and look at the lake in Cleveland.  So for that, 5 stars.  Location, Location, Location.

Big 24 oz beers and twisted teas are $5.  It's a bit more pricey but it is a seasonal place.  Food is okay.  Basic bar food, a couple of good menu items like the perch sandwich but nothing spectacular.  

Travel down on a nice night and grab a drink at a picnic table to watch the sunset.  Don't expect  a butler."}
{"text":"Conveniently located on Yonge St., this Sunset Grill location serves up the standard all day breakfast. Eggs, bacon, pancakes, prompt coffee refills etc. Service is friendly and the restaurant is pretty clean. My biggest pet peeve is the claustrophobic seating.  Saturday and Sunday mornings are a gong show. Throw in couple of rowdy kids and you start wishing you'd stayed in and scarfed down Cheerios instead."}
{"text":"First time trying sunset grill. The interior was decent, service was average. The food though... wasn't that great! 

I ordered the salmon egg benny $13.99 while my partner ordered  Sunset Super $10.99 (pancakes, eggs, sausages). We were happy with the salmon benny, it was tasty though note the salmon was cooked (not raw). 

But the pancakes - one of them was burnt! It was so hard to eat it. And the sausages were pretty burnt as well. I'm surprised they would serve the food in that condition. The homefries were decent but I think the presentation could be improved. 

We have definitely tried better places so we probably won't be coming back for now."}
{"text":"Slow service, noisy environment, pricey, so-so food. Need I say more?"}
{"text":"Was much better under the old owners. Many of the staff have changed since the owners sold this location to open up another location. The guy who takes your money at the cash is not at all friendly. Doesn't ask how your meal was or anything. I think he's one of the new owners. The use of iPads to take your order is ridiculous and takes too long. Much prefer going to Friends or Wally's on  Steeles now."}
{"text":"I honestly don't understand why anyone would come here. I've always been disappointed when I go to Sunset Grill locations, but I went today because a group of friends set up a lunch date. Last time I will ever dine at a Sunset Grill. Ever.

Food:
I'm pretty sure most of us could make better and cheaper breakfasts at home. I got sunny side up eggs with sausage, home fries and toast. The eggs and sausages tasted fine, but the sausages were so greasy I had trouble finishing them. My toast was burnt and my home fries was under cooked (tip: drowning these in ketchup doesn't help).

Service:
Upon walking into the doors, we were told to sit wherever. It took 20 minutes to get service, and that was because we flagged the server down. 
Service while we were eating was pretty much absent, I think the waitress checked up on us once for water.
Paying was the worst part. Our total bill was $49.66 for the four of us. I asked the cashier to split the bill and he said \"Ok, that's like $50, so it'll be $12.50 each\".
Last time I checked, that's NOT how you split a bill. He overcharged us as a whole then incorrectly charges us individually. Can someone audit this place?
We were pretty mad because he was being such a jerk, but did it anyways to get out of there. While each of us took turns with the debit/credit machine, he was loudly sighing and drumming on the counter with impatience. I'm sorry, are we bothering you? Because I'm pretty sure this is part of your damn job. UGH. So. Much. Frustration. 

I hate this place."}
{"text":"I'm usually not a fan of Sunset Grill, but this location was so fast and efficient for a Sunday morning. Despite the line, we only waited 10 minutes for a table and were in and out within the hour. 
The food was average for what you normally get, but they load your plate up with potatoes here so you won't leave hungry."}
{"text":"Came here because good fork had a half an hour wait and I was short on time. Mediocre breakfast, nothing special. Inattentive staff. Stood in the doorway watching the servers have a conversation for a good 5 minutes before I was acknowledged and seated. There's also the lingering smell of burnt food because of the open kitchen which can be unpleasant."}
{"text":"Again, not the Best Breakfast Place I've been to, but price wise it's reasonable and both times I went, Service was friendly and Helpful. Overall satisfied!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Great staff,  great service.  A little pricey for breakfast food,  but u get what u pay for."}
{"text":"I gave this new all-day breakfast place by my house a try this morning. The setup is nice. Everything has been completely renovated from the cafe that occupied the spot before. They have a healthy sized menu of your typical breakfast fair from the basic three egg meal, steak and eggs, omelettes, and waffles. They also have a small lunch menu with grilled cheese, burgers, and salads. 

I would rate the food at a solid three stars. There's nothing on the menu that makes it any better than the next breakfast place down the street. What made the difference here was the staff and the speed of service. I was greeted at the door, shown promptly where I could place my take-out order, and was gone in under 5 minutes. 

The gentleman I was speaking with, who I'm guessing was the franchisee, was very friendly and chatty with me while I was waiting. He was saying that they will have a patio in the summer which they hope to have up and running in April."}
{"text":"I got the salmon eggs sunset which is pretty much an eggs benedict and it was alright except the salmon was a little dry. The Hollandaise sauce is pretty thick and tasty. The 'home fries' are diced potatoes."}
{"text":"Was in the area and decided to have breakfast. The staff were always pleasant and helpful. Simple bacon and eggs, done the way I wanted it and nothing to fancy. 

We asked for what we wanted and got what we wanted. Thanks"}
{"text":"Construction in my building had me running for the hills of the yonge and eglinton junction this morning. 
Needed to grab breakfast before settling down to work somewhere peaceful. 

Ordered a cup of Joe, an OJ, and the three egg plus lose the toast) with a side of pancake.
The breakfast came with potatoes that were so undercooked they crunched, and not in that pleasant crispy way. 
The eggs were ok, over medium done right 
Sausages were salty and oily over processed little things. 
The coffee was so so, the juice tasted like terrible concentrate 
Lastly I had a side of pancakes and they were anything by fluffy. So in-fresh that they fell apart at every stab of the fork. 
Sigh. 
I can't recommend sunset in any way except maybe for fast and friendly service and moderate pricing 

I RECOMMEND- trying peameal bacon instead of sausage

EXTRA TIP- check the board at the front if the patio for deals"}
{"text":"Really? There is a small special page of Moksha Yoga Menu?

I guess I missed that and stick with my usual Western Sandwich: Egg, Onion and Pepper. Kind of like a breakfast but not a breakfast? sounded healthy but not really that healthy?

Service is decent and food is good

Bottomless coffee and greasy food.. my kind of place."}
{"text":"This Sunset Grill was packed on a Sunday afternoon. I was lucky enough to arrive before the rush, so I got seated right away. 

Services here was fast, efficient and friendly!

3 eggs over easy with Rye toasts ($5.49) and Sunset Waffle ($6.49) were both A-OK. Freshly prepared to order, so it might take awhile when the restaurant is busy.

Free WIFI and bottomless coffee ($1.89) always a nice touch!!"}
{"text":"Nothing beats a nice breakfast before going in to work! I got in at around 11am and got great service.

Pretty cool to get cheerful smiling servers that early in the morning.

Will definitely return"}
{"text":"The first time I came to Sunset Grill, I was so excited. All I wanted was one of those Big Breakfast deals -- pancakes, eggs, toast, homefries, bacon and sausage. I wanted to inhale a huge greasy meal and regret it afterwards.

Mission accomplished. Too bad the next time I ordered Eggs Benedict and had to suffer through the powdered Hollandaise sauce and eggs poached in vinegar (I know it makes it easier, but any idiot can make them without the vinegar..and then they won't taste like vinegar!). 

Service here is good, and the food generally comes pretty fast, but it's not great. Gayley's next door has way better brunch, but they're SO much slower. So you can't win either way, but if you want speed and basic, breakfast eats, come here."}
{"text":"Came here for the 1st time today. Just around the corner and was extra hungry for a traditional American breakfast. After reading the reviews, didn't know what to expect going in. 

Showed up around 9:15am and the place was just starting to get busy. Service was fairly quick. Definitely large portions. Was hard for us to finish what they gave us so we took part of it out. Quality of the food was great - not Michelin Star by any means but what you'd expect from a chain breakfast restaurant. 

Overall will definitely be back when the craving calls. It was getting busy around 10am and I could see how the service might slip around that time. With that said, overall experience was good."}
{"text":"Pretty standard restaurant - I have been here twice and ordered breakfast food both times since they offer all day breakfast. This time I ordered a combo which came with sausage, eggs, french toast, and home fries. It was a LOT of food for only around $10. I have no complaints about any of my food, it was all cooked well. I also like that this place has the option of dark rye toast, since I am a fan. Service was also pleasant. If you happen to be in the area and looking for a quick bite at an affordable price, this place is not a bad option! It is a simple, no frills kind of restaurant, but given the price I would pick this place over Cora's for breakfast."}
{"text":"The 5 pancake deal is perfect to share. It's modern, clean and the service is good. Comparable to a nice IHOP."}
{"text":"Well I have been to numerous Sunset Grills including the original in the Beaches and I'm a huge fan.
But this one had to be worst I have ever been to.
I sent my breakfast back three times because it was cold.
No visit from the manager and no offer to take it off our bill. Never again"}
{"text":"If Denny's had a twin brother, Sunset Grill would be that. The menu isn't extensive and the ambiance is not like a diner but more like a casual eat out place. The home fries are almost like baked potatoes, not the hash brown types you get at other places. Good for a weekend morning breakfast."}
{"text":"This place had servers running around and talking as if they were in a bar hanging out. They were loud and rowdy and yelled at each other and had no professionalism at all. There was one waitress who kept yelling at the cooks if they did something wrong or if she needed something. It was not a quiet meal. 

The coffee was very watered down and I do not recommend getting it. The breakfast food was standard and wasn't anything special, the sausages are on the oily side and the home fries are a bit soggy. Prices range from 5-12 dollars. Meals came out quick."}
{"text":"Traditional breakfast spot. Has good omelettes & French toast/pancake options. Can get crowded on weekends, but what place isn't."}
{"text":"To start of 2018, we ate a homey brunch. We were surprised that around 11 am, the place was packed and many servers were working to accommodate everyone. We didn't have to wait for a table - thank goodness!! 

Service was quick and friendly. 

We both got different omelettes with home potatoes and toast. The potatoes were to my liking. Not deep fried at all!!! The food came hot which was nice. Who wants a cold breakfast?? 

The downside to it is that there weren't any fruits on the side like most Cora's meals. 

For the first time ever, I was charged $1.49 for hot water!!!! What??? I didn't know it exist. So I was a bit in shock. Didn't confront the waitress; I'll pay the small price. 

Overall, it's a small cozy place to eat brunch at a decent price. Nothing fancy but be careful with random stuff you might have to pay."}
{"text":"Back at our favourite breakfast place. I recommend the omelettes and the sunset super. Also the coffee is very good!  Wait staff are very friendly and always a pleasure to be around. The food they put out is fresh, appetizing and tastes great."}
{"text":"For a bacon and egg breakfast with coffee it is a bit over $11.  Great service! Friendly. Fried home fries. (not deep fried which is really french fries) 5 huge strips of bacon with 3 eggs.  How can you go wrong.  Fast. Friendly. Great Value. Terrific! :)"}
{"text":"One of the worst things about going to Sunset Grill is driving past the sewage treatment plant. Once you get beyond that, it is smooth sailing. My friends and I have been coming here for a few years now. We mostly enjoy relaxing on a warm summer Sunday with some tall Red Stripe \"Big Stubby\" bottles. The mix of people that come up here are pretty weird. They usually have some bands playing. I am never into the music so I just zone out. It is so nice to be able to sit by the water and enjoy a cold alcoholic beverage. You can also do that right down the road at Edgewater Park but it is illegal. I never got caught though. Which brings me to think, now that Edgewater is under the umbrella of Cleveland Metroparks, they should open up a tiki bar on the sand over at Edgewater!"}
{"text":"Mediocre food at relatively cheap prices.

We ate:
Spinach and swiss omelette, leathery and unevenly cooked.
Waffles, soggy and overwhelmed by egginess.
Home fries, crumbly with the burnt bits slipping off and the good bits hard to find.

We paid:
$16 before tip.

Environment is roughly like a diner but without anything special going on. You could be at a rural truck stop or in the middle of NYC and nothing about the place would tell you where.

If you need cheap breakfast cooked for you, drop by. Otherwise, cook your own or hit up another breakfast restaurant."}
{"text":"Food 4/5 - Big portions! You can share! no need for two breakfasts! 

Service 4/5 - Friendly and always around! Need to pay at the cashier. 

Price 4/5 - $25 for two

Will be Back!"}
{"text":"Came here this morning for a quick breakfast.
I saw the reviews were pretty good so I thought it would be a good change from our usual sunday breakfast joint. 
The restaurant is very cute inside- all wood interior! Giant windows light up the restaurant with sun!

The waitress was slow and confused. She kept forgetting our order. How hard is it to remember 1 chocolate chip pancake..?
The fruit wasn't fresh like it claimed to be.. and the toast no butter.
For the price it was ok..
I would't go back.. maybe just for the coffee.. it was pretty good!"}
{"text":"Decent, convenient place for breakfast, with good variety and reasonable prices. On the first day we visited, the coffee cups were rather small, although free refills.  The second time we visited, though, got full-sized mugs (no doubt the dishwasher couldn't keep up the first time). The corned beef hash had a good crust but was on the dry side and not much flavor. Hash browns were also somewhat bland - no detectable garlic powder or onion flavors. Eggs were small (grade A) but very fresh.  A shout-out to their smoked salmon plate, however - very good salmon, silky and unctuous and not too salty.  The sesame bagel worked well with it and used Philly cream cheese.  Bacon was tasty and good texture.  Kids' pancakes were light and fluffy and thumbs up by them. Atmosphere is busy and boisterous with good cheerful service."}
{"text":"Had trouble finding but called and they told us perfect directions. My husbands Breakfast burrito was huge and good and he's a tuff one to please!
I got the French toast with bacon and large helpings and perfect! Highly recommend going off the beaten track and check this place out."}
{"text":"Very good option for a brunch. Cheap prices and food is good. The bad thing is that you will smell like bacon for the rest of the day. The steak comes exactly as you ask. And the food is very tasty!"}
{"text":"I love breakfast foods, so when a Sunset Grill opened close to me - it was a no brainer. 
Staff is always friendly and service is fast. 

Everything on the menu is simple and wholesome. The \"Sunset Super\" is one of my favourite items to get from the menu and extremely filling.

This is my go-to spot for brunch!"}
{"text":"It's like Sunday morning breakfast at mom's. Friendly staff that always remembers you and food is always on point. Extra bacon regular style...yum!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Malibu chicken sandwich with fries. Not quite what I was expecting. The sandwich is frozen style chicken fingers with ham on a sourdough bun. The chicken was not good. My wife ordered the blt and she did not care for it either. Thin bacon and the tomatoes looked like any other fast food restaurant. Needless to say we will not be returning here anytime soon."}
{"text":"Stayed in downtown, and decided to come here for breakfast. The service was really good. Upon arrival, we got seated quick, and our waiter was kind. He constantly checked up on us, and made sure we had everything we needed. 

However.. the food was not that great. I've been to many breakfast joints, and this one was def. not one of the best ones. The scrambled eggs tasted good, but the sausages, home fries and french toast were.. not so good. I don't even think you would call those home fries.. they literally looked like someone cut them up and was ready to drop them in a pot to cook. The french toast? Uhm, I've tried french toast at many places and this one.. I really don't even know how to explain it.. it just tasted bad. The sausages were a bit burnt.. and it was kind of sweet. I'm not sure if some people like their sausages like that, but I didn't find it tasty (however, that's just a personal opinion)."}
{"text":"It's a Sunset Grill....if you've been to one you know what to expect....however the service at this location is sub par.

Today, two of us went in for bkfst. The place wasn't too busy and we were seated right away. A friendly waitress came over a few minutes later and asked if we wanted drinks, which were ordered, and since we had closed our menus, she asked if we were ready to order.

I ordered a grilled cheese sandwich with bacon...was asked which type of bread I wanted....which was dark rye. My order was perfect.
My dining companion ordered Eggs Benedict. He asked that the poached eggs be prepared \"well done\", as he doesn't like runny yolk. She stated \" not a problem\" and off she went.
Our food came out about 20 minutes later, which seemed abnormally long but it is what it is. 
As I stated earlier, my order was absolutely correct. My dining companions came out with fried eggs on top of the english muffins, smothered in hollandaise sauce.  As the waitress dropped our food and left, we flagged her down and told her the eggs were not correct. She said that she thought he wanted them fried, well done (which was not what was ordered). He said that he didn't like fried eggs and wanted well done poached. She apologized, offered to replace them and took his plate. She went back to the area (counter) where the food comes out and spoke to another staff member...then to another...then the two male waiters looked at us and shook their heads. One of the male wait staff grabbed the same plate of food and brought it over and placed it down in front of my partner...then turned to leave. My partner looked at the plate and said \"I'm sorry..this is not correct...I didn't order fried eggs, I ordered well done poached\". The waiter glared at him, grabbed the plate and stormed off. WTF...the gall to bring back the same plate we had just sent back. His correct order was brought out 5 minutes later.

My main beef is the nerve of the male wait staff to attempt to return the same plate of food AFTER we had sent it back. Everything would have been fine, as our waitress had already apologized and was going to correct her error. I get mistakes happen, but what was the male waiter seriously thinking by bringing back the same plate of food...way to piss off a client.

Due to his actions, I'll never step foot in this restaurant again and would not recommend it to others."}
{"text":"With the ever growing population of King City, it was inevitable that more breakfast places would open...so this restaurant is a great addition to the area.
Located in a strip mall close to Coppas, the outside belies the interior. It was much larger on the interior than it looked from the parking lot.
When we arrived, there were several vacant tables so we were advised to \"sit where we want\", so we found ourselves a table and within a minute of being seated had menus in hand and a drink order done. When our waitress returned with our beverages (coffee/tea...each $2.25) we placed our order.
I ordered the blueberry pancakes ($6.99)  and added for $2.99 real maple syrup. Normally blueberry pancakes in some establishments means they blow across a quart of blueberries and you get nary a one on your pancakes...not the case here.  Each of my 3 pancakes had 7-10 blueberries in them. Only issue was that they were all congregated in the same area on each pancake. Perhaps blueberries don't like to be alone, so they formed small mobs in my pancakes, perhaps hoping that one of them would be spared and not get  devoured by a hungry diner. Wrong. Pancakes were fluffy and the added real maple syrup was great.
My dining companion ordered a BLT on marble rye. He said it was delish. It came with a side of home fries and some cucumber slices and carrot sticks (with ranch dressing).
Service was stellar.....being new, there were several staff members floating around refilling coffees, clearing tables, etc.
I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"Sunset Grill breakfast is pretty much the same no matter which location you go to. I ordered their Classic 3 Eggs and Bacon with home fries and toast. It's really hard for something to go wrong and this was no exception to that. Eggs were cooked how I asked and bacon is bacon (Crispy or on the Softer side, it's always good). 

Now here is why I deducted 2 stars from the review. 

1) The music was just too loud and the selection was poorly chosen for a breakfast/brunch place. It was the radio playing so I know it wasn't the establishments choice, but I suggest Sunset Grill look into creating a more suitable playlist.

2) The layout of this Sunset Grill was cramped. The tables are tightly packed and the servers bumped me several times while I was eating. Based on the average volume this location is likely to receive, it would be wise to take out some of these un-used tables which would free up the walking aisles and allow their customers to sit more comfortably.

Other than that, my server was pleasant and overall I left satisfied and content. I would return."}
{"text":"The place has definitely improved since the parks department took over management. Not as much riff raff. Nice location in the marina next to the park. Volley ball courts just east of the restaurant"}
{"text":"Great place, good food, and ideal location for lunch! The service is fair, the prices are to be expected, and the quality is good. I would definitely recommend this place to friends. 

You may want to call in your orders early because they are typically busy during lunch hours. The dining area is rather small, so taking your food to go shouldn't be out of question.

Nice, local diner. I like it"}
{"text":"Your typical breakfast place. Late review but I came on Victoria Day where they are opened! And close to home so that was a bonus. Quite a bit of seating and we got there by 1130. Wasn't that busy. Maybe people didn't know if they were opened or not? 

Service was good. Food was average. Decently priced. Nothing significant stood out. 

3.5* overall."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast today, not my first time here but enjoyed it as much as last time. The food is good but not great, I had the peameal style 4 Bacon & three eggs and coffee. Not a big fan of the bacon as they were a bit chewy, but the eggs and the toast that came with it was good. To be honest there is nothing special about the food I ordered, but that is the reason I come here for. The friendly staff, fast service and calm breakfast experience is why I am giving them a 4 star(if the food is a bit better or cheaper, it would have been a 5 star place to me). They only have one type of coffee, and it is not included with the meal. BUT, it is all you can drink. And when I was about to leave, my server asked if I wanted to take the coffee to go. Something I'd never thought would be an option given that it is all you can drink. They say you should start your day off the right way, and if you ask me, having breakfast here is definitely the right way."}
{"text":"Didn't feel like cooking breakfast came here early on a Sunday morning got a seat quickly from friendly hostess. I was quickly greeted by server as I sat down got my coffee order. Looked over menu prices seemed similiar to other places so there is concern there. Ordered the corned beef hash meal. Got my coffee then 5 min latee got my food order...that was fast... LOL made sure it was cooked though ...it was... BEST corned beed hash HERE !! Enjoyed my food and service here attentive and friendly the only thing i didn't like were the home fries and toast was a very buttery thats why the 4 stars."}
{"text":"Had the three eggs (over easy) and sausages breakfast. It was okay. I would come back because it's a nice spot but the food was nothing i'd really come back for. The servers were quite nice though!"}
{"text":"Pretty fairly priced breakfast and brunch around eatons and financial district. Diner style and quite cozy inside. Probably not the most convenient to weave through the tables and chairs with heavy winter jackets on though.

Their all day breakfast is pretty decent, $8.50 for 3 eggs, choice of meat, homestyle potatoes and toast (2 slices). My friends ordered one of the omlettes, the 3 eggs w/ turkey bacon, and an eggs florentine. Everything was fine, turkey bacon imo was burnt though. Homestyle fries tasted slightly undercooked and a bit too salty. I kept reaching for water after the meal. 
The omelette was huge for my friend. I looked like there were 6 eggs or so in that. She was only able to finish half but it was delicious from what she told me. Eggs florentine had about 4 eggs, 2 for each english muffin and the hollandaise sauce was good. 

Service was decent and we were able to get in and out in under 1.5hrs. Decent place to get filled up for cheap!"}
{"text":"If you want a templated breakfast experience that will never let you down, I insist that you stroll into Sunset Grill. Breakfasts are stamped out at an alarming rate and are never a disappointment. If you liked the way your homefries were cooked last time, you can pretty much guarantee the same experience next time. No surprises here.

Super affordable, quick breakfast with the usual suspects (3 egg combo, french toast, pancakes, etc.). One of the servers, Jessie, I believe has been there for six years now. Always nice to see a familiar, friendly face! 

It's a shame that they close at 4pm - I'd love to stop by otherwise for some late night breakfast! The place gets VERY busy on weekends so show up early!"}
{"text":"Truly a cookie cutter \"diner style\" breakfast experience from location to location. I'm in love with SG's hash browns but the eggs are always too soft/undercooked - a case of the loosies is practically guaranteed so don't stray too far from a bathroom while your body digests. 

Dirt cheap."}
{"text":"Wow! This place is busy! Huge portions (should probably come with a warning :p) and the food is good. Great service too ... Our server was Luisa and my god she has energy! Keep up the great work and would recommend this place to anyone that wants your typical american breakfast."}
{"text":"For as busy as they are (only bar on whiskey island), the service was pretty good. She checked up on us pretty often for our drinks. Their menu is extremely limited, so don't come hungry unless you're craving bar food. It's just average bar food, nothing fancy and nothing noteworthy."}
{"text":"Super slow service on a not so busy Sunday morning. I saw our food were sitting in the counter but the waiter took forever to bring them over to our table. He bypassed there few times but just ignored. The home fries was one of the worst I've ever had. They were not fried, just semi warm and over seasoned.  
I like other sunset grill locations such as the one in Vaughan mills. So just drive 2 more minutes and forget this one."}
{"text":"Went here (somewhat) recently with Kat F. What can I say about this place?

1. Busy - lots of people come here, though the line moves pretty quickly, and food is VERY quick to arrive. The immense pile of hashbrowns-in-progress as you are whisked past the kitchen area to your table is a sight to behold.
2. Space - there isn't much. Walking past the other tables on the way to ours at the back was a bit of a challenge, but once we got there it was comfortable. I seem to recall hitting my head on a light fixture though - not sure. Head injuries can be like that, though :) *
3. Food - lots of it, very tasty, and as I said, arrived quickly.
4. Service - waitress was friendly, knew the menu, and was efficient.
5. Price - reasonable to very good. I got a lot of omelette for $10ish.
6. Methods of payment - in this, the 21st century, I have a real problem with cash only businesses - especially those that will gladly cut out a chunk of counter at the front to install a white label ATM rather than get Moneris to install a terminal. Hey, Sunset Grill: Get a freaking PIN pad already. Credit and debit are essentially de rigueur at this point.

* - Found that one out the hard way. Not here, elsewhere."}
{"text":"I went with my family a little while ago & it was a pretty good experience. I love breakfast food so I was pretty happy with my choice in a breakfast special (you can never go wrong with breakfast food). Would come here again.

Food: It was nothing g amazing, but I enjoyed myself. I got a eggs sunny side up with white toast & breakfast sausages. Like I said earlier, you can't go wrong with breakfast food so I was happy.

Service: I found that service was a tiny bit slow, but they seemed understaff so I'll give that to them. Other than that, everything went perfectly fine.

Environment: It was a very open atmosphere, I enjoyed it. It was kind of rowdy with the amount of people in the room but that's expected. The big windows let in a lot of light and it really helped with the morning vibe of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Standard breakfast fare. The price is good and the servers are very pleasant. Great place to go in a pinch but again it's very average breakfast food."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good here, but the service has always been excellent. Alex was my server this time and she was great!

Saturday mornings are pretty slow, but the place is packed on Sunday mornings due to services at the nearby Summit Community Church."}
{"text":"Staff very friendly and the service is very quick.  Got the omlet and it was really good.  They did not rush us out."}
{"text":"I love breakfast at just about anytime and this is fairly solid spot for a greasy spoon.  Reasonably priced, good service and decent food.  Nothing exceptional but I enjoy it."}
{"text":"We come to this location every so often but this time when we walked in, and there were only small tables available . The hostess told us to sit at a small table first and when a larger table is ready that we could move to it. Well we ordered and got our food and a few minutes later a larger table beside us opened up so we asked to move over, but the owner said no. We told him that the host told us to sit here first and we can move later but he gave us an I don't care look. He said other ppl are waiting in line then walked away.  So what if other ppl in line? I was here b4 them wouldnt that make me in front of the line? Managing a business with  Dispeakable bad service and bad manner just lost him business from a valuable frequent customer."}
{"text":"Go to Sunset Grill at Bloor and Runnymede instead. 
Terrible service. We waited for an hour only to learn that they have not even started cooking our breakfast. When I decided to cancel my order, I was sent to talk to the Manager who was an a--hole. Ended up dropping $8 just for their shitty drinks and a wasted hour. 
So be careful, this can happen to you too. Make a safe choice and go to a different Sunset Grill, same food, better service."}
{"text":"I go here for lazy weekends. I gave it 3 stars because the food isn't bad, not bland, it isn't amazingly seasoned, just right. The sausages they use is pretty good compared to a 5 star hotel I stayed in Toronto. The bacon is cooked to my liking. The scrambled eggs could use light cream with pepper. The pancakes are bland but opting for blue berries or chocolate gives it flavour. The juices are freshly squeezed. Our server was really good, attentive. Again, I would return for lazy weekends. Portion size is appropriate to price."}
{"text":"Convenient brunch place downtown! We came as a party of 4, all hungover morning after New Year's Eve. We were seated after a 10 minute wait around 12:30. They don't take reservations so expect a line if you come at peak times. 

The menu is typical chain diner fare, with egg combos, omelettes, pancakes, and sandwiches. They don't have many healthy options (most brunch places offer home fries and or salad, but this place doesn't). Prices are low though, which is great!"}
{"text":"I always pick Sunset Grill as my 1st choice for breakfast when I have chance.
Food is great. Especially this place on Dixie is very clean and the owner is awesome !
I really recommended this place!
Enjoy"}
{"text":"I meet here often, the staff is friendly and remembers your order, refills always on coffee and tea. Owners are great and staff is steady. Food (bacon and eggs) great. good location, plenty of parking. Busy on the weekend! Keep up the great work!
Al"}
{"text":"Definitely a regular at this place for breakfast! Food is good, favorite is the Sunset Healthy. Service is pretty slow and bad almost always but I guess they just hate their jobs. Good place with reasonable prices. Nice family place & good for dates too. Great vibe"}
{"text":"food was mediocre and the management/servers here are just rude. If you're looking for a nice place to have breakfast/lunch, this isn't the place. Our order took a while to come out and when it was presented on the table, our server let us know that our bread was \"just about to come out\". 20 minutes had passed as we watched our server ignore us and fool around with the kitchen staff. We were close to finishing our meal so I had to get up and ask her to cancel the order. I hear her bickering at th kitchen and the manager, which was unnecessary. Anyways, this isn't a big deal but our experience paying the bill was the worst. No one said sorry and the manager informed us that he took the item that we didn't get off the bill.... Then walked away! wtf..."}
{"text":"We went in around 3:15 and didn't realize they were closing up pretty soon after at 3:30PM. 

The staff was great, we didn't feel rushed and they gave us the time we needed t enjoy the good. Great job!

The food was excellent and had been exactly what we were looking for. Anywhere that sells all day breakfast is good and this was no exception. 3 eggs and half bacon and have sausage was my highlight

It came within a few minutes along with our other order (clubhouse) 

Great portions. Fairly inexpensive and you get a decent sized plate. Will go again!"}
{"text":"Great Breakfast! 
Ordered the eggs scrambled with cheddar cheese, prepared perfectly soft (so many places overcook the eggs into oblivion and turn them rubber). The Bacon (what kind of bacon was this?) was just delicious, 5 big pieces. Not that plasticky crap you get in the U.S, this was great I'd order via mail to get more!!
The home fries were cubed and just slightly undercooked which made them just ok, I do like them crispy on the outsides and maybe they should throw some onions and seasoning kick them up a notch. 
The Service was outstanding! Attentive and friendly but not overbearing or obnoxious. 2 coffee refills without asking. And the place is super clean which was a pleasant surprise, usually, because usually I associate a great breakfast with a greasy dive. 
Home run!"}
{"text":"This chain always exceeds my expectations and that's why I have yet to try another. 

I have been to a couple around the GTA and all have been great, including this one. The food to price ratio is great, food is always made fresh to order and its relatively quick for the amount of staff and customers that enter this place on a weekend. 

My favourite menu item is \"The French Connection\". 3 eggs, 2 slices of French toast, choice of bacon, ham or sausage and home fries. For $11.99. Great deal in my books. 

This has completely replaced Cora's in my opinion. Came here once a couple years ago and never looked back! Way better food here!"}
{"text":"really not worth the wait or money when you have much better breakfast options in the area. 1 trip to this place was enough for me, going a 2nd time was a mistake by me."}
{"text":"This place was decent, efficient, and served its purpose. I got the grilled breast with scrambled eggs with cheese and onions and home fries and my lady got the all day breakfast special with sausage, eggs, and home fries. She said her food was good. I thought mine was just alright. The chicken was marinated and seasoned but dry, and the cheese on the eggs was heavy so it did blend well with the eggs, the home fries were abundant on both our plates. Overall, it was cool and I would try something else on the menu."}
{"text":"This place opens early and has the friendliest early morning service. The breakfast servings were huge and reasonably priced. We had to get take-out and it was very fast just like they advertise. Bonus, they have fresh squeezed OJ."}
{"text":"Went there 3 times at least with different friends ( see a pattern? ) we all agreed the food was great, service was nice and within appropriate waiting time -despite a packed place- i had a veggie omelette which came with side order of potatoes. One time we ordered a sandwich ( not knowing it came with pork) and they changed it for us without charges. I would definitely go back there soon. Enjoy"}
{"text":"This is a nice breakfast choice. I've been there a few times, and we've never had to wait for a table. A fairly standard breakfast menu. The staff are friendly, attentive, and efficient. Good location. It's not spectacular, but a good family-friendly, neighbourhood restaurant."}
{"text":"great breakfast, excellent service 
not happy about paying for parking 
food is worth it though"}
{"text":"The trouble with breakfast places is if the coffee is horrible it ruins the entire experience. The coffee here is horrible, so you can draw your own conclusions on the overall experience."}
{"text":"The food was meh and the service terrible. I'd give it a 2.5.

Parking:
Lots of parking but be careful walking from your car to the restaurant for some reason drivers don't seem to pay attention. You could get hit.

Decor:
Typical sunset grill except for a two top squeezed in the back in the worse spot.
(Apparently it has my name on it)

Food:
Have been here twice. Food is typical sunset grill. Ok not great but good enough not to be offensive. 

Service:
Since I've only been there twice I am not a regular. Regulars get to jump the line, get to sit 2 people at a 4 person table while your party of three get squeezed into a small 2 seater so that the server can't actually reach the table and everything including boiling hot cups of coffee ( but no refills) get passed over someones head, and get their food first even though they actually ordered 12 minutes after you. 

Conclusion:

Not going back."}
{"text":"I came here last Sunday and oh boy, was it ever busy!

My friend and I were able to get a table within 5 minutes which was good. The prices are a little bit more than usual but well worth it.

I got a smoked salmon eggs Benedict. It was a good portion for what I paid. I wasn't a fan of their home style potatoes though.

Our waitress consistently checked up on us and kept offering to fill up our coffee and tea.

I'll definitely be back here in the near future."}
{"text":"I've been to this place twice so I figured I should give it a quick review.

Sunset Grill has become quite popular in the GTA.  Personally I think it is better that Cora's.  

It's low key and when we go to this location on Sundays at around 10:30am there is usually never a wait.

Here's what I like about this place.  The price is right and it's consistent.  The eggs are good and cooked the way I like them.  The pancakes are fluffy and my boyfriend can get enough of their french toast supreme with the strawberries and whipped cream.  The french toast is the classic white bread dipped in egg.  None of this 2 inch thick brioche dipped and baked with cinnamon and icing sugar. 

The only complaint I have is the home fries.  They're dry and could use more flavor but this is something that most breakfast places can't seem to get right."}
{"text":"Food are normal like any other Sunset Grill.  The beacon are too dry and hard to chew.  Services are not great.  Waiter won't refill coffee unless you asked for, and waiter ignore any other empty coffee mugs in the neighborhood even she has the coffee pot on hand."}
