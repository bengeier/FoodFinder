{"text":"We were in Sala this weekend to celebrate my brother's birthday and let me tell you its the best place to celebrate bdays! Mo, the owner is extremely friendly and treated the day extra special for our family in this special day! Food taste and looks amazing!! I got Khao soi which i had to save for lunch the next day to savour its goodness.   Will definitely be back here!!!"}
{"text":"I wish I know. Apparently 2.3 km is too far for delivery so we never find out how good the food is."}
{"text":"So glad we discovered this place. Like others have said, this could easily be our favourite Thai place in the city, even including the trendy hotspots downtown. We have made several  trips to Thailand and not just in the touristy parts and this got us excited about Thai food again.  We had the Khao Soi which was my favourite dish of the night. Full flavoured without being over rich or heavy. Wife had Penang Curry which she said was great. I tasted nice peanut in there. Shared the Bangkok Pad Thai with the kids which is actually made of glass noodle wrapped in egg. That was really excellent as well, and not as common a way to have it. We also shared the papaya salad which was a bit spicey and came with nicely seasoned chicken and coconut rice. Coconut rice was just the way it should be. Otherwise this was good though not a standout to me.  Dessert was their Thai Roti Pancake with condensed milk. Fantastic. Mango slushy (didn't see it on the menu but they were practically on every table). They also bring some shrimp chip type snacks to the table on the house.  We will be back or ordering delivery. There was a lineup on Sunday just after 6 when we got there. Give these guys your business!"}
{"text":"Stumbled across this cozy Thai resturant over the weekend and was quite surprised and excited about this new addition to the neighbourhood . Interior is reminiscent of the caf√©s I visited in Northern Thailand back in February. I ordered their khao Soi and Thai iced tea. The khao Soi was beautifully presented and tasted better than the ones I had in Thailand or even Toronto. I will definitely be returning to try some of their other dishes."}
{"text":"If you're craving Thai food, this is a must try! Server was very attentive. They are willing to make adjustments upon request. Asked for the Khao Soi spicy and they delivered a dish that packed a punch without compromising the complex flavours. Apparently they are great for takeout as quite a few people stopped by while I was having lunch."}
{"text":"By chance I stumbled upon Sala while walking on the Danforth. I had the massaman and I have to say it was the best chicken massaman curry that I have ever tasted. I will definitely be back to try the Panang curry. Service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"This new restaurant was delicious! Fortunately, I made a reservation because for a Thursday night, this place filled up quick.   We ordered the gai satay (chicken satay) that comes with 4 skewers per order. We also received complimentary shrimp chips (everyone at the restaurant appeared to receive these .) The satay was moist and flavourful.   Next, I ordered the Paneng curry with shrimp & my friend ordered the Kah Ra Pow with beef (#11). The portions were generous and we both had some left over. Both dishes came with rice & were incredible. The great thing about this restaurant was the choice of spice (No spice, mild, medium or Thai spice).   For dessert, we opted for the highly popular mango sticky rice. A generous portion once again!  The only downside was that the busier the restaurant got, the harder it became to get the bill at the end of the meal. Otherwise, the staff is attentive & knows the menu very well. I would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Extremely yummy food and very friendly service!! Definitely one of the best thai places in TO!"}
{"text":"Excellent Pad Gra Pao!  Loved the food here. Will come back again to try the mango sticky rice."}
{"text":"Delicious food and great service!!! Highly recommend if your in the Danforth area : )"}
{"text":"I've been waiting for food for 45 mins now.  Wish I could comment on how it tastes. Shrimp chips on the house were nice.  Update, people who sat after us just got food.  Still hungry"}
{"text":"Food and staff here are amazing! Definitely not just your average Thai food. The chef has an artistry that is subtle and playful with his dishes. The flavours are complex and balanced and of course delicious!  Presentation is well thought-out and enticing. Favourite dish so far is the pomelo salad. Amazing and a must try! Staff here make you feel so warm and are patient when you have questions. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Delicious and honest Thai food in a relaxed and unpretentious atmosphere. While?the presentation is thoughtful and pleasing, it doesn't overshadow the actual food which is fresh and flavourful. Starters are great for sharing tapas style and might be better than the entrees which while well prepared, and fairly standard Thai restaurant fare. Smoothie and iced tea options are very good as well. We were too full to try any desserts but they sounded good."}
{"text":"I'm in love with this place! Delicious food and gorgeous presentation!! Go for the mango sticky rice desert~"}
{"text":"Had takeout. It's a clean place and you'll get good normal Thai take out food, but I was expecting very good food from the other reviews. This is an average Thai place (for take-out). Service was friendly."}
{"text":"Pork satays were gristly and tough.  Chicken curry was oily."}
{"text":"Amazing Bangkok Pad Thai, amazing mango rice dessert, tasty Thai iced tea. Lovely decor, lovely service. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"This is me and my friend's favorite place to go! The food is amazing especially the Tom Yum soup with shrimp and the Pad Gra Paow with beef and chicken mixed together (highly recommend you mix the two meat). Oh and also the Thai iced tea so good!!!"}
{"text":"Discovered via Uber Eats. Authentic and tasty Thai cuisine. Portions are very generous. The Pad Thai was flavorful and filling. Shrimp chips are addicting and the sauce they provide will put you into a glorious food coma. The family that runs this restaurant is very kind and work hard. This is definitely our beaches go-to for Thai."}
{"text":"Thai iced tea was watered down. Fritters were soggy and was all batter. No cutlery until 20 min in. Not that busy at the time. Service was not great despite many servers."}
{"text":"I tried to order from this restaurant directly, but they no longer have delivery drivers and provided delivery through Uber Eats. So, I ordered via Uber Eats.  I ordered red curry, which includes jasmine rice, and a bunch of other items that don't include rice. The delivered order did not include white rice. Called the restaurant to ask if they could send some our way and was told there is no way for them to do so.  They refunded instead, but I'd rather have red curry with rice than an extra $13 in my pocket.  I won't be ordering from them again.  Edit: Ordered from them again. Probably shouldn't have considering the last experience, but their food is good. They forgot an appetizer this time. I now consider this restaurant to be unreliable."}
{"text":"A cozy Thai restaurant, but no comparison to Sukhothai, Khao San Road, or Sabai Sabai.  Upon entering we waited briefly as the servers were just clearing up our table as we arrived during a busy time. We were a group of 4, excited to try a bunch of dishes as we saw a video from BlogTO on Facebook that presented the dishes in a wonderful light.   We also found out that they discontinued the complementary shrimp chips :( but the servers were kind and attentive; often filling up our waters when it was getting empty.  On to our orders:   I'm always excited to try Thai Iced Tea at any Thai restaurant. I was excited by the picture because they serve it in a mason jar which is cute. However, it was completely watered down and that signature zing to the Thai Iced Tea was non-existent.  For our appetizer, we got the Thai grilled pork skewer which was good, nothing special. That's all I really have to say for it.   One dish I was really excited about was the Bangkok pad thai because of this thinly cooked egg that was folded like a crepe but with a pad thai filling. I thought that was one unique feature that most Thai restaurants don't do in terms of how they cooked pad thai. Another thing that was unique was the type of noodles they used. They used thin glass noodles as opposed to the typical rice noodle. However, I found it underdelivered in flavour and those differences didn't really make a difference.  We also got the Khao soi which was pretty smaller than I would assume for a main dish portion size. It was a good thing we ordered more main dishes because it wasn't really filling. There was not enough noodles. The only points I could give was the presentation and that the taste wasn't bad but wasn't exciting.  We ordered a chicken green curry which I found our group enjoyed and is probably the best dish we ordered from the group. It had a great mix of ingredients and flavours with each bite.  To end it off, we ordered the sticky mango rice dessert which was served on this cute giant spoons and the mango was presented as a rose. There was some chocolate drizzle (I think it was nutella). And as wonderful nutella is, I think I learned that nutella doesn't need to be on everything because that mango and chocolate combination was strange especially with the rice. Don't get me wrong, being Chinese/Vietnamese, we have many sticky rice dessert combinations, I just wasn't a fan of this one. It was pretty though.  Would I come back? I wouldn't think so. They just lacked the wow factor for me."}
{"text":"Love the food at Sala. Tasty, delicious and so many layers of spices. The food is fresh, plentiful and quite frankly, addictive. Service is fantastic. I love going to Sala."}
{"text":"Great authentic Thai food, exceptionally hospitable service.   A true winner located on the Danforth."}
{"text":"Really great service. Mo (the owner) really made everyone feel welcome and friendly. As for the food, this is authentic Thai food and really delicious. Had the panang curry which was rich and flavourful. Had a taste of the khao soi and the Bangkok pad thai. Both were great. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"So excited for a new awesome restaurants in the neighbourhood! Heard someone talking about it in the grocery store in front of me so we changed our plans on Saturday night to go there - what a good decision. There were 4 of us, we arrived around 8.45 pm - they don't take reservations on weekends, but they said they figured after 8.30 it would be easy to get a table and it was. We ordered the mango salad, Khao soi (veggie), penang with chicken, green curry chicken and pad see ew. Everything was awesome, this place now tops my list for Thai in the city. Service was very good, and prices were excellent, all of the above came to $64 including tax. We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Best Thai restaurant on the Danforth for vegans and vegetarians! The recently updated menu specifies which dishes are vegan or vegetarian friendly, and which can be made vegetarian/vegan. We have been to Sala a few times since it opened last year and have never been disappointed. The food is fresh, flavourful, and creative - and the portions are generous. The squash fritters are a MUST try, as is the coconut ice cream - sticky rice and house made coconut ice cream topped with toasted sesame, mango, and other goodness. On top of all this, the staff are lovely - friendly, welcoming, and attentive. The cozy atmosphere is wonderful to enjoy a delicious meal."}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant! Their service is really friendly and accommodating. The restaurant was very busy and they were nice enough to make room for us :) The pad Thai was one of the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend on a Friday night after seeing a feature video on BlogTO. Overall, phenomenal service, good-lookin' food (their mango sticky rice dessert is almost too pretty to eat), but lackluster flavour.  The pad thai sauce tasted very artificial, and I felt there were too many chives in the dish which overpowered everything else. I did like that the rice noodles in the regular pad thai were super chewy! Maybe a personal preference, but I wasn't a fan of the glass noodles in the Bangkok pad thai. We also tried the squash fritters. I felt they didn't have much taste, not enough crunch to them, and there also wasn't enough dipping sauce for the whole plate of fritters.  Sala is a great neighbourhood addition to East York, but in the meantime, I'll be satisfying my Thai cravings with the Pai restaurant family (including Sukhothai and its estranged member Khao San Road)."}
{"text":"I went for the first time the other day with my little family. We were greeted nicely by the staff and received spicy shrimp cracker/chips. We had the moo ping pork skewers. they were delicious with an accompanying sauce and slice of orange. the decoration was pretty nice. We also tried the thai iced tea while tasty and served in a jar mug I found it a little too sweet for my taste.Unfortunately I cannot really the name of the other dishes but all was served beautifully and had great authentic Thai taste. We will definitely return to this great addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Came here when it was just open. Ordered Pad Thai which is wrapped in a omelet and is glass noodles not the traditional Pad Thai noodled. It's unique and good flavour. Great decor and you can see that the owner really put effort into it to make it special. The Thai ice tea is great too. Every mug has a different word in English and Thai on it - so cute."}
{"text":"After hearing from so many raving reviews of sala and reading the article on yelp I was super tempted to come and try this place out. It is located on the danforth and easily accessible through the bloor danforth subway line. Definitely try to make a reservation before hand because the restaurant is quite small and gets filled up quickly! Majority of the seats are 2 seater and I believe on 2 or 3 big tables of 4/6.  After hearing how one of the owner was related to the owners at Pai, I knew I had to try their squash fritters. The portion size was good but I felt it wasn't fried as much as I wish it could have been. By the time it got to our table some of the fritters were already soggy. We also ordered the chicken skewer with peanut sauce. Quite standard and felt the chicken was also a tad bit dry.  The saving grace was their main dish. I ordered the special pad Thai that came with glass noodle and an egg crepe on top. It was so unique and flavourful! My fiance got the chicken green curry and that was also very flavourful with a good amount of bamboo shoots, mushroom and Chicken! Pricing wise is a little on the higher side (similar to Pai). Most likely will not return as it's not as central to downtown. Would only think of coming back if it's in the area!"}
{"text":"Great location for dinner. This is our first time trying out. The food is ok but not as authentic as what I was expecting. The down side - it took us 45 mins to wait for the food to be served."}
{"text":"My first Yelp review goes to Sala Modern Thai Kitchen & Bar. A small but very cozy restaurant located in the Danforth with the most friendly servers.   My husband and I arrived shortly after 6:30 pm on a Friday night & with only two tables left in the restaurant, we got seated right away. While not having to wait for a table was great, it took awhile to get some water and menus. My husband ended up asking our server to bring them.  Once we looked at the menu, we decided on Fish Cakes as an appetizer and the Pad Thai (with beef) & Pad Gra Pow (with pork) for our main course. With both the Pad Thai & Pad Gra Pow, you have the choice of spice level - we went with medium for both.  The Fish Cakes could have been a little more crispy but it was still very flavourful. The Pad Thai & Pad Gra Pow were also good but the beef in the Pad Thai was very tough and lacked some flavour. Although we both decided on medium for spice level, the Pad Gra Pow was so much spicer than the Pad Thai, so beware when ordering.  We ended our meal with the Mango Sticky Rice and complimentary coconut ice cream that was .  Overall, slower but friendly service & decent Thai food for the price you pay."}
{"text":"Decided to come here after seeing many good reviews, however was slightly disappointed. The portions were small, and the prices were quite pricey especially in this neighbourhood.   Pad Thai (3/5): was very nicely decorated however overly salty  Massaman curry beef (4/5): loved the rich flavours of the curry, there was also a bit of a kick. IMO it tasted more like japanese curry which I love. The dish came with a side of rice, however overall the portion was small  Mango sticky rice (2.5/5): was most excited for this dish but was sadly let down. The presentation was beautiful but the rice was very hard and the mango was sour. Perhaps we got a bad batch but it definitely looked a lot better than it tasted"}
{"text":"Hits and misses. The wings lacked flavour and crispy but the dip was flavourful. The papaya salad was fresh and delicious but I didn't appreciate whole garlic in it. The tom yum soup was flavourful and the broth rich but it was way too sweet and the shrimps were of low quality. The pad thai was decent but the khao soi was bang on. Stir fried dishes were decent. The Thai iced tea should be skipped. Small restaurant but clean and modern. Decent service."}
{"text":"We've had take-away here a few times now and have enjoyed the food every time.  The wait can be verrrrry long, but is worth it in the end.  The staff is very nice and the food is fresh and well made."}
{"text":"The food presentation is fantastic! The atmosphere is good, and the music is pleasant. I had the Khao Soi (below), which was slightly spicy but very tasty. I'd recommend this spot! The meat also happens to be halal (except for the pork, of course), which is a plus for anyone to whom it applies."}
{"text":"Sala Modern Kitchen is a fantastic (and I mean really fantastic) new addition to this fledgling east Danforth strip - at the time of review, it is about 1 week old. SMK is run by this adorable husband and wife duo who decided to take a chance to open up a restaurant on this strip of the Danforth instead of competing with the other Thai giants downtown, and I am super, super glad they did. Decor aside (which is comfortable and studded with succulents), the food and service are the real stars here. The food is definitely comparable (and dare I say, better) than some of the other popular Thai eateries downtown.   I came here on a bright sunny afternoon for a family lunch. Between the 6 of us, we ordered 5 dishes and 2 desserts, which was the perfect amount to satisfy us.   1. Bangkok pad thai with shrimp ($14) - this is made with glass noodles instead of the traditional rice noodles. The noodles are topped with a thin egg crepe, and are stir fried in a tamarind based sauce with a medley of vegetables. Peanuts and chili flakes accompany it. This pad thai is definitely a winner - it is sweet, salty and sour, and the noodles are cooked to the right doneness. Plus, they didn't skimp on the shrimp!  2. Pad Gra Pow ($13) - a little too salty for my liking, but still flavourful. Not my favourite of the day.  3. Khao Soi with chicken ($13) - egg noodles with creamy yellow curry. A little on the spicy side, but the curry was definitely delicious. A winner in my books.   4. Panang curry with chicken ($12.5) served with white rice - my favourite of the day! The curry is super creamy and laden with peanuts - although it is a little salty, the curry tastes good over everything (rice, pad thai, pad see ew...). The chicken, albeit a little dry, was plentiful.  5. Pad See Ew with shrimp ($14) - again, really great (see the theme?). The noodles were cooked al dente, and had very prominent \"wok hei\". Flavour was on point.   6. Mango sticky rice ($8) - sticky rice with coconut milk with sweet mango. The presentation was very nice, and the portion size was great.   7. Thai roti pancake ($7) - crispy roti covered in sweetened condensed milk, and filled with nutella and banana - automatic winner! These ingredients would taste good in just about any combination.   And finally, the service. Since they just opened, Mo and Ray (wife and hubby) provided the excellent service themselves. They were incredibly gracious and friendly, and made each customer feel appreciated and valued. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"If you love authentic Thai food beautifully presented. I recommend this place. Just lovely people and great food... we have had the green curry, the pad Thai, the squash fries and the sticky mango rice. All just so delish!"}
{"text":"Finally some good Thai food in the neighbourhood!  We gave up ordering Thai food months back - just no authentic options anymore; however, after having heard so some many great reviews of this restaurant we decided to give it a try, and we were not disappointed. Excellent vegetarian options on the menu too!    For our order we enjoyed Jean's Coconut Noodle - excellent flavourful dish, which regardless of the name is not all about the coconut.  The Pad Pak Roum Stir-fried mixed vegetables were fresh and a great addition to our noodle dish.  We also tried Fuk Tong Tod appetizer which is the only dish we will skip on our next order."}
{"text":"Definitely try the Jean's coconut noodle. Will be going back to try out other dishes."}
{"text":"Found this little gem near Danforth and Greenwood.    We went for dinner on a weekday and this place was fairly busy. We ordered Pad Kra Prow, Green Curry with tofu, chicken satay and Matcha Green Tea.   - Matcha Green Tea was very thick and sweet. Not recommend before main course.   - Chicken Satay was little too sweet for my liking but my gf liked it and was enjoying the satay along with their peanut sauce.  - Pad Kra Prow with shrimp was very flavorful. I would have preferred more shrimp but can't complain about the taste. Salt and spices were on point. Unlike Pai and Sabai Sabai shrimp and veggies had little gravy. Taste wise I rate this dish 5/5.   - Green Curry was very flavorful and taste was on par with Pai. The soup was not too watered down and had good variety of veggies in decent quantity.   Conclusion: Must try Thai place with decent pricing."}
{"text":"Once I got to this restaurant, it was pretty busy as it was a small place but we didn't have to wait long because the waiters quickly got a table set up for my group of four. The food smelled really good and they had a cool promotion for a free drink if you wrote a review on any social media pages! The food looked really delicious and tasted just as great! The service and food were both exceptional."}
{"text":"Updated review:  We've been loyal customers here for one year and they've got better and better! During one of our many visits here before, I noted some inconsistencies in their cooking compared to before, but now they have been excellent every time we came here! They changed and improved their recipes and added several new dishes, which are delicious. We love the new Tom Yum Pad Thai! If you like Tom Yum and you like pad Thai, you would like this dish."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant with a group of foodie friends and arrived around 630! Got a table for 7 people and we ordered a whole bunch of food! Instead of going through every food I had, I will highlight some MUST ORDER dishes!  Tom Yum and Shrimp Chips are a must for appetizers. The Tom Yum was so delicious and I can see why my friend Mrs. Dim Sum can drink three herself! The spiciness was just right, not too overkill and it did remind me of the Tom Yum I had in Thailand 4 years ago!  Shrimp Chips was surprisingly good, I didn't expect much, but I couldn't stop eating this dish!  The Shrimp Chips has a trace of spiciness too which made the flavouring that much better!  For main, everyone ordered their own and I went with the Beef Masaman.  The Masaman was delicious but the beef could be a little softer.  Overall presentation and taste were tremendous!  I also tried other dishes my friends had and I really enjoyed the Khao Soi which was pretty spicy but very delicious!  Desserts, you MUST order their Mango Sticky Rice!  The mango was fresh and the portion of this thing is HUGE.  The spoon they used to plate the Sticky Rice was very cute and I almost wanted to take one home with me! =p  Overall, tremendous food and service, a truly 5/5 in jwongeats book!"}
{"text":"I would give Sala six stars if I could.  The flavours are bold, it's real food. The presentation of every plate and bowl was beautiful and the care of it's construction was evident.   The servers are kind and gracious.  The room is small-ish and it's best to come on the early side before peak dinnertime, or put your name in the waitlist book. The only thing that might dampen your experience are some huffy impatient fellow diners, who sit quite close, and you have to hear how they don't understand that slower service is to be expected at the height of the dinner rush. LOL."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a good thai place for a long time and though this is quite far from home, it is my go to recommendation for thai! Came here twice: once in a big group and once with the boyfriend. Both times service and food were excellent. Everything came in a timely manner and the server was quick to be of assistance and very friendly!  First time, we got a variety of dishes: shrimp chips with a delicious thai chilli sauce, Bangkok pad thai, Khao Soi, Pad See Ew, Masaman Curry and Mango Sticky Rice. All the dishes were delicious and very beautifully presented. The Pad See Ew and the Masaman Curry were my top 2 favourites! Only disappointment was the mango sticky rice (it's beautifully arranged in a rose), the mango was not sweet (may be due to being off season) and the sticky rice was too hard for my liking.   Second time, ordered the Bangkok pad thai (uses glass noodles instead of traditional rice noodles) and Sam Sahai chicken. The Bangkok pad thai was consistent with the first time I went and the Sam Sahai chicken was also very good, being crunchy but not overly greasy. It's also great that all their dishes can be customized for their spice level, especially for people like me who can't take lots of heat :P.   Overall, definitely recommend anyone to check this out and I hope that this little gem on the Danforth is here to stay!  Lactose Free Rating: they use coconut milk in all their currys!! (10/10)  P.S. Check in for a free thai iced tea :) it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Had their Bangkok Pad Thai made with stirfried glass noodle and weapped around an egg crepe, Tom Yum Soup, Chicken satay skewers and Pad Kra Kow (Stirfried beef with thai holy basil), and their Thai Milk Tea. Their Pad Kra Kow was slightly too salty for my liking but everything else was delicious. My friend who has been to Thailand also agrees the food here is amazing. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The food a great but the service is sooo slow. I keep  coming back for the food but keep regretting it every time I leave."}
{"text":"Finally great Thai in the Danforth/Greenwood area!! Yes, the service was slow, but the food was worth the wait! The Pad Khing was gingery and loaded. The Pad Thai was on the mild side, but the curry Pad Thai was a much more flavourful option. The Moo Ping skewers were tasty and you should definitely get them with the sticky rice. The Pad Gra Paow could have been spicier but it had plenty of awesome flavour. The mango sticky rice was by far the best I have ever had, good to the eyes and to the tastebuds. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"The dishes are a work of art and you almost tempted not take the first bite but the good food smell convinces you too. And as good they look they are delicious too! The service is genuinely friendly, welcoming and refreshing!"}
{"text":"I live quite far from Sala but the food and service were so good that I went twice in 2 weeks!  Although we are not Thai, my daughter and I have both spent some time in Thailand. We appreciate the friendly people, beautiful art and delicious food. We don't eat Thai food often in Toronto because it's not very authentic. Now that we have found Sala, we will be able to enjoy the fresh flavours again!   The dishes are both beautifully presented and expertly prepared. The first time, we ordered the Bangkok Pad Thai (thin omelette of yummy vermicelli) and the Massaman Curry. My daughter was excited since this type of curry is not usually offered by Thai restaurants in Toronto. It was delicious, slightly sweet and tangy. We loved the whimsical pyramid of jasmine rice.  On the second visit, I tried the battered zucchini flowers with a sweet and sour dipping sauce. They arrived piping hot, like a big edible bouquet. We also salivated over the Pad Kra Paow (chicken version, with fragrant Thai basil and green beans).   Mo and her husband are the proprietors. The pretty lady is so friendly and knowledgeable. Since her family runs a restaurant in Thailand, she has much experience in food and customer service.   Looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"Great service and food here. I love the Thai ice tea! Food is fresh and not to long of a wait. this place fills up quick. Would for sure come back."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely phenomenal. I was so impressed by their food! Not only is the presentation totally Instagram-worthy, but also the taste is just amazing. I liked every single dish we had - chicken and pork skewers, Bangkok pad Thai, khao soi, masaman curry, mango sticky rice and roti dessert. The roti dessert was breathtaking!!! Even after sharing all that with two other people, I feel like I could've still eaten another plate of the delicious pad Thai noodles. The service was also great - our server checked in once in a while and was extremely friendly. In terms of the decor, I wouldn't say it's any extremely special as it's your neighbourhood restaurant. Trust me, you will be so engrossed in your delicious food that you won't even notice your surrounding anyway."}
{"text":"Dropped by for lunch to see what all the excitement was about. Closed my eyes and stuck a pin in the menu and ordered the Bangkok Pad Thai. (I was wanting to try something different). Well it was definite that. A gelatinous mass with Way too much lime juice(I almost think it might have been vinegar) and Way too sweet. Everybody is raving about this place. Maybe I just had the luck to pick the one 'stinker' on the menu"}
{"text":"Visited this place recently and had a great time! The food was very flavorful, and the woman serving us was very nice and helpful.  We tried: shrimp chips, squash fritters, Pad gra pao, bangkok pad thai, and curry pad thai. They take extra care in the plating which I loved.  Loved the house chili sauce that came with the shrimp chips. The drinks were also very good - they even had fresh young coconut, and they can crack it open after you finish the drink so you can eat the flesh!"}
{"text":"Great service.  Free ice tea if you check in on social media.  Bangkok Pad Thai is made with glass noodle instead of rice noodle and wrapped in egg crepe.  I personally prefer rice noodle, glass noodle tastes more starchy and less chewy.  Taste is very authentic.    I went with my friend on a Tuesday day for lunch.  Plenty of seats available."}
{"text":"This is hands down my favourite Thai restaurant. I discovered this place not too long ago and i haven't found another place to beat it. The restaurant has very cute decor and the staff are all very friendly and attentive. The wait time for my food is never too long which is a total plus (especially if you're really hungry)  I ordered a Beef Pad See Ew and it was honestly delicious. There was a good portion and an even distribution of noodles and veggies. The noodles were nice and chewy, the beef was soft and tender and the veggies were stir fried just right so it wasn't too soft. It was extremely flavourful and it kept making me want more. It was honestly one of those dishes where you don't want it to end and when it does then you automatically know you need to come back.   The Thai iced tea is really good too!"}
{"text":"Came here with a group of friends for dinner... and we all had a good time... the food here is great... another great option for East Danforth!  We ordered: - Butternut squash fritters  -  Pad Gra Paow (Stir-fried with Thai holy basil served with steamed jasmine rice & topped with a fried egg) - Bangkok Pad Thai (Stir-fried with glass noodles with pad thai sauce wrapped in an egg crepe) - Thai green curry (vegan)  The butternut squash fritters were good, but a bit on the oily side.  The pad gra paow is really good, but beware, don't order it to be any level of spicy if you can't really take it... it gets pretty spicy!  The bangkok pad thai comes in a beautiful presentation and was also good.  Now the green curry, I didn't try it but my friend wasn't too impress.  overall, good place and will be back"}
{"text":"After finding out the owners of Sala are related to the infamous pai downtown, I knew I had to come. We came around 530 and managed to get a seat before the dinner rush on a Sunday night.   The store layout is standard traditional and the decorations were pretty average. However the dishes that were on the tables each looked beautiful individual pieces of art.   We ordered the Penang curry 2x spicy and the Bangkok pad thai 3x spicy. 20 minutes after ordering we were asked if we could move out of our table to allow a party of 4 to sit. We relocated to another spot in the restaurant and I thought it wasnt that much of a big deal.... However we waited almost another extra 45 minutes before the first dish came. It definitely felt like an hour of just sitting. We were worried that they completely forgot about us.. Eventually it became abit awkward between the waitresses and seeing how long we have been sitting with our empty tables.    I noticed around us, many of the other tables were waiting for their foods as well... many of the other tables were ordering the same dishes, primarily curries and the Bangkok pad thai as well.   I'm not sure why each of the dishes took so long. Nonetheless they tasted fairly good once they came. They both held incredible amounts of flavour and the spiciness was perfect and thank goodness the dishes were warm (not hot tho) when it came.   I am not sure if I would come back to this restaurant again but they do serve good Thai food. The service was nice and polite and the price was reasonable compared to some Thai locations downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"Great location at the heart of Danforth. There's a great atmosphere the second you walk in as the restaurant has homey decors and really exudes a Thai ambiance. The server was really nice, she recommended great dishes to us. There is also a free drink promotion by liking their social media. The Thai ice tea is amazing!! I definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Pretty good pad Thai, good level of sauce, and the noodles were nice and stringy, the green curry was good too, and the presentation was superb"}
{"text":"This is probably one of my new favorite Thai restaurant in the GTA. We made reservations and were immediately seated at a table. The restaurant is small, so make sure you avoid the dinner rush or make reservations! For drinks, we ordered the Thai ice tea and the Nom Yen (which is a blend of red salaca and condensed milk). These were all flavorful and not overly too sweet! For main dishes, we ordered Jean's coconut noodle and the Sala's pad Thai. I had the coconut noodle and it was full of coconut milk flavor."}
{"text":"The Bangkok pai thai was good but kinda too sweet in my opinion. We also ordered beef khao soi and the portion is pretty small compared to other Thai restaurants.   Overall service was good."}
{"text":"Very good, clean and tasty food. Solid Thai menu and very accommodating towards allergies and special requests. I would recommend this place to anyone in the area not wanting to go all the way downtown for good thai. The pad Thai and pad see ew were the highlights of our table. We will be for sure!!"}
{"text":"I tried the restaurant a couple times during the Grand Opening and the food was really good. They were quite busy when they opened so things were a tad slow, but I gave them five stars because the food is what matters most to me.  Since returning since it opened the food is still good, but they still don't seem to have their rhythm. The menu on the website is already outdated. The prices were 50 cents higher than what appears on the menu. On the phone we were told there was a 10% discount for cash on pick up orders, and when I picked up and paid cash no discount was applied. I also specifically said \"I will pay cash\". Hiccups like these can easily be avoided so I hope they sort themselves out."}
{"text":"Soooo good. I could eat here every day. Huge selection on the menu. I had the Bangkok pad Thai last week, and it was as beautiful to look at as it was to eat, what with the latticed egg cream and carrot flower. I asked for the tofu with it, and our server made sure I'd be okay with egg, which I appreciated. They're a short walk from Greenwood or Donlands TTC. They get busy, so if you go in peak hours you may want to make a reservation first."}
{"text":"Had to drop a star as I returned for a second dinner and I noticed some changes. Too bad as I likely won't be back any time soon. 1. No more shrimp chips on the house and it $5 now. Seriously? The chips tasted somewhat stale this time. 2. The portions felt smaller this time. Our app was smaller and I somehow left not really full. 3. The hot sauce went from a house made sweet and hot sauce to just plain Sriracha. Still friendly service. But in just a month it has lost some of the things that made this place unique and charming. Devils in the details."}
{"text":"My friend brought me here and I lovedddd it. My bf loves Thai food so I'm planning to come back with him. I wasn't expecting anything from here but they definitely blew it out of the water. The food was amazing and the service friendly and kind. It was Mother's Day when I came and I overheard the owner giving free mango sticky rice to all the mothers! Such a sweet and thoughtful gesture!!   I tried their Bangkok pad Thai which is unfortunately not the one photographed (they brought us the regular pad Thai in error but brought us the right one after) and it was bombbbbbbbbbb. The Bangkok pad thai uses glass noodles instead of rice noodles covered in a thin piece of egg crepe. The glass noodles soaked up all the sauce making it super tasty!"}
{"text":"The food is a little over rated. Personally I think The Bangkok pad Thai is not as good as the regular one. The curry is good. The mango sticky rice was good too but not great.  Not a fan of the red drink.   Good customer service tho and nice ambiance."}
{"text":"Legit Thai food on the east end finally! No need to make the trek downtown for some flavorful pad Thai.   Ive had the food here twice. First time was taken out on a week night, food was great, take out timing was fine.   2nd time was a Friday evening seated dining at around 530. The service was good but our food took forever to get out and one of our orders were wrong. I asked the waiter how long it'd take for them to fix the order and he told me frankly that it would be a long wait, so I just stuck with what they brought me. I think the place is still working out the kinks on a busy night. It looked like they were taking way too many take out orders and patrons were left waiting in the restaurant.   I will be ordering from them again in the future, but I hope the expediter can get ticket priorities sorted out soon."}
{"text":"An update to my previous review... We have come here more than a dozen times since it opened and it's our go-to neighbourhood spot for lunch or dinner. Always really delicious, and the staff is great! Favourite dishes of mine are the Khao Soi (rich and delicious) and the regular and street food versions of Pad Thai."}
{"text":"Long overdue post. I love this place so much that I go there every single week without fail. 1. The food is the best Thai I have ever had. Even better than what I have had in Thailand, LA or some of the places like Sukho Thai, etc. 2. Ambience and plating are excellent . Cozy space and the owner takes a great interest in beautiful presentation. 3. Service - Mo is a sweetheart. Even my 1 year old loves her. She is what every restauranteur should be like - warm, caring , and remembers her customers and treats them special. Mo also remembers how I like the dishes (extra spicy, dry, lime and chillies etc) 4. Prices are reasonable and they serve alcohol. I take all my special guests there . 5. My favourite dishes are - the pad kra Pao (holy basil beef with egg and rice), Sam sahai chicken (chicken with cashew nuts), the regular pad Thai , pork skewers, and the crispy squash fritters. Mmm getting hungry! I wish Mo and her restaurant all the success as they are truly doing a great job right from the food to the service. Thank you Mo! We love your food and service and are Sala Modern Thai lovers for life!!! No doubt 5 stars on all counts."}
{"text":"We tasted various starters, main course, and dessert offered by Sala Modern Thai. All of them just simply taste fantastic. We were also impressed by the plating and elegant presentations effort that were spent on each dish, which are at the level of fine dining restaurants.  Shrimp chips have always been our favourite but we must say that we had our best one from Sala Modern Thai. You can actually taste the shrimp flavor from the chips and they are perfectly fried. To top it off, there is also a house-made dipping, which is made from shrimp paste, soy sauce, and fish sauce. The dipping is little bit spicy but it is highly addicting. This is a must try dish!  The other highlight is definitely the Tom Yum Soup. This is nothing like the Tom Yum Soup we tasted before but it was a pleasant surprise. This is probably the way Tom Yum Soup should taste like on the street of Bangkok. It was richly flavorful, with mushrooms and herbs complementing the beef or chicken base. It is a spicy and sour medley in your mouth and a wonderful experience. Highly recommended for everyone.   Pomelo Salad is a good mix of mango, pepper, and other fresh vegetable. A great way to start your meal and build up the appetite.  Other starters include Crispy butternut squash fritters (served with tamarind sauce), and traditional Thai grilled pork skewers Moo ping.   When people think of Thai food, Pad Thai usually comes to mind. However, the Pad Thai we find on the market are usually altered recipe catered for the Western markets. However, Sala Modern Thai offers authentic Bangkok Pad Thai, which are common street food in Thailand. Glass noodles are used, which are much narrower than the usual rice noodles. You can choose between chicken, shrimp, or mix. The noodles and meat are fried with the tamarind sauce, and wrapped with egg crepe. It is sided with vegetables, peanuts, and chilli flakes. This is a definite winner, with sweet, salty, sour, and spicy flavor all mixed on one dish, cooked to the right doneness.  Khao Soi is another famous Thai dish done right at Sala Modern Thai. Khao soi is a northern Thai dish made with boiled rice noodles in a bowl of richly flavored curry like soup. The chicken is tender and curry was delicious and spicy.   Pad gra paow comes in chicken, pork, or beef. It uses Thai basil as the main ingredients and served with green beans, Thai chili and fish sauce, topped with an over-easy egg.  Mamasan curry beef is nicely done with beef braised to perfect tenderness. The curry sauce tastes good over anything and is super creamy It is served on a cutely triangle shaped white rice that looks like the Thai architecture.   Sala Modern Thai has several authentic Thai desserts on menu too. First there is the mango sticky rice. It is beautifully presents, with flower shaped mange slices on top of sweet sticky rice .  Thai roti pancakes are perfectly made with crispy pancakes stuffed with Nutella, banana, and topped with cream.   Drinks option include Thai iced tea, Thai coffee, and matcha drink. We recommend the Thai ice tea as it is very different than the other Chinese style milk tea or bubble tea. It is made from Thai sourced tea leafs and is very creamy and flavourful.   Overall we loved our experience at Sala Modern Thai and would definitely come back to fulfill our Thai food craving. Be sure to make reservation though as this place fills up quick!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place. It is a bit out of the way, and pretty far on the west end, but it will be a worthwhile visit.  The restaurant is not hard to find, but be mindful of their hours as they do have a break in between. Sala is not a large restaurant, so naturally seating will be hard to find if you come at peak hours. Servers are nice and courteous, and while you wait for your food, you get some nice shrimp chimps to munch on. They were surprisingly good and not the cheap, bland ones. Instead, they were very crispy, light, and flavourful. Almost like a dish itself.  Onto the good part. We ordered 4 dishes including dessert. We also ordered a thai iced tea (a must when eating thai food, which had too much ice here imo). Each dish was a good size for what they charge and to share, so you can order more food to try!  Pad kra paow, bangkok pad thai, mango salad, and mango sticky rice was on the menu. EVERYTHING was colourfully and beautifully put together, right down to the smallest details. It didn't look like anything was just thrown on the plate (if they did, then that's some skills there), instead, everything was presented neatly for the customer to feast their eyes upon.   Now the mango salad I could have passed; the tropical mangoes were refreshing but other than that there was no wow factor. I did hear the tom yum soup was pretty good though, so that might be a better option.  The rice and noodles were delicious! The bangkok pad thai is a bit different than your usual pad thai... it's actually more to my liking. There's less sourness, and has slightly different flavours incorporated. They also use glass noodles instead of the usual rice noodles, which soaks up extra sauce and flavour. The thin egg crepe was not only IG material, but also a nice rounded addition to the dish. In any way, the dish was still really good.   Now, the mango sticky rice was a bit deceiving... not that it wasn't good, but it's appearance gave it more points than its taste did. Like the other dishes, it was once again very colourfully decorated, especially with its mango rose arrangement and plate, but with the chocolate sauce drizzled over, I thought it gave the dish a weird finish...  Nonetheless, a delicious restaurant with courteous staff and a nice ambiance. Will return :)"}
{"text":"Friendly staff and gets packed on a Friday evening. My husband and I were lucky enough to get a table :)  We ordered their pad Thai and kuaytiew Tom yum. The pad Thai was a good portion with three large shrimps if you opt for \"mix,\" you get shrimps and chicken. Even at medium spice level, the pad Thai was overall a bit too sweet. The kuaytiew Tom yum which is pretty much Tom yum noodle soup has ok heat at spicy level. Again, the broth is a bit too sweet for my palate. It could've use some acidity like lime.   It's a nice touch that they serve you shrimp chips on the house. You can even ask for refills.  Overall, we loved their service, and we did enjoy the food even though it's a bit on the sweeter side. We will definitely try their other dishes!!"}
{"text":"There are a lot of generic Thai food restaurants out there, and, thankfully, Sala Modern Thai Kitchen & Bar is not one of them. Went with friends tonight, and we were all very impressed with the food and presentation. I had the Pad See Ew, which was delicious, and I could barely finish all the food. My only wish is that Sala was licensed! Not a deal-breaker at all, though. Sala is great addition to the neighbourhood. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Read about this place and was excited to have good Thai in the area, so I jumped at the chance to take my parents when they were in town - they spent significant time in Thailand, so they know good food when they find it.  They do not take reservations, which is fine. We were warmly greatest and seated promptly. The menu is smallish, and features pretty standard offerings for Toronto. We got mango salad and butternut squash fritters to share, and both were delicious.   My issue came up when it was time for the mains - my dad's came first, then a few minutes later, mine. But it took almost 15 minutes for my stepmum's plate. I saw other tables get served during this lull, and it was really frustrating. I don't know why they couldn't expedite the entire table at once so we could eat together. By the time her dish arrived, the other two were cold. It wasn't the experience you would expect from an experienced kitchen. It's a shame too, because the service was genuine and lovely. The room's ok, and comfortable enough.  I hope the owners make the necessary adjustment to their kitchen management. I'd love to be a regular, but it this is how it goes I'll just stick to takeout - from elsewhere."}
{"text":"We came here when it was busy and they quickly made space for a table for us. Their thai ice tea is also really good too"}
{"text":"I had the masaman curry and it was very authentic, very good with layers of exotic flavors. The restaurant environment is clean and modern and the host was very pleasant. My friend had a yellow curry with shrimp and it was very tasty with lots of shrimp."}
{"text":"What to try?  Their pad Thai and their curries.   I didn't get to try their pad Thais because I ordered two rice dishes instead by mistake. I really liked the curry dish we ordered - Kheaw Wan. I like my curries thick and flavourful, and they delivered just that. You definitely can't eat the curry on its own without rice or naan so it's good the curry comes with a tower of rice. That's right - a tower. Pretty cool! The pork skewer was good too. Pork shoulder meat was marinated and grilled to my liking. The tom yum soup was alright. It had quite a bit of ingredients in the soup but it didn't have the tom yum flavor I am used to at other Thai restaurants. Not as flavourful.   Last tip?  Make sure you try out their pad Thai. I didn't order it but I saw the other table have it. They serve it with a egg pancake on top of your pad Thai so you can mix it up at the table instead! Kind of different right?"}
{"text":"This restaurant opened only 5 weeks ago but it was packed today. Service and the food was amazing."}
{"text":"Nice cozy Thai restaurant on the Danforth. Staff are friendly and the food was great.   Our order: mango salad/khao Soi with chicken/ massaman curry beef/mango sticky rice/ Thai ice tea.  Mango salad was good - very refreshing and ingredients had a good balance of flavours.   Khao soi - you can choose from tofu, chicken, beef, and shrimp. We decided to go with chicken. I find the flavors to be too rich and the noodles were too mushy for my liking. The coconut curry was a bit spicy but I liked the level of spice but the mushy noodles were a turn-off.  Massaman curry beef - this was my favourite dish here. The curry wasnt spicy but the flavors were good and the beef was tender. The curry had potatoes and carrots which gave it a \"healthy\" aspect to this meaty dish.  Lastly, the mango sticky rice at the end of the meal was too filling. It was mellow in flavor and not sweet at all so it's good if you are not looking for something overly sweet.   I would come back and try other dishes next time. Personally, I think this place is better than Pai. This restaurant isn't as rushed and it seems like the chefs put more care in the quality of food that comes out of the kitchen.  With that said... this place isn't super busy but they still gave us the bill before we asked for it...AND we were not done eating our mango sticky rice. So not sure what happened there. If it wasn't for this mishap... I would have given this restaurant 5 stars."}
{"text":"Good food and ambiance!  Had Pad Thai and it was very delicious.  Service was quick and friendly.  Would come again."}
{"text":"have been wanting to go to this place for a while and even tried to order take-out but unfortunately, we lived just outside of their delivery range (this was before they partnered with foodora, doordash, and uber eats)  ended up picking up dinner from there yesterday and it was pretty good.  we got paneng curry, tom yum fried rice, fuk tong tod (butternut squash fritters), and mango sticky rice. definitely made me miss thailand.  will probably go back again and most definitely order take-out from them."}
