{"text":"The sushi is really good and tasty. The service is really good. I've never waited for more than 2 minutes and majority of the waiting is me trying to decide or other customers taking longer to pay. The staff are fast and friendly!! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Staff are super nice. Food is amazing. Tip: Order from the menu. They make it fresh for you. Try the red tiger. It's good and it's just the right amount of sushi for lunch. The volcano is also one for the books, plus the sushi pizza! This is my go to place for lunch! Fresh, healthy and quick!"}
{"text":"I'm weird about sushi.  My friends find it strange that I'd be willing to pay up for high-quality sushi, yet would also be willing to eat some not-so-awesome food court sushi.   What can I say?  It's another of my many addictions/food hobbies/exercise.  Um, I'm gonna try to pass off eating as an exercise at my next checkup on account of it works my tummy. Yep, sounds legit to me!  When my friends were talking about crappy food court sushi though, I don't think they meant Sushi Shop.  It's actually surprisingly decent for food court.  They don't try to disguise it as the authentic stuff, although it does carry some of the usual nigiri you'd see in an actual sushi place.  I'd skip those though, because while the fish is relatively fresh, you'll find it wholly unsatisfying.  The exceptions to this, in my humble opinion, are the seared syake (salmon) and seared izumidai, both of which are always delicious no matter how you torch it.   Unique fruit mixes and Japanese mayo options are the way to go for me, and I often enjoy the 5-piece Volcano Roll which mixes chopped raw salmon with \"spicy\" (in colour only) Japanese mayo followed by a good blast of the torch.  My mother favours the fruit combo ones, like the Magik Roll but I find them hit and miss as the mango availability season is short. At their peak sweetness though, I do enjoy these too.   Call ahead to book your order, allowing you to simply pick up from the second cash, else risk waiting for 20 minutes for your order to complete if ordering on spot."}
{"text":"Premade rolls and combos are all super fresh and delicious. Quality and freshness of sashimi is top notch and they always use deliciously ripe avocado.   HIGHLY recommend their new poke bowls with crispy rice - spectacular!"}
{"text":"Decent place for a good quick grad and go. There is a million of these places along the path all pretty much selling the identical thing.  I wonder if they all get their product from the same bulk vendor.   I the usual, dragon roll with some sort of sriracha mayo sauce spread decoratively across the top.   Good for what it is, but definitely not fine dinning"}
{"text":"There is better Japanese options in the area, the bento box I ordered was average at best. The main issue is the serving size , the price is reasonable but I'd pay more if they were more generous with the food."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING. Probably the best sushi I've had in Toronto (and I'm the biggest sushi snob ever). It's not to be confused with \"food court quality sushi\", which you would automatically assume it is since it is underground in the financial district). I would recommend ordering some of their specialty rolls (Diablo for the raw salmon lover, Black Mamba, and Teriyaki Bomb). They make it for you on the spot. Ingredients are always fresh, and the rice is on point (I think the quality of the rice and how it's cooked is so underrated in sushi!!). It's a bit pricey but worth every penny to treat yourself! My coworkers are also obsessed with this place and we make a sushi run about once every 2 weeks."}
{"text":"Wow, didn't expect this place to be so good. I ordered the salmon poke bowl through Ritual with the crispy white sticky rice (wasn't sure what it would be but had no high expectations). It came with a free miso soup which was flavourful and hot (bonus!) The rice was really crispy AND sticky which was a nice surprise, it went really well with the salmon and mayo. At first the portions look average but they use quality ingredients which really fills you up.   The price point is a bit more above regular food court choices, but when you are craving something above food court sushi I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Made the mistake of being to lazy to walk to my usual poke place.   This place (like most other fast food places in the downtown core) was way overpriced and left me hungry and unsatisfied. the service was fine, no line up at noon (which should have been my first clue). I opted for the seasoned salmon poke bowl (that says it includes: tempura, avocado, orange masago, cucumber, lettuce, green onion, ponzu sauce, spicy light mayo, Japanese mayo, teriyaki sauce, Japanese spices, sesame, nori, choice of white/brown rice...all good stuff) but I swear all I could taste was bland fish, avocado, wet rice, and an abundance of lettuce covered in mayo (see picture)   I paid $14 for this small poke bowl, and I didn't even end up finishing it.   Wont be making the mistake of coming back here again. Back to the Poke Box for me."}
{"text":"I have been to the Brookfield location twice and I didn't find much difference between the two. I ordered the Spyder Roll and Red Tiger roll- both were delicious and very filling for lunch. You get free miso soup if you spend over $10, which is quite easy here.   For the two rolls, my total came up to $25.88 including tax. Quite a bit more than I would like to spend on lunch, but tasty nonetheless!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the sushi here! If you ever have a craving for sushi during lunch, Sushi Shop is your best bet for decent quality fresh sushi. I appreciate the fact that the sushi rolls are not majority rice, the salmon, avocado, and whathaveyou ratio to the rice is just right.  I picked up a pre-assembled box of sushi when I visited and I really enjoyed it! I was also impressed by the ingenuity of the soy sauce container because it is large enough to comfortably fit an entire sushi in there!  There was also a huge menu with an overwhelming amount of items to choose from, which (I assume) the chefs in the background make on the spot. I have not tried their specialty items on the menu but will be returning sometime in the future to do so."}
{"text":"It is so hard to find tuna tartar for a quick take out! Guess what! This place has it and they make it for you once you order it. I love tuna tartar, even though it wasn't the best I have had, it is still good quality and very delicious!   The tuna tartar was a palm size portion for around $10, and because your purchase is over $10 you also receive a free miso soup. The tuna tartar has tempura bits in it to give it some crunch and the whole thing was wrapped with a cucumber slice.   I enjoyed my tuna tartar will definitely get it again to calm my sashimi cravings!"}
{"text":"This is one of the better Japanese takeout places in the PATH. I'd recommend calling in for your order before coming to pick it up if you're in a rush, since it took 5-10 minutes for my order to be ready despite not much orders. This is because they make the sushi right when you order instead of it being pre-packaged.  I tried one of their new ramen offerings - miso ramen $9.99. You have to add a dollar or two for chicken/seafood/beef.  I wouldnt get this again.. Obviously this does not compare to the legit ramen places like Santouka, Kinton etc.. The noodles were kinda hard and instant noodley. Soup was not very flavourful - it just tasted like miso soup that I make from powder form. There weren't that many toppings either .. Bean sprouts, the dried tofu puffs, bamboo shoots. Overall just not good enough for my money's worth.  I tried out their sushi as well, and that, on the other hand was good and fresh! Hence the three stars. They also have quite interesting fusion sushi that I would try next time I have to work late in the office. They even have dessert!"}
{"text":"I almost gave up on buying food court sushi until I discovered \"Sushi Shop\".  The sushi here is delicious especially the rolls.  My favourite is the \"Cherry Blossom\" which has a really nice mix of crabmeat, fish eggs, shrimp, cream cheese wrapped with rice paper instead of seaweed.  You might find it strange to have rolls wrapped with rice paper but it's actually really tasty.  Although it's in a food court, the prices are a bit expensive.  You'll easily end up paying about $15 including taxes.  They do give you free miso soup.  I also just recently tried their Salmon Poke bowl and it's delicious.  I think that I can eat this everyday.  It's a mix of a good portion of salmon and avocado with tempura chips seasoned perfectly on rice.  So yummy!"}
{"text":"When I do not have the time, I usually grab my lunch here. It is right below my office and I love the fact that they have already packaged combos which are perfect for the grab and go.   The service here is great, I find that I usually still have to wait in the line up for my ritual order, there's only a small aisle inside where there is the line up and to pick up the orders.   There's a couple of things that I love getting. I'm a huge fan of their salmon tartare wrapped in their rice paper roll. The sesame dipping sauce is a great pairing with the tartare and is less than 7 bucks. Super filling and delicious if you want to skip on the rice. I also love their shrimp tempera.   The quality of their sushi is great, except their avocado rolls can be a hit or a miss. I find that it's mostly not ripe when I order them and I end up throwing them out. But when it is ripe, it's soooooooo goood.   Happy Eating fellow Yelpers!"}
{"text":"They get 3 stars because their food is either a hit or miss depending on the day. I ordered ramen and tempura shrimp and I cant decide which had the least flavour the TWO shrimp was luke warm, greasy and more batter than shrimp.   Not to mention they have a penchant for putting rotting avocado in their rolls. What I will say is I like their long time staff, they have great customer service I just wished the quality of the food matched the price."}
{"text":"This sushi shop has literally become my daily go-to for lunch in the financial district. The crispy  spicy salmon maki is so so good! There's not too much rice which I appreciate, and some tasty crunchy cucumber, and a good amount of salmon. I usually don't ever buy food court sushi, but this place is the best."}
