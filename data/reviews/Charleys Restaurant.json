{"text":"The food was just okay.  Our waitress was friendly when she was around but was mostly elsewhere.  There are too many restaurants with superior service and food to come back here."}
{"text":"We went to dinner on Saturday the 11th around 7:15pm.  I thought the place was kind of empty but figured we'd get better service.  I was correct. Our waiter was very helpful, telling us about specials and helping us choose between a couple of items on the menu.  My husband had some kind of steak and peppers and he was pleased with the taste, if not the portion.  I had the lobster ravioli and was surprised at the extras in the sauce.  If you really think about portion, what they serve is appropriate to what we should be eating.  We spoke to one of the new owners, and she said they were doing a lot more things from scratch and had added a few things to the menu.  There is a special on sangria on Saturday nights right now.  We had a pitcher (carafe) and it was marvelicious!  Also happening right now are half price entrees on Tuesday and half price wine on Wednesday.  All in all a nice place to eat."}
{"text":"This is the Charley's that used to be in Southpark back before all the rennovations and expansion of the mall. When they first moved to Cotswald, I was very disappointed with the food and service at the new location. However, they are now one of my regular lunchtime places. The place can get really busy at lunch and so the service can really be hit or miss. But they do many things really well, so we keep going back. First off, if you like French Onion soup with lots of cheese and puff pastry, this is the place for you! I will warn you, this stuff is addictive! I also recommend their New England Clam Chowder. They make theirs without bacon, so its one of the few places in town that I can actually enjoy the clam chowder. They have excellent salads - my favorites here are the Dave's Nutty & Spicy Chopped Salad or the Asian with Sesame Seared Tuna. The pastas are usally pretty good if you are in the mood for carbs. The only disappointments I have had were specials which either were not adequately described or the server just didn't know about. If you happen to save room for dessert, I personally love their Almond basket with Pralines & Cream ice cream and vanilla custard with raspberry & chocolate swirls.
UPDATE 2011: NOW CLOSED."}
{"text":"Not even sure this place is even worth reviewing - I thought I'd wait on my review until I took a breath to get over the worst service I have had in a restaurant in the last ten years.

As a former waitress/bartender - I was in this industry over ten years and I have a lot of patience when it comes to service - but this was just ridiculous.  I give this place 3 more months and it will be gone for good.

What really sucks is that I was really looking forward to a big improvement from the previous Charleys. Hoping to have a decent place to grab food and drinks in the neighborhood urgh...

So back to the service after ordering an appetizer that the waiter raved about  - the appetizer never came instead we were presented by the waiter with Calamari - how can you not tell the difference between fried green tomatoes and Calamari?  I asked the waiter if perhaps the Calamari was for another table if not we would be happy to eat it instead of what we ordered so it didn't go to waste.  Nope the waiter came back giggling isn't it weird I actually rang in Calamari - no I don't think its weird I think you should listen better and if you were a good waiter you would have taken care of your mistake...The waiter must have walked by 10 times without refilling drinks and the place was completely empty.  Dinner was ok nothing great my belly was full and I got over it....but the next night my neighbors want to go up to Charleys because on Fridays it $1 beer night at least it was $1 beer night....yup my neighbors had been going up there for the last 3 weeks for $1 beer night and as soon as we show up they tell us they stopped the special...hmmm strange wonder why the place was yet again empty on a Friday night at dinner time..

Yes one more time I order the fried green tomato appetizer that I ordered the night before but this time my food just never came ...everyone who ordered 15 minutes after me had there food but mine never came and once I could actually find the waiter they said they would check on it and blamed it on the kitchen....at least 40 minutes after I ordered the owner delievers my food no apology nothing hey not even silverware...yup this place is definitly not getting my business again... and sorry I don't like to write reviews like this but customers should be warned."}
{"text":"I really want to give this place a good review because I used to love it so much, but after my last experience there I just can't.  Last time I went I ordered the quiche and some tomato bisque.  The quiche I ordered was rubbery and bland and the soup was inedible- it tasted like some sort of solvent or something.  When our waiter came back to ask us how things were he didn't seem to notice that I hadn't eaten any of my food, and took it away without asking me what was wrong or if I would like anything else.  Now that said, during my previous trips there I always enjoyed the Southern Fried Sandwich and theTurkey Cobb salad."}
{"text":"I went on grand opening night so I won't comment on service since they were slammed.  With that said the food here is \"ok.\"  Initial impressions: over priced and mediocre.  I'd give it 2.5 stars.

I ordered the fish and chips, again it was ok.  The serving size was very small for $13, three small pieces of fish and a plate full of steak fries.  The fish wasn't crispy but soggy... and the french fries were a tad depressing.

My wife ordered the tortellini, again just ok.  I'm pretty sure they bring it in frozen, but the olive oil sauce they dressed it with was great.

Charleys was a great place to try once, but I don't think we'll be going back."}
{"text":"Ok...as much as I want to love this place and I keep going in hopes of it being amazing, it just isn't. My neighbors and I live very close to Charley's so when we heard that on Friday night's draft beer was $1 we all met there after work. For 2 weeks we met there for the Friday Happy Hour special, the service and food was not great but it was worth it for the beer special. However on the 3rd Friday we were told that they were no longer going to be doing that special, but they didn't tell us till after we all ordered or drinks!  Well...since the food was not great and the service was even worse there was really no reason to go there anymore... so when the special stopped he stopped going. 

Since Charley's is so close to my house my husband and I decided to give it one more shot, my husband got the wrong food and the beer was warm...not OK! Needless to say that is the last time we have been to Charley's and do not plan to go back."}
{"text":"So, I'll start with the fact that I really, really wanted to like Charley's since it's only a mile from our house. We'd tried it when we first moved to Cotswold four years ago and were very disappointed in the food so never went back. Needless to say, we were very much looking forward to the the grand (re)opening, and now that I'm over the shock, here's an overview of the experience:

The good - our server was quite good; attentive without being overbearing, recommended some dishes, refilled beverages in a timely fashion, etc. There was no wait (you'll see why) and parking wasn't an issue.

The bad - our food was horrible, and the best way to describe why is the over abundance of SAUCE on everything. My boyfriend got a margarita pizza and I swear that when they brought it out all you saw was the pizza sauce and a few pieces of fresh mozzarella ovals. When I tried the sauce it was quite close to the taste of ketchup. I ordered the three cheese tortellini and the few vegetables and pieces of pasta were effectively drowning in sauce to the point that I had to dab each piece on a side plate to remove some sauce before eating it. We started our meal with a chicken quesadilla that was very bland, but ended up being the best part of the meal.

Not sure if the bar has anything better to offer in terms of adult beverages, but honestly, we won't be back to try it out."}
