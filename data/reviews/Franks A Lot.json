{"text":"Solid dogs.

Friendly service.

Great variety.

Wish they were open longer, but that's ok! ;)"}
{"text":"This crew puts together a symphony of taste!  Always fresh, always just how I was craving it.  Their Chicago Dog with the little chillies added is my favorite.  Fries are great, too!

They are open only for lunch, and have only outdoor seating, which can be a problem in the warm months.  Shade awning provides good shade, and they have misters.  Also, the parking lot just north of them is a new way to access the Humane Society animal shelter on the other side of the block that's been there for years.  My group had a hot dog, and then we went over and said Hi to the kitties.  I just might go back there today and take Tiger Lilily home...  Those dogs put me in a great mood, ready to conquer the whole rest of the day!  Crazy little birdies come and eat your french fries, too, in case you can't eat 'em all!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food, great prices, cash only but totally worth it! The staff is very friendly too."}
{"text":"Tasty spot by the airport. Had the Chicago Dog, a chili dog (Beenie Weenie) and a drink for under $10. Fast and friendly. Perfect for a quick bite on your way to catch a flight. No dining room though, so it can get pretty hot, even with the misters going"}
{"text":"CASH ONLY. I have a problem with establishments that refuse to accept the modern methods of paying for products and services. There are plenty of other local Hotdog stands that provide a large selection weenies without being debit card weenies. 
. 
I don't carry cash for security reasons. Especially in an area that is near the neighborhoods around 32nd Street and Van Buren which has the highest murder rate in the state. And I absolutely do not want my wife carrying cash. It appears that the company could care less about the customers' security. I would gladly pay a debit card fee for the product. 
. 
I will not be returning to this establishment."}
{"text":"Good quality dogs.  I got two of the regular sized -- Chicago and chili cheese.  Both tasted great, but they aren't huge dogs.  $6 for the pair, which is about fair, I'd say.  As others have noted, the buns are great.

Really friendly service.

I'll definitely go again if I'm in the neighborhood, but it won't be a destination in and of itself."}
{"text":"We were killing time before boarding a flight at Sky Harbor and found FranksALot purely by chance. Since we were on a Southwest flight, we were guaranteed not to be fed. I developed a sudden hankering for  a hot dog. Franks filled the bill in spade. Great beef dogs we ate in perfect winter weather while dreading our return to the cold weather of Washington DC. Thank you Norm of Channel 70 for the treat. The next one is on me."}

{"text":"Not a bad find.  Had the Golli Whopper (footlong with chili and cheese), the Chicago dog and the Yoddler with fries.  Golli whopper was good, nothing special about it though.  The hotdogs themselves seem to be regular dogs, again nothing special.  Toppings on Chicago dog are what make the Chicago dog, it was delicious.  Yoddler was ok, lots of cheese (but what can I expect when I order a hotdog covered in Swiss?).  Fries were excellent.  Reminded me of $10 amusement park fries that make you think \"those were great, but $10!?\", and luckily you don't have to pay that price.  Overall pricing was very reasonable, staff was friendly.  Be aware though, CASH ONLY.  We showed up with just a credit card and luckily saw an ATM across the street at the Community College.  Outdoor seating only, but with a slight breeze and misters it was quite comfortable.  Will probably try the cheesesteak next time we go, and yes there will be a next time."}
{"text":"Should be listed as \"Franks A Lot\". Great food. Great service. I have been a customer for years. 
Hot dogs, cheese steaks, fries. Good variety and prices."}
{"text":"Wow. What a find. Great Chicago style hot dogs! Jumbo and foot longs great too. My son said best fries he's ever tasted.  Hours m-f . CASH ONLY. atm across street at gateway community college.. no Italian beefs, though. Outside eating, with misters. Clean eating area, so bugs werent an issue. Nice people running it today. 
1st time here, and we will be back."}
{"text":"Great little hot dog stand in a strange location (you'll get it when you stop in). Great prices, friendly people, cash only, and good food.

This place is down the street from one of my offices so I stopped it for a Chicago Dog, great hotdog and great fries! 

What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"I first went to this place back in 1982 and nothing has changed (well the owners once).  Friendly folk run it, more than reasonable pricing (unlike Teds) and the food itself is incomparable.  I've been hooked on those Italian Sausage sandwiches forever.  One time I went there and they were out of them so they talked me into trying their spicy hot dog (which was pretty good) for FREE.  Nuff said."}
{"text":"I must have driven past Franks A Lot one hundred times before I ever thought to give it a chance.  Franks is on the east side of the road that becomes, airlane, right behind the airport.  As I take airlane to work every morning to avoid a few lights, I kept seeing Franks and finally decided to try it for lunch.  

What can I say? A solid hot dog, great price point and an EXTREMELY friendly staff. I haven't pegged if its a family running it from front to back, but I think it is and let me say, they do it well.  There is a drive through as well as basic patio seating.  Make note, they only take cash, but don't worry your lunch wont be more than six or seven dollars anyways.  

Their specialty is the Chicago dog, which is covered in onion, celery salt, sports peppers, and tomatoes.  Grab a side of their freshly made french fries and you are out the door, loving life.  Their menu extends to service polish sausage, cheese fries and even a philly cheese steak, but I have remained loyal to my Chicago dog....for now.  

If you happen to find yourself in the area, I say check it out."}
{"text":"Loved it!  The only thing that is missing is an ocean or lake view and a cold beer. Friendly and very fast service. My fries were very good. Crispy and screaming hot. It was my first Chicago dog so I don't know how it compares. I'll probably try a cheesesteak there sometime."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! The food is great and so inexpensive! The staff is always so nice and it's super clean. I'll probably become a regular haha"}
{"text":"Great service , quick service, and great tasting. Just dont like the price and the hours kind of suck. Oh and cash only. Which is great if you are the resercted George Washington, or Abe Lincoln."}
{"text":"You could easily drive by and never take notice of this little hot dog shop on the corner of 40Th st and Thomas. Sitting across from Gateway Community College and Phoenix Park N Swap it caters to the early eaters and industrial area lunch time crowd, a very clean and quaint setting they have covered outdoor seating only with misters and some tunes for atmosphere. 

The food itself is classic and timeless, Vienna wieners and all manner of Sausage, grilled cheese (with or without ham) and even burgers more akin to homemade than any fast food affair. You can get a foot long, Chicago style, smothered in cheese or chili or both if you like, bacon? they will put it on anything. The fries are delicious and you can get those manipulated to further along your artery problems if you so wish(cheese,bacon,chili!).

Great service from a \"mom and pop\" crew who have been at this for years, daily specials and fair prices make this a stop for lunch you will not regret."}
{"text":"Not bad for what it is, I had their Chicago style dog and it was fantastic. Fresh bread and good condiments. I think I just might have to make a few more stops and try some of their other foods they have to offer. If you are coming down for lunch I recommend calling in your order or getting there before noon, because from the looks of it you may be spending some time waiting to order."}
{"text":"They have terrific daily specials here

Great hot dogs, burgers, Italian sausage, and Philly cheesesteaks 
My favorite is the Fiesta which is made up of steak, cheese, tomatoes, jalape√±os, and Parmesan cheese... It is very yummy. 
I usually get a regular fries to go with it as well... 
The prices are very decent here and it is a CASH ONLY place... So keep that in mind...

The service here is great as the employees are very friendly, fast, and helpful...
It's a small stand so I'm guessing only 3-4 people work here and each of them are very nice..."}
{"text":"Make sure you take cash. Cash only place!

Hot dogs are really great, be warned it is a sit down place but its like outside sit down with flies, nice little shade (trailer patio? is that a thing?) But worth it.

I loved it. I love the food... even if there were flies trying to fight me for it."}
{"text":"I made a solemn promise to my Yelp buddy, lain b., that I would give Franks Alot a try this week...well, it wasn't so much a solemn promise as more of a \"if I happen to be in the neighborhood at lunchtime I will try to get by\"...happily for me, it all worked out today:)

I had the traditional Power Yoga class at the Village today (the class was brutal today...with a capital \"BRU\"... but I toughed it out:)

After class, I needed something...something...what can retox your system any better than that big dose of unidentifiable beef parts that are first ground into a slurry and then soaked in nitrates that I like to call a \"Vienna All Beef Wiener\":)???

Almost nothing, that's what (with the possible exception of unblended, 24 year old, highland malt scotch whiskey...but I am still working this afternoon...so hot dog it is:)

I motored down 40th, past LGO, I saw the Chicago Hamburger sign beckoning off to my right, all wanting my business, all tasty and singing to me as I passed by, but I pressed on to my goal!

I was almost on the runways at Sky Harbor before I finally found this place...it's a long way down 40th:)

I don't get to this part of town very often...not really much for me to do here, but even though it's a schlep, I can see it becoming a hot dog destination.

From first glance, you can tell that Franks Alot is a hot dog joint...drive through or walk up...cash only sign...no inside seating (although it was nice eating on the covered patio with the misters going and classic rock over the acoustically impaired speakers...made me feel like I was 17 again and sitting outside at Luke's in Monmouth...right down to \"Spirit in Sky\" warbling away at me:)

I gotta agree with lain...Franks Alot makes a good hot dog!

I had 2 foot longs, just to see what these wieners are made of (oh wait...I remember now...beef parts slurry, etc...see above:)

They steam the Vienna All Beef Wieners (I just like writing wiener as often as possible:), serve them in warm fluffy poppy seed buns (I don't have to worry about the drug tests...drug use is encouraged for software developers:)...they have celery salt to sprinkle on your wiener (insert joke here:) which is almost always worth a star!

They've got a lot (probably where the name comes from) of different sausages at Franks Alot...the special today was a polish sausage, and they have brats, red hots, etc.

They do chili dogs, Chicago style, bacon wrapped...you know...all the healthy options:)

I might even try one of those variations one of these days.

But for now, I'm happy with the good old standby...the foot long hot dogs!

$8.55 for 2 foot longs and barrel of diet coke...that's more than $3.00 less than Ted's for the same thing...and I didn't have to wait in line for 45 minutes:)"}
{"text":"What a great gem this place is! But cash only?! What a let down.... Had to go to circle k down the road to grab some cash. I love that this place is open earlier then most lunch spots(9:30), it's good for an early lunch in and out! Drive through! I took a look inside the place, and it is super duper clean, very impressive for a hole in the wall place like this. Very nice and sweet staff, fast service. Great fast food! It's too bad they don't have foot longs anymore. Great value for the price, I will be back! Don't forget cash!"}
{"text":"I'm originally from Chicago and always on the lookout for anything that reminds me of home.  This is one of those places!

Great service, cash only and rarely a crowd.  Only problem is they close mid afternoons.  

Great hot dogs, burgers, Italian sausage and Philly cheese steaks.  Their fries are also some of the best I've tasted in Phoenix.

Covered seating (benches) outdoors and self serve condiments."}
{"text":"Great food, great service! And prices and specials are good as well. Try them out if you like a mom and pop hot dog stand, they have burgers and grilled cheese too."}
{"text":"Open air hot dogs and burgers. I have driven by this place many times over the years but never stopped. Actually I never noticed the place. 
We were in the area and was looking for a place to get a quick bite. Found it on Yelp. Stopped by for a burger and a hot dog for my wife. Seating is out side and the day was a little cool but comfortable enough to be sitting outside. 
I really like going to these local owned places but all to often they are disappearing which is a shame.
Our food was good and much better than the chain burger places. 
The person that waited on us was very nice and helpful.
Stop buy when you are in the area. Support your local businesses."}
