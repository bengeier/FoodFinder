{"text":"My friend suggested me this place , i placed a takeout order here the food was amazing , the dragon chicken was awsome , for sure ill be back ."}
{"text":"Tried going today for the first time. I got there four minutes after three and the lady behind the counter refused to let me have a lunch special which goes until 3 pm. There was no one in there and you would think in the name of good customer service you would let four minutes slide. I didn't even bother getting anything in the end after reading the poor reviews of the food I didn't want to pay dinner prices for something I could have had four minutes earlier for less money."}
{"text":"I order from here everytime ever since the Chinese food place closed down in Karol Bagh. That place used to be amazing and I was worried I would have to travel farther for food. This place had my hopes up again. I have tried their veggie Hakka noodles, a bit spicy but great. I hope they lower the spicyness and cut the veggies a bit smaller as some of them are huge. They have fortune cookies free of charge which is great. The chilli chicken is my favourite to have with the noodles. You can get dry or gravy, but I prefer gravy. I mix them in with the noodles. The mechurian chicken is great too. I tried the veggie one but as a non veg, I didn't like it as much. My friends and family who are veg enjoy eating it. The place is clean but the washroom is dirty. The staff are nice.  You get a discount for pick up if you're paying in cash by like 10%. I don't think they do delivery anymore."}
{"text":"Someone suggested this place so decided to order take-out; Sweet Chilli garlic chicken, Dalchini special fried rice, Manchow soup and Manchurian chicken noodles. I found the prices to be a little more expensive than similar Hakka places in the Peel area. The bags seemed really heavy when I carried them away so the quantity is good. I was disappointed with the quality though, I found them a little too stingy with the meat (chicken) and vegetables in their dishes. The containers were filled to the brim with rice and noodles but had miserly amounts of chicken and vegetables in those dishes. The Sweet Chilli chicken was way too sweet for my taste buds. May return in the future for the Dalchini fried rice or if they have lunch specials."}
{"text":"Located in a South Indian plaza, brampton. The Hakka food is good with the portions and price offering. I got the chicken corn soup with spicy garlic w/ steamed rice. There are better Hakka places, but because it's a short ride from my house I visit it on the occasion."}
