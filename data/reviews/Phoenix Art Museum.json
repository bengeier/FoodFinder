{"text":"I recently moved back to Phx and visited the museum several times on free (with donation) Wednesday nights.  I really liked what I saw:  the Anne Bonfoy Taylor exhibit was stunning, all the great new contemporary pieces, the depth of their permanent collection, the Phillip Curtis paintings and the new Mexican modern paintings show.  I got a membership and plan to go often!  Also really like the restaurant and gift shop, and the museum is a must-do for out-of-town visitors."}
{"text":"Great place. You gotta see the exhibit on 20th century art. Post Mao paintings are eye opener. Don't miss the video on the couple who collected them. It explains a lot. The exhibit on artists who were influenced by major modern artists like Picasso, Rivera, Kahlo- another don't. The regular modern art exhibit is also a great collection"}
{"text":"The pieces and displays were intriguing. I stayed for over 4 hours. My favorites were the Firefly room and the entire Samurai collection. The facility is clean and spacious, the staff is courteous, and I definitely want to come back"}
{"text":"After reading so much about this museum, I was really excited to finally visit the museum and view the exhibit.  The building is impressive and full of interesting art.  Unfortunately, I felt extremely uncomfortable during my stay.  The staff watch you like a hawk and monitor every move you make.  They walk around making sure you do not touch anything and give you glaring looks if you even think about getting too close to a painting or sculpture.  I asked one of the staff if there was a problem and they didn't respond.  I do not recommend bringing kids to this museum otherwise they will face the wrath of museum staff."}
{"text":"The architecture is just as pleasurable as the art. The building is almost like a playground trying to explore all the floors.  The museum does a great job of representing a diverse collection especially for Phoenix being such a young city compared to the east coast.  There is a fair mix of Contemporary, European, Southwest, and traveling exhibitions.  My favorites right now are:   Mass by Cornelia Parker Chuck Close's portrait tapestry  You Who are getting Obliterated in the Dancing Swarm of Fireflies by Yayoi Kusama.  Wednesday nights are also free (voluntary donation) from 3-9pm [Courtesy of SRP]  Also went Easter Sunday and got in for free as Bank of America let's their customers in for free the first FULL WEEKEND of the month.  Nice little perk.  Would like to see more corporations and entrepreneurs donate to help the collection grow.  Hard to develop funds when so many people in the city have ties to the midwest or east coast then make their donations back east.  Downtown is a great time to invest as it's growing by leaps and bounds right now."}
{"text":"I have always loved the Phoenix art museum and remember seeing many exhibits there on class field trips! I guess I'm a grown up now, but I still like to go when they put something new up. Right now the front hallway is covered in black paper butterflies, which is so cool! I also still love going into the room with all the twinkling lights and pretending I'm in space (If you ask the museum staff for the twinkling light room they will know what you're talking about!). The art museum was a fun part of my childhood and is still an interesting place to be.  The best times to go are Wednesday nights, when the museum is free, and First Fridays, when the art museum comes to life with the art walk population!"}
{"text":"I love the new PAM! Every time I visit I am reminded of what a cool Museum this is. I am so pleased with the remodel completed recently, and am proud of Phoenix for such a cool space. We went most recently to see a lecture by Andres Serrano who was brought to Phx by Eric Fischl. The talk was fun, and inspiring! I also go here on occasion to see Nearly Naked Theater which calls a theater here home."}
{"text":"I love any art and cluture and being so close to downtown I try to soak up as much as I can. I would love to see the Phoenix Art Museum do more with and to support local artists. There are so many talented people from Phoenix, Sedona, Jerome.....all over the state. Why not celebrate them? I'd love to see more locals!!"}
{"text":"Wow they have so many different exhibitions in one building.  They are very interesting too. You should at least visit this place once if you live in greater phoenix :)"}
{"text":"My dear love and I went to the museum on a romantic date, and had such a lovely time. I hadnt been to the museum in years and it was a lot of fun to see some paintings I remembered from my childhood like the Frida Kahlo. They firefly room is utterly transporting as well. Frankly, I dont know if it was the art or my dear love that made the evening so wonderful, but we will go again soon. I strongly recommend a strolling date here. Wednesdays and maybe one other night are free. Oh and here's a tip-if you cant find a space, park across the street at the Viad Tower. Its free if you exit from the north side."}
{"text":"Spent a late afternoon here on a rainy day-probably one of the few rainy days in Phoenix! The art exhibits were very nice. I especially enjoyed the firefly exhibit and the European art hall. Very impressive collection. The otherwise very classy experience and exhibits were unfortunately almost destroyed in the last 15 minutes of the day by the attendants, who paraded around with their walkie-talkies volume turned up. It was to let us know that the museum was getting close to closing, but unfortunately we had to listen to all the other banter for the entire last 15 minutes of the day. Nothing like noise pollution to destroy and attempt to contemplate fine art.  How about gaining a pleasant sounding bill instead? Leave the talking inside the walkie-talkie. Treat the patrons in a respectful manner rather than like a mob."}
{"text":"We went to see the Hollywood Show that is a special exhibit on your from London. The exhibit was amazing. They had hundreds of costumes from so many movies and the stories behind each one. I loved seeing all the details up close. This exhibit runs through July 6th check it out if you have time you won't regret it."}
{"text":"I love this place.  I especially love it on Tuesdays when it's free.   I have been to many lectures, openings and films at the Museum and am always fascinated.    The changing photography exhibit is always fantastic.  The fashion room is one of my favorite features.  BUT my favorite piece is the firefly installation.  I could seriously live in that room. I take everyone I know and everyone is always as mesmerized as I am, and I have seen it many times.  I love the new contemporary wing of the museum.  I also love the glass boxes on the sides of the building.  One time we were there during a thunderstorm and sat in the glass box and watched the lightening.  It was perfect!    The museum always makes me happy."}
{"text":"It makes me sad to see that so many people are surprised that Phoenix has an art museum, let along a good one.   Why wouldn't we have great places where you can just wander around looking at stuff all day in the air-conditioning?  Did you think we only offered malls for that?  That being said, the Phoenix Art Museum has really done a nice job of making it interesting for those of us escaping the heat.  They have some great installations (the firefly one is a must!) and some amazing paintings by artists that you likely know.    Often, they also showcase some regional collections (cowboy/western exhibit) or offer exhibits featuring some historical AZ reference - currently running is the Frank Lloyd Wright exhibit & Historical AZ photography exhibit.  Those are what you keep you coming back.  The sculpture garden is awesome too when the weather is nice.  The restaurant onsite also boasts local foods, wines & beers which is an awesome experience for both natives and tourists alike.  Most of us from here are clueless to the what AZ can really bring to the table, literally.  The Museum sits on what was once the Phoenix Public Library and Phoenix Children's theater.  I have fond memories of the card catalogs and microfilm adventures there after school.  And on the weekends, Grandma would bring us the children's theater for a shows put on by The Cookie Company.  The best part were the Oreo cookies and carton of milk they handed out after the show (not just a clever name).  Some of my favorite memories - thanks for letting me share."}
{"text":"Very nice collection of 21st modern art. It would be great to see more from the New York School or the Post Impressionist period,but, I cant be to picky. Big thanks to Laurie and Drew Brown for the contribution of the modern wing."}
{"text":"Love the fashion exhibits. The lingerie exhibit was brilliant with a thoroughly excellent tour by the fabulous curator herself. Can't wait to see more when they get a bigger space."}
{"text":"TRICK OR TREAT. Get drunk and go to the museum. They won't kick you out if you get in before the doors lock. I have to agree wif everyone else that the tours are spectacular.The place is great to bring out of town visitors for a real dry taste of the desert. The operators of the museum are smarty pants sometimes, though. etc."}
{"text":"A fantastic museum with a friendly staff and a wide variety of engaging and interesting art.  With water fountains galore, and extremely adequate air conditioning, what a great way to escape the treacherous Phoenix sun and take in some culture."}
{"text":"Love this museum! Amazing touring exhibits and love the permanent exhibit on the second floor. And rounding out the day with refreshments at Palette is always worthwhile!"}
{"text":"I love the Phoenix museum. I always take friends and family even if they are not that excited about art. I feel you have something for everyone. My 80 year old grandmother said she felt like a child again in the \"fireflies\" exhibit. My photographer father was blown away by the Ansel Adams exhibit and my 15 year old niece (and you know how teenagers ...are) wanted to move in. My husband and I have a strange fascination for that green talking thing downstairs. We really love that they participate in the culture pass program. I really think the guards are friendly and knowledgeable. Just writing about it makes me want to go! They are free on First Fridays and have lots of really cool stuff going on. Music, dancing, etc. Kids love it too, but be sure they can behave!"}
{"text":"Had the beet salad with goat cheese. Perfection. Great little restaurant, nice ambience, good service."}
{"text":"Stay Cool...Be Cool!   The PAM is a cool, relaxing, often meditative oasis in the heart of this hot tamale of a city.   Changing exhibits and a diverse collection offer something for everyone.  Visit with the family and be sure to see the firefly room upstairs and the talking blob downstairs!  The Thorne Rooms are a blast from my childhood! Stop at the restaurant for a nice break and the gift shop for something unique.  Best place to go on First Fridays! Also free admission of Wednesday nights - makes it affordable to go eat in the neighborhood before or after as well!!"}
{"text":"A colleague and I were in town for a convention and found that the museum was walking distance from our hotel. We're always up for exploring new places and the weather was nice the day we decided to take the walk so it was actually quite pleasant.   We had our student IDs with us, so we paid the student price of $10, which turned out to be a great bang for your buck. The museum is a pretty big place with a variety of art. We especially enjoy contemporary and modern art and we were quite impressed with their collections.   The flow of the museum itself was nice. I always like to appreciate the architecture and design of the museum as an art piece in itself. Their display of Gianfranco Ferre Designs' \"White Shirt\" was great. Another piece that stuck out to me was Cornelia Parker's \"Mass\", a multi-dimensional display of charred remnants of a Texan church that was struck by lightning. I had seen this piece previously as Boston's Institute of Contemporary Art and it was a nice surprise to stumble upon once again here in Phoenix.   There was little to no restriction on photography of the art pieces. The staff was also very nice and helpful."}
{"text":"I have been a member of the Phoenix Art Museum for five years.  I stop in for ten minutes sometimes, just to go in and take a friend to \"the light room!\"  If you don't know what I am talking about, THEN YOU NEED TO VISIT THE PHOENIX ART MUSEUM.  Seriously, a smaller version of the exhibit went on display in NYC, and there were lines around the block.  We, in Phoenix, have it here ALL the time, it is a permanent exhibit.  Anyway, the museum is the largest art museum in the Southwest, the facility is gorgeous, and the staff very helpful and nice.  I find the changing exhibits to be mostly good.  They went all out recently with the hollywood exhibit.  I went twice, and loved it, but I am a big movie guy.  The restaurant has a full bar, which makes for a nice sunday with a bloody mary brunch and art exhibit!  If you are on a budget, I am pretty sure the museum is open for free on first Friday's!!!  Enjoy, D"}
{"text":"Went here the other day for the very first time. Absolutely loved it. Can't believe I haven't taken the time to go before. Really wish I had done it sooner.   Be sure to check out the Firefly room. It was probably the highlight of my visit."}
{"text":"Very large building, so some of the areas were sparse.   Also the modern exhibits were... let's just say different.  Like a \"tree\" wrapped in black velvet with little glass bluebird paperweights all over it.  The paintings were great though.  European art, some Dutch masters, early American icons - such as the painting of George Washington that you've seen on the dollar bill.  Several impressionists including Monet.  Definitely an oasis of beauty in the desert!"}
{"text":"Went there on a Wednesday night so they had their optional donation time. I donated before entering. It was well worth it. They had quality art and people working there knew what they were talking about."}
{"text":"I lived in D.C. for 5 years and got completely spoiled by the ability to go on a choose-your-art adventure any weekend (for free) at any of the many museums.  I was therefore worried that visits to the Phoenix Art Museum just wouldn't compare.  I didn't need to worry!  The Phoenix Art Museum is amazing.  Really wonderful.  The exhibits are varied yet not overwhelming; the docents are knowledgeable (but they don't hover, which is key); and the architecture of the building is beautiful and surprising and perfectly suited for a museum.  I was so impressed.  I'm not used to PAYING for my art yet, but that will come in time, I suppose."}
{"text":"I've been to the art museum on a few occasions now since living in Phoenix for 2years.  The standard exhibits that they've had this entire time are definitely nice even seeing them multiple times I've enjoyed them. I've seen 'special' exhibits a few times now. A few photography exhibits, the video game exhibit, even the fashion exhibit. Sometimes I pay... sometimes I remember its free on certain days.  That has never swayed my enjoyment of the museum.  I've never been harassed for taking the few photos that I have.. although admittedly I'm not a big photographer for art I can revisit and enjoy in person.  Well worth a visit."}
{"text":"We absolutely enjoyed ourselves here. They have such beautiful art pieces. We got great pictures and it was a great experience."}
{"text":"Overall, I was pretty impressed with the Phx Art Museum. While the collection is not quite world class, the facility is nice and the art is worth a look. The collection leans heavily towards modern and post modern art and there are always several travelling exhibits on display. Def. worth an afternoon and a nice change of pace from the usual. The sculpture garden is also worth a visit - very peaceful and relaxing.  Also, the museum store is a lot of fun. I always love museum stores b/c you can find unique, thoughtful and/or witty gifts that support the institution.   On site there is an Arcadia Farms cafe. Similar to the one found at the Heard, AF specializes in a broad range of cuisine with a New American flare. I have tried several dishes and all have been quite good. If you are in the museum and hungry, this is a great place for a bite. AF also looks out onto the sculpture garden area, which is a nice touch.  Def. check this place out. Also, FYI...the museum is free every Tuesday from 3 PM to 9 PM and on First Fridays from 6PM to 10 PM."}
{"text":"Checked out the Phoenix Art Museum's Walkabout world music and food event on Sunday. It was a great way to spend a beautiful Sunday afternoon. The music was good and there was great food sampling from several restaurants - Breadfruit, India Palace, Cafe Lalibela, Tradiciones, Wild Thaiger, etc.   After we were sated on jerk chicken and strawberry tamales, we ducked into the museum to see the illustrations of the Rubáiyát. Elihu Vedder illustrated this 12th century Persian poem and took a very classically Christian approach. Interesting exhibit but a bit tiresome for the eyes. Since we were there, we checked out severa other exhibits, including photography from Linda Connor.   I feel more cultured and, if the Art Museum has more food events like Sunday, I'll be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"So very impressed! Go during times that they conduct staff lead tours, this allows you to learn more about the exhibits and history of the museum. We unfortunately were not able to do one of these tours. The museum offers free days to enter the museum as well as extended hours, visit the Phoenix Art Museum website to gain more up to date information on this.  Visit the Museum Gift Shop. There are many interesting items from books to actual art pieces that you can buy."}
{"text":"A place, Incredibly rich in ideas, collections and atmosphere! In the Asian gallery, the flower arrangement changes every week, reflecting the changes in seasons, the celebrations we have, our moods. The contemporary installations are always thought-provoking and interesting with their search of new way to express ideas.  Authors presenting their books is also a very memorable event."}
{"text":"I spent a pleasant Sat. afternoon at this museum. Was a bit disappointed that many of the galleries were closed- including the Western Art and Impressionism. So I spent a lot of time at the Ansel Adams exhibit and the modern art pieces. Really enjoyed the fireflies room and the installation art. Also, a great photo exhibit upstairs which depicts photos of families throughout the years-it really catalogs the unstoppable effects of time."}
{"text":"In 2006, I returned to the P A M after a long absence.   I went to see a locally produced exhibit, (Judith Leiber,) which I thoroughly enjoyed and so I renewed My Membership.   Now at the time I was spending a good deal of time with My new granddaughter, Jade and started to bring Her to the Events and Exhibits.   Her first time was to the Cowboy Artist of America and at the time She did not speak much, Yet by the end of the event, She could say; \"Cowboys!\" (and the Artists always make an effort to, Draw Upon Her.)    Since then I have seen Rembrandt, special guests; The Tudor Tailors, Diego Rivera (with Frida Kahlo),  Author Michael Blake (with His Son) and much more.  As far as being, Good for Kids?!  My granddaughter, Jade's love of going to the P A M has made Me a bigger fan than ever.  ~Please View Pictures~"}
{"text":"I visited the Phoenix Art Museum for the first time on a Wednesday when admission is waived for a voluntary contribution during the hours of 3-9PM.  The free admission seems popular and the museum was a abuzz with a lively crowd of all ages.  I spent a leisurely four hours and discovered many entirely unexpected surprises and a few new favorites.  The Modern, Contemporary, American, and Southwestern galleries appeared to have the most extensive collections, while the Asian collection is the smallest.  The entire museum is a pleasant and comfortable space to spend some time, especially during the hot season.   The Modern collection offers work from Marsden Hartley, Diego Rivera, William Zorach, Joseph Stella, Pablo Picasso, Andy Warhol, Frida Kahlo, Willem DeKooning, and Peter Wegner.  The Southwestern collection offers a full wall of ten of George Catlin's pencil sketches of Native Americans from 1855;  John Sloan's  \"Palace of the Governors\" (1919) and \"A Road to Santa Fe\" (1924); Georgia O'Keefe's miniatures, \"White Rose\" and \"The Green Apple\" (1920), and the larger \"Canyon Country\" (1965);  Willard Nash's \"Santa Fe Landscape\" (1925);  Ernest Blumenshein's \"Fishing on Eagle Nest Lake\" (1931);  Howard Terpning's \"Offerings to the Little People\" (1998);  Peter Hurd's \"Portrait of Nito\" (1961) and \"Polo Game\"; and other representative works by Henry Cheever Pratt, Nicolai Fechin, Lew Davis, Maynard Dixon, and Paul Pletka.  Passing through the European collection one will be surprised to find Claude Monet's \"Flowering Arches, Giverny\", as well as Auguste Rodin's sculptures, \"The Kiss\" (1880) and \"Jean D'Aire\" (1904), and Andrea Della Robbia's bust sculpture, \"An Aged Apostle\" (1490).  Two notable Western sculptures are Frederic Remington's \"Mountain Man\" (1903), George Phippen's \"Roy Wayland\" (1965),      The top floor of the museum's South Wing is home to a few exceptional experiential art installations that must not be missed.  As the elevator doors open on this level, immediately before you is a mesmerizing digital projection installation by Jennifer Steinkamp titled, \"Mike Kelley 13\".  Entirely digitally designed, her work is that of a tree with limber, flexible branches endlessly shifting and dancing in the wind, captivating the viewer into a trance of peace and wonder.  Over the course of nine minutes the tree further transitions through the seasons.  Chairs have been thoughtfully provided on the side to allow one to fully surrender to this soothing experience.  Just around the corner is the breathtaking installation by Cornelia Parker, titled \"Mass (Colder Darker Matter)\", which is composed of charred chunks of wood in varying sizes suspended from the ceiling on filament, forming a large three dimensional spatial cube.  The charred wood used here was salvaged from a burned church in Texas ignited by a lightning strike.  This installation is fully open on one side to the gallery but provides the best viewing experience and highest contrast when viewed through the portal on the side.  Before coming to Phoenix, this work had previously been installed at the Tate Gallery in London, UK.   Inside of a 12x15 darkened room with mirrored walls, one finds Yayoi Kusama's installation titled \"You Who Are Getting Obliterated in the Dancing Swarm of Fireflies\", which is an unforgettable atmospheric and spatial experience.  The installation consists of LED lights suspended on cords from the ceiling.  The LED's slowly cycle through various colors and luminosities and are multiplied into infinity by the mirrored surfaces of the room.  The experience is one of being afloat in the middle of the Milky Way.  You enter the room on one end, move across the dark space, and exit on the other end.  It was very easy to spend some extended time inside the space and really appreciate it, even to sit on the floor.  Others didn't linger inside and merely passed in and right out again, perhaps due to being disoriented by the darkness.            If the Wednesday free admission hours are inconvenient, the museum is also one of the available venues in the CulturePass program offered through the public libraries throughout the Valley.  Depending upon weekly availability at your local library, use your library card to get free admission for two through CulturePass."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite museums in Phoenix.   The exhibitions are large and varied.   This Spring visit is no exception.  There is a way-out fashion exhibit,  a whimsical display of common domestic furnishings transformed to art... light pull switches, bed frames.   I enjoyed the Asian art exhibition.   If you become a contributing member,  you can enjoy reciprocal visit privileges at over 1000 museums nationwide,  including several here in Phoenix.  Parking is free.   I enjoy museum cafés for dining or coffees, in between wandering the exhibits.   Their Palette Café served me a tasty mushroom tart and mango daiquiri!"}
{"text":"...for Arizona, this is as good as it gets when it comes to fine art.  Unfortunately a large portion of the museum is dedicated to an era of art that is currently distasteful: desert landscapes depicting early statehood.  Fortunately, since it has taken over the old library there is space for modern and rotating exhibits that will inspire young artists. (Example: the exhibit called \"being obliterated by a thousand fireflies\" will be a great experience for a child of any age)."}
{"text":"Loves the recent Cezanne show. In fact I've seen it twice in the last week. I need to find out more about who curated the exhibit as it is very fine. The Oriental collection is very nice and soothing.  The Downtown Chamber Group gave a wonderful concert in the great hall on Sunday. I wonderful and unusual program of saxophone and harp. I think it is great to have music in the galleries. I liked the musicians being on a platform. since the room isn't banked one can see the performers. A few things I'm not so crazy about: The great room is this awesome space for large art. Sunday I sat and looked at it for several hours. You know, not such great art. I find the Terrill boring and the other pieces uninteresting. The cafe never quite lives up to its promise. My lunch companion barley touched her lunch and the waiter never asked why or offered a box. Enough grousing I love the place and go often."}
{"text":"Wednesday late afternoons are free! There's an interesting collection of medieval works. A large amount of modern art, of which I'm not a huge fan but I appreciated the collection here. Overall, I'd say go when it's free."}
{"text":"Spoiled my extraordinary museums in NYC, I stopped by this place for the samurai special exhibition without much expectation, rather than the urge to escape the burning sun. Yet, the art museum was able to catch my interest from the moment i stepped in. The samurai armors were made in much decorative details. The masks were embolished with fake hair, feathers n flower shaped parts. They someone looked to me more like theater costumes than war armors. We then wandered out to the abstract arts and Asian arts. The museum is much smaller than any art museum in NYC, which I often find overwhelmed. The arts on display are selected carefully and tastefully. Here, quality definitely outweighs the quantity. It blowed my mind. As I examined individual art pieces, I was amazed to find the beautiful treasures held in this museum that I haven't seen before, even though I have visited countless museums many times. Most the abstract arts are gorgeous and make viewers stop for closer looks, unlike many of those hung in Moma that make visitors question where's the art. I'm glad to have been here during my short visit."}
{"text":"The first thing that I used to notice about the Phoenix Art Museum was its beautiful, modern facility, including the sunburst chandelier hanging in the entrance, and the museum's beautiful grounds, some of it landscaped with local cacti. In the past, I have enjoyed a variety of temporary exhibits here, including an Ansel Adams photography exhibit and one showcasing the quirky art of yixing teapots. If you like contemporary art, then you will love what the Phoenix Art Museum has to offer. Historic and more traditional artwork is featured on one of the museum's upper floors. In fact, this is where I first encountered my now favorite Southwestern landscape painting, \"Sweeping Clouds,\" by local artist Ed Mell. The museum's gift store has an outstanding selection of gifts, many of them bearing relation to the artwork on exhibit in the museum. I just wish they sold a poster copy of Ed Mell's famous Southwestern landscape. If I have one suggestion for improvement, I would like to see an expansion of Western American art, including landscapes, at the museum. What is currently on display is very good, but I just feel there should be even more Western American representation here. At any rate, this is a wonderful art museum, and with it being located in such close proximity to the Heard Museum, it would be easy to make a cultural day out of visiting them both. Definitely worth the visit."}
{"text":"Don't miss the Hollywood Costumes exhibit. allow two & a half hours! AND eat in the restaurant .. . excellent food and well worth the price!!!"}
{"text":"Free parking, Wednesdays 3-9pm free admission, what a great way to spend an afternoon! I was quite impressed that they have such an impressive and diverse collection."}
{"text":"Love this place! Came on a Tuesday night, so it was free admission but I would definitely pay during my second visit. It's a fairly large museum; there's lots to explore so give yourself more than two hours to do so. Be aware that you can take pictures of some exhibitions and not others so be on the lookout for any signs.   Overall, I would go again and I would recommend it to other people as well. I am by no means a museum junkie, but I still loved every second of my visit. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Recently, on a short visit to Phoenix I had hopes of visiting a number of museums over a few days. Frankly, I was put off by the Phoenix Art Museum. Yes, it's easy to get to and parking is free, but they made the decision to put the bookshop after the fee entry station and that's just dumb. I like to use a visit to a museum shop to give me a better idea of the content of the collections and time I'll need to visit them. The free admission day - Wednesdays - may be the way to go. The staff I encountered seemed unfriendly; at least, they were unwilling to stop talking among themselves to ask if I needed information or assistance. I liked the grounds, but I went elsewhere."}
{"text":"My favorite thing about the Phoenix Art Museum is that they manage to showcase southwestern art without it being the total theme of the museum. I am not much of a fan of cowboy painings and whatnot but I can appreciate them when I can also cart around to modern art, sculpture, photography, classic art and the likes.  They also get some great special exhibits! I actually got a chance to work for their audio tour company during Norman Rockwell and China's Forbidden City and it was tons of fun!  I feel like I should find the gift shop more lame than I do. They have terrific magnets, local jewlery, shirts, books, even dishes. It's like one of those nifty calalogs that come in the mail with random things you never knew that you wanted.  The staff is my experience has always been helpful and pleasant.   How can you not love this place?"}
{"text":"I've been to a number of art museums in my lifetime, but the Phoenix Art Museum was pleasantly different from the norm.  We went for the Video Game exhibit, which I enjoyed immensely. I saw some parts of the rest of the museum, but mainly stuck to the exhibit.  My only gripes are that the bathrooms were a bit confusing to locate (I didn't have a map), the wandering staff wasn't terribly helpful (couldn't tell me where the bathrooms were), and that the gift store didn't have a good selection of magnets (I collect them)."}
{"text":"A great place for an adventure with art. We don't get too many rainy days in the valley of the sun but I would head here when it does."}
{"text":"Just love!! One of Phoenix Arizona's gems! Saw the new Hollywood exhibit and it was SO FUN and extensive!  Madeline Albright pin collection is still there and...I just love this museum.  Last night, with that costume exhibit...made me seriously consider membership!"}
{"text":"On two torrid late June days,I was fortunate enough to enjoy this art museum's splendid collection.This art museum has a wonderful collection of Modern and Contemporary Art.I especially liked their works by Pablo Picasso,Max Ernst,Max Beckmann,Carlos Amorales(\"Black Clouds\"),Tony Oursler,and Yayoi Kusama.This art museum has a wonderful collection of paintings with American Western themes.I especially savored their fine paintings by Robert Henri,Oscar Berninghaus,Ernest Blumenschein,John Sloan,Jonas Lie,Peter Hurd,and Howard Post.Their collection of European paintings is not comprehensive,nevertheless I saw fine paintings by Bicci di Lorenzo(\"Nativity\"),Francesco Ubertini,Marco Palmezzano,Bernardo Strozzi(\"Doge\"),Guisseppe Ribera,Camille Corot,jean Leon Gerome(\"Police Verso\"),Jean J. Henner,Claude Monet(\"Garden Arches,Giverny\"-my favorite work there),and the obscure Pointillist Leon Porteau(\"Provence Landscape\"),just to cite a few..It is open from Wednesday through Sunday with longer hours on Wednesdays and shorter hours on Sundays.Seniors like myself receive a discount on the museum's admission fee.This art museum is very close to the McDowell Phoenix Light Rail station."}
{"text":"Definitely worth the visit. They might not have so many of the greats (artists) that I see in California, but the museum and the art selections are fantastic.  (They do have greats what am I talking about?) It is a huge museum with lots of the classics and much of the contemporary. Many cultures are also represented and it's a perfect place to take family. I took my nieces and they loved it."}
{"text":"this is a great museum. the temperature is always 72 degrees which is key in phoenix in the summer. the art selection is very good as well. i agree with other reviewers that the layout can be somewhat confusing. they could work on a better sense of flow through the building."}
{"text":"I love this museum. The architecture is gorgeous. They have great collections. My girlfriend and I went to see the Modern Mexican exhibit last Wednesday when admission was free. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. It was my third visit to PAM and I always leave feeling energized and inspired. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I'm glad that I chose to spend my one free afternoon--during a recent work related trip--visiting the Phoenix Art Museum. The museum itself isn't overwhelming in size so I definitely got to see all of the exhibits during that one afternoon (minus one exhibit that I didn't want to pay extra for). The museum also houses an eclectic mix of art: modern/contemporary, some classic European and American, Asian, fashion (limited exhibit of American designer, James Galanos) and a collection of miniatures.   I personally LOVE looking at miniature pieces and the amount of detail that was put into the ones on display here is insane (located in the Thorne Miniature Rooms exhibit). Highly recommend checking it out! I also really enjoyed the James Galanos fashion exhibit. Some of the dresses are really beautifully, and intricately, crafted.   Tip: if you're hungry, I recommend taking a break from the art and dining at the little cafe located inside the museum. FYI it's not a cheap option though. I was kind of hangry when I visited--so definitely didn't want to leave to go eat somewhere else--so ended up having lunch at the cafe. I was really pleasantly surprised by the service and food. My waiter was attentive and my grilled salmon dish was well prepared. It was also a generously sized portion."}
{"text":"I can't wait to go back and enjoy this place all by myself. I took my three kids and didn't make it all the way through. I was surprised and impressed. I've lived here over 15 years and never came down to see the works of Claude Monet, Gilbert Stuart and Georgia O'Keefe, who knows what else is in there! Never knew all that history and creative expression made it's way into the middle of the desert. Studying the brush strokes of Frida Kahlo and learning the history of cameos was nice for me. My kids enjoyed the contemporary art, the interactive light mazes, watching video art and peering into the miniatures exhibit. There's something for everyone here. It's up close and personal and by that I mean everything's pretty accessible. The staff is friendly, helpful and informative. Large outdoor garden to take a break. There's a beautiful fashion exhibit on the white T-shirt and designs by Gianfranco Ferre. You better go."}
{"text":"The art here is one of the best pieces of art I have ever seen,and as a artist,I love how pretty the art is here."}
{"text":"I'm just gonna throw this out there: this is a great place for a date! Just sayin ;)  Came here with my hubby for the Art of Video Games exhibit last month, and we were NOT disappointed! As for the rest of the museum, we promised we'd only check out half of the place, so that way we can come back and see exhibits we haven't seen yet for the first time.  I am also a huge fan of the black, butterfly art all in the front entrance and into the rest of the main part of the building. Gorgeous!"}
{"text":"I want to live inside of the Fireflies exhibit. What a magical experience. Truth be told, I haven't been to a museum in a very long time and this past First Friday, I finally got a chance to experience the museum for free. The museum itself is a work of art, with contemporary features. I'd return here again and again, very inspirational.  P.S. If you're going to spend the whole time on your phone, maybe don't come. Saw a lot of that last night."}
{"text":"This museum has come a long way from it's humble beginings in Phx. I remember when I was a kid in the 80's my trips to the museum were always followed up by visiting the adjacent Central Phx Public Library where I spent a lot of my youth pouring over any subject that I wanted. My parents never kept me out of the adult sections. They thoguht if I could read it that's all that mattered. I loved the museum & library & still do. Now a member of the museum I realize just how very much the Phx Art Museum has to do all year long. Great place to be & lose yourself in the art. Tip - Become a member to support the Arts in Phx."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places to kill some time between other activities. With our membership, we can just spend the time we want to. Today was the Samurai Exhibit. Went in part of the guided tour with Isabel. She knew a lot and I got more out of the experience. The full-time exhibits are quite good too. Wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Amazing! Was at the Cultural Event of Thursday and it was amazing!! I didn't get to see all of the art but it was astonishing!"}
{"text":"I dropped into the Phoenix Art Museum on a whim this past Tuesday night (Tuesdays are the night it's opened until 9pm which is also FREE ADMISSION night).  I was pleasantly surprised by their collection and their special exhibits. It's not at the same level of most large metropolitan art museums, but it has a lot to see and there are a few items that stand out. The building is somewhat maze like, but that makes it fun and interesting, as well, as the chance to return to see things you missed during previous visits.   Remember, Tuesday nights are FREE, so it's a great opportunity to take the family away from the TV and see something different."}
{"text":"Really.... I want to write a review, but Lauren V said all I wanted to say.  I loved the light and mirror effect room.  I wasn't sure I would call it art, but it was cool as all cool.  The charred wood installation piece is fantastic to stare at...velvet rope and all.  I can't say I blamed the kid, I would have loved to run through it myself.  They seem to get some of the greatest traveling shows -- the Secrets of the Forbidden Palace, the Rembrandts, there was an impressionist one, Ansel Adams,Curves, the evening dresses, the Himilayan Art, Degas....  It's large enough that you can spend hours there, but broken up into sections so you don't feel you have to do it all.  I hear they show movies there too!  Tuesday afternoon/evening = free!"}
{"text":"I am obsessed with this place!  I cannot say enough amazing things...I love their exhibits...I love Arcadia Farms inside...I love the architecture and design of the building...I love the staff (they are so helpful)...the gift shop is fabulous (I got the cutest watch bangle)...I love the giant red t-rex out front...I love the kids area (or at least my son does)...I love the diversity of the art!  I would recommend getting a membership because it allows you to be able go all year long with your loved ones and family!  You can have weddings here and they are beautiful!  They have events here all the time if you sign up for emails or become a member...at least just go once and you will fall in love!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here. I am not a big art person. I appreciate it but standing for hours looking at one thing just not into it. Of course I do have ADD so it is possible for me to stair at the weirdest things for a while. I was here for a special reception for their new exhibit The Art of Video Games. So I didn't get to see the entire museum just this one section. The reception was for members, Mom is a member, and it was really nice. They had two catering tables set up with cheese, crackers, Swedish meatballs, roasted veggies, some sliced up wraps and little cakes. Everything was very good. Cash bar. That was a good idea too. I will say most of the members seemed to be much older people, which is no surprise extra money and lots of time on their hands, but it was funny to see them at a video game exhibit. Hey who would turn down free food and a cash bar. The exhibit itself was very interesting and definitely a trip down memory lane. It was about the evolution of home gaming consoles and computers games. They had four genres they concentrated on and showed how those genres evolved from the very first home console, the good old Atari, all the way through to the Xbox 360 and PS3. It was nice to see my old friend the Commodore 64 there. Many an hour on summer vacation was spent with one of those. It was interesting to see how they tried to bring early arcade games like Pac Man to the home console but had to make a lot of compromises to make it work and it was Pac Man but it just looked horrible but hey it was the first try so you have to give them a little bit of a break. I also didn't know that Doom II was the first \"online\" multiplayer game. Lots of interesting facts and also cool to see how games evolved. The curator of the exhibit was also there wandering around talking to people and explaining things. That added a lot to it. If you are a fan of video games you should go down and check it out. It is free on Wednesday and they are open until 9pm that day. I am glad my Mom took me to this. It was quite the experience. It even had my Mom wanting to play video games. This from the woman who hated them when I was growing up. Would much rather have us spend hours reading a book then glued to a computer screen. Being a school librarian didn't help either. Who once ripped the power cord out of the wall to get us to stop playing. So it must be a good exhibit if it got her excited about video games. Also check out the gift shop they have some great video game related gifts. The exhibit is only there until the end of September so don't miss out. Maybe some time I will go back to check out the rest of the museum. We will see."}
{"text":"With over 18,000 pieces, the featured art ranges from interactive exhibits by Andy Warhol, to fashion from around the world. This museum has classical and contemporary art from American, Asian, European, Latin American, and Western American cultures. The museum is free to the public on Wednesday's and is free all week long for Maricopa Community College students. Bring your friends, a date, or just enjoy a quiet walk by yourself. The Phoenix Art Museum is a must!"}
{"text":"Best cultural destination in Arizona. Be sure to check out the Kusama Fireflies room, Thorne miniature rooms, and the Shorr collection with Old Master paintings. It's an amazing place!"}
{"text":"Wow! I was very impressed by the Phoenix Art Museum's collection and their diverse eclectic exhibits. They allow you to take pictures on about 90% of their pieces. I attended a docent's tour and had a great time listening to the stories behind each piece he shared. It was absolutely outstanding and I learned so much in one hour. For the rest of the time, I wandered around on my own allowing myself to get lost in the beauty of art.  I saw a giant red toy dinosaur entrapped in a cage, the painting by Jean Leon which helped inspired the movie Gladiator, charred remains of a Texas church made into a beautiful hanging display, Georgia O'Keefe's paintings, Yayoi Kusama's infinite mirrored room, beautiful impressionism artwork, and so much more!   \"Blessed are those who see beautiful things in humble places where other people see nothing.\""}
{"text":"Lots of cool art. From modern to old. Always a cool new exhibit to see when I come. Good place."}
{"text":"The Phoenix Art Museum is a treasure in the cultural life of Phoenix and of Arizona. Exhibits are exceptionally well curated, with creative twists and narratives. It's a superb place to spend 2-3 hours, including a lunch or snack break in their inviting and friendly cafe.   The current exhibit of Water Photography by Canadian photographer Edward Burtynsky is a truly unique discovery for any art museum. The photos are from many water-challenged parts of the world, large in scale, with informative, thought-provoking narratives for each one by the photographer.   Their website includes an up-to-date list of exhibits and special programs. Whenever you have some time to spare in Phoenix, spend some of it at this fine museum!"}
{"text":"I visited after 3:00pm on Wednesday and was pleasantly surprised to find that admission was free at that time. I spent a few hours lounging around, there was a t o n to see and was well worth the visit!"}
{"text":"I never thought much of modern art until my first visit to this museum. I have been three times now and always leave with a good impression. As well as offering thought-provoking works, the museum explores sound, light, digital media formats and tactile pieces. It is always worth the visit."}
{"text":"An excellent museum that has something of real interest for everyone. I'm not a big fan of experimental art but there were pieces and installations that were really cool and command your attention whilst the Chinese and Japanese rooms are well put together and very interesting.    You could be there for most of the day if you want- I was there for two hours and probably only managed to look at 50% of the rooms in any real depth. For a city that supposedly 'lacks culture', PAM is as good a place to spend an afternoon as anywhere in New York and so on."}
{"text":"We went for the Kid's Day.  We were a little disappointed at what was actually there for kids.  It's a nice museum though.  Didn't get to see all of it but if I could ever come alone, I'd definitely like to spend the day there checking out the art."}
{"text":"I'm a bit conflicted about the Phoenix Art Museum.  I was just talking about that to someone doing graduate work at ASU in museum studies - who also seemed to agree with me.    While it's a good museum and the expansion has given it more space and a more sweeping, dramatic entrance, they could have worked out a few more kinks in the layout and flow of the museum.  The boundaries between galleries are not exactly clear.  You're not entirely sure which gallery you've entered.  It still feels disjointed after the expansion, and a few galleries are built like Avondale cul-de-sacs.  Perhaps I've been to too many museums on the coasts, and I'm being nitpicky here, but the layout does strike me as rather odd.  Phoenix Art Museum is still a great way to pass the day.  The collection is stronger than I expected with an emphasis on American art from the 19th and 20th centuries, and the visiting exhibitions are always impressive.  Make sure to check out the photography gallery and the contemporary art gallery with the hanging LED lights / dark room - you'll feel kinda drunk and woozy without the $60 bar tab.  Past exhibitions have included Annie Leibovitz and Frank Lloyd Wright.  There's a great view of the Central Corridor skyscrapers from the glass wall overlook on the 3rd floor!"}
{"text":"I love this place. My mom is a member, and I love going here with her. I have seen quite a few of the different exhibits over the years, and they are always great. This place has a great sentimental attachment for me as well. It is like it's one of our family places. We usually eat at the Arcadia Farms after we see everything, and have a discussion about what thought about everything.  I haven't been since they've completed the remodel, so now I am anxious to get back down there and see all the changes!"}
{"text":"I am an art lover but don't dig the overkill by the people who are \"guarding\" the art from the common folk.  After having a run-in with an over-zealous guard and then discussing it with Heather the manager, I will most likely not return.  They are many friendlier art installations in the valley...I will give them my hard-earned support instead."}
{"text":"stopped by closing hours on First Friday - stunning Tatiana Sorokko exhibit on loan through Jan 2, 2011 - breathtaking pieces: Ralph Chado Rucci burnt rust plumed bolero, Vivienne Westwood \"Storm in a Teacup,\" Jean Paul Gaultier fishnet/silk chiffon gown, Matsuda wool crepe suit, Yohji Yamamoto, Comme des Garcons. highly recommend.  seems like the museum has a decent roster of ongoing/special events"}
{"text":"I'm surprised by how much is here!  Saw the davinci exhibit first, and they had two great Monet's.  Not the most kid friendly place, but if you're in need of something high class on a budget, it is great!"}
{"text":"The Phoenix Art Museum is beautiful, with wonderful collections of so many different pieces. We went on a field trip today with 4th graders. And while I do believe the kids need to be educated on what they learned today I'm not sure some of the staff know how to handle smaller kids. We did however have a tour guide at the beginning, Mrs. Miller who was amazing and so patient with the kids. Some of the staff however were rude at times. (FYI: My group was not running or touching any of the art). Maybe for field trips they could think of a way to structure it differently so the staff isn't on edge!"}
{"text":"Always fun times at the Art museum.   Employees are always friendly and helpful.   We go to the museam often and it is always a pleasent expiriance."}
{"text":"We are visiting from Colorado and try to stop by the museum when we are in Phoenix. They had a great Andy Warhol portraits exhibit. The kids enjoy all the variety of artwork."}
{"text":"Someone told me that I'd likely be extremely disappointed in this museum since I've been to every museum in LA and SF, but...that's not how museums work. Every museum has something unique and interesting to offer and I was really impressed with this one!! It's a lot larger than I anticipated and it took me over 5 hours to get through it all. My feet were dead but it was absolutely worth the extensive walkthrough.  Some of my favorites, without getting into too much detail since I was an art history undergrad and could easily get carried away...  1. The Samurai exhibit going on currently is wonderful. So much attention to detail!! All the masks are incredible.  2. The Living Need Light, The Dead Need Music. Wow. I walked into this 20 min documentary halfway and then stayed to watch it 3 more times...I could not get over how well it was produced. The music alone blew my mind. I would see a full-length film of this in theaters...  3. You Who are Getting Obliterated in a Dancing Swarm of Fireflies. I think this was actually on exhibit at the PACE gallery in Palo Alto and I was bummed to miss it so I was elated to catch it here. I walked through it at least a dozen times. I want to write a paper on it...  What a fantastic museum experience! One of my favorites actually. I would love to revisit on my next trip to Phoenix. Will definitely keep an eye out for future exhibitions."}
{"text":"Great collection. Great presentation. Design and overall air is to be a role model to other US museums. Only the $ 18 entrance is a surprise. Family of 4 will reconsider, I think :))) But overall, recommended. If you are an art lover - you are already a freak. Keep it!  Sincerely yours, www.californiaway.org."}
{"text":"I wish they had a lil bit more art but not really complaining since they put on special exhibitions on a regular basis so you get to see a lot of cool stuff like Ansel Adam photographs, most recently Leonardo da Vinci's Codex Leicester manuscripts, Hollywood costume, Egyptian treasures, Andy Warhol Portraits and many more. For most of the special exhibitions there is a fee but I don't mind since a lot of times there are fees to enter other museums state side and abroad.  I don't know if they still rent out the space for private parties but my old job had its Xmas party here and it was by far the coolest place to have it.    If you are in the area, it's worth a quick stop."}
{"text":"We went for the Hollywood costume exhibit. It was great. We also got to see the Albright pin exhibit as well as the Oscar dress exhibit. A great facility. We'll have to go back and visit the galleries. Woth the trip to Phoenix."}
{"text":"I made arrangements for my fellow faculty members to have an in-service at the PAM, specifically to see \"Elihu Vedder's Drawings for the Rubaiyat,\" their current special exhibit. Have I been to better art museums in this country? Sure, but I really do appreciate the great traveling shows the PAM curators get to come here, and I have enjoyed many in the years I have lived here.   The Vedder exhibit was great, and I highly recommend it to fans of Vedder and of Omar Khayyam, the scientist, philosopher, and poet whose words Vedder interprets in his amazing drawings. In a nutshell, the Rubaiyat expresses Khayyam's frustration with the infighting of theologians and philosophers, and dissatisfaction with the \"answers\" they give for the meaning of life. He feels this life is fleeting, so we should live for the pleasant moments, drinking, eating, and loving while we can. PAM has secured this collection from the Smithsonian, and if you are unfamiliar with the Rubaiyat, or with Vedder, I would suggest going on a tour. We all learned a lot, and were blown away by the art, even if our docent made a mistake or two. This special exhibit runs through Feb. 8, 2009.   PAM also has outreach programs to local schools as well as provides group tours and lectures. It's a wonderful addition to our city, and one that should be better appreciated that it often seems to be."}
{"text":"I. LOVE. THIS. PLACE.   I'd been going to a lot of smaller museums so to walk into this gigantic vault of history and beauty was so overwhelming I almost needed to sit down.   This is one beautiful museum. The way they have everything curated is perfectly perfect. It's not all artists or all sculptors together, but they blend with one another depending on the period. And it is visually stunning.   I love being surprised by seeing an artist I love mixed in with everything. It's like a present! Then to walk along and see something so familiar, but not know where it was or how it came to be there is one of my favorite things ever.   I wish I could name everything I loved about this museum, but I don't have the time or the words. Just visit, you'll be so glad you did."}
{"text":"Love this museum and the pieces and if you have bofa its free first sat and sundays of the month. Don't bring water bottles in. A phx must see, will be back next first sat of the month. The pieces are pretty and the place is great!"}
{"text":"I grew up going to this museum, and the expansion is killer. Part underground, four-levels, an expanded fashion gallery and finally a gallery just for photography!   it's beautiful and it feels nice to be in there...before you realize it, you've been wandering around for three hours.   do not miss the suspended charred wood installation piece on the third level of the expansion, it is really cool. i heard some snot-nosed kid who's parents weren't parenting ran through the suspended pieces, tangling them up and now it has a velvet rope around it...too bad.  *** update i just went there to see the Rembrandt exhibit and indeed, there is a rope around the piece - boo. i also wanted to be sure to note  the installation piece that is a DO NOT MISS- It's in the northwest corner of the third level. an entire room made to be near pitch-black, with every wall (including floor and ceilings) mirrored but with a brown tint- so you can see a faint outline of yourself... but you are not the star of the show. suspended from the ceiling are dozens of strings with tiny LED lights all the way down that slowly fade in and out as all blue, then all green and then all red and then a rainbow. with all the mirrors and the sound-proof room, the ultimate effect is that you literally feel like you are floating in space -- it was unlike anything i had ever felt before and it literally took my breath away. --side note-- before i left i couldn't resist and came back to the room for another experience, except this time i thought i knew what it was all about and just rushed in without taking my time to get my bearings and get oriented. i nearly had a panic attack after running into a wall. a totally different experience than the first, which further raises my respect for this piece"}
{"text":"I fully support the arts but I appreciate even more the nights and events that get you in for free! It's not a very large museum. Some of the exhibits can seem pretty boring, but take some time to read about the piece and/or artist to get a better understanding of what you are looking at."}
{"text":"Lots to see, good for all ages. Admission is a little steep, but there is three floors worth of art, including sculptures, paintings and miniature sets.  Went to the special exhibit of the month, the baseball card collection, and it was pretty neat to see.. But would have liked for it to be included in my admission price. Took about two hours to do the whole place."}
{"text":"This is a fine museum with a good inventory of classic and modern art and a decent succession of featured exhibits. The building itself is large without being overwhelming and is contemporary in design. It has a spacious function hall as well as a beautifully maintained courtyard/sculpture garden suitable for a variety of events, including my favorite recurring one - Art Night Out. And I really appreciate the fact that those of us on a limited budget can avail of the museum's exhibits for free on Wednesday evenings and during the monthly First Friday art walk."}
{"text":"Was recently at the Phoenix Art Museum for their presentation of Leonardo Da Vinci's Codex Leicester-a series of writings by da Vinci regarding engineering. It was intriguing just to see documents written by arguably the most influential person to ever live; even if one could not read the documents. Reading the synopsis of the Codex Leicester provided fascinating insight to the greatest mind of the Rennaisance.  Although the museum might be lacking of some of the more renowned and popular artists that are familiar to most (although Monet, Homer and several others are on display), there is plenty to enjoy. Of particular interest to myself was paintings of the southwest from the mid 1800s-to modern day, with emphasis on the first half of the 20th century. I hope they continue to expand on the southwest genre. This museum is well worth a visit."}
{"text":"Our most recent visit to the Scottsdale area led to our first visit to the Phoenix Art Museum on a Wednesday afternoon. Here is what we learned from this visit - the museum is a great one but avoid Wednesday afternoons after 3:00 p.m. as entry is free at that time and the crowds increase.   Fortunately we entered about 2:00 so had a chance to see the incredible Ansel Adams exhibit before the crowds started to gather there.  Then we went on to browse through the rest of the museum to see the other collections and exhibits as well as stroll through the outdoor sculpture garden.   A woman who was a regular visitor to the museum gave us a tip that we'll pass along here. She said \"Don't miss the fireflies.\" What she meant was to be sure to see the experiential art installation by a Japanese artist on the second floor of the South (?) Gallery. Tucked into a back corner of that floor, we think the installation is roughly titled \"For those who would be consumed by the fireflies.\"   The artist has arranged hanging, colored LED lights in a completely dark room that is surrounded with mirrors. The light level ebbs and flows as do the color patterns. The challenge is to make one's way through the exhibit from the entry to the exit but also to be able to enjoy the silence and colors and experience of the light.   There is something in the experience that we thought was a pretty good metaphor for life in general, if one thinks about it.   We noted on the first pass through that we were both intrigued by the light show but a little fearful about how dark the room was, and how difficult it was to see a path forward. We used as grounding the light we could see in the doorway behind us as we could not see the light through the exit ahead and we weren't at all sure there was going to be a safe exit. There were other people in the room and while we couldn't see each other we could hear each other and there were whispered exchanges, \"Do you know the way out of here? Isn't it beautiful?\" and so on.   The second time through we were better able to just marvel at the shifting light patterns as we knew there was a path through. This time we also were more aware of the others who entered the room and that some people stood at the door and said to their companions, \"I'm NOT going in there. I'll wait for you out here.\"   Maybe it was that we were in an art Museum that made us connect this experience as life experience metaphor.  Maybe it says something about us specifically that we found it harder to to find the exit the second time. :-) Regardless, if you're at the museum, go see this!  One last thought about this particular art installation is that we calculated the age of the artist, a woman born in 1939, to be in her 70's.  Use of technology and creativity has no age boundary."}
{"text":"I have been a fan but infrequent visitor to the Phoenix Art Museum, but my most recent visit was on an afternoon with my father in law, visiting from NYC.  We checked out the Ansel Adams exhibit, and it was wonderful.  As a college student, I spent many afternoons at the CCP in Tucson where his work is stored, and there were many pieces that they brought out for this exhibit that aren't always on display down there.  But it was \"You Who Are Getting Obliterated in the Dancing Swarm of Fireflies\" that dumbfounded both of us.  For some perspective, F-I-L is a cultured, well-traveled man (who lives across the street from the Met, no stranger to art, this guy) and he commented about what a completely unexpected, moving surprise the visit to PHXArt was.  I don't know why I'm compelled to mention that, I just am.  Phoenix Art Museum gets better every time I go."}
{"text":"I seriously love this place!  Great art, Great exhibitions, even the weird layout appeals to me.  I would prefer them to have a more interesting gift shop but that isn't enough to put a dent on my review.  Anyway i've gone many times probably close to 100 and i've never gotten tired of it it's just an all around great museum."}
{"text":"2nd Wednesdays are free.  Conveniently located in middle of the city. I really enjoyed the Asian collection, Western American and as always everyone favorite 'Fireflies'"}
{"text":"We have been to the art museum many times over the years, it always gets better.  The current cowboy exhibit is as usual good, even though it is not my cup of tea. One good thing, I saw an artist name that I recognize as being on one of our pieces at home. The difference between ours and the pieces in the museum is ours has no cowboys in it, just animals. But we will have to investigate.   The exhibit we went to see for the most part was, Extending the Runway Tatiana Sorokko Style. It did not disappoint at all.  Of course we also enjoyed the rest of the exhibits and Phoenix should be very happy with this venue."}
{"text":"Wonderful place to view both classical and modern art. The different wings of the building feel like completely different spaces because they contain completely different installments, yet the whole space is cohesive and contemporary. A little tip: go on Wednesday nights. Admission is free (with a suggested donation) and you can see the special installments (such as the Frank Lloyd Wright or Paper! exhibits) for free."}
{"text":"I went to see the Chicano art exhibit and was very impressed.  A great permanent collection as well.  Not world class but great for across the street."}
{"text":"Gorgeous building and grounds! This was the perfect stop during our layover in Phoenix. The exhibitions and permanent collections were surprisingly expansive. There was a nice collection of modern and contemporary art - it wasn't just southwestern art. The work was beautifully displayed and viewed from different levels (open staircases and overlooks). The textiles/fashion collection was a nice component of the collection. I really loved finding \"hidden\" artwork like the digital display of the man and woman walking - great use of an exterior space with a nice view from the inside of the museum or from the street. I would love to come back and see other pieces."}
{"text":"Art museums are bastions of strange art fused with conventional. I'm not an art expert but I enjoy checking them out. Artists are often a weird bunch, and it's nice to see that brought into forums like this for us to see. While visiting in April, I went upstairs to see what appeared to be strands of blackened/burned wood hanging from string from the ceiling. Visually it was just stunning. It's surreal. It's weird, it's great! My main draw here was free admission (Wednesday, yeah!). I can't pretend to understand most art or to interpret. I just know what I like and what I see. This particular moment in time there was a show of paintings by a Native American, Fritz Scholder, who seemed to thrive off controversy (his Wounded Knee portrait, bleak, simple, stunning).  My dad and I spent $8 each and checked out a wonderful display of very rare baseball cards- 42 of them- on display for a short time only to coincide with the start of the baseball season. Standing in the presence of near mint cards of Babe Ruth, Willie Mays, and Shoeless Joe Jackson, made me love this museum. I'll enjoy coming back to see more of their art."}
{"text":"absolutely gorgeous museum! i went once with my good friend and then the next week with my boyfriend. i could not get enough of it the first time! the museum is kept up so nicely and always feels clean and upscale. the art is beautiful and perfect for unique photo ops. you will not be disappointed if you have a free hour or so and you go check it out! i promise. the prices are reasonable as well! only $10 for students!"}
{"text":"I have spent more hours here than I can count - and even if there were no traveling special exhibits, I'd find something new every time.  Granted - I am that person who spent over an hour staring at a single Kandinsky a few years back. I do have real appreciation for the special exhibitions.  I also appreciate the sculptures in the courtyard, the miniatures, the Asian collection and several other pieces from the permanent collection. One of the advantages of being in Phoenix is the accessible parking (happily also along the light rail) and the reasonable entrance fees. (To the people who gripe about the museum and theater prices in Phoenix - go to NYC, San Francisco, Boston, Chicago, etc. We have bargains in comparison!  Having lived in PHX for as long as I have, I've watched the museum grow. Section by section. I appreciate the modern lines and use of light throughout - and given how many additions have been built on over the years, it's still architecturally coherent.  The cafe is a nice pit stop, and the gift shop is well stocked and has something for everyone. There are great events through the course of the year - and annual membership is well worth the price for how much you get in exchange!"}
{"text":"I LOVE the Phoenix Art museum! The PAM holds it's own when stacked against other museums I've visited in major metropolitan cities in the US and even rivals those I've enjoyed in England. Their exhibits are impressive, their collections are diverse and varied, and their hours and prices are reasonable. I am especially impressed with their Renaissance collection which I canNOT get enough of!  PAM is free on Wednesdays and first Fridays... how awesome is THAT? Even on these \"suggested donation\" days, the museum is still peaceful and hospitable. If you haven't been there before I recommend going when it's free to get your first taste! The museum is medium in size- which I enjoy. It's small enough that you can get familiar with the works after a few visits, but large enough that you never feel crowded or bored. Their rotating exhibits are always compelling and they are thoughtful about engaging various audiences with their selections.  I am so proud of this museum. Let's be honest.... Phoenix doesn't always deliver when it comes to cultural experiences so I was full of joy when I discovered this gem!  Enjoy! Kelley"}
{"text":"If you haven't scheduled a trip to the Phoenix Art Museum (or if it's your first visit) now is the time to get there. The atmosphere is warm and helpful--this isn't your stuffy Museum (any longer). Children were engaged in different projects and not asked to walk single file with their mouths' zipped. The entry with the butterfly display is breathtaking and from this spot one may select several different routes, including their continual array of special exhibitions. If you love the impressionist period, the museum as a lot to offer as well as a decent selection of famous local/Western artists. A favorite floor of mine is downstairs where an incredible Mexican acrylic greets the viewer by artist, Vik Muniz (Decent from the Cross). I could spend an hour studying this single, magnificent piece. (We could use a bench here). I must add that the museum employee who watches over the art on the lower floor knew a great deal about this piece and others and really added to my understanding. He was a joy to spend time with asking questions during my last visit. The other area to mention is their expansive contemporary art collection.  Overall, if you live in Phoenix or nearby, a membership is in order because it does take several visits to make your way through this gem of a museum."}
{"text":"Came here in the summer with my sister & cousin. Every first Friday there is free admission. There's an awesome room that's dark with colorful sting lights. There are 2 or 3 other spots you can't enter unless you pay. Also I believe one of Simone Biles family members had there wedding here."}
{"text":"Stepped out of my comfort zone to experience some different in the city. I did my research about local museums, I came across this gem!   Admission: Save yourself some cash and visit on Wednesday night 3-9pm for FREE!   Parking: Please keep in mind that \"free\" will bring many so you might have to circle parking lot a few times but trust me it's worth it.   Art: I walked in to friendly faces that explaining that the museum has 3 levels to explore with special exhibit($5.00) if I wanted to check it out. As you walk through the atrium this amazing light structure catches your eye. Continue through the main hallway and this amazing display of birds on the wall caught my eye. I could not wait to continue to explore more... I will say I did not make it through all 3 levels but I will be back to continue on level 2! I am so glad I went to museum."}
{"text":"The Phoenix Art Museum is incredibly beautiful and offers some great exhibits. I especially loved the upper level (North Wing) which had some great Spanish colonial and 19th century European art. Admission for under 17 is $6. Only downside is that I was not initially allowed access to gift shop without a chaperone, due to being on a school scheduled trip and I guess there was fear \"I might steal\". Incredibly infuriating as I had paid the general admission and should have a right to shop."}
{"text":"Today we ventured to the Phoenix Art Museum to see the Tony Foster:  Searching for a Bigger Subject exhibit.  Generally speaking, I am not a fan of watercolors as they tend to have muted colors.  But that is definitely not the case with Tony Foster.   His paintings were alive with color, and because his medium is watercolor, there seemed to be a sort of deference to the majesty of the Grand Canyon.  As I stood in front of his creations, I felt as if each canvas were a blog post of sorts.  Besides the articulate capturing of the scene before him, Foster also includes a little story on the bottom of each painting, as well as a few artifacts, and even various colored soils, sorted in small vials, affixed to the painting.  Each painting was a story in paint, text, objects, and soil.  Tony also, in his texts, did a wonderful job bringing you into the scene as he describes encounters with rattlesnakes, tarantulas, birds pooping on his canvas, California condors peering down at him like he might be their next lunch, frigid 28 degree temperatures, passerby's bringing him cookies, sudden rainstorms threatening to ruin his paintings, and much more.  All in all, it was a wonderful escape into the mind of Tony Foster, replete with a view from his very own pupils.  We thoroughly enjoyed his work, and would recommend it highly."}
{"text":"Coming from Europe and having lived in Boston it's been a difficult realization that art museums in the PHX area just can't measure up. I visited in the evening of the first Friday of the month, meaning free admission. If you prefer less crowds and noise, I'd recomend paying.   Personally, I found the collections very oddly curated with seemingly random pieces thrown together. Just because something has the same national origin doesn't mean it should be displayed together. I also wish that more extensive descriptions of art pieces and artists would have been provided.   I very much hope that the PAM, over time, will get its hands on some more art pieces."}
{"text":"Pretty good exhibits and a better museum than I expected for Phoenix. I had a good time and was able to see plenty.  I especially appreciate the traveling exhibits."}
{"text":"My 18 yr old nephew chose this museum to visit while staying with us for a few days. We both enjoyed the exhibits and the layout. It was larger than I expected. Of course, the location is ideal for continuing the day to visit local eateries, coffee shops or other museums. It was an enjoyable day."}
{"text":"Def make a visit especially when there is an exhibition that interests you.  Make sure you hit up the firefly exhibition.  The modern art can be hit or miss but regardless there is always something interesting and new to see."}
{"text":"Had a fairly good selection even though most of the museum was under construction. Loved the dark room exhibit"}
{"text":"Let's be honest, Phoenix has developed a reputation as a city without any culture. It's institutions like the Phoenix Art Museum that are proving how untrue that statement is!   Phoenix Art Museum is one of my favorite places in town, with the standard awe-inspiring pieces as well as traveling exhibits that keep me coming back. It's a great mix of new artists and classics like Picasso and Monet...and includes some great exhibits like Peter Wegner's Guillotine of Sunlight or my personal favorite Yayoi Kusama's fireflies exhibit. Step into this darkened room and experience millions of \"fireflies\" in a moment you'll never forget.   With great promotions like Target's free Wednesday nights and great programs for the under 21 crowd, the Phoenix Art Museum stands as an example of all that the Phoenix cultural scene has to offer."}
{"text":"Honestly, I saw some things here which I cannot describe.  It's not that I don't *want* to describe them (what good is secret art, right?), and it's not like I don't have a decent command of the language.  Heck, it even occurs to me that I've been hitting more than my fair share of museums of late.  That said...I literally saw things here that were as visually arresting, as challenging to the senses, as anything I've seen in many moons.  Things that made you question your perspective from both a literal and figurative sense, and I came away impressed.  Phoenix, you have a great museum right in your backyard.  And if you weren't positive of that already, they're busy lining things up all the time to make that a forgone conclusion.  I'm not just talking about some of the amazing pop art I saw (a weakness of mine, admittedly), the haute couture fashions designs that were pretty amazing up close (with stylized photos of the intricate stitching to boot).  I saw some things here that were as amazing as they were immersive, and if I lived closer, you can be certain that I'd darken the door lots.  If you do nothing else here, do try to find the spatial light installation:  what I can only attempt to describe as spatially placed color evolving pendant lights in an otherwise pitch black space, encased in mirrors.  You won't know where you are, exactly, but you'll scarcely wanna leave.    They're bringing in the King Tut exhibit one day soon, but don't wait until that hits to stop by.  You find something here to make your senses, even your sense of self, tingle."}
{"text":"Returned on 8/15/09. Still as cool as always. There were a lot of the same exhibits, guessing it's the museum's collection. However, there were some new and exciting additions. In particular, the low rider on display as part of the post-chicano movement art scene.  The new items for this series were every cool and were stepped in graffiti culture. There is also a new collection of watercolors that is amazing because of the scale of the paintings."}
{"text":"I went to see the Ann Banofy Taylor exhibit.  It was fascinating and really explained why couture is an art form.  The clothes were stunning and the subject led a fascinating life.  The museum overall was really a world class building.  They have many more pieces than I remember and I love the clean space.  It feels very open and free versus the old museum, which felt very cluttered.  Fascinating."}
{"text":"I came here to see the Hollywood Costume exhibit that I purchased a Groupon for. There was quite a long line to get our tickets & the lady at the door was very unfriendly.  But it was all okay because once we got in we went straight to the exhibit and we were really impressed.  I loved reading about the costume designers & their thoughts for designing the different outfits.  It took a bit to get through it all since some people were going VERRRRY slowly through the exhibit & others would just cut in front of you as you are reading. We also enjoyed all the cute items they had in the gift shop.  We wanted to stay & check out the rest of the museum but we were pretty short on time.   We will be back soon to look at the other areas."}
{"text":"We didn't have a great visit but maybe the problem is that I brought 3 children with me to experience the art?"}
{"text":"For an Art Museum away from a place like New York or Washington DC, this place is really great.  They have a fairly sizable and diverse collection, and they have great special installations coming through all of the time.  You can easily spend an entire day here.  The space is absolutely beautiful and is among one of the more lovely museums I've been in.  Admission prices are fairly cheap, as are memberships.  The museum is a real jewel for Phoenix."}
{"text":"On the day I visited, many of the exhibits and galleries were closed due to one reason or another--preparing for a fundraiser, renovation. The Contemporary Art collection was really limited and unimaginative. There were very few multimedia works, or multidimensional works. There was a lackluster collection of coture clothing which were not contextualized in any way, shape, or form. Why would these clothes be art? No clue there. Frankly, smaller museums such as the Denver Museum of Art/Albuquerque Museum, and the Panhandle Plains Museum, do far better in their breadth and depth, respectively.  The only really good thing about the Phoenix Art Museum are their grounds. Great willow acacia trees and fountains! I felt the building was arid and sterile and at the same time dark."}
{"text":"There is so much to say about the Phoenix Art Museum that one review won't begin to cover its amazingness. Having lived in Paris, I admit I was skeptical as to what an art museum in the desert could offer to the creative senses. But, the heat of the summer found me drumming up things to keep my daughters mind flowing and her educational senses peaked and this was one of the places I felt was a no-brainer. There was no way to see everything in one visit. Mind you, we took advantage of coming on a Wednesday evening when admission is free from 1700-2100 and after having dinner at a nearby downtown favorite. The museum on first glance is expansive and like most museums.. appealing to the eye. There are free lockers upon entering if you don't want to lug around your garb or purses that you can't leave behind in the heat. The museum is ever changing ; so it's highly likely on your next visit , you won't see the same artifacts or displays again. A museum should get your mind working and this museum does that in every way; In the words of Andy Warhol : \"Don't think about making art, Just get it done. Let everyone else decide whether it's good or bad, whether they love it or they hate it; and while they are deciding : make even more art.\" That is what a museum is about, in my opinion. Art is made from the creative vision of its artist. The Phoenix Art Museum gives you so many different sides of art, it's actually mind blowing.  There are courtyards to take a break from the inside and think of all you have just witnessed and there is a cool cafe too. The art shop offers closes a little earlier than the actual museum, in case there is a creative souvenir you can't live without. First Friday's also begin here and the shuttle picks up outside of the museum. My daughter was in awe of so much on display ... we took most of the time allotted and the announcements of the museum now being closed reminded us that it was time to leave and head back to the world of technology and time. We can't wait to go back.. and for a few hours, let our inner creative wander and leave the real world behind."}
{"text":"Five Good Things and Five Bad Things About The Phoenix Art Museum: Or Ten Things You Can Say About The Phoenix Art Museum and Sound Pretentious.  Good Things  1: Yayoi Kusama' piece \"You Who Are Getting Obliterated In The Dancing Swarm Of Fireflies\". If you were lucky enough to be in any city were the Ecstasy exhibit toured a few years back, this will definitely bring back memories of that experience. This was the one piece that I felt really made the visit to this place. It's probably the most engaging piece they have at this museum. It's like Cornelia Parker's \"Anti-Mass\" on acid (a piece which is also housed in this museum and worth checking out).  2: The samurai armor and weapons section. Overall, I thought the Asian Art exhibit at the museum was kinda \"meh\". It's the usual pottery and calligraphy fare, but this was something I was not expecting and was pleasantly surprised.  3: The Khalo, Riveras, O'Keefes, Picasso, Keith Harring, and Candida Hofer. These are really the finest pieces of non-classical art that are housed here. Be sure to check them out.  4: The museum has a couple of lookout spots with great views of the city hidden away at various corners.  5: The architecture and design of the building alone are works of art. Everything from the fountain outside to the spaces created inside that really allow you to engage in the art form.   Bad Things  1: For me, the art here is kinda hit or miss. I feel like a few of the pieces are really good and engaging, where some of others are just average to dull.  2: Waaaaaaaay too much Western Art. I know it's a part of our state's history, but really? I could go to some gallery in Old Town that pedals this stuff to tourists and old money in Scottsdale whose idea of fine art is a place mat set from the Louvre.  3: The last couple of traveling exhibits that came through here are so-so. Generally, all art museums are like this. Not everything they decide to show is going to please everyone, and I can accept that.  4: There really aren't a whole lot of sculptures or installations here. I don't think the museum should limit itself to a majority of paintings and photography. Something different would probably break up some of the monotony you start to feel after 30 mins.  5: The museum's store kinda sucks. I like a museum store to have tons of books, dvd's, or other hard-to-find art-related items that I can really only get at a museum store. I felt like this place was decently stocked with their books but everything else is just kinda kitschy shirts and an overload of Frida Khalo memorabilia."}
{"text":"Wonderful museum with a truly expansive collection covering various styles and time periods of artistic works.   There are four levels with stairs and elevators to help you through and ample parking outside.   The restaurant onsite called Palette is delicious! A perfect rest stop to cool off and get your energy back for the second half of the day (because we spent a majority of the day here)!  There are also docent tours available, but plenty of staff are walking around to assist too.  A must-see if you have a few extra hours to spend in downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"This place is huge, which really shouldn't surprise me as I have to keep reminding myself that Phoenix is the country's fifth largest city. Opened in 1959 and expanded considerably over the years, it takes up about 285,000 square feet, which makes it over twice the size of the Heard Museum nearby (review: http://bit.ly/2IoAcsS). As a matter of fact, I was just coming from the Heard and only had a little more than an hour to tour the museum before heading out to the airport. That was a rather ambitious goal considering they carry over 18,000 pieces of art over three floors. I could have probably used a Segway...and lessons in time management.  It helped considerably that the galleries were quite cavernous with much of the focus on modern and contemporary art. The lobby gave way to Carlos Amorales' \"Black Cloud\", an expansive display of 25,000 black moths and butterflies swarming the walls (photo: http://bit.ly/2pb6AGF). There are plenty of standout works in their permanent collection from the likes of Paul Pletka (photo: http://bit.ly/2pd2qOj), Louise Nevelson (photo: http://bit.ly/2p5kpas), and Anish Kapoor whose black acrylic sculpture, \"Upside Down, Inside Out\" (photo: http://bit.ly/2p7CG6H), appeared like the negative inverse of his famous \"Cloud Gate\" in Chicago's Millennium Park.  There's quite a sculpture garden next to the parking lot with flights of whimsy like Sui Jianguo's \"Jurassic Age\" where a gigantic red dinosaur is held in a matching red cage (photo: http://bit.ly/2p9Djfm). Also on view are arresting pieces like Kehinde Wiley's \"Marechal Floriano Peixoto\" (photo: http://bit.ly/2IpFOTs), Ahmed Alsoudani's \"Untitled (Sin Titulo)\" (photo: http://bit.ly/2Dq1Di3), and Yasumasa Morimura's \"Monna Lisa in Pregnancy\" (photo: http://bit.ly/2tFLe9C). A collection of colorful Alexander Calder lithographs is currently on exhibit (photo: http://bit.ly/2FFy2Dj). Yes, I'm finally convinced this city has a significant art scene beyond Frank Lloyd Wright's architecture."}
{"text":"Irving Stone's Biographical Novel, The Agony and the Ecstasy, about the life of Michelangelo has always had a very special place in my heart since I was just a child.  I remembered this quote from the book as if it was yesterday...  \"Drawing is the poet's written line, set down to see if there be a story worth telling, a truth worth revealing\"  This sums up, to me at least, Michelangelo's passion for his art.  Although I am certainly not gifted with any type of artistic talent, that hasn't prevented me from being an admirer of the Arts, nor of Michelangelo's work.  I have been to many of the best museums in the United States and in Europe to view many masterpieces, but since Phoenix is my home - the Phoenix Art Museum is my place of refuge when life gets too clinical or chaotic.  Whenever I need a pause in my hectic day, I make it a point to stop by either the Heard Museum or the Phoenix Art Museum and just admire the exhibits held within.  I hadn't had an opportunity to view the exhibition of Michelangelo's work, and I only had a few days left before this exhibition moved on, and I was determined to at least take a glimpse of this collection.  I like this particular conviction held by most artists that echoes Michelangelo's...  \"Art is the epitome of human life, the truest record of insight and feeling...\"  Art has the ability, in the hands of  an artist, to capture a visage, a moment, an overwhelming feeling, or a significant event so that others can admire and appreciate this visual representation.  Although there are no written words to elaborate upon what is being taken in, it is up to viewer to ascribe its meaning based on their own imagination. The possibilities are limitless, and the stories that are written in one's own mind are overwhelmingly visceral!  This is just one of the many feelings and insights that I derive from even the short segments in time whenever I visit this wonderful museum. And this is the reason why I come back time and time again.  Yes, this is my alone time; wherein the world and the unforgiving progression of time takes a back seat, and I can just readjust my perspective.  And in that same amount of time, I have sketched a thousand masterpieces in my mind about the people, and the moments that are dearest to me.   I love these particular words in this song that reverberates within my heart...  \"If I had to paint a picture To show the world how true love can really be I would use the brightest colors To create a vision of harmony  It would be a reality, 'cause its only what's inside of my heart You would see I've always loved you right from the very start  Tell me what is the color of love? What do you see? Is it warm, is it tender when you think of me? I see the color of love when I'm thinking of you As a picture perfect painting of love forever true...\" (The Colour of Love by Billy Ocean)  I trust and hope that when you see and are overwhelmed by the masterpieces displayed within this museum, that it inspires and invigorates you to formulate your own masterpiece - capturing that person or the moment in time that is so dear to your heart!"}
{"text":"Great location. Great exhibits. Love the programs! Recently there for a seminar. Wouldn't recommend buying coffee at their museum restaurant shortly before they close (3pm) unless you don't mind cold coffee. Ask how fresh the brew is before ordering."}
{"text":"It's not the largest art museum I've been to, but definitely one of the best. They constantly have new exhibits and there is a diverse offering of art to view."}
{"text":"\"Go inside!\"  Looks of bewilderment. \"You can walk inside,\" the lady explains. \"See...\" then shows us into the dark room.  We were in the Modern Art wing of the PAM, peering around a nondescript corner, and stumbled upon what we thought was a hidden, doorway-sized piece of art. In contrast to the white walls of the museum, it looked like this was simply pitch blackness with some color-shifting lights that appeared to have some spatial dimension to them--maybe a foot or two deep? We were intrigued, and naturally curious, so we were standing there inching closer to the piece with our hands out trying to gauge the depth. We were just about to shrug and turn back around when another patron saved us from missing out on a great experience. \"Go inside!\" she said; and we were so glad we did!  The piece is by Yayoi Kusama called \"You Who Are Getting Obliterated in the Dancing Swarm of Fireflies,\" and it is a walk-through exhibit. It's hard to tell if you're not expecting it. I mean, the museum staff gets uptight if you even stand too close to anything. So, we had no idea you could go inside...especially a pitch black room. But, as I mentioned, we were saved from a potential misfortune by a good Samaritan, and we walked inside.  Inside the room it is very, very dark. And there are lights everywhere! In fact, they hang from the ceiling on strings, so you're actually bumping into the strings of lights as you move around. There are mirrors on every wall, and on the ceiling and floor, so the lights go on forever and ever. And they change colors. Then they're the same color; then they shift in brightness...there are many, many variations, changing the mood with every shift. And it feels like you're floating in space. And...the whole thing is just amazing.  We were so moved by the piece, that I can recommend visiting the Phoenix Art Museum just for the Kusama piece alone.  Oh, and when we were finished walking through the piece, we walked all the way around to the entrance again to save the next patron from missing out. And sure enough, we saw someone turn the corner, pause for a minute, and start to back out. The same mistake we were about to make....  \"Go inside,\" we said."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times. Always interesting and usually lots of exhibits. But, today there were a lot more empty exhibits then normal. Luckily admission was free because I attended the Young Artists Summit, but if I had paid I would've been a little disappointed. That said, the few exhibits that were up were amazing, as always.   Only other critiques that, at the end of our trip, we decided to use this quick photo booth near the entrance and put in our emails so that it would send us the photos. You would think it would send them almost right away so you could use them and stuff right? But, we still haven't gotten them and its been quite a few hours. I'm not even mad that they haven't come yet. I would have just liked to have some estimate as to when they would come. Because, as of right now, we aren't sure they will even come at all.   And the stairs.....there were so many stairs...."}
{"text":"I still have to take away a star because it's just still so confusing. There was no entrance-fee wackiness this time, but I was still completely lost. Don't get me wrong, I love this museum. It's amazing. It's the perfect place to go if you -want- to get lost and wander for hours. But if you're going for something specific, sometimes it can be a little tricky to get to it.  I went to see Making Waves (contemporary Japanese prints) specifically. I wasn't sure what gallery they were in, so we just started out by wandering around. Found some amazing contemporary Chinese paintings. After more wandering, we still hadn't found Making Waves, so we ended up asking a series of PAM employees/volunteers.  1st employee: \"Oh, that exhibit is right in this gallery *points at map*\"  We go there... and it's the Chinese paintings. Not Japanese prints.  2nd employee: \"I'm pretty sure it's in this gallery, here *points at another gallery on map*\" Nada.  3rd employee: \"I'm not sure, maybe it's this way?\" Nope.  4th employee: \"Wait... do you mean you want the Firefly exhibit?\" .....no.   Finally, someone got us to Making Waves, which was in one of the few nooks we hadn't already wandered into by accident. Talk about painful.   Anyway, Making Waves was great. We also checked out the previously mentioned Firefly exhibit, which is a permanent (yes!!!) installation called \"You Who Are Getting Obliterated in the Dancing Swarm of Fireflies.\" It's amazing, disorienting, and totally trippy. Check it out."}
{"text":"I overheard a few visitors commenting on their surprise at the Monet on exhibit. No, you don't expect Phoenix to be a spectacular cultural destination, but this museum is big with a handful of interesting collections and they get some great exhibitions that come through. You WILL recognize some of the artists and you'll likely see and enjoy pieces you didn't expect!  It's a great way to spend an afternoon - I walked through everything in twoish hours, but easily could have taken more time and do plan on going back to do just that! With free admission every Wednesday and during First Fridays, as well as the Culture Pass available from local libraries and opening on holiday Mondays when they're normally closed, they really want to make the museum accessible and remind Phoenicians that it's not just hot here, we've got culture too!   So go ahead and act like a tourist for a day. Plus, after you've worked up your appetite, there are plenty of great restaurants around to rest your feet and talk about your favorite pieces...like the unmarked back corner room on the top floor of the South Wing, it's worth getting all the way through!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for the first time today. We got an invitation in the mail to see the new fashion exhibit and Michaelangelo's art work. Well the invitation had a special offer for membership pricing and my husband forgot it... and we live out in Gilbert. Amy E. at the front desk was very kind, friendly, professional, and understanding- she agreed to honor the special anyway so we got a couple year memberships. I love exceptional customer service- thank you!! She took the time to explain the whole museum to us, the best routes, and she pointed out some not to miss pieces. It was SO helpful. Refreshing when someone can take time with you and engage with you! :) Also interesting tip- apparently my husband can get in free for being a student through the Maricopa Community Colleges- wow (bring your student ID)! Of course I believe there is still a cost for certain special exhibitions/events- but still that is pretty good. No water bottles allowed and the parking situation is a little iffy. Still, we really enjoyed the art museum thoroughly . It was nice to see historical pieces and modern pieces. The Firefly work is awe inspiring. I am very happy we came here and we look forward to continue to visit regularly."}
{"text":"I was very impressed with the lay out and variety. I'm sure by the time you go the exhibits will change so I'll skip writing about individual pieces that likely won't be there. What I'll say is that the place is set up like a maze. Skip grabbing the map and let yourself wonder like a kid. Avoid being around big crowds or selfie zombies and you'll really have fun. Double back to art that really grabs your attention on the second lap. I went through fast and then came around a second and third time to the displays that really caught my eye and wouldn't leave my mind. I then tried to break down what drew me to them. In the end art is about you. Leave your phone in the car and skip the map. Get lost and have fun. This place is up there and beyond any major museums you'll find in New York or Los Angeles."}
{"text":"I took my lady to the Phoenix Art Museum for our first date, last year. We had a wonderful time, especially the Fire Fly exhibit. We are still together and life is wonderful. Thanks Phoenix Art Museum, the tunnel of love.  Followup: We were married Nov 11, 2011."}
{"text":"For such a big city you expect more.  Price is right though.  And they do have some nice pieces and get in some good exhibitions but didn't seem like they have much of a collection on their own.  We liked the American impressionists that held their own next to Monet Arches and Pissaro.  Very helpful descriptions but I did find the layouts in some of the galleries confusing and didn't flow well.  The Warhol was there at the time and was extensive, interesting place in history (was he the first selfie!) but not  a huge fan."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh, the fireflies!  I *am* an art historian, but rarely have moments with art that were as awe-inspiring as my time with/in the Yayoi Kusama piece.  I think my husband was pretty convinced that I would want to buy the \"firefly\" shirt in the gift shop, but I passed on that in favor of a signed Klett & Wolfe book.  Which is a perfect way to transition into saying that the current photography show, \"Charting the Canyon\" is wonderful -- it's whimsical and interesting and definitely worth the visit.  Also, I'm really glad that gallery exists, because without it there simply wouldn't be enough photography exhibited in the space.  All in all, a wonderful museum, and worth the time...and a gift shop that sells autographed books is always a plus -- not enough museums do this when showing living artists!"}
{"text":"The Phoenix Art Museum is a modern art museum located in downtown Phoenix. It is a large and modern complex with lots of parking and located on the light rail system. Admission is rather expensive with special exhibitions adding extra fees.  The museum has a large and winding layout focusing on modern and experimental art. I have visited this museum for many years and continue to be impressed by their choices of edgy and controversial art in an otherwise conservative area.  This is a great option to escape the heat during the summer or for anyone wanting to expand their minds with unique and poignant art."}
{"text":"This is an awesome art museum.  My wife and I enjoy this place so much, we bought the family membership.  We really like to come here on date night after dinner, see and exhibit or two and then leave.  While their permanent collection is fantastic, I'm especially impressed with how many new exhibits come here.  The Madeleine Albright exhibit is incredible.  We really enjoy how much time and effort they put into the plaques and descriptions for all of the pins.  At the end of last year they had an excellent \"cloak\" exhibit.  We are very excited to see the \"Hollywood Costumes\" exhibit next week."}
{"text":"My kids enjoy coming here. I came here and was super excited to see that they had an exhibit called the art of video games. This was an awesome experience taking the kids down the history of video games starting from Atari and Commodore 64 machines to today's PS3 and Xbox 360 while fully explaining and appreciating every gaming console inbetween. My kids looked bored with my take on the history of video games but I really enjoyed it and it gave my kids an idea of what games we played and what they looked like. Ha! really got them interested comparing 8 bit Mario bros to minecraft.  Other cool attractions include the firefly room and the four seasons tree plus all the wonderful art exhibits."}
{"text":"Always a wonderful place to visit! Last time we saw their special show \"Samurai\" and it was well worth  the extra money. What hidden world we got into and what  superb craftsmanship we were able to discover!"}
{"text":"The Phoenix Art Museum (PAM) is such a gem and the exhibits are getting better and better. Under the leadership of Amada Cruz, the museum is taking some risks and I trust that museum visitors are rewarding them for doing so. It is a terrific atmosphere just to unwind and enjoy. At the moment, there is both the White Shirt exhibit - who knew that white shirts could be displayed as architecture that is truly stunning. Michaelangelo is also there - a very first in AZ!! The drawings are centuries old and packed with detail.  Palette, the PAM cafe, also does a terrific lunch. Their menu is somewhat seasonal but also attempts to reflect the current exhibits in some way. The museum shop is also a terrific place to get a unique gift.  Check out their website for exhibits, special shows, discussions and free days. They do a great job. The staff is friendly.  One criticism? That Phoenix area residents need to provide more support to PAM. It's a jewel in our midst."}
{"text":"Have enjoyed many exhibitions at this museum over the years. A few that immediately come to mind are: Splendors of Ancient Egypt, Monet at Giverny, El Greco to Picasso, Dale Chihuly: Installations, Norman Rockwell: Pictures for the American People, Rembrandt and the Golden Age of Dutch Art, and Richard Avedon, Photographer of Influence.  There is also one permanent installation, \"You Who are Getting Obliterated in the Dancing Swarm of Fireflies\" by Yayoi Kusama, that I just have to revisit from time to time. Love the feeling of walking around the corner and \"disappearing\" into a dark room filled with color-changing strings of lights, which are reflected repeatedly in the mirrors that line the walls, ceiling, and granite tile floor. Would love to have a room like that at home!  Have had a couple of less-than-satisfactory encounters with docents/staff and have seen children running/slamming into things totally unsupervised, but those were very few negatives over years of wonderful experiences.   Also enjoy the Arcadia Farms Cafe, which serves delicious meals and desserts.  Definitely recommend.  P.S. Decided to drive out there today after writing this review, and had another enjoyable visit that did not disappoint. Delicious meal with excellent service, new exhibits to see and old favorites to revisit. Even if you don't live close by, it is worth the drive."}
{"text":"As a Chicago native, I'm a bit spoiled as the Art Institute of Chicago is what I use to compare fellow art museums that I visit around the country. However, the Phoenix Art Museum does a nice job of presenting its variety of regular and special exhibitions. It's definitely a great place to spend a hot summer and/or rainy afternoon. Also appreciate that they give membership discounts to teachers like myself."}
{"text":"Very nice!  That's how it starts to be in a new city going through a new museum. And it continued throughout. Very nice.   The design was not conducive to really flow, but there are several niches to be able to sit and relax and just absorb. The contemporary wing has some gorgeous installations, and I could have spent hours in the \"Firefly\" light installation. Hooked on that one. Dissapointed though that a main gallery was in transition, and many stairwells were closed for what seemed no reason.  I am looking forward to becoming a member and seeing new shows as they are presented."}
{"text":"Visited the museum specifically to see the Kehinde Wiley exhibit which was amazing!  The museum itself is impressive and well designed.  Staff was extremely friendly, helpful and polite.  Would definitely recommend a visit if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Terrible experience with my almost 2 year old. As soon as we walked in they said we were not allowed to have my sons sippy cup, so I had to place it in the locker area. Strike 1. We went to the kids area which was really small and boring for him. He liked seeing the paintings on the 2nd floor and finding the horses, boats, and babies in the pictures. He wanted a snack so I gave him a couple of raisins and we were told that he couldn't have them in his stroller, strike 2. We then went to see the Andy Warhol exhibit and he liked finding the shapes in their pictures. He loved the balloon room and the nice art museum employee said that he could go inside and play around in their, which was great. We event to then see the firefly exhibit and my son saw a felt picture with a ball in the middle which he wanted to see, he got excited and touched the exhibit and a lady came over and said that she now has to call it in, and kept telling me we are not allowed to touch anything in the museum, strike 3. I understand we can't touch the exhibits but she kept berating me for my son touching it. My son loved the firefly exhibit and kept wanting to go back in.   Overall the experience for him was great but there are far too many rules for a toddler to understand, which means my husband and I won't be returning for at least a couple of years. It's hard to get my son excited to love art if all of the rules make it difficult for him to sit still."}
{"text":"If you're in Phoenix and are a fan of modern and contemporary art, you would probably enjoy a visit to this museum. The collection is especially strong in these areas.  I don't know if I'd fork out the admission price based on the rest of the collection, but the museum is open late on Wednesday nights and admission is free from 3-9, so that's a good way to check it out.  I really felt that the contemporary art collection had the best pieces. I really loved the Josiah McElheny  (The Last Scattering Surface) in the entrance and the Anish Kapoor  sculpture (Upside Down Inside Out). You know Kapoor as the artist responsible for Chicago's \"bean\" (Cloudgate) and this work is obviously along the same vein. One of the newer items in the collection is a James Turrell that has a prominent spot on the ground floor. And they have an amazing Kusama installation that should not be missed.   There are also a few paintings that I really enjoyed - Georgia O'Keefe - Pink Abstraction, Joseph Stella - Flowers, Italy, Frida Kahlo - The Suicide of Dorothy Hale. I especially loved the Kahlo and how the painting spills onto the frame.  The museum gift shop had a lot of unique items (especially for kids and jewelry), so be sure to factor that into your visit."}
{"text":"A surprisingly classy and well-stocked collection. Props!"}
{"text":"Great museum, exhibits change every few months.  Free on First Friday evenings and Wednesday afternoons.  The bar/restaurant is delicious, and it's nice to have a drink and a bit in the sculpture garden.  Wonderful place to volunteer at.  Drop in and spend the afternoon, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I love this museum and go there pretty regularly.  I try to visit every few months when they have a new exhibit going on and I have never been disappointed.  They have free tours so if you have trouble \"getting\" art then go when there is a free guided tour of the current exhibit."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to the Phoenix Art Museum and it did not disappoint.  We went as part of an alumni event, so we didn't arrive until around 6 p.m., meaning we didn't have time to cover the entirety of the museum's offerings, which really just means that we can go back and enjoy new things next go around.  The array of exhibits was nicely done, and the layout was interesting also as you travel from large rooms with only a few large sized pieces into smaller rooms that have a plethora of exhibits.  The miniature room is definitely a \"do-not-miss\" portion."}
{"text":"Took the family to the museum, wasn't that impressed with it at first. Went through a bunch of rooms, seen a lot of different types of art. Yes they had Andy Warhol paintings there. But not what I was looking for. When I thought we were done, we found a stair case that took us up stairs. There we found the paintings that I was looking for. All old classic oil paintings. They were amazing! That was worth it. Glad we went."}
{"text":"There's something comforting about this museum. Looking back on my experience, I really enjoyed the small collection they had to offer. I do have to preface the ideal conditions for visiting. The special exhibition wasnt too my liking, so I completely skipped it. With that in mind, it took me 70 minutes to blow through this place. On Wednesdays, from 3 to 9 PM, its free. With those two things in mind, Id say come here around 7ish. You'll have time to avoid traffic and still see what they have to offer.  The diversity of art is mostly western, with a small niche for Asian art. Nothing wrong with this, but for the city's official art museum, its oddly small. Although this place isnt big, its deceivingly maze-like. You may miss a painting so make sure you have a map.   Otherwise, I look back fondly on my experience, even if it was a short time."}
{"text":"I finally scored a culture pass from the Tempe Public Library for 2 free adult admissions to the Phoenix Art Museum (Adult admission is now $15 per person). I took my son-in-law and 4 grandkids with me. Kids 5 and under are free (so the 5 year old, 2 year old, and 9 month old were free) and my 8 year old grandson was a $6 admission. So, the 6 of us were able to enjoy the museum for just $6 with our culture pass. Woohoo!  We spent a lot of time in the miniatures room. The 5 year old and 2 year old girls thought these scenes would be really great for their doll house and the 8 year old was filling out the treasure hunt paper work provided by the museum for a prize at the end of our visit and many of the items to be found were in the miniatures room.  We also enjoyed the Asian exhibits (the kids thought the wood oriental saddle for horses looked very uncomfortable) and the American, European and Native American art triggered questions and conversation with the kids. There is a small kids exhibit with art materials for the kids to use. The gift shop was typical of most museums. We did buy postcards of the miniatures room to remind the kids of our visit.  The staff was helpful and the check in process went smoothly and quickly. Parking is across the street from the museum and there is a ramp for strollers and the mobility impaired.  Compared to the art museums of my youth (the Cleveland Art Museum) this is still not quite a 5 star experience, but they sure are moving in that direction."}
{"text":"A work by Leonardo da Vinci on display in this country is quite rare.  An exhibition of Leonardo da Vinci's notes on paper is a must-see.  I drove to Phoenix to see this manuscript called the Codex Leicester.  Comprising 72 pages, the double-sided sheets of paper are filled with his writing and small drawings allowing the viewer to see how this genius thought through complex problems.  This is the first exhibition at which I had to go through a metal detector and that's an  indication of the importance and value of these documents (now owned by Bill Gates).  I entered the darkened gallery to a display of upright vitrines in which each double-side page is suspended between glass.  We are all familiar with da Vinci's artistic ability but it's riveting to see his small drawings that illustrate solutions to problems upon which he spent time.  Like a diary of sorts, it's a revealing window into someone's thoughts.  There is a cool interactive computer screen -- a la Microsoft -- where you can select an image of one of the pages and, as you move your finger across the screen, it translates the section you're viewing.  It adds greatly to the exhibition experience.  I last saw this manuscript in 1997 but this exhibition presents it all much more effectively.  Go.  Now."}
{"text":"Went to the museum primarily to see the Ken Kendrick Baseball Card exhibit. The exhibit itself was amazing and well worth going to if you're a baseball fan. This is the last week for it, however. Also, if you're an enthusiast of all different works & types of art, this museum is a must-see. The Firefly Room was my favourite thing non-baseball related. Go check it out. I HIGHLY recommend it!"}
{"text":"Nice art museum with plenty to see.  I pretty much spent a whole afternoon here during my visit.  The museum has a diverse offering of collections but the Contemporary Art collection stood out to me, so many bright and unique pieces that really caught my attention.    I also quite enjoyed the beautiful pieces in the Asian Art collection.  The Fashion collection was interesting as well, but it was tiny compared to what I was expecting based on what I had read about beforehand on the museum's website.  Photography is welcome in the museum except for certain pieces that are marked.  Most of the pieces that were off limits to photography were in the Contemporary Art section.  I loved that parking was a breeze since there's a large lot on site."}
{"text":"An excellent art museum: it's full of impressive art, it's beautiful, and it's vast.  Who could ask for anything more?    Coming from Philadelphia, I foolishly assumed that an Arizona art museum wouldn't have anything that exciting to offer - and that snobbery cost me years of enjoying the extensive permanent collection at this museum.    Since I realized what I was missing, I've seen some wonderful exhibits here, including some phenomenal Japanese anime art, a fantastic and extensive exhibit on video games (think pre-Atari through today), some incredible photography, and more.    There are breathtaking pieces throughout.  For something a little out of the ordinary, check out the Thorne Rooms, a collection of diorama-like miniature rooms.  A lot of the furniture, rugs, etc. were commissioned from the same craftsmen that made the luxurious large ones.    My husband and I became members because it's that amazing!  There are wonderful benefits, like seeing the exhibits early, discounts, etc."}
{"text":"The Phoenix Art Museum is a great way to spend an afternoon! I visited during their free hours (usually $15 for adults)  on Wednesday after 3pm. I LOVE contemporary pieces so that's the area I gravitated towards first, but all the other exhibits were wonderful too! The modern art areas covered portions of all 3 floors. However, it seemed a little sparse, considering the amount of space it took up in the museum. Maybe I'm just greedy for more!! No matter... I'll be back :)  -- check out the Firefly exhibit, coolest thing ever!!"}
{"text":"Since EVERYONE knows there's no culture in Arizona, my husband and I decided to waste an afternoon at the Phoenix Art Museum.  And it's really too bad their collections of American, Asian, Contemporary, and European art are non-existent, for example.  All sarcasm aside, not an easy feat for me, I really enjoy this museum.  Not having visited since the Yelp pARTy, I was anxious to come back.  Granted, I did miss the free food and drink, but it was still a great way to spend an afternoon.  I love the newly designed interior and I hope Kusama's \"fireflies\" exhibit stays forever.  I seriously wish I could camp out here.  I also really enjoyed Klett & Wolfe's \"Charting the Canyon,\" exhibition.  If you are a fan of the Grand Canyon, this is a must see.  The two have layered their images with 19th century drawings and mid-century photos of the same locales.  Crazy inspirational, thought-provoking, creativity here.  With the hot weather ready to pounce, the Phoenix Art Museum is a great way to spend the day.  Just don't bother to look for a fish taco on your way."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots to visit! From the miniatures room to the funky modern art it's a Phoenix must see! My only wish is that they had a better children's area. Love that they are participants of the Culture Pass!"}
{"text":"This is my go to happy place when I just want to relax and walk around absorbing some creative and mindful representations of people sharing their gift of artistic expression. I have seen several exhibits here, Body World, Hollywood Costumes, Photography of the 1940s-present, etc....   The exhibits are always well thought out, intelligently represented, and fun to experience. The grounds are beautiful and the building is comfortably temped. The noise levels are appropriate and I have even enjoyed a Frieda Kahlo sandwich at the cafe.   Pricing is usually fine and the lines move quickly for entry. Museums are a dying house in a world of internet and the ability to Google nowadays. But there is still nothing like walking into a museum and seeing the real thing in person on display. At least not for me. I much prefer this old method of experiencing beauty form someone else's thoughts and hands."}
{"text":"The Phoenix Art Museum is a total treasure. You have to go there when you visit because it has so much inside, all interesting and all educational for young and old.  If you love Indian rugs and cochina dolls, the Phoenix has more original and beautiful examples than anyone else. And if you want to buy some, they are available in the Gift Shop for a BIG, BIG price. Real, authenticated Indian rugs are worth a fortune these days.  You can take tours and the tours are wonderful because the tour guides really love their stuff and are glad to share it. You can go over and over again and not be bored, it's that much fun. Plus, it's air conditioned and anyway you can get out of 120 degree heat in the summer is worth it.  Go, you'll be glad you did. Feed your head, will you."}
{"text":"My happy place, and one of the best parts of Phoenix. I have an annual membership because I come here so frequently. PAM gets big draws for national exhibits and has some remarkable names in possession. We truly have a world class art museum, here, folks!!!  Go. You'll be happier than Pharrell in the moments before he lost the Oscar. Go! Go!"}
{"text":"I'm adding \"great place to find a gift\" to my review of Phoenix Art Museum. While searching for a birthday present for my photography loving Mom, I immediately thought of the Phoenix Art Museum. I found a great gift for her at the museum gift shop and I also got to enjoy the latest exhibits and have a nice Arcadia Farms lunch all in one visit. Now that's birthday shopping at its finest!"}
{"text":"The outdoor temperature and outdoor garden setting were just right for the first multi-media showing of \"Diego Rivera's Murals Under The Stars\" outside of CA.  Having been privileged to visit Diego Rivera's Museum in his native Mexico and close-up viewing of several of his famous political murals I felt it necessary to attend the PHX Art Museum event.    The tickets were pricey (loss of a star) but when you see saw four laptops hooked up to a bank of projectors and a large screen with wide aspect ratio you could tell this was not going to be your usual slide show and indeed it was not.  As the sky darkened one of the murals was tested in a four photo wide format requiring multiple image alignment. The final effect was totally different and in some respects more impressive than the IMAX format.  Four separate images had to be aligned and projected which turned out to be a remarkable way to display the colorful murals  Diego Rivera painted in San Francisco, Detroit, New York and Mexico in the 1930's and 1940's.  The lecturer from the Latin American Latin Alliance started with early photos and paintings of Diego Rivera with some common and several uncommon paintings.  When the first mural was projected it jumped out at you with color and detail that is hard to grasp unless you have seen them in person.  In person it is easy to photograph a portion of a mural but to view an entire mural is only possible with your eyes. Many of Diego Rivera's life works were shown along with a crisp but all too short history otherwise we could have been there all night.  I knew all night was a possibility based on the time it took a well known Mexican lecturer in Mexico to explain the intricate political history of a single mural on the ceiling and side walls of a government building. There were at least a half dozen murals including photos of the mural commissioned by the Rockefeller family but since destroyed due to its controversial political overtones of a painting of Lenin.  The details in every mural is mind boggling and a complete story in itself.  The Detroit mural of the history of the auto industry looked awesome and may or may not be a good reason to visit Detroit (?).  In my opinion anyone with Mexican heritage and those without should make an effort to view one or more murals in his/her lifetime.  The lecture lasted a little over an hour followed by appetizers, cash bar and the Mexican band Jaleo and singer Kiara Duran for another hour or so.  The entertainment was outstanding and including elaborate dance steps by the Duran family including Kiara's mother and her son.  All in all an entertaining evening under the stars with just the right temperature before the real heat begins as it seems to do every year I have lived in AZ.  I keep hoping for an ocean breeze in July but it never seems to happen."}
{"text":"Dropped by the Phoenix Art Museum as a solo guest on a random weekday~ I was excited to check this place out and was even happier to be able to get in for $13 with my student ID! A lot of the paintings and exhibits here were AMAZING. I was seriously in awe and was able to really take everything in since it wasn't too crowded when I dropped by. I would love to give this place a 5/5 but a few of the exhibits were closed off when I went in and there was a lot of construction taking place in one particular area of the museum. This made is a bit difficult for me to really explore all of the art in the museum and also felt slightly disruptive in a way. Overall, a great experience in Phoenix and definitely a place to drop in on if you are trying to escape the summer sun!"}
{"text":"what a beautiful place. although we only saw a fraction of it (it was the site of 2012 Phoenix Devoured), i was highly impressed at all the art pieces we did see. the area was completely spacious and at times, seemed utterly expansive. the courtyard was immaculately groomed, with lots of paths and even the museum showcased some food for the event.   their food options were exceptionally tasty and would be a dining option even if you didn't go to the museum itself. i especially liked the big bang sculpture in the lobby and the giant red dinosaur out front."}
{"text":"Loved the location for First Fridays! I loved the older crowd and more of a family atmosphere. The exhibits were absolutely wonderful. Coming from NYC and Chicago, I was not expecting too much having been spoiled with the likes of the Met, Moma, Art institute of Chicago, and museum of contemporary art in Chicago, but I was wrong! There was a special under water theme area with adorable DIY crafts and nibbbles (similar to first friday in Chicago). The fashion section was also great as was the modern exhibits with heavy hitters like my favorite Rothko. I grew a lot of appreciation for some new artists. The museum is a great size in that it is actually accomplishable in a night and similar in size to the Guggeheim. Some areas leave something to be desired but I have no regrets leaving. It was a fabulous time."}
{"text":"The Ann Boenfy Taylor exhibit was very enjoyable and the people working there are so nice. This musuem is beautiful and the bldg is so pretty as well."}
{"text":"There's fantastic art to be seen here! Everything about this museum is great -- from the literal walls  (architecture) to the art within them!  I'm partial to tours, personally. I like to know a little more than the title and artist which can be read on the plaques. It helps me to hear some background about a piece to generate more curiosity about the work. I strongly recommend spending a little time exploring their website before you go to read up on the pieces. It really gives your appreciation of the art a whole different perspective.  The films and lectures are interesting -- learned a lot about Ansel Adams, for example. I especially enjoyed the Cezanne exhibition. Some of my favorites from the \"regulars\" are the Philip Curtis room and the conceptual work: Guillotine of Sunlight. Of course, everyone loves Yayoi Kusama's fantastic installation!   It's only $10 admission to begin with, but the admission fee is waived for a  donation on First Fridays from 6-10 pm and Wednesdays from 3-9 pm. And, those days they're open \"late,\" otherwise, they close kinda early (5 p .m.)   Or, just join (I think it's $75) and support culture in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"I had to journey to the Phoenix Art Museum for a class project and I was going to put it off until a Friday evening but then I came across something on their website that caught my eye. Apparently on Wednesdays from 300pm-900pm the museum has no admission for students, Im not sure if its only for students or if its for everyone but once I saw that I made a trip of it. The museum is totally worth the admission fee (I learned after my voyage) but everyone likes to save money when they can :)   The exhibits are well put together and I was very surprised by the collection.  The Museum employees were so very nice and of course, very knowledgable of the museum and its contents.  All in all it was a wonderful evening, I spent two and a half hours with my girlfriend and we absolutely loved it. I will try and visit the museum more, next I would like to see The Heard Museum... up the street."}
{"text":"The staff here is always so nice. I love coming to the museum. It's always a nice time walking around and outside is clean and beautiful! They have amazing pieces that I love seeing over and over again as well as new additions. I went with a girlfriend on Wednesday after lunch and we had an amazing time."}
{"text":"Wednesday afternoons are free - and you MUST take advantage of this!    There are new exhibits every few weeks, and once you have been a few times, you start to pick out special pieces that become familiar and expected, and yet always continue to intrigue and inspire!   My favorite thing to do is listen to a meditation podcast or instrumental music (not classical - but latin, indian... something interesting) and take in the art with my own soundtrack going.  Very art-school, I know - but totally fun and indulgent :)   Please go and enjoy!   (*also, the staff there is friendly and helpful and do not hover or stand weirdly close to you while you look a things. this is a big plus)"}
{"text":"Went with a friend to see the Andy Warhol portrait exhibit which was very good.  The museum is modern and has plenty of parking.  It is well-airconditioned and offers free wifi but it doesn't work well in some areas.  They have a wide variety of art including fashion, photography, ceramics, Native American, Latin American, modern, contemporary, European art etc.  It would be easy to spend an entire day here.  They open at 9 am but are closed on Monday and Tuesday.  Most nights open until 5 pm but later on Wednes and first Friday of the month.  They have a very nice museum shop that has a nice variety of books, jewelry and other items.  It is well worth a visit."}
{"text":"Great art museum - we happened to visit on the first Saturday of the month, so we go in free with of Bank of America cards (score!). This museum doesn't have as many \"big\" name pieces, but there is enough substance and interest in the exhibits to keep you occupied for hours. We loved the Ansel Adams exhibit, which took up most of our time. Incredible so see so many of his prints as well as videos and artifacts from his life. The sculpture garden was also great to stroll through, and since it was a lovely day it was especially nice to walk outside. There was also a flowers/art thing going on, where local florists were designing floral arrangements based on specific art pieces in the museum. Their pieces were displayed next to the art that inspired them - this was really cool! I will definitely be back to visit next time I am in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Definitely a full day trip...I didn't realize how big this place is..we enjoyed the different exhibits, hopefully next time I'll get to see everything."}
{"text":"I'm so grateful that we have this lovely museum because these are some of the exhibitions that have come through here and stayed with me:  Frida Kahlo Rembrandt Passport to Europe Ansel Adams Cezanne Defining Moments - Judy and Sidney Zuber  Really great spots inside here to steal some time to just sit and reflect.  By far, one of my favorite places in Phoenix."}
{"text":"'Twas my first time visiting this museum - and before I get into anything else, let me say that the art was definitely impressive.    Now, that's out of the way.  Let's talk about the rest of the experience.  Remember when you'd go into an antique store - or a fancy place when you were a child?  And someone would follow you around whilst leering - making sure you weren't going to destroy anything - or ruin expensive pieces?  THAT is how we felt for close to two hours as we wandered the various exhibits.    Was that necessary?  I don't think so.  I was told no less than four times that I wasn't allowed to take pictures of certain pieces because \"they didn't have the rights to it\" when there were no signs explaining so.  Even in the gift shop, surrounded by children, we were followed and judged unneccessarily.    I'm a big guy, with an even bigger personality - but that doesn't mean I should be treated like a twelve year old with a can of spray paint.  Truth is, it only makes me want to misbehave.  At one point, Angie pointed something out that was in a glass case, and out of nowhere a lady swooped in and basically slapped her hand and stated, \"uhh, it's REALLY tough for us to get fingerprints off of these glass cases - so if you could NOT touch anything, we'd appreciate it\".  In other words, I felt like I was stuck in a cubicle being Lumbergh'ed - on a SUNDAY no less?!?  No thank you.  I will not be back, nor can I recommend the experience for anyone unless they're a mute amputee.    Side note - the art of video games exhibit was underwhelming.  The displays were fun, but if you're going to have examples of the various consoles throughout the years, why in the world would you not have each of them set up with the ability to play?  There was an Atari w/ Pac Man and a classic NES w/ Super Mario Bros. set up - but hundreds of people and only two screens."}
{"text":"What a wonderful museum! I especially liked the modern art area. Went with 2 adults, a 9 and 4 year old and 3 month old. In many museums this would be frowned upon especially by other patrons but we were pleasantly surprised. Unfortunately, the kids area was closed the day we were there. Thank goodness they were all quite happy to check out the other exhibits! We only made it through about half of them before deciding that it would be best for us to leave the others for another visit. Loved the courtyard outside and would love to go back sans kids for a meal at the cafe. It will likely be a while before that happens because EVERYDAY the kids ask when we're going back!"}
{"text":"I had some extra time the other day and stopped in here to kill some time.  I'm a member and have been here on many occasions.  I really like the Philip Curtis paintings."}
{"text":"This was such a neat idea to come see this place. I spends a good 2 hours wondering around looking at all forms of art. From modern exhibitions to Masters. I'm not an artsy person but I can appreciate the details these artists put in there work. What a cool place to come visit."}
{"text":"Wow! I was pretty blown away. The quaint Asian exhibit is a nice intro, but the modern art is what really takes the cake. Like Guy said, the Yayoi Kusama piece \"You Who Are Getting Obliterated In The Dancing Swarm Of Fireflies\" is worth going for on its own merits. I won't give any surprises that this great museum holds in store for you, you'll have to discover the magic yourself.  Come here on a Tuesday, it's FREE!! And I wouldn't bother much with the audioguide, but it's free too...so it doesn't really hurt. Bring some headphones if you don't want to hold it up to your ear all the time.  I'd recommend anyone visiting the Phoenix area to check this place out. Go go go!"}
{"text":"PAM is a terrific museum, and it just keeps getting better!  Check out the Sassoon Ivories."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed wandering around and checking out the art work.  They have some fairly large pieces and the open, airy space provides plenty of room.   There were some interesting pieces and others that left us scratching our heads (is this art?)  but that's what art is all about, right?"}
{"text":"If the Phoenix theater has a matinee show it could be difficult  to get a spot out front in lot.  It was hot but I walked around the block but that led me to discover Giant Coffee ( a shop with great pie) and A Cancer Survivors Park next door to shop. I digress. Super spacious lobby with a walkway to sculptures and other art presentations. I spent 3 leisurely hours here but had I come earlier might've seen more. There were little workshops and dance performances to watch. I enjoyed what I saw and look forward to a return visit."}
{"text":"I had to wait a few days to write my review of the Phoenix Art Museum because I thought I would be able to process everything I saw during a recent visit.  I was wrong.  I think I need to go back again and again because there is so much to take in... it was my first visit but it certainly won't be my last.    They have so many amazing exhibits and the 4 stories hold so many diverse pieces, i was literally in awe during my tour.  Shout out to Mark P and a huge thank you for walking me through your second home!  I don't even know where to begin, but a few of my favorite areas were the sculpture garden (it's manicured perfectly), the fashion design collection (I learned about the real meaning of 'couture') and the contemporary art collection (specifically 'Mass' made of burnt wood, wire, and string as well as the mirrored, sound proof, LED lighted room (talk about getting lost in time).  There is so much more that I'll have to go back to see more of and the exhibits are constantly changing...  Phoenix Art Museum also offers a ton of events and activities including films, workshops, demonstrations, and discussions.  There is also a really great area for the kids and teens as well as an Arcadia Farms on the premises.  Next year they will be celebrating their 50th anniversary, so I'm sure there will be plenty more unique festivities around that as well... don't wait to go though, go now!  I had no idea what I was missing out on until I went - you should too!"}
{"text":"Dennita scores again with her latest Costume Institute function !!!  The focus was Halston, his work and a strange but highly inciteful film about this American fashion icon prevailing over the 1970's and beyond.  Lots of young stylish men and women seem to echo my sentiments.  Dennita is the chief curator of the Costume Institute. For the last 8 years approx. she has brought needed energy and momentum to this faction of the museum.   We are blessed to have her in our midst!  Anxiously awaiting her next event !  This one was entirely affordable at $20, offering a pre-party with yummy food and a 2 hour film.  Cash bar was reasonably priced as well."}
{"text":"we did date night last night at the phoenix art museum and had the best time!!! wed after 3 is free too!!!"}
{"text":"I love the Phoenix Art Museum.  I love the permanent exhibit as well as all of the traveling exhibits they are able to get.  I have been lucky enough to see the Monet and Egyptian exhibits when they came and were amazing."}
{"text":"This place is HUGE!  It was so much fun to go to the Hollywood costumes event.  It was nice, big, and informative.  Lots of bling, lights, and costumes.  Loved the behind the scenes why and how the costumes were picked.  We finished the event and was allowed to wander around the rest of the place.  After 2 hours here, I don't think we saw everything....."}
{"text":"Great traveling exhibitions.  The samurai exhibit was so fantastic.  This was a once in a lifetime opportunity to see pieces from the Edo period.  That being said, I had a couple of issues with the museum.  I bought a ticket online and still had to stand in line for 25 minutes to get it.  They didn't send me the ticket online.  I had to do will call.  Stupid.  The other issue is the volunteers.  They will get up on your personal space.  My flash went off on my camera and the volunteer got in my face.  Take a xanax and get a personality."}
{"text":"Now, anyone who knows me, knows my creative side of the brain has little to no activity. With that being said I am giving the Phoenix Art Museum 5 stars. I can't critique the paintings, I don't know how to interpret the different pieces, and I sure as hell couldn't tell you the different types of painting styles used, but I would really recommend visiting the museum one day.   I spent a couple of hours here one rainy Sunday afternoon with the lovely Ms. M. She is an art student and was able to explain all the artsy stuff to me. Upon walking into the building I immediately noticed the architecture and would love to have a home that looked like it. It looks a little on the cold side, but very modern and sleek. There is a chandelier type piece right in front that is very cool looking. For the Star Wars geeks, it looks like when Alderon gets blown up by the Death Star.   I went to see 2 exhibits in particular, the Ansel Adams exhibit and a piece called Fireflies. I have always liked Ansel Adams since my father is a photographer and always had his prints around the house and in his studio, so I grew to like them. There are some very beautiful photos throughout and the ones from Yosemite are particularly stunning. The second exhibit blew me away. You walk into a dark room with mirrors surrounding you on all walls and the floor. There are strings of LED lights that are multicolored hanging down and they go off and on at random intervals. It feels like you are just staring into the night sky with the mirrors giving you this sense of endless space. This was very cool and would have been fulfilling had this been the only thing I saw.   There were a few others that were very cool as well. One called \"Mass(Colder Dark Matter)\". This was a piece comprised of pieces of wood from a church in Texas that had been destroyed by fire from being hit by lightning. The pieces of charred wood were suspended from the ceiling with the center containing larger pieces and smaller pieces out to the sides. There were still nails and such embedded into the wood. Again, Star Wars nerd alert, this looks like any asteroid field the Millenium Falcon had to fly through in Empire Strikes Back, last reference to Star Wars. I promise.   The wall of paper in varying degrees of reds, yellows, pinks, oranges, greens, and blues was just visually amazing. The pieces utilize the sides of the colored paper. The name of the exhibit escapes. The last one that I really enjoyed was a piece that when you looked at it straight on, was just a few pieces of metal that didn't look like anything at all. When you look at it from the side though, it becomes an airplane. They have a camera and a monitor set up at the perfect angle so you can really see it. Very cool.   So, even if you don't understand art you can visit this great museum and try to expand your horizons just a little. I know Ignite Phoenix #7 will be here and I am looking forward to going back to hopefully be able to sneak around to check these exhibits out again.  The two links are for the Mass(Colder Dark Matter) and Fireflies pieces.  http://www.phxart.org/slideshow/index.html#/COL/72157606315913654/3595186209/  http://www.phxart.org/slideshow/index.html#/COL/72157606315913654/2677477643/"}
{"text":"I love this museum. Runs efficiently. Friendly staff. Always has a great exhibit. I've been to the Lifelike 3 times and the Hollywood twice. Don't miss these!!"}
{"text":"\"Stuck\" in Phoenix due to the Blizzard pummeling the East Coast - decided to check out the Michelangelo exhibit currently showing at the Phoenix Art Museum. Wow, what an exhibit! Not only are the drawings on display wonderful, the exhibit layout was very simple and clean, which helped the flow of viewers continue to move. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Limited art collection. Very few good special exhibits. Not of the caliber you would expect for a city the size of Phoenix.   It used to have an annual cowboy exhibit that was excellent, but they kicked it out for p.c. reasons; now the cowboy exhibit is doing nicely in Oklahoma City.   Needs improvement."}
{"text":"A mangeable museum with many must-sees: a beautiful monet, the george washington portrait, a lightning bug room, and some odd mona lisa remakes. Also, a whole room of thorne miniature rooms. A one star deduction due to the fact that some of the mini rooms had objects that looked misplaced and in need of upkeep. Also, it seems I came at a wrong time as a large part of museum is in installation. Lastly, could have done without those weird video rooms but it was an experience. ART!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in the valley - there's always something new here, and it's big enough that I don't often get to walk the entire thing in one visit.   If you visit often, I recommend a membership. $75 gets you in for free, but the $200 level gets you invited to all 4 private exhibition event evenings.  The $100 level gets you invited to two.   They host frequent lectures and all kinds of interesting events. You can always find something  going on, on their calendar.  Some of the permanent collection I am very fond of... Seeing the same exhibitions a bunch of times is kind of like visiting an old friend. There is always something new to appreciate. The rotating and visiting exhibits are always well presented, as well.   Arcadia Farms is a fantastic place to eat, the healthy slow food really fits. I mean, what do they serve at the Met in NY? They have a shitty cafeteria. We have Arcadia Farm bitches! OK so the Met has a huge Egyptian temple and Dutch masters paintings, but we have this weird reflective black plastic concave/convex thing and a dark room full of hanging LED's and mirrors.   There is more culture in Phoenix than the out of date yogurt in your fridge!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! On the first Friday of every month, the museum is free 6-10pm! There is always a large exhibit revolving every few months and there is always something new to see. Fun to casually walk around with friends and family then to go and explore the first Friday food trucks for dinner :) The museum also allows free admission on Wednesday nights! One of my favorite permanent exhibits is the firefly room upstairs, which is a small room pitch black with a bunch of different colored string lights and mirrors. Really fun to walk around! Have not been disappointed yet!"}
{"text":"Love this place - it was great!  We didn't get to everything, and we can't wait to go back and see the rest.  The rooms were just as interesting as the pieces.  Some rooms were enormous and had only a few large pieces on exhibit in it, while others were smaller rooms and had TONS of pieces in them - ex. the Miniature Exhibit (so neat).    We went for an alumni function so we didn't get there until 6:00 p.m. so we didn't get to parts of the East Wing of the museum.  Definitely need to get back there and check out the rest. Be sure to hit up the basement room for some bizarre pieces with a very interesting take on Japanese animation and culture.  Overall: A Here's hoping they change out the exhibits regularly so we have excuses to go back regularly!"}
{"text":"Even though a big chunk of  it was under construction, I was able to spend a few hours there.  The tour guides are friendly.  I'm one of the many who adore the \"You Who Are Getting Obliterated in the Dancing Swarm of Fireflies\" exhibit.  It's surreal to say the least."}
{"text":"I loathe the Desert. When one thinks of Phoenix they tend to put this place on one of the artistically and culturally dry places on Earth. However, I was shocked when I went to the Phoenix Art Museam to see their wide variety and well placed artifacts. I love the Asian section so many interesting things. Even the Modern Art section is very classy and actually beautiful.  You will find many recognizable pieces and famous American Artistry.  Yes the Curators there are Nazi's don't even attempt to take a photo or get too close--They will admonish you.  Can't wait to see the new renovations. 9/28/07 Went Last Tuesday, Tuesdays are Free!! Saw the new wing and renovations to the Lovely Museum. They were great. There wasn't much new art, they just rearranged things a bit, and broke up one of the large halls, They took away my fav modern art piece, with burned charcoal and wood pieces on about 400 pieces of string.  I like Modern art more and more as I get older--strange."}
{"text":"I had the privilege of attending this past Friday for the Phx Art Museums \"First Friday\" event. This time is was a floral themed event.... where local floral artists were paired with different pieces throughout the museum.   It was really very wonderful! I had not been to the Phoenix Art Museum for many years (since the Monet Exhibit). And I had the impression that this time it was MUCH BIGGER than I ever remembered it.  I loved the diversity of the art exhibits. My personal favorites are the more modern multimedia type pieces.  There was a live performance art group when I was there... they were awesome... but very odd all at the same time.   I look forward to attending again next month. I would very mch like to make it a routine."}
{"text":"My husband and I got married at the Phoenix Art Museum last month. This is a review of the museum as a wedding venue.  The Phoenix Art Museum is a fabulous place to get married. You can have your ceremony in the courtyard, in the modern art gallery (which is what we did), in the front lobby, or on the front steps by the fountain. They have an enormous hall for the reception.  Pros:  - It has that modern, not-at-all Southwest feel that my husband and I were looking for. - They do a couple of weddings a year, so they know what they're doing, but they aren't simply a wedding factory. None of our guests had ever been to a wedding there, so it felt unique and special. - There are so many amazing locations for individual, couple, and group photos. - The event managers, Heather and Jackie, were great. They got back to me quickly when I had a question; they included my husband in the process; they were professional and friendly; they thought of the little details that helped everything flow seamlessly. - If you have your ceremony in the gallery, as we did, there's a big staircase for a dramatic entrance. - You can have your ceremony and reception in the same place, so your guests don't have to spend time traveling. - The guys' ready room is behind a secret sliding wall. My husband got a kick out of that.  Cons:  - It's $500 for the ceremony and $4,500 for the reception, so it's a little pricey. - You have to use their bartender, ARTenders, so you don't have much flexibility to keep alcohol costs down.  - You have to use one of their preferred caterers, but they have a long list. We went with Santa Barbara Catering, and they were fabulous. - The marble floor can get a little uncomfortable for dancing in heels. We put out a bunch of flip flops in a variety of colors and sizes (labeled \"Sandals of Relief\"), which were a big hit. - The ladies' ready room isn't that attractive for the getting ready photos. - When you're doing walk-throughs and meeting with vendors, you have to pay $10 admission, but they're free on Wednesdays.  Overall, we are so very happy we got married at the Phoenix Art Museum. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a unique, beautiful wedding location."}
{"text":"Great museum. Coming from NYC where we have some wonderful museums, the Phx Art Museum is a gem."}
{"text":"I've lived in Phoenix for 16 years and just visited the Phoenix Art Museum for the first time last week.  What a huge mistake (my haste, not the museum)!  This place is amazing; beautiful building, gorgeous grounds and massive in size.  The modern/contemporary section was my favorite by a mile, with a collection easily on par with other museums I've been to worldwide.  I can't wait to go back and see what I missed! A+++"}
{"text":"please gooo! Would recommend going on Wednesdays or on First Fridays for free admission, regardless it is still worth it to pay for :) loved the variety of exhibits. Key is you won't be bored. The layout of the museum makes it look bigger than what it seems from the outside, they got the IKEA layout going on without the sticker arrows for guidance; get lost amongst the three levels of art yo. Museum is connected to the phx theater which is where the bar is (stop there first *coughcough).All in all, easy to say that all ages would enjoy this museum!"}
{"text":"My husband and I we taking our weekly date night and since it happened to fall on a \"First Friday\", we decided to head over to the Phoenix Art Museum and check out the Ansel Adams exhibit. We were absolutely stunned by how large the exhibit was when we got there; there were so many prints as well as other misc. items including one of his 8 x 10 cameras.   We spent a total of 3 hours there and enjoyed every minute of it.   On another note, we had actually had our wedding reception in the Cummings Great Hall back in September of 2006; this was the week before the remodeling was completed & they had their grand opening. The events coordinator was incredibly helpful and the reception was even more amazing than I ever dreamed. I would highly recommend this location to anyone looking for an art inspired location for an event.   We will definitely be back to visit soon."}
{"text":"I got free pass for this Phoenix art museum through the Arabian Library in north Scottsdale and I would say, it's worth more than free pass.  Beautiful exhibits! I loved the people book exhibit, I thought it was very interesting and I was surprise myself that I stay in that room for about 30 minutes just browsing different people's books, loved it!  The fireflies exhibit was interesting, but I was a bit dizzy from it.  The Charcoal chandelier was very impressive and well thought, bravo!  I also loved the breezy tree, I thought that was very cool! What about the fashion exhibit, was excellent!"}
{"text":"Rather living in Phoenix or visiting, the Art museum is a must. A great experience and great flow of traffic in the facility.   The exhibits were always a onder to my eye and the dark room exhibit was pretty awesome as well. I like the option to use lockers.   I was inspired to visit Jerome AZ because of an exhibit I seen on the first floor. It too was wonderful.   Lastly, the option to sit amd reflect is consistant and everchanging."}
{"text":"Decided to kill some time here while I was waiting for some people in Phoenix. After all, every city has their own art museum, right? Lol. But this one was worth checking out. Its actually very huge, as in so spread out. Admission was $15 for me (its free back home), but it was all worth it. One would have to allow themselves at least an hour and a half to explore the whole place! So much to say and write about - but because I don't want to give anything away, plus things do change at the museum - I'll just leave it at that. Check it out. Keep in mind...no flash photography! (I was immediately informed that when I was taking pictures...)"}
{"text":"Amazing collection for PHX!! Well never thought to find this place in this city. So next time I hear people saying there is no art going on in PHX...wait a minute! there is a place!!  Haven't been there in a year, but I will probably stop any \"first friday\""}
{"text":"I can't get enough of the Phoenix Art Museum, I come every few months and always have such a good time. I really enjoy the Philip C. Curtis art, it is probably my favorite part of the museum, but the upstairs is also sweet with the more modern/contemporary art and the fun \"firefly\" exhibition. I also came most recently to a Heidi Duckler event, if you get a chance to see her dance group here I would definitely recommend it. The only issue I've ever run into is obnoxiously loud guests, which is not the museums fault. You've got to come here if you never have, or if you haven't been in a while, it's a beautiful facility with good staff and some schools get you in for free, and with a good sized gift shop with tons of cool trinkets, you just can't go wrong."}
{"text":"As if you need to review the center of all that is art and culture in Phoenix...    However, since you're curious, here are three reasons why the Phoenix Art Museum is a must see on in the Valley.  First:  The museum staff brings in one fabulous exhibit after another.  From masterpieces on loan from some of the top museums in the world, to the Chicano movement art on the streets, there is never a dull moment on the walls.  Second: PAM, as some people call her, is one of the most interesting spaces in the heart of Phoenix.    Third:  Not many people know there's a great restaurant inside the museum if you're looking for something classy in the middle of the day.  The best part about the museum is that it is light rail convenient for those of you in town on business or for a convention.  Just head toward the McDowell station, deboard the train, and head to the intersection of McDowell and Central Avenue.  The museum is on the northeast corner."}
{"text":"The Phoenix Art Museum should change  its name to the Temple of Misandry and Racism.  It sponsors a classic car event called The Copperstate 1000 Rally.  I enjoy classic car events and have volunteered at the Pebble Beach Tour & Concours d'Elegance, The Quail, A Motorsports Gathering and the Arizona Concours d'Elegance.  I decided to apply for a volunteer position at the Copperstate 1000 Rally.  I enquired numerous times and got no response.  I thought if I volunteered as a docent at the museum I could find out more about volunteering for the Rally.  Those  arrogant jerks want $10 for the privilege of taking their docent training!  Then I found out there's a woman in charge of men's art!  Isn't that sort of like having Karl Marx run a bank?  I wonder if this is just my \"toxic masculinity\" expressing itself...  I enjoy the company of Asian women.  If it's good enough for Mark Zuckerberg, it's got to be good enough for me too, right?  Not all women like white guys dating Asian women.  I took an Asian female friend to the museum and one of the female docents didn't like it.  She followed us around and even told us we were supposed to stand one yard back from the paintings.  Have you ever tried to read the little 5 x 7 info cards from a yard away?  Being half Italian and from New Jersey, I immediately ratted her out.  My friend and I went on to enjoy the paintings from within the 36\" limit.  Instead of going to the Phony Art Museum, why not take a painting class and create your own art?"}
{"text":"Took the wife and kids a few weeks back to the Museum and was very pleasantly surprised. Loved the layout, art was gripping, kids had room to roam, and the grounds were clean and uncluttered. After a decade of being in busy NYC museums with sooooo much foot traffic, this trip was a delight. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Amazing installations and exhibit. definitely worth the $15 for admission. Would recommend  to all my friends and family."}
{"text":"I love this museum! Lots to see. The first time I visited was during First Friday and I didn't think it would take long for us to see everything, but it did. I've seen the video games exhibit and hope to see more in the future. Fun for all ages."}
{"text":"They always have great art collections. I visited several times for the past several years. I always see new exhibitions every times. The asian collection and fashion exhibition are my two favorites. I can keep visiting again and again and will never get bored.  Many years ago we went to see the movies on Sunday at the museum. I also did took their paper making class before. So interesting and exciting to see what the Phoenix Art Museum offered to the visitors."}
{"text":"Phoenix Art Museum was wonderful. We only had an hour or two so did the contemporary half of the museum, but saw a lot of very interesting art.   People are waiting hours in the cold to spend 45 seconds in her exhibit in New York, so I was delighted to be able to just walk into Yayoi Kusama's \"You Who Are Getting Obliterated in the Dancing Swarm of Fireflies\" and spend as much time in there as I liked. Such a simple idea, but a unique and exciting experience.  Also, you wouldn't think it could be that interesting, but the exhibit with all of Madeleine Albright's pins was fascinating! She had such a variety and I didn't know they were so meaningful.  I liked the layout of the museum space, it was modern, open, and interesting... unlike some older museums with more boring and repetitively laid out rooms. Someone was having a wedding in the Great Hall surrounded by modern paintings and taking pictures in the sculpture garden.  Only dislike was that they don't allow you to bring water bottles in. There's a bin in the locker room for people to leave their water bottles, but when I came back out, my plastic bottle of Dasani (not worth stealing!) was gone..."}
{"text":"Although wanting to visit the Phoenix Art Museum since making Phoenix our new home, I was drawn to visit as not to miss an opportunity to experience the Andy Warhol Exhibit.  That exhibit was not a letdown, neither was the Museum as a whole!  I was amazed at the size and scope of the institution and its fabulous array of art work on display.  The institution has an amazing array of activities abound, depending on how much time you desire to spend there.  They offer lectures and talks, varying and changing exhibitions, a fabulously amazing restaurant for this venue, and an enviable layout conducive to the admiration of incredible works that include American and Southwestern art to Contemporary and Latin American showings.  My only recommendation to those who wish to enjoy Masterworks from American, Latin American, European and Asian paintings and/or sculpture and even fashion, is to visit their website to best plan your formidable and enjoyable visit.  This is a must visit when in the Valley of Sun!"}
{"text":"The docent that took me on a tour was FANTASTIC! She was friendly and very knowledgable. She showed a handful of prices that she chose to tell a story with. I want to go on another tour with her, I know the possibilities are endless as to what they could show us."}
{"text":"Went here on a field trip's many years ago I found this place to be so boring and plain. As a person who rarely seem to appreciate arts. This all change when I recently went to looks at the samurai exhibit. I take all those things said and thought about arts as lame and uneventful. The museum was amazing and breathtaking with the paintings, sculptures, objects, etc. The samurai exhibit showcasing the armors, weapons, cultures, arts was mesmerizing. What a fool I once was for thinking arts was lame."}
{"text":"Went to check out the Video Games exhibit and was a bit disappointed. I thought it would cover more of the artwork that went into game design and that was a very small part of it. The rest of the museum was great though, the upper levels were my favorite. The people working there seemed a bit freaky though, following closely behind-almost scary.  I will go back to check out other exhibits though. They do have a kid area but I would be nervous bringing my 3 year old around the rest of the museum."}
{"text":"Family and I decided to have a day at the museum. Phoenix Art museum was a fun choice. It has two levels. It needs more signs inside and a sign showing the main entrance for the actual museum instead of the theater. Loved the modern art section, the star room was my family favorite."}
{"text":"Little to no parking.  No bottled water.  After having to park 10 minutes  away I was denied access unless I threw away my expensive  water bottle. It's Arizona. I'm an adult. I've been to museums around the entire world.  A first. I'll stick to more renowned  museums , thanks."}
{"text":"PNX Art Museum offers a wonderful array of southwestern-inspired art. For locals, it provides a rich and deep history for our state and for visitors the experience provides a unique look at native and hispanic cultures that are indigenous to the Phoenix area. As with most large museums, the PNX Art is separated (by floors) into several \"flavors\" or \"styles\" all relative to your interests or tastes. And it's never unusual for travelling exhibits to keep the locals coming back to see new items. My wife and I were fortunate enough to catch the Jackson Pollack experience several years ago, which was very cool. The museum is very kid friendly, offering many exhibits that are kid or family centric, it's a great learning opportunity for the little ones. Expect to see local art on display throughout the museum. On a hot AZ day (100+ degrees) this is a really cool place to get inside, learn or see something new, and take in the SW culture that thrives in Arizona. Have fun!"}
{"text":"I understand art should make you think but today I did not want a political art museum.   I'm just a little tired of politics these days and wanted to think of other things.  The big banner promoting economic similarity and communism combined with the video of how terrible America was in Viet Nam was enough to sour it for me. There were other things political also but no need to mention them.  Ill pass on visiting in the future and move on to the Museum of Natural History next time.  http://arizonamuseumofnaturalhistory.org"}
{"text":"I love the mixture of contemporary and classic that the PHX Art Museum has to offer. The exhibits are clean, well put together. It's usually pretty quiet here, so if you're like me and you like to take time to digest the art, it's perfect. There's an adorable outside cafe and the staff is usually pretty friendly. Love coming here, it soothes my soul."}
{"text":"The fashion exhibits are fabulous. Loved the White Shirt and the Emphatics where the background music was perfect, just added to the atmosphere. A great collection of avant garde clothing beautifully shown. The formerly stern-faced guards seemed more relaxed and I even got greeted at the front door. Museum definitely needed these positive changes and created a nicer atmosphere for visitors."}
{"text":"I thought it might be time to update my review.  I have posted dozens of photos of my visits to PAM, and I never get to see everything I want to see in one visit!  I like to putter around for hours, looking at objects from different angles, and reading the blurbs of information that go along with them.  I always intend to return every week, so I always plan on going Wednesday nights (when admission is free from 5 pm to 9 pm), but life doesn't comply sometimes, so I decided I'd buy a membership so that I may come and go whenever I please!  If you're a putterer like me, and dislike ruminating among crowds of people, then plan on visiting during the week, especially on Wednesdays, because that is the day when the museum closes late!  Thursday hours allow you only until 5 pm...  I also know that the first weekend of every month is free admission weekend for Bank of America customers (just show your credit/debit card as proof), so unless you plan on taking advantage of that deal, you may want to stay away on those weekends, as I'm sure that draws in larger crowds.  I'm not positive, but I think First Fridays may mean something special for visitors to the museum, as well.    For those who'd like to walk around unencumbered by purses/bags, items of clothing, and other things that you may be carrying with you, because it's just too hot to leave them in the car, you may use the lockers situated to the left of the entrance, free of charge!  You're not supposed to bring outside food or drink, since there's the restaurant/cafe Palette, so you've been warned.  Certain tiers of support allow you a 10% discount at the restaurant and gift shop, as well as access to events tailored to film buffs, social butterflies, and fans of art lectures and talks.  If you need a break from studying museum artifacts, you may find your peace either outside, in one of the courtyards, or at one of a few museum overlooks, which are furnished with leather couches and chairs.  Perhaps you'll be lucky enough to find one without people speaking loudly to each other, or on the phone...  Oh, and I just found out a few minutes ago that there's an art library, The Gene and Cathie Lemon Art Research Library, accessible to local residents, too!  It's at the administrative building, the Wolfswinkel Education Center.  I've lived in the valley for 13 years, and I just found out about this.  The books and other info cannot be taken home, but local residents may have access to these and other library resources during public hours, and for those who aren't residents, you may search for titles of interest so that you may know what to borrow at your local libraries, or buy at your bookstore of choice.  If the museum, its many courtyards, Palette, the gift shop, and the library aren't enough to whet your appetite for culture, check out the nearby Phoenix Theater!  It's on museum grounds, and I always walk by it on my visits, but I've never had the pleasure to attend a show there (or maybe I have, and I've forgotten because it's been so many years?).  I hope to see at least one show this year, so I'll have to look into their calendar of events soon.  I am really looking forward to my next visit!  p.s.  Fashionistas!  You may peruse through the museum's online gallery for info on the dresses at phxart.org, under the tabs of Collections, then Fashion, then look for the link to the online gallery, and enjoy!"}
{"text":"As a Phoenician, I feel so lucky to have such an amazing art museum available. They do a stellar job at bringing in renowned pieces/exhibits as well as promoting lesser-known artists. They are innovative and forward-thinking, and their exhibits are always installed masterfully. From Chihuly to Warhol & everything in between, I am never disappointed with my visits. Also, the patio at their cafe is a wonderful spot to sip wine & reflect on the most current exhibit.   My final praise is around the way they open their doors for free to the public during First Fridays from 6-10pm. Cultural passes are also available at the local libraries."}
{"text":"Also a BIG fan of the Yayoi Kusama piece \"You Who Are Getting Obliterated In The Dancing Swarm Of Fireflies\". It is a great piece that everyone should check out. My husband and I were pleasently surprised by this museum....it represents a number of art forms, is nicely presented.....only missing a star because the flow from one wing to another could be better. There is also a great cafe....Arcadia Farms...that has very tasty food and a few nice wines to chose from. Our tour guide also recommended the membership which allows for discounts at the cafe and gift shop. We were also told that the library has free tickets to get you into the museum. Definitely recommend the tour as all the guides or docents as they are called are very knowledgeable (18 mth course)...and helpful! : )"}
{"text":"Always wonderful to spend a quiet afternoon at the museum. I can't say enough fantastic things about this place . As an educator, I am so pleased that they offer so many classes for us and amazing field trip opportunities. As a patron of the arts , I love strolling along and seeing new and old exhibits. This museum does a great job of keeping art current and reaching out to the community. Love ,love , love ."}
{"text":"There's no arguing with a museum that's admission is pay-what-you-can after 3 p.m. two nights a week and not closing until 9 at night.   The museum has a couple pieces by Diego Rivera, Monet, Degas, and other well-known artists; however, I couldn't help but stare mesmerized at this blob projection on a three-dimensional object that was babbling to itself calming things when it was green, becoming more aggressive as it turned red. It was in the contemporary art exhibit on the lower floor, and it looked like Slimer from the \"Ghostbusters\" movies. Yeesh..   You're allowed to take pictures in the museum, so long as you don't use flash or photograph pieces that say you shouldn't."}
{"text":"My rating should be 2.5 stars.  First, I just want to say that I really appreciate the Hollywood Costume exhibit being brought here. A lot of the display was impressive and fun. The animated screens and sketches were especially informative and well designed. I loved how the exhibit covered the long history of cinema up to more recent films. The red carpet gowns were nice to see as well.  Unfortunately, the flow of the exhibit was terrible. I wish it was not so crowded because the design of the layout really warranted taking time to look at and read everything as well as watch the accompanying videos. It was too easy for people to cross cut around those of us who had been waiting in line behind wheel chairs and other slow movers. The flow of the exhibit should have been better indicated with signs and limited with cordons. It also might have moved faster if the videos and longer reading bits were set aside with chairs.  One small annoyance was that after I had gotten through the entire exhibit and moved on to other areas of the museum, I was then told that my purse (it is a small backpack) was prohibited. I was told that I should have checked it up front. I was NOT told at the front desk when did I not see the sign telling me that all backpacks were not allowed on backs. I was told to hang it on one arm if I didn't want to get reprimanded further. Other museums with this policy are much more polite about it UP FRONT. I try to comply with policies but I resent being treated the same as flailing gaggle of students with giant school backpacks with stuff dangling off of them."}
{"text":"Very nice museum.  We happened to be in town for their free family day,  and everyone had a good time.  It was nice that they had plenty of activities for the kids. The girls liked the activity tables with the drawing,  coloring,  and building.  They have an array of art exhibits. One is the ones that stood out to me was the Fireflies exhibit bit Yayoi Kusama. It was something simple yet very cool.   One that the kids really enjoyed was the miniature rooms exhibit. Those tiny rooms were so intricate and detailed, the girls loved them.  There were plenty of workers and helpers around to guide and help you navigate through the museum."}
{"text":"I purchased a membership to the Phoenix Art Museum last year and I am very glad that I did.  Coming to the museum gives me a chance to relax and feed my soul with art on a regular basis.  The membership entitles you to bring another adult along so that is also a plus since it has given me a chance to introduce the museum to other friends and family members for free.  Just in the year or so that I have been going it seems like this place is continually improving itself.  I have to admit that when I first moved to Phoenix I was disappointed at the museums here and I still feel like we are not up to par with other cities of the same size.  It is nice to see one art/culture venue that is striving to be better.  I have not been able to partake in all the events that they hold (tours, lectures, movie screenings, etc) since they mostly seem to fall on weeknights.  But I still have managed to see all the rotating exhibits (my favorite was the one on Cezanne and his contemporaries) while they are there.  It is great to have an excuse to get out of the 'burbs on the weekend and come enjoy downtown... or I guess its uptown... or midtown?  Anyway, I think they're doing a great job and this is a real Phoenix gem."}
{"text":"PAM - you are - sexy, sleek, sophisticated and still a work in progress - your collections are young and show in the smallness of them and in the lopsidedness of the collection itself...However, you are good time! And really that is all that matters. The collections are interesting, the docents are knowledgeable and have a way of engaging patrons so you feel asking any question under the sun...no matter how art ignorant it may sound. It was a great way to spend a few hours of the day and I walked away feeling enthused about art and yearning to go back. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Fairly extensive collections that span a wide range of different mediums and eras of art.  There is usually a special exhibit, and the ones I've been to have been superb.  The current one, Paper!, despite the pedestrian name, is actually a very interesting exhibit, for there are some famous artists' works on exhibit at this show, including M.C. Escher, Warhol, Duher, Joseph Cornell, Toulouse-Lautrec, and Rembrandt just to name a few. The paper exhibit is not limited to 2D art, for there are some paper fashions from such designers as Chanel (by Karl Lagerfeld), as well as some political ad paper dresses from the '60s (Examples include a Nixon dress, and a \"Romney for President\" paper dress).  There are also amazing sculptures made from paper that really utilize the medium well.  There is a good mix of contemporary art as well as art from the old masters.  One of the more contemporary artists on exhibit did an amazing woodblock print piece called \"The Triumph of Death\" that spans a whole wall, but is actually made up of pieces of individual woodblock prints put together to form a cohesive whole.  The detail in it was amazing, and it reminded me a little of some of Bosch's cautionary works, except with a Latin twist.  You can easily spend hours here, and if you have a Maricopa Community College ID you get free admission!  Definitely a good way to spend a day if you have free time in the summer and want to escape the heat."}
{"text":"Awesome to stand in the presence of Leonardo da Vinci's brilliance!! The collection of European Art was very nice indeed. Definitely worth a return visit. There were some very nice pieces in the Western American exhibits. The Fashion exhibit was not open and the photography section had a few really interesting items. The front desk staff were helpful and pleasant as were the staff at the exhibits. The restaurant was overpriced and the staff were rude and dishonest. The gift shop is also overpriced and has a poor selection of merchandize, don't waste your time in there!  On the whole it is a good museum and worth a look."}
{"text":"This place is tops.  I've been a member for two years and will always be a member.  I LOVE THIS MUSEUM! I once saw a show about women who fell in love with the Eiffel Tower and some other buildings or objects, and I totally understand because I am in love with this museum.  It has a fabulous, diverse, and respectable collection.  The architecture itself makes the building worth visiting - I'd come to see it even if it was a bank, or welfare office or something.   They have a GREAT Kahlo, a not so great Rothko, some wonderful work by Calder, a couple of fabulous Tamayos, you don't want to miss the Philip Curtis collection, it's super fun, their asian arts collection is really interesting, and oh, they've got some O'Keeffe's that are worth seeing...oh, and I almost forgot - there is this really cool piece of installation art where you go into this dark mirrored room and there are all of these little LED's hanging from the ceiling - you feel like you are in outer space.  It is wonderful.  GO TO THE MUSEUM. NOW."}
{"text":"Really great art museum. My only complaints are these:  It's 106 degree outside in Arizona and they don't allow water in the building nor do they sell it.  \"Palette\" is never open and doesn't have hours of operation   The beautiful black tree made of velvet has no sign as to what it is and the snarky \"don't touch that\" because instead of educating the clearly curious art goer you would rather chat with your colleague.  Overall it was a great experience minus those few bumps in the road."}
{"text":"We visited the Phoenix Art Museum yesterday to see the wonderful photography show by William Clift. It represents nearly 40 years of passionate work and should not be missed. The images are there to be seen and enjoyed. There are no labels or descriptions, just you and the work. It is landscape photography, but so very much more. Don't miss it.   My first trip to the Phoenix Art Museum, as we are new to Arizona. It was a great and pleasant surprise. The museum shows the long time direction of an excellent director. This regional museum is as good as it gets.  Finally, the Palette restaurant was another special discovery. Forget everything you know about institutional food. This is local, organic when possible and delicious. My vote is for the Butternut Squash Bisque."}
{"text":"Some good art (one of  Jim Dine's tool drawings and a mesmerizing Lichtenstein -- not one of my favorite artists by any means; but this was a show-stopper) / some truly fabulous bad art (think: GIGUNDUS romantic painting of the perils of crossing the Alps -- complete with semi-exposed boobies, unbridled fat horses, and skulking wolves) in their permanent collection. Some nice asian art too.  Only gripe I have is: one time, I found the desk staff to be a bit snooty. Here's a tip: Dress up a little if you know you're going. I think the afore-mentioned snootiness complaint may be the result of being mistaken as a streetperson.   That's it."}
{"text":"Interesting collection, leaning toward the contemporary/modern end of the spectrum. Highlights were the Longer Ways to Go photo exhibition (focusing on travel and rural expanses) and the Thorne model boxes. It was also nice to see some local/southwestern artists represented, from a variety of eras including current grant recipients. The rest of the collections weren't really anything to write home about, and the curration of many of the galleries left a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"This is a fairly small museum.  That being said, it has some pretty interesting exhibits. My 13 year old didn't want to leave the firefly room.  Definitely worth visiting if you're looking to kill a few hours in Phoenix."}
{"text":"The museum is beautiful , the building  and grounds and structure etc... their collection is small and somewhat lacking. I enjoyed their contemporary art, the photography, the American  art and the miniatures. Some of the curating is questionable... It seems like it lacks funding  for the art purchases... The  people who work there seem unhappy, the girl who sold us the tickets wouldn't even  greet us and gave us a map for four  people!.. the old lady at the  gift shop was too busy reading her novel to say hello back to me and the security guards follow you like you are going to steal something... I am from Spain and we have amazing museums  with actual valuable work and no one makes you feel so awkward following you.   Everyone there Needs some happiness in their lives..."}
{"text":"We've been to the Phoenix Art Museum several times, but this was the first time we had attended a film (of sorts). It was held in Whiteman Hall and it was a simulcast from the National Theatre in London of \"One Man, Two Guvnors\".  Terrific seating and accoustics and just the cost of admission to the museum.  Highly recommend for viewing of films and theatre."}
{"text":"The contemporary and American art sections of this museum are 5 stars, outstanding! I also loved the overall museum layout and architecture."}
{"text":"The Phoenix Art  Museum was listed as a park and ride hub for First Friday, but it was very disappointing to find out that most of the parking lot area was restricted, and we ended up having to pay $10 to park nearby. It is a good option for First Friday during the summer because you can get free admission and spend your Friday afternoon browsing the exhibits in a fully air conditioned area.  Make sure to take plenty of time because this is a 3 story museum, with 2 separate wings and multiple exhibitions.  The East wing has a lot of religious themed pieces, along with Asian artifacts. They also had various live performances as part of the First Friday program. Very busy on First Friday."}
{"text":"Loved my visit here. I think it was my second or third time. Loved whoever curates the shows because I enjoyed everything! They had just torn down their Hollywood exhibit and that's find with me because I'm from LA.   I recommend that you go into the Yoyoi Kusuma room/exhibit. I LOVE that room! Kusuma loves dots and paints dots and makes dot art. She was a contemporary of Warhol and has lived at the Seiwa Hospital for the Mentally Ill in Japan since 1973. Crazy, huh? Seriously, she must have an art studio at the mental hospital because she's still making some serious art. A can't miss!"}
{"text":"I loved it.  I've wanted to go here ever since we moved to AZ and I wasn't disappointed. It's HUGE! We didn't even get to see the whole place-as a former photography major I was super excited to see the Ansel Adam exhibit. free on First friday of every month. I'm so ready to come back and see what I missed. Loved the vibe and I agree with everyone else..I'm not an artsy sort of person, but I really was in awe of this place. What a wonderful place to have in Phoenix. 3 hrs flew by-I could spend the whole day there."}
{"text":"I love the Curtis collection, as well as the fact that they have traveling, well-studied docents for free for teachers on a variety of subjects. Almost as good as a field trip. Wait, better, because the kids actually got to DO something and learn. A total success. Free Tuesdays ain't bad, either."}
{"text":"to start with..easy to get to in central phoenix. lots of free parking in an open lot adjacent to museum (bring a sunscren for your car windows in summer). beautiful modern, yet inviting structure, much larger than i had expected. inside there are multiple wings with 3 floors of galleries. we visited soecifically for an exhibit celebrating 50 years of the museum's fashion institute. it was a wonderful display of womans gowns from the early 1700s in france thru today. it included a charles jame gown, Chanel, alexande r mcqueen and gowns worn by nancy reagan and kate winslet to the oscars.  i recommend taking the docent tour (our guide on june 18th was great!) which added more insight i did not see an audio tour offered of that, it woukd have added more color and richness to the ecperience. we also did two other exhibits, a photo examination of the oblisks from 1890/that established the physical border markers with mexico and a kinetic art display. the most memorable display is called fireflies on the 3rd floor. great for kids of all ages...if its there when you go make sure to see it. ate at restsurant palette, it was very good and affordable. we will be back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have lived in Phoenix all our lives and have never stopped by before. We spontaneously visited after lunch downtown and to our surprise we got in for free for being Maricopa students and showing our IDs!! The exhibits were so beautiful, overall so happy with the experience"}
{"text":"I have lived in the Phoenix Metro area now for 16 years, can't believe this was my first time at the Phoenix Art Museum.  I came because of Bank of America's Museums on Us program which got us in for free.  This place is pretty huge and extensive.  Currently they were having a display about the art of paper.  I thought this was pretty cool.  I had lots more fun here than I ever expected, and will definitely be back.  Living in the East Valley this was very convenient to get to being across from the Central & McDowell Metro stop.  I now know why AAA has given this museum a gem rating in their Arizona travel book.  Highly recommended. =)"}
{"text":"Wait what?? Phoenix has an art museum?!? Are you shitting me? Really? Yah I guess so...  It's a little bit of everything in here. And when I say everything I mean, stuff from the Renaissance all the way up to and including a lot of modern and contemporary art. They have a few impressionists and post-impressionists art as well.  During my visit here they also had the Mexican artists exhibit. Paintings from the 19th and 20th centuries from famous artists such as Frida Kahlo and Diego Garcia and others were part of this temporary exhibit. But most paintings are modern.  There are two full buildings here, with 3 full floors each so one can come here and be immersed into the arts and sculptures for several hours.  The staff were super friendly. And this is a great museum to take the kids or have a field trip. The museum store is pretty nice and they also have a cafe. They have random tours throughout the day, and it's free. So just jump right in one when they offer a tour. There's a nice little garden and walking path in between the two buildings so take a stroll there too if you have the chance.  So yes, they do have an art museum in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I've been to this museum almost every month since moved to Phoenix about a year ago. They have free admissions with voluntary donation every Wednesday from 3-9 pm when they close. It's also free on First Fridays, and a couple of other days during the month. I've usually gone by myself to catch it on a Wednesday night right before it closes. Parking is free, in the corner of Central Ave. & McDowell.   I have to admit, I've been impressed every time I've gone! Since I'm always coming right before they close, unfortunately, I've never been able to walk through the entire museum all during one visit. However, my experience here has been great. I like to go later since there are less people and I'm able to spend more time in different exhibits without having too many people around me.   My favorite installations so far has been Martin Creed's \"Half the Air in a Given Space.\" Unfortunately, it ended in December 2016. I also really enjoy Yayoi Kusama's \"You Who Are Getting Obliterated in the Dancing Swarm of Fireflies,\" which is a permanent installment at this museum. They have bigger versions of this installation in LA and NYC, and I think the programming of the lights is a bit different, but I still enjoy it every single time.   Overall, I love this art museum and will keep coming back as long as I live in Phoenix. If you're visiting the area, this is a definite must if museums are your thing (or even if they're not - this one is worth checking out in DT PHX)."}
{"text":"We fell in love with the museum and booked our wedding there. The event coordinator at the Phoenix Art Museum double booked our wedding date. She didn't even have the decency to call us and inform us of the mistake, she sent me an e-mail instead. We were told that we would have to choose a different date even though we had already signed a contract for the date we had agreed on. We were given very few options for other dates and two of the dates they offered had a hold on them by the same couple trying to decide between the two, so we couldn't be guaranteed either one. I was very disappointed in how they handled the situation and their lack of customer service. We ended up choosing a different venue because they kept us waiting regarding whether or not we could switch our date. I would only recommend the Phoenix Art Museum if you are very flexible with your wedding date."}
{"text":"Museums are always a great reminder of how art has transformed culture and how culture is being transformed through art. Though there weren't too much to look at the day I went, the museum offered enough to spend a good 2 hours at. Also saw that a wedding was being put on before leaving as well."}
{"text":"They have The Suicide of Dorothy Hale by Frida Kahlo and works by Diego Rivera. Need I write more?"}
{"text":"At the moment I am very convinced of the merit of this establishment.  While I did not yet get to explore it in its entirety, I did get to see a fair share of their collection.  Not only is the building beautiful (I love the open foyers, the hard, straight walls along with the more narrow, intimate spaces.  Plus, I'm a sucker for concrete), but they have a varied collection.  I'm not a connoisseur, but I do enjoy a mix of contemporary, modern, classical etc. art, with influences from around the world.  I felt they provided in this aspect.  And the Hollywood costume collection (though a temporary feature) was awesome.  Granted, I had no expectations -- so maybe that was the key ;)  Beyond this, I really appreciated how helpful they were to me.  Let me explain.  I brought my bike to the museum (it's mostly how I get around) and then realized I had left my keys for my lock at my place...now, I'm not about to leave my baby untethered and ready for the taking.  So, not knowing what else to do, I approached the ticket desk, who directed me to the security rep.  They in turn found a place for me to store my bike in their receiving area!  This is thoroughly above and beyond.   Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my bike ye have done it unto me (is that blasphemous?).  Take care of my bike and you've got a friend/fan in me!  I'll be back PHXArt."}
{"text":"Since my review a year ago for the Phoenix Art Museum I have attended many of their special exhibits and special events. I am still overwhelmed by how much they do and how perfect it all is. Each visit is new and enlightening. Go with friends, go with family, go alone. It is never disappointing.  Each exhibit, each event has been carefully planned and coordinated so that visitors will get the very best from the time they spend here.   Whether you attend \"Devoured\", the Costume Institute's Salon Series, the monthly coffee, the Andy Warhol Portrait exhibit, Read My Pins, the Hollywood Costume exhibit, a Gallery Talk of the Object of the Month, or one of the National Theatre Live performances, you will come away with a little piece of your soul blooming. Life is good  . . . and art helps make it that way.  Check out the First Friday \"free to all visitors\" schedules. There is absolutely no excuse not to enjoy this little piece of heaven in our city."}
{"text":"Art was fantastic and really enjoyable, but the docents/security guards really soured the whole thing for me. Is it really necessary to follow every visitor around like they're doing something wrong? It made me uneasy and unable to relax and truly enjoy the pieces.   I suppose these are volunteer positions, as most of the docents looked like high schoolers, but surely there's a way to train them to blend in with the exhibits, and be unobtrusive unless they are needed."}
{"text":"Went to the Phx Art Museum for the first time. It was First Friday so it was free to check out the museum.   A woman stopped us inside and said she was giving a tour at 6:30 of the Theatre De La Mode ( http://www.phxart.org/fashion/ ), so we gathered around her and she was quite knowledgeable and had good information. She told us alot of history of Paris haute couture. The exhibit was exquisite, I wanted to touch the fashions so bad like a little kid. But they had an alarm around it.There were beautiful gorgeous hand made gowns and dresses by people like Balenciaga and other designers from the post-World War II France era.  After showing us that exhibit , the tour guide also showed us the South Wing of the museum and some other interesting art installations.   I want to go back to the Phx Art Museum. It's a large museum and there is no way to see the entire thing in one visit, they have some great, curiously interesting pieces with facinating backgrounds.  There was a cuban band playing in the museum on this night,after the tour we all gathered near the band and just danced a bit while having drinks."}
{"text":"We went here because my daughter really loves art.  I'm not  a huge fan personally, but I was impressed with the amount of art on display as well as the knowledge the staff shared on demand. A nice way to get a little culture on vacation."}
{"text":"I went here over the weekend with my six year old son and 20 month old daughter.  Apparently my son saw something on one of his cartoons (Regular Show to be specific) that made it cool to visit an art museum, so he requested I take him.  Thank you, Cartoon Network!  I was a tiny bit apprehensive about how my toddler would do, but I packed them up and off we went!  Parking was ample and as we entered we were immediately greeted by a gracious ticket clerk who patiently explained the different exhibits that the children would probably most enjoy: The Firefly room, the Blob and the Miniature Room were the top picks.  He circled them all on the visitor map so we could easily find them.  Our cost for admission was $22 ($15 for me and $7 for my son.  My daughter was free.)  I'd also like to add that at no point did I get the impression from anyone that I wasn't welcome to visit with such wee kids.  I secretly feared I'd get a stern warning that they were to be closely supervised to avoid touching things, kept from crying and disturbing the other patrons, no sippy cups/bottle in the exhibits halls, etc., but I wasn't given any preemptive admonishments or warnings about keeping them controlled and/or silent.  Not that I'm the type to let my kids run free, screaming their heads off, but still, I hate it when someone warns me in advance about watching my kids.    So off we went to explore the museum, and I have to tell you that I am genuinely impressed!  I am embarrassed to admit that I haven't been there since I was a grade school kid on a field trip...  What can I say?  I have been pretty busy for the last 25 years raising kids, holding down a full time job, and just generally surviving.  But mark my words, I DO have culture (and NOT just the kind you treat with antibiotics) yet, sadly, getting to the Phoenix Art Museum had fallen too far down on my list of adult priorities.  Well not any longer my friends.  Not any longer.    Let's start with the exhibits we saw.  First we entered the Great Hall which was full of some really neat modern pieces, including the Firefly exhibit which BLEW my mind and left my toddler speechless; not that she really talks, but still...  At first my six year old was too scared to enter the pitch black firefly exhibit, but I finally grabbed his arm and dragged him in and suddenly he was entranced by the sight and wandered about the room with his arms outstretched exclaiming wildly about how awesome it was.  Let me give you a visitor tip, the Firefly Exhibit is tucked into a corner on the top floor off the Great Hall.  It is very easy to walk right by and it's not well labeled , but if you are near the exhibit with the suspended cube of burned timbers then you are in the right neck of the woods.    Downstairs we saw The Blob, which my son and daughter went nuts for.  I can't explain it except to compare it to the cartoon character 'Annoying Orange'...  It's pretty funny!  After that we darted outside into the grassy courtyard to soak up the sun and give my daughter a chance to get out her wiggles and have a sippy cup of milk.  The courtyard was a nice, open air place for the kids to romp.  It is also attached to a café that is entered from within the museum.    After that we stopped over at the kids hands-on art room, which surprisingly wasn't at all interesting to me and the wall art focused far too strongly on the relation of math principals and modern art but my son and daughter really liked the chance to color and touch stuff.  Then we scooted through the early Masters exhibits (at a muffled run) which *I* really liked and would have spent more time enjoying, but the baby's patience was starting to wear thin, so we quickly hit the Miniature Room which was very cool and highly detailed, and then beat a hasty retreat to the exit.  We got out of there just as the baby was about to have a nap-deprivation meltdown.  (Timing:  When you have a toddler it IS everything!)  In conclusion: The Phoenix Art Museum is a lot bigger than I remember it being back in the late 1970's and the exhibits are varied, beautiful and fascinating.  I highly suggest taking an afternoon and checking it out.  If you have a little one like me, you may want to find a babysitter, or time it after their nap, but make SURE you do check out the Firefly Room.  PS:  Wednesday nights and First Friday's are FREE to visit!  Yay for free"}
{"text":"This is a fantastic art museum. The layout is functional, the installations are interesting, and I love the \"safety zones\" by the elevators."}
{"text":"Nicely curated collection. Large enough to keep you busy for an afternoon but not so big that you burn yourself out."}
{"text":"Was awesome to see some of the more religious pieces and especially the Monet piece. However, when comparing this gallery to others I've walked through it felt small but I still really enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"You can go to this museum over and over again and never see the same thing.  It's a pretty big place, with multiple levels and ever-changing exhibits.  It's a fantastic place to come year-round, but it's especially fun to come in the summer when the heat is too unbearable to do anything outside.  They keep the museum at a perfect cool temperature, so you can look at everything, take your time and get out of the AZ heat for awhile.  They are always hosting fun events like music at the museum or movies at the museum and you can grab some food at the museum cafe or even do a little shopping.   They have something like 18,000 works of art from Picasso to O'Keeffe.  You'll see statues from Asia, paintings from Europe, fashion from America and much, much more.    It will cost you $10 per adult, but plan on spending at least a couple hours there to see everything."}
{"text":"The museum has gotten better since the remodel and will hopefully continue to get better. In the meantime, it still lacks the exhibits (and maybe funding) like those of other large cities like L.A., San Francisco, Chicago, etc.  Don't get me wrong, it is still worth visiting, I would just love to have a museum like SFMoMA that would keep me coming back again and again. The Phoenix Art Museum is a beautiful building, with a nice permanent collection that spans cultures, history and famous names. I look forward to seeing it grow with the city and community."}
{"text":"Very good art museum.  The architecture makes it -- where else do you have the chance to look out a window from a staircase or hallway into a gallery, to observe people observing art.  Free admission and late hours on Tuesday evening help the museum to be a regional resource and to make art accessible."}
{"text":"A really fantastic experience for the family. I was really impressed with the use of the amazing spaces to not only provide engaging displays but also provide areas of quiet contemplation.   The staff is very helpful and are as engaged as you'd like them to be. Everyone I spoke to was very knowledgeable about the areas they worked in."}
{"text":"Went to see the Firefly exhibit and it did not disappoint. The architecture here is stunning, the exhibits are inspiring and the staff is super sweet. I could have spent all day here."}
{"text":"I personally love all art museums so this is very biased. I just like being able to wander a place with pieces of art, in all shapes and forms, and sizes. Now this is no Met, or that really hard to spell Museum in Paris, (also know as the Leuve, or Louvre) I don't think Dan Brown will be writing any mysteries of symbolic code of intrigue that unfolds in the P.A.M, but it's a nice way to spend an afternoon. I prefer modern art, but they do bring in a wide variety of art from Baroque, to Impressionism, and the all popular Cubism. They have a pretty sizable photography museum, and they change the works out frequently. I think my favorite part of the P.A.M. is the sculpture garden. It is very peaceful and quiet, and just a great place to enjoy a cup of coffee from their cafe and talk to a friend. Overall this is a great date place, nothing gets a emo, funky, artsy, girl hotter than an Andy Warhol original or a Jackson Pollack. (maybe it gets me hot) Either way, head to the museum and plan on spending about 2 hours, that is really all you need as it is pretty small.  Afterwards go home and paint your walls with graffiti, or rip up you carpeting and expose the concrete slab underneath,  You have to do something creative!! You could always cut your jeans into jeans shorts...now that is hot..."}
{"text":"Came here for a lecture from a famous author. The theater seating made it easy to see the speakers on stage and the staff everywhere I turned where pleasant and helpful.   It was also an excuse to check out the museum since I had never been. I'm not an art expert or even an enthusiast but I did enjoy the exhibits.   And there happened to be a teen art exhibit and musicians performing outside. This is a great place to take family and loved ones. There's something for everyone."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this museum. It has a lot of great artwork and the collections are diverse too. They have modern art, Mexican, Asian, Impressionism (MONET!!!), paintings, sculptures, pottery, and funky stuff. You can spend a lot of time there. It is spacious and a well kept museum. I really recommend it. I say go on First Friday so you don't have to pay the admission cost."}
{"text":"When I think of paintings in this arid part of the country, I think of Wile E. Coyote painting a fake tunnel into a mountain... but apparently this is the largest art museum in the southwest. It doesn't feel like it.  I mean, it's pretty big, though very spread out.  Though it's the biggest, I doubt it has the biggest collection.  In other words, a big truck doesn't always mean a big penis.  It's likely the nicest thing in Phoenix, and worth a visit.  Especially if, like me, you go on some free day (Super Second Sunday, Cheapskate Saturday, something like that.  With nine departments (American, Western American, Asian, European, Latin American, Fashion, Modern, Contemporary, and Photography), there was a lot to see, and a few surprises.  There was a small wing dedicated to the art produced by the staff.  I think they should create a huge fake fridge and post them on that.  Speaking of a huge fake fridge, I'm primarily a fan of modern art, and I found quite a few installations that would be fitting in the Broad or LACMA (and even a science museum, in regards to one involving a mirror and light).  The rotating 3D tree silhouette was intriguing, as was a hanging rock explosion that looked like Alderaan after Darth Vader's visit, but the star of today's visit was \"You Who are Getting Obliterated in the Dancing Swarm of Fireflies\", which is not a Fiona Apple album but a very dark room with lights that resemble a dancing swarm of fireflies to a Japanese artist, at least.  It's actually very disorienting, and after a while I realized the perimeter of the dark room was full of people who had adjusted to the darkness and I was the doofus in the dark, moving my hands around Jodie Foster at the end of Silence of the Lambs."}
{"text":"Love free art? Come on Wednesdays or the first Fridays! I recently discovered that this place is free on Wenesdays. It's spacious and modern! They've got a theater for movie showings and certain events such as paper making or a gathering for teachers! They've got some really unique events and I can't wait to find out more about this place! By the way, the gift shop is really cool! I'll have to go shopping there for a belt next time! The last time I saw a belt similar to the one in the shop, I was in Bangkok, Thailand. They also have cool ties and some unique items in their shop!"}
{"text":"I'm not an artsy person at all.  Therefore, I just can't understand some of the displays and the fascination with it.  I could very well have made some of these things!!  Hmmm...     The entrance is very zen like and gorgeous.  Many exhibits to see.  Plan on spending a full day here unless you plan to skip exhibits.  The only complaint was the layout.  The map was little help and we ended up asking for directions most of the time.  Also, Copper Square and Chase Field is a quick drive from this place."}
{"text":"Great place to go on First Fridays.  Phoenix has an art walk, galleries are open, food and street art all available, even Ollie the trolley to give you a lift from the Phoenix Art Museum to the main areas of the art galleries.  So Park at the Phoenix Art Museum on the first Friday of the month, free admission, donation recommended and enjoy the museum.  Once your done with the museum Ollie the trolley will give you a ride to downtown where more art and food can be had. As for the museum it has great contemporary art as well as classic art.  It is several stories high and displays several exhibits throughout.  We enjoyed the classic art and  the modern exhibits as well.   My suggestion is to go on the first Friday of the month so that you can enjoy the museum at a donation admission price.  Then take Ollie the trolley to Roosevelt and enjoy local art, street art, and food.  Take in the complete Phoenix art scene in one night.  Enjoy :)"}
{"text":"Made for an interesting Sunday afternoon.  I enjoyed the modern art section the most, though some of the 300yr old European portraits were pretty impressive. There was a harp demo in one room, and several videos to watch. I most liked the \"firefly\" installation. They also have a decent kids section.  It is BIG, and we likely missed half of the exhibits.  They had a festival of some kind going on in the courtyard. We enjoyed the dancers, drummers, etc..."}
{"text":"Yes, the Phoenix Art Museum has both fantastic visiting exhibits as well as wonderful permanent collections--but did you know they also put on an amazing wedding?    My Husband and I got married there in March--our ceremony was in the sculpture garden and the reception was held in the Grand Ballroom.  Their event planners were helpful and always available when I had questions, and the caterers with whom they work all offered delicious options at a variety of price ranges.  The Phoenix Art Museum's bar, Artenders, was a little harder to contact and communicate with, but they were honest and accurate in their billing, and they made good drinks.  But really, most importantly, the entire evening was simply beautiful, and everyone had a lovely time. The art that surrounded us just made the whole evening--now, I am of course biased--magical.  I have had several people tell me (unsolicited) that ours was one of the best weddings they have ever attended.    Phoenix Art Museum:  educational place for an afternoon get-away from the heat, and also a beautiful and memorable place to get hitched to your honey!"}
{"text":"The museum is medium sized.  You can get through the museum in 2-2.5 hours if you go at a moderate pace.  The Phoenix Art Museum is free every Wednesday after 3pm and every first Friday of the month. That being said, I normally don't like complaining about anything that is free but I felt like I was constantly being scolded while I was here.  I was told when I entered, that cameras were allowed.  However, every time I went to take a picture of something, a security guard came up and told me I wasn't allowed.  Only some art has signs next to them that say no photos.  I made sure not to take photos of those ones specifically but I still got yelled at for taking photos of those without signs anyway.  I was also told several times that I was getting too close to some sculptures, even though there was no wire around it.    The museum houses a variety of work but I was not too impressed by any of it.  I only saw 3 pieces of art with recognizable artist names.  I took art history for 4 years in college, I know many names too, not just the big ones like Picasso and Monet.  I'm not saying art is only good if the artist is well known, but I would expect more familiar names. Anyway,  it was free and that made me happy in the end. It would have been more enjoyable if I didn't bring along my camera that was tempting me to take photos. Maybe next time, I'll leave it at home.  So beware of the photo nazis at the museum!"}
{"text":"I was really impressed. We got the museum around 2:30 on a Wednesday and the line was out the door. After a 15 minute wait, we were informed that we  could get in free if we waited until 3pm and were directed to the gift shop and cafe. Browsing the gift shop, everyone  found something they liked enough to purchase-magnet, blank note cards, jewelry. We then headed to the cafe and were immediately greeted and seated. Menu has a decent selection. I split a  salad, the others in my party split a salmon dish. For the location and price everyone was pleasantly surprised. Salad was tasty and looked fresh. The others proclaimed the salmon to be the best meal they had during our trip.   We perused the Wiley exhibition on the main floor and also able to view the others exhibits on remaining floor. It took us a little under 90 minutes. Everyone agreed this was a great outing-shopping, food and culture. The next time I'm in town, I'll be back."}
{"text":"We had a great day visiting the Modern Mexican Painting exhibit.  Upstairs there is an exhibit and hands-on activities for kids. There is always something to see for the entire family.   We had a blast and a great way for the family to stay cool."}
{"text":"Saturday the 19th of March was the perfect, sunny, morning for an Arizona cultural adventure.   I jumped in my Jeep, threw back the top, and headed downtown Phoenix.  There, I met up with Meghann and Melanie at the hip and trendy wine bar/patio of Postino Central.  We gobbled up a quick brunch of bruschetta and mimosas before our planned afternoon at the Phoenix Art Museum.        This was my first visit to the Phoenix Art Museum and it definitely will not be my last.   The museum was originally designed in 1959 by New York Architects Tod Williams, Billie Tsien & Associates.  It is conveniently located off Central/McDowell Streets and walking distance from a light rail stop (which I will probably utilize for my next visit).  It houses over 18,000 works of modern and contemporary art, features traveling exhibitions, presents festivals, live performances and independent films.        As you walk through the front doors of the museum, the first thing you will encounter is a blast of warm and humid air, necessary for preserving the artifacts which are housed inside the facility.   Gloriously hanging in the central lobby is a Josiah McElheny sculpture.   This piece was one of my favorites and not because the guard caught me touching it (the first thing that I saw, oops).  It is a beach ball sized metal sphere with approximately 6ft. poles protruding from it.   At the ends are glass light bulbs.  In essence it is a giant chandelier the size of a minivan.  Cool!         The north wing of the main floor featured an exhibit called the \"Fashion Independent: The Original Style of Ann Bonfoey Taylor\".    Ann Taylor amongst other things was a style icon.   She bought, owned, and wore a custom-made wardrobe.   The pieces in her collection were made by some of the most gifted 20th century designers such as Dior, Charles James, Givenchy, Madame Gres, and Balenciaga.  Her collection was donated by her family to the Phoenix Art Museum in 2008.   I was in awe at the perfect tailoring in some of the beautiful ball gowns.   Meghann drooled over the Henry Maxwell riding boots and I think each of us wanted to run off with Anne's collection of Louis Vuitton luggage.  It was truly an extraordinary display of haute couture fashion.        Our next stop excited all three of us.   We found ourselves on the second floor of the north wing.   Located in a small room (offset from the main gallery) is a collection of the \"Thorne Miniature Rooms\".    Resembling tiny doll houses, each window holds a small replica of a European 13th -17th century interior.   Mrs. James Ward Thorne had them constructed by a master craftsman in the 1930's.  The interiors were painstakingly built at a scale of 1\" = 1' - 0\".    Although most patrons of the museum wandered quickly in and out of the display; these miniatures were captivating to an audience of interior design students.  We spent almost an hour in the small space.   Taking pictures of each one and marveling at the brilliant craftsmanship of each tiny furniture piece.   Shouts from Mel \"oh look at the tiny Chippendale chair\" or \"isn't that a Hepplewhite?\" drew Meghann and myself over, to press our noses against the glass and confirm.   We were delighted.          Moving over to the south wing of the museum we were enthralled to find interesting modern art pieces such a string of thousands of 100 Centavos (Brazilian currency) put together like a snake, a box adorned with knitting yard to resemble faux wood, and a talking projected blob.   We wandered in and out of gallery spaces for five hours; taking in Monet, Georgia O'Keefe, M.C. Escher, Cornelia Parker, and Anish Kapoor.        A long and successful day at the Phoenix Art Museum was brought to a wonderful close.  We sought out a room recommended by the front guard (yep, the same one that reminded me \"not to touch\" anything).  It was Yayoi Kusama's Firefly installation.   We each gasped as we walked into a completely blacked out 12x12ft room. Better than any haunted house, the experience is literally breathtaking.  It is hard to describe the \"feeling\" but the design of the project is quite simple.  Individual LED lights drop down from wires which are suspended from the ceiling.  Black granite floors, mirrored walls and a mirror ceiling give the illusion that you are surrounded 360 degrees by tiny fireflies which go on to infinity.  BRILLIANT!   Mel went back in, twice.  I will be taking my sister and niece when they visit in May, solely for this fantastic exhibit.   I cannot wait to experience the PHX Art Museum again!"}
{"text":"I love going to different museums when I visit different cities. Phoenix art museum was one of the unique museums I've been to. It's got contemporary, classic, modern, and everything in between. I did a tour which was very helpful and informative. There was a special exhibition which was like different dress created by a designer. It was pretty interesting. They also have a student discount where you can get a discount. If you are a student (show your ID) and want to check out special exhibition, the cost was $18. My favorite was 2nd floor where it has a lot of different modern paintings and miniature arts. I definitely recommend this place when you are in downtown Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Saw that the Phoenix Art Museum is open late on Wednesdays, so I swung by a few weeks ago after a conference. What I didn't realize is that admission is also free on Wednesdays from 3:00-9:00 pm. Pleasant surprise!  I did pay the special discounted rate of $5 to see the current \"Lifelike\" exhibition. I really enjoyed it - fun play on the eyes and mind to see artwork that so authentically mimics everyday objects. Only wish the exhibition was larger.  This museum is way bigger than I expected and I did not make my way to all of the exhibitions. Two of my favorites are the Asian and Contemporary collections.  Helpful staff and I encountered a very friendly docent who recommended one of her favorite exhibits in \"Lifelike.\""}
{"text":"Ohhmygosh, I loved it here. The museum is just the right size to get through everything and not be tired out and also to not be bored too quickly. I think the curators have done an excellent job of selecting and organizing these works of art.  Personally speaking, I'm really glad the contemporary art isn't too out there and is actually relateable. When my parents come to visit, I shall take them here. Overall, a good place to recommend for any visitors."}
{"text":"Whoa. Like whoa.  I remember when this place was exasperatedly termed the \"Phoenix Art Mausoleum,\" and it was a moniker that wasn't totally inaccurate: There were a few treasures (like the Asian Art collection), but it was renowned for its overall schlockiness (oh God, so many awful cowboy paintings), poor means of display, and general half-assedness. A couple times a year it might get a traveling exhibition of limited note. Especially for a venue bathing in the RoRo vibes, it was often a disappointment. The teeny tiny ASU Art Museum was a far better place to see art--especially contemporary art--and see it displayed well.  And then... Things Changed. The museum's long-term director retired, a new one was hired, and this year we're finally seeing the best fruits of that shakeup. Lately it's been a non-stop calendar of fresh art and great events, things are hung with care and curated in interesting ways that make a modicum of sense, and exhibits are doing a far better job of engaging \"non-art people.\"  Perhaps most exciting of all, though, is that the museum has stepped back from its previous trend of putting large distances between viewers and the art: Displays of many things have been redesigned to let you get a hair's breadth from the pieces while still protecting them. Obnoxiously reflective and distorting encasements have been entirely removed from others. Before it was grandma's house with plastic slipcovers and doilies on everything; now it's an art museum.  If you've never been, go. If you've previously gone and hated it, go. If you went last week, go. Go, go, go, and support the museum's transformation into a beautiful butterfly."}
{"text":"Ralph Rucci. Phillip Curtis. Rickie Gonzales. Yes. Rickie and I had a late afternoon stroll through PAM. Admittedly my patience limit for museums is much like movies, dinner and employee meetings. NO LONGER THAN TWO HOURS!!! And our visit today was just that.  Ralph Rucci: Relatively new designer launched into super fame by way of Paris Fashion Week and two noteworthy fashion critics. Brilliant. On every level. A fantastic exhibit.  Phillip Curtis: Widely influenced by Mr. Gogh (you may know him by Vincent Van...), Curtis' work is laid out, revealing his struggle with colors while painting his amazing segue into more complex strokes.   Rickie Gonzales: My talented, driven and adorable bf....wide eyed and reeling from the art erupting around him on walls, floors and out of doors. What a lovely afternoon spent with an artist, absorbing art in a museum I had minimal expectations from. I would like to dress up the security team a bit from wrinkly, stale, beige polo shirts to black suits perhaps. The gift shop staff, while friendly, could certainly speed up the service a bit.  But my love for the Getty, the Walker, the Guggenheim and Met in NYC is open to a friendship with our PAM."}
{"text":"Not a good time to come to this museum .... Vast gallery space is closed off .... And the Sumarai collection is worth $5 because it was not my cup of tea.... However, what was notable is the \"Borders Crossing\"  exhibit .... Short attention ( indeed insulting)  is given to the largest ethnic group in this show.... It's on the lower level ( basement!!!) and to my horror!!!!! One of Mexico's ( if not the greatest) formidable abstract artist Rufino Tumayo is placed in the stairwell !!!!!  Que Pasa?!!!?!??   As ... (I hate to quote the man ... )Trump would  space \"muy malo.\""}
{"text":"Another placeholder so my pictures link. I'll update with details later, but the 4 star rating holds true."}
{"text":"The exhibits were pretty cool, especially the special exhibit on Antonio Berni and the fictional characters that he created named Juanito and Ramona. Overall the museum has interesting exhibits, and the staff and volunteers are nice and helpful."}
{"text":"I was so impressed with this museum. I've been talking about it nonstop and it seems the only people not favoring it are comparing it to the MOMA, National Gallery and the like. That's like when my ex mother in law didn't like Fazoli's because it wasn't authentic Italian food. We're not New York (or DC or any place like that) but for Phoenix, this museum is impressive. Lot's of big artists and my sweet pea and I are big fans of the firefly room, a hi-lite for any four year old."}
{"text":"This was a very good experience!  Had lots of time to look around all the interesting art around. My favorite is probably the dark matter sculpture....you just get lost in the details. It will take you a good 2-3 hours to go through."}
{"text":"if you haven't been, you must find the time to go as soon as you can. this is the coolest place! my husband and i went for the first time last year after living here for almost 9 years! what a shame...we really should have gone much sooner. since that first visit we've taken guests from out of town here almost every time. the architecture is beautiful and the artwork is breathtaking. it's such a nice way to spend a saturday morning. visiting this museum is definitely on the list as one of my favorite things to do."}
{"text":"The BF and I went to PAM this past week and I must say it wasn't their best showing. I have gone for special exhibits in the past and it has been great, but they were between exhibits so a lot of the museum was out of commission. The older paintings were very cool, they even have a Monet. The majority of the museum is modern art, which I personally am not a fan of. The 'art' reminded me of stuff you see at first Friday....it was not so impressive. I would go back if there was a special touring exhibit to see, but as it is, I wouldn't visit again."}
{"text":"Very impressed, first time there and they had some extraordinary Art especially the Dancing Swarm of Fireflies by Yayoi Kusama ... that was worth the price of entry alone. Nice to have Arcadia Farms there too."}
{"text":"Nice museum. It had Yayoi Kusama's fireflies / infinity Room with no lines and stay as long as you want, whereas at the Broad in LA it is a 45 secs view and by appointment only.  Loads of other stuff to see too."}
{"text":"I came here last year to check out their video game exhibit.  2013, it was a summer event and they had different things going on daily.  It was definitely an experience and it's great to see downtown changing it up a bit (for the better I think).  When I went to the museum it was great they had the exhibits and  their daily art and most of it was beautiful.   It's funny because the building looks small on the outside but once we got in there it was tall and huge.  I don't recommend high heels for you will be walking quite a bit.   On that day they happen to be having a gamer convention, showing all the new and old systems and schools, and contests.  It was pretty neat.   I would definitely go back for another event or maybe to relax and check it out for the weekend."}
{"text":"I thought this was an OK museum, the thing that bothered me the most was the workers there were constantly in our faces and watching us as if we were suspicious individuals. I hated being followed around like I was in a shopping store, something I experience often with my complexion. Annoying employees made it hard for me to enjoy the museum."}
{"text":"I love this museum.  So much so, that I became a member.  They have a great variety of work, the dosiers are very knowledgeable, and they constantly put on amazing exhibits.  Of course the Phoenix Art Museum pales in comparison to Chicago or New York, but very few museum can exceed those two cities anyway.  If you are looking for something to do and feel like learning something or looking at something beautiful, you should check this place out. It is worth it."}
{"text":"I had no idea that a city such as Phoenix would have such a world class art museum. Ignorance on my part and I was glad to have it brushed away by the culture in this lovely and well organized museum.  $10 for a visitor and I was able to get nose-to-art with a Picasso, Pissaro, Money and several O'Keeffe's. There is a big focus on art of the Southwest and of Mexico but there are lots of other fantastic pieces here. Some ancient stuff (a 4000 year old vase) and some more modern stuff (the Cruzieros display) are a lovely mix of new and old. I particularly enjoyed the gallery of Stallings photographs that followed the construction of the bridge at Hoover Dam. (I've added that to my bookmarks, btw.)  The Great Hall seems like an excellent place to have a gathering and the sculpture garden was also quite lovely (though it was surprisingly cold outside today).  Parking is easy and the museum has a free map that helps you find your way around the galleries. The only thing that I felt was missing was an audio guide. I really like to have some help with interpreting the art and understanding what I'm enjoying."}
{"text":"Wonderful works of art. An easy to explore layout. Family friendly or perfect place for an afternoon for two."}
{"text":"This museum participates in the Bank of America Museums on Us program. On select weekends, Bank of America customers get free admission to the museum. I was delightfully surprised the last time I dropped by and admission ended up free for me and my boyfriend.    Info at: http://museums.bankofamerica.com/  On a more relevant note, this museum is awesome. Really great contemporary art collection. This museum has a photograph by Vic Muniz, from his project he did in collaboration with workers at one of the world's largest landfills in Brazil. This project was the topic of  Wasteland, an AMAZING documentary that was nominated for an Oscar. I thoroughly enjoyed seeing the photograph at the PAM after watching the documentary. Good times.  PS: The cafe on site is not very good. They don't even have an espresso machine. If need be, I would recommend getting coffee beforehand or afterwards."}
{"text":"Ok, so I had written a review of our Yelp birthday party, but not of the museum itself. Just got back from the \"Selected Shorts\" exhibit:  short films.  After having lunch in Arcadia Farms, a group of 12 of us headed to the film festival (No Festival Required).  Seven shorts, all very different.  And the exhibit was FREE!!!  We didn't even have to pay to get into the museum, since we were having lunch.   Entering the theater was really cool!  Stadium seating, which I hadn't expected.  When you're a shorty like me, stadium seating is a must unless you want to deal with a crink in yer neck.  There was a stage with the screen above it, so even the people in front would have a good view without said crink.  No popcorn, but the seats were comfy.  Staff was really friendly and it started and ended when they said it would!  *gasp* Definitely going to be back to the museum and most definitely going to catch screenings in the theater."}
{"text":"I am always impressed by this art museum. They have amazing exhibits, wonderful touring exhibitions, and an awesome contemporary and modern art collection.   I love the atmosphere of this museum. The layout of the museum is fantastic and it's very fun to walk around. I like how they give plenty of space between each painting so that you can stop at look at a piece and you're not in someone else's way. Also, the staff at this museum is very friendly and helpful which you do not find at every art museum. They're willing to answer silly questions and they know alot about each of the exhibits which is awesome.  Some of my favorite pieces were: Frida Kahlo's The Suicide of Dorothy Hale The Tatiana Sorokko exhibit with beautiful dresses and a photo collage And some of the larger installations in the contemporary art collection  Also, Wednesdays after 3, the Phoenix Art Museum is free!"}
{"text":"I love the Phoenix Art Museum, so much so that I'm actually a member.  Everyone is so helpful and usually very nice about everything and I love the fact that they have free times so anyone can go enjoy the art they have there."}
{"text":"re: my return visit March 11 to view another fashion gallery...  They had another free Discount Tire weekend, with the theme \"innovate\".  I visited to view the Dutch-born Iris Van Terpen 3-D fashion display. While I enjoyed my viewing of her avant-garde industrial-style clothes, I was, unfortunately, seeing the museum workers/volunteers continually harassing the visitors over the littlest of things- running the gamut of accidental camera flash to how one wore (even a small) backpack. My example: As I was concentrating on my viewing and taking photographs, a small Asian girl accosted me and disrupting my concentration and mentioned something about how I was wearing my little purse backpack. I am hearing-impaired and wasn't sure whether she was telling me about the lady's backpack in front of me or my own. When I got a hint that she was referencing mine, I was puzzled like what about my backpack?? I had to unfortunately reveal my privacy- along with her wasting 5 precious minutes of my viewing time, by telling her I had scoliosis and had to wear my backpack a certain way as not to exacerbate. A lady standing next to me overheard and sternly reiterated to the dumb Asian that I was wearing my backpack due to my medical condition(!), and Asian girl backed away. I suspect that she accosted me because I appeared to be a lone visitor and when that lady standing by me spoke up, it hinted that I was not alone; thus, why she backed away. Another incident was that freak punk poseur with that horrid nostril ring of a hipster worker or volunteer standing at the gallery where the (bigger) Iris display was at. I asked him if it was the right Iris gallery that was included in the freebie weekend, and he had no clue and firmly said something like one had to pay $5 to even glance in or take a photograph. I had to have another worker to page the museum manager (Tammy) to let her know how I was treated (by Asian worker and punk poseur) or even witnessed how others were treated.  Originally, I was inside the gift shop already when I asked a guy (the one with a huge cyst next to his nose) to page the manager, but he had no idea how to do it so I had to walk back out and flag a nearby worker/volunteer to to do it. She was apologetic that some backpack or disability rule, along with the Iris gallery free/paid admission was omitted from the museum website. I even mentioned to her about that punk poseur's nostril earring not being appropriate in a conservative museum setting. She went ahead and gave me a free ticket to make up for everything. They let kids run away wild/unsupervised and that aging punk poseur show up for work with that ghastly earring (that looked terrible on him); yet, make a fuss over somebody's flash or backpack style?? It's not like somebody's touching the displays or puking on the floor or knocking displays over. So retarded, life is short! A forewarning: If you do go, please bring somebody with you or bring a bodyguard. Do NOT go alone- especially if you have a disability. They are very discriminating and very ignorant when it comes to disabilities. Shame on you! What goes around, comes around.... Due to what I both experienced or witnessed, I will not be back or donate to this museum. The museum closes at 5 on Sundays and I arrived around 3 knowing all I needed was a couple hours to capture what I showed up for. Because of the backpack incident and idiot workers/volunteers who knew nothing or how to answer about the Iris gallery mix-up (why the 2 separate galleries was never known or explained [eye-roll]), I had to hurry and catch up and was able to be done by 5. So much for a nice, relaxing (too-warm-out) day(!) I have seen enough fashion, being there-done that. There are other much more relaxing museums who appreciate your business. This museum relies on philanthropists (looking for tax breaks) and donations to survive... Down to 1 star + plus a bonus to the manager for rectifying.  by Karim Alvizo @ Facebook 12-29-17:  \"I live at Cityscape Residences in Downtown Phoenix and i visited your store right around the corner on central and washington. I was very excited to go since we just moved here from another state. However, the two workers there were rude and had an attitude that made me and my family to not want to go back. When we first walked in we were the first ones to say hello and the guy with long hair looked at us and said nothing in return. He also looked at us with disgust. The girl made a rude comment when my aunt put a crown of flowers on her head and i even turned around to see your employee and i was going to say something but chose not to. I believe the power of social media is much stronger than a personal confrontation. Its dissapointing to know we live right next door to a store that treats visitors in such manner. We were considering purchasing your annual membership but after this experience i am afraid your care for visitors is not of the quality we seek...\""}
{"text":"Art. Everywhere. Even in the architecture. That's what I like about the Phoenix Art Museum. From fashion to photography to sculpture and the revolving door of special exhibits, this museum has an appeal. Sure, you may not encounter the rarest of paintings, but you can come face-to-face with a Monet, O'Keeffe or Warhol. You can step nose-to-nose with an Ansel Adams photograph. You can get inches away from a slurp and slap of oil onto canvas, then slowly back away until the entire image comes into view. To me, that's the beauty of it, along with your own interpretation. Some pieces draw you in while others are, to you, more boring than spilled soy sauce (sart = soy as art).   General Admission is $10. If you have a KAET Passport, you can get a two-for-one. Even better, it costs nothing on Tuesday evenings... AND they are now open FREE for First Fridays, from 6 to 10 p.m. So, there's no excuses to not check out the Phoenix Art Museum on a semi-regular basis. Or, if you like it alot, you can even try to volunteer there.   I'd say there's something about an art museum that is relaxing, almost like a slow, tender lull into dreams. Yet, beneath those dreams are quaking moments of creativity.   Conclusion: Phoenix Art Museum is a terrific way to spend a couple hours."}
{"text":"Visited the Andy Warhol exhibit for birthday treat which was spoiled by overaggressive young woman who said I was carrying an IPhone and photos were not allowed. I was not taking photos and did not intend to as I had read the signs forbidding it.  She then started following me around and when I stopped to look into a glass topped case told me to stop leaning on it as I would break the glass and spoil the artifacts.. Unbelievable -  I have visited many museums, in London, New York, Paris and even Phoenix several times and never had this happen. A party of  noisy kids came through and I saw one touch an exhibit and guess what nada, nothing. Way to encourage attendance!"}
{"text":"This was, unfortunately, a disappointment.  I think the key to art museums is that they don't have to have super famous works of art, but they should carry pieces that have significance. I realize this can be very subjective, but I've found amazing experiences and hidden gems in places like Kansas City and St. Louis. I was surprised by the Phoenix Art Museum.  The price is a bit high for admission, but I really like that they allow you to apply your funds for one visit to a membership if you'd like. It's big, clean, and well staffed, but parking can be an issue.  The pieces of work... hm. I think part of the issue is that Arizona is a relatively new state, and the art museum is just over 50 years old. My impression is that this art museum has not had the time to collect varied, interesting pieces to exhibit. I did also find the Asian art section small and disappointing.  That being said, I thought the Phillip C. Curtis exhibit was wonderful. He was a local artist from Arizona and his work is really interesting, especially the commentary on social class in Arizona and the town of Jerome. I think I spent most of my time looking at his work. This is definitely the highlight of the museum.  I really hope with more time that the Phoenix Art Museum will grow, but as of now, I think one visit was enough for me."}
{"text":"I'm just going to come right out and say it: I don't get a lot of \"art\".  But I also know that if you don't use your brain (the lump of fat three feet above your ass) regularly, it'll atrophy.  Plus, if you're a student in the Maricopa Community College Syatem, you get in for free.  And it's inside, so it's something to do when the mercury starts climbing into the triple digits.  And like so many other things in Phoenix, it's accessible.  Light rail is right there.  Otherwise, parking is a breeze.  So, expand your horizons and go check it out.  You may not \"get\" a lot of it, you may \"like\" even less, but I think you'll find something that strikes you that you weren't expecting, and that's kind of the point.  It was with some trepidation I darkened the door of the Phoenix Art Museum with a friend of mine.  Little did I know that we'd actually run out of time, and would end up leaving before seeing everything.  Sure, there was plenty of the modern \"art\" that I expected, mocked, and asked predictably \"how is this 'art'?\" derisively, with a hint of sarcasm, while my much more cultured friend just rolled her eyes and shook her head.  Hey, what did you expect, taking me to an art museum?  But I found a lot that- even if I didn't love it, I was able to marvel at the time and effort- the craftsmanship that went into a lot of the collection.  And sometimes, at least for me, you have to respect the amount of detail, time, and care put into getting every last detail just so.  If you ask me, like some kind of cultural Mad Lib, \"Do you see the __________ of __________ that the artist intended to reflect in his piece by including __________, __________, and __________, and by choosing to use __________ as his media?  Do you feel the emotions of __________ and/or __________ as the artist intended?\" I may just look at you like you have an extra hole in your head, but that doesn't mean I don't like it.  And any art museum that can host an exhibition called \"Curves of Steel\" about automotive design and the art therein has my vote (and my patronage).  Too bad I missed it.  By 5 years.  But here's to hoping they commission another exhibit about the automobile as rolling sculpture- I'll be there.  And while I'm there, I'll take another look around, and see if I can see what Georgia O'Keeffe was *really* painting when she painted all those flowers (they were women, right?)."}
{"text":"It's a nice musuem but the hours are just terrible.  Closing at 5PM on a Friday/Saturday is ridiculous. People work!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went to the museum on family free day and had an amazing time. The staff was very friendly and took time explaining cool features of specific work to us however the absolute best part of the museum is the Firefly Room! After the staff recommended we try it out we couldn't stop going through! Overall a really fun day!"}
{"text":"My family and I live in the SF Bay Area. We've visited the museum several times. Liked it so much we became members. It's a wonderful place.  Very enjoyable even for kids ages 8 and up.  They also do a wonderful job with the special exhibits. Our whole family greatly enjoyed the Hollywood costumes exhibit in 2014. Additionally, we all enjoy the café and sitting out on the patio very much."}
{"text":"This museum was A-OK. Nothing too crazy, wasn't entertained. Wasn't bad. Cool."}
{"text":"I'm a proud member of the Phoenix Art Museum.   People ask me all the time why I'm still a member now that I live in New York.  \"I mean, what does the Phoenix Art Museum have that you don't in NYC?\"  Great question, nameless skeptic!  The Phoenix Art Museum is excellent for picnics - they'll let you lay out a blanket and hang out in the sculpture garden, munching Pane Bianco and reading McSweeney's books.  Their area-code exhibition was totally awesome.  I loved getting to see art by local artists about the area I grew up in, and the emphasis on Mexican-influenced art was refreshing.  But the best part of the Phoenix Art Museum is the installation, \"You Who Are Getting Obliterated in the Dancing Swarm of Fireflies.\"  I won't say too much, but this is truly one of the most phenomenal things I have ever experienced.  I am obsessed with this exhibit, and every time I'm in Phoenix, I make a concerted effort to experience it at least once.  You should, too.  You can't possibly regret it."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to go to the Phoenix Art Museum for a long time now.  I just kept showing up on days they were closed or days when they didn't open until much later than I got there!    They're closed on Mondays and Tuesdays and their hours are longer on Wednesdays.  Also, on Wednesdays, entry is free for everyone from 3P-9P; they just ask for a donation.  Kids under 6 are always free!  Luckily, I was able to make it in today with my daughter.    There is a current Paper exhibit that is pretty cool.  There is a papier mache sculpture exhibit by a Tucson artist that is veryyyyyy spooky.  There are dresses made from newspaper and the yellow pages.  There are lithographs of pop art you may recognize.    I liked that the museum houses a good balance of fine art and modern art.  I am not too keen on pop art, but DD is.  Her favorite piece in the whole museum was \"The Artist who Swallowed the World,\" by Erwin Wurm.  She couldn't stop talking about it and remembered it by name.  She made sure to ask me what each piece was named, though sometimes she would dart to the next piece before hearing the answer.  My favorites were mostly in the fine art area.  I especially loved looking at all the old portraits.  Sometimes I felt as if they were alive.  If only the movie Night at The Museum was nonfiction!  But, seriously, the old masters really had a gift for painting their subject's gaze.  Fascinating!  I also loved seeing the old bathing suits from the 20s and 50s and the old Naval uniforms.  I would LOVE to have a vintage bathing suit.  In fact, I might scour Etsy for one now!  We both loved the museum, even though I would have preferred to spend more time there.  DD was seeking quantity over quality today.  Perhaps I will get the chance to meander here another time with another adult!"}
{"text":"I went to the Phoenix Art Museum with my friend James a couple of years back. I checked out the tickets (cultural passes) from the Mesa Public Library so my friend and I were able to get in free. I love that the Phoenix Art Museum offers this perk to people who live in the Valley!  I'm not sure whether or not they are still listed as a place you can visit for free at the Phoenix Public Library or Mesa Public Library, but if they have a Cultural Pass for it, I would definitely check it out!  My friend and I went when there was an exhibit focusing on Asian arts. There were all sorts of exhibits from various parts of Asia but a lot of the focus was on pieces from China, South Korea, and Japan.  They had the regular museum pieces too (like the hanging metal sculptures and so on) so it was fun to check those out as well. There was a neat exhibit where you could walk into this dark room which had a bunch of lights and it was like you were walking through the galaxy. It was really cool!  I was surprised at how large the museum was. There is a lot of stuff to take in and enjoy. There are some neat sculptures outside of the museum too which I took some time to look at before entering the building and also when I left.  I definitely recommend checking out this museum if you get the chance. They always have a lot of interesting things on display and there are a lot of exhibits to view."}
