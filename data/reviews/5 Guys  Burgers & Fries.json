{"text":"Great burgers and fries! All the toppings you could ask for!
Staff is always very friendly, food is always fresh! The only downside is its a bit pricey for burgers, but the quality makes up for it!
Unless you are a glutton for punishment, or have a family of 4 to feed stick with the regular size fries!"}
