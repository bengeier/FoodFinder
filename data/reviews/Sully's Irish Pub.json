{"text":"Stopped in during the Ice Fest. They were very busy.

The food wasn't really anything to write home about and the service was very sub par. Our server lacked personality and seemed like he really didn't want to be there.

Appetizer of mozzarella sticks came out after our entrees of 2 wraps, grilled salmon and a kids hot dog. The kids hot dog came about 5 minutes after the rest. Don't most kids meals come out first with the appetizer? 

Wouldn't suggest it to anyone. I understand there may have been more traffic than normal but nothing made me feel like I wanted to return to eat."}
{"text":"The service at Sully's is second to none! Jackie, Drya, and Barb make sure you're taken care of and they are fun and personable! I'm looking forward to joining Sully's on St. Patty's Day!"}
{"text":"Had a great dinner. My husband and I both had the pork barbecue sandwich. It was messy, but so delicious. We were very pleased with the meal. My daughter had the bacon cheeseburger. She did not enjoy the spices they put in the handmade burger, but my husband and I both tried it and loved it. 

Our server was so friendly and very accommodating. We were very happy with this restaurant during our trip."}
{"text":"Always heard nice things of Sully's, never been.  Wife and I had a free afternoon without the kids so we went to check it out for ourselves.  Sure am glad we did.  

Ordered the Sully fries with kraut and cheese on them.  They come with a mayo horshradish sauce that you use as a dip.  Trust me,you'll want 2..  Amazing.

I ordered the fish sandwich, comes on a keiser roll, tomato onion, lettuce and tarter sauce.  I don't know if our was the beer batter or the tarter that made this sandwich but the combo of them both made it a great choice!  Highly recommended.

My wife ordered the pulled chicken sandwich.  A good sandwich but could have used a bit more of their home made bbq to sauce it up a bit.

Home made chips for or side were tasty and a good option since we already stuffed ourselves on the fries.  

Wait staff were friendly and attentive.  Going to go back for some live music some Friday evening soon.  Should be fun."}
{"text":"Sully's has a great atmosphere and delicious food. My husband and I go here often. I have ordere various things and so has he. We have never been disappointed. Some of our favorites is the Shepard's pie and their rueben. Defientely recommend going their for dinner and drinks."}
{"text":"Sullys is our most favorite pub! It didn't start out that way tho, our first impression of Sullys was a server (no longer there) who was rude and abrasive.....   but we took our concerns to another server (Jackie)who was understanding and even sat down with us and listened and made sure we were taken care of. She is always pleasant and greets us with a smile. She always tells us about the new drafts that they have on tap and any specials. The ruben is  the best I have ever eaten. All there food is a huge step above what you would expect from a bar. Tara is always helpful with any questions as to what to try for something new to drink or eat. She always greets us when we enter and makes us feel welcome.This is a real gem in Medina! Love the irish tunes! It feels like your stopping in a pub in Ireland a having a pint with friends!"}
{"text":"We were in here this past Saturday.  Love the atmosphere and the food is OK, I agree with others when they say it's not as good as in the past.  Once thing I did notice was how all the servers and two other women who, I guess worked there just hung at the end of the bar, talking and checking their cell phones.  Another beer would have been nice and some extra napkins but hey, it's your tip.  Not sure if we really need to go back and that is to bad, it was once a great place but is slipping."}
{"text":"It is what it is, an Irish Pub.  The atmosphere is great, staff is always friendly, and the service is typically quick.  There is a decent selection for food and drink on the menu.  On certain nights they have live music, so it can get pretty crowded and noisy, but then again, that should be expected.  We've always enjoyed our food and drink, as well as the live music."}
{"text":"Rueben rolls!!!! The Irish American food is delicious and did I mention the Reuben rolls? My favorite! The atmosphere is traditional Irish pub with large booths and tables to fit the enormous plates of food served. Fish fry is my next favorite. It's a little pricey but well worth every penny."}
{"text":"I love a good Irish pub, and was sorely disappointed by Sully's. First of all, $6 for a pint of Harp's? In Medina? That's more than I pay for comparable beer in LA or NY. I also found the fish and chips -- classic pub food -- to be weak. The fish was merely okay -- breaded, not battered -- and the fries weren't fresh. Worst of all was the side vegetable: over-steamed, limp, watery brocolli with a fake cheese sauce on top. My husband didn't fare much better with the \"sheperd's pie\", which turned out to be stew with a scoop of mashed potatoes on top. No! Sheperd's pie is supposed to have a layer of mashed potatoes on top, and the whole thing should be baked so that the potatoes are browned on top."}
{"text":"Great local neighborhood bar with fantastic food.  The beer selections are great and the prices are reasonable.  Try the Turkey Rachel sandwich with homemade chips.  Or the Irish Stew.  Weekend Irish Bands are great fun as well"}
{"text":"The food is very good most of the time, however the wait staff has a lot to be desired, (attitude) Waitress told us the special for the evening was perch! So I ordered it then they delivered a meatball sub to the table, rather then returning it, I decided to try it, will not be ordering the sub again,"}
{"text":"Food hasn't been overwhelmingly good & service has been suspect at times. Some items seem like they might be frozen & not fresh. Back room seems like separate world from main dining area."}
{"text":"Had the corned beef sandwich. Delicious. Love the pub. Good beer selections.Probably best tasting corned beef I've had since my favorite place \"Goodmans\" in Old Brooklyn closed. Nice job Sully's!"}
{"text":"Their corned beef is really good but the haddock sandwich was kinda soggy. Service was good and they are just off the square so it's close to other things. Good place for something different than a pizza or burger. Get the homemade chips!"}
{"text":"A friend and I met up here on a Tuesday evening, and I was impressed with this place.  It has a good, easy-going atmosphere, and the irish music is at a perfect level - just loud enough to enjoy but low enough to carry on conversation.  

Recommended drink: irish mule.
Recommended burger: Angry Leprechaun.
Recommended server: Katie, because she was attentive, very knowledgeable about menu items, and is very cute!  :) 

My friend ordered the corned beef sandwich, and said it was awesome.
I gladly recommend this place to others, and will be back soon."}
{"text":"Good food, cold beer, smiling faces"}
{"text":"Went back and the waitress and food were wonderful.  The guinness battered haddock was delicious.  My friend said her coleslaw tasted fishy, but I didn't eat mine cause I remembered I didn't like their slaw to begin with.  My mother had the soup and she enjoyed it, I thought it was bland.  The cake for two was wonderful.  My friend did not like the frosting on it or on the peanut butter cake, but overall she loved her cake (it was the same frosting).  I had the bailey's cheesecake, I loved it.  The waitress was friendly and personable."}
{"text":"Sully's is one of the best places to go for lunch or an early dinner during the day you would find it less crowded not busy. 

Plenty of seating, friendly helpful staff. I would for sure recommend and return to this location. Helpful tip please avoid this place on crowded night or saint Patrick day very crowded and not easy to get a table. See the staff for details"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, good food and service. Menu is diverse with many good offerings.  We would definitely go back here."}
{"text":"Love their food! Best Irish restaurant around, hands down! Also totally a place you can take your kids. Just not on St. Pats. You have to remember they are an Irish bar on St. Pats... :) common sense should apply :)"}
{"text":"my mom and aunts seem to like this place and i was always intrigued. of course, my aunts also like the browns and they've been a hopeless cause since i was 11 years old. 

the good:
the restaurant looks nice
pretzel bites
service was ok

everything else was completely \"meh\". why do restaurants put a long filet of fried fish onto a round hamburger bun? the sandwich tasted ok but was a complete mess. it fell apart in my hands, turned into a lump of mush and was near impossible to even pick up by stabbing with a fork. also, battered fries, ugh.i should have stuck with the chips that come with the sandwich. 

Danielle said her BBQ pork sandwich was also just barely ok.

$45 (after tip)  for 2 sandwiches, sodas and an appetizer is way too expensive.

so, i've got that out of the way. i should have had a shot or two. they were priced pretty good at $3 dollars."}
{"text":"Went with a group of four. All but myself got what we ordered after waiting nearly 30 minutes to get our food. Ordered the chicken pot pie. They brought out sheppard's pie. When it came out I immediately knew it was wrong. I asked the person who brought it if it was the chicken pot pie and she says, \"yes it is.\" Really? Told the server and shes said, \"sorry, all i heard was pie.\" Well you offer more than one dish with pie in the name. Maybe you should have me clarify. She says, \"you can keep the sheppard's pie and I will get you the pot pie but i will warn you that it takes a long time to make.\" I simply got it go. They didn't charge for it. Secondly, we were never asked if we wanted additional beverages after the first round came out. Maybe not a bad restaurant, just a discombobulated waitress. The consensus of the party was that the food was just mediocre and that we'd likely not go back."}
{"text":"For an Irish pub, this place has some great food offerings such as steamed mussels and some wonderful wings. I was surprised by the level of quality put into these culinary creations. They have a large selection of brews on tap that are often rotated with seasonal offerings. Many of NE Ohio's better Irish themed bands have played here at one time or another which makes this a fun place to be on any given weekend."}
{"text":"Sullys is a warm and wonderful family place.  Their corned beef makes my Irish heart sing.  The service and atmosphere represents everything good about Irish hospitality.  Definitely worth a visit...,,again, and again, and again, and again.  You will never tire of it!!"}
{"text":"Good food in a nice atmosphere. The Guinness cheese dip is out of this world. I wish there were more vegetarian options, but I do enjoy eating here every time I'm in Medina."}
{"text":"great food.  service was spotty when sitting out on the patio.. waited 15 minutes until i decided to go in and place my order. this was 4th of july.. it wasnt packed but wasnt empty..  our waitress actually waited on people on the patio after i got there...  will be going back for the food though it was great!"}
{"text":"Used to be very good food - atmosphere still good but food has been slipping the past few years even as prices increase. Mussels were cold when brought out, many cracked shells and unopened bivalves. Gritty. Onion soup was good and beer choices are still great so go to it for a bar but skip for meal."}
{"text":"Nice place and a very warm friendly atmosphere. The wine and food selections were amazing. The staff was very friendly and let us try some mixed drinks which were amazing. Live music most definately compliments this place on fridays and saturdays. Special thanks to Neil for making it a very nice experience. Would definately come back. Highly recommend this place. 
Thx 
DR MD"}
{"text":"Best Pretzel bites anywhere. Awesome Cheese Dip. We love the atmosphere and have never had a bad meal. My husband's favorite is the Meatloaf."}
{"text":"On Fridays husband & I like to go out for fish dinner. Sully's has not been as good as it used to be. They used to have awesome perch fish dinners & now they have lost the touch of cooking this fish decent anymore. I do not know if it was the oil they use or that they are using frozen fish instead of fresh or what but not worth going there anymore & spending our hard earned money on a meal that totally \"sucks\" Their clam chowder even isn't as good as it used to be either. Don't know why this place is so crowded their food isn't all that hot unless you enjoy that kind of food & don't care how the fish or soup tastes. This is not our favorite anymore either."}
{"text":"Hit or miss sometimes I get great customer service and my beer's are constantly being refilled sometimes it is a battle trying to get a refill! 

3 star's is A OK it doesn't mean its horrible!"}
{"text":"An Irish Pub in Medina, Ohio. Amazing! Very good food and service, music during the week and it seems like it has been there for years, and yet it is fairly recent.
Burgers are good. Mussels and clams are delish! I also love their crabcakes, which do tend to vary in amount of crab, but are most always good!!
Service is excellent and they serve hard cider! Not many places that do and they have a great selection."}
{"text":"This place has an amazing fish fry and awesome Reuben egg rolls!  The food is classic Irish deliciousness.  On the weekends they have live Irish music but get there early.....the seating fills up fast!!!!"}
{"text":"A Medina resident, we often spend time at Sully's.  Although careful to stick with sandwiches and burgers, which are usually safe, one of my all time favorites was the beef stew.  Generous portion, with big chunks of tender beef and potatoes with carrots in a thick rich gravy.  Hugely disappointed when I ordered yesterday and found  they now add peas, rutabaga and corn.  Corn in Irish beef stew !?  in fact there were more peas and corn than meat and potatoes.  What pieces of beef where in there were meager and only a few small pieces of potatoe.  The gravy was also pretty bland.  NEVER order this dish."}
{"text":"I was here the other week visiting friends in the area and we had an awesome time. We arrived earlier when it was pretty quiet and stayed into the night as the place got busier. I really liked that even when the performer came on the music wasn't deafening. I hate having to shout across a table and being drowned out by music. That definitely didn't happen here. The noise level was just right. 

Our server (Katie, I think?) was awesome and quick to bring refills even when it was busy. The food was alright and arrived fairly quickly.

If you're here, try Sully's Irish Red! It's strong and tasty."}
{"text":"Great place and great food! The only reason I give it 4 stars because for it being the most well known bar in the area, they have a small draft list and not too much variety. For the food I will return!"}
{"text":"Our first time here and we liked it.  My husband said the Guinness onion soup was one of the best he's had.  My husband had the The Angry Leprechaun burger, which is topped with pepperjack cheese, bacon, candied jalapenos and sriracha mayo. He gave it a thumbs up.  I had Rosie's Chicken Cordon Bleu Sandwich, which is chicken fingers topped off with ham, Swiss and honey mustard dressing, served on a hand crafted stout bun. I thoroughly enjoyed it.  No complaints on the food, at all.  The service from the kitchen was very slow, especially since the restaurant was not that busy.  The wait time for 2 sandwiches was terribly long.  Also, I noted that our server made a lot of wasted steps back and forth and back and forth, but never checked on us, offered to refill our beverages, or let us know the status of our food.  When the server finally did refill my beverage, he filled my glass with water, when I was drinking Sprite.  So, a little faster kitchen service and a more attentive (but not overbearing) server would warrant another one or two stars from us.  We will be back, as we enjoyed the food."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is fantastic.  The food is always hot and delicious.  I've spent many hours there, and I look forward to spending more.  Easily my favourite restaurant in the area."}
{"text":"Good place for a drink and meal after work. Love the laid back vibes and service is usually good. Food can be heavy but has consistently been tasty. They do rotate some seasonal beers here so it's a good place to stop in for a new brew or a tried and true regular on tap."}
{"text":"We ordered fried pickles, the potato leek soup and corned beef and cabbage.  The soup was good (it tasted a lot like clam chowder).  Everything was salty.  The cabbage seems like it is fried with onions and it is great.  I would pass on the fried pickles next time.

The bathrooms were not great but okay.  One of the staff yelled \"Dammit\" REALLY loud while we were there and we were all wondering if someone lost a finger in the kitchen or something (we were peeking in the window to the kitchen to see if something was wrong, but we didn't see anything).

Nobody refilled my iced tea, which was a disappointment and there are only two high chairs (not enough)!"}
{"text":"I can see the reasons for the poor service complaints.  I sat at the bar and we were the only ones there.  Although it wasn't that bad, everyone seemed to congregate at the other end of the bar and my service wasn't real good due to this.  The food was very good, and the prices were reasonable.  I will be back.  I don't know if the people in charge read these reviews or not, but they should.  HINT!!  Get a REAL open sign.  I walked up to the door and almost left because I thought you were closed.  I watched a party of 6 and 4 walk almost to the door then turn around and leave.  Clearly they thought you were closed too.  Plus put a complete correct list of the hours of operation on your door."}
{"text":"Full disclosure:  We just happened to show up at Sully's on the very night of Sully's 60th birthday.  They were decorating the tables, balloons hung from the tin ceiling, the place was packed, we waited about a half hour for a table.  We may have been the only people there who didn't personally know Sully.  (Nor did anyone introduce us, which most certainly would have happened in Ireland.  Or Italy, or any other European country.  Or most U.S. cities.  Or perhaps we stink.  Who knows?)

Drinks were on the expensive side, service was disjointed while still friendly, volume was on the bleeding-ear scale and food was cafeteria quality.  Fun bunch of drunks, though!  We waited nearly as long after dinner, just for the waitress to take our money.  Fun bunch of drunks, though, including the staff!

I'll go back for a re-review on a night that isn't quite so epic."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is nice and they often bring in acts that put on a good show. The grub is a small step up from your standard bar and grill. They have great bar tenders and everything that is something is on tap."}
{"text":"I love the food here, but it doesn't come cheap.  The live entertainment is good but a little loud.  This place gets crazy busy so be ready to wait, it's worth it though."}
{"text":"Well I went here again, just today actually and still a fan! I started off the night with a special Irish Red brewed just for Sully's and fried boxty taters and their Guinness cheese dip.  The beer was $4.75 for a pint and the appetizer like 6 bucks. Good food and value, I then ordered the shepherd's pie. HUGE, I could only take away half of the meal and I am no light eater.  It isn't overly complicated or complex food but that is Irish cuisine. If you see some crazy looking Irish dish, it probably isn't a genuine Irish meal. They have a great line up of live bands too, check them out!"}
{"text":"An in-the-know co-worker brought me here for lunch, and I must say I was pleased.  Open, bright space with ample booth and table seating.  Friendly, knowledgeable waitresses.  Signage showed some good beer specials and regular live music.

I tried the fish sandwich, which was beer battered haddock.  The fillet was large, thick, white and flaky.  Batter was well seasoned and crispy.  I would recommend this (and get it again myself).

My partner went with the Reuben, which looked lean and delicious.  He devoured it, so it must have also been good.

The menu looked great, and I wouldn't mind stopping back after work to have a beer and one of their tasty looking apps - Reuben egg rolls, mussels, fried pickles, Guiness cheese dip, etc, etc!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times. This past time I went I had the BBQ lovers burger. It was really good and pretty big. Had a side of fries. My father had the pulled pork sandwich. He said it was a generous portion and was good but could of used some more sauce. My mother had the chicken ranch wrap and mentioned it was a little salty but good. Service was great, fast, and efficient. We sat at a booth. Wonderful job ladies. Definitely be back again. Great selection of beers by the way."}
{"text":"I really like this place.  It is in downtown Medina and nicely decorated with large screen TVs.  You are not rushed - the server asked if we'd like our bill and said we could stay as long as we wanted.  The servings are huge and very good and authentic Irish pub food.  Great Irish music was being played - I think it was the Irish Rovers.  I had the haddock sandwich and it was huge and I took enough home for another meal.  The potato leek soup is to die for - excellent.  My husband had the lake perch special and he loved it.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"First off, why would Yelp say that Sully's is closed today? On St. Patricks Day? Come on. So, I've been to Sully's at least ten times but never written a review, I don't believe (it's been a while). On this occasion I didn't have any food, I was here to pick up my Irish dancing daughter who was arriving via party bus (is it bad that I made her drive me home because she has her temp license and I had too much to drink?). Any ways, the times I have had food here, the quality has always been good. Great sandwiches, Reuben's, appetizers, etc.  Also, the ambiance is always fun and the people nice.  Lastly - and I kid you not - Jack Black is one of the bartenders!"}
{"text":"This is a review based on a St. Patrick's Day weekend experience, so take it for what it's worth. The place was obviously packed considering the holiday. Took 2 hours to get a table but the waiting around was a lot of fun. Everyone was standing, waiting for a table and drinking. People were so incredibly friendly. The Irish band was great, the food and drink (primarily Guinness and Conway's Irish Ale for me) were good. The best part again was the fun loving crowd! For a tiny place in the heart of downtown Medina, I don't think you will find a much better place close by."}
{"text":"Stopped after trip to Castle Noel. Simple little pub went on Sunday evening so only about a dozen people dining when we arrived about 5:15.  Ordered the Reuben egg rolls, Guinness French onion Soup and potato leek soup.  The rolls were good and came out very quick do not think they were made in house but had good flavor were a little on the oily side. The Guinness French onion soup was good would not say it was out of the ordinary if you like French onion you won't be disappointed. The potato leek was a little shy on potatoes but good. For dinner we had the corn beef  and cabbage and the meatloaf. I liked the twist from the normal wedges of cabbage and boiled potatoes.  The cabbage was shredded with onions and slightly grilled the garlic potatoes were definitely home made and very generous portion of corned beef sliced thin with very little fat was delicious. The meatloaf was enormous, not lacking in portion size or flavor it was  was also accompanied by the same potatoes. If you are hungry the meatloaf is the way to go we ended taking half home.  Overall the service was quick our waiter was not overly friendly but did recommend the meatloaf so we're good. And the pub was very clean and neat. Oh and by the way they have a good beer selection and bar as any good pub should."}
{"text":"Every time I've been there the place is packed.  The food is great, and with huge portions.  The service is incredible and attentive.  My only gripe, and it appears I'm not alone, is that the live music is so loud, if you want to have a conversation you will need to request a table at the back of the establishment."}
{"text":"Excellent all-around experience! Our party of four sat at the bar for a couple of drinks before dinner. Bartender was very helpful and explained the beer selection. When it was time to eat, he continued serving us at our table. The food and service was excellent! Our dinners came out hot, on-time, and all at the same time. I had the Lake Erie perch. Breading was light and crispy and the fish was extremely fresh! This was our first visit, but we will definitely be returning!!"}
{"text":"Had the fish dinner it was nasty. The breading was way to heavy, almost as thick as having it squished between 2 pieces of fried white bread. Also, the breading just absorbed the grease and when they brought it out the grease just pooled on one piece. I tried to eat just the fish but it was not easy getting it away from the breading and to top it off they charge nearly $16 for this meal. I have had my share of fish and chips dinners and this was one of the worst. Do not get it, you will regret it. My wife got the burger and she said it was very good but the server said they were known for the fish and chips but I don't know how if they're charging that much for something that not edible."}
{"text":"Great burgers and ruben egg rolls.  Service and drinks are also good.  Thanks for being in Medina."}
{"text":"When the place  first opened it was very good.  The food was fresh and very tasty.  Every since those first visits the food and service has been on a downward slide.  My last visit featured a broken toothpick in my corned beef sandwich.  They didn't even comp the meal, they acted like it was my fault.  The owner walks around like he just swallowed a turd.  Avoid this place!"}
{"text":"I'm going to give 2 stars since it was a takeout order.  I ordered the classic Reuben and the Jameson bread pudding as a treat to celebrate my Marine Corps' birthday. Well, the sandwich had a tsp of dressing, no pickle, & semi stale house chips.  The only thing that will make me give it a second try is dining in and a pint of Mangers."}
{"text":"Good pub food and great Craic!  Only authentic Irish pub worth visiting south of Cleveland!  Great Trad music on weekends too!"}
{"text":"Having grown up in Medina my whole life I am glad there is finally a place I can spend time at that isn't a dive bar.  The people seem to always  be having fun when they are at Sully's.  They have a great selection of beers especially all of my favorite Irish beers like Guinness, Harp and others.  I enjoy the live music but the volume of the music can get kind of loud.  My favorite Irish band ever played there during the summer of 2009 and it was amazing!  My friend Kieron from County Kildare, Ireland came to visit Medina that same summer of 2009.  He used to own a pub in Naas in County Kildare.  He loved Sully's.  It is his favorite Irish pub in the United States."}
{"text":"Great Irish feel.  He actually gets really great Rebel music singers.  I would stay longer and have more pints for sure had I not have to drive back up to Clevo.  Great for a day drive.  Servers have been from good to aweful.  Depends on who ya get.  They do have daily/happy hr specials but on the last visit I actually had to bring them up on my phone and show her what they were.  Some people like to save a buck, ya know.."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch on a Tuesday. Lots of great choices.   GET THE REUBEN EGG ROLLS! they were scrumptious!!  Chicken cordon bleu sandwich was good. Good service and friendly waitresses."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Sully's what a great place! The atmosphere was great not extremely loud so you could enjoy conversation between your table. The food was very good. We got the sampler app and the Reuben both I recommend. Cold beer, great food and comfortable atmosphere I can say I'll be returning again soon."}
{"text":"They need to give up cooking and stick to beer.   I ordered crab cakes and the meal was greasy.  Also they need irish music not a dj giving away junk.  and can you ban little kids after 7 pm?"}
{"text":"Stopped in here a few weeks ago with my boss and his wife while here for a business trip. If I lived in Medina, I'd be here as often as I could. I love this place. The food was fantastic. We shared an app of Angry Muscles. BEST muscles I have ever had, hands down. Light cream sauce, bacon, jalapenos.... unbelievable flavor. Also, had some wings which were OK, and the Irish stew which was very good. Of course, some Irish beverages to wash everything down. Also, the night we were there, the muscles were 1/2 price as a special. Definitely get these, they're not too hot, don't let the jalapenos in them scare you away."}
{"text":"I do not go thru Medina often but I would stop here again but would not go out of my way .. French Onion soup was really good but I have had the same elsewhere closer to home .. gotta say the $7.99 soup & 1/2 sandwich lunch combo is a good deal (1 buck extra for the onion soup but it is a full serving) .. I had the 1/2 turkey Rachel .. good but not spectacular .. worth a repeat visit since I saw other things I would like to try but not so good that I would exactly rush back either"}
{"text":"I was in Medina last weekend for my best friend's wedding.  The night before, a bunch of us went to Sully's and it really captures the essence of the Akron area.  When we were walking in, there was a biker festival across the street and a bunch of gruff looking guys in a band singing the national anthem.  Classic!  

Once I walked in, I found more bikers and a sweet irish live band.  A decent sized bar with awesome Great Lakes Brew Co craft beers on tap, Sully's offers a comfortable spot with a VERY diverse group.  We saw everyone from kids in their early 20's to senior citizen couples all boozing it up.  What else do you expect in Akron?

The best part of the night was getting my tab.  I bought a round for the group earlier in the night.  For 14 drinks my tab was something like $55.  If I ever (and I don't expect to) return to Medina, I'll be spending another Friday night with friends at Sully's.  Awesome spot."}
{"text":"Food is good, entertainment is fun but usually to loud.   If you sit in the back so you can communicate with your friends, you no longer feel like you are at an Irish pub.   Patio addition has been a nice touch.  Staff has always been fabulous and fun."}
{"text":"Had a burger with side salad and Sully's own red ale.  All were pretty good but not great. What was great were the corned beef egg rolls!  Recommended.  My wife also had the similar corned beef sammich and said it was very good.  Sully's is pretty busy.  You have to seat yourself but I can't imagine how that will go when they are really busy."}
{"text":"Okay, I have very mixed feelings about Sully's.  I always seem to have a good time when I go there, but is it because of the pub or because of the company (also, I'm usually not paying).  

Drinks are pretty expensive.  A $6 beer is pretty steep.  It is definitely one of the more expensive bars that I have visited.

The food is decent.  It's nothing spectacular, but it does the job.  Again, probably more expensive than it needs to be.  

The building itself is extremely nice.  It used to be an old machine shop.  They did a great job renovating.  However, every time i have been in there it is deafeningly loud.  I have to yell across the table to speak to anyone.  There was a live band one night, and if there is one thing that I don't need, it is ear-splitting, mediocre folk music.

Sully's is a nice place to go, but is it really worth it?  I don't know..."}
{"text":"I was waffling between 3 and 4 stars, but ultimately, I would come back here. The menu is awesome and offers a lot of things I'd like to try. 

It gets pretty crowded in here. We stopped in on a Saturday night and was lucky to find 1 table open for the 2 of us. WE sat down and-- OUCH-- these are the most uncomfortable chairs I've ever sat in. I actually thought at one point I might be more comfortable standing up.
Food came and distracted me a little from awful chairs.

Our service was a little slow, but friendly and efficient. I mean, it was Saturday night. Lots of people sitting around drinking and not ordering food.  :-(

We started with the Reuben Egg Rolls. Life changing. These were so amazing. Filled with corned beef, cheese, sauerkraut and fried to golden perfection. Served with 1000 Island-- I honestly could have made a great meal out of the Appetizers.
the Mister ordered the Bacony Goodness Burger and it earned it's name. Lots of thick bacon, thick cheesy sauce and an expertly grilled burger patty. His only complaint was that it was finished too quickly.
I ordered the fish sandwich. I probably wouldn't order this again only because it was a mess. A delicious mess, but just really hard to eat. It was too large for the bun, so it fell apart the second I picked it up."}
{"text":"Food was fair but a bit expensive I thought. It's a decent neighborhood joint and I like the variety in the menu although I've only had a handful of things. Give it a try."}
{"text":"Sully's is a great little Irish pub in Medina. My fiance and I dined here on a Saturday afternoon in June after an event we had attended in Medina, but before we had another event to attend that evening. I don't know if there is parking lot at Sully's or how crowded it is, for we walked there that day (not a good choice, as it ended up pouring later! Oh well). We were on about a 2 hour time limit, and that was no problem at Sully's. The service was great and very fast! There was even a huge group of 10 or so at the table next to us but our service was still very good. All of the waitresses, not just our waitress, kept checking on us and making sure everything was great. My fiance had a couple of beers and I had one of the mixed drinks on special, it was very good but I forget what it was called. My fiance got the Guiness BBQ Chicken Sandwich, which he said was good, and I got the Chicken Wrap. It was delicious! I couldn't even eat all of it because it was so big, so I took half of it home. We had a good experience at Sully's and I would definitely go back. Prices are reasonable, too."}
{"text":"We sat 7 at a table for lunch.  Huge menu.  I ate a gigantic Chef's salad which was good, but they missed a big chunk of rotten lettuce. 
Some winners were the Reuben sandwich and pulled pork.  Fabulous onion rings and pretty decent fries.  They pour a glorious Guinness pint and free refills on soft drinks.  
Nice, prompt service.
Many Pokemon hunters enjoy this gym spot."}
{"text":"The cheese dip is the bomb diggity!  This location gets pretty busy sometimes and the staff tends to forget to attend to you sometimes.  The Boxty is great.  Their appetizers are usually the best thing there for me.  I also feel like their lunch menu (different from dinner menu) is the better choices and values.  There are things on it that you can't get later in the evening for some reason."}
{"text":"So my husband and I had a date night and decided to go here.  We both ordered the Shepherd's Pie.  It was really good, we both enjoyed it.  I wanted the pierogi Rueben but the we're out of pierogi's. That was a bummer.  We also had a specialty shot that was so good.  It tasted like a Girl Scout cookie.  Live music was enjoyable and even though it was a crowded Saturday night, the way things are laid out, it didn't feel that crowded."}
