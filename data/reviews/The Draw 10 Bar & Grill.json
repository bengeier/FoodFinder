{"text":"Coming in from out of town and wanting to find a convenient place near the airport to meet up with other friends, I found this spot on Yelp.   This place rocks. First, the people working there are super friendly. Great list of beers on tap too. A DJ was playing some music Friday during happy hour and then a live band started later. Fortunately neither was too loud to be able to still chat with your friends.  Pool table, golf video game, and corn hole. We had so much fun we went back on Saturday evening for poker night in the back.   The photos of the outside don't do the place justice. If you have an hour or more to kill, stop by this place. The staff and owner will make you feel like you are family."}
{"text":"Slowest service I've ever been to. I came in several times and waited more than 10 minutes to get a round after round. It's new looking and at first glance it could be fun although lame af everytime I've gone in there.  I ended up boycotting this place and traveling to the next nearest bar.  Even though it was the closest to me and most convenient."}
{"text":"Friendly place. Really clean. Over 20 beers on tap. Great place to chill or watch a game"}
{"text":"Nice quaint little dive bar. Great owners. I'm always treated like family on every visit."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic. Came here with a whole bunch of friends for a bar crawl. The place was absolutely a blast. The owner is so nice and fun. We had many good cheap drinks and had a great time playing pool, shuffle board, and darts. There's also enough room to dance around the fancy juke box. I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"Great place to hang and good vibe... Scott and Debbie rock.  Totally new look a definite go to spot.  Good bike nites also included. A huge plus!!!!"}
{"text":"Here's a place with an unusual story! But it has a happy ending, so wait for it. This joint isn't too far from my office, so it's convenient for work lunches. I say \"joint\" because the name is still a bit confusing. It says \"Draw 10\" above the door, and I previously visited here before it closed. Now, the menu and website say \"The Draw\". I figure they are just waiting for new signage, since it re-opened.  On that previous visit, I ate lunch with a couple co-workers who wanted to check it out. They had heard that \"Draw 10\" was a reliable little neighborhood bar. In reality, it was a dingy, funky, old school dive-bar complete with a cigarette machine in the corner. And then it closed. And none of us were surprised.  What did surprise us was when it re-opened... As \"The Draw\". It's unclear who bought the old place and re-branded it. But one thing is very clear. \"The Draw\" is a vast improvement!  The menu is familiar, yet upgraded. The dinge is gone. And the place has an excellent sound system. Plus the staff has a new, peppier attitude. Our server Faith was excellent! Her timing and friendliness were top notch. And my AZ Kicker burger with jalape√±os was really tasty.  Nice to make your acquaintance, again, \"The Draw\". Now I know there is a reason to come back!"}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere!! Impeccable service. Great music. The owner and bartender are amazing, ,super friendly and have pride in how they run the place. You don't see service like this anymore. It's been recently remodeled and clean,  fun place hang out. Outs our new neighborhood bar. These casual places are had to find. I highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"I went here on a Friday night for the first time and loved it! I sat at the bar and the bartender was friendly and fun and kept the drinks coming. I ordered the AZ burger and it was cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"Owner very friendly. Drinks are cheap but watered down. Went to poker and had an ok time. Crying baby and teens in the poker area so didnt feel like a bar. If i wanted to deal with children i would go to dennys. Keith an african american guy playing poker totally a donkey high risk bull player. He makes playing feel sleazy. So yes felt like i was in chucky cheese rather than a lite biker bar. Had the pizza was ok and no drink special for players. So if you like watered down drinks blah food crying kids and hood rats this is your place"}
{"text":"We like to go explore local \"hole in the wall\" types of bars. We wandered in here after a long morning of volunteering at the Phoenix Zoo. They had just opened so there was no one else in the bar (we prefer the quiet bars anyway) so we sat right up at the bar and ordered. The food is INCREDIBLE and the service just as awesome. We have been back since and we're definitely going to continue coming back to try everything on the menu."}
{"text":"I decided to try and give this place a second chance... turns out if you write a bad review they won't serve you. They claimed that I reported them to the liquor board and reposted my review three times (all untrue). Interesting because this sounds a lot like retaliation. As I was leaving they said \"go write some more reviews\". BEWARE OF THIS PLACE."}
{"text":"Excellent sports bar. Friendly staff. They have the NFL Package. I showed up on a Wednesday. They had the baseball game and the replay of a football game. They also had a rock/blues band playing in the front. There is a small covered patio where you can bring your drink and have a smoke. Only been there twice, but I completely enjoyed both times."}
{"text":"Wow.....  They have new management now.  Totally different place. Everyone should give it a chance again.  Strong drinks.  Great bartenders."}
{"text":"Simple bar food. Nothing special in the way of food. Poppers juice out water everywhere, implying that they're frozen. My favorite dive bars have made their poppers from scratch. None of the food really has a signature flavor or recipe.  Showed up on a Wednesday night, at 12:30. Music was pretty loud, outside, and the front door was unlocked. Went in and the bartender said they closed at midnight... never been to a dive bar in Arizona that closed at midnight. I live next door and was really hoping for a place to hang out in on my nights off.  Showed up once on a Saturday to watch college football with some friends, and a poker tournament filled the bar up that looked like it was comprised of nothing but white supremacist. Needless to say we walked in and walked out. Freaked me out."}
{"text":"The only reason I came here is because it's down the street from my friends apartment. I will never let them drag me to that hole in the wall again.   As soon as we walked in we could not hear a THING. The band was so loud it was borderline uncomfortable. Wait, not even borderline. It was painfully loud. It's not like this place is a hoppin club where you expect annoyingly loud music. There were like 10 people there. Chill out with the headache inducing music, please.   Next, the owner handed us five shots which NONE OF US ORDERED. They then proceeded to CHARGE us for them. Now, I don't know about y'all, but when the owner hands you a drink that you didn't order, the underlying assumption is that it's free. Apparently not there.  The service was AWFUL. The bartender literally confronted my friends about why they didn't tip better. BECAUSE YOUR SERVICE IS TERRIBLE.  Don't support bad businesses."}
{"text":"I had to wake up from my Sunday siesta and give a shout out to Debbie and her The Draw 10 gang after a fun evening there!   I had a chance to talk with her about the history of The Draw 10 - it was her dad who opened up the original The Draw 10 before getting moved for construction of the 143. She and her brother purchased back the rights/liquor license in 2016, gutted and refurbished the current place on Washington. The name comes from him \"winning\" the 10th liquor license in the state license lotto the year he opened.   My friends and I were at the tail end of a fun light rail beer crawl needing a backup spot in the area because the original pick was closed, lucky for us The Draw 10 was nearby and open! Debbie welcomed us immediately and showed us a great time- she even let us paint her face with our neon paint!! Drinks were cold and not expensive- major plus for me. They have a great selection of brews in addition to normal liquor fare. We ordered some snacks off the food menu and they were great too for our mass quantities of alcohol consumed. I saw that they have happy hour specials as well during the weekdays - area offices and companies take note!  Tucked away there is darts, shuffleboard and a pool table for fun! There's also one of those high-tech jukeboxes that you can purchase music from a phone app.... we def had fun with that!   This is definitely a great neighborhood/local watering hole worth the light rail ride!"}
