{"text":"Being Valentines day this past Saturday, I called ahead and was surprised that they were taking reservations.  I have eaten here numerous times and find the food and service to be good except on this occasion. Not sure if the ownership has changed hands but we were seated after which nobody came to the table at ALL! That's right no water, no greeting nothing. The place was not that busy and it seemed the staff was clueless. We spoke to some other guests there said they had been waiting for 30-45 minutes. After waiting for 35 minutes we left. After talking to some other friends in the area I am told the service has been terrible of late. Sorry to here this as I know the food there to be great. Hope they fix the problem. Good food will not make up for poor service."}
{"text":"Great lettuce wraps, great General Tso tofu, excellent service. I will go there again."}
{"text":"I am a local and this is a relatively new restaurant that we got take-out from last night. All I can say is fabulous! I had the Shrimp Lo Mein which was wonderful. All the food was packaged in pretty large serving sizes and very hot. They are a little on the pricey side but definitely a nice change from pizza...Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Really odd setup... One big room with loud customers who like to leave their cell ringer on loud and text all through dinner. Food was fine but unremarkable... If you gotta eat and you are nearby its fine i guess but there are a lot of better options out there"}
{"text":"Food was horrible. I went because of indo Chinese menu but I got disappointed. Food quality was poor and service was worst. Not recommend at all."}
{"text":"My niece and i are traveling sushi connoisseur's so for those that think this score is low, remember this is only based on our sushi experience.  The rolls were nice looking but there was something about them that is kinda hard to point out. The spicey mayo tasted funny, not spoiled, but more like it was made of Dukes mayo. The tempura flakes were a little greasy and added a not so clean taste also. Definitly wont be going back for sushi. We've been to 21 sushi bars around the area and this was the least liked. On a positive note, the dinner plates that passed us smelled, looked excellent and were huge. I think that if we were to go there for an asia-indo dinner meal we would have posted a better rating. The staff was friendly and curtious..."}
{"text":"I gave it another shot! They brought their A game. The seaseme chicken is Fantastic! The wonton soup tasted generic but the seaseme chicken is worth a shot. :)"}
{"text":"Ordered steak hibachi and fried rice. Meet was so tough I could hardly chew it. The fried rice was brown rice and flavorless. Will not return to this restaurant"}
{"text":"Best indo Chinese I ever had. Must visit if you are in this area."}
{"text":"Food was great. Price was affordable.  We had Pan Fried Noodles and Beef wtih Mixed Vegetables.  Big servings.  We had our fill and still enough to take some home.  Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"The meal was decent and the selection of Indian beers was great. Two things that I did not like. 1) We ordered fried dumplings and they tasted and smelled funny as if the oil was bad and when we told the chef, he just shrugged. 2) we were 3 adults and 2 kids and were charged an automatic gratuity of 18%.. Really? I thought this was supposed to be done for larger groups and then I would like to have the flexibility of deciding what to tip.. Not a standard percentage irrespective of QoS."}
{"text":"My husband tried this restaurant for the first and last time this past Sunday.  The shrimp in the Saigon Rice dish were VERY overcooked.  We asked our waiter to try one.  He agreed they were tough and chewy.  He gladly took the small, overpriced entre back to the kitchen.  The \"chef's\" second attempt was not any better.  The lentil and hot and sour soups were awful...no flavor.  We were not impressed with the crunchy shrimp sushi roll.  The rice was dry and the other ingredients did not taste fresh.  Run, don't walk, away from this restaurant."}
{"text":"I tried a couple of indo-Chinese dishes here and liked all of them, specially the baby corn (dry) and fried rice. The restaurant is not crowded and service is fast. The only thing I am not a huge fan of here are the desserts.  But if I do go back to Charlotte again, I wouldn't mind getting a bite or two from here because of the exceptionally good indo-Chinese food they have."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. Our lunch meeting favorite around the office. Everything I have tried is great. This is my first review and a service to this establishment. You should try it- promised to exceed expectations."}
{"text":"The Restaurant has gone downhill in a big way since Michael became the sole owner.    It's a shame, it used to be my go to place but not anymore.   The wait staff doesn't seem to care and the food has become very inconsistent ,  and don't even bother with the Sushi, I've had better from Harris Teeter.. When there are sushi orders the kitchen slows to a crawl and you will be waiting for your food way to long.  To many other good restaurants around to bother with this place anymore.      Friends talked me into one more visit.    Sad to say, the staff still doesn't seem to care and the food is still inconsistent.   No wonder he is trying to sell the place. Jump a sinking ship....."}
{"text":"This place has kind of an identity crisis. Its name should be more like \"Indian or Chinese food, and hey, we serve sushi too\".   Went for lunch, had the asparagus tempura appetizer (which is funny because I only found one 3\" piece of asparagus in the whole assortment), some specialty sushi rolls and an avocado roll.  The sushi didn't have a ton of rice, which was awesome. Normally most rolls are significantly thicker due to the rice, but they have a super thin layer, very awesome so the fish isn't drown out in gobs of rice. Other than low rice content there wasn't anything else remarkable about the sushi.   The restaurant itself was set up weird. There are no dividers in the dining room, making it a loud echoey mess and cafeteria feeling. You can clearly hear conversations across the building like they were at your table. There are some paper lanterns and other chinese decor, but seriously, room dividers. Planters. Trees. I don't care. Break up the sound.  For the area its overpriced, but still good. The variety of rolls was low, but the rest of the menu had lots of options, mostly Chinese and Indian food. It would probably be a solid work-lunch choice, only because 1) who cares who eves-drops on your work lunch conversation, 2) lots of variety, lots of vegetarian things, lots of plain things, everyone will be able to find something 3) not a place you'd want to go any other time, especially a date. Never go here for a date.  Three stars for the nice low-rice sushi rolls. I couldn't really get over the atmosphere. The only reason I'd go back would be to try some Indian food now I know thats more up their alley."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery twice from Asiana, the portions are borderline ridiculously large so save some cash and split a pad Thai (a little spicier than I usually prefer but was still good. ) Enjoyed it overall."}
{"text":"Typical chew and spew, underwhelming food, mediocre service,  school cafeteria feel and overpriced, o yes the food- I guess thats why you dont see any cats around yuk yuk and yuk!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to many \"sushi and or Asian fusion\" restaurants all over the country and I have to say this place is one of the best. They have a great mix of Asian dishes from Thai, Chinese, Indian, etc. I've tried 60-70% of their menu and I've never had anything I didn't think was awesome, save the pad thai which could use a little more punch. I'm a fan of Asian food in general, but the quality here is on par with the finest restaurants I've ever been to that charged twice or three times as much. This place isn't anything fancy, yet it's no hole in the wall. The service is very good, I've never waited longer than 5 minutes to be seated no matter how busy they were and the wait staff always puts forth the extra effort even if they're not your \"assigned\" server. The chef is always coming out to ask patrons how they like the food. You've got to love a chef who cares. The whole red snapper is awesome, but it's at least a two person dish!...sushi menu is extensive yet has a good variety. Nothing tastes like it's been sitting around waiting to be ordered. I've been to this place no less than 25 times in the span of 8 months. Being a single dad who dates often, I do eat out regularly. Needless to say, this place is on my very short list of awesome places to eat whether on a date or getting it delivered to my house which thankfully is less than a mile away. Eat here and you'll love it too."}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere is great here. Very romantic dim-lit dining area. The waiters all seem very happy and friendly here too! Our food was hot and very fresh and we will come back here again. I love this part of Mecklenburg County because it feels very upscale and professional.  Asiana Fusion is open for lunch or dinner and we prefer dinner being we are more night people and love the lighting at this restaurant at night! The food was ordered and in no time at all it arrived to our table with great service! I'll Be Back!"}
{"text":"Just got this for the first time it is right near my work and it was incredible! We got the Mongolian beef, Kung pow chicken and sweet and sour chicken not a thing I didn't like. Although the Mongolian beef was definitely our favorite."}
{"text":"Am writing this review purely based on the Indo-Chinese dishes I have tried.  This is my favorite place in the recent times and would never get bored of eating here. Do not forget to ask for any specials outside the menu. I strongly recommend the Mike's Chicken and Mike's Paneer(vegetarian) appetizers. I almost have them twice a week and are my favorites. Try the soups and special Darjeeling spicy noodles, feels heaven.  The ambience is pretty decent and the staff are ultra friendly. Their suggestions would never disappoint you and they know their stuff.  Everything is freshly cooked and the chef Michael is an amazingly talented guy.  I would undoubtedly rate 5/5 for this place."}
{"text":"Went here on Saturday night and was quite amazed.  Am from New York and very used to good Chinese, Indian, Japanese (sushi), Thai and Vietnamese foods.  Was so thriilled to find all of these - tried one dish from each cuisine and they were all excellent - in one place, especially since I just moved here."}
{"text":"If you're hungry, don't bother ordering the food delivered. We ordered online and it took them 1.5 HOURS to deliver it (we're 5 minutes from the place). Here are 5 reasons NOT to order from here:  1) I called after an hour, it took 6 calls before someone answered  2) Once someone finally answered, I was told the driver had left a little while ago and he should be there shortly  3) 20 minutes later, I called back and asked the person to call the driver. He put me on hold and then came back to tell me the driver would be here shortly. When I demanded a refund if he wasn't there in 5 minutes, the person then ACTUALLY called the driver  4) Once the driver got to us, he asked if they'd told us he'd be late. Which of course they hadn't.   5) After all that, I ended up getting sick after eating it!!"}
{"text":"So there wasn't a review for Asiana on here and I had a BOGO Citipass coupon for the place so I was a bit conflicted about how my experience would be. The result? Fantastic restaurant in the Fresh Market strip mall offering different types of Asian cuisine---Chinese, Japanese and Thai. My three faves in one?? Yes please!   I went tonight and was surprised to see the place hopping seeing that I've never head of it neither did my friend who lives up in Cornelius. They have about eight to ten booths with some tables in the middle, dimly lit with a variety of music playing. The menu is huge with separate listings for appetizers, rice dishes , noodles, entrees and sushi. They have sushi rolls that are only $3 to $5 in addition to their regular sushi menu. I wanted sushi so badly after scanning their extensive menu however the cold chill tonight had me looking for something to warm me up. I looked and looked and everything looked delicious so I went with old faithful---shrimp pad thai. If you mess up pad thai, that's how I know you're a bad place. And it was quite tasty!! I like how they put peanuts on the side and it is enough for two or three servings so I could enjoy it there plus take some home for leftovers one day. The pieces of shrimp they threw in there were huge and fresh, score!   Service was fantastic, when I was just over half way done with my drink, they would grab it and have a refill out to me within a minute. It's a very team oriented restaurant, you have one server but everyone is there to help out and get you what you need. Bonus points for getting a good fortune in my cookie--something unexpected is going to happen to me soon that will bring me money---I dig! I hate that I had a really awesome experience and don't live near this place. If you're in north Charlotte, be sure to check this hidden place out and remember, two coupons in the Citipass book!"}
{"text":"This place is so great! We had 6 people and we each got a dish to share and passed them all around the table- it was so delicious! I highly recommend it and we will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Ok... So food is very good and so the ambience. There indo-chinese stuff is amazing. We tried paneer kathi roll. That was great.  Then they have tandoori fried rice which is also very good it has a smoky flavor.  Last but not the least, there is Micheal's chicken, it is not on menu, it is a dry chicken dish and is very good."}
{"text":"The service there is awesome! I always get the green curry and salad with ginger dressing. This is the best gren curry I have ever had. The portions are huge! So you always have another night of delicious food in you fridge. I've never really had real indian food, but when I go there and order an indian dish, I usually ask for a suggestion and the waitress always suggests the right thing for my pallat.  The sushi on the other hand is not so good. I definetly wouldn't go there for the sushi.  But if your looking for inexpensive chineese/indian food. Then you should definetly check this place out"}
{"text":"This is not my first visit here, I just had a feeling they would not be busy tonight. I was right, walked right in and was seated immediately. I love this place because the food is always good they always have coupons or grupons without restrictions. The servers always are professional and attentive. I just wonder why no one that works here ever seems happy. Well if you haven't eaten here come and try it!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had a wondeful time here Saturday night!  The food was amazing! The service was excellent!  Our waiter was very friendly and helpful with the menu. The chef personally delivered the food to our table, then checked back with us to see how we were enjoying our meal.  We felt like we were dining with family.  My husband had a seafood hot pot special that was full of large shrimp, scallops and chunks of salmon. It was spectacular!  I had the grouper special, lightly fried and then covered in a delicious sweet sauce full of ginger and fresh vegetables. The spicy tuna roll sushi appetizer was great as well.  If you live near lake norman this place is a must visit! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Soup wasn't good and there was an automatic 18% gratuity placed on my check! What the hell? The server came to the table once to fill drinks and to bring food.. our chicken was dry and hard and the rice was hard and seemed over cooked. 90% sanitation score.. I won't be back!"}
{"text":"Not bad.....not great. Service left something to be desired. We took in Asiana this past weekend it was just an okay experience. Here's my quick take on the food.....and service.  Chicken Lollypops - had these as an appetizer. They came out looking delicious. Unfortunately much of the \"meaty\" factor that gave them their visual appeal turned out to be fried chicken skin. Once past that the Indian flavor was apparent yet not overpowering and they were decent.  Asiana Flaming Dragon Roll - this was a tempura shrimp roll topped with cruchy flakes, tuna,eel and chili sauce. I traded the eel for shrimp. For a signature roll it was presented in a pedestrian way. Flavor was pedestrian to match, very bland and nearly overpowered by the chili sauce. NOT worth ordering again if I return.  Hibachi Steak - I will once again use the pedestrian term....not bad but bland. Steak was a touch overdone for my G/F's taste. She substituted the mushrooms for broccoli which they kindly did for her (points for service).   Chicken Fried Rice - my son had this and he ate the majority of the plate. I took a bite or two and it was refreshingly light and not heavy as some Asian places make it. I would order this again if I return.  Service - we were seated quickly and drinks were served shortly after. Waiter was helpful and friendly in taking our order. From there it was downhill on service. Food took a few minutes longer than I would have liked but not enough to try my patience. Once the food was served our waiter disappeared. At this point they were busy and appeared overwhelmed. We ended up having another waiter take care of us as our original waiter would no longer make contact.  2 stars from me mainly because of the service. Had the service been better I would have given 3-3.5 stars but mediocre food and slow service left quite a bit to be desired."}
{"text":"Ventured here for Saturday lunch because my husband bought a coupon from restaurant.com.  We started with the ginger salad, hot and sour chicken soup and chicken lollypops.  The star during this course was definitely the lollypops- fried just perfectly, not greasy, and the flavor was the ideal combination of Indian and Chinese.  Top it off with the sweet/sour (and refreshing) dipping sauce and you'll be pleasantly surprised.  My husband had the hibachi chicken served with sweet carrots and an assortment of veggies, I- Haka noodles, described as a lighter version of their lomein.  Usually hibachi chicken is good, but not that exciting..not this version. The chicken was semi-sweet and the carrots were firm, but not too hard.  Their shrimp sauce (white sauce) is excellent too.  Haka noodes were delicious as well.    Service was EXCEPTIONAL and our portions HUGE!  We will definitely return.  I only worry that they might not make it much longer because we were 1 of 2 couples in around 1PM. For our sake, I hope they do!"}
{"text":"Excellent Fusion Food.  Authentic.  Love to try the different dishes, especially what the daily specials offered by Chef Michael.  Try the different sauces too.  Ranges from Asian to Sushi.  Little bit of everything for everyone."}
{"text":"Amazing food . Great variety. I have eating at many Chinese restaurants. This place is by far the best and unique. Owner Michael is very talented and personable"}
{"text":"Ordered the crab Rangoon tonight which were very good. We tried a new dish, Singapore noodles veg, which were also very good but extremely spicy. It would be even better toned down a bit. I like hot and this was realllly hot. Micheal stopped by our table and asked if we would order it again and we said prob not because it was so hot and he said he could make it next time with less heat just let him know."}
{"text":"So disappointed!   My wife and I ordered sushi which was decent, and I ordered chicken hibachi.   Well the hibachi came with huge chunks of carrots that look and taste like they came out of a can.  Not sure what all the people see in this place.  We have eaten at many sushi or Asian restaurants in the North East, and they all blow this place away."}
{"text":"Awful! I ordered $39 worth of sushi and it was disgusting, it was mushy and it smelled bad. Plus it took almost an hour and a half before it arrived. First and definitely the last time we order from here."}
{"text":"At $9 for the normal sized carafe of hot sake, it was just ok.  The sushi was good; I had a rainbow roll, which normally comes with eel but the chef allowed me to substitute, and suggested red snapper.  I also got the cone shaped spicy yellowtail thingy (don't remember what they are called) and both were very good.  Menu selection was surprisingly limited, but my meal was good, service was good, and it was clean.  I would eat here again, but not very often."}
{"text":"Disappointed!! Drove almost 30 miles expecting great food but nothing turned out as expected. Man chow soup was terrible , chicken lollipop was just crispy batter but almost no chicken meat !! Tandoori fried rice was quite good , that's the only reason for 2 stars and Michael chicken was good but was already cold when it was bought to the table. Overall waste of time and money driving all the way there."}
{"text":"The food is always great here.  It is just so slow.  It tools about one hour to get our food and the place was 50% empty.  This is despite the fact they have two cooks in the back.  Not sure what the hangup is there.  I would recommend this place only for take out.  Order your food...come in an hour...take it home and reheat it."}
{"text":"Went for dinner. Very quite comfortable atmosphere. Beers and wine were cold. Sushi was fresh. Ordered the Kung Pow chicken (delicious) and the Hong Kong crunch (amazing). Wait staff as very attentive."}
{"text":"Take my advise and skip the sushi.  The Indo-chinese food is delish!  We have eaten here sometimes as often as 4 times a week.  Usually at least once a week.  You cannot go wrong with most dishes (we have tried most).  My advice is to skip the sushi and the Japanese food.  I personally can live without any of their japanese dishes - miso soup, hibachi, teriyaki, etc but I  love the salad with the carrot ginger dressing.   The customer service is fantastic, they treat us like family.  After 3 visits they knew our drink order and what our kids liked to eat.     My recommendations: In the mood for soup? The won-ton is a great choice (light broth, 2 won-tons, spinach & scallions floating - refreshing). When I am feeling under the weather I go for the Manchow (spicy and delish).  Appetizer? Ask for the Michaels Chicken (Michael is the owner/chef) - it is not on the menu but is so worth a try (the only way I can describe it is,  like a spicy tandori chicken not on the bone, super red, fried, plated with accompanying slivers of spicy peppers and onions - I could live on in it & man would my sinuses be cleared if I did. Or, get the lettuce wraps. Got kids with you?  Ask for the cruchy won ton strips & duck sauce for dipping - the kids will be pleased.  For dinner, my favorite - the grouper.  Michael's moms recipe sauce,  fish and veggies - oh my.  It reminds me of a hot fish dish at a popular chain restaurant, only it is better. When I am not too hungry I go for the Bun, I take half home (it is huge, enough to share with another person - or eat for lunch the next day).  It is a great summer meal light, refreshing and filling but not heavy.   I also love the manchurian, szechaun, mongolian moo shu, kung pao, ginger lovers (if I am sharing with a non spicy eating friend). Add those sauces over your choice of protein (chicken/tofu/beef) and you have a delish meal.   If you are looking for what I consider \"American Chinese food\" (sweet, saucy & fried) as for the sesame chicken/beef - it is like little bits of crunchy delightful candy. Finally there are more traditional Indian dishes, although I tend to stick to the Indo-Chinese.  If you eat the sushi and then give bad reviews shame on you.  I told you to skip it."}
{"text":"This is our 2nd visit to this place and just like the 1st time, the service was excellent!!! The sushi & sashimi were simply amazing and the beef patay was great. Great friendly staff and the chef came out to make sure everything was great"}
{"text":"Great food. Specifically chilli baby corn, gobi manchuri, tandoor fried rice, mango mousse and fried ice cream!"}
{"text":"The service was so pleasant, timely, not overbearing or pushing us to hurry. Very good server.  Yummy food too, and there are at least 3 more dishes I want to return to try. So the menu was full of good sounding things."}
{"text":"Waited an hour for two rolls and a salad and some broccoli.   Was charged 9 dollars for steamed broccoli that was supposed to come with rice which I didn't get.  My sushi order was wrong also.  Only thing the staff could say is they were slammed in the kitchen there was only 14 people in the whole place.   I wouldn't eat here if it was free after this."}
{"text":"Really interesting- Real Fusion.  I expected something like P.F. Chang's which is pretty much American Food with teriyaki sauce or soy sauce thrown on it, but Asiana serves an eclectic mix of authentic Asian Cuisine.  I like the Mongolian beef, fried rice and the hot & sour soup has the right bite accompanied by tasty little mushrooms.  The salmon skin roles are yummy and the service is great."}
{"text":"We took a chance knowing how picky our kids are. My hubby orders the General Tsao which he liked but order is huge so he didn't finish it. I got the Bun (Vietnamese Noodles) with Shrimp. Very good. It's going to be my go to meal. One of my son got the sizzling steak and shrimp. He wasn't a fan of the broccoli but he isn't a fan of anything green. He loved it though. This kid is the hardest to please. Pricey at $17 but glad he ate it. Another son got the Asian Fried Rice. Large serving only was able to eat half. Very good. My daughter got the Lo Mein noodles. They did a child version for $5 and took out most of the veggies. She didn't really like it but her brothers took a crack at it and ate it. We all tried each other's meals and liked it. We were pleasantly surprised. It's now going on our \"regular\" restaurants. Good choice. Bill came to about $79."}
{"text":"The food and service are both great. The crispy Ruby Dragon red snapper is amazing, that's if you like fish. I've tried many of the other dishes as well and they were all good."}
{"text":"This place is a joke. Teenager wait staff who play the whole time.  Don't even bother!!!"}
{"text":"Wasn't going in expecting much but came out impressed. The spring rolls were perfect, crisp not oily and perfectly brown. The chicken marsala was spectacular and the indo chicken with manchurian sauce with gravy was very good. Has a spice to it if that's your fancy. Very clean and pleasant atmosphere. The chef came to our table and asked if we were pleased with our meal.. We were. They even asked if we would like a extra cup of rice to go with our leftovers.  We'll be back :)"}
{"text":"Tried this place for lunch for the first time today. Had the crab crunch roll, the chicken and shrimp spring rolls and a chicken kata roll. It was all SO good and made fresh when I ordered. The crab crunch roll had pieces of crab stick instead of the shredded crab \"salad\" most places use. The waiter was very helpful, explained what things were and what he suggested. I am taking a class nearby and will def come here again."}
{"text":"I tried this place on a whim as I had a Groupon. Food was very mediocre. I tried the teriyaki chicken which was very dry and plain. Almost no flavor whatsoever. My husband tried the sushi and did not like it. The rolls were incredibly small with almost no meat. Service was sub par at best and its slightly overpriced. There are other better Chinese/Japanese places in the area I'd rather go."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favourite place to grab dinner. The food is delicious, tasteful, and unique. The owner (who is also the head chef) can tweak each dish to make it custom to order, and has had training overseas to really drive home that authentic taste. This place is a hidden gem- a true diamond in the rough. I would recommend getting the general tso tofu or paneer, with some of the hot and sour soup. The pad Thai is also excellent. This place also boasts an extensive sushi menu. This place is great for vegetarians, and people with allergies. Parking is easy, free, and available. If you're in the area, this place is a MUST."}
{"text":"The 3 star was for delivery and how I enjoyed the flavors.  My lack of 4 or 5 stars was solely for my enjoyment of the food.  I wanted to like this place but I guess \"fusion\" doesn't always hit the mark.  I wanted the Thai Curry and was so excited for it ...and it tasted nothing like Thai curry.    To their credit: - Ample food, delivery was great, I'm sure many people would love this, and ordering via the web was great.    This 3 stars was really about my enjoyment and not from their lack of effort and in no way reflects a dine in experience.  I may try another dish from their location and update this in the future.    Sorry guys, this was just a swing and miss for me."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery to a local dog bar and did not receive a fork or other utensils so I was unable to eat it. The food will spoil before we get home so it was a waste of money altogether. I tried to call immediately to see if the delivery guy could bring me one and the restaurant did not answer the phone at all."}
{"text":"One of the WORST dining experiences my hubster and a I have shared. We went on a Friday early evening. The place was not full by any means, yet we had to wait 20 minutes just to get drinks, and then another 15 before our order was taken. We saw the offer of Hot Pot and were really excited as our daughter has been to China and we wanted to try that dish. We ordered that and I asked for the corn soup. After another 25 minutes the waiter brought out the food. He spilled hot broth (Hot Pots are boiling hot!)onto my leg and never appologized! Glad I was wearing jeans and not shorts. The cook did not make the requested soup. The waiter and (?) manager/owner(?) were arguing in the dining area. The \"hot pot\" was not a true hot pot! It was a bowl of hot soup with ingredients you would never find in a true hot pot. With what we paid, this should have been a wonderful meal. It was meant to be a celebratory send off meal with our daughter who was moving across the country. Major fail."}
{"text":"Ordered take out and asked for two side salads. Got home and no salads at all but a cup of soup. The main entree was correct but all of the food was not good and tasted old. Noticed when picking up the food the sanitation grade was a B with an 88.5 score.   Will not be back."}
{"text":"Delicious Indo Chinese food. The best I've had! Loved the general tsao and Mongolian beef"}
{"text":"My favorite place to grab dinner during my college years at Davidson (much better than Sabi which if it weren't for proximity to the campus, I don't think anyone would ever go to). Was also fun to go with a large group of friends and do family style meals. Friendly staff and amply sized portions. Can't wait to come back when I visit. Also, the Manchurian paneer - true Chinese/Indian fusion is a must try if you like paneer."}
{"text":"We get take out.  The food is great.  Not a lot of choices in Cornelius for Asian food.  This place is our favorite.  The prices are good as well!  They deliver quickly and the orders are always correct."}
{"text":"I don't write reviews often but this place deserves it. Everything I've gotten here is 10 times better than other similar places. Their Chicken Satay is AMAZING and so is the Sweet and Sour Chicken. You can taste the quality of this food and it is so much different than your typical Chinese take-out."}
{"text":"EW! Seriously worst food ever! I should have thought twice before eating at a place that sends coupons out through the mail! Now I see why they're desperate for business. My second warning sign should have been that it was completely empty when I got there at dinner time. Still though, I ordered the Pad Thai and it was horrible. Totally not traditional Pad Thai... for some reason they smothered it in sauce. It's not even that I'm mad about wasting the money but now I also have a horrible stomach ache too! My advice would be to eat here if you want to pay to throw up! Never coming here again."}
{"text":"We really wanted to like this place because my daughter and her fiancé LOVE sushi and this is the one place none of us had eaten.  We should have headed for the door when our waitperson came to the table. His appearance was... Unappetizing. Seriously. He had on a short-sleeved shirt and had what looked like track marks on his arms. His hair was greasy and he had what looked like sores around his mouth.  I am not trying to be judgmental but this IS a restaurant and presentation matters. Perhaps he had a non-contagious health conditions. We certainly hope so, as he WAS working in a restaurant. And people need jobs and we figured he wasn't COOKING the food so...  The good:   The spring rolls. The teriyaki chicken. The drinks. The wonton soup. The dumplings were so-so.   The bad:  The (white) sauce on the pan-fried noodles was congealed. The \"fried rice\" with BURNT onions was actually brown rice and tasted like cardboard. (The teriyaki sauce helped with the taste.)  The sushi smelled like it had gone bad and didn't taste fresh."}
{"text":"If you love Pad Thai, don't get it here! Ordered mine with chicken (as part of a pickup order), tasted like rice noodles, scallions, and chicken with barbecue sauce! I can't comment on their other dishes, but this one was really not good!"}
{"text":"Just ordered our meal to be delivered and it only took 15 minutes!  It was hot, fresh, and delicious.  Definitely have found our new favorite place."}
{"text":"What can I say, I'm a fan! Indo-Chinese made right, right here in Charlotte (or Cornelius), wow! Even the \"nicer\" Indian restaurants know how to screw up their Indo-Chinese food (read: lack of soy sauce, addition of curry leaves - yuck!) but Asiana's, rather Michael the chef, does a wonderful job. Needless to say, I went crazy here. I ordered the Chicken in manchurian sauce, which I highly recommend, the chili baby corn, the hakka noodles and Michael's special chicken. The Manchow soup was delicious too! And the prices are great! I'm so happy to have found this gem in Cornelius, minutes driving distance from work. Now there's more reasons to look forward to going to work!"}
{"text":"Tried this place out for the first time a couple weeks ago. It wasn't bad. I didn't have any of the sushi but I tried a couple desi dishes and they were ok. I didn't really like the chicken 65 because it was drier than I anticipated. However, the service was great, parking was ample and the prices weren't bad for the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  We have been going here for probably 2 years and never had anything short of a fantastic meal. The staff is great, especially Michael who will help you pick your item if you don't know what you want.  We usually get the same things everytime but this time wanted new items.  We went with the Manchurian Chicken dish and Chow Fun noodles with Beef.  Both were excellent.  Also ordered an app of Michaels Chicken which was both of our favorites.  It had great heat with the chiles."}
{"text":"THE BEST ASIAN FOOD IN TOWN!!! Chef Michael always comes out to check on everyone. The staff is always so nice and pleasant. I've never had sushi, mostly because I'm a vegetarian and there aren't a lot of places that cater to that. Well, Asiana has vegetarian sushi and it is DELICIOUS!!!! I usually get the lo-mein and my husband gets the Mongolian beef.. And we devour it every single time. Our friends were just in town from Asheville and Raleigh. We took them to Asiana and everyone was so impressed. The chili oil they have is to die for :)  I definitely recommend Asiana to anyone. There are so many choices on the menu that everyone can find something they will love."}
{"text":"Asiana is a nice addition to Cornelius.  They offer Indian, Thai, Chinese, Japanese, and Vietnamese cuisine - plenty of choices for everyone!  We started with the lentil and hot and sour soups. The lentil soup was not like mulligatawny soup served in Indian restaurants. This was a slightly thinner version with lentils and other vegetables in a tasty broth. It was really good, but a bit salty for my taste. My hubby had the hot and sour soup and thought it was better than the typical Chinese variety.   For our entrees, we tried the shrimp chow fun and shrimp tandoori fried rice. The portions were huge (plenty for leftovers) and both dishes were very good.  They were also loaded with large shrimp. It was neat being able to have both Chinese and Indian dishes at the same time.  The atmosphere was casual and service was quick and attentive.  They also offer delivery if you live within 5 miles and have a minimum $15 order.  We'll likely return!"}
{"text":"Me and my wife really like the food here, however it loses a star because the service is lacking even when there is no one else there. The mongolian beef is our favorite. The pad thai is descent also."}
{"text":"I've gone here many time the Indo-Chinese menu is amazing and I keep ordering off there every time. The deep fried baby corn is amazing. I don't understand why this place isn't packed. I love how the owners always come out and talk to you."}
{"text":"Cant speak for any other dishes but the Pad Thai is the best I have had in my life it is extremely well done with a balance of all the flavors Pad Thai should have which is very rare to find. Service varies but most of the time they take care of you. Atmosphere is okay but could improve."}
{"text":"I waited almost 45 minutes for 2 sushi rolls and an order of dumplings. The hostess who helped me was kind and courteous but otherwise not a great experience. Sushi was very average as were the dumplings. The wait was a big turn off especially since there were 2 tables taken in the entire restaurant."}
{"text":"I have driven by this place every day for the 3+ years we have lived here...sadly I stopped here today.  The kids wanted sushi, and since sushi on the lake caught fire haven't found a place in the area I liked.  Decided to try this place finally because they had sushi and Crab Rangoon...I had a craving...and sadly the food was very less than average and the service was even worse. Food came out at random times, and took way too long considering we were the only ones in the restaurant. Apparently everyone in the area already knew what I didn't.  Anyway, I'm always one to try something once, but this will not be a spot we try twice."}
{"text":"Asiana, your Sushi is indeed Fusion. But getting beyond that point, first look of this place is casual dining. My family is cray-cray for Indian Chinese food( which is the best marriage of indian spices and chinese grease) and every time I visit them in Charlotte, they bring me to Asiana. I dont think I've tried going beyond indo-chinese, although they have an extensive menu for every other form of normal \"fused\" asian food.(fried sushi anyone?) So we always start with babycorn chilly which is in essence, babycorn battered, fried and dipped with spiced chillies. I'm yet to crack the code to its cripy-ness. Next, we tried their tandoori rice(smoked rice with vegetables), chicken lollypop(deep fried drumsticks), chicken chilly( breast pieces deep fried and served with spiced gravy) and manchurian( deep fried cauliflower floating in spices). Its soy sauce festival folks! How can one go wrong with all the oil,salt and the right amount of MSG.  You have to brace yourself for the guilt indulgence that comes with Indo-Chinese. If you can squish it during your meal, I guarantee you a flavor heaven food that might just be deemed as comfort food. And these guys do justice to the fusion. Almost tempted to run to you everytime we need to pause a family squabble! JK, I *heart* my family."}
{"text":"My husband and I dined here while in Charlotte. Very interesting place and blend of menu choices. The atmosphere was very \"family friendly\". There were several families with multiple kids that were very comfortable, so it was slightly noisy. We didn't mind cause we know what its like, but if you are expecting a quiet dinner, this may not be the place for you.  We ordered sushi and Pad Thai. The sushi was not good at all. I was very disappointed. The menu stated \"tempura\" but there was nothing cooked/fried in my roll.   The Pad Thai was very good, however! The chicken was seasoned perfectly and the flavor was delicious. I loved the way the noodles were cooked along with the vegetable pairings. We were impressed with how great the service was and would dine here again and just not order sushi."}
{"text":"Michael, the owner, walks to all the tables and spends time talking to customers and makes it a very customer friendly personalized experience. Michaels chicken is his classic dish. Dishes here have a perfect blend of Chinese food with an Indian touch."}
{"text":"Walked into silence - greeted by someone relatively nice. She asked a coworker to turn the music on. We sat next to a window in a both and ordered drinks. Unsweet tea for him, hot green tea for me. She dismissed to obtain our drinks while we waited we browsed the menu and I hear the \"lovely\" beeping of a microwave. It was then when I realized that she was indeed hearing my tea in it. Deciding on veggie spring rolls as she arrived with your drinks. When they arrived they were drowning in oil. Generous in size, but none the less the oil dripped from them as we picked them up. We did indeed them, agreeing that since we were the first ones to arrive for the evening that they must have heated the oil to quickly and not allowing it to reach the proper temperature. Thinking that surly the entrées would be better. Oh were we wrong! Needless to say, we are out $33 and won't be back. I would like to take this time to also advise you to not visit this place as I am completely sure that you will have a similar experience."}
{"text":"Asiana is kind of a hit and miss type place, as any \"fusion\" place is in my opinion. Especially when the food isn't \"fused\", but just two separate menus. It's a bit confusing since you are given two menus. The main menu contains everything, which includes appetizers, sushi, hibatchi, noodle bowls, rice bowls, and a few Indian-inspired dishes. The second menu has just the Indian-inspired dishes, so it's kind of pointless since those items are already listed on the regular menu.   While the menu may be a mess, the rest of the restaurant is not. If you're looking for a quiet place to enjoy a meal with that special someone, this may be the place. Not only is it naturally quiet but the tables are all given plenty of personal space, so you will not be rubbing elbows with your neighbor. The staff was also pretty friendly. While our particular waitress seemed to be a bit out there, the other employees (possibly the manager or cook) came out several times to see how things were going.   For an appetizer we ordered the chicken lollipop ($6). It was not what I expected...it consisted of six huge chunks of chicken on bone. It was deep fried in a heavy batter that was spiced, and served with a spicy oil-based sauce that had some garlic, lime, cilantro and other stuff in it. Here's the thing with the chicken: it would have been good if I was chilling at a bar and ordered it as bar food or a late-night snack. However, this dish was simply too heavy for an appetizer at a Asian/Sushi/Indian restaurant, and the oily sauce was just not a good option as I would have preferred a more \"dippable\" sauce.  We also ordered one roll of sushi as an appetizer, since we had heard and read that the sushi was not the best. This ended up being quite true. We ordered the kamikaze roll ($13) which had some tempura shrimp with crab, eel and salmon. Unfortunately the roll was served warm and had quite the \"fishy\" taste to it. Now I know some people may say \"what do you expect when you order a sushi roll with a tempura item\" but I have had plenty of tempura-filled sushi, and the rest of the roll is never that warm. Sure there's a warm part where the fried item is but the rest of the roll (particularly the fish part) still remains cold. This was quite the turn-off, and I would never order sushi from here again.  Then it was dinner time. I ordered the tandoori rice dinner with beef ($12.) It was a spicy dish consisting mostly of basmati rice with the beef, egg, onion, sprouts, cashews and raisins all covered with a some \"Indian\" spices. I was pleased with the overall dish, and particularly enjoyed the spice. It was the perfect level of heat that I find ideal to my own personal taste, as it was hot enough to get a heat in your throat and for your nose to run, but not hot enough to the point where I needed a sip of milk with each bite. I must add that you get plenty of food for the price, as I didn't even finish half my order. They really do heap the food into your plate, and if you can finish your entire order in one sitting by yourself then you must be a Sasquatch.  The miss' went with the haka noodles with scallops ($12) which was scallops, noodles, egg, cabbage, and other veggies in a somewhat sweet sauce. This was also a pretty good dish. I have to say that the scallops were cooked perfectly, as they were at just the right texture. I really enjoyed the sauce that it was served with, as it was light and sweet and definitely not as heavy or salty as you would get with a lo mein dish. Like my rice dish, this one was also chock full of food, and the miss' will probably get at least two more lunches out of her leftovers.  We also grabbed a dessert to go (we wouldn't normally, but had a coupon for a free dessert.) Since we were taking it home it kind of eliminated some of the dessert choices, and in the end we settled on the tiramisu ($6.) I wasn't expecting much at all, and those expectations were definitely met when we cracked open the  container and attacked the dessert. There was virtually no coffee flavor and an overall flavor of \"sweet\" definitely overpowered the tiramisu. It was a decent serving size (the miss' and I split it and were content with the size we had) but the flavor was just wrong, wrong, WRONG. While I wasn't expecting good tiramisu from a restaurant focusing on Asian cuisine, I guess part of me just had to see how the approached it. Maybe I was hoping for a \"fusion\" tiramisu with some Indian spices or something, but nope, just a sugary piece of cake.  It was hard to rate Asiana. Part of me wanted to give it a few more stars for the nice interior, friendly staff and solid entrees. Yet another part of me was torn with the overall menu and horrible sushi. In the end I think three stars is just about right...I'd be willing to go back for an entree, but I'm in no rush, and there's no way I'll put another piece of their sushi into my mouth. I guess I learned my lesson; some fusion places are bound to be as scattered as their menu."}
{"text":"My favorite item is turning out to be Manchurian, with \"gravy\" (that just means sauce), with pakora.  It's pretty good.  I eat for three days from one order."}
{"text":"Consistent.  Great Cornelius spot.  More of a foody joint than 'fine dining'.    Skip the sushi (they don't have enough volume on sushi to maintain it and should stick to what they do very well - Asian Fusion.    Basil chicken, Manchurian, etc- excellent.   We eat here a few times a month."}
