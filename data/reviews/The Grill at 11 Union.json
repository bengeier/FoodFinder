{"text":"Great food for the price, clean interior, good service, food was out in a reasonable amount of time."}
{"text":"I love this place!! The People are always very friendly and my food is great!! I hope this place hangs around for a long time!!"}
{"text":"The service here was exceptional! I asked to taste the soup and they were generous in the tasting cup size. We wanted a sweet sauce to go with their delicious hush puppies, but they didn't have any so the chef made us a custom honey-garlic butter that was spot on. Food was also freshly cooked and servings were huge. Nothing beats a local spot with friendly service."}
{"text":"The Grill at 11 Union. Right on the strip in downtown. I stopped in here while in the area checking out some breweries. Im so glad I did. This place is technically inside of the mall, kind of on the corner. Cool location. Outside its street parking only, and the building is a classic antique store front. Inside there are plenty of tables for seating. No frills diner style place. Service was fast and friendly. Large menu with sandwiches, pita's, subs, salads and some other items. I ended up with the 49er, a roasted beef and cheese sub with mayo lettuce and tomato. Seasoned fries on the side. It was all made to order, came out hot and fresh. Nice portion size filled me up for the whole day. The taste was great, light toast on the bun, good lettuce, fresh tomato. The beef had been heated on the grill had a great taste, and cheese melted over it. It was indeed mouth watering. Fries were perfect, nice crunch on the outside, not too greasy. My friend got the honey sriracha fries. They were good, but I didnt detect any honey or sriracha. Other items delivered to tables close by looked good, and I overheard several other customers say how good their food was. All in all I enjoyed my visit, and would gladly eat here any day."}
{"text":"Good food, great location. It's fun to sit in the window and watch Union Street go by. Service was very friendly. The hush puppies are really really good, and my kid liked the house made chips with his burger. We'll be back for more!"}
{"text":"Everything was wonderful! Coming back for sure. Kiddos said that their turkey &bacon sub was the best they've ever had. Their chicken pita was"}
{"text":"I love this Grill in downtown Concord. Parking can be a little hard to find on the street but you can park in the shops parking lot on the opposite street and walk through the path to the downtown business strip.  This place is a no thrills, casual restaurant with great service and great food! After reading several Yelp reviews and looking at pictures I had a hard time deciding what I wanted to order and then I was told of the specials of the day which made it even harder. One of the employees convinced me to order the Pulled Pork BBQ sandwich with fries. There was a generous amount of BBQ on the bun and the BBQ was on a sweet, saucy type of BBQ which I was hoping for an Eastern NC, vinegar base BBQ but I really enjoyed the BBQ sandwich. It was a lot and I was not able to eat it all even though I wanted to. The fries were great, crispy and hot.  As I sat there waiting and eating my food I constantly saw orders coming out that looked really good. This was the perfect place to come for a casual lunch and the prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Great food, the service is good, and everyone there is so friendly! Just like Wayside's sandwiches but a convenient walk through downtown concord to get there. Seems like it is becoming a popular lunch place. Get the Honey Sriracha fries you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I can't find a single reason to recommend this place other than maybe a friendly wait staff.  Went in with my wife and son on a late Saturday afternoon.  We ordered a bacon cheeseburger with avocado and no bun with onion rings and a grilled chicken salad.  The burger was meh and the onion rings were gross.  Undercooked and in a weird batter.  The salad was pretty mediocre.  Nothing about it was fresh.  In addition, the place is really nasty dirty.  My shoes were slipping on the floor and half the tables were dirty.  There were four tables in there and I'm pretty sure at least two sent something back.  Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Great breakfast.  The liver mush was thick sliced, eggs cooked perfectly, good diner coffee. My buddy said the waffles were exactly how he liked them.    Can't wait to get back. Great view of downtown."}
{"text":"Be careful yelp sent me the wrong location...was passing through town had to ask some locals where it was located... the service is very friendly and the food was good"}
{"text":"We tried this place out today solely based up Yelp reviews and have to say we were not disappointed.   My 8 year old daughter and I were off today so wanted to try something new.  Super nice servers and staff.  We split a Philly and it was great.  Fries were the seasoned/breaded type and not a big fan but that is subjective and they were cooked perfectly.   We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I can't get behind this one. They give you ice cold kraft marinara sauce that you peel off the top with your mozzarella sticks. WHY????????????  The pasta salad is very bland. It was stuck together and not seasoned at all. They did not have any soups as it said they would on the menu. The chicken pita was so dry and the tzatziki sauce that was on the side was extremely watery. Boyfriend had basically a fried cold cut Italian sandwich that was oily. We tried...... it was very busy so we will give them that. Zero excuses for the peel back marinara. Gross"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a classic soup, sandwich, salad shop in downtown Concord this is your spot.  Their fast and friendly service (and their very reasonable prices) is a major plus! I had the turkey reuben and my hubby had the cheeseburger pita.  Let me just say I had major food envy (his cheeseburger pita looked and tasted amazing...he let me have a few bites.) All in all a great spot for a quick and yummy lunch."}
{"text":"What a quaint place Concorde is.   First The Bead Lady then we find this cute little cafe/grill. If you want good southern hospitality, good prices and good food check out The Grill.  The service was great, the food was fast and delicious. Located in the Union Street Square South building with great views for people watching on a cute street with shops. The environment was very inviting and the food was cooked great. The soup was basically out of a can but overall the experience was great.  I would definitely visit again in the future.  Ordered: Double Cheeseburger  Club Sandwich 2 - Philly Cheesesteaks"}
{"text":"I've been a couple times here and it's always great food at a reasonable price.  Great service and it's nice to sit in the window and watch people go by.  Great downtown location, however, parking is tough during the busy day.  Definitely will go back again!"}
