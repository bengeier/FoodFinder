{"text":"I never had Peruvian food before, so I was actually very excited to try something new. Unfortunately the experience was nothing to brag about. 

Location: The restaurant is located in a hidden plaza on Richmond. I walk in with friends and the restaurant is completely empty at 8pm on a Wed. Did the dinner rush pass through and we missed it?!

Service: One waitress. She was friendly, but the service was painfully slow. Getting food recommendations from her was no easy task. The food took over 30 min to be served...

Food: Salty and dry. My friends and I ordered and ate family style, so we tried 3 dishes. I'm not a big fan of ceviche, but my friends peruvian friend recommended the dish. We tried the fish ceviche, which was a big disappointment. The dish was too fishy for my taste. The A pollo a la brasa is a very traditional dish. It is basically a rotisserie chicken Peruvian style. Also served with a side of French fries. The chicken was moist at the first bite, but became more dry as we cut to the center of the chicken. The Chuafa Peruano can be compared to a typical Asian fried rice dish that my mother could have made at home, but less dry. The seasoning of the rice was the only kick to the dish. Probably the best, from the 3 we ordered. I do recommend the \"purple corn drink\" if you want to try something new.

Overall: Would I come back? Probably not."}
{"text":"The food at this restrautant was outstanding. The service was great and had a friendly atmosphere. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"The location was easy to find, and the food was really delicious. But I have to say that the 1.5 hour wait to get anything more than water was really a let down. The waiter who was all by himself with 9 tables that for the most part of the time also had no food never came back to check on us.  I had to walk overand tell him we were leaving since even the sides of plantain that we wanted as an appetizer hadn't come out yet. Finally done of our food came out.but still waited another 15 minutes for my mom's  meal.  Sup make sure you have plenty of time!  Especially at these prices!"}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday afternoon and it was pretty empty, so we weren't sure how good the food would be.

This place is solid. We got the half chicken, ceviche, rice, and yucca fries. The ceviche was mas o menos, but the other stuff was excellent. No way could we finish all of the food.

Was a great deal for good food. Just wish they had an outdoor patio. Can't wait to check out their salsa night."}
{"text":"This is a very unique experience elevating food to an art both in flavors and in composition with the colors and form.  I've enjoyed eating at the restaurant both and lunch and dinner with only but great food experienced.  Plus they have a very nice wood floor for dancing that goes on almost every night."}
{"text":"excellent food
we almost did not go because some of the other reviews were mixed
we went anyway and had an excellent surprise
we recommend the ceviche, sousa, and the grilled chicken shish kabob
favoring is subtle but delightful
be sure to go, it's tucked away in a so so strip mall 
but food is a real delight"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. My friends  food was tasteless. My mom and I's dish was cold and very acidic with a sweet potato wedge to balance it...horrid. the menu didn't say it was a cold dish or heavy acid I was sick to my stomach before finishing - didn't even finish. My father was indifferent and also said very little flavor. We have been to Peru before anf this aside from the large corn was far from a resemblance. The menu is poor doesn't have side salad on the a la carte which we asked for not sure of cost. Quite expensive was far from worth the drive from Akron ... not getting out NYE tickets would be sick if all acidic.

Service was ok slower then normal but wasn't too long of a wait for fresh food. Was no frills we way over paid for the 4 of us."}
{"text":"We found this place from a Groupon. It was completely empty when we got there which should mean the staff would be attentive. But he was more into watching an episode of the Simpsons. He told us the draft beer was out of order so we had two Cristal's a Peruvian beer. I ordered the Arroz con Pollo and it was terrible. I think they cooked it lightly and then microwaved it before giving to me. It was very tough and very hard to cut. I couldn't eat it. Sent it back and the next piece wasnt much better. To make matters worse we got the bill and found out those bottles of beer were 7$ each!! Crazy!! Overpriced so the groupon we used hardly made a dent in the check. Will never go back."}
{"text":"Huge disappointment.  I was excited to try this place, having recently learned of it.  I had an uneasy feeling when I first walked in. It had the appearance of a '60s \"rec room\" with the furniture pushed aside.  Eventually we learned that was to create a dance floor, for Tango Tuesday.

The server, although very friendly and trying hard, clearly knew nothing about the wines.  My husband asked if there were any Peruvian wines, not seeing any on the list. The answer was no.  Interesting.  So we ordered a Spanish wine, only to be told after a few minutes they were out of that bottle.  Our next choice was an Argentine wine, and the server returned with an Italian bottle .. we just said ok.  Pouring a test taste was not a familiar practice; she just poured 2 full glasses... Ok, so much for the wine service.

Next we ordered an \"avocado and beefsteak tomato\" salad to share, having been told that it was large enough to share.  It was, but also was disappointing for the price.  There were 4 wedges of a pinkish tomato - far from ripe, although local produce at this time in August is readily available.  Along with some generous pieces of avocado (with pieces of the peel still attached), the pink tomato rested on a big plate of iceberg lettuce, covered with an enormous pile of sliced onions.  How unimaginative!

I ordered the \"catch of the day\" ceviche and my husband had the half chicken.  His chicken had a nice presentation, but he reported it as dry and flat in taste.  The catch of the day, which I suspect is always talapia, was heavy on lime taste, but not much else.

We won't return.  There are too many wonderful restaurant choices in Cleveland."}
{"text":"When I saw this through a friend's facebook post made me wonder about Peruvian food in Cleveland.  So far it is the only one in town and let me tell you it is simply amazing! For those who do not know what Peruvian food is.  It is an interesting unique blend of Hispanic and Asian flavors. Bold, savory and FRESH with a little bit of spice.

All their dishes are cooked fresh with fresh ingredients every day. The head chef is super friendly and will make special Peruvian dishes in advance if you ask for it. FYI the portions are huge. Personal recommendation is to get things served family style.

Ambiance is simple, clean and Peruvian...lol when you see it in person you'll understand what I mean.  They have a side bar which makes great drinks. 

I highly recommend the place for any foodie."}
{"text":"Lovely place. The food is authentic and made from scratch: we went for lunch and they were not busy. Service was great. I will be back for food and dancing: they have Latin dancing on weekends."}
{"text":"Worst dining experience ever!

Went with my husband and 2 daughters. My husband and I ordered an appetizer to share and separate entrees. They accommodated my youngest with chicken fingers, but brought my older daughter the wrong entree at the same time as her salad, and brought the other appetizer I was to share with my husband, with my husband's entree at the same time. The kitchen was very flow despite the place not being very busy.. There was one large family and a few small tables. I never did get my entree and we had to leave to make it to a movie. We noticed the bill was wrong so I went to the waitress to complain about all the mistakes that were made during our meal and asked that the appetizer that we didn't order be taken off our bill. She had the nerve to tell ME I needed to learn some manners!! I then asked for the manager to complain about the rudeness of the server after all of the mistakes she made, and she became nasty with me as well. I don't see this place lasting much longer with such a disorganized kitchen and rude staff. And the food I did get to taste was just ok. Don't waste your time or money ( many items overpriced) going to this restaurant.. Cleveland has too many others that are actually enjoyable."}
{"text":"I really, really wanted to like this place.  I've had amazing Peruvian food before, and was so excited to find out about Nazca.  But unfortunately I was pretty disappointed with my experience here.

We'll start with the good - because there really were a lot of good things!  Our waitress was very friendly and enthusiastic.  We did not experience the long wait for food that others have mentioned.  The restaurant was clean, easy to find (big signs on both the front and side of the building), and I liked the Nazca artwork.  Food-wise, my pisco sour and our appetizer (Causa Rellena de Pollo - we had the tuna, not chicken) were both outstanding, and everything we got was beautifully presented.  Also, the hot sauce is legitimately hot.

But sadly that was all over-shadowed by the bad.  I'd say my number one complaint is the pricing.  I thought the prices online were pretty high, but I had a Groupon (paid $15 for a $30 credit), and was willing to pay a little extra for the unique experience.  But then the prices in the restaurant were all higher even than what's on the website!  For example, I had the Chupe de Cameron, which was a large bowl of soup with 4 shrimp in it, and it was $13.99!  If you're going to charge $14 for a bowl of soup, it had better be some magical soup (actually the best soup of my life was a seafood soup I had in Lima, which is why I was willing to give this $14 soup a shot), and this was not even good.  It could have been good, but it was so salty that my salt-loving husband couldn't even finish it.  My next biggest complaint was that food came out not as described on the menu.  This is a  HUGE deal for me - I don't understand why restaurants think they can just swap out an ingredient and people won't notice.  It was especially problematic that they substituted chicken for beets in the otherwise vegetarian Palta Rellena con Ensalada Russa.  Aside from the potato appetizer, the food ranged from too salty (the soup) to boring (Arroz con Mariscos), and just wasn't good enough to justify the expense.  

Also, the restrooms aren't actually inside the restaurant, but out in the lobby, which is fine.  Except that there were no lights on in the lobby, and it was so dark that I couldn't  even see the sign indicating which door was the bathroom.  Hopefully this was a fluke, but it didn't do anything to help my experience.  

As sad as it makes me, I can't imagine going back."}
{"text":"I was so happy to find that a restaurant like Nazca existed in the Cleveland area. Where else can you get higher end Peruvian dishes? When I dined at this restaurant it was a weekday and not very many people showed up while I was dining. This always makes me nervous and makes me think the food is not going to be good- I was wrong!

My date and I first started with the Pasteles de Cangrejo a la Trujillana (Crab Cakes)- WOW! Best Crab Cakes in Cleveland by far!! They were prepared to perfection!

For the entrees my date ordered the Ceviche Mixto and I ordered the Arroz con Pollo. The Ceviche was not my favorite and my date didn't care much for it but the Arroz con Pollo was extremely delicious! The Cilantro Rice- I could eat that everyday and be a happy camper!

I suggest that everyone check this place out for a different kind of Cleveland cuisine."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!!! My wife is Peruvian and it is difficult to for us to find a good Peruvian restaurant here in the USA. But this is the best we have found and the food was awesome! Took the wife and 3 kids to here and we all loved everything we ate. I will go back!!!!"}
{"text":"First time there!  Used a Groupon to try it out.  We will be back.  The Crab cake was just like I would expect in Baltimore.  Lots of crab and little filler.  Service was good, friendly, and explained to the rookie about the different items to choose from."}
{"text":"Moved locations from Warrensville Heights to Eastlake. This is absolutely, handsdown favorite restaurant.  We always get the beef heart for an appetizer...do NOT be afraid, it is AMAZING!! Husband got the lamb shank entree and I got the chicken over cilantro rice. Best food you will have!!"}
{"text":"This is the worse run restaurant I have been to in a long time and do not believe they will stay in business much longer.
I first went to try this restaurant before Christmas. Their website and all Google listings show that it is open from 11:00am most days. My wife and I went there for lunch and drove 45 minutes for a late lunch at 2:00pm. When we got there the door was locked and the lights were off. The sign on the window said that it opened at 3:00pm which is not what they say on their site. We decided to wait in the parking lot until their opening time. Three o'clock rolled by still nobody, 3:15, 3:30, 3:45 still nobody. We tried calling their phone number and nobody answered, not even a voice recording. We gave up waiting and went to another restaurant. Later that evening we called and somebody answered. They said they had some trouble with the lock and made some excuse why they were not open. I don't know how they could have trouble with a lock if nobody even was there.
My wife and I decided to try one more time after the New Year. We called them just before noon on January 5 to find out their hours. Someone actually answered the phone and told us that they would be open that day at 3:00pm. My wife and I again drove the 45 minutes each way to get to this restaurant and arrived at 3:05pm. Nobody was there and again the lights were off and the door locked. We decided to wait until 3:30pm and tried calling a few times with no answer we decided to throw in the towel and give up.
We will never try going to this restaurant again. As far as we are concerned, they do not deserve to be in business and should be ashamed to be called a restaurant. We would never recommend this place to anyone and recommend that nobody should waste their time trying it."}
{"text":"I was recommended to this Peruvian restaurant. I can now say this place was not what I expected. The place was hard to find, once we walk in the place is totally empty. We waited to be seated (remember this place is empty). The service and food were horrible. We waited for our food probably 30 min. And when the food arrived it came all at the same time. Entrées, soups, salads and main courses. When we asked the server to take it back and to bring it out slowly  she was very upset. I have a stomach ache from the food. I won't even mention the wine list. Please avoid this place and save your money."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME!!!!!!! The weekend nights are Home to Salsa lovers in Cleveland period!!!! If you are in Cleveland Ohio and want to dance salsa this is the place to come on Fridays or Saturdays! The food is good as well.. See the thing is and in Peru there are many different regions and they have different ways of making dishes. Overall since I am peruvoan and from the Coast of Lima I can recommend the Choros a la Chalaca here is off the hook!!! that and the Anticuchos are my favorite things! But the Chef Cesar does very well representing our Culture and our food here in Cleveland !"}
{"text":"Everything was exceptionally good - food, service, value.  The chicken soup was full of cilantro and five-star good.  My mom had the Arroz con Pollo and it was very good as well with plenty of interesting accompaniments.  The beef heart kebabs were AMAZING.  I also had the ceviche -  it was good, but the portion size was extremely large.  We really enjoyed everything and being able to taste some authentic peruvian flavours.  Bonus- A variety of well-crafted Veggie sides à la carte and at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"The food was decent which is why I gave it 2 stars.  Service and efficiency, definitely 1 star.   I've been wanting to try this place for some time.  I finally had the opportunity this weekend.  I arrived at approximately 8:30 on a Saturday night, which is \"Salsa Night\".  I arrived to the host seated on a bench behind the host stand and the  dining room was mostly empty.  There was salsa music playing from a laptop computer on stage.  I was seated immediately and given a menu.  My server approached, filled my water glass, took my drink order and I also mentioned that I was ready to place my dinner order.   She didn't offer appetizers, nor a run down of the daily specials.  I ordered the Chuafa Peruano, which is essentially fried rice and a glass of Sangria.  The Sangria arrived shortly thereafter.   It consisted of red wine and pineapple juice, no cut-up fruit or anything.   It was tasty but definitely not Sangria.  I glanced around at other tables that had ordered cocktails and there were plenty of orange/lemon/lime slices, so it would have been nice to have some in my cocktail, as well.   The wait for my food began, I finished my water, shortly into my 30 minute wait for food, my glass was never refilled by my server nor any other server.  I had no idea it would take so long for a plate of fried rice.  The server never came back to check on me during my wait or to even let me know how much longer my food would take.  I noticed that other Yelpers mention the long wait, as well.  The restaurant should really have complimentary bread or tortilla chips to snack on, while you wait.   My food finally arrived and it was seasoned well, but the proportion of protein (6-7 medium shrimp), to the massive plate of rice and veggies, was very disappointing.   The server never checked on me during the meal.  I also had the opportunity to watch the male host shimmy and dance provacatively behind the female bartender, it was at that point that I finished the meal, requested the check and promptly left.   I left feeling slighted and underwhelmed. I probably won't return anytime soon."}
{"text":"Good food, but mediocre service and clearly not designed for lunchtime visitors - the menu had few small plate offerings and nothing besides appetizers does less than ten bucks."}
{"text":"I purchased a Groupon offer for this restaurant and was very excited to try it. I am originally from Puerto Rico so I like to try any Hispanic/ Latin restaurants on occasion.  The location of the restaurant is a bit tricky. You can miss it if you are not paying attention (as I did). The place itself is not very big, although the dance floor is. I went on a Tuesday night (Tango night) and the place was pretty busy. A lot of music and dancing going on.

My server was very nice and courteous and even gave me a little education on the regions of Peru and the food. I had the Chaufa Peruano, Stir fried rice Peruvian style with , chicken, shrimp and steak, red peppers bell peppers, green onions, and carrots and a side of sweet plantains. The meal did not take long to come. The portion was very big and filing. The taste was good but a little too much like Chinese food. Don't get me wrong it was tasty but I was expecting more Peruvian flavor. The plantains were delicious. I also had a Peruvian beer for the first time. I am a fan of craft beers so this one was too light in taste for me but a nice compliment to the meal. For dessert I tried their coconut flan. I must say I was a little disappointed with it. It didn't have enough coconut flavor and the dried coconut shavings on top distracted from the smooth texture of the flan. 

All in all I recommend this place and I will go back. But next time I will order something more Peruvian tasting."}
{"text":"Been here twice for dinner.  Excellent menu choices, well executed.  Service is very friendly and competent.  Questions about menu items were answered accurately.  Portions are generous.  I'm looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"Dinner and a movie anniversary evening plans ruined by lack of communication and professionalism from Nazca operators!

Explanation: I've dined here before my attempted patronage this evening. The food was great. It was just the type of cuisine this area lacked and Cesar delivered some great dishes with a flavorful punch. They make one of the better ceviches I've had in the area! Made anniversary plans this evening for dinner and a movie... or more like movie and dinner. Getting home late from work and having to get up early the next morning, we didn't want to plan anything too formal. Matter of fact, quite the opposite, but we were looking forward to a nice meal at Nazca. Started our evening with a 7pm movie at Regal Richmond. It was a pre-screening of Horrible Bosses 2, so no other times were available. The movie projected to be about 1 hour and 40 mins long, getting us out close to 9pm. Nazca's website and Yelp posted their closing time at 10pm. I called ahead to Nazca to confirm their closing time and if they could accommodate us if we came in around 9 to 9:15. Man on the phone told me that they don't actually close until around midnight. Pleasantly surprised, I figured we didn't have to rush our meal and our evening. We pulled up to the parking lot around 9:15pm. Walked in the door and found salsa music loudly playing, with strobe lights shimmering in a dimly lit room and tables pushed aside to make room for a few couples dancing in the middle of the dining room. I thought to myself \"okay... I'm sure we can still enjoy dinner at the corner\". Walked up to the bar and tried to ask for a table only to be told that the kitchen is already closed. This was at 9:15pm, 45 minutes BEFORE their posted closing time of 10pm, and 2.45 hours before their phone-stated closing time of midnight. Really guys?

Guess what our anniversary dinner turned out to be? Chick-Fil-A down the street. Really! Thanks, Nazca!"}
{"text":"Initial impression: questionable location, pricey menu, not sure if the food would live up to the price.  Well, All I can say is Damn good food! The quality and presentation of the food far exceeds the 4 walls they serve out of. Had the fish chicharrons and hot pepper aioli. It was a great dish! Portions were generous and the service and waiter were great as well. Highly recommend!!  I'm officially hooked on Peruvian food!!

{"text":"We purchased a living social deal and got a $30 certificate.  I'd not heard of Nazca before but being a big fan of Peruvian food and having parents who lived there and managed a hotel in Cuzco in the 50's I was excited to go.

The restaurant is a little hard to find, tucked into a business park type setting in an off the beaten path corner of Richmond Road adjacent to 271.  The interior is fairly small with about 15 tables.  The colors are nice golden yellows and browns.  

The menu is extensive and has a lot of traditional Peruvian dishes.  We opted for the Anticuchos de Pollo (marinated, skewered and grilled chicken kabobs) which arrived with a couple nice chunks of papas (potatoes) in a bed of Huacaina sauce.  If you've never had Huacaina sauce it is the Peruvian national sauce and consists of a creamy and spicy sauce with a hint of mustard.  It sounds odd at first but trust me, it's delicious.  

We also had a Papa Relena (mashed, stuffed and fried potato ball).  

Both appetizers were excellent. The flavors were crisp and notable. Anyone who eats this food and thinks it is \"tasteless\" needs to go to a neurologist and an ENT immediately.  

We also had a couple or three glasses of the Cline Zinfandel, a nice full bodied Zin we've had on several occasions.  It was served in full bodied glasses (thankfully) and opened up nicely during our meal.  

For our entrees we ordered the Ceviche Peruano and the quarter chicken.  

My Ceviche was the single complaint of the night.  First, I have to say that the flavor was perhaps the perfect balance of tart, sweet, tangy and citrusy for a dish of Ceviche.  Unfortunately the fish portion consisted entirely of Tilapia.  Don't get me wrong, I'm a Tilapia fan when it comes to Ceviche and it's extremely popular in Peru but a few shrimp or a scallop would have broken up the dish and made it a bit more enjoyable.  

The portion was huge the flavors were perfect.  

To the reviewer who said their dishes were \"cold and acidic.. horrid\", that's called CEVICHE.  It's RAW FISH cooked using CITRUS.  It's served COLD.  Should I speak s..l..o..w..l..y... for you???  It's a sublime gastronomic experience but not suitable for the Big-Mac mafia.  You went to a Peruvian restaurant, not Golden Corral.  Oy vey.

My wife's chicken was delightful.  Perfectly marinated, grilled and smoky.  The fries that accompanied it were perfectly fried and crispy.  It was served with a delightful green sauce that I believe contained tomatillo and cilantro.  There was also a small dish of chimichurri. 

All in all we were very, very pleased with our visit.  And before our discount the bill was $75.  The prices are not as bad as the reviews would have you believe. 

If you want authentic Peruvian food I'd suggest Nazca.  If you are frightened to try scary foreign food stay at home and order a pizza.

{"text":"Having been to Peru and having fallen in love with the culture and cuisine there, I was sad to return to Ohio and have to special order things and make Peruvian dishes myself. 

Nazca opened up in late March or early April of 2013, and it has been amazing every time I've gone! 

Chef César has traveled extensively and was actually born and raised in Peru. He is fantastic. 

What to order? 

Feeling adventurous? Go with the anticucho (cows heart, or chicken heart). 

Less adventurous? The lomo saltado is wonderful- beef, French fries, vinegar, Peruvian spices, marinate, etc. 

No adventure at all (like my housemate)? Pollo a la brasa. Admittedly it's fantastic, it's rotisserie style, perfectly seasoned chicken, served with a side order of aji Amarillo (spicy sauce common to Peru).

Okay, now stop reading! Go here!"}
{"text":"Very good Peruvian food service however lacks a bit. Overall experience was very good. The Ceviche was amazing will go back I recommend it"}
{"text":"This was our  first time and we were very impressed. The food was wonderful. The presentations were beautiful and very creative. The menu was so extensive and intriguing that we would love to be able to go back frequently to sample everything. We loved this place!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing.  The restaurant has a great atmosphere considering it's in a strip mall. The servers were very friendly. They were understaffed for the evening, but that didn't change the quality of the food. It was delicious. Very rich and flavorful. The music was romantic."}
{"text":"This place was a-ok. I was hoping for some blackened Peruvian chicken like they have in DC, but my dish was more muted flavors, and the whole restaurant was missing the fried plantains. The tamale appetizer was good though. Every dish we ordered was flavored up with pickled red onions thrown on top, which I found good on the first dish, but odd and too one-note when I saw it on the other two as well.

Good spot if you want to try Peruvian, but for the cost, I'd usually rather go elsewhere. Although I may be back for salsa dancing they apparently do every Friday and Saturday night"}
{"text":"First time here.  There were eight in our party. Very good experience.  Enjoyed the food and service was good. We had potato dumpling appetizer.  Very unique spices. My wife had the Arroz con Pollo and I had the Crevice Mixto. Both were very good. Waitress was very helpful explaining the menu and suggesting dishes."}
{"text":"Excellent time with friends and coworkers. Friendly server and great tasting food.

Will definitely be coming back- especially for Salsa night!"}
{"text":"My sister and I went to grab lunch since we wanted some extra strength for the marathon shopping we were about to do. She lives near Nazca, and I like trying new cuisines, so away we went! Upon arrival, there was not a host or server in sight - strange. We waited and waited. Finally a person being trained went and got the server on duty, who was in the bathroom for a long time even after being informed. Awkward! Hope she washed her hands. 

So finally, we were seated. Since it was lunch time, we ordered an Avocado salad and the Ceviche Mixto. As the only eating patrons there, it took a darn long time to get the food! Once arrived, the salad was underwhelming. $9 for a sad pile of iceberg lettuce. The ceviche was a redeeming factor at least. For $13, there was a huge amount of fresh tasting fish, squid, octopus, and shrimp. 

In the end, I feel like I did not get the best representation possible. We barely felt accommodated by the server, the food service was slow, and we were only impressed by 1 of 2 dishes ordered. That's a pretty big failure overall if you ask me!"}
{"text":"This place is CLOSED!!! No notice on the website or Yelp that it was closing. Left here very hungry and thirsty No cars, no lights, closed, Closed, CLOSED!!!!"}
{"text":"Easy place to pass when driving by, and when I came in for dinner at 830 on a Saturday the place was an awkward ghost town. The staff was wonderfully friendly, and usually I strangely hate friendly staff but these guys were legit cool. 
Beef heart appetizer. I've never had beef heart before but this was delicious and unintimidating. Tasted and felt almost just like steak. I'd definitely recommend it, esp if it's your first organ meat as it was mine!
I got the mixed ceviche, which was delicious but a lot of one flavor in a huge dish, I think it needs to be paired with something or have some way to mix up the flavors. Also I found a horrifying mussel in mine that looks like it had a wadded up ball of ocean hair in it, I just didn't eat it and was a bit weirded out. But I think that's something the kitchen staff should have picked up on and discarded. 
My friend got the arroz con pollo, the rice was amazing and the chicken was fine (I'm not a huge chicken breast fan). I think I'd get that over the ceviche if I came again. 

We stayed till nearly 1am because the salsa dancing was great fun to watch, some amazing dancers come here! But also some total newbies. None of the guys were being creepers! Plenty of dance space. And some of the girls were wearing 6 inch heels and mini skirts but some were in jeans and flats, honestly it felt so nonjudgmental and friendly you can show up in anything and fit in fine. I was very impressed with that, and for that atmosphere I'll definitely return. 

Tip though: park on the edges of the parking lot!! If you park in the middle people will park you in on salsa night!! Yes it's ridiculous but an entire row of cars will become parked in!!"}
{"text":"I have never had Peruvian food before - and I am not sure I will again. For 2 entrees and 2 drinks, this meal was ridiculously expensive for what we got - $63! Without tip! The lamb shank was overcooked, the chicken was incredibly salty, and the service was sub par. 

We came on a Wednesday night, and the place was dead. The waiters did not seem to be on the same page, 2 different servers came to take our drink order, and the menu did not have the prices of the $9 drinks we ordered. I felt obligated to finish my very strong drink because of the price. While the staff was nice, service was pretty slow and the huge prices did not deliver huge flavors."}
{"text":"The pollo al braza is the best chicken I've had in Cleveland. Nothing comes quickly because each dish is prepared to order. Caesar and his staff treat you like family. You want a good dinner eat at  Nazca."}
{"text":"I am sorry to report that Nazca is no longer in business.  We tried to eat there twice to redeem a Groupon and found the restaurant dark, with no cars in the parking lot.  I was able to get Groupon to credit my account because I had notified them of the situation, prior to my coupon's expiration date.

Nazca had wonderful food, and we miss it."}
{"text":"If it is really closed, it was LONG overdue.

First time we checked this place out on a Friday night when it first opened, and it as an absolute disaster. We waited to be seated forever even though the place was almost empty, the waitress did not know anything about the menu, had no idea what drinks were available, and was completely overwhelmed. Our food came out at different times (party of 6, and no one got to eat together), I ordered the half chicken and one of my friends did too... and they were both COMPLETELY F'IN RAW inside. I'm talking the plates were bloody and all. The waitress took it off our bill but the rest of the experience did not improve. Also, the food was so ridiculously overpriced. Almost ALL sort of understandable for a new restaurant, so I thought we'd give it another try mostly because we had a Groupon. 

Second visit was just about a week ago and NOTHING changed. We pulled up and thought the place was closed. We walked in and did not see anyone around. We waited for 5 or so minutes before some frantic guy ran out of the kitchen and finally seated us. He told us he was the waiter and cook. He served us water and left. We didn't see anyone else for about another 15 minutes... at this point I was ready to leave but I thought about the Groupon and that it needed to be used, so we stuck around. Finally, the owner walked in and came to our table. Turns out he was going to be our waiter. I know he was the owner because I have met him at their original location previously. He made it a point to tell us all of their food is fresh and made to order, and that they don't pre-make anything at all. He assured us we would love the food. We didn't mention our initial visit.

We placed our food orders right away. We tried to keep the dishes simple, especially after we looked at the menu and noticed the sky high prices. This shit was ridiculous. My sister ordered a $10 Caesar salad that was literally a couple of leaves of romaine lettuce and a side of french fries. My fiance ordered the ceviche. I ordered the half chicken again in hopes that it would be better this time. Owner claimed it was \"amazing\" and that I should order it and wait until it comes out so I can be amazed. I also ordered a glass of wine, and my sister got a vodka soda. He brought the glass of wine and everyone's food but mine. He proceeded to tell me that the half chicken will take \"a really long time to cook\" and asked if I wanted to wait, or order something else. Dude waited to tell me this WHILE bringing out everyone else's food. I changed my order and ordered french fries and the cordon blue. This shit was so bad, I had 2-3 bites and left the rest of it. Meanwhile, he never returned and we were assigned another waitress who was so lost, I felt bad even asking for anything else. 

We asked to pay and our bill came out somewhere around $70. With the Groupon, we ended up paying around $40. The waitress took my phone in the back and didn't come back with it for at least 5 minutes... weird.

All in all, it's a good thing this place closed because I'd hate to see anyone else wasting their time and money on a place like this. Just terrible."}
{"text":"Nazca has some wonderful food.  I was amazed at how authentic it was having lived in Peru for a couple years.  There were several positive aspects that I experienced during my visit to Nazca but I am afraid that the cons outweigh the pros.


I had the papa a la Huancaína, pollo a la braza, and Inca Kola.

Portion size to cost ratio:  this was easily one of the biggest disappointments that I had.  When I read \"papa a la Huancaína\" on the menu I thought it was a typo because I could not fathom one potato costing $9.  When it arrived I was so surprised to see one of the smallest potatoes ever on the plate.

I ordered the 1/2 chicken and it compensated for the small papa.  My wife and I split it.

While I lived in Peru I ate cucumber, tomato, olive oil, and lemon salad every day.  It was a favorite.  If I wanted to have that at Nazca it would cost me $9... For tomatoes and cucumbers!?  No thanks.

Selection:  this was a huge let down for me.  I was hoping to have tallarines verdes and some jugo de maracuyá but neither was on the menu.

Summary:  overall I loved the food at Nazca.  It was delicious and very authentic.  The only thing that wasn't authentic was the price.  Maybe I'm just used to having Peruvian food for less than $5 but my main suggestions would be to add at least 2 more potatoes to the papas a la Huancaína and add a few menu items while making the prices much more realistic."}
{"text":"Eh. I've had better Peruvian.

Came here tonight with fellow yelpers. We were like, \"ooh, a Peruvian place!!\" and had heard it was good...so off we went to the east side to pay a visit.

We arrived at 8pm tonight (Wednesday), and it was completely empty. Utterly empty. I mean, it's a weird location, but still.....??

And surprisingly, for being the only ones in the restaurant are service was REALLY slow. I mean, c'mon, we were the ONLY PEOPLE! The waitress kept disappearing on us, even in the middle of me asking, \"what do you recommend?\" Bah.

I've had good Peruvian food in SF and DC, so I was a tad disappointed in this place. We ordered the chaufa peruano (essentially, Chinese fried rice, but much drier), the ceviche peruano, and the classic pollo a la brasa (which, the chicken was also dry too).

The yellow sauce was pretty good that came with it, but I just thought overall, the meats were too dry, and it just wasn't the flavorful, moist food I was used to tasting. The ceviche itself was okay too, bu I didn't think it was that great. I've definitely have had much better in bigger cities.

My friend did get the purple corn drink which was good though.

Would I come back? Yeah, probably so, because I think we went on an off night, and I would be interested in seeing their salsa night weekends. But for now? I've definitely have had better."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch on a weekday and their posted hours show they don't open until 3:00.  So does not appear that they serve weekday lunch any longer.  I would call before u go to make sure."}
{"text":"We went on our anniversary, but didn't know if it was open or not because all the lights were off inside. It was in fact open, but the first 4 things I asked for on the menu they were \"out of.\" I finally ordered what they suggested and took a chewy bite. My chicken was raw. Raw! To top it off, both of our plates were cold except for the rice. The waiter was nice enough, but (I'm sorry)- you just can't serve raw chicken. Don't go."}
{"text":"I sooo want this to do well, but for now I have to give three stars as a restaurant (wish I could give 3 1/2). But for a night spot is give 4. 
Flavors are there, portions are too big for this to stay in business. 
Ingredients were very very good, but the execution was lacking. 
Ceviche was too imbalanced, too much lime juice swimming at the bottom, and the cilantro should be more interspersed. However huge in portion size. 
Chicken breast was well seasoned but so large that it was tough. I would suggest to fillet and cut down the cook time. 
Rice was excellent. 
Vegetables excellent
Steak kebabs, well seasoned but slightly tough. However I would have again. 
Service is... Relaxed.... Let's say Peruvian. :) be prepared to not rush. 
The shining and gleamingly awesome part of this place is the dancing. Tango Tuesday was a blast to watch while finishing our meal, the kids enjoyed a whole new experience. 
All in all if I owned this, 
1. I would cut portions / slight price adjust to more tapas style (great introduction and share plates for Peruvian adventure)
2. Balance the dishes to benefit the flavors
3. Push the wine and cocktails (make a Peruvian Sangria)
4. Wait staff to be more on top of the service
5. Keep the dancing!! Maybe expand to an outdoor patio with great music for dining guests."}
{"text":"Good Peruvian food. Our first time we chose a wonderful seafood soup/stew and a chicken and rice dish, half I took home. Delicious!  The crab cake appetizer was the best ever. Succulent meat very lightly fried. Saw that the tables are easily moved for Salsa dancing several nights a week."}
{"text":"Wow, I didn't know what to expect?  In many ways, this was exactly what I expected and other ways it was a surprise!

You pull up and you find the spot by looking for the huge speed boat crashing off the roof.  Inside, we entered through the \"Saloon\" door to find an open dining room that felt more club, than restaurant, but had little touches of Peruvian flavor around.  The location is not the drawing factor (unless you're coming on Friday or Saturday for salsa night....then it's worth it for the location alone!).  We came for the food.

Our group ordered quite a few things.  I loved the grilled beef heart and the potatoes with yellow pepper sauce were delicious!  That sauce, on the Aji de Gallina (Chicken) was amazing!  We got everything from pork roast to beef tips to soup to ceviche.  It was all very good - came out with heaping piles of cilanto and was well presented.  I loved the ceviche, best ceviche I'd had in a while!  Nice and fresh!  

Our wait staff took care of us.  It's a good opportunity to practice your spanish too!  

Now...I just need to come back for salsa on weekends!!"}
{"text":"So disappointed to drive such a distance to find the place closed at 4:15pm when the sign said open from 11am to 10pm... I will not come again"}
{"text":"Latin dancing class and then party on Saturday nights are so fun!!!! Loved it last night and it was so close to home and a great event if you and your friends are looking for something new and fun to experience."}
