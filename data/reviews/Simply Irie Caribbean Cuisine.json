{"text":"Ox tail was dry and microwaved, beef was too chewy and tasted old. The patties barely had meet in them. Will not return unless they start making their meals fresh."}
{"text":"Avoid at all costs. Long waits, nothing on the menu in stock, low quality food."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed a roti and breadfruit with jerk sauce. Cool friendly vibe and very taisty food."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. Not only is it right around the corner it also has a great selection of Jamaican food. For starters, it is definitely overpriced.  Regardless, I still was hoping it would be tasty.  I had the jerk chicken dinner with a beef pati on the side. The chicken was very dry. When I ordered it they just grabbed it out of the steam table. It would appear that this chicken had been sitting there for quite some time. The spices were varried. One piece had next to no spice or flavour while the next was overpowering. After I removed the skin, there was a 2cm thick coating of spices which was unbearable (I do like hot food). The pati was actually pretty good and so were the sides (coleslaw, rice with beans).  I'll try the rotis at some point but the jerk chicken isn't worth it"}
{"text":"Best roti in town hands down. Good music and reasonable prices. Very friendly staff. Highly recommend this spot. It truly be IRIE"}
{"text":"My husband picked up a take-out dinner from Simply Irie on his way home on a Monday evening. We both love Caribbean food, so were hoping that we found a delicious go-to place close to home. Sadly, we were extremely disappointed.  The food containers had their own little compartments, but the rice, coleslaw and meat still managed to be sloppily strewn about and inter-mingled.  This wouldn't have been so bad, but the ox tail dish was comprised mainly of little bones and sauce (WHERE WAS THE MEAT?! for $16, you should get some meat), which got mixed in with the rice and beans.  The rice was extremely undercooked, which is entirely unacceptable for a restaurant.  Our second dish was the jerk chicken, which was both soggy and greasy at the same time.  The flavours could have been there, but the food textures and portions were certainly not.  Unfortunately, this restaurant proved to be a huge waste of money for us and left us still hungry.  Perhaps if they cooked their food properly and provided more of it, we would have had a positive experience.  But that didn't happen, so we'll never go back."}
{"text":"I love coming here. We always walk down from the tattoo shop and we order a mass amount. They're always amazing to us!! Great patties."}
{"text":"Live close by and got inspired for some Caribbean food after a recent Anthony Bourdain episode! Staff was super nice and we ordered take out. Pros: fall-off-the-bone jerk chicken wings (spicy and yum!), goat roti had tons of flavor and was super fresh, but just wish there was a bit more goat, and fritter was also tasty and dense but could have been a bit more crispy. Cons: spicy fries were previously frozen and not only tasted that way, but weren't crispy at all.  We will go back to try a few other dishes for sure!"}
{"text":"We came here for lunch, and later in the week we had the whole family in for dinner. Place is great and food was the real deal. Jerk chicken, curry goat, oxtail, rice and peas were all spot on! Don't miss out"}
{"text":"Love the food, the people, the drinks and the vibe. Wonderful owners that make sure you are well taken care of. You won't leave un-happy just very full!"}
{"text":"The chicken roti is tasty and spicy. It may be too spicy for some, but it was just right for me. It was a very large satisfying portion. A smaller size one would be a nice option so that one could opt. to get some side dishes. The decor is bright and fresh and the service is friendly. I had requested some other menu items to take home and they were not available. I had looked at their menu options online before I left so was hoping to try some other things. They should aim to keep things available or just post them on the blackboard as they are available and focus on a smaller menu. I will for certain return to check out their lunch offerings. I would love to see them offer more combos and specials to keep me intrigued. I wish this new place well and hope they find their groove!"}
{"text":"Really stoked to finally have found an awesome Caribbean place in Calgary. Fay (Sorry if I spelled it wrong) was SUUUUPER friendly, the menu was what you'd expect to find, but with a few extra goodies that seem to be lacking in a lot of other shops in Calgary. Ordered the chicken roti and can honestly say it was one of, if not THE best I've had. Chicken was super tender, vegetables weren't at all too mushy, the curry was leaps and bounds ahead of the usual \"straight curry powder\" stuff you find at some other places. Definitely recommending this place to everyone.   If you're from Toronto by any chance, I think you'll feel a little nostalgic while munching here."}
{"text":"I love this place. It reminded me of Jamaica so much. The staff was friendly and gracious. The jerk chicken with rice and beans was flavourful and spicy. So glad we have a place like this in Calgary!"}
{"text":"Eating at Simply Irie is like having a home cooked Jamaican meal.  I enjoy the breadfruit and the curry goat.  My friend enjoyed the jerk chicken.    Simple Irie is more of a diner than a restaurant... nothing fancy... but I don't think I've ever been to a \"fancy\" Jamaican resaurant.  Real people.  Good food.  That's it."}
{"text":"There's always a risk in trying out a new establishment but it can be lots of fun. The best attitude to have is one of no expectations and that no matter what you are going to have a good time. Simply Irie occupies the space that the Chocolate Bar used to. It is on the corner of 14 St. &17 Ave SW.  I called and after chatting with the girl who answered she said that it was a good idea to make a reservation so I gave her my name, time & number in my party.  We arrived 15 minutes early and found that no reservation had been made and the only seats available were on bar stools along the window and so had to wait while the only server scrambled to put together a table that would seat 5. We ended up beside the kitchen, right under the TV. There are only about 8-10 tables, most of them 2 seater square tables and a counter along the window looking out on 17 Ave. Our table were 2 of the square tables put together. There is a private parking lot beside the building or street parking. The lady was most apologetic & a little upset that her colleague failed to make the reservation or warn her that we were coming but kept her cool & put together the table while still serving the customers. I had checked out photos of the menu items on their website and had more or less had in mind what I wanted to try. Goat curry is always on the top of my list when I see it on a menu. Alas they were out of it. I suggested we share a plate of jerk wings but alas they were out of that too. One of my companions wanted Shrimp Roti but they were out of that too. This was not a good start to ordering. We finally decided that we would each order something different and share: - Oxtail with rice and peas & vegetables - Chicken curry with rice and peas & vegetables - Beef roti - Snapper with rice and peas &vegetables - Ackee and salt fish with provisions Provisions are basically a selection of the staples of the Caribbean: bread fruit, dumplings, green bananas; these were really bland as they were basically boiled and meant to get all their flavour from the ackee and salt fish which was delicious. Ackee and salt fish was the only dish where we were offered provisions as the side. The rest of us had a choice of rice and peas or dumplings (I think, can't remember exactly but I do remember that provisions were only mentioned with the Ackee) Ackee and salt fish was creamy with lots of flavour, I would definitely order it as my main. Beef Roti was a huge packet of beef curry wrapped in a roti. The beef and potatoes that were part of the curry was not well distributed, there was huge chunks of beef on one side of the package and mostly potato on the other side. It covered most of the lunch plate it was served on. Chicken curry was basically chicken cooked with lots of curry powder. Both the beef and chicken curry were uninteresting. Unfortunately for the teenager who ordered the Beef Roti, it was much too spicy for him. I will warn you that it is probably at least a 4 out 5 chili pepper rating for most people. The snapper was nicely fried with subtle flavours. Oxtail too was nice, a bit on the sweet side. The oxtail is cooked until melt in your mouth tender and then chopped up so lots of bone fragments. Our server was very pleasant and friendly. The restaurant layout needs rethinking, there is a kitchen and hot table and display case of desserts in the front which took up most of the space of the restaurant but the chef had to keep going back and forth from the back kitchen where it seemed he did all the actual cooking. We were worried about an accident & having hot food thrown at us as the chef made his way back and forth from the front and back kitchen. The back kitchen had 3 steps leading up to it from the main restaurant area. Drinks were in a cooler, you picked what you wanted out of it. The sodas are even higher in sugar than the North American ones. The Solo sodas averaged over 40g of sugar for an 8-oz serving and the bottles were 20 oz each. They had malts, sodas and coconut water as well as a few other selections. Desserts were rum balls, carrot cake, and a type of coconut cake. Our meal portions were huge so we had no room for dessert. Prices ranged from $4.95 for a bully beef sandwich to $15.95 for oxtail.  Simply Irie has been open less than 2 months so I think they are still working things out as to what they need to have on hand. I definitely would recommend they get rid of the front kitchen seeing as the grills & stove take up a lot of room and don't seem to be in use. Good Caribbean food that I would certainly go back for, probably not the curry but ackee and salt fish, snapper and oxtail are recommended. 3-stars because of the mix up with reservations, number of menu items not available, and the TV was way too loud which affected the overall atmosphere but I would still go back to try some more food."}
{"text":"This place is Legit. Good quality Caribbean food, great atmosphere, good price. I have absolutely nothing negative to say about this place and it continues to be a weekly go to spot for me and my friends."}
{"text":"I have to say I've lived across the street for a while and decided to finally try this place. It's pretty expensive for starters. The food was not great and I have to say I won't be back."}
{"text":"Friend always spoke highly of this place and said we had to try it. Definitely a great little restaurant. Employees are super friendly and nice. Their service is given with a smile and politeness.  Food is spicy, but really good. Place is clean and looks taken care of. Nicely decorated.  Definitely recommend this restaurant. Hope they do well as you can see how much they try. Nice to see some good, friendly customer service."}
{"text":"Full, and satisfied.  This place is a great place that will serve your appetite in a quick and simple fashion.  I was full.  I was happy.  Atmosphere: The place is small, so do not come in here with a large crowd.  Simple decor, reggae music in the background, and a TV playing cartoons for the owners child.  Nothing spectacular about this place that stands out.    Food: I had ordered the curry goat with peas and rice.  The seasonings were strong, but not spicy, to help mask some of the strong goat flavours.  I do recommend the peas and rice, rather than the plain white rice, for extra flavour to your meal.  Quite good.  Cole slaw was also added to my plate, which was nice to have something fresh and cool.  Perhaps for people who can not handle so much spice?  I also picked off of my friend's plate for her oxtail.  So so tender.  So good.  Service:  It was pleasant, quick, and no extra sales language to push more products on us, which is what I really appreciate.  Our water glasses were constantly refilled.  Owner was friendly.    I'd come back again."}
{"text":"Perhaps I'm just getting persnickety in my dotage, but because several popular menu items turned out to be unavailable, we had to choose from second or in some cases third alternatives. Big letdown. That said, portion sizes were generous, the food was suitably spicy, and our server was certainly gracious, but I was still underwhelmed by the overall experience. They'll have to step up their game to entice me back. Sigh."}
{"text":"I've tried several things at Simply Irie but it took the last two visits to find the sweet spot and it's absolutely fantastic: It's the beef roti. I'd had goat and boneless chicken as well and some other things that I'm not recalling right now, but nothing that had really slayed me, and as others have noted, the prices are high relative to what you'd find for West Indian in, say, Toronto. All that said, the beef roti is worth the price- it's worth a drive across town. Perfectly spicy with a rich curry broth, ample tender beef and the most perfectly cooked potatoes in a nice tender roti shell. It's also massive, a fact that reduced the $15 price shock considerably."}
{"text":"No, not a good patty at all. No not tasty, the meat kind of tasteless and the pastry. I take that back, the filling was terribly salty. Not worth $1 let alone the $4 they charge."}
{"text":"I spontaneously dropped in for lunch today for the first time.  We had super friendly service and I enjoyed the atmosphere.  The patties were decent (tried the chicken, beef and goat), although I thought there would be more filling.  I did consider them a tad pricey.  We ordered spicy fries and holy burn your mouth, batman.  It could be that my spouse and I are just wimpy Canadians but this was the hottest food I've had in some time.  Almost too hot for me to fully enjoy.  My mouth burned for awhile after I finished eating too.  I will say that the basket of fries is massive though and needs to be shared.    I'm glad we tried this out but I don't know if I'd come running back.  If anything, I'd want to return to try the jerk burger."}
{"text":"Love it. This place is my go to, excellent jerk chicken plate.  It's a must try for locals looking for good food, and very clean. Great price. Thank you guys."}
{"text":"Great food. Service could be better, but best jerk chicken in town. Seasoning on point! Love doing take out from here and the portion sizes are huge! Great value and so tasty!!"}
{"text":"Best Jamaican restaurant ever. Their Jamaican patties are next level! And they're stewed chicken is amazingggg. We are coming back tomorrow before we leave town. Our new fave place in Calgs for sure."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch was thinking Ox tail or the safe bet with some jerk chicken, turns out they have a lunch special for the chicken for only $10 with rice, beans, and some veg so clearly my mind was made up.  Food was good, fast and service was super friendly.   also toped off lunch with some festival, also a great choice.   I will be returning soon"}
{"text":"Had to stop by this new place when I saw that it was Jamaican. The food is delicious, decent prices and the owners are friendly. Loved the Bob Marley concert that was playing on the tv. Looking forward to trying everything on the menu."}
