{"text":"Being a fan of Hawaiian poki as well as food trucks, I found this to be a refreshing change from the usual food truck fare. For this visit, I found the truck stationed at the food truck row at the annual Phoenix Chinese Week festival. I ordered the sushi burrito and found it to be really good with very fresh ingredients, and comparable in size and price to  that which would be served in a regular sushi or American-Japanese eatery. I look forward to seeing the truck again in future events so I can try their hand rolls and poki bowl."}
{"text":"I went to the Phoenix night market 4/21 and had a hot cheeto sushi burrito for the first time (different vendor). This Saturday at the FoodStock event in Peoria I had the opportunity to try PokeMaki's hot cheeto sushi burrito. What a difference! Pokemaki's was so much better in quality, taste and portion. The tuna was fresh and very generous quantity! it was also in a long strip not the finely chopped style some poke places serve their tuna. The rice was soft, and the hot cheetos were evey spread out throughout the entire roll. The little gentleman that took our order was very friendly and made the recommendation to try the spicy mayo for sauce option, because that is his favorite; well he has great taste! I cannot wait for their brick and mortar location to open up, even though I live all the way in South Mountain/Laveen, this place is definitely worth the drive. PS. The mango ice tea was also delicious, not overly sweet and could still taste the tea with mango notes."}
{"text":"I love poke so I had to stop here and get the poke bowl and I just gotta day it is one of the best I've ever had, all the ingredients were fresh and it just made it taste amazing. I'll defiantly be coming back to this food truck many times, it's really outstanding!"}
{"text":"Great service and good food. Very clean and well kept. Atmosphere was perfect for a quick bit or a sit down meal."}
{"text":"The best poke bowls around. I have been to at least 3 other poke spots and Poke Maki are the only ones who have sushi rice as a base, which makes a huge difference. We try  see them every week when they're at Luke AFB or any local events."}
{"text":"New favorite food truck! Super fresh ingredients and definitely different options than a lot of other food trucks out there. Super nice people running the truck... Tried their food for the first time at Food Truck Friday West last week. The salmon poke bowl was awesome and I loved their mango tea, too. My one and only complaint was that I added the Boba pearls to my mango tea for a $1 upcharge but the straw it was served with wasn't actually wide enough to drink the Boba pearls through. Easy fix though. Can't wait to try it again!"}
{"text":"So delicious and fresh very single time. There's something about their rice that sets them apart. Can't pinpoint what but it's yummy! Awesome and fast service as well"}
{"text":"Their poke bowl was great!  I had the tuna over the spring mix with the house sauce and \"the works\".  Everything was super fresh, and the flavors were all fantastic."}
