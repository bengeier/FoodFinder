{"text":"Our family enjoys coming here for birthdays, anniversaries and  Sunday night family dinners. The food is always good and the owners have come to know us because we come here so frequently!

This past Sunday we all piled into Emerald to celebrate my sister's birthday. We ordered the peking duck, fish maw soup, ginger beef, gai lan with beef and the house fried rice. 

The peking duck wraps are my favorite, there's always wraps left over once all the duck is gone (I guess it's better to have too many than not enough). Everything else we ordered comes out quick and freshly made. The fish maw soup is seasoned perfectly and doesn't lack seafood. Ginger beef is crisp and the sauce is great for drizzling on your rice and veggies.

They always bring out a sweet soup dessert after you meal, this time it was a taro and yam tapioca. My boyfriend had 3 helpings so you can judge how good it is :)

For all 6 of us to stuff ourselves with great food, it only cost us just under $100!"}
{"text":"The ambiance is great--spacious and decorative.  Everything in this restaurant makes it feel more authentic somehow.  I mean, besides all of the Asian people around.  On the left side of the restaurant spans a large mirror with pictures of their most popular dishes, and on the right side, you have numerous works of art you often see in the Chinese culture.

Onto the food!  I am terrible with food names since I am never the one who orders, so please refer to my pictures.  The dish with the orange sauce and mayo was fish.  There was a light crunch when you bit down, and the sauce was both tangy and sweet.  The redder dish was beef with bell peppers, onions, and pineapple.  There wasn't much of a difference between this dish and the fish, but I think the beef was tangier and possibly had ketchup in it.  The green veggie plate was delicious with a very, very light taste of garlic.

Service was good and attentive.  They refilled our teapot promptly, and they were easy to wave down when we ran out of rice.  The total was $43, including tax and tip.  Is Chinese restaurant food in Canada always this expensive?

P.S. It is open late until 12-1am (:"}
{"text":"Hey I like this place. The food is good and hey that's the whole point. I think that the delivery times are pretty good as well. I only give it 4 stars because I think the ginger beef could use some work but the rest is rad."}
{"text":"My friends and I frequent this restaurant quite a bit, usually on the week nights as its probably less busy than it is on the weekends and when it's not busy that means better service, faster food, etc.

I don't remember our waiters name but he always takes our order and he's super nice fella. 

As usual we started off with a two course which includes the sliced up Peking duck, cucumbers, onions and the wraps. There were four of us and basically you can have two pieces of duck in each wrap.

The thing I hate most about some places that serve Peking duck is that the wraps are so oily. I understand there will be some oil but not when it's soaking in oil - makes you not want to eat it anymore but at Emerald Palace it's an edible amount.

Next we got our duck soup which has bamboo, mushrooms, duck obviously and some other who-know-whats-it-called topped with a little red vinegar and pepper you got yourself a tasty soup!

We also got an order of ...well I think it was the salt and pepper crab.. Mmm! Seriously, although I hate eating crab/lobster cause it's just messy and I'm a bit of a diva crab meat is so delicious.

Finally we also ordered some green bean type dish which is a must because you always need a plate of vegetables just because they are good for you and taste pretty much awesome.

Ended up being about $25 per person x 4 people."}
{"text":"Overall it's acceptable, but not outstanding! This is our first try as we saw great reviews from Yelp, guess our standard a bit different. 
I'm not saying the food is bad or anything but humm just not up to my expectations!
Case in point, Crabmeat Sharks Fin Soup, I don't even want to talk about the price ( which is overpriced ) for what they gave us, it is definitely fake shark's fin and the crab meat is too dry even inside the soup!
The other two dishes where just normal, the stuff you get in a food court, anyways, I guess I'm asking to much but hey, we all have our standards or there will not be a Yelp!"}
{"text":"Today I tried to call for delivery becoz my roommate and I decided for an hour what to order than the lady answered and I asked for delivery order but the lady told me the restaurant is having a HUGE big party so the kitchen was unable to take any delivery or take-out order.  Sorry for any inconvenience.  Seriously this is my first time I ever heard of a restaurant that they can't do delivery or take-out WoW.. They think doing a Huge party will make enough profit or business for a day.  I will never call or eat at this place again.  They just lost a valuable customer which been we order a lot for long time."}
{"text":"Food 5/5 food here is always phenomenal . We come here as a family for birthdays and family celebrations. Food portions are large always plenty of food for everyone .

Service 5/5 being a Chinese restaurant most places don't have the best service but I've always had great service they are very attentive. 

Parking 5/5 the parking is huge it's in a very large strip mall. 

Environment 4/5 the place is ok. Could use a little bit more work on keeping everything clean and presentable. 

I would recommend this place if you are looking for great food at great prices ."}
