{"text":"Delicious shrimp and octopus cocktail!! Very authentic, great service, too pricey for beers though:("}
{"text":"We came to this restaurant because we wanted seafood and we have been to the same restaurant but in Corona, CA. It's only about 3 miles from downtown Las Vegas. The location is kind of secluded but the service and food were amazing. There were 9 of us, we were seated right away, and the waitress brought us chips and salsa which were great especially the red sauce. While we were looking at the menu, the chef came and told us the specials and went over some of the most popular menu items. While we waited for our food they brought us complementary tostadas de ceviche de pescado. They were delicious. The food came pretty quickly considering we were a large party. It was perfect. The shrimp empanadas were delicious. Overall super happy with this place I will definitely return the next time we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"Found 2 cockeroach on my food and they did not even give a discount for it. Paid $70 to get food with a side of roach. Nasty."}
{"text":"This is my go to mariscos spot in Las Vegas. The mariscos here are always fresh and tasty. The ambiance here is very welcoming. The cleanliness of the restaurant is on point. The owner Juan welcomed us and provided outstanding customer service. Were we given a complimentary dish of mejillones on the house. I really recommend the langostinos, they are delicious. Looking forward to returning to try the other items on the menu."}
