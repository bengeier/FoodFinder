{"text":"Went to The Duchess for karaoke tonight after not being there since the summer.  Great onion rings!  However, later on in the evening, I was absolutely shocked and disgusted by a rap song the karaoke host sang.....there weren't even words for this song on the monitor,,,the guy knew it by heart, singing along with another guy.   I am by no means a prude and I appreciate a good raunchy song, but this rap song went way beyond that.....it seemed to have \"Fuck\" in almost every sentence and he rapped about shoving his balls in someone's face, and what he was going to do to women which basically amounted to rape. The karaoke host and his side kick were jumping up on the furniture and pumping their fists in the air while they sang, like crazed lunatics, rapping all this filth.  To top that off, they both had dirty unkempt beards that made them look like Islamic terrorists.  Then later on, as we were leaving, one of the same guys was sitting with a girl outside, by the front door, smoking what clearly was not tobacco.  I have nothing against smoking weed but if you're going to smoke weed at your place of employment, don't be so obvious by doing it right in front of your employer's business where patrons come and go and can see and smell what you're smoking.  Not a classy move at all.  If the owner could see what was going on at his place of business tonight, I don't think he would be too happy.  I think from now on, I'll go elsewhere for karaoke."}
{"text":"Very friendly bar. Small and comfortable, with great food, amazing service, drink specials and karaoke 3 nights a week. Hidden in a plaza behind Little Mesa Cafe. The burgers are delicious. All you can eat fish on Fridays. Thursday nights, Nate hosts karaoke at 8:30. Josh hosts on Fridays and Saturdays starting at 9. Both are very good at what they do!"}
{"text":"The best kept Monday night burger secret in Mesa!  $5 1/3lb and $6 1/2lb burgers  Delicious!!  Tiny little bar tucked in a strip mall on Main 1/4 mile east of Val Vista  The snowbirds have this place hopping in the winter, so have a beer and enjoy the experience!"}
{"text":"I really like this bar. It's just a small place in a strip mall. It's right behind the little Mesa Cafe that's on Main Street. For a Class 6 liquor license bar that doesn't have to serve food, their food is really quite good. The the \"Huggy Burger\" is the first thing I tried there about 10 years ago oh, and they had me ever since. They have karaoke on Thursday Friday and Saturday, but I usually go on Thursdays cuz there's less of a crowd and I get to sing a little more. Cheap beer and good prices on the food. Fish fry on Fridays tasted really good. I don't know what is like in the day time. This place used to be a very popular place, but since no smoking laws and the very strict DUI laws now, fewer people seem to come out. I think food stops according to demand on karaoke nights. And I think online it says they close at midnight, but that also seems to be about demand also, since I've been there til 2am. Nice little hole in the wall. I would love to see an influx of new people to come in there. More people singing would be fun."}
{"text":"This bar itself is good but what makes this bar really great is the bartender Shelly and the karaoke host Josh-e rock. Shelly makes great drinks and always has a positive attitude. Josh puts on a karaoke show like you're actually at a concert and plays to the crowd that is at the bar."}
{"text":"So why do places have to be a hole in the wall! Why can't they be cleaner than they are; sticky dirty tables, dark so can't see the filth, food looks like everybody likes it but I wouldn't eat it cuz the cook was filthy looking. Guess I just care about my health more than most. Where are the health departments in Mesa?"}
{"text":"I went here looking for a drink and some wings, and I'm glad I'm picked this spot. Definitely going back to try more flavors. Highly recommend for wing nuts."}
{"text":"Open Sundays,  even though it says closed.  This is definitely a hole in the wall bar in the back of a strip mall but my dad swears they have the best burgers.  
Very small,  very dark interior,  but friendly staff and excellent food and cheap beer.  
I love a good bar especially the food. And dad was loving his burger. We will be back.  They have specials daily.  Nothing fancy,  just good food!"}
{"text":"A little hole in the wall place in retiree Mesa. Bullet holes in the shop window next door. Definitely a snow bird hot spot. My friend and I were the only ones there under 60. Nachos were good."}
{"text":"Went here for Karaoke on Saturday Night, to begin with this is a little hole in the wall bar full of regulars. When we walked in my first thought was this place could totally use a deep cleaning. The nextdoor venue had a event going on and the bass and noise was drowning out the karaoke in the bar. The Karaoke guy went over there and had them turn it down a bit but it still bled over pretty bad. The karaoke guy was awesome, the system was better then most and he had all the songs! That night we were starving and ready for some chow, so I asked if I can order some food. The bartender/ waitress told me to please take it easy because she was also the cook... So anything fried was my choices. I got chicken tenders and onion rings... She came out with a stack of each! I was shocked, our table shared the baskets and couldn't even finish them all, the food was basic bar fried food. The bartender was super sweet but definitely needed some help with at least the cooking portion. It was a good night, however be ready to see some people that are definitely over served... One dude was relentless at trying to hit on one of our friends, im sure that guy regretted drinking that much the next morning. Instead of cutting him off they just kept serving him, drinks, and shots... All in all it was a good time, try to avoid the drunk regulars by not making eye contact."}
