{"text":"Had O burger for lunch the other day and although I have had their burgers before and if I had left a review back then, I would've probably given them a 5 star, however I noticed that the quality of the burgers have gone down hill, I'm not sure if it's because of the longer line ups and they can't seem to keep up with the demand.  But my brother and I had the build your own burger with fries and a drink.  Although the fries were fresh, we both noticed that buns were stale as well as the burger patty looked like it was cooked a few hours prior.  

I really had high hopes for this burger joint and was hoping they keep fresh like when they first started serving burgers but unfortunately it didn't seem to have kept the same quality."}
{"text":"O burger doesnt look like much. In fact before investigating further, i thought the sign just said \"burger\". What they lack for in appearances they make up for in taste and value. I have tried two burgers so far. The Montreal is my favourite. Smoked meat on a burger is just a wonderful invention and there smoked meat is good enough that bacon might be stepping down as king of burger toppings. I like this place. You get a messy but manageable burger. Buns are super fresh and soft which is perfect for burgers and the patties are super tender. A bad burger i find is way too thick and chewy and I feel like they got it just right. Its not the healthiest of options although they do have a veggie burger. All in all I would say its a safe bet to stop in for a damn good burger. I also would recommend the smoked burger. I am sorry there is no photo, I was hungry and it was tasty and now i need to go lay down."}
{"text":"O Burger recently opened on the +15 level of the Bow, in their quasi-food court. Their service is pretty good and food is reasonably priced. I wish they had some more \"normal\" speciality burgers. They have some pretty weird combinations I am not enticed at all to try. But their standard burger was pretty good, and their fries were excellent."}
