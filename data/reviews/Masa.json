{"text":"Great sushi for a fair price. Service was very good and the restaurant seems to be family owned. Sushi specials were a nice surprise. Quality of the fish was very good. We'll be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Service was great and the lady there was really nice. Not too satisfied with the food there tho. Ordered ramen and later found out it was actually just instant noodle with a hard boiled egg. Even I could do better than that plz get a new chef that actually cooks Japanese food. Won't recommend it."}
{"text":"It's actually very good fast service. I like it for pickup but you can get a great meal for a very good price!"}
{"text":"Although the food is really good with very reasonable prices, I'm not sure why we keep going. The older grey haired man that works there is about the rudest person I've seen in the restaurant business. Very disrespectful, it's like he's doing us a favor by being there."}
{"text":"While I am not a sushi expert, my girlfriend is and she loves this place. It is one of the few restaurants that she will go to more than three times. The servers are great as is the food. They have a ginger fried chicken as a free item if you get over $50.00 worth of food and it is the best I have ever had. The prices are very reasonable and cheaper than most. The size of the pieces is also larger than a lot of spots we have been at.  Highly recommended if you are on the west end of town."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today. My order was to go and must say that this is the best sushi joint in the SW....and only a 2 min drive from my house. BONUS!  You can tell right away whether the sushi ingredients are fresh or not. This place was. As long as they are consistent, I will keep going back."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch on a weekend back in April.  The place was quiet since there were not that many occupied tables in the restaurant.  It is a welcomed addition to the area as there really are not that many sushi joints in the area.   The sushi was acceptable but no where near the best I have experienced.   However, the servers were attentive and accommodating.  The decor was modern and effective.  Overall I give it a 3 to 3.5/5 stars."}
{"text":"I've tried so many different sushi place. And this place is honestly some of the fresher sushi I've had before from anywhere. The only problem and the reason it got 4 stars instead of 5 is the price. It's a good bit more expensive than most sushi places out there.   But you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Overall pretty good. Clean. Food comes with food quality unlike some places which gives super small rolls. Price is fair. Good lunch discount and freebie. Would likely come back if in the area again."}
{"text":"We tried this place out about a week ago and we were pleasantly surprised. The sushi is decent and the prices are reasonable. The ingredients were quite fresh. The restaurant itself is clean and the staff were super friendly & attentive. We will be returning in the future & will try some new rolls!"}
