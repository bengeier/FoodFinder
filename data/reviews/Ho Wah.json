{"text":"Just your average Chinese takeout, nothing too special that stands out about this place. I kind of enjoy how tacky the taste in decoration is. I have a lot of food allergies so I avoid a lot of your typical dishes. Even though I've mixed it up entree wise, I still don't feel like I'm satisfied completely. The amazing service I receive: wether it's take out or dine in. Maybe that's why I continue to come back, ok food phenomenal service."}
{"text":"Been here a few times.  Service was forgetful but very pleasant .  Food was just a bit better than the typical shitty take out.  Egg rolls were very good.  Prices a little high."}
{"text":"Service was fantastic, interior was very nice, and the food was ready in no time at all! I absolutely loved the pot stickers and honey almond chicken (I don't even like almonds!) I highly recommend this venue for a rather inexpensive, delicious meal for any dinner occasion."}
{"text":"There is a plaque inside Ho Wah that states that the restaurant was voted Beachwood's best Chinese restaurant in 1999.  This is interesting because unless you count the Asian place in the Beachwood Place food court, Ho Wah was Beachwood's ONLY Chinese restaurant in 1999."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food I've had since I've been in the metro Cleveland area. The staff was friendly and attentive. I never saw the bottom my my glass. I recommend the Sesame Chicken. This place is a far cry from another Chinese restaurant in the area we had to walk out of because the host was coughing crap up, he may have had an incurable case of SARS."}
{"text":"First time we decided to get food here, First thing we had to eat was the wonton soup that had NO flavor. Next we had the best Crab Rangoon we ever had. Finally the main course orange chicken was terrible, it was hard to eat and we had to put more then half in the garbage.....will not eat the EVER again!! Only reason it got one star was because of the Crab Ragoons."}
{"text":"Consistently delicious with curt but courteous service in an otherwise desolate wasteland of restaurants. Lots of excellent vegetarian options, to boot."}
{"text":"It is an okay restaurant with Tiger waitress. I think I dont have a taste for authentic chinese food or may be they did not do a very good job in making it palatable for the american taste buds."}
{"text":"I can't understand these low ratings others are giving. Ho Wah is my favorite chinese restaurant. I now live in the Chicago area and I still crave Wor Sue Gai and the egg drop soup withe the shrimp chips. Love it!! I lived on the west side but still drove out to Beachwood when I had a craving or had a rough day at work. The waitresses knew me on sight and some even knew my order before it came across my lips. Between the food, which was consistently good, and the people, I count Ho Wah among my top 10 restaurant experiences and I will go back every chance I get."}
{"text":"Service is poor but food is great. Wor Dip Har (butterfly shrimp), the gauge by which I judge Chinese restaurants, is a tad better than average.  No Dim Sum.  Portions are better than skimpy, but not overly generous.  Prices are slightly above average making value dubious."}
{"text":"I've had better.    Heads up, no General Tso's on the menu either."}
{"text":"I went here with my Jewish BFF on Christmas night.  Understandably, it was quite crazy.  As my BFF said, \"Aside from the wait staff, you're the only non-Jewish person in here.\"  I was underwhelmed.  We each got soup (she, hot & sour, me, wonton).  Tasty, but kind of bland.  The crab rangoon had minimal crab.  The crab rangoon half the price at my local take out joint have double the amount.  I then had Mu-Shu chicken and she had the Governor's chicken.  I wasn't a huge fan of mine.  She was okay with her dish.  For the price, I would have preferred my local takeout place and saved a bundle."}
{"text":"We have dined here and done takeout for years. We've never had a bad meal. The egg foo young, Singapore noodles, Shrimp with Lobster Sauce, and beef lo mein are favorites.  Their egg drop soup is tasty, not oily, and the fried shrimp appetizer is always crisp and flavorful.  Great egg rolls, too.  The staff is always friendly and efficient.  It's safe to say that we are regulars."}
{"text":"My family has been going here for years. We all love it. I've had a variety of things from the menu and my favorite is the szechwan string beans. It's not exciting food, but it's good and I always leave with enough leftovers to make a second meal."}
{"text":"Good lord, if I could give this place no stars I would.  The \"Chinese food\" (I am using both the terms Chinese and food very liberally) is bland and almost tasted a touch rancid.  I tried the wonton soup which was basically water with a thick slab of flour and a piece of overcooked unidentifiable meat inside.  My friends ordered the Pad Thai... I think thats Thai food but what do I know being Chinese and all."}
{"text":"ANYONE WITH AN MSG REACTION BEWARE!!!!!!  My family was very excited to try this restaurant.  My Mom had been there with a friend before.  We immediately told the waitress no MSG because my son and I are allergic to it,  the waitress said there would be none. We also told her we were vegan.  I reminded her twice about MSG.  The waitress was a bit rude and acted snarky when discussing the menu. Our food came everything seemed okay.  My moms food she said tasted bad, she ordered egg fu young.  During our meal I heard the table next to us arguing about MSG with a waiter or manager and they were not happy.  Of course when I was done eating I began to get a a reaction.  My face was turning red, feet swelling and extremely hot.  I went to the manager and told him that there was MSG put in my food.  He said go to the hospital then.  I said if I come back to this restaurant again will there be MSG in my food because I would like to come back.  I told him I am having a reaction very bad.  He didn't try to fix anything or talk to the waitress. Acted like I was an ass and told me again to just go to the hospital  like I was faking things. He explained that MSG is added after the plate is made.  Which it obviously was added to mine which I was trying to tell him.  I told him the waitress was told when we had arrived about MSG reaction.  He didn't come talk to our table or try to take our food off the check. Nothing. I didn't even mention there was egg shells in my food or pieces of pork. My son started having the same MSG reaction when we left.  This is a dangerous place.  They don't care about customers here.  I would not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"They have the best Egg Rolls in town. The Wonton Soup is also really good and don't let me forget kung pao chicken"}
{"text":"I always seem to go back to Ho Wah once a year that I have lived in Cleveland, most recently with my wife and mother-in-law. If Ho Wah could ever improve their service and drop their prices a couple bucks per entr√©e they would stand a very good chance at a 4 star review, because their food can be really good.  In particular, I think their Mu-shu pork or chicken is very good and so is the Mongolian beef.  The food always tastes freshly made and hot, but a lot of the dishes all taste the same, like they are made with the exact same sauces, or at least the same base.  Really hard to enjoy/differentiate a Kung Pow, Cashew or hunan chicken that all taste the same except for one does not have nuts in it.  Parking is plentiful at La-Place and when you want dessert... face it you are always hungry 30 minutes after you eat Chinese. You can head right up the escalator to Mitchell's Ice Cream."}
{"text":"Meh. This the is BF's family's regular Chinese spot, but I didn't feel the love. I guess you can't love Cleveland's Chinese when you're used to SF's. I found the food to be extremely saucy and I'm gonna have to agree with the other reviewers that it was bland. The sezchuan chicken didn't have any heat to it. Ho Wah did have 2 redeeming factors, I liked  the wanton soup and the service was fast."}
{"text":"Not bad. Prompt service. Ordered wonton soup and moo shu chicken both of which were acceptable.  Not super authentic tasting but I didn't find the dish to be drenched in oil which can be a problem at some Chinese restaurants. The entrees are a little overpriced but I guess the large portions do compensate. I wouldn't rave about this place, but it's certainly not a bad option for Chinese food in the area. I plan on eating here again."}
{"text":"This is right up there with China Gate. A dine in or carry out restaurant that has delicious food. Amazing won ton soup, egg rolls, non greasy fried rice and delicious fresh food. Anything you get here will be amazing!"}
{"text":"Delicious! I have been coming here for years! I love everything here! Never disappointed!"}
{"text":"The food is good. My favorite dish is the beef fried rice. The atmosphere is very classy and intimate."}
{"text":"Very nice people/service.  Food quality is very poor.  I won't be back...very Americanized."}
{"text":"Fried rice they brought us was simply spoiled, caused 2 day diarrhea but nothing serious."}
{"text":"Took the family  there because it has  better decor inside than others in the area. But what a sad example of Chinese food. I was the only Asian customer there as my wife is white. The Chinese  wait staff just stared at  me and wondered why an Asian person would want to eat there.   Well, the food is so Americanized that it may as well serve pizza or burgers, cause every dish has the mystery brown sauce like cheap tomato  paste on pizza and mystery  ground meat in a burger. The only redeeming factors are good service  and not the stereotypical looking cheap Chinese glorified takeout join.   Now that there is a great and authentic Chinese  restaurant  (Sezchuan Cafe) at Asia Town, I will not be coming back!"}
{"text":"I liked the Chinese food here. Not being Chinese, I don't have a feel for authenticity, and I'm sure it's mostly Americanized. I had the sesame chicken, which has a nice thick breading and a sweet sauce, and my friend had the pad thai, which was very good. One oddity is that all the meat has a very strong taste. The chicken is very chicken-y and the shrimp has a very strong taste when normally shrimp is pretty mild. Overall it I would probably go back.   It is rather disturbing (the review below) which mentions their unwillingness to participate in a fundraiser, but I would wonder if that wasn't more a Beachwood attitude than particular to this place."}
{"text":"The food is delicious, fast and plenty. Not sure why such low ratings. The service was great and it's even family friendly."}
{"text":"Quick and fast food. Food was average. Pricey for take out. Pot stickers spongy per hubby."}
{"text":"This is great Chinese food. The pot stickers are excellent, the service is excellent. What's not to love? Our favorite East side Asian place. I"}
{"text":"My wife ordered a Lo Mein dish and they served her Ramen noodles. Frankly it was insulting. Never again."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant about 3,4 times this year and I can't even name a dish to try. The food was decent, but it wasn't authentic and not a restaurant I'd think to recommend to my friends.  If you are just looking for a typical chinese restaurant or a semi-fast bite to eat restaurant or just reallyy craving chinese restaurant, then this is the place to me. But if you're visiting and craving authentic chinese food, you probably don't want to end up her.  PROs: cheap, good service, friendly staff, food comes out quick  CONs: not authentic food"}
{"text":"Had friends tell me this place was the best!!! We ordered take out. Now to me general tso's chicken is a staple food, but it was average, it really didn't have flavor or season to me. And to get Carry and pay over thirty dollars, not worth it. This was my first time and maybe I'll try again one day, but first impressions are everything. Maybe I'll try something different"}
{"text":"Definite Meh. If you like under seasoned,overly thick sauces, and bland soups, this place is for you. Its what Chinese food was like 20-30 years ago, you know served with metal lids. The egg rolls are pretty good!  The portions are decent, but a little overpriced compared to my favs! The service is pretty efficient. This place has been here since the beginning of my time! It kind of has a cult following definitely an Orange, Pepper Pike, and Beachwood crowd."}
{"text":"I try to give honest ratings on here and I do not like to give ratings lower than a three, but I have to report we were not impressed at all.  General Tso chicken should be spicy and the chicken should be done at least a little crispy.  We ordered lunch, and according to their website, where we got the number to call, was WAY off on pricing.  3 General Tso lunch specials and 3 bowls of wanton soup should have been $25 according to the website.  The price we were given was $37.  We asked why such a difference, they had no clue even though we said the website was different.  We were still charged the $37.   When we went and picked up the take out and returned to work to eat in the break room.  We opened the containers and I was surprised to find two dried out scoops of rice and some battered pieces of chicken and about 5 pieces of broccoli in a brown sauce.  The chicken was soggy and the sauce lacked flavor and NO heat.  The wanton soup was like chicken flavored water with no flavor.  The wanton's were good, but thats it.  VERY blan.   Would we go back:  Probably not. Would we recommend:  Probably not  Looking through the other posts this seems to be the norm... Jeff B in 2011 reported the same thing.  \"Definite Meh. If you like under seasoned,overly thick sauces, and bland soups, this place is for you\""}
{"text":"Mediocre food consistently.  Why is this place so popular?  Maybe it is the location and a dearth of other Chinese restaurants in the area.  If you are willing to drive to Coventry or Chagrin Falls, you will get much better food.  Ever since it opened many years ago, this place has been very busy, especially on Sunday."}
{"text":"Basic Americanized bland Chinese Food. Tastes like P.F. Chang's Frozen Entrees from Target.   Service is good. Portions are large. No shrimp egg rolls!!!!!  If you want more taste for your $, drive a little further to Hunan of Solon or if you want real Chinese, drive to the Siam Cafe."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Best Hunan Shrimp I have ever had. My wife had Sesame Chicken and she lived it. Great egg rolls too!"}
{"text":"Yick. Thick sauce, dry rice, mushy veggies. Head to Hunan Solon.  It's MUCH better!"}
{"text":"Service was great but the food me and my companion ordered was very salty and unappetizing. I was very disappointed and won't be back anytime soon, save your money and go to another place for Chinese food."}
{"text":"Is this the greatest Chinese restaurant?  No.  But is the food good?  Yes.  As other reviewers have said, there's nothing fancy about Ho Wah, and it's in a strange location within La Place.  I've eaten in quite a few times, but I normally just get take out to avoid the sea-foamy-ness of the decor.  When you place a take out order, it's made quickly and tastes fresh.  I like to get the vegetable chow mein and a vegetable egg roll.  Both items are better than what I've had at other local Chinese restaurants.  If you're looking for some quick take out, I think this is a great place to go.  If you want fancy and authentic, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Went for X-mas even and the food made good left over but nothing to write home about. Also they had a whole list of food items they ran out of."}
{"text":"Perhaps the biggest downside to this restaurant is that it has the misfortune of being in Beachwood, but that is another issue altogether. That aside, I found it a more than adequate spot to satisfy a craving.  I normally ordered take-out, but dined-in a few times as well. Service was above-average...attentive but not overly friendly. Still, food would arrive quickly and extras (hot oil, etc.) were given promptly. Given its location one can't complain too much about its Americanized menu, but beyond that the dishes were rather good. Dishes available are very \"typical\" to a Chinese food veteran, but at least what they have was done well. I could never seem to get the food spicy enough to my liking, but that is a frequent complaint no matter where I go. It would be unfair to compare it to a place in San Francisco or New York, so I won't even bother. Compared to other local establishments, the food was more than decent, as other places in the area ranged from overly greasy to downright nasty. Ho Wah presented itself in a clean, modern manner, and did not pander with obnoxious kitsch.  It would be hard to suggest making a special trip to visit, but if you are a local and have a craving for egg rolls and Singapore noodles, you could do much, much worse and not likely do much better."}
{"text":"I'm going to have to disagree with some of these lower rated reviews.  Ho Wah is very good, freshly prepared Chinese food.  Its a good break from the crappy \"China One's\" of the world that operate a crappy lunch buffet for cheap.  This is a giant step up from that - Its been in business for 30 due to consistent quality, attentive management, and cleanliness.  Just try the orange chicken!"}
{"text":"Although I live close to this restaurant, I have never went into this restaurant. I finally gave in the other weekend and my bf and I went in to try this restaurant.  It's the fact that it's an Americanized Chinese restaurant. I always walk by here on my way to caribou or Mitchells, but.... meh.  The decor is nice. The tables are nice as well. We ordered the orange chicken and the honey walnut shrimp. Oh man- both of them came out overly fried- so much breading. Way too much breading. After two bites, I was already full.  The waitstaff, on the other hand, were definitely very attentive. If you want fast food Chinese food, this is the place to go. If you want authentic, definitely not your place."}
{"text":"I used to go here once a week for pad thai. Last time I went for lunch and the pad thai was so bad I couldn't eat it. Lunch cooks are ruining it. Service was horrible too. Here's a clue- if a customer leaves without eating more than one bite and doesn't take it to go- then there is a problem."}
{"text":"Ho Wah has been the Chinese restaurant spot on the Eastside for many years. Food and service has always played a major role in this. Always consistent and fast. On Christmas Day you would think Lebron James showed up (it gets that busy). Wonton soup is outstanding as well as the egg rolls. Pot Stickers are another great try. I highly recommend the special fried rice with any chicken or beef dish. It's all good, baby! Love this spot."}
