(Edit) ..but didn't seem so fresh on a recent visit  :(. Taking one star off."}
{"text":"MIKADO is NOW CLOSED!

This venerable old place was one of the most authentic sushi restaurants in all of Canada with an owner who was a true master sushi chef.

With his retirement in June, none of his family or staff wanted to take it over so it is now closed and a sign in the window says \"Restaurant for Lease\".

Goodbye old friend, I will never forget your Fatty Tuna.  My taste buds already miss you."}
{"text":"If you are truly interested in authentic Japanese food in the Toronto area, this is the place. This restaurant is Japanese owned, and not an all you can eat disaster area like so many of Toronto's sushi bars.

Sushi here is absolutely first rate, especially if you have Masuda-san, the owner and chef, choose the sushi selection for you (in Japanese, it is called omakase)

The diner's secret here however, is that it makes and extraordinary Japanese curry, as the the staff was trained in the art of fusion cooking. The tempura is also outstanding, as is the Horenso Goma, which is boiled spinach with sesame sauce.

The decor is exactly what you'd see if you were in a great Japanese restaurant that has been there for ages.

The Creme Caramel flan for desert is dynamite."}
{"text":"I went in on the June 14th 2013 for a lunch which did not disappoint and ended up spending 2.5 hours enjoying the food, atmosphere and the company of my friend but to my dismay I discovered the chef and owner is retiring.  June 16th was the last day for this great spot."}
{"text":"Just had a GREAT lunch at Mikado.

It was my second time there. When I ordered my lunch, the waitress asked me if I like wasabi on my sushi. Something I haven't been asked at a Japanese restaurant since I was a kid, when Japanese restaurants were a more authentic delicacy. It was my first clue that this would be a good lunch.

While waiting for my food, I peered over to the hand-written a-la-carte sushi menu on a whiteboard by the sushi bar. I saw things like Spanish Mackerel, Sea Eel, Abalone, Tuna Belly and King Crab. A very long, impressive selection.

Had the Tempura Appetizer ($8.95) - great, a creative variety of vegetables and two wonderful shrimp. Shrimp were a bit less long than some other places, but were also more plump and perfectly cooked. Will definitely order this again.

From their lunch menu, I picked sushi set A, the largest and most expensive ($18.95). It came with 3 cucumber rolls, 3 tuna rolls, and 8 pieces of nigiri. Every piece was delicious and special - no filler here. The fish was noticeably fresh and the pieces were surprisingly large. Even the Kani (crab) and Tamago (egg), which I usually don't like, were great!

Some of the best-tasting sushi I've had in this city. Much better than Sushi On Bloor and New Generation, which have great single items (salmon, butterfish) and are very cheap, but lack overall consistency. This sushi was special. You could tell that it was authentic Japanese-made sushi, unlike the Cantonese-run establishments named above.

So, the difference is that you're paying a bit more and getting a far better product. The eel was grilled to order, the salmon was topped with dust-fine lemon zest, the tuna was impossibly fresh and creamy, the cucumber was cut impeccably small... 

The other time I went there, it was for dinner and I ordered Amaebi (sweet shrimp), my favorite piece of sushi, a-la-carte and to my surprise, the double-shrimp arrived with the heads still attached. It was the single best-tasting Amaebi that I've ever had.

I could go on and on.
If you like Japanese food, and it's not too annoying for you to get there (#56 Bus from Donlands or Eglinton stations), you should really try this place! And they have parking in the back.
It's a great way to have special, authentic sushi (think Sushi Marche, or even Ame), at a much more reasonable price.

Be sure to check the operating hours before getting too hungry, and call ahead during peak hours to make a reservation. If you're going with friends, ask for one of the private tatami rooms. 

Oh, and they have a menu on their website!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend trains at the Franco-Behring jiu jitsu academy around the corner, so I stopped by to order some take-out before picking him up.

I literally dropped in 15 minutes before they closed, and I didn't feel rushed at all. The hostess was extremely gracious and offered me free miso soup and green tea. Beautiful, warm atmosphere inside. Many Japanese restaurants now seem to be Chinese- or Korean-owned, but this one seemed authentic. 

I ordered the spicy salmon and dynamite rolls and we both agreed that they were delicious.  The only downside was that the seaweed was slightly chewy.  Otherwise, great hospitality and fantastic food.  Would definitely return again."}
{"text":"Mikado! You sushi so good but you so expensive!

After a friend told me he's had best sushi in Toronto, I just had to give this place a try.  I called in a made a reservation.  When I finally got there, I was shocked how small the parking lot is; located in the back through the alley way.  It's a very small restaurant but luckily the place was not packed.

After being seated, I pulled out a list of sashimi item that my friend had wrote down for me.  It did not take long for the seafood to be served and even quicker for them to disappear.  One thing that stood out for me was when the waitress collected the sweet shrimps' head, deep fried it and served it as another dish.  It was disgusting but at the same time so friggin' awesome!

Warning: don't drive into the back unless you're a super skilled driver with a small car or else you will get stuck lol

Cheers."}
{"text":"2nd takeout; first time may of 2011

Food quality good, prices reasonable

Favorite twist on traditional sushi is smoked salmon covered in onions and capers"}
{"text":"The fish was fresh fresh fresh! I think they just fished it out of the ocean today. If you are there for a party, be forewarned that you may not get all your food at once especially if you all order sushi as there is one sushi chef. But at least you don't have to worry about your food going cold. And the cuts are amazingly artistic.  This is one restaurant that truly takes the art of presentation seriously.  

The miso soup was a really nice touch with enoki mushrooms instead of nori. It was much tastier."}
{"text":"This is what sushi should be.  Fresh fish, unassuming, no frills - just kickass sushi.

This place has been around since 1978, and it looks like it.  If you're looking for atmosphere, go somewhere else.  If you want good traditional Japanese - there is nothing more old school than this - although Chef Masuda seems to have added a couple of California-inspired items to the menu.  If Hattori Hanzo ran a sushi joint in Toronto, this would be it.  (Never asked him for Japanese steel, but am still very curious about the Karate awards hanging on the wall in kanji that I can barely make out).  Seriously - Chef Masuda has been slicing tasty morsels of fish before most of the Queen/Bloor Street sushi chefs were born - really gotta wonder if the only people in Toronto eating raw fish when Mikado first opened, were only on National Geographic specials.

Anyhow - stick with the traditional stuff, go a la carte if you can afford it, otherwise, get sushi and sashimi combos - can't go wrong.

I only wish this place was cheaper and/or the portions were a bit bigger.  But that's like saying you wish they serve 24oz filet mignons at your favorite steakhouse, without having to buy 3 x 8oz ones.

Go and try it.  Thank me later."}
{"text":"I've been living abroad for many years but I never forgot this restaurant. I came here before I understood how to eat sushi properly, and didn't know too much about Japanese culture. But I was amazed at how the chef tried to explain the basics to all the patrons - and I think that he even had some instructions printed lol. 

He was gracious, polite, and engaging. But he still fought for the best culinary experience for those visiting his establishment.

Their Japanese food and sushi was my favorite while I lived in TO. Extremely fresh and well prepared. 

It's also very romantic inside their cute Tatami rooms, and this is just one of those perfect places to escape from it all...

Masuda-san is a true Taisho. I wish him much luck and success! And hope to stop by again when I am next back home..."}
{"text":"One of the best sushi restaurants in TO. The place looks pokey from outside, but do not be deceived, their food is superb.
It is one of the freshest and high quality sushi we have tried.
I would also recommend nasumiso (eggplant), smoked salmon (home made in the little smoke box at the back of the restaurant with imported cherry wood), and of course any of the noodle bowls ( perfect one dish meal on the cold winter day).
They also make their own soya sauce which is very lite and silky.
If you order sweet shrimp sashimi, they will deep fried left over heads and bring them back as a little crunchy treat. They also serve Japanese pickles - make sure to try pickled plums.
Overall experience: umami!"}
{"text":"Recommended by a Japanese friend, I had diner at Mikado with another Japanese friend who said it reminded her of being back home :D

The outside of the restaurant is very small size, there's a one-lane driveway leading to the humble parking lot tucked away in the back. The decor is very traditional Japanese. We were seated in the back section of the restaurant, where they have a Zashiki large enough to fit 4 small groups (2-5 persons to each 'room'). Though the room was full, ambient noise was quiet and the table dividers allowed for privacy.

We ordered ala carte items as there were specific things we wanted to try.

Crab Croquettes - golden fried to perfection tempura battered and filled with a crab and cream mixture - amazing

Nigiris:

Toro (Fatty Tuna) - soft, melt in your mouth - amazing. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it!

Hamachi - amazing

Unagi - amazing

Smoked Salmon a & Onion - Amazing - the smokey flavour of the salmon just filled my mouth with delicousness.

Rolls:

Spicy King Crab - amazing - crab was sweet and nicely portioned

Toro and Green Onion - amazing

Recommended if you want to take a date here who really appreciates good Sushi. With drinks and tip it worked out to approx. $50/person which to me is very reasonable for the quality of the food, and amazing service."}
{"text":"Had lunch here for the first time; really enjoyed it.  As is true of any sushi restaurant, I wish I could order sushi that wouldn't come with egg (tamago) and pressed-fish-\"crab\", but both the Sushi (Sushi A) and Sashimi (Sashimi [L]) were delicious and included a few more unusual elements.  Too many sushi restaurants deliver plates filled almost entirely with salmon and tuna.

There was a citrus fluke sushi that I really liked, a partially-cooked shrimp that was unusual, some shiso leaf, generally a nice change from the increasingly homogenous sushi restaurants.

It's a little pricier than some, but easily worth it.  Looking forward to trying it again, and curious to see if they'll do Omakase."}
{"text":"Japanese owned restaurant since 1972!  

I first came here for lunch a few weeks ago and was amazed by their bent? and knew I had to come back for the full experience. 

So this time my wife and I had the soft shell crab, miso, house salad and the Maka (16 piece sushi dinner).  Home made soy sauce along with a amuse-bouche were fantastic extra touches.  

While their prices are a bit higher than some, I believe what you're receiving back is well worth it.  The food quality and preparation are amazing at this deceivingly small restaurant.

The owner/chef, Mr. Masuda and staff are incredibly nice, making the experience that much more pleasant.

Any time I'm out and about and looking for Japanese this is where I'm going!"}
{"text":"Keiji makes the best saba sushi in Toronto. Who knew a little touch of shiso can add so much dimension to the sab flavouring. I definitely recommend you to reserve for the sushi bar seating, so Keiji can serve you whatever he thinks are the best sushi for the day."}
{"text":"Best Japanese restaurant in Toronto! The menu is authentic (you're not going to find any rolls with cream cheese here[1]), and everything is made with the greatest attention paid to quality. The fish is super-fresh, and the non-sushi items are just as excellent. Even the plating of each dish is beautiful, decorated with artfully carved vegetables and other pretty touches. As for dessert, try the Mikado Pie -- it has the lightness and airiness that reminded me of the desserts I've eaten in Japan. Plus, the owner and his wife are super hospitable and make me feel very welcome in their restaurant! 

Yes, a dinner at Mikado pricier than other places, but it's worth every penny for the quality and authenticity. 

[1] However, for such an authentic place they serve California Roll, which is practically non-existent in Japan. Kinda weird, but I guess they have to cater to the North American palate..."}
{"text":"Last night my husband and I went on a dining adventure. Typically, when we eat sushi we order-in from a few different local places. But last night we decided to visit Mikado, a long-standing neighbourhood favourite that came highly recommended. 

We walked in to this small, quiet restaurant and were instantly transformed. Led to the back room, it was suggested that we take off our boots before climbing into our booth (literally climbing in). There were pairs of slippers under the table to keep our toes warm. 

Mikado has been serving the Leaside neighbourhood since 1978 and it's no wonder why....

The sushi, sashimi and special rolls were all incredibly fresh and filled with amazing flavours. The edamame was melt-in-your-mouth good and salted to perfection and the lightly battered tempura veggies were delicious. 

The service was impeccable (despite a slight language barrier) and the owner visited our table to ensure our experience was a positive one. 

For anyone in the area, I'd certainly recommend Mikado."}
{"text":"Mikado easily ranks in the top 5 best sushi restaurants in the GTA, despite it's out-of-the-way location (parking at the back through a narrow alley). However, if you're looking for kooky and creative sushi rolls, this isn't exactly the right spot-- Mikado is about sushi in it's purest sense, as you'll come to appreciate after skimming the \"sushi etiquette\" pamphlet at the back of your menu. 
So what exactly does that mean? First off, no extra sauces on top of your rolls or shock value ingredients like pineapple or bacon-- just simple, straight forward and tremendously well made sushi. Even though I'm a lover of the 'crazy rolls' myself, I definitely didn't miss anything while enjoying the purist fare with the delicious house-made soy sauce.
In sum, Mikado is a must-visit spot for any Toronto sushi connoisseur and a good take off point for newbies looking to try more 'authentic' sushi without breaking the bank."}
{"text":"I have been eating at this place ever since I can remember!
It is one of the few Japanese restaurants in Toronto run by an actual Japanese person [Mr. Masuda]. For a true Japanese experience, eat here. 

You can sit at a western style table or at a Japanese style table on tatami. Wherever you sit, you will hear Enka in the background, which will remind you of Izakayas in Japan. It is perhaps on the \"pricier\" side; however, the seafood is fresh [and safe to eat], which justifies the prices. If you're not a sushi and/or seafood person, there are sets you can order. My personal favorite is the Kobe Dinner, which comes with: salad, miso soup, tempura, kobe steak, and rice. For dessert, try the Black Sessame Ice Cream or the Mikado Pie. Both are delicious and hard to come by.

On weekends, tables and parking are limited so make sure to have a reservation. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Best \"REAL\" Japanese restaurant in the city.  Hands down

Authentic sushi made properly.  Amazing fish, and the meals are to die for.

It is more expensive than your average Japanese restaurant and your terrible all you can eat places.

The sushi sets are perfectly balanced.  Wow

2 Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Another hidden Toronto gem.  Why don't more people know about this place!  Well, the main reason is that it's just about in the middle of nowhere.  I never would have found it if my parents didn't live a few minutes away.

I'm no Sushi expert but this is the best I've had so far.  After around 5 meals here, I haven't been disappointed with on piece of sushi.  Everything is fresh, tender and perfectly prepared.

Ask for a table in the back where you take off your shoes and eat in traditional Japanese style."}
{"text":"Took a Japanese friend here for sushi. She said it reminded her of home. Excellent food and service."}
{"text":"Discovered this place today and picked up some sushi as take out. The place is run by a couple of super nice japanese folks and i think they have been there for many years. I consider myself pretty picky when it comes to sushi. this place was great!!! Very fresh and tasty sushi.. The place looked a bit worn down, but service was excellent and i loved the positive energy there. Also ordered some soft shell appetizer. Was prepared differently thsn i normally have tried it, was probably very good but i just didnt like it that much. Everything else was absolutely great."}
{"text":"Mikado Japanese Restaurant is nice and homey.... 

Stepping inside takes me back in time and across the oceans, feels like I am in a small restaurant in a small Japanese village 30 years + ago... Hey it is not a bad thing.. as it does have its traditional charm. 

Even the waitress and the sushi chefs and the kitchen help all dressed in the more traditional clothings.. they wear it like everyday clothes not like a costumes in some other restaurants. 

Lunch Specials from $9.99 Bento Box which comes in a separate sheet and the usual Lunch menu. 

Fuji Lunch with Ice cream ($14.99) 
- You have a choice of Egg Drop Soup or Miso Soup.. My Miso Soup was A-OK 
- Salad with ginger dressing.. so so... why most of the places I been to have to drown their fresh green in dressing that makes me really not understand, so I will request, dressing on the side from now on 
- 9 pcs Sushi - 3 cucumber rolls/3 tuna roll/Salmon/Tuna/Shrimp nirgri A-OK.. the seaweed is crispy and have a great flavour. The fish are good and fresh.. the Shari rice is standard.. I found it a little hard did not Wow me 
- Shrimp and Veggie Tempura the choice of veggie is really good: green bean, cauliflower, yam, broccoli, eggplant and pepper.. love the veggie. The Shrimp is really fresh, moist..and tender.. but the batter is a little heavy to my liking 
- ice cream you have a choose for green tea, vanilla and black seasame.. hmmm black seasame always my fave! Great to have that as one of the selections! 

Portion is a little small.. I feel like I just started eating after having that.. maybe I have to order more!! :) 

Services here is nice and friendly.. Japanese lady is so high energy, talking in her high pitch voice..like a happy little girl! :P 

BTW there are no cellphone signs everywhere on the wall, on the hot water heater.. everywhere I look. 

I would definitely recommend Mikado if you have craving for a authentic and traditional Japanese experience.. here you will get excellent Japanese services and food and even sitting at the tatami room at the back.

3.5 star"}
{"text":"Keeping it short!!!

Authentic and had a few extraordinary dishes, but not as fresh and well displayed as other jap restos I've been, here in Toronto and elsewhere....

Still LOTS of room for improvement, my friends at Mikado since 1978!!"}
