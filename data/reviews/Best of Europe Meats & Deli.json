{"text":"I don't know of a better place to get an awesome deli sandwich.  Delicious european meats and very large sandwiches."}
{"text":"Really good place to eat, try it if you ever get a chance. What do you have to loss. I want to go there route now just thinking about it."}
{"text":"I stop in this gem occasionally for a sandwich. Its one of the few places where you can get a great lunch at a great price. The sandwiches are actually two sandwiches and are delicious. One of these days I'll order some meats to take home. There's not much seating so don't expect a full service diner. Owners are very nice and friendly. Beware though, its cash only, no credit cards!"}
{"text":"I have been a regular at this deli because the service is exceptional, the place is clean, and the ladies that run the counter are professional & friendly. I'm a big fan of the smoked bacon and head cheese.  It is definitely european if you know what that is.  Someone who calls these nice ladies snotty must really have issues. That's just my opinion.  Maybe you came on an off day.  What's wrong with paying cash?  Just come prepared.  I do."}
{"text":"The cured meats here are fantastic! The sandwiches are fantastic! The sausages are fantastic! The house cured bacon is fantastic! The people who run this place are beyond fantastic, super friendly, helpful and quick with a free sample.  Strange location, but worth a trip across town.  Super, super clean!"}
{"text":"This is the best deli ever! How could it not be with the hours of operation? This is a serious family operation.    If preserved and smoked meat products are your thing then his place is your local Mecca. The meat case is glorious. Bring their home made weiners to any party and you will be the hit of the party. The Hungarian Salami is melt in your mouth good.   Bring some extra spending money and stock up on some of their pantry items which are very unique and very tasty. They sell a product called Ajvar (sp?) that is a spicy pepper compote, it make everything delicious, sandwiches, pasta sauces, just add it to sour cream and use it as a dip, bomb!  I have yet to have one of their sandwiches as I try to avoid bread but every time I am there and someone else orders one, my mouth starts watering as the lady behind the counter slices piles of meat for their sandwiches, those mothers are huge!"}
{"text":"Man, this place is just good.  I don't know if it's a European, American or Polish deli, but the sandwiches are damn good.  Hell it could be called Best of Antarctica Meats & Deli and they would still have some of the best sandwiches in town.  When you buy a sandwich, you actually get two, so keep that in mind.  The sourdough bread is amazing.  The cold cuts are very high quality and delicious.  I purchased a few Polish sausages to go and made them at home later.  Wow.  Impressed."}
{"text":"Sandwiches are worth the trip every time. Lots of good food for the $$$. Not much more to say"}
{"text":"My brother and I ate here. He got the number 3 and I got the number 12. Both were great. And we each took home a quarter of our sandwiches because they were very big."}
{"text":"Where to start? This place is amazing!!! From the moment you walk in you immediately are immersed in wonderful aromas of a real deal deli. There sandwiches are amazing, its not about the bread, its not about the toppings, its about the meat. And to me that's what makes a great deli sandwich is the meat. Everything I have ordered here is amazing and worth it. From the kielbasa, smoked bacon, and the pork franks, you cant go wrong with what you order. Their deli meat prices are slightly cheaper than your average Boars Head meats you find at the store and are one hundred times better. So grab some cash, stop in ,you will be greeted with a friendly smile and you will be a customer for life, just like me."}
{"text":"Authentic and fresh. It's always great to see your meat sliced in front of you. Hot pastrami on rye took me right back to my childhood in Manhattan."}
{"text":"I love the turkey sandwich.  One order is two full sandwiches - share one or save it for lunch tomorrow.  I have found that they are often out of bread at the end of the day, so I try to go by 2:00 to make it more likely that I can get my sandwich.  I also like all of the sausages I have tried; I tend towards the mild stuff. Tip: As others have mentioned, they only take cash."}
{"text":"Their sandwiches are delicious and they give you generous portions.  The spicy meat smell is worth the visit.  Just remember to bring cash because they don't take credit."}
{"text":"The food is good, but yesterday I drove 8 miles to get there and found the door locked at 4:52.  Today they tell me I'm a liar.    I won't risk another gallon of gas to buy from people who waste my time then lie directly to me about it."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches. Almost all the meats & sausages are made there in house. If you are still buying your coldcuts/sandwich meats from the grocery store STOP and come here instead. The prices are cheaper and the quality is amazing.  My favorites are the turkey, ham, hot capi, paprika Hungarian salami and spicy kabanos.  Also their hotdogs are the best I've ever had. When cooked they have a great snap to them, which I assume comes from the natural casing they use. I have not purchased hotdogs or lunch meat from the grocery store since I found this place years ago.  It's always nice to see the same friendly, helpful smiling faces in there every time I go in. The line can get long sometimes but that is only because the owners take as much time as needed with each customer to make sure they have exactly what they need."}
{"text":"I want to merry the girl who made my sandwich! Best sandwich Iv had in a very long time, and made by a beautiful woman, thank you!"}
{"text":"Okay for the uptight transplants that expect too much, here is a review for you.  First, this is not a fancy place.  It is a place for people that appreciate Eastern European food.  The Spicy Capicola (sp?) sandwich is awesome.  Yes they take 3 forms of payment, cash, cash, and cash.  Next they are tucked away in a little strip mall.  So if you cannot be seen here, you don't have any cash, and you expect something other than a GREAT place to get all sorts of homemade meats and Eastern European food, please go to a trendy over-priced sushi restaurant and STFU.  Now, like I said the spicy capicola is amazing.  The spicy Kabanos is something that I always leave with.  There is always a variety of foods, candies, etc from Eastern Europe.  We live about as far away as we can get and still make it a point to make a trip to load up on the goodies. Oh, and a half sandwich is a sandwich!  A sandwich is essentially two sandwiches pictured below!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, clean and really enjoyed my lunch. More than enough food next time I will order the half sandwich."}
{"text":"Every review I have read is right on!  I had no idea what I was getting into when I stepped foot into this little family owned deli.  Old school - quality meats, great sandwiches.  The sandwiches feed two people for $8.  All I have to say is if you don't try it you are just straight foolish!!"}
{"text":"It is to Phoenix's credit that this place exists here.  I challenge anyone to get better old world, European-style charcuterie elsewhere.  The closest any competitor could come would be \"as good as\".  The made-to-order sandwiches are immensely flavorful and appetizing and share no equal in the city known to me.  There's also an interesting selection of imported grocery items such as jellies, pickled, vegetables, noodles, etc.  I agree with previous reviewers that the customer service is friendly.  Be advised that operating hours are somewhat restrictive, and Best of Europe is cash only.  Overall, these minor inconveniences are greatly overshadowed by the store's authenticity, consistent quality, and genial staff.  It's well worth juggling your schedule a bit to get here while it's open."}
{"text":"My DH loves this place. Smoked Meats are really good and authentic. Friendly staff and lots of interesting jars from Europe- beets, sauerkraut, jams, noodles and spices. Stop by just to look around and you'll probably leave with something yummy!"}
{"text":"The Best cold cuts (deli meats) in Phoenix"}
{"text":"Excellent! Wonderful sausages and great sandwiches! I was impressed with all the jarred pickled products and various other products from Europe. Tip: Bring cash. They do not accept any cards."}
{"text":"Amazing sandwich but if you like smaller portions just get a half. Great meat and service"}
{"text":"4.8/5 stars. This may be the best sandwich in Phoenix. Meats are tender and flavorful, bread is very fresh and soft in the middle chewy outside. Be aware when you ask for a whole you actually get two huge sandwiches. A 1/2 order is more than plenty. What is nice about the way it's prepared is the sandwich is very filling yet the bread is thin. A lot of places will load up on the bread and minimize the meat you get. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Cash only!  This is a legitimate Polish meat counter that will also make you a sandwich.  There are four chairs and no soda machine.  The folks behind the counter are friendly and the Italian sandwich was enough for two.  It was literally two sandwiches.  Each more delicious than the other.  Come get your coldcuts on!"}
{"text":"The best home made sausage in town. Great Kielbasa and other cold-cuts and sausages."}
{"text":"Snotty counter help.  The one menu is taped to the meat case.  Dirty and pen scratches and edits.  Very hard to read, red tags with back ink and so warn.  Taking cash only was the last kick to get us out the door. We were so excited to hear about this place we went in with our mouths ready to have a wonderful sandwich and deli items to take home. Young counter person was not as nasty as the older lady, but for not having very many customers, you would think that having someone walk in the door would be a good thing. Not that day.  I cant say how gruff and nasty they were.  All I can say is good luck with the business.  Lets say 2 sandwiches an assortment of cut meats and some cheese....an easy $50.00 sale that they could of had if a little niceness was extended."}
{"text":"I came here for some sausage for the holidays. If you like big, long sausages then you'll love this place! And you can smell this place from the outside. The smell of smoked Kielbasa lures you in. The store is non stop for the holidays but bring cash or check as no debit or credit are accepted. At Best of Europe you hear Eastern Europeans speaking in their native tongue, see the facial features of those of whose ethnic ancestry are similar to mine, those scooping up the traditional Christmas foods of herring, kielbasa, havarti cheese wih dill, smoked mackerel, pickles, sauerkraut, homemade rye bread, sardines from Scottland. This place is clean and organized. Traditional foods for Christmas or Easter is a great time to celebrate with Best of Europe, try the rest of the wonderful deli meats and cheeses during the rest of the year!"}
{"text":"Great family owned and operated European (Polish) Deli serving several Sausages, Lunch Meats, home made Pierogies and Imported items from overseas to meet you desires. You can smell the hickory wood burning while standing in the parking lot when they are smoking meats.  I have been coming here since they opened 20 years ago. Always see the same smiling family members working the counter. Lots of fresh items to choose from either in the case or hanging on the wall behind the counter.  I love and always get the Old Style (garlic) Smoked Polish Sausage with some of the Imported Polish Cheese on the side and some European rye bread made here in town. Everything is fantastic including the awesome sandwiches they make for a reasonable price.  Place can get pretty busy and it is fun to hear people speaking Polish when ordering their goodies and then watching them dance with excitement as they get back in their cars. CASH Only. NE Corner in Food City parking lot. Definitely one of my favorite sausage places in town."}
{"text":"Can't get more authentic than this. Polish family runs the place and makes all their own meats and sausage. They carry many crackers, condiments, and other imported goods from Poland, etc. They also make a decent sandwich for 5 or 6 bucks. Warning! Cash only."}
{"text":"WoW! Did not know this place existed until an employee of mine suggested we go there. Turkey and swiss sandwich was delicious! The bread was soft and so good. I will go back! Best sandwich I have had in a long time!"}
{"text":"I've been looking for a great Deli, the kind that you find in NYC or Chicago. I can't believe it took me a while to discover this place, but so glad I did. I stopped in for a sandwich and walked out a fan. They have more selections than you need and things I've never even heard of before.   I believe it's run by a mother/son team, with the mother having a nice Polish accent, so you get the feeling she's curing meats like back in the old country.   Looking forward to going back and sampling some new things and getting the stand-by's, of which will inevitably be better than what can be bought at grocery store counters.   If you miss the authenticity of deli's from the place your grew up or have a bit of envy from those travel shows watching the hosts gorge themselves on great deli meats from famous places, this is our solution here in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Best deli in town if you are looking for a great sandwich or some amazing sausage this is the place!"}
{"text":"Family run, local business and  Hands down, Best sandwich by far  in a long time, I hadn't had a sandwich with that quality in the cuts since I lived in the SF Bay Area. People you've got to try the spicy one it's either 2 or 3 I think. The service was polite, attentive and had good suggestions   Tip the girl people don't be rude"}
{"text":"Wow cute little place. First time today. It's a mom and daughter who own this place. The meat is made there fresh. It smells amazing the minute you walk in and the sandwiches taste amazing. Really glad I got to try. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches at a great price. A whole sandwich is actually 2 sandwiches for about $7.50. The meat was awesome, you can smell it before you even walk in the door. Super nice ladies running the place too, cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"Don't bother to stop.  They don't  care about their customers.   Stopped by today, a Friday, at 3:00 PM.  Sausage case was empty, clerk said they were closing early.  3:00 o'clock on a Friday.   They also do not accept any debit or credit cards?  What's with that when amex has so many valley employees?  Looking elsewhere. . . ."}
{"text":"If you want the real deal, this is it.  The owner makes all her meats and they are of the highest quality.  The sandwiches are served european style that relies on quality and less on a mountain of sauces and other ingredients that have nothing to do with wonderful ham, turkey, sausage, and salumi.  Come here and order a sandwich and then take home hot dogs or kielbasa.  It truly is the real deal and such high quality.  If you want to see how the Europeans prepare a sandwich come here.  My only complaint is that I wish they served fountain drinks.  Otherwise this is a wonderfully homey and unique experience."}
{"text":"Cash ONLY   This is a real deal deli, family owned and operated. They have just about everything you could ask for.   I always get the sandwich, usually some type of smoked ham. They are large and usually can be a meal for two.   The staff is wonderful and very helpful.   There are only two 4top tables inside the deli.   Cash ONLY"}
{"text":"I lived a few blocks from this place for 12 years. There is no reason to EVER buy deli meats at a supermarket once you try their meats. The cappacola (ham with a peppery edge) is out of this world, their sandwiches are ridiculous sick, the people are laid back and attentive at the same time. You just can't get anything better. Plus they have a mean little selection of Polish groceries, candies, cakes and delicacies.  I moved a few weeks ago to the other side of the valley. I'm really bummed."}
{"text":"As a friend of the family and being half Polish, this place is absolutely wonderful! They have delicious food on top of \"market\" type items that are found in traditional Eastern European cooking that you can buy. I love coming here because it reminds of my heritage and has awesome food! The place is pretty tiny but the food will keep you coming back again and again! Too bad it's really far away from my home or I would be here on a weekly basis!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years and I've never been disappointed. I was raised by my paternal Grandparents, both of whom came from \"the old country,\" Poland. A lot of the meats sold here were on the dinner table when I was a child. Some only made for special occasions. I remember my Grandmother spending almost the whole day making some of the delicacies found here from scratch. Unique and time honored mixtures of spices and meats that you just can't find at a Supermarket. It is a 45 minute (one way) drive from my house in the East valley to get to this store and I think it's worth every mile. It's like when I rode my bike to the local butcher shop to pick up something my Grandmother wanted. (I'm 65)"}
{"text":"My husband is from Poland, and coming from Chicago, we got extremely excited to get some kielbasa and some of their jarred picked salads. We walked through the front door, immediately got upset. Place is so small and has no selection. They didn't even have bread for sale! I will admit the kielbasa was decent, would NOT recommend getting the without garlic. Just wished it was something we are used to!"}
{"text":"Admittedly, after only a couple of visits this is almost a \"Single Menu Item Review.\" Although, I do believe that single item is indicative of the quality of the smoked meats, etc offered in this unique to Phoenix Deli. That single item?                     The Number 12 Sandwich (Without onions for me!)  Far and away the best Deli Sandwich or Submarine Sandwich  I have had since moving from New Jersey 20+ years ago. With three meats, cheese, shredded lettuce, tomatoes and a mixture of mustard and mayonnaise on Polish Rye Bread is absolutely to die for.  As warned by a Previous Reviewer a \"Half Sandwich\" is a full sandwich and a \"Full Sandwich\" is actually two sandwiches. I still have no satisfactory answer as to why. (lol)  Only two small tables for \"eat in\" and no beverages are offered. I go at odd hours so have been able to \"Eat In\" each time while bringing my own beverage. The Owner's Daughter is most accommodating and the array of Shoppers you see and hear as you partake of this fabulous sandwich is testimony to the quality of their offerings. (Saw one lady spent over $50 on assorted smokes meats!)  A terrific find!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!!!! It is the BEST Euro deli around!   When you walk in, you are greeted with an aroma of their homemade meats. The market is quaint with some very unusual yet delicious grocery items. But the best part about this place....their kielbasa sandwiches. Oh, and their amazing owner who is always so nice and helpful.  We love \"eating in\" at one of the two small tables and just enjoying wonderful food and feeling very much at home."}
{"text":"Been here once. Got the Italian special & the European sub. Both were really good! I tried both & couldn't decode which one I liked better lol. The sandwiches are actually 2 sandwiches when you order the full sandwich so you get huge portions! Not bad at all for $7 & change. Lots of other European goodies that I had never seen. Sweets too. I tried the kinder country chocolate bar. The girl at the counter said it was Germany's most popular candy. I can tell why! Yummy!!!"}
{"text":"Holy Cow!  I love it when my Yelp friends are so correct about a place. Never been here before but read the past reviews and ordered the #12. Which, the girl behind the counter recommended before I even said anything. It was awesome! Two whole sandwiches. Perfect amounts of meat and cheese.  Can't wait to go back when I have people over for a BBQ so I can get some of their franks. Great service as well. Will be back numerous times."}
{"text":"Wow. Best deli I've had in the valley!! They make all their own meats and prepare the most amazing sandwiches with them. They only accept cash and today I was 2 dollars short. Since I have been here a few times and they sort of know me the owner (which I believe is mother and daughter) simply told me to bring 2 bucks extra next time. Such hospitality:)"}
{"text":"I love this place, It's amazing! Food is fantastic and the  person behind the counter is awesome!! So friendly. Overall great place.!"}
{"text":"Came across this deli while on vacation looking for something homemade and light to eat.  Great ham and Swiss sandwich...and the price was for 2 of them.  Score!"}
{"text":"Looks and feels like a good old mom and pop shop. Got a pastrami sandwich and was pretty damn good. I really wish I hadn't seen the girl making my sandwich put the fresh deli meat into a microwave, really killed the moment. Definitely stop by again just for the deli meats."}
{"text":"best sandwiches in town?? no, they are just okay. I wasn't blown away. All the reviews pumped this place up too much. A super small and very limited selection of sandwiches to choose from and only 2 of those were hot sandwiches... Sad this place had some much potential.   I am sure their business isn't driven by the sandwiches though."}
{"text":"A fine Mom & Pop Polish Deli in a neighborhood strip mall with nice selection of deli meats you're not going to find at many other delis and certainly not at any grocery stores. Sandwiches are hearty and satisfyingly good -and would make a great start for a picnic for two.  Get a salad, fruit and a bottle of wine and you're good to go. Oh, don't forget the date. They have assorted cookies/biscuits, candies, pasta, and beverages in the store too.  Important note for some, this place is CASH only. I suppose that keeps the cost down.  I'm really enjoying the Garlic Loin I picked up.  Would make yummy sandwiches but I'm snacking on it plain.   Whoever thought of Pork Tenderloin as a deli meat.  MMMmm.  Lean and flavorful but not overpowering. You can pass on the Ham and no need for Turkey cuz Pork IS the \"other white meat\" ya know.  If you're in the area and have a thing for Deli, give 'em a try. This is supporting the area economy in a good way.  Good for your belly and good for business."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place.  In fact, I love it so much it was what I wanted for my birthday lunch this year.  My family comes from Eastern Europe and I have been fortunate enough to visit a few times and the meats, bread, mustard and pickles really take me back.  If you visit, remember that they do not take credit cards so come with cash and that their sandwiches are HUGE, one will easily feed two people."}
{"text":"If you like dusty meats (the Bestie calls any delicious hanging sausages that...because he doesn't know any better) HALF as much as I do.....you will love this place! They have Hungarian kielbasa, with or without garlic and many other European sausages on display as you enter. There are like 12 different sandwich combinations available and I can personally account for two of them being super tasty. And they will also make you any custom sandwich you would like. DO NOT fail to grab a bottle of LUTENICA to go, when you visit. It's a wonderful chunky vegetable salsa mix/type thing with tomatoes, carrots, peppers, sunflower oil, paprika, cayenne pepper and other spices. It's makes a wonderful dip or Schmeer on just about everything especially their homemade Polish rye bread, which is also worth picking up a to go loaf of. We will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"About to have a sandwich from here but so far a really good experience. I ordered #3 and my sister ordered #12 with no mustard. Can't wait to see what they taste like. Everything so far is good though but I'll probably update once I eat the sandwich."}
{"text":"This deli may seem out of place as it is set in a corner lot dominated by a Food City and other Hispanic oriented businesses.  Those who went to the old Chompie's in the same shopping center might even have missed it.  Have been getting lunch here for quite a few years now.  It is a real Old World family run deli.  The meats in here are wonderful.  I think a Polish family owns the place.  The have a list of sandwiches that are all HUGE, super tasty and very affordable ( with tax around $7). Skip those chain subway shops and get a real sandwich here!  As mentioned by Daren, this place might take cash only.  I think they do take debit cards, but you have to order a certain $ min....be safe and take cash.  This place gets busy at lunchtime and there are about 3 tables in here.  Better to take you grub to a less crowded spot to savor it in peace...  Warning: You will go for lunch and want to buy about 10 lbs. of deli meat!"}
{"text":"As good as it gets. No seriously. From the overwhelming delicious smell when you walk in the door, to the friendly service this little gem has it all. They have a small menu and we followed the suggestion of getting the #12. Perfect. It's large enough to share but you won't want to.  Make sure to bring CASH but not too much. Prices are fair and you will end up spending it all on their amazing meats.  Definitely worth stopping in."}
{"text":"I felt I was back in the Midwest when I entered this little deli!  I lived in a part of Minneapolis which was the old eastern European neighborhood of the city.  The locals call it Nordeast .  There are great Polish restaurants and delis around the area.  The Best of Europe deli is a stone's throw from my house and I just stumbled upon it while shopping at Food City.  it's in the same strip mall.  I thought i was back at Karmarczuk's.....a real old fashioned family owned deli.  This place is just as good to my delight.  The sandwiches use good meats and great bread, there are little items to buy, and the sausages rule!  It's a sausage fest, so to speak.  Really glad I live close to this place.  You may have to drive around the parking area for awhile to locate it.  It's small.  But I hope they continue to be successful and we'll have great Eastern European deli foods for years to come.  Worth going out of your way for....oh, but don't bring your credit card....cash only!"}
{"text":"First of all, let me just say, the only reason I tried this place was b/c of the perfect yelp score. I was slightly leary b/c there was only 24 reviews(I'm #25 woo hoo! lol). But I figured getting mostly 5 stars & no less than a 4 star was given out of those 24, it must be good, & fortuneatly, I was FAR from disappointed. Just like pretty much every other review u read from here, the smoked & cured sausages & meats are TO DIE FOR! The young lady working the counter was very nice & helpfully, generously & glefully let me sample whatever i desired(which was a lot!) & they were all amazing. I got the #12 European combo sandwich, & it was hands down the Top 2 or 3 sandwich I've ever had! Very small, quaint, little, old-school type deli that u don't find too much anymore. And all the products they had were rare, look very tasty & are all reasonably priced! Great little hidden gem in NE Valley. I'm an instant fan! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Best deli in town! The owner Krystyna is a sweetheart and the selection is amazing! I highly recommend this place.  https://youtu.be/pcMs3wRpgRs"}
{"text":"Amazing cold cuts that are made in-house and ridiculously amazing assortment of smoke sausages.  Hands down the best European deli in town.   They also make very good sandwiches."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.  Their ham and Swiss cheese sandwich is so delicious.  I have returned many times.  Today I got a good old fashioned liverwurst sandwich and it was delicious.  Lots of other Polish goodies.  You must try this place."}
{"text":"I went here for my late lunch today and the place is a little hard to locate (not their fault and not one of the reasons why I am not giving it five stars). Small location in a building at the shopping center where there is a Food City and McD's (it's located inbetween the two facing... west?).  Walk in and the place is well organized with jarred fruits and pickled stuffs along the wall. Counter directly in front and two small small tables located to try and make the place easy to walk around in and check out the displays. I was promptly greeted by a woman. She was friendly and to the point.   Her recommendation was the #12. I asked her what meats were on it and she listed a few, but she also mentioned she liked to switch things up (I am guessing depending on what they have available). Decided to go with her rec and asked for no tomato's but with onions. The menu read that it came on Italian but it honestly looked and tasted more like sourdough (still good).   My main beef was they didn't ask what size I wanted and I automatically got the larger size. They did have drinks (I noticed previously posted someone said there were none available so this may be new) canned soda and small bottles of water. No idea what the cost of the soda/water is. My total meal came to $9 which wasn't bad since it literally came as two sandwiches (yay! I have lunch tomorrow). To my recollection I was not offered a receipt.  I noticed that a lot of the meats they sell weren't labeled. I don't think they have mortadella (a personal fave). They were offering people samples of the meats and I did hear a lot of \"way better than the grocery store\".  My sandwich was loaded with meat and \"half\" was more than filling.   All in all, if I am in the area I will be back to eat here and remember to specifically say \"HALF!\""}
{"text":"Just the best kielbasa around. We've been shopping here for years. They've got all the meats, cheeses, and even pickles you could need :-)"}
{"text":"Returning from a summer spent in the very food conscious and bountiful San Francisco was quite a downer as I felt I was in a desert literally. (+figuratively) I was saddened by the loss of my Epicurean lifestyle in SF and sold my soul to the likes of Safeway and Jimmy Johns.  Once I emerged from my stupor I'm beginning to find that Phoenix actually does have quite the amazing finds if you search hard enough. Best of Europe Deli is one of those and it blew me away as this gem in the corner of a strip mall hides in its shelves what its name entails.  Some locals inside recommended the luncheon meats and the cashier broadened upon those recommendations. She also doled out hearty samples of great polish cheese and some spicy capicola. As she did she explained that she was the daughter of the owners and that most of the meats are made in house or brought in from local establishments. Her expert opinion was also derived on a lifetime of experience on Polish food.   I counted my loot at home  Great polish spicy mustard 3/4 lb cheese  lb of capicola, jam A fruit drink called Kubus (quite tasty) Redcurrent Jam And a half loaf of bread A goulash mix!~  All for under $20 The fact that none of these products contained preservatives or weird chemicals was great and that the money was used to support a great local business makes you feel good. (As it usually should, I'm looking at you Safeway and Walmart)  This experience made the 30 min drive to northern Phoenix quite worth it and I feel lucky to have found this place via yelp and that places like this exist in a mostly barren commercialized landscape.  I also learned polish food is more subtle and rich but quite nice! Highly recommended~"}
{"text":"Meh, this place wasn't as good as everyone was hyping it. The first thing I noticed was that it was really warm inside when I walked in. It wasn't horrible but I won't be back."}
{"text":"Amazing yummy sandwiches... In my opinion best in town! Tiny little deli with huge delicious smells and tastes! Awesome customer service! Bring cash! They don't accept debit or credit! I just finished a sandwich and am already craving another one!!!"}
{"text":"This is truly the best place in ARIZONA to buy a sandwich."}
{"text":"Great little market with wow factor sandwiches.   Fresh European meats and much more.  A must try if you like heart attack sandwiches and meats."}
{"text":"I can't even think of another sandwich shop that is close to as good. High quality meats and breads and the place always smells so good. The sandwich prices are great value for money."}
{"text":"We got there just in time! Apparently we were getting the last two sandwiches of the day at 3pm. Probably the last slices of bread(?). I went for a ham-sausage I have never tried and it was mighty tasty. Athena had pastrami which wasn't too salty and not too peppery.   Great food, excellent service. Meats are imported - sausages made on premises. For either, I think you'd be hard pressed to even match the prices for non-imported stuff at the supermarket! We spent about $15 on sammies and $30 on deli meats and polish pickles.   Everyone says the sammies are large - nobody has mentioned that they are large because they give you TWO of them! That's 2 sammies per order on a sourdough-type crusty sliced bread. Nice. Have one there (if they have a table open) and take the other home for later!  Oh yeah, they have a Yelp! sticker on the door..."}

{"text":"This place reminds me of walking into a deli somewhere in Eastern Europe - it's that authentic. The proprietors speak Polish and they have many authentic products from the Eastern Bloc. The sandwiches taste so fresh and are made from high quality ingredients and are HUGE! I've been coming here for a decade and it's as good as the day I first started coming here"}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE!  I found this place on Yelp, and based on the reviews and my uncontrolable urge to have Polish Sausage, I decided to make the drive to try it.  I ordered some fresh polish sausage, some dried sausage, and a Polish Sausage sandwich.  I ate the sandwich in the car (since there really is not much room inside to eat), and it was very good.  The meat was sliced thin and heated up.  It had a mustard on it that was ok, but I typically eat my sandwiches dry.  The bread was delicious!  It held up well, the crust was fantastic, and it had a good flavor.  I recommend ordering a half sandwich.  It is actually a whole sandwich.  If you order a whole sandwich, you get two sandwiches.  Not sure why.    So I took the fresh sausage home and cooked it up.  It was delicious!  Best I have found since leaving Chicago!  It is not fatty and rubbery (like Stanley's in Phoenix always was).  The links are the perfect size.  I always slice it open length wise and put it on some good rye bread.  This was a delicious sandwich, and needless to say, it didn't last long in my house.  I'll definitely be back for more.   The dried sausage was very good, and did not mold (I've been other places where it molds very quickly).  This sausage is a hit.  It's a great snack, but be warned..... you will have garlic breath. :)"}
{"text":"Best pastrami sandwich i have had in years. And the worst part is i cant seem to read a sign to save my life. So when i hand her a credit card and she smiles and says we dont take cards i am sorry. What she says next will blow your mind...\" Dont worry about it, i will get next time you come in, have a good day.\" Are you kidding me...customer for life and everyone i know, done deal!!"}
{"text":"Have been looking for a good deli around the office for quite some time now, decided to let Yelp help me and low and behold this is what I found. This is the real deal, freshly prepared sandwiches that are too die for! Plus a variety of fresh sausages, meats etc. Will be making this a once a week lunch run for sure! Try the #14!"}
{"text":"The sandwich I had here was monsterous.  It's the opposite of Subway, tons of meat on a small pieces of bread- instead of huge bread and a few small slices of meat.  If you like your sandwich with giant piles of meat stacked high and falling out of the bread, this is the place to go. The woman behind the counter was very nice.  They only have a couple tables inside, and they don't have chips and a drink so my advice would be to grab your sandwich to go... if that's what you came for.  Also, cash only, and this place is a bit hard to find.  Follow your Nav and then you'll need to drive around looking for it.  It's by the McDonalds."}
{"text":"Incredible European Deli specializing in Old World Polish Foods goodies treats Meats. Stuff you cannot get anywhere else plus they make their own sausages kabanos and other good Treats. Have been coming here for many years. The owners are very friendly helpful outgoing and there to help if you need your questions answered. If you've never tried you need to come by and check them out. Cash only."}
{"text":"Fantastic place to buy really good quality home made produce and at such a reasonable price. A tiny little place, but really is worth the visit. The lady running it is an absolute diamond, I tried so many nice cured meats. I asked for some English styled back bacon, it was a no :-( but then she brought out a tray of freshly cooked belly pork for me. I hadn't got home before it was all polished off - beautiful. The Polish sausages were a real hit and really large. They made an already good toad in the hole top draw.  Looking forward to another visit!"}
{"text":"What a great little sausage shop. Genuine Polish and all the jars of Polish vegetables you need. And how pleasant to be waited on patiently while we decided what we wanted. She even threw in some bacon pieces when I told her I was making bigos. :)"}
