{"text":"I fell in love with Habits last year as I have good friends who used to live super close by. The service, food and atmosphere is just AMAZING. They even have various kinds of infused alcohol which makes their Bloody Ceasar (made with jalapeno infused vodka) one of the best in Toronto by far. I am most definitely in love with their brunch menu -- the grilled cheese is so good when you use a bit of the date (I think) sauce/puree that comes on the side. 

I would definitely recommend Habits as the owners have clearly put their heart and soul into making every guest's experience one to remember--and one to come back for."}
{"text":"People must be joking....5 stars for this place? Oh my god this is a joke of a place....middle aged drunks and terrible service....this is the problem with YELP, owners, staff, friends can give 5 stars....why does Yelp not go and check places out.....a solid 2 star period"}
{"text":"I've been to this place a bunch of times and had consistently good food. They serve my favorite mojito and and mac and cheese in the city. This is why my partner made reservations here for our anniversary today. We walked in and the place was packed and smelled really strongly of gas. It took almost 5 minutes to get anyone's attention and that person seemed annoyed that we were even there.      We told him that we had a reservation and waited while he figured it out. He then grabbed a bar chair from the bar, put it with another bar chair infront of the kitchen bar and told us that this was the \"Chef's Table\". He saw on my face that I was not very impressed with this but I didn't want my partner to think that I wasn't enjoying the date so I sat down. The smell of gas was even stronger. We decided to leave. While we were walking out, I told the guy who had seated us that it was our anniversary and we had wanted something special. He shrugged. I am really disappointed . I have recommended this place to countless people and after this experience I will not be back."}
{"text":"Had high hopes going in, left in anger and disappointment. Everything that could have went wrong did go wrong. 
- I made reservations for the evening, they gave my table away to some other person. 
- champagne cocktail was flat
- burger was raw but bun was burnt, and took 45 minutes to arrive even after they told us repeatedly kitchen was \"waiting for it to come to temperature\". 
- bangers and mash came with one banger. 
- had to wave down the waiters to get a new drink.
- kept alternating between the manager and waitress for service, making service inconsistent. 
- failed to tell us what the soup of the day was.
- failed to tell us they were out of a particular food from the winterlicious menu until I tried ordering. 
- failed to answer a question I had because of the alternating service, one thought the other had come back with it. 

Didn't get charged for one of the meals but still came out to $70 and took 2 hours as well and we barely got our entree. Mind you the place wasn't even busy, there was no excuse for lack of service or the slowness in the kitchen. We ended the night with some reliable Chinese takeout."}
{"text":"We went there with a company of 15 to celebrate a birthday. The food was fantastic (waited for some time for it to arrive but it was worth it). Good service, cool atmosphere. The band on Sat night was also very cool (\"box full of cash\"). Highly recommended."}
{"text":"After month of visiting this restaurant I have found the service and food quality to be consistently impressive. Ask Luis to make you a speciality cocktail - If you're brave make it a surprise (I haven't been disappointed yet). Sure thing more your speed? Ask for the lavender infused gin mojito. The new Reno looks great. Exposed brick is a favorite of mine. Can't wait to chill at this place in the summer and try their new seasonal menu."}
{"text":"Great gastropub, with delicious food, excellent service, and a cozy atmosphere.  The prices are more than reasonable for the high quality of the food, and there is a great selection of beers on tap.  I had the fried chicken with sauteed greens, and smoked cheddar grits, and I could have licked the plate it was so good!  The chicken was super crispy, and not greasy at all, and the grits were so good that I could have just eaten a giant bowl of them on their own!  My boyfriend had the burger which melted in our mouth when we bit it.  It was stuffed with brie, and came with hearty thick cut fries.  I wish I had room for dessert, because based on how good dinner was, I am certain that their desserts would not disappoint, however I could not fit another bite in after finishing my huge meal.  We will definitely be back again soon, for dinner and a chance to try their desserts, and we will be brining back friends for drinks next time we need a cozy pub to hang out in.

I highly recommend this gastropub, it will not disappoint."}
{"text":"If you like your whiskey, you have to check this place out. Definitely one of the largest whiskey selections in the city of Toronto.

Great decor! Great music! 
Food was good."}
{"text":"Went here based on a recommendation from a friend. The mac and cheese with duck was phenomenal!! It was $19 but well worth it. I could have eaten that everyday!
My date had the sea bass which was also very good.

They have an extensive drink list, the ambiance was nice and our waiter very friendly and helpful. 
The kitchen is an open concept. It's a bit nicer and dresser than the average pub, but don't feel like you have to go all out to fit in here. Overall, it was a really great dinner and will be coming back for more! 
Oh and they also have the 2013 Summerfest too for $25 you get an appetizer, main and dessert. YUM!"}
{"text":"Took my wife here for Valentines Day. I made reservations via Open Table a few days in advance which made me a little nervous since there were prime time spots available still so close to V-day.

When we arrived I was nervous when I was told by the girl at the maitre d station that I didnt have reservations. I offered to produce my confirmation email but the manager stepped up and told me that he would accommodate us without reservations (the place was at approx 15% capacity) and sat us promptly in a nice 4 person table with a view into the open style kitchen. A few minutes later the manager came back and told me he had found our reservations and that he had to switch our table. A slight annoyance the whole ordeal but he was profusely apologetic and throughout the night very friendly and attentive (he wasn't our waiter). 

We were sat further at the back which was fine (closer to the small stage where a jazz band would play later). 

*Decor*
Very nice and warm. Exposed brick, open kitchen design, nice lighting. Theres a big area at the back that could be used as event space for a band, open mic, etc. with the front area being more of a restaurant. Reminds me of Czehoski a lot in full compliment but uniquely different. Habits would be a great place for a date or a night out with the significant other.

*Food*
Food was much better then expected for the price range. We were greeted with a free amuse bouche of some pineapple square thing. I dont know what to call it. It was good though.

Our appetizer was a cheeseboard. For $15 we received a bowl of herbed and toasted croustinis together with good portions of 3 different cheeses (blue, a smoked cheese and a fresh parm?), a fruit jam (nothing like a store bought jam, it was amazing and smokey!), and some fruits. It was a great appetizer that I would order again. Perfect serving for 2-3 people. 

My wife had the oxtail ravioli (~$20) on a sunchoke puree which she liked a lot.

I had the habits burger ($16). It was suggested to have it cooked medium for optimal favour. I was a little hesitant about it (pink ground beef for me isnt something Im accustomed to; a rare steak is). The burger was delicious, and well seasoned with herbs. Don't expect a typical hamburger, there is some unique flavours going on in this hamburger. It came on a nice brioche and a small helping of excellent french fries. A much different take on the \"gourmet\"  hamburger thats been all the rage in Toronto the last few years. Despite the waitresses suggestion I think I would have my burger cooked to medium well just out of personal preference (there wasnt any stomach distress after) so rest assured with the waitresses recommendation if pink ground beef is okay with you. Habits gets huge points for actually letting me know in advance about what I would be getting. 

I do want to note the portions are slightly small. The food quality and taste is well above the price point; the portions might fall a little short. A big eater might be a little disappointed, a regular or light eater can expect not to take a doggie bag home.

I had two different drinks: 
Canadian Smash (rye, orange, mint, lime, honey) and Raspberry Paloma (raspberry infused teq, lime, grapefruit and soda). They were okay, a little watery, a little juicy. All drinks come with 2oz and I believe them;  I think the issue is that the glass was so large with so much mixer and ice I didnt taste much spirit in either drink. Great recipes but the execution could be tweaked a bit.

*Service*
Outside of the disorganization at the beginning about the reservation and table arrangement; the service was friendly, fast, and attentive. No pretention, no attitude, no disinterest by the waitstaff all of which I find common in Toronto. There was that sense or urgency in every request made and that assurance that everything would be taken care of promptly and correctly. I give credit to the manager and waitress as they both did an excellent job at impressing my wife and I. 


Overall I am going to return to Habits and I'll post a follow up review. Food taste was excellent, service was great, some the the execution and portions are just slightly lacking. I'm hoping my gripes were just V-day jitters. See you soon guys."}
{"text":"I love this place. Pitchers of caesars $22! 
Great atmosphere. 

The owner is really nice, always says hello and is very welcoming. 

Never hesitant to tell you he appreciates your business! 

The food is great and I enjoy the open kitchen concept. 

Live music in the far back too!"}
{"text":"The selection of beer and whisky is truly excellent. However, the service I received while there was abrasive. I'm a server myself, so I understand that people have bad days etc... but still. I had a beer poured that was nearly half head, and when I asked if I could have it poured properly was greeted with a glare.... it was fixed but then slammed back down in front of me without comment. Further, upon ordering a pint for my partner, the keg ran out. That's fine, these things happen. However, the glass was 80% full. The bartender said we could have it, but we'd have to pay full price. We asked if there could be some kind of discount, as it wasn't a full beer, and after checking with the owner, we were told no. When asked what would happen to it if we didn't pay full price for it, we were told it would be poured down the sink. What the heck is that? Not a great business model. Upon further examination, the owner who made the call about the second pint turned out to be the same woman who poured the first badly poured pint, so maybe the problem just lies with her. It's really too bad because the vibe of the place definitely has potential, but my experience definitely didn't make me want to come back."}
{"text":"This place hosted a fundraiser to raise money for Goderich, a lovely place where I spent ten years of my life that was recently devastated by a tornado. My friend's house was destroyed and many businesses will never re-open. Worthy cause, right? Well, I was somewhat appalled to discover that only 5% (FIVE PERCENT) of proceeds from the bar were to be donated to Goderich. So that in and of itself is pretty lousy.

What makes this place even worse is that pints of Muskoka Lager--a decent beer, to be sure--were being sold for $8.50, which is $2 more than most other places would charge. And, as the night progressed, the price of the drinks crept up to the point where I was charged $19 for two pints. I explained this to the host and he said that it was most likely a computer error; however, it was the manager himself serving pints and it was clear that he was just being greedy. The host explained to me--patronizingly, as though I'd never had a beer in Toronto before--that lots of places charge far more than that for a drink, such as Volo, where bottles can go as high as $30. What on earth the price of a litre of imported Trappist ale has to do with the price of a pint of lager is beyond me, and I told him as much. Having realized that I was still pissed off about me and my friends getting ripped off, he graciously said that bottles of Innis & Gunn would be available for $5.50. Great! I ordered one and was charged $7.50. \"Tax,\" was the explanation I received when I asked about the discrepancy. What tax is 36%?

Servers seemed nice though."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised after wandering into this place to find a very nice ambiance (even though we sat on the patio, which is tiny but can seat a group of four or two couples).  We had brunch, which consisted of roasted peaches, a mammoth burger, salmon eggs benedict and a smoked cheddar and bacon frittata.  Given the price, we were all very impressed with the quality of each entree. Personally, I thought the flavour of the hollandaise sauce was a bit too unconventional, but the person who ordered it loved it.  This place is a gem, visit it soon!"}
{"text":"We took advantage of Winterlicious and had dinner on a Sunday evening. My 3 course dinner consisted of  an excellent squash and black bean soup, followed by  Veal cheek on a bed of Risotto and Panna Cotta with cherries for dessert. All were exceptional and beautifully presented, the only problem was the sample size portions, seriously,  an extra ladle of soup and an extra scoop of Risotto would have done the trick and this is the reason for the 4 star rating rather than 5. I am not sure whether these items were created especially for the prix fixe menu but if this is their norm we will be back only when looking for a snack or when we're not particularly hungry."}
{"text":"Always fantastic service and great food. They offered to custom make a vegetarian meal for our dinner on the fly. Fantastic chef and a great staff."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a Sunday afternoon and my boyfriend and I were both thoroughly impressed.
Service was attentive (I think the owner was our server and he was chatty and very nice). 
We both started with a spicy Caesar, made with in house infused jalapeño vodka and served with a spicy pickled green bean garnish, and it was tasty.
I ordered the eggs Benny with smoked salmon and my boyfriend ordered the BLAT sandwich (BLT with half an avocado and lemon aioli). We were served a really nice salad which we weren't expecting. It was delicious, tangy and spicy with a crispy preserved lemon on top. Couldn't figure out what the vinaigrette was, it had a lovely complex flavor, it was delicious.
The eggs Benny looked small at first, but it ended up being just the right amount. Plus, the Hollandaise was awesome. Couldn't figure out why it was green until the server told us it was infused with basil. De-lish. Apparently they regularly play with the Hollandaise so that you can't get bored of it. The BLAT sandwich was huge and apparently very tasty. The wedge fries served with it were really nice, crispy golden on the outside and then soft, almost like mashed potatoes, on the inside. The hash served with the eggs benny was good, but mostly when it was dipped in a mix of yolk and delightful green Hollandaise (otherwise I found it a bit too caramelized for my taste, but that's just my opinion). 
Prices were quite reasonable given the quality of the food. Eggs Benny: $10, BLAT $9, Caesars $6. Jazz music made for a really nice brunch atmosphere.
Will definitely come back. Had a hard time choosing from the menu (they have a Mac and cheese with black truffle!) and there a lot of other dishes I'd like to try
They've been open under a year, closed once for renos and plan to close once more to finish work. Decor is warm industrial with an open kitchen. Service is friendly and attentive, and again the food is great. Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Postives:  FOOD was excellent, all compliments to the Chef.  We ordered off the Gluten-free prix fixed menu.  We started with the Caprese salads, then I had  the steak & fries and my wife has the mushroom mac n' cheese.  

Negatives: SERVICE! Dont go here if you are in a rush, or need to be in anywhere in under 3hours.  Our whole meal took 2 hours & 40minutes.  We had to wait almost 45 min just to place our drink order & over an hour just to get a glass of water.  The one (and seemingly only) server was also the bartender, expediter,  manager etc.  The server did apologize when we first were sat that they had a large party so she had to be doing everything all at once.  We had to ask for everything ourselves from drinks to the bill.

We really wanted to love this place, had high hopes, but will not be back until they hire more staff."}
{"text":"Had a lovely time at Habits last week-- my bf and I popped in to visit a friend on his birthday-- and will definitely be back.  

What struck me the most about the place-- and why I feel compelled to add my voice to the growing list of glowing reviews here, which is not something I do much anymore-- was the genuine hospitality of the owners and wait staff alike.  From the moment we walked in-- a first visit, I might add, and we're not famous or anything-- we were treated like good friends, or at least, very loyal customers.  The kind of friendliness that you usually have to earn at most Toronto restaurants (I'm not kidding-- I haven't found most waiters/waitresses/owners to be kind or even decent in this city until I've dined with them at least a 5 times and left a rather generous tip (over 20% usually), regardless of the service, and even then... And I am not a b*tchy customer-- honest to God!-- as a former waitress myself I am ALWAYS on my best behaviour in these places, no lie!!), these people are giving it away for free.  And they're cute too, really cute.  

Yes, they're new and maybe they're trying harder than the rest for this reason alone, but it felt genuine to me.  It makes me want to go back there.  I hope they don't change!

Unlike some of the others here, I am a fan of the decor.  It is simple and homey, with solid wood tables that seat more like booths-- one in front of another rather than side-by-side-- so you're never rubbing elbows with a fellow diner, and getting in and out of your seat is not a complicated and awkward affair.  The tables are on one side and the bar and kitchen prep on the other, so you can look over and watch the experts work while you enjoy your food.  The lights are low and there are real candles on each table.  It is warm and comfortable, suitable for a friendly get together or a romantic evening with a special someone.  

When we arrived there was a band playing-- surprisingly non-suck too, and not obnoxiously loud either-- and our friendly host tried to find us a table a little closer to the stage so we could watch.  (They have a very good speaker system set up throughout the place, so you can listen just fine from anywhere, if not actually see the band.)  Since all had been taken, we were given a big 4-seater closer to the door, and an (unnecessary) apology.  So we got comfortable and had a look at the menu, and before deciding on what to eat the fella came back to let us know some other patrons we leaving and offered us the 'better table'.  He cleaned it up and we quickly moved there.  Again, unusual caring.  Un-toronto-like.  

I won't go into a long description of all menu items as the only thing I tried was the mussels (their special that night) and some bread and salad (it was late-- my man and I shared these), but everything was delicious and quite fresh.  I had a look at some of the other dishes as they made their way to other patrons-- everything looked and smelled quite intoxicating.  I doubt there's anything on the menu that isn't delicious, (even if my diet forbids it..)   My \"Angels Gate\" cab merlot went down quite nicely as well, and was quite reasonably priced. 

So there you go.  I like this little spot, quite a lot.  :-)"}
{"text":"This is the second time here, what a disappointment every thing is quite the opposite from the first visit. I'm leaving my first review below and taking the 5 stars away. The service is very slow it took 45 minutes to get the starters and 50 minutes to get the beer an hour later no main dish in sight.

The following was my review about 8 months ago, an amazing discovery this evening, every thing was amazing from atmosphere to service to the very delicious food from the starters to the deserts."}
{"text":"I used to really like this place when Garrett was a server there. The food was great, prices were pretty good, and Garrett was one of the best servers I'd ever had - very personable, knowledgable, and was good with checking in with us.

Last time I went to Habits the new server had no concept of personal space with her elbows on our table while she took our orders, and I asked about the charcuterie board and the girl had no idea what the meats were or what was even on the plate. 

I'm not usually hard on servers, but she was way too casual, didn't know the menu, prices were high, and food wasn't great this time.

Really disappointing :("}
{"text":"Very good experience here. There was great music , service and very lovely layout of seating w options to be by windows, bar or intimate back section. Fairly good selection of beers on tap, and what's great is the fact they brew there own beer as well."}
{"text":"Went on a Thursday got to enjoy live music and  delicious food. Fast and friendly servers . Would definitely go back"}
{"text":"I'm sorry, I have no idea why ppl like this place so much. They had crazy opera singers hiding behind a curtain singing all night and the food was strange and bland. Nothing too bad just a weird vibe and a little too expensive for what it is trying to be.

****Ugh. I had the lamb and honestly there should be a huge sign that says \"WE ARE GOING TO START SINGING OPERA AT 8PM\" bc some people don't hate opera but do not want to listen to it live on Tuesday at a neighborhood \"gastropub\". Thanks!"}
{"text":"Impressions from a first visit:

Took advantage of a foursquare first checkin perk for a complimentary infused spirit cocktail. Our service was a team effort between the two wait staff on duty and we were consistently impressed throughout the duration of the meal. Food was definitely above par. 

Our meal began with a complimentary amuse; a little riff on a mini corndog comprised of Merguez sausage... delicious. I stopped listening to the app specials when a locally sourced Charcuterie board was mentioned. (did not dissappoint) 

We ordered from the menu on this first visit, a predictable selection given their identity as a gastropub but nonetheless the fish and chips were perfectly cooked and the steak I ordered for myself was nothing short of orgasmic. (Sorry Jacob's)

It's not often a place makes such a powerfully good first impression, can't wait to pay them another visit."}
{"text":"The beer here is really great. I just wanted to write a review based on that alone. The food is yummy but on the pricier side, I think, for what it is. The burger is delicious but $16 is steep. The mac and cheese is something I'd recommend trying if you're in the mood for something rich, cheesy and savory with smoked bacon, mushroom, truffle, Asiago and parm.

But back to the beer. 

They don't have a million beers on tap but they have a very solid selection, often featuring at least one they've brewed themselves. The Habits saison is refreshing and well balanced, and the Rye'd for Wellspring, which I'm currently drinking, is just as delicious, with hops and subtle rye flavour. They have five on tap right now, and I hope to try them all before they run out. 

Also, the service here has never been anything but great for me. I really like the service. Super knowledgable and they'll have all of your questions answered whether it's about the beer, the food, or their extensive whiskey selection. 

I really like it here, the ambiance, the people, the grub and the boozed"}
{"text":"As part of 2015 Winterlicious, my boyfriend and I decided to come here for an early Valentine's Day dinner. 

The service was great, the draught beer selection was broad and local, and the meal was a good value at $25/person. The burger was particularly good, as were the sardines and the cheesecake. 

It would be too expensive to go to Habits regularly, but we will definitely be back as soon as we can!"}
{"text":"Wow. Food took ages and then was cold. Replaced after another long wait. Never even asked if I wanted to order a second drink or dessert. I expressed surprise to the front of house guy that there was no offer of anything to make up for the wait and the need to replace my food and was first told by him there was no need to make anything up as they had (eventually!) replaced the dish. I explained that it had been a long wait and was given a very reluctant 20% off. I'm a good restaurant goer- love to spend money in local establishments and am pretty easy to please - but I won't be back here again."}
{"text":"Simply stated, Habits is my favorite restaurant in Little Italy. Michelle and Luis are great hosts. The warmth of the atmosphere is matched by the warmth of the staff. There is live entertainment most nights starting at 9PM.
The kitchen is highly creative using, whenever possible, Ontario-native ingredients. While the standard menu offers plenty of tempting possibilities, there are special appetizers, entrees and desserts each evening that show off the imaginative approach of this aptly named \"gastropub\".

Since last September, I have probably eaten at Habits AT LEAST once a month and don't even live in Toronto full time!! I have NEVER had a bad meal there. It's way I keep going back."}
{"text":"As good as this place is already, I'm convinced it's only going to get better. Owners Luis and Michelle are keeping their pulse on what diners desire but are clearly putting their own confident, creative, and bold spin on everything from the menu to the unique house-made infusions and cocktails to the wine selection.

Carpaccio to start; my main gripe with most carpaccios, and perhaps my failing as an Italian cuisine enthusiast, is that I can't stand capers. This excellent version let the beautifully chosen and salty cheese take the role with aplomb. Crisp-fried onion bits were a magnificent compliment in texture and flavour. Top-end ingredients speak for themselves, and 'simple' does not mean 'plain'.

So-called 'crazy fries', fried sticks of polenta and mascarpone: I know I liked them, I'm just not sure how much. They were delightfully indulgent, but served without a dip which I feel they could have used, perhaps a gently spiced marinara. They were delicious just seemed to miss something to push them completely over the edge into outstanding, something which echos the restaurant itself. There's just something that hasn't quite clicked yet, though I have every faith they'll find it.

A roasted portugese-style sea bass; well flavoured, perfectly cooked, and a great deal at $17. Comparable dishes at other restaurants of this level will run a good ten dollars more, normally. Served with an incredible cilantro oil(!), roasted fingerling potatoes, and, oddly, a single brussel sprout.

Didn't try desserts but they look spectacular. Whiskeys and bourbons were thoughtfully purchased: anywhere that has Booker's is a place for good drinking to happen. Sixteen infusions sat behind the bar with even more in the fridge, not to mention several rare and delicious bitters. As I understand they are finalizing a new cocktail list with the help of a new, very talented bartender, though what descriptions I was given have me chomping at the bit to try the final forms. I was treated to a concoction of tequila, amaro, agave nectar, with a dash each of peach and whiskey aged bitters and finished with a burnt orange peel - just divine. Other home runs are a jalapeno-vodka caesar and a 'Canadian Mojito' with bacon-infused rye (works even better than it sounds), maple syrup, and blueberries. The pairing is perfect and execution to die for.

Forgive the pun but it has all the ingredients, passion and dedication to really emerge as a top-tier destination and fits very well with the Toronto dining scene."}
{"text":"First of all, I have to say that the service is great. Not just because I lit a menu on fire and the owner(?)/bartender/waiter was gracious about it but also because he remained rather friendly as I peppered him with questions about certain dishes. 

I don't think that cheap loose-leaf paper menus plus candles really mix but there is some great food here! (And I do love the smell of burning paper in the winter). 

The paper menus could mean that the food selection changes frequently.... so if you love seasonal foods as I do, that's a good sign. 

Regardless, this is a great place. I'd come back here."}
{"text":"Food very good for the price point. But the service was very bad. There were two different mistakes with our order neither of which were acknowledged or apologized for. When the first server made two mistakes the two servers on shift switched. Our new server suffered from bad body odour. Not a good sign. When we mentioned that the restaurant seemed to be shortstaffed they did not acknowledge that. Sadly overall I would not return.

P.S. They had a competent acoustic guitar duo whose music selection however was not ideally suited for dinner...maybe a funeral or a dance at a retirement home."}
{"text":"I wanted to give a 4.5 rating. I think this place is excellent. I decided to test it out and used a groupon which offered a price fixe menu. The service, drinks, food, ambience were fantastic. We weren't treated like 2nd class citizens just because we had a deal. We had gaspacho which was the best I have had in a long time, and a delicious shrimp app. We had the fish entree and a pork special not on the regular menu. Both were good. Desserts were delicious too. They have their own specialty draught beers which my husband really enjoyed. If you want a casual dinner with high quality food, give this spot a try. You wont be disappointed. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"short version:
This place was an interesting change compared to some of my more recent experiences on College St. A lot of places have had good food and mediocre service. In this case I'd go more on the side of great service and decent food.

long version:
We decided on this place on a recent Friday night based on wanting somewhere with a patio and I wanted to see what this place had been up to since we visited last when it first opened. The place itself seems better as they had some live music going on in the back later in the night and have set up a cool indoor meets outdoor seating section in the front end. 

We settled in and ordered some drinks, including some well priced craft-brewed pints on special. As we waited for our orders (it was a late dinner so didnt bother with apps) they were nice enough to offer us a sampler of their special app, a split pea gezpacho. My girlfriend enjoyed it but Im not much of a soup guy, let alone cold soup, so I'll save my comments. The fact they offered was impressive enough.

I decided to give the pulled pork sandwich another go remembering how good it was on my first visit. Sadly, I'm not sure if there is a new chef but this was a whole different experience. The pulled pork was okay but not the rich and tasty experience I remember it to be. It was supposed to have a homemade chipotle bbq sauce, but this had no tang to it as a typical chipotle flavoured anything should. It tasted more like some weak asian fusion pork. It was served on a weird bun that didnt fit the flavours and then served with \"chips\" which are a handful of really thick cut french fries (see pictures). I'm not a fan of thick cut fries as they lack any crispiness and are downright squishy in the middle. This was one of my most disappointing pulled pork experiences in some time, which is a big difference from when first quoting this place as the best pulled pork in the neighbourhood over some other well known bbq joints.

My dining counterpart had the Fried Chicken which actually came with a decent presentation, although a bit skimpy in the amount of actual potato salad received. The chicken received good marks including the comment \"it tastes healthy even though it's deep fried\". 

The service was top notch though. Friendly people who were quite on top of things throughout the night. Kudos to them."}
{"text":"Well, this place is just fantastic.  Discovered it around a year ago and was absolutely blown away by how good everything was.  This is the type of establishment that demonstrates that great chow does not have to be bundled with the bourgeois. No bourge here - just very high quality ingredients, effort, and taste impact.  And then there are the people that work there.  They're the type of folks that redeem faith in human kind.  Sound like hyperbole?  It's not.  They're smart, funny, modest, and want their patrons to have a good time and enjoy eating in a way that is truly a celebration for having a mouth.   Oh yeah - they also have a great selection of booze and local beers.  I like bourbon.  Yatta!"}
{"text":"We stumbled into this place on a random evening because it just happened to be not- so-busy on a Friday night  and it wasn't until my first bite of their smoked brie stuffed burger that I knew that this wasn't another sub par pub. I've been back three times since and had the burger every time and it did not disappoint. My friends tried the rabbit ragu and it was very decent also. The decor is decent but it's the burger that makes me want to go back."}
{"text":"We were in town for a quick over night. Relied on Yelp! to find something close, tasty, and not over booked. Habits fit the bill. The server was attentive, friendly, and helpful. The food was good but not memorable. If I lived in the area I'd certainly stop by again."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a drink one evening on their patio.  Super friendly people and nice atmosphere!

I have to note I used their washroom and it was surprisingly super nice.  Sorry, I know this is an odd thing to write about but so many places have horrible bathrooms in dungeon-like basements.  Habits' bathroom was like a spa!"}
{"text":"Abstolutely Fantastic!

We came to Habits for a friend's CD release party having no idea what to expect.  We were blown away by the fantastic food, wine, beer, atmosphere, service, etc.

The apple beignets!  Fantastic!  The oxtail ravioli!  Fantastic!  Everything else!  Fantastic.

And finding our friend Michelle from the HomeSmith Bar at the Old Mill!  Fantastic!

Habits will definitely be becoming a habit.  A most enjoyable habit!"}
{"text":"I've taken my time to review Habits as I've been wanting to make sure it lives up to my first wonderful experience there. I'm happy to say that half a dozen or more times later, it has. Don't let the work pub confuse you..this is an elegant, upscale pub - more gastro, less pub. I've been looking for a new local in my neighbourhood and this might just be the place.

The decor is lovely - warm brick wall, a rectanglar shaped room with bar, open style kitchen leading to another smaller bar and dance floor/stage area. Tables range from large group table to smaller and taller 4 tops with nice comfortable padded stools. Flickering candlelight and well placed lights make the ambience inviting and not too dark.

There is a large selection of beers and wines, they make a good martini as well! My favourite vodka is the organic grass one from...Oregon? I might have that wrong but ask them, they'll know what I mean :-) They source local beers and wines and pair them with food offerings.

The food! Is delicious! Also seasonally and locally designed there is love in their food. Spinning typical pub dishes into mouth watering entrees is their specialty. They serve an amuse bouche which is usually quite lovely - they've even come to know I'm a vegetarian and serve me something different if their general offering is meaty. My bf swears they make the best fried chicken in the city - and believe me he's quite a connossieur! Fish and chips are delicious as is the risotto, fish special, mac and cheese, octopus appetizer, oysters on the halfshell, you name it, if its on the menu, its good. And often rich. And...which is my only criticism, a touch on the salty side. I've found it more than once to be a bit too salty for me and I love salt. But perhaps that's to get you to try more of their inviting beer and wine list :-)

Not a ton of options for a vegetarian but they are happy to alter many of the dishes to be veggie friendly. There are also lots of sides that could be combined to make a delicious meal - its on my list to try doing that one of these times I go. 

Prices are mid-range. Entree's average around $20. The care they take in their ingredients and preparation are worth it. 

Music is often happening in the back - sometimes live, sometimes dj'd. I found it a touch loud for my taste but perhaps I'm just getting old and the crowd that would come later than my dessert might have thought it perfect. 

Open just over a year now, they have a really good thing going. Don't overlook this gem. And on my first try I checked in on yelp to find you get 10% off food on your first visit which they honoured no problem. Great for a date, night with friends or parents, or business drink/dinner. Low key but elegant. Try it, you'll agree, they've got something special here."}
{"text":"After doing an extensive search looking for the best Caesar in Toronto, I ended up at Habits Gastropub.   

Was it the best Caesar in Toronto? No - but the jalepeno infused vodka was yummy and it comes by the pitcher!

Was it worth the trek here? YES!  Let me tell you why....

1) The service. From the moment we stepped through the door we were greeted and made to feel as if this was our home.  Friendly, knowledge-able, accomodating.... Fantastic!

2) The beverage list is long and exotic. They have taken all of the traditional favorites and given them each a unique \"twist\" (like the jalepeno infused vodka in the caesar, lavendar infused rum in their Mai Tai and Appleton Rum and maple syrup in the mojito) 
After finishing our pitcher of Caesars we moved on to sample many. My favorite? The Negroni containing house-infused ginger gin, Cinzano, Campari, house-made bitters, flamed orange zest. YUM!  

We were also told if we had a favourite flavor or ingredient they could custom make drinks on the spot!  I challenge you to put this to the test. We did and sampled many amazing concoctions!

3) The food - We started with sweet potato fries, grilled calamari (lemon-garlic marinade, buttered rapini, roasted tomato, basil-caper dressing), and nachos (La Tortilleria chips, braised beef, roma tomatoes, smoked cheddar, shredded iceberg, jalapeños, basil-lime crème fraîche).  All of the portion sizes are large! Great for sharing.  

I was told I had to try the Burger (smoked brie stuffed in Ontario certified Black Angus beef, puttanesca relish, pancetta, house-made spicy aioli, crispy onions, hand-cut fries, Fred's brioche) and was not disappointed. One of the best I have had in this city. Cooked just enough not to meet city safety standards, but not too much to make it dry/hard.  The combination of toppings had me worried it would be overwhelming - but they all worked together to give a nice balance of creamy yet flavorful.  And the bun was soft and yummy. Good ratio of bun to burger to toppings (its a large mouthful!).

This place is a bit of a trek for me - not my usual area but I will be back here for sure to continue to make my way through the menu and challenge the bartender to mix up more unique concoctions!"}
{"text":"The food here is overpriced, and short on taste! The poutine was terrible. The fish and chips were tasteless. I was rather disappointed with this gastropub. Presentation was lovely, but I can't give it much credit for anything else."}
{"text":"It was with much hesitancy that my lunch date and I finally settled down at Habits, so perhaps that is why we were so happy with the decent food. It was a late weekday afternoon and as per what seems to be usual, (as we had each separately noted), the long high top lined restaurant was completely empty. Given the choice, we opted for the prime people watching seats up by the front window. The extra large wooden tabletop was most excellent for spreading out our newspaper.

My mac and cheese ($9 for a very filling half order) was unappealingly topped with a purple (edible?) flower and would have been much more accurately described as a carbonara with mushrooms. It was extremely rich and creamy (and therefore very tasty), but not anything close to what one would expect when a mac and cheese is ordered. My date's fish and chips ($13 for one piece) featured a perfectly juicy on the inside and delicately crispy on the outside haddock filet, tangy lemon aioli, chunky potato wedges, and an attractively colourful, but overwhelmingly oniony side of slaw.

Besides it being so empty all of the time, it's frankly a big turn off that they charge $2.50 for each small glass of pop instead of just giving you complimentary refills. The service was pleasant from start to finish though. I probably wouldn't hesitate to come back to try some of their seafood appetizers like grilled sardines, marinated octopus, or calamari over drinks."}
{"text":"You know how much I love giving well-deserved 5-star reviews? Well, you dunno nothing!

Habits, is worth every corner of every star and then some. Yes, you have to wait for your food for some time, but only because it's all freshly prepared to order. The waitress was very knowledgeable and made some good suggestions, including some good tasting craft brews. I absolutely loved the beet and arugula salad, just delish!
I suppose menu changes frequently hence there is no point of describing everything we had, but my tip would be to order specials and try as many dishes you can, they are all incredible! 
If that amazing food haven't lifted you to the 9th cloud, head to Emmet Ray next door and shoot some whiskey, that will do the trick for sure."}
{"text":"Chili Cesar was good and the house made chips with guacamole was a great free treat. We ordered the fish soup, soup de jour which was nostalgic. Overall we enjoyed ourselves."}
{"text":"Really great quality food (the burger and deep fried chicken are amazing), exceptional service, and nice ambiance. Have been here twice and will definitely come back. Looks like a generic pub from the outside but it's actually a really nice restaurant and not over priced for the quality of food you get."}
{"text":"After being laughed out of Bar Isabel for not having reservations... 

Had a great evening at Habits. Ordered the fried chicken and corn - it was delicious. The jalapeño/cheese bisquit it comes with was super soft and piping hot. And the sauce.... the sweet heat of the sauce that comes with the chicken is like icing. It's crazy amazing. 

We sat in the front window, watched the sights (mostly just attractive westenders walking by), had a few drinks, and I can honestly say I'm not that heartbroken I didn't get to go to Bar Isabel. It can wait. ;)"}
{"text":"Rising from the ashes of Estrelo do Mar (not literally) is a new spot called Habits Gastropub. It's yet another addition to the area around College and Dovercourt where the nights are getting livelier. This restaurant serves as an excellent option for dinner with a concise one-page menu and wine list to match.

With a trio of lamps illuminating their sign, Habits wants to be noticed. The hanging plants and wide open French doors invite you in. Save for their shiny terrazzo floor the decor is pretty understated, but they compensate by being enormous. The restaurant curves all the way around their open kitchen, and there are seats everywhere. Because they weren't too busy on their opening weekend, I snagged a spot near the front enjoying the fresh air from College street.

Like their Portuguese predecessor Habits has an array of seafood on the menu. Some appetizers include grilled sardines, mussels, and calamari and there are a few whole grilled fish as mains. My and the DC shared a half pound of PEI mussels ($12) and a vegetable carpaccio ($9) served with this crazy good truffle vinaigrette and smoked salt. Awesome. The mussels were good also, but served with a very disappointing cornbread. I'd have preferred white bread instead, and that's a strong statement.

The prices here are pretty reasonable with mains averaging about $18. I ordered the morel ravioli which was topped with chevre and asparagus and my DC opted for the pappardelle with tiger shrimp. Mine was decidedly better. Very light and the greens were fresh and really crispy. Conversely, the shrimps in the papardelle weren't that exciting, and the pasta was kind of heavy.

This place has promise and I will surely return. A few other items on the menu looked tempting, especially their fish and chips battered with Beau's beer. They also are offering a $5 opening special for Muskoka pints. A nice touch to support some local brews. 

Obligatory Title Pun: New HABITS try hard.

Menu Readability: Times roman on a speciality paper obtained from Staples. Tsk, tsk.

Need to mention: Their wine glasses are frosted with their name. I can't decide if this is tacky or not.

What this place teaches me about myself: I just know what to pick on a menu. Call it a gift? Maybe it's \"THE SHINING.\""}
{"text":"Was here with a group of eight.  I had the octopus which I was looking forward to but was unfortunately over cooked and disappointing.  It was accompanied by greens which were quite good and fresh.   I tried the mac and cheese which I liked but was more of an Alfredo.  The clincher for me on the two star rating was a refusal to split the bill and having offered no warning beforehand.  I'd never return with a group again.  If you are going to have a policy like that, it is important to state up front."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. It's close to home, live music and casual vibe. 

My boyfriend and I meet on College St originally to go to Emmet Ray. They were packed, so we shuffled back and forth between a couple places and decided on Habits. I was drawn in by the sandwich board advertising \"Blues & Troubles\". Sounds like some good live music. It definitely was. We were impressed by the drink offerings. A good, curated selection of beer on draught as well as in bottles.  A lot of delicious liquors for connoisseurs plus a slew of well-thought out and obscure cocktails. 

We decided to share a Caesar pitcher which was delicious, but definitely on the spicy side. Would definitely be great with food!!!

The only reason I might not return is because we were there for approximately an hour and a half and were basically ignored. After we got our pitcher, we were abandoned. We weren't asked how our drinks were. Nor asked if we wanted anything else(which we did. I wanted to try the vegas fries!!!) or later on if we wanted anything else to drink. NA DA. My boyfriend had to go to the bar and literally ask for our bill and had to ask again to pay. 

I was just really disappointed by the lack of attention or acknowledgement. Especially since we would have gotten more but we weren't really served or attended too. On top of that, when we were ignored the most, was when the place was half empty. 

Like I said, I wanted to like this place but when customer service falls short, it leaves a bad taste. 

Bummer."}
