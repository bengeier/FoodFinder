The waitress was friendly and attentive. We ordered cocktails and it was sooo good! I definitely would recommend to check this place out."}

{"text":"Excellent Sinaloa seafood restaurant !! Mariscos La  Lomita de Culiacan is a hidden gem off of Cheyenne and Losee. The servings are huge and everything is made fresh . I had the shrimp and pineapple ceviche served in a half of a pineapple and an agua mineral preparada which is really refreshing soda water with lime and the rim had Tajin on it . It went really nice with the ceviche. We also shared a quesadilla and steak . There are so many exotic dishes that you can't really find on traditional Mexican menus. The cuisine is rather unique in this corner of Mexico , utilizing the Sea of Cortez and Pacific Ocean as inspiration , there is much more abundance of seafood . Very fresh seafood . They use tropical fruits as well, next time I want to try the ceviche in the coconut . The servers were very accommodating and friendly . Lunch rush was very busy and it's always a good sign . The music was very nice too! I felt like I was on vacation on the beaches of Sinaloa. Please check it out if you have a chance !!!"}
{"text":"La comida mas rica de mariscos en un lugar escondido pero la comida esta sabrosa se lo recomiendo a quien sea !"}
{"text":"If you love Micheladas...I highly recommend La Lomita's!! They're sooo good! I crave them!! It literally makes my mouth water thinking about it!   My fav dish is the Aguachiles! It's raw shrimp that's drenched in a salsa and lime juice, so the acidity from the juice cooks the shrimp. They serve it with cucumbers and avocado...but I always ask for extra cucumbers! Because every bite is so tasty with the cucumber!   The staff is always welcoming and so attentive. This place is definitely a hidden gem! It literally is 5 mins from my house and I always drove by it, wondering...so I finally talked my boyfriend into going and we are so glad we did! If you love seafood spots like this one! Please give La Lomita a try! You can not go wrong! Especially if you love micheladas as much as I do! They're definitely on point here!"}
{"text":"Love the Mariscos!!  Great food portions..the best seafood restaurant in Nevada.  The Micheladas are to die for... highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"The food looks good online  me wife and I came walked in the place is really small there is literally like 4 tables  they were all occupied we walked away."}
{"text":"First time here didn't think much of it. Until I stepped in exceptional customer service and best food! A must come to for Mexican food."}
{"text":"Best seafood and michelada place in Vegas! Need a picker upper this place will do the job. The customer service was amazing. Both waitresses were very attentive. Portions are huge way more than we expected. The salsas are also so good that we purchased some to take back to Cali. If i could give more stars it'd def be 10! #bombdiggity"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of mariscos (Mexican sea food) and had heard of this place so decided to give it a try. It's a very small restaurant. There's probably a total of 8 tables. But the establishment was very clean. I had a michelada which was very good! One of the best I've had. And for appetizer I had their seafood guacamole which was AMAZING! For my plate I had their lomita ceviche which was spicy! But I love spicy so it was perfect for me! I will take one star off due to the server not being 5 star. We had to keep waiving her down anytime we needed anything. Over all I loved it and will be returning."}
{"text":"After hearing about this place I decided to give it a try, needless to say pescado tostadas r delicious their \"malecón\" preparadas are amazingly tasty however this place is tiny, literally a whole in the wall also the shrimp is not clean that's why I opted for the fish tostadas yet my husband got the shrimp one and the juice to it was really flavorful. Oh and the young lady was very attentive fast and friendly."}
{"text":"I just tried this place out, it was delish. The mariscoco was refreshing. It is a must try!!  El mariscoco estava muy rico. Deven de provar este lugar!"}

{"text":"Loved this place..it's a bit small, but great customer service and food was delicious. Wish I would've taken pictures to post, but didn't. We had some yummy oyster shots and preparadas. Mom and Aunt ordered limonadas and they were like slushies. So I ordered one too!! I really recommend this place.. Next time... I'll take the hubby and child!"}
{"text":"Loved this place. Everything I ordered was fresh and tasty. The food had good flavor development and everything came out at the right temperature."}

{"text":"Food was good customer service was great plan on come back price was fare also had food for the baby small dish"}
{"text":"I had shrimp civiche and a Marilyn Quesadilla, my wife had Costa Azul Shrimp. All the food was fresh and good but not delicious. We were there at lunch time on a Saturday and the place was packed, the servers were very friendly but the service was slow, they didn't have enough people.  I think the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"We don't know of any places like this close by and it's just down the street so we decided to stop in for lunch. It's located on the industrial part of Losee where an old burger joint used to be. This is SO much better! The menu looked really interesting and the photos were appetizing on Yelp, so that's what brought us in.  Our server was super awesome! To be clear, subtracting a star had absolutely nothing to do with service. She was so great and attentive the entire time. We ordered this trio with shrimp ceviche, fish ceviche and cooked octopus and shrimp as well as a dozen oysters. I absolutely LOVE oysters but not these ones. My husband didn't mind them, but they didn't seem fresh. The outer shell was still dirty. The texture was way off and they were almost room temp. I am really hoping I don't get sick later. There was something that was just off about them. I'm hoping it was just a fluke but next time I'll follow my instincts and get the guac. The trio was fantastic though! I have not one bad word to say about it. Our server brought plenty of tostadas, a little cup of salsa (which was fantastic- nice and spicy, but not too spicy), and this cup of shrimp broth that was great too.  One more thing, the entire menu is in Spanish.. But she was totally willing to help us out, although I do think they'd benefit from having an English translation or version of the menu for the sake of others who can't stumble their way through it. Overall, not a bad first experience. I hope they stick around!"}
{"text":"Great food, but never know when it's open. Really love to eat here but every time I get a big party group it's closed."}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place. Location is not great.  The food is just ok. Very expensive for what you get.  I can make better for much cheaper at home."}
{"text":"The wife and I were looking for a good ceviche dish and used Yelp to find this \"off the beaten path\" marisco restaurant.  It is small but clean and welcoming inside.  The waitress is friendly and helpful as she helped us order our ceviche dishes.  We settled on a shrimp and octopus ceviche dish with Mexican Coca-Cola.  The ceviche was very good-tangy with lime juice and full of shrimp and pulpo.   They have many other marisco dishes that look tempting to try and their menu has a lot of food pictures to show what you are getting.  We highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"This place has yummy seafood & at a reasonable price. The caldo 7 mares(small pic) was a little disappointing because it had too many bell peppers & onions but I still give it a 6/10... the \"botana tropical\" (big pic) was a 7/10- it was definitely very tropical & full of shrimp."}
{"text":"Exciting and creative menu and awesome micheladas, but ultimately the food was just average.   After driving 30 minutes specifically to check it out,  we are not likely make a return trip."}
{"text":"Just tried this spot out!  It was so delicious and fresh!  Loved it!    The little oyster shooters were to die for. Also had the tostada la lomita ---mouth watering!!   So excited this place is down the street from my work. I will probably be here everyday for lunch!"}
{"text":"Came out here on a Saturday morning. Ordered a dozen oysters and Large cocktail with everything.. We chow it all down in 15 mins.. Good as it gets. Fresh and wholesome!! My wife never tried real Mexican seafood. Going back there for sure.. Little hard to find... but just slow down a little"}
{"text":"Really highly recommend this place. The coctel that I got was really good. Definitely coming back..."}
{"text":"Being s los angeles native looking  for mariscos for the hang over I'm very picky about my mariscos but this place has great service and the food is fresh and delicious. I would highly recommend. The waitress have nice fat bootys"}
