{"text":"After recently moving, and trying a slice of pizza from a downtown location, I have to say that I'm going to miss living close to Ab King. The thing I love about their pizza is that they have perfected the sauce, the cheesy texture, and the cornmeal crust. They keep the pizza  basic which is something I love about the magical art of Pizza. Their delivery service is actually pretty amazing too, as they have very friendly service. The best combination is pepperoni and bacon, with siracha added, or just cheese. You might not like this pizza if your prefer deep dish, but if you love the kind of pizza you could just eat slice after slice and watch it disappear then I suggest AB King."}
{"text":"as a BUDGET pizza joint AB is phenomenal. You can get a full 10' pizza with one topping and can of soda for $6. Additional soda is $1 and the pizza is fresh and tastes great. However, it is a budget pizza shop, so if you're looking for something that tastes like Pizza Hut, go to Pizza Hut. BBQ chicken is a pineridge favourite"}
