{"text":"On April 6th my friends from the 'hood were gathering for HH and we selected the Bevvy because of the great reputation of the Scottsdale location.  We sat on the patio and all of us commented on the great decor and atmosphere + it was a beautiful breezy evening.  HH drink specials were good and reasonable and we ordered a sampling of food.  The chicken wings looked like they came out of a microwave.  There was no color or crispiness on the skin and although I asked for sauce on the side, they looked like they were tossed in a bowl with Franks hot sauce - not edible.  My friend ordered salmon and ate half.  She said it was mushy and tasteless so I tried it and I totally agreed.  The green pork flatbread had HUGE pieces of pickled red onion underneath the pork that it ruined the entire dish.  The chicken quesadilla was good but not good enough to come back for.  I don't know who was in the kitchen that night but it's doubtful we will return because there are just TOO many great restaurants and food options within a mile or 2.  Service was prompt and friendly.  Come on peeps step it up - if you want to keep the doors open at a new restuarant - serve decent food."}
{"text":"My original review accidentally posted to the wrong location! See pic lol great experience, nice servers, amazing atmosphere. The perfect spot for Phoenix"}
{"text":"I admittedly waited way too long to write this review, but wanted to do so nevertheless.  We came for Sunday brunch a little over a month ago. Honestly, probably wouldn't come back.  They supposedly had a \"very large party\" on the outside patio, so for some reason they squeezed 8 of us (we're a group of mostly... larger guys) into a booth near the front. The servers kept saying that they would bring extra chairs, but never did. In fact, another friend showed up to join us, and ended up leaving, because there was no room in the already tight booth. Again, understood that there was a large party outside, but I could not see any reason that we had to be crammed into the booth instead of moving some tables around...I can honestly say that we would've waited longer to sit if that was done.

The food, was...ok, but so haphazardly out of control.  Obviously all of the staff was being used for this \"party\" and no one had any clue what was coming from where... the brunch \"shared appetizer\" policy was never made clear, and honestly was very confusing... food was coming out at all random times, most of the appetizers came after the main courses (some of which were obviously forgotten about) and in the end, I don't even recall if we had gotten all of the appetizers in the end... we just wanted to get up at that point.

The drinks were really good - my Bloody Mary was phenomenal, but I really hope y'all can get the kinks worked out... my friends raved about this place, having been there for dinner previously, but, honestly, I was really not impressed."}
{"text":"It's a fun and non fancy environment. The service was friendly and helpful. I young vibe but allows for all ages to enjoy hip music and cool beverages. If you have any children I recommend going before 8 because after the 9 o'clock hour it morphs into a cool adult playground specially on Fridays and Saturday. Food is plentiful and tasty, my personal favorite is the braised short rib flatbread. The patio area is large and full of TVs with games like Jinga and old school arcade games. The libations are well made and mixed correctly. Kelsy, Rachel and Brian are amazing behind the bar. Shareable cocktails like the Mango monster mule are awesome for your entourage. It's an overall great spot to meet friends an grab something to eat and drink."}
{"text":"We went the weekend it opened for brunch. Ambiance was light and even though they had a limited menu it was delicious. We thought we found a new great job place. Decided to go back this time for dinner. Huge mistake!  Nighttime turns into a bar with food. We waited at the bar for a table for about and hour & 15 min.   They finally gave us a high top under all the speakers.  So we tried our luck again for brunch.  Besides being incredibly loud, the menu had changed and wasn't that good.  Who the hell wants to have music blaring at them on a Sunday morning?   Not my scene I guess."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and has a great happy hour. Does get pretty crowded fast especially during peak hrs. Nice to throw some back and blackout."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I frequent the uptown restaurant corridor and were excited to check out one of the new editions. We were quickly seated on the patio as requested. The patio is full of plush booths and high-tops (with brand new flat screens hanging above). The patio was the best part of our trip. The service was quick, but there was nothing distinct about the food. Granted, I probably should have ordered more traditional bar food, but then menu hyped the shakshuka (a personal fav). My fiancé had the chicken n waffle wings. Presentation was good, but not sure I would order either again. The beer selection is broad, and we had drink envy from the tables around us. Willing to give this place a try again, if nothing else to play the table games provided from your childhood."}
{"text":"Boy, the amazing service of Casa Anejo still seems to be haunting this place. Decided to stop in this past weekend on our bike bar tour. First and last, yet again.  

Menu is laughably uninventive. All the same shit you can get anywhere within a 1 mile radius. It's almost like they just copied and pasted parts of Camp Social, Joyride, Windor and Phoenix Ale's menus and stuck them on the same page. 

Beer list is total garbage. A half full kiddie pool sitting outside in the middle of August has more depth than their list. House cocktails are meh, and apparently it's a bridge too far to request a shareable cocktail in an individual glass. Are they premade or something? Are the bartenders unable to divide by 3?

Oh, and the service. I reckon bad service is what killed Casa Anejo after less than year, and the same inattentive, dismissive, bullshit service is alive and well at Bevvy. It was moderately busy around 9pm, but you'd think you were at the DMV during peak hours rather than a place serving $12 drinks with the way the bartenders acted. The girls nearly wore a trench in the floor walking in front of where we were sitting at the bar, but never bothered to take a drink order until we'd been there for 7 minutes. Same deal when we finally received and finished our drinks; no one ever came around and asked if we'd like to order food or another round. 

Big pass on this one. Unless you're amused by spending too much money and a few lame arcade games, what's the point? Better service, better beer and better food all over this part of town."}
{"text":"Cool vibe and outdoor seating.  Service was absolutely horrible.  Ordered chips and 3 dip combo.  Came with very few and we asked for more chips three times.  Each time we were told sure.  They never came.  Had to ask for our bill twice.  Disappointing because it has potential."}
{"text":"Christian was a fantastic server/bartender! Very knowledgeable and attentive. My wife and I came in for a quick app and drinks after a long weekend of work and he made our experience great. Thank you Bevvy!"}
{"text":"I got the bam bam fries and it was not good. Who wants soggy fries? I certainly don't. Also less than an hour later I was on the toilet with a horrible stomachache. A friend of mine had the 60/40 burger and was up all night throwing up. Good job, Bevvy. We're not coming back."}
{"text":"We stopped in to check out the place. Great happy hour with 1/2 price specialty drinks as well as beer/wine specials. Also some food items $3 off. I had the muscle bowl which was tasty. Tony had wings which were way too spicy. The bar has tv everywhere causing a sensory overload. That combined with the music would be fine if it were just by yourself but no way to have a conversation. Overall an improvement over the last place but still will opt to go to other places in the area"}
{"text":"Unusual weekend bunch menu. There are the norms--burgers and a waffle w chicken. There are sports bar finger foods and then a few with middle eastern flair. I tried the muscle-bowl that has pork and an assortment of grains w hummus on the side. I think I would add a slice of middle eastern bread to the mix, but overall quite good. My husband had a casserole with some sort of stewed tomatoes and an egg on top. He said the tomatoes were flavorful but the dish needed something else---another layer. The restaurant was loud and there were janga game tables, which doesn't help the noise level. Our server, a young guy, was extremely attentive and friendly. He would make any quest happy because he is just so positive. This is a new restaurant on the competitive 7th Street near Stock & Stable. There is outdoor seating and many drink specials."}
{"text":"The service was quick and friendly - just how it should be!  Excited to find a great place to eat out with non-vegan friends.  The only thing better than the \"impossible burger\" is the \"impossible tacos\"!  From one vegan to another, they don't disappoint!"}
{"text":"Such a great addition to all the new establishments popping up in Uptown! Walked over to Bevvy after dinner next door at Stock & Stable. It was St Patrick's Day and the bowl of Lucky Charms on the bar was a cute touch. Service was top notch, drinks were great and reasonably priced. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"2nd time in this week.  So impressed with this place.  Our waitress Duuha remembered us from the last time and even remembered that my husband loves yellow mustard with his Tots!  Great staff.  Super friendly exactly how it should be.  We felt so welcome hence the reason we came back 3 days later!! Trinity was training tonight with Duuha she was doing great!!  Manager Justin came over to see how we were doing.we love when management checks in on us.  The Bevvy burger was so yummy.  Perfectly cooked.  They get their beef from Arcadia meats.  Super quality products. The first time we were in I had the vegetable flatbread.  Also wonderful.  You guys are doing a great job.  Great happy hour too!  You will see us often.  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I am so thrilled there is a Bevvy in my neck of the woods! I have been here on a Sunday morning for brunch and a Friday night for drinks and both times have been a great experience. When I came for brunch, they hadn't started their full brunch menu yet, so I can't say much to that, but the service was great. Both my friend and I ordered frittatas and as we were waiting, the waitress came by and apologized for the long wait time and offered to make one of the meals free. We didn't think the wait time was anything to complain about, but we were ecstatic for the free meal. The frittata was yummy and big enough for a second meal the next day. 

I came back on a Friday night with a few friends and barely had to wait to order our drinks. There were quite a few people, but it wasn't too busy that you had to wait for service. Our waitress was super friendly and accommodating. We sat on one of the outdoor couches on the patio and a few of us played Jenga which is always a fun game when having a few drinks and hanging out with friends. Super friendly staff and great atmosphere. Lots of seating and large patio which is a huge plus since I always love to sit outside. Plenty of TVs inside and out to watch sports or Chive TV. I think this will definitely be my go-to place for drinks with friends and also brunch. $15 unlimited mimosas!"}
{"text":"Night started out great. Got there around 6:30 seated immediately and the crowd was of a mix. Family, elder, young, professional. Was able to watch the games and have conversations. But.. once the game was over and it hit 8-8:30 the LOUD club music began. Personally we moved to Arcadia/Biltmore instead of  Scottsdale/old town to get that more upscale class of people and less of the college crowd. Guess after 8 we will be headed to Stock and Stable. Not the worst option.
Besides that the food was great, the staff were friendly (little scattered due to grand opening and being a Saturday I assume). My one advice for a more efficient staff would be: ask the whole table for drink refills on one trip instead of 3. Bring the beer glass with the beer instead of asking after you drop off the beer. Would save time and trips to focus on other tables! 
We will be back just not after 8. (Unless I have a bachelorette party or pub crawl)"}
{"text":"Sunday fun day! Amazing breakfast/brunch spot with all you can drink mimosa or bloody Mary's. Must have a DD or ride plan for this spot so you can enjoy the music of the pianist and have a good time with friends."}
{"text":"We stopped in for brunch yesterday and had a blast!  Lively atmosphere, great patio and bottomless mimosas...but with a catch!  

We made a reservation for 10:30 and when we were seated were told we could only have the table for 2 hours.  That should have been mentioned when I made the reservation and especially when you say brunch is from 10 to 4 with bottomless mimosas and bloody marys.

Our server was great, the food was ok and the mimosas were tasty.  Overall decent experience, but they need to be more transparent about their policies up front, so proper expectations can be set for their customers.  They also need to space out delivering the all you can eat shareable plates...ours didn't arrive until after our entrees - kind of defeats the purpose.  Hopefully they'll get all the kinks worked out and become a go to place for brunch in the city!"}
{"text":"Food is great I thought the impossible burger was only in California. However it's not! It's right here at Bevvy and it's amazing! Thanks for the great food and top shelf atmosphere. I will be coming here again and I can't wait. I recommend it for anyone who is in the area and wants a bite to eat or something to drink. The drink list is more then extensive and the bar girls take care of you :)"}
{"text":"I visited this place with my family just trying to find a place to watch the NBA playoffs. I wasn't expecting much, but from beginning to end I had an amazing experience. My server Chrissy was very attentive and kind! We ordered the Green Chile Pork flatbread and the 60/40 burger with a few modifications and it came out perfect and timely! I would definitely recommend this place for all people, from families to friends going out for a drink! Awesome job Bevvy Uptown!"}
{"text":"Just had some food here. Really not impressed. Actually still sitting here trying to pay the bill. Several people greeted us and no one took the table. One guy just came by and picked up 1 plate? Not the CC, not even the rest of dirty dishes. Sloppy fries. Rarely do this, but this was very underwhelming. Hope I get the bill soon as I want to leave."}
{"text":"I Was recommended by many friends that live near by . Also came for the unlimited mimosas wish was a bonus . I put my name to get a table of 3 in which they told me 30 min , which for a new restaurant I was willing to try . I put my name down and patiently waited for a text . I show up about an hour later and still no reply and the waiter explained that nobody had left which is hard to justify as I kept seeing people come in and out . After an hour and a half I left and just went to the culinary drop out , had a full meal a drink with  still no word on a table. 3 hours later I get a reply that table had opened ? I have never in a million years have waited 3  hours to get a table ever not even at the busiest place  . I'm not sure what kind of service they are running but never coming again, terrible service ."}
{"text":"Holy buckets!! When I say amazing food I mean AMAZING food. The manager Heather is incredible which you don't find managers as attentive and friendly anymore. We will be back, probably tomorrow ha! Thanks for a great experience!"}
{"text":"Have been here several times with large groups and it's always good fun. The drinks are good and the atmosphere is very friendly. We had Vincent as our server last Saturday and he was very attentive. We had a party of 15 and never had to wait for service. He remembered everyone's name and drink and was very organized. I was highly impressed! He did such a great job"}
{"text":"Cool spot. We were only there for about an hour. Decor is sweet, the music was fun, crowd was definitely older. Great time"}
{"text":"Welcome to the neighborhood! Stopped by on a whim Sunday night and so glad we did...definitely going to be one of our regular spots now! Delicious food and the Mango Mule was AMAZING...not to mention great atmosphere and they have Jenga! 

Every staff member was awesome and made our night that much better :)"}
{"text":"Great food and fun vibes.  Met friends for Sunday brunch.  What a perfect spot.  We ate, enjoyed bottomless mimosas and listened to the DJ spin the tunes.  Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Awesome spot happy to have it in the neighborhood! Been for happy hour and for brunch! The party brunch is so fun! We went to one of the first weeks they did it so there were some kinks but was still a great time and I'm sure it's even better now! Happy hour was great! Lots of options! I also loved the Caesar salad and the French fries. And the funnel fries for dessert were amazing"}
{"text":"Chef Paul is the man.  The food is out of this world and he's charming AF.  Come eat immediately, especially these bomb ass waffle wings."}
{"text":"I'm updating my review. We went back to Bevvy because we were so pleased with our first visit. Let me tell you it was a day and night experience. The staff didn't seem to be checking on any of the customers. They were chatting with what seemed to be the manager.. they were neglecting their customer to the point where a gentleman got up to go get his check from the bar because he had been waiting so long. Table was sticky. Drinks were not refilled. Food was very disappointing and we both get up getting food poisoning. I'm really sad to say we most likely won't be back when we thought we found a new favorite spot."}
{"text":"I don't normally post reviews, but the service here was so appalling I felt it was necessary.
Horrible 1st experience at the Bevvy Uptown for brunch. We have been here 30 minutes and our waitress has not taken our order. Our friends have been here for over an hour and just received their order, which was not complete. They order fresh fruit with granola and potatoes. The fruit was delivered, but it didn't appear fresh and the granola never came out. When we asked about the granola we were told it was right behind the fruit. It never came. There was also an order of the nachos, but the nachos, after waiting an hour, were delivered burnt with a small amount of shredded cheese sprinkled on top. The chips were actually black from being burnt. We sent them back. I'm not sure why anyone would put that poor representation of a menu item on a table. Our friends asked for the manager and they are still waiting for the manager to stop by after 20 minutes. The service was so bad we decided to leave. I would assume they would be more prepared for a Sunday brunch, but apparently my assumptions were incorrect."}
{"text":"Stopped in to celebrate one of my gal pal's birthday bashes.   Check out the HH menu, tried the $15/bottle HH wine.   UGHHHH!   No.  Decided on the Uptown Buzzword on the HH menu, and my gal pal had Grey Goose up -- not on the HH menu.   Not bad at all at $6, and the Grey Goose is priced at $10, which isn't bad either.  

We decided on the wings and quesadilla from the HH menu.   The wings come with four different dips (pictured) and the quesadilla with two (pictured).   The wings were crisp and flavorful, and the dips gave it that added punch.   A couple of the dips are HOT.   The quesadilla was quite good as well; presentation pleasing, and the one dip (the green) was REALLY spicy hot.   

We sat at the bar, and I believe our bartender/server is Standee.   Is that his name??   He was pleasant and professional and helpful. 

I have been checking out places to have my birthday bash with my gal pals.   I think Bevvy is my pick.   I like to try new places.   Perhaps we will head to the Scottsdale Bevvy to check their location.   Going to HH with my friends from around the Phoenix area, Bevvy Uptown is where I'll be."}
{"text":"Happy hour here is amazing! The cocktails are so cheap and delicious to boot! I ordered the blue balls to drink and I liked it so much I stuck to it the entire time I was there. The blue balls is a blueberry mule. It is subtly sweet with a blueberry flavor. It was refreshing and I enjoyed it. I was worried when I saw that it had stoli in it that it was going to be too sweet and artificial tasting, but it wasn't. I think all the other components in the drink definitely rounded the drink off well and made it taste just right. If you don't like fruity or sweet, you may still like this drink. When I looked at the menu again before we left, I regreted not trying a bunch of other drinks but I guess that will be before a later date. 

For food, my friend and I ordered the chicken wings in sriracha honey bbq extra crispy and the braised short rib flatbread to share. The flat bread during happy hour does not have French fries on it. We were expecting the French fries since we didn't read the description and that was a bit disappointing. The flatbread had a little bit of saltiness to it and was crisp. The braised short rib was delicious. I really didn't like the cheddar cheese. I'm not sure that was the best option for cheese, especially for when it started to cool off and congeal. Maybe a soft, white, spreadable cheese would have been a better option? Like a garlic herb of some sort? While they're at it maybe some caramelized onions? LOL maybe rethink the flatbread a bit. The chicken wings were perfect. They were cooked extra crispy how we wanted them. You could hear the crunch as we bit into the wings. They had great flavor, which was a little sweet, savoy, salty, and spicy. It was a balanced combo. 

The atmosphere here was fun with games at the tables like monkeys in a barrel and jenga. They even have a Ms. Pacman machine when you first come in at the entrance. I would definitely come back and recommend others to give them a try."}
{"text":"If you want to show up and sit at the bar and not get service - go to this place!

Get here and sit at the bar - waiting and waiting and waiting approx 5 minutes, but none of the bartenders ask what I would like to drink or comes up to introduce them self

A Person sits at seat next to me on the corner and one of the bartenders asks him what he wants to drink and what he has been drinking - bartender makes his beer and comes back with it and hands it to Home, but then leaves and doesn't approach me!

After sitting for little while longer with no interaction from bartenders or being asked what I would like to drink I got up told the guy I've been sitting there and no one has come to me and left - DO NOT go here!!!"}
{"text":"Went here because the food looked great and I liked it when I went to the location in Scottsdale.  We went there Friday April 6th @ 5 PM.  Took a little while for someone to come get our drink order.  While we waited (30 minutes) to see if we were ever going to get our drink order and place our food order, we saw the wait staff continually give drinks and food to the wrong tables?!  After never receiving our drinks or getting a chance to place a food order, we left.  It was a nice crowd but not overly busy so hard to understand the delay and confusion. Maybe after they've been open longer,  we'll try this location again."}
{"text":"The food was ok. The upgrade of the bar was kinda neat. The girls are very nice and definitely work hard. 
Overall the the service wasn't bad except for the GM and female bartender arguing with a member of my party over a crown and diet coke they made a mistake of putting vanilla in. I had to walk to the bar and let the male bartender taste it and have it remade. Thats fine. But whats not fine is the GM insinuating that we don't know what we ordered and ow it should taste. 
Not impressed with the college environment that was created once the clock struck 8pm. It turned into a complete shit show. With music so loud, making it difficult to communicate with someone sitting next to you. Making it difficult to communicate with the servers. Then there was the make shift dance floor which developed between the route to the kitchen and bathrooms. 

This place is a severe down grade from Casa Anejo. This place is basically a bar from old town now. Instead of the classy vibe Casa had in the new up and coming Uptown district. 

Swing and a miss from the EEG Entertainment group. Coming from a local."}
{"text":"Thought it was still casa anejo, but found out was is now Bevvy.  Can't believe how amazingly filling the appetizer menu was. We had wings and quesadilla which was enough food for both of us. Craft draft beer for happy hour for $3 is unbeatable.  Love all the TVs playing sports.  The only gripe is the ranch and blue cheese were watery, and the salsa could benefit from some spice.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"So I hesitated to write this because I don't want everyone to realize this place is here, but at the same time, y'all need to know how much I love it here.  We've been there twice in the like 4 days it's been open. Here's the deal, my husband and I are constantly in a stand off over where to go, I want a place with great food where I feel like I can camp out, so that means good music, comfy booths or bar stools, just general cuteness. For him, everything is based off the one meal he will order every time we go somewhere and tvs everywhere with different sportsing happening on each one. For both of us, good service is key because I can be an a-hole if dealing with too much nonsense, so then he gets embarrassed, then we fight over it. This place legit checks all our boxes. I don't eat meat that lives on land and unlike a lot of places, they have a ton of vegetarian or fish options. The impossible burger lives here, plus impossible tacos and bowls! That's huge cause I get to eat a burger and fries!!!The salmon here is seriously no exaggeration the best I've ever had. I raved about it like such a lunatic they sent the chef out, probably to calm me down. Btw, he seems like a kitchen ninja and was telling us some of his ideas for upcoming stuff, including an all you can eat brunch, ummm what??My husband is boring af so both times we've been here he ordered the muscle bowl with is chicken and quinoa and I dunno, pico?? Whatever it was, he loved it.  The GM, Justin, is super cool and friendly and the whole place just has such a great vibe where everyone seems happy to be there. You should go here, but don't sit in my favorite spot because chances are good I'll be there too."}
{"text":"We tried a lot of items on The Brunch Menu. I would not recommend The Shakshuka or The French Toast. The Shakshuka was terribly seasoned and The French Toast had this off taste my daughter took 2 bites and was done. I would possibly go back to try their normal menu. I've heard good things about the vegan options. But brunch ... no. DJ was awesome food was not."}
{"text":"Love the bottomless mimosas for brunch! . Food was good and music was great! Live DJ! We will be coming back for sure! Service was quick. Atmosphere was fun and welcoming. This spot use to be a Mexican restaurant that wasn't our favorite, they made great use of the space."}
{"text":"We went here for brunch on Sunday. Food was good. Service was great. Environment was cool. I had the brunch burger and husband got the chilaquiles."}
{"text":"Service not great, if a waitress can't remember what you order then write it down. This drives me insane you order, the server doesn't write it down and then the order is delivered and it's not what you ordered.   No drink list and the beers are overpriced. Food and atmosphere are ok, won't return."}
{"text":"After a couple of weeks of talking about going to check out Bevvy Uptown we finally had a weekend to give it a shot. Mid morning on a Saturday we were greeted and sat quickly. It's definitely interesting as far as the interior of the restaurant and the decor of the bar area as we were walked to our table. We were thrilled to sit on the patio with the lovely weather that were having right now, and the vibe was cool as well. My fiancée and I both had scoped our the menu before making our voyage to the restaurant. She had her eyes on the shakshuka and I wanted to tear up he waffle chicken wings. I was happy with the beer menu, they had Sculpin IPA for a good price for the 22oz beer. It wasn't long after we had put in the order of our desired entrees before they appeared before us. My wings looked good and so did hers. But, I regret to report, the hype was not quite lived up to. Her shakshuka didn't have much flavor and my wings were so so. We were hoping to be wowed and while we're not entirely disappointed, we had higher hopes. Our server was quick and efficient, and very pleasant. Caroline and I will be back, more than likely for brunch on a Sunday, and I will update my review after trying other dishes. Until then, 3 stars."}
{"text":"Came here last weekend and had a really fun time!
It's just like the Bevvy in Old Town Scottsdale but definitely more laid back. 
Lots of TVs so you can watch sports anywhere/everywhere you look. 
Our server was Stacy and he was very friendly and helped us celebrate my friends' birthday. He hooked us up with some extra liquor which was very much appreciated.
My friends and I shared a blueberry Moscow mule and it was amazing! Literally SO good!
We also shared tater tots, a pork chili flatbread and a warm pretzel. The only thing I didn't like was the pork chili flatbread, but everything else was good! 
Definitely would come back!"}
{"text":"On the second day of their soft opening we went there with a group of people from out of town. The food was absolutely ridiculously good. If I had my choice I would order the wings for an appetizer, the 60/40 burger for a meal, and the waffle wings for dessert. The waffle wings are out of this world. 60/40 burger is like heaven on a bun. The wings are the best wings I've ever had in my whole entire life. Stupid amazing food."}
{"text":"We came Here for my friends birthday. We ordered drinks and it took 15+ minutes. We finally go them. They were ok. We ordered food about 30+ min later (restaurant is not busy). The appetizer came out after the entree so totally wrong. I ordered a wedge salad, i literally got a head of lettuce with crumbles of bacon and no blue cheese dressing. Ordered a side of short ribs to go with my salad it was completely missing i had to tell the waiter that it was missing.  They brought it out and it literally looked like beef jerky. So to sum it up go next door to Stock and stable. (Tator tots are amazing, due to it takes 2 sec to fry,yet they were late)!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, and drinks. Very laid back people of all ages can have a good time. Service was fantastic. Understandably because I met their manager Heather and she is an asset to the company no doubt about it!"}
{"text":"We have been pleasantly surprised with our first two visits here. We came opening night, which you would expect to be a crazy mess but they did an amazing job with food and service. We split three recipes and some craft cocktails, at very reasonable prices. The assistant manager came by to check on us and Lorenzo took really good care of us. We came back for brunch on Saturday with some friends and even though they haven't rolled out the full brunch menu and are still getting situated the food and service were both really good. I think we found our new favorite place for happy hour and brunch!"}
{"text":"Perfect addition to uptown Phoenix. Chef Paul along with some of the best from the industry makes this a must visit restaurant. Brunch, lunch, dinner or late night adult beverages, Bevvy Uptown has something for everyone. Don't forget to say hi to Zoltar while you're there."}
{"text":"Service was ok. We had too many people asking if we had been helped, and following up. We didn't need to be asked five times if everything was ok. Sorry, just overwhelming and seemed disconnected from each other.
Food was just plain awful. 
Great cocktails though. 
Would go for drinks but never again for food."}
{"text":"We are so happy this place is open. The atmosphere is welcoming and fun. The space is open and no obstructed views of the TV's. It's open to the patio area. They have sports, music, games and good heathy food options. The service is great."}
{"text":"A friend and I went here shortly after they opened. We arrived knowing there would be a wait as it was a Friday after work and happy hour was in full effect. We were told about 45 minutes for a table and after waiting at the bar (standing room only) for just over an hour we questioned how much longer the wait was. We were seated shortly after and after another small hiccup in service the GM, Justin, came over to apologize for the wait and introduce himself. After finding out my friend was vegetarian he told us about the Impossible \"burger\" they serve there and we went with that. Although service had some hiccups I understand they had recently opened and were still working out the kinks. I appreciate that Justin came over and acknowledged this and made sure we were taken care of after finally being seated. Will definitely be back. Good vibes, great neighborhood spot, awesome happy hour! P.S. Any chance the Impossible burger will soon be available at The Porch?? Hint, hint! ;)"}
{"text":"Tried out the Bevvy Uptown for Sunday Brunch with a group of 8 people.
The staff was friendly and helpful.
The food was not bad (I would liked more Vegan options).
Sad to know we can't substitute or order off the regular menu. (Anyone with food allergies needs to make a note).

However, all of that was ruined by the LOUD AND NON-STOP music SUNDAY at NOON.  It was worse than being in the front of the speakers at a concert.  I could not hear the person next to me.  We asked the server if it could be turned down, but since it was live music, we were stuck with the blaring music.  It did not matter where you sat.  It was too loud everywhere.
This is something you would expect on a Friday or Saturday.  NOT on a leisurely family Sunday brunch.

Coffee would have been nice.  I guess that is not part of brunch anymore."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful evening with friends on a Monday night.  Shilo was our server, being friendly and available.  When needing help with a game on TV, Jason was called and diligently worked at finding our unusual request.  Loved the atmosphere.  Was originally concerned 'it' was located on a busy street, but when seated and engaged in conversation, did not even notice the street noise.  Two of us had quesadillas, and both of us said we would certainly order those again.  The guys had hamburgers and fries which they commented were spicy and full of flavor.  Both said they would order them again.  The portions were generous, which resulted in taking at least half of the meal home with us.  Great place, great atmosphere, and food!"}
{"text":"What a great find in a fantastic part of town!  The food was fantastic and the friendly service coupled with nice ambiance makes a great combination for a night out.  We went with a large party which was handled well by the hostess, server and chef. We had lots of special dietary needs and they were easily accommodated with the menu. Everyone RAVED about their food and the beverages were fabulous too."}
{"text":"Great New Location to our area! They have amazing service and delicious food. I talk to the manager and he said soon they will be having late night food. I tried their Impossible Burger and it was super delicious. For our drinks we were drinking Girls Friends Secret which was refreshing."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure how I was going to feel about the Bevvy. Felt like ANOTHER old town Scottsdale place invading an already over saturated street. The interior was really cool and kind of a throw back to my childhood. (No need to specify what decade that is) 

I'll just cut to the chase.

It was Sunday brunch. Menu was not really that exciting. We tried the \"devilish\" eggs. Super yolky and not remotely close to what most people think of with devil eggs. I took one bite and struggled to not spit it out. In all fairness I don't care for eggs that much. The waffle bacon bites were ok. Flash frying waffles seems a little overkill. But they were fun to try. My 5 star rating probably is confusing by my review. I'm reality it was our bartender TAYLOR that made us stay longer and want to come back. She was super engaging and knowledgeable about the Bevvy and the neighboring restaurants. Definitely the best of the new spots on 7th street. I'll be back to try their lunch/ dinner!"}
{"text":"Got lucky driving North on 7th Street after work and stopped at The Bevvy for their soft opening. Great food, great staff, and fun cocktails!  Definitely try the \"Shake it, Don't break it\". The flavor is pleasing and the Bluecoat gin is perfect. I started with the red pepper hummus appetizer which was delectable!  Then ordered the Bevvy Chicken Salad which was delicious! Hats off to the Chef!  Rachel is a great mixologist under the tutelage of an engaging bar manager, Brian. I definitely recommend this new restaurant on 7th Street right next to Stock and Stable."}
{"text":"The male bartender working this evening was too proud to attend to the bar, despite closing at midnight. What a shame for a new establishment to the hood."}
{"text":"Happy hour rocks! Hours are 3:00-7:00 Monday-Friday. Try the muscle bowl
Every table has a barrel of monkeys game.  I made a new rule if you get all your monkeys in line then you get a free vodka shot..The GM Justin Gurian was awesome came around to the tables and genuinely meet everyone. Tito's grapefruit cocktail was great and $6.00 on HH. 
Cant wait to try Sunday brunch with shareable plates and mimosas."}
{"text":"Honestly this place was better as Casa Anejo, at least staff-wise. Bartenders aren't friendly here at all. Plus I was given the wrong drink but can't get it fixed because I can't seem to find a bartender who'll even look my way. Casa anejo had amazing staff members. Probably won't be coming back here in the future."}
{"text":"I went to the Sunday brunch and we had a blast! Unlimited mimosas, unlimited breakfast. The music was so much fun! We kept on dancing! We enjoyed the ambiance and the service was exceptional! I used to love casa Añejo but Bevvy knows what they are doing, and they know how to attract the people!"}
{"text":"Went to Bevvy this afternoon. Not much has changed with this restaurant from the previous restaurant. The patio is very nice. The service still needs a lot of work. We ordered the appraiser guacamole and two of the burgers. The burgers came out and we asked about the guacamole. The server said he forgot to put the order in. We declined the guacamole. The burgers were ok. Nothing spectacular. The service still needs a lot of work. The only reason I may come back to this restaurant is to relax on the patio. I'll keep my expectations low for good service here"}
