{"text":"Great breakfast special: 50% off your breakfast order (with purchase of beverage) from 6:00 am - 9:00 am."}
{"text":"Without a doubt, the worst breakfast ever!    I had the basic breakfast with biscuits instead of toast.  The biscuits were tiny and seemed kinda rubbery.  The hash browns you can taste that they had been frozen and just bland and although they looked crispy, they were not.  The eggs tasted like those weird eggs you get on a free breakfast at a hotel stay.  My boyfriend had sausage gravy and biscuits.  The gravy was bland and the sausage part of the sausage gravy was MIA.  Again, tiny little biscuits.  Save your money and drive a little further west on Lorain to Canary's or Gourme."}
{"text":"This review is based solely on this evenings experience. I'll be honest, as a person in the service industry who works late nights, it's always nice to have a late night spot to go. And we've always been big fans of Stratos. On this particular evening though, we encountered the WORST service I have ever had. I don't know who the woman was that served us, but she was completely nasty to us from start to finish. At one point she barked at us across the restaurant \"are you done\" and started slamming the utensils for the buffet. I've been a server/bartender for 18+ years and I can only imagine how difficult the late night shift must be. But I have NEVER been treated the way this woman treated us tonight, and unfortunately it makes me never want to step foot in there again. Truthfully before tonight, I've always had good service and food there. But this woman ruined all that for me. It's a shame people need to treat other people as awful as she did to us."}
{"text":"Open 24 hours... we had an early morning flight from CLE and wanted breakfast before. At 5:00am the service was great and the food was amazing. Our waitress Heather was friendly and took great care of us... even at that time. I'll have to try it again once the sun comes up :)"}
{"text":"This is a great place to come for breakfast if you are in the area. The best 24 hour restaurant I have ever been to.   I don't particularly care for their breakfast buffet, but the salad bar is yummy. Their soups are worth the calories, one of my favorite things here. I always order their grape leaves, their not like grandma makes, but compared to what other restaurants are doing, their excellent. I like their gyros here, I don't believe they are from a spit or shawarma, but they still taste good. The Greek pork chops are good here, I have them at breakfast with my eggs occasionally (well done please).   I would definitely recommend this place for late night munchies or an early breakfast with the elderly. Nice Greek Diner, nice staff, nice location!"}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants on the west side of Cleveland. Amazing breakfast and great staff! A must try!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing breakfast buffet. Everything was extremely bland tasting. I can get around that with various spices/condiments. What I CAN'T get past is how cold everything that came from the steam table was. I mean EVERYTHING! It actually defies logic because when you lift the lid, steam comes wafting out. But as soon as you get to your table, the food on the plate is lukewarm at best. This buffet is on par with a complimentary breakfast you might get at a budget hotel. Otherwise the restaurant seems fine. Clean though very outdated decor."}
{"text":"We've been here for breakfast maybe half a dozen times.  The waitresses are pleasant and helpful, and the service is pretty quick.  My only complaint is that the corned beef hash, which is one of the things I judge a restaurant by, tasted like it had ketchup in it.  Otherwise, the breakfasts there are good.........we have not been there for lunch or dinner so far."}
{"text":"Open 24 hours i have been going there for years. Good size portions that are neither too small or too large.  Prices are great. The chicken and dumpling soup is something you can not find very many places as well as the Chicken and Dumpling dinner. The dumplings are home made which again is rare. The waffles are great and the bacon is always cooked to perfection. Plenty of place to park. There are many choices on the menu which is great for both younger crowd and older folks as well as small children. Great specials during the week as well. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. About 95 % of the time the food is great. I have had a few times where it was not horrible but just average. But I have never had a bad plate or bad tasting meal. Great variety."}
{"text":"Breakfast is ok just ok!! Big large carpenter ant to start ...that should of been a warning .. In the bathroom it was the most disgusting thing I've ever seen in many years anywhere !!   It's making me nauseous just to think how dirty the kitchen must be if they let the bathroom stay like that .. Poop all over the seat !!' Gross .. And that poop was there a long time !!! The sink vanity was crusty with old grime and hairs..  I just left There and hope they read this and shape up the place.. It could be a nice little place to eat, but right now they better wake Up!!!!"}
{"text":"Everything was good. Eggs are cooked with care, the meat is quality... French toast and croissant egg sandwich were pretty delicious. Solid breakfast place by an established family."}
{"text":"Diner type place. Good Omelet. Hair in Fruit (icky) Nice servers. Open 24 hours?  Really They have a salad bar (K, I love salad bars) but I was there for breakfast so that wasn't an option. Would I go back....probably after church again for b-fast."}
{"text":"We have been going here for years. Typically for breakfast, but I've eaten lunch and dinner here.  The menu has lots of options, and they are all home cooking and comfort food type selections.  When we do breakfast, if we buy a beverage, the meal is half off. What a deal! Not sure of the time frame, but we are always there before 9am.  With dinner entrees,  typically they bring warm, crusty, homemade bread. Mmm!  The folks that work here are very friendly. The place is clean, and filled with character.  The salad bar is nothing special,  but I enjoy the soup options."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast and they served us a delicious family style breakfast! Would recommend to anyone wanting a fast, hearty, family breakfast!! Delicious!"}
{"text":"Good buffet, well priced ,fast, good service ,a great value for your money . We will be back"}
{"text":"Took my mom and sister here for breakfast on Sunday morning.  They don't even bother to supply half & half for coffee.  Just oil based fake \"creamer\".   Stay away.  There are 10 better places for breakfast in the west suburbs."}
{"text":"Before I start let me say I've been to cafe stratos more then 10 times in my life.Okay, it's a small family owned place it's not a fancy suit and tie dinner date. The food is good, breakfast is my favorite. I've never had a complaint EVER! Portions are large, unless your not satisfied with a plate size omelet filled with meat and vegetables, fried potatoes and toast. In that case then you should have got the breakfast buffet. The prices are decent, you can't beat 50% off on Tuesdays. The potato pancakes were so good I asked for the recipe, and got it! Service is OK, not  super but is not bad. Overall it's a nice place with good food.   Breakfast buffet on weekends, starts Friday  night 10:30pm Eggs, meats, potatoes, french toast, pancakes, biscuits and sausage gravy $8.99"}
{"text":"Weekend Brunch Review  Waitress acted dissapointed when we asked for time to look over the extensive menu and talked up the buffet... I wish we had passed.  2 soups... no oatmeal or grits   Iceburg salad bar with basics from the 70's  Tough scrambled eggs, soggy french toast, over cooked bacon.  We could have had toast if we wanted the waitress to make some for us.  Coffee... so bad we ended up going to the coffee shop down the street to get the taste out of our mouths.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"I should have known that I would have issues as soon as I found this place on yelp.  Yelp said it was closed but it was actually open.  I walked in and I was the youngest person dining (oh wait including the staff).   Paper signs tapped everywhere.  One giving the \"early bird\" specials and another notifying that carry out boxes would be charged a dollar.  Ok but I continued.   I ordered the stuffed cabbage.  I was told it came with the soup and salad bar as well as bread.     Visited the salad bar and started making my salad.  The lettuce wasn't fresh but not awful either.  However when I grabbed cucumbers, some little gnats flew up at me.   I decided to skip the salad.  I next tried the soup, beef barley.  No issues here.  Very tasty.  Unfortunately their kitchen is open for the dinning room to see.   The cook wanders around an even put his finger in his ear, failing to wash his hands afterwards.   Kind of disturbing.  Finally the entree arrived.   Presentation was good.  The menu claims \"real mashed potatoes\".   I find that very hard to believe.   These taste, look, and feel instant to me.  Now the stuffed cabbage.  Very good!   Unfortunately it doesn't make up for the items I already mentioned.  I think I will skip this place next time I am in town"}
{"text":"Cafe stratos has great character. The inside walls feature painted murals while the outside during warm months features a beautiful garden on the deck. ( worth eating outside for) The menu has many options and long with many early bird specials from 2:00pm- 5:00. 50 percent off with the purchase of a beverage. The salad bar has its basics along with pasta salads, pudding. And two soup choices ( they are very good and homemade) The staff has always been friendly and on the ball. You can tell that many of the family members work here as well. This is one of my favorite mom and pop joints to eat"}
{"text":"This is a good little spot for breakfast. Service was fast and they have a decent looking buffet that had some great items but I opted to order off the menu. The coffee was never ending!  I appreciated how often the various staff came over to always be certain I had a fresh cup of Joe."}
{"text":"Ordered off the menu after going up the street first to Aries (NEVER GO THERE!!!) The staff welcomed our unexpected party of 9, service was good and the food was better than average, I used to live in Cleveland and was back for a visit, I was pleasantly surprised. Would have got 5 stars for a diner had the waitress remembered to bring my friend his side of mayo, but all in all, a good place.  Portions were generous as well."}
{"text":"I have been driving past Cafe Stratos since I moved  to North Olmsted 3 years ago.  Located on the North side of Lorain Road just past Clague Road and open 24/7. Today I decided it was time l stopped for lunch. There were a dozen items on the salad buffet along with 4 different dressings. The soup of the day was clam chowder and chicken dumpling. I chose the clam chowder and a small portion of 6 different salads.  When I got back to my table there was a plate with 4 slices of the most delicious bread I have had in any restaurant.  I ordered hand breaded Lake Perch and fries. They came hot and perfectly fried. The waitress and Manager could not have been nicer and pleased to be of service to their customers.  All of this came with a bill less than $12.  I definitely be going back to Strato"}
{"text":"Run by a Greek family, Cafe Stratos offers real cooking at its best.  The staff is always friendly and the owner will often come over to discuss his garden which literally covers the building.  In nice weather, the back patio often hosts his pet birds amid the crawling vines and flowers.    The food is akin to great home cooking.  The Greek Pork Chops and Greek Fish with lemon and oregano are as good as described and literally melt in your mouth.   There's a basic salad bar that's usually stocked with avgolemono (Greek lemon soup).  Breakfast is equally hearty and served 24 hours.  When you realize the food quality for the prices, you'll know why the parking lot is never empty."}
{"text":"Was recommended this place by a gentleman who works at Goddess Elite. I don't live in the area, and when I checked the reviews on Urban Spoon, the 52% \"like\" rate was kind of nervous-making. Still, we all decided to take a chance and go for it. My husband is always up for a new diner.  When we got there, they seemed kind of confused and disorganized. However, they had a great special running: 50% off your entree with the purchase of a beverage. OK then!  Finally we were seated, and then we ended up with Stella as our waitress. SHE IS AWESOME. She is funny and super adorable.  And on to the food. They have something for everyone. I got veal with spaghetti. But before that, there was the soup and salad bar. I didn't get any salad--salad is pretty much salad wherever you go. I DID try the soups--beef barley and chicken dumpling. Both were fantastic.   My dinner was also delicious. They make everything THERE, so it takes a long time to get your food. But there is the salad and soup bar, and they also bring out the most amazing crusty bread that's still warm.  What was also refreshing? The portions were not MASSIVE. I was actually able to clean my plate, which I rarely do when I eat out. And I had room for dessert, which was warm blueberry pie. They also had a Buckeye pie on the menu, which was like a French silk peanut butter pie. I KNOW.  It's not a trendy place. Well, maybe the clientele changes in the middle of the night, but we were there on a Tuesday evening and the demographic was definitely more of what I expect to see at Bob Evans.   I like diners, and I don't go into them looking for fancy stuff. I want good food and fun service. And this place had it. Will definitely go back when I'm back in the area."}
{"text":"Great food! We went in really late ordered breakfast! Because was craving it lol My blueberry pancakes so good! I couldn't finish they were pretty big! A lot of regulars go here. Big TV with news on or games. Lady was nice and quick service!"}
{"text":"This is a small gem. Good homemade food at a good price. They provide a lot of food too! A good selection and lots of specials. If they served breakfast all day it would be great. If you are looking for a little diner try it out, it is worth a look."}
{"text":"Been here at least a dozen times over the years, and I like it.  The breakfast is good (from what I understand, half-price before a certain time!), as are the poultry and seafood choices.  For lunch,  I often order their tuna on pita bread with veggies, which is delish.  Their buffet was good too, which I understand they don't have daily.  During warmer months, the outdoor patio is very nice, lined with exotic plants and flowers that clearly are a labor of love by the owner.  As is true of all family restaurants and diners, prices are much better than the ripoff and over-rated national chains.  I also think more and more people are becoming aware that diners are a better and healthier choice (but still affordable compared to the chains) than unhealthy fast-food.  They are also very 'kid friendly', with a good kids menu, and crayons and coloring books to keep them busy.  I'll continue bringing my family here!"}
{"text":"Was here Monday morning for breakfast.  Good decent food and nice prices.  Missed the breakfast special by 1/2 hour. We got there at 10:30am or a quarter to 11.  I wanted the friend I was with to get out of bed to join me, but they were lazy.  I finally got them up and ready. I had a basic egg breakfast, 2 over medium, bacon, hash browns with rye toast and coffee.  The portions of hash browns and bacon were generous.  My friend finished what I could not eat.  I love hungry skinny people with high metabolisms.    The wait staff was very friendly.  I would love to give 3 1/2 stars, my 1st batch of eggs were not cooked all the way, but they were nice to bring me another.  They cleared the table when we were finished and did not rush us out.  We got to talk for a little while.  I enjoyed them pretty well, but it was a little to warm in there.  They needed to turn up the air a bit. I would like to come back and try some of the other food, another time."}
{"text":"This place was amazing!  Great food.... Warm homemade bread, wonderful soup and salad bar.... Very reasonable pricing.... Good service and nice people.  It's Friday night and not crowded here but should be!!   Ps....Also a great kids menu (we brought our 3.5 year old)"}
{"text":"Not much was open at 10:30 on a Thursday evening after seeing a show in Cleveland. My boyfriend and I took a chance on this place and overall, it was meh. The high point was my chicken fried steak which was crispier and tastier than it had any right to be. The low point was the 24 hour \"salad bar\" which proudly displayed alarmingly brown iceberg lettuce and a sad assortment of old, limp vegetables. The service was friendly enough. The other patrons were a fascinating assortment of elderly regulars, one of whom was in sequins head to toe."}
{"text":"The food looked great but tastes HORRIBLE!!! We sent the food back and just ordered an omlet and a burger and they screwed that up too! How do you mess up an omlet and a plain burger?!! Never again unles I'm being paid to eat! Don't waste you time or money!!!!  If I could give it zero stars, I would!!!"}
{"text":"One visit was enough. Several years ago (I know, this review is probably going to be considered expired upon arrival) some friends and I rolled in there for some coffee and cheap eats. Were we kids? Yep. Did we perhaps look a bit rough? Maybe. But we were generally good kids with enough money in or pockets to afford some dinner and a couple cups of coffee.   But we weren't treated like that. The meal went mostly okay. The food wasn't great, but it wasn't terrible either. For a place like this, it's pretty much exactly what you'd expect. But as the meal ended, it was clear that we were no longer welcome. First off, the place was nearly empty. There were no waiting customers. But we intended to finish our food and have another cup of coffee while discussing whatever was important to us at the time. But one of the older men that worked there walked over and told us to leave if we were finished. And he wasn't all that nice about it. We politely told him that we weren't. So, he sat down opposite us and watched us from three feet away. We largely ignored him, but it was odd and creepy. Still, we were stubborn and not so easily pushed around. But remaining polite, we simply continued our discussion. But he wouldn't let it go. Every time we touched a fork, he'd raise his voice and admonish us that now that would have to be cleaned. At some point, my buddy picked up a jelly packed and read the label. He stood up and told us that those aren't free and if he ate the jelly, he would charge him. At one point he told us that if we didn't leave, he'd call the police. Having a father that was a police officer, I told him to go ahead. We weren't doing anything wrong and I knew several of the cops on the force. Again, we were good kids. He didn't call.   Look, I can certainly sympathize with restaurant owners that have to deal with groups of kids, often intoxicated, who do nothing other than make noise and cause disruptions. Hit up a Denny's at one in the morning and see what I'm talking about. But we weren't those kids and gave him absolutely no cause to consider us so.   So, forget this place. I drive past it all the time; now with a family. But we'll go someplace else. If I want cheap, mediocre fare from a Greek joint that reuses uneaten food, I can get it nearly anywhere else."}
{"text":"The food is amazing. The waitress Lorrie is very on top of thing, very carring to make sure u are satisfied. Top notch place in my opinion. Food is fresh, comes out quick. Priced good too. Cant wait to come again. Delicious omelette and the crepes look so good cant wait to try."}
{"text":"I was here for a 24 hour night once. It was a lot nicer inside than Denny's, which is my usual late night place. There was one electrical outlet in the corner that I found; I was lucky that nobody was sitting there (or sitting near there). There was not any internet though. I didn't even realize it was Greek-based until I read some other reviews on here."}
