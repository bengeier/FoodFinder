{"text":"Friendly owners. They have really good food, but keep in mind that you'll be paying for microwaved food. The food (aka not rice dishes) on the left is made instantly, however those on the right are the ones that they lay out in front of you. Like canteen style.

We watched the Eurocup final there, which was nice, because there was barely anybody there. Plus, we were there at 4 pm for lunch, so probably that's why. But if you're looking for some friendly smiles and fast Thai food, you're in the right place."}
{"text":"The food delivered from this restaurant was very close to in inedible. A complete waste of money. Never again!"}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend were coughing and sneezing as we got in! Another couple entered the restaurant just a minute after and they couldn't bear the air inside! I was too hungry to go look for smth else so I decided to stay. The food serving is definitely not enough for what you pay!! And the craziest part is they heated it up in a microwave!!!!WTF?! I certainly do not recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"J'ai eu une indigestion après avoir mangé à cet endroit aujourd'hui... 
\"Enough said\"!"}
{"text":"I'm very happy that I discovered this place. La Maison Thai offers great Thai food, desserts & bubble teas.

There is no waiter service here. Food is placed under glass at the counter and whatever you like is served to you on a tray and you seat yourself. The place is nice inside, nothing too special.

The staff is very kind, helpful and attentive. The food is fresh, hot, yummy, the portions are generous and the prices are just right. I tried the shrimp pad thai, shrimp rolls and shrimp dumplings. The pad thai was great with a good amount of shrimps. The shrimp rolls were good too, but slightly on the oily side. Also, the shrimp dumplings were yum and I loved the sauce it came with. I was craving their bubble tea but did not get to have one since the large portion of the pad thai filled me up- I could not finish all of it!

This is a good Thai place if you're looking for a nice informal meal or takeout."}
{"text":"Worst \"thai\" food EVER!!!!! Too oily, tastless, didnt taste thai at all ! Rice was mushy and overcooked ... Even the fried banana was gross .. Like it was cooked in old oil that expired in 1976 ! Imagine the imperial rolls!! Ewww!  Im sure that even our garbage can will find it disgusting .. Avoid!"}
{"text":"I never bother to leave reviews, but I ordered takeout from here and the food was terrible. I was seeking some no frills classic thai curries, which is what I ordered. I was confused and disappointed when I received food that resembled and a low-quality MSG-infused Chinese takeout, fortune cookies included. Yes, the dishes had the correct protein included, however, there weren't any curries? It was very strange. Will not order again."}
{"text":"I used them for delivery and quite frankly I'm very disappointed. I'm huge fan of thai cuisine and I'm always willing to pay more than average for good thai food. My order costed me $25, which I was ok with since I had read very good reviews posted here. My pad thai was very cold, missing salt and seasoning, really. Not to mention that it only came with 2 units of shrimps (??). The bubble tea was AMAZING though."}
{"text":"The bubble tea was absolutely amazing and the service was very friendly and welcoming. The boba was reasonably priced and the employee working there even recommended their favourite (which turned out to be wonderful, as said previously). If you're looking for good boba in Montréal, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"I have to admit - I have a weird craving for greasy, deep-fried spring rolls and this is where I go to get them. They've already deep fried them once and when you go to the counter to order some, they deep fry them a second time, just to make sure all those saturated fats and free radicals are good and in there! But, guiltily, that's what I'm there for. It's an infrequent indulgence I allow myself when I'm starving on my way home. 
As for the rest of the food, the only reason I eat here is because they swore to me that they don't cook with MSG. Try your best to find any other Asian restaurant in the 'hood that doesn't use MSG! Good luck. So, this is the best bet. I know it seems a bit ridiculous to be concerned about MSG when I've just clogged my arteries with spring roll magic, but I never said I was perfect! 
So, if you're starving and just can't wait, grab something here to calm down that hunger panic. Otherwise, go home and microwave your leftovers because it'll be pretty much the same thing."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a no frills, simple but tasty establishment. Ordered a noodle soup dish and it hit the spot. I definitely recommend it for someone who us looking for a light meal thats a good deal."}
{"text":"Déçue par cet endroit. J'avais pris une formule avec deux choix (buf aux champignons et poulet-brocolis). Très très peu de viande (quelques morceaux) et le reste du plat c'est  la sauce et légumes pour encombrer la boîte. Verdict: très cher pour ce que c'est et goût fade"}
{"text":"Normally I wouldn't care to post a review for this place but I would like to warn you ...

Don't go here .... This is the thing ... I believes it was a \" Thai restaurant \" or at least so kind of  real Thai joint ... I came in and the look of the good was good .... They show the dishes prepared on a glass counter .. Then you get to choose how many options you want ... So you make your picks .... And then ... The worst ... THEY MICROWAVE IT .... Wtf ??? It's all cold ... Being there since good knows when .... And you know how does microwaved  food tastes ... So basically you are paying 13 cad for a dish  of microwaved \"Thai \" food ...do yourself a favor, buy frozen food and go home , you won't see nothing exceptional here 

Oh and btw .. First time they microwaved it .. It was only hot on the top .. So imagine general tao Chiken cold ... I asked to put it again on the microwave ...Oh my god !!! I left 3 minutes ago after realizing that bond of The 3 dishes was even eatable .... 

PLEASE DONT EAT HERE UNLESS YOU FEEL LIKE  WASTING 13 cad / PERSON AND IMMEDIATELY GOING SOMEWHERE ELSE TO HAVE LUNCH OR DINNER"}
{"text":"Did not try the food but their coconut bubble tea is one of the best I've had in Montreal"}
{"text":"Bonnes sélections de plats frais asiatiques, bon prix, bon service, ils ont du ''bubble tea'' + bière thai singha + desserts !"}
{"text":"Average food. Good delivery. Bad side: We ordered the 3 choice combo plate with soup for 14.99 on their online menu (see their website : http://maisonthai.ca/menu-en.pdf), and did NOT receive the soup. We called back and asked about the mistake. They simply said you need to ASK for the soup. Well, it says clearly on the menu the combo comes with it. Not ordering here again."}
{"text":"Used them for delivery and was very impressed. Delivery was just under 40 minutes and food was hot and delicious - flavors complex and interesting. Would definitely use again.

One sad note: No Thai Iced tea!! What's with that?"}
{"text":"Stopped by here the last two days after yoga class for a quick bite. Quick it was, we were in and out with full Tummys within 10-15 minutes! We chose from the food they had set out for selection under the glass, there were lots of options. I am vegetarian and had 5-6 plates to choose from, and also some very good veg spring rolls! They really over full the 12oz small plate so unless your really hungry, go for that one! I got a 12oz and 2 spring rolls and was comfortably full!! Service was friendly and very fluent! I will Definetly be back to this place! My meal was under 8$ both times, can't go wrong!!"}
{"text":"I ordered from the a la carte menu and really enjoyed the vegetarian pad siew with tofu that I ordered. It was made fresh, was tasty and I received the right quantity. I love that they're able to make everything without fish sauce! Everyone working here was very sweet and friendly. Didn't seem to have any of the challenges or experiences that others are complaining of! Definitely try this spot out!"}
