{"text":"Nikos... Is that Greek?  Haha

Pretty good. Thick. Good toppings.  I think that they are about 3-5 $ over where they should. Would eat it again. Wouldn't drive across the city though."}
{"text":"Best pizza in YYC! No shortcuts and loads of toppings! Great service. Can't wait to eat here again. Quality ingredients used."}
{"text":"Just ordered pizza for the first time as I watch the packers kick some butt and I have to say awesome pizza!! I will definitely order again. Cheers!"}
{"text":"I was sad to find that Niko's only sold pizza.....yesss I can read the sign, but knowing that he was Greek and not having a single bit of Greek food there did make me a little sad. 

I ordered a large everything pizza. Wow, this pizza is dense and filling! It was almost two inches thick and chock full of meaty goodness. Normally I wouldn't get an everything pizza, but my roomate likes to go all out. It was a little pricey for a large (almost $30) but it lasted us a few days. 

It was very filling and tasted perfect. The crust was seasoned and crisp. I hate it when you get bland crusts! *shakes fist in air* 

It is very close to Boston Pizza and Pizza Hut, but their pizza doesn't even come close to how tasty this was! 

I will def be going back even though it was a bit more expensive than the average pizza joint."}
{"text":"Very nice pizza, the sauce was delicious! I would have liked some chicken wings to go with my Pizza but they aren't on the menu. They make a good pizza and that's all they have to offer"}
{"text":"If you are on 11th Street just north of 17th Avenue, you have to give Niko's a try. They have the best pizza in the neighbourhood, bar none. Crust that is just the right thickness, cheese spilling over the edge and cooked to perfection. I know that there is a Pappa John's and Boston Pizza nearby, but why not support the small local business that makes great pizza? Sooooo much better. And well worth the extra buck or two in my opinion."}
{"text":"After looking at the reviews I had high expectations.  The pizza looked very different from their website. Not sure if it was our mistake or all the pizza's are made the same.  The pepperoni and mushroom pizza had the pepperoni stuffed under the cheese and tasted more like soggy salami."}
{"text":"This little place came into mind when I was looking for some dinner with a friend last night. 
We ordered the Large BBQ Chicken Pizza. The guy at the counter was super friendly and didnt mind the fight my friend and I had about who was going to pay. (I won in the end, since he said he knows better than to argue with a woman) 

We came back 20 min later for our pizza and it was crazy delicious.. It had a medium crust that was baked perfectly. They put a ton of cheese, but it wasnt super stringy, it was almost baked on. Then there's the toppings..this thing was a monster. After three smaller pieces, I was stuffed. The pizza is a bit more expensive than your regular joint ( we paid $23 for the large) but so worth it, since the quality is far superior."}
{"text":"The Hawaiian pizza is the bomb. Always fast pickup and delivery and the staff is super friendly."}
{"text":"So good we ordered twice in one week. Amazing pizza! Our new go-to for ordering in. We had the Athenas pizza with feta, olives, spinach, and green peppers. All the ingredients taste fresh and real. Our favourite part of the crust. Crispy and delicious!"}
{"text":"Now, THIS IS WHAT PIZZA SHOULD TASTE LIKE! Niko's is hands down the best pizza I have had in the city. 

We always order the pepperoni, bacon, mushroom, and green pepper pizza and it is always a crowd pleaser. The toppings vs crust ratio is spot on; 40crust/60toppings, or 50crust/50toppings! Due to the topping vs crust ratio,  the crust is medium thick to support the weight of the toppings. It's fluffy and baked to perfection. They use a homemade pizza sauce that is rich, flavorful, and most importantly delicious. I am pretty sure scientists of big pizza chains secretly steal Niko's sauce to try decipher their secret recipe. It's that good. 

If you are ever downtown, on 17th ave, or just wanting to try a place where a Calgary Yelp addict has declared to be THE BEST PIZZA IN CALGARY, I highly recommend checking this place out! You wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"Never thought I'd say this but you don't need extra cheese. Lol. Really good sauce and I mean really good. I'm a pineapple guy and they put on tons. Fast delivery was fast and hot. Oh crap. ........ I almost forgot the crust
 Might be the best crust in town. Anyways really good pizza I highly recommend Nikos pizza.And 10 percent off for pick up orders. Cmon."}
{"text":"Pizza, pizza, pizza. PIZZA, pizza, pizza. Me love this far-from-home location! Come visit 1912 Calgary and pick up a great, pub-style pizza. Mondo amounts of cheese, with that crispy top layer, quality topping and lots of 'em; this place has that kinda pie. And a decent price, if you pickup (plus a discount for picking up). I cannot recommend this gem enough."}
{"text":"You nailed it, Nico! Your pizza is always outstanding, but tonight was above and beyond. Everyone, buy Nico's pizza... It's the best in town!"}
{"text":"It's convenient having this pizza place less than a block away from where I live. I always thought it was strange that no one was ever in there, but after reading reviews, I realized that it's more of a to go type of pizza place. I've been here twice now, and I have not been disappointed. The pizza comes out quickly, and the 10% off for picking it up isn't bad either. If you're looking for a quick, convenient, tasty pizza in the Beltline area, this is a great stop."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza I have ever had. Everytime I'm eating any other company's pizza I desperately crave a slice of Niko's in it's place."}
{"text":"Another YELP win!  My fianc√© and I were trying to find a new casual pizza place in Calgary and came across this hidden gem when Yelp searching.
Very tiny (maybe 4 tables), so most people just order for pick up or delivery but we stayed and ate there.
Ordered a pepperoni pizza (if you read my reviews you will see this is a staple in my diet) and found it cooked to perfection - just a perfect amount of cheese and the crust was crisp all the way on the bottom too!  
My only negative was that they didn't have green olives or Kalamata olives - even though it is a Greek establishment.
My recommendation is for the owners to walk about 5 doors down to the Kalamata grocery on the corner and get the proper olives!
We will def eat this pizza again but we will be ordering out the next time!"}
{"text":"I've been living more than 3years in beltline and It used to be our No.1 pizza place in YYC, but got disappointed tonight... Now we get less ingredients than before. It used to be big-loaded pizza but not anymore....Still taste ok but not super good as before... feel so sad ... We lost our favorite pizza place"}
{"text":"Just a bit off the main track off 17th, but well worth the 2 block to this quality pizza place...reminds me of a real italian eatery w/ its brick wall store front.

Ordered the pepperoni, and i recall the good portion and plenty of good cheese.

Free side street parking.

Just a few tables but not a pizza by the slice joint, they also sell subs too, which judging by the brisk pickup orders, looked pretty good portions too...will have to remember this for my next work trip there ;)"}
{"text":"Niko's is hands down the best pizza in the city. I order the \"Niko's Special\" everytime, and everytime it is pure heaven. It tastes amazing cold the next morning too. Trust me, I've tried all in the area, Boston pizza, lil Caesars, and Pizza Hut, and Niko's blows them all out of the water.   

I love you Niko."}
{"text":"Niko's has opened up where Fat Tony's used to be and it reminds me of the pizza place back in the small town I grew up in. Greasy, cheesy goodness.

Niko's has a few different pizzas on it's menu. You'll find The Classics (plain cheese, pepperoni only, etc.), Specialty Pizzas (Pepperoni & Feta, Back Bacon & Tomatoes, Hawaiian and so forth), The Greens (meatless options like the Athenian-spinach, tomatoes, black olives and feta) and Premium (American Cheeseburger, Nice to Meat Ya, Mexican Taco and a few more). If none of these pique your palate, you can also build your own.

The interior has been recently renovated with a simple, clean, black and white decor and a couple of high tables and chairs to sit at. Mostly though you'll be looking to take your pizza to go. Ready in about 20 minutes, I came home with the American Cheeseburger. Price wise, it's not cheap. It's $20.00 for a 10-inch Premium. However, it had a decent amount of meat hiding under all that cheese. Two pieces was enough for this girl (although I know people who would easily finish the whole pizza). 

Of note: Niko's is currently offering 10% off all pizzas and is advertising that it also makes subs. 

Also, the door sticks. Be sure to close it behind you on a cold day."}
{"text":"I'll echo a theme I've been seeing in other reviews: I've walked by Niko's for years but it took me until last night to order from them. Sorry I waited. Since the departure of Nick's from 14 St there's been a dearth of good Greek bar pizza in the west beltline/lower mt royal/bankview areas, at least nothing that was the perfection that that particular location of Nick's was. 

Last night I was browsing local places on Skip the Dishes and there was Niko's. Threw caution to the wind, got a 12\" ham and mushrooms. Not exactly cheap- $21 before delivery charge. It came exactly as promised and first noticing: holy hell this is a heavy pizza. Yes it came to almost $30 with tip but this is EASILY dinner for two. And it was delicious! I cannot imagine who'd ever ask for extra cheese (an option on Skip) as it's loaded with cheese. Good distribution of toppings, good foccacia crust that's crispy where it needs to be, and an absolutely superb sauce that's ample. I loved it- but I might have loved it even more cold on day 2 (today). It was like the best open-faced ham and cheese sammie- did not have to be heated up, just perfect.

New fave!"}
{"text":"I live up the street and never tried their pizza. Working at the coffee shop one day with my co worker and we needed a change. Ordered pepperoni and mushroom. By far the best thick crust pizza. Reminded me of Valasis pizza on Center st and McKnight when it was still open. My new favorite pizza joint from now on."}
{"text":"Niko: The Greek God of Pizza. 

Picture this: Tuesday night after a day of hard work, too lazy to cook dinner, hop on skip the dishes, browse for 5 minutes, realize Niko's Pizza is in the Top 5 by Skip Score. Commit.

I had zero expectations when I first ordered my Medium-sized (10\"?) pepperoni pizza. This thing is loaded with cheese and it was cooked to perfection. The crust, the sauce, the cheese, the pepperoni, all delicious. 

I'm guilty of ignoring Niko's Pizza numerous times, I repent and I can only hope for forgiveness with this 5 Star review. 

The pizza messiah is not italian, he's greek(?). 

Disclaimer: I love italians, if you're a mobster please don't kill me."}
{"text":"I know what you're thinking...should I order from Niko's?

The answer, dear reader, is a resounding HELL YES!

I have lived in my Beltline condo for 7 years and have never had food delivered until about 2 months ago.  

I live 3 blocks from Niko's and am practically in a relationship with the guy that delivers.  And why not?  He's always super friendly.  He brings me redonkulously tasty food.  Best of all, he has not mentioned that I should probably cut down on pizza eating!

This is my too lazy to cook, guilty pleasure, comfort food...guess what, it can be yours too!"}
{"text":"Nikos pizza isn't the usual pizza place.  Independent from any chain place, everything literally IS made from scratch, as opposed to factory made dough from head office and all that.  The crust itself already makes a huge difference, being dence, seasons and filling on it's own, let alone the layers and layers of toppings on any of the offerings.  I've tried the Nikos special and the Olympian so far, and each time quite impressed.  Of course, for this kind of quality you do pay for (don't expect some cheapo medium pizza for $5 a la Little Caesar), but at the same time, it's a far superior pizza as well, and definitely worth the cost."}
{"text":"Ordered for delivery and it was really good!  Hard to find a place to love for pizza these days, this spot comes darn close."}
{"text":"I am full of regret. Why?
That I have lived in this area for 5 years and my last night here I choose to order from Nikos and IT IS AMAZING.

It's the perfect greek-za! As my husband really detests greek style pizza as they are usually too thick and soggy, Nikos is the excellent blend of traditional pizza pie and greek influence.

Their tomato sauce is fantastic and packed full of flavour.

Also great prices and lovely location. I was pleasantly surprised how beautiful the interior is.
So don't be a chump and get chain pizza when Nikos is what you need, even my husband loved it."}
