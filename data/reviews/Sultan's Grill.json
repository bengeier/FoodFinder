{"text":"Great Summerlin North area Mediterranean fare cafe. Good food at nice prices. Good service, clean, relaxing environment."}
{"text":"Time and time again I ate at this place and loved it... but this time, I was disgusted. I decided to go with a friend today but we were in a rush so we got the food to go, I got the skewer and side salad (in a separate smaller box). Went home, ate the chicken  skewer, awesome, no problem. Then opened the salad and a COCKROACH ran out of the box. I won't be going back there again."}
{"text":"I am new to Yelp. Here are my star ratings:  1 star = Terrible. Multiple things went wrong. Never going back. 2 star = Not good. I will not go back, but it wasnt absolutely awful. 3 star = Good, not great. I wouldnt go out of my way, but I *would* go back. 4 star = Excellent food. I really liked it. I could be a regular here. 5 star = Phenomenal food. Something truly special here.  Maybe I was spoiled during the 5 years I lived in ATL. Med Grill in Decatur. Phenomenal. The little hole-in-the-wall place on Broad Street near my office at GSU. Yum. I guess I had it good.  I started to worry when I asked if they ever featured cabbage rolls. They guy \"cooking\" looked at me with a blank stare and said, \"my wife is Polish, she makes cabbage rolls...\" Awesome.  I ordered a small Greek salad, hummus, a falafel wrap, and the kibbe special.  The hummus and falafel wrap were both bland. The pita bread was dry. The greek salad was good, with a generous amount of feta and plenty of chick peas. The kibee special was probably the best part of the meal, but they didnt have laban to go with it.  They people working there were nice enough.  Oh, last straw. The baklava was absolutely awful. Dry and tasted terrible."}
{"text":"Sultan's Grill just opened a new location in Henderson on Horizone Ridge Pkwy. I was very excited to see they were opening! I went there the first day, just 2 hours after they had opened their doors. As I stepped into the restaurant, I was instantly greeted with a great big smile and \"hi welcome to  Sultan's Grll\"! I love a place with excellent customer service!!  I ordered the gyro, it was a good size portion, simple - beef & lamb meat, 9\" pita, tomatoes, onions (I ordered without) and sauce on the side. The only thing that's missing was the flavor. Overall It was just bland for me. They could definitely take it up a notch on the flavor.  Overall, great customer service, fast and decent prices."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. I used to live in the neighborhood and would order from here at least once a month if not more. Now I'm farther away and only get food from here 3-4 times a year. My favorite is the chicken shwarma dinner that comes with rice or fries, a white sauce in a cup, a salad, a full pita, and garnish. I love the seasoning on the chicken and that it's thin pieces with no fat. It can get dry though because it's cooked so well done (which is my preference) so I use the creamy dressing for the salad as a sauce. This dressing is sooo good! It's very flavorful and has good consistency - not too runny like some dressings from take-out places. It's kind of ranchy and garlicky and just delicious. I always get a few extra dressings with my order.   The dish comes with a sauce that is supposed to be like a tzatziki but they have a tzatziki sauce for the gyros that's different. I don't know what the white sauce is that comes with the meal but I don't like it. It's much thinner/more watered down than either the dressing or tzatziki and has little flavor. I toss it if I forget to tell them I don't want it. The rice is fantastic. The fries are steak fries and are really good as they're crispy, not soggy.  The garnish is called torshi and consists of diced purple onion, pickled beets, and pickled cabbage and something else I love (minus the onion which I hate). I guess I really like flavorful foods with good spices - and I'm not talking about hot spices because I don't care for heat just for the sake of heat - so this place just rings all the bells for me.   The salad is basic with lettuce, a couple grape tomatoes, and a couple slices of cucumber. The lettuce is very fresh but watery so I rarely eat it with my meal though I do steal the dressing out of it. The pita is hot and crispy. For a couple dollars extra, I can get a side of baba ganoush or hummus on my plate as well. I don't really like hummus but the baba ganoush is very garlicky and very good. I have had the chicken and beef kabobs which are good but in my opinion, the shwarma is better and more filling. The gyros are good but I think I like another take-out place better for gyros because the meat isn't as flavorful or cooked as well. Some places put cucumber in sour cream and call that tzatziki but this place has real tzatziki with cucumber and yogurt. It's not the best but good.    The Greek salad is very good but again, watery lettuce. I'm happy they clean their lettuce but they need to spin it or something to get all the water off because it dilutes the dressing. We've ordered the family dinner with 4 meats and tons of rice, salad, pita, and torshi. It's a pretty good deal but the meat portions don't feed as many people as indicated especially when your meats are kabobs. Despite my minor complaints, Sultan's Grill is one of my favorite places!"}
{"text":"I love the food here and I have been coming here for a while now. Everyone is friendly and accommodating. I usually order a chicken salad, yellow rice, and hummus with tomatoes."}
{"text":"Walked in this place thinking I'm not gonna like this and to my surprise it was the most amazing food I've had in a long time Thank you so much"}
{"text":"I have been going here for years for gyros.  I'm not sure if they changed their recipe (if homemade) or are using a new brand, but the gyro meat now has no flavor or spice.  What a disappointment. Also, the manager is never friendly.  They need some competition in the Summerlin area."}
{"text":"Sultans Grill makes the best Greek salad I have ever had! I could easily eat here five times a week but have to limit myself to once or twice so the staff won't think I'm a maniac. If you're not one for salads they have a variety of sandwiches and meat plates for very reasonable prices. Additionally (and partly to cover up the fact I'm squeezing an additional visit out of my week) I've utilized their catering options to feed the clients I call on as a sales rep. I've received nothing but positive feedback on food quality and taste. The service is awesome, friendly and speedy and if I haven't sold you yet, it's a family run local business, and who doesn't like to support that?"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! They messed up my order and would not replace it, after they initially said they would! I came back the FOLLOWING day to get my MEAL REPLACEMENT and they refused it, SAYING there was a misunderstanding and instead offered me 10% off my next 3 purchases. Wow! YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME!? Horrible customer service! They claimed that even though I had specifically requested NO ONIONS they claimed that having onions mixed in with my food and meat was not a good enough excuse to replace my meal! Even though I explained that It ruined the taste to where I didn't eat it! If you ever go hear just hope they get your OVER PRICED order right, because if it's messed up, it's on you!!! NOT WORTH IT. DON'T GO HERE!"}
{"text":"As most places here, it is a bit americanized, but its still very good! The chicken should be cooked s little longer and be shaved a bit thinner for a more turkish schwarma, but still tastes absolutely fantastic. I highly recommend to anyone seeking shaved schwarma or gyros. (Also, pretty great baklava)"}
{"text":"I order from Sultan's all the time because their delivery service is fast and reliable.  The inside of the restaurant isn't much, but the food is great (I love their gyros).  The hummus and baklava leave a little to be desired for, but otherwise, I'd definitely recommend Sultan's for yummy, cheap Greek food."}
{"text":"Place is good. Sultan sandwich is awesome. Their fries r awesome too. I really enjoy this place a lot"}
{"text":"Horrible!! Waste of money!  Yuck!  They screwed up my order twice?! And I went back to support a local business.  Ughhh never again.  There are many places for Greek etc food in Vegas. Do not go here if you want authentic. The meat that they slice off looks old asf and tastes stale and no quality. The end."}
{"text":"Always eat at this location and really like the good here but on MORE than one occasion they close early without any kind of sign or reason , I guess it depends on if there's anyone eating there or not ...today's excuse was its Memorial Day which is actually tomorrow. Your guess is as good as mine if they're open tomorrow  I didn't see a sign in the window.."}
{"text":"Unbelievably good! Super fresh ingredients, not too heavy, friendly staff. I recommend the gyro salad with house dressing! Yum"}
{"text":"This was my first try of Mediterranean food and wasn't impressed. Food seemed old and dry. Maybe because i went near closing time."}
{"text":"I've been ordering from sultans grill for about 7 years now and until recently the food has been fantastic.   This last time I ordered a chicken kabob plate with rice.    What I received was a burnt tasteless chicken kabob with fries.   This will be the last time I order from this place.   It's a shame.  It used to be great."}
{"text":"The Greek salad with chicken is just so good, always a go to. And they give you warm pita bread"}
{"text":"We have ordered from them numerous times in the past and have dined in as well.  Have been going here since they opened.  Picked up food tonight and it was awful.  Gyro was sliced way too thick and ice cold.  Chicken kabob was hard and dry and tasted like it was cooked days ago and microwaved to warm it but was ice cold as well.  Both platters were served on salad and also a included was another salad with each dinner.  Not sure what that was all about.  Will not be going back again.  Too bad as it was one of our favorites for Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"This place is bomb to get some Mediterranean / Greek food. It's reasonably priced for the potion that you get.  My favorite thing to order is the falafel and also the beef shwarma. Each costs around $10. Great value and the food tastes pretty good.  The service is quick and friendly. Nice place to eat downtown if you're in the area and craving some good quality Mediterranean food!"}
{"text":"Great addition to the small downtown/courthouse area lunch spots. Food was fast and fresh and service was friendly. I ordered the Fatoosh salad with chicken and an order of Sultan's bread. Before my order came up, someone's Greek salad was up and I nearly changed my order because the Greek salad looked that good!   The Fatoosh salad was good: romaine lettuce with tangy/sumac dressing and the crispy pita chips were sizable and still crispy despite the dressing. The chicken was tender and quite flavorful. Perfect lunch portion! The bread was eh.   Will definitely be back (for the Greek salad next time) and would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The sign on the window said \"help wanted\" and boy do they need it.  The food was very slow to come out and was only fair.  We ordered an appetizer of Sultan's bread. It did not come out until our main meal so not much of an appetizer.  We ordered a chicken salad and gyro sandwiches with the salad ready in about 15 minutes and 20 minutes to get the gyro sandwiches.  The salad came with dressing which they called vinaigrette but was mainly oil with a very little bit of vinegar.  When asked for another type dressing they only had a creamy which we did not prefer.  Asked for a side of tzatziki instead and they said they would have to charge extra for that.  Had grape leaves as an appetizer and they were soggy and not very tasteful.  The gyro meat was not very warm/hot in the sandwich after 20 minutes waiting for it to come out.  Definitely not a good Sunday lunch experience at this place and we will not be back.  Not sure what it is about this shopping complex but restaurants and food places definitely struggle here.  Can't believe this place outlasted Samurai Sam's.  The employees did not seem very enthused to have customers there."}
{"text":"I don't ever give a bad review on small restaurants but I'm going to have to on this one... the food was just horribly bad!! take into consideration that I was really hungry and I still didn't even eat the salad.   Their \"Homemade House Dressing\" it's just so thick that it looks and taste like Mayo mixed with ranch dressing its horrible... the rice was just so salty that I still have the salt in my mouth. the gyro meat look old and it taste like old bologna but dryer. The \"fresh\" diced tomato and onions let's say it wasn't that fresh... The main reason that I'm doing this is because in their menu it says \"everybody get greeted with a smile\" I'm sorry but the lady that was at the cashier was not courteous at all even when I told her that it was my first time there. She was not helpful to tell me what Torshi was she just pointed at the menu (i know it says on the menu but where I was looking at it didn't). It also says your food is cooked to order, \"one positive thing: it only took 2min and 30 secs after I paid to get my food so they must have some amazing stoves. and all this for about $8.00 with no drink.   I've has Greek food before and I love it!!! I used to buy it at least once a week where I used to work before, all I know is that I'm not going back there EVER AGAIN... Margret C. review seems to know a lot about the menu makes me wonder if she works there or has friends in that business!!!  Just my opinion, I welcome you to go try it and waste $7-$14.00 on horrible food."}
{"text":"My best friend and I were starving so he yelped food to find something in the area that sounded good. This place caught his attention so we checked it out. I had the chicken shish kabob and grilled shrimp kabob which were both very delicious. Salad came with it and was very fresh. My best friend had the ground beef kabob along with chicken and the ground beef wasn't that tasty but it wasn't nasty. If ever back in that neighborhood I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Get me to the Greek! (As in any restaurant that serves Greek food.)   If that sentence fits you as well, I suggest trying Sultan's Grill. This small downtown eatery is hidden away in an unassuming space shared with Danna's Caribbean Grill (another choice find!). But despite the lack of ambiance, the prices are reasonable; the portions are plentiful; and the food is pretty amazing.   I had a Greek salad with gyro meat, which was one of their $8.99 lunch specials (served with pita bread and a drink). This was much more than a traditional Greek salad, with additional toppings of beets, chickpeas, and the aforementioned meat. I had never added meat to a Greek salad before, but now that I've discovered what I was missing, I don't think I'll ever go back. And this was some of the best gyro meat I have ever had--tender and spicy--so I'm sure the gyros themselves are fantastic, too.   Happily, I have just found another of downtown Las Vegas' hidden gems. If you're in the middle of town and want a taste of Greece or the Middle East, trek on over to Sultan's Grill!."}
{"text":"Good food and great prices. Had a gyro and a Greek salad. The staff was friendly and greeted you when you walked in the door. I will be going back."}
{"text":"Going to have to say it's a 3 out of 5. The owners are awesome people, they are quite attentive when you are in the establishment, they even have quite a few regulars. So service is a plus, their friendliness is warming. Now as far as the food goes I have to say it's so so. Coming from California this is the first Mediterranean restaurant I try which sort of met my taste buds. Both times I have gone I got the Chicken Kabob once with rice the other with fries in addition to the vinaigrette salad. The chicken was a bit over cooked, slightly dry not too impressive. Fries were way too crisp some were over fried, rice was delicious so was the vinaigrette! Slightly disappointed when I got take out they added no napkins or utensils in the bag. Pricing was about average $11 and some change for the Kabob. Like I said they have a nice feel service wise other than that food is decent."}
{"text":"Sign on the window says \"Pita Sandwiches \". I ordered the falafel plate and there was a pita like flat bread with it. I explained to the nice guy who worked there that this is not a pita. He tried to explain their attempt at a pita but I stopped him. Clearly they don't understand how falafel is served.  So I attempted to wrap up the falafel as best as I could but you could not put any of the other vegetables in with it. The tahini sauce was bland but I needed it because the falafel was so dry. The had a tasty hot sauce that I had to pay an extra 50 cents for that saved the meal. The falafel actually was tasty just too dry and impossible to eat properly without a real pita. They had excellent steak fries and yellow rice. I know they can do better but just don't understand Mediterranean cuisine"}
{"text":"I am not sure why I have waited so long to try this wonderful place. I work right here and have been to every other place in this shopping plaza. One day my son met me for lunch and he is vegan, so was trying to decide where we could go. We stopped to read the menu, and he saw he could eat here.  I have been back many times since. The service is always great. The lady who takes the orders is so nice.  The prices are amazing. 5.00 for a burger and fires. It is one of the best burgers I have ever had. The fries crispy and perfectly seasoned.  The spinach pie is a slice of heaven.  This place is now my once a week treat."}
{"text":"We called in ahead because they take a bit to make the food. We ordered too much, as there portions are a little bit on the generous side. Overall the food here is good. Today I tried the Greek burger. It was a regular party with Greek toppings. I almost broke a tooth biting into it as there was still a seed in the middle of one of the olives."}
{"text":"We ordered our food and was given a number. The counter person passing out the orders called every number except ours. We watch him bring a bag up that he tied, and then untied because he could not find the number. He still did not find our number and retied the bag. We watch him set the bag aside and continue to call other numbers after ours. We go ask him where is our number. He asks us what we ordered and when we tell him, he tells us \"oh here it is\". My french fries were burnt and now cold from sitting so long because he could not find our number. The Curry chicken and rice looked disgusting and very dry. Not enough cuury sauce.Do not waste your time eating here, unless your like cold dry food."}
{"text":"I love this place. They're always friendly and always explain what the dishes are when I have questions. The baklava is seriously addicting. I've had the gyro,the gyro salad,the spinach pie and the cheeseburger. Everything is delicious! The burger is  topped with fresh tomato,lettuce,onion and pickle. It has a nice char flavor to it and it's accompanied with fries which are so good. I enjoy coming here for my lunch. It's a top pick for me when it comes to Greek food."}
{"text":"The staff here is very friendly and accommodating. They have pristine food, and I love the atmosphere of the place.  The price is a little steep, but you get great whole foods for your money"}
{"text":"So was looking for a different Greek food place since I just moved to summerlin area. Gyro Time is super close and good but wanted a different option. After searching Sultans Grill came up and had fairly good reviews. Being it was getting close to their closing time of \"9pm\" I headed out and rushed over showing up 8:45. When entered placed was empty and there was a lady and guy in kitchen, As walked in I said hello, and got an immediate response of \"we're closed!\" No hello or sorry, just we're closed. So I mention well on your door it's says your open til 9pm? And then got the response of \"we're put of food!\" (With a little bit of attitude). Being how that situation should of been handle differently being that I am in the service industry, I will never go there again and I will be telling everyone I know to stay away from the extremely rude staff their."}
{"text":"This is not one of the best Mediterranean style restaurants in town. It is conveniently located in the Village Center shopping center where many locals in the area frequent.   I have not visited Sultan's Grill in months. I used to come regularly over the span of seven years. I stopped coming frequently due to a rapid decline in customer service, food quality, and the inflated pricing for what you get.   My previous experience nearly ended it for me when the staff couldn't wait to rush me out the door fifteen minutes before closing time. The lamb was cold and appeared to be scraps - as though they turned everything off and put everything away prior to my walking in and then made my food with what they were going to toss out. So naturally I thought - coming in around closing time is not a good idea since closing time is not literally when they close.  This visit, I figured I would see how the restaurant is handling customer service and food quality prior to dinner rush around 4:30pm. Well, customer service is still not very good. Staff is much more preoccupied with dinning at the front table and chatting with friends than providing even a small amount of service.   The food quality this round was good. We each had a large Greek salad with gyro meat. I have to that say though that serving a large salad on a flat plastic dinner plate makes tossing and eating the salad a little difficult. Since all the toppings are on top, you kind want to toss the salad without dumping your salad on the table. The pita bread that comes with the salad is good and they offer two types of dressing for the Greek salad. I always get the house vinaigrette."}
{"text":"From the service to the food this place is always on point. My favorite is the gyro plate with rice and a salad with their special made creamy dressing. Ooo and do not forget the homemade hot sauce! I absolutely love this place. We frequent this place at least three times a month since moving to Vegas in April. I would eat here daily if I could, yep it is that good."}
{"text":"Mediocre, as far as Mediterranean in Vegas goes. BF picked up takeout here after a trip to the courthouse across the street. The gyro salad is fresh, but doesn't have much meat on it and the dressing is odd. The chicken shwarma plate was disappointing: dry meat, tzatziki is plain sour cream, pita is hard and clearly store-bought. The rice was nicely seasoned, though. Not at all worth a second visit."}
{"text":"Food was not fresh tasting and certainly for anyone who knows what Mediterranean food should taste like, this is a no go! Falafel was clearly made from some factory made rehydrated powder mix. Pita bread was thin and dry. Kebobs were DRY DRY DRY. Chicken Shawarma was bland, dry and didn't even remind me of Shawarma of any kind. The Gyro, is once again, that same factory bought pre-made and frozen mystery meat that so many places serve these days. Rice was flavorless and didn't even taste fresh. Hummus was terrible, could have also been made from some powder or bought from some supplier rather than made in house. You get better or similar Hummus at your local market. Tehini sauce was like water. It's unfortunate that Mediterranean, Greek and Middle Eastern food restaurants are popping all  over the place as fast, cheap and catering to a public who do not know what it should really taste like, so they don't know when they are getting vamboozled. Many places seem to offer similar menu items at similar prices and similarly horrible quality!  This one is just another one of those. Don't be fooled. This food is nothing that a Greek or a middle easterner would consider edible! If you served Falafel like that anywhere in the middle east or Mediterranean, it would not fly - unless it was flung right back at you by angry customers."}
{"text":"What we're all looking for in a restaurant, always consistent, delicious tasting food, great customer service, clean, and an awesome family owning it. Nice job, keep it up."}
{"text":"Update*** the young lady is not the owner. She is the owners sister and I apologize but, I was wrong. She is hilarious lol! I mistook her dry humor for a crappy personality! Sorry...  P.s. The hummus thing still stands though...   Awesome food!"}
{"text":"Very good Mediterranean food.  I had the vegetarian platter.  Lots of food for the price and everything was tasty.  The dolmades were excellent - some of the best I have ever tasted!"}
{"text":"The 1 star is because they are across from the courthouse.  The food is awful, the chicken gyro was dry and they put an odd pickled beet and cabbage mixture on the gyro...why?  The taziki (sp?) sauce was straight sour cream with scarce brown representations of cucumber...it had no real flavor.  Overall, VERY disappointing.  I should have had pizza right next door!"}
{"text":"Meh. Ordered the peasant salad.   It was a Friday and I think they had too many garbanzo beans versus cucumber beets, etc.    I think they are closed on the weekends and might have been running out of the better ingredients.   Not impressed.      I have had the Greek salad which is much better than the peasant salad.   I don't think I will be back."}
{"text":"This place has the best food!! I have had pretty much everything on the menu and have yet to be disappointed. It doesn't even matter which location you go to the quality and customer service you receive is top notch."}
{"text":"I really like this place, I've been coming here off and on for over 5 years... The inside is rather plain, but the food is great! I usually get the chicken swarma, or the beef shiskafta, and the lemon chicen rice soup... The staff is always friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"Stop by here the other day to get a gyro and to try their spinach pie. Great food and great service. Highly recommend the spinach pie (Mon-wed-fri only). Staff are very friendly will continue to patron this spot."}
{"text":"Good food, close to my house.  THey nickel and dime you to death though lol Charge you for extra sauce, substituting items etc."}
{"text":"Service is excellent. I was grumpy and quiet but was happily served anyway.  I ordered a falafel wrap. The falafel was cold and crushed apart for some reason. I should have asked more questions before ordering. The pita is chewy and bland. They include pickled beets which I was unaware of but were good. I would order them on the side, however. They include hummus in their falafel wrap for some reason. Taziki or tahini or something would make more sense.  There is no counter menu to order from."}
{"text":"I rarely write reviews, but hands down one of the best Mediterranean places I've been to...you can order anything from menu and be assured it'll be delicious & fresh! The Kafta kebob & chicken are amazing!"}
{"text":"Best food ever. Love this place. Never disappointed. Wish I could eat here every day!! Staff is always friendly. My boys love to eat here too."}
{"text":"If the yellow rice here is heaven, then St. Peter should be greeting customers at the door. The rice here is, in a word, amazing. Perfectly fluffy, flavorful, and mild enough to complement any entree but able to stand on it's own. Fabulous quality.  A friend and former Vegas resident loves this place and recommended it- he is confident it is the best Mediterranean in Las Vegas. Cursory first visit suggests this place definitely is more than it appears!  Menu includes the usual suspects: falafel, chicken shawarma, dolmas, salads, and gyros, with specialties like the gyro or shwarma bowl, roasted eggplant salad, three different kinds of hummus, and their star dish (for good reason!) the spinach pie-- available only Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.  Portions for pita wraps are giant, rice is amazing, salads are fresh, and staff is friendly. Definitely a neighborhood staple, just wish they were closer to my actual neighborhood."}
{"text":"I love this place ! There food is so good and the hummus is so amazing ! Every time we order for dinner or food for lunch this place is usually our first pick ! The only down side is the chicken can be sometimes salty but other than that it's perfect . They have great customer service to I would recommend !"}
{"text":"My  place to grab a gyro and take to the golf course! Always fresh and tasty.   Service is impeccable! Marie is the best, she always remembers me and my order! Luv her."}
{"text":"I tried this restaurant for the first time 3 days ago. I had the Chicken Sharwarma Sandwich that was recommended by other reviews on here. I LOVED it! I went back again this evening had the Chicken Sharwarma again. LOVED IT! Yesterday I went through withdrawls with out my sandwich. I will be back again and again and again. My new favorite spot!"}
{"text":"My coworkers had a good experience so I wanted to try this place out. I called at 12 on a Monday and was put on hold for 10 minutes before the call disconnected. When I tried calling back the number wasn't working anymore, WEIRD. After trying the number 10 times, I figured they were busy for lunch, finally got an answer and put my order in. They quoted me 40 minutes for delivery which was fine because we have lunch at 1. I got a call 10 minutes after I placed my order saying it was ready. I appreciated the fast delivery but I think the food was rushed and it was not good at all. The red hummus was so watery, it was like soup. The meat in the gyro was dry and the chicken shawarma was extremely dry as well. The only thing that was tasty was the shrimp skewers. I understand it was lunch time but I would have been fine waiting 40 minutes and maybe have the food taste better than a quick 10 minute delivery."}
{"text":"I love this place! The owners are friendly and accomodating.  The hummus is fresh tasting and creamy.  Their warm pita is super tasty whether you eat it with the hummus or one of their salads.  I have to admit I'm so addicted to the hummus and their creamy dressing that I always get a salad and a side of hummus.   I've tried the chicken shwarma sandwich as well...tasty, not dry..great.  Bill the delivery guy is just as great and friendly as the rest of the staff.  what a great place to go to instead of the chain fast food places!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love sultans and the entire staff ! My favorites are the chicken kabob sandwich with no torshi and their spinach pie !!!"}
{"text":"This is our go to 'don't feel like cooking' place. I get the chicken shwarma dinner- love it. Both options of rice or fries are crazy good. Sometimes the chicken is dry, hence 4 not 5 stars."}
{"text":"Ordered a combo.   Kofka was tasty but dry.  The chicken was dry as a bone. Asked for an extra sauce to make the sawdust chicken palatable.   They wanted to charge me for it.   I paid 18.25 for a combo and they can't give me an extra sauce to make it edible.   Unreal.  The fries were way under done and soggy.   I was hoping to find my new Kafka and Shwarma fix,  but this isn't it.   What a shame.   Look elsewhere."}
{"text":"I get the Chicken Schwarma every time. The pita bread is the best I've had and the chicken is uniquely prepared. Don't pass on the baklava. The small square for a dollar will satisfy any craving!"}
{"text":"Ordered take out and when we got home realized they had forgotten part of our order. I called over and they offered to credit me or deliver the remainder of our order to my house. Everyone makes mistakes but Sultans Grill went above and beyond to fix it for us. Much appreciated! Their food is always fresh and flavorful and if I had to offer one criticism, the chicken shawarma was a little dry. Def our fav go to restaurant for Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"The worst Mediterranean experience!  The food was dry and not tasty, too much oil and fell like cheap ingredients:( Also the owner was rude an inpatient!  I won't be back here..."}
{"text":"I had a Chicken Shorba Lunch Plate it was 8.99 ..pita bread and Chicken was Super Dry ...fries were soaked in salad whey got to me .. i will not recommend to any one"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this spot! Best gyros & hummus in the valley. Also very convenient to where I live, centrally located in Summerlin."}
{"text":"This place is great! I have tried quite a few of their items and so far everything has been amazing. Fresh, very well seasoned and super yummy. Every time I go there I am greeted with a friendly smile. I just wanted to say THANK YOU for all you do!"}
{"text":"I came here looking for lunch while I was in town for the holidays. I ordered the chicken shawarma bowl. Given the price for the bowl, it did not come with rice or pita bread. Granted I did not ask if it came with those items. In addition to this I thought the chicken was a little dry. Given that their are plenty of choices in the area, I would definitely go to another establishment versus this one."}
{"text":"Put some fries and hot sauce on that chicken shawarma wrap, it's called Sultan style.  I'm just kidding.  I just made that up... don't say that to the cashier, they will be confused.  But you should still ask them to put fries and hot sauce on your wrap, it's a nice touch.  Thank you My T for the tip brosky!  This place has really bad reviews.  Granted service is not like you're going to get at Robouchon, but cmon, it's not that bad.  I really like the fatoush, it's more authentic than most places in Summerlin.  The chicken shawarma was great.  So juicy, not dry at all, I'm surprised at what everyone else is saying.  I will come back!  Someone mentioned waiting 15 minutes for their food?  Is that really that bad?  Cmonnnnnnnnn"}
{"text":"Best falafel ever! Great customer service! Mannie is awesome!"}
{"text":"I went to lunch here.  It's a small family restaurant.  I went in early so it wasn't busy so service was good.  I had the kafta lunch plate.  the meat had good flavor but was a little dry.  The rice was not seasoned enough.  The pita bread seemed like it was out of a package."}
{"text":"This is a decent place. Tiny little Greek bistro that has some nice food. Not the absolute best in the valley, but it's relatively decent. Only one thing on the menu that I can eat any day: chicken shwarma. It's the bomb! Everything else is okay."}
{"text":"Have been going to Sultans Grill for years. Love supporting local family owned businesses. Try the chicken kabob lunch. Never disappointing."}
{"text":"For the price and all I was disappointed. I know good greek out in Henderson but was here so figured I would try. The hummus was creamy but not as much flavor as other places and the food in general Is pretty average. The people are nice but didn't satisfy my greek craving. The biggest thing for me is the spanikopita isn't available daily!! That's what I would want to run in and get when in the mood."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb! I have been ordering from Sultan's Grill for around six months now and they have been consistently delicious, fast delivery, friendly and accurate! They have great hummus, solid middle eastern offerings and I find their combo platters to be an excellent deal for a quick lunch! I almost never review places, but they seemed really deserving of a positive rating! I just hope they stay consistent. I work in the #dtlv, and have for years, and they really are on the top of the delivery restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"I used to frequent Sultan's Grill a lot in high school. I drove by it last night with a friend and we decided we'd try it out again. I'm not sure if the management has switched over or what but the food was absolutely terrible compared to what it used to be.   We ordered a gyro sandwich, side of hummus and a falafel plate for dinner. This all totaled up to about $27 and it was definitely not worth it. The falafel was quite possibly the worst falafel I've had. They were tiny, overcooked and severely lacking in flavor. The hummus was bland and boring. It tasted like they threw some garbanzo beans in a food processor and considered that hummus, no spices or anything. The rice was mediocre, the tahini sauce was extremely salty and the fries were ok. The pita bread was hard and dry.   As someone who's Middle Eastern I know what quality Middle Eastern food should taste like and this is definitely not it. I will not be returning. I'd rather pay the same prices somewhere else where I know the food will taste edible."}
{"text":"I was astonished of the exceptional service I received today. It was my first time ordering/ eating the food. They greeted me and gave me a really welcomed feeling. They were genuinely interested in my needs and interested in how they could help. They offered me some extra sauce for the beef shawarma including extra spicy sauce for the rest of my friends to try. The sauces including the food itself was phenomenal. However the pita was a little dry and hard but everything else trumps that. Customer service is extremely important to me, because I wouldn't wanna eat at a place that doesn't care for their customers. I highly recommended this place to come eat. The price is fair for it being downtown. Just do it. Come here and eat y'all are welcome as I was welcomed to eat."}
{"text":"I looooove this place! The quality of their food is fresh and delish! I always get the Greek Salad with creamy dressing. You. Can't. Go. Wrong."}
{"text":"I was really rooting for these guys .. Everyone is so nice. Worst pita ever... Sorry."}
{"text":"Tonight I was served a gyro which the meat was burnt with a black char on it.  I've been eating there less frequently as the quality seems to be slipping.   I will not be returning after this."}
{"text":"The food here is great. I've tried almost everything on the menu and there's not one thing I wouldn't recommend. If you haven't eaten here make it a priority to try it. I promise you'll come back!"}
{"text":"Great Food! The Gyro is hands down the best in Vegas. Chicken rice soup was tasty as it gets. Love the homemade hot sauce, on of my favorites!"}
{"text":"I like this place and it is a way better option for lunch compared to fast food or something.  I like the gyros but the chicken shawarma is what I usually get because it's good.  The prices are right and the service is friendly and fast.  Not the worlds best but there are not a lot of shawarma options in vegas and this place is great for lunch."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since they opened ! I LOVE LOVE the chicken shawarma & the rice & the salad & EVERYTHING for that matter. I just tried their. Hot sauce for the 1st time ! Soooooo good ! You gotta go !"}
{"text":"Our family loves this place. Not sure why it only has 3 stars. Perhaps a lot of Greek food snobs (?) The food is really good, great portions and reasonably priced. The service we receive is always so friendly. 5 stars from me for sure."}
{"text":"The food is mediocre at best and overpriced. Meats are on the tougher side. The Greek salad that comes with your meal is disappointing and sad. Nothing about this place really screams Greek or Mediterranean. Unfortunately, I will not be returning."}
{"text":"This is my second review of this place and I really wish I could give Sultan's Grill 5 stars!  The only thing is the fact that at least 4 separate nights when I came to their restaurant and they were OUT OF LAMB and then today during lunch they were OUT OF SPINACH PIES!  I came around 1pm today so luckily, they didn't run out of  the stuff to make Gyros, Fries and Cucumber Sauce.  I am a fan of those.  I could eat their gyros all day and night.  Quick Tip: They have spinach pies on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays only.  I wish I could have the chance to try it out, though.  Also, it appears they are open Sundays per the signa posted today."}
{"text":"The food here is the best and service is good. One problem is that the place needs a cleaning. All the tables were dirty the fridge where the large bottles of water are located the glass was filthy. The trash was over flowing and the young girl behind the counter is texting messages instead of cleaning the place. What a five star place this restaurant could be if only they would use some soap and water. But we still loved the food and the price is right."}
{"text":"Wow, haven't been here in a while but if your looking for the best best hummus this is the best I've ever had!!! Will definitely go again"}
{"text":"Amazing Restaurant ... The food is so delicious !!! Extremely fast Delivery Service !!  Everyone have to try !"}
{"text":"This is a great little family place, and especially wonderful for lunch or take-out.  The owner is a nice guy. It's usually high school kids that work there and they're very friendly. Service is quick. Their food is good. My only \"issue\" is the bread isn't made fresh, though there are many restaurants in Vegas where they don't bake their own pita bread. Sad, but true.  Anyway, their shawarmas are awesome. Before I became vegetarian, I ate their chicken shawarma all the time. Derrricious! (Though I get it without the beets)."}
{"text":"Sultans is my favorite place to get a gyro in Vegas. I really like the taste and quality of their meat. The portions are generous and the price is reasonable. I'll always hit them up when I'm in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Love this place! I have not had anything I haven't liked. My fav is the Greek Salad with chicken and delicious creamy dressing. I wish they would sell it by the bottle. Plus, homemade pitas. MMM."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery, and was wondering when it was coming and the site said at 6:04, it was 5:48 and my stomach was growling, went grab some cheese and doorbell rings, the FOOD IS AMAZING!!!!!"}
{"text":"Very friendly service, and excellent Mediterranean food with lots of vegetarian options. I had the hummus and tabouli sandwich combo with rice. The food was prepared quickly and was a nice sized portion for lunch. The yogurt sauce was great! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Have been coming here for years. The chicken kabob here is so juicy and flavorful I crave it so often! I also like the gyro meat and the chicken strips are surprisingly very tasty. I usually get the meat in a platter form with rice. I also get an extra side of creamy dressing because that stuff is delicious with everything! Only complaint is it can be a little expensive."}
{"text":"I'm a long time sultans grill customer and tonight I tried a new dessert .... A Greek delicacy rolled in shredded phyllo dough. ITS A MUST TRY!  Everything at sultans frill is AMAZING every day but this new dessert delicacy is addictive!!"}
{"text":"Well that was disappointing.  I've been to Sultan's Grill years ago when I lived in Summerlin the first time and figured I'd give it another try after picking up my library books since I remembered it being good.  I ordered a gyro salad and bowl of the lemon chicken rice soup.  First off, the prices had gone up and it kind of hurt paying almost $5 for the soup but I had been craving some good lemon rice soup so I did.  I'm still craving some good lemon rice soup.  The salad was just a ton of romaine lettuce with four grape tomatoes, four slices of cumber, and 4 olives in each corner of the carryout container along with a sprinkling of onions.  They did have a good portion of the gyro meat though but it was a little on the dry side.  Honestly, I will most likely not be back especially since I can get a great salad and better soup a few miles down the road at Market Grill."}
{"text":"If you are thinking of coming here, DONT. I used to be an avid customer, however their service started to decline back in June/July. I don't know what changed. They never get orders right, the food is bland, customer service is slow and rude. AND TODAY, my food was delivered with a piece of rubber glove in it. DO NOT COME HERE."}
{"text":"I really love this place! I get the beef Shawarma sandwich and get their homemade hot sauce to put on it. The hot sauce is so good and not spicy so I highly recommend it with any dish. The food is amazing here and they are really friendly. It gets pretty busy during lunch since the courthouse and everything else is right across the street."}
{"text":"On days that I don't pack my lunch Sultan's has become my go to.  Their beef shawarma plate with choice of rice or fries is $9.99 and comes with a drink, refillable if you are eating in.  I tend to order that or the salad version.  It can get a little busy if you go at the height of lunch time and I have found that calling ahead can be hit or miss.  They do a punch card but that is only applicable to wraps.  The food is good and the serving size is more than fair for the price, and it's always nice to have another downtown option that is fairly healthy."}
{"text":"Quick Mediterranean food, particularly gyros and Greek salads with pita bread.  Prices are fair, and food is fine.  Across the street from the Regional Justice Center (courthouse).  It can get busy, but they keep the line moving.  There are open tables, but no wait service. Not much in the way of atmosphere."}
{"text":"Love this place. We are new to the area but this will be the go to spot for Mediterranean food. Everything we tried was outstanding. From the salad to the gyro meat, even the rice was fantastic. Had to have a pistachio baklava for desert and it was the best I've ever had. The service was really good we were treated very well. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The Sultan is here for you. He provides Gyros upon request and despite his Mediterranean decent serves up burgers and fries as well. The Sultan is able to fulfill any sudden need for shawarma in a pinch, and that is what he is good for. His kingdom lies within village center cir where the mighty Vons once stood before the evil Haggen buried it in the ancient sands."}
{"text":"Nice place, but the food was meh at best. The kafta was dry, the cabbage way too sour, the rice didn't have much flavor.  The tzatziki was overpowering. The only good thing was the hot flat bread."}
{"text":"The name, Sultan is Mediterranean, however, the food is definitely not Mediterranean.   I ordered a Chicken Shawarma plate with rice and drink. The pita bread was dry and the rice did not have much taste, so I asked for some sauce and I was told that would cost me an additional 54 cents.   I do not consider this place to be very Mediterranean and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone at all.   They have a poster on their wall that says, \"your patronage is never taken for granted. Our aim is to satisfy you. To serve you is a real privilege.\"  Yeh, right!"}
{"text":"Sometimes, I crave gyro meat.  Sultan's grill is very close to my house and satisfies my cravings when it gnaws at me and I am too lazy to drive to the Kabob Korner downtown.  Sultan's Grill is average Greek fare.  Good, not great food that will hit the spot when you're hungry.  It really bugs me that they do not have pita, but a more tortilla sized, thin flatbread.  Their grape leaves are unfortunately very oily.  The price is very reasonable for their lunch combos which include a salad and choice of rice or french fries.  Sometimes I think the teenage girl that works there needs to put more clothes on, but that is just my humble, prudish opinion!"}
{"text":"On the phone I asked if it's possible to have as their Gyro salad for it to be half Gyro and a half chicken and the person on the phone told me yes. What she didn't tell me is that it was going to cost me an additional seven dollars from what I Anticipated. You would think a detail like that would get mentioned as there's no question I most likely would not have ordered what I did though they didn't, and I wasn't looking to tell them I was not interested as I was very hungry.  The review is strictly based on a lack of communication which if I would've known, I absolutely would have ordered something else. The ironic part of this is it's really not more meat...  Oh and they charged me $.50 per dressing which was not mentioned to me either on the phone which I think is kind of funny and petty when the woman actually offered on the phone for me to try both dressings.  When it's like that, this place is now not on the top of my list.    The ironic part is the total amount to meat is the same as it would be with 1 meat so it would have been cheaper to get a side of meat than what they gave me here.   For the salad and a sultan plate, which is supposed to only be 5.99 (from what I was told on the phone), my total was just shy of $30. Robbery is a word that comes to my mind. Lame, very lame..."}
{"text":"BY FAR the most flavorful chicken shwarma I have ever tasted and it's bar none. It's marinated chicken breast slices with a distinct Mediterranean seasoning. I opted for rice over the fries and glad I did because it was yellow rice with the brownish-red seasoning sprinkled on the rice and it really accentuated the flavor of the rice. The pita bread comes on top of your plate, the only drawback was that the hummus was subpar but the chicken and rice are so good that this place deserves the 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I like this place for take out -- love their salad dressing ! Get the gyro Greek salad . Yum!!"}
{"text":"I was less than thrilled with their Chicken Shawarma, but that may be because I've had EXCELLENT Chicken Shawarma in Chicago.  However, their Tomato and Cucumber Salad was delicious and refreshing.  I also got their hummus trio, and those were delicious as well.  The flat bread was warm and soft."}
{"text":"The food was good, the service was abysmal. I asked my friend to pick up some food while I was working, and he told me two people who came in after him were served first. Also, I paid for a baklava, and it was not in my take-out bag when I got home. Needless to say, I was not impressed. Very disappointed, which is a shame, since I live so close."}
{"text":"Have been here a few times for a takeout Gyro and fries.  I have not tried the other items yet but what I did try was tasty. The problem is, it's kind of slow getting the food (approx. 10 mins from time of order for my sandwich/fries).  So if you want yours to go, phone in ahead so you don't have to stand around as long."}
{"text":"These other reviews must be from realtives of the owner. because if you ever had real greek food than you wont like this. the chicken is sooooo dry. OMG. they must have new owners because the chicken the dressing the hot sauce was all diffrent and bad. only thing good was the lettuce (not salad) just lettuce and rice. The people were nicer than the old people who were there. but i will take a bad attitude and good food. i want my money back. I could of used my $8 at dairy queen or roccos next door. thumbs down!"}
{"text":"I do come here often and would like to adjust my past review. While not the best in town it doesn't deserve the 2 stars I previously gave"}
{"text":"Sultans Grill is a little tiny restaurant that specializes in Mediterranean food. I've only been here twice and both times I ordered the same thing - Gyro Sandwich that consisted of seasoned sliced beef, tomato and onion wrapped in pita. For the price of the sandwich ($5.99), they were not stingy at all, it was probably the size of a burrito. The sandwich is served with tzatziki sauce on the side and my only advice is...ASK FOR EXTRA SAUCE. This sauce seriously brings together the flavors of the sandwich and you CAN'T, I repeat, CAN'T do without it! The lightness and freshness of the sauce balances out the vegetables and meat contained in the sandwich.   Like I mentioned above, it is a little restaurant so there is limited amount of tables for dine-in customers however, they offer take-out and the sandwich is an excellent choice of you're on-the-go, which I was. Upon entering the cashier was seated at a table but she immediately welcomed me and her service was awesome."}
{"text":"I'm so happy I found this place it's hard to find this type of food in Vegas. They have really good hummus, chicken shawarma, lemon rice soup, fatoosh, tabouli, falafel and comes with lots of bread and sauces. I always get carry out it's a little pricey but totally worth it or maybe I just order a lot haha :)"}
{"text":"Love it. Best Greek food my wife and I have had in memory.  A+, rocks.  Really what more do you need to know from my side?  Oh, details and supporting evidence?  Got it!  We had a vegetarian feast today.  We had the trio hummus app to start, I had a small Greek salad, my wife a small house.  You can't go wrong with either of their dressing choices, we had both and they were excellent. I had the OMG Spinach pie (available Mon, Wed,  Fri only) and my wife had the falafel plate.  Again all excellent.  We got to meet the owners and their family, super nice!  Clean and friendly place to grab a bite.  Very casual dine in and looks like a busy to go order business.  Yum!"}
{"text":"This food was phenomenal. I don't even like Mediterranean food very much and I loved every part of this meal. Got the chicken kabob, salad, and rice lunch plate and it was absolutely the best chicken I've ever eaten in my life."}
{"text":"This review is for 4.5 stars. I used to come here with my old boss, for lunch.   The food is amazing and very reasonable. We would get the combo plate- chicken sharwarma for lunch, $6.95- comes with pita, diced tomatoes, onions, torshi (pickled cabbage & turnips) and choice of fries, rice (very good) or salad. The same dinner combo price is $9.95.  The atmosphere is ok- feels more like a casual deli, though they try with the decor (painted wall scenes depicting the Mediterranean), and it is pretty small. Sometimes we would order and then eat lunch at her house (she lives in the area).   On the menu: appetizers, salads, sandwiches, combos, ala carte, kids menu, desserts, and combo platters for six adults (catering- menu available).  I've been dying to come back but don't really go to this side of town (since I work on another end now, near the Strip). Would love to go back."}
{"text":"We would come back here for the lamb gyro -- it's 5 Stars!  I would give their chicken shawarma plate 3 Stars.  Everything is prepared with EVOO!  This is an old neighborhood restaurant that's always busy, no matter what time it is.  Marie is a delight and we will be returning for sure to try other specials."}
{"text":"Just had the grape leaf appetizer. Amazingly tasty and a huge portion. Not just the 6 grape leaves but the pickled cabbage, beets, pita and hummus were great.  All for $5.99!!!!  I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Food is mediocre but the service is terrible. The cashiers and cooks have terrible attitudes. I'm surprised this place is still open. Keep up the good work you won't last long in summerlin!"}
{"text":"Wow, didn't realize the food was so good here. Amazing service, staff are kind, the place is very clean, and the chili dogs are tasty. Thank you I'll be back."}
{"text":"This is a good little place for lunch. The menu is pretty comprehensive and the prices are fair. They do a good job of giving you lots of variety in a single dish. They have daily specials which can sometimes be a good deal. The meat is pretty tasty and the prices are fair. The staff is nice and they are pretty fast even when they have a crowd. I go here pretty regularly."}
{"text":"The best hidden gem in Summerlin. Had just about everything on the menu over the years and nothing disappoints"}
{"text":"This was pretty disappointing food for how much it cost. I stopped for take out for two people for dinner and it was over $30. How the hell did that happen. I'm still wondering. The gyro meat was dry and the chicken was as well. The only good thing was....uhh can't think of anything."}
{"text":"Love coming to Sultan's... They always remember your order.  It's a great place to get good food. Quick in and out. Service is sideways great. Usually see a lot of regulars when I stop in for pickup or carry-out."}
{"text":"This is my first visit to Sultans Grill and it was amazing.  Steve the owner is a really nice guy who runs an amazing business.  I ordered the chicken strips, something my daughter and I really wanted and let me tell you; first off they are made fresh to order and when they came to the table i was shocked.  This was a real chicken (not processed, not bought from a supply place, but a real chicken breaded and sliced into strips and cooked to perfection.  I have never had chicken strips prepared from scratch in any place.  So how were they, AMAZING....this place is located in a small indoor food court across from the court house and if you ever get the chance to head down to Lewis and 2nd street, you need to visit this place.  They have an great looking menu and from people who have been here many times, this is one of the last places you would expect to find food of this caliber, but I am here to tell you what, this is the first place I will go when I am looking for a good meal during the week.  Most people will say downtown???  It takes nothing to get downtown and this place is worth the trip.  I will be back often as the menu has a great selection of items I am wanting to try.  I added a picture of the chicken and fries so you can see the amazing chicken strips."}
{"text":"Can you say AWESOME....  This place gets really crowded at lunch time but I have to say being here on this day, even with a lunch crowd, the line sometimes being almost out the door, everyone behind the counter had great attitudes, they were able to work hard and find time to be friendly.    Its amazing the quality of service here that everyone seemed very calm and worked through each order even though the line never seemed to end.  You can tell they really enjoy their job and they take a LOT of pride in the products they put out.  I met my daughter for lunch, the had a chicken lemon soup which was extremely tasty and left me wanting more when I was done.  I also had a Gyro which was really good.  They have an amazing menu with a great selection and even though this is my first review, I have been here a few times and really like not only the food here but the friendliness of the staff.  They are glad to see you and they put that love into the food the deliver.  If you are in the area, this is a place you have to try...ITS A MUST...  I highly recommend this place and I will definitely be back...I find it pretty easy to get to, there is a parking garage with valet parking right next to the place.  It is downtown so you know parking is limited and you most likely have to pay to park being the area but don't let that deter you, this place is worth coming to."}
{"text":"Located in a more high end strip mall in the nicer part of Summerlin, this place is about as ethnic as McDonalds. Eh... Not impressed with the dry and tasteless Falafel sandwich. In fact, thinking back makes me feel nauseous. The flavor was shiver inducing.   Price was $4.99. Waited 15 minutes for the to go order.   Unfortunately Sultan's Grill is run by caucasians who have managed to take the ethnic taste out of the food, flavorless and dry.   Not to mention the employees that served me were a couple high school kids who took their sweet time chatting while putting together the falafel.   Will not be back."}
{"text":"Great for to go/takeout, cute, small dine-in area, really good quality food... Great Gyro and Kebob... Will repeat often"}
{"text":"Today was my first visit to the place and I will definitely be back. Food was excellent and the staff was very pleasant!  Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"The food was so so I would say...they do go heavy on the spices though...they took forever to being my food out...the taziki was really sour an the falafels were dry...only thing I really liked on the plate was the rice...the kids plate came with barely any fries an 2 pieces of chicken strips...not sure if this is a return place for me..."}
{"text":"This place is so delicious. They are spot on with the way they cook their food. The chef and the staff are friendly. This is by the far the best Mediterranean Food I have tasted. Thank you to the cops who told us about this place. YUMMY"}
{"text":"The beef shawarma was decent, but unremarkable. The gyro wasn't good and the tzatziki was bland and thick.The fries were reasonable, but that's not much of a feat.  I really dig the baba ganoush though. Chunky mild eggplant, well seasoned. Was worth the 2nd trip to have again, even if nothing else was. Would have been 2 stars otherwise."}
{"text":"Chicken Schwarma anything. Always good food. Great folks.  Still putting out quality unlike a lot of places these days."}
{"text":"Seriously the spicy falafel sandwich is amazing. Seriously. Sweet Jesus. And for some reason yelp requires reviews to be long instead of succinct like mine. So I'm just filling space at the moment because I don't really think that anything more needs to be said. Seriously."}
{"text":"I work in the area and have come here a couple of times. I have always gotten the gyro sometimes with fries. The food is always great. The fries took a little longer one time I went but I wasn't in a hurry so no biggie. I kinda didn't like the one employee eating behind the front counter. Maybe duck around a corner to do that. But they are only cashiers not cooks so not gonna freak out about it. But the food is good. That being said... I've only gotten the gyro and fries as a lunch break or after work quick dinner. But based on what i ate it was delicious."}
{"text":"I love Sultan's Grill!!! I've been eating here for 10 years, everything tastes amazing and authentic!!! Very personable service, Marie is so amazing she knows your name, your order, what dressing you like,...all of it!!! Once you get Chicken Shwarma you'll be coming back forever!!!"}
{"text":"Upon entering there was a slight sewer or grease trap odor!  No one else was inside dining.  Since I was determined to try the shwarma I placed a to go order.  The service was friendly and the order prepared quickly enough.  I went outside in order to eat and get away from the odor inside the restaurant.  The food was really good.  Overall, I'd say the food is a little pricey but tasty.  Hoping they fix the problem and eliminate that odor inside the restaurant.  ugh!"}
{"text":"I was rushing to work and starving, thinking of an overly expensive and disappointing fast food joint when I spotted this establishment. For the same price of a large \"value\" meal I had an excellent gyro and 1/2 order of baba ganouch, flavorful and filling. Instead of prepackaged not-unlike-food from McD's I got fresh fast food from a local establishment that was savory and delicious. Knocked off a star because, although the menu states that they greet everyone with a smile, the woman behind the counter must have been in a bad place, because she was somewhat sullen and distracted. I opted not to tip (which I always do) because of the service, but the food was great."}
{"text":"We decided to grab something in the vicinity of where we were shopping (Scraps 4 Pets) and noticed this little homey spot.   The place is pretty basic, but a plus is there is some outside seating. Today was quite nice so outdoors we went.   From the look of the menu, this \"Meditteranean\" place seems to be a mix....I noticed Lebanese dishes, some Greek.  I grabbed a Shish Kafta plate which comes with rice, salad, flatbread and a bit of pickled cabbage and turnip. Pretty decent lunch deal for I believe $6.95. Shish Kafta are ground up  lamb or beef made into a long hot dog shaped patty. It was pretty decent, juicy and good with the tzatiki it came with. Rice was flavorful with saffron butter in it. I also got a side of falafel ($1.29 for 3)....it was okay. They were pretty small and small makes for crunchy, but then it loses some of it's moisture in the middle so I just dipped it heavily in the tahini sauce it comes with.   The BF got a falafel plate and that was also around $6.95. He added a side of baba ganoush (99cents) which was okay. It was more whipped instead of the usual chunky and definitely has a lot of tahini in it.  We also both got a baklava for dessert (99 cents). It's a small cut, but good. It's a lot spicier of a baklava so it's not the usual mellow honey kind. The BF like that it was very light and flaky and cites that is the ideal baklava texture for him.   2 plates, 2 extras, 2 drinks, and 2 baklavas- $22 and some change.  Good deal considering it was a decent portion of food and was pretty good. ( Aww look. I remembered to keep up on prices to be more helpful of a reviewer. ...and included pics).    Their shawarmas looks good....they were slicing what looked like chicken shawarma and it looked really juicy. It's now on my list to come back to try. We're in the area fairly often so we'll probably drop in again sometime."}
{"text":"This place is not authentic. The \"pita\" bread is actually Flatbread and very hard to chew. The  baklava is a single layer and true baklava should consist of multi-layers. It is also about a 2 inch square piece on top of being as thick as a quarter. The \"lamb\" they use for the gyro is the pre-fabricated cone which is mostly cereal. I could go on and on but would rather spend the money at an actual greek or Mediterranean restaurant  instead of this fast-food imposter."}
{"text":"Wow is an understatement. Greatest Mediterranean food in Las Vegas hands down. Got chicken breast on the spinners and a masterful flavor. The salad was off the hook. I would give a hundred stars if I could. Customer service was remarkable and will definitely make this my go to restaurant."}
{"text":"Seriousley the worst Gyro I have had in my entire life. I've had better Gyros from kits at the grocery store. I walk in see the meat on a spit and think cool, this should be pretty good, at least it wasn't that pre-sliced gyro meat you just slap on a griddle and serve. But I was wrong. The pre-sliced stuff I get at my local dive diner is better than the Sultans. As mentioned before, not on a pita, you get flatbread. And the tzatziki sauce, sour cream based (fail), and full of bland. No zip, no tang, no kidding I say dang! And what's up with having the cheezy radio station playing through the stereo AND having the TV on with the sound on? I'm A.D.D. and that blew even MY mind. Lastly, I dropped a dollar in the voluntary tip jar, spreading the good Karma love, not a boo, not a thank you for the tip, not a thank you when handed my change. Maybe the other dishes are more on par, I'll never know. I rarely throw down such bad reviews. I'm giving this place 2 stars and almost feel as if I'm complementing them with that.  I am now the Sultan of swing somewhere else."}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic. We eat here often and I have my favorite which is Chicken Shawarma. The service is great and the food is always on point."}
{"text":"After stopping by the Nevada Ballet Theater, I decided to pop over here for some lunch. I am on unending quest for falafel, and I had not sampled this fare.   I was ecstatic to find a Vegetarian Combo plate, as this is hands down my favorite thing to order at a Mediterranean-esque place, and I have yet to find a reasonably priced, tasty option in Vegas.   The place is very casual. You order at the counter, and I would say the service was very NY. They weren't overly friendly, but she did call me \"hun\" at some point.   The plate came with a little green salad, some pickled cabbage, hummus, baba ganoush, pita, grape leaves and falafel. Looking around, it appeared that most people were ordering salads, and the lettuce was a fresh, green Romaine. Perfect for a lunch salad. The hummus was good, and I actually thought I had two helpings of hummus because the baba ganoush is blended to a hummus consistency! I prefer a chunkier baba, but the flavor was still good. The falafel flavor was ok, however, they were small, oblong and a little dense. My ideal falafel is round and a little fluffy. As for the pita, I am not sure if this is just on the vegetarian plate, but it was covered in a thick coating of spices and seeds. The predominant flavor was oregano. The pita was thin, so the spice to bread ratio was lopsided in favor of the spice. I definitely prefer a spice-free pita, so next time I would definitely request that.   The do have shawarma on a spit twirling around in the kitchen, which is nice to see. They also have Gold Peak tea! I am a fan of the unsweetened black mixed with the sweetened green. Overall, a solid option for a quick, fresh lunch if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I enjoy the food here but I find it rather odd that they charge for hot sauce when you order a full meal.  I understand they make it fresh but it's only available for sale?"}
{"text":"Great food and service.  The gyro sandwich is fabulous!!!  Working nearby so this a great change from burgers and Starbucks."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for lunch almost every day. their food is always delicious, the owner and staff are always friendly and accommodating, their portions are huge and the meals are very reasonably priced especially for the downtown area. I would also recommend their food to cater an event as well.  Don't skip this place if you're downtown as they're the best you'll get."}
{"text":"The food is eh. I ordered a cucumber salad, chicken shawarma pita and chicken kabob. The flavor was a 5/10. The chicken in both was extremely dry! The pita was dry and crispy. I wasn't a fan of any of it. I won't be back!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best small business Mediterranean food in Las Vegas.  Family operated. Amazing Customer Service. They know me by name, I come in at least once a week to get lunch for my boss and myself.   SPINACH PIE!  Let me say that again, SPINACH PIE!  They make it three times a week, Monday Wednesday and Friday. It is, oh my goodness, the best. If you miss it on the day it's made, cross your fingers for left overs, it typically sells out.   The hummus, is amazing too. I typically get the hummus trio, it's got a little of everything that I want. The pickled beets, mmmm! The green hummus is a mix of scallions and parsley and it's become my favorite fast!   The Vegetarian platter is a delicious mix of everything a vegetarian would want. Delicious hummus, stuffed grape leaves and falafel. So good.   I also recommend the falafel sandwich, the flavors blend together so well and it hardly feels like you're missing meat. The sandwich fills me up for sure!   This place is a must try!!"}
{"text":"Has the Gyro and the stuffed grape leaves. The gyro meat was dry. The sandwich is made with flatbread and wrapped rather than with a pita. The sandwich was almost tasteless.   The stuffed grape leaves were old. They were sour. I told the manager and he said that they we fine. I only ate one and threw the rest out.   I am not sure based on this visit why they are still open.   I will not be back"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time with this location downtown. I'm a big fan of Sultans Grill in summerlin and Henderson. This location is terrible. Hummus tasted liked chickpeas and tahini. That's it. It's like they forgot to put in the cumin, lemon and salt. Couldn't take more than 2 bites. It was disgusting. Ordered a peasant salad with gyro meat. First, they put the entire salad in a small 5 x 5 container, didn't add the dressing nor was it in my bag. That would be tolerable if it wasn't for the OLD, dried up gyro meat they added in top. It was all the ends that had been sitting there all day. Couldn't eat it.   Basically don't waste your time or money here"}
{"text":"Noooooo! They changed their recipes! The baba ganoush had hardly any garlic. I could barely distinguish it from the hummus. The hummus tasted like it was doctored up from a can.  Or maybe I've gotten the two mixed up...  And the pita bread- it was so loaded with herbs the bread couldn't be seen-  and the flavor did not compliment the hummus and baba ganoush. I'm so sad. I won't be getting those items from here any more.   They still did a great job on the fatoush (salad) and the taboule seemed fine.    But I'm so sad.  Why change a good thing?"}
{"text":"I miss living by this place :( swear I was here once a week. The food is so fresh and yummy! Chicken sharwarma is basically my staple order. You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"This is my second time dining at Sultan's.  Cleanliness: 5 Stars The place is definitely cleaned regularly, tables, chairs and floor are all in great order. The coke machine and fresh brewed tea machine are clean, not the usual nastiness from most mom/pop shops.. This family cares about quality and appearance.  Food: 4 stars This is certainly not the best euro I have had, but at least the ingredients are fresh and made to order. Everything came out as ordered and hot.  Hospitality: 5 stars Very friendly staff, each greeted me with a smile. My order was read back to ensure quality and my order was actually walked out to my table.. Very nice touch for a quick bite type of Restaurant"}
{"text":"went there last night and was disappointed in the service and the food. Dressing for my salad (oil and vinegar) had too much vinegar. My wife's chicken was under cooked and over salted. They are so slow to cook the food. Place good be so much better..."}
{"text":"I ordered a Chicken Gyro. The chicken was flavorless and extremely dry. The bread was a dry tortilla and not a fresh pita. Won't be back at all. I don't know how they stay opened."}
{"text":"I'm foreign! English. So as an English youth I spent almost every summer on one Greek island or another. Consequently I loooove Greek food, especially the not-so adventurous gyro. I regularly get the gyros from this place and they are pretty good. I get upset when they charge me 50c for hot sauce . People sit down and eat in here , it's very basic and zero ambiance so I take out. Lamb chops are good , they give you a side salad with most dishes but it's just a couple of lettuce leaves and a tomato. Hey but it's close to the house."}
{"text":"I truly hate to give a bad review to a neighborhood place that I've been to many times before.  But tonight's dinner was unbearable.  We usually order kebab - chicken for my husband, and kafta or chicken for me.  But tonight we decided to shake things up, and the coupon did us in.  There was one from one of the mailers offering two dinners for $14.95.  Kebabs wasn't one of the choices, but Chicken Shawarma was.  How different could it be from Chicken Kebab, which we've always liked???  Step 1:  Call to order for take-out.  Kid on the other end: \"I'm not sure we have enough rice left for two dinners.\"  It's 8:15; they close, I think, at 10.  Puts me on hold for quite a while.  Finally:  \"Yes, we do.\"  So I order them, with one vinaigrette and one creamy for the salad dressings.  Five minutes and it'll be ready.  No prob, we live close by.  Hubby's sick, so I pick up the food.  Back home, I open my container to see the usual yellow rice, pickled cabbage and turnips, chopped raw red onion, the usual hard, dried-out pita, and a whole mess of dried and shriveled chicken pieces.  I taste one of them;  first I choked on the dryness, then my mouth shriveled from the salt - so much of it that two pieces and my lips were stinging as if I were doing a dead man's float in the Dead Sea.  It was completely inedible.  It was when I noticed that the salads - fresh romaine, two slices of cuke, and one lonely grape tomato - came with not one, but two vinaigrettes.  No creamy for me.  I was then completely pissed and called the restaurant.  Got the same kid who'd taken my order, and asked to speak with the manager.  I was put on hold twice - the second time for a verrrryyyy long time.  How big is this tiny place that he can't find the manager??  Finally the clerk gets back on to tell me that the manager isn't there, and he doesn't have the authority to issue any refunds.  But the manager will call me later this evening, if not, then tomorrow.  He didn't call tonight, so I'm waiting until late tomorrow afternoon to post this review.  I suspect that I will have waited for nothing.  Well, I was right to wait.  I never heard from Sultan's Grill.  I had planned to give this meal two stars, because I do like the chopped veggies and the salad (when I have the dressing I ordered).  But I believe that a food business shouldn't be in the business of selling inedible food, and if they do, they have a duty to respond to complaints.  I'm not even asking for a free meal, just an acknowledgment that they dropped the ball.  A business that does not do this doesn't deserve any stars, so I've revised my rating downward."}
{"text":"This is not fine dining - it is a walk up counter to order a quick lunch when you are downtown by the RJC courthouse - so I am giving it 4 stars in that context. However I prefer it to most other quick food downtown, and eat here ever other week. I recommend the Spinach Pie when it is the special, otherwise the Gyro, shwarma or Greek Salad. Lunch specials are often $8-9 including a drink, great prices for downtown."}
{"text":"Another disappointing food court find. I didn't have high expectations but I didn't feel like walking too far in the heat, I settled on Sultan's Grill.   I ordered the gyro wrap combo with rice and that also comes with a drink. It was an enormous portion and I was full after only half of my wrap. The rice was sad and overcooked, the gyro was ok but overloaded with raw white onions and tomatoes. The meat was more cubed than sliced and didn't have any char on the sides. What they called tzatziki sauce was essentially overly chilled sour cream.  The service was standard. They do get really busy at lunch time and just before my turn to order the cashier took two phone orders while I waited. Luckily the cook came up to take my order so they could get it fired up while I waited to order at the cashier, which I appreciated.   Overall, it's there and it's edible. That's really all I can say."}
{"text":"Came for lunch and chose the gyro dinner platter and kbob platter.  Both came with salad and rice. Cooked to order and very tasty.  For a done in the wait time was for fine. But if you have a short lunch - order ahead and give them 10-15min before you pickup or dine in"}
{"text":"If I would have reviewed this place after my first visit, I would have given it 4 stars. It was on a Saturday after a library visit, and the service was fantastic.  I had both kiddos in tow and we were 1 of 3 parties in the restaurant.  The woman taking our order was so attentive and making recommendations.  She was truly following the #1 rule of their \"House Rules\" listed on the back of their menus: Service with a Smile.    The food itself is good, not great- but when I am craving that taste of the Mediterranean, it hits the spot. I ordered the Gyro Sandwich and the green hummus and enjoyed every bite.  The price was very reasonable, and another plus is the fact that it is very close drive and in the vicinity of many places I visit regularly.    On my second visit (for lunch during the workweek), the place was packed with everyone on their lunch breaks, and the service (different cashier) took a 180. There was absolutely no service with a smile while I I placed my order of a Chicken Schwarma and a half order of Baba Ganoush \"to go\" and waited about 15 minutes.  I didn't mind because I came during the peak time and had my iPhone to keep me company.  Well, my head was down and I was shocked when my bag of food was just shoved under my face.  No \"excuse me\", no \"your food is ready\", no verbal communication whatsoever.  And I was definitely very aware of my surroundings, anticipating my food.  Unfortunately, she turned around before she could se the look of complete disgust on my face. Well, I don't know if the rude service ruined my meal because the chicken schwarma was completely dry.  At least the Baba Ganoush was good.    I defintely won't return during the lunch rush ever again, but if I am craving a gyro on the weekend, then I may just visit again."}
