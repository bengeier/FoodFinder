{"text":"Very poor quality of food inspite of higher prices. Not authentic Indian at all. Could even had proper Chloe chana which is the easiest to make. Don't waste your money on this if u r looking for an Indian food . Disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"What an extraordinary Indian restaurant!!!!!!!!!! My business partner and I were in the area and looking for a place to eat......seen this place next to Tim's.  We were pleasantly surprised at the quality of food, service and cleanliness of this restaurant.   Comparing it to others this is by far the best.  Will definitely be going back.  Try this place once and you will understand why?   Sonia"}
{"text":"Worst restaurant ever! I have never posted a review but felt obligated after reading the other misguiding reviews(which tbh do not look authentic based on my visit). Went here with my boyfriend, his parents, his brother and his brothers wife, not too big a group. They had no table settings, no water, no utensils at any table upon our arrival. The only way we got water was by ordering small bottles of water for each of us. Only after we were seated did the waitress come running out with handfulls of forks and napkins. They are very over priced and the quality of the food is severely lacking!! They are just looking to make money while cutting EVERY corner, and would charge you for using their oxygen if they could I'm sure."}
{"text":"This was our first time coming to this restaurant. While we ordered takeout, the hostess/waitress midway did not complete our order. As another gentleman walked up behind us, she completely ignored us and started helping the other customer. After the other customer was seated to a table (also ordering takeout), I had to ask how long our food will be (10 min.). After we waited in the lobby area (there are no benches for people to wait  if ordering takeout or waiting for a table), the hostess finally came to tell us that we could have a seat in the dining area. Not a good first impression, as the person who ordered after us was treated as VIP. Staff requires better training in helping at the front desk. Also, the restaurant has ample seating and only two tables were occupied, so not sure why the hostess rushed to the other customer. Food took much longer than 10 min."}
{"text":"I Came across this place randomly. I was looking to eat lunch  in this plaza. Great Indian joint very clean and stylish with a decent size buffet and good service /atmosphere. Prices are good too on all you can eat.   What makes me sad is that people who would pick burger king over this place !   Why not 5 star ? Cause I'm not Indian and I don't know what's missing to make it a 5 star  Will I come back? Heck ya"}
{"text":"I went there for dinner yesterday. It was amazing. I usually criticize the food whenever going to Indian restaurants, I had nothing bad to say about this place. We ordered the lamb curry and the chicken tikka masala. Both were delicious. I recommend getting the garlic nan, it was the best nan I've ever had!"}
