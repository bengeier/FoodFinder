{"text":"My husband and I went with friends, based on their recommendation. I think we were the only ones there (on a Friday night) - not sure if that was a sign or not. The service was so-so; a little awkward and rushed, although again we were the only ones in the restaurant. The food was OK; we ordered their won ton soup, singapore noodles, hot plate beef, stir fried gai lan. The price was right, and the food was decent. I took photos of each dish...but never included a review on my blog. It was \"meh\". 

I could be persuaded to return, to try their dim sum. But otherwise, I would only return for dinner if there weren't any other options and we were in the area and needed to have asian food. Too bad as I wanted to like it..."}
{"text":"First time here. Atmosphere was quaint. Food was decent but not remarkable bordering on the expensive side. Service was friendly but a bit rushed. 

Highlights were the spring rolls and the green beans in garlic."}
{"text":"Went here for Dim Sum on Sunday. Nice place, small but cozy. I was very impressed with the entire lunch experience. Service was excellent, friendly and fast. The food was amazing and fresh. Portion sizes are bigger than I am used to at Dim Sum so we over-ordered. 

Particular favourites was the Taro Cake, the Squid tenacles and the superb Har Gow. 

Highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I've eaten more dim sum than I care to admit, both in Toronto and Hong Kong. Over the past decade I've been a regular at Rol San and E-Pan on Spadina and have tried pretty much every place in Toronto. I was shocked when a recommendation from a friend turned out the be true: Bamboo on the Danforth makes some tasty dim sum!

Served all day, and on a patio too, the super friendly staff at Bamboo make it a Chinese oasis in the middle of Greektown. Their dim sum menu is a bit confusing, prices are higher than what you may be used to but portions are also larger. Each dish is made fresh in the kitchen and we were completely baffled at the quality of the ingredients and taste. Every dish we had was tastey, not greasy, and we left satisfied. Not even a trace of the typical \"dim sum vertigo\". Shumai is served with a full scallop on top of each. Everything was melt in your mouth, even the squid.

I've included photo evidence."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal..a little cozy place with lots of little decorations to look at.  The service was great and the food was incredible. We had the General Tso's chicken, beef with black bean sauce, shrimp dumplings and seafood nest.  The seafood was cooked nicely but the flavour was a bit mild for my taste.  The beef and chicken were my favourite.  Amazing food!"}
{"text":"Sizzling plate : beef tenderloin ... Shrimp fried Rice Great food.  Cute intimate place"}
{"text":"we love this little place, large portions of delicious food, well-priced.  the only thing we'd improve is the spring rolls, quite terrible."}
{"text":"The food here is neither wonderful nor horrible. The price is definitely pricier than having dim sum in Chinatown. The food doesn't taste like higher quality dim sum than other restaurants. One downfall of this restaurant is that they don't have everything on their menu and not all the prices are updated. However, the staff was nice and the food was decent so I gave them 4 stars."}
