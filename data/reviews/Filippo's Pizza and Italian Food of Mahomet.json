{"text":"First time there, and doubt I'll go back. Was looking for reasonably priced place for dinner with my sons that had some vegetarian options, and Italian places are usually good for that. My son and I asked our server what kind of veggie choices there were, and he suggested getting pasta with Alfredo sauce. The pasta dish he recommended was a good value, so we went with that. He suggested getting saut√©ed mushrooms along with. Yum! Okay. My other sons got pizza.

The food was fine, if unremarkable, and I did enjoy the mushroom addition. Pizza was okay, according to my kids, but nothing special. Service was also good.

That's not the issue.

The problem was that when I went to pay, it was substantially more than I expected. We had an appointment to make, and they were busy, so I paid the bill and left. I tried to do the math in my head, but it didn't add up, so I went back a while later to discuss the discrepancy. 

When I returned, I asked the woman behind the register to explain why it was so much more. She informed me that the sauce and the 'shrooms were both upcharges, so that was the difference. However, the server NEVER mentioned this. The mushroom upcharge was on the menu in small print, but not the Alfredo. Regardless, if the server suggests it, he/she should mention the fee, not just assume that I've thoroughly looked over the menu.

Although the cashier explained things fully and politely, she never offered any compensation, not even a discount for a future visit; she just said that she would make sure the Alfredo upcharge made it onto the menu. I was certainly NOT a happy customer, and will probably not go back. 

Which is a shame, as I really wanted to like this place. I always prefer to go to family-owned places, and this place is a fixture. Without the deceptive pricing, I would have certainly returned."}
{"text":"We have lived in the area for many years. Some people swear this is the best pizza ever. I just don't get it? In 10 years living here we have tried to give this place a chance several times (especially when we get tired of the other pizza in town and want something different). Each time try it, we regret it. The pizza is very sweet. Way too sweet to taste like pizza. Our kids will eat a bite or two then say they are full (the same kids that will eat slice after slice of any other pizza). The people working there tend to be a bit rude. As if they are doing me a favor by letting me order from them."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza!  I'm pretty sure they grind their own sausage here and it is simply delicious.   Crust is not a deep pan or a thin and crispy, but right in the middle.   The sauce is sweet and the cheese is of very good quality.  This pizza reminds me of the mom and pop shops I would frequent in Chicagoland.  Highly recommend!!!  
Allow plenty of time for carry out or delivery on weekends as it can take over an hour."}
{"text":"The Hawaiian pizza is soooo good. The wait is always worth it. It's real pieces of ham- not processed cubes of \"meat\". Add that to their fantastic crust and sauce and you're in pizza heaven."}
{"text":"Wow, I can't believe I'm the first to review! I've been eating Filippo's Pizza and Italian Food for probably 13 years. I love their pizza, the sauce is amazing, and you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. I personally recommend their spaghetti with meatballs, or cheese or meat ravioli, as well as their pizza (I still go for cheese pizza). The staff are extremely personable and friendly- go there!"}
{"text":"Nope. 

I'm not sure how this place is a town favorite... But probably because it's a small town and there aren't a lot of places to eat. 

This is a frozen food restaurant with an odd sweet sauced side show pizza. 

We had a meat lovers and a cheese pizza... But we didn't even bother taking the leftover home. Yuck. Soggy and the only flavor was the overly sweet sauce. 

The table was dirty and so were the glasses. Our server was rude, seemed annoyed we were there... Uh ... 
And then we waited a long time for being one of three tables there. Uh... What? 

For a hometown restaurant this could be so good... But the service and the food needs help. Rework the menu and hopefully it will be worth trying again."}
{"text":"Our family loves Filippo's pizza, and we like the family that owns and runs it too (very friendly).   We often crave this pizza;  I am not sure if the sauce is better, or if the cheese is better.  I grew up going to the original Filippo's Pizza in Monticello, and this pizza is the same.   They also have traditional Italian dishes, sandwiches, bread sticks, etc.  

Note that they don't take credit cards, and don't have fountain drinks, but you can get bottles of soft drinks there.

The dining room is small and fills up quickly on weekend nights."}
{"text":"We visited friends in Champaign to attend a U of I game and they brought us to Filippo's for dinner.  This tiny pizza parlor was packed with people on a busy Friday night but we did snag a spot for six.  We are able to bring our own bear/wine (big score) and ordered salads and pizza.  

The salads, consisted of lettuce, tomato and shredded cheese, were fresh and crisp but they were served with packets of dressing (more appropriate for carry-out not dine-in) so that was awkward and somewhat irritating since we didn't have enough and had to ask for more a few times.  

The pizza was really good - crispy crust, a slightly sweet sauce and good toppings.  We ordered Sausage on one and veggie on the other.  The service was not notable, aside from having to get his attention a few times for dressing and napkins, he was quick to take our order and our food was served promptly and piping hot.  

I don't have anything to compare Filippo's to since we aren't from the area but we know good pizza and I would guess this is one of the best places for pizza in this area."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! I had to chuckle at the review about their being closed for vacation. We all HATE when they go on vacation! There's nothing worse than craving a Filippo's pizza and finding out you can't have one. Considering this family-run restaurant is open six days a week year-round, though, we have decided it's ok for them to take a vacation. It makes it all the sweeter when they return. I personally recommend the veal parmesan and the pizza. I really have a rough time choosing sometimes. Also, they're one of the few places that deliver in Mahomet, and having a Filippo's pizza show up at your door is always a treat. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"After waiting 2 hours for the delivery of our pizza, baked mostaccioli and chicken parmesan I can't tell you how disappointed the three of us were. The sauce on all three dishes was sweet and just not good. The chicken was over cooked. There was nothing Italian about any of these dishes. My advice is to order a pizza from Casey's. You'll have it in less than an hour and it is by far a much better pizza. This town is lacking a good, authentic Italian restaurant.  It's rather disheartening that the best pizza I can find is at a gas station."}
{"text":"Never been a fan but decided to give it another go tonight for dinner. Combined we got tortellini, fiery fingers, breadsticks, and a salad. Everything was great except for the breadsticks. They.were.horrible. They were like mini loaves of bread...didn't even seem as if they were cooked to the texture breadsticks are supposed to be. I asked for an exchange for garlic bread...the waiter said they didn't charge me for the breadsticks but I believe they did anyways but the price of the bill. All in all, better experience than I have had before and I will be back. My fiance loves the place so much so he's happy I enjoy it :)"}
{"text":"There are a lot of reviews here mentioning the sweetish sauce.  It is true.  Filippo's serves a St. Louis style pizza.  If you are looking for a Chicago style, sausage-infused, deep-dish pizza, or a thin crust, New York style pizza, go elsewhere. But if you are looking for a quintessential St. Louis style pizza experience, look no further.

St. Louis style pizza is defined by it cracker-like crust, its unique cheeses embodied with a somewhat smoky flavor, and a sauce that has a sweetness almost certainly influenced by the Sicilian immigrants settling in St. Louis and bringing their Italian flavors to the new land.

Embrace the sweetness.  It's a uniquely flavored pizza that is served up with hometown pride in this fine local establishment.  

Beware, however, Filippo's is small and pick-up, delivery and seating times can be astronomical during peak times."}
{"text":"Filippo's is, without a doubt, THE best pizza in all of Champaign-Urbana. It is run by a family that relocated from Sicily and uses authentic Italian recipes. My personal favorite is the Spicy Chicken Pizza. Beyond the delicious food, I enjoy supporting a small business run by a local family. Filippo's is a MUST try if you're in the Chambana area; it's definitely worth the drive if you aren't in Mahomet."}
{"text":"I have no clue why people like this place. Their pizza sauce is terrible. Too sweet. Their other food is bad as well. Especially the Italian beef. It's gritty and dry. The cheese on our garlic bread was barely melted. The service isn't exactly friendly either. And they still don't take cards. Really? It's 2016."}
{"text":"Hands down, best veggie pizza I've had to date. I must say, it's important that you like olives (they use a lot), if you want to enjoy the veg pizza. 

Their sauce is amazing. I sometimes ask for extra. I hate when places skimp on pizza sauce; they do not. It has a hint of sweetness which I love.

I've also tried the mushroom & sausage pizza and the spaghetti. Both were delicious. I don't think you can go wrong with anything on their menu to be honest. 

I wish they were open on Mondays. The wait for delivery can also be a tad long (averaging around an 1 to an hour and a half). But it's worth the wait ok."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!!

Filippo's has the best Lasagna I have EVER had!  I can't find better anywhere, and I have been looking.  I try to visit every time I come down from Chicago to visit my family.  

The pizza is great too.  Really everything I have tried has been amazing.  I have, and will recommend this to everyone heading to the area!"}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza I've ever had.

As many do, they slightly sweeten the pasta tomato sauce. I think it's fine, but my wife prefers hers without sugar. Since we both agree that the pizza is the best, this is not an issue!

Not a large dining room, maybe a dozen tables."}
{"text":"Food: 
- Salad was reasonably fresh. 
- Drink sizes were large.
- No beer/wine on the menu.  
- Garlic bread was decent. 
- We had spaghetti and lasagna. We've had fresh pasta before, and couldn't really tell a difference here. Also the style of the sauce is very, very sweet/sugary. Generally I'm not a fan of that style of sauce, but they seemed to have a lot of patrons there that loved it and were getting food to go after eating their meals. Portion size was more than reasonable - good value for the price. 
- Didn't try the pizza. It looked good!

Service:
- Slow service. Even if there are only 5-6 other tables full, assume your meal will take 30+ minutes to come out.  
- All dishes come out smothered in sauce, which appears to make it tough on servers to know which dish is which. For example, our food came out, there was confusion by the server about which dish was which and they had to run back to the kitchen. 
- Separately, a different server presented food to another table, thought it was ours, picked it up and presented it to us, and then returned it to the first table. I understand confusion can occur, but don't run food between tables - it is unappetizing. If you're mixed up, go back to the kitchen before coming out again. 
- We came later in the evening after the main dinner rush and were seated promptly. When a large group got up to leave, the server cleared the table and wiped it down. Then, while we were eating, he insisted we stop, stand and reconfigure our table, so he could add another table back to our table to get the floor's layout how he desired it. It was bad service to have guests stop eating, have to place their arms on a wet table and further more - it was late in the evening and we didn't even see any more patrons arrive to eat dinner. Could it have been that bad to let us eat our meal, and then set up the dining room for the next day? 

Ambiance:
- Small, Italian restaurant. 
- Appreciate that they're family-owned. Lots of articles and photos to show off their local roots. 
- Nice and cozy during the winter time. Generous with the room heat level, which is appreciated as many restaurants can be drafty this time of year."}
{"text":"It is definitely an acquired taste pizza wise as they use a sweet sauce. The best thing I've found here is hands down the meatball sandwhich! Get it on garlic cheese bread with some jalape√±os and their alfredo sauce on the side! Bridgey is great and the staff feels like family after coming there for years."}
{"text":"This family-owned and family-run small Italian restaurant is a best-kept secret in a small town outside of Champaign-Urbana. While many people in the area say Papa Del's is the best pizza, I would vote Filippo's as my favorite. But pizza is only one of the great menu choices. Their lasagna is indescribably delicious! Bridgie and Jerry Paris are the owners (Bridgie's parents run the Filippo's in Monticello). Their son (named Filippo Paris) is the third generation of an extremely successful small business in a small town. They don't sell alcohol, but you can bring in whatever you want to drink with your meal. We are frequent patrons, and never tire of this great place."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for years. This isn't fancy Italian food but good, honest, comfort, family Italian. We love their pizzas. They are different than typical pizza - crust is thin but not super thin. Sauce is just slightly sweet. Their dinners are solid as well and portions are generous. It is amazing what they turn out in their tiny kitchen. Order early on weekends or it could take an hour or more. We usually do take out but service is good when we do eat in. Best place to eat in Mahomet in our opinion. Buon apetito!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza! Our favorite is the x-large special with extra sauce. We LOVE their sauce as it has a sweet flavor to it. My parents drive an hour and a half to come eat this with us. Drinks are kinda expensive if you drink soda, sells by can or 2 liter. My daughter also likes their Italian Beef a lot. I love the fiery fingers, and we all love the salad. Friendly family atmosphere. The cherry dessert pizza is amazing"}
