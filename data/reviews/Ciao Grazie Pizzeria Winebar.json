{"text":"Nothing but goodness. Excellent pizza and fantastic service. Had appetizer, pizza and desert...all were just great. Love the atmosphere as well. Very clean. No crying babies either when I was there, FANTASTIC."}
{"text":"So I was out in the middle of nowhere with my son watching my daughter's cheer competition at Verrado High School.  We had a break and I hit the find restaurant nearby button on my iPhone - nothing came up.  There were a couple of high school kids in the parking lot that said there was a great pizza restaurant nearby and gave us directions.

My son and I split the small Caesar salad and the Americana pizza with fennel sausage added.  The Caesar salad was one of the best I have had in a longtime.  The pizza was definitely large enough to share considering we split the salad.  The pizza was awesome!

Well done Grazie!!!

We'll be back if and when we get to this side of town again from Chandler."}
{"text":"Friendly service. Pricy for the quality of food. Salad was bland and the manacotti could use more flavor as well."}
{"text":"Food was very good. Service very good. Had coupon for margarita pizza. Told us it was for childrens pizza .Had to pay the difference . I wondererd but OK . Ordered wine for $39.00 but they were out. Ok. Waitress recommended house wine various kinds for $27.00 decided on Sangiovese house wine for $27.00. Check came for Sangiovese wine for $63.00. Brought it to their attention and they corrected it. Not really convinced it was an honest mistake considering the explanation of pizza price and conversation about wine price. I hope I am wrong"}
{"text":"I have ate there twice, very overpriced and overrated in my opinion. Your location does not justify the prices"}
{"text":"I was met at the door by Jo, smiling face and happy to see me. Neighborhood atmosphere, she showed me to the bar where my friend was sitting and waiting for me. The wine was excellent and the atmosphere was very inviting and relaxing. The food was superb as usual and the service was very attentive.
Definitely my neighborhood hang out.

{"text":"New bar stools and bar tops are a great upgrade. Food and service is always first rate. Franco and the gang treat everyone fantastic. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"The restaurant has delicious food and amazing customer service. Their are very kid friendly too. So whether you are looking for a restaurant on a date night or one to take your family, this is the one. We love the location on Main Street :) if you want to have their food at the Blue Daisy Spa across the street, you can order it through you can have delicious lunch while at the Spa :)"}
{"text":"We had dinner here after my sons Christmas program. Freshest tasting pizza I've ever had! Very nice place. I'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"This small town feel and relaxed environment reminds me a lot of home. The surrounding areas and small village effect is just like Montecito, CA or possibly downtown Santa Barbara off of State St., Del La Guerra. This eatery is a gem! Being I have celiac disease I was concerned with cross contamination. I felt great and no issues. Our server an older middle aged man with an great genuine Italian accent took care of us. He was on point, gave us suggestions and made our experience one of a kind. With two preteen boys in toe after a lacrosse game they both had the Vezuvio and loved it. I had the Margherita pizza and added a dash of that amazing home made spicy Olive oil. It took my meal to another level. My boyfriend had their Nut Creek beer which is a must and I had the Italian Reisling, the Orvieto. All delicious and will be back for some more of the full experience of Verrado."}
{"text":"Had an unfortunate experience dining here tonight. As a resident in Verrado I have dined here various times but the past few times the food has been sub par. Tonight was different. I met my Mom and had my two Golden's whom I've dined with at Gratzi before. I tie them up on the outside of the restaurant fence and they sit quietly while we dine on the patio. When we sat down we sat near a table that had just left. A waitress came looked at us baffled and began cleaning the table without greeting us. We sat there longer than we should have, not being acknowledged while other guests on the patio where being taken care of and checked on. The manager comes out surprised that we have no menus. He was nice and gave my dogs water but did not apologize for how long we waited to be greeted which he seemed surprised with as well. The food was OK but overpriced due to the limited choices you have in Verrado. Seeing other tables near us get greeted and have friendly service was very upsetting. Not sure if the waitress was afraid of dogs or of serving people of color....either way I will no longer support this business who made my mother especially feel uncomfortable. Very disappointing as I love Verrado and Main Street."}
{"text":"These type of pizza places are our favorite.  We went on a Friday night at about 6:00.  We were greeted and seated immediately.  The restaurant is in Verrado and overlooks a park/splashpad.  A lot of trees, a lot of grass.  Nice to see in this area.  

Started with wine and beer.  Waitress (Amber) friendly and attentive.  Never had to wait for anything.

Had the bruschetta salsiccia to start.  The sausage was very good.  Only knock was the bread was very, very soft.  Didn't appear to be grilled/toasted at all.

We split a quattro stagioni pizza.  It had ham, salami, kalamata olives, and mushrooms and was perfect.

Bill was reasonable.  2 glasses of wine, 1 glass of beer, the app and the pizza all for $45 + tip.  Not bad at all."}
{"text":"Stopped by for dinner and was extremely disappointed. Our waitress was nice, but that was the only positive part of our experience. We ordered bruschetta as an appetizer $14 and half were burnt. I had the Americano pizza, very greasy and nothing special, plus the thin crust was partially burnt. My husband had the steak and mashed potatoes, both terrible and for $23 not worth it at all. You can definitely cook yourself a better steak at home. My kiddos wanted Mac and Cheese, usually a menu will tell you if it's Kraft, but it didn't and we paid $12 for two bowls of box macaroni and cheese. After the food, drinks and appetizer we were out $86.....such a waste. We will never go back, save yourself the money, this place needs a food intervention and it's NOT \"Very Verrado\""}
{"text":"What a wonderful place to spend an evening! The food is excellent! And I mean everything on the menu! Robert the bartender is terrific, and may I suggest his old fashion! And, Jo, is a treat to talk to as she takes your order and provide a really pleasant experience. Congrats to Franco, the owner for the best restaurant in The West Valley!"}
{"text":"Good little place in Verrado with a nice vib, everyone seemed to know one another and reminded me of the small town feeling that I missed. Dinner was good with options that were more elevated from the typical pepperoni. I feel like it is a nice mid week dinner option to get away and slow down from the daily grind. Wine selection was simple, not over bearing like some places that have hundreds to choose from. You can make a quick selection and enjoy. Only thing I would say is that it is a little tight inside. But then again you can meet people that way."}
{"text":"We have going here for over 4 years, never had anything but great food, great service so I am surprised at a few of the negative comments.  The pizzas are excellent, the lasagna is great."}
{"text":"Wanted to update that positive changes were made since my last review. I will definitely recommend to my friends."}
{"text":"Visiting Verrado for the first time. Had lunch at your restaurant and was totally surprised at the taste of the food. Will definitely return when in the area again. I would rate the service and food as 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Bought 2 pizza's to go. An American and a margherita with extra bazil. They were ok. Very expensive. $31 for 2 12' pizza's. As for the crust, very thin and crispy. Cooked nicely. The flavor just wasnt there. The basil didnt make the pie pop like it should. What I have to compair this to is Grimaldis and La Piazza Al Forno. Thats tough competition. Those two are the best of the best. My wife and I would might make it again for a date night, but not with the kids."}
{"text":"The new Summer Specials menu is a Must See. The Blood Orange Sorbet is nothing less than refreshing and spectacular, especially  in this heat!  Take one home to enjoy later."}
{"text":"This place has great pizza smiling faces really great drinks from the bartender Rob everything on the menu is fresh and made in house with a great atmosphere in Verrado it's a must visit"}
{"text":"Had a fresh green Salad  , fresh veggies and grilled chicken that tasted wonderful!
Hubby had pizza with pepperoni and they don't shy away from the pepperoni, we could tell by the taste it had to be imported ! The sauce was 
Flavorful and the cheese topping was to die for, definitely either hand made or imported. 
Have been to Italy and the crust on this pizza was much like
What we experienced there. In fact the whole pizza reminded us of Italy as the taste profile was much like what we had in Asolo, Italy. Perfection !

Our waiter was Robert... awesome service and so very personable,
Made sure we were pleased with our lunch. Thank you Robert!

Price was well worth it and we thought reasonable as their products are 
Certainly the best!"}
{"text":"Grazie and I met over the weekend for the first time. It's located in Verado, a uniquely planned community, 35 minutes west of Phoenix. My author friend, Paul Daffinrud and I, met here to update our friendship & review his new book: \"The Janitor Solved the Murder\". Their fresh Mozzarella & Tomato salad, combined with the Manicotti was superb, the canoli for dessert was freshly made, my Amber Ale was COLD, smooth and added the right touch. I'll be back..."}
{"text":"We are new to the area and decided to sit out and have dinner.  Going in with now idea what to expect this is a charming place.  We started out with the Prickly Pear Margarita and Brochette with apricot jam and goat cheese. Our pizza was just as good they even swapped out the Prosciutto for olives.  We finished with a coffee ice cream dessert.  The entire experience was amazing.   We definitely will go back totally amazing."}
{"text":"Visiting for a high school basketball game and found this little gem. Located in a beautiful little town square. Brick oven pizza with a nice ambience, and great service. Jo, our waitress, 
was friendly and helpful. They have a gluten free option with thin and crispy crust. Delicious!! If I am ever out this way again I will come back!"}
{"text":"Food is great as always.  Our waitress tonight was quite indifferent.  There were only a few patrons left at 9p, and we were wrapping up with our group of 7, talking at the table while a few of used the restroom.  As I'm standing there I see our waitress talking to the other waitress behind the glass wall and she's waving us along, wanting us to get out of there.  As we stood there for another 5 minutes or so, she was growing increasingly annoyed that we were taking too much time to leave the restaurant.  

This is a forgivable offense, we will be back for the awesome food.  But having just spent $150, I would appreciate the service being a little kinder and less annoyed with patrons.  It is not good practice to stand in plain view of customers and complain about them."}
{"text":"Out of 4 places to eat in Verrado this is my last selection, and it's not even close.  Only decent item I've ever had is the pizza, but it's drastically overpriced.  I'm Italian and can't stand the place.  Maybe it should only be a 1"}
{"text":"Sooooo yummy... we went for my bday and ordered a Salmon salad... manicotti annnnnndddd a pepperoni pizza... we loved EVERYTHING... and Jo was amazing!!!

We just moved to Verrado and we def will be frequenting this place! 

P.s. panacotta was SO GOOD"}
{"text":"We sat down, were greeted, and placed our order. No problems. The place is beautiful. The food arrived and the waitress said she'd bring the garlic bread I ordered. I never saw her again. We ate the exceptionally bland and extremely overpriced food and waited an hour for anyone to come on by. Drinks were empty (we would've ordered another beer), and I never did get that garlic bread. This place is great if you have money burning a hole in your pocket, but if you're looking for something worthwhile in order to part with your hard earned cash- go someplace else."}
{"text":"Always get great service here. Try the Vesuvio, amazing dish. Franco and Anthony will take great care of you and ensure that your experience is worth it!"}
{"text":"I had a great time at Grazie in Verrado on Saturday night with a large group: me and my husband, two other couples, four 4-year-olds and one 2-year old. You couldn't miss us.

We opted for the outdoor seating, which was very nice under the misters at 6 PM. We had a nice view of a small park area, and while the six adults and 2-year-old sat at one table, the 4-year-olds got their own table right behind us. 

We had a bottle of a great red wine - the Amarone 2003 Corte Giara. I'm a fan of bold, red wines, but my friend who was there who is more of a white wine person also really liked this wine. 

My husband and I split the Insalta della Casa - baby greens with tomatoes, cucumbers, olives and red peppers, and we had the creamy gorgonzola dressing. Yum. We also shared a pizza - the Vegetariana. I can't believe I got my pepperoni-only-eating husband to go for this, and it was really great: mozzarella (made in house), provolone, carmelized onions, roasted peppers, and parmigiano reggiano.

The kids split their own pizza: a basic cheese pizza with pepperoni on one side. 

The pizza reminded us of Cibo (which also reminds us of pizza in Italy). The crust is thin but slightly chewy. 

Next time, I want to go back without the kids for the wine-tasting events that they do. I believe the events are the first Sunday of the month, and you get to try 6 or 7 wines (and a friend told me you get more than just a \"taste\" - practically a full glass) plus a course to match each wine. It's a great way to familiarize yourself with the food and wine menu, and it's only $40 a person. There are locations in Old Town Scottsdale and DC Ranch, so if Verrado is way out of the way for you, you can try one of the other locations.

But .. the great thing about Grazie in Verrado is two doors down there is a coffee shop that serves gelato. So, after the kids ran around in the fountain (yeah, um, that's what happens when the dads are in charge of the kids while the moms pay), we walked over to get some yummy gelato."}
{"text":"Wow!  This is a fantastic restaurant with REAL ingredients made fresh!  I never thought I'd find something this good in a growing neighborhood.  The service is fantastic to top it off.  I couldn't believe they actually make their own cheese for their pizzas and calzones...fantastico!"}
{"text":"I have been to this location twice now and both times the Pizza was excellent.  The first time we had the pleasure of Franco being our server, he really makes you feel welcome and valued as a customer.  We had the Sofia and another pizza he recommended and they were both amazing.  My friends went back without me and he even asked why I wasn't there, amazing service! Make sure to try the spicy olive oil it sets the pizza off! Will be back anytime I am in the area."}
{"text":"I love Grazie's. Franco is like another uncle in my Fiance's family. We go there everytime we visit his parents. He always hooks us up with unique family style meals that are off the menu and really gives us a true family experience. Hard to find that personal attention from where we are from (Southern CA). Any questions about his foods are fully explained and its obvious that Franco does care about his customers and treats them like family. Its always a treat to go here when we are in town."}
{"text":"SERIOUSLY?  I wish I can say something nice about this place??? hmmm thinking........ thinking........Nope!  

Sorry but I wish I can say that this place is good.  

Horrible, horrible experiences. (Note:  I never rate a restaurant on the first visit, I rate on the second and third visits because there is always a bad day)

We visited this place on a busy Saturday and were waiting to be seated.  There was staff that continually would walk by yet no one would offer help or let you know they would seat you.  Finally we are seated and we end up waiting even longer for a server to approach the table.  There was other tables with people that were having the same problem.  

We ordered appetizers and they took over 35 minutes to come.  When the food arrived it was burned and the bruschetta looked like charcoal,  it was so ashy and you couldn't even eat it.  The servers was so lousy that our drinks needed refills and she would walk by multiple times and not even check in.  The people next to us had a very similiar situation and finally we got up and I walked over to speak to a manager.  

I began speaking to an older man who apparently was the owner.  I was glad that I would be able to give him feedback hoping he would empathize and be understanding of our experience.  Instead he said \" am busy right now and I don't have time to talk.\"  I looked at him amazed and I said fine then I am not paying you for your ashy bread and crappy service.  He looked at me and turned his back.  

I decided to come back to this place.  It is the only restaurant in Verrado so after a golf game we came by and I decided to clear my head and give this place another shot.  They seated me allot faster because it was dead.  I figured, great at least this time the server should be okay since multitasking would not be necessary.  She brings us glasses of water and right when I was going to take my fist drink, I noticed a big pink lipstick print on my glass!  

I put my head down and just took a deep breath.  I asked politely for another glass.  At this point I waited again because either it was the only glass in the restaurant or the server was to busy doing nothing.  

We order a cheese plate (forgive me for not remembering) and when it comes I seriously just fell off my chair.  They bring over a large plate with what looked like someone emptying a bag of cut bits of cheese into a plate.  There wasn't a difference in the cheeses and seriously I never have seen a cheese plate like that.   They serve them with \"breadsticks\" aka cheap wrapped sticks for your soup.  I couldn't even eat 10% of the plate because there was so much cheese.      

On to the Entree (yes I stayed)

I ordered a pizza with ham.  The sauce was bad, the ham was very dry and tasted rather sour.  I suppose for the price I expected better but this place is just lost.  I honestly have never had such a bad experience at a restaurant or fast food like Grazie.   Next time I am in the middle of nowhere I will starve! No Thank you"}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place! We visit at least twice a month! The prices are very reasonable and the staff is wonderful. I actually did a review vlog which you can find on our @MedelbergsTravelService Facebook page!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and nice location. I know that most people do not go to Verrado unless they live there or want to pretend that they are in Desperate Housewives. Grazie's is a great place to go for food and atmosphere. Take a drive and get some good pizza."}
{"text":"Great weeknight dinner . Staff was wonderful . Lasagne was AWESOME & my wife had the Calzone , very unique and tasty . We'll be back for sure. Try it when you pass through Verrado . Ice cold beer too , very important to me."}
{"text":"First time going to lunch ... went with a girlfriend and we both had our babies.  Thankfully the place wasn't busy or else her stroller and my wily kid would have caused a mess!

Tried their pizza this time ... thin crust Americana and it was delicious!!  Never had their pizza before so I was eager to check it out.  Definitely want to come here again!"}
{"text":"If you're out in Verrado there isn't much to choose from. Ciao Grazie is the best that is available. Good atmosphere but the food is overpriced."}
{"text":"The food on its own is very good, probably worthy of a four star rating by itself, especially considering how difficult it is to find even passable Italian food in the West Valley.  The service is very, very good - ownership is attentive and the atmosphere is very pleasant.  As for the pizza in particular: for a NY native, finding decent pizza in Phoenix is close to impossible. Good thin-crust (Italian-style, as opposed to NY- or Chicago-style), like what they have at Grazie, does happen to be a bit easier to execute, and Grazie does it well. Would I have loved to find a great NY- or Chicago-style slice instead? Sure, but good pizza is good pizza nonetheless."}
{"text":"The several times that I been here at ciao Gracies it is always been excellent the house wine is really really good not bitter not super sweet it is a Chianti and worth every penny. Everything on there happy hour list is exceptional the mango peach sorbet is my favorite with a glass of nice wine that complements the dish superb. When you walk in you are greeted as La Familia the family there are no strangers when you walk in here you are treated as if you have been missed and the owner is very personable all the staff is great to work with sharp very personable and social there's nothing to go wrong the kids have a blast what else can I say you've got to try this and you'll go back. On my number one list when I don't want to cook Italian food."}
{"text":"Very tasty and more unique, the pizzas are NOT Dominos or such, some are without sauce (eat as is or with olive oil), great wood fired oven.  We tried the Sofia and loved the smoked mozzarella.  Not cheap, but getting a higher quality product, we will be back."}
{"text":"Enjoyed an evening  of pizza, wine, and conversation! Had a glass of Pinot Noir and shared a pizza of Mushrooms, Olives, and Artichokes. DELISH! Robert our server was attentive and always smiling! Will definitely be back...."}
{"text":"This is a great pizza place. My wife has been to their East Valley location and knows the owners very well. We have been to their new location out in Verado a few times, and its been very good each time we have gone. Its currently being run by their daughter, who we are getting to know as well. Its nice that this place serves a traditional more authentic european pizza, and its family run."}
{"text":"Great oven pizza, great service. However, very disappointed with my kids Mac and cheese that is literally the Kraft Mac and cheese from a box. pay $7 for that?? . C'mon!! Even if it's for a kid, plz do something original!"}
{"text":"Great food awesome waitress Hailey. This young lady has great customer service.Will definitely go back ."}
{"text":"Small town feeling, old world taste.  You feel like a resident even if you are from far away. 

It doesn't really matter what you order, it's going to be wonderful.  I had the garlic bread to start.  Crisp and tasty with olive oil. 

My Calzone was perfectly cooked with their own concoction of fresh Marinara. My wife's Pizza was excellent and service was on time and cheerful.

Be prepared to spend a little money. We spent $25 per person plus tip but we also ordered way too much food.  I think the cost is worth it. I've spent more for a lot less!"}
{"text":"I think they have the best flat pizza in Phoenix. I have had Pizza Bianco that is supposed to be good and its OK but this is better. Great simple fresh ingredients. Great salads and entrée dishes. super wine bar. Plus its at the park in Verrado!"}
{"text":"I was thinking 3 stars, but looking back at the 105 degree day, I'll step up to 4 only because of the service.  The wine list was a little pricey and small, but I wanted a Rose and I wanted it ice cold. Our waitress brought out the ice bucket and I felt like soaking in it, but it kept the wine just right....

{"text":"Our favorite 'In the neighborhood ' home! Consistently delicious food-brought family in and always consistent for everyone.  If they don't show it on the menu, ask! Service is beyond the norm and the family owners Franco and his son Stefano-They exceed every expectation of professionalism!  We feel its worth your try and recommend stopping in.  Ambience is awesome, sit inside outside, bar, warming- So comforting and such a treat!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here on a Sunday evening. This is my second time here. It's very much a locals only establishment and by locals I mean the residents of Verrado. While our server was pleasant and food was good. There was a particular man working who appeared to be a manager or at least acted like a manager who 1) spoke to our server in a belittling way. I guess a particular table asked for salt and he said something to the extent of, \"that table has no salt. Get it together!\". And he said this in front of our table. I hate, hate, hate people who talk down to others. 2) Asked the other dining how their meal was expect for our table? This makes me think that either the other are frequent diners/residents or he didn't like \"our kind\" eating there. And by \"our kind\" I mean non-white (I hate to bring race into it but we were the only non-Caucasian dining). I really could not see any other differences with the other people in the restaurant. Anyways, he ruined the experience on what would have been a lovely dinner."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Ciao Grazie and it was wonderful. I'm not a resident of Verrado but visit the neighborhood regularly and have been kind of curious about this place for a while. I loved the atmosphere of the restaurant and the dining room appeared to be very clean. We had the garlic bread with a margherita pizza and chicken Parmesan. All the food was delicious and our server was great. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because the food took forever to get to the table. Otherwise, an excellent experience."}
{"text":"Excellent food, family neighborhood environment, and pleasant, peaceful atmosphere."}
{"text":"The dressing on the Cesar salad hands down the best I've ever hand in my life. The meatballs were good as well. We had the pizza as well and it was very delicious. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I normally don't write a bad review but I read somewhere that someone compared this place to Pizzeria Bianco so I had to try it since I live out near Verado. My wife didn't want pizza so she ordered the filet mignon and it wasn't cooked right and it wasn't even the right cut of meat. (granted you probably shouldn't order steak at a pizza joint right) I on the other hand went with what they should be good at, pizza. My pizza was awefull. Very very little olive oil and a cracker for the dough. Wjen we were seated they boasted having alot of imported Italian wine I asked for some none iodized salt.  They didn't have it! I know that may seem stupid but if you know how to cook or  eat good food then you know what I'm talking about. Now the \"new\" owner was nice enough to give us a discount for my wifes completely over cooked steak so we may give it a second chance but not unless I have a coupon. P.S. If waiting for two hours for good pizza isn't your thing, then drive alittle northwest of Bianco and go to Cibo. Almost never a wait and still really good pizza pie! Sorry about the lengthy review. Hope I help some of you save your money and not make the same mistake I did."}
{"text":"I ordered a coca cola for my child but she brought a Pepsi because, \"They dont carry coke products.\" I didnt realize this till I tasted my kids soda and told her it wasnt coke. Why couldnt she just tell me that when I ordered so I could have asked my child what she wanted that wasnt a coke? My child is not irrelevant. It also didnt taste like pepsi either, it tasted like she started with sierra mist then a quarter of the way filling it up realized it wasnt pepsi and then filled it the rest with pepsi. 
The same waitress then kept the 15$ change as if it was a tip. The bill was 25$ and I gave a 40$. Never got the change or receipt. I did get the to go box which tricked me into thinking I had gotten my change. I called in about 2 hrs later realizing that she never brought me back my cash change and I had to drive back out there from goodyear. Never got a sorry or anything. The woman was dark haired and I think she was new because I had never seen her there before.
I would also like to mention that I come here quite a bit for not living in verrado and I can never get good service. The only reason I am giving two stars is because the cook (the bald headed guy) is great at making the pizzas and hes really sweet with the kids at the window AND the owner is really nice too."}
{"text":"Perfect dinner! We stopped for a glass of wine and dinner with my eight month old daughter. She loved checking out the action in the kitchen! Our server was fantastic and we loved the decor. We had the bruschetta, cinque formaggi pizza and lasagna. We would definitely get the bruschetta and lasagna again, but would try a different pizza. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I am confounded that this place got any good reviews whatsoever! Wow. Maybe because it's the only restaurant anywhere in Buckeye and people don't have much to compare on. 
We have 4 children (3 under the age of 6) and so don't go out to eat often due to price and hassle. We were attempting to get some nice photos taken at Verrado's nice parks around dinner time. Being as this is the only choice for food within 30 miles we ate here. BIG mistake, BIG. 
The staff acted as if they were doing us a favor by serving us. Service was slow despite there only being a handful of people there. 

My biggest peeve was that the Macaroni and Cheese we ordered for the kids was crappy boxed Mac n Cheese. Seriously?!!! That is unacceptable at a restaurant. I don't even make that crap at home, now I have to pay $4.00 for it times 2!! Also, the kids drinks (juice) weren't even included in the price so we paid $10 additional for 3 small canned juices. 

My husband and older son ordered a pizza/calzone thing and said it was comparable to Peter Piper Pizza. Ick. The dough was ashen on the outside and undercooked on the inside. 

I ordered Eggplant Parmigiana, my favorite. It was mediocre at best. Very, very small portion, no noodles, no salad, no nothing at all with it and it cost me $15. 

Wait, it gets better......... 
We paid $91 for this crappy meal. ALMOST $100.00!!! And, they felt it necessary to add a 20% gratuity to our bill since we had 6 people. Ummmmm, 3 of them were UNDER the age of 6 years old! My youngest is a baby and didn't even eat! I was so mad I was literally speechless. 

Do Not Go Here."}
{"text":"Wasn't sure if this was still open, but thankfully it is! Nice ambiance with cool glassed in pizza making area viewable from dining room. Very nice outdoor patio overlooking a beautiful park. Delicious, fresh pizza and the lasagna was also yummy. Nice and prompt server. Would return."}
{"text":"The best place for pizza hands down!  We go to Grazie several times a month."}
{"text":"I ordered from here before and had a not so great experience but it seems that was a fluke. The restaurant contacted me from my previous review and asked me to give them another chance. I decided to have another try and I am so glad that I did. As I was walking up the good smelled amazing. I ordered a pizza, the 1/2 calzone 1/2 pizza and the dessert calzone. It was so amazing that my 3 yr old ate it and he had previously sworn that pizza (all pizza) was disgusting. 
This will definitely be our next date night restaurant!!! Thank you Ciao Grazie for convincing me to come back!"}
{"text":"Great service our server Cody was awesome and the food is delicious! Salad was delicious and pizza , thin crust perfect and crispy not chewy, we actually ordered an extra pizza to go. Pretty decent wine list as well."}
{"text":"Best Margherita  pizza I've had in years! Worth every single penny. Awesome quality and cooked to perfection. Definitely a must!"}
{"text":"Amazing service, awesome menu, great prices, and a patio view to die for. We love being regulars here!"}
{"text":"Nice place on Main Street in Verrado.  We have been twice.  Enjoyed both times.  Sat at a table once and the bar once.  Happy hour margherita flatbread was great.  Pizza was good...I would say great but it was a little burnt and that flavor overtook it.  The vibe is nice and relaxing.  Service is good.  View is nice .  Great for a relaxing night out.  Happy hour until 6 and full menu with plenty of variety."}
{"text":"Top 3 Pizza Place in the state, best in the west valley hands down. The Vesuvio is a must have, half calzone, half pizza, fully wonderful. 
Love the ambiance, love the service, love the food. would give it more than five stars if possible.

If you've never been here, stop what you're doing and go now. 

During the holiday season the square is lit beautifully, and will make quite the night time post meal sight.
Expert tip: the Fennel Sausage is probably the best you'll ever have."}
{"text":"Great food, good service, eaten there many times... totally overpriced, and I mean totally overpriced!  For the Verrado location and proximity to other places with food this good, I guess the prices are somewhat justified... but holy cow dude! $$$$$"}
{"text":"The main reason we happened upon this jewel of a restaurant was to escape extremely poor customer service next door  - thank you, Ground Control!!!! Grazie was a welcomed change, buzzing with activity- a variety of clientele and had an inviting wait staff. The aroma of the dishes was also a nice, warm welcome. We were very happy with our beer selection, appetizer, pizza, and espresso -but what stood out the most was the superb customer service and ATTENTIVE staff! My partner in crime and I drove into Verrado to simply explore something new and Grazie made me happy that we did!!!!"}
{"text":"We lived in Verrado for some time and one of the sad things about moving back to the East Valley is that we are no longer near Grazie. My family from WI and friends just love the place!  Authentic pizza, wine on ice, and amazing dolce desert!   The owner is personable and cares about his customers. We will miss you Grazie!"}
{"text":"The best restaurant in Verrado and Buckeye...hand's down."}
{"text":"When I moved to AZ from the east coast, everyone warned me that I wouldn't find decent pizza. I'm so happy that I settled in Verrado, because I'm a short walk from Grazie. 

Anthony (from Queens NY!) turns out fantastic thin-crust pizza. Perfect for two people to share. I haven't had a bad topping yet. The Caesar salad is also great, and a large one, plus a pie, makes a great meal for two. 

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place! We go to Ciao Grazie at least twice a week. The Americana pizza is so cheesy and delicious. We always get Caesar salads as well with the garlic bread which is like a little round pizza itself. The staff will probably know who this is by my food choices. We don't even have to order anymore. They know us so well. Everyone is very friendly and it's located in the cutest area."}
{"text":"Service was excellent!  We ordered the Americana pizza ($14) and added Italian Sausage (only $1.25 to add) and it was done quickly. It was great! You can tell they make their ingredients fresh on site. 

Their management and service is what sets them apart from competitors. We were greeted right away. Service was quick. Then a manager came over and asked how our meal was, and if we had been there before. We told him we were new and buying a house in the area. He immediately says a warm welcome and then brought us all, on the house, their dessert special the Dolce de la casa! It was sooo good! Then as we left seemed like all the staff stopped what they were doing to say goodbye and thank you.

Top notch 5 star quality business. ;-)"}
{"text":"This location in actually in Buckeye, in the West Valley. Love the vibe, the people, the food and the wine!

Grazie is a family owned & operated restaurant that is most known for their thin crust pizzas, however the menu offers so much more, and everything is yummy. The owner is from Sicily so he really knows how to do Itialian--food & wine list are far superior to other restaurants around. 

Come any day, any time, and great staff will be there to serve you. Jo (sweet, bubbly, cute gal) has always been our favorite, and Robert is really fun behind the bar to create fun mix drinks. 

Thank you Franco for choosing an extraordinary wine for us this week. Can't wait to try more of your selections. Stock up!!

Cheers"}
{"text":"We've been a handful of times and the food is amazing but the service is absolutely horrible. We would go a lot more if we didn't always have to deal with such a rude waitress."}
{"text":"What a great place . Awesome food, nice vibes and our server Jo was incredible . Live in Mesa but will be finding excuses to join Jo again for lunch!

{"text":"I live in Verrado so maybe I am biased, but I think this is a great place. I am vegan so I especially appreciate that they have a vegan (non-cheese) pizza on the menu. That being said, they will happily accommodate any other pizza on their menu, minus the cheese or meat. I also have had the insalata which is great as well, and also vegan. I like the atmosphere here a lot in the evenings -- nice comfortable, but energetic music...a very hip and modern place that is worth the drive (or walk!)."}
{"text":"Love this location however the pizza can be hit or miss. I Absolutely loved the apricot and goat cheese bruschetta appetizer but they only have it on happy hour. I would love to see this be a regular menu item. The lemon drop martini is the best bang for your buck that drink is strong but delicious!

Night 2 ! Thanks so much Guy for your wonderful service!"}
{"text":"Very friendly service and a great dining experience.   Wr sat outside which was very nice.   The pizza was probably a 3 or 4 star but the service and atmosphere makes up the difference.  And a plus,  they serve Coke products.  And there are not too mancy choices in Verado."}
{"text":"We came here for Mother's day at noon.  The place was not busy at all.  I have never been to Verrado before... OMG, it is like the set of a Weeds or Desperate Housewives.  Everything is perfect:  lawns, trees, houses, kids, etc.  

The place is on main street and easy to find (on the corner).  Cute modern decorations with indoor and outdoor seating.  

We ordered:

Platto Misto - Assortment of cured italian meats and cheese served with olives and breadsticks:  All the meats and breadsticks were good.  The cheese was a little hard and dry.  

Complimenti alla Mamma Pizza - Mozzerella, Ricotta, Ham, Salame, Parmigano Reggiano & tomato sauce:  YUMMY, love the thin crust.

Clinque Formaggi (5 cheeses) Pizza - Mozzarella, Gorgonzola, Provolone, Ricotta, Parmigano Reggiano:  This was my favorite, so good.  Excellent!!!

Americana Pizza - Mozzarella, Pepperoni, Parmigano Reggiano, and tomato sauce:  It was good, but a little greasy.

All the pizzas are thin crust and oven baked (like Sauce).  The service was OK.  When our cups when empty the server had to ask if we liked refills (you can clearly see with all the pizzas on the table that we were still eating), so yes refills on drink would be nice."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I never write reviews and seldom if ever complain about service at a restaurant... That being said, my wife and I were extremely disappointed in the service at Ciao Grazie tonight. We arrived and were seated on the patio.. It was busy but not crazy. After ordering, our waitress Jess came back about 20 minutes into it to report that the kitchen was \"a mess\" as they only had one cook. We did not see her again for the next hour+.. After 90 minutes of waiting for a salad and a pizza, I found her inside. I saw that several other tables who arrived after us already received food and it appeared as if our order was never put in.  I told her we could not wait any longer and requested our check (2 glasses of wine and an appetizer). She then brought me the check with the full amount and made no attempt to make the situation right. 

We paid our bill and left without receiving our dinner.  The worst part is we really enjoyed this restaurant in the past but will not be returning.  It's not so much the wait that was frustrating, but the fact that nobody tried to rectify the situation.

Too bad because they have great food but 90+ minutes is way excessive for a pizza."}
{"text":"I can't comment on the food because after waiting 25 mins without even being approached by the waitress for my DRINK order, I left. I watched 3 tables be served drinks AND have their food order taken. I know it's not because they were there longer than I was...considering I was waiting outside when the door were unlocked at 11am. It was a busy day in Verrado so I expected a wait, but I also expected to be assisted along side everyone else....not sure why I was ignored, I was sitting at a table that the waitress walked by several times. After I tried to call her and get her attention, she made sure not to walk by again...25 mins for drinks is not the type of service I would pay for so I had to leave. Hope the seemingly VIPs at the other tables enjoyed the meal....I went NEXT DOOR and had a great experience!"}
{"text":"This place is ok and I will continue to go but the food is overpriced and just ok.  The pizza is sort of good--but definitely not like that served in Italy."}
{"text":"Always the go-to for a nice pizza pie. The brick oven taste is great, and I don't have to go all the way into the city, or pay thrice as much."}
{"text":"My husband took me here on a Friday night ...after hearing good things about it from coworkers.

We sat on the patio which had plenty of misters and overlooked a park, it was a very relaxing environment.

Our server, Carla, was as cute as could be and was so nice the entire evening. She was one of the most attentive servers that I have had in a long time. She was so genuine and really added to the experience that we had here...thank you Carla !!!

We ordered a bottle of red wine that the husband picked, I am not sure what it was but it was damn good ($23 for the bottle). As an appetizer we had the Piatto Misto, which was an assortment of Italian meats, cheeses, olives , and breadsticks ($14) and this is definetly enough for 2-3 people. The meats were excellent and the cheese was tasty also. My only recommendation would be for them to not cut the cheese into tiny little cubes...that was odd because the meat was sliced and you could not incorporate it very well.

For dinner we shared a pizza.. The Sofia..it had Scamorza (Smoked Mozzarella),Parma Prosciutto,Parmigiano Reggiano ($13). It was ooh soo tasty. We could not eat the whole thing...there was like 3 pieces that we ended up having boxed up.

Then we had dessert.....I am still in heaven just thinking about this dessert. It was the Dolce Della Casa...Slightly Charred Sweet Calzone
filled with Chocolate Hazelnut Sauce and Banana topped with Vanilla Ice Cream...OOOOOhhh my God. This was by far the best dessert that I have had in a while. It was so gratifying...I had goosebumps after the first bite. I would recommend ordering a small and sharing it because it was huge ($7). I can die a happy woman after that dessert...and if this was a first date ...that would have been a guarantee for sex !!! 

The community here in Verrado was absolutely amazing, I wish I would have known about this neighborhood before I bought my house in Goodyear. If you live nearby I would recommend checking this place out and spending time looking around the  neighborhood."}
{"text":"This has become by far out favorite eatery in or near Verrado and honestly if we did not live here we would  one just for the pizza!  Their other offerings are really good as well, service is always spot on, and the atmosphere is comfortable and friendly."}
{"text":"Its a little offputting to order the house red for $26 and have a cranelake presented, a recognizeable $6 brand.  The service was unenthusiastic and the bruschetta was dry, however our salad and entrees were quite tasty when they finally arrived.  The patio and location were very nice, offerring my hot blonde date and I the opportunity for a stroll to the nearby fountain after dinner.  I would recommend this place, especially considering the lack of venues on the west side, but I would recommend the ownership offer a broader selection of well priced midrange wines.  - and maybe more than one pasta option to round out their italian menu."}
{"text":"Best salads and consistently excellent Flatbread oven baked pizza! Located in Verrado, Main St., the service and seating are excellent!"}
{"text":"Alma is awesome. We will be back because she was so great and loving to my adult daughter with special needs. What a great place."}
{"text":"Update*** went back after two year this evening all i can say is it's like it was when i first started coming in 2013. Franco has raised a great young man. Stefano sorry about spelling is a great manager and all around great person. Easy to talk to eager to serve. Made my dinner at the bar very enjoyable. I will be happy to bring my kids and visiting family back to Grazie!"}
{"text":"I've never gotten a bad meal here before ever. The pizza is delicious and there ceaser salads are excellent. The waiter's are nice and alway's have a smile. My only complaint is that the price is a bit high just for some pizza"}
{"text":"A bit pricey, but worth it! Visited on a Friday at 11:30 AM for lunch. our party tried the Vegetarino and the Dame Edna pizza and a spinach, cheese, cranberry salad. All were great, but completely different.

The Dame Edna and salad had huge, thin, wafers of cheese; following the server's suggestion, my son added vinegar and oil to his Dame Edna pizza for a wonderful salad-in-a-pizza.

The Vegetariano had cheese, roasted peppers and sweet carmelized onions that was other-worldly good.

Service was prompt and well done without hovering.

Three lunches, two iced teas and water, plays time, was over $55, the only downside."}
{"text":"Jo the waiter was very attentive and knowledgeable. The pizza and calzone was delicious."}
{"text":"My parent's live out this way and when I come and visit I am always looking for somewhere nice to grab a glass of wine and this is just the place I have been looking for! 
The restaurant is located right up in Verrado (which is a beautiful neighborhood) in the little town square. Service was fantastic, Wine was fantastic and the pizza was fantastic as was the desert that I got talked into! I had the Dame Edna which has Mozzarella, Arugula, Parma Prosciutto, Shaved Parmigiano Reggiano. I have tried to replicate this at home and with no avail is it as good as it is here! 
If your in the area and looking for a great place to try, go here!  Just make sure you leave some room for the Dolce Della Casa which is a slightly charred sweet calzone filled with Chocolate Hazelnut Sauce and Banana topped with Vanilla Ice Cream."}
{"text":"Great service, ask for Jo she will take care of you like a 4 star server but with and  very local style. This place gets busy for reasons other than Jo like good food wine and beer at affordable prices. There is outside dining and they can handle big groups. We had an enjoyable evening."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times and the food is really good, but it is pricey. I was a little disappointed that a pasta meal comes with just that-no bread or salad. Not even a basket of bread for the table. Considering the prices, they could at least put a piece of garlic bread with the meal. That would bump this review up to a 4 easily.  Happy hour is decent, but there's better options nearby."}
{"text":"I really like the atmosphere of this place. Indoor and outdoor seating, large selection on the menu. I really like Margherita pizza and they have one of the best I've ever had. You may be able to share but you will probably want it all to your self and have a few pieces for leftovers. Their garlic bread is amazing! Great place for a date night or to bring your kids. Everything is made from scratch and they are pretty quick."}
{"text":"Nice cozy place to have lunch. The waitress was nice and attentive. I had the side ceasar salad it was very good but 7.00 was pricey ! I had the parm panini. It was ok I felt that the ham was a bit to tough for me it should of been tender and thin sliced. The mozzarella and basil was the best part of the sandwich oh and was not warm enough. My cousin had the eggplant dish. She said it was actually good it looked good to. another problem we had here was that they did not have bread. You need bread some meals. We asked for some and I think they ran to bashas and bought an old baguette. they cut a piece off and then cut that into fours it was cold and stale. So overall I think its too pricey just for lunch food was ok the service was great. Thats why I give this place a 2. just because its in Verrado doesnt mean it deserves another star."}
{"text":"I was in town for the weekend from las vegas, and haven't had good pizza in the 3 years  living in vegas.  This was so good, so very much needed. Great place to grab a bite and a couple of drinks. If the weather is nice, you should eat outside."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with service.  During our appetizer and as a reminder it was our appetizer's we and had two appetizer's and Two beverages each.  Our server Jo comes to the table and shares she has to close out going on a lunch hour.  We said we plan on eating dinner here we will be here for the next hour!  Jo shared its policy?  I said  \"Ok\". She brings bill we paid $53 and shared on receipt cash tip on table.  She comes back and says \"Did I drop something?\"  I shared if your meaning the tip?  We shared we will be here when you get back from your lunch hour as we are relaxing and going to take our time?  I am 54 years young and when I'm eating at a over priced restaurant I should not be treated as If I can't pay the bill and close me out early?  Usually most restaurants introduce you to the server that will be taking over????  I am so angry right now I have no more words!  Enjoy your break Jo heading somewhere else as I will never recommend this place to anyone ever.  I asked the server who took over for Jo for the owners number?  Or if he was even in restaurant?  She shared no one has it and his son will be in at 5pm.  Omg!!!! Shame, shame on you Jo!!!! I'm hoping the owner will call me!  Or reply how I can contact him?"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza. I little more expensive than most pizza places, but well worth it. The salmon bruschetta is delicious."}
{"text":"Been there a few times when visiting friends in Verado, it's not bad but it does leave a little to be desired. For the price (which is high I might add) the food we've been served was not in line with the pricing. They have a captive audience in Verado and take advantage of it. 

Examples; Caesar salad that was wilted and the dressing was honestly bland. The  margherita pizza was not cooked evenly (2 different pies for 2 different people) were both the same, inconsistent dough, hard in places, soft in others and burned which from a wood oven is often very desirable but not with the different consistencies that were going on, it make it hard to eat. Finally (and this was my break of the camels back) a lasagna that was not fresh made. I've worked in restaurants and while the sauce was in house, the cheese and pasta that sat under it was not, it was pre-made brick they just toss in deep dish add sauce and cheese and cook in the oven for a few minutes. 

I can get more frills like fresh bread on the table and not having to get the waitresses attention every time my glass is empty at one of the chains 5 miles down the road. 

Again it's niche' it's for the captive audience in Verado but if someone wanted to open a better place they would crush these guys out of business."}
{"text":"Good food. Nice area. Wait staff could be a little more friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"The food is AWESOME here! My favorites are the Americana Pizza, the Cesar salad (AMAZING!) & the Spedini! Great atmosphere too!"}
{"text":"I work with a transplanted Italian that has only lived in the states for three years.  He told me this place was close to his grandmothers cooking as he's ever had in the U.S.   I took my daughter here on Saturday night and then my wife on Sunday night, it was that good.   I had three different styles of their pizza's and all were amazing.  I can't wait to go back..."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! I just dined here recently, after not visiting for a year (I live down the street from it) and the food tastes just as delicious and divine as ever. The portions are huge, so me and 2 friends shared an appetizer, salad and pizza and left extremely full and happy! 

Since it had been a year since my last visit, the service staff was all new, but they  were all as nice and friendly as ever. The food was delivered quickly and tasted incredible. And our waitress was attentive. 

What I really love about this place is their wine selection. I love white wines and especially Italian white wines. I don't know what it is, but my palette loves Italian wines. I've never had a bad Italian wine. ;) So it's great to have a wide selection of Italians to choose from here just right down the street.

I highly recommend the following dishes: 
Appetizer - Bruschette Miste (An assortment of Bruscheette. I espicially love the olive/pesto one. Spicy and flavorful!!!!)

Salad
Emiliana - The best salad on earth! And I hated salads before, until I ate this one. I try to recreate it at home, but with no luck. Grazie makes the best. The dressing is just a little sweet, but it works well with the red onions, pine nuts and HUGE chunks of Parmesan. Together it's an explosion of flavor in your mouth.

Pizza 
Vegetariana (add sausage and ricotta) - I always order the same pizza the same way. The Vegetariana alone is also delicious, with its sweet roasted peppers and flavorful cheeses. But I love ricotta and sausage, so I always add it to this order to make it the best pizza ever. Just writing this is making me crave it.

Dessert 
Pannacotta - I literally dream of this dessert. It is heaven on earth! Every dessert on their menu is really good, but this is by far the best dessert I have ever had. It's basically a creme brulee, without the crusty egg hardened top. But it tastes so much better. It's like silk in your mouth and tastes so divine. And the portion is so huge, but its still not nearly enough!

In a nutshell, I love this place and highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Ok let me just say for a VERY thin crust pizza to start, not good at all very disappointed  with is place. We waited over a hour for our pizza and it was very bland. I from Chicago and have worked at many authentic pizzerias, so I'd like to think I have a good pizza perspective. I do not recommend  this place, and if you are from the east side or Midwest... you will not like it. I will never come here again. Paid 50$ for poor service and poor food. You would think in such a prime and up coming location, it would be outstanding."}
{"text":"What a lovely place! The atmosphere was fantastic at lunch. The menu offerings are not cheap, but the food was excellent and came out in good time.

We had meatballs for an appetizer. It came with three large meatballs in a lovely pool of sauce with melted cheese on top. Good stuff, if a touch salty for my taste. Two pieces of toasted bread accompanied it.

My husband had the Caesar salad with added chicken and really enjoyed it. I grabbed a piece of his chicken and was impressed. The breast meat had been pounded and was seasoned and cooked to perfection. No overcooked, dried meat here.

I had another salad, the Carpaccio Bresaola. The ingredients are simple, but shine in their simplicity: a large bowl of arugula, thinly-sliced cured beef, and a generous heap of shaved Parmegianno Reggiano. There was a lot more meat than I expected! The slices created a sort of bowl within the bowl. A lemon vinaigrette melded everything together in a lovely way. I would definitely get this salad again."}
{"text":"First time here, and was delicious!! Highly recommend the pizza! And salad as well!
Cinque formaggi with sausage was very good!!"}
{"text":"Very appealing atmosphere. Service was very good  but we were disappointed with our food. My wife ordered a Caesar salad. She said the lettuce was fresh but for the price didn't seem like much. Small with just a little cheese on it.  Maybe throw on some bacon bits and some croutons and give a breadstick or something might have helped. Reminded me of the 2 dollar Caesar salad at Wendy's. I had a roast beef panini. It was just ok but sort of dry tasting. Seems like a lot of people like this place but our overall experience was not great."}
{"text":"Was just driving through the Verrado area with my family and came across this great restaurant. 

We enjoyed the pizza's that we ordered. It's a little greasy, but that was over looked by the great taste. I love thin crust pizza and it was a little burnt from the brick oven. I loved that burnt taste, to me it just adds a little extra flavor to the pizza. The only complaint I have is that the soda was flat.

The wait staff was great. I'm horrible with names and I can't remember for the life me. She was a very pretty brunette with a nice smile. She was very attentive to our table and very nice. Also, we meet the owner as he was energetic and was greeting everyone there. It was a very welcoming feeling in there.

Can't wait to go again......Mmmmm love the pizza!"}
{"text":"Great service, great atmosphere and most of all great food. My family and I love pizza, especially my daughter, and this is the best pizza we have had ( not only is pizza great, but so is there ravioli, salads and calzone)."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in for dinner and drinks last night. 

The good: 
They are not overly strict on their happy hour. We were able to place the drink on our tab before 6, then they served it when we were ready.
The bar staff was very friendly and attentive.
Vesuvio: 1/2 pizza and 1/2 calzone. It came out quickly and was pretty good.

The bad: 
Happy hour advertised price for draft beer was $4. When we got home and looked at the receipt, we discovered we had been charged $4.50 per beer. 
Meat sauce bruschetta: sauce was overly salty, and tasted like anything you could buy in a jar. 

With many other pizza options, we are not likely to return."}
{"text":"Not sure how this place gets business. Prices are double what they should be. Wait staff is slow and inattentive. Food is always way too salty. It's a shame they can charge practically what they want since they are one of 3 restaurants within 5 miles of Verrado. Would love to see more options around here to drive down dining out prices. $20 for mediocre, small portioned chicken parm is absurd."}
{"text":"What could  have been...................

I took my car to get serviced this morning and then I was going to head to a different pizza place.  Turns out, they don't open until 4pm during the week.  Rats!  Change of plans, stat!  I had remembered seeing this restaurant being mentioned in the \"Best Pizza in Phoenix\" category somewhere.  They had this concoction of mythological proportions called \"The Vesuvio\".  This thing was half pizza, half calzone.  I knew at some point I had to try it out.  Today was that day.  I drove down here from Surprise, parked near the Bashas and walked on over.  Cool little location and neighborhood btw.

I was greeted by a friendly host and told to sit wherever I wanted.  I chose a table kind of near the pizza oven area.  I ordered water to drink and then already knew what I was getting.......The Vesuvio!  I placed my order for that, sipped on my water and then about 10 minutes later my order was delivered to my table.  Here is how it was............

The Vesuvio ($16.00) - Right when this was delivered to my table, I knew it wasn't going to be amazing like I had hoped.  It was decent in size but there were some obvious issues with it.  First of all, the crust was really white.  They probably used too much flour to dust it and/or didn't bake it long enough at a high enough temperature.  There were no charred bits anywhere to be found.  The bottom of the crust was barely dark either.  The only dark down there was from some of the dust from the bottom of the oven it was baked in.  I decided to cut open the calzone side first.  This thing had cheese, ham and salami.  About that.....  The ham was cubed up little pieces.  While plentiful, it just didn't work for this calzone.  It would have been better with slices of ham.  The little cubes of ham just fell all over the place and were a pain in the ass to pick up with my fork to try and eat.  The salami they use seemed really pale and it was not piping hot like it should have been.  Hell, even the cheese was not totally melted all the way.  All of that paired with the soft, underdone dough was disappointing.  Next up, I tried the pizza side of things.  This was better but still not anywhere close to good.  The cheese was at least melted, there were plenty of mushrooms and the sauce was decent.  Once again though, on top of that dough, it wasn't even close to being \"good\".

Did I eat the whole thing?  Yup.  The food was definitely edible and it wasn't disgusting or anything like that.  I was just disappointed is all.  I had such high hopes and was totally let down.  The fact that I dropped an Andrew Jackson made my wallet frown too.

Would I ever come back?  Nope!  There are way too many other excellent pizza places in Phoenix that know how to cook a proper pizza.  The Vesuvio is one hell of an idea and if some other great pizzeria decided to make it, I guarantee it would be off the wall amazing!  Just turns out that the one place that does make it, Grazie, falls short.  Sad but true."}
{"text":"Yum! Our new favorite date night place to eat in Verrado. Quiet, sports on the TV, amazing food. Its a winebar but they have a full bar too. Staff is always super friendly and though their menu is a bit hard to understand what kind of pizza you are ordering (unless you are familiar with Italian) it was delicious! I hate mushrooms but the mushroom sausage pizza was ic"}
{"text":"Out in Verrado, the options are limited, very very limited when it comes to  dining (actually when it comes to just about anything).  We dined at Grazie while visiting a friend who moved to East LA (aka Verrado).

The setting/ambiance and location all were very pretty, serene and sweet.  The service was pretty slow considering there weren't that many people in the restaurant but not terribly bad. 

The food was just another boutique pizza experience.  We order the Piata Misto (assorted Italian cured meats and cheeses)-- I've had better, the quality wasn't that great and the cheese came in all these itty bitty cubes.  then we ordered about 5 different pizzas, they were good, not great.    The dessert though made me want to do cartwheels, it was the Dolce Della Casa and I want to eat one of these everyday for the rest of my life. 

So, would I eat at Grazie regularly? No.  Would I eat it if I were out in Verrado again?  Yes."}
{"text":"We came here for a late lunch. This included a party of 5 (2 adults and 3 children). The service was great. The manager was gracious and seated us. The waitress was kind, patient, and friendly. She even took the time to humor my 3 yr old. The food was wonderful. We ordered the chicken parm, manicotti, pepperoni pizza, kids pasta, and smoked salmon pizza (it had cheese, caramelized onions, and capers). Everything was fresh and delicious. For dessert, we ordered their tiramisu and dolce .....something or other (it had chocolate hazelnut sauce and bananas and was served with ice cream. REALLY rich, but so good! Definitely try it. Tiramisu was perfect. Only down side is that its kind of pricy....so come here if you've got extra money.  But definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Dropped in with my family for a NYE dinner purely out of convenience (i was staying down the street from the restaurant). 

Didn't have high expectations but it wasn't too bad. Decided to order a salad, pizza, and two specialty dishes to share with my family of four and the portions were alright. If you have a huge appetite... this place might leave you hungry.

One bad thing was that the server knew we were sharing and he let us order the manicotti and eggplant dish which were virtually identical outside of the texture. I guess I can't really blame him since I was the one ordering but it felt like we ordered the same dish.... twice. They were also overly salty which made the similarities even more apparent.

Anyway, the service wasn't that great but I give them the benefit of the doubt for it was new years eve and it was pretty crazy in there. Maybe I'll stop by there again when I come visit my parents but if you're not in the area (which you probably won't be unless you're visiting someone that lives in verrado or playing golf at raven), there's really no reason for you to come to this restaurant. But then... there aren't many good restaurants in the neighborhood to begin with so maybe it's worth a try. 

If I were to give a suggestion, I'd probably tell them to add a couple pasta dishes. Everyone loves pasta. Also... go easy on the cheese. Dishes came out super gooey.  Pizza was good but we added garlic which we were charged 1.25 for and i tasted no garlic. I think there's a disconnect with the servers and food preparers in the back. Also.. I'm still waiting for my bread that I asked for twice."}
{"text":"My family and I enjoy bringing company here. It is a small restaurant but when the weather is nice, sitting outside is very enjoyable. We love their pizzas as well as the salads."}
{"text":"Great little spot.

We had the tuscana pizza and manicotti which were fantastic, and I absolutely loved the Cesar salad dressing. The food here is just so good!"}
{"text":"We walked to Grazie from my husband's aunt and uncle's winter home in Verrado a few weeks ago and had a wonderful meal. 

I couldn't make my mind up on what to order, so I split the lasagna and Dame Edna pizza with another person in our party. I couldn't eat my half of the pizza, but splitting the dishes was great as I got to eat the cheesy, meaty goodness that is the lasagna as well as an amazing pizza. 

The Dame Edna (Mozzarella, Arugula, Parma Prosciutto, Shaved Parmigiano Reggiano) was incredible and we've attempted to recreate this dish at home. My only regret is I didn't have room for dessert."}
{"text":"If you like a high price pizza where you need two just to fill one person up this is the place. The service was slow food is ok but small for what they charge and then you have the over priced wine. My wife has something floating in her wine she said something to the owner he reached in with a spoon took it out and have her back her glass  of course she did not drink it but we were charged.  Stay away from this place"}
{"text":"This place happens to be local to family so I have had to eat here several times. With that being said I could safely say it has grown on me. However, that will not fog my ability to critique the food served here with integral judgement. 

I feel like CIao is a microcosm for the Verrado area. It strives to solidify its identity by valuing sophistication and this is evident in the types of dishes it serves. You can start with a nice appetizer like Bruschetta bread or a salad. Follow that up with a specialty pizza and your choice of italian deserts. Enjoy your evening with a plethora of imported wines. It will serve as a nice evening. 

However, with that being said Ciao is pretty pricey. There is seldom bargains as local incentives and your paying for a Scottsdale night out on the wrong side of the valley. The bang is certainly not worth the buck."}
{"text":"I was so pleased with Grazie. I am new to the area and it's a perfect place to go and have a glass of wine and a light dinner. Comfortable and good prices!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great atmosphere.  Very attentive staff not to mention friendly.  The food is fresh and absolutely wonderful.  Garlic bread is to die for!"}
