{"text":"It works, don't expect more or less than food court food from your local shopping mall."}
{"text":"Beware of the caramel apples.  My GF had one and became very sick.  I called to complain and inquire about the food handling practices of this item only to be told we check the dates.  The apples are kept at room temperature and should be refrigerated.  We ended up spending our vacation in the ER with food poisoning with a bacteria Listeria from the Carmel Apple.  Our money was returned a couple of days later but the manager didn't seem to be to concerned about the apples when I asked about the dates and storage. The $10 refund will not cover our medical expenses and the fact that we could not enjoy our time in Vegas due to improper food handling practices."}
{"text":"Whhhat is up with these pretzels?  They're amazing.  I've been to real New York, and if someone asked me where the best pretzels are, it's hands down the pretzel kiosk inside fake New York.  The plain pretzel sticks are awwwesome."}
{"text":"We ordered the sweet sticks from this place and it was not that tasty.  I think I like Auntie Annies better.  The gourmet carmel apples looked great but expensive... $12-apple!"}
{"text":"I love pretzels and this place makes them very good. I had a plain pretzel with icing for breakfast it was soooo good. Definitely a breakfast I will repeat. =]"}
{"text":"The placement of this little kiosk is perfect. Hungry and thirsty people coming in and out of the NYNY hotel will run smack dab into this place. Also, the crowds from Coyote Ugly and Pour 24 can get their munchies fulfilled by diving into a couple of these delectable soft pretzels. 

We were only looking for a snack so we tried the Jalapeno Pretzel with Tomato Dipping Sauce. The pretzel was soft and warm. Not too salty and not to spicy. It went great with our beers from Pour 24. The sauce couple have been room temperature instead of cold but the pretzel really didn't need it. Great stuff."}
{"text":"Love this place! Very busy which means product is also super fresh. Varieties of Pretzels with all of your dips, pretzel sticks, and pretzel dogs plus plenty of drinks. The pretzels are really the best I have ever had....soft, chewy and delicious. Had the cheese dip and mustard. Pretzel dogs are either 6 inch or foot long. Yum!"}
{"text":"The perfect place to stop for a snack to soak up the alcohol you've already consumed...and make room for more. 

Choose from giant pretzels, or the more convenient \"pretzel sticks\". They're greasy-butttery, super-soft and covered in salt. Then choose your dipping sauce - everything from sweet to salty. I chose the CHEESE, of course. 

The pricing is not bad - around $5 for a pretzel (or 4-5 sticks) + sauce. Definitely recommended for a quick bite, and easy to carry with you to the next bar!"}
{"text":"The display was great. That's why I wanted to try. But the taste is totally awful. The pepperoni pretzel doesn't even taste like pretzel. Oily and tasteless.  It tasted like uncooked dough. Totally a waste of money."}
{"text":"Wish I had read reviews.  The pepperoni pretzel was friggin NASTY

Do not eat here. Yuck"}
{"text":"Cinnemon Sticks & pretzels are yummy. 
I like."}
{"text":"It was not the NY pretzel I was expecting, ya know like the ones you get from the street vendors....but the pretzel was still good, more like Auntie Anns."}
{"text":"I am absolutely crazy about the caramel and candy apples they have. So many flavors to choose from! I recently found out I can order these online - http://www.newyorkapple.com

These apples are a \"must try\" when visiting Las Vegas. I'm so happy I can order from home now. They make great gifts too! 

The pretzels are soft and taste so good but the apples keep me coming back!!"}
{"text":"Stephan has been raving about this place since we met, and was finally taken last night.. And? I ordered a salted pretzel, and feel like I've been doing it wrong all these years. I've been to a bunch of mall pretzel stands and they can be really good if they're fresh, which is usually touch and go, but no matter how fresh they are I always have a bitter aftertaste (I think it's from the burnt 'butter' they use). I didn't experience any of the strange aftertaste with these pretzels.

On a side note, I NEVER get pretzel dogs or any specialty pretzels (pepperoni, jalapeño, etc.) but they don't ever look enticing to me. The ones sold here don't look that great either."}
{"text":"Got the pretzel in a cup..and oh my! Best pretzel I have ever had!! It's a must try when you visit NY-NY!!"}
{"text":"The New York Pretzel at New York -New York Hotel in Las Vegas was absolutely delicious!!!
We went back there 3 times. I had the cinnamon pretzel with icing for breakfast and another 2 flavors for lunch. I had the jalapeno and the pepperoni pretzel which was amazing.
Pepperoni and Cinnamon flavors were totally yummy!"}
{"text":"For the record, I love soft pretzels. The salt pretzel stick we had from here were like a little piece of pretzel heaven if you ask me. Hands down the best soft pretzel I have ever had! I had it with good ol' yellow mustard as well as with their cheese sauce. Both ways were awesome."}
{"text":"This place sells the best pretzels. I have gotten the salted pretzel and a cinnamon pretzel and I have loved both. I love stopping here for a snack before I head out for the day or before I go back to the hotel. There is usually a line but it is well worth the short wait."}
{"text":"Yummy pretzels here!! It's located towards the front of New York New York and right next to the Starbucks. I think it's kind of a hidden gem because when most people thing pretzels, it's just like any other pretzel place. This one is different though!

The toppings are delicious and the bottom of the pretzel is nice and crispy but soft on the inside. I've been here twice and I do have to say it is one of the best pretzel places I've eaten at! I think prices are a tiny bit steep (4.99) but I think is worth it"}
{"text":"Amazing Pretzels! I had the Jalapeno one, and Pepperoni one!

Very Good Stuff!"}
{"text":"I'm in heaven.. I found this place last time I was in Vegas.  It is near the exit that is by the walkway to MGM.  The jalapeno pretzel is out of this world.  they are large, fat, soft, and warm!  The \"everything\" was my second fave.  I have to get these pretzels everytime I am here!  We went twice this time!  They also have yummy caramel or candied apples."}
{"text":"Ewwww. Salted pretzel tastes like pancake on the inside. Yuck. I threw it away."}
{"text":"wetzels has a much better tasting pretzel IMO, end of discussion. Tried plain one wasnt impressed. The wetzels plain much richer and buttery, whatever its the cheapest breakfast."}
{"text":"I must be spoiled by Auntie Anne's because I expected New York Pretzel to taste warm, fresh, and delicious  however I was greatly disappointed.  Usually my family and I are devouring and fighting over the warm, yummy pretzels but at New York Pretzel, no one even wanted to finish our pretzel. It was disgusting. 

I ordered the cinnamon sugar sticks with icing as well as some wannabe almond flavor. It does not even compete with Auntie Anne's (and no I do not work at Auntie Anne's, lol). The pretzel was kept in a warmer however it did not taste fresh but tasted old and stale, as if it had been kept in the warmer for longer than the allowed time. The pretzel was flavorless even though it was covered in sugar. It could not mask the fact that the dough beneath was too dense with a disgusting texture. It was not even chewy but just flavorless dough with too much baking soda. 

Never again."}
{"text":"Pretzel Dog and Cheese, 'nuff said...

Seriously, get like 3 of them, eat one while drunkenly stumbling back to your hotel room, eat one when you wake up hungover and where'd that other one go?

Okay, eat two on your drunken walk home.

YUM!  

No other pretzel dogs compare...maybe Annie's if you have one locally, but I don't and I never saw one in Vegas, so NY it is."}
{"text":"Purchased a candy apple and it was VERY disappointing. The outside of the apple looked amazing- the problem is that they used a very poor quality apple and it cost $16! The apple was mushy like it has been sitting out for 5days- disgusting. I would have been disappointed if I paid $4 but it is offensive when you spend that much money; you just expect more."}
{"text":"I got a mr peanut and a lemonade. The service was awesome got military discount. Was about 50%. Highest ever got. Then the lemonade was so good. Like back in the day stand at a ball game. Mmmm just thinking about it. Going to eat my mr peanut now....its calling me"}
{"text":"This location is in the New York - New York Hotel & Casino just across from Starbucks on the 2nd Floor. 

I *love* the pretzels here! I tried the Jalapeno and the Cinnamon & Sugar and they were both fantastic. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This review is for the pepperoni and cheese pretzel. Without a doubt the worst pretzel I ever did not eat. Awful . I bought this to have as a late night snack. This has to be a mistake as the dough has a sweet sugary taste with an  apple smell and microscopic thins slices of pepperoni and maybe something related to cheese in another life. After a few bites I could no longer convince myself that my taste buds were acting up and had to face the fact the thing was obnoxious and I could not eat it. Place looked fine otherwise I would not have purchased the pretzel and if I has eaten it right away I'm sure I would have swapped it out . But a review is a review and this is mine and my sad experience with the cheese and pepperoni pretzel."}
{"text":"Located on the 2nd fl by walkway to MGM. Original pretzel is good. Salty pretzel bites are... meh.  Cheese tastes like processed cheese. Pretzel dog was ok."}
{"text":"I never waste any food but I wouldn't even feed this to my dog. The pretzel tasted like undercooked, like dough. I am never ever getting a pretzel from here yakkk!"}
{"text":"Awful.  Pretzel dog was soggy and gross. Cream cheese frosting for cinnamon sugar sticks was weird.  Other stuff we tried was soggy as well. Probably would love if drunk."}
{"text":"I never fail to have a Fat Tuesday in one hand and a Jalapeno Pretzel from New York Pretzel Co. in the other every single time I'm in Vegas. Maybe it's because they are in close proximity with each other but I'm glad it is. I sporadically crave their Jalapeno pretzel, which is a lot better than the pretzels in Wetzels Pretzel but maybe that's the Fat Tuesday talking haha."}
{"text":"Bought the caramel peanut apple and it was rancid.  We brought this to the attention of the cashier. She said \"well if that one is bad then they are all bad\". So we told her\" so you are selling rancid apples?\"  Then she said talk \"to the manager.\"  The manager then gave us a new one. However that one was not good either.  The apples look delicious but taste horrible. Would not recommend this place  or ever go back."}
{"text":"Snack time! Feeling a little hungry after walking the strip? This place was perfect and the Parmesan pretzel hit the spot-fresh, warm, soft and dipped in cheese. Yummy :D
The pretzel was huge and perfect for sharing..
I would definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"I opted for a water and almond-crusted pretzel so I could make the trek back to my hotel (the Venetian). The pretzel was very good but after eating almost the whole thing it started upsetting my stomach. Mmmm...This review is very lame. Sorry about that! I just don't have anything else to say. It was a pretzel!"}
{"text":"So I'm getting married in Vegas this October and one of the things I'm looking forward to most with my partner in crime is sharing the joy of these fruckin' pretzels!! I am counting the days. Seriously. The plain unsalted pretzel regardless of dipping sauces is so dreamworthy alone. I miss you... I can't wait to see you again."}
{"text":"The pretzels here are average. I have no complaints but it wasn't spectacular. Most of the pretzels here are $5 or you can get a plain Nathan's Hot Dog for $5. This place also sells the candy apples for $8.

We ordered the Cinnamon Sugar pretzel. It was on the bigger side. When we received it, it was warm. The inside was soft and chewy. The outside was a tad bit hard so I'm not sure how long it was sitting under the warmer. The ratio of cinnamon to sugar on it was perfect."}
{"text":"The jalapeno pretzel was very good. Great snack stop when your walking around the strip."}
{"text":"After reading these reviews, I probably went on an off day. I got the pretzel sticks and lemonade. The pretzel was undercooked and tasted like a warm dinner roll with salt and the lemonade was really watered down. Had a much better pretzel in the bread basket at Mastro's later that night."}
{"text":"Maybe I should have gotten a pretzel at the New York PRETZEL Co., but I went for the Caramel Apple instead. Bad choice. It was SOOOOOOOOO hard! If I had filings, the caramel would have broke them all :( Oh and it was $10... ew."}
{"text":"Plenty of pretzel options whether you enjoy pretzel sticks, hotdogs, or any of the multiple pretzel combos such as jalapeno, salted or pepperoni. There are also beautifully done caramel apples. I got the pretzel hotdog and there was nothing too special about it. Pretzel was kind of doughy but not terrible. The price was good at least. It is in a good location on the top floor (mezzanine) on your way to the MGM Grand bridge. So if you are looking for a quick bite on your way to the next casino than this is for you."}
{"text":"Before leaving Vegas I picked up some snacks, got the pepperoni pretzel and the Jalapeño Hot Dog.

Had those for lunch and after reheating them they tasted okay. Seriously doubt they tasted better last night when I got them."}
{"text":"I was very impressed with the taste and quality of the pretzel I had here. I actually thought that it tasted better than auntie anne's."}
{"text":"it's like Aunt Anne's but a wee bit better. it's so easy to locate too. it's at the New York New York Hotel. it definitely filled me up for a quick snack. a must have when you're at the hotel"}
{"text":"Random snackery that wasn't a fail: Jalapeno Pretzel + Cheese = YUM!"}
