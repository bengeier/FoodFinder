{"text":"Up until tonight this place was one of our favorites in the neighborhood. We always order the same thing - Butter chicken, vermicelli and avocado smoothie. We liked the place because the food always tasted fresh and nicely prepared and we like that they use aluminum trays instead of styrofoam ones. Tonight we ordered delivery which took more than 40 mins.  The avocado smoothie was very dark and tasted so bad we couldn't finish it. Same with the food.. Butter chicken was bland and the beef in my vermicelli didn't taste fresh. Even the spring rolls were a bit off. Giving them a 2 star hoping it's just an off night they were having. But I'd probably will need to be pretty desperate to return to this place. Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"So I finished work and I was in the area. I didn't want Mikey's so I saw Ginger Express and said \"Hey why don't I give it a try\" . I was confused to what I wanted and wasn't sure. So the Chef helped me. I am vegetarian ( or I switched recently) and wasn't sure what was good. He recommended the Saag Paneer. I got it with rice. OMG !! Was it good. I couldn't believe it. I was stuffing my face like no tommorow. I was embarrassed but I was hungry. It was creamy, rich with cubes of Paneer slightly spicy ( cause I asked for heat) and it complimented the buttery rice so perfectly. It was delicious no words to describe it. It is a gem hidden in the he wall."}
{"text":"Beef, oh glorious beef. Ginger Express knows how to cook a good flank steak. The grilled beef pho and vermicelli are both delicious and flavourful, you can tell they know the key is tossing in cornstarch to pick up all the marinade. Although the pho broth wasn't particularly special, it does win points for not being salty! Saag paneer spring rolls are like eating pillows of spinach and cheese, everything is tasty when it's in a wrapper. There needs to be more Indian curries wrapped in phyllo, it should be a requirement!"}
{"text":"I had the chicken wings here and they were terrible. Overly saucy and crusty from the fryer. Everything in there looked two steps off--a viet place that serves Indian food...?! Which are they even good at? Saw them microwave a soup."}
{"text":"Cheap and cheerful! They are super friendly, call ahead if you can! Pho broth is surprisingly tasty! They have recently added fresh rice paper rolls to the menu and they were awesome! Commonly order pho, and rice dishes...never disappointed."}
{"text":"Mediocre. Ordered on Uber Eats and was really disappointed.   Veggie rolls tasted like old oil and had bland filling, plus the picture was of cold rolls and these were fried.  Naan looked like it came from grocery store or was stale.  Cauliflower and potato was fine, cauliflower was slightly under cooked.  Will def not be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Good food for the price you're paying. Really liked the chicken spring rolls. The grilled beef was good, great portion size and the rice that came with it was nice. Tried the naan bread and it wasn't so great but not bad by any means.   Quick service. I called ahead and they said about 7 minutes. I got there about 10 minutes after calling and they were putting the last of it in my bag.   If you're a little low on cash this is a good option to get a meal. I'll be trying again."}
{"text":"While this restaurant looks like a hole in the wall, it's great! Good little to-go place in Roncesvalles. Prices are super affordable. They serve a lot of different things (ie. Indian, Vietnamese, and Thai). I only tried the Indian food. It was good. Especially the spinach paneer roll. If you happen to live in the area and are looking for a cheap, but delicious to go option, you should try this place! They also had banh mi (Vietnamese subs), but I didn't get a chance to try it... Maybe next time."}
{"text":"Love the grilled beef. Really live it. Would not inside on a bar stool or will not bring my date there. Will pickup to eat at home. Tasty food. Fast preparation. Working till 10pm which is really convenient for me. Grilled beef, chicken, shrimp dish outstanding. Really affordable price. Love that place. Thank you guys! You are my savers for late dinner!!!"}
{"text":"The fresh rolls and tofu/veggie pho are amazing! And such friendly, great service. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Amazing value, generous portions, tasty food.  I have an immense respect for establishments that serve hardy meals at affordable prices and the previous Ginger location I visited always fit this bill. This Ginger Express is no different, except in that its menu is a mix of Thai and Indian.  The Thai food on the menu is more limited, but perhaps this is a good thing. I was always overwhelmed and confused what to get at other Gingers. Here you pick grilled chicken or beef for instance, than your rice/noodle. I opted for the Grilled Beef on Pad Thai noodles and it did not disappoint. It came with a pile of meat and veggies on Pad Thai noodles covered in sauce so each bite was flavourful. For 6.95 it was an amazing deal.  I also got the Saag Paneer Spring Rolls that a previous reviewer recommended. Good texture, but not the best flavour as is. But if you use the sauce that comes with it for each bite it's a pleasant experience.  The inside might not look like much, and the location might not be the most desirable, but man did it hit the spot on a hungry day. Would definitely consider going back here for my Thai needs on Roncy."}
