{"text":"It's been a while when I was there, but actually was for my birthday (2 couples).  It was a rainy summer night so the patio we hoped to sit on was washed out.  It was a Thursday, and it wasn't too busy - which is a shame, because it really was a good place.

Since I was there about 5 months ago, I won't go into too much detail, just the thoughts that I remember.
1) The atmosphere/aesthetics of the place was nice and modern and clean
2) Service was excellent - really was (better judged though when it is busy)
3) The prices of food are very reasonable indeed.
4) Food - We all ordered something different - meats, fishes, appetizers - I remember that the presentation was excellent, and the food very tasty.  

I haven't yet, but I would definitely go back.

BTW, they really should get a new website , Google can't even find it : http://www.rushhour.biz/ (I think I saw it on their matchbook or something)"}
{"text":"Wonderful!!

What more can i possibly say about this little restaurant. Went for the first time last evening, had a reservation for 7:00, how nice to be seated right away. ( it was empty at the time!)  but did fill up quickly.
Water was brought ASAP, butter and a hummus type spread, then came the very hot bread 2 little loaves more than enough for the 3 of us. Then to our surprise the server came over to our table with a bottle of Port for a drink, ( I'm not a fan of Port but to those who do appreciate this wine it was nice)
We ordered the Tiger shrimp in pernod as an app which was very nice, sauce was sooo good, especially for dipping your bread into! We each ordered a different entree,  Fettucine Alfredo with shrimp, Penne a La vodka and the chicken supreme. 
Wow, the food here is amazing, had I realized that it was a Portuguese restaurant I definitely would have ordered a chicken or fish dish instead of the pasta. The chicken supreme was gorgeous and amazing, the potatoes are sooooo good and both of the pasta dishes were  very nice as well.

The service,the food and the ambiance were all amazing and for 3 people with a bottle of wine was under 100.00$!!!!! the service was so nice, very efficient and not intrusive. I will also add you aren't crammed in next to your neighbour, lot's of elbow room!

I highly recommend this cozy little spot. :)"}
{"text":"Food is simple and very well executed.  Service is exceptional and the price is quite reasonable.  Nice decor, lovely patio for summer evening dinning.  Great wine selection.  Will happily come back."}
{"text":"Such a hidden gem! I just moved into the neighbour and I see this place everyday driving to and from work but it doesn't look very appealing from the outside. Friday night I was looking for a place to go with my friend for dinner and thought I'd look up this place. The reviews I found were all great so i figured why not! It's a cute little place inside with not many tables, nice ambiance, candles and music were very nice. Quite a romantic place so I'd recommend it for a date but also great for a girl's night out dinner. I ordered the mango shrimp salad to start and it was absolutely AMAZING!! highly recommended, the dressing was so delicious, yum! Then I had the gnocchi for my entree which was delicious! For dessert, we shared their homemade tirimisu which was sooo amazing. OH and i can't forget the fresh baguette, it was warm and crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside YUM. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone. Only $90 for 2 people with tip, one drink each, 2 apps, 2 entrees, and 1 dessert. Can't go wrong! Look forward to checking out the patio in the summer :)

Only 4 stars because the service was a little bit slow.. food was fast but the server wasn't quick to ask us about dessert and bring the check"}
{"text":"This place was a surprise, but we have since gone back for more! Awesome food, totally sweet server. A diamond in the rough."}
{"text":"I've come here a couple of times with big groups (one of my friends loves this place so he always invites us here when he wants to celebrate something) and have always had amazing service.  The food is great: huge portions and good quality ingredients, and though there's nothing on the menu that's particularly unique, it's all executed well.  On my most recent visit, I had the mango salad, which is easily big enough for a meal and is served in a tortilla bowl for extra fillingness.  Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Great location with a large patio.  We didn't make reservations for a busy Xmas season but the waiter was able to accommodate  and make do.  It's a restaurant that is busy but they value business ( not your snobby resto that that has too much business to turn down ppl).  Wonderful rustic northern Italian and intimate atmosphere, with a Portuguese flair. Great northern Italian pastas, as well as picania, and Portugese dishes .  Well worth the visit"}
{"text":"Incredible service and super yummy food. Great atmosphere. Just an overall awesome dining experience. Will be coming back again!"}
{"text":"Can't say enough; this family run restaurant is an absolute gem. Food is superb. Service is top notch. Fernando ensures everything is perfect...every time. Even when the main restaurant is closed for private events, the family is attentive to the patio. Will come back again and again."}
{"text":"Fine dinning at a very reasonable price. Excellent service and good portion size.  There is a wide range of food options such as seafoods, chicken, pasta, risotto etc.. 
Can accommodate vegetarians."}
{"text":"It's been 24 hours and I still can't get over how amazing my meal was at Rush Hour.  A group of us went out to celebrate a birthday and we couldn't have picked a better place.  Even though it's not officially summer yet, they humoured our request for sangria and put together the best one I've had in the city, full of different kinds of fruit but not too sweet.  

The service was beyond compare, completely attentive without being intrusive.  I also loved the music, a laid back mix of french folk-y sounding music and acoustic rock.  All of these wonderful things, and that's not even the best part!  The meal itself was fantastic.  I ordered the Picanha (Brazilian steak), which was actually 2 steaks (!!) served with salad, fries, rice, and beans.  The steak was cooked perfectly to order and it was so flavourful with a nice crisp grilled outside.  The prices are very reasonable, especially considering the quality of the food, the portions and the service.  They also have a nice patio that I'm planning to visit for more sangria in the near future.  This place is a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Went there on our anniversary and got Brazilian steak and Portuguese steak.  Most excellent. The waitress honoured the occasion with some free port.  Very cute place - not sure if extension ladder over the bar was meant to be ironic tribute to Portuguese construction worker neighbourhood, but I liked it.  We'll definitely try this little place again."}
{"text":"Probably my favourite place in the city for a great full meal. From the occasional welcome glass of port or the fresh bread while you food is being prepared the Rush Hour is a clinic on how a restaurant should be run. 

In summer there is a patio off to the side that is great to spend the afternoon on with a book and beer. 

When I used to live on Lansdowne it was definitely a twice a month visit and now out in Oakville I am sad that my visits are less frequent. 

They are closed Monday and usually require a reservation Friday / Saturday but I guarantee it is well worth the visit."}
{"text":"My husband and I have come here a handful of times.  Everytime we are greeted by the owner and he is just delightful.  The food is all made from scratch and the 2 dishes I have tried here really good.

I would recommend this restaurant, it's cozy and the price is great for the quality of food."}
{"text":"Just a fantastic spot in the least likely of places. Staff was very professional. Little touches and attention to detail in the service. Fantastic bread and hummus on the house plus the best fish I've had in the city. Nothing over done. Just let the ingredients speak for themselves. Fried apple dessert was amazing (I'm not even a big fan of dessert)."}
{"text":"Great food, big portions and nice ambiance. Owner is the person mostly serving and is passionate About his guests having an enjoyable experience. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Love their patio. I had the lamb which was perfectly executed. It was seasoned well and the fat was nicely charred. It was cooked medium rare just as I had requested. The risotto was creamy but not overly so. Service was attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"Nice little spot in the middle of uptown Toronto. Atmosphere is nice and comfortable. 

Food was disappointing. I had the \"Penne a la vodka\" which left me dissatisfied. Bacon was overcooked while the pasta was undercooked. Flavours were bland as well. 
Cheesecake is amazing! 

Service started off great. We needed a quick accommodation and it was done quickly. About half way through the evening, our waiter seemed to forget about us completely. From that point on, it was a frustrating experience. 

Based on reviews, we expected better. Maybe next time."}
{"text":"This place is NEVER open, stroke of luck that it was tonight. 

Portions are fairly large. 

Mussels to start in a white wine sauce. Everything was properly prepared but we didn't care for it. 

Gnocchi was good. Prepare to bowl over in pleasure from the smell of the dish (doesn't taste as good as it smells, sadly) but still pretty good. Chicken was super juicy and tender. :) 

T bone steak... Disappointing, ordered medium rare and it came out rare. FULL of bone. Tasteless. Inedible. Potatoes on the side were your run boiled potatoes. 

Service was fairly good - waiter and the owner (I assume) checked on us fairly frequently. 

Ambiance is lovely. It's a beautiful restaurant! 

Buuuuuut between the hours and the food, won't be back."}
{"text":"This is a Portuguese restaurant, although it came in under the Italian banner when I did the search.
It has its own parking and is spacious inside, so conversation is easy.
The service is excellent, as with all good restaurants, the owner is on the premises.
The menu is full and interesting.
We had tasty shrimp, (forget the mango salad), and certainly spicy chorizo salad, (good, but a bad choice on our part).
The seafood risotto was honest, having plenty of muscles, shrimp, scallops, salmon, etc, but in our view somewhat bland.
The Australian lamb was ample and cooked exactly how we asked.
The desert list is standard but we didn't try anything.
Including two bottles of excellent Aberino, the bill came in less than $100 per person including everything.
They bring a plate of fish to the table and you can have any one that you select cooked in the manner you choose. Maybe this is the thing to do in this restaurant."}
{"text":"I wen't just recently for a co-workers birthday party. Starters was delicious and filling. I loved their freshly baked bread and the salad is divine. And it was hands down the best kebab I've had. It was a dinner special though so they might not have it available at all times... The gnocchi was also very good. And the port wine? ah, it was love:)"}
{"text":"The service was fantastic. Our server (possibly the owner?) had the patio table set up for us as we were getting out of the car. We were sat under a huge umbrella, which shielded us nicely in the rain that came afterwards (is there anything more romantic than dining in the rain? IS THERE?)

We began dinner with a complimentary glass of port. Very tasty. I was a bit disappointed by the booze menu. Only Steam Whistle and Flying Monkeys (errggh no thanks) on tap, and only French Cross by the glass. This is the wine I usually buy for cooking, not drinking. 

The food was delicious and the portions were huge. The calimari appetizer was fantastic and perfectly cooked. For my main I had the grilled whole seabream, which was the daily special. It was a touch overcooked, but otherwise very good. I had no hope in hell of finishing off my plate. The Hubster had a caesar salad and the chicken parmiagiana, which he really enjoyed.

What really stuck out at this place was the service. You could tell that everyone there really cares about what they're doing. 

The only thing that bugged me a bit was that the patio is pretty loud, as it's right on Dufferin street. 

This spot is pretty close to our house. I'd likely bring the in-laws here if they were ever looking for a fancy spot to dine."}
{"text":"Rush hour is a nice little gem in the neighborhood. My party and I all got different mains and they were all fantastic! The owner here is super friendly and attentive. The rest of the staff also offered great service. I highly recommend this place if you want to impress your date. I will be coming here often."}
{"text":"We had an amazing experience at Rush Hour this evening. I brought my boyrfriend for his birthday dinner. From the start we were impressed with the decor, the ambiance, and the friendliness of the staff.

Fernando served us most of the night and was an exquisite host. We went with the specials, the lamb shank and the veal. Both were perfectly cooked. He even brought me another smaller lamb shank since I devoured the entree so quickly, all free of charge; we definitely felt welcome and well taken care of.

We finished with the chocolate brownie cheesecake and the apple beignets which were exquisite.

We left extremely pleased and will definitely be returning. The food and service was great at this price level especially."}
{"text":"This hidden gem is a small intimate fine dining Portuguese restaurant with excellent value and food so tasty you'll be licking your plate. 

We came with a large group, and on a quiet Sunday night, we were one of the few in there, with some one or two other couples. The entire place seems to only fit a handful of diners, so make sure to make a reservation!

If you're a light eater, I would recommend sharing a plate with your DPs. The portion sizes are large, and be prepared to stuff yourself. 
We shared a plate of Mussels ($10) and the Pichana Steak (Brazillian seared steak, served with salad, black beans, fried seasoning, and rice). With 2 glasses of wine it was $45 including taxes. 

Taking advice from other reviews, I knew that there would be 2 steaks. It was so flavourful, and I liked that it was thin. It was perfect to share and still have room for dessert. 

Other friends ordered the Risotto. It was a really great portion and very filling. Possibly can share this too. 

There was also a steak and risotto plate which I was surprised one of my guy friends couldn't finish!

We also brought our own bday desserts, and they nicely plated them without a fee! Very rare. 

They were also very friendly, although slow to collect our empty plates (altho we weren't in a rush), and made separate bills upon request. 

This is definiately somewehre where we'd come again, for a date or bring our parents. Something more unique than typical 'canadian' food, with excellent value. At least, that's what's important to me.

I was told that I should rate this badly, so that this place doesn't get too popular, but can't help it, I have to share!"}
{"text":"I loved the place. The service was awesome and kind. 
Although they didn't have the Albarinho wine I wanted, they made a good suggestion of a vinho verde.
The food was perfectly cooked and in big portions.
I would suggest to make reservation because gets busy for dinner.
Can't wait to go back for oysters and wine at the patio."}
{"text":"Incredible food and a great restaurant ! All the items on the menu sounded amazing as did the specials. We were a group of 5 celebrating a birthday. They brought complimentary bubbly for us! 
I had the salmon (so good), the portions are generous and prices are fair! The Caesar salad was delicious as was the browny cheesecake desert. 
The presentation for each plate was beautiful  It's a small restaurant - make sure to make reservations !"}
{"text":"Amazing food and amazing service. We wanted to share their onion soup and they served it in different soup plates which was very thoughtful of them. Got lobster risotto ( I asked to add mushrooms and they were happy to accommodate my request), filet mignon was just perfect ( we asked for medium and it was super tender and juicy) . Highly recommend!! :)"}
{"text":"First thing's first: I will be going back here. Let's get that out of the way. I enjoyed Rush Hour enough that, despite some niggling problems, I'm sure we'll be back shortly.

It has a great little atmosphere, a nice patio, and the food/service overall was excellent. However, there were some problems:

1)I asked for a Margarita and was served some neon green kool-aid grainy/gritty disgusting thing that was probably the worst cocktail I've ever had.

2)My wife's Vodka Penne was good but the pancetta in it was of such low quality, it was all fat, bitter, just left a bad taste in your mouth. Kind of ruined the dish for her. If you're going to use really shitty pancetta and wanna save some money, just use bacon instead. Yeesh.

Overall though we had a nice time on the patio. Can't believe how CHEAP this place is, especially for wine, not much of a markup on the bottles. That was nice.

We'll be going back for sure, hopefully we'll have better luck on some items."}
{"text":"Lovely place - thoroughly enjoyed it! Between the group of us, we had the steak, and two types of fish. All were big portions and the fish was really fresh. We also had the oysters for appetizers and they gave us a huge loaf of bread with hummus to start as well. Will definitely return. Great price too!"}
{"text":"Wow! This is an amazing restaurant. The food and service are excellent. It reminded me of some of my favourite restaurants in Mtl as the atmosphere is sophisticated, but also relaxed, the food is on point and they really know how to treat their customers right. It's a bit expensive, but is definitely worth it especially if you are celebrating a special occasion (like a Friday night!)"}
{"text":"The food I will give it 5 out of 10
Had no sauce 
The light inside the restaurant was so dull 
It toke a little more time to save us"}
{"text":"Name does NOT match the restaurant.  \"Rush Hour\" sounds more fitting for a café, sandwich place, other takeout restaurant where you just pick up and go.  So when I arrived, I was surprised to find: 
1) FREE dedicated parking alongside the restaurant, 
2) a patio &, 
3) white table cloths with wine glasses on top.

I was going to ask the server about the name, but I forgot.  Plus, I didn't want to be rude since they were soo nice!  They even made me a port tonic - off menu, made sure it was the way I liked it, AND even changed it by adding the ice cubes...very important.

Complimentary bread (different kinds)/hummus - Excellent!

Calamari - I wished it was a bit more grilled.  I know it can get rubbery when cooked more, but I love the grilled taste and that just wasn't that prominent.

The pastas were hidden in the \"Hot off the pans\" portion of the menu.  I just read through it and there was no pastas with a rosé/tomato-based sauces.  I'm sure they could've accommodated this request, but you'll hafta consult your tastebuds as to whether or not those combos will taste well together.

My friend had the steak and it was cooked as per his request.  Fries were amazing, golden brown.  I hate when restaurants under/overcook fries or they're limp/greasy.

We were too stuffed for dessert, but the server brought us complimentary Natas.  Yum.  Will be back for either an occasion or a treat meal!"}
{"text":"This place....the food...I drool! 

The service I would have to say was on point all night.  I went with my boyfriend and another couple and we were able to talk all night without having a waiter every 10 minutes ask us if everything was ok.  I enjoy when waiters ask once, maybe twice (as they did) but when it's every 6 minutes OMG let me talk to my friends....

I wish I took some pictures of this place because it is so cute...perfect for a first date.  The food was SO good, and the plate was completely filled, and this is a BIG plate.  I actually got full 3/4 of the way but I HAD to finish it!! 

The bread was fantastic, my boyfriend, one of my guy friends and myself were late while my guy friends girlfriend sat there and waited for us.  She told me they treated her very nicely while she was there alone and gave her fantastic bread.  

I had red snapper and I'm telling you it is to DIE FOR!  

Cost: 4 people, 2 apps, 4 mains, 2 desserts $120.
Food quality: 5/5
Food quantity: 5/5
Wine Selection: 3.5/5
Service: 4.5/5
Perfect for: First dates, anniversaries, any romantic setting.

Would I Go Again: HELL YES!"}
{"text":"The Seafood Penne in Alfredo Sauce seemed to be lacking the strong cheesy flavour that I loved before.  The Picanha Steak came slightly over cooked instead of medium.  The complimentary bread selection and chickpea hummus were good. The Chocolate Brownie Cheesecake and Pineapple Sorbet (served in half pineapple) were fantastic and refreshing, definitely the highlight of this meal."}
{"text":"I was very impressed with the restaurant. It's not the biggest place but quiet and romantic. The restaurant does take reservations, and it seemed like they were booked the entire night when we got there with reserved signs on the tables.

Service was very attentive and made sure you were well taken care of. It is quite possible this was family-owned, although I'm not sure (which can make quite a difference). 

They gave us a basket of bread with hummus -- who doesn't love bread?!

Ordered the grilled calamari -- Delicious!!! Tender and well-seasoned. 
Main -- Chicken Parm was HUGE. I could only eat half of it. It was so tender and juicy. Came with a side of veges. Also got the special Steak kabob ft. filet mignon, chorizo sausage and steak. That was also quite filling and delicious. 

Price was very reasonable, especially with the portion size. We were quite full and couldn't even finish it all, so make sure you're hungry! 

Drinks were around $5. Pretty cheap as we ordered a fuzzy navel and mill st. beer. 

Didn't order dessert but they had a good variety: apple beignet, cheesecake, sorbet, etc.

Our bill came up to $80 for everything. Not bad at all! Would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone with taste."}
{"text":"Went to this little, cozy, restaurant with the wife. Quiet, intimate and romantic resto with attentive owner and unpretentious and capable staff. We had crab croquettes, a Caesar salad, I had the salmon (delicious! Crispy on the outside and perfectly flaky on the inside). Desserts: tiramisu for me and my wife had chocolate brownie with ice cream. A very fine and gorgeously tasty meal."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for dinner the other night and overall we felt it was quite good. Both of our meals were above-average taste wise and very reasonably priced with large portion sizes. The only things that would make me reconsider going back where the amount of noise from Dufferin street traffic and the slightly unusual service. I'm guessing that it is a family-run establishment and some of the service was a little slow and awkward at times. Nothing too bad just a little weird."}
{"text":"Great food, priced well with exceptional service. A true neighborhood gem. Fresh fish and seafood, quality meat and farm to table vegetables. Amazing outdoor patio in the good weather. Warm indoor atmosphere rest of the time.  Really good quality and good fun."}
{"text":"I have this buddy, and when we decide to go have dinner together, we often just hem and haw and aimlessly paw through our Yelp apps. You know, before deciding to go to one of the same two or three places.

Well not tonight! Tonight we hit Rush Hour and it was tasty. Oh the pastabilities! My gnocci was a huge bowl of creamy goodness, and my buddy got the chicken parm, sub in a pasta side. It looked awesome. He doesn't really like cheese, so he left his mozza topping (fool), but if you are a cheese lover, this is definitely the dish for you. 

Lovely street-side patio, cute bright interior covered in wine bottles and really kind servers."}
