{"text":"Nice atmosphere and terrific pasta dishes. Their vegetarian lasagna  is oustanding!"}
{"text":"Great food, we always order the Black and Bleu Bruschetta as an appetizer and typically try a different dish each time.  We have never been disappointed in a dish.   The waitstaff is always nice and can answer any question we may have in regards to the menu.  The dining room can get loud due to the tables being so close, but my husband and I love it.  The patio is a great place if you are looking for outdoor dining."}
{"text":"I went to the Continental for lunch and ordered half a pepperoni pizza and half an Italian sausage pizza for $10.  The pizza was top notch!  It was truly outstanding.  The Italian sausage left a lot to be desired.  It wasn't as hot (temperature) as I would have liked.  I might have said something about it but my server was pretty slow.  He seemed sort of aloof and too cool to really take care of me.  There was another waitress there that seemed much friendlier.  I guess the luck of the draw worked against me this time.  I'll go back, but will hope for a different server.  I wish I could grant 3.5 stars.  I have faith that it's better than a three star so four stars it is."}
{"text":"After being seated, we waited 30 minutes before our waitress brought us water and menus. After taking our drink and meal orders, we proceeded to wait another 45 minutes for bread and our drinks. She comp'd our drinks and told us our food would be out shortly. 15 minutes later, we received 'meh' food.   They, were not especially busy, but we noticed most of the people around us were waiting significant amounts of time as well for service and food.   Overall, one of the worst restaurant experiences ever. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"I was impressed with the food and the service but my wife and young son were not as impressed.  I have been unhappy with the tomato paste many local resturants call sause and was surprised and happy to taste their robust sause.   If I combined my impression with my wife's we would be at 3.5 stars.  I was not put off by the price, the items were worth it."}
{"text":"Service was horrible, food was cold and bland. We went on a Thursday night and our food took an extremely long time to get. Once we got it, my pasta dish was cold and bland. The waitress asked if we wanted Parmesan for our dishes and by the time she got back I was almost done with my dish. On top of that, a refill on our water took multiple reminders and we didn't get the bill until 40 minutes after we were done eating. I don't know if this was an off night for the entire place (chef, waitress, wait staff, etc) but I will not be going back. There are so many other GREAT Italian restaurants (for price, taste, service)."}
{"text":"OK so the decor is great and the ambiance is great....and my company was beyond great! The food here was simple and good, it was simply not anything exceptional. My date had the polenta and I had the fettuccine alfredo with shrimp and while both were good they did not leave a great desire to go back and have them again. The service was very good and attentive, just enough attention when needed but not overbearing. Not sure I would go out of my way to go back."}
{"text":"I am a bit mixed on the continental and normally would rate it 4 stars, but give it 5 stars due to the best happy hour in madison. The entrees are a bit pricey and while good, not amazing (I got a steak, done up one of the special ways and enjoyed it). If I had money, I would probably eat there for dinner every now and then, but as a poor student with a baby, I rarely splurge.  However the happy hour is the best in town. Everything is 1/2 price from 4-6pm on weekdays. This includes drinks and the appetizers/pizzas. The pizzas are great. There is a wide range here. You have everything form a traditional pepperoni (which is a good pepperoni pizza) to a feta/spinach greek pizza. My two favorites are the buffalo chicken and the muffaletta pizza (but both are very different from \"normal\" pizza). The brie and walnut quesadilla is also a good appetizer.   In terms of drinks, their specialty drinks tend to be a little sweet/girly (emerald margarita which is a margarita with a shot of melon liquor/etc.) However they always have a (limited) selection of good beer on tap (always micros no coors/etc.) and can make you any traditional drink that you want.    While it says it isn't kid friendly, if you come during a slower week day night it can be. We brought our 4 month old to the restaurant (he's very well behaved). He did great and the patrons loved him (got a bit fussy at the end, but his grandma just paraded him around the restaurant/let the patrons interact with him and he was as happy as a clam). You can even sit/eat in the couch area of the bar which would be great if you had a younger child as as there is plenty of room for them to move around, color, play with action figures/whatever and not get in the way of other guests. Plus the bar area isn't exactly quiet (TV's, patron's chatting etc.). The outdoor area also rocks and likewise is kid friendly."}
{"text":"I have been to the Continental Fitchburg more than once - I don't know why I continued to give it so many chances to be good, because it never was.  I love that it is locally-owned, so I wanted to support it. The menu makes things sound fabulous - the problem is, nothing tastes as described.   One time I ordered the Salmon - it was literally one of the worst things I have ever eaten. I am not that picky, and I do not like being rude to the waitstaff or complaining. It tasted so disgusting, like the fish was rancid, that I had to send it back.  Another visit, I ordered crab cakes. If you want real crab cakes, I would suggest Ruth's Chris. These are deep-fried, breaded, excuses called \"crab cakes.\" They are not fresh and I would bet anything they came frozen from a box.  Yet another recent visit, myself and my boyfriend took another couple there. I suggested to everyone that they stay away from the seafood and order something that they \"couldn't possibly mess up\" - like a simple pasta dish. I was wrong!  The food is SO bland, flavorless, and the portions are much too large. I ordered the Eggplant Parmesan - out of everything everyone ordered, that was the best - but that is not saying much. A ton of pasta, bland tomato sauce, deep-fried eggplant (that I am convinced also came frozen from a box, based on the consistency of size and the type of breading), some mozz cheese. I had to add salt and pepper, which I rarely do. My boyfriend got Ravioli Alfredo - extremely bland. He was starving so he ate it anyway. The couple ordered Pesto Pasta - I never thought pesto could taste bland, but somehow it did here - and Fettucine Alfredo - also tasteless and bland. Not to mention we had to wait 20 minutes for bread and another 45 minutes or more for our meal.   It was a sign when a couple next to us was very upset and kept sending things back, as well as a table of 4 nearby.  Overall the service is not good. You have to wait VERY long, and things move very slowly.  The ambiance is nice...but when you come to a restaurant, you expect more than good looks. They don't have anything to back up their facade.  Do yourself a favor and try any of the other fabulous Italian restaurants Madison has to offer - Lombardino's is a local favorite. Tutto Pasta on State St. is also much better."}
{"text":"I think this restaurant is one of the few under-rated in Madison area. We're lucky to have such a culinary treat in Fitchburg. The ambiance is warm with a large dining area. Our service has always been noteworthy. The food is quite good, especially the appetizers. I've been trying to get there for happy hour, seems like a good deal. Try their desserts, they've all been phenomenal."}
{"text":"Great food and excellent happy hour (1/2 price hors d'ouevres and drinks 4-6 Mon-Fri).  They have an excellent pesto which we order with our bread basket.  They do fish and pasta extremely well; they're pizza could use more garlic and/or basil.  They're alcohol list is comprehensive, we love this place."}
{"text":"I took my girlfriend here for our Valentine's Day dinner. And I have to say that I am incredibly disappointed with this place.  The visit turned into an hour and a half ordeal that I don't ever wish to repeat. We ordered an appetizer of crab cakes, which were so-so. For our meals, I ordered the Lobster and Crab Fettuccine and my girlfriend ordered a 10 oz steak, medium. In all honesty, my dish was phenomenal.  It had large pieces of meat, the sauce was great, and the pasta was cooked nearly perfectly. However, my girlfriend cut halfway through her steak and it was barely cooked to rare. Our server was at our table and saw this and took it back to be cooked further.  So, we continued our meal and waited for the steak. When it came back out the large cut that my girlfriend had made still showed us that the steak was not medium. I had her cut into it more to see and the entire steak was now a perfect medium-rare. As our server did not verify that it was done properly, we had to wait for her to return to ask, once more, for a medium steak. After I finished my course, she returned to us and we explained the issue. She told us that we would get the steak on the house and that they would cook us a brand new one.  We waited roughly 20 minutes for this new steak, which we asked to have to go. When our server brought it out, I asked her for a knife so that we could check to see that it was done. While we waited for the knife, my girlfriend opened the to go box and looked at the steak. It was the same piece of meat that had been recooked twice before with her two original cuts in it. Though now it was well done, far past medium.  Once our server returned, we showed her the steak and I asked to speak with the manager. She went to talk to him about it. When she returned, she offered us a new steak. As we had been there for an hour and a half already, we weren't willing to wait another 20 minutes to get this steak. She also informed us that the manager, who was also Jim, the owner, did not have time to speak to us.  I took the initiative and went to the bar to seek him out directly. I explained the situation and reiterated that we were not taking the steak at all now. He immediately went on the defensive and repeatedly stated that he was already giving us the steak for free and didn't what else I wanted. I pointed out that we never received the steak, thus we should not be charged for it regardless. He offered a new steak again, to which I said that we had already accepted that offer and wasted 20 minutes waiting for the same steak to be recooked.  Throughout this conversation, he continued to get more and more belligerent. I even had to explain to him that I'm not angry and that I just wanted to know why this would happen. Clearly not wanting to deal with me any further, he took the bill and tore it up. All the while, I was only looking for some explanation and an apology for this horrible experience. I wanted to explain this to him, but his negative attitude and unfriendly demeanor made me decide to just let it go and leave. As I did so, he finally apologized.  It's really a shame too. Like I said, my dish was very good. Our server did a great job, with the one exception, and I felt bad for her by the time we left. I gave her all the cash I had for a tip, admittedly it wasn't much, but I needed to leave quite badly. It worries me a bit that every time she had went to tell the owner about the steak, she seemed almost frightened. When I asked her if I could go to the manager and talk to him myself, she started stuttering and looked very shocked. I even saw her moving very quickly away from him with her head down.  After 13 years working in restaurants and dealing with many types of owners and managers, I know what it's like to have an owner like that. They make for a tense environment and rarely get good results from their employees. In fact, all three of the owners that I worked for that were similar to Jim are now out of business.  I would suggest to avoid this place completely. Between the inconsistency of quality and the inability for them to resolve situations, you're better off going nearly anywhere else."}
{"text":"Personally, I follow the mantra of \"Mess up? 'Fess up and Dress up.\" In other words, when you make a mistake, admit to it and then go above and beyond to make reparations.   The Continental seems to follow a philosophy of: \"Mess up? Ignore the Problem\". Or perhaps, \"Mess up? The Damage Has Already Been Done, So Might As Well Continue Being Awful.\"   While vacationing with my parents in Madison I convinced them to try The Continental rather than go to Il Benvenuto's, simply because The Continental averaged one star more on Yelp and I loathe chain restaurants.  I was obligated to apologize for this by the time we left.  We were seated promptly, but more than 10 minutes after being seated, we still had not been approached by a server. No water, no bread, nothing. Several servers walked by and seemed to deliberately avoid looking in our direction. Another table was seated and got service before us. Finally, I got up and notified a server/hostess (I'm not sure which she was, truthfully). There was no apology, just an assurance that someone would be right with us. It was another 3 to 4 minutes before someone was right with us, complete with several awkward instances of different servers coming near and looking at our apparently challenging table of 3 and then walking away.   Our server finally came and perhaps tried to apologize via making a nonchalant joke about how they had unintentionally \"forgotten about\" us. He then continued to forget about us, coming by the table too infrequently and forgetting the basics when he did stop by. For example, my water glass - which was my only beverage since we were not served a wine & cocktail menu - was empty for two of his visits to the table before I finally asked him for more water on his 3rd visit. We had to ask for table bread. We had to point out that salads came with our meals. Service went on like this for the rest of the night.   The food was, as other reviews complain, completely bland. My mom and I got the fettuccine with lemon pesto and jumbo scallops, which is pan tossed in a lemon pesto sauce with zucchini & roasted red peppers. Doesn't that sound good? Well, it wasn't. I dumped loads of salt and pepper on this dish just to make it taste like *something*. I didn't taste the vegetables, not even the red peppers, and the scallops were rubbery. It was an oily, bland mess. Not even close to being worth the $19 price tag.   As far as I can tell, the only good thing this place has going for it is that they have just started to grow their own tomatoes and basil. Sadly, I doubt you'll be able to taste either of them.
