{"text":"Disappointed. Service was slow and my husband was not served what he ordered.  He got fried catfish and ordered grilled.  When they finally brought the grilled fish it was cold and much too salty. ....and I had already finished my salad (the salad was very underwhelming) They took the fish off the bill only after I asked to speak with the manager.  Manager apologized and gave us his card to dine next time.  However, I don't think we'll spend our time there again."}
{"text":"Very nice employees and will go out their way to make sure your happy with your order. Good is very Delicious we need it in Houston, tx ."}
{"text":"We came here after a bad experience at Stonetown
Very different 
We were greeted by a lovely hostess
The decorum and ambiance was nice
Old school music was pleasant 
Our server..I think her name was Stacy was friendly and prompt
The collard greens were every thing
I love that they use the Samsung tablet to accept payments 
Hope to go back very soon"}
{"text":"The decor is nice but that is the only thing that sticks out about this place.  

Service was horrible.  The only thing I can think of is our waiter was new or not trained well.  My daughter ordered from the kids menu and he had no idea they had a kids menu, he charged us for adult sides.  Our food came out before we had any napkins or utensils.  When i finally got him to bring us utensils, he only brought a fork.  Never came back after that.  We paid the bill and he didn't give me the change only the bills.  He was also the first waiter I've ever had that picked up his tip while we were still at the table. 

The food was OK.  The waffle was pretty good, but the chicken was extremely dry.  It took three minutes for our food to come out, so you know the food was just sitting in the back.  You can't even cook the bacon we ordered that quick.

Cleveland has too many good restaurants to visit this place again."}
{"text":"This place has the best waffles and some of the best chicken I have ever tasted. When we first Walked in it had a Funky smell. My family and I quickly got used to it.  We sat down and a young man quickly seated us and took our order. He was very kind. The down side was that it took about 30 minutes to get our food. It was SO worth the wait. This restaurant is very delicious. It was also located near our hotel."}
{"text":"Went here tired this place after a Cavs game, Decore and atmosphere looked pleasent. We were quickly seated that was the highlight of the experience. I ordered the fired chicken sandwich, my friend ordered the chicken waffle, our food was brought out, our food was served and looked delicious, yet we couldn't eat it cause we didn't have utensils. Nor, would we see our waiter again for 15 minutes. As I sat there looking at that food I contemplated more than once using my fingers to scoop the mac and cheese."}
{"text":"A+ Food, A++ Service (Thanks Ms. Bacon!) and absolutely BEAUTIFUL decor!!

Wanted some brunch in the city and this place was close and the only place open. Just from walking in, everything was impressive and with a definite eye for design.

FOOD: The person with me ordered the Monique's Love (chicken and waffles). I ordered the Rosemary Omelette with waffle with the Peach alcohol drink and a side order of Mac and Cheese. Unfortunately they were still cooking the Mac and Cheese but more on that later! 

My omelette was PHENOMENAL! They listened to my request to cook it 'well done' and it was LARGE. Not just a thin layer of egg, they really give you your money's worth. And the chicken was phenomenal, it really made me want to ask for a side order of chicken but y'know..trying to keep things a LITTLE light right? The waffle was exactly what I picture when I hear the phrase 'chicken and waffles' and by the time I was done I only wish I had more!

SERVICE: The Hostess was super nice (even told us where there was a parking meter that had a lot of time on it still) and our servers were perfect! They were fun and friendly and really made us feel comfortable and relaxed. When she informed me that the Mac and Cheese was not quite ready yet, she immediately told us that the second it was ready, we'd get an order to go. And it lived up to my expectations completely, cheesy and hot and honestly?

We just wanna go back to try more!"}
{"text":"We had to eat at the bar because the wait was over 1. The waffle was like eating an eggo except it was flatter.  The chicken was good not great. The fries that they served us were cold and felt like they had been sitting under a heat lamp. 

You eat off of a plastic plate. Which would be okay if I didn't pay like I was eating somewhere where you eat off of China 

The bartender ignored us and didnt refill our drinks. Yes we didn't have any alcohol but why does that matter. She was more focused on the other guests that actually had alcohol."}
{"text":"Food was outstanding. Best catfish sandwich I've had in a very long time. Top notch service."}
{"text":"My husband and I are from New York.  We were in Cleveland and we went to eat at Chicago House of Chicken and Waffle. We were greeted at the door with \"welcome to our house\". When you leave the restaurant that is exactly how you feel, like you just left the comfort of your own home. The decor is beautiful. The food is absolutely delicious. You have to try the peach cobble, DELICIOUS! heather at the bar made me one of the best \"hurricanes \". last but definitely not least the Owner TONYA and the rest of her staff was AMAZING!!!! We enjoyed ourselves so much we returned the following night before we returned home. LOVE LOVE LOVE this restaurant. We definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Great service from Ronnie.  Greeted immediately upon entering.  Beautiful decor.  Had chicken and waffle.  Chicken was delicious.  Waffle OK but everyone likes their waffles a certain way so no points against them for their version...which was thin and soft.  I will definitely return to try some other menu items."}
{"text":"WORST SERVICE I HAVE EVER RECIVED! First I tried to tell the waiter who was on what check,  he interrupted me and told me how he takes orders is, women first then men, (isnt that how most places do it even chucky chesse) funny cause I wasn't trying to order first. I was trying to tell him who was on what check. Then He did not even take all the ladys first. The waiter said he had to give us numbers so the food will come out to the right people, it did not come out to the right people. He kept asking us our numbers, which is funny because he gave them to us. He gave mist of us plates then poof he was helping other tables with out sayin where the last persons food was. Then about 10 minutes after everone else had there food he brought out the last persons food. when we then said we needed sauce for our fish we needed extra napkins and extra syrup for the waffles, the waiter told us we had to wait because he had to cash some other people out first. Thats nice we would all like to eat hot food. One of our party had to leave early and asked for her check and a bag. when he finaly come with the to-go container he in essence refused to cash out the person who had to leave early first. (Must go in order that he didnt remember) She finally just gave someone else the payment and receipt and have them pay so she could leave. All-around he was rude, condescending and every step of the way made things more difficult. the order process took an agonizing amount of time. The food delivery was messed up(one persons food came out 10  minutes after the rest). Cashing out was a nightmare. I would never go back, even for a free meal. There's so much more i dont think the waiter did one thing correct but, This is long enough. 

  Now the good,  The food came out very quick and it was edible."}
{"text":"I have never in my life been treated so disrespectfully.  Called in the morning to request a reservation for a group of seven..  A young lady stated that it wasn't busy so we can be accommodated.  I explained that we would be in at 2pm, she then stated well we can be sure to hold a table for you.  We get there and the hostesses states that it's an hour wait and the conversation discussed that morning is incorrect because they don't take reservations.

She then states that they have a private room that can be held anytime with a deposit.  I then stated that we can wait an hour.  I just want to know your protocol.  When patrons call requesting reservations do you then inform them about the private room.   Because that'll would've been great in our situation.  She then becomes loud and rude stating that she doesn't know who I talked to but it wasn't her.  

2 hours have now gone by.  I then ask if she knows about how much longer the wait may be.  She proceeds to say didn't I tell you that we have to wait for that table over there.  I then say Miss I'm just wondering if you can give me a range of time. She says, well I can't tell them to get up.  

The manager never took charge.  He stated that the hostess is his cousin.  He never tried to assist with the situation.  It's my moms birthday and we wanted to try this place.  My fianc√© also wanted me to try this place to ensure they'd be great as a caterer for our wedding.  I will not be back and of course I won't be calling them to cater our special day."}
{"text":"Very personable establishment like your at home . Ambiance was nice , nice chill spot to sit back enjoy food and sip drinks slowly .

Food was excellent and fresh not overcooked or excessively greasy . Yams were good with a hint of smoke taste . Chicken was fresh and not to much breading , grilled thighs were good . Catfish was done well . Red beans and rice were just right . Waffles were excellent . Peach cobbler excellent . 

The drinks were on point . Bar manager was nice and willing to introduce some new things or make your favorite . Try the cider pear with a shot of tequila is was he introduced me to since I wanted something different. Good bourbons there and variety of cocktails .

Live jazz band Friday and Saturday not to loud or soft but compliments your meal to groove and relax 

Have visit this restaurant twice and will be back for more food and breakfast next round . 

Owner Darnell and his wife has done a good job thus far . Worth checking it out even for a drink"}
{"text":"An hour and a half later, cold dry chicken and a thin, eggo-like waffle. The place seemed to have enough employees, but it seemed poorly managed. The one positive is the decor has a clean, modern design. The decor, however, does make up for the poor service and overpriced food ($5.50 for one, thin waffle). We asked a guy, who I assume is a manager, to warm up a plate of biscuits and gravy. He never came back. I felt bad for the sever who was overwhelmed with her tables. I really wish this place was better."}
{"text":"Great waffles...if you like them limp and soggy served with no butter, no syrup and without the strawberry topping that was ordered. Staff is rude and more than a little condescending."}
{"text":"The owner Tonya and her husband Darnell are AMAZING!!! I visited every restaurant they opened and they just keep getting better and better. The Cleveland restaurant is absolutely STUNNING!!! We loved the light fixtures and color scheme. The greeting by the Hostess was warm and inviting. Every meal we enjoyed had a variety of options and was flavorful, especially the chicken. It was seasoned just right. Also, we thought the prices was very reasonable for a downtown restaurant and for the very \"Unique\" experience. We will definitely be back to enjoy the live band and bar on the weekend. Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I came here 12/30/2017 with another couple. The atmosphere was nice and the food, well how do I describe perfection. I order the Kev's N' Jens (smothered is a must for an extra dollar) with a side of cheese grits. I also ordered a side of waffles. The chicken was very juicy and crispy. The grits were some of the best I have ever had and I was raised in Florida so I know grits. Timothy was our waiter and he was great. He was very attentive but not over the top. I will return and have already told everyone about this gem."}
{"text":"The place is very cool. From when you walk in you feel the vibe. The decor is very nice. You feel at home from the moment you sit down. The music is nice and the service was excellent. 

The food......where to start. I am full. I had the Catfish and waffles and the catfish was very good. I also had eggs and grits. Ouch. Too much food. Lol. But it was all delivered quick and it was good. 

I will be back here on my next trip. Now I have to go walk this food off."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful dining experience at Chicago's Home of Chicken & Waffles.  Being my first time there, I had to order the chicken and waffles, though there were plenty other tempting selections to choose from on their impressive menu.  I ordered a side dish of collard greens to go with my meal and they were down-home good.  Finally, the staff in the restaurant was warm and friendly.  I highly recommend Chicago's Home of Chicken and Waffles to anyone who loves good cooking!"}
{"text":"Wow... I have been bamboozled ladies and gents! So here's the deal... my daughter and her boyfriend decided to dine here for the evening so of course she asked if I wanted takeout. I normally only get sides from soul food places because I don't eat meat but I decided to indulge in a wing or 2 to see what the hype was about. Omgsh terrible! I opened the box only to find 2 wings that they had the audacity to charge me $2.95 each for!! Wait whaaaaat? I ordered yams to go with the 2 underdeveloped wings and for a whopping $4.75 I received what was the equivalent of a toddler portion and they weren't even tasty! But anywhoo, let's move on to hubby's meal, he ordered a chicken breast, waffle and side of Mac & cheese. Again $4.75 for a toddler portion and the waffle was terrible looking as well as tasting. It was flat and rubbery and nothing about it screamed hey I'm a meal worth $17! Maybe peeps are paying for the ambiance when they dine in, but why have a dope atmosphere with high prices and mediocre food? I'm so disappointed"}
{"text":"Solid place. Could be a whole lot better. Looks great inside but there service and ambiance needs legit work. The food was solid as well. It's a gem if they get it together."}
{"text":"Wonderful! The food was delicious and the service was better than I could have imagined! Complimentary champagne and a kind server brought us free ice cream for the kids! We will definitely be back and will recommend to others!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty disappointing. We visited on a Friday a few weeks ago. I realize they just opened, but it feels like they were drastically underprepared. The ambience and atmosphere are top notch - great decor and the jazz band in the background was awesome. 

The food was mediocre though, and the operations were downright poor. My friend ordered a long island mule that was gross and I ordered a martini, but they were out of olives! By the way, the martini was a featured drink on the menu, so it's not like my order was out of nowhere. They had a nice selection of beers on the menu, but they only actually had probably half of them available. (Again, poor operations.) 

As for the food, the chicken was OK - not bad, but not as good as you'd expect from a place called \"Chicken and Waffles\" - good taste, but pretty dry. The waffle was a flop - literally, no crispness at all. Again, OK taste on it,  just poorly prepared (note: just let the waffle iron get hot first guys - it's simple!) The sides (biscuit, red beans and rice) were bad - clearly not home-made on either. 

The bartender was a nice guy and did his best. The manager (I think?) spent his entire evening walking around chatting with the guests. He tried to sell us on reserving the main table for any events we have planned. That was a turn off, considering this place could be good if they got their operations in order. My recommendation: hire a good Ops manager to get things straightened out now. Lots of potential, but needs a lot of work."}
{"text":"The menu looks intriguing and they validate parking for $5 so we decided to try it. We waited at the front for about 5 minutes before anyone offered to seat us, once they finally did the staff was really nice. Note you cannot substitute anything but you can buy extra sides if you like .. which to me is annoying but we dealt. The wings were not hot but room temperature, like they had been sitting under a warmer for a while, the greens tasted as though they were canned, and the waffles were chewy as though they were not cooked completely. All in all the staff, though slow, were really nice but the food wasn't worth the $40 spent."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was amazing during our dinner and the way the dining was set up it provided the intimacy needed to enjoy my dinner partner. The waiter was excellent with her knowledge of the menu and her suggestions helped make a great choice in food selection. The meal was very appetizing and enjoyable. The star that fell short was due to their being a 
Small gnat that ruined our drinks because it kept flying inside the cup. Maybe increasing the air condition circulation may solve that issue also the stall in the bathroom was very small and difficult to maneuver and use."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the chicken n waffle there syrup is the shit!!! customer service is excellent as well no complaints from me as of yet"}
{"text":"Finally! A good chicken and waffles place near the Quicken loans arena and Playhouse. 

Wondered here before a cavs weekday game and left very satisfied. The decor is very modern. I ordered tonya's choice and went with the breast and wing, spicy maple syrup and a waffle as the side, but the rice and beans and mac n cheese also looked delicious. The food came quick, was perfectly cooked and hit the spot. The people next to me were raving about their catfish, which I might try next time.

Happy hour food specials and drinks are reasonable. Drink-wise, I had a dark and stormy and a hurracaine, both prepared correctly, which is rare these days. The bartender, Jerry, went above and beyond on the service. 

I will definitely be back for the catfish and mac n cheese, maybe even the veggie skillet. It is hard to find a good soul food place like this in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Love the food was amazing the atmosphere was perfect the live band is just an added bonus would highly recommend anyone to come here for an enjoyable night out."}
{"text":"Went here with a work group and we all left happy and full! The majority of us got the Aunt Joyce's because it seemed like a nice classic chicken and waffles dish. Came with two pieces of fried chicken, one waffle, eggs and grits. There is something about a combination of salty, sweet and spicy that is a winner for me. They also have Louisiana hot sauce which is. big bonus for me!  The restaurant was clean, nice decor and great staff!  Would love to come back and check out the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Good food, good people good service. They want you to be satisfied. If something isn't right tell them. Tonya is the owner and very personable. Even though I'm sure she was very busy. Aaron is a great waiter. Very attentive. The design and decor is fabulous, contemporary. Will visit for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Outstanding design and staff. I stopped in just to grab a quick bite of food while my daughter hing with friends. Service was 10/10 and the interior space is beautiful. Very relaxing place, Ill be going back again soon."}
{"text":"Great addition to cleveland's restaurant scene. Very attentive staff, the food is great, nice ambience and interiors. We had a little of everything.. the chicken was crispy on the outside, tender inside. Greens were nice and salty, Mac and cheese was was deliciously savory (not the dripping in cheese variety), yummy catfish. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this new restaurant but was thoroughly disappointed.

We ordered our food for 3 for delivery and everything came in 1 bag. Even though this sounds like a whiny complaint, this forced all the food to be sloppy, leak from containers, and blend with other foods they shouldn't have blended with.

Presentation is key people.

Next, when dispersing the food, we noticed our order was wrong, and the food we ordered was not delivered.

There is nothing more frustrating than paying for something and not getting it.

Finally the taste of the food, this is where they actually scored points. We had chicken, waffles, catfish, yams, and collard greens. The chicken was so crunchy on the outside I couldn't get enough! But this was the only part of the full meal that exceptionally stood out."}
{"text":"I was there for a birthday party. The food was excellent and so was our waitress Jessica Bacon. She was very attentive to our needs"}
{"text":"Take out. Nothing taste bad nothing tastes exceptional. Of course they forgot the cornbread. I swear it seems like most places I go to it seems like I'm their first customer. How hard is it to get a simple order right?! I called about the cornbread (and though not rude) she just said I could come back and get it. No apologies or anything. In these cases restaurants needs to apologize AND offer you two of what was forgotten or $5 off your next meal...a free dessert or something! That is an inconvenience for your customer so do something EXTRA to compensate for the drive back for YOUR error! Maybe after honoring 20 mistakes with extras in a week then maybe they'll be more careful in getting orders right in the first place. *That goes for all restaurants. 

Way over priced in my opinion. I ordered the 3 piece wing dinner *NO CORNBREAD with 3 sides plus a side of potato salad...which was $5 for a full portion of an ice cream scoop. And it came to just over $22! That is way too high for 3 pieces of chicken and four sides! The food was ok but forgetting the cornbread and mostly the price don't think I will frequent here.

OH WAIT! I'M JUST SEEING 2 DAYS LATER THAT THE PERSON THAT RANG UP MY TO GO ORDER ADDED A $2 TIP ONTO MY CREDIT CARD THAT I DID NOT AUTHORIZE! (I do not usually tip on to go orders. Waiter is not truly serving you in my opinion. And I waited tables for years at several places in my late teens early 20's and still feel that way.) THAT'S A SERIOUS PROBLEM NOW! I WILL NEVET GO BACK HERE NOW!

3rd entry. Though I can't change above because that all stands, a little pricey, forgot cornbread and waitress charged my card more than I signed for which is a huge no no!
I spoke to manager Monet today about everything and she was MORE THAN APOLOGETIC, FRIENDLY, PERSONABLE AND PROFESSIONAL about everything!! Really great customer service!! And she assured me that waitress A. S. will 
be dealt with! That is NOT ok to add what you want to a customer's credit card ever, that's stealing!! 
Ok people are human and someone forgot the cornbread for the take out, so I can overlook that but it still is a bummer when your order isn't right anywhere you go so I just suggest taking the time to get -to go-orders right. Mistakes in the restaurant can be quickly remedied. Also a suggestion, it would be nice for more wet food items like greens and yams that those items are put in secured containers with lids...things spill in route.
In closing manager Monet was SO kind and professional that I do change my tune about not going back. I would go back and take a friend or family member. Things happen with businesses but how you are treated about those incidents makes a huge difference on rather you will return or not and Monet did a great job in making me happy! Thanks again!"}
{"text":"In the center of foodie-town, Cleveland, is Chicago's Home of Chicken & Waffles on Prospect Avenue.  Think back on those scratch-made C & Ws with butter and syrup, remember that succulent grilled catfish you had years ago in a small town, smell the brothy-steam from fresh collared greens - oh yeah, chef has it going on.  Now add to your experience social and cordial sommelier and mixologist, Steven, who'll serve you the way you wish you were served everywhere.  CHC&W is a must-go-to for foodies or those that wish to be served right or people that just want to chill with other good people."}
{"text":"I have a love/hate relationship going on with this place. They seem to have worked through the problem of consistency, the last 4 times I've gone the food and service has been amazing. Still having issues with timing the food comes out hot & fresh just not all at the same time. 

As a recently converted vegetarian I love Eric's veggie skillet & a pecan waffle. If you drink have a hurricane. The chicken is hot, juicy, crisp & delicious, I remember. Plan to spend some time in this place. The fried waffle is sinful."}
{"text":"I will start this by saying the place is  nice but when I came in and tried to get a table nobody greeted me. The security guard came to and greeted me and the was sad. I was standing around for 30mins before someone asked me if I had be taken of. After being seated the food came pretty fast but it was cold and my girlfriend had to sent it back. As far as the taste of the food it was nothing to write home about and no I will not be returning. I had the baked chicken and rice and I was ok and my girlfriend had the chicken and waffles and she hated them. I'm from this city so I gave everybody two changes at least but this was so bad I can't."}
{"text":"This place is fabulous! The waffles were made to order and the chicken was the best. Chicken was not dry or oozing with grease. It was tender and the skin easy to peel back. The flavored tea was also a great surprise, sweet tea always wins the day. However, I experienced a huge mixup when I received the bill. The waiter, as gracious as you can imagine, gave me the bill for another table. I did not pay to much attention because when I first looked at it I had my bill. Then after about half an hour later he came over in a panic saying we didn't pay. I could not believe what he was saying. After a few minutes later and the manager getting involved we discovered what happened. The manager gave the option of cash back or gift certificate. I chose the certificate as I understood her position. She was great and it was a great time. Check it out, taste the food, enjoy the atmosphere, and listen to the band on the weekends."}
{"text":"Great place to eat and feel comfortable in downtown Cleveland. I was impressed with the staff and Waffle I ordered. I will be back for dinner when I visit Cleveland again."}
{"text":"The service was fantastic and the meal was absolutely excellent. Felt like a high class place with ideal home-cooked food. Extremely affordable for portion size."}
{"text":"Terrible service, told us they were closed when door and website and cooks said that they were open for another hour. Refused and confronted by owners cousin. Highly recommend staying away, terrible service/leadership."}
{"text":"3.5 with a round up for ambiance. I've come here twice so far - once during their soft opening for dinner and then once for lunch a few weeks later. I love their focus on hospitality - they greet you with a \"welcome to our home!\" which is wonderful. We chatted with the host and they are from Bronzeville in Chicago! Welcome to Cleveland. :)

The decor is on point - very clean modern lines with interesting light fixtures. I definitely enjoyed the vibe. 

Dinner was great - I got the chicken and waffles with a side of greens and fried gizzards. The fried gizzards were definitely plentiful - they give you a pretty shareable, huge plate. What was somewhat puzzling was how small the side of greens was in comparison. You get a pretty small helping for $4. For chicken, I definitely recommend the thigh. Both the chicken and waffle were crispy. 

When I came for lunch, there was a difference in consistency. I got chicken and waffles, this time chicken breast. The breast was really dry and the breading wasn't crispy. We also got some sweet potato sides and they didn't taste quite right. They were very gracious and brought us an extra side of mac and cheese to make up for it.

Overall, service was great. During the soft opening, our waiter was almost overeager, checking in with us 1-2 more times than necessary. That didn't bother us too much, and I also appreciated how they brought over an extra side when my friend wasn't happy with her dish. I'd like them to be successful here in Cleveland on Prospect - hopefully they can work out their consistency issues."}
{"text":"The first thing you notice when you walk in if you've never been there before is how much larger the space is than it looks from the outside. The interior is new and looks great, completely unexpected. I was expecting a diner kind of feel and what I got was a trendy restaurant vibe.

The staff was fantastic, the staff impressed me. Most of their menu consisted on chicken and waffles and then the occassional catfish is what I mainly remember. Myself and my 3 coworkers went here not knowing what to expect, we all got some combination of the chicken and waffles. The maple syrup was great, the chicken was good. But at the end, we all left feeling like we just spent close to $20 each for two pieces of chicken and two waffles. My lunch was definitely not worth the $18 I paid for it. Next time i'll grab some leggo my eggos and head over to KFC."}
{"text":"The Chicken and the catfish are to die for! Visited for Sunday brunch with my mother and we got the Kisha's Creation and Monique's Love. I'm from Pensacola, Florida and their fried chicken and catfish gives the south a run for their money. I'd definitely come here again. 

Our waiter, Leonard, was very helpful. He was more than willing to help us decide what to order and even recommend some local restaurants and attractions we might want to check out while we were in town.

My only complaint and reason I wouldn't give 5 stars is that the service was pretty slow. Granted, we did come on a Sunday after church let out and on a graduation weekend. Though my catfish took over 45 minutes to come out even after my mom's chicken and waffles were served. 

Overall, great food, though I wouldn't come here if you're in a rush."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by a native who suggested that we meet here around 7:30pm Saturday night. Once we arrived, we were met by a small crowd waiting to be seated.  He hostess showed us were the ladies room was and she disappeared into the crowd.  We waited and waited for her to return to add our names list.  Another patron who was waiting to be seated ventured to the back and notified staff that there was a crowd waiting to be seated. There were some people occupying the bar not drinking. Once the hostess returned, didn't know where \"they\" put her list so she was off again.  Two seats finally became available at the bar after like 40 minutes of waiting. We only waited because we were meeting a friend we hadn't seen in over 10 years. Once we were able to glance over the bar's food menu, very limited, our table became available. Our waitress appeared not long after. To her credit, there were several large parties there.  I'll skip ahead to the food. I ordered the grilled catfish, mac and cheese, yams and Cajun red beans and rice. The cat fish was okay, the mac and cheese was uneventful and the yams were too sweet. The meal was to come with cornbread but it was sold out so we got hockey pucks instead until the cornmeal oops bread came. Atmosphere is nice as is the price but skip this place."}
{"text":"Interior is great along with the service. There's a lot to choose from, but the food was either cold or dry. I came back a couple days later hoping that I just came in on a bad day but the food was still the same. However, their peach cobbler is pretty good."}
{"text":"The service was not great. The food was not fresh. The waffle was out the toaster, cold, no crispness, my butter didn't even melt. I wanted to like this place but I just could not. The waitress was truthful did not taste most of their food, even told us what not to eat. I wish she had told me about that super dry super plain chicken that Open Pit makes better. I will not be going back to place place, it is very overpriced, Applebee's is a better option. This place is very nice but way to many chairs seems to crowded when even walking to the bathroom with the slippery floor (be careful)."}
{"text":"I had great expectations for this restaurant. When a place has chicken and waffles in their name you expect that they will be great. This particular case the waffles were tuff and the chicken was not fresh even though the waitress said other wise.  This could of been a off night for the chicken and waffles however. My wife had the grilled catfish and it was excellent. The restaurant has great ambiance and style. On the weekends they have a live band that plays. We won't let this one experience stop us from trying it again though."}
{"text":"Food was ok, but some of the worst service I have ever had. Waitress brought one refill the whole time we were there. She had to be reminded to serve us by a manager. Wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"(Update) After what Tonya wrote and a chance to visit the business again I gave it another shot. Much better chicken. Very crispy and juicy. The staff were super friendly too. So I modifying my review. Last visit was a 2, this time a 4, so I bumped the stars to 3. 

(Old review) Obviously there are some consistancy problems with this place... from 1 star to 5 depending on what you read. I grew up in the south and I have had more fried chicken than probably any other meals. This places chicken is not that great and I think I can make better waffles in my wafflemaker at home with Krustez and a tablespoon of vanilla. I am just confounded how people can say this is great chicken unless they have a limited pallet or they are friends of the business. It is not the worst I have had, bit it is a long way from even gas station fried chicken in the south.

And get rid of the iPads. It is just a lazy company practice."}
{"text":"The ambiance is beatiful but... the service is slow. The waffles were more like eggo waffles than homemade waffles. This was my second time coming so I thought my second experience would be better but it was worse. Try Zanibar for a true southern comfort restaurant. The food is better and the menu has a more variety of flavors. On a positive note, the location is convenient and the bands on Friday nights are entertaining. The specialty drinks were good too"}
{"text":"We decided to visit this restaurant for a New Years brunch. The decor is beautiful, but the service is absolutely horrible.

When we arrived, there was no one at the hostess station. One of the staff mentioned to us on our way to our table that there was a 45 - 60 min wait for food. This seemed long for breakfast food, but we had a large party and figured we could drink while we waited.

Once seated, we quickly saw how disjointed the staff was. Our server was a sweet girl. She genuinely tried her best to make our experience pleasant. Waitresses at this restaurant use tablets to place orders. We saw her enter everything, yet our food came out wrong and food was staggered (last person got their food 30 mins after the first plate was brought to our table). Mimosas were served warm. When our waitress kindly asked the hostess to assist her with something, the hostess snapped at her in front of us. 

Even more astonishing, the establishment doesn't allow large parties to get multiple receipts or pay with multiple methods (bill can only be split into 2 receipts). I don't understand this. We also found out (the hard way), they don't accept American Express. When we tried to pay and our card was denied, we asked our waitress to verify if they accepted AmEx. She asked another server, and they told her they did but the system was glitchy. After several additional unsuccessful attempts to pay, our server asked the manager again about AmEx. The server told us they didn't because an investor hadn't signed the AmEx agreement for merchant fees! Why would you tell us this was the reason! How unprofessional!!!

Hopefully service will get better since this is a new restaurant, but I doubt it. The manager seemed to have an ego and was unconcerned with improving our experience to ensure we come back."}
{"text":"First time eating at this establishment let me tell you the food was BOMB. Comforting soul food. The atmosphere was phenomenal clean and comfortable. My waitress Tay was so knowledgeable, and sweet love her. All the waitresses were nice. They have giant projector screens which was cool. Nice music, they even set up a band. My overall experience was wonderful but one thing it's parking right next to the restaurant when I first arrived it was a sign that said parking was 5 dollars but their was no attendant so when I was walking back to my car it was a man standing by the sign collecting money for people coming in I think he was janky but other than that I enjoyed myself. They are kid friendly too."}
{"text":"Scene: 4 stars, Service: 4 stars, Food: 4 stars. I'm visiting Cleveland for the weekend and joined a few of my native Cleveland girlfriends for Sunday brunch. Of course I read the reviews and was concerned about the 3-star rating. So here's my take; the restaurant front and signage is modern and a good representation of the interior. The interior has a contemporary flair and I loved the original art that adorned the walls. The hostess who greeted me could've given off a warmer vibe and but it was fine; seemed like she just needed to settle into her role. Our party of six was seated within 10min. Once we were seated, our waitress promptly greeted us and brought most of our drinks. My girlfriend ordered a hurricane which took at least 15min to come out but she enjoyed it once it finally arrived. Our food took at least 35 minutes to come out. I really recommend they offer cornbread or biscuits if they anticipate long wait times for food- it's only fair. Fast forward, four people in our party ordered the chicken and waffle, two ordered the mac and cheese, and I ordered the fish and waffle. And bayyybeee...my food was bangin' (that means yummy (:-))!!! The catfish was steaming hot and crispy on the outside and perfectly flaky on the inside and the waffle was also very right. My 7 year-old son loved his chicken and waffles so much I had to force him to come up for air.  Overall, my experience was good. Once they work out a few kinks in the service I expect to give them 5 stars. I will definitely return next time I visit Cleveland and would highly recommend my fellow Yelpers give this place a shot. Cheers!"}
{"text":"My family and I enjoyed our food and the lovely service we received on yesterday 7/29/2017.  We enjoyed live music and complimentary champagne."}
{"text":"First visit and this place is definitely a five star. The atmosphere and decor is very nice. The service is outstanding and the food comes out very quickly. They have a nice big menu of all sorts of southern fare. 

We ordered fried gizzards and livers. The portion size was enough for four people. And they were fresh and seasoned well. We also tried their fried chicken and waffles. The chicken was flavorfull and crispy. The cool part was the waffles, you can have them plain or you can add stuff to them or top them with nuts, fruits and drizzles. We had ours with pecans in them and topped with bananas. Amazing! We also tried their collard greens and mac n cheese. The greens were nice and tender and the taste was fantastic. The mac n cheese had great flavor, very cheesy but for me the noodles were slightly over cooked. Also tried their fried catfish, the cornmeal crust was nice and crunchy and it also had great seasoning. Over all great experience, and fantastic food along with friendly service. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"If your standard for Chicken and Waffles in Cleveland is Phil the Fire, then you will likely be a touch disappointed with Chicago's Home. If you're willing to give them a pass on a flavorful, but somewhat spongy waffle, then this could be your replacement. The chicken is excellent, the catfish is crispy on the outside and moist inside and the collard greens are great. Sweet mashed yams are likewise very good, but the Mac-n-Cheese is somewhat flat and uneventful. 

Couple the food with a friendly atmosphere and beautiful surroundings and you have a place that will delight more than disappoint."}
{"text":"This is my second and LAST TIME coming here!!!! I came when they 1st opened up OVER 1 YEAR AGO! Now today I ordered take out and was told my food would be ready at 11:15 am and my food didn't get done until 10 minutes to 12pm. Never again will I waste my time in this establishment!!!"}
{"text":"Food was awesome! I recommend you try the potato salad .. restaurant was super clean and the service was great! definitely on my list of places to eat when I visit Cleveland again."}
{"text":"Foods really good, service was a little. They did have a large group also dining at the same time as us so I going to assume that  was the reason for the okay service. We had the chicken and waffles, the chicken was great the waffle was okay. They do however need better knifes, hard to cut the damn waffle lol"}
{"text":"Went there....it smelled like mop water next to our table in the very back nearest restroom. Food took an hour to serve, food was very bland, waitress way of saying \"sure I'll be right out with your order\" turned into a \"OK I GOTCHU!\" Drinks are good, Long Island ice tea was perfect. Chairs are weak felt like your ass would touch the floor....very cheap and rickety. Overall experience wasn't good. Never going back....unless I'm ordering a drink at their mini bar."}
{"text":"Best chicken & waffles I've had in the Cleveland area, hands down, and I've sampled quite a few of the west side options.  The waffles are big and soft and home made (more like pancakes than eggos, and that's not a bad thing).  The chicken is juicy and tender with a good amount of crunch on the outside.  My drumstick was gigantic, it almost looked like a turkey leg.  Syrup came on the side, as it should.  The service was very friendly and welcoming.  The food came up fairly quickly and we were able to get back to the office in good time.  The food is a little pricey but I felt the price was completely justified (especially considering all restaurants downtown cost a bit more).  This place is going to become a once-a-week treat for me from now on, I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Excellent!! Our server and breakfast was great.  He surprised our son on his Birthday with a special dessert. Everything about this place is right!"}
{"text":"I wish I had a better review but unfortunately don't. The place is beautiful but the service is much to be desired. During our first visit we were not greeted but lucked up with a spot at the bar, no biggie as we were a party of 2 and typically want to be close to the booze. The bartenders made eye contact but never approached us until about 10mins after sitting. We were asked what we wanted but no menus the bartended went to get some and then walked away. Another 5 minutes she came back and we ordered mimosas and water but they were out of champagne. She didn't offer an alternative or information about what their specials were so i backed out and got a water too. My husband and I were taken back by the decor but it was obvious the bartender was either having a bad day or didn't want to be there. Looking around nobody at the bar had drinks or food. I even overheard someone ask about their order and it turned out it was never inputted into the system! Finally, after getting our waters a few minutes later the bartender pulls a bottle of champagne out and starts pouring. I was shocked never did she ask me if I still wanted a mimosa or that it was replenished. It was as if she just didnt want to make drinks. I looove breafast food and was hoping for a better experience considering it was new and beautiful inside, however, its the service that makes the difference. We ended up going to Southside in Tremont instead."}
{"text":"I made a visit to this establishment while in Cleveland. I was in Cleveland celebrating my son 13th bday, we went to the cavs game and explored Cleveland .. etc.... it was the last day of our visit and two hours before our flight departed, but I wanted to visit a restaurant to eat and celebrate my sons birthday , so I found this place on yelp and I called them to inform them we have a large party and my daughter that is disabled . The employee over the phone said , no problem, we will have you all sit comfortably in the front , and when we arrived that what Happened ... the place is amazingly decorated , the bar is in the front , they have large televisions and a fire place area with a couch I believe , the cysteine service experience was top notch and the food was great ! My family had chicken and waffles and they said it was great! I had smothered chicken with grits and it was amazing !

The ambiance was just amazing , the lighting and the lighting fixtures decorated the place nice ! Just an overall amazing experience , I recommend you visit !"}
{"text":"Not sure where all these posts with amazing food comes from. The food was bland, boring, and quite terrible. I had the chicken and waffle. The waffle was soggy, and quite pathetic. The chicken was good, crispy, but had zero seasoning. My friend ordered the potato salad, which she did say was good, and the biscuits and gravy. What a sorry excuse for biscuits and gravy those were. The sauce needed to be thicker, and they needed wayyyy more of it. We ordered takeout, so I can't say much about service, but the hostess was rude on phone. Will definitely not be returning here ever."}
{"text":"I ordered from here for lunch for the first time today - I've been wanting to try them since they opened. I wish I saved my money. I ordered the fried chicken sandwich, with a side of potato salad and corn bread. Corn bread is so so.. Potato salad is pretty decent (the only redeeming item from the whole order), but this chicken... this is the driest chicken I've ever tasted - it's not even edible. You would think chicken being one of their main specialties they would know how to cook it so it doesn't taste like a brick. I won't be eating their food again."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service and unprofessional staff. Over priced food since the quality is equivalent to Bob Evans. You can find better soul food with better service elsewhere on Yelp or Google."}
{"text":"Friends and I decided to come here for a neo-soul brunch event that was hosted by Chicago Chicken and Waffle.  The location of the restaurant is on a busy street with only valet or street parking and can be missed pretty easily. There was a Indians game going on that day and I passed the restaurant a few times before realizing where it was. It's a very trendy restaurant. Cool modern seating, fancy bar, large flat screen TVs. There was even a live DJ. This particular day was fairly crowded and a bit loud but we were promptly seated.  The event included complimentary mimosas that were ok. I don't like my mimosas warm. Our table ordered a Veggie Skillet, chicken and waffles and Mario's Catfish Sandwich. All the food came out fast and no one had any complaints. The menu has a variety of chicken and waffles you can try.  I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Great service, great food, great place and very nice staff! I was referred by hotel staff(Double Tree Hilton) and what a treat! Food was amazing and the portions are very generous. The prices are very low for the environment and quality of food. The manager was very attentive to all tables and to top it off..all of the ladies in my party received a rose from our waitress! We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"This place is so cute! My husband and I enjoyed the atmosphere, food, and the cocktails. If I'm ever in Cleveland again I will definitely pay them another visit."}
{"text":"Amazing decor and the service was great. I loved the atmosphere and will definitely be back. The food was cooked to perfection. Had the chicken and waffles and loved it. Wasn't impressed with the drink I had it was a iced tea lemonade combo. Next time I'll order a cocktail. This is a place I would recommend if you want soul food and a nice atmosphere. Great for family dinner, date night or girl's night out. There are several menu items I want to try so I'll certainly come back. The design was very impressive so you definitely want to take pictures in here. They validate parking so I was able to park across the street for $5 which was nice considering the baseball game was going on."}
{"text":"This location is Chic! 4 Of us visited from Mansfield/Columbus and it was amazing. Service was spectacular..the ambience was very nice. I cannot wait to try dinner and jazz..as well as another brunch trip"}
{"text":"I'm not certain how a waffle from Chicago should or shouldn't be but this place has waffles a lot like waffle house but less impressive-and I'm not a waffle house fan. I had catfish and it was so mushy once you got past the batter--it made my stomach turn.

I gave them 2 stars for having a live band."}
{"text":"I also wanted to love this place- but was soon disappointed when my food arrived.

My Ordered Chicken & Catfish combo 
Glass of Moscato 

Pros:
-Ambiance was absolutely stunning
-Hostess that greeted us was very friendly 
-Sunday about 4:30 waited to be seated was about 15 min.
- They sang happy birthday and I got a frozen slice of cheesecake. Even though it was frozen it was the thought that count 

Cons:
-My daughters chicken and waffles were warm on the verge of becoming cold 
-Shocked  the waffles were not Belgium 
-Greens came to the table unbelievably cold
-Catfish was not fresh, but a frozen cornmeal coated catfish. The coating easily came off the fish when I picked up a piece to eat. 
- Two chicken wings were over cooked and dry, one was completely undercooked, black and red inside with the bone still red.
-I never received my water with lemon
- Towards the back of the restaurant the tables were a little too close for comfort.
 
Resolution: 
-The waiter took my greens, they were warmed in the microwave and returned. 

-The owner gave me a new order of wings, 3 wings in place of the bad wings I received. The replacement order of wings which were warm, juicy and good. Too bad this was not my first order. 

I expected so much better from this place considering the fact that Cleveland has not had a chicken and waffle restaurant downtown in years. I was hoping for so much more from a place with \"chicken & waffle\" in its name. The meal I had was mediocre. 

If the catfish was fresh, the second order of wings were served first, the greens were warm the first time and our food was a little more flavorful I'd have a much better review."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place after eating at the one in Chicago. But unfortunately it was awful the waffle was like rubber and the chicken wings not cooked all the way. Family waited for there food over 2 hours it was so ridiculous. The staff needs help or it will not be around for long.."}
{"text":"Hello tonya im willing to give your restaurant a second chance if your willing to replace my previous bad meal is that possible its been a long time ive been waiting almost a year to get this resolved."}
{"text":"Oh my lord. I've found my new neighborhood go-to! Beautiful new restaurant tucked in the back of Playhouse Square on Prospect Ave. The decor is chic and trendy- LOVE the lighting fixtures. There's a cozy front area with a modern fireplace and huge screen TV. I can definitely see myself going there for a drink and watching a game. 
We sat at the bar and had a good chat with the friendly bartender. The food is so delicious. We got the chicken and waffles, beans, collard greens, and corn muffin (I swear I shared it all with someone!). Everything was tasty and well seasoned and the portions were good. 
I was a little disappointed that they didn't have a bunch of beers on their menu, but understood because they just opened the week before. 
Will definitely be coming back to check out the live band on the weekends."}
{"text":"One of the worst restaurants I've been too. Owner does not acknowledge or greet young adults at all. He has been very rude on more than one occasion to my friends and I because we were young but greeted all of his older customers. Very slow and food is hit or miss every time I have been. Our food came out at all different times and the sides came out first. My chicken was also very cold. Waitress gave our bill to someone else to give back to us when we were leaving. They also charge a 18% dine-in fee on a group of 3. Will not be back."}
{"text":"LOVED the food. Pecan waffles are delicious, my southern man loved his catfish.   Our waiter was very friendly although the service seemed a little on the slow side.  Make sure you have time to sit and enjoy the atmosphere and aren't in a rush.  Saw lots of take outs too which is always a good sign!  will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Came into town for the Cav's game and had brunch here the next day. This was our first visit and we were all very impressed. We ordered The Monique which is fried chicken breast and waffles. I added blueberry to my waffle. We also got regular and cheese grits. My boyfriend got a 5 egg omelet. Every single thing was extremely delicious. The coffee was very good as well. Our server overheard us talking about it being our birthdays and after we finished eating he surprised us with cheesecake! He had a beautiful singing voice and sang us Happy Birthday. The decor of the restaurant was beautiful! I love the lights. It was incredibly clean, very well run, attentive and friendly staff. They kept our table cleaned up throughout the meal which is rare these days. I highly recommend this place. We will be back when we're in the area again."}
{"text":"Pros:
-Delicious southern style food. We've been here a few times now and every time the food has been solid. I highly recommend the Darnell - 2 or 3 fried catfish filets with a waffle. Served with syrup. I was hesitant at first because \"fish and waffles\" just doesn't have the same ring as \"chicken and waffles\" but let me tell you...it's just as delicious. 
-Sides for days. There are soooo many sides to choose from. You could honestly make a whole meal from just sides. But if you are going to get a side, you should get the Mac and cheese. So cheesy and delicious. 
-Friendly service. The first time we went there, we stayed longer just because we were having such a great conversation with the manager. Very hospitable!

Cons:
-Scattered service (but disclaimer, we went on Mother's Day). I don't really think this is standard for their service, but it did feel like our service was a little all over the place/not sure who our actual waiter was. Again, it was the brunchiest holiday of the year so don't think this is typical!

Bottom Line:
Should be \"Cleveland's Home of Chicken and Waffles\"!"}
{"text":"I went to Chicago Waffle House last night. I ordered two Monique dinners To-Go.
I requested, the chicken, waffles  and French  Fries  for one of the dinners,  and the chicken, waffles, and the potato salad,  for the other  dinner.  When I arrived home, there was no French Fries, NOR was there any Waffles in either of the containers.  Charlene"}
{"text":"I've read through the reviews and listened to what friends had to say about it so I mixed feelings! I had to try it myself and first the decor is amazing. You can tell time and effort went into this place. 

I went on a Sunday evening so it wasn't busy at all, perfect time to go. Our server was super sweet just really slow and didn't check on us much. 

The food: 8/10. The cornbread isn't anything special and was dry, hard, and burnt. Other than that, the chicken was fried to perfection. The mac & cheese, greens, and yams was also a plus! The grilled catfish comes with grilled onions and peppers and seasoned just right.

I also wasn't a fan of the turkey burger sliders, the bun was hard, poorly put together, no flavor; pretty much waste of money. 

Overall, good food! I'd return for sure."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times before and thought it was really good. I wanted to bring my friend here and I really hyped it up. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed with the overall experience. He enjoyed his food, but he didn't have chicken and waffles - just chicken and some sides. Firstly, our food came quick. But it was meh. My waffle was sad and the chicken was OK. I had a side of red beans and rice, but they weren't great. I'm not sure how you mess up red beans and rice. Maybe the food had been sitting prepared for a while, which is maybe why our meal came out in 5 minutes? Whatever the reason it didn't taste \"fresh\".


The service wasn't great. It didn't seem too busy, but nobody greeted me. I stood there for a few minutes, which I didn't mind because I was a little early. However, a guy sitting at the bar texting or whatever was like \"oh hey has anyone helped you\". Super professional. The waitress was running around like a crazy person, which isn't a good thing. Slow down and collect yourself. She was a sweetheart, but frantic. She also never refilled our waters, which sucked because we didn't get our cocktails well until after we finished our food. 

We ordered two \"waffletinis\" for the novelty of them. I understand they're a dessert cocktail and a little complicated. But we ordered our food a little before 7 and didn't get them until 7:45-7:50. We had finished our food and sat there for about twenty minutes before we got our drinks. The server mentioned that she'd comp our drinks, which never happened so we paid for the whole thing. 

Really just not an all around great experience. If I'm spending 30$ for chicken and waffles and a drink, it better be damned good. I can make a couple stops at Popeyes and Waffle House and have better food and service for a fraction of the cost."}
{"text":"Stopped in solo and sat at the bar.  The smartly dressed Head Maitre D, Terry Taylor kindly introduced himself and explained the restaurant was his family's establishment.

Had Tonya's Special, a fried leg & thy smothered with a smooth & seasoned onion gravy accompanied by a blueberry waffle.  The chicken remained crispy even with the gravy smothering.  The chicken was fork tender and fantastic.

Had an opportunity to watch the management handle a dissatisfied customer who it appeared would have been dissatisfied if Jesus Christ had delivered her meal on a silver platter.  She griped about everything from the Cavs, the weather, her sister, her boyfriend, her momma...and then the food came out.  Despite her rapid fire nitpicking and complaints the manager was cool as can be, polite and simply took care her.  A total pro.

All in all a great place."}
{"text":"Juicy, hot fried chicken! Great soul food. Conveniently located downtown Cleveland. My husband loved that the greens were well seasoned without pork or red meat. Red beans and rice are tangy and flavorful. Be sure to go on Friday and Saturday evening for live music!"}
{"text":"I visited this place a couple times. It's not some place I stop at during lunch during work hours since the service is slow due to the fact they cook each meal fresh. I was disappointed as this last time. We went as a group and I did point out to the waiter that I had to leave early and would like to close up my check as soon as the meal is out. In my rush I signed his keyboard and forgot to include a tip. I apologize profusely and asked when he would be in tomorrow so I can stop by and give him his tip. I understand we all work hard for our money and I felt bad. He told me he is in the next day from 9 to 5. I promised I would be back the next day.  After explaining what I had done, a member of our group handed me $5 for his tip.   I stopped the waiter again, apologized again,  and explained that I was able to borrow some money from another person at our table  and handed him a $5 tip on what I thought was my $20 bill. As you can see in the photo my bill was not $20 as it already included his tip and the waiter failed to bring that to my attention the multiple times I apologized for not tipping him. The restaurant does not hire stupid people so I'm sure he knew what he was doing. I will not be back."}
{"text":"First visit to this relatively new place. Food and service were both outstanding. Also had a wonderful jazz quartet playing-- made for a really lovely atmosphere. I had chicken and waffles, my husband had catfish and waffles. We weren't sure what to except-- but the waffles were amazing. They were dense and flavorful. The chicken and fish were both fried, but light and not at all greasy (I was worried since I have a pretty sensitive stomach!). Service was so friendly- from the hostess to the wait staff to the manager who stopped by. Decor is definitely upscale club, not waffle/ diner. Definitely will be back again- it's a new favorite!"}
{"text":"Was visiting from out of town and visited this restaurant.  Our food was delicious. I had chicken and waffles ( chicken hot and crisp, waffles thin but flaky).  I also had a side of catfish and it was seasoned well and hot.  My husband also enjoyed his meal.  The ambiance in the restaurant was beautiful and the service pretty good.  I would highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"The food was quite good. I especially liked the grits and the waffles. Atmosphere was superb, and the staff was friendly. Definitely a good place for before a Playhouse Square show"}
{"text":"Chicken was delicious!  Didn't try the waffles today, but did have the sides of collard greens, Mac n cheese, and yams.  The greens and Mac n cheese were good, but I didn't care for the yams.  The hubby had the potato salad which he said was very good.  We were on a weekend getaway for our anniversary, and we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Really not good food. Beautiful setting. Wonderful ambiance.  Food was not good. I ordered waffles & home fries.  I received a waffle & waffle cut french fries. The fries were good, but not when I ordered.  When I told the waitress,  she explained how the kitchen made a mistake,  but made no effort to fix it. She was very nice, but seemed overwhelmed. Yet tge restaurant wasn't busy.  The waffles are not Belgium style. The flavor was great, but it was luke warm & not crispy. The people with me ordered a drink when they ordered food. The drinks didn't arrive until after the meal, & then the martini was made wrong.   Would not recommend."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to go to Cleveland after a butterfly release we did in honor of the loved ones we lost. We were so excited to check out this new place and are very disappointed. The server is great and friendly but it took a few minutes for someone to greet us and then it took 45 minutes for our food, that is still not here, and there are 6 tables here. Spoke to the manager and she was able to get our food. WORTH THE WAIT FOR THE FOOD! It sucked waiting BUT we enjoyed our meals. We will go back for sure just hope it doesn't take forever again!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in with coworkers on a business trip and all four of us enjoyed it.  Service could have been a bit more attentive but the food more then made up for it.  Ive been looking for good fried chicken and waffles since I left Texas years ago and I was very happy we went here.  If Im ever in Cleveland again I will be going right back here.
I dont know the servers name but it was commendable what he did the night we were there on April 11th.  Someones car outside was about to be towed and he was hustling around checking all the guests to see if it was there car.  He didnt have to do that and it showed a great care for his guests."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my food! I had the chicken dinner (white meat) with mac and cheese, rice and gravy, and yams. I am a mac and cheese lover but I didn't not enjoy the mac and cheese here, I had to send it back too much pepper. I also had a peach perfection (alcoholic beverage) that was delicious. When I come back to Cleveland this will be my first stop. 

I would recommend the rice and gravy, red beans and rice, and yams for your side. Oh and the chicken was so good and hot I appreciate that."}
{"text":"The overall gist? EXCELLENT food, horrific service.

My husband was very excited to try this place for brunch, so today we ventured downtown to check it out. This place has a kids menu, yet no high chairs or booster seats, so my one year old spent the meal  in a booth with us, being passed back and forth so each of us could eat. More on that later.

Our server sat us, and at first they appeared understaffed. Two servers and several food runners. We ordered coffee and water, but noticed other tables had mimosas, bloody mary's etc, and asked for a drink menu also. My coffee cup was dirty, and our server never came back to offer refills. There was nobody nearby to ask for a clean cup. 

He finally came to take our order and told us that it would be 20 minutes until more coffee was brewed (at 10:30 AM during Sunday brunch?), so my husband ordered a Hurricane. It never arrived. 

When our food came out, my husband's omelette was not the one he ordered, and we asked for the correct one. The food runner never came back, and the server never went to check on it. I ate quickly so I could hold the baby whenever my husband got his plate. I guess the lack of a high chair worked itself out within the lack of attention to detail? 15 minutes later, his order arrived minus the extra vegetables he ordered in it, that we were still charged for. 

I had the Evelyn omelette and it was amazing! Fluffy, bursting with fresh veggies, and accompanied by the most perfect waffle. We also grabbed a side of Mac n cheese, and agreed it was the best ever. My husband's chicken omelette was delicious, the chicken was utterly perfect. 

Around us, we watched the wait staff struggle to get correct orders for other tables. It seemed disorganized, despite the friendly staff and gorgeous decor. We agreed to just grab carry out from this place until their service issues straighten out. One tip? Don't refer to your patron as 'boss man'. It came across condescendingly after we politely accommodated the restaurant's multiple shortcomings. Two stars for the fantastic food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Service is excellent from the moment we walked in the door being greeted and sat immediately to the moment we sat down and had a few brunch drinks. The food came out in a timely manner, perfect temperature and amazing taste! The manager is constantly on the floor checking on a patrons to make sure their experience is phenomenal! The ambiance is so beautiful and great layout they even have fireplace in front of a flat screen perfect for game or fight night!"}
{"text":"Place was very clean. Services was good. Food was fast. *** You may have to add salt and pepper   The waffle have it's all original signature cinnamon taste. Family Oriented"}
{"text":"Not good! Highly disappointed! Fried chicken was old, the fries tasted like they were re-fried. Parking is also a thumbs down! The bar tender was not very friendly either. She seemed very irritated to be at work that day! Sorry won't return"}
{"text":"Food, atmosphere, and service were all absolutely magnificent. Will DEFINITELY be back again and tell friends about it!"}
{"text":"More like 3.5
The chicken is good. The waffle was okay. They have a lot of sides. The mac n cheese is too pricy for a small portion. Otherwise, nice ambience."}
{"text":"This place is a bunch of hype. Had friends tell me they waited 2 hours to be seated on a Saturday night. I went today (Sunday) and this place is terrible. Ordered wings and waffles with blueberries and bananas, eggs and grits. The fruit on the waffle was not fresh so my waffle became super soggy and gummy. The grits were full of lumps. Gross! The eggs were ok. I asked for no cheese in the eggs but they put it in there anyway. The fried wings were not fried hard enough. So we sat for about 45 min until we were greeted with a glass of water. After we ordered it took about 1 hour to get our food. Then to eat that disappointing mediocre food. The prices are ridiculous for the quality of food. They are under staffed and can't handle large parties. There was one there and they just could not get the flow right. I will never come back here. Can you say OVERRATED!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time in May this year as a friend of ours recommended it while in town for a wedding. The location is a little out of the way, but there is Street parking right outside the restaurant and paid lots all around it since it's close to the stadium. We went in on a Sunday at 10am and there was no one in the restaurant (just the staff). And by the time we left there was just one other table. Seemed odd for brunch on a Sunday morning. Wonder why they have not attracted much of a following for brunch, but it also sounds like they opened pretty recently. I order chicken thigh + waffles and a sweet tea. I thought the food was top notch and our service was quick + friendly. I would come again whenever I'm in town and craving chicken + waffles. My experience just could have been improved by having a more energetic environment with more people. It was pretty quiet and empty."}
{"text":"I think this place deserves my 300th review. Why? Because everything about it was real and beyond my expectations! My coworkers and I were staying just outside of Cleveland for business and we were looking for somewhere to feast after a long day of training on a Tuesday night. After a long debate, one of our coworkers just blurted out \"I just want chicken and waffles dammit!\". So we did a quick Yelp search and found Chicago's Home of Chicken & Waffles. We drove a half hour to downtown Cleveland and parked across the street ($6 cash fee wasn't bad in my opinion for all day/night parking). The restaurant had a large birthday party going on when we arrived around 7:30pm but our party of 8 was seated within a few minutes. I loved the dark decor and it was a very intimate place. Nicely decorated. Our waiter explained that the owners were from Chicago but wanted to come to a new location so they chose Cleveland.

But really what matters? The FOOD! The restaurant does not serve beef or pork (bacon is turkey) and they will not substitute anything because the menu is created to please everyone. You can order a combination of sides if you are trying to build your own dish which is what I did. They have so many combos of chicken and waffles that it is incredibly hard to decide. As well as catfish and waffles, soul food combos and tons of delicious sides to choose from!! I opted for the grilled catfish filet ($5), grits ($4) and greens ($4). Everything was perfect!! Exactly what I was expecting and hoping for. The rest of my tablemates sampled so many dishes. Everything from chicken livers (my first time trying and they were absolutely amazing!) to every kind of chicken & waffles. Not one of us had a bad thing to say about this place. Really delicious homemade food that you can't find in many places. 

The service was a bit slow, but it is totally understandable due to the large parties on this particular Tuesday night. The restaurant is not enormous and we were one of three huge parties celebrating a night out. Our waiter was absolutely phenomenal!! I wish I had his name for a shoutout. He was even training a new waitress that night and was able to fulfill all of our orders accurately with a big ole smile! Everything is so clean in this restaurant and the food quantity is overwhelming. Please be sure to stop by and give it a try...I want this place to succeed so badly. Really a tasty gem with a truly wonderful staff."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I've only ever ordered the food off GrubHub. However, outside of their mac and cheese, the sides are terrible. The rice and gravy is just a few grains of rice in a puddle of gravy. Rice and beans wasn't much better. I ordered fries ala cart and it was $5 for a small portion. Chicken and biscuits we're very good, above average. Didn't try waffles as I didn't think they'd deliver well."}
{"text":"We stopped in for some Chicken & Waffles, and we were not disappointed! The chicken was on point, the waffles were good and the syrup was better than we expected (it has a hint of cinnamon in it!)"}
{"text":"Very friendly and personable. Greeted with a friendly introduction and handshake from the host. Lighting was a bit bright when we walked in, but I think somebody must have noticed because the mood lighting was in effect about half way through dinner! Even though I usually go with the favorites upon a new restaurant (the namesake chicken & waffles in this case), I went with The Darnell. It did not disappoint! Great portion size of two fried catfish fillets with a waffle. The fillets were real good - not greasy, not too salty, breading was on point and the catfish was tasty. Waffle was pretty standard with the butter and syrup.

As with any new opening, timing was off as it took a little bit longer than expected to get the food to the table, even though it was not that busy on a Thursday evening. A few of the drinks weren't available. But chalk it up to the standard newness of a restaurant. Apparently there is a live band on Saturdays. 

Friendly staff, great dinner and what looked like a menu with many options. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great atmosphere. The decor is really modern and the staff are all very friendly. Don't miss the fried chicken omelette! The prices are very reasonable for downtown brunch, and the payment on the tablet at the table was really easy. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I'm from Detroit and stopped by this place during our trip to Cleveland. There was no wait (we went on a Sunday morning) the service was excellent and the food was great! I would recommend this trendy place to anyone who loves good soul food."}
{"text":"Food pretty good. Had Kisha's creation. A little pricey for breakfast but overall good flavor. The cat fish was battered somewhat differently than what I'm use to but the fish was cooked nice and it was not overly seasoned. 
No pork in the establishment so if that's your taste maybe you should try them out."}
{"text":"Terrible service Terrible hospitality the full wasn't all that good our server did not  refill our waters He did not ask is that we want a soda or anything one water for one hour he never came back and check the onus the act like he didn't want to serve us or just one of the worst experiences you can have an a restaurant I will not be returning there's nothing they can do for me I don't recommend this place to anyone Southern Caf√© on Detroit Avenue is 1 million times better than that's. This was a waste of my money and time. I think this is a black own business with all the competition downtown we have to do better as a unit and this is bullshit."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is nice, clean surroundings, soulful music in the background. Our waiter was excellent. The food reminds me of my mothers cooking. I will be back."}
{"text":"We came while on vacation! We waited a title longer because they were having a pastors brunch but once we were swatted they let us know it would take a little extra time. W weren't in any hurry so we didn't mind the wait. 

We absolutely loved the food. It was so tasty and the staff friendly and helpful. We will definitely go there again when we in Cleveland"}
{"text":"Don't even know anything about the food ( the menu looked good) however we waited an hour and still did not get our food didn't even get offered a drink!!! No apologies, nothing at all. The boss went to all the tables with food to check on them and completely bypassed our table. I will NOT return to this location nor would I recommend it!!! My business is way more important. The decor however was appealing."}
{"text":"What can I say, what a great experience at Chicago's! Went there for its soft opening, and I was just taken away bc of the environment and classic chicken/waffles. A perfect fit and location... definitely a place to check out- don't know of any places in downtown Cleveland that are similar to this place."}
{"text":"I am just gonna start by saying this is a very nice atmosphere inside especially for a couple having dinner. The service was great and my dinner came out fast . I had a nice server named Jerry he was working the bar he recommended all the right food items . I had the two piece dark with 3 sides came to 14.50 which was excellent, the breading on the fried chicken just right not too thick light it appeared to be just a flour breading great seasoning. I've heard complaints that it was too expensive from other reviews but you have too consider overhead is very high Downtown. I do think the dessert is overpriced I would have given them 5 stars but the peach cobbler was soupy, and it was 5.50 at that price there has too be some quality control. It was good but whoever put that in that bowl should have said they were out if that's all they had. I recommend this place to try rice and beans , greens , and Mac and cheese was firing on all cylinders nice seasoning loved it ."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is great, service is great..they even have a live jazz band on the weekends(which I love) but unfortunately the food has been mediocre & underwhelming each time I've been there."}
{"text":"The food was decent.  I had something called the Katrina Creation, or something like that. Came with two cat fish fillets over a nice big waffle, with two eggs (over easy) and grits.  My boyfriend had chicken and a waffle, with a side of macaroni.  Everything was tasty. 
We did notice our waiter was a little zoned out like he wasn't all there.  He was nice but slow motion.  Then famous singer Tiana Taylor came In with her Famous Basket ball player husband and their daughter.  My boyfriend and I pretty much was put to the side after that.  Service became not so great.  My boyfriend order an alcoholic beverage that we never got.  Our waiter had the nerve to tell us the boss is the one who makes the drinks but right now he's taking care of a celebrity guest.  Mind you the celebrities came in after us. I guess the boss had to make an executive decision on who to give the best service to.  I did stop the boss and let him know we were ready to go because our own waiter hadn't came to our table in a while.  I did let boss know that we never got our drink and he took it off the bill.  Again food was decent. Not amazing enough for me to go back.  And I'm a stickler for great customer service,  which we did not get."}
{"text":"So I came to have dinner at this place and it's 10 and they are closed even though it says they are open till 12 and there phone number doesn't even work drove 30 mins for nothing"}
{"text":"I finally got to check this place out and it was well worth the wait! The ambiance, modern decor and the music all flowed well together. I ordered the Bren's special which consisted of a waffle and 2 boneless chicken breasts. I also had an order of greens and mac n cheese. The food was delicious. Everything was seasoned well. We were throughly pleased. The service was great too! The peach cobbler was also on point. I look forward to returning."}
{"text":"This place is really nice. Great decor and love the fact that they blast music from the 70's.   The food was really good. The smothered chicken thighs were yummy. I'll definitely be back. Service was great-thank you James. Good job!!"}
{"text":"Wow!  Sooooo gooooood!  This was my first chicken and waffle experience.  My husband has been to Roscoes in LA, and he loved this place too! I truly had low expectations, but was really pleasantly surprised from the beginning.  Beauty modern decor.  James was an excellent server.  We met the owner Darnell.  The fried chicken, waffles, and corn bread were UH-mazing.  And a full bar to boot.  Breakfast any time of day.  Very much comfort food.  Loved it!  Great job Darnell!  This is a CLE \"must try\""}
{"text":"This restaurant is situated in a fairly deserted part of Prospect - not quite in Playhouse Square but not quite near East 9th.  That said, the restaurant decor was very modern with a jazz lounge vibe in the front with a beauty fire place and decently sized bar.  There are a few booths around the perimeter but a lot of 4 tops through the center of the room which make it extremely crowded and hard to maneuver.  

With those things in mind I was an expecting a great experience and awesome food, what I got didn't quite live up to that. In any new restaurant I expect a nominal level of kinks that need to be worked out, hostess greetings, waitstaff timing's and responses, food timings slightly slower.  This was all expected and received. What I didn't expect was the mediocre food, and maybe I ordered wrong but this seemed to be the sentiment throughout my party.  I really hate to say this but I have to, the waffle was horrible.  It was flat, chewy and I don't think quite cooked through.  I would unfortunately have to compare it to an Eggo freezer waffle.  The chicken was o.k, seasoned well.  The corn bread was dry and neither sweet nor savory, I had quite the difficulty cutting it open to butter which maybe says something. The grits were o.k as well, we went with cheddar and it seems that the grits weren't quite cooked slow enough or long enough to get that creamy texture naturally without the help of the cheese.

Overall I understand this restaurant is new and maybe I went on an off day.  But when you are just opening and competing with DOZENS of other restaurants in the Downtown Cleveland area for a lunch crowd, first impressions count a lot more.  I might pop in again in a couple months to see if anything has changed."}
{"text":"My experience here was absolutely wonderful!!!! I had my birthday dinner here last Saturday (the third week they were open) and they accommodated my 17 guest and somehow managed to handle two other parties at the same time. Our food came quickly, hot and delicious and the birthday cheesecake was delicious. I was not rushed or asked to hurry as my dinner was kind of long. I'm so grateful for the wonderful service I received, amazing and upbeat wait staff and an amazing band that made the ambiance even better. This place is a hit."}
{"text":"I was a bit taken aback - in a good way - when I first entered. The place is very modern in decor; the front portion of the restaurant is definitely themed as a swanky lounge with a large projection TV mounted above a fireplace. Past that the walls are lined with booths, a few offering good seating for large groups. Four top tables fill the inner space, leaving not much space between the lime chairs. 

What totally seemed out of place was the plate ware. It was plastic - think school cafeteria - and is by far the cheapest out of any restaurant in town. It certainly takes the feel of the place down a few rungs. 

We were given a slightly corny, but well intentioned, \"welcome to our house,\" greeting upon arrival - twice. Everyone was friendly. Perhaps too friendly; even staff who had no reason to interact with our table said hello and asked with no point in mind how we were as they passed by. 

Grits were 86ed from the menu, which we were only informed of after ordering them. Rice or any other side was offered instead. I ordered Monique's Love for a very reasonable $10. The fried chicken breast was large. The breading was kept to a light thickness and was seasoned nicely. Monique's comes with a choice of one waffle, potato salad or fries. I chose the waffle. The waffle was on the thin side and was soft. It was a positive though I thought that the waffle did not take away from the chicken, but acted more as a mode for eating it.

For being a new restaurant some of the hesitation and hiccups in service are to be expected. The staff's friendliness was a valiant attempt to make up for the few areas the service lacked."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have heard great things about the food at this place and decided to try it out. I called around 630 to try and place an order for pick up. The girl I spoke to said they currently weren't doing take out orders. Before asking for a manager, the only answer to any of my questions was \"I don't know\" with an \"I don't care\" attitude. Supposedly they ran out of to - go containers (in the middle of downtown Cleveland..? Really..?) and were not able to take carry out orders. Poor planning and Very unprepared. I've heard great things about the food at this place, but not about the service. Working in the service industry myself, I know that customer satisfaction is key to having a successful business. If the actual service is any reflection to the rude phone conversation I had with an employee then I'm more then happy to take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"I wanted to love it. The fried chicken and waffle was good.  If you are looking for traditional diner options like simple \"eggs, bacon, toast\" this isn't a great pick. Just nothing spectacular or remarkable.  Pretty pricy bill esp since no one had anything to drink except coffee. 

There were 4 of us and instead of the server giving a printed check, she handed my husband a mini iPad w a Square credit card swiper.   When my husband asked to just split tab in half (rather than have her itemize who got which items), the server said they could not split checks.  

Then when she handed him the iPad - the tip amount by default chooses 25% gratuity and if you wish to tip a different amount, you have to manually change it in front of the server.  

I understand restaurants listing suggested tip percentages but Since when did auto default become 25%?  All four of us used to work for tips serving and bartending, but I didn't like that move and don't plan on returning."}
{"text":"We called ahead to this location and spoke with an employee who explained to us the hours of operation. The hours are dine in until 2pm and carry out from 2pm-5pm. The employee told us as long as we where there before 2pm we could be seated. We arrived at the restaurant at 1:50pm. There was no host to greet us and when he finally did, he told us that we would have to carry out. We explained to him what we had been told over the phone and he sent another employee to tell us we could not be seated. We left the restaurant at 1:57pm. That is simply poor customer service !!!! It does not matter how late it is as long as you are at a business before closing hours you should be served. We were a party of two !!! I wonder how much business this place is losing because of lazy employees."}
{"text":"The waiter was not very helpful with service and he was very sly and devious about the bill and the extra tip he tag onto the bill."}
{"text":"Well, after witnessing a server and manager on the floor arguing...not good.  I ask my daughter if we should get our food to go, we decided to stay, next I witness another server take a rage, clean her pants off then place the rag on the counter.  The server was somewhat tall, glasses, and light skin.  I was turned off.  The food was an 8 and ready to check out after waiting 38 mins for our food, keep in mind less than ten people were seated, I decided to order desert and they bring me a burned...very burned sweet potato pie, I complain then it was another sweet potato pie and peach cobbler that they been strongly trying to sale.  Anyway, it will be a while until I visit this place again, I think they all need some training, from all levels."}
{"text":"Tried this place on a Friday night at 10. Got there and was told it would be a 40 min wait. Fortunately I live within walking distance so I chose not to wait. Place was packed. Went back Saturday afternoon and still busy but got a table. I got the rosemary which was a delicious blend of waffles and egg omelette. The service was a bit slow but place was really busy. I will come back. Bit pricey but good food quality."}
{"text":"This was a great experience, the food was great, service was excellent and the music was amazing. Very good vibe and delicious food with plenty of choices."}
{"text":"My husband and I fly in from Portland OR every 6 weeks for the cleveland clinic and we are always looking for places to eat. This place EXCEEDS our expectations. Food is amazing and consistent with generous portions. We felt very taken care of on all fronts. Our server Lenny and the bartender/GM James made us feel welcome and were efficient and friendly. We will return and this will be one of our spots. We highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We had The Rosemary (omelette), a Soul Food combo (fried catfish, fried chicken leg & thigh) and a Grilled Chicken Thigh dinner.

Sides ordered: yams, mac & cheese, collard greens, biscuit, cornbread and red beans & rice.

The omelette was perfectly cooked. It was light. fluffy & full of fried chicken.
The yams were nice & sweet. One person at the table thought the greens were a little too salty. The red beans & rice was some of the best that I have had in a long time. 
I would actually give all the sides a 5-rating, but the chicken, fish and waffle deserve a 3-rating.

The waffle was flavorful. It had a great cinnamon flavor to it. It was a little dense. 
Usually when I get chicken & waffles at a restaurant, I get a melt-in-your-mouth texture. 
It was flavorful, so I would order it again. 

There is a lot of fried chicken & fried fish to be had in this town. 
The chicken & the fish were slightly seasoned & lightly breaded then fried. 
It was not exceptional. 

On a return trip, I would order the omelette, the waffle & the sides."}
{"text":"Second time eating here, love the food. However, I don't know if it is the norm, but me and wifey roll in to kick it with a nice dinner at 5:30 on a Saturday afternoon and they got this place bumpin like we at the club. It was so loud I didn't even bother to try and carry on a conversation. It was an hour where folk had their little ones and everything and the music that was being played wasn't appropriate for families. They should consider the hour, and the type of atmosphere they set is appropriate for that time of day. At 9pm bring the DJ in make it a 21 and over spot, then get lit like a club all you want."}
