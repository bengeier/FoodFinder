{"text":"Ive never injoyed a dinner as much as i did at the vilka Bistro. Its a little pricey,  but so worth it. Thats our new go to place. Its also  classy on the inside. Love the lighting, and not alot on the walls. 
So if your looking for an excellent steak, seafood or anything else, this is a great place. Trust me. You'll go back ."}
{"text":"It was just ok. Overpriced. Not busy. Owner just stood there with his hands in his pockets all night. IMO he should be connecting with guests and building connections to secure some kind of equity with the guests. Wine is short poured."}
{"text":"Our first visit here, we are occasional visitors to Pittsburgh and always look for something new. Vilka Bistro did not disappoint! Friendly greeting at the door and at the table. The menu isn't pages and pages, but what's on there is varied and not the same old stuff. One minor quibble, the seafood entrees tend toward the shellfish and mollusks, those who enjoy fin fish more will be a little disappointed. 

The bartender knows what she's doing. That's all
I'll say. Wine list is limited but the selections
they have are good ones. Plenty of beers. 

After a tasty Caesar salad I had the pork belly, which was cooked perfectly. My partner had the special of the day, hassenfeffer, a rabbit dish with a fennel sauerkraut that was amazing. We finished up with a vanilla bean creme brulee that was a denser than usual but still a nice ending to a great dinner. 

We weren't hungry enough to get starters and entrees but we will come back to get starters next time."}
{"text":"I've seen several articles about this new place in the South Hills and we thought we should try it out, as it sounded like an interesting concept. Consequently, four of us decided to give it a trial on a Saturday night. Being Saturday, we made reservations to make sure we could get in. We needed have been too concerned. When we got to the place, our table was ready and we were promptly seated. Throughout the meal, no more than half the tables were ever occupied (on a Saturday night???). 

The staff was very friendly and helpful. From the hostess to the waitress, we only got the best of service. They were on the ball, constantly checking if things were going OK, and trying to be as helpful as they could possible be. I suspect that part of it was the lack of other customers though. As a matter of fact, at one point during our meal i happened to glance towards the kitchen to see a whole bunch of the wait staff lined up against the wall and looking at the tables ... to see if anything needed to be done! While that's great of customers, I am not sure what this level of overstaffing means to the long term longevity of the place?

The decor is not quite as industrial as most places these days which is a good thing. It was nice to see a drop down ceiling with sounds absorbing tiles for a change. Unfortunately, those tiles did not help much as the restaurant was piping in music at an extremely loud level. When we first met our waitress, even thought she was standing right next to me, I could not hear her. She raised her voice to almost a shout and we could then converse. We asked her to have the volume reduced and she agreed it was too loud. We never felt a reduction in the noise level and towards the end of our meal, asked to speak to the manager (Michelle). We complained about the noise level and she basically shrugged us off. Not good.

The walls are painted in a dark burgundy color, the furniture is a dark wood, and the lighting was relatively dim (are these restaurants so ashamed of their food that they do not want the customer to see it?). Between the excessive noise, and the darkness of the room, it was not an enjoyable experience even with the great service form our waitress.

We ended up ordering four different dishes from the one page menu. It was nice to see the menu not featuring the same old items from every other restaurant (or Sysco) and we were excited to try the different items. One great thing that they did really well was the each dish was arranged artistically on the plate, so the initial impression was of a beautiful plate! Unfortunately, some errors in the cooking process took away from our enjoyment of the food. Here are the four dishes (also see the pictures I uploaded for how nice they looked!):

Salad with Crab - The salad featured all kinds of veggies and a giant crab cake. Except for bit too much red onion for the taste of our friend who ordered it, it was very good, tasty, and definitely was a very generous meal.

Salmon - This was presented beautifully with a sunny-side egg draped over the salmon piece. The salmon was cooked perfectly and the green beans, sauce, and egg complemented each other very well.

Crab cakes - two of the giant crab cakes placed on a bed of well-cooked risotto. Yum! Added a side order of Asparagus to have some green and was disappointed as the restaurant left the tough woody parts of the stems on the Asparagus, so we had to cut them off ourselves.

Baked Lamb - A bed of roasted potatoes, slices of well-seasoned (but way oversalted!) ground lamb and a fan of the same Asparagus as on the side dishes was a beautiful presentation.

All portions were very ample. Including wine and beers, we ended up spending about $40 per person. Given the nice dishes, and the ampleness of the dishes, this was a very reasonable price.

If some of the cooking errors get fixed, and the noise level reduced to a quarter of what it was during our visit, I would rate this restaurant as amongst the best in the South Hills. I hope they correct these problems."}
{"text":"For me, this place was okay. I had the brisket sandwich with a white sauce, too much of a smoked flavor for me, my boyfriend had the pulled pork which is very sweet. The fries were fresh cut and not bad,  but for the price, it just wasn't good enough for a return visit."}
{"text":"So I went to Pittsburgh for the Steelers game and a friend informed me of the opening of a new restaurant. My wife and I stopped by for a Saturday dinner prior to the game. Wow, service was phenomenal and the food was perfect. John the chef did an amazing job and we even met the owner Ed, who was on site and ensuring everything was on point. I can't express how much it means as a small business owner to see another owner putting his time and effort into every aspect of his business. Definitely stop and give it a try, it's a \"can't miss\" restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is a joke. Looks super nice on the outside but beware of what's going on inside. 

Went to brunch today with my mother in law bc she has suggested this place bc she has gone for a drink. So I've seen them post on social media about their brunch. We went and man we were dissatisfied. We got sat quickly and the brunch is buffet style. I really like that option. The server came over and told us that it's brunch and you get a mimosa with the buffet. Nice little perk! But we went up and took a look and was underwhelmed. They had a craving station normal bfast meats and some random lunch items. Also made to order omelettes and waffles. The danishes are store bought and the fruit platter was super sad. 

My mother in law loves prime rib so she got that and they also had her favorite bread pudding. She literally took a bit of the bread pudding and said it was terrible. Then onto her other favorite prime rib, she took a few bites and threw it away. She had a piece of chicken and couldn't finish that either. So everything that was on her plate she picked at. She was very upset that nothing was good. 

I got an made to order omelette, that's hard to mess up so it was good. I got the bacon which was eh and then thank the lord they had salad bc I pretty much filled up on that. 

So we both looked at each other when finished unsatisfied. We got our check and both in utter shock! The bill was $48, so that's $24 for their buffet. WHAT THE HECK!!! The grand concourse brunch is about the same price for a whole a lot more food that is totally amazing. 

Inclusion we will not be back and super sad that we wasted our money there. I really hope you guys step your game up bc that area needs a good restaurant!"}
{"text":"This is a terrific new restaurant that we are just in love with - great location boarding Bethel, Brookline, Mt. Lebo, Castle. And, right by Andy Warhol's final resting place! Food fantastic, service great!  Soooooo worth the trip!!!! Check out the polenta, roasted tomato soap and I am told the scallops are incredible!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch, and we loved our meals.  We had the California chicken sandwich and the crabbie-patty.  The sandwich was so big that we took half of it home.  It was delicious, and it came with a side of fries.   The crab cake came with a side of balsamic glazed Brussels sprouts.  We thoroughly enjoyed our food as well as the service.  We will certainly come back."}
{"text":"We visited for the first time this week for an early dinner (4:30) and we almost left because there was no one else in the entire restaurant.  Luckily, we decided to give it a try.  Our waitress, Kelly J, was so attentive and made our visit even more enjoyable.  They have a great dinner menu with lots of options.  Kelly showed us the lunch menu too just so we knew for future visits what they offered!  I'm excited to try it for lunch.  I'm gluten free and there were a lot of choices for me.  The gf items are marked on the menu but when I asked if they could make the pork belly gf they did!  It was delicious and a nice sized portion. By the time we were finishing up there were about 4 tables seated so it started to pick up a bit.  This will definitely be on our rotation of restaurants!"}
{"text":"Wow!  Thank goodness for this nice surprise.  The food is creative and delicious.  Took our daughters and we had so much fun.  Our server was experienced by 30 years she said and it showed.  She was so nice, quick, and very personable.  The atmosphere is okay, kitchen and staff are kinda just right there where the tables are but they'll figure it out.  Maybe a divider wall of some sort. But the food and service is outstanding.  The bar area is very pretty.  Not your typical Restuarant for bethel park.  Much needed."}
{"text":"Wasn't very satisfied with the food. Very expensive for what we got a total of 3 entrees and the food wasn't good and it wasn't bad it was just okay. I'll stick to another restaurant that I like closer."}
{"text":"Start to finish we had an amazing experience. We arrived  to being greeted right away by a friendly hostess. She seated us and thanked us for joining for dinner. Our waitress was bery prompt and courteous. Answered all our questions.
Food was great, only negative I can say was the roasted potatoes with the Ahi Tuna needed salt. Everything else with the dish and the Crab cakes dish was prepared as requested and tasted great.
The peach dessert was so good and plenty for 2 to share. This was our first night out in months without kids and was a wondeful experience."}
{"text":"This new addition to Bethel Park is superb! The food is great and the atmosphere is too. I love the bar and I'm looking forward to the patio in the warmer weather. I would order the salmon again in a heartbeat. I had a hard time choosing a dessert, but ended up with two delicious choices. I just wish they would've had the ginger cake to try. The staff and service also rocked!"}
{"text":"Very nice, the bar is trendy and relaxing.  One of the nicest in the local area.  They have local whiskeys and brew which is really nice.  I only had two appetizers the pork tacos were bomb very good and the millennium chicken that was good basic but good.  I definitely can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"Went there for Sunday brunch.  They have good menu selection, but I went for the buffet.  At this point, it's not the widest spread of buffet items, but plenty to eat, and all the food is great tasting.  They had waffle, omelet and carving (prime rib) stations, among other offerings.  For a $24 buffet and bottomless mimosas, I think it's a great price.  Service was very good, everyone was very friendly.

I hope this place catches on.  They're off to a good start, and I hope they continue to fine tune things.  They have really nice decor, as well.  For a Sunday brunch at noon, my thought was, if this place was downtown, it would be packed by now, and it was a bit more than half full."}
{"text":"This place has a good atmosphere. Our server was very attentive and friendly. We had four kids with us and they were super accommodating and patient. Everyone had no complaints about our meals. I personally had scallops and they were delicious. The power went out during our visit because of a storm, and our server was very apologetic even though it was out of her control. We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Excellent food, large portions, and modern decor highlight this restaurant. There aren't many restaurants with freshly prepared local food and unique menus in Bethel Park. This place is a welcome addition. Tried the ribeye and crab cakes. Both were excellent. Kids steak was a full 8 oz steak. Daughter was impressed. Still working through a few kinks in the opening weeks, but I expect vilka bistro to become a South Hills Hotspot quickly. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"We waited nearly a month before trying this place to give them a chance to work out the bugs. Maybe we should have waited longer.
The highpoint was the autumn squash salad my wife ordered. The sweet nuts added just the right touch to the fresh greens.
I ordered the chicken with pasta. The chicken was dry and the portion of meat was less than generous.  
My wife ordered the spiral zucchini. It wasn't meant to be a soup, but it was served with so much liquid that she was compelled to send it back to the kitchen to be drained. She commented that it lacked flavor. 
The service wasn't quite there yet. Our server was friendly enough but took some time to check to see if we were happy with our meals. A number of servers were congregated in the back of the restaurant, maybe for training. We couldn't be sure. 
What is it about Pittsburgh restaurants feeling that people need time after the dishes are cleared before they bring over the check? I thought we were so over that when smoking was banned. 
The truth is that we might give this place a second chance someday. They might still be working the bugs out and we want to give them the benefit of the doubt. 
It is a bit on the expensive side, but they do claim that all food is fresh and cooked to order. We'll probably wait until some of our friends come back with a glowing review before we give them a second chance."}
{"text":"I have visited a few times and had lunch in the restaurant side as well as the bar side.  It is a well run neat, clean place with great food and experienced bartenders.  The brisket and pulled pork are excellent and so are the burgers.  I had the Austin burger.  Service was very good with the employees well versed and knowledgeable on the specifics of the menu.  Plenty of parking and great location.  I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"A local gem. Wife's seafood pasta \"awesome\". My tuna very different but good. Will be back."}
{"text":"I stopped by here this a couple of Saturday nights ago with my wife and another couple for dinner.  The other couple had made reservations for 6:30 and we arrived a little early to Vilka Bistro at 6:15.  Thankfully that wasn't a problem and they gave us the option of waiting at the bar or being seated at our table.  We chose our table and were promptly taken back to it.  The inside of Vilka is nice and very modern looking.  There is a large bar area and then a larger dining room right beside.  On the day that we were there, there also happened to be two large parties.  So there seemed to be a lot of dead space in the restaurant, especially near our table which I would be willing to bet isn't usually that way.

For dinner on this evening I decided to order the ribeye at a medium while my wife went with the fishermans pasta.  The menu describes the ribeye as a 14 oz ribeye made your way (I chose black and blue) served with mashed potatoes and vegetables (squash on this day).  Our food took a little while to get to us and our waitress apologized explaining that we were behind one of the larger parties.  It honestly wasn't long enough that I started to fixate on it but it's good to know that customer service isn't dead.  Shortly after she let us know that our food arrived at the table and both my meal and my wife's looked great.  I can't say that I was too fond of the cook on my meat.  One side was maybe a medium rare (closer to rare than medium) while the other side was pretty rare.  So that means in addition to not being cooked to the proper temp, it was seared poorly too with one side being on longer than the other.  Thankfully I can eat a rare steak even if it isn't my favorite thing and so that is what I chose to do here.  It wasn't the best ribeye that I have had as a lot of the fat hadn't been rendered down which made it somewhat difficult to eat.  What I did enjoy about it was the seasoning and also the blue cheese that was on top.  As for the sides, they were decent.  The mashed potatoes were creamy and tasted good enough while the squash was cooked well and was easy enough to eat.

Th bottom line for me is that I would give it a try again in the future.  While my protein was poorly cooked, my wife's dish looked fantastic and the rest of my meal was cooked well enough that I would give it another try."}
{"text":"Very very cool space tucked into the south hills suburbs. Service was excellent. I only gave three stars because the food is just, eh. Everything was just fine, not great and not bad. This place is brand new so I'm hoping they work out the kinks in the kitchen because it has the bones to be awesome. I look forward to hopefully amending this review in the future."}
{"text":"The server was amazing and the food was presented well. However the variation between the lunch menu and dinner menu is odd. Also the fact that they did not know the difference between gorgonzola cheese and blue cheese amazed me. I do not know if I would return, was not satisfied with the overall experience. I know this place is new and trying to give it the benefit of the doubt but cant."}
{"text":"This is the best place i have been to in the South Hills. Nothing else like it!! Atmosphere is awesome and i love the modern decor. I dont see how anyone can give this place a negative review. There was nothing bad at all about it. The bar is beautiful with multi colored lights that change. How cool is that?? I had the special, Poutine fries and it was delicious. My friend had the Pecan salad which she loved. The portions are huge and I saw a lot of people leave with doggie bags. I also ate here a few weeks ago for their Sunday brunch. SO MUCH TO CHOOSE FROM and the prime rib was to die for- totally melt in your mouth. I choose the option of having 2 Mimosas which were included but i could have paid only $5 more for the  unlimited Bloody Mary bar. WHAT??? I met the owners and they are awesome. Cant wait to book a giant GNO in the summer when the patio opens. If you dont stop in to dine here you are missing out!!"}
{"text":"Well... I have to say all of the servers were friendly as well as the hostesses. But, the food here was not good. Period. The soup du jour was a mushroom something or other? It was like warm at best and the color and consistency were off. Had a half a wedge salad. Lettuce was wilted, blue cheese dressing seemed homemade but had zero flavor. Weird. Not even any salt. Gross roasted tomatoes. Just don't. Seemed like they use these tomatoes in a variety of dishes. Nobody wants a cold, unseasoned slimy cherry tomato anywhere in their food. Then had Chilean sea bass for entree. It was a special. Fish was somewhat fresh I guess... again no seasoning and it was in a pool of overly salty creamy sauce w what was described as roasted veg. More like a few pieces of carrots n celery.  Where was the zucchini, Brussels sprouts or asparagus??? Overall the entire table had issues with their food. Two of my friends had scallops which looked good. A little rubbery though. And I tasted one that was gritty with sand. Needed cleaned obvi. But the worst of the night was the risotto. So overly seasoned with sage and it was crunchy. There was literally 3 cups of this gunk under the scallops. My friend even described her steak as \"gummy\". . Even the spicy marg got sent back because my friend described it as tasting like \"vomit\". Just an overall bad experience. Don't go."}
{"text":"This restaurant just opened a few days ago. I was very excited to try it. It's owned by a local couple. I prefer to support local businesses. When we walked in we were greeted warmly and seated quickly. The restaurant is decorated very tastefully. It leans toward a contemporary feel. 
We checked out the menu. I chose the Scallops over Scallion Risotto. When the dish came it was plated beautifully. The Scallops were large and cooked perfectly. The asparagus on top was also cooked perfectly. The Risotto was very flavorful. Since it was scallion I thought it might have a heavy onion taste but it didn't. A lot of people don't do Risotto well but this was the right consistency. It was drizzled with a little herb oil which added to the flavor. 
My husband had the Pork Chop. Some places give you two but they give you one-for good reason. The pork chop is huge!  It is one of the thickest pork  chops I've seen. It was cooked perfectly as well. The pork chop was moist despite its thickness. The pork chop had been kind of \"tomahawked\" which made the plating look very nice. It was topped with an apple chutney that went well with the chop. For sides there were mashed potatoes and a warm broccoli and radish salad. I'm not a huge fan of radishes but these had been quartered and sautéed with some basaltic vinegar. They were very tasty. 
For dessert we shared the Drunken Peach Which was a peach cobbler with vanilla bean ice cream and drizzled with a bourbon sauce. We were both full but couldn't stop eating it. Yes, it was that good. 
Our service was outstanding. Our server was wonderful. She was friendly and kept checking on us and refilling our glasses. 
The beer and bar menu was solid. It was definitely better than any chain restaurant. It covers a lot of craft beer. All of the cocktails used top shelf ingredients. 
Please note that the lunch menu is different than the dinner menu. (I posted pics of both menus).  I already have a friend meeting me there for lunch on Wednesday to give that menu a try."}
{"text":"Very good service and a variable menu. Soft opening right now but expecting big things.  Enjoyed the time there. Dylan did a great job. Very knowledgeable."}
{"text":"I will likely be reiterating what others have said.

1. Food was excellent.  It was Friday so it was fish all around.  3 people had the special - Chilean Sea Bass.  Portion was nice (especially compared to the large chain seafood restaurant) and was perfectly cooked.  I had the scallops - also cooked perfectly.  In general, I'm not a fan of risotto so can't say if it was done well or not, it's just not my thing.   We also shared a wedge salad which was very nice.
2.  Service was very good.  The waitress was friendly and really engaged with everyone.
3.  Only complaint was the dining area.  I realize they're just getting started and the crowd was light for a Friday night which made you feel concerned about how everything was going to be.  Like someone else said, I think they could try dimming the lights to make it a bit more \"cozy\" for lack of a better word.
4.  I think if people try this place, they'll like it.  Seems like they need to get the word out more."}
{"text":"Went there for brunch today. Had the prime rib and it was perfectly cooked. The flavor was delicious. They have build your own omelette station. There is a waffle making station, fresh cut fruit, and other breakfast/lunch items. All you can drink momosas. All 5 of us enjoyed it. Great value at 24$ per person and looking forward to coming back for dinner. Met the owner and the brunch is only going to be growing with more items. The menu changes 3-4 times per year. The place is amazing and very welcoming. You walk in and can hardly believe you are still in bethel park. I'm looking forward to the outdoor seating, come spring. I saw pictures of the patio and was impressed and eager to come back. Can't wait for summer and to have a delicious well spent meal outside in a great atmosphere. You have to try this place and see for yourself. P.S the bar is incredible!!!"}
{"text":"Like many others in the neighborhood, I had been waiting for the opening of Vilka Bistro. Finally, I had a chance to check it out.

Before going I looked at the reviews and noticed a good bit of them are from lunch, this leads me to wonder if the lunch experience is a different one.

Perhaps I set my standards high, I don't know. Sadly, I just wasn't 'wowed' by Vilka Bistro.

To be fair I'll break down my review.

Upon entering, I thought the décor was awesome, then when I stepped into the main dining area, I thought they were closing. Granted it was late, 9 PM, but the tables were empty, and the room was far too bright. I don't know if it was just this one time or if it is all the time. There are hanging and circular ceiling lights in dining room, perhaps a low wattage, yellow light in the ceiling instead of bright, white, it just gave a harsh feel. Ambience is everything, the design is there, the lighting just through it off.

Our server Beverly was amazing, on top of things and knowledgeable. I liked her a lot, absolutely no complaints and only praise for the service.

The menu selection was small. At least for the entrees, not much to choose from and they had only one choice for a special.

The appetizer prices were high, average $12.00, way above average for the area. The entrees were right on par with some of the nicer places.

Presentation was mostly five star, but somehow I believe they focused on that instead of flavor. We ordered an appetizer of Buffalo chicken dip, it was good, I wouldn't recommend the grilled ciabatta bread, get the chips.

I ordered the fisherman pasta (Pictured), to their credit the shrimp and scallops were cooked to perfection, but the sauce, I was told was a light wine, lemon, it was a heavy cream and tasted cheesy. My daughter ordered the lamb bake, she didn't like it. I thought it was tasty. The roasted potatoes looked pretty but lacked any seasoning, the asparagus was tiny and shriveled. My complaint about the lamb was it was supposed to have a mint creme fraiche drizzle, when honestly it tasted more like Tzatiki sauce. We ended up switching entrees.
 
I am generously giving it a three star because the presentation and service were top notch. Unfortunately, this place wasn't for me.

I hate to beat the place up, they are still new and maybe they'll get better. You may love them, I did not. I wanted to, but didn't and I am not sure I will ever give them a second chance."}
{"text":"my hubby & i went a few days after it opened for dinner, & liked it, but it seemed they needed some time to \"get it together\", so, our ladies lunch group decided to go back & try it for lunch. it also happened to be restaurant week. 
there was only 1 choice, restaurant week called it a cubano, the waitress called it a pork sandwich. didn't sound very exciting the way she described it. as the girls are NOT into new foods, marty actually got something out of her realm! she got the mahi mahi tacos. she never had mahi mahi before. she said she loved it. ate 2, took 1 home. joanne had the fish & fries. huge piece of fish. she took home some leftovers too. both looked good to me. me, i went for the grilled cheese sandwich. you say, yeah, a grilled cheese, big deal. the reason i got it, can you say deep fried?! that's right, a deep fried grilled cheese! it was 3 cheeses, bacon, spinach & tomato. & it was HUGE!!! unfortunately, it seemed to be missing tomato, had little bacon & only a few leaves of spinach! it tasted good, but if i had more of the missing ingredients, it would've been great! half of my sandwich came home with me.
joanne said the bathroom was clean, but they only have blow dryers, no paper towels. some people like paper towels for health reasons.
they still don't seem to have a big following. i don't know why. it was 12:30 on Saturday. i walked in 1st. there were 4 women at the bar. that was it. by 1, 7 other tables were filled. 
the food is good, don't get me wrong, but not exceptional, not wow, over the top. the food looks great, the atmosphere is great, the décor is beautiful, the service outstanding. hmmmmm.........i guess you'll have to decide for yourself on this 1!"}
{"text":"I have been waiting a long time for this place to open and when I arrived it did not disappoint. Vilka Bistro opened last week so they are currently in final remodeling stages. You can see some of that when you walk in but don't let that deter you.

I was warmly greeted and given a half booth in the back. As you enter there is a full service bar towards the right. They have their own WiFi. Pass code available upon request.

My waitress Tina, went over the lunch menu and told me what the soup of the day was. I decided to go with the chicken sandwich which came with provolone, avocado, tomato, and more on a bun. All of their sandwiches pair with French Fries but if you are not a fry lover you can swap out for a few of the sides at no extra cost. Those would include your house salad and the vegetable of the day. Today's vegetable was a broccoli, spinach, with radishes. That looked very good so I decided to opt with that. The other sides that require a $2.00 up-charge include asparagus, risotto, and their \"special\" salad.

The menu also has some gluten free items as well as vegetarian options available for choice. I got my lunch fairly quickly and was amazed at how big the sandwich was! Glancing at some of the other tables I could tell that they serve large portions here so you are getting your monies worth.

My broccoli, spinach, radish mix vegetable side was literally top notch and I would highly recommend it. Although the side was small I loved every bit of it. The chicken sandwich was good as well. The only thing was that it was a little tough to bite into.

I got to meet the manager and found out they are open on Sundays which will come in handy for a nice meal on Christmas Eve. There are  limited hours that day however.

My waitress was extremely attentive to my needs and made sure my beverages were taken care of.

This place is a welcome addition to Bethel Park since it is part of the new strip mall that already has a few shops and health clubs here. It also sits conveniently by Sheetz gas and is a short drive to Washington junction T station parking lot. There are plenty of parking spaces since it is on the corner of this strip mall and I normally drive by this area all the time when I am headed south on Rt 88.

Am looking forward to coming here again to try out their dinner menu."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like Vilka Bistro and waited a long time for them to work out the kinks before trying it. The decor is very nice, but the acoustics are not great. Four of us arrived at 12:30 for lunch. The music was a pounding bass rhythm that would have been more appropriate for a dance club. It was so loud we had trouble hearing each other talk. And it was very cold inside, which is a complaint we seem to find at many restaurants. No one seems to know how to compensate the temperature for the weather outside.

The server was very friendly and served drinks as well as took our order fairly promptly. Then we waited nearly 45 minutes for our food. A woman - the manager, maybe? - brought out a Reuben and kept calling it a brisket, which one of us had also ordered. Once we realized it was a Reuben, we told her which of us ordered it. The Reuben was cold. The Mahi tacos were cold. The Brisket sandwich was cold. The fries were cold. Even the Brussels sprouts were cold. The soup was cold. The shrimp lettuce wraps were cold too, although we didn't know if it was supposed to be hot or cold. We couldn't tell.

Sadly, for most of the dishes, the flavor profiles were there. Had the food been hot, it could have been delicious.  The exception was the soup, called tomato Creole. In addition to being cold, it had the consistency and taste of very thick, plain, tomato sauce. No Creole flavor detected. The thickness was off-putting and difficult to eat. We would not have called it soup. We noticed another table received a bowl of soup too, but it had two pieces of toasted bread garnishing the bowl. Ours had no bread.

The lettuce wraps were impossible to eat as a lettuce wrap, and for $14 as an entree, one would have expected at least one side. They were puny and not at all filling. The majority of the dish was lettuce. They would have worked best as an appetizer, but even then, they were very overpriced.

Unfortunately, we won't return. There is a disconnect somewhere between the chefs, the servers and even the manager. Two people ate only part of their meals, despite them being cold. One was very elderly and needed to eat SOMETHING at that point. One person sent back their entire meal, as the sandwich was so cold that the brisket was sitting in pooling grease and the cheese was congealed. The staff was apologetic, but the fact was that two of us left still hungry, and the other two were taking most of their meal home to re-heat."}
