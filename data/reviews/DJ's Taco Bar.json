{"text":"Fantastic tacos! They are legit. We smelled the carne asada on the strip and followed the delicious smell."}
{"text":"So bummed that this place didn't pan out! I was bugging my husband to eat some great tacos for a week while we were staying on the LV Strip. And this place ranked high on Yelp. 

I decided to just try their $2 tacos. They were out of the steak, so I got shredded beef and marinated chicken. 

I got a little nervous when I started looking at the food laid out in front of me. The place looked like a mess, unkept, and unclean. 

The worst part was that the sour cream bottle was swimming in a dirty watery ice bath and when the employee started to squeeze the sour cream onto my taco, the dirty water from that bottle dripped all over my tacos. Then, the employee charged me $2.50 instead of $2 for the what they advertised as $2 tacos. The $2.50 wasn't with the tax. The tax was additional. So disappointed. 

The tacos were ok, but I would never go out of my way to go to this place again.

With all the great places to eat on the LV Strip, I'd skip this place and pay more for better quality food and for a place that keeps up with healthy sanitary standards and practices.

They were not busy at all. I should have known when there wasn't a line out the door for $2 tacos that I should have skipped this place."}
{"text":"This place was great, the food was good and price was amazing after spending on average $25 a meal anywhere else in Las Vegas. My only complaint was the building itself was a little small, it was tight getting more than a couple people in there at once."}
{"text":"I went to dj's when it was new and I didn't like it, so I hadn't been back since today. I still didn't like it. They don't load enough meat onto their tacos- which might explain them being only $2. (that's pretty cheap for being in the mall)(I work there)(I've been everywhere).

the food wasn't vibrant in color which is one of my favorite things about Mexican food. the beans tasted sour, as if they had limes squeezed into them. I've had all kinds of beans, but never sour, that was weird, and probably the worst part. the rice serving was small, and I only got 2 chips with the beans. technically I ordered rice and beans and not chips and beans but why give me any at all then?? everything was cold by the time I sat down with my tray. 

I almost immediately felt nausea after finishing and still do, 8 hours later.  I tried going into it with an open mind but I couldn't help it, I already knew it wasn't going to be different this time around. 

don't even get me started on its inauthenticity."}
{"text":"Pollo al pastor burrito was delicious, their salsas are HOT!!! so make sure you get a corona!!!"}
{"text":"Great value for your money!

I was in Vegas on a work conference. After finding out that the evening event would only serve appetizers (I know, lame!) I quickly found a place for a quick bite. Yelp had a deal for DJs taco bar, so I gave it a shot. 

I got the fish tacos, and while they weren't necessarily the best I've ever had, for $10 they did just fine. I also got the beans and rice as well as chips and guac. 

I'll knock off a star for the fact that the food was good, not great. Value-wise, I feel like I got a lot for my money. They also took longer than I expected to make the food.

Bottom line: If I'm in the area and want a quick, delicious bite, I'll go back!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Cheap alternative to godly expensive trendy Vegas food. Manager super cool. Gave us samples of whatever wanted. Very grateful for customers and good people. Come eat here you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"A great inexpensive lunch on the Strip. I had the pork taco and the steak taco. Both very tasty. I would recommend this place for anyone looking to escape the casino restaurants but doesn't want chain fast food. This place is fast but dishes are made with your selection of meat and sauces."}
{"text":"Disappointed, especially after reading reviews. Spent $18 for carne asada fries and taco plate. Expected full size foam container and got HALF for fries. Couldn't taste the meat too much cheese sauce, that one my fault, should have asked for one scoop. Taco plate, one scoop rice and beans, expected more, though beans were really good. Would i come back, maybe but not go out of my way to do so. Onr more thing seating outaide, hips hurt because metal seats meant for size 7 and under!"}
{"text":"Being from Houston I was surprised at the authentic quality of the food. Great for lunch. Prices are extremely reasonable and less expensive than many places in the strip. I believe they had a 2-12oz beer deal for $7. We didn't find that anywhere else on the strip."}
{"text":"Not the best taco stand in the world but not too bad given other options on the strip. Worth a visit for a quick and cheap meal."}
{"text":"The service is terrible. The food oily and greasy. 
The cook is a pig. Don't go there at night. There's no seating inside. If your handicapped they treat you like shit."}
{"text":"Great service and good food. We tried this restaurant based on the good reviews and we were not disappointed. I would probably rate it as $$ for price though. We had a chicken and steak burrito ($10 each) and they were running a special for a $2 beer with purchase of any burrito.  Food can be a little more expensive in Vegas so for Vegas prices it is comparable.  The portion size was generous and and taste was great. Service was excellent. The woman behind the counter even went next door to get me a Diet Coke when their Coca Cola machine wasn't working. Seating inside is limited but there is a patio outdoors. No AC but they had blower fans which kept us cool. The restaurant was clean and we were amused by the mural on the wall. Overall a good experience!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent. A bit pricey but this is the strip!!! I ordered a burrito and nachos, meaning I got two different dishes. I'm stuffed. I'm going to blow up. I love pigging out."}
{"text":"Good carne asada burrito with horchata.  Nice quick lunch on the strip in an unpretentious stand, but still big enough to have some AC!"}
{"text":"By far the best taco place on the strip. It's tiny, but there were multiple reviews for its taste and value, so my friend and I decided to go.

The burrito was humongous. The meat was tender and delicious. There was a lot to choose from for my burrito, so I piled it up. I highly recommend it.

The chips were okay since they tasted like they came from a bag. I was kind of hoping they made their own, but it's not taking away from their quality.

The hot sauce wasn't too alarming, but it's probably to cater to the average person. It was delicious though.

The reason I gave it a 4 and not a 5 is because while I was eating, there were flies constantly landing on me, which disturbed my lunch. That's why I took half of my burrito to my hotel room and devoured it."}
{"text":"Excellent choice for a quick & delicious lunch.  All tacos were great as was  the guacamole. 
Will be back again!"}
{"text":"This taco bar was ok. You can eat for $10 here more $ if you want a drink. The food was alright, not raving about it, but for $10 on the strip you can't really complain."}
{"text":"Ordered a taco plate and the carne asada was dry, they were out of white salsa, they were out of churros, and they were out of al pastor. I love street taco places and this is definitely the worst one. Will never come here again. Much better places in town. Taco y taco and tacos el Gordo are a must"}
{"text":"Great food!!! We had quesadillas and burritos which were just awesome! You can see how fresh the ingredients are cause they make the food in front of you. Super friendly staff! You can sit outside, there are a lot of tables."}
{"text":"First meal in the city and lived up to its billing. Had the taco platter with: carnitas & al pastor pork plus barbacoa beef. Fresh onions & cilantro, lime and a great spicy green salsa. Throw in some guacamole and a Modelo beer - it was a perfect start to the trip.

Plus Carlos was super friendly and shared bits of different meats for tasting. Great service."}
{"text":"If I could put zero stars I would. Everything about my experience at this restaurant was horrible. It started off with the employees approach. She did not greet us, possibly due to the fact of intoxication. This girl seemed very out of it to say the least. She did not smile and was not friendly at all. Next, the condition of the food was not appetizing in appearance. The cheese spread had a skin over it that she stirred into the rest of it and then put onto my nachos. The beans were extremely watery and the meat did not look up to temp. I should have known to stop my order at that point but we were starving and I have heard great things about this place. Upon paying for my food she could not manage to figure out how to let me pay half cash and half on my card so I was forced to use all my cash. We then sat down and about three bites into my food I felt my taste buds fighting against me. My body wouldn't even allow me to eat another bite. My boyfriend went up with my barely eaten food and asked for a refund which they denied. They offered to give me two tacos but I didn't want that seeing as how I was not enjoying the food I already had. The manager was completely unprofessional and unapproachable. He was very aggressive and seemed like we were just a bother to him. If you are thinking of trying out this place, don't waste your time. Maybe try the one on the strip I've heard better things about that one."}
{"text":"My husband and I were walking the strip looking for Tacos El Gordo, found out that it was a bit more of a walk than we wanted on a hot day.  Had read the reviews for DJs so we decided to try it out.  No regrets here!  We both just wanted a small something to eat and on their sign all was offered was a taco plate, I asked if we could get four tacos and they didn't flinch and started making our order.  We had two pork and two chicken tacos with their really hot sauce.  They didn't over do the toppings so the flavor of the meat could really came through.  The server was cute when she looked at us rather concerningly when we asked for the super hot sauce and just drizzled it on top.  We got two Bottled no high fructose corn syrup cokes and ate with extreme satisfaction!
My only complaint is that cabbage and cheese, which the tacos honestly don't need, are extra.  
I will definitely go back the next time we visit, maybe that visit I will get a margarita to enjoy with it!"}
{"text":"These guys are great!  Fresh grilled or fried fish tacos for $2.50!! Including all the fixings. The habanero sauce is flavorful and hot.  The mild sauce they make special for the fish tacos is also very good. And they're open all hours.  The manager threw in a couple freshly grilled jalapeños too!  Definitely going back for more."}
{"text":"Best price value for awesome tasting food- you can't really beat $2 tacos! I like my tacos simple with just cilantro and onions and all three meats that I tried were amazing. The al pastor has a strong flavor, the chicken and steak are good as well. I would certainly come back on my next trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"This place doesn't even deserve any stars. The manager that owns this place is a total asshole and talks shit about his customers. Not worth giving them money to keep them in business."}
{"text":"Tacos were cheap and surprisingly fresh- would recommend those for any first timers. Also, had steak fries which took a fair amount of time to prepare. They were okay. You could tell it was a low quality beef.  

I would say this is more of a late night drunk food spot - not sure how late they're open though."}
{"text":"This was simple Mexican takeaway in Las Vegas, nothing special, not terrible! We had a serving of tacos, we couldn't have the fish as they said it would take a while. But the burrito was enjoyed by my partner. A similar place to chipotle but probably not as good."}
{"text":"OMG...the best mexican street style food I've had in ages.  There were 6 in our group. We all had different items...every single one of us was super happy with our choices.  I'm not sure they have anything bad there.
If there's a low spot, and it's not that low, is the seating would be an issue if they were busy.  There is outdoor seating and approximately 20 seats inside. 

Other than that (seating) we would have given this place more the a 5 if possible!

One last thing this was the lowest cost meal we've ever had in Vegas."}
{"text":"The service keeps getting worse & the prices keep going up. I don't get it. Last year my coworkers & I use to eat here all the time. I get that you're on the strip, but trust me the food is not that good. If you want real mexican food go to Tacos El Gordo."}
{"text":"Dammmmnn there Carne Asada Nachos are Bomb!!! Every Vegas trip Djs tacos shop is one of our first stops."}
{"text":"The food here was okay, I had the taco plate.  Maybe for the strip it is good and cheap but in comparison to outside of LV it wouldn't be getting 5 star reviews.  There was nothing wrong with it, but it was not 5 star food."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Green chili marinated pork on sopas, this is real old school homemade Mexican, what my Aunt would cook.

Hot and Spicy salsa, good chips, good rice and beans, jarritos soda and a coke machine. If you want real Mexican food, this IS the place.

Signed up for yelp to post."}
{"text":"I had a carne asada torta here and it was  good. A lot of flavors and the meat was tender. Good views sitting outside. A place to bring the woman you love."}
{"text":"We went there and they didn't have 4 basic things on the menu like fish and NO sour cream
And there was only one other customer so they didn't run out because of a rush."}
{"text":"Best tacos I've had in forever! After a night out on the town my girl and I ordered 17 tacos de al pastor! F*%}in DELICIOSO!! NOM NOM NOM!! Get some, trust me!"}
{"text":"The burrito was amazing! Skip the guacamole though, it's basically just puréed avocado with nothing else in it."}
{"text":"Fraud/Coupon alert!!! Says $15.00 of food/drink for $10.00 but is only 10% off. It's good but not great food with small portions that ended up in a $25.00 bill. Don't let the pictures fool you cos just walk a few feet for a much better deal/value on the Strip."}
{"text":"Really liked this place. We decided to try this place due to the deal they had on yelp. the service was really good and the staff members were all very friendly! you really feel welcomed by them. i personally love their tacos and with the yelp deal, it was an awesome bang for your buck!"}
{"text":"I read a lot of the other comments and they said to get the pork but that dish doesn't exist anymore and there carne Asada is made with some of the cheapest meat ever if I could give zero stars that would be the rating wage of money Coulter even eat the tacos"}
{"text":"This place is a rip off . Veggie burrito with chicken on side for $20. Really? I am not that drunk."}
{"text":"Disappointed given the otherwise positive reviews. 

Fish tacos aren't that hard but when I ordered three, I was told it would be another ten minutes. No problem but when I see what looks like a bag of frozen tilapia (I think it may have been fresh) being pulled out, cut into three minuscule pieces, and slapped on a grill, I'm not excited. Throw in white rice and very plain black beans and I've really lost interest. 

Then, when I'm ready to pay, the price is increased by $1.50 because I ordered the fish. I'm fine with that, but at least put it in your menu board so it is clear. It definitely isn't worth an up charge. 

Bottom line: the flavors of the food were decent (green spicy salsa was good), but I'd rather have La Salsa or Baja Fresh for a cheap taco on the Strip. Also lacked any atmosphere."}
{"text":"High prices for lukewarm food.  Bad attitude from the servers behind the counter.  I work in that area of the Strip and will go hungry before eating there again."}
{"text":"I've been coming for the past week and the girls that have been working for that week has been awesome. They are very helpful and polite and never had a problem with them. They always greet me with a smile and they have amazing customer service. Everytime I come I always leave satisfied. I highly recommend to eat here."}
{"text":"Made it a point to check out these tacos since we were in town.  They're tasty and at a great price for the area.  I wanted to have my mind blown but it just didn't happen.  Staff was really friendly and a good pick for a quick taco fix."}
{"text":"Let me tell yall something..this place is great..the customer service  and food are excellent..it's setup to were u pick a entree and then u select the toppings..they have a variety of sauces (mild to hot) along with lettuce, pico, onions, cheese and cilantro.They also have a variety of taco options. I had the steak quesadilla and it absolutely delicious!!! Would definitely eat here again!!"}
{"text":"I had the carnitas burrito, my husband had the carnitas bowl. Both with the hot sauce, but not the hottest sauce. Service was really friendly, and portions were good but the food itself was greasy and not very flavourful. I've eaten a lot of good and bad Mexican food all over North America and this place is neither. Probably pretty good if you're drunk and it's open late, and again the staff was so nice. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here, but I would if I was hungry and someone I was with wanted to go. I'd just try something different, and a hotter (and extra) sauce. 

For late night on that part of the strip I would recommend secret pizza at the cosmopolitan."}
{"text":"As a Real Mexican from Colima Mex, this place is a 10, real habanero hot sauce, meets have great spices, this place is a gift to Las Vegas.  if your looking for real street tacos look no further."}
{"text":"If you like raw pork tacos, eat here. I will update later if I start throwing up on my plane ride home."}
{"text":"Food wasn't that great, cheese had no flavor at all. The consistency was more of water than cheese. They charged me another item and then it took about half an hour to finally get my money back for that item. Then one of the girls friend/bf decides to just cut to the front of the line and in front of me and starts ordering his food and gets served. And the same girl goes back to sitting with him when there's a huge line. Why is she even working there?"}
{"text":"A neat taco place nestled in a unique plaza area of the strip. Had tasty fish tacos, but had to wait for them. Overall it was good, on the go food."}
{"text":"Awesome !! You will not be disappointed! While certainly not the most expensive meal we ate while in Las Vegas, it was the best we had!"}
{"text":"I had the shaved pork burrito. Simply amazing. Decent prices for the Strip. Awesome staff. If you like street tacos you MUST eat here."}
{"text":"I went to this place, to get an order and nothing was available. I asked for Nachos and there isnt any chips according to the worker. I asked for a taco plate and then he says there is no Rice for that,  and then i asked for churros and of course that wasnt available either. I mean i totally understand you are closing in 30 minutes but the worker there was not friendly did not help anyone who walked in and just plain look like he high off of some drug. To the owner whoever you are get better workers that was completely horrible service that i say multiple customers go thru because if your open then i should be able to get food not an excuse on what you don't, completely pissed me off."}
{"text":"The tacos are hot fire! Excellent deal and perfect for the inevitable munchies that will overtake you at some point during your walk along the strip. Definitely follow the sign-waving lady and enjoy some great street tacos."}
{"text":"Loved everything I had here. The tongue was great. They recommend certain salsas with certain tacos...it's awesome. They are all amazing. Rice and beans were good too"}
{"text":"I would munch on these tacos all day. Had the beef tongue....awesome. Plus the super awesome lady let us sample the meat. Great place, nice peeps. Do it and eat these tacos"}
{"text":"Good spot for quick tacos on the strip!"}
{"text":"DJ's Taco Bar has a similar concept as Chipot. You can choose the type of dish you would like and toppings. We got a bowl and taco platter.  The toppings are fresh and has melt in your mouth flavors. I got two entrees fir under $20 which is not bad restaurants in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Great place to eat. The prices were cheap and the food was pretty good. Our server was very helpful and even gave us some pointers on different ways to maximize our next Vegas trip."}
{"text":"Tacos are okay.  Beans are nasty and price is pretty expensive for shitty tacos. Avoid all cost I'm sure there are better taco place is vegas"}
{"text":"I haven't had a lot of Mexican food in Las Vegas, but I've had a lot of Mexican food! This place has some of the best I've ever had. Add to this the fact that dJs has reasonable prices across the strip from Louis Vitton, and you have a real winner!"}
{"text":"Decent food, the tortilla for the burrito is the size of a pizza crust. They ended up getting pretty busy and only had 3 people working and the order of service was getting confused. I watched my food starting to get cold as they had it staged to be wrapped. It was still ok and a good value but could of been a lot better."}
{"text":"Didn't really have any meat in it , mostly lettuce and cheese and salsa .. Didn't pay attention to my order tortilla was burning while he was talking to friends . what a waster sbarros or panda next time"}
{"text":"I visited DJ's Taco Bar on my last trip to Vegas and just returned for a second time. Both experiences at the Taco Bar were exceptional. No complaints here, some of the cheapest food you can find on the strip and it is tasty. I definitely recommend the $2 tacos with whatever meat of your choosing. Carne Adams fries are amazing as well."}
{"text":"Looking for a great taco joint?  TJ's (it's actually DJ's so idk how that got mixed up, but whatever!) Taco Bar is that place.  The al pastor is amazing!  The barbacoa is also an excellent choice.  Make sure to try their sauces as they are a knock out.  

This is a great place to swing by at any time.  We went four or five times during the week we were in Vegas.  The service isn't always the greatest as it seems their staff isn't that well trained but the food is def worthwhile.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"$2 tacos.. that's pretty amazing prices for anything on the Vegas strip. Taste was pretty good, on point but nothing spectaculr. My complaint is that they wanted to charge extra for every salsa you get. You know how at chipotle you can get hot salsa, corn, pico de gallo all on the same thing? You can't do that here. Extra charge for each salsa"}
{"text":"Didn't have high expectations for this hole in the wall, but the food was outstanding.  There are a ton of options on the strip and a lot of them are garbage, DJs had awesome tacos and burritos, and we went multiple times in a 3-day stint in town."}
{"text":"The food was DELICIOUS!  I ordered a carnitas burrito with spicy beans, rice, cheese, guacamole and sour cream.  Omg!  The meat was of excellent quality, not overly greasy and gelatinous like other Mexican food places' carnitas are.  They were flavored to perfection and in heaping servings.  Definitely worth the $10!  I would no doubt recommend DJ's to anyone visiting the LV Strip.  You WONT be disappointed."}
{"text":"Coming from Los Angeles, Southern California, the mecca of real Mexican food.. this place was just okay to us. We were really craving some tacos and/or burritos and we found this place on Yelp after reading the many reviews. They are kind of located some place where you would never expect them to be. There weren't a lot of people nearby or even in the store so that was kind of surprising. However, if you do happen to go here, I'd just stick with the carne asada. The chicken was subpar to us. Their sauces were okay as well. Customer service stinks - they were on their phones and talking to each other really not minding the customer's needs."}
{"text":"I had the carnitas taco plate. The refried beans had no flavor. The carnitas were just ok. The meal left a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"This place is great, if you read the other positive reviews I would say this place delivers. 20 bucks for a burrito and two big beers. I liked it so much I came here for dinner two days in a row last week."}
{"text":"About a 10 minute walk from planet Hollywood and fairly good Mexican food. For the cost, it was really good. $2 tacos."}
{"text":"Manager has great energy.  Food looked fresh, place looked clean, shared the burrito with two of us.  I would def come back!!"}
{"text":"Late nights in Vegas calls for some Tacos!!! This place has one of the best tacos ever! They have a small menu but I wasn't super hungry so I just got 3 tacos and a HORCHATA!! I had the chicken tacos btw and it was so juicy. There was lots of toppings on it like cilantro, onions, chicken (obviously), and some other stuff. And then the horchata!! Super yummy and refreshing to drink after a night out. Definitely the place to go!"}
{"text":"Great menu, fast, and delicious! Perfect for wanting something quick and cheap! Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Not impressed.  I had barbacoa and carne asada tacos.  They were bland and small.  Nothing special."}
{"text":"Omg. I am in taco heaven! This place is kind of hidden so don't miss it! I wish we would've walked the south end of the strip sooner in our trip and discovered this taco joint earlier...cause guess what I would've eaten all four days in vegas?! It wasn't until the last night of our trip that we finally stumbled upon DJs Taco Bar. The family sitting next to us told us they have been eating there at least once a day for a week now! Anyway, I ordered two of their steak tacos, gulped those down, and went back to order more! Their habanero extra extra spicy sauce is to friggin die for. I asked if I could buy some of this special homemade sauce. She handed me a a small plastic condiment container for 50 cents. No, what I meant was, is this sauce available for purchase in 12 oz bottles?  Lol. They laughed at me. Seriously, they should consider selling their sauce. Omg, my mouth if on fiya thinking about DJs. Again, biggest regret is not discovering this place sooner."}
{"text":"Like Vic G said ... This is the BEST MEXICAN FOOD on the Vegas strip! Get the taco platter or the quesadilla, you will not be disappointed. Seriously, great food, great service and amazing prices seem to not exist on the Vegas strip! DJ Tacos makes it happen folks!!! Tons of options on menu and you can mix up. Example, undecided then have chicken, pork and beef tacos instead of 1 meat option.

Niki K and I hunted this place down for lunch one afternoon. It was hot out and honestly I almost caved in and said forgot about it. So happy I didn't. 

I ordered the taco platter with an old school big bottle of soda. She ordered the quesadilla and same soda!

Man this food is off the hook! Flavorful and finally non hotelish food! I was in utopia... 

The Taco Platter:
- came with 3 tacos rice and beans.
- I choose pork, shredded beef and chicken. All cooked and seasoned well.
- then you have sauces, lettuce and toppings to choose from.

Quesadilla:
- a lovely cheesy and meaty quesadilla slice into 3 huge pieces.
- same choices of toppings and sauces to go inside quesadilla.
- I had to assist mi lady with finishing it. Ha ha

In close all of this with tip was low $20's! I would live here if I returned to Vegas as I love Mexican food and awesome service. Check them out and enjoy people watching on the strip if you decide to eat outside. Enjoy y'all!"}
{"text":"I got the chicken burrito which was darn good. Added cut jalapeno and the hot sauces and boyyy was it spicy! A+ for not watering down the salsa. The chips were not that good though, thought it was not worth the 3 or something bucks. 

Burrito: A, Chips B-"}
{"text":"Fantastic street tacos on the strip of Las Vegas. Now let me tell you why I gave 5 stars...
1. Either the owner or the manager that was there on Wednesday night 07/29/15 was an awesome guy, he talked with us, cleaned up after us and made sure all was good. 
2. It is hard to find inexpensive good food on the strip, you can find mediocre medium priced food and mediocre expensive food and very good expensive food, but he has a gold mine in that little place. Will definitely be back.

Now... To be perfectly honest any street taco I have ever bought is about a buck or buck and a half, he does charge more per taco but you gotta consider where he is located so take that into consideration and enjoy your tacos."}
{"text":"As far as I can see, besides Gordos on the other end, this is the only place that does street style tacos on the Las Vegas strip. But lets not get crazy with the accolades now. These tacos don't come anywhere close to Gordos or even the better places in Los Angeles or San Francisco. Perhaps it satisfies while drunk, but it disappoints while sober."}
{"text":"Had the taco plate. Chicken tacos were beyond my expectations. Wow. Just like the best taco stands in Tijuana. The carne asada taco was a little thick and had a fat chunk in it. I def recommend the pollo tacos. 
You should dine in and enjoy the mural of the Tijuana border. It's a great mural I assume of a famous painting."}
{"text":"Place was awesome. Me and my brochacho walk in drunk and ask two of the coolest employees ever to make us what they typically eat and guess what, the food was pretty dang awesome. This happened approximately 15 mins ago and for sure plan to go back"}
{"text":"Best street tacos that I've had that aren't from KC! Nice to know there is a place that truly has authentic Mexican tacos and they stay true to that! Shout to the night crew especially Rico and Angela! Ya'll made my tacos de pescado THE BEST I have had in a very long time and I am an avid eater! My friends if you are ever in on Las Vegas strip check them out! The two dollar tacos are WAY under priced for the quality of food you get! Shout to good food, good people, and great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Decent little place to grab fast and cheap food. Fast, friendly service, they let me try tastes of a few meats first to see what I liked best. Only complaint was that the Carne Asada meat was kind of gristley. Would definitely go back, but maybe try the Barbacoa next time."}
{"text":"Nothing special. Food is bland. Salsa is generic tasting. 
Customer service is mediocre.
They do like to nickel and dime. Careful sour cream is extra. Oh and so are refills. 
The Horchata is great."}
{"text":"Went here today while shopping at galleria mall and to my surprise the tacos were really good! I'm a taco snob and man the meat was very tender and they have so many salsas! The tacos are only $2 each can't beat that in a food court. If you like spicy you have got to try their habeñero salsa it was soooo yummy"}
{"text":"If I could give this place less than one star I would.... Don't come to this place expecting real Mexican food like I did. This is a cheap version of Chipotle that costs more. $10 for a burrito. 

I went in looking to order a burrito and the only worker there said there was no rice. So I couldnt order the tacos with rice/beans. I asked since they're out of rice if they could put a couple fries in my burrito instead. He said no- no substitutions.  

If you're going to run out of rice then be accomadating at least-especially for $10/burrito. 

My point is it's not legit Mexican."}
{"text":"Great tacos!  Had the pork and it was amazing.  The hot salsa was awesome.  You can't beat the price. The grilled jalapeno was one of the hottest I have ever experienced.    If I have one bad thing to say, it is that the server behind the register did not understand English.  I had to point at the menu for everything.  Otherwise, skip the oh so expensive strip Hotel/casino restaurants, this beats it hands down."}
{"text":"Very delicious tacos. The pastor had the right amount of fat and flavor. They give you a lot of meat. The salsa he recommended complimented it well and had the right amount of kick. The carne asada was good but nothing compared to the pastor. The tortillas were cooked perfectly and soft to the bite. My friends got the fried chicken next door and were highly disappointed in their meal. Don't go there! Go here."}
{"text":"Food is NOT worth the price. $40 for my boyfriend and I to both eat 2 tacos, chicken quesadilla, and a medium drink. The tacos are okay, I've had better ones in a 'hole in the wall' place. By the time I got to eat the chicken quesadilla, it was cold. So overrated."}
{"text":"Habanero salsa was delicious, the service was fast and friendly and not a busy place so we could sit and eat comfortably! Also, huge portions for the quesadillas and burritos."}
{"text":"Great place to eat some good tacos if you are  at the strip. Habanero salsa was spicy enough for me."}
{"text":"Great place to eat if you want something fast, cheap, and delicious on the Las Vegas Strip.  The fiancé liked it here so much we had DJ's twice in one day!  From the two visits, we got a chance to try their tacos, nachos, burrito, and churros.  ALL the meats were cooked to tender perfection and flavored wonderfully.  LOVE the churros--they're cooked to order so you get them piping hot!  Awesome value in Vegas (especially if you lost a few Benjamins gambling like I did)!"}
{"text":"Large portions. Good food. Quick. Good salsa.  We stop here next time and recommend it to everybody. Large burrito is about $10. 3 taco plate under $10."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Alfred Montilla makes you feel like your family. Most definitely coming back again"}
{"text":"My first experience at DJS Tacos was almost two years ago.  The experience was good enough to brag about and try for a second time.  Apparently sometime  in between the two years this place started to tumble apart.  

I've been visiting Las Vegas twice a year since 2006.  My worst dining experience out of 20 visits to Las Vegas was at DJS Tacos.  The service is absolutely horrible.  This is a Wednesday evening in February with zero people in line.  It took several minutes to get acknowledged, and after finally being acknowledged the rude gentleman takes my order and walks away for several minutes.  My best guess is he was heating up the tortillas.  I'm not 100 percent certain since he just stomped away.  Leaving you wondering if he is coming back and if I was possibly talking to a brick wall.

After taking his time the same gentleman comes back with a lady.  She asks my wife what kind of meat she would like for her tacos....However she made is clear they had no pastor, carne asada, chicken, or fish.  For a place that was dead as a door knob you think they'd prepare better. 

The beef tounge was sitting in water and full of fat. The lady acknowledged it was a bad piece as she unpleasantly picked away at it.  It was agreed they would cut up a better piece, but they still served us the tounge we asked them not to. Tounge was shredded instead of cut into pieces.  Actually more like ripped apart ......The carnitas sat in oil and basically taste like a ball of grease.  The barbecoa might as well be carnitas because they taste the same.

This was a very unpleasant experience and deserves no further business from me. 

Management should take a look at what is happening to this restaurant before it takes a fall to the face.  The staff can make or break I decent establishment."}
{"text":"Really good food and affordable - for the strip. Employees were also very nice & accommodating. Didn't wait in line & sat in air conditioning. Perfect place for a quick, cheap place to eat."}
{"text":"So I gave three stars for the quality of the food for the price. Food was great and for $10 a plate, that's awesome! Minus one star for the seating. Although they have ample seating outside, it's winter and freezing. Who can enjoy a meal when you're shivering? There was seating inside but very minimal for how busy they are. Minus another star for the service. The guys working there had no personality and I've literally received better customer service at a Jack in the Box. There are wayyyyyy too many places to eat in Vegas to have crappy customer service. I suppose if you've spent all your money gambling and shopping and all you really have is $10, then this spot will do."}
{"text":"Street tacos on the Vegas strip. Yum (:

Not too much you can say about street taco's other than if they hit the spot or not.  These did hit the spot.

The reviews comparing DJ's to Chipotle crack me up!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this while walking the strip.  BEST MENUDO I've ever had!  Super clean.  Great prices and pretty authentic.  Definitely will satisfy your craving for mexican food at non-strip prices."}
{"text":"For mall food, its not bad.

They do have a few different  proteins to choose from... i chose the shredded beef or barbacoa for tacos. The gal gave me about 5 or 6 chips, and let me chose which salsa I would like for them. .. went for the salsa verde. 

I added cilantro, onions, and sour cream to my tacos. Looking back, i wish i would have added more things... like cheese. Because  when i sat down, they were definitely  missing something. The meat was tender...but flavor wise..... it was lacking. 

3 mini tacos and some chips will set you back around $8."}
{"text":"Im a local Vegan and my bf knows how much I love Mexican tacos. Mmmm We are traveling to the strip to eat it. It's our new date spot. LOL Very affordable and very savory. We had nachos and 4 tacos for less than $20. It wassss soooo good!"}
{"text":"Terrible service, poor food, those are not Mexican tacos at all. Really disapointed. I do not why is rated 2nd best Mexican in las Vegas it should not even appear, this is a bad version of a fast food taco franchised. Dont go ever!!!"}
{"text":"Stumbled on this small taco joint while walking down the strip. Needed a quick bite to hold me over until dinner so I  decided to stop in for a taco or two. I ended up ordering one barbacoa taco with salsa, guac, cheese, and lettuce. Surprisingly the taco was super good so I ordered a second. 

The price point was good as well. 2 tacos was $6. Would definitely recommend! Next time in Vegas I will be stopping by."}
{"text":"I thought the tacos here were just alright. The main issue is that the meats (beef/pork) we had weren't seasoned very well. Also, the fried fish taco looked and tasted just like a fish stick. 

Also, the rice and beans that came with the taco plate weren't seasoned very well either. 

The majority of the seating is outside, and the inside seating is very very casual to the point where they probably could a bit more with the ambiance. On my next stop back in Las Vegas I'll find another spot for tacos."}
{"text":"The best tacos in Las Vegas.  The service is is as awesome as the food!"}
{"text":"I got the Steak taco and the shredded pork taco.   My hubby got an horchata he says the drink was a 3 1/2 out of 5. I still ranked this place a 5 because my tacos were great!!  I will warn you they are petite tacos but they are packed with flavor."}
{"text":"Man, after an hour of walking the Strip checking out the freaks, whores, scammers and fat tourists like myself these tasty little devils hit the spot. Tried the asada, carnitas and al pastor tacos and all were good. Typical street taco tortilla filled with some way savory and succulent meats. Would've awarded 5 stars if they were $1 instead of $2. I am the taco terminator and yes homie.....\"I will be back\"."}
{"text":"Sopes are so delicious and reasonably priced. Habanero salsa was so spicy my friend was sweating under her eyes, in a good way!"}
{"text":"This place has decent street tacos. Just decent, not amazing. Maybe good for Vegas but you can get way better on the streets of LA, San Diego or Phoenix for sure. Carne asada was cooked well but under seasoned. Grilled fish needed salt too. Fried fish was good though, well seasoned, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. That being said, carne asada is the measuring stick for street tacos and this place is just meh...

So, decent food - 3 stars worthy I would say. Then why two stars? Because they treat you like you're inconveniencing them when you go in there. One guy wouldn't even look at me and my wife as we stood and waited to order. Took the order of the people in front of us in line then walked away without so much as acknowledging our presence. When someone finally did acknowledge us to take our order, he was short with us and kinda yell-talked at us as if we were on his last nerve. I'm a nice person and I go out of my way to treat people with respect, if I'm spending money at a place, I expect at least some of that in return and, street food or not, you won't get it at DJ's. Not going back."}
{"text":"Found this little gem one night when my bf & I were walking the strip and craved some homemade Mexican food. Yelp had great reviews for this spot AND had a $10 for $15 deal. We just couldn't resist. So we bought it.

We actually visited DJ's Tacos the day after (Sunday 1/5/14) around lunch time. It's located in a small plaza, I believe it's called Hawaiian Plaza or something along those lines. Small establishment but the quality of the food definitely makes up for it big time. 

I ordered a taco plate (includes 3 tacos, rice and beans) for $8.95. I chose carne asada tacos, while my man ordered a carne asada burrito ($9.95) and 5 additional tacos ($2 each). I would say the rice and beans portions were a little on the skimpy side. But the carne asada tacos were delicious! They were tender and juicy, full of flavor. ¡Que Sabor! Everything is made to your liking from your choice of beans to toppings (cilantro, onions, etc) to salsa (pico de gallo, jalapeño sauce, etc). The food is really fresh and yummy. Sorta reminds me of chipotle but less franchise-y and more authentic Mexican food. Did I mention that the tortillas are hand made?! Yep, quality. Also, they have one of those digital soda fountain dispenser and horchata as well. Lastly, they have this awesome mural of Tijuana that takes up one entire wall of the restaurant. It is so interesting and dramatic. It's one of those neat little features that makes this place special. 

The customer service is great, too. The two ladies who helped us out were patient and made everything to our liking. They were friendly and honored our yelp deal. This place is awesome, but only reason why it gets 4 stars is because the prices are a bit steep and portions run on the small side

Other than that,  this place hits the spot! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Not bad for the price on the strip. I don't eat Mexican food often but this hits the spot when I have a craving for it. Just wish I didn't have to walk to it otherwise I would go more often"}
{"text":"Need a quick and cheap snack without going off the strip? Definitely check this place out! Located in the shopping center where the new Chili's is being built, DJ's is on the corner. 

Cheap $2 tacos that you can customize with the traditional cilantro/onion/hot sauce, you can choose to add other fixin's, cheese, lettuce, etc.

Note: the habanero hot sauce is indeed hot, they had a habanero pepper just marinating in there and the sauce is normally served on the side. 

At $2 a taco, this was a great deal for food on the strip"}
{"text":"they were just on Dirty Dining, now with a C grade... kitchen disgusting.  don't eat there unless you want to get sick."}
{"text":"Good quality ingredient for nachos and burritos, like a qdoba. Had a 10% off deal for checking on on yelp and had a $10 for $15 deal."}
{"text":"I stopped by here on a recent trip to Vegas.  One afternoon we were tried of the expensive and heavy meals and decided some cheap tacos sounded perfect.  There was a little bit of a line, but it went fast.  I got the taco plate with rice and beans, opting for beef, but they had lots of options they all looked good.  My husband got just fish tacos.  We enjoyed all the tacos, the rice and beans were bland.  There was plenty of room outside to sit.  Not the best tacos you will ever have (at least not when compared to Texas), but I recommend it for a nice, quick, cheaper meal if you get tired of all the fancy, excess of Vegas or need a good hangover cure."}
{"text":"Great if you're trying to find Mexican food on the strip. Price is like going to Chipotle but it is more authentic. ($7-$12 range/entree)  I had the carne Asada burrito. Was expecting more flavor and authenticity."}
{"text":"DJ's Taco Bar is a neat little Mexican food joint in the middle of the Strip in the Hawaiian Marketplace Shopping Center. When hungry, the food and drinks here can hit the spot in between being out and about in Vegas. Overall, not a bad option for a quick bite of some street tacos.

PROS:
-tasty taco: barbacoa ;D 
-awesome salsa
-central location
-entertainment available at Hawaiian Marketplace's center stage= live music!
-plenty of seating outside
-good service
-decent pricing
-ice cold beer 

CONS:
-sold out of puerco al pastor! (I wanted pork no bueno.. had to settle for chicken)
-bland pollo al pastor! =["}
{"text":"Quick service, cheap tacos and I didn't get sick!! This was probably the best find I've ever had in Vegas!! If I'm walking that way I'm sure I will make a stop for another $2 taco to keep me sober on my Las Vegas Strip walk lol...."}
{"text":"Pretty decent place to stop and get a quick bite.

They are very generous with the fillings. The steak and chicken was well seasoned and tender. Everything looked pretty clean and well maintained.

The space is small, so if you see available seating take advantage of it.

The prices are pretty reasonable and the guys that were working here were pretty friendly."}
{"text":"We were in Vegas a few weeks ago and tried out this little place. It's a small place that packs a big punch. We ordered the chicken and fish tacos with the onion and cilantro. Let me just say, the fish tacos were the best I have ever had. I asked the server to put the hot salsa for the first order that I placed for my group, assuming how hot could it really be!?! Mind you, we are all spice junkies and I can handle a lot of heat. These tacos set our mouths on fire... But it was too good to stop. We ordered a couple more rounds of tacos and ate till we were all satisfied. Even the woman at the cash register was really friendly!

The only reason I gave this place four stars was because on the last day of our trip we came here for lunch as I was craving that fish taco. The lunch line was a little long and I patiently waited. As soon as I got to the server, I asked for fish tacos...and I was denied. I informed the guy that I didn't mind waiting but he wouldn't budge :(. I had to settle for the chicken tacos instead. 

We were in Vegas for three days and ate at this joint three times. That tells you how much we loved this place. DJ's tacos are out of this world!! For two dollars, you can't beat this place. Do you dare to try the hot salsa?"}
{"text":"I had the carne asada fries and by the end of the night, I was sick to my stomach. Not food poisoning - the oil that was used to cook the fries must have been either dirty or old. Husband had the nachos and I had some of his chips, so I know it was the oil. 

I did like the flavors, though, and I would probably return if I had an urge for tacos while in Vegas. That said, living in LA means access to the best tacos around, so the chances of my getting tacos in Vegas are slim."}
{"text":"We stumbled across the Hawaiian Marketplace while walking down the strip.  Very happy to have discovered DJ's bc they have legit authentic Mexican food.  Not only is the food delicious, the portions are plenty and you can get away with a hearty meal for less than $10.  For Vegas, this is a steal.  While most other cheap eats in the area only include chain fast food joints, DJ's is a good alternative if you want something outside of the casino.  The staff at DJ's is also super friendly so you can't go wrong.  They even have a 10% off check in deal on yelp! 

The other half and I both decided on getting taco plates.  This includes 3 street tacos with your choice of meat and toppings and beans and rice.  I was very happy to see lengua on the menu as you only find this is authentic Mexican eateries.  I chose lengua (beef tongue), carnitas and pollo al pastor for my three tacos.  My only regret was not getting all lengua because it was so good!  Lengua was tender and flavorful.  The other half got carne asada on his tacos.  Everything else was what you would expect in street tacos.  What we loved about the black beans is that they were unseasoned.  Plain, simple food is what we like and it works!  We saw someone order the sopes and vowed to return the next day to give it a try but ended up on the other side of the strip, so didn't get to try that out (darn).  Overall, great taqueria on the strip.  Food is solid and it's a great place to eat if you want a hearty meal without having to spend much."}
{"text":"Hands down the best tacos you could ever eat for decent price ($2 per taco) and worth it! Great eats while passing through the strip! Makes for a perfect late night \"light\" bite"}
{"text":"An absolute must-eat if you're walking the Strip and looking for a generous, quick & tasty meal at a great price ($2 taco special). The Yelp check-in offer was another percentage off the total bill which was a nice surprise, so remember to check in!

Basically ordered one of each of the main proteins: carnitas, asada, lengua, al pastor, and was happy with all of them. The house habanero salsa is fantastic - not too spicy - one of the best-balanced habanero salsas I've experienced.

Great to see such enthusiasm behind the taco counter - turning & burning with smiles and big scoops of taco filling. Do try to keep it street-taco-simple with cilantro & onion only or you will get charged extra (for pico de gallo, cheese, et al).

Way to go, DJ!"}
{"text":"Authentic street tacos. Inexpensive. We tried one of each type of meat. Loved the habanero salsa. It has a nice bite. They even have a few varieties of cervezas."}
{"text":"Decent food, disorganized staff. The ordering line could be comparable to Chipotle in size, variety and method; however, the staff preparing the food seemed overwhelmed and confused, customers had to yell over others or some standing in others way while waiting on whatever they ordered. The food line workers also yelled quite a bit, which is a personal pet peeve. The prices are great though, $8 per dish and it was quite flavorful. No air conditioning inside, seating with those misting fans outside, closest restrooms are in the creepy, rundown foodcourt building near that area."}
{"text":"I loved this place for their tacos All pastor use to be my favorite here. I went 2 times in the last month. Each time I got old al pastor heated up,way too much on the grill. 
I almost broke my tooth the second time. The old owner use to do a wonder job. The Alpastor use to be cut straight from the trompo that spins.
I will never eat there again!"}
{"text":"This place was honestly disappointing. The reviews said it was good but honestly it was not. Made my stomach hurt after eating tacos there. If your craving tacos I recommend tacos el gordo. They even have free transportation to and from the restaurant."}
{"text":"Awesome cheap food and a great staff.  I was amazed on how good the food was and I can't wait to go back when I'm actually drunk and/or hungover.  The manager is really cool and their food was really fresh.  The salsa was actually spicy and it definitely burned on the way out."}
{"text":"Now this little place in tucked right in the corner in between Planet Hollywood, going southbound in between \"little Hawaii\" and/or The Harley Davidson \"Best BBQ in Las Vegas\" sign. They have $2 tacos, or the 3 combo tacos with everything except Guacamole.   The meat was tender, flavorful, plentiful, and the salsa was fresh, both the green and red salsas were spicy as they said. I had 1 tear come out my right eye. It was a delicious meal under $10 ON THE STRIP.   Outside the restaurant, people were singing karaoke, selling t-shirts with speaker attached and colored stereo waves, and \"cheap souvenirs, and 2 for $1 waters (cold). I suppose it is a festive island, you can easily walk through, but should stop!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness so glad we took a chance on this little place!  I ordered the grilled fish taco plate and Hubbs ordered the beef tongue taco plate.  Both plates were very tasty, just enough to fill you and make you smile!  While there we sat outside and just enjoyed the breeze and sounds.  Will come back again for sure!"}
{"text":"I got the carne asada nachos with guacamole omg sooo good! It just needed a pinch of salt, other than that it was perfect!"}
{"text":"Decent, affordable real Mexican food on the strip.  The food is just pretty good, easily the best affordable food on the Strip."}
{"text":"This place deserves no stars. We went earlier In the day and checked out their food and we were so excited to come back because we going out later in the evening, and they were going to be open until 4am. We came back at 3:30am. They were already closed and almost done counting the cash. We were motioning that the sign says four and they just shrugged their shoulders. It is crucial when you visit Vegas that you enjoy the night life and want to eat after. So disappointed and the fact that they closed up super early, is ridiculous. They just need to change the hours if they aren't going to stay open. Bad customer service and leaves a bad taste."}
{"text":"Had trouble finding the location for this place. Its next to Harley davidson and Hawaiian market place. If youre on Aria, Cosmo or bellagio side take the air cross walk in front of the cosmo.

Good food, good price and no wait!"}
{"text":"Only 2 workers. Came at 1145 am, their food prep area was not ready. They didn't have lime or lemon for the tacos. Disappointed."}
{"text":"The food was okay...... I would've put another star if the customer service was better. The guy's working in the back were rude and not very helpful when I asked them a question about the their food they just looked at me like I was dumb......Other then that I recommend going to Tacos El Gordo  for legit street tacos they use better tortillas."}
{"text":"I came here over the weekend bc the reviews said how good the food was. I got the bowl and the 3tacos. The food was okay but definitely not spectacular. I felt the meat was lacking some spices. Ingredients was fresh but lacking."}
{"text":"DJs is a nice find on The Strip - what appears to be a non chain spot in an outdoor food court a little bit on the quiet side because it is set back from the street.

Add in the 10% off Yelp check-in deal and you have yourself a winner. 

The tacos were not the best I have ever had, but they were a step above what you would expect to find in a mall food court.  At 2am I guarantee they would be nothing short of amazing."}
{"text":"Terrific quality of food and good prices. But assembled like slop. They should portion the food on their tacos more logically."}
{"text":"Ate here the other night for dinner. Excellent street tacos with great flavor and tortillas made to order. Friendly staff working the counter and till. If you're looking for something to eat without a huge price tag and worth your stop, take a step to this place and eat up! Get the habanero salsa!"}
{"text":"Stopped by on a whim while looking for some fast eats one day. It was AMAZING! 3 of  us had a quesadilla, tacos, and a bowl. It's like Chipotle, only 100x better. Everything was so fresh, the tortillas were especially good. Came back later that night for more tacos after a few drinks. Then came back again for another quesadilla and more tacos the next day. Also came back again the following day and had a burrito -- that was delicious too. All of the meats were good: barbacoa, carnitas, steak and chicken. And if you like spicy food, get a jalapeno! They really kick your butt after a few bites. SO DELICIOUS. We were there 5 days, ate there 5 times over 4 days. Now it's my first day back and I want some more. TJ's, please come to the East Coast!!!

oddly enough they also had hot dogs for $1. and also menudo for hangovers, which i did not try but would if i went back and had a hangover!

until we meet again...drool..."}
{"text":"Great food for its location! The meats are very well done and authentic. Their salsa is spicy perfect for my taste! I really recommend. The tacos that i got were super big and stuffed with whatever it is you want on them...:)"}
{"text":"Some of the best tacos I've ever tried. Many salsas to choose from but the best is their homemade special sauce. Pour it all over your tacos, throw a jalapeno in there and you'll be in food heaven. Their micheladas are also off the hook!"}
{"text":"3 tacos for less than $5!! (including the 10% check in discount). Awesome! YOu really can't beat the price, especially in Las Vegas. I had carne asada, grilled fish (freshly made), and pork. All delicious! Yes, the location might not be like the Wynn or Bellagio, but when I am craving Mexican tacos, this is where I'm going! Definitely recommend to anyone on a tight budget."}
{"text":"Food was indeed very good and very reasonably priced. We each had a taco plate ( three tacos any kind, plus rice and beans) for $8.95. On the strip in Las Vegas! Grilled fish tacos were as good or better than anywhere ever. My puerto al pastor and pollo al pastor tacos were also excellent."}
{"text":"If you are visiting vegas and tired of spending $20 on hotdog and fries at the hotels THEN this is the place you need to go so YOU CAN SAVE MONEY AND EAT GOOD!

Best quesadilla ever!! So it's setup like chipotle were u can add your own toppings. 
Also the quesadilla is HUGE!!!! You have ample choices of meat to choose from, veggies and rice and cheeses.

The food was muy bien...the price was right considering what Vegas was charging to eat at these other places. The service is quick, place is clean and ample drinks to choose from.

Believe me you wont be disappointed by eating here."}
{"text":"i will say i would never eat here again food is nasty i saw reviews and was like ok lets try it yelpers was say this place is the best they must havent really been to a alot of mexican places which is sad i went with about five ppl and nobody liked there food greasy and no flavor dont waste your time here."}
{"text":"I will admit the tacos are pretty good .. The salsas are delicious .. All in all great food.. The price is a bit high since they are so good you can't eat just three.. And the portions can sometimes be small as they do limit the amount of meat and toppings on them .. But no matter what they are worth every penny! The staff is super friendly... Will definitely return for more!"}
{"text":"Pretty good, but not great food. Workers were very friendly and the place was clean which was a plus."}
{"text":"I had the chicken quesadilla, the chicken was a bit dry, it wasn't as juicy, but the guac and chips was really good!"}
{"text":"Great location but the meat is quite greasy and the rice is a bit stale. They ran out of one kind of meat which was a bit of a negative. Price wise at $9.95 for 3 tacos, rice and beans it was a steal for the strip."}
{"text":"Delicious. Anything else I add to this review would just be fluff. Delicious and reasonably priced sums it up. No inside seating, basically fast food and there are tables outside in the foot court common area. We ate there pretty late so it was cool with a breeze. Dress accordingly."}
{"text":"Come here for lunch. Come here for dinner. Come here after a drunken wander down the strip. Come here the next morning for breakfast.

Get the taco plate. Get the carne asada fries.  Get the Horchata, add tequila to the horchata outside (if you're of age, of course).

During our 4 day stay in vegas, we ate 3 meals here, 2 of which were on the same day.  The food is great, it's cheap, it's filling and fresh.  There's a nice seating area outside."}
{"text":"I felt like went to Mexico Tijuana when walking in to this small Mexican restaurant; the counter, setup, table & chairs, wall painting of US & Tijuana border. Owner is Mexican. Lots of good foods. We just did the soft taco sampler, very authentic Mexican foods. Recommended to try there!"}
{"text":"Great spot for good Mexican food. Tacos are in the style of the Los Angeles streets. The lengua was my favorite. Ate here for breakfast, lunch, and late night. They close earlier than their posted hours sometimes, so plan accordingly."}
{"text":"The people are nice, and it's cheap. But the food is not worth the price at all. I ordered a 3 taco plate with rice and beans. There was little flavor with everything and the tacos were so tiny. I am visiting here from San Francisco so I guess I have higher expectations for tacos. This place was a solid 3 stars for the service, food, and convenience together, which isn't bad at all - just don't come in with any expectations."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed. Good friend. Friendly staff. Took great care of us.  The food was really good. Being from Texas im picky about my Mexican food. Carnitas are amazing."}
{"text":"The michelada here was on point and so was the Mexican food. Tasted pretty authentic!"}
{"text":"A small super cool taco joint. Hidden in sin city. Along the crazy, lively strip. Here I was away from everyone and everything. So relaxing! With one of my most favorite people in the world. My 1 and only bro!!! 

\"You gotta try these tacos!\" He insisted. We walked Lord knows how many blocks from Treasure Island. But it was worth it. 

My brother is a serious Mexican food lover. I guess all us siblings are. But he out does us all. He's also a DJ. (DJ Taco Bar). It couldn't be anymore clearer than that. Hahhaaaa.

We ordered fish tacos. They came loaded with all the yummy goodness. You get to choose what you want on your Taco. They prep the way you like it. 

We snuggled into a table seat. And chowed sinful tacos. Ohhhh the only downer was the soggy tortilla. Whoopsie Doopsie.

But everything else: \"Perfecto\" 

Yeah I kno...
You eat fish tacos every Tuesday. 

Psssst... (whispering) but these are sinful Tacos. Hehe. 

Enjoy!
Best Tacos in Vegas...so far!"}
{"text":"Good food, decent prices, rude service. 

If you looking for some cheap and greasy (in a good way) Mexican food when on the strip  this place is good. Quick and easy and cooked to order. 

The service was pretty rude. They expect you to speed through the line so they can get to the next person.  They treat you like you have been there before and should know everything. 

All in all I would come back, actually we are in town for another day so we might be back tomorrow."}
{"text":"**Updating Review after Manager Eli contacted me. I really am surprised at the quick response and how professional Eli was. This is how small business should be, always looking to improve. I admire that and will definitely return in the near future to give it a try again. 

Probably not the best tacos you can get for the price. Maybe I was overhyped from yelp but I was disappointed. Ordered the 3 Tacos Combo with Rice and Beans for about $10. Tortilla had a stale taste, carne asada was dry and flavorless. Didn't care for their rice and beans. Thought it was pretty expensive compared to most authentic Mexican food trucks that tastes wayyy better! It could be a slow night and what we ended up with were cold leftovers. Not sure if I would come back to try it again. :("}
{"text":"Place has limited seating. 
$2 or $2.5 tacos but the combos are pricey. 
Meat was too greasy / sitting in oil. 
Did not have the pork on the spit roast. Out of grilled fish as well. One of the guys didn't speak English well and he sees to get a little frustrated but got the order in. The other guy wasn't mr happy but a decent experience. I think these guys are having growing pains with its growing popularity so it seems they are taking short cuts. Whatever made them a 4 star place is now gone."}
{"text":"Food isn't bad and it is VERY filling. I got the burrito with carne and a bunch of different toppings. Was pretty sad about there not being any sour cream, but the horchata made up for that! Definitely recommend this place, as it isn't as crowded as a lot of the other restaurants on Fremont."}
{"text":"WARNING! Possible nut contamination at this location! Be sure to ask your wait staff about any nuts in your order. 

TLDR:
-NUTS AND THE WAIT STAFF DON'T EVEN KNOW!!!!

Food:
Asada tacos (~$2) NUT ALERT!!
-Decent fix at the wee hours of post-partying. Very typical style tacos. Nothing too crazy. 

Carne Asada Fries POSSIBLE NUT ALERT!!!
-Perfect for post-partying gluttony. They use your basic fries that are more on the soggy than crisp side. Large order with classic toppings like guac, sour cream and salsa! I'd recommend this! 

Unfortunately:
-The tacos for sure contained some form of nuts. We asked the staff behind the counter multiple times about nuts and nut oils and they reassured us they didn't not use any nut items. Not a fun way to spend the night after long hours of clubbing. Two members of our party have a fairly serious history with nut allergies and both of them got sick. =( since the reaction happened after a few bites of the taco, we're not 100% sure on the fries. Be wary! 

Drinks:
They have your basic soft drinks. 

Service:
Call before you show up. They weren't open the first time we tried to come even though they were 'Open' according to yelp. 

View/environment:
Conveniently on the strip. 

Parking: 
Nonexistent. Walk here."}
{"text":"Place was amazing ....real street authentic tacos, burritos, quesadilla , steak fries platter, etc .Really friendly people and everything is fresh.  Went 3 days In a row and still can't get enough!"}
{"text":"I went here my first visit to Las Vegas and omg there are no words for how delicious and full of flavor their food is. The meat is very tender and juicy. I had tacos barbacoa and pastor. Also their chorizo was wonderful. You have to try this authentic Mexican food while you are in the area. The tortillas are hand made fresh. You definitely won't regret it. Also try their orchata (rice water)"}
{"text":"I was there about a year and a half ago, the food was great.  So we were there just a few days ago and we ordered carne asada fries, and I was not disappointed. Food was very tasty. I'll recommend it. The restaurant is in the Hawaiian Marketplace Plaza."}
{"text":"We stopped in here for a quick lunch on a Tuesday in August. We picked up some tacos and ate in the little seating area outside. The food was cheap and delicious. They had lots of options for different meats and salsas. I got chicken, barbacoa, and carne asada tacos all with the red hot salsa. Everything tasted good, and it was nice to get a quick, cheap, tasty lunch right on the Vegas Strip."}
{"text":"Amazing and the service here is phenomenal (james)  and so is the food..... definitely a spot to hit... open super late and doesn't disappoints."}
{"text":"Yummmmmmm!

DJ's Taco Bar popped up on my Yelp when we were looking for a good place to check out in Vegas and I'm glad we stopped here.  We were obviously newbies and the guy behind the counter was a huge help.  He recommended two meats (so we could try more than one) on our nachos and they were both delish.  We went with the chicken and barbacoa and they were both perfectly cooked.  We let the guy dress our nachos how the regulars do it and everything was fresh and went great together.  I don't think there's a wrong choice coming here.   

While we were pigging out on our nachos, a guy asked us how the tacos were... We laughed and said, \"Well, it's our first time here but these nachos are legit! Let us know how the tacos are!\" He walked out after eating and said, \"Tacos were the bomb.  Get them next time!\" 

I think that speaks for itself.  Yum! :)"}
{"text":"I don't know why this place got raving reviews. Is this the only place in the strip that serves Mexican food within a 40 mile radius? The food was completely average, teetering to below-average levels. They ran out of fish in the early hours of the evening so I never got to try it. Now I don't know if the fish is the saving grace of the taco bar but if it's mediocre, like the rest of the stuff I ordered (from the burritos to the tacos), I would go to a chipotle instead. The location's also a big minus."}
{"text":"No guacamole no avocado no problem but my heart did break a little. The taco salad bowl was delicious! The lady who served me my black beans should've let the sauce drip first instead of making it sog up the crunchiness in the base, or at least add rice in the base of the bowl so the beans can be absorbed in the rice. The crunchy tortilla as a bowl was worth every bite along with the fresh veggies and green sauce with lemon. I topped it off with a jamaica drink. Altogether the price was around $6 not bad not bad at all."}
{"text":"It's a new spot an it's so effin' great! Came here last night and had their tacos. It was so good that I had to order a burrito. Then the next morning I just had to go back and order some more before I left The Strip. I ordered 3 carne asada tacos and a whole burrito again! Def give it a shot and help support this new business or just give them your opinions here on Yelp! Another good thing is they cut the meat right in front of you when you order it. B-E-A-U-tiful!"}
{"text":"Skip this joint. May be worth it to get $2 tacos from the window but we got taco plates. The rice was so hard and burnt it was inedible. The refried beans were flavorless. The tacos were decent but everything looked like it had been sitting out all day. Not worth $10."}
{"text":"We were hungry and this place was literally next door to our hotel so we though why not! Its very hole in the wall place and a drunk person paradise for food. Unfortunately I wasnt drunk so food was just okay. We spent over $50 bucks and I have no idea what we even got. I pretty sure everyone was still hungry. The staff was awesome though! They were pleasant about our huge order of like 20 tacos boxing it up real nice for us. By the way the tacos were small!! I had a nimble because I felt like it wasnt enough food for 10 people. For $2 a taco I expect it to be much bigger."}
{"text":"Good food, great prices... Indoor/outdoor seating. Will definitely visit again...maybe even come back for dinner. The staff was pleasant and the place was clean!"}
{"text":"Waited for them to open,walk in and they don't have al pastor. What's the point of promoting it if it's not available. And the other meats were probably heated from yesterday 
The grills didn't  look like they were even on. Heading to Tacos el gordo"}
{"text":"I stumbled up to the strip from Motel 6 just to try one of these tacos.  It was well worth the steps and stumbles.  You get 3 tacos and the choices are amazing.  I ordered 1 al pastor and told the nice lady to give me the most popular for the other 2.  There are about 9 choices of fillings, 8 or 9 salsas, and then any popular taco topping.  The best part is that they do have cervesa (beer).  I pulled up to a table out in the common area and enjoyed.  I really forgot what other flavor tacos I had, but I can tell you that they were all fresh, and spiced very well.  I will be back on my next trip.  P.S.- Don't go to the foot massage place there in the plaza, its creepy!"}
{"text":"Food was mediocre. One of the employees behind the register was cussing the entire time I was paying. How ghetto and unprofessional."}
{"text":"I got 3 chicken tacos that came with tortilla chips $6.99. It was okay. Meal didn't  come with a drink which was $1.99 extra which is pure profit and makes the meal overpriced. Would not return."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service! Food may be good, but I won't be going back ever! Happy new year"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night. All the workers provided great, fast customer service including the cashier, Angela, and the rest of the night crew. Which is a surprise because usually when you go places to eat the cashiers are the most distracted and don't care whether you eat there again or not! Good place to go if you're looking for good, quality tasting Mexican food ! Next time I'm in town I, definitely, know the place to come and eat."}
{"text":"It works like a Chipotle-type line. Definitely get the burrito. And the hot sauces are spicier than normal (this is coming from a guy who love spicy food)."}
{"text":"$13 for a quesadillas, this is definitely not a one $ restaurant. Plus, the quesadillas was super, super oily. I wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"The burritos were amazing. Every ingredient was full of flavor, but not too strong to hide any other flavor. The $2 tacos were also fantastic. The spicy salsa was as spicy as I had hoped. Would definitely eat here again and again and again!"}
{"text":"In love with this inexpensive taco bar! Their haberno hot sauce is super spicy too! The guy that works there isn't kidding when he said it's very hot!"}
{"text":"Probably some of the best tacos I've ever had outside of Los Angeles or Mexico. The key here is the homemade tortillas. Dear God they were wonderful and delicious. Tacos are on the cheap $2/each and you gotta love the free drink refills (including Horchata, Jamaica, Tamarindo). Have a huge selection of meats including chorizo. Everything was fresh and the cooks and staff were incredibly helpful and accommodating. Would definitely be back when I'm in Vegas. Another plus? Open until 4am!!!"}
{"text":"One star because the tacos were good, but the customer service was horrible. 3 young workers who did not stop their personal side conversation the entire time I was ordering. Sorry, I came to get tacos, & could care less how old you are and who has a fake ID. The worst part is that the girl couldn't multitask... she literally stopped in the middle of putting the meat on our tacos to turn around and talk to her coworkers. Then when we FINALLY get to the register, she doesn't have any cash handling skills either. SUPER slow. 

Not to mention, rice & beans are not included with your 3 taco \"entree\"."}
{"text":"I love street tacos. I especially love street tacos that can be ordered from outside of a little window, be it a truck or a window stand. Don't worry there is counter service inside the place too. I'm not sure if there is any indoor sitting, we sat outside. It's Vegas! 
We were excited to see they had Carne Al Pastor cooking. Real Al Pastor turning on the spit, and a nice little pineapple dangling above it. Mmm Mmm. I had 2 tacos Al Pastor and 1 Carne Asada, with the spicy green salsa. They have about 5 different fresh salsas to choose from. 
The Al Pastor was good, the meat had a great traditional flavor, yes I wanted more. The Carne Asada had a little different flavor maybe cumin or cloves, but it didn't taste so great so. Stick to the Al pastor. 
3 tacos 1 beer under 10 bucks.  Yes I'm going back."}
{"text":"Street tacos right on the Strip of Las Vegas!

It's not as dingy and dink as most places I'm used to, but being on a prime location I think they do pretty well up keeping the place.

I ordered the El Pastor, Carnitas, Carne Asada, and Lengua -- Ci yo soy mucho hambriento!  How you gusto me Spanish!?  They didn't put any sauce a top, which for me was odd since the hot sauce is that extra kick that does it for me.  I had to ask for some on the side which was not a problem.  Overall, the lengua was blah, the carnitas was good, but my favorites were the Carne Asada and El Pastor.  Guess they had those ready and popping since I gather these are the popular choices.  The sauce which gave it some kick along with the lemon and onions really helped keep the meat moist.  Wrapped with a soft corn tortilla this street taco was yummy and very rare can you find a place that makes it this good!  

Definitely a recommended taco joint if you're strolling the streets of Vegas and need a quick bite to give you that energy boost! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Best tacos ever! Staff are friendly and who can beat $2 tacos.  So delicious. Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"I am baffled to why this place has 4 stars. We came here after the iHeartRadio festival. We were looking for some good cheap eats that was close enough to the hotel that wouldn't break the bank. Four star taco place, sign me up. But, it wasn't good.

I got the nachos, they use cheese wiz. Yup, melted cheese wiz, it was gross. The guac wasn't bad. The \"steak\" was so chewy it was like eating gum. I couldn't finish it (and yeah I had been drinking, so everything tastes good when you're drinking).

My wife got tacos, she barely finished them, the chicken was good everything else was meh. And this wasn't necessarily cheap.

I would put this place one step above Taco Bell and 3 steps below Chipotle. I would avoid it at all costs, so many better options. And it wasn't cheap at all, it was almost 30 bucks with a couple tall boy cheapo beers."}
{"text":"This is Mexican street style food at its finest. I had an awesome burrito here. This is comparable to Chipotle but more authentic. The menu is basically $10 per item. They have tacos for $2/each but they are quite small and you would likely need 3-4 of them to fill you up. For Vegas standards, the prices and quality of food here is awesome."}
{"text":"They're just regular tacos. But not being corporate/casino operated despite being on the strip makes them great. The black beans are crazy bland though."}
{"text":"Delicious chicken tacos and carne asada burrito. Very generous portions, reasonable price and fast friendly service. Perfect for a quick bite!"}
{"text":"A deal in Vegas that does not mean poor quality. You must visit in Vegas! Very clean, great people working here, active on yelp. A+"}
{"text":"This place rocks!  $2 tacos (street size), but still loaded with flavor and fresh!  Don't let the outside fool you.  Walk in and get yourself fed well!"}
{"text":"Taste + Location + Price = 4 Stars

The food isn't mind blowing. It isn't the best Mexican I've had. But for the price, location, and the taste, it's worth giving them a try.

I only had their tacos. They were cheap and pretty good. A bit on the soggy side with all the sauce, like I said not the best I've had but good. Has a street taco / backyard / homemade taco kind of taste.

The rice was plain white rice so I didn't bother trying it (come on, serve that delicious Spanish rice).

\"Hey I'm right on the Vegas Strip and I want some tacos.\"
\"Man, I'm right on the strip and I want something cheap, fast, but still pretty good.\"
\"Dude, all this walking around and drinking... I need some quick good food.\"
\"I can sure go for some tacos.\"
Give DJ's a try."}
{"text":"decent mexican stuff and quick to grab a bite on the strip. very reasonably priced given the strip premiums"}
{"text":"The best carne asada burrito on the strip! Love it !   Friendly staff,  love the music .I'm definitely coming again. Thank you Armando"}
{"text":"Food was amazing! So glad we found this place! CARNITAS WERE ON POINT . Why 4 stars? Because the guy serving us (younger guy)decided to talk to some girl that was sitting really far away, instead of finishing what he was doing. He annoyed his coworker too, but the other guy was a lot better. (Older man). Overall was awesome!"}
{"text":"On our last Vegas trip at the beginning of this year I had a craving for tacos. This is nothing new, it happens to me all the time. Thank goodness for a smart phone that helps me with my late-night cravings.

On this particular evening, the craving struck around 11:45 p.m.. We'd already walked around the limited food options at Excalibur's food court, so when we saw DJ's wasn't that far from our hotel we set out on foot.  Running. Then walking fast. Then running again.  We made it up to their window with a minute to spare and were greeted by a couple glances at their clock.  

They (thankfully) made us each a couple of tacos and we enjoyed them in the open-air plaza outside their establishment. Tables and chairs and napkins were set up and we enjoyed our food before walking past the dark restaurant back to our hotel.

A couple nights later we returned for more tacos, at a more decent hour.  We went inside this time.  Honestly, the tacos were better the first night. Or maybe they weren't; and I just wanted them more the first night, and I thought they were better because they satisfied my need. But either way, they were good tacos for Vegas tacos!  We never plan to stay at the Excalibur again, but if we're walking around this part of the strip and come across DJ's again I'd definitely make room for a taco or two."}
{"text":"Service sucks, it took 25 min to get a beer only. Made us wait in line. Not enough staffing. Found a fly in my drink and had the guy blame me for it when I complained. Horrible customer service!"}
{"text":"Really great tacos, everything is fresh. Meat is tender and well-seasoned. The burrito was huge. Plenty of sauces, and the ones we tasted were good. This place is not in the casino,  and not a chain like the Taco Bell down the street, which is a nice find when you're walking down the strip I Need a casual meal."}
{"text":"Located across from Aria, this walk up Mexican place is friggin' good.  I'm glad I walked down from Planet Hollywood and tried this one out.  The carne asada burrito was so big and tasty, I nearly split open my stomach devouring it.  

Reminds me of taco truck food from California's Central Valley region.  At $9.95, it's a good deal considering a plate of 9 tortilla chips at Cabo Wabo called the \"Cadillac Nachos\" will set you back nearly $20."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff.  The grilled fish tacos hit the spot.  Nothing super amazing but solid, quality food.  The rice had corn in it and was a little sweet.  With all of the fast food options around, I felt like this was the best food for the value in that area of the strip.

I got a 10% discount when I checked in with Yelp!"}
{"text":"For the price, they should have made it a combo and  included a drink. The portions weren't as generous as hoped, but this was the only Mexican food restaurant  available-----and I was in the mood for a burrito. I was disappointed that the guacamole cost extra and just paid for it anyway."}
{"text":"Reminds me of Chipotle, the pork is the way to go!
It's a little hidden around a corner. We got the street tacos and a bowl. Not a big beer selection of a lot of seating."}
{"text":"A small taco shop right in the middle of the strip in Hawaiian Market Place. Affordable, inexpensive and the food is delicious. I always get the taco plate. I can't seem to veer away from it because I get 3 tacos which I get 3 different kinds of meat (Carne asada, lengua and carnitas), beans and rice. Their Horchata is yummy and I tried their lemonade today and it was surprisingly different.  I thought it would taste like the generic lemonade I usually get in the small restaurants but it tasted like a margarita. If you're in the mood for some good Mexican food, go to DJ's."}
{"text":"Cozy little place between MGM Grand and Planet Hollywood. My boyfriend and I ate their braised pork nachos and fried fish tacos. Generous portions and amazing pricing. Definitely recommend again!"}
{"text":"Unimpressed but this is coming from someone who married a Mexican man. 
Long story short don't expect much from a taco shop on the vegas strip"}
{"text":"The BEST Mexican food on the Vegas Strip - Period!

We just happened to bump into this tiny little joint in the Hawaiian market place, just by chance. Long story. Anyways. This is run by a bunch of really sweet people. And the food we got was - out of this world. Now, I have never been to Mexico but I love Mexican food. And so I have experimented with the cuisine pretty much all of my adult life. The plate of spicy hot Tacos that we got from here was freshly made in front of us, and had the flavors like I have come across only a few times before. Simply amazing. The soft taco shells were warm, had a touch of grease, and the carnitas with all the toppings I chose - especially the very hot green harbanero sauce - OMG, I was in heaven.

Then while getting a drink, my partner suggested something that has stuck with me because the icy cold glass of HORCHATA (that is a sweet rice-water cinnamon drink) which I had to go with my spicy hot food, really made my day in the hot Vegas heat.

Also, we could see such a good mix of people sitting inside as well as outside the joint. A fair amount of local latinos which really showed us that this place is truly authentic. Bingo! Very low key but heavenly food. I don't mind at all eating in Styrofoam plates and plastic cutlery if this is the Quality of food that I get. 

This is my Go To place in Vegas the next time I return and I hope it stays there forever!!"}
{"text":"Must have when im in Vegas...I always order pastor and asada tacos ..Oh the quesadillas are delicious too..Cant wait to go back this July."}
{"text":"I was very pleased with my meal at DJ's. The $15 for $10 was totally worth it, I got a bowl and an order of chips. It was really good, much better than most of the surrounding places to eat. I will totally stop there again. I recommend it to anyone looking for an affordable bite to eat that is actually decent food."}
{"text":"Disgusting, Expensive Non Authentic Mexican Food.

Yelpers you failed me here. I purchased the yelp deal $15 for $10 prior to arriving here based on stellar reviews. 

Disgusting- all the meats sit in their grease in chaffing dishes under heat lamps u build your own entree, all toppings are also sitting in chaffing dishes they are served buffet subway style. They consist of lettuce onions, cilantro, cheese, guacamole, and salsas. I did not order their nachos or carne asada fries but noticed they use nacho cheese for these entrees; this practice is totally americanized disgusting, nachos should be made with real cheese. 

Expensive- I ordered the carne asada torta sandwich 8.95 with beer $4. And my wife ordered the carne asada quesadilla $9.95 plus $1.50 add quacamole and 2 tiny tacos al pastor $2.50 ea. and corona $4. Total bill 35$ so much for affordable. I understand vegas prices are inflated but for a hole in the sewer mexican restaurant this is unwarranted. I would not mind the price if the food was good quality.

Quality- my wife's quesadilla was big lots of cheese with a small amount of meat. The cheese was not completely melted they made it in a hurry not sure why they were rushing since there was no line at the time. The meat was fatty and greasy from soaking in the chaffing dish. She took a few bites and could not finish it. Just too greasy. The tacos were small no complaints about meat says they were good not the bomb. I had torta they toasted the bun added a slather of beans a slather of guacamole lettuce onions and asked me if I wanted mild or hot salsa. Im mexican I need it Hot yo! I went to take my first bite and noticed the bolillo was soggy it had already soaked up all the grease from the meat. Their picante salsa was bland I could not taste A hint of heat from it non authentic like it was served from a jar.

Ambiance- located in a strip mall on the strip like a small little ghetto inside the strip. It is dirty, you will dine outside with wobbily tables and hard chairs. Only feeling that was authentic was the ambiance felt like I was in TJ. Went out of my way to eat here never again. Eat at a nice restaurant share an entree with your partner will b the same price. Dont do it Yelpers!"}
{"text":"Based on a the reviews and stars. You would think this is a  great place. Chillis closed at 11pm on Sunday so we headed to DJ's Tacos which closed at 12pm. The line was short but taking such a long time. It took 30 minutes to get helped plus the person in front of me had been waiting for 45 minutes. 
When it came to being helped. There was a young guy as the cook, a young girl also as the server and an older lady as the cashier. The person in front of us got served. It came our turn we ordered quesadillas. The cheese wasnt even melted, the cashier starting serving food while there was someone ready to pay. The cook is scrambling to get his orders done. Which take it his apperance was a bit eh. His pants were low you could see his shorts/boxers. Then out of the back this guy comes out looking like he was tweeking, a pale face very creepy. Then the cook is cutting the quesadillas in half because the young girl is unable too. Taking him away from cooking, in the mean time theres a loooong line outside. 

We finally get our food and ready to pay. Not sure if the Cashier is the owner. But shes rude and unproffesional. The soda machine no refills, and napkin dispenser is not a self serve either. The cashier hands a few to you. The place is not cheap. Go to McDonalds instead to Monte Carlo and save your stomach & money.  In the end we all had growling stomachs and my cousin with food poisining."}
{"text":"The food is awesome and the price is on point! We got 4 tacos rice and beans plus a large drink for $14. They gave us really good portions of meat and everything from the pico to the tortilla was delicious. I would have given 5 stars easily if only the young girl working there had been more pleasant. She would speak really low when we asked about something and had to ask her to repeat herself multiple times. She didn't seem to want to help anyone. But other than that this is a hidden gem in Vegas! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This spot has good food for a great price.  I ordered the steak fries they were very good lot of toppings to choose from. The staff try to get people in and out so it's good when u don't like to wait for food."}
{"text":"Good tacos! i really like the flavors and quality of the ingredients which was very good and excellent when you consider the prices they charge especially on the L.V. Strip. Not the  greatest service but does not really matter when you are getting good food for a good deal"}
{"text":"Excellent and affordable Mexican food right on the strip.  Once you are tired of the chains and the buffets, come to DJ's for their 3 taco plate with rice and beans for $9.  If you check in with the Yelp app, it's 10% what is already a really affordable meal.  

My personal favorite were the lengua or beef tongue tacos.  If you have never given lengua tacos a try, do it at DJ's.  You will not be disappointed!  So flavorful and tender.  

Such a treat to find authentic, delicious Mexican food right on the strip!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here after walking the strip on a Sunday night and eating Secret Pizza.

Typical looking taqueria/taco stand. They have a to-go window.
 
My girlfriend and I ordered tacos of the following variety: grilled fish, al pastor, carnitas, and barbacoa. The quantity of meat was good and most of them were pretty good. The carnitas was probably my favorite between the meat tacos. You choose your taco dressings but they don't have a salsa bar (boo).

Overall, decent taste and price and definitely a good late-night, street food stop on the Strip.

Note: When we went, they did not freshly cut the al pastor off the spit (unlike Tacos El Gordo). They gave us pre-sliced al pastor."}
{"text":"Found this hidden gem cause I was walking the strip. Now this is a hole in the wall, so if you looking for a fancy place this isn't it. But if you looking for authentic great tasting tacos this is the place.  Will try to eat here every time I visit"}
{"text":"Great deal, great tacos! Had carnitas taco, steak taco and braised beef taco with cilantro, onion and lime. Delicious! Will go back for sure!"}
{"text":"I ate here almost everyday last March, I'm looking forward to stopping again while in Vegas for my 40th Birthday! BOMB tacos! The price is right, and I had money left to play in the slots, lol Can't wait to taste you guys again!!"}
{"text":"Great place! Try their menudo and their chipotle beans.  Carnitas and barbacoa are also good."}
{"text":"Don't, just don't!!!!  How does a taco bar run out of cheese and rice 2 hours before closing in the middle of the Vegas Strip. I repeat. Don't, just don't"}
{"text":"The tacos were incredible!  The rice and beans weren't that great, they were very bland.  People were very friendly and the prices were reasonable.  I would suggest it to everyone!"}
{"text":"It was 108 in Vegas, they had limited AC, the place was hot.  So I assume the food quality suffered a little bit.  We ordered 2 burritos, steak and pork.  Not cheap, 8-9 each.   The portion size is large. The steak was very tough and dry and the pork mushy, the beans and toppings where ok.  Really, this places seems fit for late night drunk food.   It really reminds me of a knock off qdoba or chipotle,  where the food is good just not great.  guacamole  is 1.49, boy that sounds like qdoba.   

If its late, your drunk and on the strip you could do worse."}
{"text":"This review is just on my experience. I didn't actually have the opportunity to try the food. I don't eat meat but I do eat fish. The sad part about it is they ran out of fish so I could not eat what else was left on the menu. The lady behind the counter insisted that I try something else but didn't really understand that I don't eat meat."}
{"text":"Put one star FOR LOCATION ONLY. Rude management. Didn't even wait to try the food. Why waste my time?

Told us (and the people behind us) the restaurant  \"didn't need our money\". 6-8 patrons walked out afterwards with us. Instead of kindly explaining WHY he was asking us to line up outside (in 45° weather), he said, \"You're blocking my exits (nobody was standing blocking EITHER door). Just go outside. It ain't that hard man. I don't need your money anyway.\"

NOT ONLY THAT, but a female employee wanted to  fight a customer after the customer tried to defend us (from the rude ass owner)! Wowww!

Shitty management = shitty employees = shitty experience! Don't forget, Señor Owner, you LIVE off of tourists! #MexonMexcrime"}
{"text":"Great fast Mexican food! Serving portions are great and the chicken and steak are very tender. Service was super nice and they don't mind giving extra helpings of non meats for free!"}
{"text":"Night crew Is awesome. They had plenty of suggestions on what to try we ended up with a huge quesadilla with chicken rice beans and quac inside that was bomb!! My wife got a couple tacos and she said barbacoa was soooo goood sooo good. She wanted more. The only downfall is that it was scorching hot inside otherwise it would be 5 Stars"}
{"text":"Taco's were VERY TASTY and you can't help not to stop by after looking at the yummy pork spinning on the stick from the outside! Very nice little kick back place across from the city center!"}
{"text":"FANTASTIC TACOS!! Friendly service for a taco noob like me. The sever gave me great suggestion on the combinations of meats and condiments."}
{"text":"Easy and conveient. We went back twice for lunch. It is located right on the strip. The tacos were build you own, had great flavor, and pretty cheap."}
{"text":"Not entirely sure why this is rated so high. The tacos were Average at best and not worth walking the distance"}
{"text":"Pros
Tasty tacos

Cons
Horrible atmosphere and service

The tacos (I got carne asada and carnitas) were very tasty and they have a nice little selection of a few different beers. A little pricey but it's on the strip. 

Unfortunately, I decided to eat in, which is a huge mistake. I asked if their wifi was for customers, and the person at the cashier just waved me away. Maybe she didn't understand me, maybe she didn't know. Call me old-fashioned, but I think staff should be polite to customers when they ask a simple question and find out the answers if they don't know. As I was eating, the place started to fill up with smoke. It was coming from the grill where they were cooking the meat. A little smoke, I don't mind. But it was literally filling up the place to the point where it was quite thick. Me and another couple that was there left and ate outside. Just odd that they have such poor ventilation and didn't give a crap.

I prefer Tacos El Gordo over this, but they are quite a bit up north on the Strip."}
{"text":"Any way to give zero stars? We got there on a Saturday night about 1am and there was 10 people in front of us. It took 45 minutes just to order! When we ordered the only meat options were pastor and tongue so everyone in my group got pastor something. We took it to go and when we ate it in the room half of us got the shitters after 10 minutes of eating the food. The burrito itself was a 3-4 star. Customer service was sub or but what do you expect from a run down taco place. If you have a strong stomach and a lot of patience then this is the place for you. Otherwise you're better off with another place around town."}
{"text":"The tacos were traditional and delicious. The orange peel salsa really stood out. Well priced and, unlike almost all the other places on the strip, nothing fake about it."}
{"text":"This manager is horrible he had the audacity to say that my cards weren't working but his machine wasn't working and he is just looking at us like its our fault. His customer service was horrible do better!!"}
{"text":"You must go try DJ's Tacos if you are in Vegas! I have been Mexico and had some local tacos there. DJ's tacos were just as good as those. If not, better!"}
{"text":"DEAL ME IN

This place is a total find and is located on Fremont Street next to the Heart Attack Cafe. You can not miss it because they have a blinking red neon sign that says $2 Tacos. Enough said!!!

I needed a light snack before dinner after skipping lunch, so I decided to pop in here. They had a large selection of meats to choose from. I decided to go with a pork carnitas taco and a shredded beef taco. Both were really good and packed full of meat. The $2 price also included a choice of hot sauce and I went with the medium green salsa.  Cilantro and raw onions were included too. I skipped the cilantro but dived in on the raw onions. Luckily I had a tin of the Yelp shaped breath mints to freshen me up afterwards. 

The meats were really tasty. There is nothing like a slow roasted piece of meat in my book. I saw the grilled steak and grilled chicken but they looked a little dried out. This location has many of its meats precooked and sitting in warming trays. This is why I choose the two meats I did. The pork carnitas and shredded beef were sitting in their own natural juices and I knew they would be yummy at any time of the day. I was dead on. 

I decided to go with a medium salsa because I was taking a redeye flight back home and I wasn't looking forward to terror at 30,000 feet, so I played it safe. They had several salsas to choose from but I was happy with the medium salsa verde. It had the perfect amount of spicy without being too over powering. 

The location is in a food court without any  mall. There were two other restaurants in here. One serving pizza/pasta and the other serving Asian food. I did not try the other food at these two places but was offered some Asian chicken on a toothpick that I nicely turned down. 

So if your on Fremont Street looking for a light but filling snack then I highly recommend this place. The tacos were really good and I would come back here in a heartbeat for a good meal deal that won't break the bank."}
{"text":"Stopped by here with the bf on our way to Caesars Palace. The lady assembling the taco made us feel so rushed even though there was no one behind us. It was our first time here so we didn't know what we wanted as toppings for our tacos. She kept scooping up different toppings assuming that's the one we wanted with an annoyed look on her face. I believe the lady ahead of us felt the same way because apparently the other girl working put the wrong sauce on her tacos - she was rushing the lady as well. At that point, we felt like we were \"bothering\" her and left with some plain ass tasting tacos. We got steak and chicken tacos and it was so bland! Rice and refried beans also nasty. 

The only seating available was outside with the pigeon shit covered tables. Disgusting. 

Should have went to Chipotle instead!"}
{"text":"Located in the Hawaiian Marketplace, the tacos carnitas here is soooo good, super juicy! And no, I was not drunk when I had them, so if you are, I'm sure they'll be a mouthful of juicy meat delight! I'm sad they were out of al pastor when I went at 2pm in the day... also was VERY hot inside. $2 tacos is a good deal though for something on the strip, they've got a great selection of fountain drinks so battle the heat. Plus the $10 for $15 Yelp deal was the icing on the cake. I'd definitely come back here"}
{"text":"We had been in Vegas for a couple days, spending anywhere from $60 to $150 to feed 4 people, and no joke we noticed earlier in the day Bally's was charging $15 for a hot dog, FOR ONE HOTDOG. Then we stumbled on this place while walking down the strip. We fed the four of us here for the same price as that one hotdog would have been. 
The street tacos are only $2 each, and they are amazing. You get to pick a meat and all the toppings you want. We had carne asada and shredded beef and they were both delicious. The staff is also super courteous and helpful in deciding what to order with your tacos.
If you're in Vegas and are tired of spending an outrageous amount of money on food and don't want to veer off the strip, go to DJs Tacos and save your money for the casinos (;"}
{"text":"Street tacos on the Vegas strip. What a concept. Could there be anything better than street tacos after a crazy drunken night you will never remember. These tacos hit the spot and are BOMB."}
{"text":"Killer tacos. Cheap, easy to order, and some of the spiciest salsa in the world. Great deal on cold beers, too."}
{"text":"I had a craving for some real tacos, non of that hard shell nonsense, so after finding this place on yelp and reading the reviews, we decided to give it a try since it was a block away from our hotel. They were authentic and delicious. By far, the best tacos I have had in Vegas."}
{"text":"I feel so bad for the workers, they're friendly but they're stuck and trapped in a hot and stuffy place. I'm not sure if that'll continue to drive people in - the electric fans all over the store? So now the sweat and BOs are floating around. Sigh. Anyway, the food is pretty good. I would come back (for the price). I just hope they don't continue to restrict the quantity of their food."}
{"text":"Friends and I made a late night stop here and it was great after a night out in Vegas. They have burritos, tacos, nachos, quesadillas and they're all customizable. The service was fast, prices were reasonable and the food was good. They also have aguas frescas and seating space indoors & outdoors. I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"The management here is messed up. We came on fourth of july and there was a line out the door. As we got closer to the counter to order, i finally realized why the line was out the door. One person is preparing our orders while 6 others are standing around, talking, acting like their busy but they're not. They act like they're only assigned to one job (i.e. cashier) so they stick to that one job post even when there's no one to help while one lady is running around putting tortillas on the grill, flipping them, putting the meat and fillings in it and assembling it. When one girl tried to tip her, another worker came up and said that's not allowed. What do you mean it's not allowed? They probably split tip if we had left it in the tip jar. Heck, we only want to tip the person who actually worked."}
{"text":"I came here for a quick dinner while in Vegas. It is a walk up taco stand with a few seats inside and more outdoor seating. I ordered 3 tacos; one with lengua (beef tongue), one with carnitas and one carne asada. The  lengua was hands down the best, nice and tender and well seasoned. The have a variety of salsas to choose from. The prices are about $2.00 per taco."}
{"text":"Came here with roommates because they apparently saw excellent reviews for the spot.

I typically love tacos, but this is one of the few times I've left completely disappointed. I got a Taco Plate ($9.95) that came with three tacos, beans, and rice. It was the first thing on the menu, so I figured it should be safe. I chose Carnitas, Barbacoa, and Al Pastor chicken, which seemed to have relatively good reviews on Yelp, but they all turned out to be tasteless. By the end, I was just eating the rice and beans because I was still hungry... I tried my friend's steak and fries, which was a bit better, but still not great.

Food might look good in pictures, but please don't come here, especially for tacos."}
{"text":"Perfect for a reasonable lunch, tasty with a little kick. Totally recommend, but there are way better places to eat on the strip. Comparable to chipotle."}
{"text":"I think I was too hyped for tacos pork al pastor, and when I went, they didn't have it. So I had everything else, and the carnitas taco and chicken were the only ones I cared for (2/5).

The other star is for horchata, which was really mediocre, but given the temp was around 104, it was good.

Pretty sure most of these reviews are after eating late night, post-drinking consumption, where everything is fire."}
{"text":"Great service as Marry (I think that's her name) was super helpful and friendly.  Tacos and especially the churros are super delicious!!!! Would so go back for them."}
{"text":"We were sitting in Casino wondering what to eat and nothing sounded good or was crazy expensive. We went on Yelp and found this place and decided to walk down the strip about a half mile and have dinner. Prices are great $2 for a street taco. They also have burritos and other traditional Mexican food. Food was fresh place was clean and we will definitely come back when craving some good Mexican food while in Vegas."}
{"text":"Not really sure what else you can ask for. Solid lunch spot if you're in Vegas very straight forward ordering and good pricing. The workers were nice and efficient and there was a very good selection of food to pick from. Everything i had was great i'd recommend the chunky medium hot sauce, the spicy pork, and the pinto beans with porn inside of it."}
{"text":"These guys are assholes, pieces of shit must of thought it'd be funny to give us insanely spicy sauce when we asked for mild. I love spicy food, but this is just crap. Neither of us can eat this. Karma is a bitch."}
{"text":"Ok...So after reading all the reviews about this spot, I had to come to Vegas and try them out!

It's a small Taco spot but don't let the looks foul you. I came with my best friend who recently moved to Vegas and even she stated, \"I've been on the strip so many times and never seen this taco spot\". Yup!! Thanks to Yelp we were able to ball on a budget here.

We walked in and notice their menu. They had many different things to order: Taco Platter, Quesadilla, Burrito, Salad or bowl. You can pick your meat and don't worry; they have all type of meat: Steak, Chicken, Pork, Shredded Beef, Grilled Fish, and Crispy Fish. No matter what meat you get EVERYTHING is DE-LISH!

I am in LOVE with Tacos so of course I ordered the Taco Platter plate which consisted of: 3 tacos and 2 sides. I was able to make both my sides rice (Yes, I love rice as well) HAHA! 
What I really liked most was that you were able to put your on toppings on your tacos. Normal taco places that I go to in California they just do the norm: Cilantro and salsa but this place has it all baybee! Avocado, sour cream, different type of salsas, tomatoes, lettuce, cilantro...OMG!! REALLY!

My best friend ordered the bowl and she truly enjoyed it! Matter of fact the bowl could actually feed two people! NOICEEE!

They also had outdoor seating and indoor seating (Limited seating inside). During the time I came here it was 100 degrees in Vegas so seating inside or outside to me was miserable.
 
The inside has NO A/C! OMG how can the workers stand to work in that HOT environment! Anywho, my only concern was the hotness in that joint. They would definitely be 5 stars once they fix that A'C problem.

In the meantime, 4 stars for the cheap Taco spot on the Vegas Strip!

Till next time DJ's Taco Bar!"}
{"text":"I might call this a hidden gem of tacos on the Las Vegas Strip!  I don't know who DJ is, but he makes a damn fine taco...this little spot located not far from the MGM on the strip sports street style tacos with a variety of options to choose from.  My favorite?--absolutely the al pastor if you're lucky enough to get it as the last time I was in---it was out.  So flavorful and tender--their al pastor is second to none.  The cow's tongue was always quite good--extremely tender for tongue.  Overall, a surprisingly awesome find!"}
{"text":"So goooood!  The guys work very hard and treat you great!  The taco plate was very good and I got the extra extra spicy salsa which was spicy for sure!! My husband loved the place.  Very casual and affordable."}
{"text":"Wack... Luckily I got 10% off for checking in... Rice was hard, Carne Asada tacos tasted kind of old"}
{"text":"I would give a negative 4 stars if this app would let me. First of all me and 3 others waited for a while before someone finally came out to serve us then Good thing i watched the guy prepare food. After making the order for the first person in line he went to the cash register got the money from the customer with gloves still on (held the money on both hands) then gave the customer her change (same gloves still on) then proceeded on preparing our orders with the same gloves. When i asked him if he is going to change his gloves he simply ignored me. Then i told him that to forget about my order then he has the nerve to get mad at me and threw the tacos that I ordered at the wall. Really???!!"}
{"text":"So many options for good Mexican food in Vegas but this is a must stop, great food.  Service was great and so fast.  This will be a stop for me every time I'm in Vegas for now on"}
{"text":"Pretty good carne asada fries! They made a fresh batch of fries, which is greatly appreciated. The meat wasn't dry or tasted old. The salsas are amazing, I got the red salsa and was pleasantly surprised at how good it was, not watery or bland.The staff was also incredibly friendly and provided great service."}
{"text":"Thank goodness we found this place. Me and my bf drove to Utah and are on our way back to California  and decided to stop in Las Vegas. We walked along the strip looking for somewhere to eat and I couldn't handle another French fry. We shared three tacos. I got a chicken one and he got carne asada. They were so good and so was the rice. Black beans were a little bland but in my experience they're kind of hard to spice just right. The guy with the neck tattoos was super nice. We will be back tomorrow if we can't find another place to eat. I love tacos."}
{"text":"If you cant make it to tacos el gordo come here
Their carne asada fries are awesome and full filling"}
{"text":"This place has amazing burritos!!  Best one I've ever had!! Yum!"}
{"text":"Friendly and fast service. Foods r good and cheep."}
{"text":"Tacos were SO GOOD! So impressed! Reminded me of California taco truck! Great prices! I will Definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"i was walking the strip with a couple of friends of mine and as california natives we were all craving mexican food. we stumbled across a huge tex-mex themed restaurant where the meals averaged about $16. that was a no go for me. I don't pay that kind of money for mexican food because generally the food is not tasty. I turned to yelp to see what was nearby and dj's had a yelp deal. off i went. my burrito was super-good and the tortilla tasted homemade. I got mine to go bc i planned to eat half then and half later but ended up inhaling it all in one setting. Delicious food!"}
{"text":"Man I miss street tacos in Vegas, they are the best! I wanted to go to El Gordo but it was just too far, so I stumbled upon here instead. It was delicious, not as good as El Gordo but it's much more centrally located and convenient, so next time I will opt for this place. The Al Pastor tacos are pork off of a spit fire, which I wish they had these back in NoVA but surprisingly they don't. This will be my street taco spot next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Love the grilled fish tacos! My husband tried the marinated pork, beef and chicken tacos and liked the pork ones the best! Would definitely return - great prices for great food."}
{"text":"$2.00 Tacos. They were mediocre,  I think I would've really enjoyed them had they been on a flour tortilla versus corn."}
{"text":"Best taco's I've ever had visiting Vegas. If I could figure out a way to stuff my face with more taco's then my body could hold, I would. Every Time I fly to Vegas, this is my first stop. Carlos and Eli were amazing on this visit today. There was even a sweet little girl that let me try a few meats I've never tried before. Get here. Your tastebuds will thank you. I own a restaurant in Chicago and I tell my customers to come here when visiting. Thanks all"}
{"text":"Friends and I were craving Mexican food. Luckily we yelp this place came up first. Food is good and not as expensive as other on the strip. Will come back again."}
{"text":"OMG!!!  We were talking along the strip, and got hungry.  Someone had spotted this place, so we went back.  I pulled up on YELP while waiting and was blown away by the ratings. 

Looking around the shop, they had a vertical pork broiler and had just brought out a new slab.  Too, they were working hard on grilling up more steak, cutting, etc.  So it took a minute to get waited on.  But Marisol was quite apologetic and pleasant when things calmed down. 

We had $2 tacos, and I got a burrito (huge).  They build it in front of you, and you can request what you want.  The hot sauce has a great kick and not TOO spicy. The guacamole was home made (not processed crap). The marinade on the steak was amazing!!

Once we found this, we went back a number of times - and one night for dinner!!"}
{"text":"My Mexican friend was in dire need of tacos after a night of drinking and dancing. She found the place on Yelp so upon recommendation, we walked here as a group to get some tacos. My husband and I shared the 3 taco plate, one with shredded beef and carne asada for the 2 other tacos. It came with rice and refried beans. We topped with mild green sauce, onions, and cilantro. My friend and her husband ordered the same but with different meat, and a plate of the sopes and nachos. Wow. For the price and location, this place did not disappoint. The food was fresh, the food was quick, and it was not a bad price at all. Easy to find a place to sit and right outside, it's a little hole in the wall place within a center of other foods but it's easy to find out why this place has such great ratings. It's authentic and all around delicious food with reasonable pricing. I would definitely hit this place up again while in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Bomb! Authentic. best street taco on the strip. The 1000 flavor coca cola machine is plus."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, open late, homemade corn tortillas, and great tasting meat. I have no complaints about this place, I even enjoyed the hilarious mural they have painted on the wall. You can't go wrong with great tasting $2 tacos. Next time I'm in Vegas, I will visit this place again."}
{"text":"Simple, freshly prepared, no frills taqueria.  For what it is, it did a great job with super friendly and helpful service.  Limited indoor seating - one four-top and stools along the wall - but helpful to be out of the heat.  Huge portions and cold beer.  Excellent value."}
{"text":"At DJ's Taco Bar their food is fresh and so yummy. If you are at the mall and sitting in the food court trying to figure out what to eat... Look no more. This place is the perfect choice. Food is great and service is very nice. This is real Mexican Food. Sooooooo delicious!!!"}
{"text":"The food gets a 4 1/2 , the location a -4.  It's a very small place tucked away in the Hawaiian 
Village on the Strip.   They deserve a better location and larger venue.

Had a combination taco plate.  The rice was good, beans were good (not canned).  Al pastor was flavorful, the canitas - very moist and infused with flavor.   Green salsa was tangy and good.    

The guacamole was great.  Most places think guacamole is smashed avocado.  Their was a true guacamole with onion, tomato, cilantro and great spices.  It's was extra but it was wonderful! 

Would recommend it."}
{"text":"Great burrito! If you are looking for a quick bite that isn't overly priced on the strip, definitely eat here. Nice area to sit outside! 100% recommend. 
Steak burrito with the extra extra hot sauce"}
{"text":"Great find on the strip for yummy, fresh, and affordable Mexican food.  You can't beat the $2 tacos!   This is a must try for a quick but filling bite on the strip."}
{"text":"The tacos here were good. One of the best lengua tacos I've ever had. We tried their other tacos but I can only remember how good the lengua was. It's pricier than other local taco joints but is definitely worth a shot if in the area."}
{"text":"The food was surprisingly awesome. Had the Chile Relleno plate and tacos de Cochinita (Marinated Pulled Pork) it was awesome. Definitely will be eating here more often."}
{"text":"Been coming here for 4 years BEST TACOS IN VEGAS, the meat is really good and juicy every time we come always the same good tasty meat you can't go wrong here I highly recommend this place, customer service is excellent,  day and night always great food and service."}
{"text":"Perfect late night dining option. I came strolling in close to midnight after working up an appetite walking the strip and this perfectly hit the spot. Even though they were close to closing staff was still friendly and welcoming as I made up my mind.

Even though tacos are there go to I went with a pork burrito with all the toppings. Pork was moist and well seasoned, lettuce and tomato were fresh and crisp. re-fried beans were a tasty and flavorful add on. The portion size and price were also perfect especially compared to other places on the strip.

Great little spot for some late night eating or at any time during the day."}
{"text":"A low-key, casual place to get delicious tacos. A bit of a trek, but just use Google Maps to get to the courtyard where DJ's is located- it's worth it! More than just a taco bar, they also offer tortas, burritos, nachos, and steak fries. The owner and the three other employees were all very courteous and quick with making our orders. It's set up similarly to Chipotle where you tell them what you want in your taco as they make it. 

The owner made me some delicious vegetarian soft tacos with black beans, rice, medium salsa, onions, cilantro, cheese, and lettuce. They also had a large selection of meat for all the omnivores out there. Complete with a beer menu, soft beverages, horchata, and jarisco, DJ's is a wonderful place to refuel without putting a dent in your bank account."}
{"text":"Good customer service but the food...not so good.
I can't even believe that this little cafeteria style taco shop has a 4 star yelp rating.
I can only assume that coming from a city so close to the Mexican border, that my Mexican food expectations are above average.  I ordered three different tacos with a side of rice and beans. Both the chicken and pork were dry and the only flavor from the steak came from the salsa I poured on it. The corn tortillas did seem fresh and they have a nice selection of salsa's to pick from but a girl cannot survive through a hangover with salsa and corn tortillas alone. 

One good thing though...just as I'd decided not to take another bite of my food and a homeless guy came up and asked if he could have it. I hope he enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Decided to get tacos for some late night eats on the strip. Got carne asada, chicken, and carnitas. I wanted to get grilled fish too but they didn't serve it at the time I visited.  I felt brave and asked for habanero salsa on my taco. HOLY SH** it was so good but I was running around like a crazy person for a good minute...but I enjoyed it because it didnt have the usual a$$ taste from the pepper but had all the good components. I was able to use the yelp discount which was a plus."}
{"text":"Absolutely NOT GOOD! I asked the waiter in SPANISH can I have barbacoa and he gave me chicken, mind you he spoke Spanish. The cooks have a hurry-up-and-order attitude that SUCKS and not very welcoming. Also, they are eating pieces of the meat while they are preparing your taco, that is VERY NASTY and unsanitary. I understand you have to taste your food as you cook it, but when you are licking your fingers in public, then wiping them with your sweaty forehead and then pick up my tortilla and start making making my food with your bare hands doesn't paint a clean picture here. 

Not to mention the AL PASTOR had no flavor, it needs one ingredient to bring out the meat. SALT!! in Spanish it's called SAL, doesn't matter what I speak to them, they still wont get it right.

This place sucks!"}
{"text":"This place was really good and I guess u could say cheap for the strip. I got a burrito for 10 bucks which is a little pricey but a lot of food. We would go back again just wish they had margaritas"}
{"text":"Great food and great prices, especially for being located on the strip!  I will definitely be back time and again!"}
{"text":"When your hungry this is an ok place. The meat for the asada is a little too thick and it hard to chew. I probably won't be back unless there's no other place that's open late."}
{"text":"Dj's was great.  Taco plate was fantastic and they loaded it with whatever toppings desired.   Great strip stop.."}
{"text":"Pretty good. I loved their horchata-yummy!"}
{"text":"In a little mall right on the strip.  The food was good, a small step up from Chipotle. They had a large selection of meats and toppings for taco.  Nothing was very fresh except the tortillas because it is all sitting there.  Since there was not a lot of people,there's not a lot of turnover.  The rice was hard and some of the meats had dried out a little.

The service however was not great.  The staff was not particularly friendly and was really slow considering we were the only ones ordering.  They were not particularly friendly or helpful.  They did however accept the yelp deal I bought  with no issues.

If you want a cheap meal on the strip, it might do the trick but otherwise skip it."}
{"text":"Let me just start by saying the tacos was not that good. With every bite I took I could taste the grease from the grill they cooked the taco shells on. 2nd! The customer service is ridiculously horrible if I did not have my 2 kids with me I would've cussed that little girl out that was behind the counter. I got 1 Taco some guacamole and a drink. My total came to $9.17 when I asked her why so high she got real agitated and started giving me the prices of the things I told her I stopped her when she got to the walk amole and she charged me $3 when clearly the board says $1.50 she told me is $1.50 on the side and $3 as a \"side side\"...((excuse me??)) WTF is a \"side side??\" So when I told her to take it back I did not want the guacamole she told me it was too late because I already started to eat it...idgaf!!! I'm not paying $3 for a \"side side\" guacamole... especially until you tell me what the hell a \"side side\" is... so not to make a scene in front of my children I paid for the food with credit she hands me the receipt rushing me to sign and I told her to calm down I'm looking over my charges and then I will sign it and I just threw the pin at her and walked away this customer service is ridiculous has she been a little bit nicer I wouldn't have been such a \"B\" but when you dealing with hungry people especially in your line of work of customer service you don't get to be that angry when I get to be the angry one needless to say DJ's taco bar I will not be getting any more of my business....smh straight rip off prices are listed differently and then what they charge you for"}
{"text":"Stopped by here for some late night food - keep in mind I had some drinks - but it was delish! I like that you were able to make your own tacos AND nachos. But yea.. keep in mind I was drinking :)"}
{"text":"Very rude workers. The cashier was too busy texting to even take our order. The woman giving us the food yelled at us saying \"what do you want!\" I would of walked out but it was late and everything was closed."}
{"text":"The tacos were small, but they were pretty cheap. And they tasted real good!! I wouldn't say they were the best tacos that I have ever had...but I enjoyed eating them so that counts for something. It is right on the strip.. so that could be good or bad. It was a cheaper option than a lot of the other places. Overall it was decent."}
{"text":"Skip the expensive food at the giant casinos. Step out on to the strip and eat great cheap. Everything we got was fresh and good."}
{"text":"I was anxiously and excited to try this spot based on the stars and some reviews. To my disappointment, it was eh! I had a steak torta with refried beans and guacamole. The steak was bland along with the beans. I expected so much, the pictures almost made you drool but definitely not worth it. If I were you, I'd skip this joint and walk a few more blocks to Tacos El Gordo."}
{"text":"Walked 15 and I show up 12 min before closing and the door is locked I called to place the order 30 min before closing and they don't answer . Mind you they are in the restaurant cleaning up. Bad business service"}
{"text":"Super good, great salsas.  Nice and cheap and right on the strip for a quick bite."}
{"text":"We came here from Cali for the weekend.  We run to this place and seriously the best mexican food I've tasted in Vegas!!!!! We laterally ate the whole weekend here. Management is great and Armando the cook knows his stuff

Do I recommend??? YES. 

I will be coming here next Vegas visit."}
{"text":"This spot is too damn good. The shredded spicy beef and pork is so flavorful and not to mention their beer selection is on point. If you've ever been to Taco Shops at San Diego, i definitely recommend this place since it's on par with how fresh their ingredients are. I would absolutely take this over most mexican taco shops any day."}
{"text":"Love this place. I got the marinated pork, steak and beef tongue tacos with menudo and it was so good! The price is good and great location."}
{"text":"Went in with a group of 7 ordered nacho's and a few other items! Didn't have a majority of the ingredients one would expect, for example cheese for nacho's not available, God forbid we asked for sour cream to compliment our quesadilla we ordered didn't have it either!  Asked for some guac instead sorry that's a extra charge but if your running a food establishment and don't have the ingredients supplement it and make the customer happy! 
Will never come back and the manager was the most rude fast food service employee I ever met. Some cocky rude fella  who reached his career peak at this place as a fast food manager and believes calling customers \"why are you being a d*** maybe because you don't have the things posted!\""}
{"text":"NO ES COMIDA MEXICANA... EN MEXICO NO TE COBRAN POR GUACAMOLE!? la carne y el pollo estaban buenos, tenian buen sabor, pero... las tortillas estaban duras y malisimas, cobran por todo, los tacos solo llevan cebolla, cilantro y disque salsa-aguacate (que es mas agua que nada)... y la verdad creo que deberian de tener mejor servicio al cliente porque el taquero que estaba era demasiado rudo! la verdad no vuelvo a regresar! y no lo recomiendo!"}
{"text":"The food was not bad, but it wasn't good either. It was extremely overpriced for the little amount of food they give you. When I sat down to eat my food, most of my it was fairly code and therefore much less enjoyable. 

As for the service, most of the people who work there have a bit of an attitude. One guy forgot to finish my torta and then gave his manager some attitude when she asked him if he was gonna finish. 

I wouldn't go back"}
{"text":"Good selection and fresh condiments but the marinated pork I ordered was too salty, overpowered my burrito."}
{"text":"tacos are fresh, need seasoning, but he service was wack!! They stare at you when you walk in (not welcoming, bothered to assist you), and bark at you when they ask what toppings you want. grilled fish was my fav, carne asada just needs some salt.."}
{"text":"Nice people here, but the Mexican food here really is just okay.

The tacos are good, but I would different that they are anything particularly special.  Here are a couple of reasons why:

1) The rice here has no flavor - just salt;
2) The corn salsa here uses frozen corn - you might as well not offer the option;
3) The salsa verde here is a bit bland;
4) The meat here, regardless of which one you order here, is also a bit on the bland side.

So put these things together, you get a pretty average taco/burrito/bowl.  Personally, I think that most of the raving reviews here are a result of needing a good late-night snack."}
{"text":"Generous with their toppings and amazing flavor! We got steak nachos, and they were delicious!"}
{"text":"Tacos are delicious. Chips are great. Michelada is spicy hot. Definitely will be back. Maybe even tonight!! Viva Las Vegas. Super nice and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Oh man, I miss Tacos El Gordo. This place has no idea what they are doing. The workers are pretty cool, but they are SO SLOW. Inside the shop was sooo warm and stuffy, the workers were sweating, and serving your food. The meat was super salty, my tacos were drenched in grease.  

Never coming here again."}
{"text":"street side fast food style... Street side vendor taste!  Over price food... Most likely due to the over head cost of rent, centrally located in the strip.  My wife nearly puke from the taste of the food.... But then she is a finicky easter.  Won't go again."}
{"text":"Great food and service!  These guys are awesome! Lover and I come everytime were in town!"}
{"text":"A-ma-zing tacos. We've been back every day since we discovered the $2 tacos. The staff is super friendly and sociable (although it may help if you speak in Spanish). I always get the fish (there's fried and grilled), and they cook it when you order it. Also, if you like spicy food, this is the place! Their spiciest salsa left my husband and I crying. People who have left negative comments about the atmosphere are in the wrong place. This is amazing food and should be judged for what it is, not against the fancy, 5-star restaurants on the strip. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Very good and the price is right for Vegas!  I highly suggest the spicy pork burrito."}
{"text":"Carlos and alfred are amazing! This place is awesome! I love everything about it from the food, atmosphere, hospitality! Its awesome! Keep it up fellas"}
{"text":"Not bad for a kind of hole in the wall place off the the strip. The food was authentic, maybe just a tad pricy for how small the tacos were."}
{"text":"Solid little taco shop on the strip. Friendly service. Good food and reasonably priced for being on the strip.  Solid four stars!"}
{"text":"Came here a couple times since it was walking distance and I was down here for business and this place was cheaper than everyone else. Definitely recommend the al pastor tacos, pork or chicken are both good. Tonight I did 2 pork al pastor and I was tempted with the shredded beef because person in front of me ordered it on their nachos and it looked good. Definitely regretting that choice. It's not bad, but the al pastor is definitely better. I, also, got the spicy beans, no rice, those are pretty good too."}
{"text":"Delicious! I got tacos, nachos, and fries. Everything's was tasty and I wasn't even drunk."}
{"text":"Okay so this review is short and sweet because we stopped here on the strip on our way to another eatery. We walked from the Luxor to Treasure Island because we were going to get a bite on that side but went sightseeing on the way.  I had book marked this location and didn't realize it was a small shop in a small food court. So it is not even a whole in a wall just a small restaurant. We went up to the counter and it was a bunch of young guys that looked a bit confused about their rolls and duties but the cook had the food prep down simply by the way he was moving and preparing the food. We decided on three tacos and noticed it was pretty pricey compared to the prices in Los Angeles but hey its Vegas right. Once we got our food we noticed that the portions were pretty good and the meat had okay flavor. I wouldn't go with the carne asada but the al pastor was very flavorful. So if you really want some tacos I might drive down a little further to a more authentic spot but this place was okay."}
{"text":"Cost: $13

Came to the strip for the first time with a few new friends and found this to be a decent place on Yelp. 
Was pleased with my chicken 'bowl', although I've had better. 

The bowl was okay but the Horchata was too sweet and watery. I've had better from a food trucks in Vancouver."}
{"text":"Carnitas tacos were extremely bland.  The lone asada taco saved a one start review.  Ordered chips and salsa.  The red salsa tasted like hot sauce.   After two bites, everything ended up in the trash."}
{"text":"Looking through places that I checked in and wondering if I should review. Stumbled on this one,  funny because I was probably stumbling while I checked in! I'm so glad I did because DAMN. 

This place was amazing! Open late, quick, cheap, and effing heaven. I mean, it's late night tacos and stuff, but everything tasted so fresh, and was pretty much cooked right in front of you. 

I fell in love with DJ's and I will definitely stumble my way over here at the end of the night next time I'm in Vegas.

{"text":"We just stopped in on way to a show for a snack. Ended up making it dinner. Surprisingly authentic for the strip. Great flavor. Had the standard tacos. Yucatan pork, tongue, carne asada all good. Great salsas and guac. Hidden gem."}
{"text":"Saw the good reviews and had a taco fixing. Around 8:30pm on a Thursday night, the place was empty. I walked in and took a look at the Chipotle style layout of food. I honestly questioned the amount of time the food had been sitting out with the dry look of the rice, beans, and meat like it hadn't been rotated, stirred, or mixed for a couple hours. I then questioned whether I wanted to stay and take the risk of getting funky bowel movements. In Vegas fashion, I took a gamble and ordered the three taco dinner, substituted two scoops of rice instead of rice and beans. Unfortunately they did not have al pastor which had been highly reviewed . Disappointed but ordered two carnitas and a barbacoa. I typically order lengua which they had but didn't want to make that big of a bet. They also let you mix any meats which is nice. They had a lot of toppings to choose from but I went with straight up onions and cilantro with mild green salsa. All in all it was a tasty meal. Meat was a bit greasy to the point the tortillas broke. I don't mind that but I know it can be a turnoff for some. The rice while dry was actually not bad either. You can definitely get your taco fix here but just know it might not be the freshest tacos.

{"text":"Very nice authentic street tacos, right in the middle of Las Vegas strip between all kinds of touristic mega chain restaurants. Wow!

I was very glad to discover this place while looking for something decent to eat quickly, place certainly does not look very fancy but the most important thing i.e. food was good. I took the taco plate with 3 tacos, rice and beans which was more than enough to kill my hunger. Tacos were tasty, fresh with just about right amount of spiciness (with the most spicy sauce). 

All in all a place I would certainly visit again if ever looking for something quick to grab when walking up and down the Strip"}
{"text":"Both tacos (only $2) and burritos are very tasty. Meat cooked right here. Nice surprise for Strip fast food. Little hidden gem."}
{"text":"This place blew me away for a cheap awesome place to eat while visiting Las Vegas. It was recommended by a friend and although hard to find, so worth it. The tacos are amazing and cheap(only$2-3 each) I ordered three of them with a side of churros .They were cooked fresh and the flavors are incredible. The flavors are so complex and the meat marinates in a special seasoning and sauce. The chicken was my favorite but the others were delicious as well. There is a wide array of fresh salsa and homemade guacamole. To find this place you need to find the Harley Davidson sign and then walk a bit further to little Hawaii. This place rocks and is must in Vegas. The staff was incredible friendly as well."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. They made fresh corn tortillas when we walked in and doubled them up so they wouldn't break under the weight of all the fillings! 
Many meat options, barbocoa and marinated pork were delicious! Lots of options for toppings including pico, cheese, hot sauces, and more. Great deal at taco platter was $9.95 for 3 tacos with beans and rice."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed with this place to be honest. First of all the price. I payed 14 bucks for a taco plate with chips and salsa. That doesn't even include a drink! As for the food... The tacos. The carne asada tasted closer to ground up McDonald's burgers than quality carne asada. The rice was dry and undercooked, and the beans tasted as if they were straight out of a can. They were also doing some sort of construction inside and at times I couldn't even here the person sitting next to me. I wouldn't recommend this place unless you had very low standards for a taco shop."}
{"text":"Was excited to eat here, ordered 3 tacos al pastor with traditional trimmings -- onion, cilantro, hot sauce. Very disappointed to have super-dry meat. Maybe it was because I arrived at 5:30pm and it wasn't busy, but had been hoping for something at least as good as a taco truck."}
{"text":"pretty good. open from 11am- 5am so it is perfect for drunk munchies, food after the club, or hangover food. 
Friendly staff
Recommend the marinated pork.
Seating outside.
Reasonable pricing considering everything in Vegas is \"$$\" and up
Music and shops surround you."}
{"text":"Love this spot! Prices are good for the strip, food is better than what you will find in the overpriced mexican themed restaurants in nearby casinos. The Habenero salso is HOT!!! I come to vegas 2 -3 months out of the year .... Usually here for 2 weeks at a spell.... I come here every other day! In a city where you don't always get the quality you pay for, I feel this taco shop exceeds the norm! The spicy pork is delicious , and the carnitas is moist and full of flavor. Great lunch spot when you are in a hurry."}
{"text":"This was a good spot to dip in on after spending a few hours at the black jack table. They were open late so it worked out perfectly to stop off and grab a bite to eat before heading back to the hotel. The tacos were alright and it was the end of the night so meat options were drastically reduced. 

Still overall a good place for a late night bite when other options aren't available."}
{"text":"Cheap eats for the strip, at $2 a taco. Reminds me of a taco shop subway. Meats premade so they don't always have what's on the menu. Tacos were ok, But not great. Chips tasted like old grease."}
{"text":"Great authentic tacos on the strip.  Not a crappy overpriced chain restaurant.  Nice seating area as well!"}
{"text":"Nice little place out of the way from all the people. The food was solid and made very quickly. Staff was really nice"}
{"text":"It's a small place. The food is good. This place is usually one of our favorite places to eat but since last visit, prices has gone up and same as an actual sit down restaurant. They charge for extra salsa or extra anything. Whereas in a restaurant, those usually just come free. Cost of each entree is 9.50+. No substitutions allowed. This was my first Mexican food choice in Vegas but given that their prices is same as a restaurant and they want to charge extra for everything and won't substitute more rice instead of beans... It's no longer my #1 choice"}
