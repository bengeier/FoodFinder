{"text":"Nothing really special, found the food over priced for the amount and quality. Over all it was okay."}
{"text":"They prepare their miso soup exactly the way I love it! Would definitely recommend for tofu lovers :) I have yet to try their sushi though.  Looking forward to it!"}
{"text":"Great sushi for a low price. Can be hit or miss at times, but for the most part its solid."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff, very fast service and loved the ambiance.  The soup was great, but I've had better. Sushi and General Tao were very well done and presented. I would say they were generous with the General Tao and you definitely get your money's worth."}
{"text":"This is my first time eating at a non \"All You Can Eat\" sushi restaurant.  I noticed a real difference in the quality of the maki rolls.  The salmon sashimi just melts in your mouth.  We ordered the sashimi, rainbow, bagel, rockland, dragon eye, kejaki and rinsha.  All choices were excellent.  This is a clean and cozy mom and pop sushi restaurant.  What you see in picture comes up to about 64$ plus tip."}
{"text":"I was a bit thrown off when i first received the menu. This is a sushi restaurant but they also had Thai and Szechuan food? Usually that means the food isn't necessarily authentic or specialized when they offer other ethnic cuisines. The menu had all sorts of typos like Niso Soup and Sea Weet soup, weird. My boyfriend and I had low expectations and wanted to leave but didn't want to be rude. The waitress was quite unprofessional too. She was nice but she told my boyfriend to pass her his water glass. That's weird too. They should be serving us, not asking us to do things for them. Anyway, we ordered only a few rolls: avocado, spicy salmon, fish roe, and veggie roll. The presentation was actually surprisingly nice. Also the spicy salmon was VERY good. In general this place, their sushi i'd say is not bad. But it's not the best or the greatest. Service needs to be better and they need to fix the typos in their menus."}
{"text":"I've been ordering from here for years, but after a long time away I finally had the chance to order in some of my fave sushi once again. I'm not sure if the original concept of this restaurant was to be sushi based or not, but I would that if you stick to that, you'll be pleasantly surprised. There are Chinese options as well, but unless you're dining with someone who won't touch sushi, then you can safely pass it by (not that it's terrible, my mom really likes their crispy duck actually).  I vary my order from time to time, but my favorite roll is the Hawaii which has pineapple, spicy salmon, tempura, tobiko and avocado. The rolls are big and not filled with rice so you actually taste everything. The prices are pretty damn reasonable and they deliver, which is a bonus when you want to wear your stretchy pants and chow down. Sure it's not a haute omakase experience, but I'm pretty sure you'll leave satisfied."}
{"text":"I'm sure the sushi is great here, but I will never know because I could not place an order for delivery. Although the restaurant offers free delivery, the girl answering the phone was very difficult to talk to and when asked if the order could come in for a specific time, almost 2 hours from the time of placing the order, she kept repeating that she did not know when the driver would be able to make it and could not confirm a time. This is ridiculous, for people who work in the area and have only a certain amount of time for lunch, 2 hours is more than enough time to confirm if they can deliver. Very disappointed with the service and this restaurant needs to find someone who can speak to people properly over the phone if they want to offer delivery."}
{"text":"Awful teriyaki plates. We ordered lunch specials with teriyaki chicken and another with salmon. The chicken had been marinated for too long in salt and pepper making me wonder if that chicken was super old. Both plates were drowning in sauce. The side salads were icey cold and going brown. We had some sushi as well, nothing too special. Giving the place an extra point for decent service."}
