{"text":"Had dinner at this place yesterday. Let me just say if it werent for the fact that we had a gift card which covered most of the dinner, I would be steaming. I read the reviews on here before going and thought maybe we would luck up on our experience. No such luck. They totally lived up to their reputation of slow service and below par food. After waiting at least a half hour in the practically empty place, I finally received my entree, Chicken Marsala, which arrived smothered in some strange gelatin like sauce that I found totally disgusting. My husband's salmon was only average and bland. The only good part about dining there was the waitress was super nice so we did leave her a tip despite the long wait and sub-par food. Needless to say, this one is definitely off the list, we wont be going back."}
{"text":"Food is so-so.  Wait staff is slow.  Typical chain."}
{"text":"We took my father here for his birthday.  Pasta at home would have been a better choice.

We arrived in the parking lot with the other 5 vehicles. We would soon know why the lot was so empty on a friday evening.  We were greeted by our server after 5 minutes of waiting.  There were several loud tables around us.  I took our server another 10 minutes to get our sangria.  They appeared to be short staffed.

We waited around 20 minutes for our meals. No manager visit to our table. We ordered dessert, our table was never pre-bussed, and the servers tried to set the desserts in front of us with our dirty dishes. Finally, my dessert was the lemon cream cake. I have had this dessert several times. It is a moist lemony creamy cake.  My cake was dried out and tasted like soured milk. I told our server. She offered another dessert, i declined. Again, no manager visit to our table.  I will not return to this restaurant.  This Johnny Carinos has gone down hill since we moved here in 2004."}
{"text":"We have only eaten at this location once, but have been eating at Carinos for years.  Although it can get noisy, I like the style and feel of Carinos. 

We always order the Italian Nachos for an appetizer.  Yum!  As for entrees, we have tried several different things and all have been good. The bread they serve is warm and tasty - although they changed it a few years ago and I do prefer the previous version.

Our service was good, but I will say the location is odd in the respect that the building faces the road with the parking to the side.  It's awkward. 

Personally, the food at Carinos is way better than Olive Garden and the overall dining experience is much better."}
{"text":"How do you give less than one star?  Our waiter stood behind the counter and chatted while we waited for our drinks.  By the time he got back, we left.  His loss, we are good tippers when we receive good service."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I are always up for trying a new restaurant since both of us are \" foodies \". Johnny Corino's came up on our radar... I wish it hadn't...

The food was NOT good. The quality was terrible. I had the shrimp pasta. The shrimp tasted like it hadn't been cleaned properly, the noodles were worse than al dente. The red sauce tasted like something Hungry Man packaged. My girlfriend had the mushroom ravioli, which was also cold. The creme sauce was chunky and didn't compliment the ravioli at all. 

The service was outstanding. The server was friendly and prompt and was consistent with keeping the drinks filled, as well as serving the other tables."}
{"text":"I'd say the review above me about sums it up.  This place is like a knock-off Caraba's with bad service.

So, maybe it was me, but I walked in the door that was facing the parking lot.  Wrong door, you gotta go to the one facing the busy street.  Then I waited for close to 10 minutes for a hostess, and finally got a bartender.  She sat us and I noticed there were only 5 other tables with customers.

We sat, order the appetizer combo.  I asked if they had any pale ale's, waitress looked confused and said no.  Our appetizer combo took a little bit, but finally came.  It wasn't a combo it was just fire sticks(edible).  Finally our waitress came back, we told her, she said she'd fix it.  We got some Calamari, but no mozzarella sticks.  We just let it go, but I found it funny she said she wouldn't charge us for the calamari(which was chewy).  IT CAME WITH THE COMBO.  So after a good 15mins+ later we finally got our food.  While waiting I noticed many others not looking happy.  My mom got the spicy shrimp and pasta, was edible.  I got the lobster ravioli.  Waaaaaaaaaay too creamy of a sauce and not much flavor.  Only ate there because I was staying close by, I'll be sure to anti-recommend for friends.  I prety much wasted $50."}
{"text":"This place was GREAT!!!!! The atmoshere was nice, the setting was quaint. Our server, Kevin, was very friendly and was quick to get us what we needed. I went with my family and they all enjoyed it. I had a spicy shirmp and chick, which was to die for. My wife pertook of an angelhair with artichokes dish that she just loved. My two sons had the baked tort that they liked, which is odd because they usually don't like what they eat when we go out. Again our server was very nice and funny. It defenitly had to be some of the best service we've had. So I strongly recommend taking your family to eat here."}
{"text":"Southern Italian you say? Sounds good to me, I say! Unfortunately the experience I had at this Johnny Carino's was not up to par with the JC I usually go to in Raleigh. The service here was really slow, and even though I ordered my food to go to pick up at the curbside, when I got there they said the kitchen had been backed up so my food still wasn't ready by the time they said it would be. Instead I ended up waiting an additional 15 minutes outside in my car. On top of that my main entree basically had no seasoning and was in serious need of some hot sauce or salt intervention asap. Needless to say I was very disappointed. My appetizer, the stuffed mushrooms, was a lot better but there was much more 'stuffing' than mushroom so it made for a strange eating experience since the stuffing would fall off the top and I would tast that first and then the mushroom bottom would be eaten separately. The side salad and dressing were good, as was the bread. The chocolate cake I got was way too dense for me and I was only able to eat a few bites before it was chocolate overload. I might try out JC's again in Raleigh (where I have always had a good experience) but I doubt I'll come to this location again - especially since my temporary job in the area is ending soon and I'm rarely in the Charlotte area."}
{"text":"Johnny Carinos is a southern Italian restaurant across the street from Wal-Mart at exit 60 on I-85. This was my first time going, and was recommended buy a couple of friends. Needless to say, I wasn't all that impressed. 

When my husband and I arrived, the restaurant was not busy at all, but we had to wait a good 5 to 7 minutes just to have the hostess come to the hostess stand to seat us. We get seated in the back, right next to the kitchen, which later on we were pretty warm after the kitchen got started cooking. Our waiter was a nice guy, but slow on the uptake. There was one point during our dinner where he didn't come back for about 15 minutes because he had to make salads and another waitress to take our drink orders for a 2nd time. It was pretty annoying.

As for the food, the menu is pretty extensive. It ranges from a 16 layer lasagna to a simple chicken parmesan. I had the 5 meat bow tie pasta with a sweet tea. The pasta was good, but when I got the meal, it was very luke warm like it had been sitting in the window for almost too long. My husband got the lasagna and he was disgusted with it. He said that it was too cold, the price for the portion he received was too much, and he said the meal tasted like it was frozen and then quick defrosted in the microwave. He was very disappointed in his meal. Our friends got chicken parmesan which said was OK, and her husband ordered a chicken fettuccini ham alfredo bowl. It was odd because the ham was a slice of ham (that looked to me like it was from your local grocery store deli) instead of in pieces. He also said it was OK, just enough to be filling.

The desserts were very good. There are only 4 to choose from, but their turtle cheesecake and bread pudding were excellent. The cheesecake wasn't overbearing with the caramel like most turtle desserts usually are. The cheesecake itself, chocolate fudge, caramel, and nuts were balanced nicely to give it a great flavor. As for the bread pudding, it too had a nice blend of everything. It was soaked in mascarpone custard and topped with vanilla ice cream, complete with a little sprinkle of cinnamon. 

Last but not least, the drinks were OK, though I think the bar tender was intent on getting my husband drunk. He had 2 Bellini's and he was quite tipsy. I tasted a little of his drink and it was defiantly over powering on the rum. To me, the bar tender needs to go back to bar tending school and learn how to use the measurement cups because both drinks would have knocked your socks off."}
{"text":"We were traveling down the highway and decided to stop at this exit after a long day of driving. Were gonna go to the Ruby Tuesdays (should've done that!) but saw this place and thought about giving it a try. 

I dont know what anyone sees in a place like this. To me, it's just another example of urban sprawl, bad chain food proliferation and so many folks out there settling for mediocre food like this. Somehow, those things all seem to go together.

If you compare it to probably who the executive management likes to think its competing with, you could bring up the name Olive Garden. But, the Olive Garden and Carrabas have something this place doesn't have....a more well thought out menu and recipes that work for the most part.

I had the spinach salad. I guess I didn't read the description too well as it came out with fried chicken and onion rings on top. I was looking for something healthy and this was the last thing I expected. And, the warm bacon dressing and bleu cheese was a little weird with Italian spiced fried chicken.  

Appetizer bread was tasteless. And, dipping oil was pretty bad....had \"roasted garlic\" in it but seemed to be old, dry and stale. 

Wife got honey glazed salmon. I asked how it was as she said it basically passed as a vegetable and a protein but not much more than that. Bright spot....Thing 1 and Thing 2 got pasta and really loved it. I'm thinking that they were just hungry cause I tasted the marinara sauce and it seemed like a less-than-average mid-grade sauce.

Service was unbelievably slow (they were only half full) but the waiter / bar tender was very nice and made an effort. 

If stopping at this exit, or shopping in the local mall, choose something else. This is not worth it."}
