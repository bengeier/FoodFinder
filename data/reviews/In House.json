{"text":"Great Pineapple Spritzer with quick customer service.  Very clean and I love the coffee bar to sit for a bit."}
{"text":"Went here with my Mom yesterday, and was not impressed. I always see that it's busy every time I walk into the mall from Nordstrom and wanted to try it out. I ordered a hot vanilla latte and it was so strong I couldn't drink it. Basically tasted like straight espresso couldn't taste any of the vanilla. To each their own, but I'll be sticking with Starbucks in the future."}
{"text":"The best nordie bar to snack on. Grab a few lattes and good to go. Hot drinks and cold ones too. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Great little coffee bar at the downstairs entrance of Nordstrom's inside the Chandler Fashion Square Mall. These guys took the Starbucks theme and made it as good or better. I think the coffee is a little better than Starbucks actually.  Try the Red Tea Latte!  It's fantastic!  The staff was very friendly too."}
{"text":"Nice little cafe right outside Nordstrom in the Chandler mall. I bit hectic because of the older mall clients,  but they do a good job with the foam on the specialty drinks.  I prefer soy milk, and Starbucks tends to just make the soy milk warm, not foamy.  There is a nice bar area to hang out and a more private table area in the back. The coffee tasted roasted, not burnt-- a huge plus. They were nice enough to provide the coffee notes on the Debut Espresso brand ( see attached photo)."}
{"text":"Everything I come to the mall, this is my go to place for coffee and sweet bread. The people are fantastic, more businesses should learn from them"}
{"text":"Great service always. Once in awhile in the early mornings it gets backed up, but the ppl are always nice and efficient. They always remember my order. The pomegranate iced tea is splendid and their green chili bagels with veggie cream cheese are perfect for the morning kick."}
