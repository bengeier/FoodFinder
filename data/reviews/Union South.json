{"text":"Union South is all grown up.  It's beautiful and very cool--a great hangout.  U. South: you had me at \"bowling alley downstairs\" and \"awesome bathrooms.\""}
{"text":"Union south is pretty, but there are a couple real problems related to the kitchen/food service that need to be remedied.  1)  The smell of grease permeates much of the building, especially meeting spaces.  Could something please be done to alleviate the problem?  It's really nauseating to sit in a meeting for 90 minutes immersed in the smell of old greasy air.  2) Catering for meetings is really sub-par and over priced.  My main complaint is that  sandwiches bread is SOGGY/WET.  Are they prepared the night before and left to stew in their own juices?  It seems that other food service venues have mastered the art of dry sandwiches....I'm hoping YOU can too!    Final concern is around the \"green\" toilets.  The low volume flush requires double flushing to get TP to go down.  Can an adjustment be made so they are a bit more efficient with a single flush?  That would be groovy!"}
{"text":"Oh Union South.  You're the unpopular step-sister to everyone's favorite, the Memorial Union.  \"Underutilized\" is how the UW describes you, and they're going to tear you down.  But I'll never forget you.  We've had some times, you and I.  From the first day of SOAR orientation that summer before my freshman year to last spring, when I saw D4 again at Club 770 - the good times, they're all coming back to me.  Let's reminisce...  Remember those two years when I thought electrical engineering was a good idea?  Yeah I know, but I was just a freshman & sophomore back then and didn't know any better.  But you were always there, especially when the oppressive silence of Wendt Library got to be too much.  Sometimes it would be just as quiet downstairs, but at least I could read the historic letters along the wall when I got tired of trying to understand Stats.  And all of those Game Day Saturdays too - everyone seems to like you then, with your Alumni Bashes and brats and such.  But I was there even when there were no large sporting events nearby, because you and I had something more than just a Saturday hook-up in the fall.  All of those shows at Club 770 were the best when I was underage.  Sure, the sound wasn't the best and the \"club\" is more of a convention room with a little riser, but those free all-ages shows were some of the best times of my young life.  Remember the first time I saw Dillinger 4 and my friend left because her date didn't like punk?  It was just you, me and the band, and it was awesome.  You and I will always have those three magical D4 shows over the years.  And that time my friends and I saw Evil Dead 2 on Halloween Night - that was the best Halloween I ever had.    And don't think I don't remember the later years, when Natan and I would meet in the afternoon and play ping pong downstairs in the Games Room.  Remember how I nearly always lost?  Ahh, that was fun, especially listening to the crazy bowling \"professor\" berating the kids who must have thought, \"Bowling, now there's an easy PE credit.\"  I guess they didn't count on getting the R. Lee Ermey of bowling instructors.  Before our epic ping pong tourney, Natan and I would always go to the Red Oak Grill for lunch.  It was always the same thing - Badger burger for Natan, grilled chicken sandwich with fries for me.  Yeah, the food was never that great, but it was pretty cheap and it was fun trying to guess which student cashier would be the slowest - I always won that game, didn't I?  You got a little fancy with Einsteins, but that's OK because I never went there.  We had a good thing going with the Red Oak, and I didn't see any reason to mess with that.  I'm going to miss you, Union South.  I'm sure your replacement building will be architecturally pleasant to look at and will be chock full of fancy features, but it won't be the same.  We've got our memories, and they can't take those away.  Hey, we've still got a couple of months before your date with the wrecking ball.  Let's make a few more memories, shall we?  I'll meet you at the Quick Byte for a cup of coffee, because you know what Union South: you A-OK in my book."}
{"text":"I really like this place! I love the UW-Madison students have a cool place like this to go to, and even us non-UW students can taken advantage of it. It's really cozy, and I love the fireplace with all of the seating. They have a few food vendors and ice cream there, which makes me so happy. I've attended a few conferences upstairs, seen a few movies, and even gone to a Luau! This building kind of does it all and has a great ambiance while doing it all so well!"}
{"text":"The new Union South is fantastic!  Great features and of course they serve Babcock Dairy Ice Cream!  I wish I would have had more time to check out more of the features, but all in good time.  Can't wait to experience a game day there!"}
{"text":"I can't speak to how the local students like this place, but 2 bars + bowling are A-OKAY by me."}
{"text":"Union South is one of the two student unions, located on the University of Wisconsin campus.  Please see my posted photograph of the atrium area, as visible on the main floor.  The other student union, which is located at the west terminus of Langdon Street, has the same array of utilitarian features as Union South, is further distinguished by its traditional Ivy League architecture, taproom, and terrace on the lake.  Union South is located close to the biochemistry department, computer science department, and Randall Stadium.  Inside is an atrium with a balcony one floor up, where the balcony surrounds the atrium.  Downstairs is a bowling alley and ping pong facility.  I have enjoyed the following activities at Union South:  (1)  INFORMATION BOOTH AND CONVENIENCE STORE.  At the center of Union South is an information booth and vendor.  Please see my photograph with me in the middle (I am wearing a U.C. Berkeley parka).  (2)  CAFETERIA.   Cafeteria with regular tables and also booths located against the walls.  At the cafeteria, I sometimes had lunch with my best friend, Dr. Kevin Block, who worked in the next laboratory from mine.  (3)  BOWLING AND PING PONG.  Bowling alley and ping pong room.  I played ping pong there with Dr. Takami Ueno, from my laboratory.  (4)  CLUBS AND CLASSES.  Rooms that can be reserved for organizations.  As a member of the Kickapoo Cloggers, the university let us have weekly practice sessions, and also weekly public sessions.  This was kind of the university, especially in light of the fact that our tap shoes caused scuffing on the surface of the floors.  Also, before joining the cloggers, I took some elementary dance lessons in Union South, including disco dance where I learned the SOUL CITY WALK and the ULTRA-SPANK, and I took elementary tap dance, where I learned shuffle off to buffalo and other steps.    (5)  RESTAURANT.  Small restaurant, located on the northern side within Union South.  I had lunch here dozens of times, sometimes with my laboratory ( vitamin K lab ).  I only have one gripe.  As is the case for many restaurants, this restaurant provides sauerkraut for your bratwursts.  But at Union South, the sauerkraut is on ice.  When I first moved to Wisconsin, I wondered how this most German of the states (Wisconsin) in the United States of America could mess up this most characteristic example of German cuisine (the bratwurst).  Sauerkraut is supposed to be served steamed.  Therefore, for a responsibly prepared bratwurst, I recommend going elsewhere, for example, FOX AND HOUNDS in Hubertus, WI, or TOP DOG in Berkeley, CA.  (6) SHOWS.  Union South also has live performances at the terraces located at the northwest corner, and on the southern side.  For example, at Union South I saw live performances of bluegrass band STONE SOUP, featuring famed recording artist Karen Gogolick.  Also, I saw a performance of Royal Lichtenstein Quarter Ring Circus.  (7)  MOTEL.  Union South also has a motel for visiting scholars.  Once, a visiting scholar from Shionogi Pharmaceuticals was visiting our laboratory.  He stayed at Union South."}
{"text":"I work from home a lot.    What, you thought social workers meet people all day??   Pssshhhh, we are stuck at our desks writing assessments of those meetings with people that might as well transport me right back to graduate school with 20 page research papers due except now it is client assessments and there are 10 of them due and each client brings a new assessment due date.   Point is I write a lot.  And if it gets crazy during business hours I have to finish stuff at home.  Why not do work in style?    I found the perfect spot to write my assessments at Union South.  It is in the Sun Garden, on the couches next to the huge roaring fireplace and expansive windows with the snow outside looking picturesque.  And for a minute I can hold my Mocha in hand and think of how gorgeous the snow falling truly is, instead of thinking about the fact that it is almost April and winter is refusing to let go.  I found my hideaway.  I will hibernate here until the spring thaw."}
{"text":"This place is completely new compared to what I remember years ago.  It was cool to see the newly renovated place.  There are lots of places to eat now on the first floor and rooms up on the second.  I was here for a medical alumni event in one of the upstairs room and the food was good they prepared.    It wasn't anything spectacular nor anything bad so it gets the A-OK by me.  Definitely will stop in to use their new bathrooms before the next game but not sure if I would eat or drink there over other places in the area."}
{"text":"Awwww! Union South?! You are not the Union South of my college days, now are you? So impressed with how much you have grown up with your new renovation. A new and improved bowling alley, multiple pool tables, and a rock-climbing wall? Plenty of bars throughout the joint, several restaurants, and Babcock ice cream right around the corner from the in-house UWCU?! WOWZA! Top that off with a small hotel on the top floors and I was floored! You've definitely come a long way from the days when you were just a secondary to Memorial Union and often skipped over. Glad you are finally getting the love you deserve!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is great, the ice cream is great, and the look/environment is great! I've been here dozens of times for an event by one of the UW clubs. The group I was with were a little shy since because of the nature of the event, but I wish more of the events would be hosted here. It's just really great. I never got a chance to check out the rock climbing wall and now I'm seeing that there's a bowling alley. Man, I really need to come back here more often now that I live closer. The parking was always the downside to this place."}
{"text":"I am one of those people that had to go to the old US to get their student ID for school. A dark, hard to find place. This new US does not only offers a modern style but also combines a multipurpose venue: from a movie theater, several restaurants, attached hotel, accessible parking ramp, bowling alley, and many more. Located in the middle of campus this is an excellent venue for students and alumna. It hosts many events throughout the year such as the Badger Bash, UW-events, etc.  I've been here many times either for work functions or personnel functions. This new venue is really nice. There are plenty of different sized rooms throughout US for any kind of event. Everything, including the bathrooms are clean and everything is well signed."}
{"text":"I can't believe it's been five years since the new Union South opened! It is leaps and bounds better than the US of my day, even though I had so many amazing memories from the old building.   Housing a multipurpose music venue, movie theater, hotel, bowling alley, several restaurants, and myriad other things, it's a great stop for students and alumna alike.   Concerts and films are usually free for students and Union Members, and the cost of things like bowling are definitely on the affordable end seeing as their main demographic is college students. Parking under the building is limited and pricy, but you can usually find street parking in the neighborhood.   On game days, US hosts Badger Bash, a tailgate party with the UW Marching Band and family-friendly activities before the game.   In my advanced age (aka my 30s) I don't spend as much time there as I did in my 20s, but I'm still there a few times a year for a movie or concert or as a meeting spot during the day. Meeting for ice cream is much more fun than meeting for coffee."}
{"text":"Love the fact it has a BCycle out front.  It's new.  The kick off parties prior to the game are always killer.   Great location for the Western side of campus as it's next door to DOIt."}
{"text":"Is that you, Union South?? You cleaned up real nice.  I once thought this run-down building was just the place to get your student ID replaced when you inevitably left it at the SERF... but no more. Now it feels like an actual student union, where people really hang out. It's much more modern than Memorial Union (since it's basically brand new) and it comes equipped with pool tables, a bowling alley, a cafeteria, a beer/wine/cider bar, a climbing wall (ARE YOU KIDDING?), a movie theater, a stage for music and a huge screening area on which to cheer for the Badgers when you don't have tickets. There's a bike sharing station right there too, which is convenient.  We were here on game day after tailgating. The crowd wasn't as rambunctious as we were during the game, but we were not escorted from the premises for doing victory dances around our table (while everyone else sat quietly). Nor for the subsequent defeat dances all around the pool tables. So I appreciate that. I really do."}
{"text":"I am lucky ( or unlucky however you look at it) to recall the old Union South. If you were around the UW Campus area in the past 3+ years, you'd know it was a dump. Horrible building that didn't have enough space, resources or eatery's for students, staff, faculty and the general public. I was overjoyed when they tore down the old Union South and turned into a more retro space.  Unlike other student unions I've visited, it's nice that UW Madison allows the space to be utilized by the general public. You can book rooms, order catering, stay at their hotel, go bowling and rock climbing and tons more. This is actually something I commend UW Madison for allowing. The union is more than just a place for students to eat, meet up with friends and study but it's also a business.    I do think the food could be better and this includes catering. I find their prices to be a bit ridiculous. While I worked at UW my junior and senior year as an undergrad, I had to order catering for certain events. Understanding that I just said they are too a business, I can go to other local places and have them cater for a much cheaper price. There are no discount for students or employees on the food  which is unfortunate.   As for the actually restaurants that can be found at Union South, they serve as great places for college students to work part time. I've eaten every restaurant they Union has to offer.   The Ginger Root which is an American version of Asian inspired food ( fried rice, egg rolls, curry, etc). Food is not bad. For what you pay, you really can't complain too much about it not being top notch.   Then there is Urban Slice which is a pizza joint. Very cool looking restaurant. Slices are good sizes and are about $2.50 per slice.   You have the convenience store, Badger Market, which sales typical products that you'd find at a gas station.  Peet's Coffee is a café that sales coffee, teas, pastries and other typical café food and drinks. Love that they have a fire place!  Harvest Grains is a sandwich eatery. Sandwiches are better than what I would have expecting them to be. This is also the most diet friendly restaurant  Of course, there is the Daily Scoop, scooping out the variety of ice cream flavors. Expect long lines suring the summer months!    Lastly, is The Sett. A simple burger and beer grille. I really like their fries though I try to not get them. They are very greasy. They have this HUGE screen where they show sports and movies. There is also a stage. You can rent out the space if you want to host a talent show. I must say, because the room echo's a lot, I am not sure if this is actually a good place to host these kinds of events. Sounds carries too much.    So much has improved here over the last 2 years. Better computers, more seating area's, chargers for electronics and so on. You can also book campus tour here at the Information Desk   If you're in the area, Union South is a great place to bring the kids and family. Parking lot is horrible. Far too small. If you have an SUV, you will have a difficult time parking in their garage. Someone tore off my mirror because they tried to squeeze in a parking space next to me. Plus, you have these large cement beams that takes up too much space between parks. I would recommend parking at Lot 17 unless you park at the Union earlier in the morning. You will have the best access to the better parking spaces.  Early bird catches the worm."}
{"text":"WOAH. Union South got an Oprah style makeover! This place is a far cry from the dingy bowling alley/Wisc card location of the past.   The new Union South boasts a handful of hotel rooms, comfortable lounging spaces, various restaurants and eateries, a rock climbing wall and a brand-spankin' new bowling alley. Additionally, the space is beautifully set up and very tech savvy throughout. I.was.blown.away.  Whether you're a student, alumni or just someone who is looking to check out a great tailgate, you should certainly stop at Union South."}
{"text":"I've been to a few functions at Union South (both personal and professional). The venue is new and really nice now. They have plenty of different sized rooms throughout the venue for lots of different types of events. The movie theater is awesome! The rooms, bathrooms, etc are all labeled nicely for guests to find their way around. There are plenty of stair options (and an elevator) for getting to various floors. This is a great venue with a hotel attached. Perfect for your out of town guests to stay after a wedding or conference. There is a parking ramp in the building for hotel guests and patrons. Limited though and fills up fast."}
{"text":"As much as I love my alma mater, the Union South facilities really makes me reconsider my choice of undergraduate institution. Alas, if only I was that young again."}
{"text":"This is a very nice facility for the students. I attended a meeting here for a consortium that was being hosted by UW Engineering. It was a very comfortable venue easily accommodating the 75 or 100 persons attending. The student facilities seemed to be very comfortable with plenty of outdoor seating on both the ground floor patio and the second level deck to allow full enjoyment of the weather. I only wish Student Unions exhibited this sort of quality when I was in college."}
{"text":"This space made me fall in love with Madison. We came on a Friday afternoon in early summer. Bands playing, beer trucks, fresh fish tacos, sitting on the dock - does life get better? If winter wasn't so dang cold in Madison I would move in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Union South is the newer of the two Student Union buildings.  There are many food stops available there that are relatively quick.  The movie theater/lecture hall on the second floor.  The Sett for beers, burgers, and watching the Badgers on a big screen.  It is where you can find several UW offices (i.e for identification).  Wisconsin Film Festival ticket office can be found there during the weeks before and during the Festival.    There are nice places to sit and read, study, or chatter with friends all over the building.  It is open to all, which is nice.  I have seen some good bands in The Sett.  Attended a Fundraiser there, too.  There is a hotel attached to the building if one needs to stay close to campus.  It's a cool campus building available to everyone."}
{"text":"Try the stir fry wok restaurant. The peets coffee. The hotel. And check out the restaurants at the discovery center across the street."}
{"text":"The grungy old Union South was sort of an unknown spot for most UW Students back when I went to school here. Sometimes the student concert folks would book a great band or two downstairs, and perhaps you might have been bowling here, but other than that, there was not much going on here. Fast forward to 2012, and you have a pretty cool lodge feel to the place - everything is very modern and new looking and you also have a hotel here. Way to go UW. Now, I knew there were rooms here in the old days, but they now have a professional hotel lobby and friendly staff to help you. This is also the place where you get your UW ID. Otherwise the \"complex\" really is a place for those who are on the South campus to hang out. Nice job UW. It is a little slick and clean and feels like a real hotel lounge, bar, etc., but compared to the dingy predecessor it is quite an improvement."}
