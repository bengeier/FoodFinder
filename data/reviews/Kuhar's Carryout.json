{"text":"Always good food a Kuhar's.  Daily specials keep the menu fresh and different, while regular dinners are always there \"just in case\" you don't wanna try the stuffed cabbage (but you should!).

Just had the St. Moritz Schnitzel yesterday.  Awesome dish... and it's HUGE (well worth the cost)."}
{"text":"On my very first visit, I was very impressed with the friendly service at Kuhar's!!! It felt like I walked into a down to earth, family owned restaurant--which appreciated my business. 

They offer Daily Specials, such as fried chicken, Swiss Steak, Chicken Paprikash, spaghetti and meatballs, fish, roast pork, Hungarian Goulash, stuffed cabbage, Wiener Schnitzel, breaded pork, Pierogis, sausage and sauerkraut, chops, roast beef, and Salisbury Steak.

Kuhar's markets their business as serving \"Exclusive European Cuisine\" and \"Olde World Entrees.\" However, I'm a fan of their turkey club sandwiches, chef salads, and homemade soups!!! Also, I'm a big fan of their fresh, homemade bread--which is prepared on site--everyday! 

All of their sandwiches includes your choice of: fries, potato salad, mashed potatoes, or home fries. And for those watching their waistlines, they offer a \"Weight-Watchers\" Sandwich--that includes lean ground sirloin, cottage cheese, lettuce, tomato, and a pickle.

For those who love desserts, Kuhar's serves  a variety of delicious custard squares, strudels, and cakes!!!..My favorites are their Cheese Cake and their German Chocolate cake."}
{"text":"I love this place! I've been going here since I was a kid and they were in Euclid. It's still clean super friendly and always love the music when I come in. Super fresh delicious bread that comes with you're meal and simple salad. Great mashed potatoes and gravy definitely not instant. I always order the wiener schnitzel it's always amazing! They also have tasty deserts!"}
{"text":"Yet another good example of a locally owned place that might be easily overlooked given its location and proximity to fast food chains.

Tried them for lunch recently and wasn't disappointed in the German fare they offer. The Hungarian style sausage included in the house platter was tasty, though I would have preferred a good knockwurst with my wienerschnitzel. Slightly disappointed they didn't have kartoffelpfannkuchen at the time of my order, but the cheese sticks were very good, if not quite authentic.

Friendly, prompt service. Skip Chipotle and that shit sushi-bullcrap place across the street and give this place a go. It's also only carry out, so cross the street to the Save on Tobacco and buy a few good German beers to wash your meal down with."}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place, especially on Wednesdays (specials are weiner schnitzel and chicken paprikash) and Mondays (special is goulash). Their number is on speed-dial on my cell so I can call them when I finish grocery shopping and pick up my order on my way home."}
{"text":"Great food.  Love the weiner schnitzel and the bread is to die for.  Staff is always friendly.  Great food for the price.  The potato pancakes are delicious too."}
{"text":"Food is still very good. Wish they would update the side salad to something other than lettuce and a piece of cucumber. Maybe a menu revision would be good as well.

Has the food gotten better/worse? Nope, still reliably the same. 

Lost point? Inattention to details. No cutlery provided for take away orders. Reduced portion sizes.

Still great food, but time for some changes..."}
{"text":"Place is amazing. Excellent home cooked meal. Ended up getting the Hungarian Goulash, was sooo good.   So many choices, can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Very good food, the staff is very friendly. Portion sizes are great. Everyday there are different specials which is very unique. You never leave hungry."}
{"text":"Working on my car tonight, and stopped at Kuhar's along the way.  Hadn't been since they were in Euclid, and I'm glad I did.  Spaghetti and meatballs, salad and bread for 8.95.  Clean, nice people.  You need to go!!"}
{"text":"Yay! Just like I remember when my visiting my grandparents who always would order Kuhar's in Euclid. 15+ years later, menu and quality has stayed the same. Food is very consistent and caters to my Eastern/Southern European roots.

My favorites:

- Potato Pancakes
- Swiss Steak 
- Wiener Schnitzel
- St. Moritz Schnitzel (with ham and emmental cheese tucked inside - delicious). 

Definitely recommend for a truly home cooked meal."}
