{"text":"Ok, today it was my\" Sunday treat day\" because my boyfriend works every other Sunday so whenever he is off he spoils me taking me wherever I would like to go, so today I really wanted to try the Lao Lang restaurant but it was closed so we ended up at bahn Thai by accident, from outside it looked very simple but once you enter it is a nice place with real plants everywhere which gives you a homey feeling, Thai ornaments and pictures. 

The menu it's a little bit overwhelming, it's like if your eyes get tense without even trying, I had no idea of what to get so I chose a familiar route, a green curry with chicken and squash, zucchini and Thai eggplant, oh yeah, the whole family came to the pool hahaha. Everything was nice and tender. The consistency was thinner than any other green curries I have tried and the level of spiciness was right. My boyfriend had a red curry with duck and he said it was ok. The service was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Really good, but if you come across the \"order online\" feature, THEY DO NOT DELIVER and nowhere in ordering does it clarify that it is take-out only and not delivery. Don't learn that lesson the sad way!"}
{"text":"We went to this place on a Saturday night after trying to get a table at a different Thai place on Willy (long wait, so we left). At Bahn Thai we were immediately seated and the place did not seem terribly busy; however, after ordering, we waited 40 minutes for the appetizer, and then another hour for the main course. A beer that we had ordered when the appetizer arrived was served with the main course. I do not know if they were short on staff that night but the waiting time was unacceptable especially since we had small children with us.
That said, for Madison standards, the food was good but the wait, I dunno."}
{"text":"The curries and soups here are SOOOO tasty and they will gladly bump up your spiciness rating to \"blazing-burning-firetongue-hot\" if you ask. The dining area is cozy and cheerful, if not elegant. The service is a little slow and once in awhile you might have to ask for another table wipedown but the food is worth it. I usually go for the takeout, and it's better to phone ahead because the orders take awhile. We call Bahn Thai our \"flu food\"...if you order your dish with 4 stars it will burn out your stuffy head in no time flat. I love this place!"}
{"text":"Go for any of their curry dishes.  Immaculate!

Otherwise, a bit of a hole-in-the-wall; the service is average."}
{"text":"I've had take out once and ate in once. Both times I was very impressed by the complexity of flavors in the curry. I also finished of my mom's leftovers, which was a non curry beef dish. Very delicious, but curry is really the star of the show. They were also very accommodating of my dad's allergy concerns - he can't have peanuts or wheat, which makes Thai sometimes a hard cuisine, but he left happy and well fed."}
{"text":"I've been eating at the East Side Bahn Thai for years, and would concur with both the good and bad reviews I've seen here. It's always been hit or miss...one time, the best thai I've had, another, truly terrible. The addition of Sala Thai on the east side has now kept me from Bahn Thai, as Sala is closer and more consistent."}
{"text":"Awful pad thai, below average customer service.
I came here with my husband and another couple. 3 of us ordered pad thai and it was awful. Too sweet and too much sauce, not to mention one of the pad thai dishes contained a hair. No, not an eyelash, no , not a hair from your head. It was about an inch long and curly. Yeah, think about that for a minute.
My husband ordered a coconut curry dish, which was edible. You could probably find the exact same coconut curry dish down the road at one of the other thai restaurants.
When we first got there, the waitress asked my husband and the other gentleman what they wanted to drink, she proceeded to say \"is there anything else?\". Yeah waitress lady, there is something else. How about asking the 2 ladies what they want to drink? Is that too much to ask?

I could have made a better noodle dish with a pot of boiling water and a 15 cent package of top ramen from Woodmans.

Just sayin'.

... now that I think about it maybe they were trying to offer free crabs with every meal."}
{"text":"there were only two other couples in the entire place, yet the service was dreadfully slow. the appetizer was supposed to be a spring roll, but it ended up just being a bunch of gritty lettuce wrapped in undercooked rice paper. our entrees tasted like they'd been sitting under a heat lamp all day. the food was flavorless and the vegetables were limp. 

do not eat here. the place shouldn't be called \"bahn thai,\" it should be called \"BAD thai.\""}
{"text":"If you read my other reviews you will find that I always test the Pad See Ew when visiting a new Thai restaurant. No exception here. I ordered to go. 
The noodles were properly cooked. The dish had a generous portion of fresh, crispy broccoli and firmly steamed tofu. I asked for the dish double-Thai spicy and was not disappointed with the heat. 
I am a little afraid that this place may be in decline. The restaurant feels a bit neglected and has an obvious need to be professionally cleaned. Nevertheless, the food is excellent and the prices are good."}
{"text":"I'm on a roll to try all the Thai restaurants in Madison!

We came here on a Friday night and was greeted by our friendly host/server. We started off with an order of the spring rolls ($4.95 for two), the green curry with tofu ($11.95), and chicken pad thai ($10.95).

The spring rolls arrived with warm peanut sauce, which was a nice change to the cold dip in other restaurants.  The green curry was not a hit, the consistency and color was not appetizing and I found it a bit bland and lackluster. The pad thai was a entirely different story, one of the closer versions to the much loved, authentic, Vietnamese street food. The rice noodles were evenly covered in the sweet and sour sauce and peanuts. It was rich and a delight to slurp the silky noodles. 

We really enjoyed our server and the pad thai, I'd make this a regular just for the pad thai!

The free parking lot is a plus, especially being on Willy street."}
{"text":"More of a 2.5 star. I have 2 Thai restaurants in Madison (or restaurants that serve Thai food) that I tend away from. This is one of them. Most recently I choose to go as basic as I could; I ordered Tofu Pad Thai, Spring Rolls, and complimentary chicken soup.

The soup was great! I'd go back for some today. Spring Rolls were mediocre and Pad Thai subpar. I nearly never order Pad Thai, since there are so many takes on the dish, consistency is hard, and or frequently becomes Americanized.

Photos make the restaurant look bright & cheerful, which I didn't quite see as much in person recently. I'd love to hear some music and if I go again, I'll really try to pay attention to where I sit so I can see those shots. Staff has always been kind enough and very speedy. This restaurant remains an option for lunches while at work because of the quickness and definite affordability of lunch specials. I have not tried the dinner specials, which vary day by day - I am still up for that possibility!"}
{"text":"Theeee Best Authentic Thai dishes cooked from...Thai people!!  Imagine that?  Real Thai people cooking Thai food!  Unlike these other so-called Thai restaurants that have anyone BUT Thai people cooking the food!  That is not authentic Thai dishes!  Okay!!"}
{"text":"First time here.  It was great!  Complimentary bowl of soup was delicious.  Ordered the Panang (chicken), with red curry.  Level 2 on the heat scale.  Excellent dish, and not too hot.  So close to a 4 star rating, however there was hardly any chicken in this dish.  All rice and vegetables. Kind of a bummer on that part. Great flavors nonetheless!"}
{"text":"best place in Madison for Thai Food! I'm writing on behalf of my workplace and my own personal experience. We ordered a bunch of food for over 100 people and everyone loved it. Their vegan dishes are perfect for the vegan vegetarians.

I've ordered fried rice for myself a few times now with the 4-star spice rating and it's cooked perfect. Very spicy, very good. Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I rarely come here and I wonder why. I am having a delicious lunch. L50- Pad Mung Sawirat- tofu, broccoli, mushroom, carrots, ginger, garlic and onion in a lovely sauce generously flavored by red chili paste. I asked for medium heat and that is what I got. The dish comes with perfectly prepared rice.
As I waited for the meal an unexpected cup of soup appeared. I believe it was a well- seasoned chicken broth with some crunchy vegetables and a few noodles. It had a touch of sweetness which took the soup from ok to excellent.
The lunch price was $7.50. Right within my budget.
Why isn't Bahn Thai more crowded? The interior has greatly improved these last few years. The restaurant is clean and service is great. Give it a try."}
{"text":"Just got some excellent take out from here. Got the Pad Prik Tao Hoo (a tofu dish) and the Kiew Krob (fried wonton with pork) both are great. Just the right amount of heat. Friendly service too."}
{"text":"I live in Miami where there is really no decent Thai food. This was a welcome, delicious departure from this! Yellow tofu curry, nice and spicy. And the waitress wore a Badger shirt!"}
{"text":"If I could, I would give it 3.5 stars.  But there is a shortage of good Thai food in Madison, so compared to the city's other Thai restaurants, this one is pretty good if you order the right thing.  

I've had hit-or-miss luck with Bahn Thai. Sometimes they are right on.  Othertimes it's just pretty boring, bland Thai food.  But I've never had BAD food from here, and I really do like their mango sticky rice.  I like the lap isan (minced chicken) and the Tom Ka Kai soup.  The spring rolls are decent, and they come beautifully prepared.  So I agree -- sometimes the food isn't so hot, but give it another try, and I bet you'll find something you like."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. Highly recommend this place for any vegan in Madison. The one criticism I have is that you can hear everyone's conversation when it's quiet. Other than that highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Too bad you can't hand out NO stars.  This place doesn't even deserve the one I have to click on.  I wouldn't eat here again.  You can't go wrong with ordering fried rice...but you can at Bahn Thai!  The curry went into one hole and came right out the other.  The only reason we stopped here to eat was because I couldn't find the other place on Williamson St. I've been hearing so much about.  Save your $!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Small but cute. Must order items, appertizer chicken wings, pat Thai noodles  and yellow/ green curry w chicken."}
{"text":"The first time I went to Bahn Thai (December 2007), I wasn't pleased at all.  The dining room isn't anything special, the service was apathetic, and my mock duck curry wasn't impressive.  

I have gone back twice recently.  Our waitress was helpful and funny.  My food was so much better than a year ago that it was unbelievable.  When you order 4-stars (as spicy as they'll go), you get pretty little peppers in your meal that are as tasty as they are hot.    

What it comes down to, for me, is that if a place is (happily) open to substitutions AND can make a dish spicy enough to please my high tolerance, I can't help but be impressed."}
{"text":"Friday night...happy hour downtown...where to go for dinner after? We've spent many nights frequently the popular spots around the square or down Willy St...30 minutes to an hour later, you have a table. Not the case at Bahn Thai. We walked in and got seating immediately for a party of 8 (around 8PM). Drink options are limited, but food was great. A variety of classic Thai dishes. We shared the Panang Curry with 2 orders of spring rolls...a full meal for two, and very reasonable. While we love other Thai restaurants in town, we often don't love the wait...we'll be coming back!"}
{"text":"When I first walked in to Bahn Thai, I was pleasantly surprised by the small, intimate dining area. Given the location, I had always assumed it would be bigger. There are about 10 tables, give or take, set among tradional Thai decor, complete with an altar to ancestors. It felt so homey and welcoming, I was almost disappointed to be getting take-out.

I had conveniently placed my order online, and I was warmly received by the staff, who were prompt, polite, seemingly well organised, and competent. 

We (my boyfriend and I)ordered the Potato Pockets, Satay, Tom Ka with shrimp, and a curry with squash, carrots, beef, and coconut milk, that i cannot remember the name of. Everything was fantastic! The flavors were all full and well balanced. No one flavor was overpowering, and the dishes all complimented each other quite well. Although the menu consists of your standard Thai fare, it was prepared perfectly, with care and pride. You could practically taste the tradition. 

All in all, we were both quite satisfied with our whole Bahn Thai experience."}
{"text":"Have been here several times. My go to for Thai food. Always great. Large portions. Usually have the shrimp or chicken pad Thai which is always flavorful. The cold spring rolls are amazing and very healthy. The soups are very good too. I highly recommend this place. Have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Took my wife and boys on a Friday night, early dinner in the 6:00PM hour. Very busy with dine in and take out. Quiet place with off street parking. Food was okay, the Kai Pad Project was tasty, and not too oily. If you like it spicy you have to ask for 3 or 4 peppers on their scale. 3 was a little light for me. Penang sauce with my wife's dish was really tasty. Pad Thai for the kids was sweeter than others we have had and was missing any peanut flavor or even crushed peanuts. Bathrooms could be cleaner, prices are higher than other Thai options in Madison. We will try them again."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!! Very authentic and \"homy\". Thai music, decor, brought me back to my roots. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I have mixed emotions about my experience at Bahn Thai. Food was good, but I won't return.

The good:
- Service was friendly. Our server was personable and chatty.
- The food was yummy. It wasn't the greatest Thai food I've ever had, but it was enjoyable.

The bad:
- The restaurant itself seemed a little dingy. I could see little splatter spots on the wall by our table, probably from drinks or sauce. I saw some obvious dust on the window ledge.

The ugly:
- The bathroom was completely disgusting.The layer of dust was clearly visible on the top of the stall doors, the sink caulking was covered in black mold, the floor felt sticky, and the sewage smell was unbearable -- I held my breath. 

No matter if the food and service were decent, I can't in good conscience rate any more than two stars for a food establishment with that amount of uncleanliness in its bathroom."}
{"text":"Been eating at Bahn Thai on and off for 25 years since college. Hands down the best thai I've encountered. 35a with beef is the bomb. And the tom ka soup ridculous. They took the thai fired rice off the menu but will still make on request...you should try it."}
{"text":"This is just another Thai place, no different than any other you would go to.  The drab walls are covered with Asian pictures.  The tables are huddled together, each covered with an easily wiped glass top.  The menu is order by number, or, if you prefer, order by mangled Thai.  Unlike a lot of Williamson St., there is nothing here which strikes you as unique.

The wait staff, however, was very helpful and attentive.  There was plenty of water, which is good if you order one of the spicy dishes.  Our order was taken promptly and the check came at the right time.

The food was actually very tasty, if on the mediocre side.  We had crab rangoons, a requirement when dining at a Thai restaurant.  They were a little tough, but not too greasy or overfilled.  For dinner, I had chicken fried rice, a dish that isn't too hard to mess up.  It was very tasty from the first to last bite.  My wife had red curry, and she enjoyed it.  But again, there was nothing special and perhaps a little expensive.

So if you are hungry for Thai and in the area, I would recommend it, but don't go out of your way."}
{"text":"I had a friend visiting from New York and he wanted to go out for Thai food during his stay. We wound up having lunch with two other friends at Bahn Thai before his flight back. I first suggested Lao Laan-Xang on Willy Street. They weren't open, so I suggested Bandung, but they were in the midst of a crowded lunch rush, and we were pressed for time. Our third choice was a good one. I hadn't been to Bahn Thai for some time, and I recalled that their lunch options were fairly limited, but I was happy to see a fairly extensive list of lunch offerings. 

I had a craving for tom yum, a classic Thai soup with mushrooms, citrus leaves, lemon grass, galanga, and chili paste with shrimp, so I ordered that to share. One friend commented that the previous day he had a craving for a veggie egg roll. He got his wish, and since he didn't have a big appetite, chose the spring rolls for his entree. I ordered kang pet fach tong, a red curry with zucchini, thai eggplant, and squash with chicken, and another friend ordered the same with tofu. Bob, the visitor from New York ordered pad bai kaprow, stir fried mushrooms, onion, and basil leaves with shrimp. One of us ordered the Thai iced tea, which was deliciously milky and sweet. We were all delighted with our choices. 

Soup comes with a small bowl of their house soup, a straight-ahead chicken soup with tender vegetables. I like soup, so I had no complaints about getting double souped, with the tom yum to follow. The tom yum was outstanding, and there was plenty to share among three in our party (A shellfish allergy prevented one person from partaking). It was pleasantly spicy with a citrusy, sinus-clearing warmth that makes this soup my go-to Thai comfort food. I commented, \"They put the \"Yum!\" in tom yum. The egg-roll craving member of the party commented his food was good enough to turn that meat-and-potatoes guy into a vegetarian. The two of us who ordered squash curries reveled in the rich complexity of Thai spices, which makes this Thai standard another favorite. The bai kapow had a variety of mushrooms typical of Asian cuisine in addition to the button mushrooms so familiar to Americans. Bob really enjoyed his dish, and that's saying something since he's spent time in Thailand where his brother and sister-in-law, a Thai native, own and run a restaurant. 

The servings were ample, and Bob was the only one among us who didn't have enough to bring home for another meal. Other reasons for the five-star rating: the restaurant was calm and quiet, offering a nice respite and a pleasant contrast to the June heat and clamorous atmosphere of many other establishments, and the service was spot-on and friendly. Thanks for picking up the tab, Bob!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was more or less empty when I walked in, and it gave me time to focus on the horribly cheesy décor. Ambience is pretty much absent here. However, the food unseats Sa Bai as my go-to place. We ordered the gaeng ped and the pad see ew. The texture of the noodles was perfect--they weren't overcooked at all. The curry was a bit thin for my tastes, but it was loaded with vegetables, tofu, and pork, so that made up for it. The portions were generous (understatement) and both dishes were singe-your-nose hair spicy, just like we asked. Well done, Bahn Thai! We will definitely be returning soon. :)"}
{"text":"Yeah, it's a little on the chintzy side, but the food is good.  The Tom Ka Gai soup is wonderful, citrusy and creamy with just a hint of spice.  I haven't had their curry, but a friend of mine raves about it.  There regular rice, veggies and sauce dishes are as good as any chinese restaurant in town.  Only down side is that their Pad Thai is too sweet and a little ketchupy.  Overall, not a bad place to eat."}
{"text":"I love Bahn Thai's Shrimp Tom Yum.  In my estimation, it is the best I have had outside of Malaysia. I also love their black sticky rice with mango... drooling now just thinking of it.  

Bahn Thai is really good, but they can have quite a wait for the food.  Have good company and you won't get annoyed."}
{"text":"Very excited to see that Bahn Thai has started offering eatstreet delivery! Unlike other reviews, our first delivery experience was excellent. Estimated time was 45-60 minutes and it arrived right at the 45 minute mark...and it was hot!
I've never been disappointed with food here whether it's dine-in, take-out or grabbing something from their stand at the various Madison summer festivals. My go-to items are always pad Thai and panang curry. The veggie egg rolls are, in my opinion, the best in Madison...unlike any others that I've tried. We've always had very friendly and quick service."}
{"text":"I am in undeniable love with their food! Eating at other thai restaurants in the city only makes this emotion stronger!.I think the key to the amazing experience I have always had( and I have been here many many times) is that their focus is only on one thing, the FOOD!

A simple and unassuming restaurant, the decor does not do much nor do their serving bowls. I have always had my curry served in a big plastic white bowl, with no frills or decorative food garnish. One bite into the curry though, my tongue experience excitement, happiness, contentment and wholesomeness all in one go. Being partial to spicy food, I always get their Green Curry with tofu, which is inherently spicy, at a scale of 4 on their spice rating. I once got a 5 and boy it was spicy!. The basil and thai eggplant which go into the curry are cooked to perfection. Just thinking about the green goodness makes me want to go back for more. I have also had the Panang with tofu which is as good as a Panang can get. Creamy owing to the peanuts added to it, the curry comes with perfectly cooked carrots, broccoli and bamboo shoots. Each bite wants you to keep going on without a pause. My husband has had the Masamun and is all praise for it.

While the fact that I do not consume seafood never enabled me to try any of their soups, I am willing to bet they would be equally delightful. We have also tried their fresh spring rolls and potato pockets from their appetizers selection and have found them to be excellent accompaniments to the meal. Their meals always feel fresh and portions generous! Truly generous. I have often eaten without restraint and still have had leftovers to go. Unlike other places, where the rice accompanying the curry is in much smaller quantities, Bahn Thai is generous with their rice too!. My husband and I have celebrated several important occasions here, choosing Bahn Thai over a fancier looking restaurant for one simple reason--The Food!. Their food, in the simple plain white bowl adds to any celebration magnificently!. What are celebrations about anyway? The joy of the occasion, the presence of loved ones and really good food! And thats exactly what you get! Without nothing to distract you from the food, I think Bahn Thai scores by keeping the decor simple and understated.

I would certainly go back to Bahn Thai as long as I am in Madison."}
{"text":"This is the only restaurant where I am convinced that they make their curries from scratch. It is also the only one that can make it as spicy as I like. I dream about their green curry and have to come back periodically for a fix. The other aspect that they avoid is the syrupy sweetness that most Thai restaurants in Madison offer. If you can get over the tacky decor (the one star deduction) then this is the place to go. If they could update the interior and fix the lighting they would see me even more often."}
{"text":"Friday 7 pm, and 45 minute wait at every place within blocks...except here. So we went in. Only one other couple. We soon found out why: Staff was yelling at customers, screaming at each other, loudly fighting with mean insults. Ordered food mild, came absurdly spicy. This was not a good place to be at any time. Ugh."}
{"text":"This place is good enough to go back to.  I really enjoyed my dish, although my friends had mixed opinions about theirs.  Good service and mostly good food.  Bahn Thai is worth your time."}
{"text":"Great food! My friends and I love coming here! Absolutely love how spicey they can make the dishes!  Mouth watering....."}
{"text":"Went here on a recommendation from someone who clearly has never had the kind of Thai food that's so good you may lay down in the road for it.  The food was mediocre, the waiter looked like he was angry and wanted us to die.  The only thing worth mentioning were the potato pockets.  Those were pretty good, but not enough to consider going back."}
{"text":"I'm surprised iat the low ratings,  I had a very nice lunch here and if it was closer to U-W  would have returned more often. I went here on a holiday when everything else was closed but it turned out to be no problem at all. The Thai dishes tasted great and had great desserts."}
{"text":"Would give this place 3.5 stars but had to round. Small, hole in the wall restaurant that feels very authentic. Friendly hosts potentially family owned. Came here for dinner and felt that food was decent. It was standard Thai fare but did not stand out to me. One of the house specialties with mushrooms, baby corn, onions, and beef over rice and Pad see ew were pretty good. Decent place to come get dinner if you're a local.

Came here with a large group and service took awhile though, so expect to wait if you're in a larger group. We probably waited for about over half an hour before our food came out and it didn't all come out at the same time (several people were well over halfway through by the time some people got their dishes). However, they were very accommodating with getting sauces for the others at my table."}
{"text":"I'm giving Bahn Thai 5 stars because I have tried almost everything on their lunch menu and it's all fantastic. I've gone for lunch 20+ times in the past year and always leave happy.

My personal favorites:
Pad Thai- 'Ole trusty. If you are new to thai food, this is a good place to start.

Pad Si Ei- The best thick flat rice noodles in Madison! They have a great chewy texture and are not doughy at all (unlike the noodles at Ha Long Bay). It's only on the dinner menu, but  will make it at lunch time if you ask. The rich flavor is incredible. My favorite thing on the menu!

Pra Ram Long Song- If you like peanut sauce and veggies, you will love this.

Wonton Soup- The pork wontons are very flavorful in a great broth. Make it a meal by adding noodles.

Service can be slow, but the staff is very friendly and they keep your beverage full!"}
{"text":"the food here was okay, the Pad Thai looked good but I didn't have any of it. I had one of their house specials which was not very memorable. Will probably not come back here unless I'm really craving some Thai food in Madison."}
{"text":"Ordered my food at 5:05, the est delivery time said 35-55 mins. Get a confirmation saying estimated delivery time is 6:05. 6:25 rolls around, I call them to try and get a status on my order. I'm told it's gonna be 10 more minutes, they're still making my food, and they hang up. No sorry, no action to make up for the long wait. 7:05 rolls around...half an hour after they said it would be ready when I called, 2 hours after the initial order...my order arrives. Again, no offer to make things right, no sorry. The food is not piping hot and middle of the road, to be honest. All the pan fried noodles seem to have been fried on top of one another, stuck together. But hey, at least the Thai iced tea tasted good?

Bottom line, no matter how good your food is, if your service is terrible, you are a bad restaurant and need to improve - I truly hope you do. Made it really easy to choose a different place in the future. 1 star for the iced tea."}
{"text":"Excellent Thai food! Maybe the best in Madison. I had the Panang: red curry with peanut sauce, broccoli, carrots and onions. I'm a wimp when it comes to heat, so I requested 1 star (you can request up to 4+ stars). And it came out perfect, just a wee bit of heat. My wife requested 0 stars and here's came out perfect too. Just because we requested low heat did not diminish the flavor. The flavor was outstanding! I highly recommend this longtime Madison staple on Willy Street. (Sorry no photos. Forgot.)"}
{"text":"Living in the vicinity of Bahn Thai, I've learned that they work best for take-out.  I enjoy their food.  My favorites are Yum Tao Hoo (mung bean noodles, peanuts, tofu) for an app and panang for the entree.   Below average service tends to detract from the dining experience, which is why it's best to stick to take-out."}
{"text":"I enjoy coming to Bahn Thai, whether it's eating in or for take-out. The food is yummy and I appreciate their spice options. Here, if you want hot, they'll give you hot!! I like their pad thai and their vegetable curry. Service is usually friendly. My biggest complaint, is that the service can be painfully slow (yes, even when it's empty). If you're calling in for take-out, call at least 30 minutes in advance."}
{"text":"First time to the restaurant and the food was good. The fresh spring rolls and peanut sauce were great, and the Tom Ka soup with chicken as well. The young waitress was friendly."}
{"text":"The duck curry is wonderful, with a thick, bright sauce that will make all your taste buds happy. The spring rolls with house sauce are also good. The pad thai is better than Sai-Bai Thong, Ha Long Bay, and obviously Vientiane Palace's which mostly tastes like ketchup. The pad thai is not as good as Thai Noodles though, but that place is in Fitchburg."}
{"text":"My fiance and I took our parents here on the last night my own parents were to be in town.  My mom loves Thai food and finding good Thai food can be difficult.  We started off with Tom Ka Gai (a coconut/lemongrass soup) and  Yum Tao Hoo (a noodle salad).  Both were amazing. The soup had the right blend of spices in  hearty soup and the salad had awesomely done cooked zucchini, tofu, and a blend of other veggies. The spice level was just right. Onto the entrees.  A classic, Pad Thai, if not cooked properly, can be mushy or a bit stuff - either way not very palatable.  The Pad Thai here was amazing.  There has only been one other place I've eaten at that serve wonderful Pad Thai and that was a place in Las Vegas. The noodles, the sauce, the portion size - all perfect.  Also a dish I find Thai restaurants have difficulty getting done properly is the Pad See Ew. The Pad See Ew was delicious - noodles perfectly done, right amount of sauce, generous portion of crispy yummy broccoli.  We also ordered a roasted duck in curry.  I LOVE roasted duck; however, the roasted duck in curry I didn't care too much for.  My dad and future father-in-law seemed to enjoy it though. The pineapple dish with chicken and red peppers was also delicious - I didnt eat too much of this because of being full.  My fiance ordered the Pad Prik Tao Hoo, which was yummy, but because he ordered a medium spice level, he couldn't finish it.  Lastly, one cannot go to a Thai restaurant without getting dessert. Mango with sweet rice. The rice was not what i was expecting - sticking glutinous white rice.  Their rice was black rice, but it was a very pleasant surprise. The rice was just the right amount of sweet. I'm not sure what rice it was, but it had a nice crunch to it, but not in an uncooked or undercooked way.  It reminds me of Basmati rice in a way (the only two rice I've eaten are Basmati and Jasmine so forgive me if you've eaten this dessert here and think, \"this reviewer does not know what s/he's talking about!\" The mango, though, was a bit sour.

The atmosphere in the restaurant was pleasant. Casual, which we appreciated.  While we don't mind dressing up every now and then, we enjoyed that the lights and noise level were decent.  It wasn't pretentious."}
{"text":"I went back to Bahn Thai for my last meal before I moved back to Chicago. This time around we tried the vegan curry # 45 (pad prik tao hoo) and it was just really awesome. # 44 (pad poy sien, vegan, no egg) was great: a little greasy, but still tasted light an was filled with bok choy and other fresh vegetables.

The girl went over each of the items on the menu and cautioned us if something could not be made vegan. This food is authentic, the staff is knowledgeable (albeit a little slow). This place is a gem."}
{"text":"Went for lunch. Had the Shrimp Tom Yum Soup and a Pork Egg Roll. 

Great: The Pork Egg Roll is by far the BEST eggroll I've had in Madison and top 3 Ive ever had. Why has no one mentioned this delicious piece of fried heaven? Ive been searching for a good and savory homemade Eggroll reminiscent of small town cantonese restaurants and this is as close as you can come in Madison.  The staff is friendly. 
 
Mediocre: The Tom Yum was good (large shrimp & good quality), however, the broth was a not as complex & flavorful as others Ive had in town.  Also, the restaurant needed a good wipe down. Especially the restroom. 

Verdict: Will be back to stuff my face with egg rolls & try something beyond the bland soup."}

{"text":"I do vegan Friday night outing with my beau.
Thai food is pretty much perfect for semi cold weather night. So why not, we headed to Bahn.
So here are out vegan selections of the evening: cabbage salad for app, squash curry and 35-a with tofu for entree. The food was good, average good, but nothing more than that. 
For squash curry, I'd prefer the taste of LaoLao. And for the sauté in delicious garlicky sauce, I wish the veggies were cut evenly. My anal personality is not a huge fan of the gigantic unsliced mushroom. 
Another way I rate Asian food is how it tastes the day after - I like eating the left over out of the fridge, cold. Bahn left over dido not perform well in this category. So three garlicky stars."}
{"text":"great place. I work near this restaurant and swing by once every couple weeks. Great specials"}
{"text":"Really friendly staff, lots of great options and very family-friendly. Might need to be a little patient with service time but the food and hospitality totally make up for it. The food was really flavorful with the right amount of heat that you can customize. Love seeing family-run restaurants doing so well!"}
{"text":"I'll keep this relatively short and sweet; Bahn Thai is kind of an inexplicable Madison favorite for me when it comes to Thai. Dare I say, I like the food here considerably better than Ha Long Bay (I find their curry too watery and grainy). The Massaman curry is absolutely addictive. The Pad See Ew is also solid. For appetizers, I like the spring rolls and potato pockets. I will say, the service can sometimes be lacking but I think this is more of an issue of being under-staffed than it is general negligence. 

At the end of the day, I find Bahn Thai pretty under appreciated. You don't have to wait long for the food and it isn't ever really super crowded (quite the opposite actually). For thai curry, I think it's definitely the best on Willy street. If you don't like curry, then you may not think this is a five-star, but if you do and claim Ha Long Bay has the best, you HAVE to give this a chance."}
{"text":"Get the egg rolls. I don't even really like egg rolls, but these are phenomenal. My friend had this to say, \"These egg rolls will haunt you, in a good way\""}
{"text":"small restaurant. The service was bad an slow. the server totally forgot about my hot tea."}
{"text":"Fantastic curry dishes. The red curry with pineapple and coconut milk is the best. The portions fill you up, and you still want more. 

The owner is also very sweet. The atmosphere in the dining area is quaint. Well decorated with Thai culture and very comfortable. 

I eat here regularly. And will continue to do so. I almost always get carry-out because I'm eating on the job, and that's made even easier by using the EatStreet app. Also- try the spring rolls with peanut sauce."}
{"text":"My wife and I visited this place twice and on both occasions our dishes were perfect.  The food tasted consistent and original.  However, both times it took a VERY long time to get our food even with just 1 other person in the restaurant.  The pho tasted wonderful and soothing.  The stir fry we had with eggplant was excellent!  Just the right enough of kick to make you sweat a bit without making you gag for water.  The laab was beautifully done and came with crispy cucumber slices.  

The bottom line is that food was magnificent but the service leaves you wanting more.  If you don't mind subpar service but exceptional food then this is a place you should definitely try."}
{"text":"First time we've been here in about 10 years.  
We had the shrimp & pork stuffed chicken wing for our appetizer.  Meh.  Wouldn't order again.
The entree's, on the other hand were both excellent!
37B. Pla Sam Rod - Deep fried Catfish filet topped with bell peppers, garlic, ginger, onions, and mushrooms in a spicy garlic chili sauce.  HUGE catfish fillet, and very, very good.
39. Pla Duke Pad Pet - Deep fried catfish stir fried in red curry paste with jalapeno peppers, green onions, bamboo shoots, Thai eggplants, mushrooms, basil and citrus leaves.  Fabulous!  Nice, creeping spice, lips burning, nose running, and eyes watering by the end.  SO GOOD!
We ordered 3 stars (super hot) on both dishes.  The 37B was not spicy though.  It was sweet.  So, a bite of my spicy red curry, then a bite of the hubby's sweet Pla Sam Rod, was perfect!
Thai Iced Tea was perfect.
We will be back!!"}
