{"text":"this place is misleading in what type of facility is. when you pull up there are 2 listings on the sign: mendy's place and children's emergency center. oh! they offer 2 types of care options....mendy's place for normal issues and children's emergency for....emergencies!! the listings point to same place so, ok, they must be housed in same area.    WRONG!!!! but....you don't know this until after your child is seen and they tell you the copay for an ER visit. they quote emtala as the reason for not telling you cost of services/co pay upon entry, even tho its clear your child is NOT suffering from an emergency situation. oh! and the receipt and paperwork you receive also does not reference an emergency facility....but it is. has been for 10 years, but if one's not been here before, how would one know?  the signs are misleading, they hide behind emtala so they can see you and thus process larger claim.   if you're looking for an urgent type facility, this is NOT it."}
{"text":"I took my youngest son here at 6AM a few days ago. He had been running a fever all night and would not stop crying. We got there and the tech at the front desk was checking in another child, but still took his time to look at me and ask me to fill in the sign-in sheet. He didn't take longer than 5 minutes on the other patient, took them back to a room and then came back out and it was our turn. He was very calm and tried to make my son laugh, even though he wasn't having any of it, but was very professional at the same time. He ran through his part of checking my son in. This hospital even provided diapers and wipes for the kids. I have never had a hospital do that for my son's.  He took us back to our room and immediately a nurse came in. I wish I could have remembered all of these wonderful people's names, but it was so early in the morning and not having slept that night, my brain was not really working.  All the nurses that came in to do what they needed to do in order to figure out what was wrong with my baby, were so kind, funny, caring, and gentle with him. The only time he cried was when they put a catheter in him, but i am sure it was because it was painful & not because of the nurses.  I recommend anyone with children take them here. I was extremely satisfied with everything they did, said, and offered."}
{"text":"have had great experiences here!  the only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because they didn't stop at front doing vitals on another patient with bump on her head to realize my child needed more immediate attention.  but great staff in my experience and welcoming and thorough"}
{"text":"I have had the unfortunate pleasure of dealing with this hospital many times for all 3 of my girls. EVERY TIME they are wonderful, caring, knowledgeable and comforting. I do not trust anybody else and even at 2 in the morning I will make the 30 mile drive all the way from Waddell just to have my children seen here. I cam not stress enough what a great place this is. Many thanks to all the employees that work so hard to give us the care that you do!!!!"}
{"text":"Had a great quick in and out visit here for my son. Everyone was super helpful and friend. The doctor even have us some extra helpful parenting tips. And he and my other son got a Popsicle as a finishing treat. Great ER experience if you have to visit."}
{"text":"This is an ER exclusively for children, which is wonderful that they can have staff that are geared towards treating just children.  My daughter got a deep cut in her lip and obviously would need sutures. They got us in, we didn't have to wait too long, even though the place was slammed, lots of kids were sick or had been hurt that night, and the staff was juggling everybody's needs pretty well considering.   They were gentle and compassionate and despite having a lot of emergencies, took the time to do a good job with the work. This isn't the first time we've used this ER for kids, and we're grateful they are around to help us out with the little ones!"}
{"text":"I had to take my son to Mendy's Place last week due to a gash he had above his eyes. We got checked in and were immediately seen by the nurse. We got in our room, they took his vitals, gave him stickers and turned on his favorite movie, Cars. They truly made him feel special and comfortable. The Dr came in and said he would need stitches so they numbed him up and within 20 minutes he was getting his stitches. The Dr even brought in an assistant to hold my son down while getting his stitches so that my husband or myself didn't have to be the bad guy. After the stitches were done and he was all cleaned up, he got to pick out  prize from the treasure chest. The nurses and Dr were wonderful. We had a great experience at Mendy's Place. We will definitely be back if we have another emergency!"}
{"text":"I can't believe !!!! I had a most delightful treatment by Dr. Chase and Nurse Teresa and Doug. My son was treated so good by these team of experts. Even with a little wait and 2 hours later my son is breathing better and blessed by Mendys place....THANK YOU"}
{"text":"I am so disappointed in Mendys place. We came here to stay in the Honor Health network instead of taking our child to PCH. Only after my child had seen the doctor and gotten an X-ray did they notify me that the doctors he had seen were most likely out of network, and even though my insurance was accepted by the hospital, it may not be by the doctors. What!!? How crazy that they don't notify you ahead of time so you can ASk! Now I will be subject to insane bills because the doctors don't take my insurance- even though the hospital does. This is unprofessional and takes advantage of families because it's not giving us an informed choice - and saddling us with bills that could be avoided if we knew which doctors accepted our insurance and which doctors do not. Shame on Honor Health for not being more transparent. Also- the rooms seem old and and under construction, curtains missing, lights out, no chair for parents to sit, etc."}
{"text":"Every employee here was fantastic. We were treated quickly, efficiently and they treated us wonderfully. I am an ER nurse at a different hospital and I was very pleased with everything. Kudos! Thanks for fixing my babies when they were sick."}
{"text":"In our family has spent time in many local hospitals. I've been to many here in the valley; Children's Hospital Phoenix Baptist, John C Lincoln North Mountain, Good Samaritan, and banner Thunderbird. I can unequivocally  say they give the best treatment at this pediatric  emergency room! I've been here 3 times and I don't think I'll ever take my child anywhere else."}
{"text":"Hate this place they are slow they are rude. If you question ANYTHING they say they instantly treat you badly. It's dirty there are no sinks in the rooms. The triage is in front of everyone no privacy. It's extremely small in the waiting room. They don't have masks readily available you have to ask. This is the worse place I have ever been should have went to Banner Thunderbird!"}
{"text":"On june 25th i walked in with my 9 month old daughter who had been having fevers of 104-105.9Â°F. At time fever had spiked she had 72 hours worth of antibiotics for an ear infevtion of right ear as well as had been receiving Tylenol and ibuprofen of a 3 hours alternative looping. And yet her fever kept spiking. She also had some bloody diarrhea and had only had 2 wet diapers in a 24hour period. Dr Cooper walked in saying she can't do anything. No tests. Nothing. Bacause antibiotics in system for 3 days woud mask any test supposedly... Wouldn't bother urine to even see if she was dehydrated at all because she simply \"looked fine\". Any time we asked a question and tried to press for some testing for ease of mind she threw in your face one of two lines \"I've been a dr for 15 years\" or \"you haven't watched a kid go septic from strep like I did\". Which to me was irrelevant cause what specifically did that have to do with my daughter who at time was present. I was also informed that 106 is not at all a concerned temp. 108 was and she pretty much bluntly told me I wasted her time coming in. I even asked her if was possible my daughter could be resisting her antibiotic and she told me know and that I was crazy pretty much to even think so. She was rude and had little no bed side manner. We simply left with tylenol. Fast forward to following day got into primary. Turns out my daughter HAD in fact become resistant to antibiotics and her ear infection had gotten worse. Had actually developed an ear infection in her other ear as well! AND she was in fact dehydrated. Also my Dr said no antibiotics in system wouldn't have fully masked tests that early on in her system it still could of showed something. If it was 5 days or more then yes tests would be false possibly. So my daughter was discarded and kicked out all because she wasnt septic and didn't look like she was dying in front of them. Horrible woman. Horrible experience. NEVER going back."}
{"text":"Took my 2 week old child here for a fever, worse thing I could have done. A middle aged Asian male doctor can into the exam room asked a few questions NEVER touched or examined my child at all just told me she needed to be admitted and have a spinal tap!  I had no idea why because her temp wasn't even at the temp her pediatrician told me to take her in at. I was being preventive because it was almost 11 pm and I didn't want to fall asleep and have her fever spike and not know. Anyhow, any questions I asked were blown off and answered with\"because that's what we need to do\" no explanation at all. I was terrified and asked if I could go get her father I was told no. I left the hospital took her straight to Phoenix Children's Hospital where they explained every detail with a understanding attitude. I spent 3 days at Phoenix children's and left very happy with my experience and the staff. The Mendys place doctor called the police and cps over the ordeal but dealing with them was worth not having to deal with a egocentric doctor with a horrible bedside manor. I filed a complaint with the medical director to be blown off and told the doctors actions were procedure. The actions and tests were not the problem, the lack of information, education and compassion were. Save yourself the trouble,  go to Phoenix Children's."}
{"text":"Always get excellent, fast and friendly care here for my children. Wouldn't take them anywhere else!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately I've had to bring my boy here on several occasions including today and I just want to say they are so wonderful with my son, and with making me feel at ease. I love this place and just want to say thank you for taking such good care of us!"}
{"text":"If it's just an ear infection don't go here. You will wait for ever even though no one else is there and then you will be be billed $500 from the hospital and $700 from the doctor for a 2 minute exam and prescription for an ear infection go to an actual urgent care and spend $50 for the same amount of attention ."}
{"text":"Dr. Baron and his nurses were wonderful when my son needed to have a wound glued on his forehead.  He was very meticulous and kind."}
