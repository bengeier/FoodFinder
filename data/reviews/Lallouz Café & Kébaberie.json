{"text":"This was my fave mean in Montreal. They started with a mint lemonade and a platter of pita with 5 dips. Dips were a fried eggplant, garlic hummus, beets, cucumbers and onions and feta in oil and a shredded carrot and rasin coslaw. The lunch was a choice between 2 kabobs of varying types, a schnitzel sandwich and a few others for 13.50-14.50 including the dips and drinks. It was 2.50/person for more lemonade and the baclava was under 4.00 though they were out. The returant boasts all things are made from scratch in house down to the mayo. Everything was fresh and delish. The kabob choices fyi included chicken, a Persian beef, jerk chicken, fried feta, some sort of spicy sausage, falafel and more."}
{"text":"Wasn't expecting much strolling st. Catherine's Friday night but my girlfriend and I decided to stop at this place, and WOW. Our waiter was fast and enthusiastic, and, especially for the prices, the food was wonderful. They first serve a plate of different toppings, including some of the best hummus I've had outside of the middle east, and generous amounts of pita bread.

I would recommend the brochettes d'agneau (lamb skewers). The meat was cooked to perfection, unlike many other places that habitually overcook and dry out otherwise good lamb. But the jerk chicken skewers are good as well! They come with a perfectly acidic (and perfectly spicy) delicious sauce.

The vibe is fresh and modern. Absolutely the perfect atmosphere to bring a date or hang out with friends--and as always, accompanied with delicious food. Definitely worth a trip down into the village to check out this place. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Came here for a couch surfing event. There was no menu for couch surfers and the owners made us a steak wrap, with homemade fries, and a salad. Amazing food. Go if you have the chance."}
{"text":"Simple menu because everything is freshly prepared, really excellent grilled meats, delicious vegetable dips. The mint tea was excellent. The owner bought everyone a round of digestifs. Service was superb. Recommend."}
{"text":"This place is a treasure. I was walking around late at night looking for a place to eat after a long day of exploring the city. I was hungry!!! However, I can be a bit of a pain in the ass because I am both a vegetarian and have some food allergies. After looking at the menu, I thought I had struck out again, but then the owner ( I think she said her name was Amnita) came over and said don't worry about the menu. She asked me what my allergies were and then proceeded to make the best sandwich of my entire life. The zucchini was perfectly cooked, all of the vegetables were fresh and lovely, especially the beets which were shredded into confetti sized pieces and added the most wondrous crunch. The start of the show was the pomegranate glaze which sang with the fresh mint she put in the sandwich. All of it was wrapped up in a warm fluffy pita. The owner then proceeded to make up a price she thought fair in her head ( she only charged me $10), so kind! The kindness made the food taste all the more better. They have a true passion for what they do. Everyone should eat here, and I will be back if I ever make it to Montreal!!!"}
{"text":"Went there for dinner when visiting the village, and i had the Signature \"dinner kit\" kebabs, which was 1 lamb and 1 steak kebab, along with saffron rice. my friend had the Classic which was lamb, steak & sausage kebabs. The meat peices were interspersed with grilled veggies (carrot, squash, zucchini). very delicious. had a ginger Mojito, which was good, and a glass of house Chardonnay which tasted sour. The waitresses & waiters were very nice, friendly & professional. we sat at an outside table, it was perfect weather. our meal was a little pricy...but good."}
{"text":"We were looking for a late lunch and a warm spot from which we could watch the snow fall. We got yummy food from Morocco and the Middle East. 

Mint lemonade and hummus and salads come with the menu. I also ordered mint tea. No black or green tea (or caffeine), but I was not disappointed. This is not from a tea bag! 

I had merguez and lamb kebab and my husband had the jerk chicken and Persian beef. We liked the lamb best."}
{"text":"Plusieurs mois que j'avais envie de tester cet établissement et j'y ai finalement mis les pieds à l'occasion de la poutine week! Grosse déception sur le service: ABSENT! Nous étions 3, 2 tables déjà occupées et 1 serveur (faites le calcul). Le serveur nous apporte nos boissons et les traditionnels accompagnements mais pas de serviettes ni couverts, nous avons attendu de recevoir nos plats pour les avoir. Lors de la commande je demande s'il a de la coriandre dans le plat, il me répond \"juste pour décorer par dessus\" je lui demande poliment et très clairement que je n'en veux pas en insistant bien car je déteste ça sans pour autant y être allergique. Le serveur revient avec mon plat surmonté de coriandre hachée... Sérieusement???
Outre le fait que la poutine en question n'en était pas vraiment une (cheddar râpé à la place du fromage en grains et merguez non coupées alors qu'en principe une poutine est censée se manger juste avec une fourchette) le goût y était (une fois la coriandre enlevée). Une mauvaise expérience isolée je l'espère."}
{"text":"Suis venue ici avec un groupe de retrouvaille, de vieux copains qui ne s'étaient pas vus depuis un bon bout de temps... 

En cette soirée chaude et humide d'août, nous avons opté pour l'intérieur, climatisé. C'est bien décoré, moderne avec des peintures accrochées aux murs. 

Le concept est simple: bouffe de style méditerrannéenne, dont la spécialité: les kebabs. 
En entrée, des mezzes de légumes servis avec pains pitas chauds, très bon. J'ai essayé les grillades classiques: trois choix de brochettes servies avec salade et frites au zaatar. 
Les portions sont très raisonnables. Mes brochettes étaient bien savoureuses, mais l'agneau était sec.  Nous avons partagé un vin rouge maison qui était bien. J'ai terminé par un thé à la menthe pour digérer. Je n'ai pas essayé le baklava, mais il avait l'air bon et assez généreux pour partager à deux. 

La terrasse donne sur la rue Sainte--Catherine, il y avait beaucoup de passants, mais quand même agréable pour prendre un verre et une bouchée entre amis. Les deux serveuses étaient très gentilles et le service était bon.

J'ai passé, somme toute, une excellente soirée!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing and the owners are extremely hospitable. My girlfriend and I walked in right around the time the kitchen closed and one of the owners said \"well how hungry are you?\" We said \"very hungry!\" She said \"well sit down and I'll make you a meal.\" 

We didn't look at the menu, we just trusted her recommendation and ordered drinks. The food was to die for. Best salad dressing I've ever had and the chicken schnitzel was so tasty I wanted more! We ended up being the last folks in the bar and was entertained by the company of the husband/wife owners and their great personalities. It was like these two actually care about their customers and the reputation of their brand! Amazing! Other owners need to model themselves after this restaurant.

Their food is a bit on the pricy side, however it's 5 star food at 3 star prices; so still less than similar quality would recommend; and the drink prices were fair. Worth every penny, in a great neighborhood, and the owners are awesome to hangout with. This place is a Montreal must!"}
