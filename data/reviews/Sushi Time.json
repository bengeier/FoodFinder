{"text":"Amazing sushi at a good price. They have affordable lunch specials and a small, quiet environment. The service is slow, but the quality of food makes up for it. Will definitely dine here on a regular basis."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I discovered this little hidden gem about a year ago. Since then we stopped going to RAW (which was our favorite sushi place). The prices are pretty reasonable, and their daily happy hour deals are great! That's usually what my boyfriend goes for, since it's very filling, you get a good variety of 3 items, and the price is very low. (where else can you get a rice and chicken bowl, cali rolls, and miso soup for $8!?) I prefer going more for the sushi variety, so I'm willing to pay just a little more to get some good sushi. 
They have definitely changed quite a bit! It used to be a place where you walked up to the register and picked from a menu on the wall. That is also where you picked up your food. They they decided to up the atmosphere a little more by tearing out the register, putting in a sushi bar, decor such as a flat HD tv that features an aquarium, replacing the wall menu for real restaurant menus, and hiring a couple servers. This place has definitely become more classy, while retaining their charm. 

When in Tempe, go to Sushi Time!"}
{"text":"I LOVE sushi, and am a raw fish enthusiast. The fish itself here is decent -- better than average for the area, but the service is super super slow and variable in quality. I'd guess my average wait time when I've come in the past is about 45 minutes for take out, even when I've called in advance and am told to come in 15; range is 15-70 minutes. I live really close, but prefer not to come here when I can help it, even if I have a craving for sushi."}
{"text":"If you're the kind of person who likes overpaying to get food poisoned, you should book it to this place FAST.  

I tried to order the crunchy rice with tuna- which is simply a bowl of deep-fried rice with tuna sashimi over it.  I asked if I could substitute the deep fried 'crunchy rice' with plain white rice.  The waiter had to consult with the owner about this and eventually returned to tell me that ALL of their plain white rice came 'pre-shaped' into little squares, so I would have to have that instead of a regular bowl of rice.  I said that was fine.  

After about 45 minutes, he returned with a plate of 4 rice squares topped with small pieces of tuna.  I was skeptical about whether that was a portion equivalent to what I would get had I ordered the regular bowl, but whatever.  By the way, I noticed that the full sushi bar was not being used at all by the sushi chef, he was prepping and bringing out all of the sushi from the back, which was a little suspect.
  
After paying 18 dollars for the above and a small Kirin, I headed home to a full blown stomach flu within 12 hours.  I came here with a friend and she actually ordered the SAME exact thing I did, presented in the SAME way and she got sick as well...it was the only thing we had eaten in common that day.  

As a sidenote, the waiter was totally rude and continually gave me looks like I was on an episode of Portlandia playing the 'overly-concerned-about-food-preparations' health hipster, when ALL I wanted was plain white rice.  

Ugh."}
{"text":"Great place to grab some cheap sushi on the quick for takeout or eat-in.  They have some good combo deals during the week with prices that can't be beat.  I have eaten here for years and they are always consistently good and you will not be disappointed.  I give it 5 stars even though it is a hole in the wall because it always tastes great.

I highly recommend you try out their Las Vegas roll if you are a fan of them - I haven't found any other sushi place that has a better one.  They include it in a Friday special along with a spicy tuna roll and miso soup.   I really like their Alaskan Roll which has salmon covering a spicy tuna roll - delicious and not too spicy.  Very good seaweed salad and unagi sauce."}
{"text":"My sister and I came to Sushi Time for the happy hour specials (Buy 1 large sake or beer, Get 1 small sake free, $1 off most sushi rolls) on a Thursday night. We ended up splitting a Spicy Tuna roll, Viva Las Vegas Eel roll, and Teryaki Chicken entree. While we both really liked the sushi rolls, I found the Teryaki Chicken to be on the tough / overcooked side. This was a small place, with a small simple menu. Although some sushi restaurants have an overwhelming amount of roll options, I felt like Sushi Time could've used more. The rolls just weren't all that enticing or creative. I'd recommend them for good, basic sushi in Tempe but wouldn't go out of my way to come here."}
{"text":"I have tried all the Nigiri sushi. The quality of the fish are decent and served at slightly lower than the room temperature. The fish are fresh and they are cut  after the order are received at the bar counter. Whether you are sushi roll eater or the nigiri eater you will be able to enjoy sushi here!"}
{"text":"Okay, here's what's good:
The service is great.
The interior is reminiscent of a family sushi spot in suburban Tokyo. 
The portions were large!
The fish was very fresh.

Here's what's not so great:
The rice was seriously undercooked and underseasoned. 
The wasabi was mostly horseradish, not even the powdered wasabi.
The spicy albacore roll had fish in it that smelled like it was right on the edge of old.

Overall, it's cheap, fast, friendly, and the sashimi is good.  It's worth a shot, I may have just caught the rice on a bad day..."}
{"text":"I got food poisoning from this restaurant and so did my friend. The day we went, it seemed as if their air conditioner wasn't working either. Please don't go here. The sushi tastes great, until you run to the bathroom !"}
{"text":"Sushi time is a great little hole in the wall in a great area which offers awesome deals(beer with free sake at happy hour!!!). I had one of their specials and tried my boyfriend's udon with was amazing! It's very clean, the staff is welcoming and the prices are just right."}
{"text":"Just ordered from sushi time! It was really fast, got here in no time. The sushi is not the best sushi I ever had, but for the price it's a-ok."}
{"text":"The sushi here is amazing!! Small quaint restaurant with a good welcoming feel.... If in Tempe you must go here the staff is friendly and very efficient and the prices here are amazing!! Definitely will be returning here"}
{"text":"First of all we waited over 40 minutes for our sushi while other people sat after us and got their food, ate and left. We also order a second beer and never received it. Oh and the calamari is trash"}
{"text":"Save your dollars! This place has subpar food for the money you pay to eat here and overall was a highly unsatisfactory experience! My friend and I ate here for $18 a person, weren't even full afterwards and came home with sore throats and a fever. It took over 40 minutes for them to prepare our sushi and even before we ate the food I told her that there was a strange scent to the sushi. However, it looked decently fresh so I gave them the benefit of the doubt and didn't send it back. I figured that all sushi places were different and their vinegar rice probably just had it's own unique scent. I was wrong.

I felt severely ripped off, the waiter was rude, uneducated regarding the menu, and service was terrible. If you want to spend money on sushi, go somewhere that is clean and friendly where the prices actually reflect the value and service. This place was a solid thumbs down!"}
{"text":"Worth stopping by - fresh and tasty, reasonable, quaint and very personable. I asked for flying fish eggs with thin slices of lemon and I was rewarded with my request without an odd look or question. Deliciously fresh and (for me) this is a wonderful addition to anything I order. I loved the willingness to provide what I asked for. This wonderful gem of a place is a MUST try!"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place looking for sushi in Tempe 2 years ago. We've been regulars ever since. We visit at least once a week and have become great friends with the patrons.
Happy Hour is great, beer and sake for less than 4 bucks.
I always go for the chicken bowl, but of course the sushi's great. Give it a shot, most who do become regulars like us."}
{"text":"Very small and informal but the sushi is top notch. The service is equally casual but attentive. Liquor is pretty much beer or sake (which was good). Only disappointment was that yellowtail is only on Friday and Saturday. Otherwise a good selection of food in a casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"Woefully unremarkable, even for land-locked sushi bars. Will avoid going forward."}
{"text":"Originally chose to go here because it was close and open till 10pm. But omg, this place was great. When we walked in we were immediately welcomed. The chef/owner was so nice and easy to talk to when sitting at the bar. Plus the service was fast. And haven't even gotten to the food. I got the special, which was a good price for the meal. The extra handrolls, sushi and sashimi we got were delicious. The seared albacore melted in my mouth. And the spicy salmon roll had the perfect blend of seasonings. Definitely coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Un des meilleur sushi que j'ai mangé à Montréal. L'endroit est petit, mais c'est très rapide, abordable et vraiment très bon. Aussi il y a déjà des sushis préparés à l'avance pour ceux qui sont plus serrés dans le temps. Il y a aussi possibilité de personnifier ses sushi. 

Contrairement à d'autres restaurant asiatiques, à celui-ci les gens parlent bien français. C'est très agréable et il n'y a jamais d'attente."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood sushi restaurant, small, friendly, cool tunes, relaxed atmosphere.  Kids and I are sitting at the sushi bar now and talking to the sushi chef who is very friendly."}
{"text":"Fantastic recent sushi bar renovation and addition to an already amazing Tempe staple.  Clean and quaint with great food and impeccable service by the owner/sushi chef himself.  They are now even open a little later, until 10pm with an alcohol license and free saki with beer purchase.  Great daily  happy hour specials too.  Certainly a cool, local and healthy alternative to the run-of-the-mill corporate sub shop next  door.  Try it out!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised at the existing reviews. I am reviewing on yelp for the first time specifically because we thought this was the worst sushi place ever.  Yucky rice, tepid salmon in chunks when I ordered spicy salmon. the chicken katsu was horrible.   I will agree with others that the place is clean and service ok. maybe we just expect good Japanese food in a sushi place."}
{"text":"Came here based on reviews. Disappointed to say the least. Waited about an hour for our food. Once it came it wasn't very fresh. Great presentation but fish had a very funky taste and didn't settle well."}
{"text":"the 5 stars is subjective - this is the best sushi I've had within about a 6 hour drive.

the chef and staff are very, very friendly, and the establishment is very comfortable."}
{"text":"A generic bland sushi like so many in this continent. They are pretty cheap so no harm done if you just need to fill your hunger"}
{"text":"Wow! That's basically the gist of my review right there. 

This place is small and comfortable, casual and fun! The employees there seemed happy and very welcoming, and were quick to get us seated and served. They even had a cool TV with an aquarium playing on it - all the beauty of a real fish tank without the work. I like that!

I ordered the Dragon Roll and the Cucumber Roll, and my friend ordered the Crunch Roll and the Philadelphia Roll. 

First came out the Dragon and Crunch rolls. As we were eating, the other two came out. The Dragon roll was well made and absolutely delicious - the eel on top was warm and cooked perfectly. The cucumber roll was huge and perfect - very light and flavorful.

I didn't try the Crunch Roll, but I tried the Philadelphia roll. My friend and I weren't a huge fan of the Philadelphia roll mostly because of the amount of cream cheese.... but then again, it was a roll made only with salmon and cream cheese. It wasn't gross or anything though - it was absolutely delicious.

The rolls themselves were big and generous without being too overwhelming, and they tasted absolutely wonderful. I was super impressed.

Overall, I really enjoyed myself and know for sure I'll be coming back. It was awesome. It might be a little pricey for some, but it was great for an occasional sushi splurge.

Only one downside to the whole experience though - the music they played was sort of loud. Then again, we were seated fairly close to the speaker, so it's not a huge deal at all.

I'm really happy I found this place! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour.  Beer and free sake. How can you not like more booze for a drink you're going to get anyway? Can't say bad things about that.   Food was good too. Spent about $20 on my own here. But I'm the type to spend $90+ on my own at a high end joint over in foofoo land (LA/Hollywood).  I would come back.  Nice staff too."}
{"text":"I gave this one star because my Coke was decent. The meal was over priced and not fresh. The server left dirty dishes on our table. Will never return."}
{"text":"We love this place. Go there all the time. They are so sweet and welcome kids :)  a must try!!"}
{"text":"Great service and food. The surprise roll was to die for and the hot red dragon was pretty good as well. The tuna sashimi was tasty with the sauce they poured on top of it. Ask for extra spicy mayo sauce."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my 3 hand rolls and warm tea in a great atmosphere. I sat at the bar and had an imaginary conversation with the busy sushi chef."}
{"text":"Super legit and amazing to say the least. If you have eaten sushi in the area like I have this is one of the best! Hands down this is the place."}
{"text":"Sushi Time is as good as it gets! I live nearby and go at least once a week for happy hour.  Their happy hour specials are buy one get one rolls and buy a beer get a free hot saki!! for less than $40 two people can have 3-4 rolls and a couple of drinks each.  The food is excellent, the decor is simple, not much for atmosphere but you won't find better sushi in the area.  Score one for mom and pop!!"}
{"text":"Awkwardly silent when we walked in -music was turned down low and there were only 2 other customers when we arrived, but it soon picked up as more and more people came in. It's a pretty small place with probably 6 tables along the wall that sits about 4 people and about 10 more seats at the sushi bar. This particular night there was only one waitress and all tables and seats were filled up by the time we left (poor thing), but she did a good job and maintained good customer service. Sushi was delicious as well, had the Suprise Roll and really liked the avocado on top. Tip: $1 off selected sushi rolls from 5pm-8pm :)"}
{"text":"Gone to Sushi time several times and have never left that not feeling satisfied. The atmosphere is nice and cozy. The sushi is pretty damn good given it's economic price. Go to this place during happy hour and you can get hot sake!"}
{"text":"I frequent here weekly. The freshest sushi place I've had in the area, and I've tried most of them. The Phoenix and rainbow roll are my go to, and the workers are super friendly with a laid back vibe."}
{"text":"Was disappointed that they no longer offer salmon teriyaki. I settled with the  Chicken teriyaki that was horrible. Dry, no flavor.. Vegetables were soggy and left my rice tasting like mush. Very dissatisfied, won't be returning."}
{"text":"Daughter is out busy today, so we decided to get sushi for lunch. Started looking for good recommended family places (ie not chains) to try out. Happened upon this little gem, and just so happens to be really close by (bonus).  Husband ordered the special (CA roll, goya, & miso soup), and then we decided to split Alaska Roll, Rainbow Roll, & Spicy Salmon. Everything tasted fresh and very tasty! Snuck a taste of the miso soup, and it was very nice.

We both liked the that it was a great, small neighborhood sushi restaurant. Nice background music, and the owner was behind the sushi bar making the roles. He was very accommodating on my \"no mayo\" request. =) 

The one thing that I will note is that the hours showing on here are incorrect. Yelp says 12, but the door says 11:30. Also, this place is CLOSED on Sunday"}
{"text":"*Update: One Star.
About a month ago I saw a new (at least to me) sushi chef walk outside with his gloves on. I figured he was going to do something and then throw them away outside. He walked around the back of the building and was gone for about five minutes. He came back with the gloves ON! I have no idea what he did, but know that I'll never eat sushi made with questionable gloves . I've eaten there at least 20 times, but will never be back."}
{"text":"Found Sushi time on Yelp. Thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Great music, environment was quiet and casual, the sushi rolls though (Eel special &a Oh Baby) plus the squid salad was DELICIOUS! Such a great find! Diamond in the rough!!"}
{"text":"Decent sushi. However, they take for ever to deliver (over an hour in my case) so maybe take out is a better option. Also, make sure you double check your order with them on the phone because they're prone to mistakes."}
{"text":"First time customers, nice place,great food! Will return when I back in town."}
{"text":"I love this place. Get take out a couple times a month and dine in as well. The staff is so nice. Love the avocado roll and the noodle dishes are great too. Awesome happy hour and lunch special. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is outstanding! Wow it's amazing to me how many people in Arizona don't know how to judge good sushi, because this is the best place I've been to and I've been all around the world, so if you've never left Arizona and only eaten sushi once please do not leave a review for anywhere. please stay in your house please look in the mirror before you leave your house. So if you're attractive and you want to eat great sushi come here cause I'll be here."}
{"text":"Oh where to begin.  Maybe you all do it differently out here in Arizona but I dout it.  I like Arizona and the people here, so I'm guessing this place just sucks.    Walked into this place and was empty. Probably the 1st sign.  Ordered a crunch roll and miso soup...  miso soup was Luke warm so ehhh.  Crunch roll ($10)I asked if that's all that came on it as I have a specific diet and waitress said yes.  Well when I received it it had spicy mayo on which I can't really eat. Well me being the only person in the place and all three workers just staring at me  and said it was fine I'll muscle through it.  Eat 2 pieces and decided it was not worth the effort to eat. I asked the waitress if I could just order a side of teriyaki chicken and the answer was \"well you could order a chicken bowl\" ($9) after clearly seeing that I did not touch my roll.  Hoping for some redemption the chicken bowl came out and wasn't very good either. Chicken was dry and had  little flavor, was covered with onion.  Not a traditional bowl.  Definitely not ordering it again. Well not coming back when I'm coming to Arizona. So now it's time to total up a the bill. $19.89 for a crunch roll I didn't eat and teriyaki chicken bowl that I just ate the chicken. Clearly wasn't satisfied and no effort by the crew. Give the girl my card and she comes back and only charged me $1.98 instead of $19.89 which was probably all the meal was worth but me being an honest person pointed out the mistake to her.  So she quickly made the adjustment and paid, tipped and left.  I wish I could get that 45 minutes back of my life.  I guess I'll hit a drive-thru on the way home"}
{"text":"Nice little hole in the wall. Everything was great. Even chatted up the boss a bit. Very nice guy."}
{"text":"This is my go-to sushi place. They're sushi is fresh and delicious, staff is friendly, and atmosphere is great!! They have a very unique interior and their choice of music is always fantastic if you're a 70's to 80's fan like me. When you walk in, the whole staff greets you with a warm heart and keeps their great service until you walk out of the restaurant. Chef guarantees  great quality fish and food and has pride for his food which is why it might feel a little pricey but with happy hour deal it's even better! Now there's only one sushi chef on weekdays so bear in mind it may take some time before getting your food but you will be more than happy to taste their food when you get it!"}
{"text":"Sashimi was very good and fresh. I give this place four starts on the food only, if you don't like music(it's not loud just not censored) this place isn't for you. Food is excellent I'll definitely be coming back!! Favorite local spot for sure"}
{"text":"Sushi time is a nice little hole in the wall sushi joint. I've been there a few times with my boyfriend and the sushi was good but, despite the small size of the restaurant, service seems to be lacking a bit. Last time in we ordered sushi and something from the kitchen for his son. The two waiters stood in the back of the room talking to each other while we waited for our food. The sushi came but kitchen food was a no show. We waited a little while to see if food would come but after we had nearly finished the sushi his son sat there staring at us because his food had not yet come. Not once did one of the waiters put it together that he had forgotten to put the order in to the kitchen. I had to call to his attention to see where his food was. Oh.. It's coming he says. 15 minutes later his food finally comes. Kind of awkward because we were the only people in the place. Overall the food was good, and I like the place. There just needs to be a little more discipline in the wait staff to be more attentive to the patrons. Oh. And no yellowtail except on Fridays."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best.  The place looks and feels like a fast food place.  Thus, we were a bit hesitant to try raw fish.  I had the beef bowl for $6.50 and my friend had the Teriyaki  plate for $8.50. 

Mine was much smaller than expected.  I'm still hungry and I'm not a big eater. It tasted pretty good, no complaints there, but the meat was pretty tough even for this price range.

The other plate was more disappointing.  The picture on the menu showed a good size accompanying salad.  Instead, we literally got a few pieces of lettuce.  Certainly not worth the extra $2.

All in all not a terrible experience, but disappointing."}
{"text":"I hate giving bad reviews, so I'll be brief. The sushi was passable, the salad was drowned in dressing, the service was atrocious."}
{"text":"cheap sushi good quality.. mom and pop shop with great service"}
{"text":"Extremely non-tasty food. The rice was only 1/2 cooked, the beef was unchewable and the waitress was rude and in a rush even though there were only a few people in the restaurant. Would not recommend it. We also got a tiny portion of dried out wasabi and were actually asked if we wanted ginger. A negative experience all around."}
{"text":"I went there during my lunch break and I was able to walk in and receive my order in a very timely manner. They don't have an online menu that I could see. The crunch roll was very tasty though. I had some nigiri that was sliced a little thick but probably because they felt rushed. Online menu would make this place 5 stars."}
{"text":"Realy affordable and good sushi. Go during happy hour for a reduced rate on their sushi and drinks. We also tried their yackisoba and it was amazing.Will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Shame on you for charging 8.50 (9.00+ w/tax) for a cup of iceberg lettuce, some carrot slivers, and 5 pieces of salmon. And calling it a Sashimi salad.  Please research other sushi places on how to make a true Sashimi salad at that price point. I assure you, you will be embarrased( I would hope). This makes  me not want to go back to try the other dishes that have received good reviews.."}
{"text":"Great low key, authentic sushi hang out. Not a 'concept' sushi place. Think fish, beer, wood everywhere, retro music and chef's who cheer at you as you come in and head home."}
{"text":"I brought my family and extended family to this restaurant last night based on the good reviews others had left on Yelp and the close proximity to my house and was grossly disappointed... 

First off - We waited well over an hour for our food when there was maybe one other table in the restaurant on a Thursday night.  Granted we had a good size group that ordered cumulatively maybe 6-7 rolls, still disappointing.  The beer was room temp warm when served and sushi was mediocre at best when we finally did get it.  The chicken teryaki my son ordered dry and weird tasting and all of our fish was dried out and gross. 

The icing on the cake... While we were waiting for our food we saw a cockroach the size of a rat run across the dining room floor.  It took us three times of telling our waiter about the thing before they finally got a dust pan and removed it.  

All this to the tune of one obscene bill... No discount for cockroaches at the table, long wait times, warm beer or poor service.  

Now, the stomach ache that comes with this place later that night and the next morning is also worth noting... The food there will send your body into an uproar that will keep you from ever wanting to go back.  

I definitely wouldn't recommend this place to anyone or ever return back..."}
{"text":"The sushi is average. It's a very small restaurant with only 7 tables in all, along with a bar.
They have a very small menu and limited sushi options.
The specials are a good deal as far as price is concerned. The workers are very nice and friendly. 
Over all this is a very average experience, nothing awful but nothing wonderful."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of sushi and have been to many different sushi bars in the tempe area. I was so impressed by sushi time! First big plus - an immaculately clean and rarely crowded establishment. I am always surprised that there are never many people there when I go - maybe I just go at the wrong time, or people don't know about it, because the place rocks.  You order up at the front counter, and then they bring your tray to you when the food is ready - drinks are self serve also. 
Their sushi is really delicious and fresh! They make one of the best Las Vegas Rolls i've ever had - make sure to try it if you go. Also, every day they have 'combos' posted, where it's $10.99 for two types of rolls (the rolls in each combo are different every day) and miso soup. For the price, delicious sushi, and clean, modern atmosphere, I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"What a great hole in the wall mom and pop shop. I have a friend that lives close by and I happen to work up the street so we meet often for their happy hour. Their happy hour specials are some of the best in town (5pm-9pm Monday-Saturday) They offer fun combo specials and during happy hour its buy a sake, the beer is free or vice versa - at any rate, the prices are spot on. 

The entire staff is part of the neighborhood and they take the time to get to know your name (if you want that bonding to happen) Yes, it's a hole in the wall, but it's clean, comfortable and you can't beat the price."}
{"text":"What a surprise this place was...

The place is located around a corner of this shopping plaza ..making it INVISIBLE from the street really.. I only found it with my Iphone Yelp app..

Anyway... This place is great. I stopped in here for lunch and it was everything I could ask for in a small sushi place..
I have been back several times for lunch and never been disappointed. Quick and easy meals with a family style atmosphere.
The owners are very nice and friendly that are very attentive to your experience.

Worth looking for in Tempe if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"I went here last night because I was craving sushi and this was close.  I was very disappointed in the quality and taste.  After moving here from Florida I'm still searching for a good local sushi place."}
{"text":"The wine selection is good here. Nice and clean. I've tried almost everything on the menus. Excellent"}
{"text":"I've been stuffing my face at this place since it had counter service only. 

First off, it's small and family owned. Most of the time there is just the one guy making your sushi. Yeah, just one guy. At least I assume he is only one guy, because I see him behind the bar every time I come, day or night. He could be a series of clones, but I think he is just the hardest worker I've ever seen. 

Don't come here expecting a conveyor belt of sushi workers churning shit out for your fat ass. Think of this as the kind of place you might stumble upon in actual Japan, where the owner makes sushi for you one order at a time. 

They also use some kind of hulk version of sushi rice that is never mushy. Since rice is the most distinguishing part of sushi, because it's all pretty much the same otherwise, I enjoy it. Yes, I actually just spent time discussing some finer points of sushi rice. I'm not sure why men aren't falling over themselves to sleep with me. Is rice not a hot topic? Who doesn't love firm, yet supple rice?"}
{"text":"when I tell you this is the best sushi place around, I mean it. I have tried numerous sushi places from yelp and this is the best one by far. always fresh and you're always greeted at the door when you walk in. you can seat yourself and I have never had to wait. My favorite roll is the surprise roll and I get it every time. Sometimes depending on how crowded it is, you might have to wait for your sushi because there is only one person making it. but the guy who makes it is the best and it's totally worth the wait. If you've never been here, then I suggest you come try it. And if you are considering somewhere else besides sushi time, don't do it! come here!! love this place. my favorite sushi place ever."}
{"text":"Being such a small restaurant with only one sushi chef, I gave Sushi Time a chance. After waiting almost 35 minutes for our 5 pieces of tuna sashimi and 5 pieces of salmon sashimi, I couldn't take it anymore and just felt overall disappointed with this restaurant. Not only did we have to wait 35 minutes for our sushi, we also watched as three other customers come in, put in their to go orders, and got their food before we ever got any of our sushi. That wasn't the last of the disappointment either; their sushi rice seemed to be old rice. it was hard and dry and not appetizing at all. Their waitress also seemed like she didn't know much about the menu and what was going on while we were here. 

The only good thing going on about this restaurant is the fact that their fish does taste good. However, that doesn't make up for the rest of the disappointments that go on in this restaurant.

Basically, would I come again? Definitely not."}
{"text":"I really hate to write a negative review but I was pretty disappointed. I ordered takeout and was told my order would take approximately 25 minutes. I said that was fine and, having heard from a friend that the wait can be pretty long, waited an extra 15 minutes to make sure the food would be ready on time. When i got to the restaurant, at least 45-50 minutes after my call had been placed, I was told my food would be another 10 minutes and would this be okay. Given that I had made plans with friends and didn't have time to go order food elsewhere, I waited. However, I was pretty annoyed that there was no honesty about the time frame and no attempt to compensate for lost time.  The food was pretty standard but I don't plan on coming back any time soon."}
{"text":"Yesterday was my third time in a few years to try Sushi Time. I've lived right by the place for a couple years now, and often opt for the sushi in Whole Foods over this place, but yesterday I figured maybe the third time would be the charm. 

The first time I had sushi from here, I had one of their specials. I was not impressed with the special even though it came at a good price. The Shrimp Tempura roll was okay but nothing to write home about. The miso soup seemed like it had just been made from the paste and did not include any sushi or wakame. 

The next time I went there was during a marathon study session at Starbucks with a friend. We got hungry and decided to try Sushi Time again. My friend ended up feeling extremely nauseated after eating and we had to end our study session early. He got a California roll and a Spicy Tuna Roll that time. I don't remember what I ordered. It must not have been horrible, but it certainly wasn't memorable.

Sushi is probably one of my favorite foods and I love the fact that there is a sushi restaurant within walking distance from where I live. So I decided to try Sushi Time one last time yesterday afternoon. I was craving hamachi, but they don't have any at all. That's probably a sign I should have gone to Whole Foods - even they have yellowtail. I ended up ordering the Salmon Nigiri, a Spicy Tuna roll, and a Salmon Roll to go. I don't think they officially have a Salmon roll on the menu (just a Spicy Salmon roll), so I appreciate that they created one for me. However, when I got home and opened up the containers, everything smelled fishy. Raw fish should NEVER smell fishy.  I've had a stomach ache for the past 12 hours.

I'm done with Sushi Time. I will take the extra time to drive to Sushi Eye on Warner and 48th, or perhaps I will find another sushi restaurant that is a little bit closer thanks to Yelp."}
{"text":"I'm terrible at leaving reviews but I'll say the food is lit, the service is great, the owner is super nice, there's chill music always playing, and you can watch the owner make your food right there. 
I started coming here like 3 years ago and it's still my favorite place to go when I visit home. Everything is fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"HIDDEN GEM!
This place is awesome. 

The sushi is so good and the service was great for me as well. I did a to-go order but they let me hang out and kept my water filled while I waited.

The guy who's always behind the sushi bar seems like a cool buy. He's the only one I've ever seen making sushi. 

Love this place-- will be coming here for as long as I'm in Tempe!"}
{"text":"We are visiting from California and decided on sushi for tonight's meal. We yelped and were excited to see all the 4 and 5 star reviews and loved that we could make happy hour. I called and let them know we were headed there and they actually had a table waiting for us, which I appreciated since the restaurant is tiny. We were greeted promptly by a male server  and our drinks were delivered in a timely manner. We waited about 15 minutes before I asked the server to take our order and he literally PUT HIS HAND IN THE AIR and said absolutely nothing. It still took another 5 minutes before I asked the young lady (not our server) on the floor to take it for us and she is actually the one that ended up being the one that took care of us and was very apologetic throughout our meal. After our order was placed, it took 40 minutes before we even got miso soup, edamame and seaweed salad. We were still giving them the benefit of the doubt since there were to go orders and about 20 people in the restaurant. We finally got our rolls and they were delicious by all means. We put in an order for a second round (3 rolls and sake) and 30 minutes went by and we decided to cancel our order. My brother was the one to cancel and was speaking politely with the young lady and the chef immediately got defensive and said THE ROLLS ARE READY. If one of the rolls were ready, wouldn't they have been delivered? He got very loud and the whole restaurant could hear the conversation, which was a bit embarrassing. He kept arguing with my brother about them being done and we just got fed up. There was no reason for the way he spoke to us and made us feel like we were in the wrong. 

Again, the food was good, but customer service (other than the young lady) was horrible. We were there for 2 hours and watched a table leave because no one approached them and another family waited about 20 minutes before they got their drinks. I am a server and I always pride myself in customer service. If there is ever an issue, I fix it with grace and a smile."}
{"text":"Favorite in Tempe. Much better a little farther from ASU. Love the family that owns it. Good times."}
{"text":"This is my go-to sushi deliver place. The quantity is great for the price and it's always very fresh. 

Like someone else mentioned, double check your order over the phone as I've had a few mistakes, and remind them to actually give you the spicy mayo if you order a roll that has it. ;)

Delivery time is LONG so order in advance!! (Over an hour and a quarter in my experience) but their delivery guys are super nice!"}
{"text":"This is the first time I've written a review because this place is so delicious! My boyfriend and I have tried so many different sushi places and finally came across this one. The sushi was so fresh  and the happy hour prices were great.  It's a very small place but the staff was very friendly and attentive the whole time. Defiantly give this place a try but not on Sunday's."}
{"text":"What a great find for delicious sushi! The sushi rolls have wonderfully large portions of fish and everything tastes fresh. Nice and small, comfortable and clean. Wonderfully friendly and prompt service. Today was our second visit and definitely won't be our last."}
{"text":"Service is bad but sushis are good. Our waitress was totally clueless and didn't really seem to bother giving decent service. The wait time to get our food was pretty long too."}
{"text":"Love this neighborhood sushi spot!  Sushi chef is amazing and so friendly!  Great daily deals and happy hour!  Love the surprise roll."}
{"text":"We had a great dinner! We had tuna, salmon, and yellowtail sashimi... It was fresh and fantastic! Also enjoyed the jalapeño popper... The service was average but the food was fantastic!!! They also have a great happy hour... When we checked out we realized our saki was free!!! Big bonus!!! Definitely coming back!!"}
{"text":"I've ordered from both locations an embarrassing amount of times. They have the best soy sauce imo and always really good quality."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time today and was a little nervous because the place is so small, but it turned out to be some of the best sushi I've ever had! Shrimp Vegas roll was amazing and our server was very sweet. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"1st time here and love the atmosphere. Good was delicious. I would definitely come back. Las Vegas roll was gooood. You get free saki with large kirin."}
{"text":"This is why Koreans should never make sushi... Fish not fresh at all, poor presentation, I would never go back there again."}
{"text":"Sok Jin is awesome. He makes amazing sushi and great conversation. Be ready to sit down and take your time, and enjoy some delicious rolls. 

Notable rolls on the menu: Hot Night, Oh Baby, Surprise, Phoenix... The list goes on and on! Shrimp tempura appetizer is also delicious and you should make a note to try some soju if you're feeling adventurous! Ask Sok Jin to teach you about soju etiquette and enjoy some culture with a delicious drink.

If you're in a rush, get togo and call in advance. He is the only sushi chef all shift, and there's usually only one server on staff so not a place to go if you don't have some patience and understanding."}
{"text":"So, let me preface this review by stating that I have been here 5 times now due to working very close.  Most of the time I go for lunch because of their yakisoba lunch special.  The lunch special isn't a bad deal but it isn't great either.  I usually would head to one of a few other choice asian eateries if they weren't as far away.

Their happy hour special isn't too bad either but those are about the only reasons you should find yourself here.  As some of the other reviews state, the ingredients aren't very good and the preparation leaves much to be desired.

Today I stopped in for \"Chicken Cutlets\" and was quite disappointed to say the least as I spent about $10 for a small plate of food and a cup of Miso soup.  Needless to say even after finishing my food at sushi time I was still terribly hungry and opted to run over to whole foods for some sushi and finally felt like I ate something.

I mean, typically you would expect to get a decent portion or some tasty food for $10 at lunch. However, at sushi time you get neither.  Also, I am not sure but the person working there seemed quite preoccupied and paid little to no attention to me and when I had questions about the food she had an attitude like I was just some stupid \"round-eye\" and constantly brushed me off.

Regardless, I will not be back and am actually quite surprised that they are even still open."}
{"text":"We went here for happy hour, which starts at 6 p.m. (not your usual starting time). Another note: They only serve saki and beer. 

The place is quick service, so you order at the counter and then they bring out your food, which was very good, no complaints. Also, the service was very friendly. Highly recommend the avocado poppers and cheesy ramen. Our sushi-loving friends liked the rolls, not spectacular, but tasty."}
{"text":"Great food!  Good service. Had a number of rolls.  All were fresh and service promptly.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, hands down! Devoured some Shrimp Tempura: so crisp and buttery. Loved the Tuna Roll and Oh Baby Roll. Will be back for more!!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for a few years and it's always amazing! Anytime I venture off for other sushi places (like Sunday, when Sushi Time is closed) I'm always reminded when I come back how much more fresh and delicious Sushi Time is than other places I could go. The staff is friendly, and the sushi chef is lighthearted and tends to make jokes that make me laugh. This place is really great."}
{"text":"Sushi's ok/good, but the just-eat delivery takes FOREVER. 

1.5 hours the last 3 times I ordered. If you plan on ordering from here, just make sure you're ready to wait. 

If my partner didn't love their fire rolls so much, I'd pick somewhere else."}
{"text":"This is a great hole in the wall recommended by my date.  She loves this place.  

This place is unassuming and totally lacking of glitz and high decor but the great quality sushi more than makes up for it.  I ordered both the spicy albacore hand roll and sushi roll.  Both had top notch quality albacore sushi.  Presentation of sushi isn't fancy like some places.  

Miso soup was top notch too.  I highly recommend this place.  Seems to be operated by a nice old Japanese couple.  Good service too."}
{"text":"I like this place. It's okay. The rice is really good and the fish is fresh. The main problem here is customer service. Don't get me wrong, they are nice people and they try to please their customers. However, they often made mistakes in my order. There is always something wrong or something missing. Recently, I specified I did not want avocados and somehow 50% of my order is filled with avocado. If you eat sushis from this place, make sure they understood what you wanted and check your order before leaving."}
{"text":"Great! The food is good, the only problems are the AC: a bit cold and the parking: a bit small"}
{"text":"I have tried this place twice, and I was disapointed each time. My roommate and I waited 40 minutes for our food the first time we went, and we only ordered 4 rolls. Two of them were the wrong rolls and they only remade one of them. The second time we went, we waited almost an hour for our rolls, and they messed up one of the rolls that time too, and then argued with us about it. After they realized that they were wrong, they took all of our rolls back and took another 10 minutes to bring out the right ones. Our waiter barely ever stopped by our table or even looked at us, I felt as though we were invisible. The sushi is good, service is poor."}
{"text":"Best. Sushi. In Tempe. Best customer service and really great happy hour deals. Try the fever roll, you won't be disappointed!!!! Love Sushi Time!!!"}
{"text":"Friendly atmosphere. Decent sashimi but even better sushi.  Beer comes with a free sake. Staff are very attentive."}
{"text":"From Le journal de Montreal http://www.journaldemontreal.com/2016/04/22/horreurs-aux-sushis

Sushi time insalubre
En mars et avril 2015, le Sushi Time du 4534, rue Wellington s'est fait prendre pour de sérieux problèmes de propreté.
Odeurs nauséabondes sous les planches à découper, moisissures autour de l'évier, crottes de rongeurs sur les étagères.
La situation s'était améliorée en avril, mais pas assez. Le resto a reçu deux amendes de 750 $ et 900 $ le 18 janvier dernier.
\"Les inspecteurs sont revenus quelques mois après, et le risque est passé d'élevé à moyen, alors ça va beaucoup mieux\", dit la proprio Thanh Truc Tran."}
{"text":"Walked in to unfriendly staff. Only nice one was sushi chef. The server gave us dirty plates twice. The lady stared at us uncomfortably the whole entire time. Gave us attitude when we sent back an order after they messed it up. Very upset about the experience and left feeling very weird vibes. Sushi was good but place was dirty and unwelcoming. Never will go back again."}
{"text":"Sushi Time est un bar à sushi particulier, dont la spécialité est le sushi cuit, ce qui est un délicieux contre sens. J'ai pour ma part commandé une assiette de sushi fris, et sans que ce plat ait été une révélation, j'ai apprécié découvrir un goût différent. Le restaurant offre également la livraison, ce qui est plutôt rare pour ce type d'établissement. À essayer au moins une fois pour leur spécialité !"}
{"text":"This place is way too overpriced for what you get. The fish is nasty they use old avocado. I didn't know this was Korean owned, but if I knew this is what I was gonna get, I wish I might as well had just driven to Whole Foods right next to it and got 3 or 4 fresh rolls from there instread of here. The quality is nothing more than of a Fry's supermarket sushi. If this is what they've got to provide, then it shouldn't be so expensive. What upset me more than anything is the amount of rice on each rolls. There was barely any rice on it and i was still not even close to full after I finished three rolls. Does that mean I should have gotten another or two more California rolls? I generally only have good feedbacks and i don't ask for much but when i spent $20 for 3 basic rolls that wasnt even good and i had to make myself a cup noodle afterwards, it is very bad. Two stars because the server was nice to me but not the food."}
{"text":"Sushi are excellent and the prices decent, but service is slow, as with many sushi places: its never been \"bad\" per se, the staff is just clearly overwhelmed (and possibly understaffed) for the volumes of orders they're getting. 

This is mostly takeout and delivery; the actual restaurant is sparse and only has a few small tables. Probably not someplace you'd go out for meal with family or friends. But if you're looking for quality sushi to go, this is a great place; just make sure you give yourself an extra 15-20 minutes to get your order prepared.

Parking on and around Masson can be a pain, but there's a paid parking lot right behind the restaurant. Its one of those Leave-the-stub-on-your-dash parkings, so if you have time left when you leave do the neighbourly thing and offer it to someone pulling in, if you can."}
{"text":"Best sushi restaurant I ever had, good experience. Polite staff, clean and the foods are fresh. TASTY!!! worth to try it out."}
{"text":"Was craving sushi and gave this place a shot! They have fresh sushi and you can tell quality is key! One thing that bothered me is that they do not have garlic edamame and the regular edamame was too salty to digest! Overall, sushi was great we had the shrimp tempura and the crunch roll along with crab roll."}
{"text":"Decently priced sushi, however the quality is so-so. The restaurant is really dark, so I am not inclined to eat there."}
{"text":"Awesome place. I have a lot of allergies which makes eating out challenging. Here, the staff is amazing. Best of all the chefs and wait staff were attentive and careful about my allergies, even checking back with me to make sure. And the sushi was excellent and the portions large enough to satisfy my bottomless pitnof a son. We will be back whenever we are in town."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time with some friends. We went there for happy hour which ends at 8 and started off with sake and bear (which comes with a free sake) one positive but the server was HORRIBLE! 
There was barely anyone in the restaurant and we were walked past and ignored many times. She seemed clue less and had no idea what was in the sushi rolls. Also we ordered a bunch a food thinking it would be cheap because it was happy hour but for two people the bill was 90.00!! I don't know if she added wrong or the sushi was overpriced that much. For Kabuki this price would be understandable but for this hole in the wall place with average sushi, this is ridiculous. 
Not returning!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to have a sushi place so close to my house and highly rated on Yelp. We had our first dinner there tonight and ordered guyoza, chicken rice bowl, rainbow roll, caterpillar roll, yellowtail and tuna sushi. The service was great, but other than that I am baffled how this place gets a 4 star rating on Yelp. The food is 2.5 stars at best. I am giving e stars because of the service. The sushi is really mediocre. I especially didn't like that they put too much low quality imitation crab in these rolls. It is the type of sushi I would expect sitting out at a grocery store. Those that give 4 star ratings for Sushi Time must either work there or have never had good sushi before."}
{"text":"I've had sushi in many states and multiple cities and Sushi Time is #1.  The owner makes every roll with such precision and care.  You can't go wrong here"}
{"text":"Sushi Time was a big leap of faith, as with eating any raw meat. My fiancée and I decided we wanted to try it out after reading several reviews that actually had to deal with their sushi we decided that it was worth a shot. 
   The first thing we noticed when going in there was the potential for deafness by the onslaught of horrible music. Sorry to all you Brittany Spears fans out there, but definitely not something I want to listen to while nom'ing on some sushi. Sushi Time is pretty small, about 10-15 tables total. It's reminds me of any small-time, mom 'n pop style restaurant. These are the style of restaurants that if it's good, it pays off. If it's bad, kiss the rest of the afternoon goodbye while you spend it feeling horribly sick and parking the Buick, if you know what I mean. 
   The next thing I noticed was the prices... WOW! This place has some serious awesome prices to me, but this also can be a blessing in disguise. Good prices, doesn't always mean good food. All said and done, we escaped paying only $24 for: 2 Sodas, 1 order of Crunchy Crab rolls, 1 order of Philadelphia rolls and 1 order of Spicy Tuna rolls. Now anybody that knows Sushi should know that is a pretty good freakin' price for the amount of food. So this is the first place they've scored points with me by not trying to empty my wallet. The number of rolls/cost ratio was amazing at this place. Both the Spicy Tuna rolls and the Philadelphia rolls were a 6 pc. plate and the Crunchy Crab rolls a 8 pc. plate. Not bad...
   The lack of expenditure on cash does not always mean good food, and in some cases has the direct opposite affiliation. So not the case with this place. I was presently greeted by the Philadelphia  rolls and although I am not a huge fan of tuna, the Spicy Tuna rolls were pretty awesome as well. The Crunchy Crab rolls-- practically melted in my mouth. These things were amazing. Now I know these are kind of a cop out because the fried crab, but man, they were still good. All in all, the only complaint I had with the rolls we purchased is that the Philadelphia rolls had a tad bit too much cream cheese in them, but none the less still pretty good. What pleased me the most is after going to several sushi places, my future wife has had a heck of a time finding a good Spicy Tuna roll. Well, she found it here, and that made me extremely happy. 

   All and all, I give this place 4 stars-- enough to come back as possibly a regular.  A year ago, I didn't even touch sushi, the thought of raw fish made my insides revolt. Now, I can't get enough of it. The other thing I would like to mention is that I'm giving this place a cheap rating based on an individual cost. You could easily get away with spending under $10 at this place and have a descent sized meal. Cheers all, and would totally recommend checkin' this place out."}
{"text":"I love Sushi Time. Before I moved out of the Tempe area, I used to go there once or twice a week for carry out. They are a very clean, cute place for eat-in or carry out. They always have two specials (A or B). Special \"A\" was usually a roll or sushi pieces with a hot entree and Special \"B\" was usually two rolls. Both were usually served with miso soup and usually less that $12 total. 

The staff is always very friendly and polite. They also have a lot of good specials for their dine-in guests. And they have a good variety of rolls and other menu options. 

It's in the same shopping center as the Whole Foods and I think a lot of people don't really know about it. But it's a great sushi place!  I'd go there more often if I lived closer."}
{"text":"Wonderful food & fantastic service! Try the Oh Baby & Phoenix roll, both an incredible"}
{"text":"THE best sushi! Always super friendly & timely! It is always s good price for the freshness of the sushi!"}
{"text":"Not sure how this place got a 4 star but I was not impressed by the food at all. I ordered the albacore surprise, salmon skin hand roll and bf ordered the combo B special which is shrimp tempura and California roll with miso soup ($12) and a salad. The albacore was not fresh but that is expected for Arizona (3 stars) but what kills me is the salmon skin hand roll which only had cucumber, salmon skin (over cooked almost burnt) and rice...no other veggie or pickle making it super dry!!! Bf was ehhhh with his food too. Won't come back!"}
{"text":"Can't say it's the best sushi I've ever had but definitely found it good. I would go back. All the roles were tasty. I didn't particularly like the special queen, that's because I'm not a big fan of cooked salmon. It was too fishy for my liking. 
The rest were quite good. I particularly liked the chef sushi and Mexican role. 
One small disappointment was the staff didn't remind me that if I ordered 25$ or more u get a. Futumakis free. Ive been to other shops and alway was told when my order was clearly over. Once I paid I let them know it was cool that it wasn't mentioned. 
So look at the first page when U order and remind them to include the bonus role :)"}
{"text":"I pass this place all the time and I'm regretting that I didn't visit sooner. The sushi is amazing! I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"I had a very good experience here. The sushi is tasty and the waitresses are very helpful when I need to order. I love this place!!!"}
{"text":"This isn't a bad place. The service I get is great and the food is ok. If you want a sushi fix, this does it. I love the daily combos that they have, and unless you're getting a huge amount of rolls--not too bad in cost. My only problem is the tempura is a bit greasy and the miso usually has huge chunks of onion in it. I do that to say I've had worse miso though. Best Cali rolls I've had though."}
{"text":"We came here after reading the reviews on yelp, at first I was a little skeptical because of the pictures. The restaurant didn't look nice, however they remodeled everything and it's look great!
They had a special today, one Las Vegas roll, one California roll and a Miso soup for $12 (I think it's fairly cheap) the Las Vegas was very good, as well as the miso soup. The rice of the California roll was a bit too dry for me. 
The sushi chef was very friendly, he wasn't our server but he started talking to us. And we had a very nice/long conversation, he even took a picture with my friend ! 
We had a very nice time there, we will come back during Happy Hour to try it out!"}
{"text":"I used to come here almost daily 5-6 years ago when they still hadn't remodeled the place yet and I remember the sushi and food was delicious!!! I loved their cheese ramen noodles but I was so sad when they took it off the menu. I recently moved back to Tempe so this is definitely my go to for quick and tasty sushi. I've never had bad service here and will continue coming back for more food! 

P.S. If a manager is reading this, please bring back the Cheese Ramen! It's mouthwatering just thinking about it!"}
{"text":"Had a home delivered meal from just eat from here.. The menu really excited me and the food didn't disappoint. Really enjoyed my meal. The food was fresh, warm (soup and fried stuffs) and delivered on time."}
{"text":"Great spot!!! Excellent staff and cute ambiance. Have to try the surprise roll! Miso soup is stand up as well. Will be back!!!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years!! My friend took me here for my first time and I have been hooked ever since!! LoL

It's is a small establishment that has been remodeled. Right when you walk in you are greeted by the family like staff, very welcoming. I'm not sure, but I think it's family owned. I always see the same guy making the sushi and pretty much the same waiters/waitresses. 

Now for the food. I think the portions are perfect, especially for the price. It's hard to find great tasting sushi that doesn't cost outrages amounts. I mainly get the sushi here so honestly I can't express how I feel about the other things on the menu, but I'm sure they taste just as good.

I definitely recommend this place for sushi lovers and people new to sushi. Don't mess up your first sushi experience, you could be scarred for life!! LoL Oooohh and they have a Happy Hour too!!"}
{"text":"Talk about awesome. I always manage to forget this place is nearby. It took seeing a Jimmy Johns to stop in the plaza and remember it the other day, and a few days later, as a friend and I were both low on groceries, we decided to head over. It's one of her favorite places to go, and as soon as we walked in I could see why. 

It's like a sushi dive bar.. the perfect sushi place to have near your house. It's the place you can walk into in your pajamas and not feel out of place. It's the sushi place you can enjoy easily by yourself. There is no bar to sit by, but it doesn't even really seem to bother you while you're there. 

The staff remembers you and your name... and your order. And whether it's to dine in or take out, you are served quickly. The menu is simple and makes ordering quick. I decided to go with a Philadelphia and a spicy salmon. I was completely satisfied. It was filling, just the right size, and very well made. 

Happy hour has some great sake and half off roll specials that sound like a great after work trip some lazy middle of the week when I feel like going out but without all the dolled up drama. What a win!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! It's my second time here, they remodeled the place since the first time I came in. It's so nice!...and the sushi is unbelievable. The surprise roll is incredible, and try the scallop hand roll, it's unique and delicious! The chef is the owner, and he makes it all right there in front of you. Great place!"}
{"text":"Amazing service and amazing atmosphere. We got the dragon roll, salmon roll, California roll, and seaweed salad. We love taking home leftovers so it was the perfect amount. The food was so good!"}
{"text":"I got to thank my fellow Yelpers for finding this place. I had a craving for sushi, and I've recently begun a quest to try more new places. And when a place with a name like Sushi Time averages four stars, I had to see what it was all about. And, I was not disappointed! 

It's not the best rolls you'll ever have, but Sushi Time is on par with most places in the valley, and A LOT cheaper! Not only are the prices low, but from 6pm to 9pm (close), it's happy hour. Buy a specialty roll, and regular rolls are half off. You also get free hot Saki with your beer. For about $30 We got two beers and Saki (beer only comes in small bottles, but why complain, the Saki wasn't good but it was free), Alaska rolls (really good, but could have used a little more of the mustard sauce), spicy tuna rolls (very good, definitely had a spicier kick than most sushi bars), and spicy salmon rolls (decent, but didn't do it for me). 

The restaurant was empty. My girlfriend and I were one of only two couples there at 8:00 on a Friday night. One other person did come in to pick up a carry out order, but that was it. It may seem strange to people that Sushi Time is in a strip mall and is a quick service restaurant (you order at the register and they bring you your food), but at these prices for this quality, It's worth it. A great place to start your night, especially if you're heading to Mill Avenue or Tempe Market Place. The staff was also very nice, and very accommodating.

It's at Baseline and Rural, near Whole Foods and Jimmy Johns. I actually used to live right across the street from there. If I still did, I would be eating at Sushi Time all the time. Being in Scottsdale now, It's still worth the drive if I want sushi and want to keep the cost low."}
{"text":"Friendly  and attentive staff. The daily specials are a good deal and the Phoenix Roll is our favorite."}
{"text":"I have been going here for two years and I must say I really do enjoy it. I can go anywhere for good sushi, but friendly staff  is the main selling point for me. This is definitely a place that makes you feel welcomed and the owner is a very charming and patient person. I would recommend this place to anyone. :)"}
{"text":"Cheap, with good quality sushi for the price you pay.  Sushi time isn't fine gourmet sushi, but it'll get the job done if you're craving rolls.  Compared to similar small independently owned sushi restaurants, the sushi is fresher, and there is a good portion of it on your roll.  Happy hour is from 5-9 every day, and rolls are buy one, get one half off (For the first 7 rolls on the menu).  More specialty rolls will be a little less than 10 dollars each.  

The decor and interior inside is very bare-bones, has dark lighting, and seems kind of depressing to me.  The interior is similar to a mom-and-pop Mexican food restaurant, except we're dealing in sushi here."}
{"text":"It's sushi.

Living on the ASU campus means that it's hard to find half-decent sushi unless I trek to Scottsdale. This place was pretty close to campus so we decided to try it out. Maybe it's just being from the East Coast, where the fish is a bit fresher, or maybe this place just really isn't anything special.

My friend and I got the special they were offering for the day. A California roll, a shrimp tempura roll, and miso soup to-go for $12. My excitement for my sushi, after reading positive reviews about this place, quickly waned as I failed to taste any difference between this sushi and any sushi around.

Nothing was sub-par, but it didn't exceed expectations either. My tempura roll was excessively salty and lacked flavor. I could hardly discern any flavor of the actual fish itself, and was overall disappointed with this sushi. The miso soup was actually pretty good and flavorful, but I came here in search of tasty sushi, not soup. 

I won't say that this restaurant is particularly bad. Yet, I can't help but feel indifferent toward this place. Their bland sushi couldn't give my palate a strong opinion on anything, really. I doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"Sushi was warm... Very over priced for what we got. Service was the best part of our meal, but the food was sub par."}
{"text":"Sushi time's sushi is pretty reasonably priced and decent if you're in the mood for sushi. It's what led us to order several times from them using the \"Just Eat\" app. Honestly I'd usually give this place a 4 star rating but they have aptly earned only two. Constantly their delivery takes well over an hour when we live 10 only minutes away, also we are usually 4-5 people ordering sushi so we ask for 4-5 pairs of chopsticks and spicy mayo on the side. We write it in the comment section, which they are suppose to read but only 20% of the time do they actually read it. Seriously how do they expect 4-5 people to eat sushi with only two pairs of chopsticks! However good their sushi is, we've been put off enough to look elsewhere from now on"}
{"text":"I tried this place because of the great reviews. It was average in my opinion. Polite staff, quiet place."}
{"text":"Tried it last week and it was AMAZING!
I am most definitely going back and ordering again. The place is clean and has a great vibe to it, the servers and sushi cook are super friendly and quick.
I ordered a philly roll & a rainbow roll. Both were amazing. 
Definitely give this place a shot if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Really good foods! Even the owner is Korean but the sushi is authentic!!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place out, but unfortunately I don't think I'll be back.  Not the greatest place for sushi sad to say. Good things first, the restaurant is very clean and has an environment that easy to just sit down and chat for a meal, nothing fancy.  
My friends and I had a few rolls and the yakisoba noodles.  The rice on the spicy tuna and albacore rolls were old like it had been left out in the open for too long.  The fish in the rolls weren't too bad, but it was a bit chewy.  We also got the Eel Special and Crunch roll, which both had a decent flavor, but nothing really stood out or had anything that was creative about them at all.  The yakisoba noodles were okay in flavor, but there was a pool of sauce on the bottom of the bowl, which shouldn't be an issue with any kind of stir-fry.  
I work at a sushi place so I'm always out on the look out for great sushi joints.  This isn't one of them.   Save your time and money and try Sakana instead!"}
{"text":"Nice cosy little spot, very friendly staff. Had  the salmon sushi and the California roll. Buddy had the tuna sushi and the Phoenix roll. Everything was really good. Free hot saki with a beer. Decent happy hour prices. Thought it was a bit pricey though"}
{"text":"This place is perfect. If you like sushi this place is great. Small nondescript location near whole foods with fresh and yummy food!"}
{"text":"The service was pretty good, but the food was mediocre and overpriced.  Also, they didn't have gluten free soy sauce, which almost all sushi places have."}
{"text":"I love this place! Been coming here for a few years since I live nearby! The owner is friendly, great service, and the specials are easy and affordable!"}
{"text":"The sushi here is cheap and good quality for what you pay.

I've never eaten in - the place itself looks pretty iffy and dark - but I've gotten home delivery quite a few times, and always been happy with it. Delivery has always been prompt, and I've never had any problem with the quality. It usually costs about $30 all up for my girlfriend and I to eat well.

If you want the best sushi in Verdun, then you want Aka-Fuji down the road.

If you want a cheap and healthy meal delivered to your door, it's SUSHI TIME!"}
{"text":"I've had this dream to be Samurai since I was little. I would to eat sushi, drink Sake' and charm Geisha's all day. Then I would go pillage and fight other Samurais' with a bad-ass sword. Anyways, that never happened but this sushi is really fresh and good so you should eat here. 

The Saki is warm, delicious, and goes well with cold beer. 

The Chef is a awesome, he makes badass sushi. 

If you can't be a Samurai...... Eat here."}
{"text":"Good place to stop by for a quick lunch time bite if you are in the area. 

I have heard their sushi is very good, I didn't par take in any this time. I got the dumplings and terriacki chicken bowl. Do not go by what things look like on the menu, Soooo not what your food comes out looking like unfortunately. The \"veggies\" they speak of that come in the bowl are onions and some cabbage, made me happy cuz I like both, but if you are expecting broccoli and carrots, not gonna happen. 

Defiantly stop in, try some sushi, good prices and nice seating area."}
{"text":"I love this place. Amazing fresh sushi. The sushi chef is always very friendly. Best sushi I have had in the valley."}
{"text":"Very very good sushi! The Phoenix and hot night roll were tasty! And the jalapeño poppers were different but still great, gyoza was crispy and delicious!"}
{"text":"I love coming here. Sushi is great and the owner (Sushi Chef) is very friendly and nice. He is the only sushi chef, so if it's busy you may have to wait a little bit for your rolls, but he does a good job. You have to come early on Friday or Saturday to get the Yellowtail, it's the best here. It's a small place but comfortable. Love this place"}
{"text":"Great food, fun chefs and a very relaxing and laid back environment.  Music is great also."}
{"text":"Not the best or freshest sushi I've ever had but the prices are reasonable and the staff very accommodating. They have specials which make this place more enticing."}
{"text":"Free sake with the beer is a really nice touch but the crunchy roll was the hit.

I ordered Special B which was a California roll, Crunchy roll and miso soup.  Miso soup was the same as every other sushi place so don't expect an amazing mind blowing miso experience. The California roll was also similar to what you get anywhere else but the nori (seaweed) was a little more chewy than my experiences but nonetheless it was tasty.  The right amount of soy sauce and Sriracha will make anything taste good though...well, almost anything. 

The crunchy roll was the star. A nice balance of sweet and crunchy and just plain tasty. Well done Itamae-San Johnny! The preparation was clean and intended for presentation versus thrown on a plate for consumption. Thanks!

What else? Small, quiet, strip mall with no TV (other than the looping HD fish tank) and you can't see the fish when you sit at the 'bar'. Attentive staff, good prices and worth the visit."}
{"text":"Endroit parfait pour aller chercher des sushis ou pour une livraison! Tout est bon et abordable! Manger sur place est beaucoup moins intéressant! Ce n'est juste pas fait pour ça! J'y vais souvent et je suis toujours satisfaite!"}
{"text":"For fast take out with a good quality-taste price it's our spot. It's always ready fast and the service is good. Do recommend if you're craving quick sushi in Verdun!"}
{"text":"A nice cozy atmosphere. Small but not cramped. The food is on par for Arizona sushi ;) Friendly staff nice and clean!"}
{"text":"My first time here, I really liked it. The service was excellent, the chef was super friendly and accommodating (I asked to have my cali roll with masago on top), and the prices were fair (didn't go during happy hour). I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Always great service and great food. My husband and I always sit at the bar so we can talk to the sushi chef. Such a nice guy! This place feels so cozy and relaxing, not like a lot of other sushi restaurants. Oh and the happy hour is pretty good if you want to get your sake on :)"}
{"text":"This is my favorite and currently sworn to go no other place sushi spot.

I messed up once and went to Sushi 101 thinking it would be ok. 101's sushi compared Sushi Time, not even close! With only one sushi chef, he does a superior job over four sushi chefs. He doesn't miss a beat on quality, presentation or customer rapport.

I will not go anywhere else for sushi and my boyfriend, being from the east coast, will go to no other as well.

Note to first timers:
You may have to wait awhile for food on a busy night but trust me and trust all the repeating customers, it is well worth the wait! 
I actually find great comfort in it because I know he is not rushing and I am going to get what I paid for. Speaking of prices, damn good compared to other places. 

Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Fresh sushi every time, very pleasant environment and staff. The sushi chef always remembers your friendly face and is happy to see you again. We always enjoy going here and recommend it to all our friends."}
{"text":"I don't normally write reviews but I'm pretty annoyed at this moment . My boyfriend and I came into this restaurant around happy hour . First of all , I have no idea why but our server seemed shy or something but we just couldn't really communicate well with her . So my boyfriend mentioned how we didn't want cream cheese in our order . Some how our order came out with cream cheese . No big deal , we told our server and she seemed like she didn't know what to do and brought out this other girl server who was rude as hell. Confronted us and said that it says in the description that it has cream cheese like we can't read?????? Our whole experience is ruined because of her attitude and the service, I don't understand why it was so difficult to simply fix an order . Sad because the food was great . Not coming back. I work in the restaurant industry and that was just bad service ."}
{"text":"Je dois avouer que la première fois que j'ai pensé aller au Sushi Time, je suis rentrée puis sortie en moins de 2 minutes. Ça n'est pas accueillant comme endroit et disons que ça porte à se poser des questions sur le côté sanitaire de l'endroit. Il y a quelques semaines, des amis de l'extérieur voulaient me faire une belle surprise et m'ont promis un lunch de sushi... en me montrant le dépliant et en me disant qu'ils font la livraison, je me suis dit que tout le monde à droit au moins à une chance. Et j'étais super contente parce que les sushi sont pas mal bons (pour Montréal...), le prix est assez bas et la livraison rapide considérant que c'est fait sur commande. Je ne voulais pas écrire d'avis avant de l'essayer au moins une autre fois, et maintenant que c'est fait, je pense bien que ça va devenir un de mes endroits préférés quand je suis trop paresseuse non seulement pour faire à manger, mais aussi pour sortir!"}
{"text":"Walked in here asked for some Sushi was told that they didn't have any rice at 6:30 in the evening. 

No rice wha!!! Hence no sushi. 


Won't be back here again"}
{"text":"My daughter and I like to have lunch here quite often. The service is good and prices are very reasonable. The Sushi Chef is very friendly and makes some awesome rolls. They have daily specials too which is always a good deal. I would recommend anyone wanting some good sushi rolls to give this place a try."}
{"text":"First time.... LOVED IT! 
Try hot n spicy - BOMB (not that hot)
Alaskan was GOOD
Las Vegas was BOMB BOMB!!
Small place so expect a wait if you wanna show up at popular times on a friday or Saturday. Price is exactly what you get. Yummy! (:"}
{"text":"I went here with a friend for lunch and I must say that it was alright. The place doesn't look like much from the outside... in fact, I was a little nervous going in, but the inside is nicely decorated. I was a bit disappointed that they had only 2 lunch specials (neither one something I would like) so we had to order off of the dinner menu which was fairly pricey. They don't even give you a salad or anything at lunch (really unusual for a sushi spot) and to order a side salad was $5.50...ridiculous. I ordered gyoza and the spicy scallop hand roll. I have never had a hand roll before, and it was alright, but hard to eat.... I probably wouldn't order one again. The gyoza were the typical gyoza (like frozen), but they fried them so at least they were crispy. My friend said her two rolls were alright. This place wasn't bad, but I don't think I would come here again."}
{"text":"I like this place. The rolls are well made and the atmosphere is fun. They have the tunes playing while the fish tank is displayed on the large screen television."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and place to have a good conversation while eating a meal. We had the veggie and California rolls and miso soup. The soup was amazing and the food overall hit the spot."}
{"text":"Prices are way too high. Philadelphia rolls, made correctly, are $8. The quality could be better too. Not going back."}
{"text":"nothing special.
plain old lame sushi.
it's not delicious too.. 
just good to satisfy your hunger.. and that's it..
affordable though"}
{"text":"Love this local spot! Bear in mind, there is only 1 sushi chef - the owner - so it does take time, this is not the place to go if you are in a time crunch unless it is a quiet night. I've never been disappointed though. They will not serve bad fish, so everything is tasty. Additionally, you get hot sake with your beer purchase so that always helps while waiting :) I also appreciate that the menu is small. you aren't overwhelmed with options. 
Recommendation - if you are in a time crunch, call in an order to go so it's ready when you are!"}
{"text":"Score one for the small businesses. I stopped in here with my wife for lunch. She had the California Roll and I gave the Surprise Roll a try. We also shared some fried Gyoza potstickers.

The CA roll was pretty standard, but the Surprise Roll earned it's name! This is a CA roll with Shrimp Tempura topped with avocado and three sauces: spicy sauce, eel sauce, and a white sauce that I would bet is just mayo. This was remarkably good, though I could do without the mayo and would have liked a maybe spicier touch. I would have this again. The Gyoza was pretty standard too, but quite good. This topped us off just fine.

Gyoza: 3/5
California Roll: 3/5
Surprise Roll: 5/5

Clean: 4/5
Service: 4/5"}
{"text":"Great tuna roll! Fresh and tasty! Great happy hour deals, including by a beer or sake and get a free sake....whaaaaaaatt??!! Love it! 
Tempura was crisp and buttery. Interior a little small (read 6 tables) but cozy and warm. 
Overall quite impressed with the food!!!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, and the staff is very friendly and nice.  I like to take my son here (he's the only other one in our house that will eat sushi) and we hang out here and talk and eat.   Nice casual place for a normal meal.  Nothing too fancy here ... which is all right."}
