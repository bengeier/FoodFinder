{"text":"Had a great lunch here at the Port Credit Social House. You can tell the kitchen cares, everything is made from scratch and prepared really well.

We had a chicken club sandwich and the signature burger with cheddar and bacon, and both were delicious. The club has a generous amount of freshly grilled chicken breast, not something from the deli counter, nice crispy bacon, fresh tomatoes, real cheddar, and a huge pile of fresh cut fries.

The signature Burger was well-done as Ontario law requires, but was clearly a fresh hand-made patty that managed to be beefy and juicy, making a mess of my hands and the plate, in exactly the way it's supposed to. The burger was also accompanied by a huge pile of fries, which were fresh cut, nicely browned, and absolutely delicious.

I would say the prices are on the higher end, not a bargain, but certainly in keeping with the neighborhood, with the sandwiches coming in around $15 bucks each, including fries and a pickle wedge - beer or boat drinks extra. ;)

All in all a really delicious lunch, overlooking a beautiful patio that was absolutely bursting with colorful flowers and hanging plants, from a small casual dining room with a combination of beautiful glossy butcherblock high-top and regular dining tables.

We received great service too, from our waitress who was super cute and very friendly, and the manager even stopped by to make sure everything was good, as well.

One of the better places to grab a burger and a beer in Port Credit, and one of the very few places in the neighbourhood with free parking to go with it, in the boatyard parking lot that the social house hides in.

The warmer weather will see the large patio reopening. Great to see this place doing well. Come for the beer and food and stay to chew the fat with locals and boaters alike."}
