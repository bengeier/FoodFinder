{"text":"Listen up people of the internet, because I just ran home very excited solely to come online and tell all of madison that they HAVE to try Sliced smoked brisket sandwich. 

About ten minutes ago I was about to drive by the establishment like I do every day.  I wondered how it stays open because it always looks empty??!? Thus i decided i better support my belly by supporting this local business  and HOLY CRAP am I Sooooo glad I did.

The moment I saw smoked brisket on the drive thru menu, I  decided I wanted that. It is always a favorite but fast food places usually can't cut do it justice. Not only that, I thought this must be small because it's only $4 for brisket... but no ...I  promise you that isn't the case.

As soon as I opened my bag that the gentleman handed me my eyes lit up with delight. Through the clear sandwich wrap, I could see the hot brisket juices meshing with the BBQ, seeping frim the sides. Not in a sloppy way, but in a very inviting way that says \"eat me, because I'm going to be a meaty, juicy party in your mouth.\"

That brisket did not lie. It was piled on and coming out the sides. It was smoked to perfection. The tender meat flavor was not hidden by too much BBQ ,onion straws, or (mayo?). It was orchestrated to have the perfect ratio of each. 

This was hands down the best sandwich since living in wisconsin. Vintage \" Big Dixie\" takes a close second, but honestly any red MEAT made to perfection like this can't possibly come second to anything.

 I'd take this $4 sandwich any day of the week and I URGE you to visit  this gem of a restaurant!!! 

I'd easily pay $10 to eat that again! 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I stop by a couple of times each month.   The selection is very good.  The prices are very reasonable.  My favorite is the Carolina Style Pulled Pork Sandwich.   The meat is very tender and it has the right spices.    This restaurants beats the chain fast food joints any day.   Plus, the quality of the food is soo much better.   The only thing that I can say negative is that they serve their drinks in styrofoam cups. I prefer the paper kind.  Also, sometimes they wrap their sandwitches in heavy plastic wrap.  If you have a nice juicy sandwich and you eat while you drive, it can be messy. Overall, I recommend the restaurant for its good value and quality food.   Plus, it supports a local business man vs. a national chain."}
{"text":"Had the French dip, it's good quality for the price. They have a pretty wide selection and the employees were very personable and willing to give recommendations. It's a nice alternative to the other fast food in the area, check them out!"}
{"text":"I had the BLT. It tasted like a homemade BLT and was loaded with bacon. Was my first time. Must try again soon!"}
{"text":"Best brisket sandwich I've ever had. Food is great and so is the atmosphere. I'll be back. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"First off, I would like to preface this review by stating my name. It's Justin Palmer.  The reason I feel it necessary, is because I left a review on Google under my Google name which is Bobby Edwards. The owner, Kevin, decided  to post my full name  on Google Reviews by referring to my credit card info which I used to buy the sandwich days ago.  I don't know if that's a crime for violation of privacy by a business, but I will definitely be pursuing.  Maybe it's his way to attempt to discredit me. This man is vindictive and reckless.  But again my name is Justin Palmer. I went here a couple days ago for the third time in a few months, and quite honestly, I enjoyed their sandwiches. But something happened this last visit that should never happen in food and beverage. A few bites in, I noticed something was missing but wasn't quite sure. A little bit less than half way into the sandwich I discovered that the cheese I ordered was never put on the sandwich. So I brought the sandwich up to the counter to have a new sandwich made. Kevin, who I believe is the owner, signaled to his sandwich maker in the back to bring out a slice of cheddar cheese to slap on top of my already half eaten and soggy sandwich.  Because I was looking to get back to work on time, I requested that he make me a new sandwich that i can take to go. Kevin gave me a look that nobody in the service industry should give a customer then under his breath mumbled, \"who doesnt notice cheese is missing after almost halfway through a sandwich\".   I was shocked even more when he stated that he saw his sandwich maker put the cheese on my sandwich which was a blatant lie.   I was beyond offended and no paying customer should be ridiculed and accused of such things. Minutes later I returned  to the counter to give Kevin the benefit of the doubt and ask him  to stand by what he just said . This time he stated that he thinks he saw  his coworker put cheese on the sandwich.  He was changing his story as we went along . So in short, Kevin, the business owner, is both a cheapskate and a liar. Beware, if your sandwich is made wrong. According to Kevin you must realize this before you begin to eat the sandwich otherwise you're a liar and a thief in his eyes. This man does not belong in any service industry let alone food and beverage. I will never eat here again. And I highly suggest you take your hard-earned money elsewhere.  Paying customers who receive items incorrectly made do not deserve to be called a liar or Thief.  Kevin will respond to this review by falsely stating that people in the store witnessed this account and complained about my demeanor. This is not true. Because when I was in the store, there was only one Patron who was perfectly comfortable with the interaction.  Kevin stated that I called him a c*cksuck*r which is about as big a lie as stating he saw his sandwich maker put cheese on the sandwich. Then in his rebuttal to my Google review he mocked my complaint with snide remarks like, \"you should go to cheese.com\".   He also stated that I told him I would see him in town which is a complete fabrication. What I did say is \"do you want to retract your decision before I go out into to town and share my experiences with the public?.\" This man lies and accuses and fabricates on a consistent basis and he should not be trusted.  Look for Kevin. He's an older gentleman with white hair and he's usually got a headset on and works the drive thru. Trust me when I tell you this, the sandwiches are decent but this man is rude and vindictive."}
{"text":"Tried out Sliced for my first time tonight. My finance ordered 2 gyros fries and I ordered chicken strips and fries. Everything was absolutely delicious! The manager and/or owner was very friendly. The restaurant was very clean and had an awesome back area with \"dome like\" windows. Great experience! We definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Why would you ever go to a chain fast food place when this is higher quality for the same price?! Delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty awesome. I wish it were closer to me, I'd probably be going all the time. 
It's like a build your own fast-food place, with better ingredients more akin to a \"fast casual\" restaurant. And while the quality of the sandwiches is at least equal to Quiznos or Jimmy Johns, the prices are notably cheaper. - and different than just subs. When I saw the Pulled Pork Sandwich was only $2.99 I couldn't believe my eyes. 

Huge selection too, I can't vouch for most of it, but based on the quality if what I had (built my own chicken sandwich with Arby's equivalent curly fries on the side), I'd guess the rest may be up to par. There's mozzarella sticks, five or six kinds of soup, shakes, too many types of sandwiches to count (with at least five different bread types, and option of hot or cold).

The decor has definitely been updated to make it feel a lot more homey than the old Arby's shell as well."}
{"text":"Great change from your typical drive thru burger spots . I've tried the gyro and Philly cheese steak both had great flavor and fresh ingredients. The prices are low as well"}
{"text":"A little disappointed with my first visit to sliced. 

I won't go into detail about what the place is as previous reviews have done an admirable job of explaining it. I like the description of it being an \"Arby's PLUS\" 

This was a drive through visit and I found the menu board a little confusing. so it may be better to go in for your first visit. 

My curly fries were fresh, hot, crispy outside, soft inside... Honestly they're the best curly fries I've had in decades. Probably since curly fries first hit the Arby's menu and gained popularity. Unfortunately those were the highlight of my visit and saved this from being a 2 star review. 

The sandwich did have fresh ingredients, but was sorely lacking in all of them. I had to dig around before I realized the small slice of cheese was melted into to the meat. Well... It was lacking in everything except for the one ingredient I asked for \"only a little\" of... The mustard. This was like a mustard sandwich with a side of meat and lettuce. I've included a picture so you can get a sense of the ridiculousness. I'd love to tell you how the sandwich tasted, but honestly, even after scraping off as much of the mustard as I could, it's all I tasted. 

So, I don't know. I might give them a second chance just for the fries, but it probably won't be any time soon."}
{"text":"This is the only thrive-thru place in Madison worth my time. Not entirely sure of the origin on it's design, but Sliced makes sandwiches that put fast food samdwich places to shame. 

The ingredients used are of way higher quality than most competitors in the drive-thru business. This is what Arbys would be like if they gave a crap about their customers. And guess what? ITS CHEAPER TOO. Everything is delicious and I will never even stray near a fast food joint as long as Sliced is around. Always a good option for me when I'm in a pinch for a quick meal. Definitively a gem of the west side."}
{"text":"Went for the first time today. Had the rueben and curly fries. The rueben was really good on fresh pumpernickel bread. Sauce was very good too. The fries were cooked to order, fresh and hot. They have a great selection of food to choose from. I will be back. I used the drive up window. Nice change from the burger fast foods."}
{"text":"Didn't really know what to think of the change from Arby's to \"Sliced\" at first. I was never all that in love with Arby's, and I figured this was more of a re-branding in order to get a quick influx of new, curious customers.

Now that I've actually tried it, I'm fairly impressed. I purchased a Reuben sandwich and some curly fries, and my girlfriend got a Buffalo Chicken sandwich and a side salad. As with most Reubens I've gotten at other restaurants, I expected this one to be fairly greasy, but I was surprised by just how NOT greasy it was. The bread was moist, but didn't have me wiping my hands every two seconds, and I was able to eat at my work desk without worrying about a horrid mess. They even honored my request to keep the thousand island on the side. The sandwich was a bit small, given the price, but it was tasty at least. Curly fries were also good, but I ordered a medium (which is fairly expensive) and it seemed like they barely gave me a handful.

My girlfriend reported that her sandwich was nice and tender, but she was especially impressed by the size and low price of the side salad she got (also very tasty according to her).

All in all, not a bad place for a quick, semi-cheap lunch. I'll definitely be coming back to try a few other sandwiches."}
{"text":"it's hard to believe such simple sandwiches can be so memorable. It's like going over to Grandmas's for dinner very yummy .
i have been here five times and each time have tried a new sand which .Every single one has such great flavor. I have slot of food allergies and i usually cannot eat out the ingredients are not heated from boxes they are very homemade.  
The baked potatoes are super amazing and i am not a fan of potatoes really in general .
The gyros are really pretty damn good and you can't beat the price . 
So nice to have a dinner where i don't have to cook once in awhile ."}
{"text":"I had the smoked brisket weekly special and it was exceptional in both its flavor and value. I was more than willing to wait the extra minute it took to have my sandwich prepared with the additional care and attention it took to get me this good food, fast. As for the service, I was greeted warmly and didn't feel rushed. One suggestion - let's get some collards on the menu."}
{"text":"Great variety on the menu, and I've tried most of it...I honestly like it all. Personal favorites are the pork tenderloin sandwich, chicken cordon bleu, and gyro. Definitely recommended if you're looking for something quick and easy, and the friendly staff is also a nice bonus."}
{"text":"Sandwiches were ok, nothing special. Prices were fair but no deal for chips and drink combo? Went later in the evening and there was only 1 person working there."}
{"text":"These other reviews make it sound horrible. Owner is very friendly. I had the Chicago gyro special. It was delicious. I could knit pick about the size and freshness. But for $4 it was a damn good gyro. If I was super hungry they would added more filling if I asked I'm  sure. I could have also ordered another, and probably still been cheaper than a gyro combo down the street. The menu has a lot to offer. I look forward to trying more here in the future."}
{"text":"Excellent sandwiches.  They always put a ton of meat and toast it perfectly. My favorite is the Reuben. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"For the price point, I'm giving sliced 4 stars. Two of us ordered a caprese sandwich with added fried chicken, mozzarella sticks, a Cuban and curly fries- all for less than $20.  Service wasn't the quickest and it wasn't the best sandwich ever... but for made to order sandwiches at a low price point that's very casual - it did the job. Wouldn't be first choice for most things, but if you're driving by and in need of a sandwich, worth it."}
{"text":"We've been going here 1-2 times a week since we discovered it. Quality ingredients, great bread, amazing prices, a drive thru - it can't be beat! My personal fav is the turkey rueben but everything we have had has been excellent. My very picky son scarfs down the chicken dumpling soup."}
{"text":"Food is always fresh and hot. They are always friendly and work hard to provide a mom and pop feel to each transaction."}
{"text":"Went here today to get something quick to eat through the drive through as we were a bit hungry.  We knew the Arby's was \"updated\" and wanted to try it. 

First, the drive through order taker was rude, and in a hurry eventhough we've never seen the menu before, and there were no other cars waiting. 

Once we got to the window , they took our payment, didn't even bother saying \"hello\"...which was fine.

But then, the food took over 10 minutes to get to us. I ordered a hot dog, with ketchup and relish. She asked me if I want ketch up as she handed me to the order through the window. I said \"is it already on the hotdog\"? she said \"no, that's why I am asking if you want it\"...a bit rude, but ok, I said, sure, then I will have some thinking it comes in a packet on the side.

We pull the food out later, the hotdog had ketchup, and the bag was full of little ketchup packets. 

The food tasted pretty bland. Just like how the place, service and menu felt. 

It's like the place is trying to be a cross between Arby's and Panera. It isn't accomplishing either one. 

If you like decent tasting food and generally decent customer service, I would stay away."}
{"text":"My first time to be in here, love their sandwiches and soups! We had chicken cordon  bleu and beef brisket sandwiches, both are very tasty! Also had beef barley soup and chicken wild rice soup. we  both liked it very much! will be back for
Sure!"}
{"text":"Pretty basic food items.  The beef brisket was flavorful, I would recommend getting a side of the horseradish sauce.  The mozzarella sick were decent.  The meatball sandwich was also void, although a bit small. 

The prices are a bit higher than I would normally pay for what you get, but there may be some potential going forward. 

Although the bathrooms were obviously older and well used, they were clean."}
{"text":"Former Arby's being slowly converted to an Arby's Plus.

I'm not kidding.  The owner is the former Arby's franchisee who got tired of the business model and wanted to make some changes that Ryan at Corporate (The Office reference) wouldnt let him.  So far, other than the name and signage, the changes are subtle but promising.

Menu still has most of the Arby's staples (I am told, I was and am not a frequent Arby's customer) but they have switched to bread baked fresh daily and better quality meats, and the prices have all been lowered slightly.

Notable additions include: gyros with real lamb, hot dogs, brats, pulled pork, pork tenderloin, and a build your own sandwich option.  They also have regular (non curly fries) which I'm not sure if Arby's offered.  The employees tell me they like the new fries better.

At the recommendation of the owner and several employees I tried a pulled pork sandwich, a reuben, and fries.

Pulled pork sandwich was either impressive for fast food or disappointing for BBQ.  On the small side, but only $2.99.  Both sweet and mustardy but no real smoke flavor.  Really, the most disappointing thing was the appearance, it still looked like a fast food sandwich, but tasted better.  Could really have benefited by being topped with either cole slaw (carolina style) or pickles.

It's been a while since I had an Arby's Reuben, but they werent kidding about the meat and bread improvements.  Definitely a more substantial sandwich.  Could stand for it to be a little bigger for $4.99.  My biggest grievance was that the bread wasnt toasted/grilled.  Isnt that a requirement for a reuben?  I will definitely be bringing this up on my next visit.  Maybe they dont have a grill yet.  Overall I was pretty pleased with the reuben,

Fries were more substantial than the average fast food fries, but nothing too special about them.

So far they havent changed the inside decor from Arby's, and other than maybe adding more comfortable booths/chairs I hope they dont.  That particular Arby's was one of the few fast food restaurants that you could sit down and eat in without feeling like the decor was designed to rush you back out as quickly as possible.

Summary:  Slight step up from Arby's and regular fast food.  If they can make the step less slight without raising prices I'll be a regular customer.  As it stands, Madison has better deli/sandwich shops, but none cheap/convenient, especially as a westsider.  I'll be watching this place with interest."}
{"text":"I am not a review writing kind of guy. However, I downloaded Yelp for the sole purpose of writing a review on Sliced Deli in Madison. Today was my third visit in about 2 weeks. The first time I went there, the owners only employee had called in sick and he was stuck running the show. THIS MAN IS A FORCE TO BE RECKONED WITH (in a good way)!!! Not only did he manage to do all the cooking and order taking and money handling, but he also did it with a kind, friendly, and calm demeanor the entire time. As if that weren't enough, he also managed to thank everyone that walked out of the store and rang the bell. The bell is there for customers to acknowledge that they enjoyed the food and/or service. Jump to today. As I sat in the sunroom enjoying my gyro, I realized that I had to make it known to the world how amazingly different and delicious this particular item was! This is the only gyro I have ever purchased that did not come with a cup of sauce. Usually, one must put the sauce on manually. It's usually not enough sauce and doesn't spread well. But the one from Sliced, the one from Sliced... They put the sauce directly on the sandwich for you. Simple as this may sound, it makes a huge difference! The sauce melted quickly because of the warm lamb, causing it to spread more evenly across the sandwich. So instead of the usual clumps of sauce here and there, I had sauce with pretty much every bite! And that sauce is the main reason I like gyros! As long as the choice is mine to make, I will not choose to buy a gyro anywhere else! In addition, the meat and veggies, even the bread (pita this time)- all are fresh! I mean really fresh! In fact, all 3 times I've been here, every ingredient in every item was fresh... Finally, if you miss Arby's curly fries, fear not- Sliced purchases the exact same fries from the same distributor, and served them super fresh when I ordered them. I would argue they're better here. The owner used to own the Arby's franchise that occupied this building before Sliced did. He does an amazing job at everything he does. Great food, great service, welcoming atmosphere, nice sunroom and the best quality food you will find in a fast food type  restaurant. If you're thinking about fast food, PLEASE, PLEASE, PRETTY PLEASE, do yourself a huge favor and try Sliced Deli. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"After I had a coworker tell me to try Sliced Deli I finally had the chance today. Stopped in for a to-go order. Don't let the outside appearance or indoor decor fool you!! Kevin greeted me right away. After looking the menu over a bit I decided to try the Brisket sandwich. It was made fresh to order and didn't take all that long before I was on my way. The first bite and I was hooked! The meat was very tender, and had great flavor. Can't wait to try other items off the menu. (I would have added a photo but I ate it all before deciding to write the review)."}
{"text":"Food was super fresh. Service is friendly. Locally owned and operated so that's great too-you can tell by the care put into the food and cleanliness of the establishment. I will be back when looking for a hot quick sandwich and fries! Price is also very good!"}
{"text":"Great selection overall. The Brisket Sandwich was definitely worth the $5 price. Great, tender meat overall with a nice addition of onion straws on the sandwich. The Gouda Cheese is a perfect complement. 

So happy they still have curly fries as a holdover from their Arby's days. I will definitely be back for a quick meal that is so much better than fast food places in general."}
{"text":"Had the Philly.   It was OK, but Philly is one of those things...once you've had the real deal.  So, I do plan on going back bc I would like this place to make it.   Drive thru was quick and friendly.   I wish there were choices for larger sammies like portillos, and also an Italian beef.  I want to try a cold sandwich next."}
{"text":"Gyro was good not freshly sliced but served to order. Prices are reasonable check out the drive through. Many options healthy! Large selection of soups!"}
{"text":"My friend and decided to give it a go even though the reviews were not that great. I completely agree that it's a Arby's plus! Nothing was exceptional. Then as I appalled at the fact that one of the workers was sitting in the drive through window. As I pulled around her bottom was hanging out the window!!"}
{"text":"You certainly cannot beat the $5.00 lunch special of a gyro sandwich and a medium drink. So why did I not order that? I was distracted by a big notice on the sandwich daily special board with \"Sandwich Cubano.\" I was making a quick boy-am-I-famished stop here, and boy did a Cuban Sandwich sound good. And boy, was it. They have a little hybrid self-service here where you order at the counter, sit down, and the friendly chef brings you your meal. The sandwich on arrival may have appeared small in the burger container it came in. But what it lacked in length, it made up for in height. It was packed with ham, cheese and fresh cooked pork, and mustard. It was delicious and filling. Perfect for a quick lunch. About $8.00 for sandwich and a drink, so a good value, too. Like a good deli, they have fantastic choices and fresh soups to accompany the sandwiches. I asked the owner if the $5.00 special changes daily. Most of the time it is a gyros, and maybe a French dip. In either case, a great value. Modest, fresh and flavorful fare with friendly and welcoming staff. I'm sure to be a regular."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a couple of times and have not been disappointed.  The sandwiches are good, with plenty enough to fill you and not empty your wallet.  The owner is actively involved in the day to day activities and it shows.  Would definitely recommend for anyone looking for a good, fresh and not too expensive lunch.  Beats the sub shops in town."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot! A big selection of sandwiches and polite service. Tried the Cubano, almost better than Miami's."}
{"text":"Don't judge a book by its cover! I have to admit that's exactly what I did with Sliced - being in an old Arby's location (and having some Arby's hallmarks like sandwiches and curly fries) didn't instill confidence in my westside drive-bys. After reading a bunch of wonderful reviews on Yelp, though, I decided to swing through the drive-thru one afternoon when I was famished. 

I opted for the smoked brisket sandwich and an order of curly fries. The curly fries are as you'd expect - crunchy, seasoned, and indistinguishable from what I remember of the Arby's brand. AKA: delicious. 

The brisket sandwich was much higher quality that I expected. The brisket appeared to be freshly sliced off an actual cut of beef. There was a bit more fat than I personally prefer, but it wasn't overwhelming by any means. The gouda, barbecue, and onion straws came together perfectly to make a delicious sandwich on a soft bun. 

On another visit I had the curly fries, a chocolate shake, and the turkey reuben with cheddar instead of Swiss. Curly fries were dropped fresh, and the sandwich was tasty. The thousand island seemed house made, and the sandwich had a good sour kick - I couldn't tell if it was from the sauerkraut or the pickles in the dressing. Either way, I dug it. The bread was very pillowy with a good rye flavor. 

I'd advise skipping the chocolate shake - it was super icy and tasted of chocolate syrup. I'd prefer a creamier and more natural tasting take. I had been excited to try that caramel shake, but it appears they've nixed that from the menu, at least for now. 

The interior is pretty much how I'd imagine an Arby's would look. Prepare to wait a bit more than you would for fast food. Staffing is minimal and both in the drive-thru and when going inside it took around ten minutes. I don't mind the wait since we saw on our inside visit that everything was made to order. The prices and building suggest fast food, but the quality is striving for a step above."}
{"text":"Went here for a quick dinner because I had never heard of it, so why not. I was very happy with what I found! This place has good quality meat (had the French dip and the chicken salad sandwich) as well as a lot of soup options. The staff was very friendly and attentive. I'm already planning on going back and trying my all time favorite sandwich, the Rueben. Stay tuned for that review!"}
{"text":"Very decent Freshly made sandwiches, and very decently priced. Shared the homemade chicken salad sandwich and turkey sandwich with side of fries. The homemade chicken salad was very good, you could tell it was freshly made chunky style and had a very good sauce but not too saucy, I was impressed especially for the price! turkey sandwich was good too and the fries were hand cut thick and good as well. For sure will order from again"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Sliced Deli. I ordered the hot dog along with some mozzarella sticks and broccoli cheddar soup and a philly cheese steak sandwich. It was the best meal I have had in awhile! The mozzarella sticks were awesome!, the hot dogs and soup were delicious as well. My co-worker who had the philly cheese steak sandwich said it was great as well. I will definitely be back.... Probably later today for dinner. Amazing! Awesome food!"}
{"text":"Really good food for reasonable prices. I've been here a few times, and I have always been content with the service and the quality of the food. Don't let looks deceive you--it looks like a mere fast food place (I think it used to be an Arby's), and there is often only one man in the kitchen (I believe it's the owner), but every occasion I've ordered I have been impressed! It seems like the owner really cares about his business. I will be happy to continue trying new menu items and I urge you to give it a try."}
{"text":"Was craving a Reuben after St Patrick's day. Where to go to get one quick, while I was out for errands on a Saturday afternoon? Did a drive through at Sliced. I was out in less than five minutes and my sandwich was hot and tasted like real food. Better than I'd get at a fast food drive-through and probably a dollar or two cheaper! The cashier was friendly and courteous. Will stop again!"}
{"text":"That last thing that comes to mind when going for fast food is fresh yet this is exactly what this  establishment provides. The quality of ingredients is simply fantastic. I need to know where they get their tomato from because a quality tomato in Wisconsin in February is simply legendary! 

At first the price did seem high (sometimes I forget I'm on the West Side), however, the execution, accuracy, and quick delivery (& the already mentioned quality of ingredients) did not disappoint. For a speedy and cheap lunch option on the West Side this spot has the market cornered! Definitely recommend on initial impressions & I will be back!"}
{"text":"Had my first sandwich here today and it will not be my last!  Went through the drive through, service was quick and friendly.  I ordered the smoke brisket - wow was it good.  The meat was very tender and the sauce complimented the sandwich very well.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I really wanted this place to be as awesome as it could be.  I was figuring \"Arby's, but even better\" (I like me some Arby's).  Standing inside looking at the menu boards, my mouth was watering.  There's a vast selection of great deli classics - reuben, pulled pork, gyro, french dip, philly, and a build-your-own sandwich option.  After some hemming and hawing, I selected the philly (minus peppers).  My friend ordered the sandwich of the day (chicken) with his choice of bread & cheese.  We both ordered french fries.

As I waited for my sandwich, I was informed that getting it without peppers was tough, since it's a \"philly topping\" and that's how it comes (peppers & onions mixed).  Well, the gig was up - all I heard was \"philly in a can\".  I figured I'd stick to the order and pick off the peppers.  No worries.  When I got the sandwich back to the table, it was a bit of a greasy mess.  No utensils provided, so all my work was by hand.  The taste was okay, but it fell below expectations.  I though the roast beef was an upgrade to the Arby's meats - that's a plus.  The cheese was just the basic Arby's cheese sauce used on their beef n' cheddar.   The fries were okay.  No salt or pepper  was available in the seating area, and ketchup was only in packets.

Staff was friendly enough, but all I could see was their disorganization.  Either they don't have it together, or they are still working on it.  They better figure it out fast.

The prices seem decent until you realize it's all a la carte.  So $4.99 for the sandwich, $1.75 for fries, and a drink if you want it (i took the glass of water).  You can easily get upward around $9 for your meal - I didn't think it deserved to be in that realm.

This place... this concept... has so much potential.  But without a good first impression, it will be hard to get customers to return."}
{"text":"Good prices, quality food - don't be fooled by the exterior. Used the drive thru. Friendly , will make the trip over here again just for this place !!"}
