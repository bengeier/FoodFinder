{"text":"Wow. Speechless. Food, drinks, service. We came in on a busy Friday night, no reservations. We were seated at the bar which is probably the best spot to be in anyways. We ordered a variety of rolls, not single one of them failed to blow my mind. The fish, so fresh, it melts in your mouth. The rice, which in my humble opinion is what makes a good sushi, is firm but not chewy. Just the way it should be. You can taste the freshness. Obviously l'm not a sushi expert by any means, but this place, just wow.  Highly, extremely recommended. Kudos to the team! Great work!"}
{"text":"Really great place in Corso Italia. Fish was fresh and everything was delicious. No issues with service. My husband has been here 3 times already.  For some strange reason, this place has the best tasting scallop hand roll I've ever eaten, and I eat a lot scallop. The scallop in their rolls taste softer and more buttery, and they put in large chunks instead of ground-up scallops that other places use.  And for the people below who had issue with the proprietors being Korean... So Akira Back of Akira Back is Korean, Jackie Lin of Shoushin is Chinese and the guy at Skippa is not even Asian and puts truffle oil on his nigiri. Clearly, good food is good food regardless of the ethnicity of the person making it."}
{"text":"I am over the moon about this place. It's a beautiful sushi restaurant that features a very good range of fish options and fresh, VERY good food. It's a bit pricey, but the quality is comparable to much more upscale places.   The place was kind of busy, considering it's Good Friday, so reservations are recommended."}
{"text":"Disappointing. Presentation wise, the sushi that cost $9 per piece were more presentable compared to my Omakase. As the other reviewer said, even when I didn't add too much soya sauce, I am still very thirsty.  It's difficult to get water here. Trying to get water, you have to ask several times. I suggest they invest in bottles similar to the korean restaurants and place water on the table if they are short staffed.   No liquor licenses yet. No sake. For this price, service and quality, many other options to chose from."}
{"text":"I had a really good time. For 2 people, ordered sushi saiko ($25), Aji negi ($6), and Madai shiso ($7). All were so good and we became full! The restaurant is new and clean, servers and chefs are nice.   We really liked their wasabi. It's completely different from cheap tubed wasabi you usually see in most of casual-ish sushi restaurants.  We were at the counter seats and talking about how good the wasabi is though it's powdered (still best quality, the chef said). Then the chef, Mr. Kim suddenly gave us another kind of wasabi, saying it's freshly grated and showed us the wasabi stick. I liked both powdered and grated but it was nice to have a chat with the chef over the counter.  I've been to some other sushi restaurants with about the same price or more expensive in Toronto. Shunoko is the best so far. Everything other customers ordered looked so nice such as Hand roll, Chirashi, Gindara miso. I will come back to try them!"}
{"text":"We love this new restaurant! It has been open for just about 3 months, and is a great place that caters to a wide variety of people - whether for takeout, sushi rolls and sashimi sets, or omakase.  I went in a party of 3, and we all love going for Japanese omakase. Our favourite spot has traditionally been Yasu and the occasional trip to Kaji, Zen, and Shoushin, but we will definitely be adding Shunoko to our list of favourites.  We tried the omakase for $90 pp, which came with 14 pieces of nigiri served Jiro Dreams of Sushi style (counter, served one at a time), house salad, sunomono salad, miso soup, and ice cream. Of all the omakase visits we've had, this is definitely the best value. The fish they have is very unique and interesting, with some varieties that we've never had before. Some of the highlights were the wild rock porgy (great buttery firm texture), stripejack belly, wild Japanese half beak, pacific herring (my least favourite because it had a very soft texture and many small bones). In addition, each of the toppings on the nigiri are housemade and carefully curated to really bring out the flavour of the fish. For example, the umeboshi (pickled plum) is done in house, there are interesting toppings such as shiso leaf flower (a tiny delicate purple flower), Japanese pepper leaf, and ground chilli powder (which they take the chilli, dry it, and grind it). Additionally, even the sides were unique. Not only was there pickled ginger, but also pickled daikon, and a single piece of pickled lotus. The last dish, usually a single piece of tamago, was a warm dish of miso black cod, tamago, rice with Japanese rice topping, pickled mushrooms and burdock. It was a great finale to the entire experience. Dessert was a selection of ice cream flavours - taro, ginger, red bean, green tea, black sesame. Our favourite was the ginger, because it was not too sweet but it still had a strong yet balanced ginger flavour.  The experience was really fun, albeit a bit fast. I barely had time to sip my tea, cleanse my palate with some ginger, and eat my nigiri before the next one was placed in front of me. The service could also use some improvement. There were only two servers, and while both were extremely nice and welcoming, it seems like they are understaffed. It took us around 15 minutes to be seated despite arriving on time with our reservation, and another 5-10 minutes after we were seated to get some tea. The vibe is also a bit chaotic, with the two servers balancing the sushi bar, tables, and takeout, and the music was louder than expected.  Overall, it was a great experience and one of the best value omakase meals in Toronto. It is an accessible restaurant for all types of people and preferences, with the standard sushi restaurant rolls and menu items, along with high quality and inventive omakase experience. We'll be back for the omakase again!"}
{"text":"Five stars for this newly opened sushi joint! They offer a wide selection of fish like shima aji (striped jack) and suzuki (sea bass) that most sushi restaurants do not offer, all at a reasonable price. There are even some varieties that are flown in from Tsukiji Market in Tokyo.   I would recommend getting the sushi Saiko (nigiri platter) which is 9 pieces with a spicy salmon roll, or omakase and Ã  la carte if you want to splurge and indulge even more!  Sushi Shunoko is newly renovated with gorgeous sushi bar seats and tables, which give you an authentic Japanese experience. Moreover, the sushi chef James was very nice! I would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"I tried this place for lunch. There are a few lunch specials but it's not their long suit. Check out the roll with toaster coconut and the vegetarian roll with mushrooms in it. They dont bring you soy sauce except on request. Sunce many rolls don't need it. It's too bad they were out of ginger ice cream on the day I went; I guess I'll have to go back."}
{"text":"Quality of fish is great! Bright clean space. Service can be slow when it's busy, but they're aware and will do what they can to make you comfortable as you wait. You have to get their sesame creme brulee."}
{"text":"Pretty close to a 5*, but no LLBO though and I'm not sure whether or not it's coming.  However, the interior lends itself to want you to enjoy the food with some kinda alcoholic bevvy!  I've been looking forward to this restaurant opening as I would go to their original location, Nomi in Roncesvalles, whenever I was in the area.  Not sure why they renamed the restaurant though.  Anyway, the entire restaurant has been renovated.  It is bright, airy, and modern.  Restaurant is medium-sized, including a long sushi bar with seating.  It's at least twice the size of Nomi.  Menu is more extensive and can be seen here, with pricing: https://www.shunoko.com/menu  Lotsa familiar menu items are carried over from Nomi.  In addition, they offer omakase as well for $90.  Fish is very fresh, as per the other reviewers, it's flown in from a fish market in Japan.  What stands out about Shunoko though is VARIETY.  There is soo much variety in the fish that they serve, so you won't get salmon, salmon, and more salmon in 1 set!  Highly recommended for any sushi lover!"}
{"text":"Came to try out this sushi restaurant after they closed Nomi on Roncy. Ordered their fancy chirashi, and omakase. Fish was delicious fresh. You don't need to use their home made soy sauce much. Decent portions, and fair price for what you are getting - since it isn't your typical salmon and butter fish. Reserve ahead of time, as I was told my wait would be 40min when I walked in. Street parking is convenient, but I would rather take the TTC to avoid trying to find a spot. Staff was friendly, and informed us on each type of fish when they brought it over. Will definitely go back"}
{"text":"Took our staff here for lunch this past Friday. Food was outstanding, great attentive service and really interesting decor.  So happy that Shunoko has opened here... much needed relief in an area with few decent options! We ordered a number of appetizers and maki rolls, all were superb. My favourite was the \"Dynamite Dynamite\" roll. The \"Fish Balls\" are also a must try."}
{"text":"I really wanted to give a 3.5.    Service was a zero. Food was  9/10, very very good. English must have been her 19th language.  I asked for extra wasabi and she brought me a boiling cup of water.  Not exaggerating.  Have a good one."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi in Toronto and some of the best I've ever had. I highly recommend the spicy crunchy coconut rolls. But honestly, it was all elegant, refined, delicious!"}
{"text":"i'm not a sushi connoisseur, but i've been to a few good sushi places in my life. shunoko is the real deal.   the rice is spot on. the fish is very fresh and expertly prepared. the variety puts 99% of the sushi joints in toronto to shame.   the decor is clean and modern. service is good.  i'd come back in a heartbeat and recommend this place to anybody."}
{"text":"This new sushi joint has great ambiance and good food, but the service is lacking.  I stopped by on a Friday evening for dinner. The inside of the restaurant is nicely decorated. It has a sleek, laid-back, open feel - lots of wood, exposed ceiling beams, and big windows. It's not too large, but it's big enough not to feel claustrophobic. It definitely filled up as it got later into the evening - I wouldn't have gotten a table if I hadn't arrived early.  I ordered the sushi saiko, which is 9 different kinds of nigiri plus a spicy tuna roll. All of the sushi was good, but it felt a bit lacking versus other sushi I've had in the GTA. It's hard to say what was missing - it just wasn't as fresh, didn't have as much oomph to the flavor. The meal also came with miso soup and a side salad - they were both fine, but not remarkable.  The most disappointing part of the experience was the service. I had to ask multiple times just to get soy sauce and more water. I never got the green tea I requested. The servers felt stretched very thin, always frantically running about. Perhaps they're understaffed, or they weren't expecting so many people that night.  The restaurant has some promise, so I hope they do well. But they'll need to up their game on service and quality for me to want to return."}
{"text":"Easily the best sushi I have had in Toronto. Everything was 10/10. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Had reservations for Friday night and waited for an hour for our food to arrive. 2 other tables also waited over an hour for their food and one table actually left because they didnt get their food. Many people complained about the long waits. We had to ask for tea after sitting down for 30mins. Constant reminder to refill teas. Maybe because they just opened so servers are not as experience. The chef and servers spoke Korean. The sushi is pretty good like a 4 stars, lots variety of different sashimi."}
{"text":"This is the evolution of Sushi Nomi. The original spot was a super small take out counter at the base of Roncesvalles.  It had it's following and a constant flow of people purchasing their platters and maki sets.  It was one of the rare places where you can find interesting fish beyond the typical tuna, salmon, and red snapper AND it didnt cost you a fortune.  I've read the other reviews for Shunoko and I understand there are 2 issues that have been shared.  One of them is embarrassing for the yelp reviewers saying that this place isnt good cause they're not Japanese.  ...REALLY?  I honestly believe good food is not strictly belonging to one race or background.  It doesnt matter if the owners or servers are not Japanese.  If they show respect, care, and skill for the craft and recipes... does it matter if they are of a different heritage?  Some of the best sushi chef in Toronto are not Japanese but studied in Japan or with a Japanese Sushi master. I'm sure whoever taught them decided the person is far more important than where they came from.  Ok... off that soapbox and onto the good stuff.  This new spot on St.Clair is quite a bit bigger than the previous spot.  It has at least 10 tables of varying sizes in addition to the sushi bar in front of the chef.  It is quite spacious and if they really wanted to, they could squeeze in a few more tables. Thankfully they didnt and they let the minimalist zen like decor also be held in the atmosphere.  Soft jazz plays in the background which just adds to a nice soothing night.  I highly recommend doing reservations.  When I was there, it was a constant line up of walk ins hoping for a table.    As for the service, we lucked out and it was very good.  There was the primary hostess who also did triple duty as main waitress and food runner.  SHE WAS BUSY but she also super sweet, thoughtful, and attentive.  She either cleaning, speaking to different tables, or checking in on those who already received their dishes.  There were a few others helping but no one was the star player like her.    Their menu is easy to read but definitely ask for the daily specials.  They regularly have fish flown in from Tsukiji Market in Tokyo.  Sometimes they'll have a lot of varieties and they're so unique to 95% of what Toronto sushi spots offer.  The night I was there, they had at least 6 different fishes that are not commonly served and fresh from Japan.  For us, we kept it simple and decided on their sashimi set in the menu and some of their more creative rolls.  Sashimi B set - For only $35, this sashimi set has 24 pieces of 12 different fish.  That is so rare in Toronto.  Usually they'll only say 7 types of fish ... 8 if you're lucky.  So when this platter arrived on the table, it was beautiful.  Not only were the slices clean and well portioned, the colours and different sauces they added to the fish were just a great touch.  We were also blessed to see we got 30 pieces of 15 different fish! This was just unexpected and we were very grateful to try even more.  Of the 15, only 5 were common (salmon sake, tuna maguro, fluke hirame, black sea bream kurodai, and yellowtail hamachi).  We also got sea bass, spanish mackerel, horse mackerel, red sea bream, striped jack, amber jack ... and others I can't even remember.  Many of the fishes were really good.  Some were supple and smooth... others were meaty and had a rich bold flavour.  There was only one was just a bit unusual for me.  I never knew a fish could be crunchy.  Not my favourite but appreciated that I got to try it.  I loved this set especially for the price point.  Just well done overall. 4.5/5  Coconut Spicy tuna roll - This was a fun and interesting roll.  If you love textures, this one you'd might like a lot.  It has finely minced tuna in a mild spicy sauce with avocado.  Then it is finely rolled up altogether and then covered in crispy popped rice and roasted coconut flakes.  The added crisp and crunchy pieces kept it interesting.  Flavour wise, I liked how their spicy tuna wasn't mayo filled but the roasted coconut was distractedly sweet.  I'm not sure the added sweetness worked for me.  3.5/5   Afterflood roll - This is a solid choice for anyone who likes maki rolls.  Filled with asparagus, cucumber, creamy avocado, and spicy crab, it's then topped with 7 types of fish and avocado.  It is a pretty looking roll with lots of colour and the addition of the green onion.  It's not as spicy as the spicy tuna filling... just a hint of spice.  I think this worked well overall.  4/5  I think Shunoko continues on Sushi Nomi's reputation of offering a lot of variety, good quality sushi and sashimi for a reasonable price.  I found the service to be really nice and personable.  I would recommend this spot to anyone who loves sushi or is just starting to explore different types of fish beyond the typical. I'll definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Before I ate here, I thought the reviews were promising, the price is good, and the food looks good.    But now I have to go against the flow.  Ordered sushi saiko ($25).  The sushi came on a plate, looks exactly like what other people ordered.  The fish looks fresh, that's why it got two stars.  But the rice was super hard, and most importantly, it was not seasoned properly. I couldn't taste any vinegar at all.  The wasabi on the side is powered stuff.  Of course, I cannot expect a plate of $25 sushi would give me real wasabi, but this place also has omakase that charges $90 so I hope at that price, the wasabi is at least real one.  After I got home, I was super thirsty whole night. I did not use too much soy sauce on the sushi and I have no idea why.   Sorry I won't come back here.  Also the traffic in this area is like hell.    Also it's not too important but I believe this place is run by Koreans."}
{"text":"Seated for 15 mins, didnt event get a cup of tea. Its Thursday 8pm, its not that busy, dont understand why. Very disappointed."}
