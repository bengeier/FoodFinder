{"text":"Cannot say enough good things about this place! 

Called ahead to see their hours and even though they were closing we were told they would stay open for us. Once we got there, our server/chef Sayyid made us feel extremely welcome. 

Both entrees came with complimentary goat broth soup, though I didn't try it (I don't eat goat) my boyfriend said it was great. I got the chicken stew and it was an extremely generous portion and the sauce was flavorful but not overly spicy. My boyfriend got the king fish and highly enjoyed it as well. Both dishes came with rice and potatoes, both of which were really well seasoned.

We were in Toronto for vacation but will definitely be back next time we're in town."}
{"text":"This is by far one of my fav restaurants in the city. To be fair, I've been coming here since they served the sport dish in their traditional way, without cutlery. So much fun! 

They've gone through a lot of changes in their decor (yes, you walk into an Internet cafe before you enter the dining room) & they painted over my majestic cheetah on the wall but the food is unwavering. You'll never get the same meal twice. 

The meals are cooked with love by their kind owner. When I was a meat eater, the roasted goat and stew chicken sport dish was my pick but now veg is still a great option! Served with an overwhelming portion of rice, the tastiest soup to start (goat broth is its base), the best hot sauce in the city and a refreshing mango or watermelon freshie (Somalian Kool-Aid?) for $10 or less per person and you're laughing. The dishes increase with the size of your party. Sport dish for 1, 2, 3, etc. The bigger the party, the cost goes down per diner!

Go during Ramadan or Eid for even more delicious desserts and snacks to accompany your dish free of charge, just so you can in on the festivities too.

CNN on the tv and not the greatest ambiance (Regent Park) but I wouldn't change a thing. Once you go Somalian, you won't go back. Yummmmm!"}
{"text":"Now, I like my fine dining and all, but there's no denying that some of the BEST meals around are procured from tiny, unsuspecting, mom and pop food joints.

New Bilan is one of those spots.  Serving the finest of Somalian stews on large share plates with either rice or chapatti (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapatti), this diamond in the rough will fill you up and put you right to bed - every time, all the time.

Inconspicuously located at the South East corner of Dundas and Jarvis, New Bilan scores a flat out ZERO on aesthetic.  It doesn't even really look like a restaurant.  When you walk in the front door, you're actually inside an internet spot.  A few steps to the left, and then you're in the eatery, which feels slightly reminiscent of a small community centre cafeteria.

You're greeted by cheap linoleum flooring, a cash-only register, the same dining furniture that my parents had when they moved to Canada and those uncomfortable yet extremely practical plastic table cloths covers.

As you scan the room, you inevitably debate a quick pivot step out the front door and an effortless stroll down to Salad King (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/salad-king-restaurant-toronto).  But it's at this exact moment, that the clouds part and a little ray of sunshine lands itself gently on the free, self-serve dispenser of New Bilan's glorious ginger tea.  It's all gravy from here on in.

You can sip on this soothing - yet spicy - tea while you place your order with the waitress.  On your first trip, I'd suggest the standard Chicken Stew on Rice, with a Chapatti on the side.  It's a big meal, so bring your appetite or bring a friend!  Truthfully, New Bilan is always best with at least a few friends huddled around a big stainless steel share plate.

It generally takes a bit of time for your meal to arrive, but more treats appear in the meanwhile.  New Bilan's spicy soup with a nasal-clearing hot chutney is first.  It's fantastic.  It would take a well trained taste-bud to decipher the ingredients or base of this soup, but rest assured, it's the real deal.

Your meal will come out steaming hot, and as if you don't already feel like royalty, they treat you and yours to free pitcher of watermelon juice or mango nectar.  Zing!

When you're done, you'll either curl into the fetal position and pass out on the linoleum - which somehow feels like the foot of your mother's bed by now - or you'll grab another cup of ginger tea, pay the $10 you owe (not bad eh?) and be on your way.

The amenities aren't the best, the service isn't all there either, but if you're looking to resurrect your palette and enjoy a sweet post-meal nap, you've come to the right internet spot -- I mean restaurant."}

{"text":"Somalian meal is a new venture for me outside of Moroccan, Ethiopian, or Tunisian. I've been surprised by some African flavours before and I'm more than willing to go to the sketchiest parts of Toronto to further my search for memorable meals. The fact is if I don't give it a try, I would never know on a personal level what I am missing or what I should be missing furthermore.

If you're looking for a date spot, this is far from it.
If you're looking for a fullhouse hip-happening space, nope.
If you're looking for East African Somalian food/takeout, this could be it.

Empty was the space with some aspects of African in the decor but it seems like work-in-progress. The Menu is minimal which makes it easy to select from. Goat Meat, Chicken Steak, Chicken Stew, King Fish, Beef Stew, Vegetarian. All equal or less than $9.99 no complains for a well portioned meal.

Dishes served with either Rice, Chipatti or Spaghetti, including Tea, Mango or Water Melon drinks. The extremely happy friendly limited chit-chat lone waiter/cook didn't really speak of the side choices and I didn't request miscellaneous choices so what came was Rice and Watermelon drink which by no means are impressive. Simply Rice and Watermelon drink that doesn't taste like much and looked Kool-aid like.

The Goat Broth Soup arrived first, seems a standard mirepoix stock with some specks most likely of Goat but no Goat gaminess at all. Hot Soup, good starter no complains.

Beef Stew didn't really have any enticing flavours which reminds me of my previous Ethiopian mush purees The Chicken Steak was same flavourless and was cooked to Jerky consistency maybe that's the intent traditional cooking style, I wouldn't know.

I would say the value of the meal is there, but as I see Take-out after Take-out being bagged and taken away. I'm sure its popular to the African ethnicity's but I only really liked the Spice Tea and the Hot Sauce. The Spice Tea is really reminiscent of Korean Cinnamon Tea while Hot Sauce being Spicy Tomatillo Salsa."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic.  Best Somalian cuisine since I lived in Yemen.  Great little restaurant.  Amazing owner.  And don't get me started on the food.  OUFF I am satisfied and then some."}
{"text":"I'm really surprised this place doesn't have more reviews. I was in the area, so my girlfriend picked up lunch here and it was $10 flat for each of us. I had the chicken steak, which came with rice. My girlfriend had the chicken stew, which came with rice and potatoes. They forgot the potatoes with mine, but that's okay because the portions of what I did get were pretty generous.. I was afraid the chicken might be dry on first look, but it was moist and cooked perfectly. The rice was simple but delicious. Chicken was good, rice was good, price was good, portion was good. 

The only hang-up about it was that it looks very run down from the outside, so much so you might think it was out of business. But that's a small thing compared to how great the food is. 

Please eat here, or give me money so I can keep eating here."}
