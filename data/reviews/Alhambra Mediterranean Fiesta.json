{"text":"Back in Oakville to visit good friends, we were looking for something a bit different and discovered Alhambra Mediterranean Fiesta on Lakeshore just east of Bronte.  Located in a strip mall, the decor both internally and externally were nothing to write home about, but I am certainly glad we didn't judge this book by its cover...  Our party of eight (4 adults, 4 young teens) started off with 2 tapas platters: the croquet consisting of some of the most flavorful coconut shrimp, bastia, falafel, and maftoul cigars; and the vegetarian tapas for the kids consisting of Moroccan zalouk, baba ganoush, hummus, steamed fava beans, and stuffed grape leaves.  The appetizers were portioned perfectly for a hungry but not famished party of 8 and were cooked with an authenticity that burst with flavor and texture.  For the main, I enjoyed fall off the bone braised lamb tajine - a slow cooked stew spiced with saffron, turmeric, cumin, pepper, and raselhanut - a traditional 12 spice mix - served with saffron rice.    For dessert, a serving of oranges, dates, almonds served with a rose water cinnamon sauce capped our dinner with a perfectly not to sweet dish, washed down with a great Moroccan coffee.  A family run business, the owners are friendly, engaging, and take pride in their cooking.  The food is all very well priced for value with no sacrifice in quality.  I would recommend this restaurant to those who are less interested in looks and more interested in great authentic North African eats."}
{"text":"Another great place in Bronte Village. Ate their twice, had something different both times, and truly great mix of flavours.  Not sure what others say about service, but both times we sat near the front and just talked to the owner/chef as he prepared our meal. I have no idea about the menu, just talked about what we like, and he said don't worry and did his own thing, always find it the best way to eat out. Must say, both times were different and equally delicious. Now this place and Lakeside Eatery just down the street, Bronte Village is complete."}
{"text":"As decent as the food was at this place it has since closed.  You'll need to find authentic tagine elsewhere."}
{"text":"Want to take a trip to Morocco? Go to Alhambra! I was disappointed in the last Middle Eastern restaurant that I went to; however Alhambra surely pleased not only the taste buds but also the overall experience from service right down to the food.  We first started out with the Batista, which is a crispy phylo-like ground meat stuffed pastry with a creamy garlic and hot sauce. Following our appetizer we shared a lamb tagine. A tagine is a dish that is traditional to Moroccan cooking and typically is cooked slowly with a choice of.meat such as lamb or chicken and a rich medley of vegetables such as carrots, artichokes, fava beans, onions and tomatoes.  To cap it off, we ordered Turkish coffees which similarly represented a very rich espresso.Alhambra is recommended for the tasty traveler who wants to devour ethnic Moroccan cuisine right in their own backyard.  3 stars for great service, but minus 2 stars for the waitress being the only service lady there, which I'm assuming is due to the restaurants size. Understanding the dynamics of a structured system, functionality and efficiency; having an additional waiter/waitress might have sped up service by 5% which can diminish the antsy feeling one gets for waiting for delicious ethnic meals. Other than that, this place is worth a try at least once if your ever in the Bronte/Oakville area."}
{"text":"I took a trip to a far away land... Oakville, that's what people call it. I decided I might as well go even farther away.... to the Mediterranean. Alhambra Mediterranean Fiesta.  Now I know for certain my Friend has finicky needs for vibes. She's been to one too many Mediterranean/African restaurants. I on the other hand quite like the decor even if it doesn't transport you to another mystical land.  BBQ Calamari Al Andalusia ($11.95) - Points for color contrast, now take it away for portion/value/flavour. - Although the housemade hot sauce was served, but too little too late.  Fiesta Royale ($39.95) - I was okay with the portion of this, I just had to portion control myself. - If I were to order again, I would not opt for the platter but go regular. - Dry meats dragged down the whole platter, otherwise Lamb was good.  The restaurant had quite a crowd on a weeknight.  Great potential. For now, this man from another land will stay with east-end Mediterranean."}
{"text":"Whenever we go there, excellent food quality, modest setting, great couscous Royal, it comes with AMAZING sausage, chicken, lamb chops and veggies...I like the Moroccan tea from the pot and they have a dessert like orange slices topped with chopped almond in warm syrup with cinnamon....great end of a great meal."}
{"text":"Started with the Bastia.  Phylo pastry \"samosa\" that is stuffed with chicken, almonds, saffron and served with a fig jam sprinkled with cinnamon and powdered sugar.    My main was the Merguez Tajine - a savoury stew of Tunisian lamb sausage, artichoke, peppers, fava beans, olives, apricots, raisins, nuts, saffron and something called a \"rasalhanut au jus\" broth but I call liquid love!  Put me in the awkward position of wanting to lick my plate clean in front of work colleagues.  Finished off with a traditional Morrocan mint tea that was the perfect lunch digestif!  Will remind you of the food at the Sultan's Tent and Morrocan Cafe on Front Street near St. Lawrence Market.  This food is top notch and not some also-ran shwarma shop (of which O-ville has enough)."}
{"text":"I was excited when I am browsing the website of Alhambra looking at all the beautiful photos of well prepared food and was looking forward to an awesome dinner of Northern African food... I was a little disappointed maybe I have too high of an expectations?   Alhambra is located in a strip mall in the Bronte Village closed by the lake in Oakville. This place does give me a feel of eating at a fast food place or one of the chain restaurants... so don't expect really exotic decorations that has a really Mediterranean vibes.   Prices point wise, from glancing the menu seems to be similar to most of the other Northern African restaurants I been to. I let my Yelp Friend order as I was hungry and ready to eat anything even lamb....   BBQ Calamari Al Andalusia ($11.95)  - Where is the Calamari?? Oh those 2 little piece just slightly bigger than a loonie were the calamari.... Maybe the baby calamari are more tender? I tried to eat that slowly... really slowly..........  - Tons of veggies marinated in a Shermoula sauce does give it a really lemony taste  - light and refreshing... really light...   Fiesta Royale ($39.95)  - supposed to serves 2 or more and comes with a large Salad and I have no doubt that my Yelp friend can just finish that by himself and still have room for dessert.......  - Moroccan seasoned couscous served with oven roasted chicken, lamb tajine, spicy mergeuz sausage and Tunisian style root vegetables  - Alhambra salad is really a house salad that has a citrus pomegranate dressing which is quite refreshing, a little sour for my taste  - The chicken was too dry, the sausage were overcooked  - The whole dish was just a little bland tasting until our waitress remember bring us the house made hot sauce!!   Our waitress was really nice, but it was hard when she was the only one that covering the whole restaurant. Service was a little slow, the food took awhile to be served... so don't dine in when you are in a rush!   Alhambra Mediterranean Fiesta is a good alternative restaurant for the Oakville area but I found when compared to other I been to, it is lacking the spice and that authenticity."}
