{"text":"Unblurred is a monthly gallery crawl along Penn Avenue. There's lots to see and experience, there are gallery openings, live music, glass blowing demonstrations and much more.   The galleries are edgy and hip. It's fun to walk along and take it all in. I've gone several times and there is always something new."}
{"text":"Participated in the unblurred show last night.  If you haven't been, it's a 'first Friday' art event on Penn Avenue in the Garfield/Bloomfield neighborhood.  Includes the Night market--a collection of stalls selling everything from jewelry to really yummy looking pies and other food.  It's a great night of art, music, great people watching, and most importantly great community building.  Well worth the visit."}
{"text":"Unblurred is an art extravaganza that happens once a month (first Friday) in the Garfield section of the city. This crawl is hosted by a variety of artists and performers who open their doors to the public for views of their work. There's even a law office turned disco with a dj and empanadas. So many beautiful things for the eye to see while enjoying complimentary snacks and adult beverages. Some venues will have a donation jar out to help cover costs of refreshments. Art, music, friendship and more as you crawl down Penn Avenue. I think this is such a great time for locals and tourists alike."}
