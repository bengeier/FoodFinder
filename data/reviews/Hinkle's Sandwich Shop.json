{"text":"As a 20 year visitor to HInkle's, and probably the largest Hinkle's memorabilia owner on the West Coast I was let down last time we went in Sept 2016.   The reason why...Price almost doubled, and the service and quality is noticeably worse. The new buns or way they cook the buns is so far off what it used to be. And these burgers are tiny, why are they more than a regular sized McDonalds Cheeseburger. A normal guy, i used to get 4. On a late night after the bars, most of my buddies and i would get 6. Not any more. So the burgers aren't as great, again somethings different about the bun, and the Price almost doubled....oh and the service. The wait staff didn't have that many tables, and its small in there, so its not like you could have more than 4 tables per person. Slow service, and even if there was a waitress next to you and you wanted to pay or wanted help, good luck getting their attention.   Really let down. Hopefully something changes."}
{"text":"Thank you Yelpers!  My family of 4 ate here while visiting Clifty Falls.  Burgers are great!  Made with angus beef.  They are small so you may want to order 2 or 3.  The onion rings were awesome. Not greasy and an even coating of coating. Milkshakes were super thick and yummy.  Service was spot on, quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Man, the memories.  Used to go here after a night of drinking when I was in college.  Seriously, this place will cause coronary disease but it amazing after a night of drinking!"}
{"text":"Great spot!  Hubs had double burgers (White Castle size) and I had grilled ham n cheese.  Burgers were good - grilled little gems.  Ham was thick sliced - very good too.  Both had home fries - Yum!  Friendly and quick service.  Would recommend!"}
{"text":"Can you give 5 stars after a milk shake - YES! Had dinner at the Downtowner - see separate positive review. The folks at Hanover admissions lusted over the shakes and burgers at Hinkle's - the shakes were great but the hamburgers - cooked in front of you on the grill smelled and looked amazing.  Can you say hole in the wall - independent - special place - yep. Can't wait to return. Sliders at their very best. If you are a fancy diner - skip it. If you love food and independents - get in there."}
{"text":"Hinke's is a great and special burger joint in Downtown Madison. If you want an inexpensive meal, this is the place to go. The place is small, you eat at the counter, but it is a fun small establishment!"}
{"text":"Best place on Earth! Met my husband of 25 years here when we were students at Hanover College in 1988!"}
{"text":"Five stars for outdoor signage alone. Solid, solid little diner. Nice people and accommodating to a toddler. Could eat about ten of those hamburgers."}
{"text":"Pretty good.   We tried the Single cheeseburgers, double cheeseburgers, triple cheeseburgers, french fries, hashbrowns  (these were not good ~ actually that is being kind) and milkshakes. We thought it was better than McDonald's but not better than White Castle. It was good maybe a bit on the expensive side for what it is but it tasted OK and was  quick. 1.60 for a slider is pushing the limit for us but the place was packed and we had very good service.   Good quick service is worth paying for.  Probably will go again. really hope they  fix this fish before it drives away."}
{"text":"Hinkle's serves the classic, flat-top grilled, small, diner burger.  A wee bit larger than a White Castle burger but tastes like the best slider you've ever stuck in your face complete with pickles and grilled onions.  I personally like the singles with cheese but they also offer doubles & triples.  Then there's your necessary side of starch. They have French fries. BUT, yer gonna wanna order the home fries which are a pile of shredded fresh taters that are grilled & squarshed down until they're good & crispy.  Oh, yeah, there's other stuff on the menu but I've never ventured down that road.  (Though, I'll have to admit, their Exotic Ice Cold Shakes look pretty delish.)"}
{"text":"If you live in madison, hinkles is definitely a staple. Classic diner setup with delicious greasy food. Don't like greasy food? Then don't come here. Simple as that. Everyone loves it. My friends from Chicago are absolutely obsessed with this place. They've been raving about it for years now. Get a double cheeseburger, home fries with cheese and a wedding cake milkshake. You WILL NOT regret it! Yes, it is a hole in the wall. Yes, it is dirty. But the good is just phenomenal."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate lunch at Hinkle's Sandwich Shop today.  We had some pretty good hamburgers that were very reminiscent to White Castle \"sliders\".  Nothing fancy but good quality burgers.  I didn't even add mustard or ketchup to mine.    My wife had some onion rings while I ordered their home fries.  The fries were really hash browns IMO but were very tasty.  If you go be aware there are two entrances.  We entered the first door we came to and found ourselves in an old time diner setting with no tables or booths.  Counter stools was all that's available on that side of the diner.  If you go in the other entrance there are some tables and booths.  Not fancy but the food was good.  Very reasonably priced.  The atmosphere was from days long past.  A little hole in the wall diner with good food, nice people and wonderful smells."}
{"text":"It's always a good sign when the employees dance while they work and sing along to the music.   Our waitress was wonderful and guided us through the menu, nice and small-telling us they know what they do and do it well!  The specialty is their slider burgers and we all enjoyed ours!  Excellent tatertots as well!"}
{"text":"White Castle should bow down at the feet of Hinkle's Sandwich shop as they are the one true King of slider style hamburgers.   Hinkles has been an institution in the Madison, Indiana area for over half a century and during that time about the only thing inside thas has changed are the employees and the paint on the wall.  It really is an old school throwback diner and they dont want to be anything more than that.   There are two sides to the facility. The diner and the bar. The diner side has tables that multiple people can sit at, and it opens and closes at normal operating hourse. The bar side has the classic long bar with stools for people to sit at, and it stays open 24 hours. The menu.....well.....i've been going to Hinkles for years and I dont think i've spent more than 5 minutes combined looking at the menu.  Anyone who's anyone that comes to Hinkles comes there for 3 things. 1) The burgers!  Slider size burgers that are cooked perfectly, slightly greasy, and oh so freakin delicious! They come stock with pickles and onions and you can add cheese if you wish. 2) The Home Fries! Otherwise known as hash browns to some people.  You can get them covered with slices of american cheese if you choose to do so....which i do! 3) The Milk Shakes!  Baskin Robbins eat your heart out.  Hinkles has a wide variety of milk shakes with all kinds of random flavors....from Milky Way....to Purple Goo....to Wedding Cake. They are all homemade and go great with the small burgers! If you are ever within 50 miles of Madison Indiana......do yourself a huge favor and set your GPS for Hinkles!  You will NOT regret it!"}
{"text":"Out for a day motorcycle ride stopped by for some sliders. We had the double cheeseburgers with the grilled onions. They were great! Also the onion rings were good, but wouldn't recommend the bean salad, too dry. Staff was responsive and friendly. We'll go back."}
{"text":"This place is a classic model for a \"Greazy Spoon Diner\"  Place has been redone since a fire in late 90's.  Always a place to eat after a night boozing it up.  Hamburgers are like White Castle but better, Home Fries are really Hash Browns, if you're on a diet FORGET IT.  Lots of grease all around.   There is an Annex area that sits people like a restaurant.  I still go to the original area that has a dozen or so bar stools and a jukebox. Hinkle Factoids: Cook was shot by a stray bullet once.  One night I was eating and 3 guys came in & beat up a loser for pulling a knife on them...guy grabbed knife and loser threw his shoe @  em.  Police came in and dispensed some Hinkle Justice...guy looked stupid w/one shoe on and one off.  Breakfasts are good as well, lots of food...as I said, really greasy but good.  On a Saturday night be ready for the Hanover College kids to come in and have some fun. They'll sit down and vent, bs or talk about any topic you can imagine....I was one of them back in the day....everytime I return to Madison I grab a few Hinkle Burgers...I remember the phrase from my drunken Fraternity days, \"Hinkle's....Who's driving???\""}
{"text":"This place is just one of those little gems I can't help but stop at whenever I go to Madison, Indiana. The old school attitude of the counter service side is just fun. The food is good and satisfying, but not pretentious or overwhelming. This place is an institution of Madison and a place I feel is worth a visit.   We sat on the table and chair side this time, but I recommend the counter service side for your first visit. Both sides have chairs that won't majorly affect your rump."}
{"text":"Quaint, friendly place to get a quick bite. Noisy but to be expected with all counter seating. Don't sit next to the grill unless you enjoy looking at the cook and servers backside and listening to their conversations.  Overall though, I recommend."}
{"text":"Went here after a night of drinking... took a plane the next day and got a reminder of my meal while on the plane... not good.  Family in Madison likes this place once in a while but I'd rather just venture to McDonald's for a similar experience and less issues later.  If you like a greasy burger slider at 1 am, this place is perfect for you."}
{"text":"Had friends tell me about Hinkle's and found it very good.  Had a double cheese burger and peanut butter milkshake.  They have about 30 varieties of shakes.  You must try when you are visiting Mad"}
{"text":"Food = 4 (breakfast) 2 (late night hamburgers) Price = 3 Experience = 3  Great breakfast... terrible late night burgers."}
{"text":"good lord hinkles. it's possibly some of the best drunk food ever. from my fuzzy memories of late nights eating at hinkles it's a great place. and the employees...honestly, it just doesn't get much more amusing than that."}
{"text":"I travel to Madison from Louisville about 6-8 times a year and I've never been here before today. This place is great and definitely making a point to come back."}
{"text":"Passing through town just before noon; it was time to stop for lunch. I hit my phone's Yelp app for \"current location\" and this was the first listed, just as we drove by. It had ok ratings and one $ sign. Could it be good and cheap?  We went in. It appears to be sandwiched between 2 old buildings. The atmosphere seems   very utilitarian and well used but it grows on you. There are few tables. They offer unsweet, sweet and half & half iced tea. I got unsweet--it was ok. I got the breaded tenderloin sandwich--THE Hoosier sandwich with mayo, lettuce, tomato and onion. (Mayo is packaged)   It was thin and crisp but still close to 1/4\" thick--meaty. My husband got the grilled tenderloin. This was the pounded tenderloin before breading, it was tender, and home fries (hash browns) with cheese sauce (canned I'm sure). His was really good too.  His order came out quite a while after mine, we were apologized to. The icing on the cake of this lunch was it was under $14--what it would cost us to eat fast food!  That made  up for any deficits.  As we were finishing people started pouring in--glad we got there before the locals(?)."}
{"text":"Stopped by here while shopping in Madison on vacation a few days ago.  I'd already read about the place and was planning to eat there, but once I walked by and smelled the onions...there was no doubt.  Everyone I was with had a double cheeseburger and fries.  The fries were fine (nothing amazing) but the burger...I would eat here constantly if I could.  Just tasty burgers, grilled onions, cheese, pickles, and grease.  If you like White Castle (and I do), you should like this.  My husband (not a White Castle fan) says, \"It's like White Castle, except good.\""}
{"text":"A legacy tradition in Madison.  Generations introducing their offspring to the ritual of the greasy spoon, and there's none better than Hinkles!!  Late night or early morn, it's consistent.  Classic sliders with homefries, great chili and too many frozen drinks to shake a stick at.  Even a building fire couldn't shut this place down!!"}
{"text":"Imagine going to a small quaint location and then you run into a mom and pop cafe. Hinkles is just that. It reminds you almost of a nice diner setting back in the 50's and the staff are always giving a great smile. The burgers are like White Castle, except better! The milkshakes are to die for! I recommend the home fries with cheese and gravy, a couple sliders, and a wedding cake shake! Will eat here again!"}
{"text":"Came here because of Yelp and the lure of their inexpensive prices.  Sometimes you just get what you pay for. The restaurant is separated into two sections, with one side being normal dining room seating and the other side being where you can eat a counter.  There was no seating on the counter side, so we opted for the dining room side. Service was very fast and we both ordered Cokes. Then we started to order two single cheeseburgers with cheese fries. We are thankful the waitress warned us that they were the size of White Castle burgers. So what started off as extremely inexpensive, went up a bit to inexpensive. We got two singles and a double cheeseburger. Hubby ordered the fries with a piece of American cheese melted on them. Well, that was nasty. The cheese was mostly not melted, so most of the fries had no cheese. They were long, thin crispy fries and I have definitely had better. The burgers were a bit bigger than White Castle's with some grilled onions, pickles and cheese.  The buns were very soft, making the sandwich better, but the sandwich itself was just meh.  All in all, service was excellent, but the meal was meh. It was less than $14 for two people, which is about what it was worth. They did, however, have a very extensive shake list and if ever back in the area, I might have one to try it out."}
{"text":"[Preface: this is an incredibly-biased review from a Hanover Alumna]  Having gone to school at Hanover (a decade ago), Hinkle's is a rite of passage.  I remember being alarmed within the first 48 hours of arriving at Hanover, when people started talking about who was going to take my \"Hinkle's Virginity.\"  I calmed down once I learned it was just a burger shop.  But oh no, Hinkle's is not \"just a burger shop.\"  Hinkle's is the epitome of what the small town diner (aka \"greasy spoon\") should be.  By day, it is a family eating establishment (with the option of counter dining if you enter the 2nd door).  By night, it is a limited-seating, comfortably packed counter catering to the night owls & bar goers. The first time you go, you might think Hinkle's smells disgusting.  After the first visit, you will crave & reminisce over that smell.  If Yelp had been around in the early '00's, I would probably still be the reigning-duchess of Hinkle's...  What do you eat at Hinkle's, you ask?  Hinkle's rocked \"sliders\" before \"sliders\" were trendy.  You get a lot of people saying \"they're kind of like White Castle's burgers,\" but Hinkle's burgers are oh-so-much better.  Yes, they both have thin patties griddled with onions, but Hinkle's burgers are just better in taste & quality.  In addition to the hamburgers/cheeseburger sliders, they also have homefries, which are griddled hashbrowns.  Ask for them extra crispy & with cheese, you won't regret it.  The real story here though is their huge selection of milk shakes.  I still can not drive within a 30-minute radius of Madison, & not have to drive to Hinkle's to get a shake. It is worth the time & mileage. The decision is hard, they have many flavors to choose from.  In my opinion, you can't go wrong with a Milky Way* or Almond Joy* flavored milk shake (*No actual candy bars used in the shakes. But they taste just like them!).   If you find yourself in the Madison area for a day of shopping/festivals, visiting Hanover College, camping at Clifty Falls, or just on a pleasant scenic drive...and it's not Sunday, because they are closed on Sunday...stop into Hinkle's."}
{"text":"Rereading reviews for places I'd visited before, and I'm surprised I never wrote a review for this place. This needs to be rectified, right now.  I've never had good experiences ordering White Castle style burgers regardless if I happened to be drunk or got one of the specialty of the month ones(i.e. French Onion sliders), and this still remains my favorite of all the slider style burger places I've ever tried in my life(never mind my visit was back in the mid-2000s, and when I was visiting a friend here). Great classic ambiance inside(if you're from Chicago, it'll remind you of Diner Grill), and the food was great both times I went. The reviews are making me wish I'd ordered a milkshake at least one of those times, since now I'm starting to wonder what those are like.  One will probably never have a chance to go to this town, except if they're traveling on I-71 inbetween Louisville and Cincinnati, but Madison is so worth the detour to check out. It's such an amazing and charming little town, that I think others would also be impressed if they did the detour to check Madison out. One of these days, I'll make it back to Madison again, and definitely a visit to Hinkle's will be also in order."}
{"text":"A great place for homemade \"sliders\". They're a little bigger, and far more tasty that what you'll get at White Castle. It's worth a drive to Madison to grab some of the amazing little burgers. I had the triple cheese burgers, they were tasty, not greasy, and the buns weren't soggy. I added the home fries and the experience made me smile!"}
{"text":"Found this place while in town on business and looking for local flavor,  Couldn't have asked for a better dining experience.  Cutie/charming diner atmosphere w/ wonderful griddle fried burgers, a large menu selection, great sides and almost every shake flavor imaginable.  This is a must stop place while in Madison IN!"}
{"text":"Hinkle's,  I just drove out of my way for your most likely disgusting and overpriced shit sandwiches. On the topic of shit sandwiches, my 70 minute drive to find your garbage restaurant is closed, despite your hours saying you should be open until 5 am, is probably still not as bad as the dogvomit you're half retarded midwestern employees would have given me. In retrospect it was probably for the better because the lady at the gas station told me your Walmart bought slop gives most of your clientele diarrhea. either way update your add. I hope an enormous asteroid, which I'm sure is more intelligent than mike pence, lands on your atrocious restaurant. Furthermore, whichever lying cat fishing son of a bitch community college dropout manager lied about the hours on yelp to bring in customers gets HIV from homosexual intercourse and his fat wife births retards. If I could rate negative stars I would"}
{"text":"This is the best. Great burgers and awesome breakfast items too. On a recent visit to Madison was only able to enjoy Hinkle's one time :( but I know we will be going back time and time again. If your in Madison you have to go to Hinkle's!!!"}
{"text":"It was a decent Burger, but the reason I'm giving Hinkle's the 5 star rating is the overall dining experience. Walking into Hinkle's is like walking back in time to the mid-60's. This place hasn't changed its decor for decades and I hope they never do. Everything from the old counter to the quarter jukebox was a pleasant surprise.    The Burgers are small. A little larger than your average White Castle, but they taste a whole lot better. The meat and all the ingredients are fresh and delicious. But the star of the show is the restaurant itself. It reminded me of the little Grill's my Father used to take me to when I was a kid. It brought back some wonderful memories.    Here's the bottom line. If you're an old nostalgic fart like I am, you will love this little eatery. The food and service are top notch and the trip down memory lane was much appreciated. I thought the place was far-out, groovy. Peace and love to all."}
{"text":"Best little burger ever.  These things are amazing with cheese and extra onion.  The chili is decent.   This place has a nostalgia feel"}
{"text":"Hinckles has the potential to be the shit, especially if I lived anywhere near Madison, Indiana. But I don't. So all I will ever know it for was it's semi-over priced two eggs, white toast, hash browns and coffee. When I say \"semi-overpriced\" I mean a buck more than what I would have paid at my diner in New York. The eggs? Decent. The toast? It was toast. The hash browns? Delicious. The service? Friendly and attentive to my coffee cup. I had to pee at least five times before noon.  The prices for the dinner menu were cheaper than I could ever imagine. 99 cents for a hamburger?! Jesus. If I was in high school and lived in this town, we'd be all up in this place every weekend night at two in the morning. Maybe those prices and the friendly service will draw me back to Madison. But for now, it will just be a greasy spoon I found on the way to Los Angeles."}
{"text":"I had never had a slider before, nor did I know what it was before I visited this place.  MY sister and I got doubles and they rocked our world.  Every time I come to Madison, you can bet that I'm stopping here."}
{"text":"It's a nice little burger joint. hey serve classic sliders with a little better ingredients and your standards Midwest fast-food menu. The pork tenderloin was pretty good as were the home fries.  Enjoyed a very nice cappuccino shake =, but it lacked coffee flavor. Service was very fast.  It's a nice place but nothing special"}
{"text":"This is a great Mom and Pop's old fashioned type diner. They serve the best White Castle looking hamburgers you've ever had. They are a little bit larger than a regular White Castle. You can watch them make it if you sit in the grill side area. They also have a dining room that has more tables and more open on another side. When you order a burger make sure you get more than one because you will regret only ordering one burger. The french fries are awesome too. You can get them topped with cheese and gravy! Artery hardening good!The milkshakes are to die for. Handmade milkshakes!"}
{"text":"Hinkle's is a classic diner, with everything you want and need. It's open early for breakfast, with the standard eggs, bacon, and toast, as well as excellent burgers, fries, and shakes. Everything is very affordable and exactly as fantastic as diner food should be.  Hinkle's has been around since the 30's, and maintains the decor and style. It's one of the few places in town open 24 hours on Fridays and Saturdays, and is open 'til midnight on some weekdays, making it a great spot for a quick bite almost any time of day. The staff are experts at cranking out orders quickly and remembering every small detail you ask for."}
{"text":"Wonderfully flavorful burgers with grilled onions.  Skip the fries and try the home fries, which have a great flavor with a crispy surface.  You can add onions and cheese.  Historic location that adds to the experience. I had great service."}
{"text":"Excellent tenderloin and tots.  Very tender and tasty.  Bean soup actually has ham. Historic location."}
{"text":"Esquisite selection of hand blended shakes. Best paired with a pile of cheese covered homefries!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan! The burgers are fantastic and you MUST have them with grilled onions and pickles. The fries are just so-so - where you want to be is with the hashbrowns, those are crazy good! Milkshakes are THE BEST and they are my summertime treat when I visit."}
{"text":"Excellent place! Incredible food at decent prices! The staff was very kind to me. They didn't treat me different because I was from out of town. I will defiantly tell my friends to eat there if they are ever in the area!"}
{"text":"Deep fried goodness in a small town. The ladies working at the restaurant were nice. No frills but good food and good service."}
{"text":"We opted not to eat here, so i can't vouch for food quality, but i felt a need to correct a misnomer - this is NOT a sandwich shop. It is a greasy spoon - we weren't in the mood for burgers/fries/fried stuff but i'm sure they know their way around the grill. Walking in you are greeted by a strong greasy smell which normally would appeal to me but instead forced us to go to the downtowner when we realized there wasn't anything on the menu that sounded good.  Also, they need to work on their staff's ability to take calls - i called to ask where specifically they were located, and after multiple back and forth exchanges with a worker who obviously didnt care she finally had to ask someone what their street address was (!?) and had trouble telling me what businesses were in the immediate viscinity."}
{"text":"You don't have to be drunk to enjoy this food. The smell alone drew me inside after walking around old town Madison. The burgers are the smaller ones with pickle and onion like White Castle but three times as tasty. I could do some serious damage at this place"}
{"text":"The burgers are nothing fancy or special, but for the love of god I can't get enough! I look forward to visiting this place every time I make a trip to Madison, IN. Definitely one of the more memorable burgers I've had and I usually splurge for the double cheeseburger. At least two."}
{"text":"Old school style burgers, patties sized a bit larger than a sllider, hot off the flat top. They come on a fluffy roll like bun, standard with pickle and grilled onion, and the onion tastes like it's reconstituted from dried, which I happen to like on a greasy burger. Hubby and I added tomato and lettuce. Two double cheese, an order of curly fries and a coke for him set us back $10, including tip. Happy tummies."}
{"text":"Frankly, I felt somewhat misled by Yelp nation.  It's a dive. I like dives. Just not in love w/ this one.  We chose the cheeseburgers [2 each], hers w/ cheesy hashbrowns, mine w/ tater tots.   The better half also got a cherry milkshake.  Our waitress had described the burger as \"similar to White Castle\". I'd disagree - I love White Castle and these were certainly more meaty. ~2.5x meat!  I wanted more grilled onions. The dinner roll type bun was too mushy. I SO wish it had been grilled or toasted.  Tater tots were awesome as God intended.  Her cheesy hashbrowns, she described as a letdown. Sadly, the cherry shake lacked flavor too.  She rates it a 2.5-3. It's not a 2, eeks out a 3.  In fine; value proposition is lost here. And there's insufficient personality to carry it.  $23 all in."}
{"text":"I would consider trying to live in Madison if only for Hinkle's.  Walking in you feel like you have stepped back a few decades (in a nice nostagia-y way, not an ick, this place is dirty way).  This should be on the tour, or the best of list, for Hanover College.  The milkshake list is pretty epic.  It would take months to try them all.  And, they are so filling and good, you really could just get a milkshake and call it a day.  Granted, this would mean you couldn't get a slider- and that would be a tragedy."}
{"text":"Best little burger joint around. Small square hamburgers freshly made. You can watch them cook if you're in the counter eating area. Nothing fancy... But deliciousness in sweet little Madison"}
{"text":"It was exactly what I expected. Good burgers, good service. Home fries were great. I had no urge at all to burn the place down unlike other reviewers."}
{"text":"Somewhat disappointed in the food. We had been told that the tenderloin was huge but it certainly was not. The fries were made from frozen, not fresh. The restaurant may have history and nostalgia, but definitely not great food."}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for tiny burgers cooked on a flat top griddle in plain sight. Old neon sign, brick walls, a lunch counter style hole in the wall in an old river town. You'll want to order multiple burgers, as they are smaller than one may expect. I recommend 3 or 4 cheese burgers with pickle, onion and a side of tots. One thing this place lacks is customer service. The staff is not attentive, they could care less if you come or go, they don't want to have a converstaion, much less give you a refill. But Hinkle's is a mainstay of Madison, Indiana so it can afford to ignore customer service. What it lacks in human pleasantness it makes up for in character, history, and charm. I highly recommend going, but don't expect to be treated like a king!"}
{"text":"If you are passing through Madison, Indiana, stopping by Hinkles is a must. The home fries with cheese and the milk shakes are absolutely to.die.for. This place is perfect if you need a late night snack or simply crave a cheap meal with friends. Furthermore, they are very involved in the community. For example, they supply burgers for an eating contest that my Fraternity house holds as a rush event. The only reason I give this place a four instead of a five is because of the late night crowd that is mostly entertaining but can get a little rowdy."}
{"text":"Was in town from Indianapolis, and had several family members in town too from Louisiana. One thing my southern family always craves is White Castles, as they do not have one where they are from. I was told about Hinkle's from a local, and that it was a must have of Madison. So I offered to purchase food for the family (feeding 3), and unfortunately 2 of the orders were completely made wrong (one order had lettuce only when asked for everything, and the other had cheese only (when requesting no cheese with onion, pickle, and honey mustard). Not only did we have a mishap on the order, but the gentleman who answered the phone seemed to be very irritated we had a big order with special request so mid conversation he passed the phone off to someone else (without ever informing me mid conversation that he was going to pass off the phone). I now own a home in Madison, but doubt I will come back or recommend Hinkle's after this experience. Especially after the customer service from the original order taker. I have had better food and service at McDonald's, and White Castles is 5x better and gladly will customize orders without making you feel like it's a burden."}
{"text":"Ooh, this place was bad.  Really bad.  Even a greasy spoon restaurant like this can do better.  I left feeling dirty, not only because there was no water in the bathroom."}
{"text":"Hinkles, like most greasy spoons in small towns, is an institution. Since Hinkles is open late during the week and open all night on the weekends it is a place where many worlds come together: People getting food after a night of drinking, people working 3rds on break and college kids.   at night there are only 12 bar stools open and the cooks will serve up sliders cheese hash and milkshakes.   While I was going to college in the area, I always look forward to a late night snack"}
{"text":"No way in hell do I miss my opportunity to come here at least once when I'm in town. My husband hates me for the amount of Hinkles burgers I need, but I constantly tell him that his colon problems are not my problem. I can eat at least four of these warlocks and a small milkshake. It's amazing, so don't miss it."}
{"text":"For a little town Diner it was great. The cook busted out 6 orders in like 5 minutes. Staff talked shit about other staff in front of guests but it was pretty funny to listen to. Good food though. Our waitress was super nice too."}
{"text":"As advertised!! Burgers tasty -- sitting at counter feels like I rewinded 50 years in time...Would recommend doubling up on the burgers and skipping sides like onion rings or tots - just standard frozen potato sides. Very kind, attentive service."}
{"text":"This is the perfect place to go after hittin' up the bars downtown.  One of my best friends lived not even a block away, so when we'd drink at her place we'd walk to Hinkle's in the middle of the night for some killer eats.  When talking about drunken grub, nothing beats a double cheeseburger, home fries with cheese (and ranch on the side), and a Reese's shake from Hinkle's."}
{"text":"Hamburgers are small, which was a great size for me, but it could be a surprise. Home fries with cheese was awesome! Great diner, must try when you get to Madison!"}
{"text":"Me and my husband and kids stopped in here for a late lunch while visiting the cool little town of Madison. I had a burger and fries. Wow was it tasty. I had to get another. The employees were very friendly and I enjoyed talking with them about the history of the building. I love the old sign out front and the bar style seating as a option. Me and my daughter have a crazy obsession with dill pickles and he did not even bat a eye when a asked for a small pile of dill pickles on the side. Some other reviews talk about sliders and white castles. No way is this anything to be compared to white castles. The burgers are a slider type but are packed full of flavor. The price was nice to. If I am back to this little town one day I hope to stop in again."}
{"text":"Pretty good food and service here.  They are old-fashioned hamburgers which are similar to white castle both in size and in their contents.  The burgers are tiny.  We are talking T-I-N-Y by today's standards.  I had the triple cheeseburger sans the pickles.  It was good.  Filling enough for me, but it still wasn't very big.  I also enjoyed a large caramel shake.  It was just okay.  Definitely not enough caramel flavor for my liking.  Maybe another flavor would be better.  The funnel cake fries were a fun way to end our meal.  Nice and hot and dusted with powdered sugar.  Our server was helpful and friendly.  I would come back here."}
{"text":"Everyone talks about how good the burgers are here so we had to check them out.  Service was fast so people didn't have to wait long for a table. The place was packed. There were people eating at the outside tables and it wasn't a very warm day.  The burgers are like gourmet Krystal or White Castle burgers so if you like those restaurants then you will love this one.  This is a great place for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Stopped here on our way back from Clifty Falls State Park. Holy cannoli was it great! I have been craving it ever since we left. It ain't fancy and nor is it big, but if you want a great burger then you're at the right place! Warning, the burgers are pretty small. I might call them sliders instead. Definitely get several patties if you've worked up an appetite. The food can quickly, was cooked right in front of us, and was delicious! Juicy patty with great flavor. It's the type of flavor that only comes from an old flat top like that. We had an almond joy shake. Was a little disappointed that they made it only by mixing flavored syrups. While it lacked needed texture, the flavor overall was spot on! I will definitely return the next time we're in the area. Classic American Diner!"}
{"text":"Nice little diner in Madison. The service was good and atmosphere was typical diner type. The food was good. We both had burgers. I had fries and he had onion rings. Everything tasted great. The prices were good but the portions aren't huge. I'd eaten there many years ago and remember it about the same. I'll stop in again next time I'm in Madison."}
{"text":"Absolutely Terrific ! Tiny diner with one room that has a counter with stools only- there was a door to a dining room with tables- we watched the cooks prepare our burgers and potatoes on an open grill - the burgers are a bit bigger than white castles but exponentially better- I ordered 2 cheeseburgers, and their famous cheese covered hash brown potatoes! Had a tomato juice to be healthy and a home made peanut butter Mille shake! Delish! Very friendly waitress! Lunch for two of us was $20!"}
