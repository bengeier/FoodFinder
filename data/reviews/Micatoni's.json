{"text":"Best ribs in the GTA. Removed membrane, cut them into 3 rib pieces, and even seasoned them. All I had to do was BBQ them (and of course, eat them). Yum yum!"}
{"text":"Saw this location on Eat Here York Region & then read all the reviews on Yelp.   We were helped by one of the owners... Superb service!! We purchased meats etc... And then we could not leave without trying their sandwiches.  OMG delicious!!! We had the pulled beef as well as the brisket. Both had the coleslaw and Mad Mayo....both were scrumptious!!!  Moving forward we will purchase our meats from this location and will not leave without grabbing one of their delicious sandwiches.  Service was GR8!!! Overall a very positive experience! Thanks to everyone who posted."}
{"text":"July 20, 2014  Finally had chance to get the steak sandwich here.  Took probably 5 minutes to make... Took me 3 minutes to finish it.  Don't get me wrong, size of sandwich was pretty decent and the meat portion was very generous compared to other places, it was just that good!   Steak was seasoned very well and very tender.  No complaints at all.  Price of the sandwich came out to be $9 (well worth it).  My only tip/suggestion, eat sandwich on the spot!  If you are taking it home, there is a chance that it might get a bit soggy."}
{"text":"Brisket sandwiches are the best. The people their are so polite and always willing to help. I go there for all my meats."}
{"text":"Love their beef brisket and steak sandwiches here! They cook the steak per order and you better eat it right away while it's piping hot!"}
{"text":"This is a great spot.  Quality quality quality.  Try the beef brisket!  Highly recommended. Martin"}
{"text":"Best beef brisket I've ever ate. Be sure to put the coleslaw spicy mayo and home made chilli peppers."}
{"text":"It's a butcher shop with a little take away counter in the back. I had the beef brisket w/ onions, hot peppers and it was so so good!! I could eat the brisket all day with a big plate of rice. I'll be back for the steak sandwich."}
{"text":"The owner is very friendly and engages new and old customers alike. Excellent customer service from him. The rest of his staff are younger guys and their service is good but they're less aware of their customers.  The store is very small and usually has a few people inside. They have a hot table, a butchers table, dry goods and some frozen and refrigerated premade goods. There is a table by the window with a few seats if you want to eat a quick sandwich there.  The owner states they offer grass fed beef and other high quality healthy meat choices that they get from a supplier he has shopped around for. I saw an eddystone Meats truck out front once so I'll bet that's where he gets his meat from which is not a cheap place at all.  I've only had a few things on their menu as everything is quite expensive (but I'd say worth it). The beef brisket sandwich has a lot of liquid which makes the bread pretty soggy but it has a great flavour. The extra toppings are expensive but very very good. I've been charged for some sometimes and not at other times so I'm a little confused on their policy.  I've also tried some of their frozen food...the veal lasagna was nice but small and quite expensive. The mannicotti was nothing special. There was some fresh Mac and cheese which looked really awesome although it was quite expensive as well.  All in all it is a great shop in the area as long as you can afford it. Considering the area, I'll bet a lot of people can. There really isn't any competitors that I've found other than maybe longos and if you believe that grass fed beef is healthier then once again there isn't really any competitors."}
{"text":"Best meat in town.  Mike and Tony (owners) are great guys.   Their steaks are mouthwatering, and you've never had chicken like this before - incredible mennonite poultry.   \"Steak it easy!\""}
{"text":"The best meat shop in York region. I love their brisket and steak sandwich, so delicious"}
{"text":"Amazing food! We ordered some take-out catering from Micatoni's for a family event and it was absolutely perfect. These are really nice people who really know their stuff. Their knowledge and advice made planning the menu a breeze. And the food.... simply amazing, everything was cooked to perfection, the brisket, chicken breasts and shrimp were fantastic. The vegetables and pasta were also delicious and cooked perfectly, not overdone, just perfect. I really can't say enough about my experience, the food was delicious, the service was great and I felt I got great value for my money. I would use them again in a heartbeat for my next event, and I will definitely be stopping in for a sandwich from their hot table!"}
{"text":"Super nice staff . Mike and Toni are owners hence Micatonis! Pulled chicken sandwiches are awesome from hot table in back  Also fresh lamb chops , and burgers ready to go for an impromptu summer BBQ."}
{"text":"Their sandwiches are really good, my  favorite one is the Brisket with barbecue sauce. It is a must go place for sandwich."}
{"text":"Had the Beef Brisket Sandwich....it left me wanting more and more and more.  Can't say much about the Chicken Parm...but that Brisket so good..it makes me wanna smack your momma!"}
{"text":"The beef brisket is definitely amazing, wish the bun was a bit bigger but it's a minor complaint. It's not a sit down place but if you want a quick sandwich definitely give it a try.      They have marinated Korean short ribs ready for the BBQ, those were awesome considering you can take them home and grill em right away.  All the other meats looked just as good and I'm looking forward to summer BBQ season now :)"}
{"text":"Great service and great quality meat and chicken, the Mennonite chicken is like no other chicken. They also have a hot table, the beef brisket sandwich is to die for.  The store is also always clean, which is something that I always look for.  If you haven't been here you must try."}
{"text":"Quick update:  2 very positive experiences over the past 2 weeks at Micatoni's that have permanently endeared me to this place and its owners!  1) Mum and I were running a tad late with dinner plans recently and we decided to see what options we could rustle together and ran out to see what Mike and Tony could help us out with. Much to our chagrin they were closing up and walking to their cars as we ran to the door.   No matter! Tony chuckled, smiled and turned around and opened up again just to help us out with our dinner plans. We decided to pay homage to him that night and bought his pre-marinated grilling steaks and MAD MAYO so we could recreate the magic of his steak sandwiches in the comfort of our own home!  Result: Steak-ation in my mouth enriched with the madness of his mad mayo  2) Pressed for a quick lunch on the go about a week ago I decided to try something else from their sandwich board. Asking for a recco, Tony suggested the Brisket which he informed me was their best seller - even more so than the steak. LIES I TELL YOU. LIES!  I knew my skepticism would be overturned when Tony asked me if I wanted \"the MICATONI DUNK\". (When is a question like that ever a bad thing?). He proceeded to dunk my open faced italian bun, face down into the Brisket juices before loading it with the tender juicy meat, grilled peppers and onions.  Result: :)~~~~~~~-~~~ (drooling)  Couldn't go on without forgetting to update you all. If you haven't already get yer bottom dollar to Oak Ridges for a Sang-wich"}
{"text":"For my New Year's Eve party, I decided to get food from Micatoni's. We ordered the Saut√©ed Shrimp in white wine garlic sauce, rice balls, and the Rigatoni MIcatoni. For the amount of money that we spent, we got a good amount of food. Not to mention the food was to die for! The service was fast and great. Everyone was so friendly when we were there. This is a place that you have to try for yourself in order to understand just how amazing it is. They will definitely be getting more of my business!"}
{"text":"Phenomifukal sandwich new found love  Pulled chicken sandwich was like a slice of heaven  My buddy says the veal blows the doors off California sandwiches  Will be back"}
{"text":"Great quality products and service, but MAN OH MAN are the prices ever quite high here. The meats are not very competitive in price when compared to other (dedicated) butcher shops around town.   I get it, I'm not paying grocery store, pre-packaged prices for grocery store-pre-packaged meat, but there are a lot of other options at much better prices."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of the country, and staying in the area. Checked out some local yelp reviews for a lunch spot. Decided to give Micatoni's a try, and so glad we did.  Tried the brisket, chicken, pork, and meatballs. Everyone loved it, including the kids."}
{"text":"Owner is very passionate about his food which is so fresh and so delicious!  Brisket and veal are amazing"}
{"text":"I just went to Micatoni's for the first time a few days ago to try their Pulled Chicken sandwich, as per the advice of fellow posters. Unfortunately my experience was not good at all. I was really hungry when I got my sandwich and I took two big bites and right away I thought the sandwich was extremely salty. After another bite though I noticed that the chicken had a slight day old type of taste to it, so I immediately stopped eating it and threw it out. About 2 hours later my stomach started turning and I threw up. That sandwich was the only thing I ate and I wasn't sick prior to that. So Obviously I will not be returning ever again. Its not worth the risk at all."}
{"text":"Wife buys her Osso Buco from here.  The cut is perfect with lots of marrow in the bones.  I haven't tried their hot table food but it looks good.  Only complaint is they close too early.  Difficult to get there with their hours of operation.  Staying open 30 minutes might help."}
{"text":"It's not good... It's Amazing! Sandwiches are very delicious, steak done perfectly, to order. Good food, warm atmosphere and kind staff will always greet you there.  Fresh meat on the higher price range, but worth it, you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"I have to say the only reason for giving them 2 star is because I see most of their items are overpriced compare to what you pay at other local businesses. Quality is OK and staff customer service is average."}
{"text":"After reading all the raving reviews, I had to come and try this place. Mike and Tony (Owners) are wonderful. Polite, knowledgeable and awesome! I unexpectedly bumped into Kris U. while grabbing my lunch. What a coincidence!   Beef brisket was recommended so I gave that a shot and it was delisshhhh...succulent on the italian bread...hmm..delish..\"You gotta eat here\"  They also have alot of other items like pulled pork, chicken wings and etc...which smells soo yummy..  Homemade tomato sauce..and Tony even shared how long they boil the sauce for each day..now thats what I call quality. He was so generous that he gave me a bottle of the Tomato Basil sauce for freee...=D  I will be sure to be back in no time..awesomeness..=)"}
{"text":"I wish I could write a detailed review about this place, but my visit today was my first, and the entire experienced took about 4-5 mins.   The minute I put my feet into the store to take  a look around I was bombarded but two employees asking me what can I get for you, what would you like. Although friendly I don't think I made it passed the door mat and already I felt like I was on a timer. never got a chance to properly look at the items so I quickly looked around while two guys gawked at me waiting to make my first move. So I nervously said the lemon pepper chicken breast, and a brisket sandwich.   Total for 4 pieces of chicken breast and a sandwich came to 40 bucks and I just rushed out of there the same way I was rushed to place my orders. I was the only customer in the store!!!   I saw items on the shelves, and in the fridges near by but never really looked around. I won't go out of my way for this place and like the other reviews you can find other places at wayyyy better prices!"}
{"text":"Upon the strength of Kris' recommendation I made a late lunch trip to Micatoni's. So worth it!   Where to begin?  The beef brisket sandwich was just fantastic. The meat was so tasty. Delicious flavour. You could really tell it was a nice quality brisket. My friend had the pot roast sandwich special that day and was mightily impressed.  Great assortment of meats behind the counter. Super knowledgeable and friendly owners, who took the time to chat about their product and their approach. They really made the visit memorable.   We ordered our Christmas turkey from Micatoni's and I'm happy to say, that turned out extremely well also.  This is one of those businesses I just hope thrives and becomes an institution. It's got everything going for it. Do yourself a favour and stop by!  My maps application took me to the wrong plaza, the one north of Micatoni's with the Beer Store. Just look for the red and green sign on the east side of Yonge, it stands out pretty well."}
{"text":"Love their veal sandwich. This place is close to home so I'd like to try their meats soon. I've purchased bone marrow from here as well, and they slice in length wise for you!"}
{"text":"Absolutely awesome place to buy your meat and lunch/dinner!  They have everything from four cuts of steak to their own special marinated ribs!  Lots of lunch meats to choose from and amazing brisket!!!  I took other reviewers advice and ordered the brisket and rolls separately so it wouldn't go soggy for tonight's dinner. I also ordered the rice balls, the pulled beef and meat balls!!  The Mennonite Turkey was fabulous and the salami was as well!!! All nitrate and preservative free!!!!!!    Very friendly and helpful!  A lot to take in one first visit!  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Beef brisket for $7.99 and an overall rating of 5 stars on Yelp. I went the very next day after finding this place. Its a different take on beef brisket for me. I'm use to have the smoked beef brisket at BBQ joints. Not sure what cooking style they used here but the beef was soft and tender and was swimming in a soup of amazing sauce.   Don't even think about getting this sandwich to go. Its just so juicy that every second counts. By the time I took my first bite at the bar stools in the front of the store the bread was already getting soggy. The outer part of the bread still had a nice crunch though. Amazing beef brisket and I was tempted to go for another sandwich seeing as how good the first one was. I talked myself out of getting a second sandwich because I need to start watching my weight, plus there was a bakery right down the road so I had to save space for some sweets.  Service was excellent and friendly."}
{"text":"Thanks to Yelp in the Greater Toronto Area, we had bookmarked Micatoni's for their brisket sandwich.  We're sure glad we did!  Opened in September 2011 in Richmond Hill and serving the areas of Richmond Hill, Aurora, and Oak Ridges, this gourmet foods and butchery store specializes in quality fresh and ready-to-cook meats,  gourmet pasta/sauces, and sandwiches. Business partners Tony Rotondi and Michael Santeramo have been working together for 17 years and have 25 years of experience in the food industy. I was fortunate to chat with Tony, a very personable guy, who explained about his experience in butchery and his expertise of good quality meats, such as grass-fed AAA, aged beef for a minimum 28 days, and deli meats without any nitrates or preservatives. I assume Tony is the one with the chef experience - a butcher and chef concept.  These two guys and staff are very knowledgeable about their products and very friendly with their customers.  It's a cool name for their shop - a combination of their first names of Michael and Tony - Micatoni's!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/micatonis-richmond-hill?select=u1ld2vjl_xX5VoxdXVxJ2w  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/micatonis-richmond-hill?select=Vew6nITGnYmP2Dsj6zol8A   As for prepared sandwiches, Micatoni's most popular sandwich is their Brisket Beef in Italian Bread.  That sandwich is absolutely delicious - savory and tender brisket marinated in their special sauce with their special spicy and sweet homemade mayo (they call it \"Mad Mayo\"), red peppers, and onions in an amazing Italian bread that is crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.  We also ordered their steak sandwich with the same condiments and bread, which was also very good; however, their beef brisket sandwich was our favorite and is their most popular sandwich.  For both sandwiches, ask them to dunk the bread first into the beef's au jus for real flavor enhancement.  They also had other sandwiches, such as pulled pork or chicken, and Prosciutto or salami.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/micatonis-richmond-hill?select=il6lX2nMhUfU9L7DtBSOuA  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/micatonis-richmond-hill?select=4qsz9RxSuV8xg3uK-m0tRQ  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/micatonis-richmond-hill?select=m1pKyTboEQ4lgvGWdLnPig   Other than sandwiches, their ready-to-cook meats are perfect for that home barbecue or grilling.  They have all kinds of meats that you can ever imagine:  burgers (beef, chicken, turkey, veal); sausages (chorizo, veal, pork); marinated chicken (roasted red pepper, garlic, lemon & herbs, coconut lime, Greek, Italian, Montreal BBQ); kalbi; marinated pork/beef/chicken for souvlakis; stuffed chicken breasts; seasoned roast beef, and stuffed pork roasts.  They also do catering of pasta, meat, appetizer, and seafood dishes.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/micatonis-richmond-hill?select=WJfoQCbNVcUdHquYse9Lcw   They also have a great variety of hot sauces, meat rubs, condiments, pickles, cheese boards, charcoal, and accessories for great barbecuing.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/micatonis-richmond-hill?select=WuJU1lG5IeQsPlb2mSxV3w   Look for a green and red sign in a shopping complex in Oak Ridges in Richmond Hill, just south of Bloomington Road (TD Bank is located in this complex).  What a great place for good quality meats and sandwiches!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/micatonis-richmond-hill?select=5AMOJh8vpyP_PhgFjhnFhA"}
{"text":"I read all the glowing reviews for the Micatoni's sandwich.  Unfortunately, it didn't blow me away.  The meat is definitely good quality but the taste was so so.  The bread gets really soggy - especially if you drive 5 minutes to a nice picnic location.    On entering the shop, the folk behind the counter are always grinning and they look friendly enough.   However, every time I've entered this place, I've felt like I'm being watched.  I've also felt a bit pressured to make a decision and quick.  I feel like my lack of meat knowledge is being laughed at vs someone taking the time to explain to me or help me make my selection.  On asking for a type of Morroccan sausage (that is commonly sold in France)... I got the impression that these butchers were not here to help me but to sell the 'precious hyped' cuts they had there.    The meat that I have brought home albeit pricey, has been tasty.  But I'd rather shop at Longos or go for a Nutrafarm subscription than go to Micatoni's.    What they could change - is to make new customers feel more welcome.. to treat everyone as if they're a local... and to come out from behind the counter to help clients understand what are the best cuts for the day.  There's a lot to see in the store - and often times a client may not know what they're looking for."}
{"text":"A couple of weeks before Christmas, I ordered a 5lbs grass-fed tenderloin for my beef wellington dinner. It was trimmed perfectly, and by far the most beautiful cut of meat I've ever purchased.   As I was being rung up, I noticed a patron enjoying a nice brisket sandwich, and I just had to try one. It smelled so good in the car that I just sat there in the parking lot and devoured the whole thing. A couple of people on here have described the bun as \"soggy\", but seeing as I ate my sandwich pretty much right away, I loved how the bun soaked up all the delicious juices.   Now, this place isn't particularly close to where I live (about a 30 minute drive), so it's not like I'll be going here all the time. However, the next time there's an occasion that calls for a quality cut of meat and a sandwich for the drive home, I will be more than happy to make the trip."}
{"text":"The people who work here are friendly but that only gets you so far.   The sandwiches were TINY and looked nothing like other reviewer's pictures.  Beef brisket sandwich: at most 3 super thin slices of BLAND, slightly tough brisket on a soggy bun.  Pulled beef sandwich: the meat was GREASY, not flavorful and again a soggy bun  Had some of the WORST deli sandwiches of my life here, not sure if things have changed since all these previous reviews (they make this place sound fantastic- so much so that I went 25 minutes out of the way to try this place)  Very disappointing- won't be back."}
{"text":"Tried the beef brisket sandwich with the pepper and onions. Yum...delish!!  The staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Just went in with my brother, got some veal shanks and the beef brisket sandwich which I had to try because of all the great reviews, it was amazing! Brisket was cooked to perfection, melt in your mouth fresh. Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"It's rare to find a sandwich place where the entire menu is off the charts. Each and every sandwich is incredible, from beef brisket to pulled pork to veal cutlet. The bread is fresh daily and has an amazing crusty outside to hold in all the juices of your meat of choice. I think the most remarkable thing is all sandwiches are $6.99!!  (Keep in mind it's a high-end butcher shop too so I'm guessing that's where they make their money)  Absolutely the best choice for a sandwich, far better than any other panini/sandwich shop in the area"}
{"text":"friendly staff :) great sandwiches ! The bread used is great, the soft inside soaks up all the sauces and juices from the meats while the outside stays crispy. Definitely a messy sandwich, but worth all the napkins"}
{"text":"For Richmondhill, this is a mecca for good quality meat. So impressed by the selection and even more so by owner Mike's passion for food.   What you can find here is good produce, rare and game meats at reasonable prices and an owner who'll treat you like the neighbour that you are."}
{"text":"Great sandwich and great guys serving it! Try the brisket sandwich and coleslaw you won't be disappointed. Like the guy at the counter said go to a Butcher shop to get the best sandwiches I agree with him."}
{"text":"Insanely great meat.  The owner and staff are seriously knowledgeable about the meat, and super helpful with the cooking and grilling directions.  They help season and prep the meat perfectly.  Always a great experience."}
