{"text":"Top quality food here! We were staying in filey about 10 miles away and spotted this place but was busy so we drove back the next day and we were so glad we did. This has THE BEST fish & chips ever! And a top quality service too! Give yourself a treat and make sure you go, we will the next time we are over that way, thanks the 3 from Morecambe"}
{"text":"unusual fish pie with boiled egg in it was very tasty, but the scampi tails were just frozen scampi. chips were reheated and rubbery, so all in all disappointing and overpriced."}
{"text":"Really, a lovely little restaurant tucked away amidst the gaudy storefronts that face the North Sea. Friendly service, efficient and wearing old-fashioned uniforms, one could really feel as if it were decades ago with the attention to detail and regard that customers are paid by the waitstaff. Yes, the prices are a tad steep for the area (Â£55 for fish and chip dinners for four adults, with two desserts) but the atmosphere and break from the summer rush outside are well worth it."}
{"text":"Fish alright...chips are not crispy at all. Hard to pour out all the sauce and pork so stiff."}
