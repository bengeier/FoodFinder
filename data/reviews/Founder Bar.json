{"text":"Stumbled on a his just-opened gem. Excellent cocktail list, and happy to create something just for you. Also exceptional small plate dining. Loved everything- fried chicken, mixed grilled skewers and phenomenal fried Brussels sprouts. Easily accommodated my partner's dairy allergy too. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Founder Bar is one of those rare places where you walk in and immediately feel right at home.  I came to Founder Bar on a random Tuesday, not long after they had opened their doors to the public, to meet a friend for drinks. I spent a little too long looking at the cocktail list, as I wanted to try them all, as well as trying to pare down my choices in food to a manageable number of dishes.  After some time, we decided on starting with a Click Bait and Whiskey Sour, as well as a mixed grill (catfish \"unagi\", chicken hearts, braised pork belly) and a beef and cheddar bao. The drinks and skewers? On point, they were great. The bao? Oh. My. Goodness.  If there were a perfect twist on something I love (baos are my jam), then this is it. You get a tender bite of beef, swimming in savoury black bean sauce, wrapped in just the right amount of bao, topped with a salty cheese foam, creating a vehicle for what might be one of the best bites of anything I've had all year.  I am drooling just thinking about it right now.  We followed that up with a Great Balloon Ride and a Texas in Thailand. Gotta tell you, the cucumber air on a Great Balloon Ride? Magnificent. We also grabbed a plate of Deb's Chicken Salad, a spicy and tangy chicken salad that I wish I had more room for additional plates, as well as a small order of the green curry fried chicken. Crispy on the outside, tender on the inside, delicious all the way through.  I spent a lot of time highlighting the food and drink, as I should, but I should also point out that the ambiance and service were fantastic during our time there. Our glasses of water were constantly refilled, food and drinks showed up quickly, empty dishes were whisked away, all while checking in on us and providing delightful banter. Impressive.  I think I'm going to be a regular at Founder Bar, see you there."}
