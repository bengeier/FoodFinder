{"text":"Wednesdays the have live jazz band open mic, something fairly new I assume. Thursdays they have another band doin the same thing - it seems pretty bustling during the hours of 8pm to 11pm.   1 dollar domestic beers during happy hour 3-7 pm  I went for the music and did not have food, only drink - the bartender was friendly and offered me try a cocktail she enjoys (at no cost) - the drinks were still around 7 to 8 bucks - a little pricy but the music and improv from some of the musicians made it totally worth it."}
{"text":"This restaurant charges $15 for one drink, but their tables, bars & the very small restroom was unclean. It took almost an hour for the server to bring drinks on a semi-crowded night. Also, some of their bartenders need more training and their servers are disorganized. They charge $10 for valet parking, but the walkway directly in front of their front door was full of snow & ice. The live music is good but there are other live music venues in this city."}
{"text":"Fish Fry on Fridays and its unlimited all you can eat! Definitely want to come during happy hour. They also play jazz and neo soul type of music. It's a cool spot, if you're trying to chill."}
{"text":"This place is overpriced and underwhelming. Let's start with the drink menu. I don't know how any bar could charge $13 for anything with Pucker in it. Now the food. We ordered the chicken wings and they were embarrassing. Very tiny and extremely bland. Tasted like they were old, and maybe they were because they came out cold. I couldn't really get the attention of any of the employees so we just dealt with it. The inside of the bar was nice, but it was pretty hot. Considering the car wasn't close to full I hate to know what it would have been had there been more of a crowd. Maybe the people who didn't came knew something I didn't know about this place. Well now I know! Never again."}
{"text":"We wandered by Take 5 jazz club and made the lucky decision to check it out on a night when DTC Organ Trio (Dan Wilson, guitar; David Throckmorton, drums; Cliff Barnes, organ) was playing. They had great chemistry and obviously loved playing together, especially when they pushed each other and really got jamming. They opened with Tenderly, followed by a tune with a Latin beat. They mostly played familiar music. I wasn't expecting to hear the Carpenters or Eric Clapton in a jazz club but the crowd loved it. The interpretations were creative and joyful. I was also happy to hear Caravan. A good vocalist joined for a couple of songs in the second set.   This place should have been busier on a Friday night: no cover and the atmosphere was cozy and good for listening. The service was delightful. Calling the food \"tapas\" is a stretch - it was basically bar food. There's no dessert but a couple of of martinis on the menu would make fair substitutes."}
{"text":"Enjoyed my first time there,,,, I will be back,,,, the shrimp scampi were to die for,,,,, and the flavor on the honey mustard wings had a little bite that I really enjoyed. TOP NOTCH!"}
{"text":"Saturday night entertainment was Great!!! Our seats offered no privacy and were extremely close to other patrons...tabless along the wall seemed to be better than the middle isle. Enormous food portions enough to share or take home leftovers"}
{"text":"I've stopped in for drinks with small groups several times and been pleasantly surprised by the service and nice live music offered.  They do not have anything on tap, so expect more cocktails and a limited selection of bottles.  Take 5 attracts a more refined, older crowd than the typical warehouse district establishment.  I've yet to try the food but I've seen it each time I've stopped in and everything looked and smelled good from afar.  The menu seemed seafood-oriented with a combination of small plates and entrees."}
{"text":"I sometimes forget how wonderful this little spot is. Yes It's a jazz club but also a restaurant. When I was a meat eater I loved too many dishes to mention. Now that I'm vegetarian I thought I'd be stuck piecing together a meal but that was not at all the case. While there were only a few options listed on the menu Brian the owner quickly gave us more amazing options. Based on our restrictions I choose the grits with Gouda cheese that were excellent. My brother who did not want cheese and opted for a huge veggie pasta bowl that was enough to share.  I had vegetarian eggrolls that were not on the menu, there was fried broccoli that was on the menu and it was tasty. Either way you can't lose at this spot, great food, great jazz, great service & a full bar.  Tell them Sandra sent you."}
{"text":"Ok, this place is \"alright.\" For starters  I'll say the ambiance is nice. Now lets get to the real......... We were charged $5 for the live performance which was fine but the band performed all of 20min IF THAT within the 3 1/2 hrs we were there. They took EXTREMELY LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONG intermissions in between the 3 songs they sang. When I called they told me the band starts at 9pm. We got there about 8:30ish and they didn't start until after 10:00. So that was a waste. The food was \"alright\" oh and I ordered a margarita that to my surprise when the bill came was $15. I'm not cheap (believe it or not) but I truly believe in getting my money's worth if I'm out spending it. I felt like it was a COMPLETE WASTE."}
{"text":"Stopped for drinks on July 4th after the fireworks. They had fantastic live jazz band on that night. A classy place for sure, but not pretentious. The service was outstanding, great drinks and food too. Definitely coming back next time I'm in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Never went into the club...made reservations confirmed reservations then told a different cover charge. I made reservations for 15 people as we are from out of town and I have never experienced such poor customer service. Manager owner whomever I spoke with proceeded to tell me I looked at an old website really the website I was on linked me to his personal cell phone number at which time he again said I looked at an old website. Sir we were all set to visit and patronize Take 5; but after this exchange we'll keep our money and go elsewhere. Please step your game up monitor and maintain ALL YOUR WEBSITES!!"}
{"text":"Lovely place for a date night. I went this past Friday and the performance was absolutely incredible.   Natasha was a lovely server, as well."}
{"text":"The music, host, people and atmosphere were great. I attended the open Mic on Wednesday and it did not disappoint the food was great. I also attended the Eric Roberson concert here several months ago and it was beyond worth coming to. I will be back again."}
{"text":"Take 5 has potential but fails to deliver.  The construction inside indicates that no expense was spared. The prices on the menu are fairly aggressive by Cleveland standards. In and of itself, that's not a problem. However, the food is primarily heated up frozen food even on basic items like fries. As a result, the food is not spicy like New Orleans flavor but bland. The cocktails are not innovative but not classics. The wine list is extremely heavy on repeated styles from different vineyards.  The jazz is great and the building itself is great. I sincerely hope that Take 5 makes an effort to refocus their menu. They are trying to bring the Mississippi Delta north which would be a great contribution to the area but instead of 20 poorly executed dishes, they should have 5 superstars. It's challenging to spend $10-20/person on microwaved meals but I wouldn't have any problem spending $20-30 on a real gumbo or shrimp and grits.  Here's hoping to a turnaround because the concept is a diamond in the rough."}
{"text":"Advertised is two bands, the second is a \"jazz\" trio kicking off at 10pm.  A party of 3 arrives at 9:55 for the 10pm jazz trio and is charged $20 each at the door.  ($60 total).  Within a few minutes, the R&B band on stage finishes and we order our food and drinks.  Rather than a jazz trio, a DJ plays rap music for the next 2 hours.  The food was decent and the drinks were pricey, but there was no trio that we paid $60 to see.    We should get a refund."}
{"text":"RECOMMENDED - Fun place, decent food and ok drinks.  We went here and got a cute little table in the window. The service was good. It's small plates so we got a bunch and shared, all were pretty good. The bartender was really nice but I think she was new at her job so the cocktails were slightly off.   The music was great!! Wonderful singer and jazz band and the vibe inside the restaurant was reminiscent of New York or Chicago.   Go for the music and fun!"}
{"text":"My third time here and I'd rate it a 5/10.  No Valet service and $7 to park.  Had to ask owner to please turn on the a/c on July 8.  Waiter was friendly and accommodating but he had to be.  The food either had zero seasoning or was too salty.  Sent back fried green tomatoes.  They didn't have ANY seasoning on them.   Drinks were okay but definitely not worth $15 each.  Band arrived 1 1/2 hours late.  Just not a pleasant experience but the band was extraordinary!  The drummer had a beautiful voice, some arms and was a cutie.  Place was much more crowded on my previous visits.  Based on this experience,  I don't think I'll be back.  UPDATE- Just ate the grilled wings I purchased as a to-go order.  The BEST grilled wings I've ever had!!"}
{"text":"Please check this local music spot.  The band is fresh-- r&b and jazz.  The crowd is young and eclectic.  The drinks are tasty.  The food is good-- although I cannot speak to the prices.  The location is also good as it on a strip of other bars and clubs that could be worth checking out.  #chifoodie #foodtourism #music #culture #cleveland"}
{"text":"We have been here twice and will definitely be back again. The staff is engaging and the music is phenomenal. This place doesn't get a lot of press but I have no idea why. It's cozy, intimate and the talent is superb. This is a Cleveland gem."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a drink and to listen to some jazz on a Wednesday night. The bartender was extremely nice and very attentive.  We had a glass of wine and sangria. We asked for a wine list but the bartender said they don't have a wine list so I just ordered a glass of Pinot Noir. It was okay not great but the sangria was amazing. The music was very good and we  probably go back again"}
{"text":"Met some friends on a Saturday night and the music was awesome. The service, left a bit to be desired....but I'd definitely be back. Intimate atmosphere and great music."}
{"text":"Friday after work is like a scene from Romper Room!! I cant understand why there are so many kids in this bar and they are doing Spoken Word poetry. I always figured after work Friday crowd to be a little different!! Some how we ordered 3 drinks and got charged for 4!! I pay and add a tip....this is my way of never returning....."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place.  It seems cool, and the music they had piped in when we arrived was good, and the woman behind the bar was friendly.  But it's just not that great.  I went here with a friend for a few drinks and bite.  They have $1 beers during happy hour.  Score!  We were putting the Yuenlings down like nobody's business.  They also have happy hour food specials.  We shared sliders, turkey ribs (I swear) and some kind of weird egg roll thing, too.  All three were delicious and cheap (I think they were $4 each).  We were the only people in the place for the entire 2+ hours we were there.  That's not a good sign.  A band came in and set up while we were hanging out, and we were getting psyched.  LIve music is almost always good, and we were set up for a private concert.  Well, this was one of the rare exceptions.  The band was crazy loud.  Way WAY too loud.  They drove us out of there.  So, cheap beer and food could bring me back, but I'm not confident this place will be open the next time I'm in Cleveland.  A shame, because the concept is sound, and a good jazz club is hard to find these days."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, great live band. First visit was on a Friday, the place was fairly empty but the service was good. Our server Shameka was very nice an attentive"}
