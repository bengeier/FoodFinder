{"text":"I ended up here last week with my coworkers on a business trip to Cleveland. As a West Coast based midwest transplant I LOVED this place.  We don't have decent beer gardens in SF and there's nothing like sitting outside at an unpretentious bar with a bucket of Coronas watching a warm (ok, it was hot) afternoon turn into evening.   We didn't try the food but the laying around on the grass watching kids play on the jungle gym was great. Again, we don't get to lay on the grass and drink beer in SF so when the kids asked us why we were sitting on the grass we laughed.   A big thank you to the girls at the Rock n Roll Hall of Fame who sent us here. Thanks for saving us from the House of Blues, this place was so much better!"}
{"text":"I just had a great experience here over the independence day holiday.  People have been complaining about the $8 fish tacos that aren't any good. Well, now they are $7, and I thought they were pretty tasty. Maybe I was just hungry. Perhaps my expectations were  lower since I didn't know it was run by the Crop crew. I think it's a big step up from the last group that managed the space. It was well staffed and friendly, and as everyone else has mentioned, the location can not be beat. So maybe Cropicana is working out the wrinkles. It would be nice to see an improved beer selection, but picnic fare kind of go hand in hand with bud light and the like."}
{"text":"I give this place 4 stars because of the atmosphere, so don't read this if you're looking for a review of the food because I haven't tried it.   I played in the whiskey island Sunday volleyball league last summer, so I'm well familiar with what the bar/restaurant had to offer.  Using this as my gauge, Cropicana is a great improvement.  There is a REAL bar outside now (yes, one that can serve multiple people at one time and has multiple options to choose from).  The prices are decent also, which is always a plus.    I haven't been inside so I can't review that either, but when you've got outdoor seating what else do you need??  This is a great place to relax with a group of friends, work on your tan, and get your drink/eat on.  Bring your dog if you want (but only if he/she is social because there will be plenty around) and enjoy yourself at one of Cleveland's fun little hideaways."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of smoked food. I've eaten smoked ribs from Texas through Arkansas and at a few true smokers in Ohio. Unfortunately at the Cropicana they are sub par. I wish it was different and I would love nothing more than to have a local spot with kick ass ribs. I was looking forward to trying their signature cherry chipotle ribs. I came across the cropicana in an article in scene magazine and decided to give it a try.It was a nice night so I decided to eat outside. It's basically out door eating on a picnic table which is fine if properly cleaned and trash removed which it wasn't. I was there on a Tuesday eveneing with low crowd volume. I even talked to Steve who ran the outside kitchen as to what type of wood he uses in his smoker. All true die hard smokers stick to one type of wood to ensure its distinctive flavor. Sauces on the other hand can be varied to accomodate customers taste. He told me that they use a combination of oak, cherry, maple. Basically, he told me that he couldn't stick to one type of wood due to cost. You could tell it was oak. Have you ever eaten oak smoked ribs before? Tastes like it was cooked over a wooden pallet. Put enough sauce on anything and it helps cover up the taste. Which brings up another point that true smoked food comes WITHOUT sauce on the meat. So that you can taste the mesquite, hickory, apple, cherry wood etc. grilled meat with sauce is just BBQ. Their cherry chipotle sauce sounded good but there really was no hint of smoky chipotle with chery flavor as promised.The \"cook\" dragged out a slab of pre cooked fatty ribs out of a serving pan submerged in sauce and then proceeded to flip them over the grill a couple of times. I guess to liven them up.  The meal included fries and carolina cole slaw. I gotta point something out here. I hate to judge a place on the meritt of its fries but 95%of the time it is a good indicater. With all the choices they have out there and after all how freakin expensive are fries that they could have done much better. I'm sure that  whatever giant food distributor they use for frozen fries could of recommended a better choice. How bad could they be you ask? They kind of look like the pale, pasty, starchy, plain fast food fries but with a lot less flavor. How is that possible? Even a good dose of salt didn't perk them up. The cole slaw is labeled as \"carolina\"  vinegar based  and it retained its cruchiness somewhat which is better than the creamy milk infused type that seems to be every where else around Cleveland. Beer is a bit pricey and limited selection. Waitstaff just looks at their watches and wishes they where someplace else. All in all I would give it a 1.5 but the rating won't let me. I hope they get this outdoor kitchen thing figured out and work on the menu lot. It has the potential to be a good place."}
{"text":"Why 5 stars? It is on the water and most of the seating is outdoors. I can think of 2 other places in all of greater Cleveland that can boast the same. Everything else about the bar other than location is just satisfactory.   The indoor bar itself is nice enough but really small; the draw of the place is the huge outdoor dining area. They have one pavilion with picnic tables and a huge grassy area with tables. There is also a deck with a dj. The crowd reminds me of a high school cafeteria; each picnic table in the grassy outdoor area contains a different type of group, ranging from bikers to hambones to two women holding hands. It is sort of refreshing, actually to see so many different crowds coming together in the same spot. There are outdoor port-a-johns, but don't be fooled. The inside bar also has bathrooms. Yes, the sunset grille is extremely casual."}
{"text":"Oh Crop, how in the world do you feel good about attaching your good name to the food you serve at Cropicana?  The food is terrible.  Dry, overcooked ribs.  Chicken fingers that tasted like freezer burn.  Why can't you set a higher standard for this food?  Yes it is a casual waterside spot but that doesn't mean the quality you are putting on the plate should be this bad.  Either up the food quality or shut it down."}
{"text":"Don't expect CROPICANA to live up to CROP standards!  Clearly stated - management had an oversight on this one!!  BACKGROUND Crop is moving to W. 25th/Lorain so they opened Cropicana at Whiskey Island during the move. It was a great idea to try and bring great food to Whiskey Island while moving locations. And- how hard could it be to top the so-so food quality and slow service of previous years at Whiskey Island? Unfortunately - harder than they thought.   WRONG FIT - MENU - PRICES They didn't really look at the location and current crowd and adjust appropriately. It's not the same as downtown. The crowd is mostly Volleyball players Sun-Thur and the weekend is full of boaters, 'partiers' and bikers. In fact- we actually witnessed a fight the other night. No suits or high heels in sight.   LOCATION - ATMOSPHERE The bar itself is not in great shape- but holds his own- as a joint. The outside area is nothing to write home about either- with cheap attempts to provide atmosphere- old picnic tables, lights hung from poles, a \"patio\" with plastic tables and chairs and a bar area.   FOOD - PRICES We'll pay $7 for wings in an air conditioned nice restaurant- but not here. The food prices are too high and we were generally disappointed with the food (this simply can't be the same kitchen crew from Crop). Oh- and where is the amazing popcorn?? It's bar food at CROP prices and that doesn't work. Not to mention- you have to stand in line, order and wait for it - like fast food!! REALLY? We waited in line for 20 minutes the other night and paid $30 for 1 order of wings, a (small) sandwich and two beers!! It just wasn't worth it.   SERVICE Lastly- the service. At least the old place had service to the table (even if they couldn't keep up with the demand). The bartenders aren't necessarily seasoned bartenders and most do not have the friendly attitude needed for a location like this. Some are fine but others simply do not know what they're doing. They don't serve people in order of coming to the bar and the wait is just too long.   Final conclusion - if you haven't been, don't go- wait 'til Crop opens on W. 25th."}
{"text":"I'm giving Cropicana 4 stars because I was drunk and only remember good things when I'm drunk. There was a band that was playing music that was fun to dance to. And there were the best fried fish sliders I've ever had. (Ok, I've never had fried fish sliders, but they were really, really good.)  Apart from that, I think it's just a big dive bar on the water in kind of a random location to get to (whiskey Island). I was confused when I heard it was the same place as Crop that was on West 6th, because the one time I ate there, I loved that place. But this is nothing like that Crop."}
{"text":"By far, Cropicana (Sunset Grill?) at Whiskey Island is my favorite spot in the summer. Its reminiscent of something you'd see in a larger city - a outside bar located next to a marina. In the summer, watching the sunset over Big E is a grasping visual. In the summer, I'd say the views from the Grille beat that of any bar or restaurant in Cleveland. Literally, you're on the water.  Wendy Park is right next door. If you find yourself boatless, play some sand volleyball (the courts are right along the lake) or have an afternoon picnic and visit the Sunset Grill for a nightcap. As an added bonus, you'll get to watch all of the fancy sunburned boaters come off their fancy boats. You'll consistently use the term \"fancy\" with sarcastic tone because you'll be jealous they own a boat and you don't.  Pets are allowed. There's an area to fill up water bowls. So, on a weekend, you can bring a blanket, lawn chairs, your pooch, listen to the band and throw back some cold ones. Who would actually throw a cold one? Where did that phrase even come from? Why am I questioning that phrase during a review when I could just erase the text before I hit submit?  The drinks are priced a little higher than your average watering hole in Cleveland, but they're a little cheaper than what you'd find in trendy spots like the Warehouse District or Ohio City. Food was good from what I've had. Simple, no frills items like bratwurst, Angus burgers and beer can chicken. Most of the items are under $10 and the quality of the food reflects the price. If the food would be a little higher quality, this spot would easily be five stars."}
{"text":"I wish Crop hadn't taken over the management of this place that used to be fantastic.  The Sunset Grille was by and far superior to Cropicana.  I didn't like it the first time (the service was poor), but thought it might have been an aberration.  I give it another chance and brought my parents, and the service was so poor I was embarrassed that I brought my parents.  None of us understood why the service was so poor.  There were so few people in the restaurant when we arrived yet the bartender/order-taker still managed to be dismissive toward us.  Very disappointed.  Only go if management changes, hopefully back to the folks who ran it before."}
{"text":"My initial reaction?   Well, it seems slightly spiffed-up from the last time I saw it as Sunset Grille, err whatever it was called. Although, they did keep a lot of the original character, which I didn't mind.   The inside is cleaner and decorated slightly nicer, but no major differences. It's still packed and hard to get to the bar to grab a drink. The outside patio and seating areas looked expanded and updated to accommodate the new \"order your food outside\" vibe.   I give Cropicana three stars because I've been there for drinks only, so far. I've had food at the old Whiskey Island establishment though, and nothing can be worse than that stuff. We sat inside at the bar and once we got the bartender's attention, she was pretty good from that point on. Cheap beers and boaters ambiance by the lake pretty much makes for a great time, no matter what the food is like... at least in my opinion.   Although I've heard mixed reviews about the food, I'll definitely be back to eat. I think people are expecting the same food they'd get from Crop, but this isn't Crop. It's the same owners, yes--I get that. But this is beachy-fare, people. It's not meant to be a 5-star meal. I'll certainly return with an open mind and give them a fair shot. Besides, I'm almost positive that most folks head out to Whiskey Island to drink in the sun all day by the lake, not to pull out the white table clothes and nice china.   And honestly, at least someone in Cleveland is utilizing the water front.   Anyways, I'll be back (in Arnold voice)..."}
{"text":"Overpriced tasteless food.  White Castle has way better hamburgers.  Too bad one of the very few public places on the lake has such terrible food."}
{"text":"I'm utterly mystified by the numerous hate-filled reviews of this place. It's not Crop, nor is it meant to be. The menu is limited, but summery and nicely varied. Yes, it's perhaps a bit pricey for what it is, but it's outdoor dining in a great setting. The food is nothing remarkable, but it's not bad. I had some good fish tacos -- the toppings, sauce and slaw were excellent, but Lake Erie fish would have made them great. My husband got and enjoyed the smoked wings. We shared onion rings. Their fryer clearly had clean oil and a good temperature. Service was fast considering the fact that they were mobbed. Decent beer selection and a full bar. The food and prices probably merit three stars, but the setting merits five, so we'll settle for four."}
{"text":"Now THIS was a fun place to hang out on a sunny Father's Day in Cleveland!  Casual beach umbrella-topped picnic tables studded the sandy, grassy area of the Marina at Whiskey Island.  Casually-clad (some shirtless dudes! : - )))) lined up at the shed for food and there was a separate line for drinks - full bar and some quite nice craft beers on tap and in bottles.  I guess I should mention this is kind of a beach bar - there was a building, but it all happens outdoors!  Love that.  We ordered bloody Mary's, a shandy and a Bud Light Lime while the hubby waited in the food line for smoked wings.  We took all our goodies over to a table and enjoyed some of the best smoked wings I've ever had while we watched lots of dogs with their owners interacting with a slew of other dogs and owners - pugs, chiuauas, Boston terriers, labs, shelties...to name just a few.  Good boat-watching, too, as sailbots and cigarette boats alike pulled in and out as we enjoyed the sun.    Good old-fashioned 60's and 70's rock and roll played in the background and as we were leaving, a live band showed up to entertain the night away.  Wish we could have stayed.  We WILL be back!"}
{"text":"[This review was for the Sunset Grill in 2010, before it opened under new management and renamed as Cropicana in 2011].  The place to get your booze and food at the Whiskey Island Marina, if you don't bring your own, that is. The setting is pretty informal there with a dozen or two picnic tables and a couple pavilions outside. I went there a few weeks ago and their beer selection was pretty mediocre and pricey. I hope their selection improves after Memorial Day. No drafts, only a few bottles, all domestics [bud, molson, PBR, corona] except a great lakes or 2, from the overflowing recycling bin. They didn't have dos equis or rolling rock, my preferred domestics.  Prices were a bit steep, a bottle of Blue Moon for $5. At that price, you're paying for drinking lakeside.   Our service was fine. The view of the lake is great and that you can dock your boat and walk no more than 100 feet to a bar. But, that's about it.  Their location is the only thing that would persuade me to make another visit there."}
{"text":"Cropicana was our favorite spot in the summer. Live bands, good food, lots of booze, nice sunsets, great views and a good crowd made it the perfect summer hangout any day of the week.   But what the heck is going on with it now? The website is gone, the Facebook page is gone, and there has been absolutely no word from ownership about what is happening in 2012. If it didn't make money and had to close for good, that's a bummer but I understand it's business. But to not announce anything about the status of the bar, not even a short word on the website, is completely inept public relations management. And it's a slap in the face to all of the bar's many fans.   I hope someone else purchases the bar and opens it for 2012. The food doesn't need to be special or expensive - Cropicana had good food, but nobody was there for the food. Throw some frozen burger patties on the grill and sell them for a few bucks and I'll be just as happy. This bar is special because of the atmosphere and the feeling you get when you show up there on a random weekday night - you're there just because it's summer.  *edit*  OK, it's back to being Sunset Grill and opens on 5/5. Hooray!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice as 'Cropicana' but only for sunset/drinks.  We ordered our drinks at the bar and sat at a picnic table.  It's always full, but I think a lot of it is the volleyball leagues down there.   It sucks there's not a lot of places to go watch the sunset and/or drink by the lake.  They can pretty much get away with doing nothing special and still be busy with their high prices.  I was expecting more of a change in the setting when it went over to Cropicana, but just more picnic tables and an outdoor bar/grill area.  The inside is completely the same.  I suppose it is more convenient to grab your beers out at the large bar, but there's nothing too intriguing about the whole place besides the view.    BUT, I'll probably be back.  Cie la vie."}
{"text":"Krusty's is always fun in August but that is only one day and has nothing to do with Sunset Grille. I might as well sit at Edgewater Park and listen to Isis, Sleep, Kyuss or Pelican, think about what Stoner Rock means to me and how it makes life better."}
{"text":"::Bugle Horn::  Cropicana is dead.  After only a year, we're back to Sunset Grill. Everything is exactly the same, except for the menu.  The menu is back to regular pub fare, like quesadillas and chicken tenders and such.  You know what?  I'm disappointed.  On the menu, most sandwiches are listed at $8.95 and they're Costco frozen slabs of whatever thrown on a bun with some fries on the side.  For that kind of price, I miss Cropicana.    Of course the view, the music and the people watching is stellar, but I just hate knowing that I'm now going to have to eat before or after I go to hang out there..."}
{"text":"This is a great place to grab a beer after a volleyball game or watch some live music.  It stinks that everyone has discovered this little gem this summer - weekend volume has been crazy!!  The food is better than your average bar food but it could use some additional options.  But you really aren't here for the food,  you are here to enjoy the few months of nice weather in Cleveland!!  Overall, Cleveland has done a poor, poor job on capitalizing it's lakefront location and Whiskey Island is just about the only place near downtown that you can go and relax by the lake!!"}
