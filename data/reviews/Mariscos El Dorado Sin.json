{"text":"When my friend told me that he found a spot for good mariscos sold outdoors at a food truck, I was immediately weary (seafood outdoors in hot AZ?) . However, as he had already been a few times and said that every time he had a good experience, I gave in. The prices are affordable and comparable to other mariscos, maybe even cheaper. I had a tostada de ceviche de camaron (shrimp ceviche tostada), fish taco, shrimp taco, and marlin taco. Everything was amazingly great tasting! It looked and tasted fresh, despite being hundreds of miles away from an ocean. The service was also great and they have a big selection of homemade and bottles salsas and hot sauces. I highly recommend, you will not be disappointed. Even though there is a shade and a mister on, it is still hot so definitely go on a cooler day or more in the evening hours."}

{"text":"So much hype for bland food & bland service. You get your chips & salsa (good). Ordered a Med. Coctel (shrimp & octopus) it was overloaded with cucumber, tomato, and onion and found 5 shrimp were in it. (Sorry don't have pic of the coctel). Ordered a fish taco, that was decent. Ordered a fish fillet empanizado (breaded fish) that was ok. Expected something more appealing because of all the hype this place gives out. It was not what I visually expected. It came with a side of rice(I've tasted better) & a side salad (it didn't come with dressing & I wanted dressing, the server never showed up to ask if we needed anything after we were served. When we arrived there was about 3 tables being serviced. It was not busy at all for us to have be unattended after being served our food. Drinks: Lemonade-tasted more like water had to squeeze lemon in to get lemon flavor. Bottle coke- bottle was hot and was given a cup with ice. I like to drink my coke from the bottle, personally. Will never eat or give this place another try. First impressions are lasting impressions."}
{"text":"All I'm going to say is this place serves some delicious food. Every time I've eaten here I never leave disappointed with the service or quality of food. The owner is super friendly and we've never had a long wait with service even on packed days.   I'll happily keep going to both of their locations."}
{"text":"The service was mediocre, the waiters made no attempt and being welcoming. They serve chips, salsa and left over tortillas. Found a half eaten tortilla in the chips...the prices are expensive, as expected for marisco places, but I wouldn't waste a dime here. Novillero kills this place..."}
{"text":"Very good food. Servers are nice. Nice environment live music on the weekends... Fresh Seafood"}
{"text":"The prices were too high for what they provided. I love mariscos but was definitely disappointed with this place. Some one else said it was too much hype for something so bland and I agree. The greatest disappointment was the fact that they brought my michelada like 20 minutes AFTER they brought the food. Sad to say, first and last time I come here."}
{"text":"Best seafood in phx they are opening a restaurant soon! Los mejores Mariscos estilo Sinaloa."}
