{"text":"Have enjoyed delicious meals here a few times with the parents. 1st time was sumptuous banquet dinner that was tailored to suit the families. 2nd time was great lunch featuring noodles in soup broth with duck. 3rd time was another great lunch featuring steamed fish and hot pot. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I'm kind of skeptical when I saw only 3 reviews but since they were all 5 stars, I decided to give it a try. It was a disappointment!

Location - This restaurant is located in an elderly residence. People going to the restaurant or dining hall are not allowed to enter through the main entrance which we didn't know. There was no sign. I was lucky enough to meet a lady who politely refused to let me in and gave me directions. My poor friend and two other customers across our table spent over 15 minutes trying to figure out the dining hall location. The restaurant itself, once you get there, was clean and spacious. 

Food - Good for the pig stomach soup, beautiful beet basket carving with 2 carrot crabs on the appetizer combo and the taro paste dessert. All the signature dishes were substandard. The marinated duck, oyster pancake and wutou fish in broth were over cooked. Even the leaves on the Jiè lán miáo were chewy!

Service - the receptionist was very friendly and helpful. The server had no smile the whole evening."}
{"text":"I would recommend this place to everyone! Though it's in a senior nursing home, but it's open to public. I could not describe how excellent the food is! Everything that we ordered is awesome! The best part is the food here is catered to seniors mostly, thus it's always less sugar, less salt and less oil! If you want an excellent but healthy Chinese meal, this is the right place!"}
{"text":"Very difficult to find and you would never know about this place unless someone told you about it or discover it on Yelp.  

When we first arrived, from the outside they looked empty.  I was very surprised to discover that all of the tables were reserved already and luckily they found a table for us to sit at since we were a small group.

The restaurant itself is very bright and clean looking.  Clientele is definitely majority seniors and that's probably because it's located under a senior's residence (possibly).

Ordered House special noodles, fried rice, satay veal, and tofu and mushrooms.  Food was very flavorful They have dinner sets starting from $70 to $100.  I believe some of the other set dinners, you have to order in advance since it's items that require hours of cooking in advance.  I would recommend trying the place, but do your homework in advance to get the most out of your visit."}
{"text":"Brightly lit and quite spacious. It's attached to a senior care complex. The food was pretty good and consistent for the most part. The lamb soup is great but if you're not a fan of black pepper I wouldn't suggest trying it because there was A LOT of pepper in it. The chilled crab was delicious and quite meaty. A great start to the meal. 

Not giving it 5 stars because the waittime for some dishes was extremely long, especially the dessert which was an assorted plate of rice balls with filling. That tasted decent, not really worth the 30min wait. 

Kind service, good food, and decent prices. Worth a try."}
{"text":"Vintage Garden is the absolute epitome of a hidden gem. Previously only open to the residents of a senior home located in the building, it is now open to the public. 

The casserole rice is such a good big portion and very tasty too. 

I called and pre-ordered this egg white pockets wrapped inside with seafood. Very interesting and nicely presented. 

The fried egg with shrimp is good as well. Shrimps are good size. The steamed scallop with tofu is good, but better if the scallop is a bit larger. 
 
This restaurant serves up Chiu-Chow style Chinese cuisine, with a multitude of delicate and gorgeous dishes.

Overall, I really like this restaurant and will come back again with my family!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place as I found it on yelp with high ratings. It is tucked in the back of this building (well the side that faces North - whereas the entrance to the eldery housing faces south). So do drive all the way around the building to get to that entrance. There are road signs that state that this restaurant is at the back.

The place is on a smaller side for a restaurant, but the place is fairly clean and bright with new furniture. 

There aren't a lot of choices for food, and almost all the food are priced at a specific price (ie, 12.99, 14.99, 22.99, etc.). There aren't many choices without ripping a hole in your wallet (the dishes that were 25.99+), so it felt like we had to settle for what seemed the tastiest to our likings. 

They do not give you a tea pot and you have to wait for the waitress to come refill your cup or wave them down. The food was alright, but there was a dish we ordered - satay chicken with vermicelli, which was disappointing because the vermicelli was over-cooked and soggy and was breaking apart. All the other dishes were alright, just like other chinese restaurants. 

I probably will not go again as there are not many choices, they accept cash only, certain dishes (most of them I think) indicate that a 10% service charge is automatically added to your bill and that you could get food for the same quality with cheaper prices elsewhere. 

I do have to not that they do seem to spend lots of time in accessorizing the dishes with animal carvings made out of food - in the sense that I saw other tables with very impressive carrot carving of animals."}
{"text":"I would never imagine a hidden gem like this will exist at a nursing home for the elderly. This restaurant is a private restaurant. However, there's no exclusive membership fee. The restaurant is tucked away in the back entrance of a building, So just look around. 

Onto the venue: this restaurant is very clean and quiet. We had many visiting relatives over, so my uncle decided to make a reservation to have dinner here. The head chef came out to greet the guests every so often to check on how we were doing. Plus the staff are friendly and maintains a very good attitude. Based on my observation, the clientele are known clients cause the head chef is friendly to everyone. 

Onto the food: I can say based on my pictures, it is not of this world. The food was made very fine and tasty but not oily or super salty or super sweet. The decorations to the dish are also very nicely made. Only a seasoned chef with superb control with knife skills can do this. Back to the food, I don't have words that can describe how tasty they are. Please see all my pictures. Note, this place serves Chiu Chow style cooking. 

I plan to come back with the folks again and perhaps bring the friends over too."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place more than 5 stars. Interestingly, this restaurant is located in a senior apartment complex but anyone is welcome to come in. 
This place was a 7 out of 5. If you are trying to find traditional Chiu Chow food that includes great presentation and kind service, this restaurant is a gem.
We had a traditional Chiu chow platter, a fish and tofu soup, along with a very traditional pepper and pig stomach soup. Every dish came with a hand carved sculpture which is a staple of the chef. The best was the dessert which included \"taro mud\" which is often hard to find and unbelievably, watermelon dessert soup which was beautifully decorated."}
{"text":"Great food right by the senior home apartment. Funny story, when we were first driving there we thought the food wouldn't be great only because it was at a seniors home. We thought they'll probably put less sugar, or salt in their food so it wouldn't be tasty but little did we know... it's probably one of the best meals I've had at a seniors home apartment before and I've been to a few of those already? 

Typical chinese food, very decorative. I'm sure if you want you can take cooking classes with them on carving beautiful sculptures with carrots! Should've taken pictures but next time :)"}
{"text":"Hidden gem!   Tucked away at the back of a retirement building ,  it is  a master chef that can make  you a mystery meal.  You can also do a la carte.  Nice meals and  great selection despite the small place.  The  temperature is a bit warm since it is part of a seniors' building. Kid send  family friendly.  No alcohol.  Good for skepsis occasions without the loud crowd.  They serve low priced breakfast for  the  seniors in the building  too.  Clean place and  good service."}
{"text":"Great food. The food was a match for our taste. It does not matter if you're looking for something light after a couple days of eating too much or good taste. You should come here. Their food will tell you not me. It was a little hard to find but was expected after reading other reviews. Please park your car at the rear or back of the building because the main enterence is located at the side of building."}
{"text":"This is a pricey restaurant with specialty food.  There are things you gotta pre order like the wintermelon soup, the pork lung stuffed with rice, etc.  Call ahead and ask for specials. 
Don't go on Chinese new year or similar occasion because their service is going to be really and super bad and rude."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem.  They don't do any advertising, so it's a mouth to mouth tactic.  

The place is meant for retired people to enjoy, so the price would be very reasonable.  They also have expensive items on menu too, in case you want something fancy.  

You can also reserve a big table, which you can request special off menu items.  The chef is extremely experienced."}
{"text":"WARNING:  you will not get those fancy cut dishes if you do not pre-order them.  
Minimum for the special presentation meal is $45-55 dollars per person

Also. They will charge for containers for left overs. 

I feel I have to warn everyone before they end up coming like me and being upset with the presentation of their food




That being said this place is unique. Hard to find. I dare say exclusive.  It is behind a nursing home hidden away in the back. You may have trouble finding the entrance as well as it will look like your going into a party room in a condo or nursing home. 

I came here based on reviews and definitely the cool pics that ppl took. They have some award winning chef.

Unfortunately it didn't live up to the hype. I found out when I requested the items on the Yelp page and they said those were all special preorder items only and you don't get a choice as the chef decides what you eat.  

We ordered their set combo with their popular duck. The presentation was nothing extra ordinary. Very plain. Upsetting since the special items were so nice.  

Food was too salty and lacked taste. With the exception of the chicken.   I would give it another shot but only for the special presentation dishes."}
{"text":"This place seems pretty clean and the tables are not too close to each other, but it is still pretty small inside. The server I think it is the owner seemed very impatient when we ordered and asked questions regarding the dishes, even we were the only table at that time. All dishes were overpriced and the taste were below average except the chicken. I saw they turned down the seniors who wanted to dine there impatiently because they didn't make reservations. I guessed they got enough business because of the location right beside senior home. But for others, can easily find somewhere with better food, service at a lower price."}
