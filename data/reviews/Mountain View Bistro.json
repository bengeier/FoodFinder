{"text":"Great breakfast! Eggs and bacon both delicious, maple syrup with the pancakes; near-perfect hash browns; and cheerful, on-the-ball service by Lisa. Reasonable. We'll be back."}
{"text":"This place was a fantastic find!!! The store front makes it look small but says nothing about wuts inside, it's spacious gorgeous tables n the little coffee cups and spoons are so cute! The sammich we got was marble roast beef and fries looked great and tasted great! They got great details. The lady working the cafe was running everything and never forgot about us kept our water n coffee filled and food out quickly! First timers here n we plan to come back for the Alaskan sammich"}
{"text":"The food we had ordered was not right and the staff were rude and unhelpful in trying to resolve the issue. Never ordering from there again."}
{"text":"I would like to thank Lisa and the Mountain View Bistro for sharing such a nice experience at their location.  I just looked up a place to have a solo breakfast since kids were in school and this set the mood for the rest of my day!  Great food options and your establishment is phenomenally clean!  Thank you once again Mountain View Bistro!"}
{"text":"Sunrise burger is on point. Didn't give 5 stars because the restroom was not as clean as the rest of the place appeared."}
{"text":"Overpriced and the food was bad. Went there for a recent Sunday brunch. The place was empty. That should have been my first clue. I ordered an egg skillet dish and it was over cooked and cold when it was served. Waffles were not good either. Would not go back."}
{"text":"Bistro Mountain View has fresh home-made sandwiches and excellent salads Real food served here. Their food is hearty and very tasty. I'm going to try breakfast next time. Well worth a trip to this restaurant. The waitress was very nice as well."}
{"text":"Just discovered this place while looking through Yelp for a breakfast recommendations. The decor was simple, fresh and appealing. The service was very friendly and the food came quickly. The coffee was a quality French roast which we enjoyed. Loved finding this new place. We will be back to try the lunch menu. Mountain View Bistro is a winner!l"}
{"text":"This is a fabulous restaurant for brunch. Their menu covers it quite well. I had the sunrise burger and it certainly didn't disappoint. The service was very good and the ambiance very soothing. I will be back to this great little gem!"}
{"text":"Stopped today to try the new place.  We had a Breakfast and a Lunch.  The Country Fried Steak with biscuits and gravy was the best I have had in many years.. made from scratch country gravy really made the dish!  The burger was juicy and seasoned very well, the accompanying onion rigs were excellent..  Lisa did her best to make us right at home.  Fernando the Executive Chef came out to tell us his plans for the future,  they have only been open a month.  We will recommend to all our friends of Wine 5 Cafe."}
{"text":"The food is delicious. The service is awful! They literally have one person there all the time!!! She is the hostess/Server, doesn't speak English very well and never greets or acknowledges you . This place has potential.... but needs to have more staff or \"Re-vamp\"   Sadly Service trumps food. If your service is crappy i'm not coming back. Too bad!"}
{"text":"Lisa waited on us and the food was very good. The garlic chicken was good and so was the chicken wrap.  We'll be back"}
{"text":"Amazing food ! Service was great! Pancakes were super fluffy and melted in my mouth , maple syrup homemade."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery.. and food came hot and on time.   FYI \"the sandwich\" is not a sandwich but just pancakes with a side of egg and bacon.. nothing special .. plus they forgot the cheese.   Also ordered the meat grandma.. which was tasty.. again nothing spectacular just your standard chicken fried steak  ... home fries were burnt  Don't know if I'll eat from here again... maybe if there were no other options available"}
{"text":"Decent food unprepared service. Called for a veggie burger. Just asking to switch to a veggie patty took 5 minutes to explain and resulted in the chef having to be put on the line. Really you offer veggie burgers on your menu.../anyways it took forever just to order then it's a $20 order and she wants a credit card over the phone. Ummm I'm driving that's why I'm calling for take out and finally I jus pulled over to give it. Then I show up thinking they must just be busy or something. Nope one couple who already got their food is their. Take over a minute to be greeted while I stand their awkwardly. She says it'll be another 10 minutes so the burger can cook good. Ummm it's a veggie patty. Ok so I wait and wait. Took over 30 minutes for 2 veggie parties. Not even sure if it's good yet I'm late for my appointment now and couldn't eat it in time. Super disappointed mostly with the service I received. Won't be back"}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast!!!! The coffee is great and the maple syrup is delicious.  All around awesome experience. Go here!  :)"}
{"text":"Looks can be deceiving...this place is terrible. We looked at the menu and pricing online, made a reservation, and show up to a green walled, white table, trendy -looking bistro. The girl at the host station, had us wait for a table, although there were only 4 tables of customers, so she could put together two-4 top tables together for our party of 5 people. Completely unnecessary! The hostess/waitress was not easily understood. Once seated, she disappeared, only to return 10 minutes later, with water. She took our order, then asked what we would like to drink. Again, she disappeared for another 10 minutes, before bringing out our drinks! When our food arrived, only 4 plates were brought to the table. My Salmon Salad, arrived after 5 more minutes. I asked for the Salmon and cheese to be put on the side, but they arrived on the same plate. The Salmon was overcooked, the cheese had no flavor. My daughter ordered a hamburger without peppers, it came out with peppers. When asked if it could be remade, they took it, only to return twice to ask if she wanted to take it to-go! We ordered a Soft pretzel and cheese, only it was 4 small pretzels from the freezer section at the grocery store. The cheese was like warm, no flavor and an unpleasant looking consistency. The fries looked good, but weren't hot, had no flavor, but we're sprinkled with parsley! My husband's eggs were hot but the grave was cold. This experience was so disappointing. When we are paying for good food and service, but this place had neither. Plus the prices that they charged us, did not match the menu online. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE!"}
{"text":"I have ordered a few different items from here and everything has been amazing! Food is always fresh and delivery driver is very friendly. Great breakfast and I recommend the Black Bean Burger so delicious! Try the sweet potato fries too!"}
{"text":"Food selection and plating was impressive. They definitely give a lot of food. We came around 10am on a weekday, and it took longer than 15 minutes for our food to arrive. There was only 1 other couple being served, and the waitress wasn't that attentive. Other than that, I'd definitely be back."}
{"text":"This spot has been several eateries over the years. We've tried them all and this is by far the best.  Enjoyed a delicious breakfast, prepared well.  NOTHING was greasy (one of my biggest pet peeves!) Everything was fresh and quite good! (Yes, there are places that can actually screw-up breakfast) The service was friendly and attentive, but not overly done.  The prices reasonable and comparable to any other 'egg' place. Highly worth stopping in and giving them a try.  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is super cute.  Our burgers were amazing!  My husband had a crispy chicken sandwich that was delicous!"}
{"text":"Location is bit hart to find! Need a bit more promotion and marks to bring attention to it. Menus was a bit to simple nothing exciting about it. The food was just OK something you can cook at home. Coffee was great"}
{"text":"Fantastic new place that just opened. I've only tried two different things off the menu but so far they've absolutely nailed it. If you're in the area give them a shot."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! It looks a little small in the outside but it's huge inside and very nice looking. Food presentation is great and it all tasted amazing, highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Food was 5 star  Most employees just lack common sense customer service  Order for pick up or delivery and you are good to go  Also SADE playing on tv doesn't help either"}
{"text":"There's nothing better than ordering delivery and imagining how amazing it's going to taste....unless you wait and wait and wait some more (yelp delivery service) and then you wait even longer just to end up really sad, still hungry and disappointed.   As far as the food, the burger was small for $11, the mac and cheese had a burnt flavor but it probably could have been decent with the jalape√±os and bacon that we paid $2 more for and didn't receive. Maybe this is more of a breakfast place?!?"}
{"text":"Do not believe the other reviews.   Went here at 11am on saturday.   Only ones in the restaurant. Should have walked out.   But we were hangry so we decided to eat here.   Food was disgusting."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time today. Ordered the breakfast sandwich and received biscuits and gravy. We already waited over 30 minutes for our food when there was only one other table waiting on their food so we didn't send it back. The food was good but I probably won't be back. The service was super slow for how slow it was, there was only 3 other people in the restaurant. And the third person came in way after us and some how received there food before us."}
{"text":"This is a new local bistro. Very caring and friendly service. Wonderful menu...excellent food quality...great coffee..cant wait to try more of the menu.. I had the cinnamon french toast...very creamy and sweet....also 100 % maple syrup!  The coffee was a,strong italian roast...excellent.. A l so superb omelette and hash browns....great menu to explore"}
{"text":"Canceled my delivery order after a 40 minute wait with no explanation. Not impressed."}
{"text":"Our new favorite place to eat. The food was amazing and the service was excellent. Lisa made us feel right at home, we can't wait to go back for another amazing meal."}
{"text":"This place is hidden from what I can tell... inside the restaurant is very pretty. The employees seem disappointed not having anybody in the restaurant & I wouldn't blame them. The Bistro is a nice place to go and there tables are set up cute in a way.. which is always a good thing. I believe this place should have much more customers and business."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of breakfast food, but Denny's and iHop are too much like fast food. I'm writing this review after my second visit, and I am still impressed. I can't speak for lunch items, but the breakfast food is very tasty. The bacon is delicious and the French toast and pancakes don't make you feel tired after eating. The eggs also seem to be fresh cracked and scrambled. This is now my go to spot for breakfast out. Oh and the wait staff has been nice as well. :)"}
{"text":"The food was good but they are pretty understaffed or at least they were for Mother's Day. Took awhile to get our food(we waited over an hour after we were seated) and folks that came in after us received their food 10 mins before us! It wasn't the Mother's Day treat that I had hoped it would have been for my wife so I won't return during a holiday but I might return for lunch to see if it has improved."}
{"text":"Had a great breakfast. This was our first time eating here. We will come back! Great pancakes! The syrup was the real deal! Friendly service potatoes were very good too!"}
{"text":"I just had lunch today at this new joint with my mom and sister. They had been before and decided I had to try it. This is small unassuming place in the same shopping center as Target. When we came in we were the only customers.  Our super sweet server recommended the tropical iced tea and it is delicious! Comes with with mint and orange and is so refreshing. A couple more customers came in throughout our meal but we were never neglected. We started with the onion rings which they serve with their house made cheese sauce. I love onion rings but here they're just a delivery driver for this delicious sauce.  I ordered the Greek salad with crispy chicken. The chicken was very moist and seemed hand breaded. The salad had a very tasty dressing and plenty of feta and olives. My mom ordered the Meat Grandma breakfast and loved it, said her eggs were perfect. And my sister ordered the chachos, she had ordered them before and was very excited to get them again.  Our server was very helpful and accommodating. We will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"This place does great breakfast delivery!  Everything arrives hot and special orders are no problem.  Perfect after a late night out!"}
{"text":"Fantastic! Got the patty melt! Order was on time and delicious! We even ordered 45 min to close!! Thank you!!"}
{"text":"We loved the place,  my husband ordered the sunrise burger & I ordered the chicken & waffles, both were great. Burger was juicy & perfectly cooked. The chicken was crunchy but juicy inside. Great service & great attitude. They serve breakfast,  lunch & dinner,  must come by. We'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"I've been here before and the food was great.   I just tried to go again this time with my son who is 1. They don't have high chairs..  Seriously?   You're in a shopping center with a target and various other stores.. and you don't have ONE high chair? That's ridiculous..   They've redone there menu but I didn't look into it, the menu when i was here about two months ago had variety but a lot of things weren't available.. I may return but obviously without my son because they don't have high chairs"}
{"text":"Great food, excellent service.  Love this place. Easy to walk in and eat.  Good menu selections.  I suggest the Meat Grandma"}
{"text":"Lisa was who greeted me! Offered me water while I waited. Really nice setting with good music. Pretty quiet while I waited. She suggested a few items on the menu which we loooooved! And threw in some housemaid solo sauce to dip the fries in. Can't wait to go back and eat in next time and will probably try some other items. All in all. Good customer service, clean setting fast fresh food with really great portions. (Big burger and a lot of fries)"}
{"text":"We may have come during a really bad day here. We came here for a Father's Day brunch and we were probably the 5th party in the restaurant (there were 6 of us including 2 children). They had 2 servers for the restaurant and they both appeared to be struggling to keep up with their customers. We were seated and roughly a little over 20 minutes later they came to take our order (they served 2 parties that came in after us before they served our party). Our food arrived 33 minutes later and the serving of eggs both on my husbands plate as well as the side of eggs had hair in both. I did however order the French toast and it tasted good. While the food I had may have tasted good, the experience was overshadowed by poor service. I hope things get better here."}
{"text":"Yummy pancakes! One of the best breakfast I've had in a long while  everything was fresh and great service!"}
{"text":"This place has a lot of good choices. I had the eggs and cake and it was delicious! I would deff recommend this place. Service was pretty good too. The prices are just right."}
{"text":"Perfect little cafe for breakfast.  Menu offered several options.Portions decent.  Great service"}
{"text":"Mountain View Bistro (Cheyenne & Tenaya)  Short Review: Mountain View Bistro is located in the Target shopping center on Cheyenne and Tenaya. The restaurant opened about 4 months ago and based on the reviews, it's a local favorite. Their menu consists of mainly breakfast and burgers. The establishment is clean and the customer service is fantastic. I recommend the Sunrise Burger. It's simply awesome.   Longer Review: I'm so glad that I dined at Mountain View Bistro for lunch. I was craving breakfast and a burger. My decision was down to a favorite fast food joint that rhymes with Sin & Shout and one of the other local breakfast joints in the area. I was parked in front of Mountain View Bistro and out of convenience, decided to check them out.   There wasn't a single customer here. I had the whole place to myself. One of the employees greeted me, handed me a menu, and gave her recommendations. I told her what I was fiening for, which was either breakfast or a burger. Her response \"how bout both, howbow dah?\" Naw, I'm joking about the \"howbow dah\" part, but she did recommend the Sunrise Burger, which is both breakfast and a burger. The Sunrise Burger is no joke. This is a 1/2 lb. Black Angus burger with eggs, hash browns, two thick slices of bacon, and cheese in a Brioche bun. Keep in mind that everything I just listed is all between the bun. The burger was also complimented with a side seasoned crinkle fries. The burger was work of art and I confess, I was a little intimidated to eat this beast. The burger patty itself is one of the juiciest I've had in a long time. The BAE, cheese, and hash browns made it even better. Craving a burger? Craving breakfast? The Sunrise Burger is a no brainer.  The rest of their menu consists of more burgers and a lot more breakfast eats. And by the way, this restaurant also serves Vegetarian and Vegan burgers.   Overall, I left Mountain View Bistro very satisfied and extremely full. The service is top notch and their Angus burger is too legit to quit. If there's one concern, it's the fact that this place was completely empty when I dined here. I finally found a delicious local burger close to my office. I hope the traffic increases and business improves. I would hate to lose a good thing. Sunrise Burger!!!"}
{"text":"I'm writing this review while still sitting here staring at multiple empty plates.  This place is that freaking good and I'm stunned by how great the food tastes.  Our waitress was incredibly friendly and took time to describe the food and make sure we loved it.  I can't wait to come back, there is so much more I want to try.  I've never heard of \"chachos\" but now that I have i can say they are a must try!"}
{"text":"Excellent little spot. It's a brunch style cafe with breakfast, burgers and salads. Open until 6pm. Inside is clean, updated and spacious. The waitstaff was super friendly and courteous.   We ordered the Chacos Fries. Yum! Do it! They are delicious! Crinkle fries with a cheese sauce, taco meat and pico de gallo. We also ordered the Red Rock and Sunrise Burger. Both were fantastic. Big, handmade and juicy!   If you're in the area give this place a go. It's so good, it's even worth a drive over!   Check out my pics for more."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! Lisa is just amazing. I had the best pancakes of my literal life there and she was so sweet to us and our daughter. Will DEFINITELY be returning!!"}
{"text":"I love this little Cafe in my neighborhood. I have been twice now, once for breakfast/brunch and once for more of the lunch menu. Both times..... excellent! Breakfast..... my hubby had \"Meat Grandma\" Country Fried Steak on Biscuits & topped w/ Country Gravy & Eggs. Served w/ Hash browns.  My breakfast.....Build your skillet, I chose onions, jalapeno, tomato, and cheddar cheese. It was amazingly fresh and tasty. Jalapeno was the star of the show! Perfect with the cheddar cheese and egg! Second visit.... lunch.... Hubby got the Sierra Nevada Burger.  Black Angus Chuck Burger topped w/ mixed Greens, Tomato, Red Onions, Applewood Smoked Bacon & Cheddar, he ate it all, quickly! Me, well my lunch was \"Chachos\". French fries with a four cheese sauce, seasoned ground beef and fresh pico de gallo. Probably not the healthiest lunch I have had, but one of the tastiest for sure....  Mountain View Bistro is definitely on the rotation for one of our \"regular spots\""}
{"text":"Kinda disappointed that when the order was take. It seemed like the person was distracted and when I came to pick it up because they wanted to charge $5 for delivery when yelp says $3.99 I saw the person was on the cell phone as she was ringing me up. You would think if they were so good why is it empty at 1:00?  It took th over 10 min to make a falafel wrap and sweet potato fries, that is too long of a ticket time when the shop is empty."}
{"text":"Found this place next to the Target I usually go to. Never really paid attention to what was around to eat since it's usually pretty empty. I saw that they opened up a new place but didn't think much of it. I passed by and picked up a menu. I got home and saw that they did delivery. My friend came over that day and we ordered some burgers. The delivery time was pretty quick. I order a cheeseburger with pepper jack cheese and sweet potato fries and my friend got chicken fingers. They were super friendly and fast! My burger was amazing! I ordered it medium and it was perfect. The fries were pretty bomb too. My friend loved her food as well! I will definitely be coming back to this amazing place! It's the best burger that I have had by my area. They have a breakfast menu and I'm definitely coming back for that."}
{"text":"Friendly service!  The suggestion from Lisa for Basted eggs was spot on the best egg ever!  Chicken Fried Steak Is made fresh. Yummy!"}
{"text":"LOVE the Sierra Nevada Burger. My go-to. This is definitely one of the best burger places in Vegas."}
{"text":"I was able to eat here for breakfast over the weekend and the quality of the food was great. Nice clean place to eat in the North West. I do prefer Bistro's and cafes like this I feel like it's a nice slow down from the Las Vegas environment."}
{"text":"This place was great. Super friendly service from Lisa who gave great recommendations. You need to try the fruit and mint iced tea, it's perfect for summer and seriously refreshing. The food was fresh and delicious. My husband had the Red Rock Burger while I had the eggs and bacon. Give this place a try, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I had a normal breakfast of pancakes, eggs,\"hash browns\" and bacon... there was not 1 thing on my plate that wasn't made by a 10 year old. Pancakes super flat n starchy, bacon microwaved, and eggs were requested over medium n received them cooked all the way through... If I didn't already pay with UberEATS it wouldn't have paid in store. Never giving my money to this place again."}
{"text":"Awesome place. It's very nice small, loving environment. The waiter Lisa is amazing she is so kind. The customer service alone gets them 5 stars. Very clean. They have a chicken and waffle selection on the menu but I wanted French toast. I was able to substitute it out so I am happier than ever...the food did not take very long to take which was amazing because I was starving when I came in...it was delicious very well season. I would totally eat here again."}
{"text":"We came here for breakfast. We were not greeted for a few minutes. There was one family sitting. A lady finally came out from the back to seat us. She seemed very stressed for not really having anyone in the restuarant.   She didn't take our drink order for about 10 minutes after sitting down. She took our food order at the same time.  I noticed another couple walking in and standing there forever as well. They ended up just seating themselves.   We had: The Grandma Meat (really gross name) And the Eggs and Cakes - the pancakes were okay. I had to ask for syrup. And the eggs were cookes as I asked.   They were both decent. There wasn't anything to set them apart from Ihop or Denny's. (Your typical cheap breakfast joints.) That is the best thing about this place--it's cheap.   Overall, it didn't do much for me. It's not high quality food and the wait times are kind of long when they have no one there. The waitress didn't seem to keen on serving people in general."}
{"text":"Great food, love the burgers, sweet potato fries and the omelets. The place is very clean, staff is friendly and prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"I had a very pleasant brunch. Our table of 5 was sat immediately. Every single team member was very nice and accommodating. I ordered the crispy chicken wrap with fries. The chicken was crispy and juicy. The aoli sauce was a nice flavor to the wrap. The veggies in the wrap were fresh and tasty.   We ordered the cinnamon brown sugar biscuits and they were fabulous.   They brought out the food at a good time and it was nice and hot. The food portions are huge and I had leftovers that I will go back to. I highly recommend trying this place out for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.   It looks like they are set up for all food delivery services and seem busy with them too.   Our total came to $80 something.  5 meals, 2 appetizers, 1 coffee, 1 tea, rest water."}
{"text":"Found this cool restaurant in the NW area of Las Vegas. I wanted a delicious salad, but not from a chain restaurant. The Mountain View Bistro had a nice selection of salads to choose from. I've tried the blackened salmon salad, which was phenomenal, and the Caesar salad was not to shabby either. Any of their salads can be made into a wrap for an additional charge.  The restaurant has a bright and cheery look to it. Here you always get service with a smile. Even the cooks are friendly. If you're in the area, be sure to pay them a visit."}
{"text":"Very good quality food.  Nice sized portions.  Clean and affordable.  Basic breakfast and lunch menu. Nothing \"crazy different\", but nice variety.   Not very kid friendly. No children's menu.  No high chair or booster sears.   No beer/wine/liquor."}
{"text":"Just tried their vegetarian burger and I'm in love! Haven't had a been patty taste so good.   I chose the onion rings and they were nice and crispy. Very flavorful. My sister recommended the sweet potatoe fries, I liked the portion size to share.  It's super clean and very trendy. The staff was friendly and the service was fast.  Will come back often ...  love finding holes in the wall restaurants  absolutely recommend!"}
{"text":"I had no idea this place existed, but for the postcard I received in the mail last week. We went there for lunch today, and I was thrilled to see a few vegan options, and thus ordered a veggie burger, which was quite tasty.  The tropical iced tea was wonderful, as well. The service was good. The only negative is that they do not have highchairs, or booster seats for toddlers. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"We held our daughter's wedding at Mountain View Bistro yesterday afternoon. The owners (Davo and his wife), Lisa (waitress, hostess) and Fernando (chef) went over the top to make this a special experience for us! The food was amazing and the service was phenomenal! All of our guests raved about the event! Saying \"thank you\" barely expresses our gratitude for all of your efforts! We truly appreciate your patience, kindness, caring and accommodation of our desires. We hope your Bistro has many years of great success!"}
{"text":"Soooo good!  Great breakfast today!  Food was fresh and  portions were large!  Service was super friendly!  Can't wait to go back and try their amazing burgers!"}
{"text":"I was really excited about this placed but it is currently not open. Site says its still open so that really sucks. i guess ill come bacj some ther time."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good. Remember this is a bistro so food preparation may take longer.  My breakfast companion states the sweet potato fries are the best he ever had.  The prices are very reasonable for the generous portions."}
{"text":"This was the best lunch I've had in a long time! Everything we ordered was spectacular. Chicken Wrap, Breakfast burger, The MV burger, and cinnamon brown sugar briskets. We will definitely be back. We arrived at 1:30pm and we are the only guests here while the crappy chain restaurants across the street had full parking lots.  That' crazy!!!"}
