{"text":"I'm in Pittsburgh at least twice a month and The Proper is my go-to place.  The pizza is very, very good and the bacon candy should be illegal  (in a good way).  The really large draft beer selection is worth the trip by itself."}
{"text":"Great beer selection,  and fantastic pizza.  I keep getting the Carnivore pizza.  It's a little salty with the cured meats but I keep coming back to it...  Can't explain it."}
{"text":"Pizza Proper has BAD customer service. Never got to actually eat.  Arrived at 5:45, was told it would be an hour wait.  Bought a drink at the bar,  stood next to TWO empty tables of 8 that were \"reserved\" for a party at 7:30. After an hour and a half,  we decided to give up and leave.  When we asked to speak to a manager to let them know why we were leaving, the hostess was very rude,  and the manager was even worse. I would NOT recommend the restaurant."}
{"text":"I am a foodie.  I like snobby pizza.  I finally found snobby pizza in Pittsburgh!  Will DEFINITELY be back."}
{"text":"30 craft beers on tap. awesome brick oven pizza...HOMERUN!  What more needs to be said."}
{"text":"First time here and was very enjoyable.   Looking for brunch and was able to get three of us seated right away.  Chicken and waffle was interesting.  Waffle with jalape√±o was good, a little over soaked with syrup. Shredded chicken was unexpected,  ok, rather have a thigh and leg though.   Forest pizza was good, a little doughy.   Surprising for wood fired grill.  Steak and eggs Benedict was excellent.  Steak properly done medium rare, sauce was good with a pleasant hint of lemon. 

Overall, I'll be back."}
{"text":"Loved! The pepper cheddar bread was amazing I loved it so much we went two nights in a row for dinner.  Had the Mediterranean pizza and it was incredible!.  This place filled up quick and the bar was packed but I could see why the food was incredible.  There was a little bit of a wait for pizza but it looked like the entire restaurant was ordering one.  Would recommend and will go back next time in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had in Pittsburgh and since moving to the US. Perfect balance of dough and toppings. Quality ingredients. Great selection of beers. Service very good as well. I look forward to trying other things from their menu in the future, especially since they make most of their stuff from scratch, which is commendable."}
{"text":"You must experience eating and drinking here.
Bacon Candy followed by Margherita pizza, accompanied by Belgian beer. Thats the combo, people. Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere, friendly servers, great food, and it won't break the bank for the quality dinning. It's luxury at an affordable price."}
{"text":"Great beer selection and even better pizza! Don't leave without trying the bacon candy. Loved my arugula salad with lemon shallot vinaigrette and our order of chips and onion dip! Not a huge fan of the seating options (too close together), but lucked out with a solo table. Next time, we'll sit at the bar. Great spot for a pizza before the game!"}
{"text":"Great food. Fantastic atmosphere and an attentive staff made this a great evening stop. The only reason I am not giving them five stars is the watercress in my salad had woody stems. The pizza was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Food: 4/5

Good, but not out of this world. Excellent beer list.

Atmosphere: 3/5

Wouldn't have any complaints if the property wasn't so narrow.

Service: 5/5

No complaints at all. 

Cost: 4/5

Pretty standard for a brick oven pizza joint."}
{"text":"What a great joint to eat at. Great beers, even better pizza, staff was awesome. I think I'll have another beer!!  Recommend this place. First timer. Not the last time though."}
{"text":"Went with a group of 8.  Staff seated us quickly.  Food was prompt and excellent flavor.  I had the Wagyu steak special - cooked to perfection and delicious mashed potatoes.  We also tried fresh chips/dip - tastey.  Candy bacon - excellent pork belly.  The Italian donut dessert was amazing!

Staff was friendly, great service! 

Convenient location near Benedum.  Right across the street from the theater parking lot."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this restaurant late at night while on a business trip expecting just a typical brick oven pizza place. It does feature brick oven pizzas but also includes other fabulous dinner items. This place is AMAZING! The service was great and prices were reasonable but the food was so good. Beyond good! I ordered the pear salad, Margherita pizza, New York strip steak, and beignets. Each dish was prepared excellently and had a unique touch that really sets this restaurant apart from others."}
{"text":"Great pizza, carbonara pasta very good, pasta with clams not so good. Pasta prices  a little high considering it doesn't include a salad and only came with two tiny pieces of very dry hard bread. Will return for the pizza. It was thin and delicious. Service was prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"Excellent! 

My friend and I have always heard good things about this place. Their reputation is no lie. For drinks, we ordered the old fashioned and the stilletos. I absolutely enjoyed my old fashioned and my friend the same. Perfect mixture and had a very strong Rye taste. 

For food, we ordered the Charcuterie Board, Carnivore Pizza, and Banana Bread Pudding. All amazing! Nothing completely outstanding though. The Board was almost like an antipasto but not quite. Just three varieties of meat with bread. The meat was definitely fresh and the bread was soft, with a nice texture. Freshly baked for sure. The Pizza was outstanding. The meat flavor was not overwhelming, the sauce complemented the meat and the crust very nicely. The cheese was just enough to complement the rest of the ingredients rather than overtake the pizza. The bread pudding was perfect. It was light, not heavy at all. There were chunks of bananas in it but there wasn't a strong banana flavor, but kinda savory flavor. It was nice. The bread was cooked just right to have that pudding vibe to it and complemented the chunks of bananas. 

The bartender was awesome! She was soloing the bar with a very busy crowd. But we did not wait a long time and she was always there when we needed it."}
{"text":"Todd was the best waiter and so sociable! The food was so good, the best pizza I've had. Awesome atmosphere and people and food."}
{"text":"I had no idea that this place existed, but saw their sidewalk sign while strolling the cultural district streets on a sunday afternoon and decided to give it a try.  The place was mostly deserted, but the ambience was very city-cool, classy while still casual enough that you can feel comfortable in jeans and a tee shirt.  I was impressed with their selection of craft beers on tap.   Maybe 15-20 total and plenty of great options.  I Ordered the Forest pizza, and I was extremely impressed.  I'm a bit of a pizza snob, and this was an excellent pie, the mushrooms were superb.  All in all, a great option in downtown Pittsburgh and I will definitely be making a return visit."}
{"text":"GREAT PIZZA! Don't read down and waste the time... you just need to go experience it! I am notorious for long and short reviews but at the end of the day... it doesn't matter how long the review is... it comes down to the meal being what the consumer expected and this is a place where they exceed your expecations!

Go!!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit to this restaurant, and we had an awesome experience! Great food, great service. Our waiter, Michael, was very congenial and very attentive to our needs. Highly recommend this restaurant--especially if you're attending a function in the Cultural District."}
{"text":"We went here to celebrate my brother's birthday a few weeks ago. My husband and I had been wanting to try it for a few months and were really excited to finally have a reason to. The food was excellent. The three of us split two pizzas (I think they were around 12in pies? We ordered the margherita and the carnivore pizzas) and we loved them. We got the bacon candy as an appetizer. I'm not a big fan of bacon, but I thought it was okay and the guys ate the whole plate in about 10 minutes, so if you like bacon, I'd say you'd probably like it. I didn't try any beer because I'm pregnant, but both my husband and my brother said the beer was great too. We also had a very good server, who was able to find a nice balance between being attentive and not hovering over us the entire night. 

My only problems with the restaurant were that it was extremely crowded and the menu was a bit pricey. It's a very small restaurant, but they really cram as many people in as they can. I felt like we were eating on top of the tables next to us, and it was difficult to get out of the restaurant because there was so little space to walk between the bar and the tables. Because the restaurant was so crowded, it was very noisy and I sometimes felt like I had to almost shout to be heard. We were repeating ourselves a lot as a result. The prices weren't terrible, given how good the food was, but I did feel like the portion sizes weren't quite big enough to justify how expensive everything was. 

Overall, I'd go here again, but only for special occasions with my husband, and next time we'll definitely be sure to make a reservation."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful spot. The atmosphere with the big chalkboard behind the bar listing the beers on tap, brick walls, and low lighting is inviting and cozy. The wine and beer choices are plenty and so is the menu. You'll be sure to find something you like. The pizza is of course delicious, but I recommend getting an appetizer before the meal as well. There are a lot of unique ones to try."}
{"text":"The bartender was the best. He was extremely energetic and all my food came out quickly.  The food was great and definitely worth stopping at"}
{"text":"kayla and brandon introduced me to oven brick pizza and it's absolutely heavenly.  they are extremely cordial and the ambience is breath taking.  i highly recommend it, either stag or on a date.  if you pass this place up you made a mistake - take the time to enjoy the crew and their creations.  your taste buds will never feel so rewarded.  

-james s."}
{"text":"Excellent food great craft beer selection and our server Jason rocked! Will definitely be on our itinerary next time we are in the \"Burgh\" for a game!"}
{"text":"This place is incredible!  The beer selection is massive.  I couldn't decide on just one and was psyched that they offer beer flights so I was able to try four different options.  The bacon candy appetizer was something very unique and absolutely delicious....I've been dreaming about it   :)   Loved the Mediterranean pizza...perfect combination of flavors and their crust is done right. The owner came over to say hello and see if we needed anything and the hostess and staff were all very friendly.  Love to see their commitment to making ingredients in house and sourcing local products. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place surpassed all expectations. First of all, our server, Dwight, was friendly and charming without all that smarmy waiter-speak that is so common now. Everything he recommended was fantastic. We had chilled melon soup that was cool and refreshing, garnished with a berry compote. This was followed by Spinach Ricotta Dumplings, light and creamy and perfectly served with fresh focaccia - it was heaven in the mouth. The pizza bianca was also great. For dessert we shared a lemon semifreddo that was delicious. We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Great beer selection.  They have lots of good craft beer on tap.  I came for a beer.  I would recommend this place for that.  I had lamb stew and it was fine, but didn't have a lot of flavor.  Atmosphere is great and the staff is friendly and knowledgeable."}
{"text":"We were busy all through the evening so we got in at 10:20p on a Tuesday. We almost expected to be turned away since they close at 11, but we were showed to a table, given the pizza and drinks menu, and promptly greeted by the nicest, friendliest, most efficient waitress, Tiffany. I got the maple old fashioned, he got a beer flight, we shared the Pesto and Carnivore pizzas (can't wait for leftovers tomorrow). Excellent food, excellent service. We had class and work all day so this was the perfect end to our anniversary. Thanks for making our second (his fifth) visit just as great as our first! Definitely coming back earlier in the evening for that bacon candy."}
{"text":"Very nice and informed staff. Excellent beer selection with many local brews to choose from. Also really like the beers being written on small chalk boards with cool pictures accompanying the names. Whoever draws/writes them is very talented. Oh and the candied bacon is hot fire."}
{"text":"I met some friends here on my first proper trip to Pittsburgh, and let me tell you, it did not disappoint! From start to finish the staff was SO accommodating, especially our amazing server Tyler S. He gave us some amazing food recommendations and was very patient while he checked in on us consistently during our 3 hour visit. The food was delicious and we were able to have all of our picky eaters satisfied. We will definitely be back. Thank you Proper House and Tyler for helping making our experience so satisfying!"}
{"text":"Everything was amazing. The food was tasty, surprisingly upper caliber for bar food. You can't go wrong with the Duck Wings. Just the right amount of crispy with a very gentle sweet-spicy Thai dipping sauce. The drinks were uber strong (awesome) and the service was upbeat and positive. Definitely a 5-star experience. Would go again and again!!"}
{"text":"Great bartenders and drinks! The pizza was okay, but nothing special. The owner wasn't welcoming at all and rather rude."}
{"text":"Proper, you're addicting! I want to eat here each time I'm in the cultural district. 

The pizza is fantastic and the bacon candy is the stuff dreams are made of!  Some of the pies are seasonal like the Pig & Fig which is absolute dynamite."}
{"text":"Good beer list and yummy food.  We had a party of nine and ordered apps and three different pizzas.  Potato pizza was so good.  Service was great and efficient."}
{"text":"Our favorite restaurant when visiting Pittsburgh. Pizza is outstanding and excellent craft beer selection. Jason has taken good care of us for the past 4 years. Make sure to try the bacon candy!"}
{"text":"Propers is truly the most fun place to go to before a game or play.  We love to sit at the pizza bar and watch Troy, better know as the \"master and Robert make the most delicious pizzas ever.  They should charge a cover charge.  Although, all the food is outstanding and they have a great beer and drink menu, it is the people who keep bringing us back. Sean will great you at the door, Julie will make sure you well taken care of and if you are lucky enough to meet Chef Jerome you night will be complete.  Perfect date night place.  We got our son and his girlfriend a gift certificate for Christmas.  Try the Mediterranean pizza with the house salad - it is enough for two. You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza place downtown! The pizza is amazing and the house salad is my favorite! Best salad ever! I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Came here based on Yelp rating.

The ambiance was great. Small, rustic, with faint smell of the roaring wood-fired oven.

The food was very good. My wife and I got margherita and sopressato pizzas, respectively. Both were delicious. (So delicious, in fact, that several days later when we were strapped to find another late meal near our hotel, we carried out the same order.)

Service was good. A bit hands-off due to it being end of the night, but attentive enough."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza with a very good selection of beers. Like so many places in Pittsburgh, it's great that they have a lot of microbrews on tap, but I wish there was a little more variety. Victory, Troegs, Rogue, these are all good, but there are plenty of other exciting beers out there.

That said, my pizzas have been terrific, wood-fired deliciousness. Aside from the wood-burning pizza oven, the atmosphere is fine - not remarkable. Service has been friendly and well-executed both times I've been there. My only complaint is that it's so darn popular; impossible to get a table on a weekend when there's a show!"}
{"text":"Damn this pizza is good. Perfect size, great tasting dough, plenty of variety. It's a little expensive, but it's a nice restaurant, not a typical pizza place. All in all, worth it!"}
{"text":"I thought the bar and the atmosphere were great. Do yourself a favor though and eat before you get there. The pizza was okay if you were going there to drink for 2-3 hours, watch a couple of games and then got hungry and had to eat something. Do not go just for the pizza. 

We stayed at the William Penn and googled best pizza in pitt. There were enough good reviews to warrant a visit and I was thirsty!! The bar must be set very low for good pizza in Pittsburgh. The two stars were for the beer selection only. We tried the bacon candy. Overcooked bacon with brown sugar? My daughter was impressed, me so-so. I always order the Margherita pie on my first visit to any pizza joint. That way you can taste the sauce, cheese and crust without meat and other flavoring interfering. This is chain restaurant pizza a best. Then came dessert, ugh! My daughter always gets dessert when I treat her to dinner. Triple layered chocolate cake with peanut butter filling I think? We got two forks so I dove in. The cake must have been baked last week. You couldn't stick a fork in it!! The cake would crumble and it got harder deeper into the cake. No wonder they buried it under peanut butter, chocolate syrup and some crunchy something or other. A third of the way through my daughter bit into a piece of plastic wrap. 

Our server came over, apologized, removed the cake from the table and the charge off our bill. He also bought me one of my beers. Once is enough."}
{"text":"Bacon candy for the win!! We got here right as a show started so it was decently slow. Our server (Kyle) was pretty amazing. Our food came out quick and the taste was far past expectations. I expected that the non pizza menu might be subpar but I could not have been more suprised. The ravioli was really fantastic. The portions were large but not overwhelming. Overall a great experience and I'll absolutely recommend dining here. 

Again - BACON CANDY!!!"}
{"text":"This place has the best aroma of any restaurant I've ever been to!
I was there on a Saturday night and it was packed, but we were seated shortly. The pizza was great  -- a great menu with lots of options. The vibe is fantastic! 
The only downside was that we were seated fairly closely to the neighboring table, but that seems to be the case in a lot of downtown restaurants, and it was no big deal- we were all having a great time!"}
{"text":"Craving pizza, especially of the brick oven variety, led me to a yelp search for the highest rated area pizza restaurants.  Proper Brick Oven & Tap Room came up in my searches consistently, among a few others, so I checked out the menus, prices, locations, and reviews.  Ultimately, I ended up going to Proper, because the menu appealed to me.  

It definitely lived up to my expectations.  The food was excellent.  I had the house salad (split with my dining partner), and we shared the Black & Gold pizza, which was surprisingly delicious (surprising because I was a little skeptical at first about having potatoes and beets on my pizza).  The service was great, and the ambiance was exactly what I needed:  not too loud or boisterous but lively enough to feel like the place can draw fans.

I'm not a beer drinker, but they seemed to have an extensive list of beers, and the wine offerings and other cocktails seemed appealing too.  I had a chardonnay that I liked very much.

I recommend Proper Brick Oven & Tap Room for those who like pizza but want variety and are looking for a gourmet touch."}
{"text":"We had a full party of 10, and the service was wonderful. We had an issue with one of our food, being a pizza we ordered being a lot more spicy than we expected. It was quickly taken care of by our waiter who immediately gave us a replacement pizza.

The food and drink was amazing, and our waiter was very quick and attentive on checking up if there was anything we needed or if we needed any refills. Definitely an experience to come back to! 

Our waiter's name is Kyle by the way."}
{"text":"I'm starting off by saying that this is the second time that my fianc√©e and I have been here and the service is always great and very courteous. We decided to go down during the Pittsburgh International Jazz Festival and the best thing about the venue is the selection of beers, and of course the pizza. We tried the Finocchio (comes topped with goat cheese). It's between Proper and Mercurio's for best gourmet pizza in the burgh, but they're slighted edged by Mercurio's when it comes to topping pairings. Proper is truly a restaurant and a bar where Mercurio's offers old-world charm. I still love Proper and it's a standout amongst the prices venues in the Cultural District."}
{"text":"Great staff! The hostess and waitress were so nice. The space is cozy/urban. The draft selection is excellent and the small wine list has some nice choices. We shared the fried green tomatoes, a margarita pizza and a Mediterranean pizza and a house salad. Everything was delicious! The salad greens were very fresh. I'm looking forward to returning to try some of the other tempting offerings."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Love the Counter height tables that can be reserved for up to 10. Food was delicious. I had the roasted beet & arugula salad. Family had the carnivore oven roasted pizza. Great service!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on a weekday. Wonderful food and wait staff.  Hidden gem in the city.  Will be going back."}
{"text":"We came here after seeing a play at the Byham. Food was great. Candied bacon and pizza were both impeccable. Desserts weren't anything special. Overall a good dining experience."}
{"text":"Great pizza, 30 Draft beers . what more is there! Oh great service. Had the forest pizza it was great"}
{"text":"Great oven fired pizza and very good craft beer selection. Eat here at least once a week!"}
{"text":"I stopped in with my boyfriend for dinner. The atmosphere is quite nice, but the waiter made me feel like a little kid. I understand that we are young, but I've never got that impression anywhere else. Perhaps he was just trying to hard to be friendly. Aside from that, the service was good.

I ordered half a house salad and the minestrone soup, and I enjoyed my meal. I usually don't eat my salad with dressing, but the white balsamic that came with the salad was pretty good. I also liked the presentation of the salad. Soup was decent too. My boyfriend ordered the Mediterranean pizza, which was pretty good, too."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town! Amazing beer selection as well as I can always find a sour on tap."}
{"text":"This pizza shop tucked away in downtown Pittsburgh is in a great location and has its own private lot (extra pay). There is limited seating but the wait wasn't too long. The pot pie and pizzas are delicious and I highly suggest you order it! The atmosphere is very cozy for those cold winter nights and pairs nicely with matching cutlery!"}
{"text":"Place is nice,    Great draft beer selection.    We had outstanding service.   The maple bacon candy was out of this world.     We ordered  the margarita pizza & carnivore.   Unfortunately the pizza to us was just average.  We were kinda disappointed.   It wasn't that it was bad, just bland.   The San marzano sauce (which I personally use myself to make homemade pizza with) tasted straight out of the can with no seasoning.   The mozzarella didn't have a lot of flavor either.     The carnivore was just ok too, but must add that the homemade sausage was really good & the crust was decent!    We want to give this place more stars, but a place where the pizza should be a shining star!  It's just a glimmer, compared to the other fantastic pizza places in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Small restaurant that was surprisingly busy. Service was OK but they ran out of clean water glasses for a little while. Wine comes in huge goblets that look kind of comical. Food itself was good, very thin crust pizza. Would eat here again."}
{"text":"We went fairly early on a Friday so that we could be seated before the dinner crowd. I had a half-size house salad, carnivore pizza, and chocolate pecan tart. My friend ordered the forest pizza and the apple streusel cheesecake. The food and service were excellent throughout. The only slight negatives were when we walked in and when we left - the two hostesses seemed to be having a bad day and were not pleasant or welcoming like the other staff that we encountered. 8.5/10, I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"Went to Proper for pizza and beers around 5, and they were already pretty packed. We split a pizza and salad, both of which we're tasty, despite downtown level prices and portions. The crust has a great doughy chew despite being thin/brick oven, and I was a big fan of the carnivore toppings. 

Have to dock one star for service and one for beer price/selection. They only had two bartenders handling a large bar (beer/wine/cocktails) plus getting orders for the wait staff. Our bartender was friendly and efficient, but we waited over ten minutes each time we finished a round, and had to skip our last beer to get the check and run to a ballgame. He was absolutely swamped. 

Beer list was long but unimpressive. Focusing on regional beers is great, but four Yards taps is four too many, especially at $6/7 a pour. I'll pay $7 for something brought in from the West Coast etc, but not for middle of the road regional beers. Worth a second visit for a downtown pizza craving, especially if they add happy hour pricing."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Sunday for a drink and pizza...got the Black and Gold and Ocean pizza, both were delicious!  Our waiter was Todd, he was amazing! We are in from out of town and he told us some great spots to check out and made the experience!"}
{"text":"One of the best pizzas I've had in a long time. Got the Bianca with bacon added. Amazing. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"The thing about Italian food is its cheesy and yummy!!! The yelpers led us to this small yet beautiful and cozy place. 

The restaurant has a sit in bar with a TV to watch which I found very attractive and they do serve food at the bar table!! I felt the place was bit congested because only one way traffic is allowed at certain parts making the customer bit uncomfortable. 

We ordered a Mediterranean pizza. Very much liked it coz of thin crust and just the right amount of cheese and seasoning!!! 

Will definitely visit next time to try out other menu thought the options are limited to 3 for vegetarians!!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and food. We had three young kids including a baby, and our waiter was very attentive and very fast with service. We ordered the Marguerita and Bianco pizzas and they were delicious. The salads were also good, especially the fried green tomato salad. Nice atmosphere. A great place to grab lunch before seeing a show."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to add this review for a few weeks after going for my wifed birthday.

First for drinks. Whoever is selecting beer for the restaurant need commendation. Awesome selection, equal to or better than Urban Tap. The only place I can think of with better drafts is Caliente. As for the cocktails, I can only say I was disappointed in the Hophatten. Why the cocktail had ice in it after its already watered down with beer is beyond me.

We started with the bacon candy and house chips. Would recommend bacon candy. I liked the house chips dip, wish the chips were fresh made in house. 

My wife had the Forrest and I had the Soppreseta. We both LOVED the Soppreseta, it alone is worth coming for. The mushrooms on the Forrest were also excellent, it was just that the Soppreseta was so much more flavorful. Crust was very tasty. 

Overrall would HIGHLY recommend, this may be my new favorite pizza place"}
{"text":"I dream about this place. This is my husband's and my standing restaurant for date night. Great food, amazing beer selection, and awesome staff. This is the standard to which I hold all other brick oven restaurants."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum! Delicious brick oven pizza and great craft beer selection. Also was liking the spinach/ricotta dumplings which were a new twist on dumplings for me. Wish they were a little more exotic on their ingredients. The margarita was excellent but not super special. However I've been spoiled by great Chicago pizza places, so maybe a slightly biased opinion. That was the reason for the 4 stars instead of 5. Prices are reasonable. Great ambiance in the location, will definitely return."}
{"text":"We went to Proper Brick Oven before a show at the Benedum Center, and we were not pleased. First, we went in and the music was booming. We had to request that it could get turned down, and the waitress only put it down a little bit. Second, we ordered a hummus tray, and expected the lemon mint hummus, and it was broccoli. In addition, when my friend's pasta came out, she had to decline, for it looked like maggots. Also, my other friend's clams had a horrific stench. They both sent back their meals, and only one got a new meal. On our friend's bill, they only took of a beer. The tables were very close, so we could hear everyone's conversations. Is Proper Brick Oven just another Cultural District fad restaurant? Will it soon fade away? Yelp readers, unite!"}
{"text":"Pasta was divine! Great atmosphere and service . I want to come back to try the fried chicken."}
{"text":"Great beer selection from many craft brewers.  $9 flights.  Great menu, brick oven pizza, great service.  Good for pre or post theater or ball game."}
{"text":"I've been traveling to Pittsburgh for a few years now and I wish I knew about this place sooner! I love brick oven pizza and Proper did not disappoint. I shared the beer mussels, and the carnivore and pesto pizzas with a friend and everything was really, really good! The beer selection was equally as good. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Ambiance: Clean, stylish, and modern yet comfortable.  There are a few large tables in the front and the back with smaller tables in a row with bench style seating against the wall in the middle where the long bar is.  Chalkboard tap list over the bar is nice.  Trendy enough for a nice date spot, yet relaxed enough a place to just sit and grab a beer.

Drinks: Extensive beer list with fairly impressive offerings.  Price range for beers is 6-8 bucks.  Nice wine selection and craft cocktails as well.  Would like to try the Maggie's spiced rum Mojito sometime, though last night just had beer.

Food: Excellent all around.  We had the chips and ricotta spinach ball as our two appetizers and then shared the forest and carnivore pizzas.  Their pizza is wood-fired, Italian style thin crust.  Everything was super tasty, especially the forest pizza which had mushrooms and balsamic vinaigrette as well as caramelized onions.  Last time I was here I tried the bacon candy which was an awesome app.

Service:  Our waitress was very knowledgeable, attentive, and happy.  Food delivery was well timed.  No complaints here.

Overall:  Unassuming from the outside, this is a gem of a place in the cultural district with a great beer selection, trendy yet unpretentious ambiance, and awesome Italian style pizza.  As far as Italian style pizza in Pittsburgh goes, I would rate Proper Brick Oven's a half notch below Piccolo Forno and slightly above Mercurio's or Dinnette."}
{"text":"Decadent bacon, best pizza.  Not quite as melt in your mouth as Italy but just how I like it. The Greco was amazing, and you could eat it without a knife and fork.  If I was wrongly convicted of a crime and sentenced to die, I'd order a whiskey and this pizza and feel just fine."}
{"text":"Eh, okay. Very much overpriced. Not kid friendly. Staff was not especially hospitable. Could not order lunch from the lunch menu, at 2pm on a Sunday (maybe Sunday's are exempt?) Pizza was pretty good, pasta was not that great. Good beer selection. Overall, alright."}
{"text":"The atmosphere within the restaurant was amazing. Great mix of ages and the ambiance was great! The decor was modern and eye catching. Food was amazing, I got the Greco pizza and the lamb on the pizza was different and something I've never tried. Service was impeccable. The servers were friendly and the attention to detail was very clear. If you are looking to try something new, you should definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"The pizza was tasty! I had the carnivore The place is TOO small! Sit against the wall, unless you enjoy being run into, while you eat. The atmosphere is far too hipster for a pizza place. It's pricy, but not outrageous. Parking is a hassle, but that's downtown Pittsburgh for you."}
{"text":"Loved this place!  The bacon candy was awesome (its bacon, kinda hard to mess it up)!  The star of the show was the wood fire pizza for sure...im a pizza junky and i would put this among my all time favorites."}
{"text":"Visiting The area for work & found this place looking on Yelp, it did not disappoint! Pizza was delicious! Loved the thin crust and the carnivore meat lover toppings were to die for. Sat at the pizza bar and the guys cooking the pizzas were very friendly. Would most definitely visit again if ever back in the area."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant with a group of 4 and we all had excellent dinners. The pizza was delicious and the service was very good. Only letdown was the eggnog bread pudding, which smelled and tasted like bubble gum."}
{"text":"It was our second visit to the Proper Brick Oven pub. We had a lovely, simple dinner - I had a salad and my husband had pasta. There was a good selection of craft beers. The service and the food were excellent.  What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Proper was a great start to a week long stay in Pittsburgh.  The Mahi - Mahi was incredible and Mike made some delicious drinks to go with it. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Bacon Candy was all it was cracked (or should I say crumbled?) up to be.  Halibut and pizza were excellent at our table.  Fried chicken was good, crust was flavorful and crumbly.  Good but not the very best chicken I've ever had.  Beverages were tasty for all.  Great slate of options.  May go back just to try more of those!"}
{"text":"One of my new Pgh faves! The menu is unique and inventive, as well as ever evolving, but with enough traditional options that even the pickiest of eaters will be able to find something to suit their tastes. We (party of 4) dropped by without a reservation on a very busy Friday evening, and were still seated within 20 minutes. In spite of the crowd, the entire staff was very friendly and moderately attentive. Drinks were also delicious and generously poured! Can't say enough good things. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in the city. Think crust with just the right amount of topping. Perfectly cooked every time. The salads are good, too. Only ordered regular menu food a few times and was just ok. Stick with the pizza."}
{"text":"WOW!  This place was REALLY good.  Started out with the bacon candy!  LOVED it.  Bacon cooked in the pizza oven with brown sugar and pepper...just enough to enhance the flavor of the bacon.  Highly recommended.  Then we shared a BLT salad, again it was surperb.  The spinach was fresh, bacon was spot on and not drowned in the vingerette dressing.  We also shared the Forest pizza...this was at our waiters suggested...I was hesitant as I don't really like mushrooms, but this was good.  The mushrooms were carmalized so they did not over power the rest of the pizza.  By far the BEST pizza crust...it was thin but not paper thin, had flavor and was crispy."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Proper several times so far and my experience has been mixed.

First, seating.  The wait time to eat here is generally long (greater than 1 hour even if you show up at 5:00) which would be acceptable except for the fact that their seating system is terrible.  You show up, your name gets penciled in on a paper list, and then you are handed a business card so that you can call them back some arbitrary time into the wait period to check-up on the table status.  

Having to call the restaurant myself after I've already checked in is annoying enough, but the last time I ate here we called the hostess, returned to the restaurant because she informed us that our table was ready, checked in with the hostess in person, and then watched as another party the same size as ours further down on the wait list that checked in after we did was seated at our table by a separate employee who was apparently not in communication with the hostess who had since disappeared.

When we complained to the hostess when she reappeared that we had already spoken to her and were supposed to have been seated, she said that the table was taken and that it would be another 30 minute wait.  There is no reason for restaurant seating to be this needlessly convoluted and prone to failure.  We were seated as soon as another table cleared up, but it's things like this that make me never return to a restaurant.  They are in desperate need of a seating app that will text you when your table is ready and manage seating electronically.

Now, the food.  The crust is good as are the toppings, and all of the pizzas I've eaten here have been well balanced and tasty.  The appetizers I've sampled have been good as well.  Tough to say if the food is worth the wait though.

The beer selection is impressive, but I wish the bar didn't take up so much floor space in the restaurant because everything from aisles to seating is cramped, and if you're sitting across from somebody you're going to be stepping on their shoes the entire time."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat before a show at the Benedum. It has such great ambience and the wait times are never insane. If you can't get a table, there are two bars to sit at and they'll serve you food at those. Awesome pizza and if you're not into that they have other foods too! Plus, they always have changing specials and desserts. Tons of different unique beers on tap and of course the regional favorites like Coors Light. It's just a great overall restaurant and in the dozen times I've been there I've never had a bad experience. Downtown restaurants tend to be pretty hectic, but I feel like this one handles the craziness and just lets you have a really good meal."}
{"text":"We were in the mood for Italian and stumbled upon this lovely place! The atmosphere is great, trendy but not pretentious. It is not large so I can see it getting very busy, but we went late on a Tuesday and were seated immediately.  The hostess greeted us with a welcoming smile. 

Our server was tied up with a large party, so another server brought us waters while we decided on drinks. This was a great touch! It's the little things that matter to me because customer service is a dying art. When our server, Lee, approached us, she was genuine and answered all of our questions. We went with a beer flight to share which was a great way to sample some of their MANY draft beers. 

We started with a pepperoni roll and Cheese platter. The bread was definitely homemade. The pepperoni roll was dense and flavored perfectly with Italian herbs and spices. It was paired with a house marinara that was awesome. The cheese platter came with a homemade fresh mozzarella drizzled with balsamic glaze and fresh basil, a deliciously creamy burrata, and a wonderful grana Padano topped with lemons soaked in honey. We were fighting over the last bits of cheese! Being kind of full from the starters, we opted for a pizza Bianca for dinner. We added pepperoni and basil. What a treat! When it was delivered, we thought we won't eat all of this, but somehow we managed.  We took a piece of homemade pineapple cheesecake back to the hotel for dessert. What a great decision! It was creamy, sweet, and we wished we had more. 

Overall, this was a fantastic dining experience. The hostess' greeting, our awesome server (which is rare these days), great beer, and truly delicious food."}
{"text":"Pizza and charcuterie are amazing. The beer and wine options are small, but still a good variety. Good atmosphere and friendly wait staff. Can't wait to go back again next time I'm in Pittsburgh. Although... Go Flyers!"}
{"text":"Finally got the attention at the bar to get a drink and menus. I guess i blend in.... Ordered the carnivore and it wAs delicious with nice brick oven smokiness.  I left two slices un- devoured.  Good beer selection too.  I would go back.  Minor nit-picks not worthy of posting for a first visit."}
{"text":"While wandering through Pittsburgh along the Allegheny River, I pulled up Yelp to find a pizza place nearby, and I was lucky enough to be very close to Proper Brick Oven and Tap Room in the heart of downtown.  This restaurant is less than a year old, but the good users of Yelp who had already eaten there definitely steered me in the right direction with their positive reviews.  When I walked in I was greeted by the warmth of the beautiful, working wood-fire pizza oven and cozy tables.   I was impressed as soon as I saw their beer list, which had a lot of seasonal variety, and it continued when I tried their house-made potato chips.  The soft chips were pretty good, and I really liked the dip they were served with.  I don't always get too into dip, but its mixture of onion, chive, and garlic was quite delicious.

My wife and I each ordered our own pizza as they come in a personal size at Proper Brick Oven and Tap Room.  Mine was the carnivore and her's was the margherita, and, after sampling each other's, we both agreed that the carnivore is the way to go.  The meat was savory and fresh and really took the pizza to another level.  Still, both pizzas had a nice soft and airy crust with a slight glaze that I believe was olive oil.  I also really enjoyed the flavorful sauce at Proper Brick Oven and Tap Room.  The cheese was probably my least favorite part as it was a creamy-type of mozzarella that was almost nearing a ricotta-type of texture, but it is just my personal preference that is against that kind of cheese texture.  It worked out well for me that there wasn't a lot of cheese on the pizza as I preferred the taste of the crust, sauce, and toppings.  Overall, I am extremely happy that I stumbled upon the Proper Brick Oven and Tap Room and would recommend it to anyone in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Pizza and craft beer are two of my absolute favorite things. Knowing this, my boyfriend scored major brownie points by choosing Proper as the location for my surprise birthday dinner. We arrived in the middle of the pre-show rush crowd (it's located in the heart of the Cultural District), so we found room to sit at the bar while we waited for a table, but just decided to eat there instead. After all, we had a very friendly bartender at our beck and call who was happily allowing us to sample any of the 30 drafts that we wanted and we could watch the Pens game right in front of us. Plus, we probably got even faster service that way.

I really like the atmosphere of this place. Casual yet sophisticated. Modern yet a bit retro (mason jar hanging lights, for example). Overall, just very comfortable and not at all pretentious. After all, it's basically an upscale pizza and beer (and I guess wine) place. There are a few TV's at the bar, but nothing that would distract you while you were dining at a nearby table. And they kept their own music playing the whole time, even during the Pens game, which was awesome because I feel like it could've been a playlist made up from my very own collection.

We decided to order two pizzas so we could share both of them, knowing full well that we would probably have an entire pizza left over. (Leftover pizza is never a bad thing, in my opinion.) We went with the Bianca and the Mediterranean, which were both delicious. I prefer my crust more on the soft and chewy side, which is often hard to do when cooking a pizza in a wood fired oven, but both pizzas came out perfectly done. Not undercooked at all, but not an overwhelming amount of char. Simply delicious. The only other thing we had were some house-made potato chips as an appetizer, which were decent, but not the best I've ever had. I'm looking forward to trying the black pepper bacon candy the next time I eat there.

I have absolutely nothing negative to say about this place. Since their menu is slated to change seasonally, I can't wait to go back and try some new things, even though there were already several things on the menu this time around that I just didn't have the room/time to try. And I just might have to try scoring a warm and cozy seat at the pizza bar in front of the oven this winter!"}
{"text":"This place hit it out the park. Our party of 7 took up their 7 seats at one of their bars and the waitress was so sweet, informative, and happy to be there. Love the fact that they use San Marzano tomatoes. Great pricing. Try bacon candy and margherita pizza."}
{"text":"Amazing versatile spot!!!! I have been in Pittsburgh for work for almost 4 months so saying I've tried out the restaurants in the area is an understatement. 

Food is obviously made from very fresh ingredients (healthy flatbread? Yes please). BEST salad I've ever had: their house salad. 30 beers on tap that rotate in a good way to mix it up. Fantastic wine list and cocktails. 

Filling a niche that needs to be filled in the area. Great food and drink in a cool yet not too pretentious vibe. Great for anything from a business dinner to a drink w a friend post workout.  

You are welcome,  Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Came here after a game at PNC park and enjoyed the bacon candy appetizer and an amazing carnivore pizza to follow.... excellent!! The reviews aren't wrong - this place was phenomenal!"}
{"text":"I went here last night for the first time. I got the margherita pizza and it is the best I've had in town. My dinner-mates liked their food too. I liked the atmosphere, being an old brick building that's long and skinny. I was comfortable and had a good meal.

Excellent place for pizza, from a brick oven and delicious!"}
{"text":"I was in Pitt for a conference and went to Proper from the Yelp reviews- the only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because of service. The food is awesome and the drink selection fantastic. Since I was alone, I sat at the bar and unfortunately was ignored by the 4 staff behind the bar even though the bar and tables were less than 50% capacity... I ended up borrowing menus from a person near me and then only got attention when I raised my hand to ask for a drink - after waiting about 10 minutes! Seemed the bar staff was very attentive to the other parties at the bar, but for some reason I was overlooked. It just may have been the person assigned to serve me specifically though, as I overheard one of the bar staff (he seemed to be 'in charge') say \" I really have no idea where he is, he keeps disappearing\". Overall- worth the trip and the $ needed to eat there, but be prepared to be a bit assertive to get the service you need."}
{"text":"A really nice place. We were visiting Pittsburgh a few weeks ago and stopped in here (ok, planned to stop in here is more like it) for lunch. I had a great salad and some amazing pizza. My husband had two flights of beer (with a little help from me). Everything was great. Service was above average. Would probably be annoying at a too-crowded/too-noisy level at night, because it's kind of narrow inside. But perfect for a slow afternoon."}
{"text":"Friendly, accommodating staff. We ordered 2 pizzas for 4 people. The food was delicious and would definitely go back. I highly recommend it if you're headed downtown!"}
{"text":"Great food, amazing beer selection and given the game-day crowd, it was easy fairly easy to get seated.  You need to check this place out."}
{"text":"The ambiance, food, price, beer selection, and especially the service were all wonderful. And there is a reasonably priced parking garage across the street. We had a great time! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Had the Carnivore pizza. It was very good and fresh (coming from someone near NYC too). Great selection of beers as well. Would love to go back next time I am in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Came for brunch and it was amazing. Even my kids liked it, though they don't have a kids menu. The brioche French toast was delicious"}
{"text":"The 3 piece spinach ricotta ravioli/pasta appetizer was the perfect start to our meal.  We had 1/2 BLT and spring greens with a lemon vinegarette salads -  the whole size would have been a meal.

The BLT salad had peppered bacon, roasted tomatoes with caramelized onions over spinach ... DELICIOUS.

I had the pesto pizza ... it was good but a little too much oil.  The chicken with rainbow chard was very good.  The featured fish came out on a huge plate and looked like the chef forgot to add the potato or vegetables based on the amount of white space on the plate.  The other meals were on appropriate size dishes.  The fish was good although small portion.

The red cake was beautiful, moist, & definitely share-able.

Didn't have room but want to go back to try the mushroom bisque.

They take reservations for parties of more than six people."}
{"text":"BACON CANDY!!!!!  You need to taste this stuff.   It made our night.  Pork belly served warm with carmelized  something and some kind of pepper to give it a sweet and spicy kick.  This app made the entire dinner.  We also had the Forest pizza which had mushrooms, carmelized onions and fontina cheese.   Thin pizza with a fat crust that was soft and chewy on the inside and crisp outside.   

The miss here was that this place charges $2 if you want your drink 'on the rocks'. Check out the photo of our check.  Bartender said that when they put ice in your Makers Mark, they are charging you for a larger pour.  What????  Sorry Proper - never heard that before.   Charge me 8$ for the drink or $10 for the drink, I don't care.   But don't charge me for the drink and tag on $2 for 'rocks'.  Bad dining  experience."}
{"text":"I think I will remember this pizza margherita for a while.. It was so good! Tomatoes, mozzarella, basil and dough were fresh, tasty, delicious! Me and boyfriend literally finished a pie (12\", 8 slices) in like 15 minutes. We did compliment the guy at the wood fire oven and he was really happy.

Service is quick and nice. Place is cozy, smell wood fire, and it has nice booths and seating areas, mostly indoor. Few tables outside."}
{"text":"Yummmmm.  Looked for a good place for dinner and good craft beers in Pittsburgh on Yelp and found this little gem.  Great ambiance, fabulous pizza , large selection of good local brews and fabulouse service from Jason.  We enjoyed the Bianca and Pesto Pizzas with the Proper chips and a couple great beers.  Will go again the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Great establishment with ample. Parking choices nearby.  Had a family lunch and was impressed with how the children were treated.  Great service and quality food."}
{"text":"Excellent choice for pizza in downtown Pittsburgh. If you want wood fired pizza in the area there isn't a better option in town."}
{"text":"We were a group of 12 people who got there at 11:10 pm friday night, surprisingly we got denied to be served with given reason of \"Kitchen closes at 11:30\" although it was 20 mins to 11:30. We took our business to another location nearby but definitely it was not a smart thing for a restaurant to turn down a party of twelve!
To the manager: the girl at  the reception has an attitude, detrimental for your biz bro."}
{"text":"A wonderful place for great beer and great food. I ended up getting a flight of four local beers since I'm from out of town, and was so happy with my choices. The bartender was very helpful in recommending some as well. I could NOT decide what to get for dinner though! Everything looked so delicious. I went with a pesto pizza (I wanted leftovers that would keep in the hotel minifridge) and it was good- pretty traditional, but the wood fired element made it perfectly charred and crispy."}
{"text":"Little known place downtown with some of the best italian food in the city. Would recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"Got the scallop risotto, homemade chips and candied bacon and all were excellent. We sat next to the pizza oven and they looked great! Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Came here after a show at the Benedum Center.  We got 2 pizzas and some drinks.  The pizzas weren't too bad but nothing special."}
{"text":"More of a 4.5. We visited on a Friday evening (around 8?) and did not have to wait for a table, which was nice. They have a nice variety of beers and wines to choose from. We decided to share the pesto pizza and the brisket Mac and cheese. They were served nice and hot. Delicious! The service was very attentive. We wish we could have tried dessert but we were too full! The only reason they do not get 5 stars is because of the restaurant seating options. Be advised if you choose bar seating, you may end up sitting in front of the brick oven which is very hot! You could feel the heat from the oven as soon as you walk in."}
{"text":"The Proper Brick Oven is a great place in downtown to visit. They are known for their brick oven pizza and craft drinks. Cocktails are delicious and they have an expansive selection of craft brews to choose from at any given time. 

The pizza is all that we have explored to this point. They have a great selection of other food, but we have yet to venture away as we can't get enough! The Margherita, Mediterranean, and Forest are amazing, with the Forest definitely being our favorite. The combination of mushrooms with the balsamic reduction sauce is incredible! Each time we have been, it is usually in the evening hours after dinner. We frequent Proper right before or after shows downtown and each time it has been quite busy. We have not waited longer than about 20 minutes to be seated. The space can feel very tight when they are busy, and this can be a turn off at times. People are bumping into each other and waiter's/waitresses are struggling to get by people and chairs from dining tables. Parking can be difficult as well as street parking is limited. A garage is probably your best bet. Definitely a place to check out if you love brick oven pizza!"}
{"text":"Went with coworkers and ordered some salads and pizzas.  I could easily eat a whole especially if I was being a pizza glutton. For four people, we ordered 3 pizzas and 2 salads and an appetizer - there were a few slices left and we all left stuffed!  The crust is a really good balance - not too thin, but the ring of crust had enough heft to it to hold it straight. B

Bianca - the stand out!!! typically not a big fan of white pizzas, but this was fantastic the ricotta and mozzarella together was sublime. And the crust had a slight oily and garlicky flavor to it. 

Carnivore - pretty standard with \"all de meats\" but still good

Margherita - also pretty standard but still good 

Bacon candy - delicious, crispy, lean and sweetly spicy. Nice....

Amalfi and BLT salads - both generous, fresh, light dressing"}
{"text":"I've been back to Proper a couple of times now. The mushroom pizza is the best. My teenage son even scarfed down the cold leftovers the next day and was thrilled. It can get crowded so try to make reservations early. Service is good and always make an effort to get us out on time for our show."}
{"text":"Ordered a few pizzas and they were very good. Also had the bacon candy and that was great. Good service at the bar."}
{"text":"After reading about this place in Pop City, I was really excited to try it out.  A friend mentioned she wasn't the biggest fan so I was a bit skeptical after hearing that.  They have a great beer selection and while I like how each beer on tap is written on chalk boards hanging at the bar, I do wish they had a beer menu at your table. This was very hard to see. I tried the Sarnac Pumpkin and it was just ok.  We didn't venture far on the menu and ordered the specialties that were boxed. The candied bacon for a starter was delicious-unique flavor. I was disappointed with so few pizza choices. We went with the Black and Gold but did not like the beets-I thought the flavor was too overpowering.  I recommend this place for drinks as the bar had really nice seating and a cute yet trendy decor."}
{"text":"If I could give more than 5 stars I would! I am already planning my next trip back. Honestly, this was a great dining experience, from the attitude of the workers, to the decor, and everything in between. 

I got one of the specials- the scallops with couscous. It was delicious and cooked perfectly. We also go the Candy Bacon as an appetizer. It was very good but it was literally a plate of bacon (I don't know what I was expecting but again, so, so good). 

Kyle was our server and he was engaging and funny and was clearly knowledgeable about the menu. I can really respect when a server will spend a few extra moments with you to make sure you're having a good experience. With that being said- every employee we saw was behaving the same way and I feel confident that my experience would have been just as great where ever I was lucky enough to sit."}
{"text":"Not impressed for the high prices. $18 for brisket mac and cheese and it was the size of a cereal bowl. Pizza was just ok. In town for the weekend, disappointed we spent $65 and are still hungry. Personally, I would look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Pizza is really good. We often stop here after watching a play or musical. Glad this place is open late!"}
{"text":"Love the margherita pizza. EXCELLENT crust, thick sauce, but could use a little more flavor maybe some more oregano. Otherwise a great pizza in every way. I taste some garlic in the crust that gives a great Pop. Excellent draft beer selection. The bartended with the beard was awesome. Very knowledgable on the beer."}
{"text":"This place is awesome, has a really nice and relaxed atmosphere. Really big bar area, very nice bartenders, a little small when dining because the tables and bar are a bit close but it can't be helped, they have lack of room because of the building layout. Not too busy on a nice Sunday night. The cutlery was in good shape i.e. No bent forks, no stains on the butter knifes etc. lots of neat things to look at and keep distracting while waiting for food. For this night, I had the 'Proper chips' which was only $4, comes with crisp potato chips and a French onion sort of dip which was delicious. Also the server brought me more chips after I ran out without me asking. For the meal we had the 'carnivore' pizza, it was absolutely delicious. It was equivalent to a medium/large pizza in size. It came with sausage and chicken on it, sausage was good but the chicken was very good, and had tons of flavor. The pizza was a flat pizza with a thick crust. Was made to perfection. Had the right amount of grease/solidity ratio so you could pick it up and still get a good greasy pizza. The bathroom is located in the front. It was a single person bathroom, but had a ottoman in there next to the toilet, prefect for girls night or if you're a parent. Also was very good looking and clean. The total came to about $26 dollars which is perfect for a date night. Very excellent service, water always filled, nearby if you needed anything. Rated 5 stars because it actually deserves it."}
{"text":"Great beer selection (lots of local brewery selections), very good pizza and pasta. Service was excellent. They got slammed and handled it with aplomb. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Unfortunately didn't get the pizza but will absolutely return for it.  I went for lunch got the chicken caprese which was great, side of giardiniera.  Great beer selection as well. Pizza does look a little pricey but looked amazing. Atmosphere was relaxed and casual."}
{"text":"I was looking for a place to eat near the Westin on Penn Ave. My girlfriend and I thought we would try it out for some brunch and we were blown away! The atmosphere was inviting, the chairs were comfortable, and Todd our waiter was very helpful in deciding what we should try. I would suggest to anyone to stop by and have a good drink with some delicious food."}
{"text":"My wife and I had been travelling on summer vacation and felt this was our best dining experience during our week of eating out.  Our waiter was excellent.  He made recommendations and checked up on us, but never in an over-bearing manner.  We ended up ordering their Black & Gold Pizza, which was made up of potatoes, golden beets, garlic and olive oil.  It was a very unique combination, but we both thought it was the best thing we had eaten on our entire trip.  We will try to duplicate this at home, but probably won't come close to what we had at Proper Brick Oven."}
{"text":"I came here with my co-worker while I was visiting Pittsburgh and it was my absolute favorite meal + drink of the trip!

We ordered:
-Margarita Pizza
-Primavera Pizza
-Carnivore Pizza
-Sunshine Pilsner

I can't remember the other beers but they were all good! The service was great and the ambiance was very chill. I enjoyed it a lot! 

Will be back next time I'm in PGH :D"}
{"text":"Bacon candy - that's all you need to know!  If you eat nothing else, eat the bacon candy!  My husband and I were in town last month for Kenny Chesney and wanted to try as much \"local\" stuff as we could.  Proper was at the top of our memory list when we left town after the weekend.  I do not remember all of the exact beers my husband tried, but he enjoyed them all.  They had so many different beers to choose from!  My husband had the carnivore pizza and I had the forest pizza - both were delicious!  I am a huge mushroom lover and this pizza hit the spot!  Our waitress was very nice and so patient with us as we asked so many \"touristy\" questions.  We like to travel and we're big foodies so we're very inquisitive once we find a place we like.  The manager that was on duty kind of irritated me when he changed the tv from a baseball game that I was watching to something for someone else that was apparently a friend of his.  When we asked about getting it turned back on a different tv, he just blew us off.  Oh well, we came for the food anyways (which was fantastic) and the game was just a bonus."}
{"text":"We came here for the first time before a PSO concert. It was super packed (very small inside), but luckily we only had to wait 30 minutes for a table. The hostesses were very friendly and I especially didn't mind the wait because the heat from the brick oven flames was so toasty and inviting. They don't have any two-person tables. They only have 4-person tables at the minimum.  ?It's not a huge deal, but it takes longer to get a table and I can't imagine it's that efficient for the business. I will say, however, that the staff is super efficient. As soon as a party left, there were about 4 different servers working to clear the table as quick as possible. 

We ordered the Roasted Roots salad, which was fantastic. The goat cheese truffles and roasted beets are what made the salad. All of the ingredients worked very well together. I would definitely order this again. 

We also ordered the Forest pizza. It tasted amazing, but I don't know if I've ever had pizza that greasy. The crust was basically soggy with grease. Literally, grease was dripping down my hand. I could almost feel my arteries clogging as I ate it. Luckily, we shared it between the two of us. I couldn't imagine someone eating all of that greasy pizza by themselves. I'm torn, however, because while it was super greasy it still tasted amazing. It's just greasier than I normally prefer. It was cool to see the pizzas being made in the brick ovens near the bar area. Our server was also very attentive and our food came out super quickly.

Lastly, the craft draft list is awesome. We ordered two different beers from Voodoo Brewery, one of our favorites. I don't know if I'd order pizza from here again because it's too greasy for me. Again, that's just my personal preference. I would come again, however, for the Roasted Roots salad and the beer if I happened to be in the area."}
{"text":"This place has great pizza. Much better than typical Pittsburgh pizza. Plus there is a great beer selection."}
{"text":"This is an amazing place. The Bacon Candy, Proper house chips & Black & Gold pizza is to die for. Big thanks to master brick oven pizza maker Troy and server Lee for making our first dinner in Pittsburgh awesome.  Highy recommended.  After hearing about the carnivore pizza from Troy. We are planning to return for lunch to try it. Don't walk but run here before they get packed."}
{"text":"We ordered spaghetti and it tastes too salty. But the worst thing about this place was that the attitude of our waiter was arrogant and not so respectful."}
{"text":"The whole experience was pretty bad, which stinks because we were all excited to go here. It's a small area. I bumped into 3 people to get to our table, and once there, there wasn't much room to dine. We were a party of 7 (two separate groups of friends) and 5 of us originally got cocktails to which none of us like and we all switched to a beer. Or at least the three of us in the back corner would have liked to do except the server never asked use. Don't get us wrong, she was at our table a couple of times but was only talking to the four that were close to us. We literally had to yell at her to just get water she was already passing out to the other four. Portions were on the smaller side but that didn't bother me much. The food wasn't bad but it wasn't good either. My salad was just ok, my husbands pasta dish didn't have much flavor, and our friend said her pizza tasted just like pizza, nothing special. We definitely will not be going back there which is a shame."}
{"text":"This place was really good for a random stop. Beer selection was great. Good mix of local and national craft beers. Food and service was great. I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"I found this place to be decently priced for food and drinks. 
I enjoyed their pizza, i'm a sucker for a good brick oven-fired pizza. They sure live up to the hype. This is a pretty casual place and for being downtown they don't price gauge which I definitely appreciate. I'd be curious to try some of their other things besides pizza, but we were in a bit of a time crunch and our spending money was a little less than we would have liked. I enjoyed myself. The wait staff was friendly and knowledgeable. 

When I return to try more food I shall update this to reflect, though I have a feeling it'll be just as good as that great wood-fired pizza we had!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and location (especially if you are catching a show downtown). Beer selection had a nice range. We had a great pizza (carnivore), good salad (add grilled chicken- it's worth it), and a portobello sandwich. Lunch menu is limited and a little different than dinner. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"A solid pie. I'm a huge fan of brick oven pizza and Proper did not disappoint. The dough is where it's at. It's a little on the thicker side and there's a nice subtle sweetness to it that I liked. Usually, I need to have a sauce for my crust as its bland or dry, but I could eat Proper's alone. My husband ordered the Carnivore and I ordered the Soppressata. Toppings were fresh. The pizza was very enjoyable. 

I also came here another time and ordered drinks and their mussels appetizer. I can't recall the cocktail I ordered but I remember it being tasty. The mussels were in a nice garlic broth that wasn't too overpowering. They also threw some tomatoes in with the mussels which was a nice fresh addition to the dish. 

The atmosphere is really nice, really dark, but nice. And the smell of the brick oven that hits you when you walk in is divine. Although the pizzas were solid, the prices are a little high. However, it's kind of worth it!"}
{"text":"Proper is one of my \"go-to\" places...i love the smell of the brick oven, the BACON CANDY, the assortment of beers, the entree portions can feed 2. The pizza here reminds me of italy more than other brick oven pizza places...Only 4 stars and not 5 simply because the space is pretty compact."}
{"text":"Popped in for happy hour (1 dollar off drafts) and got some Proper Chips (awesome onion dipping sauce) and few beers on tap. Watched some sports center and soaked up the smells of the pizzas coming outta the ovens. Bartender was hustling hard and keeping up with a busy room. Need to come back and eat some food."}
{"text":"Awesome BLT salad tonight and carnivore pizza with low priority on the mozzarella. I highly recommend these guys.  Thanks to our waiter and nice girl assisting (girl assisting was excellent!!!).  Great job tonight.  I'll be back.  Keep up the great job.  Thank you."}
{"text":"Had an absolutely amazing experience at Proper Brick Oven & Tap Room! We are from out of town, so we relied on research for a great Pittsburgh dinner. We found great reviews on here, so we gave it a try- and we had NO regrets!! We had Tyler as our server, who was an absolute sweetheart and did a great job with bottle service and knowledge of the menu. Would absolutely recommend to anyone. Food was great, along with service and drinks. Thank you, everyone."}
{"text":"Just wonderful! Bacon candy was to die for, as was the Forest pizza. We had great service even with a large party on a Sunday evening and everyone enjoyed their meals. Drinks were well mixed and the wine list was thorough as well. A great place for before or after a show as well."}
{"text":"The Proper Tavern is a great little place tucked away in the heart of Pittsburgh. 

When you stop in, be sure to try their cocktails. The BlackBerry Smash and the Pittsburgh Mule are both excellent for an evening drink. 

I recommend the appetizers. They're known for their candied bacon, and so we of course had to try it, along with their pepperoni roll and their homemade chips. A great way to have a light dinner. 

For entrees, the pizza is defeinitely a winner, and if they have their specialty empanadas, those come highly recommended as well. If you're looking for a lighter fare, the Amalti Salad and be sure to add the shrimp, they were divine. The chicken and dumpling soup is another great way to have a lighter dinner. 

The only thing we had a problem with is the carbonara. Everyone in my party tried it, unbelieving that it wouldn't taste good, considering the high quality of the other food. But the carbonara tasted like wet noodles and flavorless mush. My brother, a carbonara officianado--he's had carbonara all over the world, Rome, Florence, are two stands out and unfortunately this carbonara did worse than just falling short, it was truly inedible. 

While I highly recommend this place for a night out with friends or adult family (this place isn't very super kid friendly, but you can definitely get by with a kid or two with an elevated palette or who likes cheese pizza) and definitely a place to stop in for drinks, but my advice would be to avoid the carbonara."}
{"text":"We had dinner on a Saturday.  We definitely needed reservations.  This is actually a pretty small place. They have a nice selection of beers. Service was pleasant and very efficient.  We all had different pizzas.  I had one with sausage and pepperoni and my wife had a veggies one.  We all ordered the salads, which you can get in a 1/2 size. Overall the food was good.  I've had better pizza, but that's personal preference.  It was nicely baked, but nothing memorable. But you can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday with a friend, and I can say with 100% certainty that this was one of the most delightful experiences I've ever had. The ambiance of the restaurant was trendy and warm, it's small enough to not feel drafty, but I can see it being hard to get a table on a super busy night.

They have happy hour from 4-6, with $5 wines, and $1 off drafts or something. We got the wine, and it was good. We got the bacon candy which was also good, but it was basically just a plate of bacon. So if you have a problem with eating a plate of bacon, don't get it. I do not have a problem with it. I got the hot honey chicken, and I was SO HAPPY. the chicken was delicious, and the sides were kale and sweet potatoes and they were perfectly seasoned. 

All of the delicious food aside, the service was absolutely awesome. Our server, Kyle, was so great. He came over just frequently enough to make sure we were always taken care of, but not to the point of being a bother. He gave me quality feedback on some of the choices I was considering, and he was so friendly. Everyone we encountered was seriously so nice. I basically wanted to hang out with them all night long.

Bonus points for the bathrooms in the basement for being super warm and nice. It was a treat, because a basement bathroom can get super cold in the winter."}
{"text":"We ate there on 2/21 a party of 6, Tiffany was our server. We enjoyed everything. We had two pastas, a pizza, honey chicken, a steak and a few apps, they were duck wings, 2 shrimp, some kind of pepperoni roll I forget the name, and countless drinks! The beers were great, one was Great White. Oh one person had the bbq mac and cheese it was so good! I loved my pork bolognese it was so good and the noodles were large flat ones. Was my first time there, we went before a show at the Benedum. I will be back, it's perfect for anytime anyday! Thanks Tiffany for making it a memorable experience and the host staff was friendly as well."}
{"text":"The brick oven makes a tasty pizza. The beet salad, if you're into these types of things, was delicious. The exceptional part of the dining experience at the bar was the swift and friendly service. Thanks Dwight and Mike. The draft selection is impressive, variety is a good thing. Some places may have 30+ things on tap, but lack having porters and stouts. I couldn't help but be thankful that the punkin beer selection was limited to three."}
{"text":"Pizza was good..... Atmosphere a little dark,  server top notch.  Lot's of beer choices and a very interesting menu.  I only ate here once but I will come more often.  They were very good with my wife's food allergies."}
{"text":"(11/11/2014)  Was kind of killing some time before Butcher and the Rye opened at 5pm, came into Proper just for a drink and to check it out (on a recommendation from our bartender at Nine on Nine).  Awesome wall of taps, thoughtfully curated, represented a wide range of styles and small-batch producers.  While we were there, they were prepping some basil, aroma was so intoxicating (hmm, or was it the hard cider) that we got a Margherita Pizza and the Bacon Candy (caramelized in a pan with brown sugar and butter).  Bacon Candy, was, well, as you can guess, delicious.  The crust on the pizza was thin in the middle, had a nice puffy crust which was airy, fluffy, and chewy, some black bits, but since it was early in the day, the char was mostly from leftover cornmeal in the oven vs. char on our actual crust.  \"Sauce\" was more like hand squeezed whole tomatoes strewn all over the crust, too many and oversalted.  Overall, decent pie, we asked for extra basil, def go for it."}
{"text":"This place was a lot more expensive than I expected. Actually, I don't know what all the money went to, because it seemed reasonable priced... Which makes me think their drinks must be super expensive. 

Their food is great! I have had 2 pizzas from here, one was a special with potatoes and onion and the other was mushroom. Both were very good. I also had the roasted peppers and that was good as well.

This is a great place to stop before a show, but be warned drink prices are not listed and they are high."}
{"text":"In Pittsburgh for a conference and was looking forward to a great local meal. Found this place on yelp and it looked pretty good. When I walked in the ambiance was very nice. Wood fired pizza oven and great bar with amazing beer selection. When eating alone, I usually sit at the bar.  I ordered a beer and started looking over the menu expecting to order one of the pizzas.  They had some specials, one being oven roasted flounder with fingerling potatoes and vegetable hash. Sounded pretty good so I ordered it. This is when things went south.

A couple guys next to me ordered pizzas at the same time I ordered the flounder. Theirs came right out.  After a while the bartender came by and said he would check on it. Still nothing. Finally after another long wait the flounder came out. It was in a very small bowl, and not visually appealing. I took a bite and the flavors were good, but the food was barely warm like it had been sitting a while. The bartender asked me how everything was and I told him it tasted OK but was fairly cold. He said he would let the kitchen know and see if they could do anything.  This was my first real meal of the day and being very hungry I ate it without waiting to hear back from him.  Bar areas of restaurants are usually understaffed and he was very busy.

When he came back I asked for the check and he told me there was nothing he could do. I left so hungry that I stopped by a local market on the way back to the hotel to get some snacks. I should have ordered a pizza, it would have saved several dollars and filled me up. 

I feel like if a restaurant has a special, then it should actually be special and they should take care of the customers that order it."}
{"text":"This place is one of our favorite restaurants in the city. Outstanding food and beer selection, and the staff is just superb."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza, amazing beer and amazing atmosphere.  Not much else to say.  Only small point of feedback and I wouldn't dock the 5 point score for it but want to put out there: they only have 1 soup that is sausage based.  I recall  wedding soup or pasta fagioli in the past that was great and lighter.  Would love to see this brought back.  Also they have really good pasta.  They should add a rigatoni with marinara sauce straight up pasta similar to what Il Pizziolo has.  Again, minor items not taking away the 5 star score.  The straight up margarita pie is so awesome and always amazing beers to select from."}
{"text":"Such a cute place in such as convenient location! My dinning companions and I had high hopes for this place after seeing all the great reviews, but we left disappointed. Everything seemed ok at first. It was super crowded on a Saturday evening because of a bunch of events going on in Downtown. The hostess told us it will be a 30 minute wait, but we were seated within 15 minutes (yay!). Our waiter seemed like a quirky fella and the food options looked promising. 

We ordered the meat lover pizza and the pesto pizza. The food came in a timely manner. The pizzas were super fresh with top-notch ingredients. The pizza crusts were so crispy and delightful. Everything went so well until we ran out of water. Our waiter was nowhere to be found and we were all parched. The crowd cleared out and still our waiter was nowhere in sight. We had to flag down the manager and asked for more water. After the eating, drinking and talking, we waited again for our bill. A good 20-minute went by and still no sign of the waiter. When we finally flagged him down, he said a few minutes, which turned into another 10 minute. Once we got our bill, it's another 10 minute before we got our receipts and permission to leave. 

I spent the majority of my dinning experience waiting around, not much eating. The pizzas were delicious, but the service needs to be reassessed. I'm not sure if I'm willing to give this place another try, maybe one day when I have enough time to afford waiting around."}
{"text":"Great beer, AMAZING pizza (try the margarita... the sauce is outstanding) and great service.  Well worth the trip"}
{"text":"Good pizza.. We are pizza philly snobs.. We had the margarita and pesto. Both were great. I wish the bottom was cooked more. It needed to not be floppy when you picked it up. A little Greasy but good flavor.. Good beer selection . Super cute place .."}
{"text":"I had my eye on this place for a while and finally have it a try.. Glad I did!  Despite being busy we were seated quickly.  The staff was polite, attentive, and quite friendly.  We tried the bacon candy and one of the grilled pizzas.  Bacon candy was great, but not super crisp.  I could have ate a pound of it.  I can't recall the pizza toppings but the crust was on point!  I think anything you put on those pizzas and cook in a brick oven will be a winner.  Good draft beer list too."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza!!!  Good service and beer selection. Will definitely eat here next visit to Pittsburgh!!"}
{"text":"What a great pizza!  The carnivore pizza is a must when you try a pie.  One thing that really caught us off guard was how amazing the \"Pittsburgh Mule\" was.  Most their ingredients are mad in house, like the ginger beer.  Give it a shot when you are on Pennsylvania Ave."}
{"text":"Love everything about this place. Wonderful beer and cocktail list. Very good pizza, and all dishes are killer"}
{"text":"Bacon Candy Appetizer is a must.  It is the best Bacon I have ever eaten!!!   Amazing beer selection and great pizza.  It just became one of my regular haunts in downtown Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at Proper. The layout is a little weird, You don't get much privacy but anyways when I first sat down I kept feeling water droplets drip onto me and I realized it was the air conditioning above me. I told the waiter about it but said it was no big, and i moved to another seat at our table. He felt so bad that he climbed up on the booth and was wiping it down. I thought that was really nice. Onto the food. My party ordered the pepperoni roll and the chips/onion dip as an app. Both were good. We then shared the Forest pizza. This was recommended by the waiter because we couldn't decide. It was delicious. All the ingredients were fresh. We even kept the last of the onion dip to dip our pizza crust in. All in all a great little spot. I will deff be back. 

P.S Our waiter was Kyle and he was amazing :)"}
{"text":"Stopped here after the game. Was great decision because the pizza was so good. In particular the cheese pizza. Not sure the specific name of it was, but I'd recommend it."}
{"text":"eh. staff was friendly, but gave mixed signals. was very crowded...couldnt get a space at the bar to order a drink as we waited for a table. one waitress told us to go get a drink at the \"server\" bar. the host then informed us, no we could not do that? ok no worries but strange.

pizza was honestly a let down. very soggy, couldnt even stand up slices under their own power. toppings/cheese slid right off into a pile. my girlfriends crust was actually raw. we didnt complain, but probably wont be back. 


beer selection was great tho!"}
{"text":"Gluten free pizza would make this place decent."}
{"text":"I may have a new favorite place to eat downtown! I actually stopped in here twice in one night (yes, really) last week. The first time my friends and I had made dinner reservations, but due to a mix-up on what time our theater show started that night we didn't have time to eat much. So we returned after the show to sample more of the menu, because at that point, why not?

Both times we visited, the staff were excellent and considerate. They definitely wanted to make sure we made our show. Despite the place being jam packed, they took the time to make sure our food made it to our tables quickly They even brought our checks super early so we wouldn't have to wait on them later. So really, before even tasting the food, I was falling in love with the place, just because of the staff.

But oh my, the food! On round one here I ordered the Spinach-Ricotta Dumplings and an arsenal cider. Um, can you say yum? Because, yum. I would have eaten an entire bowl of those tasty tasty dumplings! But I didn't, and as a result, I had room for Brown butter scallops later that night. These are a current special which came with orzo rice, spinach, and a citrus-based sauce. I added a Pittsburgh Mule cocktail to my meal, and I proceeded to eat myself into the happiest state I've been in for quite a while. These scallops were great. I can't think of a dish or experience I could even compare it to. The saying \"explosion of flavor\" is a pretty apt description - every bite was heavenly! The Mule cocktail was admittedly mostly water by the time I finished it - there was a LOT of ice in there...but it certainly wasn't a huge deal, and I didn't care, because oh my gosh delicious scallops!

I 100% want to come back here. Actually, I need to come back, because there's a buckeye tart on their dessert menu that I did not get to sample last week. So watch out, Proper Brick Oven & Tap Room - as soon as the holiday rush dies down and I stand a chance at getting a table, you'll see me again! And I'll be raving about you in the meantime!"}
{"text":"The mushroom pasta was delicious and rich!!! Pizza sizes were smaller than expected but still more than enough for one person. I had the Amalfi Salad with chicken for dinner. The salad was good but the chicken was pretty dry. For dessert, I got the bread pudding and it was amazing. I think the dessert was the best part. They included a candle on my friends dessert for her birthday (because we asked) which was nice. Overall, I it was slightly pricey for the quality of the food and service."}
{"text":"The carnivore pizza and bacon candy are some of the finest choices available. The pizza is a little on the expensive side but tasted simply wonderful. The food arrived much more quickly than we expected, and we got to sit in front of the oven and watched each hand-made pizza being put in and taken out. Their turkey club sandwich was also excellent, although the pickle that came with it is not really to my taste."}
{"text":"So good!! I started off with the chips and dip which were really tasty and also the sangria. The sangria was a little too watered down for my taste but I still enjoyed the drink. At my table everyone was raving about the Bianca pizza which I ended up tasting from one of my friends. That pizza definitely was superrrrr good! I recommend it if you're in the mood to get a pizza. I ended up getting the scallops pasta which is delicious. They even add these flakes that make the pasta spicy. If you like spicy don't remove the flakes! 

Luckily I was visiting a friend here in Pittsburgh and he took us here. If you're in the downtown area, check out this great Italian restaurant! :)"}
{"text":"This place was seriously awesome. 

They have a rotating beer list which in my opinion is, well, the tops! Every time you go you'll see something different and that's awesome plus tons of local breweries. Which was great for us since it was our first time in Pittsburgh. 

We got the bacon candy...yes bacon candy. Do it. It's chewy but hard but sweet but salty. It's perfect. Followed by the Bianca pizza. Which had burrata cheese and like three other cheeses on it. It was amazing. The crust was chewy but crunch so perfect. And to round it out we luckily had the best bartender ever Jason who was able to get us the cookie dough cheesecake even though it was past dessert hours. (After 9:45 they only do pizzas) and when I tell you you need to try this cheesecake, this life changing,gut changing, mind blowing, super delicious perfect combination cheesecake I'm not exaggerating. It was soooooo good, yes six o's good. 

Honestly the nicest part of our visit was Jason. He was such a nice human. He let me try a few beers before I picked one, he shared awesome pickles with us (which he said they make a cocktail out of the pickles juice..yes we will be back for that. A pickle juice cocktail, how could that be bad! That's right it can't be) and he was just genuinely a nice dude who is probably the main reason we need to come back. It's rare you get someone who's actually into talking to you and making sure you're doing well and enjoying everything. Really really great dude. You should defiantly stop by and tip him well! 

All in all great spot, with really good people and really good food. 10/10 would recommend."}
{"text":"From start to finish the good was outstanding. This place is truly the gem of Pittsburgh eats. I have traveled all over the world and to all the major cities and this place is one of my absolute favorites.   The pizza is by far superior to anything in the area. The bacon candy is to die for.  I think I will be dreaming about the bacon candy in my sleep. The salads are as fresh as can be.  The watermelon drink is amazing and the chocolate cake is also fantastic."}
{"text":"I'm in town for a conference and decided to look on Yelp for something tasty to eat in downtown Pittsburgh -- I knew my options would be limited in that a lot of places aren't open on Sunday nights. The reviews for this place looked promising ... I'm sad to say that this place was a major disappointment. Both the food and the service left a lot to be desired.

My waitress looked like she didn't want to be there and spoke to me w/ an inappropriate tone and urgency, like she needed me to hurry up and order. I was immediately turned off by her poor attitude but decided to order anyway, since I had walked all the way over there from my hotel. I ordered a beer and the mushroom pizza (Forrest). No real complaints about the beer, but the pizza was bland and tasteless at best. I was so hungry from traveling all day that I ate what I could and boxed up the rest. I handed the box to a homeless man on the street on my way back to the hotel. I figure that was maybe a little less wasteful since I had originally planned on throwing it away.

1 star for the cute atmosphere. I tried to think of something else positive, but am drawing a blank. 

If you're used to food having any type of true flavor, this place is an absolute no. While the atmosphere is kinda cute, the service is bad. 

Don't waste your money. Go somewhere else. Your wallet and taste buds may thank me later."}
{"text":"Craft drinks made with spirits from PA distilleries and some bangin food are the makings of a great evening nosh.

Park in the nearby garage or take a Lyft and forget about it. Proper is located in the theatre district and very easy to find. Dine at a table or at the bar---preferred, so you can chat it up with the other patrons. The ambience is warm and casually classy. 

I dined on their Amalfi salad and the carnivore pizza minus sausage, add mushrooms. One bite of the salad with the juicy kalamatas and lemon shallot vinaigrette left me just wanting more and more of it. Something so basic yet so full of flavor--it was good. The pizza was cooked perfectly...brick oven pizza with chewy crust and delicious sauce slathered on just right with a nice  throw of meat and oozing cheese. I mean damn...just get you some!

Lastly, my cocktail for the evening was the blackberry rhubarb smash that was simply righteous.  Rum combined with the fruits, iced tea  made edgy with some lemon. It was delish. Nothing left to say...except GO GET YOU SOME!"}
{"text":"I fail to see what the fuss is about this place. 

Stopped in for drinks and dinner. This is the kind of place that presents itself as having pride in its cocktails. So imagine my surprise when the bartender made my manhattan with Jack Daniels, and used so much ice as to water down the drink. 

Pizza was good, but not for the price ($15 for a roughly 10\" pie). Waitress seemed clueless throughout. 

Bad drinks, good but overpriced food, spotty service. There are better spots for gourmet pizza on this town."}
{"text":"I feel like I am being overly critical lately but...

First: great beer selection.  Awesome. I would go back for the beer (so maybe this is a 3 star review?). Bartenders were mixed on friendliness, one was really nice and friendly and another just seemed surly.  we all have bad days though.

ordered the meat pizza with sausage only on half (nice bartender suggested that when we were discussing if we really wanted sausage).  Ordered it \"lightly done\" as we saw lots of pies coming out with really burnt (you can call it charred but it was straight up black charcoal looking).  Great.

So then the pie comes out (i will try to remember to upload picture) and two of the slices' crusts are WAY burnt.  WAYYYY burnt.  we're like, huh, lightly done? ok.  but we were hungry.  after taking a bite, it seemed that the \"lightly done\" had to do with the rest of the crust.  it was not raw or anything like that, but just not that good either. no crispiness or anything; sort of like a microwave pizza.  and maybe that's on us for ordering lightly done, but I thought that was a pretty standard thing (at my fav place Picco, it's on their menu that the crusts come out charred so order lightly done if you don't want it).  But even pretending that we didn't order the pie lightly done, we did order sausage on half.  and you guessed it, sausage was on the entire thing.  and I know it sounds like we were being difficult, but A) the bartender suggested that and B) it wasn't busy. next issue: they left the bacon off of the pizza.  the bartender quickly took care of this by essentially throwing some bacon on it, but...

also, it seemed that they made a margharita pizza and then just threw the toppings on top (sort of like the bartender did with the bacon).  maybe that is just how they do it there but I like when the stuff is all cooked and integrated together, not thrown on top at the end.

so, because it is a pizza spot and our pizza was sub-par, I'm going 2 stars.  And it could be on us for not ordering standard, I know, but...

I will say that the people next to us got pasta and it looked pretty dang good.  I would probably go back for drinks and, if people wanted, try the food again, but I wouldn't make it a destination spot and I personally wouldn't order the pizza."}
{"text":"Visited on a Friday night around 6:00.  There was a 45 minute wait for a table at the bar but luckily there was bar seating to have a drink while we waited.  No reservations for parties less than 6 either.  

Overall, the place is pricey for both the food and drinks that they serve.

The pizza's are 10\" and cost about $17.  The size is barely enough for two so you do have to order something else unless you are not that hungry.

As for the taste, the pizza is supposed to be brick oven what was way too soggy for the brick oven pizza I'm used to.  The topping and combinations were just okay.

I would not return here.  There are plenty of other pizza places in this city:"}
{"text":"Stopped in with a colleague on game night and was surprisingly able to snag a table. They have an impressive list of beers on tap including a token lager that is always my go to beer. We started with salads and I can recommend the BLT and not just because it has bacon. The warm dressing on the spinach along with red onions and bacon just combined nicely and the nub of bread on the side made it easy to sop up the leftover dressing on the plate.

For our meal we split a carnivore pizza (yes more bacon) that was delivered quickly by our wonderful server April. The thin crusted pizza was crisp with a tasty sauce and fresh ingredients. Probably one of the better pizzas I have ever enjoyed."}
{"text":"The first time I visited Proper was last year sometime shortly after they opened.  My husband and I went after work one night and had a couple of drinks and a margherita pizza.  The pizza was very good.  However, the price was $14.  If I'm going to spend $14 on a plain pizza, I'm going to Il Pizzaiolo where a plain is $14 and out of this world.  Proper's pizza was good, but definitely not out of this world.

We were there again yesterday for lunch by accident.  It was my husband's birthday and we were not able to get into our first choice restaurant, so opted for this place since it was nearby and very cold outside.  We were seated promptly to a not very crowded dining room.  I ordered a water, minestrone soup, and Mediterranean pizza.  My husband ordered an iced tea, side salad, and Tacchino sandwich.  He had trouble pronouncing the name of the sandwich and the server helped him, but thought he was talking about the Finocchio pizza, so consequently brought him the wrong meal - a pizza instead of a sandwich.  We had waited a good bit for the food to come out and even though the waitress offered to have his original choice made for him, he opted to just keep the pizza, as we were on our lunch hour and really didn't have the time to wait for something else.  She said she would be happy to discount our bill.  Okay, great.  However, when the bill came, she removed his iced tea and the minestrone soup only.  Really?  The sandwich would have been $10, the pizza was $16.  You bring us an incorrect entree and only discount the bill approx. $7 (soup $5 and iced tea, maybe $2 equals $7)?  This could have been the manager's call, but still.  Why are we paying for your mistakes?

Again, Il Pizzaiolo has WAY better pizza and the prices are comparable.  I just don't see what the fuss is all about here.  Yes, the food is good.  But, I feel like I'm being gouged on price.  It's just not worth it."}
{"text":"Our server Kyle was awesome. Great atmosphere, many different beers to choose from and amazing fresh food. Loved it!"}
{"text":"One of the best pizza restaurants I've been to. I was visiting from Northern Virginia, and I wish I could take this place back home. 
Great craft beer menu! Tried the Monkey Boy (best beer I tried during my stay in Pittsburgh). 
I had the pesto pizza, it was delicious and flavorful, even had bacon! The crust was really good too!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Proper before seeing Wicked at the Benedum. We were lucky enough to go during Pittsburgh Restaurant Week, so they were offering a special of one appetizer,one pizza, and one dessert from a selected menu. The appetizers were delicious. Bacon Candy was great , as well as the Pepperoni Bread (I believe it was called Pepperoni Pagnotta or something to that effect). The pizzas were top-notch as well. I really wanted a Carnivore, but since it was not part of the special, I chose a pie that had , among other toppings, goat cheese and house cured sweet sausage. My wife had a pizza with spinach and bacon, Both were great. The Peanut Butter Cheesecake and the Turtle Brownie sundae for dessert were also very good. The only issue that we had, and through no fault of the restaurant, is that we began to run short on time, since the show was to begin in about 30 minutes, and we had just finished our appetizers...we did have about a 45 minute to one hour wait to be seated...the place is on the small side. We told our waitress of our time constraint, and she actually helped move things along as quickly as possible (brought dessert and check shortly after the pizzas arrived,as we requested, and got our payment processed and leftovers boxed very quickly!) She was even kind enough to label our bag of leftover pizza with our name and hold it until we stopped in to get it after the show! The beer selection looked impressive, although I am not a real craft beer drinker. I just can't enjoy a beer that is $8 or $9 for a 12 oz pour...that said, it appeared that the selection was quite varied and looked tasty. Again, not an indictment of the restaurant, just a personal preference (I'd rather drink three 23 oz domestic drafts at a local bar for the same price!). All in all, I highly recommend this place and would dine here again ay any opportunity!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza done the authentic way.  Atmosphere is okay, could be improved.  Go for the food."}
{"text":"I went there last week with a big group for dinner.  They had a pretty impressive beer list, including some less common west coast selections; prices were reasonable at $6-7 for a pint of craft beer.  

The 8 guys in our group ended up splitting 4 pizzas...that amount seemed about right.  We had the forest pizza, the carnivore, the soppressatta, and the pesto.  I was amazed at how different they all were, and everything was uniquely delicious.  The forest was a perfect autumn umami mushroom bomb.  I thought the soppressata was a better balanced \"classic\" meat pizza than the carnivore, but both were excellent.  The pesto had a pretty strong flavor profile; merely the least-good pizza in an impressive quartet.

Very highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Pittsburgh by a LONG shot. I was so disappointed in Pittsburgh's ability to make a good pizza until I came here. I've had so much bad pizza in Pittsburgh but this place kicks @$$.  Thank you for saving me guys! Carnivore pizza ALL DAY!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  It's an intimate setting with a trendy vibe.  When you walk in the brick oven is up front.  You walk up a few steps and there is a long bar on the right and tables on the left.  We didn't drink, but it looked like they had 32 different beers on tap.  I had the chicken and dumpling soup, a special, which was amazing.  It was rich and homey and perfect.  The boyfriend had the bacon candy, which he really enjoyed.  We also got a pizza, the margherita add pepperoni.  It was one of the best pizzas I've ever had.  The crust has an excellent taste and texture, fluffy yet crispy.  The pizza is kind of small.  It was a good size to split with the appetizers, but could definitely be eaten by one person.  We also tried the peanut butter pie, it was okay, but not very sweet.  I would skip the pie and eat more pizza!"}
{"text":"my fiance & I ate here for a late lunch/early dinner on a Saturday.  It was quite busy, nearly packed, but we found 2 seats at the bar.  our service was very good.  we had soup, salad, and shared a margarita pizza.  everything was delicious. we originally were looking for a more low key pizza experience, but google maps said we were close to this place, and we were hungry!  Very good!  When looking for a restroom, the hostesses even directed us to a spare one, downstairs.  
We LOVE pizza.  Great place!"}
{"text":"very nice place. hummus dish was delicious.  nice relaxing place. nice choice of beer"}
{"text":"Tonight my son and I craved some great pizza.  Being from NYC we are often disappointed when trying pizza outside of our home town.  Well Proper did not disappoint.  We had the Margherita and the Mediterranean pies.  Both were amazing.  Very fresh and very tasty.  It's obvious they use the very best ingredients."}
{"text":"Awful experience. If you have to park, plan on a minimum of $10. And if you have more than 4 people expect a horrible wait time. And reservations are taken ahead so plan a week+ out. AND... Takeout isn't until 21:00. Ridiculous. I'm embarrassed I came here. May have good food but horrible seating and reservation strategy."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to come to Proper for so long and finally made it Friday for dinner with 2 of my girlfriends! The atmosphere inside is cozy and welcoming- to me it is perfect for a chilly Pittsburgh night. They don't take reservations for parties of less than 6, so I put my name in and was seated at the bar by the great hostess. As we waited at the bar I had the Winter sangria (super yum!), one girl had the \"Cherries In the Snow\" cocktail which was just ok, and my other friend had an IPA. The couple next to us was served extra chips and gave them to us! That was a great start to the evening. They were served with a caramelized onion dipping sauce which was  just as addicting as it sounds. When we were seated, we ordered the crispy shrimp appetizer (I'm pretty sure this was a special) and salads to start. My friend and I shared the house salad. Both starters were great! 
For dinner, we shared the pesto pizza and the forest pizza. OH MY GOD! The pesto pizza had bacon on it too which was a fabulous touch! 2 pizzas were the perfect size for sharing with 3 people. I can't wait to visit Proper again!"}
{"text":"I had the meat lover's pizza minus the bacon.  Not the best pizza in the area, but tasty enough.  I slap four stars on this rating due to the versatility of the place.  You can get a solid pizza here or a very solid brunch.  Good variety of beer as well."}
{"text":"This restaurant was one of the best I've been to! This was my first time visiting Pittsburgh and my parents and I decided to go to Proper. I was looking at reviews  on my phone for different resuraunt in the area and this one sounded pretty good with its wood fired advertisement. My parents are simple eaters and when we walked in we were surprised to find that it was more gourmet food than we expected. We looked over the menu and figured we would just share a pizza and order salads. Our waiter came over and was very nice! He explained the menu and offered alterations to our meal (Margaretta pizza add pepperoni) and catered to our individual requests. He explained the beer menu very well to my mom and offered her samples because she was unsure. To top off our superior service, the food was incredible! They make their own mozzarella in house, you could taste just how incredibly fresh all the ingredients were, our salads (house and BLT) pizza (see above) and dessert (peaches and cream trifecta and cheese cake trio) were to die for!!! If we ever come back to Pittsburgh, we will definitely be returning to Proper!!! :)"}
{"text":"First of all, LOVE the ambiance. Dark and bricks and warm and homey....and playing some good rock music. The staff were also super nice.

The food was very good, just a couple things that would make the food better. I started with the pepperoni pagnotta, which I was very happy with, but the dough was just a little too hard and crunchy, not as soft and easy to eat as I was expecting. I also had the fig & pig pizza, which was SO good but I would have liked more cheese/sauce--there was an entire piece of pizza that was only spinach basically. Also shared the crab spaghetti, which was absolutely delicious but could have been a little spicier just to give it a kick of flavor. For drinks, I got the St. Peno, which was a little bitter/tangy for me, but then I absolutely loved the heavy Maple Old Fashioned and would definitely order that one again.

I would definitely come back here to try a lot of other items on the menu that look very good, and especially the desserts."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance.  Food was OK and beer selection was good.  Service was attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"I went to Proper twice, most recent visit was over the weekend before seeing Beauty and the Beast at Heinz Hall. The first time was on NYE. Totally packed and a fun atmosphere! The Arsenal Christmas cider was on tap, which, if you haven't tried it, you're missing out! It's delicious! 
This visit we had the bacon candy, yum! BLT salad... which was so so. Mostly just spinach with a little bit of bacon. No \"T\" surprisingly! My faith was renewed however by the Arsenal dry Cider! Not too sweet, a little tart, just right! For the main course we had the Finnochio pizza. It was great! Onions and goat cheese? Yes please! For dessert (see pictures) he had the blueberry Panna cotta... which was to die for! I had the cheesecake, which was good, but not as great as I expected! 
Overall, a great atmosphere if you're looking for a romantic dinner in downtown Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"You had me at Bacon Candy! Great spot for dinner before theatre. Place was packed but got there early enough to be seated quickly. Great beer selection including locals. Decent menu, something for everyone. Great service, less than average dinner wait time even though it was packed. All of our meals were perfect. Will be back."}
{"text":"Great beer selection. A nice serving of tasty bacon with a well suggested black IPA and I'm a happy man. Best part, the two bartenders were sweet and attentive. I'd give this place 5 stars but I didn't try the pizza from the wood oven. Maybe next time because I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Excellent food. I had the fettuccine pesto pomodoro and it was delicious.  Wished the portion was a bit larger because it was so good.  My sister-in-law got the primavera pizza and that was delicious too.  Excellent crust and fresh ingredients.  The desserts were fantastic as well.  If you are a chocoholic, the flourless chocolate cake is right up your alley."}
{"text":"Great local beer. Wood fired pizza was excellent - both the Bianca and the Margherita were tasty with quality ingredients. Service was prompt and friendly, and he even split our check three ways without hesitation. Ambience is nice for dinner with work colleagues, friends or a date. Classy joint."}
{"text":"Stopped last night before a show at the O'Reilly. Had the Bianca and Margherita pizzas and of course the bacon candy. This is a must. 

I love the atmosphere here and our service was impeccable."}
{"text":"The decor and atmosphere is fantastic! Delicious Fettuccine basil pesto pasta! Incredible flourless chocolate cake. Loved the house salad with pears and caramelized walnuts.  Charming and witty owner. I will be back!"}
{"text":"First and foremost, they have the best LOCAL beer selection downtown. You can find selections from Grist House, Hitchhiker, Grew Gentleman, Roundabout, Four Seasons, Full Pint....and any other locals that I missed (sorry)!! 

Okay, now that's out of way, the food is good. The pizzas are decent sized and they use quality ingredients. I go for lunch sometimes and usually order a sandwich rather than the pizza, but definitely try the Black Pepper Bacon Candy as an appetizer

Alright, the reason I am giving it 3 stars is because I was there with coworkers for lunch and sat by the pizza oven at the lower-level bar. One of my coworkers ordered the \"ocean\" pizza, which contains shellfish. The pizza maker made all of the pizzas without changing his gloves or washing his hands in between."}
{"text":"Proper Brick Oven is a nice place, but it could easily get crowded as the space is pretty tight.  There is a large bar with TV's so if you wanted to have a date night without missing an important game (*cough* a Steeler game), Proper Brick Oven would definitely bring that ambiance.

I'm not in love with the food.  The pizza is good, but I'm just not personally in love. You do get a decent amount of food for your money so it's definitely worth the price.

I think I was most impressed with the staff.  We went to Proper Brick Oven with a sizable group and they were able to split the check AND add the birthday boy's meal evenly to everyone's check.  It's a small thing, but it makes celebrating a birthday or event that much more enjoyable."}
{"text":"We popped in here for a quick lunch this afternoon and we were so blown away. The atmosphere, food, and drinks were beyond amazing. We had the candy bacon and chips for a snack and both were so good we wanted more. We shared a pizza which was the perfect size for sharing. Absolutely wonderful! A+++"}
{"text":"What a jewel -- great pizzas and an enormous selection of craft beers just minutes' walk from PNC Park. This is an ideal place to meet before a Pirates, Penguins or Steelers game for a great pizza and a few suds. Stopped here with a friend after an afternoon Bucs game when we were caught in the rain. We weren't sure how hungry we were, so we just ordered one pizza- a meet lovers with sausage, pepperoni and bacon. Simply outstanding. And filling, Their selection of craft beers must reach two dozen varieties -- if not more. Prices are reasonable. The interior architecture is eye-catching. Open space with a large multi-sided bar offering great sight lines of the dining area and ovens. If you like a traditional Italian pizza, this is your stop. Be aware -- don't expect gobs of rubbery cheese and gummy dough. The pizzas here are works of art. If you want a $2.50 slice, go around the street corner and get something else."}
{"text":"Had a light dinner with my friend at the bar. This place has bar seating as well as tables. The bathroom is located at the front of the restaurant.

We had already gotten some drinks that night, so we decided to just get some food. We shared the poutine starter and the Carnivore pizza (pics attached). The poutine was made up of fingerling potatoes, meat, and sauce. I was expecting fries so I was caught a little off guard, but it was actually very good! The poutine was the highlight of my experience here. The Carnivore pizza wasn't the best pizza I've ever had, but I'm sure different people have very different likes and dislikes for pizza. The pizza here had a medium crust (not too thin, not too thick), and was more on the heavy side. It definitely did the job, but just wasn't a pizza that amazed me. Perhaps next time I come I should get some drinks, given that it's a Tap Room."}
{"text":"I don't know which is better... the beer selection or the food! 30 beers on draft and a wood fire pizza oven. Really cool ambiance and a great addition to downtown. It's a little hard to get a table when big shows are in town so make sure you arrive early."}
{"text":"Limited menu but the pizza is decent.  My favorite dish in this place is actually the Proper House salad.  It's also a nice option to order a half or full salad.  Reservations strongly recommended since it is very small and located in the heart of the theater district."}
{"text":"This was a great combination of a good beer selection and very tasty food. Plus, it was ideally situated near the theatre for lunch before the show on a cold, rainy day. House chips, bacon candy, soup, brick oven pizza, sandwiches, salads. All great. Definitely worth repeat trips to sample the rest of the menu. Nice folks, good service."}
{"text":"Bring your own ice cubes if you want a drink on the rocks. They charge $2. why???  Do you charge for ice in the water?  The staff is rude and pretty much incompetent in running a restaurant better options"}
{"text":"My wife and I had a great meal here. We split the peparoni rolls and a Bianca pizza. Everything tasted great and we would gladly return. Our server was very attentive and grabbed us things without us ever needing to ask. Special shout out as well to William the host. He was very friendly and informative. While waiting for the table to open we chatted about the drinks selection and the store they are planning to open. He is great at his job!"}
{"text":"Awesome vibe, amazing pizza, and great beer selection make this place a home run.

Came here after work to watch MNF. Ordered the pesto pizza, which turned from just pizza to an incredible culinary experience. The juiciness of the tomatoes combined with the tenderness of the pork belly bacon made it truly amazing. Came back with my entire team the next day and ordered the carnivore (great, but not as good as the pesto in my opinion) and a seasonal honey beer, which was awesome. So far, best place I've gone too in Pittsburgh - definitely coming back multiple times over the next few weeks!"}
{"text":"Great service, great atmosphere! The pizza is awesome. There was a short wait to be seated but it was the weekend when we visited so that was expected."}
{"text":"Wonderful experience tonight. Great drinks, great food, wonderful service! Cory was a terrific waiter - thanks for a fun night!"}
{"text":"We visited Saturday with a group of girls for dinner. The service was fast, friendly and impeccable. The candy bacon- to die for! I LOVED the maple old fashioned cocktail and I'm relatively sure the \"Pig&Fig\" pizza changed my life slightly on that day. We met the manager, who was incredibly friendly and welcoming. He was very passionate about what he did and it definitely showed! I cannot WAIT to return. You HAVE to check them out if you're in twon- you will NOT be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The pizza (Finocchio) I had here was the best I've had in Pittsburgh. Not exactly a low key pizza place, but they did a great job. Service was very good as well."}
{"text":"Coming here every month now after craft beer school... Every time is exceptional but tonight was over the top with the white chocolate bread pudding... Closest thing to an orgasm that I've ever had"}
{"text":"The food is consistently good here.
I wish they would take reservations for groups of 4 (you need 6 or more).
I had the fried chicken (a lot of the 4 of us wanted to try it). The chicken was very tender and the portion was reasonable."}
{"text":"This place is really good. Here's what I like:
- The setting is comfortable and fresh. 
- They have a great variety of excellent and unique beers. 
- The brick oven pizza is excellent.
- Service is decent. 

The Pizza
It's thin crust is almost crispy but still flexible. The dough itself has a good flavor. The sauce just tastes like ripe tomatoes, which I like, and is not sweet. There is minimal cheese, but it is in the form of lumps of fresh mozzarella and tastes so good. 

I'll be back."}
{"text":"A rewrite is necessary after our last night visit to Proper Brick Oven & Tap Room.  We stopped in before heading over to the Benedum for a Valentine's Day showing of Alice in Wonderland presented by the PGH Ballet courtesy of Yelp (thank you Yelp).  We grabbed a quick beer and Matt decided he wanted to stop back after the show to grab one more since he really enjoyed his wheat beer, a Penn Weizen, from local Penn Brewery.  

After the show ended we headed right back over.  All the staff seemed to be polite and attentive.  We ordered another round and by this time of the evening the place was clearing out so there was plenty of room at the bar.  Their bar is very classy and the seats are super comfy.  

My tummy began to rumble, and although I am not usually one to eat that late at night I was considering ordering something, though I had never eaten here on any of my previous visits.  After some persuasion from my other half we decided to share a pizza.  They have some very unique pizzas on the menu.  I don't like a lot of greasy toppings on my pizza, AKA sausage, pepperoni ect.  I also rarely eat pizza, as it usually doesn't impress so calories VS the taste is not a fair trade in my mind.  That being said we were eyeing up this pesto pizza.  Quite unique lots of fresh elements and I love pesto, so I was sold.  The bartender told us we were welcomed to customize our selection but the pizza seemed well balanced so I didn't feel a need to customize it.  

Our pie arrived quickly.  Perfect size for two, maybe three people.  We took a few slices home.  I really have no complaints.  It was a nice tasty crust, with the wood fire taste permeating through.  The toppings were all fresh and the pesto sauce gave it that extra special touch.  Still a four for being a tad on the expensive side, but now I can say the food lives up to the quality of the drinks.  Definitely recommend trying some food if you find yourself here."}
{"text":"I have to admit, I really enjoyed my time here.  As soon as you walk in, you just smell the wood fire pizza.  For me, this is the scent Yankee Candle needs to make, than again that might be a bad idea because I would be ordering pizza for every meal.  Ok, back to reality.  I opened the door and the smell hits you right away.  The bar is not too bright not too dark, just right.  Gives it a relaxed, quiet yet upscale feel, without being upscale and snotty.  

The bar area is extremely long, plenty of seating around the elongated horseshoe bar.  There are some tables in and around the large bar area as well.

What do I love about here?  The support of local beer and PA beers in general.  Lots of players from around the area, Grist House, Voodoo, East End, Rivertowne, Hop Farm, Helltown.  Statewide, you have Shawnee Brewing, Yards, Victory.  They also have a good amount of Great Lakes and some West Coast brews (Ballast Point).  Many of the brews they have on tap fit in with the season, Belgian Wits, American Wheats, Hefeweizens, Session ales (though they are not below 4%, so in my mind, not technically session, but still low alcohol). 

A nice menu of food.  Please try the Bacon Candy if you are someone who likes bacon.  The brown sugar glaze on it was fantastic, not over done.  I could eat this as a meal.  We also had the Margherita pizza.  Not the largest of pizza's, but the crust was extra crunchy on the outside, yet chewy on the inside....yeah, good stuff.

Staff here is knowledgable, friendly, fast and efficient.  

Huge fan and I will be back, there are plenty of great beers and pizzas that I 'need' to have!"}
{"text":"The first thing I noticed when walking in, was the smell. For me, wasn't a pizza smell, like you would expect, but a coal-firey, brick oven smell. So cozy and warm, it made me want to stay awhile.

We grabbed some seats at the bar after being told it would be about a half hour wait... Literally 3 minutes later, we were told a table was ready. The bar is really spacious (see pics) and the chairs are large and comfortable; we decided to stay at the bar.

The girl that took our drink order wore dreads and a high bun, and was not very attentive. She was kind at best and sort of rushed me with placing my drink order. I saw her behind the bar laughing with the manager(?) and striking a lighter behind the bar while talking (loudly) about her weekend plans. I love when people love their jobs,  but could you get my wine first? Then another lady took our orders (who was much better in my opinion), although I didn't catch her name. It was a little confusing with the flip-flopping of servers, considering there were no introductions or \"let me explain what type of place this is, this is your first time\", but it was fine in the end.

Random, but I really did love the plates, glasses, and cutlery here. Very modern and matched the ambiance nicely, I thought.

I ordered the Ocean pizza and he ordered the Carnivore. Following the obligatory taste test, we both agreed we enjoyed the flavors in the ocean pizza better than the carnivore. The ocean had clams, shrimp, and possibly scallops with a garlic paste and fontina cheese... Some type of lemon aioli was in it, and who knows what else because it was so delicious, I stopped tasting for awhile. The meat on the other pie was very good and not too salty, as most meat pizzas tend to be. The crust was on the softer side. It was perfect, doughy, and delicious, in my opinion. Although my husband prefers more of a crispy-bottomed pie, he still finished it without complaints. The toppings were generous and after completion, we were both full, but not stuffed. Aka, we could walk comfortably out of the restaurant, which I am not used to! 

The bathrooms were clean with plenty of mirrors to pick the pizza sauce out of your teeth afterwards... our check was about $65 for 2 pies, and about 3 drinks. Not too shabby. 

We migrated for dessert, so next time I'm here, I would definitely love to try out some of their sweets, specifically, the candy bacon. 

The reasons for the 3 starts goes as follows: one of the main reasons we chose to stay seated at the bar is due to there being a skinny little aisle to walk down, which you share with the servers and the backs of anyone else sitting in the aisle. So the tables are all in a row and if you sit in a chair, your back is kind of in the open and you're constantly having to move in (I would assume). The bar is huge, but instead I think they should put all that extra space into seating, since it felt a little crampy when walking. I decided I would be really annoyed if I had to constantly push my chair in due to people walking behind me all night. 

The second reason is, when I eat out somewhere, I'm always hoping for an experience. I need that something that makes you stand out from other brick ovens, and a large opportunity for that to happen is during the server/customer interaction. There wasn't a whole lot of that for me and it kind of dulled the experience. Great food? Yes. Good prices? For sure. Ambiance? Check... Some small kinks to work out that cost a few stars, but I would certainly return."}
{"text":"Great pizza & excellent beer. What more can you ask for!?"}
{"text":"Proper Brick tap room is a cute little restaurant with cool ambiance but terrible food. My dad ordered the pizza which was OK at best. I ordered the pesto pasta and it was absolutely tasteless. It was pretty much plain pasta covered in oil. I was trying to be a good sport and eat what I could but it was just not possible. 

Now to the good part...

I'm usually not one to complain so I was reluctant to say anything but the waiter noticed I hadn't touched my food. I told him I couldn't eat the pasta and he immediately got the manager. Kevin (the manager) was AMAZING. I didn't want to make a big stink but Kevin was quick to take care of it. He offered something else but at that point I just wanted to call it a night. He took the pasta off the bill and sent me home with a delicious cheesecake. Yah, I'm easily bought...but I was pretty impressed with how considerate the staff were. 

I wouldn't go here again for dinner, but there was an extensive beer list. I was so impressed with the service I'd definitely come by for a drink!"}
{"text":"As a jersey girl I am always looking for good pizza in Pittsburgh! I originally intended to go to Stone by the point but no one was there so I checked the next place on yelp which was this place and decided to go here with my boyfriend instead! It was a Tuesday night and the place had some people but the waiter was very quick and nice. 

The pizza was amazing!! Got a margherita and a Bianca pie and split both. Bianca was excellent and the other one was just a step below. Absolutely loved this place and will come back. The pizza is a little pricey but definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Second chances are often warranted and was proven worthy for our return visit to PBOTR. We were underwhelmed during our first visit so selecting this location before our show at the theater was a last minute choice. But we are so glad we made the choice to go back. First let me tell you the place was crowded, but we were able to be seated immediately probably because we arrived early around 5:30. 

Our waiter, Tyler, was very friendly and helpful to make a few suggestions on what we should order. This time we stayed away from pizza that we ordered the first visit, which was in our opinion just average.

This time we elected to have an appetizer which we chose the crispy duck wings and in all honesty they were just average and we probably wouldn't order them again, however our entr√©es were beyond fabulous. We ordered the barbecue brisket mac & cheese and the amazing grilled shrimp with butternut squash risotto. I can't say enough about how fabulous both of these dishes were and I would certainly go back there just to order those again. I will be dreaming about that risotto for a long time. I suppose your experience depends on what you order. But do go and enjoy this place when in town."}
{"text":"Pizza was great, the craft beer selection was extensive and the ability to sample was welcomed. Definitely my new craft brew bar!!! And they are open on sunday afternoons unlike other bars in the area."}
{"text":"Delicious bacon candy! We had to try it!! Had the carnivore pizza! Delicious! The waitresses were super nice too!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I start every Saturday morning with the food network and this past Saturday, we watched a competition about pizza.  I got the craving and after a bit of research, insisted we do a little date night to Proper Brick Oven.  We didn't end up leaving the house until around 10pm and when I called to make sure the kitchen was still open, I was told their main kitchen was closing in a few minutes, but they would still be slinging pizzas until about 1130.  Perfect.  It was relatively busy as Pittsburgh's Beer Fest as well as the nighttime 5K and the Pickleburgh event had just ended, but we were seated quickly and a waitress was over to get our order.

This is the type of place you want to get at least one pizza per person plus an appetizer.  Their pizzas are 8-count and while it was fine to split for a not-so-heavy meal at 1030pm, for an actual dinner, I could've probably eaten more.  

We ordered the seafood pizza and it was amazing.  It wasn't crispy burnt like a lot of other brick oven pizzas I've had.  It was chewy and soft and the crust tasted like a breadstick.  Seriously, really good. I would have definitely tried another pizza as well as maybe one of their salads or the candied bacon everyone raves about, but there will be time for that during our next trip!

For drinks - I ordered the Pittsburgh mule per our waitress' suggestion and my boyfriend ordered his typical pineapple beer.  I am not huge on most craft beers, but their cocktail and wine list looked good.  Our total bill was around $40 for the pizza to split and two drinks.  Not bad for a delicious, quick meal before heading out for some more drinks.  I don't eat pizza often, but when I do - this will be my new go-to!"}
{"text":"This place exceeded my expectations.   Went here as a work group of 20 for dinner.   The place is decorated very nicely, mason jar overhead lighting, very comfortable.   The cocktail, wine and beer menus are extensive.  I opted for the Rhuberry Lemonade, rhubard flavored vodka, lemonade and muddled raspberries...very tasty and refreshing.   Our group of 20 sat at 2 separate tables of 10.   Both tables ordered the housemade potato chips with homemade french onion dip (yum).  We also ordered 3 salads which were adequate to share among 10 people.  We ordered the BLT, House and an Arugula salad.   Each was fresh, nicely dressed and tasty.   Collectively we ordered the Margherita, Meditteranean, Bianca, and the Carnivore.  Each pizza was tasty in it's own rite.   The crust was perfect, not too thick, not too thin with the right amount of crunch.  The toppings were fresh and generous.   A co-worker and I split the butterscotch bread pudding, it was served warm and delicious ( I wish that I had ordered one just for myself, it was pretty good).  I would definitely return to Proper Brick Oven when visiting Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I was impressed by the food and the craft beer selection.  The staff is very attentive and they let you try different beers until you find something you like.  The pizzas are extraordinary, and everybody who works here is helpful and hard working.  The location is in the heart of the Cultural District, so this place is a perfect watering hole for before or after a play or performance."}
{"text":"Didn't go back to this place after my bad experience. But I got a message through yelp from the restaurant told me that one of the pizza was waived on my order. No apology to me. Thought I should update my review base on this. At least they did something to make it up."}
{"text":"What a gem! We had just one night in Pittsburgh so I chose this place based on Yelp reviews. So glad I did! 

The restaurant is in a stand alone building on the corner. Half of the building is covered in vines. The facade is immediately inviting.

Inside, the seating area is long and narrow. You can sit right in front of the pizza oven, along the bar, at family style high tops in the back, or at a booth. We sat at a booth in front of the bar and I would recommend requesting this area if you can.

The waitress was knowledgeable and friendly. She explained that they make as much as possible from scratch using the freshest ingredients. Based on Yelp reviews, we ordered the Forest and Pesto pizzas. Two smalls were plenty for the two of us. The dough is handmade and hand tossed and it shows. Wow, it's amazing! Soft and chewy. The toppings pack a flavorful punch. The Forest was our favorite. Delicious! $17 each.

I also ordered the chips (handmade) and could have done without them. They are good, but I had more than enough to eat without them! $4.

My mom ordered a bottle of wine. The waitress was happy to give her a taste of an open bottle first to make sure she liked it. I ordered a flight of four beers for $10. They had a great selection of wheats, ales, IPAs and stouts all on draft. There were several beers from San Diego and just as we were about to leave, they put a new beer on the board: habanero Sculpin from Ballast Point! No way - that's my favorite!! Of course I had to stay for a pint. #vacation

Insider Tip: the theater parking across the street is worth it for $9 flat rate. Other lots are more expensive. Otherwise there is street parking with a two hour limit."}
{"text":"I've had good food here in Pittsburgh, but I've never had anything that made me realize what the term \"mouth-watering\" really meant... until going to Proper.
The first bite of my spinach ricotta dumpling appetizer LITERALLY made my mouth water, it was that good. The cucumber melon soup was a winner too, and managed to not only NOT remind me of shower gel, but also set off flavor fireworks in my mouth! 

My friend got the infamous brick oven pizza, Finocchio I believe. If you have a passion for good pizza, and I mean authentic, fresh ingredient pizza, this spot is where it's at!"}
{"text":"They serve great food here. I came here as it was at some point on the ranked listing (probably still is) for Pittsburgh at night during a weekday evening. As such, it wasn't too busy but I wouldn't be surprised it was much more busy on nights where there are shows nearby at the Benedum Center (it's downtown near here) or on the weekends in general when people tend to have more time/not have to go to work in the morning. I ended up ordering Bacon Candy and the Carnivore Pizza. Boy did the Bacon Candy end up being a delightful way to start. Did not expect that bacon could taste so sweet, yet so good at the same time. It wasn't dry at all in my mouth, which meant that it was fried just right (not overfried/overcooked) and as such, it was a worthy appetizer to begin the meal. Next came the Carnivore Pizza, which (if the name doesn't give it away enough) is a pizza with a load of meat on the top, including belly bacon, Italian sausage, and pepperoni. The pizza was just fantastic. The meats were incredibly yummy and wonderfully complemented one another and as such, it was just a great meal all around. Highly worth coming here if you haven't been here before. One of the better pizza places to try in Pittsburgh, if you ask me."}
{"text":"Nothing really to say here.  It's pizza."}
{"text":"I'm sitting in Proper and I'm extremely impressed with the service and food.  Amy is our waitress, and she is phenomenal.  She didn't rush us, and answered all our questions with a smile.  The general manager, Kevin stopped by and was friendly and helpful beyond our expectations!   I can't recommend this place enough!  The food was great!!!  Get there early if you want to get a table."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat in Pittsburgh. For awhile, it became the \"go-to\" place for some friends and I on Tuesday evenings (they are closed on Mondays). At this point, I think I have had every pizza on the menu and my two favorites are the Carnivore Pizza and the Ocean Pizza + Bacon (you can add bacon to any pizza!). The pizza's are thin-crust and cooked in a wood-fired pizza oven which gives the crust a great bake and crunch around the outside. The portions are individually sized, and some people will finish while others will have extra. 

The best appetizer they have is the Bacon Candy. It is thick cut bacon that is caramelized with brown sugar. While there have been a few nights when it has been subpar, in general it was a perfect mix of crispy, chewy, salty and sweet. The only nights we didn't order it, were those when they had run out.

They also have a chalk board behind the bar with broad selection of beers on tap which change on a regular basis."}
{"text":"very good pizza.  nice selection of craft draft beer.  staff was friendly.  i will go back to this place when i am in Pitt."}
{"text":"M and I wandered in here in the cold and I couldn't be happier that we did.  It's in the old Tambellini place and they really spruced it up inside. 

I decided on the Harvest pizza - a melange of pumpkin, butternut squash, sausage, cheese and herbs.What really made me think that this was a stand out pie was the crust.  Chewy, crunchy, slightly blackened on the edges.  All in all delicious, albeit a bit too blackened in some spots. 

M had the bianca which was your traditional white pizza but with homemade ricotta.  Delicious!

I will definitely be returning to try the desserts and the awesome drink menu."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was great--delicious food--exceptional service by Victoria .... who never stopped smiling the entire evening. We're coming back tomorrow and asking for her!!!!"}
{"text":"I visited Proper Brick Oven & Tap Room on a Sunday afternoon for lunch after desperately trying to find a pizza place that was open in Pittsburgh, and Yelp recommended this place. It was relatively empty when we arrived and were seated immediately.

Our server, overall, was fantastic. It seemed like he was managing every table of customers with how often he walked up and down the bar and asked how people were doing, but was extremely attentive to us as we dined. Not being particularly hungry, my boyfriend and I ordered a Carnivore Pizza and the Proper House Salad. The salad was good, but the lettuce and apples were slightly watery. The pizza was okay as well. The toppings were not as flavorful as expected, but it got the job done.

Looking around the dining room, it was very nicely decorated and did appear as though they had an excellent beer selection! We overheard another server telling their table that the manager hand draws the chalk signs for the brews."}
{"text":"Hmm... not sure how to rate this place. I want to love this place, but the food made it hard for me to say I'll be back. The ambiance is great. You walk in and see a wood burning oven where they make the pizza, so it's very cozy. I went with a group for lunch on a Saturday with no reservations and we got seated fairly quickly. (4 stars)

Unfortunately, the food was a sub par. We got two pizzas, one pesto and one forest (mushrooms). Those were pretty tasty, but the crust was a bit soggy. I usually like my thin crust pizzas to be crispier. (3 stars) We also ordered two lamb rollatinis and one crab pasta to share. They were part of the specials menu. The presentation was nice, but the lamb had too much chewy (and crunchy) cartilage in the meat. I found myself wanting to (sorry this is gross) spit it out. The risotto that it sat on was undercooked and slightly crunchy. The crab pasta was meh. It definitely could have been more dynamic. I was in good company, so I had a good time, but I don't think I'd go back for the food. (2 stars)"}
{"text":"In Proper, I've found yet another great restaurant for pre-show dinner in the Cultural District, and another great wood-fired pizza place downtown.  (As usual, Yelp comes through again!)  I visited for dinner last night prior to seeing the Book of Mormon at Heinz Hall with a friend, and it didn't disappoint.

Based on other reviewers' advice, I suggested that we start off with an order of the bacon candy.  This didn't take much convincing on my friend's part, since he's a major bacon aficionado.  His verdict, and I quote, was, \"This is the best bacon I've ever tasted!\" I haven't been to bacon night at Harris Grill, but he has, and he claims this bacon puts theirs to shame.  For my part, I can only say that I fully endorse his statement about it being the best bacon I'd ever tasted.  The flavor was rich, smoky, and complex, with the perfect salty/sweet balance.  Should you pay Proper a visit, I highly recommend that you try it!

For our entree, we decided on the pesto pizza, which, in addition to pesto, is topped with Roma tomatoes, caramelized onions, bacon bits (the real kind), and mozzarella, with a generous sprinkle of freshly-grated parmesan cheese.  While the flavor of the toppings was good overall, I concur with Jason F.'s comment that some bites that included only one or a couple of the ingredients tasted strange, since not all of the flavors could meld together as intended.  Additionally, the pesto was a bit different than my friend I had envisioned--it was rather concentrated, and dotted on the pizza, rather than having a creamier consistency and the spreading, as we'd imagined--which made its flavor overpowering at points. On the positive side, the flavor of the caramelized onions was good, and added a nice note to overall flavor the pizza.  (This is a really positive endorsement from me, since I usually dislike onions and was considering removing them.)  Also, unlike one of the other wood-fired pizzas I've tried at another restaurant downtown, the crust was a bit on the thicker side, and was crispy throughout, so they did a good job cooking the pie.  The bacon plus one pie was sufficient for the two of us, b/c we didn't want leftovers since we were heading to the show afterward, and it worked out well.

In addition to the food, my friend and I both ordered the cider snap, a seasonal cocktail that includes apple cider and vodka.  It was sweet, but not overly so, and we both enjoyed it very much.  (I particularly enjoyed the piece of sugared ginger that came with it as a garnish!)  It definitely made for a great start to the meal, and complemented the bacon candy well once it was served.  My friend also ordered an IPA--I forget the exact name, but it was the hoppiest one on the menu, according to the waitress.  It actually turned out to be a bit too hoppy for my friend, but he ordered it at his own risk, in light of the waitress's verdict!

In the interest of time, my friend and I opted to sit at the bar--we were able to find two seats at the far end without a problem.  We enjoyed the ambiance, which includes exposed brick and ball jar \"shades\" on the lights dangling from the ceiling.  Service was efficient, and we had no issues making it to the show on time, even though we arrived a bit later than we'd planned.  One more thing: My friend left his sunglasses on the bar when we left.  Ironically, just as he was describing his tendency to lose sunglasses to me, as if on cue, a waiter caught us on the corner and returned his sunglasses.  For that alone, the service gets a 5+ star rating!"}
{"text":"I stopped here after the arts festival. It was really busy but they seated me quickly. 
My hostess was freindly and helpful and I chose the infamous bacon candy, which was good. 
I then chose one of the wood fired pizzas, The pesto pizza with onions, garlic, tomatoes, bacon and pesto. It was the best wood fired pizza I've tasted yet. 
Would love to eat here again and try different food and dessert."}
{"text":"The bar is designed very nicely and large enough to have a meal if you want to eat at the bar. The drinks were prepared very well and the pizza was amazing. I will come back here just for the pizza!  Good stuff!!"}
{"text":"This is my first time in Steel City and as I was staying downtown, I wanted to try a local spot within walking distance of the courtyard.  I ordered the wings which is a new menu item, do not bother with those, from a wing fanatic they are below average.  Not to mention he wings were $13 for 6.  Though the beer selection is great, though again over priced.  I am drinking the Double Vice CoffeePorter which is also very good, though $7.50/pint.  It is a pricier establishment than what I am used to in Indianapolis, but decent beer selection.  Nothing special, but not bad."}
{"text":"How do you properly review a place that has close to 200 reviews without sounding redundant?  Go with your gut.  No, honestly, go with your gut.  The food speaks for itself here.

I stopped in with my friend for lunch and left with more than enough to cover my dinner later in the day.  We both took our time looking over the menus before we were firm in our decisions.  There is a food menu and a drink menu, make sure to look over both as to not waste any time when the server stops back.  

When our server arrived we both had our order ready.  I decided that the pesto pizza was exactly what I needed at that point in my day.  To say that this is fresh is a huge understatement and does not do it justice one bit.  Fresh dough topped with house made mozzarella cheese, EVOO, nice chunks of tomatoes, caramelized onions, and some of the best pesto I have ever tasted.  And coming from that brick oven made that pizza just that much better.  Each bite did a dance in my mouth, the flavors were so amazing that I was half tempted to eat it all in that sitting.  But I refrained knowing that later that day I would be able to come back to my leftovers and be mighty happy.

The beers on tap are quite extensive and switch up often.  Something to keep you coming back here."}
{"text":"Went and had the carnivore pizza and it was really good but not enough to fill me up since I split it with my mom. I then ordered the honey duck wings and they were really good. She had USSR stout and really liked it."}
{"text":"I love this place.  It's a little pricey, but worth it. Their pizza is exquisite,  with unique recipes and high quality ingredients.  Their cocktails are creative, and the wine list is decent. The obvious star is the extensive craft beer selection. The atmosphere is fitting for a dressy-but-casual evening or afternoon date. The staff are fantastic,  too. A group of 12 family members and I recently went there, and they were incredibly accommodating, despite the demands of a party that size and with such big personalities."}
{"text":"Good solid place to eat. Prices were the going rate, the service was good and our party of three enjoyed themselves. When we're back in Pittsburgh, we'll be back."}
{"text":"This has to be some of the best pizza I have had. Everything is made in house, which makes it better for you and better tasting. The mushroom alfredo pasta is also amazing. I have never had a alfredo that is so creamy, yet light. The food is worth the trip.

The restaurant itself has very New York style feel on the inside, the outside of the building hides the fact that it is a casual fancy place. Great for dates, but great for a casual get together as well! Service is quick and the staff is friendly.  

Overall wonderful place."}
{"text":"The house salad was fantastic!   The sever very sweet...too bad I didnt get her name but were from California.  We originally  wanted to go to Napolitano but that place was soo hot I wouldnt be able to eat but this place was perfect! My bf had the Margarita  pizza and I had the conavore (recommended by the server) she was so sweet & kind....THANK YOU for your service!"}
{"text":"If you're on Penn Avenue & looking for a not-run-of-the-mill Italian place, then check out Proper Brick Oven.  Some colleagues and I did just that on a beautiful day that made the walk over here totally worth it.

Now the pizzas here can be pricey in contrast to what you'd pay at, say, Monte Cellos.  But the sandwiches are comparably priced to any decent restaurant around here.  Actually, what they have here are puccias--homemade stuffed Pugliese sandwich rolls.  I ordered the antipasti puccia, consisting of spicy pepperoni with capicolla and roasted red pepper topped off with smoked mozzarella.  Definitely not something you'd find at Subway!

Proper Brick Oven isn't a place I'd eat at everyday, but it does make for a great occasional treat.  I'm going to someday check out their brunch."}
{"text":"Great service. Great beer selection. Great menu. We shared a salad and a lamb dinner-both delicious. Had room for bread pudding dessert. Also wonderful. Nothing not to like!!"}
{"text":"I loved this place.  I was in town for a conference and found my way over here one evening.  It's a small place, but quiet and comfortable.  The service was prompt and friendly.  And the pizza was outstanding.  I am a sucker for wood-fired pizza, and this one was done to perfection.  The crust had some charring on the bottom.  The crushed tomato sauce had a bit of sweetness to it, but I loved it.  There was plenty of cheese and topping.  This will be a go-to place the next time I'm in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, good service and a great menu...highly recommend the bacon appetizer and the macaroni and cheese brisket. Pizza is good too. The pesto pomodoro read and sounded great, but was weak on Pedro flavor and very salty.

Will definitely go back!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and drink! Horrible if you have young kids in tow. Definitely a hipster place! Not kid friendly at all!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a whim. The 2 of us sat at the bar. Our bartender was Dan. Very nice guy. We had the mussels to start and they were very good. Then we split a Primavera pizza...all I can say is WOW. It was very good.  Mascarpone cheese, asparagus and prosciutto. The crust was very good, with great flavor from the brick oven. The food was reasonably priced.  They have a few outdoor tables too, but it was a little too warm when we got there. Highly recommend, great place to take a date.."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times and always found my food delicious. Today I went and had an autumn sangria, half house salad, and the forest pizza (mushroom and shallot with balsamic drizzle).  I really enjoyed my meal a lot, I just think they're priced a little higher than necessary.  I had 1 drink that was nearly all ice, the half salad, and pizza ~ after tip I spent $40. Seems excessive."}
{"text":"A group of us stopped by for an early lunch before seeing a White Christmas. At 11:30 we were about the only people in the restaurant though by 1230, it was packed. I was surprised to see that the majority of the space inside was taken by the bar. There were some tables in font, on the side and behind the bar but, I imagined the inside space to be bigger the several times I walked by. 
I started my lunch with a half house salad. Within a few minutes our waitress brought out the first course. The salad consisted of bibb lettuce, candied walnuts, pears and goat cheese in a white Balsamic dressing. I opted for no goat cheese. The sweet dressing paired nicely with the crisp pears and crunchy walnuts. There was even a small piece of a savory bread loaf on the side. I honestly couldn't have asked for a better salad. Everything about it was perfect. Speaking of perfection, within a few minutes, my entree - Margherita pizza arrived. This was easily the best Margherita pizza I have had in years. The San marzano tomatoes tasted like the we're picked off the vine and crushed specifically for my pizza, so fresh. The house made mozzarella was melted to perfection. The crust had the exact amount of crisp and crunch one would desire. I almost didn't want to share but alas, I was unable to finish all of the 8 (!!!!) slices so I offered it around. I also happened to get to try a few of the desserts on the menu which changes frequently. My favorites were the apple jack Gelato and the cherry cheesecake with a fruity pebble crust. Who knew that kids' cereal could be reinvented into something so yummy. I felt like we were in an episode of Chopped. Overall, the service was great, the atmosphere was pleasant and the food was incredible. This will be my new go to before seeing a show."}
{"text":"Mom and I stopped for lunch before our show.  We were seated right away at noon.  Our server was very friendly and took good care of us.  The house chips were a tad on the soggy side, but the onion dip was amazing.  Mom and I split the pizza bianco.  The roasted garlic sauce made this dish! We had some time so we split the chocolate bread pudding and it did not disappoint! This might be our new lunch spot before the show."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here to celebrate his birthday. We went on a Saturday, and it was busy, but we were seated in about 10 minutes or so.

We both ordered a Proper House Salad that is prepared with goat cheese, pear, and candied walnuts, and tossed with a white balsamic dressing. You have the option to have the half size ($6) or the full size ($10; pictured). We both opted for the regular size since we were hungry, and it's a good thing we did because the salad wasn't that large. It's not that we wanted to fill up on salad, but for $10 each, I think the salad was over-priced. 

We ordered the carnivore pizza, and it was so good that we ordered one to go for lunch the next day. It was just the right amount of pizza. I usually prefer a more seasoned tomato sauce on my pizza, but since there was a lot of flavor with the different meats, the overall taste was pretty balanced. The price of the pizza was a little high ($17-$18), but this was a special occasion. 

We finished the night with the strawberry-lemon cheesecake. I didn't get a chance to take a picture of this because it was so good! I didn't even look at the cost on this part of our meal.

Overall, the experience was really great! We had a great time, great food, and great service. We will probably go back, but not frequently due to the cost."}
{"text":"Wow! What a delicious addition to downtown PGH! We had 2 appetizers- the candy bacon & fried chickpeas which were both delish. Then we shared 3 pizzas & a salad btwn the 4 of us. All really good! We had the Forest, Carnivore and Black & Gold along with the Amalfi salad. We couldn't decide which pizza was our favorite bc they were all great. I would recommend adding bacon to the B&G as it needed a little something so perhaps that was our least fav but we still finished all of it. 

As a non-beer drinker, I wish they had more hard cider options but that's not a deal breaker for me. My friends were very happy with the wide selection of craft beer!

And to top it off we shared 2 desserts-- flour less chocolate cake & the almond thingy. What a wonderful way to end a great meal. 

We will return as much as we can before the lines and the wait becomes too long!"}
{"text":"I've come here with my boyfriend twice now and both times the food and atmosphere have been wonderful. Last time we had the Funghi pizza and last night we had the Sopressatta pizza. The Funghi was definitely our favorite. The crust isn't too crispy like with a lot of brick oven pizzas-just the right amount of chewy and crispy. The BLT salad is delicious, although the roasted tomatoes were a little too roasted for me last night. They loved their candied bacon...we thought it was okay-a little too sweet for us. They have awesome beer choices and the bartender is honest about what's good and legitimately wants you to have a good time. I think we will make this a regular spot for us!"}
{"text":"Absolutely stellar selection of Crafts with a bar staff anxious and glad to help you make the choice which best suits your taste buds!  Best bar staff in a casual atmosphere that I've experienced in downtown Pittsburgh thus far (10 months & counting)"}
{"text":"There was a long wait and the hostess said she would come get me when the table was ready, she came up a few times to tell me where I was at on the list. My waiter was super great too. I love the staff."}
{"text":"The smell of the pizza just lures you in.  Typically I do not eat pizza crust but at Proper, I enjoyed every last bite- the crust was the perfect combination of crispiness and doughiness.  We ordered the house chips which come with a side of caramelized onion dip; the bianca which is a white pizza with garlic sauce, burrata, fontina, ricotta; and the carnivore.  Everything was delicious but we LOVED the bianca.  Dreaming of Proper pizza until my wedding diet is over ;p"}
{"text":"Went after a show at the Byham.  Wish I could have seen their full menu,  they were only serving pizza when we went.  Good thing that was what we were craving and it was so tasty!"}
{"text":"I am with the common theme.... Great beer selection and people but the food didn't justify the price.  We ordered the chips which we counted 12.  They came with an onion sauce that was good but very similar to the onion packets you mix with sour cream.  The beer was regularly priced but not sure the glasses were a full pint.  We then got the beet salad which included what they called vinaigrette dressing but they might as well call it vinegar dressing.  I will say the goat cheese balls were delicious that came with the salad.

Our family is a big fan of stone brick oven pizza and that is why we choose this place in the first place when visiting from out of town.   I unfortunately would put this pizza at the bottom of our list for stone oven pizzas.  I will wish the owners good luck since they were extremely nice but we will not come back given that we feel there was not enough value for the cost."}
{"text":"I can't say that I'm impressed in anyway with this restaurant.  I arrived slightly after the rest of my group, but after sitting it took the waiter three trips before he even asked for my drink order.  It's not like the place was that busy as it had only been one hour since opening.  I ordered the Bloody Proper.  This was probably the worst Bloody Mary I have ever had.  It was very sweet, tasted too strong of vodka and it had little to no spice/heat to it.  I didn't even finish it.  I got the carnivore pizza and was expecting to be impressed as this is a pizza place.  Sadly it was lackluster at best.  It was very greasy and when picked up everything slid right off the crust.  I would have sent it back for further baking; however, the crust edges were already so chard that it would have been like eating charcoal if I had it cooked longer.  I will say it that the flavor was palatable once you got past the grease.  The pizza was only big enough for one hungry person so if going out with some one else expect to shell out $15+ for each pizza.  I then got a beer that was not as cold as would be expected.  The original beer that I wanted they did not have, and the beer selection was not all that impressive considering it is a \"Tap House\".

Overall,  the bill came to $40+, which for me is not bad (I don't mind spending decent money when the food is exquisite and the service impeccable); however, for greasy pizza, bad drinks and poor service.  Very unimpressed and will not be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here for the first time. The food was good. Great service & atmosphere and the food came out very fast. 
Everything we got was delicious! Their pizzas are made in a brick oven. Which gives the pizza a great taste. Would definitely recommend checking them out."}
{"text":"I've visited Proper yesterday with a large work group. My overall experience was A-Ok.  The special sauce of this restaurant is obviously its pizza. Not the biggest fan of pizza and wasn't in the mood for it. Instead, I chose to order one of their pasta dishes (Gamberetto). So felt like I played in part in not getting the best experience. I wasn't impressed by the Gamberetto dish. The flavors that I thought would be jumping out of it fell completely flat. The jumbo shrimp were overcooked and chewy. I could barely discern the flavor of garlic. The veggies (asparagus and spinach) were overcooked. I had to salt my dish a few times, something that I very rarely do.

I was kind of surprised by all of this because the apps we ordered were more solid. The prosciutto wrapped shrimp on top of wilted spinach was very flavorful as was the broth that came with the beer mussels.

I have to say that our server was on top of his game and made the night enjoyable. When he walked over to take our order, I could see a look of confusion on his face because we had not received any menus when we were seated by the hostess. He took care of that like stat! We were almost 10 in our group and while she gave us all dinner menus, she only left two drink menus, but our server quickly took care of that as well. He made the evening run smoothly. And for that reason, I will try Proper again, but ordering pizza next time!"}
{"text":"Great pizza thin crust friendly staff.  Great beers.   They know pizza.  Similar to Neapolitan style."}
{"text":"DEFINITELY one of our favorites in the area since our first visit. Wonderful food, a great beer and cider selection, and a nice atmosphere. If you haven't been there yet, I'd definitely recommend it. Everything we've ever eaten there has been great and there are SO many things on the menu that look amazing that we haven't had time to try."}
{"text":"Great pizza (other great Italian selection also). Great food - more variety of beers on tap than you can imagine. Vegan friendly. Great management and service. A credit to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"It's often hard to find a place with BOTH a good beer selection and good food. Proper Brick Oven is a fabulous place to get both. Their draft selection is fantastic. They have a solid variety of local beers with a good mix of imports and seasonals. Their staff isn't quite as beer savvy as you would want with the selection- they described two beer styles completely different than what they actually are so you might want to look up stuff yourself. We got the black and gold pizza and this is some of the best pizza I've had in Pittsburgh. The house chips and caramelized onion dip was fantastic as well as the pepperoni pagnotta. The fish sandwich with citrus aioli and slaw didn't quite blend the right flavors together but everything else was awesome!"}
{"text":"We finally had a nice server at Proper. Thank you Alan for being kind and patient. The pizza was delicious and so are the fresh salads. There is usually a wait on the weekend, but a week night is not so bad. Sit by the pizza oven, it's fun to watch. Love this city and all it has to offer."}
{"text":"Proper...I want to love you, but you have some work to do.  Maybe I will up this at some point; but for now, it is a three star.  

I have dined here once and sat at the bar three or four times.  There is a lot that I love about the place.  It's really pretty with a modern flair that is balanced by the old brick feel.  The bar chairs are comfy (albeit a little hard to get into and out of because they are crammed in there).  The bar list is excellent, with cocktails, beer, and wine sure to please anyone.   The food has always been very good, but there are weird little annoyances.  For example, they have a hummus platter (which is excellent); but it's served with a super-skimpy portion of pita (which is not excellent).  I feel like they should have figure that whole thing out by now.  

Service has been hit or miss, with mostly misses.  On my most recent visit, it was not busy at all because it was still early.  There were FIVE people behind the bar, yet our drinks were empty for at least 5 minutes until we finally caught someone's attention.  That just shouldn't happen."}
{"text":"Great pizza, great beer and friendly staff. We enjoyed our late night dinner here. We were a bit leery because it was after 9pm and we had 2 school aged kids (just in from a long drive) but they were great. The place is definitely geared toward an adult crowd but our foodie kids found plenty they liked too. A great first dinner in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Fantastic beer tap selection.  Fantastic pizza.  Service was awful.  Had to go to the bar to get drinks as the waiter ignored my request for service 3 times.  If I go back, I will only sit at the bar."}
{"text":"Although a little pricey, the pizza was really great. It's not quite as good as Il Pizzaiolo, but the creative toppings and the brick oven make it a delicious alternative. 

Beware of the small size of the $5 chips appetizer and high beer prices. Anything over 8% is served in a tiny glass, but they don't tell you prior to your order. 

I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Was in town for a couple Pirates Mets games and stumbled across this restaurant. I ordered the carnivore pizza. It was excellent. It was different from dither wood fired pizza crusts. The crust was soft and flavorful. Everything about the pizza was great. Also enjoyed a nice craft double IPA. Good beer selection along with unique wood fired pizza."}
{"text":"Death by brick oven pizza!!! We have died and gone to pizza and craft beer heaven! We ordered the Forest, and Pesto pizza along with the Craft Bacon!!! Victoria took great care of us and recommended some amazing beers. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"In my family we eat a lot of pizza. All pizza is welcomed, deep dish, wood fired, grilled, you name it I'll eat it. While I notice a lot of wood fired pizza doughs taste pretty similar... proper stands out with its unique tasting dough. 

Some co-workers and I stopped in for lunch one day and I couldn't wait to take my mama the next time! The pizza is thrown into an 800 degree brick oven before making it to your dinner table and they let the made from scratch dough rise for 3 days before it is used. I really haven't tasted a dough quite like propers which is why I think it is the best wood fired pizza in Pittsburgh and I have tried a lot. I ordered the Bianca which is delicious! If you love ricotta cheese you must get this pizza. My mom ordered the margarita pizza and she had no complaints. We both took our leftovers home because they are pretty big pizzas and come with 8 slices. My mom ordered the house chips to start and it came with French onion dip on the side. She really raved about these chips for a while! Some people might think the pizzas are a little pricey, but it is so worth every penny because this isn't just your average tasting pizza. Their menu isn't just all about pizza, they have soups, sandwiches, pastas and salads. Also I can't forget the pretty awesome tap selection. Our server was very attentive when it came to our drinks, boxes and making sure our food was tasting okay. If you have Proper on your radar, get there fast... you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Okay, I am writing this while dining here. So this is being written live (fancy right?). 


To start, they have 1 bathroom upstairs - for 1 person only. Others are down stairs to use. No biggy. 

The waiter on the other hand, started off saying hello etc. We told him our spouses were in the bathroom ( 4 of us total). We made a joke about them always having small bladders, he proceeded to tell us about he went to a strip club he went to during a noon time and how water was $4 per glass.

The water we got tasted fine. No off tastes. So fine 


So, just laughed it off... but pretty weird. Luckily our spouses weren't at the table. 

Other wise he's been good so far, he just took our orders and was very plain. Again, no biggy. 

Just put an order in. 
* 1 pepperoni pagnotta 
* BLT salad
* 1 margarita pizza 
* 1 carnivore pizza 

So waiting now. - is its 530 on Sunday - so the steelers are playing. Busyness is about 3/5. We were sat quickly - no wait. 

We've been waiting for our food for about 5 minutes only. On a good track so far. 

UPDATE: took about 10 mins for the salad and pepperoni pagnotta to get here. BLT Salad was amazing. 

The pepperoni bread was not so good. It came with marinara sauce - which was awesome!!
The actual pepperoni bread was not good. Hated it actually. It was dry, over cooked, and cold in the center. We don't even want to finish it. - don't get it, seriously if it's going to be similar to that. It's like it's been sitting out. Awful. The sauce again though, great. 

We ended up returning it and not getting anything else. They just removed off of our bill for us. They were great about it. 

Our pizza took about 15 mins total (for both) to get here. 15 minutes for 2 pizzas i think is great timing. 

The pizza - were damn good. The carnivore pizza was awesome tasting with all of the meat. The margarita pizza was also good. Sort of bland. But would def get it again over all. 

We didn't want dessert, our 2 friends got \"Emily's chocolate cake\". So waiting for it now. Be back in 1 second when you look below this lel. 

(Misc not while waiting for the cake; our water that comes in a stylish water bottle, has been empty and hasn't been refilled for a while. Again, not the end of the world.) 

Okie we're back. Took about 7-8 mins max to get here. I think it was well worth the wait. Looks tremendous, the plating looks top notch as well as the overall color pallet. 

Out of 10 (10 being one of the best desserts they've ever had), they rated it 9. Which is phenomenal! 

Over all I would give it a 3. 
Why 3/5?
*The waiter wasn't warm & told a very crude story within 10 seconds of meeting him. 
* The pepperoni pagnotta was seriously awful
* The pizza was soggy even though being baked at 800 degrees
*  No water refill at all
*  Didn't come to the table often

- What saved it

* The taste of the pizza and salad was awesome
* The dessert was insanely wonderful
* They were kind about returning the food - which I certainly hope they would be. 
Pizza taste and dessert saved it from a 2 star"}
{"text":"We ordered 2 kinds, the carnivore and ocean! Well the bread is awesome, perfect! No comments on that! The carnivore was good, it's a usual pizza with red sauce but the ocean is unbelievably delicious! The combination of garlic sauce and clam and shrimp, it's yummy!"}
{"text":"Very satisfied! My fianc√© didn't like his first beer and the waitress brought him some samples and a brand new beer. He didn't even ask! Love the smokey taste of the brick oven. Get the pesto! Also loved the background music."}
{"text":"Proper House Salad fresh and flavorful, Carnivore pizza with addition of some vegetables grilled perfectly, and choices of tap beer means there is something for everyone. Good service, comfortable atmosphere. Cheers"}
{"text":"Food is decent, but I think it's a little over-priced. Could use more variety/vegetarian options. But what they do have is pretty good. But when I'm downtown, there are better places I'd rather eat."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorites in the area and has been since we first tried it. The food all looks great (and so far everything anyone in our party has tried has been wonderful) and they have a great beer and cider selection as well as friendly service and a good atmosphere. Perfect for before a show."}
{"text":"While you're waiting for Elizabeth from the Roberto Clemente Museum to set up an appointment to see said museum (spoiler alert, she's not calling same day, and the e-mail isn't coming either), hop back in your Uber and come here (or after the Andy Warhol Museum, which is a pretty cool experience to itself).

The chicken caprese sandwich was perfectly seasoned, and the maple old fashioned complemented the bacon to perfection. Did I mention they have bacon candy? Mmmm...bacon candy.

So there it is. If you're a Penguins fan, congratulations on going back to back in the Stanley Cup finals!"}
{"text":"So, I went yesterday with the same group of people. Proper was packed! I believe we got one of the last tables in the place. Here's the breakdown of the update.

Service: 2.5/5. It took our server about ten minutes to acknowledge us. The hostess got us our drinks after we had been waiting for a while, which was nice of her. Our server spoke to us maybe three times the whole evening. I really felt like I was bothering her by asking her for things (apps came without plates, refills on drinks after they sat empty for a while.) She wasn't bad, but I've had better.

Food: 4/5. The Bacon Candy: It didn't taste anything like the first time. Instead of a savory mix between sweet, spicy, smoky, and salty...all I could taste was a bad mix of salt and spice. It didn't have the sweet, maple-like taste like the first time, but it was overwhelmingly salty and had a serious kick to it. It also tasted...underdone. Not sure of a better way to describe it. It didn't have a crisp bite to it, but it reminded me of bacon that needed to be cooked for a few minutes longer.

Proper House Chips and Dip: It was pretty good. It's an adult version of Lays and Lipton French Onion Dip and we enjoyed it. It was the perfect amount of chips v. dip as well. The only thing I would've done differently was salt the chips before they came out; the dip seemed like it was missing something, but a dash of salt brought it out. It was very good.

Funghi: Once again...fantastic. Can't say anything bad about it.

Bacon and Broccoli Pasta: It was good. It was spicy...I think someone had a thing for Pepper that night as everything tasted heavy on the Pepper. It wasn't a bad thing as it still tasted very good, but very heavy on the pepper.

Carbonara: It was awesome! Very tasty and very well done. Once again...heavy on the pepper, but still very tasty.

Dessert: They were okay: Cheesecake, Chocolate Cake, and the frozen custard. They were all good...nothing too standout, but it was still good and we were all happy.

Ambience: 2/5. It was extremely loud in the dining room. Since it's so small inside, it's not hard to see why it would sound loud, but I felt like I had to almost shout to my table mates. It didn't help that there was an obnoxiously loud, drunk guy at the bar and he stood right behind us the entire time we were there along with a large party. The other thing...it was very dark. I don't remember it being so dark inside the first time, but one of my tablemates had to use his flashlight on his cellphone to read the menu as his eyesight isn't the best.

Overall...it wasn't a bad trip, but I learned to steer clear of the place if it even looks busy. I will be going again as their Microbrew selection is awesome and the bartender makes incredible cocktails and one mediocre trip isn't enough to keep me from going back."}
{"text":"I love Pizza!  LOVE!  I am also a harsh critic of pizza, having grown up in New Jersey.  I would say the pizzas here are pretty good.  They use the brick oven, which gives a great smoke flavor and puts a nice crisp on the crust.  They do have some unusual combo of flavors on their pizzas.  I tried a Mediterranean pizza. Artichokes and olives and onions, oh yeah!  
The restaurant has a few different things to order, but if you get a pizza you wont need much else.  The pizzas are a good size.  
The wine list is is fine.  Nothing special on it.  The beers list is better.  You can get a sampler tray, which I love.  They bring you 5 different beers to try on the sampler and you can pick the ones you want to try."}
{"text":"This was the only place in PITT that we actually enjoyed our food at! The pizza was perfectly crispy and piled with upper scale toppings. Our appetizers came out quickly and the guy running the pizza section was friendly and helpful. If we are ever in PITT again we will be back!"}
{"text":"The Sausage Mac & Cheese is one of the most delicious things I have ever eaten!! It reminds me of my favorite mac & cheese from a little stall in London! So creamy. Very filling. Incredibly flavorful.

The BLT Salad with Proper's well-known bacon is also wonderful! I think I could eat it every single day if finances allowed.

As for pizza, I've only eaten the Bianca (white pizza) and it was also amazing! So much cheese. So filling. Really just very delicious!

I would recommend Proper to anyone looking for a delicious and filling meal!"}
{"text":"Stumbled into Proper because I felt like something simple and a good beer, and was pleasantly surprised (and have since been back).

Their beer selection is almost overwhelming...many, many unique brews, and the list is always changing.  Most beers I had never heard of, and the ones I tried were all very tasty (they have a nice selection of IPAs, as well as lighter beers with a tint of fruit).  I think my favorite IPA has been the Last Chance.

I haven't tried the pizzas (yet), but the Bacon Candy, chips with the homemade french onion dip, herb & onion focaccia, and the roasted peppers are all VERY good.  

Worth a visit.  The two times I was there, it was easy to get seated (once at a table with three of us, the next time at the bar).  Also a good spot to watch a game as they have a few large screen TVs."}
{"text":"The carnivores pizza was really good. Prices are reasonable and the service is great. The whole staff was very energetic and friendly. The pizza was great"}
{"text":"I have tried this place numerous times during lunch and surprisingly it's never too crowded. The food itself is pretty good and the environment is nice although it's pricey. Our waitress was friendly and attentive. Previously,  I had tried their pizzas, salads and even sandwiches. Today I got the Chicken Caprese sandwich with homemade chips. It was delicious! The chicken was grilled and tender with the crispy bacon. I also enjoyed the sauce and the fresh bun. Note that I'm picky about bread and this one didn't disappoint.  The only downside is that it was a bit too oily for me to the point where the oil dripped all over my hands and on my chips (perhaps it was olive oil). To top it off, we ordered bread pudding and shared it. The bread pudding was yummy!! It came out warm with blueberries and the white chocolate just made it melt in your mouth. 

It's was a bit weird having lunch with a group of people since pizzas have a different kitchen than sandwiches/salads so our food didn't come out all at once. Some people were eating while the others were staring of hunger. Sandwiches are priced at about $10 and pizzas at $16. Other than the food not coming out at the same time and being pricey, I think it's a good restaurant overall."}
{"text":"Got a little drunk here. Ate some pizza. Watched some fool get escorted out. It's a cozy little joint. Had a mozerella pizza and glasses of wine. I would come here again"}
{"text":"Best pizza hands down that I've ever had.  If you're going to a Pirates game just save yourself the money of buying hotdogs or nachos at the park and instead spend it here after the game.  You'll not regret this decision plus it's only a short distance across the river!"}
{"text":"Excellent gourmet pizza. The place is a bit loud, but the food is worth it.  They don't take reservations so come early."}
{"text":"We chose this restaurant because it had a pizza oven. That means crunchy thin crust right!!! Wrong. The flavor of the carnivore pizza was excellent. However, The crust was so soft the toppings wouldn't stay on. We had to use a fork and knife because it was too soft to pick up. I've never had such mushy crust from a pizza oven before. Very disappointed with the pizza. The apricot beer was delish though!!"}
{"text":"OMG! So good. First, the bacon candy is ridiculous. Then, their pancetta wrapped shrimp.. Amazing. The housemade chips and onion dip.. Delicious. That said.  Get the pizzas! They were perfection!!!!!"}
{"text":"It's a slow work day so why not review the place that i just had for lunch? :)

Bobby & i have probably had lunch at every place possible downtown. We wanted something different. He brought up \"the place near the eye ball park\" and i knew he meant Proper Brick Oven since we have been meaning to try it out. 

We had about 30 minutes of my lunch left and i wasn't sure if it would leave us enough time, but it worked out great. We ordered drinks and then ordered our meal as they were delivered. We went with the Pesto which is described on the menu as: 'oven-roasted Roma tomato, caramelized onion, basil pesto, house-cured bacon, house mozzarella, grated Pecorino-Romano & garlic oil'. Honestly, it was one of the best pizzas i have tasted. I'm not a \"pizza person\" & don't go searching for the city's #1, but i was very satisfied with this one. Every topping was very flavorful and tasty. Oh, another plus- the pizza came out in aboutt (or less than) than 10 minutes. Also, Bobby gave two thumbs up on his long island & the list of beer on tap was amazing!

Service was great as well as the ambiance. As tasty as the pizza was, i wish the toppings were spread out a little more evenly. Some slices were full of bacon while others didnt seem to have 2 pieces & other slices didnt seem to have any of those delicious tomatoes. Again this isn't a huge deal for how tasty the pizza was, it just would have just been better to experience the whole pizza on every slice."}
{"text":"This place was delicious. The pizzas, the fresh made pasta & the desserts were so good. The service was friendly & fast. I want to go back again & again."}
{"text":"Ambiance, great service and fresh home made pizza ingredients?! Yes please, I think I will! This place was a gem of a find and I thank my fellow yelp'ers for leading me here! What a treat in Downtown Pittsburgh while visiting my in-laws for Thanksgiving! 
The brick and industrial, soft lit atmosphere is exactly what my hubby and I were looking for to watch the Penguins hockey game!
I started with their specialty drink menu, some sort of awesome apple cider, followed by their pepperoni pignotta appetizer, a MUST have.
I know people rave about the candy bacon but we passed and ordered it on our pizza instead, delicious!! We also had a house salad and the white balsamic dressing was fantastic! We splurged and had dessert, it was the perfect ending to a wonderful dinner! We got the Oreo Peanut Butter brownie, perfect for sharing and a perfect way to end the night! I highly recommend and would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Flew in from Houston and was looking for a relaxing spot to have dinner in downtown PA. I don't think we could have done better than Proper Brick Oven.
It doesn't look like much from the outside and my only complaint would be that it is kind of a smaller place, but that is expected downtown.
My group of 4 guys split 2 pizzas and they were amazing. We had a \"meat lover's\" type pizza and another with garlic and other cheeses, both were awesome. We also split an app that was like a pizza roll with pepperoni and cheese inside. Small, but cheap and good.
They have a cool selection of beers and their Pittsburg (Moscow) Mule was very good.
I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner for my birthday, and I had the funghi pappardelle. It was incredible; I ate the entire thing. I also had the bread pudding for dessert and I liked it so much, I went back the next week for it again. Great food, great vibes."}
{"text":"Very cool place with great service from Scott. Candy bacon- yum! Proper house salad was very fresh and tasty. Loved the flight of beer option as a way to try out some of the local craft beers and ciders. The absolute best thing we had was the white chocolate bread pudding. Indescribably awesome!!"}
{"text":"As a new Yelper, I only like to give reviews for places that meet or exceed my expectations.  This place did that.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"I got the carnivore. It was delicious. And guess what? They put cheese on the entire thing unlike some places (*cough* stone pizza *cough* pizzaoli). We ordered and my food came out promptly. I'd say for brick oven the pizza came out a lot quicker than I expected. My waiter was super diligent in refilling my drink. I got three cokes in less than 45 mins! Usually I need to beg waiters to refill my glass. Pizza is overpriced at $16 for a pie, but hey. It's new it's hip its the thing to do! Great date place or business meeting. I wouldn't come here regularly but once in a blue moon I wouldn't mind one of their pizza pies!"}
{"text":"Excellent all around... Service was prompt and friendly, and the pizza was fantastic.  We split a bianca and margherita; both good.  The crust... wow.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"I recently ate at the Proper Brick Oven and Tap Room for the second time.  The location is perfect for getting something to eat or drink before or after going to the Benedum Center.  The menu has a lot of enticing selections, but both times I opted for the wood-fired pizzas.  Fancy pizzas equal fancy prices here, but although it can be pricey, I felt like I got a good value for my money.  The Carnivore Pizza was satisfying for my healthy appetite -- very meaty with a very good crust and sauce.  We also ordered the Potato chips appetizer.  The portion size was small but the taste was good and I especially liked the dip that came with the chips.  The atmosphere in this restaurant is relaxed but sophisticated.  The service was very attentive and genuine, and my only complaint is that our pizzas took a long time to come out, but they were slammed with pizza orders all at the time I was there.  I forgave them, and they actually comped our drinks which was nice.  I had a nice time at this restaurant and will hope to return."}
{"text":"Thursday evening my little fur buddy and l are wandering the arts district in Pittsburgh looking for dinner and beer and a bowl of water. As I am walking past Proper one of the staff is outside. After inquiring about being served outside with my dog he said he would have to ask the owner. Not only was she ok with it but she made certain the first guest served was  little buddy, a cold bowl of water appeared as if by magic. The food was wonderful, the staff exemplary, and the owner, Suzanne, wonderful. If you're a dog lover/owner you need to visit Suzanne at Proper."}
{"text":"Fantastic date night spot! The ambience around the grill and taps is great. Classy without being pretentious. 

We waited about 25 mins for a table on a Friday night. 

Tried their seasonal pumpkin pizza and mmm, it was perfectly woodfired. Expertly seasoned and the crust was nice and crispy like you'd expect from any woodfired pizza. Pretty extensive drink selection, too. Beers and cider on tap from local places and mainstream favorites. Wine and cocktails that were well made. 

Everyone from the hostess to bartenders to servers went out of their way to be friendly and accommodating. Can't wait to come back! Have heard the place is great for groups, too."}
{"text":"Twas a cold New Year's Eve when we stumbled into this gem of a restaurant. Lots of organic on the menu. The acorn squash soup was the perfect balance of sweet and savory.  Pizza menu will not disappoint.  Amazing beers on tap. If you have just woken up like I did at 4pm try the Mexican coffee porter! It's perfect!  The staff is so friendly and great too! Happy new year!"}
{"text":"Such freshness in their ingredients.  This is one of my nieces  (14 yrs old) favorite restaurants downtown Pittsburgh. Conveniently located in the cultural district on 7th and Penn. Parking is easy and across the street if no on street parking is available.  Also public transportation is right out on the corner as well on Penn and 7th or take the \"T\" to Wood St Station. 

Pizzas are fresh and creative. The sensational smell of a wood fired oven can be in your senses even 2 blocks away. 

Entrees are rich and hearty (seasonal)

Great salads and sandwiches 

HUGE beer tap menu with IPA's, Ales, Porters and seasonal beers. Full Bar also with a creative craft cocktail list. 

Outdoor seating is available but very small and limited area. 

Reservations are def recommended during shows and sporting events.

Cozy seating and good for a 1st date!"}
{"text":"I like the ambience of this restaurant, there's a little bar/cove area to the right side when you walk in so I was able to sit there and eat a good lunch.

The pizza here was really good! Freshly baked, thin yet doughy crust. I got their margherita and it was nice and flavorful. Their spinach salad was just OK, it comes with candied bacon but it didn't taste very fresh and tasted like regular bacon to me.

They made fresh pasta and their desserts seem decadent and delicious so that might be worth checking out next time!"}
{"text":"Everything about this place was amazing. Great drinks (definitely get the spiced mojito), awesome entrees, and delicious desserts (turtle cheesecake!). Maybe the ONLY criticism I could have is that the appetizer (pancetta wrapped shrimp) was a little small, especially for the price, but it tasted great. Overall, I'd go back again in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"I ordered margarita pizza with pesto drizzled over the pie. Cam out cold, tomato sauce wSs tomato paste, with pesto clumps. Absolutely dreadful and would not go back"}
{"text":"Ok so my boyfriend had to visit this place..lol he loooooves pizza and pastas so it was right up his alley. Lol.  This restaurant is in downtown Pittsburgh and the day we visited this place it was soooo cold and after parking we walked about 3 blocks to get there. Annnyway it's a lovely shindig. Very comfortable and relaxing atmosphere. It feels like you're walking into someone's home. :) Well we ordered the meat pizza and I had a drink called reindeer tracks in the snow. It was fabulous! Very posh. He sampled a few beers. We also enjoyed the candy bacon!!!  Sooooo yummy. The food was delicious the waitstaff was so friendly he kept talking to us about New Orleans (oh how we miss home). Overall nice place..yummy food."}
{"text":"the employees were friendly when i walked in. they were upfront and told us that the kitchen would only be open for 10 more minutes and they were open to quickly taking our order so that we can eat. this was appreciated but it was downhill from there. the food was mediocre. i ordered the brisket mac n cheese and it reminded me more of a soup because of the lack of macaroni and the cheese was almost liquid. the service throughout the meal was ok. the worst part was at the end when we received our check. the manager came over and asked how the meal was and we said it was ok. he responds with, \"i wish it was better than ok\" and walks away, doesn't even bother to ask what was wrong about the meal or how it could've improved."}
{"text":"I'm in love with this place! The food, atmosphere and service are always on point. 

The candy bacon is absolutely amazing and a must to start with and any pizza you choose will be delicious. The last time I went I had the autumn sangria and it was a delight!! 

While it is a small place it's warm and cozy inside. I like sitting at the bar in the front near the fire where they cook the pizzas. It's cool to watch them make the pizza and tossing it around. 

The service has always been great. Everyone's always been pleasant and cheery which really helps make your dining experience great. 

We've been here several times and have always enjoyed our meal."}
{"text":"This place was awesome. Had the Carnivore pizza and definitely didn't need to eat it all, but I definitely did. Craft beer list was on par with anything you'd see in a much larger city, and the atmosphere and the staff was fantastic. If I lived closer, this would be one of my go-to spots. Loved everything about it."}
{"text":"Proper is one of my favorite places in Pittsburgh. We go here most of the times that we are in the city, and it is fantastic every time. I usually have the Bibb lettuce house salad, which is delicious, but I decided to try the BLT salad with house made pork belly bacon today. It was incredible. I had the Margherita pizza - perfect sauce (fresh and just a tad sweet), fresh mozzarella and fresh basil on a lovely wood fired oven baked crust that has the right amount of chewiness and crispness. My favorite dishes are those that are so simple yet so delicious. This was all accompanied by a Pittsburgh Mule, made with local vodka, ginger beer and lime in a copper mug. Also, their playlist sounds like my own. Service was quite friendly, polite and attentive. I love this place and this meal."}
{"text":"I'd give it a 5, but I'd have to dine there again to rate it a 5, and I can never get a table.  No reservations....  The food is great, and the place is so cozy that you just want to stick around.  Go at a peak time and you are not getting in.  It would be a destination meal, not a place to go when you are on a time limit. The blood orange gin and tonic is a nice variation, bolognese pasta is a return to dish, and of course the bacon candy is to die for. Go at an off time and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Solid! Salad was tasty, fresh and perfectly dressed (if not mind blowing); pizza has a nice crust and good quality toppings, isn't too heavy/oily; wine list is decent but I was slightly underwhelmed by my Sangiovese. Able to snag two seats at the bar at 6:30 on Saturday. Good service although they took a long time to run the checks. Totally solid option and I'm happy with my meal."}
{"text":"amazing collection of beers and great ambience. Didnt try food except their margharita pizza which was ok."}
{"text":"I've eaten almost too much pizza in my life for it to be enjoyable... but places like this bring me back around. 

Atmosphere: very nice, well-designed interior. If you want, you can sit at the bar, watch the pizzas get made, and see them bake in the 800 degree oven! I was worried about it being hot, but it's really not at all. 

Service: our server was so lovely. She always had a smile and was ready to chat. Plus, she came back at very appropriate times to check on us. I feel like at least three different people asked how our food was, so they're clearly pretty attentive to any potential problems. 

Food: YES. AMAZING. Maybe I'm a little biased because I got to see my pizza baby go from dough ball to full-grown meal, but I thoroughly enjoyed what I got. Between the two of us, we had an order of bacon candy, a tacchino sandwich, a carnivore pizza, and a forest pizza. All were great. Try not to get addicted to the bacon candy. 

Can't wait to be back, and maybe we'll try some dessert next time too! :)"}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner here on our first night in Pittsburgh,at the end of June. We went based on the good Yelp reviews, and food-wise, we weren't disappointed. The pancetta-wrapped shrimp was amazing, though a small portion. The pizza was delicious, and the crust was just perfect. The drinks, however, were yucky. We got the melon sangria, and sent it back. My husband ordered another drink, the black pepper paloma, and he didn't like it either. The food, though, was excellent and well-priced, and we would definitely return."}
{"text":"Wife and I ate here on saturday night, 12/3/16. She had Brisket Mac n Cheese, which she absolutely loved. I had the Scallops de alio, which were good, but had too much garlic. I mean a LOT. Also much spicier than anticipated. Beer selection of 30 microbrews was awesome, service was excellent."}
{"text":"We are in town for the Fraternal Order of Police Convention. We are seated near the Brick Oven and order about 40 dollars worth of food and drink to start including a pizza. There's a black guy there making pizzas and very loudly says \"you've been slinging pizza all day for cops\" speaking to his co workers, They can kiss my ass, twice! We are both police officers and brought this to the attention of our waiter who felt really bad and got the chef and the manager . They apologized and offered to move us. But really? Do I want this racist hater making my food ? Unless he was fired on the spot, nothing's gonna make me stay there. Officers been eating there all day, giving there money to a place that would employ a guy like that . 


Thank you for your response. I admire your actions to correct the situation . I am the President of Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 85.  Police officers put our lives on the line every day to protect the lives of people we don't even know.  It is very disheartening when people take that for granted and feel that it is ok to make disparaging remarks to those of us who chose this noble profession . More often than not, remarks such as those that were made last night come from
Those who have chosen quite a different path in life, one that lands them on the wrong side of the law and rather then take responsibility for their actions they choose to blame the ones who caught them . Thank you for being a stand up organization . 

Sincerely ,

Nicole"}
{"text":"Amazing amazing amazing!  If you have ever traveled to Italy and you have had the real thing and nothing else has just cut it Italian food wise then look no further!  Absolutely delicious!  My fave place!"}
{"text":"This is a solid place to eat downtown.  The tap list is one of the better in the city and I give them major props for carrying a lot of Pittsburgh area small micro brew beers as well as many regionals mixed in with some national craft drafts.  No crap on tap here.  My fiancee and I started with the PEI mussels which were a bit over cooked but tasted very good with their beer/tomato broth.  We ordered the soppressata pizza, which was very nice.  The crust was a little overdone in some spots, but it's brick oven, so that is a bit expected.  Honestly, I'll take that over the soggy crappy crust so many Pittsburgh pizza places give you.  The toppings were flavorful and the sprinkling of Parmesan on top given by the wait staff set the pizza off well.   For dessert, we split the flourless chocolate cake with berry compote and fresh whipped cream.  It was very good as well.  My largest complaint here would be the drink prices.  Some of the beers offered were $8.50, which is too high, regardless of ABV.  There was not a draft beer on tap lower than $6.50.  If you go for dinner and drinks, you tab will add up quickly so keep that in mind.  You will enjoy dinner no matter how much you spend."}
{"text":"Really cool place to eat in the cultural district with a great ambiance. 

In my opinion, the drink prices are significantly more than they should be. 

Food wise, five stars for the taste. Three for portion size. We had the pepperoni snack, house salad and chicken caprese sandwich. All were delicious. 

Service was excellent once we got a server. 

I'll come back."}
{"text":"It's ok.  I came here based on rave reviews I heard from people.   I ordered the carnivore pizza, which turned out to be alright but nothing spectacular.   Not very much cheese or toppings compared to your typical american pizza (I understand proper is trying to be different here).  Again, not bad but nothing to write home about. For $16 bucks there are many other restaurants/meals in town I would prefer."}
{"text":"Visited last Friday with a group of ladies. Had a wonderful time. The wait staff was wonderful and attentive. Enjoyed seeing Snowbound Hard Cider on tap. Had the bacon candy app and the chips and dip. Chips and dip was better as the dip is amazing. Bacon candy I would prefer it crisper but that is just a personal preference. As a special they had a sweet potato bisque that was to die for. For the last week I have been scouring the Internet trying to find a recipe that might be half as good. If this place was closer I would go multiple times a day for this soup. 
Pizza and pasta was divine but please order the soup!"}
{"text":"Great place. It's small so make sure you have a reservation. The food is great, the proper pizzas are awesome. A personal sized pizza will cost you the same as a large from a chain, but oh so worth it. Good selection of craft beer in hand as well. Great stop on Penn Ave."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. The food and service was excellent. I'm only visiting Pittsburgh if I return I'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"I went to Proper with a few work friends for happy hour.  I was pleasantly surprised by the atmosphere by this place.  I like the decor - it felt casual yet classy.  As soon as you walk in you see the brick oven.  This was enough to make me order the pizza.

I ordered the margherita pizza but was underwhelmed by the flavor.  I think it was the sauce that was lackluster, but it was hot and fresh and had basil on it - I LUUUUV basil.  I still think Il Pizzaiolo makes the best thin crust pizza in this town and the secret is in their sauce so anywhere I go I always compare the pizza to Il Pizz.  

For drinks, I decided to go with a glass of the Greystone Cab (I think it was on a happy hour special) and then I got the Sage Suzanne which was refreshing and citrusy.  

I shared the flourless chocolate cake with another individual in our group and it was too much and too rich for us to finish.  I wouldn't necessarily call it a \"cake\" either as it tasted more like fudge paired with some cinnamon whipped cream and drizzled with some citrus sauce.  I probably wouldn't order this again, but it was decent.  

I'd definitely go back again to try some other items on their menu and their other drinks."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had in Pittsburgh ever. 

The crust was so good I actually finished all my pizza \"bones\" which is rare because plain dough is boring. But not here!

Their pre-selected pizzas are very very good. I would come back here in a heartbeat just for pizza. They also had a very good selection of drafts. Service was also very good. 

The wait was a bit long and the food took a little bit, but it was a busy night."}
{"text":"Meh. I've experienced better. This place runs like someone failing at the game diner dash, where people walk out if you ignore them for too long, or don't bring the bill fast enough. 

I would say this, if you're a tourist staying downtown Pittsburgh don't waste your time on this place.

Unless you're walking in for lunch, or a post dinner rush meal do not bother.

If you're looking for a quick bite or drink, don't bother.

If you value customer service...don't bother.

I tried to make a reservation but they don't make them for groups under 6....let me tell you there is maybe 1 table for six in the tiny restaurant.

We arrived at 615pm, we waited in the awkward foyer freezing for an hour. The hostess was pretty indifferent and annoyed with our presence.  The only reason we even stayed was that we were waiting for a friend to meet us there.

In the hour that we hovered in the 70s style foyer, we told everyone who walked in to leave because it wasn't worth it to go in.  Probably turned away about 10 people.

When we arrived there seemed to be a lot of groups of middle aged people who were wasted.  Like a lot, in fact as we left drunk moms were piling into a minivan and giving the waitress the finger. Super classy.  

So we sat down, ordered beers- the golden monkey was meh.  

Ordered the italian cheese plate, and pepperoni bread. 1 of the 3 cheeses was really good, one was meh, and one was covered completely in balsamic. Not great.

Ordered the Margherita  Pizza and the carnivore, both came and were very fresh. So yes the ingredients were very fresh, but it wasn't like something earth shattering.  Maybe I'm just a pizza guru, but it wasn't all that and a bag of chips for me.  Standard brick oven pizza.

We had the chocolate cake, which was very very dense and we couldn't finish it....and not in a good way.

I have to say that while dining we asked for Ranch dressing, and apparently the owner is completely against ranch dressing being at the establishment at all. So no ranch,  in case that's something you like on your pizza.  Also took a lot to get pepper flakes as well.

Over all, I was not impressed. I wish we had gone somewhere else because this place was really not worth the hype people talked about it or the time we spent there.  Pittsburgh has much better places to eat, try meat and potatoes if you can get a reservation."}
{"text":"Excellent place, you never think a pizza place could be this nice, it looks like a fancy restaurant but is a great place, great music, service and of course food."}
{"text":"IMO  this place doesn't get enough respect.  Have been here 3 times and every time food has been damn good.  Pastas are spectacular and the pizza is consistently hot and good.  When I go I am going for pasta or pizza but others have liked the salads too.  The beer selection is one of the best downtown and they can also mix a cocktail.  Love this place.  Every time I go I know I won't be disappointed.  And then there is the bacon candy."}
{"text":"My wife loves the salads and the white pizza is dynamite
!"}
{"text":"Nice place. Everything was great except the blunko pizza.  I think that's the name. It has just white cheese.  Beer sampling was a nice addition. You get 4 for ten dollars I believe."}
{"text":"An excellent addition to the neighborhood. If it is busy, don't let the small space scare you away from some truly excellent food!  The pizza is simple and beautiful.  THe \"bacon candy\" should not be missed."}
{"text":"Friends met here for lunch.  We got there around 11:45 to ensure seating without a wait.  We all got sandwiches and were pleased.  The chicken caprese was excellent.  Just be prepared to smell like smoke from the oven the rest of the day."}
{"text":"WOW!!!

If you love beer this is the place for you.  An incredible addition to the downtown Pittsburgh bar/nightlife scene.

Another example of why this is not your grandfathers...or fathers downtown.

They have 30 taps...all with QUALITY micro brews!  The most common beer they had was Bells 2 hearted or Victory Prima Pils.  Had 5 brewers that I had never heard of!

I have lived in NYC, Philly, Bmore, DC, Pittsburgh and sampled the beer scene in every major city in the US.

This place had the highest quality selection of American micro brews I have ever seen...EASY.

Waitstaff and bar tenders were personable and fast.

Pizza was good...not great...but got job done.  I did not sample any of the other food.

If you are in or near downtown Pittsburgh and like craft beer this place should be your first stop...and likely will end up being your only stop!"}
{"text":"Great pizza (Carinivore & Pig and Fig) and great beer selection. Also had the butternut squash soup which was very good. I somehow forgot to order the bacon candy. Cool atmosphere and great bartenders. Only downside was there were a lot of gnats living around the beer taps, but as far as I could tell I didn't eat or drink any of them."}
{"text":"I stopped by here last night for dinner with my wife.  We didn't really get to see much of the inside since it was a nice night and we wanted to sit outside.  The outside of the restaurant had a nice view of the city and while roped off from the rest of the sidewalk it didn't prevent a panhandler from asking us for money.

For our entrees my wife and I decided to split the fig and the pig pizza and also the carbonara pasta.  The pig part of the pizza was prosciutto and it contrasted nicely with the sweetness of the figs.  However there were some instances with the pizza where I just got the prosciutto without the fig and thought that those bites were a bit too salty for me.  The pizza crust itself was nice and crispy and also had a good garlic flavor when eaten without toppings.   Our entree was the carbonara pasta and whenever it was first brought out to us I thought that it looked like a small portion for the price.  However, the bowl was deceiving and there was much more pasta than it looked like.  The carbonara was made up of house-made tagliatelle with house-made black pepper bacon, a fresh egg and Parmigiano-Reggiano.  While I really ended up enjoying the taste of the pasta, most of that was due to the overpowering flavor of the pepper on the bacon.  I will say that the noodles themselves were pretty decent and I did really enjoy the creaminess of the sauce as well.  For dessert my wife and I decided to split their pumpkin cheesecake.  It was rich and decadent with a great pumpkin flavor that we both enjoyed.

The bottom line for me is that I will be back here again in the future.  All of the food that we had was good and I think that Proper is a nice addition to the downtown dining scene."}
{"text":"The food here is really good. I tweet with a group of 8 and got to try the margarita pizza, blue crab risotto and pesto pasta. All were great. The atmosphere is also really nice and they have some tvs on by the bar featuring sports games. There is only one bathroom but it is nice and clean. The location is good too since it's downtown near all the theaters and other bars if you want to bar hop after dinner. Worth a try and a return trip to have something new on the large menu. Service was also good. Overall very pleased."}
{"text":"Stopped in here during the busy Downtown holiday season and had a good lunch. The food was pretty good and the service was great. The pizza wasn't the best that I've had and I had expected it to be better than what it was."}
{"text":"Went for dinner on a Monday night.  I had the Pesto Pomadoro, and it was great.  The bacon candy was good too.  I only wish they had more outdoor seating.  It would have been a beautiful night to sit outside."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious pizza and excellent service. Casual atmosphere. Good drink selections. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! The food is seriously delicious. I love to dip my pizza in ranch but unfortunately they don't have ranch. The waiter (I can't remember his name but he was great)  suggested dipping the pizza and the duck wings in their French onion dip. OMG SO YUMMY. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I've been to Proper twice now and must say that I don't know if I'll ever go without ordering an appetizer of the candy bacon.  Really - candied bacon?  How can you NOT order it?  
This place gets a little busy and I don't think they take reservations.  I can tell you that you definitely won't get seated without your entire party present.  So get everyone together before you go inside!
This is a small restaurant that is on the cozy side.  There is a row of tables with an aisle and then the bar on the other side.  This creates an issue if you're on the outside of your table - wait staff and patrons are going to continue to walk behind you so you have to really pull your chair in.  I get easily annoyed and distracted by that, but I'm a high anxiety type of person so it might not bother other people.
I am a big fan of the bianca pizza.  It's fresh, has a great thin crust, and while light, it is filling.  
Nice wine list and some cool novelty type mixed drinks.  
This is a nice place for dinner before a show."}
{"text":"Before attending the CLO Cabaret show 39 Steps earlier this fall, I was searching for a downtown restaurant near the cabaret theater that wasn't too pricey but had really solid reviews. I had never heard any buzz about Proper Brick Oven in the past, but after seeing how many strong reviews the restaurant had listed on Yelp, I knew that I had to check it out.

The location is very convenient to all of the downtown theaters, and the interior was warm and cozy and intimate. The cherry on top was the brick oven aroma that greeted you at the door. Our waiter was friendly, and our cocktails were very well crafted. Finally, the pizza - love love love. A lot of trendy pizza spots have very thin, crispy crust pizzas topped with trendy ingredients. Though Proper Brick Oven does have plenty of trendy ingredients - such as pork belly bacon and arugula - I absolutely love that the crust is much softer and doughier than the often-seen crispy crusts.

Proper Brick Oven was a very nice dining experience and a place that I must remember to try again in the future."}
{"text":"Location- Convenience to downtown cultural district, across the street from Benedum. Street parking rare, garages and open lots take advantage of event rates for flat $15.

Drinks- Seasonal cocktail menu on-point. Bartender quick on refill. 32 micro and local brews on tap.

Food- Wood fired goodness. Rich melted cheeses, warm dough, tasty sauces for pizza. 

Ambience- Cozy fireplace feel. Tight seating but spacious bar. Exposed industrial ceiling. Casual and dim.

Experience- Good for quick meal before show. No reservations unless over a table of 6. Convenient and comfy. Good for a date."}
{"text":"Amazing food and cocktails. The pizza is sooooo good! Close to the baseball stadium also!"}
{"text":"There were so many positive things about Proper that I couldn't help but give it 5 stars. I went here with my boyfriend the other day and both of us were blown away by how good everything was. We started out with the bacon candy (because we have some semblance of sanity). It was sticky and sweet with a good level of spice. We then shared the carnivore pizza. The pie was cooked perfectly with a good amount of toppings and a delicious, garlicky crust. On top of it, I got to discover my new favorite beer, Green Flash Serrano Stout. Oh my! If you are familiar with how well chilies pair with chocolate, you know this is delicious. All around, the meal was perfect and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Candied bacon - what is not to love! Funghi pasta was fabulous but the scallop pasta surprised us with the really strong fishy flavor, not sure why because the scallops by themselves were not that strong. Great service, sat at the bar and was entertained watching the pizzas being made."}
{"text":"Just into Pittsburgh for a wedding this weekend and my wife found this restaurant on Google. Excellent service! Delicious food! I had the chop real special with the grits. Make ia a double chop and it would be perfect."}
{"text":"Great food and service. I'm out of town on travel and so far this has been the best food for the price."}
{"text":"Incredible pizza. The smell hits you like a ton of bricks. Great atmosphere. Had the carnivore with roasted garlic spread. Best pizza I've ever had. Friendly service. Laid back atmosphere. Perfect."}
{"text":"We went to Proper following a performance at Heinz Hall.  The last place we went to open after a concert was Grit & Grace, which had lead me to believe that the finest dining option open late by Heinz Hall was the 7-11.  Clearly I need to get out more, and I'm sure there many acceptable, and perhaps even excellent options (still need to make it to Meat & Potatoes), but I was relieved to have a good experience at Proper.

By 10 they'd switched to their late night menu, which is just pizza.  I was immediately impressed by the beer selection, which was not overwhelming, but a nicely curated collection.  I ordered the Green Flash, Serrano Chili Double Stout, which was surprisingly delicious.  The cocktails looked like they used quality ingredients, but all appeared to be on the sweet side.

We shared the Forest pizza, laden with mushrooms, fontina cheese, and balsamic drizzle.  The pizza was pretty floppy, in fact soggy from the center to a few inches up each slice. Fortunately, it was still delicious, and the crust was much closer to properly cooked: chewy and flavorful.

Otherwise, our service was fine, the atmosphere relaxed, and the clientele seemed to be mostly young to middle-age professionals.  I'd be happy to return, particularly to try the carnivore pizza, and check out the latest beer offerings."}
{"text":"So let me qualify this review by saying I'm kinda a pizza napoletana fanatic. I like really flavorful dough that has been prepared and proofed over time. I have my own wood fired pizza oven at home and take my pizza seriously. 

Some people may like this pizza, but I found it lacking of flavor and texture.....most of the shortcomings having to do with the dough. No real taste or structure. Not bad, but IMO not worth the money.

That being said, the people were nice and i did like the draft beer list. Maybe 20-30 beers on tap which I really did enjoy. I would go back to have a few beers but skip the pizza."}
{"text":"Good pizza, friendly waiter. Nice cozy atmosphere. We ordered the carnivore pizza for lunch shared between the two of us. We both said it wad the perfect amount of food for a lunch."}
{"text":"Service was friendly and attentive despite a very busy restaurant. The food was good. We had the Margherita pizza which was great. The beer selection is awesome. We finished the meal with two different desserts. The bread pudding was awesome but the donuts were pretty terrible. I'd be giving them five stars if we hadn't tried the donuts."}
{"text":"The Brisket Mac 'n Cheese was outstanding!! Jason did a great job explaining the available tap beers. The Panceetta wrapped shrimp was also very good..."}
{"text":"Great beer selection, great cocktails, & amazingly consistently good food. Their forest pizza is to die for."}
{"text":"After hearing about this place for quite sometime, we went to Proper for my friend's birthday. We did not have much of a wait in the evening after 7 and our group of four was seated quickly. I noticed that it was rather dim lighting which isn't a problem for me but I know some people do not like this at all. We started with the Hummus Trio which was delicious. The only problem was that we had to ask for additional pita because they give you so little. The waiter did not have a problem with this and surprisingly we were not charged extra. Two of us wanted a house salad and the waiter again come to the rescue telling us to just order the large house salad and he would bring two salad plates rather than each ordering a half. Less money and more food that way! I like this guy!  I also ordered a from scratch wood fired pesto pizza. Incredible!  This is not your typical pepperoni pizza place so keep that in mind. What you are getting is an authentic wood fired pie with fresh ingredients.  

I greatly enjoyed our experience here and while I may not always be in the mood for this type of pizza, I'm glad to have finally tried it. I'll be back to try a few other options as well. The service was top notch! My one caveat here was their beer selection. Pretty much just your standard drafts. While there were a few craft selections, I'd like to see more variety. There are a lot of local options that would do great here!"}
{"text":"Awesome newcomer to the theater district and close enough to the North Shore.  The pizza is terrific (think Naples brick oven... with American type toppings).  Bacon candy is absolutely fantastic!!  The owner seems to always be there and goes out of her way to ensure everyone is smiling!  Tap list is local and plentiful -- and I have always had tremendous service (fifth visit today)!  My favorite pregame location since Pittsburgh got a baseball team!!!"}
{"text":"We weren't overly impressed with Proper on our first visit shortly after they first opened, so we never went back. Fortunately, a work lunch took me back recently and the experience was much MUCH better this time around! It certainly left me wanting to return soon!

Atmosphere was never the issue. It's a comfortable, warm space. The large bar top eats up quite a bit of space, but it does serve a purpose when dining at the bar, as there's never an issue with finding room for the pizza dishes and your drink to coexist. The staff is nice, and service the last time around was much more attentive. The first time we went, we sat at the bar in a relatively-empty restaurant. Service was insanely slow, drinks weren't refilled, etc. On my latest visit with a group of 6, service was quick and drinks were topped off very regularly, so I'll mark that as either an overall improvement, or a sign that table service is stronger than bar service.

As far as the bar goes, Proper offers up a large draft selection and a bunch of mixed drink options which should please the majority of patrons. If beer is your thing, you'll definitely find something worthwhile. If you're looking for a mind-blowing mixed drink, you might not find it here, but you won't be disappointed, either. Besides...you're here for the pizza!

That's what will ultimately bring me back to Proper: the pizza. The margherita pizza is excellent. There wasn't a lot of cheese on the pie, but the highlight was definitely their sweeter sauce and crust. The crust on their pizza almost has the flavor of a pan pizza more than a brick oven-style pizza, but that's simply an observation, not a complaint. It's a bit thicker than some neapolitan pizzas, with a crispier outside and soft inside. Perhaps that, too, is what reminded me more of a pan pizza crust.  I also had the carnivore; Proper's pie for meat lovers. For me, it was the perfect amount of meat. Not too much, not too little. Just the right amount of spice from the sausage and saltiness from the bacon. It was good, despite meat-heavy pizzas being far from my favorite. The most interesting pizza I tried on our visit was the \"harvest.\" Talk about a blast of Fall for your palette. Butternut squash, pumpkin sauce, crispy sage, sweet italian sausage, fresh mozz, and nutmeg. Yes, it tastes as strangely delicious as it sounds, and while the make-everything-imaginable-taste-like-pumpkin craze seems out-of-hand these days, the harvest pizza is worth checking out while you can get it.

Ultimately, the improved service and delicious margherita will bring me back, and as someone who works downtown, it's nice to have another lunch or dinner option to be excited about! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We are obsessed with this place! Excellent draft list - I was so excited to see a Four Seasons brew from my hometown of Latrobe! The Pizza Bianca is addicting - white pizza with dallops of ricotta are super delicious. We split that and a pesto pasta for dinner, which was also excellent. One of our favorite places to go downtown - we always know we'll get good food and good service there."}
{"text":"Bacon bacon bacon bacon. Beer beer beer beer   Pizza pizza pizza.  Yum yum yum.  Excellent service setup and dining experience.  I would have to say that it's an easy menu and great selection.  So if like beer, good pizza, and bacon then you are good here.  Nice selection of salads and apps as well.  You'll love it."}
{"text":"Loved this place! I've waned to come here since moving to Pittsburgh. The reviews really justify the experience. The beer selection is good- not excellent (have to head to Fathead's to get A+ beer selection) but the food is really great. 

Have to get a wood-fired pizza. Totally excellent. I also really recommend the candy bacon appetizer. Holy god. 

I'd go back here in a heart beat."}
{"text":"Great 10\" pies and an ever changing tap list. So glad we stopped. As much as I love a Neapolitan style thin crust, every now and again, you need a nice chewy crust. They nail it here! The red sauce is great and the toppings are top shelf. Easily some of the best sausage on a pie I've ever had! Boston's Pizzeria Regina should take note, the sausage is better here! 
Waitstaff was friendly and attentive. Atmosphere was perfect....I have no negatives. 
If you show up at lunchtime ask for Todd."}
{"text":"Great place right in the middle of the cultural district. Brick oven pizza is some best tasting pizza that I've ever had. Made fresh and lots of different combinations to choose from. They are very PA focused, great local micro brews, wines and PA based mixed drinks. Smaller place but usually you can get a seat. The Autumn Sangria is my favorite!"}
{"text":"We came here for brunch and our whole party enjoyed their food. I was worried we'd have a long wait considering the place isn't very large, but we had no trouble. Very good service."}
{"text":"Mehhhh
It was okay. It was around a 10 minute wait and some expensive pizza. 
I got the Pesto and my friend ordered the Carnivore and both were good...But they weren't $20 good. 

The service that we got was probably the worst part, I could have justified spending that much if we had been treated better. The waiter never came to fill our waters, we had to flag someone down after we couldn't stand it any longer. That was forgivable, maybe the place was busy, maybe they didn't see us. Then the kicker, it took them almost 45 minutes to pay and leave. It was like our waiter didn't want to get paid that day. After 20 minutes we just wanted to leave and tried to flag him down but didn't even see him. 

Also they don't have fries. They only had chips and it wasn't a code for fries."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza and salad with great beer selection and awesome staff. Justin, Kevin and Nick really are awesome pizza and good quality at a good price is what they have here. I highly recommend coming in. I can tell everything is made from scratch."}
{"text":"Been here three times. The first two times I dined in and had the carnivore pizza, which is very good. The second time I also tried their chorizo soup, which was good but on the verge of salty and the small piece of bread that came with it was stale and felt like an afterthought. On my third visit, I got their chicken vegetable soup and snapper as take out. I was disappointed to find that the soup was tiny (served in an 8 oz deli), especially for $7. Again, the associated bread was not great. The snapper was good, but some of the vegetables it came with were overly charred.

I wanted to give 4 stars, but I really felt they skimped on the soup and bread. Not sure I would come back for the pizza alone."}
{"text":"I have eaten here multiple times and this may be one of my new favorite restaurants in downtown Pittsburgh! The first time we sat at the pizza bar which is a Great place to sit and watch your pizza being made in the wood fire oven! A show must have let out shortly after we arrived because there was a rush of people at the door suddenly and they were telling people it'd be a 45 minute wait! We split the carnivore pizza which was absolutely delicious! Bacon, pepperoni, and sausage- the dough was delicious as well!They have a great craft beer selection, the wine prices seemed to high to me, but everything else seemed priced appropriately. I'd also recommend the Bianca pizza or the Forrest if you are looking for a veggie pizza. I've also eaten here for lunch, which was not as satisfying so the \"star ratings\" are really based on my dinner experiences. I ordered the chicken caprese puccia(balsamic-marinated chicken breast / house-cured black pepper bacon / oven-roasted Roma tomato / house-made basil pesto / house mozzarella) The bread completely overwhelmed the sandwich and when I opened it up to see how big the piece of chicken was it was literally half the size of my palm! I'm a very small person so obviously if it's half the size of my palm I don't even think this constitutes as acceptable on a sandwich. The flavors were good but it was disappointing because of the proportion of bread to meat. I will say,however, that the homemade chips were AMAZING and probably honestly the best I have ever had-and I am NOT a chip person at all! My boyfriend had the soup special (chilled pepper with scallops) and the special for lunch (pork and spaetzle with pancetta). he too commented on the size of his entree which looked more like an appetizer but it was tasty. The soup (besides the chips which again were amazing but that's not a reason to return anywhere) was I think the highlight for both of us. I'll still return but I think for dinner instead of lunch"}
{"text":"I visited on a Sunday evening during a Steeler game, the place was semi full but in no way packed. I will start by saying this place would receive 5 stars if it was solely based on service alone. Our server, Allen (if I recall correctly), was helpful in explaining items on the menu and really made us feel welcome. 

I was in a party of five (lol) there celebrating a birthday, it was the first trip to Proper for all of us. We started with the house chips and French dip. They made for a great start to a meal unfortunately the rest of the meal didn't live up the appetizer. 

I ordered the Margherita pizza, others ordered the pesto pasta and pesto pizza. I wasn't too pleased with the pizza. Honestly for $15 I expected something more filling and satisfying. The pizza itself was burnt, now I know it's brick oven pizza but it lacked flavor. The middle of the pizza itself was very soggy and once it cooled it tasted half cooked. Not sure if the oven was up too high or too many pizzas were placed in the oven causing it to be cooked unequally. 

A friend who ordered the pesto pasta wasn't happy with her meal either, it was too oily and not what she expected. Those who got the pesto pizza however were very happy with their choice. 

The bathroom was a mess with toilet paper and paper towels covering the floor. I bet this was the cause of Steeler fans eating prior to the game but we didn't arrive until after half time so that's more than enough time to clean up. 

Between the less than stellar food and messy bathroom this place gets three starts from me. I would consider coming back on the service alone but will definitely order something besides the pizza."}
{"text":"Stopped in with my boyfriend for an early dinner tonight. The first thing we noticed was the amazing brick oven smell! The pizza actually is baked in a brick oven!

Casual but classy! Comfortable, dim-lit atmosphere with cozy seating.

There was a decent selection of wine. Something for everyone.

Our server, Kali, was on top of her game. She was able to recommend food items and tell me how she felt about various wines. She was excellent about timely and accurate service, and very personable!

My boyfriend got the \"Forest\" pizza, a mushroom specialty with fontina cheese. He ate the entire pie!

I got the Margherita pizza, and I loved it. It was a bit saucier than what I'm used to, but a welcome change. Kali provided us with fresh black and red pepper, and fresh grated parmesan cheese. 

Next time, I plan to try the pesto pizza.

I would definitely return to this lovely restaurant!"}
{"text":"This is our go to spot after a Pirate game or any time we are in the area after an event downtown. The rotating beer list is great with a lot of local breweries! The atmosphere is great as it is not very big and we love sitting at the bar. The pizzas are good but a little expensive for what you get."}
{"text":"Great restaurant!  The shrimp appetizer was small but great--the shrimp, spinach, and added seasonings came together really well. The pasta is hand made and very good, but get the pizzas that they are better known for. The carnivore pizza was great. The cookie dough was novel but not amazing. Overall would definitely recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"If you want amazing pizza, a large craft beer selection, and/or an amazingly friendly staff.. This is the place to be!! I'll be back here for sure. Just make sure not to go over your paid parking.. You will get a ticket.."}
{"text":"I intended to order a pizza but then saw Massachusetts scallops on the menu and had to try them.  They were tender and cooked perfectly.  The bisque as a starter was delicious.  The service was attentive without being stuffy."}
{"text":"We stopped in after a concert down the street. It's hard to find something that is still serving food at 11PM but they were so we gave them a try. They only serve pizza at that hour but it was delicious. It's a little on the high end side but not stuffy (we were in concert tees and jeans and didn't feel out of place) and for as fancy as the pizza is it's not overly pricey.

We got the Pittsburgh pizza with potato and onions on it and could not have been happier. My wife got a Moscow Mule and said it was perfect.

The staff was attentive and very nice. I'd gladly come back."}
{"text":"So glad I decided to eat here-you cannot go wrong with these pizzas. I had the forest pizza, which has mushrooms, fontina, caramelized onions, and balsamic reduction all baked together, and I don't regret eating the whole pizza by myself.  The crust itself was so good I even ate that, and I habitually only eat to the edge of the toppings and then move on to the next slice!

Friendly service, great ambience, delicious menu options and strong cocktails...the beer list had lots of local selections and a good variety for any palate. I recommended it to anyone who would listen!"}
{"text":"Small place but the atmosphere was great and the pizza was even better. Our waitress was very attentive!"}
{"text":"The beer selection is great and the food was tasty, but definitely over priced. The entree salads left a few in my party still hungry and they ended up ordering appetizers after their meal. Kind of a strange dining experience. I'd go back for drinks, but probably not for dinner."}
{"text":"This is a nice little place. It is kind of tight  when busy but it cleared out some while we were there. It is pretty noisy when crowded. 
We had a wings appetizer. They were very good and hot out of the kitchen. We shared a carnivore pizza and a shrimp pasta dish. Both were quite good.

We also had a few beer samples before making a decision. 

The waitress did a very good job. The beer and food came out quickly. She was also knowledgeable on the beer. 

It was a little on the expensive side but overall a nice dinner. 

Definitely give it a try of you have the chance."}
{"text":"Holy Moly this place is delicious. I would have posted pictures but we devoured our food. I'll just say this..:We are a group of ten, we all ordered something different; it was so amazing that we kept trading food. The Crab Spaghetti is a must! Also,the Pittsburgh Mule is a fine drink! Enjoy my friends, thank me later!"}
{"text":"Went on a whim after a Pens game. We were told it would be a 45 minute wait...but we saw seats at the bar..so it was doable. First they have an extensive drink menu. I opted for an Arsenal cider and my husband had an amazing Mojito. Our friends raved over their Manhattans. We ordered some mussels to share and they were very good...not the best....but very fresh and the broth was tasty. They actually seated us in about 25 minutes. I asked the waitress for suggestions and she recommended the Ocean pizza....it was an outstanding seafood style pizza...white style with a very tender crust. The pizzas a bit large for a personal....but with a salad I would split one. My husband had the carnivore....he loved it, especially the plentiful toppings. My one friend has shrimp wrapped in prosciutto with a grilled root salad...she said it was delicious. Her husband asked them if they could whip up spaghetti with meatballs in a red sauce....and they did!!! In his defense, we were contemplating an Italian restaurant before going here. All in all....would come back. Cozy atmosphere, good service, above average pizza and decent prices."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza and homemade pastas! (Their Pesto pasta is incredible) great selection of beer and great service! Will be back soon :)"}
{"text":"We had 5 of us for dinner right during the heart of happy hour.  The only complaint was that it was loud and we were seated at a high-top table.  Other than that the service was very attentive and accommodating and the food was delicious.  We would definitely come just for the food alone and, while the environment was fun, I would come a little later next time to avoid the happy hour crowd.  Highlights on the food were the candied bacon, the pizzas are all great (no soggy middle of the pie), the flourless chocolate cake was fantastic, and the salad with grilled chicken was perfect."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! The pizza is amazing- it walks a fine line between fancy but not too fancy- and is delicious. My other favorite is the beet salad- one of the best I've ever had. There is a great ambiance inside and it is nice to see the chefs making the pizza to the side.

Only note is that the pizza feels a little pricey... totally worth it flavorwise... but I still prefer to pay a little less for pizza."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore this restaurant. I've made it my regular handout (same table, same drink, same food) each time I go (so sue me i'm a creature of habit haha). One of their servers, Todd, is so friendly and nice. He knows he can take his time with me; and that I'll order everything at once after I've barely glanced at the menu.

Overall, for lunch, the cost is reasonable for downtown Pittsburgh. No more than $30 for my two drinks, & pizza. The carnivore pizza is fantastic; I can't imagine ordering anything else!

Be aware- seating is quite crowded and they don't take reservations unless you're a large group. It can get noisy because of this but frankly, with food this good, if you care about that at all this isn't the place for you!"}
{"text":"I burned my mouth here and don't even care. It's that good.

The pizza is top notch.  We went on a Saturday afternoon and was not disappointed.  Everything was great. 

We had two pizzas and both were excellent.  I had one that was primarily meat.  Drinks were a little steep if I remember."}
{"text":"Proper Brick Oven is, to say the least PROPER. Their food, no matter what I've ordered, has been top-notch. There are tons of great restaurants in Downtown Pittsburgh -- dining out here is second to none (yes, really). Proper, however, is the place I go to feel at home. It's comfortable, inviting, and its staff go out of their way to make things just right. 

I'm new to the Cultural District, but Kevin, Dan, and the team at Proper make a casual dinner feel truly special."}
{"text":"Great place downtown to get some delicious pizza from the wood fire oven! They have other entrees as well but I most definitely recommend pizza. I have been here twice now and will definitely be back. Prosciutto wrapped shrimp starter is awesome and the Pig and Fig pizza is delish! The spiced Mojito is good but tastes like a regular Mojito and I didn't taste the \"spice.\" The atmosphere is intimate with dim lighting but the volume level is normal. Many beers to try as well as wines and some specialty mixed drinks. Service is quick and has been friendly. Can't wait to come back here!"}
{"text":"Thanks Yelpers for the recommendation. Great chef. Great food. Must try Restaurante. 
Be patient. Your meal is not institutional. It's prepared for you."}
{"text":"Not great.  Poor bar selection and I heard staff \"praying\" they would not get busy...  sounds like they don't want customers..."}
{"text":"After searching most of downtown for a good restaurant and coming up empty handed, I'm so glad we found this place! The relaxed, elegant atmosphere proved that you can elevate casual eats without getting snobby and overpriced. The entire staff was friendly and welcoming, which is always a huge plus. We were seated immediately and our food came out quickly. 

For a healthy appetizer, try the roasted sprouts with cranberry and bacon bits - they were delicious and flavorful without being overdone, and you get a huge portion. The fish and chips are fried in duck fat, which gave them a perfect crispiness without excess grease; the tartar sauce was perfect. The flavor will a little more savoy/smoky than the typical typical fish and chips, but it still tasted great. The margarita pizza was cooked well, but it could have used a tiny bit less oil and more seasoning (especially salt). Overall, it was an excellent dining experience."}
{"text":"Nice beer selection on tap instead of just a bunch of different IPAs which seems to be the trend at too many beer places these days. I had the carnivore pie and the house made sausage on it is fantastic but it may have had a little too much on it (if that's possible) as it made the crust, which is delicious, a bit soggy for my tastes. Friendly staff and fast service sitting at the bar. If you like brick oven pizza definitely give it a try."}
{"text":"Solid pizza joint off The Strip!  Like all the places that I visited during my trip, the server was friendly and unpretentious.  :)

I had the Forest (w/ caramelized onions, $17) pizza that I shared and we still had leftovers after that.  Thin-ish crust.

What really stood out was the Spicy Mojito ($11) made with local rum from Maggie's Farm distillery.  Had a really distinctive, bold flavour and was a PROPER drink, not watered down.

Wouldn't hesitate to visit again!"}
{"text":"Great food, $5 house wine for happy hour (ends at 6PM which is a little lame), and great service and atmosphere. Will definitely come back for more. 

I only ordered the pizza and it was very good. Heavy toppings and unique combinations. Plus, the bacon candy appetizer is like crack.... I'll be ordering that every time I go!"}
{"text":"This is the BEST pizza I've had in a long time.  And I love pizza.

It was our first trip to Pittsburgh and our Uber driver recommended Proper Brick Oven as a place to go.  It was very close to our hotel and on the way to the ballpark, so we stopped in for dinner before the game.  We ordered the Margherita pizza and the Proper House salad. It was perfect to share between the two of us and we loved it so much we went back the next day and the next!  We tried other Pittsburgh 'musts' like Primanti Brothers and Pamela's Diner, but this was our vote for best restaurant in Pittsburgh!!"}
{"text":"What a great spot! Don't be fooled by a the nondescript exterior, this place is a gem. Extensive draft beer menu. Start with an order of Pepperoni Pagnotta (honestly you could make a meal of these!!) I suggest the Margarita pizza. They will add pepperoni if you want meat. Finish with the Flourless Chocolate Cake! You will need to share that with a friend. Great food and exceptional service!"}
{"text":"Our First time dining here. Friday night, 7:30 they were busy so we chose to sit outside, it was a great evening. The host sat us with menus and place settings, the waitstaff was a little slow in recognizing us. When they realized their error, they made up for it ten fold. We couldn't have asked for a better server than Kyle and he was extremely apologetic and quite attentive. Drinks from the bar were excellent. We had the seafood crustini appetizer paired with the house salad. The food was excellent well prepared and filling. Portion sizes were perfect. The Elizabeth chocolate cake was to die for.(and gluten free) Jake, I believe is a manager came out to to introduce himself and to recognize their mistake in the earlier evening. I will definitely return... Often. If you haven't been here, go! The staff is great, friendly and the food was excellent."}
{"text":"This was our first time trying Proper. We had heard great things about it as well as reading great reviews. When you walk in it is low lit and cozy. The oven adds to the ambience. Though there weren't many customers the hostess seemed to question where to seat us. She ended up cleaning off a small table for us. Our waitress was nice but talked so fast that I had to ask her to repeat herself twice. 
I ordered the Tacchino with a side if house made chips. It was a good choice. It has smoked turkey and bacon candy on it. Each bit was savory with a tiny touch of sweetness. The chips were thin and crispy. 
My husband ordered the Chicken Caprese. It was also very good. He chose pickled vegetables as his side. They are served cold and are spicy. He loved them. 
One of the things that was annoying was a couple brought their toddler and a baby in with them. Now, I like kids, but my theory is that you shouldn't bring young children into places that don't have children's menu. The toddler was loud and all over the place. It was very disruptive to the quiet and cozy atmosphere. 
We will definitely be back to try the pizza and beer."}
{"text":"There needs to be a higher star rating for this place. We had a wonderful server, a great seat and the food was out of this world. I'm a HUGE brick oven pizza judge and this one tops everything I've ever tried. If I could explain how amazing everything was I would. However, you're just going to have to go and try it for yourself. YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Very good pizza, only complaint was mine was a little burned around the edges.  I had the carnivore, very good flavor but not heavy on meat like other meat pizzas.   The service was good, quick and friendly.  The only two things keeping this from being  five stars are the price ($18 for a personal sized pizza) and the fact that my pizza was burnt around the edges which made the crust undesirable.   


Yummy."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of any kind of pizza. There was a lot of hype about this place when it first opened but I don't think that it is any different from other upscale pizza places in Pittsburgh. Our food was good and our waitress was really helpful and accommodating to our large party of 10 people. Be careful because the floor is a little bit slippery!"}
{"text":"Proper is our go-to \"we're downtown and don't have a reservation\" spot. Easy, fun, delicious, crowd pleasing.

I cannot skip the housemade chips every time. Don't even plan on sharing these; the little cone they pretend is for the table won't be enough for you--they're that good.  I'm a traditionalist and keep with a fire oven toasty pizza each time, usually the bianca (hello, ricotta & roasted pepper!).  If I can fit in a salad, it's always worth it. Butter lettuce!They are beyond for salads. +1 has to get the lamb sliders. As a non-lamb eater myself I'll have to take his word on the juicy little guys that he can't get enough of. It's a shame we're so set in the incredible items we've found because the menu is extensive! Pasta, pizza, meats, salads, bizarre seasonal items like cold cucumber soup and I don't even know what else.
The cocktail list is great too which holds this place in very high standings with me. Drinks I've never seen before, a great wine list, and while I'm not a beer kind of gal, they have tons of taps.

I love to sit on the lower front sections, although it can get a little loud by the bar and pizza oven, there are a few TV's, and even a high top overlooking said oven (great in December, coming in from subzero downtown!). I remember when this was Tambellini's. Old school Pittsburgh family Italian after a show at the Benedum has been updated perfectly to a light, cozy spot to grab something after an impromptu trip to the (relatively newly revamped) tiny cultural district."}
{"text":"Our favorite go to spot. Our favorite bartenders in all of downtown Pittsburgh and the food never disappoints. Sit at the bar for excellent service every time! Love Proper! Thanks For being awesome Michelle and Dan!"}
{"text":"Any place that has a dry Arsenal Cider on tap has automatically gained at least 4 stars in my mind. Love that they serve Bone Dry Cider to satisfy my picky cider palate. Hooray! 

I've been here a few times and I have to say that it's one of my favorite cultural district spots. The pizzas are delicious and can be served up quickly. My favorite so far is the Black and Gold. I also really enjoy the Free Birds appetizer that comes with two grilled chicken sliders, three full sized chicken wings, and this delicious blackberry bbq sauce that is sweet and spicy and I always just end up eating it with a spoon like a real classy lady. 

My only complaint is the lay-out. The bar takes up a lot of the space and there's only a tiny walkway to get to the back of the restaurant. I hate sitting at the tables that line that tiny little walkway because you end up getting bumped all night. 

If you plan on visiting on a night when there is a show at the Benedum, allow yourself lots of time. Service is quick once you're seated, but expect a wait to get a table. They only take reservations for parties of 6 or more."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. The Margarita Pizza was good, although the pizza sauce was a bit to salty. We sat at the bar right by the pizza ovens... the pizza cooks were very friendly and fun to watch."}
{"text":"This place an awesome variety. It has great pizza, brunch, and even entrees. I have been there a couple different times and each time we are well taken care of. The food is not perfect budget, but you pay for the quality."}
{"text":"We went here on a friday night.  We saw the good reviews online so we wanted to check it out.  The food was excellent and we will definitely return.
The beer choices were great.  (Many local microbrews on tap) We ordered the finnochio pizza.  It was fantastic.  Thin and crispy crust with goat cheese, sausage, banana peppers and fig.  
The food came out super quick which was also a plus.  
The food and drink menu is five star worthy.  However, the reseraunt is pretty small and narrow.  We felt pretty crammed.  Only one person can walk down the aisle at a time.  With the waiters and the packed crowd, it can be pretty claustrophobic. .."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my Proper Salad and Bacon Candy - you have to try this! - out in the small patio area. It was a perfect place to eat and people watch."}
{"text":"Stopped by on a busy Saturday night to grab a bite to eat. Started off my ordering the hummus board appetizer which was delicious. The bread was very naan-like, brushed with olive oil and seasoning that made me want to order another board (held off on that though). We ordered a Bianca pizza (simple blend of cheeses, including ricotta, on olive oil) as well as the pacific pizza (shrimp and clam toppings). Both were great but if I had to order again, I would keep it simple with the Bianca pizza. Quality pizza shop. Muy bien. It only took about 30 minutes to be seated."}
{"text":"We found this place via Yelp and was very pleased. The brick oven pizza was excellent and do I really have to recommend the bacon candy? Server was super friendly and helped us navigate which pizza to order."}
{"text":"We were in town for the weekend and used Yelp to find a good spot for lunch.  Did NOT disappoint.  The service is super fast and the food is great.  Potato chips were delish and the AUTHENTIC fire-oven Margherita Pizza was spot on!  Would definitely recommend when in town!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch, the atmosphere and service was excellent! The good was good as well! My friend got the pesto pizza, delicious! And I had the chicken caprese, which was decent. The French onion dip was good, they do not serve ranch. I will be sure to be back!"}
{"text":"Solid pizza and good wings!   The pizza had a tasty and chewy crust although the pepperoni was scarce.  The Margherita pizza was equally tasty.  We also had the wings which were messy and delicious.  The Amalfi Salad was fresh and tasted great.  The staff was very nice too.  When my husband had low blood sugar the host  ran to get him a roll and a Pepsi. It was very kind of him to do that!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and a solid craft beer selection! Was a little disappointed in not arriving a few minutes earlier and having the opportunity to order from the regular menu. Glad we decided to stay though, the wood fired pizza was worth it!"}
{"text":"It was my first time here and it was pretty good. I got one of their specials, which was a turkey risotto. The composition of the plate was really pretty and the flavor combination (it was a crispy turkey breast with risotto and a horseradish cranberry relish) was very good-- it was like fancy thanksgiving! 

Service was good. I sat at the bar and the bartender was nice and food came fast. Only complaint is the risotto was a bit salty, but if you eat all the bits at once, it wasn't a major issue and I ate it all up :)

Restaurant itself is really nice and cozy. Not too much room to sit in the bar stools along the longest edge of the bar because the walking space is small between that and the tables. Liked the atmosphere though."}
{"text":"This place is located right down in the Cultural District making it a great place to go before a show (which is exactly what we did).   All of our dinners were spectacular.  The service---well were do I begin---AMAZING!!  I have special dietary needs and asked about the flourless chocolate cake ingredients--the waitress wasn't sure what all was in it so she brought over the manager who tried to help out as well.  Not quite sure if I could have the item, I politely passed.  Seconds later, the manager came over informing me that she contacted the pastry chef at home and got a list of ingredients for me...wow talk about going the extra mile!"}
{"text":"This is our second time visiting here when we have visited Pittsburgh. The candied bacon is my husband's favorite and he highly recommends it. The pizzas are outstanding - a tangy tomato sauce, crust that has a nice brick oven char and excellent flavor, fresh mozzarella, & lots of great toppings. Best to have a reservation for dinner, but we had no wait for a late lunch."}
{"text":"This tap room is a nice addition to the Pittsburgh craft beer scene. They have about thirty beers on tap - most of which (if not all) are craft. The bartenders are knowledgeable and offer great recommendations based on your tastes.

I will definitely return for the beer and intend on trying some brick oven pizza from here."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough about this place. My SO and I traveled to Pittsburgh for a long weekend to take in a Pirates game and explore the city. After a bit of drinking on Saturday night, we woke up rather late on Sunday and wanted to grab a bite to eat. We walked the streets, looking at menus in windows, but nothing really sang to us. 

We happened to stumble upon Proper and nearly walked past it. Looking at it from the outside, to be honest wasn't too inviting. But, we decided to check out the menu just in case. We opened the door and were immediately greeted by a very friendly man who handed us a menu. I took a look around the cozy restaurant and smelled with brick oven going...glanced at the beer list on the wall and was sold. 

The gentleman who greeted us introduced himself as Todd and told us he would be our server. I was a bit overwhelmed with the beer list and Todd gave me his recommendations based on my preferences. He also let me sample three beers, all of which I loved! 

I ordered the frittata, which had caramelized onions, roasted tomatoes and was topped with arugula that was tossed in olive oil and sea salt.  BEST. FRITTATA. EVER. It was light and fluffy and the peppery arugula accented it perfectly! 

My SO ordered \"proper eggs\" which essentially reads two eggs. I remarked how boring of an order it was, BUT, when it came out it had two pieces of toasted brioche (which I stole and consumed rapidly) and a fresh fruit salad. The brioche was up there with the best I have had, I even inquired if it was made there, hoping to be told it was not, so I could purchase some to take home! But, the bread is made in house daily. Man was it good. I'm drooling as I type this review three days later!

As funny as it sounds, I know it was just a late breakfast, but it was my absolute favorite meal while in the Burgh. 

Kudos to you Proper for having such a pleasantly staffed restaurant, a cozy atmosphere and an amazing beer list. Todd was just awesome and I hope that when I come back, he's working!"}
{"text":"I'd say it's really a 3.5er but I'll give the round up because they so awesomely sheltered us from the green storm. Cool vibe; dark and quiet which was a very welcome respite from the throngs of St. Patty's Day party people loudly stumbling about the city in their green shirts, beads, hats, tutus, socks, sunglasses, face paint, unicycles, etc. Bar was very clean and extremely well organized and the stools were super comfortable after a day of sightseeing.

Lots of beers of numerous styles on tap, mostly local. My triple IPA (Helltown Brewing's \"Idle Hands\") was delicious as was my cocktail, a black pepper Paloma, both of which I highly recommend. Bartender offered recommendations and was more-or-less attentive. Bianca pizza ($15 for the only size; shareable as a snack/individual as a dinner) sat for awhile as I stared longingly knowing it was ours and it was getting colder by the second :( When we did finally receive it, it had good flavor but way too much ricotta for my liking and only my first slice was hot because it sat for so long. Crust was good at the top but more soggy than desirable underneath the toppings. Ultimately, I could've done without the pizza. 

I'd absolutely recommend this place for date night drinks at the bar and some intimate conversation or just a relaxed place to sit and drink a tasty beer, not sure if I'd come back for more pizza though."}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed by the pizza, in fact I got a headache afterwards probably from over chewing. The texture was way too chewy and the topping was lamb, which was dry and plain. I wouldn't pick up the slice because it was either too much toppings or too soggy or both. That already failed my test if I need a fork to eat a god damn pizza. I wouldn't recommend their new dish pizza. From the reviews, other pizza might have been a better choice. I also got the chips for the appetizer. Avoid that as well. The chips has good texture but lack flavor ... Some pre-seasoning would be great. 

Anyway the service was great tho! Very enthusiastic bartender. Modern decor and good atmosphere. 

Will come back for a second try."}
{"text":"Good ambiance, quality food and excellent location. I went for Happy Hour with a work colleague and had a pizza and cocktail. Their cocktails are abbot too similar and fall-focused at the moment. Also they consisted of either spicy notes were made of dark liquor. 

The pizza is pretty big. Probably a 16\" or so. There are not multiple sizes so I'm not sure how an individual tackles this. I believe it was called Cornerboard and was adorned with pork belly, pepperoni and sausage. Extremely thin-sliced, fresh dough and toppings, and signature brick oven taste. The pizza stands out almost as much as the price: $18. 

The service was also good, and I look forward to returning."}
{"text":"Great place for late dinner even tho they only serve pizzas after 10:00pm. the wood fired  pizza was thinner crust like we like and was really delicious with just the right amount of toppings.  We are going to make a big effort to come here earlier for the Dinner hours to try their pastas which are housemade.  Great new find for casual dinner in Pittsburgh!!"}
{"text":"This place is a great addition to the downtown theater district.  Great beers, good wine list and amazing looking (and smelling) pizzas.

We stopped in last weekend during that odd time between lunch and dinner - so they weren't serving their whole menu.  We had a couple of drinks and chatted for awhile with a guy who I'm assuming is the manager.  It's so good to see that something worthwhile has finally replaced the old and run down Tambellini's.  While we weren't able to try a pizza, we did try their homemade chips and onion dip - YUM!  I'm a sucker for homemade chips, but these were particularly tasty.  Crispy and perfectly salty - it was a great compliment to the cool and creamy housemade onion dip.

I can't wait to go back and try out some of their pizzas."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! The pizza is amazingly good. The service is top notch. Michelle is an awesome bartender and is very cool in general. Solid beer selection. I cant say enough about how good the carnivore pizza is. One of the managers I met is a good dude too. The guy with the bow tie. We liked this place so much we came back two days in a row during our trip up here."}
{"text":"The Margarita was awesome!!!!!!!!! One of the best I ever had. I sure everything they serve is awesome as well."}
{"text":"Good choice of beer on tap. The pizza was okay; the crust was a little too thin for my taste but it still tasted pretty good. There was a long wait initially and they did not want to take reservations for later but around 10pm, it emptied out and we got a table."}
{"text":"The pizza at Proper is fantastic.  They are clearly going with a quality over quantity approach; portions aren't very large, but the excellence of the ingredients and flavor profile of the pizza is top notch.  I'll have to come back here off the clock sometime to sample what looked like a solid beer selection on tap!"}
{"text":"Such a great experience all around! I was in town for work, so I grabbed dinner at the bar.

There is an extensive drinks menu covering beer (mostly local craft beers), wine, and cocktails. Happy hour is 4-6pm with $5 house wines and $1 off draft craft beer.

The food was all excellent. I had the candy bacon (essentially, a plate of bacon with delicious brown sugar coating - crazy unhealthy but so good) and a pasta dish. The menu says the pasta is made in house, and after eating it, I totally believe it. The pasta was so fresh and tasty. I also hear the pizzas are great (they certainly looked great) but can't comment as I didn't have any. 

Overall, the bar service is the best service I've ever had at the bar. Normally it can be difficult to grab a bartender's attention, especially during busy hours (I was there at the tail end of post-work happy hour), but I always had several bartenders checking in.

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"It was a two-show Thursday in Pittsburgh and Proper, in the heart of the Cultural District, was packed.  

 We sat at the bar.  There is an extensive tap selection and they are happy to let you explore with a taste or two before your final selection. My selection was the black pepper Paloma.  It was the perfect happy hour, post traffic, pre show choice. 

Four of us shared the pepperoni and cheese starter, followed by the Tuscan Sausage Soup, and various salads, including the BLT Salad.  All very lovely and tasty.  

We also chose the Mediterranean and White Pizzas.  These pizzas would have been perfect for two...  had it not been for the appetizer, soup and salads. Both were flavorful with the crust done just right. Our clear favorite was the White, as we left a couple slices of the Med... figuring the other show goers preferred that we not take home!

The staff is attentive, even with the stress of show-rushed patrons, but they are used to the slam, for sure!

I would love to see their downstairs dining room and menu."}
{"text":"Decided a beer was in order after work today so I stopped into the Brick Oven Proper for a \"Proper\" beer.  With 30 taps on the wall, the selection here is outstanding offering a mix of local brews and craft favorites.  I went with a Draai Laag Goedenacht (Belgian styled ale) and I couldn't have made a better choice!  It's delicious; just what I was in the mood for. 

And speaking of delicious, the pizza and pastas here a terrific too.  This is one of my \"go to\" spots to meet up for dinner with friends or a date prior to a show or ball game.  I usually get the carnivor pizza. In my opinion it's the best pie in the Burgh. 

The Brick Oven Proper and Tap Room is  an easy five stars."}
{"text":"I had a nice dinner here before a show in town.  We sat at the bar because all the tables left were marked for larger groups, but  I like sitting at the bar, so that was quiet alright.  The menu isn't big, but it's focused.  You're coming here and you know you'll have pizzas, pastas, and maybe a few salads and that's all they need.  The pasta with simple tomato sauce was flavorful and I enjoyed it.  It got a little one-note halfway through; I would have liked more fresh herbs to add some brightness throughout the whole meal.

The bartenders were friendly and fairly attentive for the most part, though they didn't seem very busy just yet, so they should have been keeping an eye on us.  The only odd part was one of the staff members sitting at the bar eating.  I couldn't tell if he was on the clock or off, but I was a little confused because he seemed like he had some managerial position.  Other staff members were coming to him and asking questions, sampling new beers he told them were just brought in, and generally interacting with him while he sat and ate a pizza.  He wasn't being crass or loud, I just wasn't sure if he was being entirely professional.

All in all, I had a great night.  If you're torn between a draft or a cocktail, I'd go with a cocktail.  It seemed like a better value.  Most of the beers were between $5.75 and $7 and anything over 7% ABV (as most of the higher-priced beers were) were served in 12 oz glasses and the Lemoncello Collins my boyfriend ordered was $10 (and full size).  I'd pay 3 more for that."}
{"text":"Awesome place! We ordered the bacon and chips for appetizers. The bacon is to die for. We ordered the carnivore, margarita, and black and gold pizzas for the table to share. All three were very different and equally amazing. They also a wide variety of beers on tap. We are definitely going back!"}
{"text":"This will become your new favorite pizza place. I was a skeptic at first, but once I tried the pizza, I became a believer. The specialty pizzas are to die for! Perfect bubbly crust and toppings are overflowing! Enjoy and I'll probably be seeing you there"}
{"text":"This place has probably THE best wood fired pizza I have ever had! And I LOVE pizza...so this was very exciting for me! I went with friends during our lunch break on a Tuesday.  We had the lunch soup special (creamy chicken broccolini) which was fabulous and split two pizzas between the three of us ladies.  We got the Margherita and the Black and Gold. The Margherita was good a, but the Black and Gold was phenomenal.   It had Yukon Gold potatoes and golden beets on it....two things I had never had on a pizza....great combo. 

Service was great. We were seated right away. Always had our drinks refilled without asking and they split the check for us.  Overall, wonderful experience and we will be back for sure! 

I am still thinking about that Black and Gold pizza!"}
{"text":"After eating here I was surprised to see such high ratings for this place. I wouldn't say the pizza blew me away and I wouldn't say it was not that great either. It was in between. Sometimes \"in between\" places bug me. Either be horrible or exceptionally good. The in between is just 'meh.' I got a Coke and a margherita pizza here. The sauce on the pizza tasted canned and I wasn't a huge fan of the crust. Something tasted off about the cheese and didn't feel or taste like a true fresh mozarrella. I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"We stopped in here for an early lunch on Sunday- looked good!  Once inside, the interior is mood lighting- not what I expected. I just saw this has 4.5 stars, with a decent number of reviews. I'm a bit surprised as our experience wasn't great. The food was good, drinks and service were not. First, it wasn't crowded and we waiting at every single step in the process (except, we were seated immediately)... it took forever for drink orders, food orders, food, interim service & the check. The family next to us didn't get one of their orders until all were done eating. Our food was really good- French toast, potato hash (?) & chicken & waffles. Our drinks were watered down- as in water like (sangria); and, I rarely, if ever, say this. Perhaps the most annoying part was that the server did not bring syrup. Since he was awol, I had to physically hunt him down & ask. He said the waffles had syrup on them... you could see that I needed to convince him of my need! When he gave me syrup, it was a minuscule amount! I had to ask for more syrup- I ran out again. And no, I don't have a problem with syrup... the waffles were dry as can be! All in all, a mixed bag."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza! I am from nyc and heard about this place and had to see how it compares to nyc pizza and it didn't disappoint! The white pizza is divine. Great service amazing atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Got here before 5pm on a Sunday and were seated right away. They were not too busy. We had to be at a show by 6:30 right across the street from the Benidum. Husband had a beer flight which was neat. I enjoyed the Apricot beer. He ordered the candied bacon which he liked and their pesto pizza which was a special-also very good. I ordered the house salad which I can't say enough good things about. It was just an awesome salad. I also had the margherita pizza which was really just okay. I liked my husbands pizza way better. The server was friendly. However, as it got busier, the service was way slower. It took a long time to receive our salad and bacon and even longer after that for the pizza.  We ended up having to ask for our pizza to be put in a box and took it to our car before it even came to the table so we could walk across the street by 6:30 which was really disappointing to not be able to enjoy at the table especially since we were in and seated before 5pm.  It is a neat place and my husband is excited to go back. I just wish we didn't have to wait an hour and a half for our food."}
{"text":"Not bad. More of a stopping place for tourists or people going to a play. I don't need to know about the personal lives of the staff. Keep it quiet bar staff. Downtowners there is better, suburban visit once."}
{"text":"This place is legit. Gourmet Pizza with lots of beer options on tap.

I must say I was a skeptic when I read the menu and barely knew what half the ingredients on the pizza were. I thought this place was going to be a little too uptight for my taste. I was very wrong.

We stopped in before the Pirates game and much to our surprise we were seated immediately with a perfect view of the brick oven. They had one cook making all the pizzas which was very impressive (all members of my party commented on his difficult job). We had the Margherita Pizza (san marzano tomatoes / fresh basil / house mozzarella / extra-virgin olive oil) and the Forest Pizza (caramelized wild mushrooms / roasted shallot / balsamic reduction / fresh thyme / fontina). Some of the best gourmet pizza I've ever had. Absolutely delicious! 

Loved the atmosphere and found the pizza to be exceptional. We all left big fans of The Proper and would be very surprised if I didn't return here soon."}
{"text":"For the appetizers we got the meat and cheese tray (the duck was delicious), the chips, and the bacon candy. The chips were great but the bacon candy was disappointing. It wasn't crisp or sweet enough for me to be called candy. For dinner we got 4 pizzas to share: Bianca, Carnivore, Mediterranean, and the Black & Gold. Everything was delicious, but the Black & Gold surprised me as my favorite one of the night. Simple ingredients but really good flavors. The crust is amazing. And the place smells like you're at a campfire, which is just awesome. For dessert we got desserts to share: the bread pudding, the Oreo crostini, and the coconut cake. Everything was great, but the bread pudding was just out of this world good. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Mmm. I generally liked the food and atmosphere here. We got to sit at the psuedo-bar that looks straight into the brick oven. It was very fun to get to watch the pizza-makers do their thing -- they cooked probably ~50 pizzas during just the time we were there for dinner.  It looked like a hard and tiring job!

The food seemed to be generally very heavy (they are generous with the oil and cheese), but pretty good.  The gnocchi appetizer was not your traditional gnocchi: the pieces were enormous, and covered in EVOO, cheese, greens, and fried garlic.  Greasy but tasty!

We also shared a Forest Pizza.  The crust was amazing...wow!!  The perfect combination of doughy and crusty and flavorful.  The toppings were nice as well, but I was a little disappointed by the flavor and texture of the mushrooms the way they were chopped.  The menu description gave the impression that there would be a larger variety of mushrooms, and I thought they were a bit too chunky (would have been nice to have thinner slices).

There is a large beer selection, but the prices are pretty steep for the pours you get, which are mostly less than a full pint for the good beers."}
{"text":"Proper is such a great spot downtown and I can't wait to cozy up with a glass of wine and pizza there this upcoming winter. The atmosphere is great-- very rustic, cozy and intimate with tasteful decor. It is a bit small, so think twice before bringing a larger group, but for 2-4 people, it is great. I had the best glass of Zinfandel I've ever enjoyed here and saw that their beer list is impressive, consisting mainly of local craft brews. The service was very attentive and accommodating, allowing me to sample the wine before I ordered a glass (I am skeptical of ordering wine by the glass). My boyfriend had the Margherita pizza and we both loved it, especially the crust! I thought it could have had more cheese, but I guess I could have ordered cheese pizza if that's what I wanted. I got a special crab pasta and was underwhelmed-- it was bland and just overall a meh dish. Adding salt and parmesan cheese made it marginally better. That being said, the pasta noodles themselves were really good and I could tell they were freshly prepared. I can't wait to go back and try more pizza flavors here, but will steer clear of crab pasta."}
{"text":"My wife, family and \"village\" would love it! Brewery's and winery's and their close relatives wine and beer bars, look good in brick .  I admit it. I see a classic brick interior and I'm already comfortable. 
Being on travel and eating alone is tough for me .  A good wait staff, comfortable setting, good food and drinks can go a long way to putting me at ease .  
This place has it.  Amazing beers, even though I was in a martini state of mind, nice menu, and attentive professional staff.  
My choices were all good - vodka martini, up a few olives, a risotto with clams and shrimp entree (perfect except a bit heavy on the butter ) .  No room for dessert. 
The pizza looks like a hit based on the orders rolling out. 
5 stars for sure !"}
{"text":"Rustic pizza and drinks place with pretty long bar seating as well as smaller tables! 

Came on a Saturday late afternoon, not busy at all. Had the ocean pizza, which was unique and delicious (I loveee seafood but haven't really come across seafood pizza before) and my friend ordered the carnivore, which had a ton of meat on it, although wasn't as special of a pizza (in his words). The crust is my favorite part, firm enough to hold toppings but soft and seasoned enough that it feels like a breadstick! 

Little overpriced but would come again."}
{"text":"I had a great experience here. While killing some time before a concert, my friend and I walked in, never having heard about it before. We were very pleasantly surprised. 

There's a rustic yet modern feel to the bar and while I only had a gin and tonic, it was a delicious experience nonetheless."}
{"text":"Proper treated us great from start to finish. The staff was very friendly and efficient. We ordered the beer mussels as a starter and they were very good! As for pizza we ordered the margherita pizza and it was delicious as well. The sauce and crust were both spot on. Lastly we ordered the rolo cookie cheesecake and it was incredibly rich, but melted in our mouths. We were thoroughly happy with our experience here, and will return next time we are in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Quick seating, even before a play in the theater district, food prep is visible and quick, excellent beer selection.  Toppings on Pizza to order.  Well stocked bar.  Fun discussion with one person who was making the pizza's.  I am learning to enjoy and appreciate places where I can actually see the food being prepared -- no mystery.  We will be back on the next visit to the Cultural District."}
{"text":"From the Bacon candy and house made chips to the Carnivore Pizza and the Pig and Fig Pizza I did not think the meal could get any better. Then came the Chocolate Torte and Caramel Cake and that just put the meal over the top. Can not WAIT to come back!!  This will defiantly be a go to for brick over pizza in the future!!  

Great job!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were in the area and wanted to get a quick bite to eat and settled on this place based on the promise of craft beers, which he loves. We were both impressed with the beer selection as it had a wide variety that fit both our tastes. And we were both pleasantly surprised by the pizza, it was delicious! We were served quickly, which was great as we were starving. We got the carnivore and it was just enough to split and we devoured the whole thing in record timing. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone in the area looking for pizza and beer."}
{"text":"Very good pizza and great service. Nice selection of beers too. Brought the kids, it was fine. Off to the ballgame!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in while in town on Sunday afternoon. Place was steady busy between lunch and dinner.
Bartenders Kayla and Victoria where constantly on the move but still both found time to check with each customer just enough. Victoria recommended the Mussels which are served with garlic toast. Fresh and seasoned right. Perfect light snack to wash down w a few RT lagers.
Good food, good service.Theres more to this place than initial impressions of an \"upscale\" pizza place.
I'll be back soon to explore more of what's on the  menu."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised at how good the food was here. I had the house salad, bacon candy, and split four different pizzas. 

The bacon, I have to say that it changed my mind about sweet bacon! It was perfectly sweetened and spice! I couldn't stop eating it. I found a new way to enjoy bacon. The house salad used butter lettuce with goat cheese and sweetened walnuts was out of this world! The Carnivore was perfect; just enough meat so it wasn't over powering the pizza. The Bianca, Margherita, and Mediterranean were excellent as well! IMO, I would say this was the best pizza out of New York."}
{"text":"Had lunch today. Pizza Margarite was very good. Crust very good. Service not up to par. Sat at bar, had to ask bartender for menu, he was busy cleaning up after lunch crowd. Again, pizza very good, had to ask for check after waiting. Would have given four stars if service warranted."}
{"text":"Checked this place out while visiting the Burg for the weekend. Awesome wood fired pizza and great service. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Wife and I went to the Proper Brick Oven & Tap Room on Tuesday night for dinner.
I had the Halibut special and tried some of my wife margherita pizza.
I also had a beer on tap which was pretty good sorry do not remember the name.
My daughter had a sour beer that was on tap and hat was really good.
I think from now on I am into sours.
The service was good and the waiter was extremely friendly and gave us great service.
The fish was just ok noting special at all.
I did try my wife Margherita pizza and it was totally delicious.
I would go back again and definitely get a pizza.
Overall i would recommend going to Proper for pizza and beer.
The service was great and so was the pizza and beer.
If in the area definitely worth a stop"}
{"text":"Came here just after the lunch crowd on Saturday for some good pizza. My husband and I sat at the bar and were serviced by a busy bartender recovering from a big lunch rush. She wasn't the friendliest and actually mixed up our pizza order with the father and son sitting next to us, therefore we ended up waiting an extra 15 minutes for our pizzas. Drinks were OK but they did have a wide variety on tap. Overpriced for what we got, most likely won't be back."}
{"text":"We found this place on Yelp while visiting from out of town for the A-10 basketball tournament. Arrived around 4:45pm on a Friday and were immediately seated. Michael, our waiter, was excellent...service impeccable. We ordered the Margarita pizza (very good) and the Brisket Mac and Cheddar (out of this world! Sooo good). The atmosphere was classy and comfortable, albeit close. When we left an hour or so later, the place was packed. You could tell it was a local favorite. We would definitely return if ever back in town."}
{"text":"This place is perfect from drinks, to apps, to entrees, to dessert everything was delicious. Our server Kali was on point. She took all our information and food came out in a timely fashion. Nothing was rushed but we also did not have long waits for anything. We also had leftovers that she promptly, neatly boxed up. The manager also made it a point to stop by every table and ask about the food and service. You can tell they really care about the diners having a great experience. 6:30pm on a Saturday night the place was packed! 

DRINKS:
Maple Old Fashioned - very strong drink, husband was impressed
Gluten Free Beer - amazing they serve it for our gluten free diner
Homemade Mocktail - this was iced tea, lemonade, black berry, and mint. The syrups here are made in-house. Refreshing! As a non-alcohol drinker, I was excited to have a fun drink that was delicious but not soda or plain water or plain iced tea! 

APPS:
House-made Chips and Dip: This is just $4. It's the perfect beginning to any meal. As a person who always chooses House-made Chips over fries and loves onion dip, this is great! It's like artisan chips and dip! 
Forest Pizza: Mushrooms are plentiful and flavorful. Chewy crust. Perfect to share as an app if eating with a group. The fresh Parmesan and chili flakes help add to the deliciousness! 

ENTREES:
Scallops Risotto - the scallops are perfectly seared. The cream and cheesiness makes for a yummy rich combo. The description of this entree says kale. I was afraid this would be too much kale or like saut√©ed spinach. However, I was pleasantly surprised that this was crispy fried bits of goodness! It did not mess up the richness of the entree. It was little sprinkles of salty kale chip essence that also gave the dish a pop of color.

Bolognese - homemade pappardelle pasta. Flavorful meaty sauce. My husband practically licked the plate. Well-portioned. This dish comes with bread he said was delicious and loved using it to clean the plate of the sauce. 

Carbonara - homemade fettuccine pasta. I can't get over the deliciousness of the homemade pasta. The creamy pancetta was paired perfectly with the al dente pasta.

Apple-Sage Sausage And Polenta Special - This is a special. It may not be there when you go there. Specials are changed often and it seems the menu changes almost every two weeks. It's great to always be able to try new entrees. The sausage is homemade and the polenta is very creamy. 

All the entrees were amazing and we would order all of them again. I love that everything is homemade. Presentation and portions are also well done.

DESSERT:
S'mores parfait - toasted marshmallow, chocolate custard, graham cracker crumbs. The toasted marshmallow is beautiful and I loved toasted marshmallow. It mixed well with a spoon of chocolate and graham cracker. The combo of all 3 flavors is perfect. Unfortunately, there is just one layer of marshmallow and two of chocolate and graham cracker. While delicious, I wish there was more marshmallow. 

My sister lives in the city which is why I was here. Apparently, this was her third time here in a month!!!! I can definitely see why she comes here. It's her favorite restaurant in the city. Everything tonight was delicious and we will definitely return. If you take anything away from this review please know this... yes the pizza is delicious but there is also so much more than just pizza."}
{"text":"Pizza was awesome, we had a Bianca and a carnivore. Bianca was the clear winner but both were great. Amazing dessert- bourbon peach cheesecake. Good service"}
{"text":"I located Proper while snooping around Yelp for an alternative to Il Pizzaiolo which had been our normal dinner spot when we make the occasional trip into town for a show.  We went on a Friday evening and there was a 30 or so minute wait for a table for two.  Once seated, we had a cozy table in the corner by the pizza oven.  Our server was friendly and helpful and she made frequent stops to check in to see if we needed anything.  To start, we split an order of the house chips and they were wonderful - thinly sliced and had a perfect balance of crunch/chewiness. The onion dip that comes with the chips was nicely done as well -- just the right bite of flavor but not overpowering.  My wife had a house salad and Margherita pizza for her meal and she had great things to say about both.  Her only regret was not ordering outside of her comfort box and getting a more daring pizza.  I started with the Tuscan sausage soup which I enjoyed and had the pot pie which was very nicely done.  It looks HUGE when it arrives but it worked out to be just the right size -- big enough that I was filled but not so big that I had to force myself to finish it.  Somehow the whole thing seemed to remain piping hot the entire time I was eating it -- it didn't seem to cool off at all!  The beer selection appeared to be all domestics, which for me was a bit of a downer.  I am more traditional in my beer preference and tend to stick with established European brews.  I am not a fan of the goofy named craft offerings that are trendy at the moment  - I would have much preferred a wheat offering from Weihenstephaner, Franziskaner, Paulaner, Ayinger or Erdinger with my meal but the available Monkey Boy wheat wasn't horrible.  Overall, a very nice dinning experience.  Unfortunately, we didn't save room for dessert but from what we saw being delivered to some of the other tables, the desserts looked good, really GOOOD..   We'll be back again when we make the next trek into the city to see A Servant To Two Masters in a few weeks at the O'Reilly.

Updated:  12/6/15 - We visited Proper again last night before we went to see a show at the O'Reilly.  We sat at the bar this time as the wait for a table might have caused us to miss the start of the show.  Everything was fine but this time around wasn't quite as filling as the last time -- in retrospect, we probably should have started with a pizza or something.  Service was fine at the bar although no one stopped to check on us to see if we needed anything once our food was served until all we had in front of us was empty plates and glasses."}
{"text":"We popped into Proper for lunch on a whim. It was not a mistake. Four of us shared 2 pizzas and it was the perfect amount of food. Both the Bianca and the Pesto pizza were both delicious and I will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"We went here to try the wood fired pizza, it was ok, I've had better.  It has a nice atmosphere and a great location.  This place has a lot of great reviews so I do want to go back and try some other things on there menu.   I had there winter sangria which was pretty good!"}
{"text":"The pizza here brings the bar up in downtown Pittsburgh. Tons of theatres & things to do near by. Parking is easy as there are lots all around the block.
The vibe is cool and on the classy end vs most pizza joints...totally cool to wear jeans... ;)"}
{"text":"Wow, great to have a great tap room with great craft drafts on tap downtown. No less than 5 double IPA's on tap currently. Can't wait to see how this place does, as I work nearby and I've been waiting for an alternative to Sharp Edge. I will be back."}
{"text":"We decided to drop by on a recent Sunday night.  The place was not busy at all, just a few lone diners at the bar and a couple of other couples scattered about.  First off, I love the decor.  The wood burning brick oven on the lower level surrounded by a small bar for those who want to watch their pizza being made.  Up a half flight of stairs, there is the rich red brick wall behind the massive bar.  Love the rustic light fixtures and the butter yellow covered banquet and chairs and beautiful wood tables.

The menu has some nice choices of snacks, salads and pizzas.  They also have some interesting seasonal specials.  This place is all about the beverages.  They serve 30 craft beers from local and regional breweries, a list that is forever changing.  They also serve wines by the glass and cocktails.

We came in to enjoy a pizza and decided to share The Carnivore.  The menu description is as follows:  San Marzano tomatoes, house-made sweet and hot Italian sausage, spicy pepperoni, bacon and  house-made mozzarella.  This pizza doesn't really look like much.  But it was super amazing.  The crust was absolutely perfect.  Just the right amount of chewy goodness.  The Italian sausage is out of this world.  Perfect in every way.  Just the right amount of spicy hotness.  The pepperoni, bacon and cheese were all very good.  Perfectly seasoned, cooked just right.  BJ said it best.  \"Jules, this is the best pizza that I have ever had\".

We didn't stop there.  We needed to have dessert.  We shared the cinnamon-almond pizelle cones with vanilla mascarpone, cinnamon apples, and candied walnuts.  It was really good, not overly sweet.  And the perfect dessert for two.

We look forward to our next visit.  Can't wait to try something from their seasonal menu."}
{"text":"Pizza is phenomenal, and the candy bacon is the best around! But if you ever find yourself here during the fall, for the love of god please try their Headless Wylie beer. One of the greatest beers I've ever had and I can't thank the waiter enough for showing it to me!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza (the Forest), and even better beer. I had what the bar keep recommended. Perfect meal, nice staff, and a group came in and sat next to us that we had a great conversation with. All over a cool experience."}
{"text":"The pizza was fantastic! Don't let the outside of the building fool you, it's really cool inside! Sweet vibe and awesome decor. The service was friendly, and the cocktail and beer selection is vast. 

The pizza does come out quick since they pop those suckers in the brick oven right away, so don't be afraid to let them know to pace it out. Take your time! 

We ordered the margarita pizza with bacon - delicious!"}
{"text":"Fresh wood fired pizzas, handmade pasta and desserts all from the freshest of fresh ingredients. Service, beer selection and cocktails are always on point."}
{"text":"By far best service I have received in Pittsburgh! Todd and Corey were amazing! Corey was extremely attentive making sure that our water was filled and Todd made sure our orders were perfect. 

This is also the first time for a restaurant downtown that my food was piping hot! 

Best place downtown hands down will for sure go back!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed it here.  There wasn't anything in particular that kept it from 5 stars, but I just didn't feel like it was the most amazing thing I've ever eaten.  
It was however, very good.  I went with a group and we sat at one of their 2 high top tables.  Most of the other tables are along the wall, and there's not a ton of room to walk from one end of the restaurant to the other since the chairs are pretty close to the bar.  This was especially true on a cold November night when everyone had fluffy coats as well. 

Anyway, our group got a mix of the house salad and their chicken and dumpling soup.  Both were thoroughly enjoyed.  We then split 3 pizzas
1.the black and gold pizza - potatoes and red onion.  I think this was my favorite, but they were all very good
2. The Bianca - a bunch of different cheeses - also very good
3. The Greco (New) - which had braised lamb.  This was probably the table favorite.  The lamb was such a unique addition to pizza.  

They also have a great alcohol selection and the staff was excellent. 
I'll definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar for dinner on a recent trip to Pittsburgh. I had the chips, a carnivore pizza a BLT salad and a PA Saison. The chips were tasty but not the knockout that others seemed to suggest. The pizza was first rate. But the salad was spectacular. It was (from their menu), \"baby spinach / oven-roasted Roma tomato / house-cured black pepper bacon / roasted red onion / honey-Dijon vinaigrette.\" The oven roasted tomatoes were warm and played well with the dressing and house-cured bacon. This might well be the best salad I've had. My only error was choosing the half size portion!"}
{"text":"Made a reservation about 1 week in advance for a large party of 13.  On arrival, they had 2 large tables in the back ready to go.  Kayle (spelling?) and a Tyler (I think) helped us and they were great!  It can be hard to coordinate with that many people but they never missed a beat.  Everything that we tried was very good and they have a nice beer selection.  A few TVs allowed us to watch a playoff game.  We sometimes got a bit loud because of a family rivalry but they were very accommodating the entire time.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Service was good. The food was amazing. We got the chicken mac and cheese and pesto pizza. The food was really hot. It was fairly expensive but not unreasonable. It was worth it. It makes a great place for a date night."}
{"text":"We came here a few times before for a drink and decided to come back before we went to our show playing at the Benedum next door.  I remember they had good beer here but I forgot about their brick oven pizza.  When we walked in my wife (who doesn't really like pizza) thought it smelled good in there and it was making her hungry.  That's a good sign that there is good pizza here.

     We got a beer each and then headed to our show.  I really wanted to stop back after the show to have another drink but it was nice in here and we were having a nice night.  So we did!
We were a little hungry so we went over the menu and picked out a Pesto Pizza.  I like traditional pizza with tomatoes base pizza sauce, cheese, and meat on my pie.  Since we were sharing I went with one that my wife would like and I'm glad we picked this one.  It was so good.  It was a great brick oven pizza.  I want to come back to try some different pizza from here.

     The atmosphere was good there too.  It's kind of dark but relaxed.  The seats are comfortable and the bar is nice and open.  It's nice to watch a sports game here.  The service was really good too.  
When we go to a ballgame or attend another show we will be back here to get a drink and try another pizza for sure!"}
{"text":"The only thing that could supersede this wonderful dinner was our server, Kyle, so let me start with him.  He was flawless!  He greeted us, introduced himself and told us about Happy Hour, making suggestions for our drinks.  He helped us out with our orders and followed our instructions to a tee (the usual for the lady: \"dressing on the side, no onion, etc.!\")  Our salads and drinks were served promptly and then our pizza arrived right on time.  Kyle appeared immediately with fresh parmesan for our pizzas!  Kyle is the quintessential server - he is there for you to take care of all your needs, but he is polite and low key, and doesn't talk your ear off!

The salad was epic (the new \"Root\" salad with beets, goat cheese, etc.) - so much so, that I was worried about getting through my pizza.  Not so for my husband, who inhaled his BLT salad AND enjoyed the carnivore pizza!  He was in heaven, as was I with my Bianca pizza!  Kyle made sure that I had no garlic oil and had the chef use plain olive oil for me, per my request.  The pizzas were fantastic, as were the salads!  

You must go to Proper Brick Oven and Tap Room and if you want the perfect night, request Kyle.  He is a professional and an incredible server!"}
{"text":"THE BEST. There isn't a bad dish on the menu. We tried about 15 different things (yes, there was a group of us) and it was all delicious. From the mac and cheese to fettuccini alfredo and the pizza - all phenomenal. Also - get the parfait and cookie dough cheesecake. I've yet to find Cheesecake as good as there's. Tyler was our server and he was the nicest, funniest and most patient server I've ever had wish is so refreshing. 12/10 recommend!"}
{"text":"I've been here about 4 times for lunch and dinner and haven't been disappointed yet. Today I got the Tacchino sandwich with the spicy veggies and it was amazing. They also have a very solid and balanced craft beer menu. 

I've had their pizza and it was very solid as well. If you are a pizza fan, also check out Caliente in Bloomfield."}
{"text":"I just went there the other night for dinner. The decor of the restaurant is awesome. I really loved the light fixtures. The size of the restaurant is very small. There is limited seating for dinner but there must be about twenty seats around the bar. 

Our party started with their signature Proper Snack - Bacon Candy. The bacon used is smoked and cured in-house. The Bacon Candy was really good. It has a brown sugar glaze and black pepper crust. This gave the pork belly an initial sweet taste with a kick. I have never had bacon prepared that way. For my entree, I got the Forest pizza. The Forest comes with caramelized wild mushrooms, roasted shallot, balsamic reduction, fresh thyme and fontina. It was a really good pizza. Proper Brick Oven and Tap Room cooks their pizzas in an 800 degree oven. They serve their pizzas as soon as their come out. My only complaint is the crust. When I think of brick oven pizza, I really want a nice crispy crust. I think the thickness of the crust prevents the pizza from getting a really crispy crust.

Overall, I great place to eat in downtown Pittsburgh. Their drink menu is also very extensive. Unfortunately I did not sample any of the beers, but they seem to have a lot of local beers on tap. I would love to come back and try a few flights."}
{"text":"Oh mother of god I've found heaven! Insanely good pizza and the beers don't get me started its incredible selection and I've tried like 8 now in flights and they are all sooooo good. If you like beer and pizza get off your ass and get down here now!"}
{"text":"Good pizza options!! We ordered the carnivore, pesto and Bianca pizzas which were all pretty good. The best item by far was the candied bacon! We also had the pesto pasta which wasn't my favorite, but it was alright. I would recommend!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service. Definitely recommend the carnivore pizza.  Also, spinach rigatta dumplings, pancetta wrapped shrimp, bacon candy and pepperoni bread.  Cannot say enough about the food!  Everything was delicious!  Our new favorite place!"}
{"text":"If you haven't had Proper yet, just drop whatever you are doing and go. Now.

One of my coworkers goes here frequently so I've been hearing about it for a while. I finally stopped in last night with a couple of friends for a late dinner. We were only inside for a moment (since we wanted to sit out front and enjoy the nice evening)--but the smell in there! It was like the most glorious scent of pizza and smoked meats. Do they make that in candle form? Because they should. Next time I will sit inside as it looked very cozy and the ambiance was nice.

I started with the Black Pepper Paloma, a tequila-based cocktail with black peppercorn simple syrup, grapefruit and lime juice, and served with a salt and pepper-rimmed glass. Amazing! I loved the contrast between the sweet fruit juices and the spiciness of the pepper. The salt and pepper rim was a nice touch and enhanced the flavor even further. I'd get this again for sure.

My friend ordered the Pepperoni Pagnotta as a starter, and it was a hit. This thing is tough to describe accurately--but imagine a three-inch tall dome of pepperoni, fontina, and the most delicious bread. The top half was basically hollow, which resulted in the \"roof\" of the dome to be nice and crispy. The lower part (housing the meat and cheese) was soft and packed with flavor. The little bread dome of perfection also came with a zesty marinara for dipping. Wonderful!

I had the Soppresatta pizza, a generous-sized pie with salami, roasted shallot, arugula, garlic spread, olive oil, and fontina. (Fontina seemed to be the theme of my meal?). You can't beat a brick oven pizza and this was no exception. The crust was amazing... soft inside and perfectly crispy on the outside. The flavors of the toppings went together nicely; there was nothing to dislike about this pizza. At $17, the pie was big enough that I have plenty left over for lunch today--not a bad deal at all!

I definitely recommend this as yet another great downtown spot for dinner and drinks!"}
{"text":"The real stars are the pizzas and the draft list. In my opinion, skip the rest and you will be very pleased."}
{"text":"Go for the craft beer on tap, stay for the \"bacon candy,\" some kind of crazy delicious pork drizzled with a thick, sweet sauce. Heinz Field is within walking distance, so great choice for Game Day. Love the gourmet pizzas, too."}
{"text":"Came here with friends for a birthday dinner.  the food was as great as everyone on yelp raved.  We shared the bacon candy, which was sweet, salty and spicy at the same time.  It also smelled yummy!  My hubby and I shared a carnivore pizza (sorry lenten friday. I had already cheated in the morning, so I went along with it the whole day).  I must say that the pizza was delish, but the toppings were spread out unevenly so some slices have more meat and others just have cheese.  For dessert, my hubby and I shared the Emily's chocolate cake? it was just ok.  My hubby was disappointed because he thought it was a real chocolate cake and the presentation didn't help either.  It was a dense flourless chocolate cake, super rich with a berry sauce.  Our friends got the bread pudding and the toasted almond dessert, which both looked good and the presentation on the almond dessert was nice.

For drinks, my hubby had a stilleto, which is usually a drink he enjoys but the fruit juice they used and whatever else in the mix ruined it for him bc the stilleto he's used to is only makers mark and amaretto.  He's a big whisky drinker.  I had their cider, which I enjoyed bettter than an angry orchard.  It tasted more crisp and less sweet. They have a great variety of beers on tap, but the one thing the birthday boy wanted, they ran out off. oopsies!  The server did make another recommendation, and she was pleasant and attentive to our table.  

This place looks bigger on the outside, but it was really small and crowded inside that there's barely a walkway.  We had one of the two big tables in the back for larger groups, but I can see how the smaller tables in the front can have no privacy bc you are so
close to others and anyone walking the aisle would have to walk in single file.  I can't imagine having the seats by the aisle always having to be conscious about moving the seat to make way for diners.  Not a lot of room to move.  The decor was very nice and appropriate.  I love the use of mason jars for decor and drinks.  They also have a nice size of a bar with tvs.

The other off putting issue is that my friend said when she made reservations that they had a list of random and strange rules some are understandable like everyone in the party must be present before being seated but there was a 2 hr time limit for the table.  Luckily, it's winter and in negative wind chill, so they weren't too busy.  We did only stay for 2 hrs anyway.  I definitely recommend this place for food and drinks, but not for claustrophobics and parties bigger than 8 otherwise definitely make that reservation."}
{"text":"As it's name suggests...this place serves beer and pizza...proper...no doubt. It's a modern but casual bar scene.  The personal pizza is off the chain (I had the sopressata which was delish)....the beer selection is on point (probably 30 awesome and unique craft beers on tap)...and the bar servers are knowledgeable about the beer and spirits and are very friendly.  Our bartender Mike was friendly, professional and quicky reccomended a beer pairing which was spot on.  

Personal Pizzas are $15-$18.  Beers are in the $6 range.  Well worth it.

If you are in Pittsburgh do not pass this place up.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"You can't buy happiness, but you can buy pizza! 

I stopped in for a much needed pizza break with a few other pizza loving companions. It took a very long time to get seated because the hostess was no where to be found - not the greatest first impression. The interior itself was beautifully decorated. The darker lighting gives the restaurant a more intimate feel. 

Our waitress came very swiftly to take our orders. Our table split the Proper House Chips which came with a french dip. I definitely recommend it for a quick snack before your meal! I had the half Proper House Salad for my starter which was great but so puny! I'm not sure a couple pieces of lettuce is worth $6. For the main course, I kept it traditional with a Margherita pizza. It was very appetizing but surely not the best pizza I've had. It was fairly average, but if I'm paying $15 for a personal pizza, I expect something special. Anyone who knows me knows that I absolutely need ranch with my pizza, and Proper didn't have ranch! None?! How is that possible?? 

The meal was fine, but for the prices, I would say skip this place and grab 5 pizzas at Pizza Hut for the same quality. Sorry, Proper, I'll get my pizza cravings satisfied elsewhere."}
{"text":"Bacon candy was great. Loved the beer selection. My boyfriend and I got two flights and had a tough time only selecting 8 out of the many. \"Heyday\" was amazing and the winter lager."}
{"text":"Pizza for lunch is the best but only when it's good and man is it good here.
I'm not always in the mood for oven-fired/brick oven pizza but when I am it better be the best I've ever tasted. Proper lives up to my expectations. Hence the perfect name for this establishment.
The meat pies are amazeballs. Love me some some good meats!
I also really like their salads and chips as well.
If you're downtown it's definitely worth the visit."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of what they are doing here! 

All of the food that I have tried has been delicious and well portioned for the price. 

Some of our favorites include the bacon candy which somehow tastes better each time we get it,  the Bianca pizza which is so delicious and has the most perfectly crisp,  chewy,  and slightly charred crust, and the funghi pasta which has sauce that you will love sopping up with the crusts from your pizza. 

The atmosphere is great and their tap list is amazing and constantly rotating. 

I can't wait to go back and try more items!"}
{"text":"Potatoes and beets on pizza! Say whaaaat???

But it happens here, and I must say, it's delicious! So do yourself a favor and try the Black and Gold pizza. I especially enjoyed the crispy potato parts of the pizza.

I also tried the Forest pizza, which came in a close second. It was loaded with mushrooms, onions and garlic. So remember your mints for later.

I really liked the crust. It wasn't as thin as I thought it would be and I like my crust a bit doughy. Was this a mistake because its supposed to be wood fire pizza? I don't know, but I enjoyed it!

I love the atmosphere in here, as they did a great job making it intimate inside. Can't wait to come back and enjoy a beer from their large list next time!"}
{"text":"This review is just for the bar. Stopped in for a quick drink while waiting to get dinner with a friend. Great atmosphere. The decor, exposed brick oven, and display of taps made for an intimate and cozy yet chic interior. The beer selection was extensive and pretty unique, and luckily they offer flights for $10 if you're indecisive like I am. Bartender was friendly and knowledgeable about the beers on tap. Noise level inside was very mild and great for drinks and a conversation. At least from what I could see and smell the food looked good too!"}
{"text":"The wait staff was very nice and attentive. However, I was disappointed with the quality of the food. The other time I've been there, the food was amazing and warm so I had high expectations when I went in there again. The pita chips for the hummus didn't taste fresh at all and were cold. The pizza came out in a timely fashion, but was cold as well. 

I really like this place, so I'll come back. Maybe I just caught them on a bad night in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Hands down the best risotto I've ever had!  Like, lick the plate clean! You have to try it!! Friendly and attentive staff. Excellent beer, wine, and mixed drink assortment. Casual ambiance - came in in shorts and a t-shirt and felt right at home! Think pub meets incredible Italian cuisine!  Will definitely come back if I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"I can tell you without eating here yet, best service  I spilled wine all over the place and on the next table on a woman wearing a white sweater. She was very gracious. The manager compted their meal. Also the wItress was drenched and was very good about it.

The pizza is great! We will be back this week."}
{"text":"Yummm.... I couldn't resist the temptation after hearing so much of this place from Yelp and local suggestions, so my family and I decided to stop here for lunch.
We first started off with the house salad. The Bibb lettuce was fresh and crisp and not heavily doused with dressing (which had a great balance between sweetness and acidity- perfect with the pear!). It was topped with candied walnuts and goat cheese that gave the salad a nice crunchiness and savoriness. 

As the for the pizza, it was good. But not amazing. Maybe it was just me? I ordered the Margarita Pizza that I shared with my mom. The crust is thin and chewy but the saucy part was a tad bit too soggy for me. Don't get me wrong; it was a good pizza, but it tasted like our homemade version... which is a bit disappointing if you paid $15 to have something more special (like the stone fire oven; so cool!).

My dad ordered the Chicken Caprese Sandwich. I had a bite, since he seemed to be enjoying it so much, and I have to say it was a pretty darn tasty sandwich. The chicken had a smoky char on it, and paired with the melted mozzarella, tomato and pesto, the whole sandwich rocked. I also enjoyed the pickled veggies that it came with.

Overall, I would recommend this place. Not only is the food yummy, but the atmosphere is nice. With friendly staff, dark-ish lighting, and sports turned on the screens, this place gives off a cool vibe that is great for casual dining with friends, families, and dates. Plus, although I don't drink alcohol, it was cool looking at all the choices of beer!"}
{"text":"My wife, son and myself decided to try Proper after a long day touring Pitt and the beautiful city; great excellent choice by my son. Tyler was our waiter and was kind and attentive. We had the shrimp/pancetta app and the bacon candy, the shrimp was yummy and the bacon candy was unreal. BLT salad for dinner along with a pizza and black garlic wagyu; all were top notch. Donuts, flourless chocolate cake, and cheesecake parfait for dessert; again all superb. We will definitely be back when we visit again."}
{"text":"Really nice atmosphere, good food and fun/large draft selection. Will most definitely return but it's a little expensive. I really enjoyed the meat pizza although I can't recall the listed name."}
{"text":"We ordered the Forrest pizza. I must admit that I was a bit hesitant to order a pizza with a balsamic base but it was surprisingly delicious. The dough was clearly handmade with fresh yeast and was left to set for an appropriate amount of time. The crust was prefect! It had the perfect combination of slightly doughy yet crispy. The beer selection was great! They had at least 15 beers on draft. Cold beer and amazing pizza. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"I'm glad I decided to give Proper another chance. The first time I was there was two years ago, and I think they've worked out the kinks.

I arrived at 4:30 with plans to meet friends for an early dinner. I was able to get a table without a reservation at this time on a Saturday. 

They have an extensive beer, wine and cocktail list, and I chose to have a glass of the 2011 Gen 5 Zinfandel from Lodi. Top notch. 

The waitress, Kali, was very attentive and pleasant. She revisited to give us time to make our decisions. 

We started with the antipasto as an appetizer. It came with duck, sopressata, buffalo mozz drizzled with a balsamic glaze and basil. There were also pickled veggies and a really good bread-like side that complemented everything. Also unique was the lemon ricotta spread. 

All of our dinners were excellent. I had the lamb special, while my friends enjoyed the carnivore pizza and the funghi pasta. 

Wonderful experience and we will be back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic! Great atmosphere. Very relaxing! The bartender working lunch today was on point :) so was the playlist. Excellent advice on beer selections and the menu - the food is delicious. I enjoyed a proper salad (small) and a Bianca pizza + bacon (OMG thanks for that suggestion!). If I lived here I'd come back often."}
{"text":"My son requested his birthday dinner be here. He'd already been with his step-dad and I had yet to try it. We showed up about 6:20 on a Wednesday and there was no wait and there was plenty of space between guests; it didn't start filling up until we were leaving around 7:45pm.

We decided to just go family style and ordered a bunch of stuff to share:
-Proper house chips- Nothing fancy here, just a reasonable serving of fresh sliced potato chips with a really tasty French onion dip. 
-Famous bacon candy- After trying one slice I didn't want to share this, but alas, there were 4 of us. Sticky sweet and smoky and delicious! It's a small serving though so maybe only share with one.
-Beer mussels- I've had some badly cooked mussels, so I often get nervous trying new ones. These were fantastic! The beer/butter broth had a great flavor and the mussels weren't over cooked, they were perfect.
-Pancetta wrapped shrimp- Huge shrimp wrapped with crispy pancetta; I brushed the balsamic drizzle off because it seemed like too much but it was really good. 
-Margherita pizza- The sauce was -really- sweet; I wasn't a fan. 
-Forest pizza- If you don't love mushrooms, skip this; it's loaded with them and the flavor is heavy. I liked it, but one slice was enough.

I also ordered myself a bowl of spinach artichoke soup; by the time it came out I didn't even think I had room for it until I had a bite. I had room. The artichoke was subtle and the cream base was smooth; all of the flavors were complimentary and the texture was A+. 

The kids split the chocolate cake. I had a bite of course, and it was extremely rich but good. 

Service was prompt, friendly, and attentive.

Overall this was a really enjoyable experience and I'd definitely like to come back and try some of the large beer selection."}
{"text":"Two words. Bacon candy. Fast service, quality good! Also the house made chips are awesome! Not too pricey. Definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"I love this place, I really do. The pizza isn't standard neapolitan or american in style, but it is brick oven and really delicious. Also, it feels so cozy inside. The staff is nice, and the whole vibe is just very inviting. I'm happy to settle in and enjoy an Arsenal cider while I wait for a wonderfully fresh salad and a kick ass pie. While all the pizzas are swell, I would recommend the bianca and the forest - really, really lovely. I look forward to each chance I have to go here :) If they had a backyard or roof deck to hang out on in the warmer months, I would seriously go every week."}
{"text":"We loved everything about this place! My husband and I both enjoy craft beer and they had plenty of great selections for every taste. We started withProper House chips yum!  Then we got their awesome artisan pizza. We ended dinner with the white chocolate bread pudding. OMG is all I can say. I usually watch what I eat and if I cheat I feel a little guilty. This place was worth every calorie!  Next time we come to Pittsburgh we will come back!"}
{"text":"Great little gastropub with an amazing beer selection, delicious food, and a laid back vibe. This was the perfect place to enjoy a low-key drink and catch up with friends. The staff was excellent and made you feel comfortable and like part of the neighborhood. The beer flights allow you to sample many of their wide selection of beer and prices were reasonable. Overall, a great spot that we visited twice during our stay in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Awesome place in the heart of Pittsburgh's cultural district. Love the deco, really classy. Lovely service.
Delicious oven-fired pizza with thin crusty dough. We had a Marguerita, a classic but still really good. And a more flavorful one The black and Gold pizza with thinly sliced Yukon potatoes and red onions. I really recommend it. Ask for garlic on the side;) 
Their deserts are scrumptious too...peach tostada and chocolate bread are not to be missed."}
{"text":"We went here before a show at the Benedum center and it was pretty disappointing. Two people, two appetizers, one 8slice pizza, a couple drinks each and desert for a total of $110. 

The ambience was nice except that they had made sure to squeeze a butt into every possible square foot in the room so it felt cramped and hard to get around. 

Wait staff was nice, no complaints there other than the fact that we felt like maybe our waitress was kind of hoping we'd eat and run instead of stay and chat over our $13 drinks. 

The drinks were the best part of the meal. 

Everything else was OK. If the end of the night bill would have been half as much I may feel less negative about it, but clearly this was not good demanding the cost and the ownership obviously just sees the location as warranting charging $18-25 per mediocre dish. 
The Cheesecake was not really Cheesecake but a dry bread style cake with a thin layer of cheesecake ontop. The greasy lack luster pizza could have been bested by any number of cheap pizza joints. The appetizers were nothing to write home about. 

All in all...The people were friendly and it was a move spot to kill some time before a show with a couple drinks. But nothing more than that."}
