{"text":"Awful. I was so excited to have a coffee shop must down the street from me when barriques opened, but every experience I have had here has been so disappointing. The staff seems young, inexperienced, unprofessional and disinterested. Every cappuccino I've ordered here has come out as a bad lukewarm latte. The glass case of baked goods is always swarming with fruit flies and it is really disgusting (the staff seemed really unconcerned about this when I pointed this out). I just don't even bother going anymore, i will actually drive a mile away to get coffee somewhere else. Terrible!"}
{"text":"Meh, another chain... albeit local feels very much like a chain experience. The well known chain also pushed out a fabulous small coffee shop that had opened across the street. Totally lost any respect I had left for this business. Two stars only because the open concept is nice for warmer months. Coffee is ok and food is subpar. So many better choices in Madison."}
{"text":"The pastries are good, and the staff is nice (Barriques is a solid coffee chain with wine/beer options). However, because of its corner location, there's a lot of traffic and exhaust that drifts into the open-area seating. Barriques is good, but I prefer the amazing coffee and quieter atmosphere of 5th Element, diagonally across the street and down just far enough so you don't get the noise and car exhaust that drifts into Barriques."}
{"text":"A new Barriques in my neighborhood! I'm a fan! I usually trek over to the Monroe street location, but this is a great addition for those that work at UW hospital and are health science students living in the area. It's right across the street from Lombardinos (and unfortunately nearby 5th element bringing in some competition).   Same menu, similar looks. LOVE to see that they have outlets near all the booths and almost by all the tables. It's definitely smaller than the Monroe hub, and carries a lesser assortment of wine and spirits. They have a few less tea options than other locations too, but otherwise follows suit with the other Barriques sister locations.   Looking forward to when they open their garage door windows for the spring and summer!   Sidenote: One of the employees mentioned that they're ending their Belly reward system. If you use this at other locations, they don't have it here! Cash in those rewards soon."}
{"text":"This is a great place to meet for coffee with a colleague or friend. For those looking to study or read, not so much. The afternoon I paid Barriques University a visit, just about every table was taken and it was LOUD with conversation. The noise was so bad that the barista who took my order for a misto gave me chai instead. It is fun to watch the Old University street traffic out the plate glass windows if you get bored with your conversation."}
{"text":"Guess I should've looked at the menu here before coming in. Food was actually pretty decent, if a bit funky. You ordered and then sat down. Eventually somebody from the back came out, slapped down  your bowl of food, and yelled out its name. The names of all the dishes are quite odd, so you're really not sure what the person said. Then they turned and walked away. So everybody that ordered food just kind of looked at each other wondering-is that mine? Is it yours? The staff did not really seem concerned that people get what they ordered."}
{"text":"I love Barriques. I usually go to the Monroe Street location, but this one just opened up near my work. Today was my first day going to this location. They promptly took my order, but then forgot to make it! They apologized several times and the drink was great, but it seems like they still need to figure things out. I'm chalking this up to being a new location and will return."}
{"text":"Due to Barriques, my favorite coffee shop in town closed down because barriques drove them out of business. Way to go, you crushed my soul."}
{"text":"20 mins for a milkshake when there's nobody here. The wait staff seemed to be having fun taking pics of the other drinks they made (for themselves). I asked if there was butter or jam for my scone and was totally ignored while they were talking. Pretty expensive & the staff could use a dose of customer service training."}
{"text":"A short walk from my house.  Back in the day, when I was living in the Fitch, Barriques was my go to place.  Great staff.  Solid menu.  Good coffee.  Now that I live in University Heights, the coffee offerings have expanded and I must admit the Barriques brand doesn't carry as much weight.  With that said, I do enjoy this location immensely.  They have great staff and the room is definitely set up for those that are working (great wifi, outlets at most every table, etc.)  Bonus is that they have garage doors that they open, when warm, with a small patio.  Great spot to spend a few hours while pounding away on your laptop."}
{"text":"One block from the Best Western Inn Tower makes it pretty convenient for a quick bite before heading out to the airport. Got the pulled pork quesadillas and they were adequately filled with bell peppers, cheese, pulled pork, and some saucy goodness to dip it in. Could do with more cheese and more crispy tortilla but all in all delicious. Wish it were bigger for the price."}
{"text":"How about a little heart? Good coffee and atmosphere, but shitty experience. Quality of service seems entirely dependent on whether you tip at the register; it took 5 minutes to pour an iced coffee. I usually don't tip for a simple pour, but apparently that's a shitty move; I won't be returning to find out, even though it's my closest cafe. The smile went away after he turned the register back towards himself, only for it to return in force for the next customer. I was also having a bad day (a couple days ago), bad enough to be clearly evident, and no sign of a sympathetic look whatsoever."}
{"text":"I adore this location of Barriques! I have been an avid customer of this Madison chain since I was in 7th grade, and I love how they keep on expanding through Madison.   The menu and drinks are the same as the locations, as well as having a wide variety of pastries. This location has the perfect amount of wine for a display. There is a nice balance of white, rose, and red wines for people to choose from. They also have some smaller coffee related merchandise that people can purchase from.   This location on University Ave probably is one of my top 3 favorite locations in Madison along side the Capital location and the Monroe location. They have 2 major walls just dedicated to floor to ceiling windows allowing the most amount of natural light. This location also has a patio for people to use when the weather is nicer.   There is a bounty of seating here at this location. From tables and booths meant for 1-2 people to large groups of people, they can accommodate your seating needs!"}
{"text":"I lived a couple blocks away while in school and would have been here everyday if had been there! During the summer they are able to open the big side doors so the place completely open and the cool outside air can come in. You can still sit inside but it's almost like you're working outside without the sun beating down on you.   Their coffee is good. I've only had the iced coffee a few times. It's not my favorite coffee in the world so it's probably about average. However, the prices are super reasonable. Also, lots of outlets for your technology. I thought parking would be annoying but I haven't had any issues finding street parking the several times I've visited.   It's a great place to study. It's also a great place for a date given their nice atmosphere and fairly large wine selection.  I will definitely frequent this place while I'm in Madison."}
{"text":"Decent space with decent seating. The day my classmates and I went, we decided to order a bottle of their Cabernet Sauvignon, which paired beautifully with our homework assignments.  The cost of the actual bottle was about $10. This would have been super reasonable and student-friendly if they didn't charge a $5 corking fee, which brought up the cost of our bottle by an additional 50%."}
