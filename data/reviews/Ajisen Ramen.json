{"text":"Ajisen Ramen  was worth the stop. We were looking for a delicious soup to end the night and ended up getting lucky. I had the Spicy Chicken Ramen. I was unaware that they were about to close, but the worker unlocked the door for us anyways. The restaurant was clean and chilly. Instantly our orders were taken as we were welcomed with a cup of tea.   The Spicy Chicken Ramen was delivered to the table with steam rising from the bowls. The Spicy  broth was exactly was I was looking for.  I could feel each bite in my sinuses! This bowl is one of the most popular on the menu and it was for a very good reason! I highly recommend Ajisen Ramen."}
{"text":"Staff is very friendly and fast whenever I go here. Lots of selection in different types of ramen."}
{"text":"The owner is really condescending to his Japanese employees. This is my favourite go to spot for the tom-yum ramen !"}
{"text":"I would give them 4-5 stars based on just the food (I always order their Tom Yum BBQ Pork Ramen). But their service is so SH*T.  They have a drop-box where you grade your respective server's service. It notes something along the lines of \"The Best of the Best service\". It should really read \"The Best of the WORST Service\".   I never had an issue a year ago. But for the past year, I have just been receiving NO service at all. The restaurant is empty and the bimbo waitresses don't even have time for you, giggling in their own little corner. This is based on the 6 most recent visits."}
{"text":"Came in today at around 2:30 and surprisingly it was pretty busy. We were greeted by someone who I think is the owner. There was a large selection of food so he helped me choose the best thing on the menu which is the BBQ shoyu pork ramen. Food came fairly quickly and tasted great! Price was decent considering the portion and the quality, which was $10.50.   Tl;dr amazing service and amazing food. Will definitely come here more often. 10/10 would recommend!"}
{"text":"This is one of our go-to places for noodle soup, especially now that our son has developed a taste for it!  We usually come at dinner time and it's always busy. When we go on a weekend there is usually a line up but there isn't much space to wait around. The owner can usually be seen working and he is genuinely a nice guy, making sure customers have a good time.   My two main choices are either the Ajisen Ramen ($8.99) or the Beef Shank Ramen ($9.99). The only difference between the two is the type of meat included (pork vs. beef), otherwise the toppings are the same. The soup base is flavourful but if you want to add more there are garlic/spicy seasoning shakers available at each table. We usually get the deep fried chicken as an appetizer as well - nice and crispy with a sweet chili sauce to dip.  Note for parents: they do not have any high chairs but they do have boosters. The fisher price kind that can be strapped to the chair and has seat belts."}
{"text":"Food comes out quickly, and the drinks are pretty good, but I'm here for the ramen, and unfortunately, the ramen is very meh.  It simply can't compare to Santoka and Sansotei ramen.  If you need take out, Ajisen does in fact have ramen for takeout, which is the only advantage it has over Santoka and Sansotei.  But if you have time for a sit down?  Pass if you really care about ramen."}
{"text":"Pork ramen is amazing!! Sure there's a little msg. But indulge a little. This place is great."}
{"text":"I'll admit - I used to love eating at this restaurant until my lip reaction started to tingle. Now I've learned that eating the ramen here is basically eating an MSG'ed soup. This is NOT authentic ramen but i guess it's not so bad once in a while since i do enjoy ramen. This is more like mediocre fast food place rather than a nice authentic ramen restaurant. They do sell other dishes such as teriyaki, Japanese curry and other items that I've never tried before which i proabbly should next time, rather than the ramen."}
{"text":"I love going here to eat Ramen. Definetly one of my faves. The menu provides a variety of different kinds you can try which is great! I love their noodles best how it's cook just right to maintain its crunchiness and still be soft enough to eat. The broth is also really good too, very flavourful! They also have a variety of famous japanese side dishes that you see in those animes that people eat. My favourite would be the Chicken Knee Caps and the Mini Octopus! They also sell curry rice and other stuff as well, its a really GREAT RESTAURANT!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to come here since we were in Scarborough. We both are ramen lovers and have never been here. All I have to say is that we were not happy. First of all there was a long ass line. Okay we get it, busy means good right? So we waited.   For starters don't order the California roll. The sides were all premade. Don't order the California roll. It came out broken and god knows why they still serve it?! It was hard and disgusting. The takoyaki was yummy, order that instead.   When the ramen came out, it was quick, and smelled delicious. I ordered a Tom yum one but my boyfriend ordered the beef one. His broth was way better. Overall It was okay. It wasnt kinton or kenzo. You do get a lot of meat which is great for meat lovers.   Nothing special. Never going back again."}
{"text":"Why I came here: Because Kinton Ramen is overrated.   1st Impressions: Way better than Kinton Ramen. I first went to the Steeles & Warden location and was impressed by the quality.   On a side note, you can never go wrong with the Kimchi Steak Ramen if it's your first time.   The Service: Really quick. They serve you hot tea as soon as you sit down, which is nice. Great for small groups of people (4-6 people).    The Menu/Food: By far my favorite menu. Pictures for every single item they serve. You know what your food looks like before it's in front of your face. No more regretful food choices.   They also serve California Rolls, Rice & Meat Dishes, Seaweed if you're not in the mood for Ramen.   What I Had: Spicy Pork Ramen for $10.99 (Medium Spice Level - Just Perfect)    Portions: If you want quantity, go to Kinton Ramen. If you want more quality than quantity, eat here. One bowl will be enough for one person.   Price: You won't spend an arm & leg. Ramen ranges from $5.99-$10.99. For two people, you spend under $30 or even less.   Atmosphere/Ambiance: Typical Asian restaurant vibe - The smell of hot tea and foreign dialect. Not noisy like a lot of other Japanese restaurants, so you don't have to shout at the person in front/beside you.    Overall: Ramen is a great alternative to the usual Pho soup that everyone is familiar with. Rich in flavor and a lot of variants to choose from. From Seafood to Steak Ramen, you will not be disappointed. Do not be afraid to try new Ramen flavors.   ****4/5 Stars - Will Go Here Often"}
{"text":"This ramen spot is one of the many franchises throughout Toronto...but it isn't one of the best. The meat portions are minuscule compared to other known ramen spots. The pricing is decent and the waitresses don't really take care of you besides giving you tea at the start of your meal. If you want more bang for your buck than i suggest to look at other ramen spots."}
{"text":"I had tried Ramen downtown Toronto at this place on queen street and it was my first time and the food was great and the service couldn't have been better. I can say that my first experience made me want it all the time.   And so I tried Ajisen... And let's just say the service was horrible. We were better off getting served by farm animals. The staff is very unwelcoming never said hi never said bye, no your welcomes after we said thank you. We never got sat, instead the waitress pointed to a table. When we placed our order the waitress simply gave a 'hmm' and went on her way. When we got served the waitress placed out dishes at the edge of the table and left. Not to mention that we had to walk up to the hostess stand to get our bill ourselves.   Most definitely not a welcoming place at all. And If your not of Asian ethnicity the servers stare at you.   I would rate the food a 7/10  But would definitely not this place overall."}
{"text":"Great ServiceI will go again ! The food are great !ramen have different soup tasteLove it !"}
{"text":"This place is a Chinese run ramen place.  It comes nowhere close compared some of the authentic places you find downtown.  However, this is one the first ramen places to open in markham and it will certainly hit the spot for those who just want to satusfy a quick and dirty ramen craving. This place is very tiny and surprisingly I've seen the line go out the door on Friday nights.  Personally I would go drive a few blocks down and visit Sansotei or Kinton, but to each their own.   The portion are a bit small for me but still enough for a meal. However, the quality of the meat is not fresh and some peices were extremely fat.  Personally, my favorite part of the ramen is the soft boiled eggs with the running yolk, the ramen I ordered didn't come with an egg and the ramen my gf ordered came with half of a hard boiled egg.. huge turn off for me there.   Overall, this is a decent restaurant but it does not offer what I'm looking for in a ramen. It was good for its time before Sansotei and Kinton opened up on hwy7. Personally, I wouldn't come back, I would much rather drive a bit further for some real ramen."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the Ajisan ramen that I ordered. A huge bowl with plenty of noodles and meat for only about $6.50. Tastiest ramen soup I've had. The service is pretty good. There was one guy who was kind of grumpy and gave off a \"I hate my life\" vibe, but he was still quick and attentive."}
{"text":"Poor attempt at Japanese noodle by Chinese. Calling this ramen is like calling East Side Mario authentic Italian ristorante."}
{"text":"Good soup flavours but I wish they would add more meat in their dishes.  perfect for a rainy/cold night!"}
{"text":"Great chewy ramen noodles with thinly sliced lamb meat in curry broth!  Both parents and I love this place.  Slightly on the salty side but very flavorful - would have been a 5* if it wasn't.  Service is friendly but a little slow for the lunch rush... but well worth the wait if you're looking for hot soupy noodle lunch."}
{"text":"ok, I created a profile on here just to write a review on this place. I have to admit I have never had ramen noodles in a restaurant before, but I'm pretty sure that this is not what it is supposed to taste like. To me, it was basically a msg-paste soup. All you tasted was salt or MSG. The noodles seemed more like spaghetti noodles... not the traditional ramen nooldes that I'm used to at least. I had the pork miso soup and there were 3 THINN slices of pork that came with it. The egg was rubbery and you can tell it's been in storage for a while.   The weird thing is that I'm not even that picky about ramen. I actually don't mind la lot of the packaged and homemade ones. In fact, I like those better - at least you get a taste other than SALT AND MSG.  The portion was quite small, despite the fact that the bowl looked giant. One order is not enough if you're hungry or are looking for a full meal.  The service was ok, a little slow in the evening.   The only thing I liked from that place was their bubble tea - only 4 bucks with your meal, and it's decently sized."}
{"text":"This is my Ramen joint. Yes I've been to Kenzo several times although it may be more authentic I just find the broth tastes too rich.   Anyhow the soup broth at Ajisen is yummy makes me feel warm and fuzzy perfect for the cold days. However their servings are somewhat small i typically add extra noodles for a dollar and get another side of meat like chicken, but something about the broth makes me crave for more :)"}
{"text":"From stepping into this place, I can somehow tell that it is probably not owned by a Japanese person.  However, I feel that they have studied a lot to create these ramen.   I ordered the ramen with chicken katsu. It is unusual to eat ramen with chicken katsu but I thought why not?? Ramen soup came out steaming hot, just the way I like. The whitish rich color of the soup is very appealing. I tasted the soup and I thought at first that it needs a little more saltiness. But after few more tastings of the soup and the noodle, I realized that the soup has a deep flavor that it does not need too much salt. It was awesome.   The chicken katsu came on the side, it was not in the ramen. Chicken katsu was very crispy and meat was tender. It did not have much taste though. I wish it came with some type of sauce like a tonkatsu sauce. I poured some of the vinegar-soy sauce that was on the table to my chicken katsu, and ate it.   It was overall very good. Not to mention the hot tea they bring out, such a nice service."}
{"text":"The BBQ pork ramen. Every. Time. The broth is wonderful and flavourful, the fatty pork falls apart in your mouth. Also comes topped with bean sprouts, chewy black seaweed, green onion, and my favourite - half a hard boiled egg (flavoured with something, though I can't place what). Noodles are always perfectly cooked. Service is super fast; this is the only place I can go to and get back on time for my 45 min lunch break from work."}
{"text":"Order the vegetarian curry ramen, and you will be happy!"}
{"text":"Its freezing staying there because they never turn on the heater in this cold winter. I would not go back ever again, they do not even keep the basic things."}
{"text":"?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Come here often as we do like the ramen. But may have to boycott this place for a while. Then waitress came out with everyone's order on the table but mine and I clearing remember placing mine. Then waitress never apologized or offered anything for their mistake. Horrible service. Reflected on the minimal tip I gave."}
{"text":"I got ajisen spicy pork ramen at 150 degrees. It was pretty spicy! The pork that came with it was okay. I tried the hot spring eggs because I thought it would be similar to a hard boiled egg I had in Japan but it was not... Not at the fault of the restaurant though. The servers were nice and the restaurant looked pretty clean."}
{"text":"A lot MSG. One time I ordered a bowl, there was plastic strings in my bowl. The service was OK. There are so many much better Ramen places in Toronto."}
{"text":"Utter disappointment with food. Spicy pork and beef is full of fat. Not much protein in the ramen bowl for $10, which is unfortunate as noodles are quite good. Ended up leaving most of it and eating elsewhere."}
{"text":"Had the Ajisen Dip, it was insane. Broth was nice and fatty. Had to order 2. Wife and child had the Tom Yum and Sirloin along with the pork rib ramen. If you go, go for a bowl of Raman. I made the mistake of ordering what I thought was chicken Curry katsu and it was horrible. Basically gave me chicken karage with a side of rice and Curry goop. However service was fast and the manager was super friendly. Only other gripe is the portion size (why I ordered 2), and the hyper j-pop music. Will definitely come back for the Ramen though."}
{"text":"Prior to my visit to Ajisen, I had never tried real ramen (do the chicken flavored packaged noodles count?), so I did not know exactly what to expect. I ended up ordering the unagi ramen, which seemed promising considering my love for BBQed eel. Unfortunately, the eel that I thought would be in my bowl of soup was served on a separate plate as a side dish. Another problem was that the broth was so salty that I could barely taste the other ingredients.  Otherwise, not bad. The appearance of the large bowl stocked with vegetables and noodles was disconcerting, but it ended up being quite satisfying on a cold, snowy night.  Lastly, I ordered a cup of mango bubble tea to go. Not the best idea. The drink was watery and lacked flavor, which is not how I think it should have been. So I just ate the tapioca.  Three stars for the filling meal and nothing more. Good for a quick bite (well, I don't know how 'quick' it will be considering the portion size), also has a nice location."}
{"text":"Visited Toronto for a day on Monday. Did a walking tour. Ran into this place by accident for a quick dinner before heading back to Niagara Falls. Got gyoza for appitizer. It was temperature hot and tasty.  It took them a little too long to get it out. Order BBQ Pork Ramen. Taste good but not great.  Good service. The credit card machine was just broken when I was trying to pay. They accepted US dollars at 1:1 and gave me changes in Canadia dollars."}
{"text":"My favourite ramen place in the city -- well, granted, I only know of two (other being Kenzo). I still have yet to try the okonomiyaki at Kenzo so my allegiance still may shift in terms of preferred restaurant, but my vote definitely goes to Ajisen for a bowl of ramen. Mmm!  Update: I found ramen on this continent (in New York) that was a gazillion times better and I can never go back to the grease soup and non-legit noodles that is Ajisen."}
{"text":"Came with three colleagues from work and we all walked away very impressed.  The staff was very friendly and helpful and the food tasted fresh and delicious.  Had the spring rolls which tasted hand rolled, along with some kimchi fried rice, and spicy tom yum soup with steak.  We all agreed that this has now joined the regular rotation."}
{"text":"Haven't gone back after one traumatizing incident & it's simply too far from where I live. Just hope they don't use melamine anymore. I prefer Japanese pottery. It's not too much to ask for. It IS a ramen house, right? Might as well maintain SOME level of authenticity. Once (many years ago), a fairly high-profile infomercial personality was sitting across from me (a handsome young fellow who advertised Dr. Ho's massagers along with a pretty personal trainer-esque Asian lady. Both had perfect unaccented English unlike Dr. Ho & beautifully toned bodies. I enjoyed those infomercials a lot. They were quite entertaining). ANYWAY, there was an apparent hairline crack on this fellow's melamine teacup. I could see it from a couple meters away having sat two tables away from him & his friends. 3-4 light sources were hitting the right spot, emphasizing it. Before I had the chance to point it out, the server poured hot tea into that cup & it instantly split in half & scalded the poor guy's lap with hot tea. I still feel somewhat guilty & horrible for him to this day. Anyway, the food was so MSG- & salt-laced, I was always driven to drink a full litre of water or pop afterwards. Also, since they didn't use genuine heat-retaining pottery nor presented my order in the original vessel the ramen & broth were simmering in (having the penchant for cheap durable melamine instead) everything cooled so quickly I always felt compelled to speed-eat-- which did \"wonders\" for my digestion (quotation marks indicate sarcasm 'cuz I don't know how to use italics here)."}
{"text":"Mmmmmmmm............  Ramen............  What can I say?  Where I come from, we don't have many ramen places to patronize.  Coming to Toronto to visit family, I was fortunate to eat at this place.  Let me say that just thinking about the experience, I've got a hankering for some ramen right now!  Located in a strip mall, the place is small and busy, but tables seem to clear quickly to accommodate waiting customers.  The menu is pretty expansive and I couldn't decide what to get.  I ordered the BBQ pork ramen which I thought was pretty tasty.  The broth was a little too salty for my taste, but good enough that I could order it again next time I visit.  The noodles were cooked al dente, chewy and absorbed enough of the broth to give it flavor.  The pork was really tender and delicious.  Service was good since the manager/owner was quick to accommodate our large group during lunch time.  I do wish they could clean up a bit better.  We were sitting next to the window and the sills could use some serious dusting or wiping down, just saying.  But I do wish I was there right now...."}
{"text":"The server gave us ample time with the menu and hot herbal tea was served to start. The food was very savory. I ordered BBQ Pork Koji Salt dish and it was delicious. I will go back for sure."}
{"text":"Ajisen Ramen is a staple for me, but not anymore. On my most recent visit to the 5229 Yonge Street North York, Ontario location, I was disappointed to find that they ran out of Tom Yum. How can this happen to such a restaurant that specializes in soup based Ramen? It's like McDonald's running out of Big Macs. Anyways, I ordered another soup based Ramen with steak on the side. The steak was so chewy that I had to leave it. I told the waitress to inform the chef that the steak was very chewy and she replied \"I know\". Which begs the question: \"why are you serving it then\"? and \"why are you not giving me a refund\"? At $30+ for two Ramen bowls and 2 small side dishes, it's not cheap and would have expected better quality. To management of Ajisen Ramen at the Yonge location: You know you can do better than this and from this experience I know you don't want to. You've lost one of your stable customers."}
{"text":"Really Amazing ramen!!! Perfect portion sizes! Awesome menu options. Super reasonable prices. Clean environment. The service is the only thing keeping me from rating this a five star, to get the servers attention you have to ask multiple times... But other than that the food is totally worth it! I'll definitely make this my go to ramen place! Ps. The Spadina location is just as amazing !"}
{"text":"This is my third time eating at this restaurant.  The service and food are usually excellent.  Tonight when my husband and I walked in I noticed something different.  Normally the servers are busy running around serving food, refilling water, pouring tea, etc.  Tonight there were 3 young women standing around talking to one another and some friends that were just there to hang out because they didn't order food.  The server took our order and the food took much longer than usual and we asked for water which we never got.  All of that stuff is tolerable but the one thing I could not tolerate is that the 3 servers were standing in front of the counter and doing their hair IN THE RESTAURANT!!!!!!!!! Around the tables where people were eating!!!!   On top of that the one girl that wasn't working was finger combing her hair and applying makeup while sitting at the table.  It was absolutely revolting, I almost walked out but we were already running late so we stayed and finished.   The food was good as always but I am not sure whether I would return to eat at this restaurant.  As of this moment it is highly doubtful."}
{"text":"I like Ajisen Ramen :)  The broth tastes amazing.  Its true the portions could be a little better, who wouldn't like more meat but other than that its great.  I went to Ajisen Ramen in HK a few times and the broth here is on par.  The staff is very friendly and as I've been working my way through the menu I have yet to be disappointed.  This place is an excellent choice if you feel like noodles but be warned there is often a line up during prime times.  Take out is a good option too though."}
{"text":"The ramen here is not the worst that I've ever had. That being said, it is nowhere near the best I've ever had. I ordered the BBQ Pork Ramen from this location. It came relatively quickly (within 5 minutes) and was okay. The meat was quite fatty, which may appeal to some people like myself, but my girlfriend who came along thought that the meat was way too fatty.  The soup was okay. My soup was fatty. There were many visible large clumps of oil which made the soup look a bit unappetizing. However, it still tasted okay. The tomato soup base was not good at all. It tasted like they mixed their usual soup base with a can of canned tomato soup.  The service at this location was okay. We were seated quite fast and gave us tea right away. However, they took a long time to come take our order, even while we had our hands raised."}
{"text":"I would give them a 4.5 for food, service, etc. but their free wifi bumps them up to a 5.    Delicious and nice portions. Big bowls for the soups. Interesting japanese murals for decorations. Clean and nice smelling washroom (not always something you see in Chinatown)   Needs to have later opening hours (10:30pm is way too early, I'd come here at 2am if I could). Needs to get LLBO."}
{"text":"A chinese friend took me here for lunch and I really enjoyed it.  This is a chinese restaurant that serves Japanese-style ramen noodles.    I ordered the Tornado bowl... was VERY spicy and delicious!  I have a very high tolerance for spicy food,  but this bowl had me sweating!  yum!  My friend said that Ajisen is a famous franchise in China, and very popular.   I can understand why,  it was a great lunch and I'll most likely be back."}
{"text":"This is my favourite ramen spot in Toronto because they are cheap, have beef ramen on the menu (most ramen spots only have pork or chicken), and the interior is so cute with the pink seats! I love them enough that I even use Door Dash to get delivery (and that's a $6 delivery charge via that app, folks - I don't care. Worth it.). They are also super friendly!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for ages but this is my first review.  Still very tasty and delish but I think the portion sizes are a bit smaller.  The BBQ pork pieces seem smaller.  The chicken karage pieces are definitely smaller.  Still gave 4 stars as its one of my favourite ramen places.  Ramen is cooked to the proper texture and soup bases are good."}
{"text":"My favourite ramen spot in the strip. Where this is located there's probably 3/4 other ramen places nearbybut they really kill it!  Good price, prompt service and delicious food!  My go-to ramen place for about 3 yrs now!"}
{"text":"One of the best places around. Moreover, the Warden location is amazing. They are very accommodating to small children and I've never felt rushed coming here. My 11yr old messed up on his order (our fault) and the manager rolled out the red carpet to fix things up. One of the best places to have Ramen...the broth is not layered with fatty oil like many other paces and it's prepared really well. Price is great. Noodle is great."}
{"text":"I love the tom yum ramen so much but I really dislike the manager who's slightly fat and always in suits. He is very impatient and impolite. He makes you feel like you are here because you owe him money. The last time I went there, I wanted to seat by the windows. He told me to sit closer to him so he didn't need to walk too far. Can't believe this is what a manager would say to a customer. He showed an annoying face aft I said I wanted to seat by windows. For sure, I left. What's the point of having a bowl of ramen with such bad service? Never ever come again."}
{"text":"This is the first ramen place I've gone to, so I don't have much to compare it to.   I ordered the most basic one, with some char siu meat on top, and the standard garnishes. The broth was pretty tasty, but very MSG-laden. I was so thirsty afterwards, and my tongue felt so dry and dehydrated for a long while.   I definitely want to try other ramen places and may come back to this one to order a different ramen, but it's nothing exciting."}
{"text":"I'm a regular customer at Ajisen Ramen and this place is by far the best ramen shop in Toronto.  The place is cozy and there are multiple seatings in the restaurant, so there is a shorter wait time if the place gets really busy (usually on Fridays). Once you step inside, you are automatically greeted by  the friendly staff who will tell you to sit anywhere you would like. They also serve you green tea before you get to order. Upon looking at the menu, there are tons of options to choose from including their  famous Ajisen Ramen and Pork Ramen. In addition to ramen, they also serve fried rice, yakisoba, appetizers, and bubble tea! (It's $3.50 if you order with any meal)   What I like about this place is the fast service, generous portions, and the friendliness of the staff. They also have a rewards program which you earn a stamp for every $10 spent. For every 15 stamps earns you any ramen under $10 for free!   My recommendations at Ajisen is to try the original Ajisen Ramen, along with the Pork, Tomato Pork, Miso Pork, and Scallop Ramen."}
{"text":"I've been gong to this restaurant for a few years now, it was my family's favourite spot since it opened up a spadina franchise. I personally fo there often, enough to have the stamp card, and fill it up quite regularly.  Food: This is probably one of the most addictive ramens in the city. It's salty and savoury and leaves you wanting more. I always spring for the gyoza as well, as one bowl of ramen often isn't enough.  Service: The service here is interesting. First of all, the servers mostly don't speak English as their first language. Sometimes they mix up your order if you have specific details. The great thing is, they're lovely and courteous and will often fix your problem above and beyond what is necessary. They're like the 'serving staff's anime trope: clumsy sometimes, but always willing to give 100% and are super-courteous. Ganbatte.  Overall, a great spot of you want some cheap eats - make sure to have plenty of water, and be very clear with your order."}
{"text":"Nice place to go for a casual ramen fix! It wasn't mind-blowingly amazing, but it made for a decent meal, especially for someone like myself who doesn't eat ramen much."}
{"text":"I love love ramen here. Always pop by anytime I feel cold and need something that soup base. All of the spicy base soup ramen are delicious. You can also order the level of the chili, the level 200 degree was crazily spicy!! The dumpling is nice company for the noodle. Ramen is around $7.00-$11.00. You can order additional stuff for your ramen too. Definitely have to go list for ramen."}
{"text":"They should rename the place to Ajisen Vermicelli. Why? Because that's not ramen that's in those noodle bowls. That is definitely vermicelli. The noodles were the worst part of the dish since vermicelli doesn't absorb flavour or behave the way ramen noodles do. It was just odd.  I had the tom yum bbq pork bowl, and my date had some beef shank bowl. The broth was flavourful, but the bbq pork was far from spectacular, and the shank was aite. Really not worth your time.   Also, I'm still pissed that that was vermicelli. So hilarious though."}
{"text":"I've been going here for years and the service slowly worsened. While i do notice that they are more happy and attentive when the manager is there they are not as excited as they used to be. The food however has always been great. I love their bbq pork ramen as well as the pork cutlet ramen."}
{"text":"I've been hearing about this chain a lot and a quick search on Google revealed to me that there aren't any truly special ramen spots in Markham, so I decided to try this place out on a whim. Walking in I was greeted by a large mannequin of Ajisen's mascot, an interesting addition to the decor of this compact yet spacious restaurant.  I ordered the spicy beef ramen, which was a pretty good portion for the $10 that I was paying. I found the beef to be a bit too lean but the soup and noodles were the write consistency and taste to make a good dish overall. I also tried the gyoza, which was nothing special, but as a whole I was still impressed with the experience that I had and would recommend it to those who haven't tried Ajisen yet."}
{"text":"As I was cruising down Spadina on my way to Caplansky's, I spotted a new store opening and my heart skipped a beat when I saw that it was Aijsen. I have heard of it before but I have never had their ramen. Gleefully, I plotted my plans to return the following week to try this place out. I so desperately wanted it to be better than Kenzo. It wasn't.  Ok, to be fair - the SERVICE is better. They did greet us and was prompt with the delivery of everything (food / water / tea / refills of tea / bill). The menu was more varied (hello APPETIZERS!). The décor was fun and modern (PINK EVERYTHING).   But alas, the broth is too meh for me. I can't even think of anything exciting to write about it in this review. The beef is tasty enough but a bit too chewy. The ramen is slightly better than Kenzo (smoother - does this make sense?) but the overall meal did not warrant a return to this store. Mind you, I liked the tofu (delicate and crispy). But this is a ramen shop not a tofu shop. Maybe I need to return and try the other soup bases before I give up on Aijsen. The problem is, I have about 33 restaurants on my 'To-try' list and if you don't make a good first impression, I just might not return."}
{"text":"Just had ramen here! Delicious! I had the tom yum  ramen with grilled shrimp. The ramen was flavourful and fresh. The shrimp was cooked just right. My companion had the kimchi and chicken ramen, they enjoyed their dish too. The owner was a lovely gentleman who came and asked us if we liked it s few times. We also ordered some edamame and it was overcooked. But overall delicious!"}
{"text":"Ajisan Ramen.  One of the chain ramen shop from Japan.  But honestly I had better.   Came here to have a quick lunch with a friend.  We both ordered the Time Limited Koji Salted Premium Pork Slices Ramen ($8.99) and add Gyoza when you order a ramen for $1.99.    The Gyoza just is very average, not the usual one you get from some Japanese Restaurant where they are deep fried.  The ramen, soup was super salty, maybe is the koji salt??  =/  Can't taste the pork bone soup flavor, was very disappointed.  However the pork slices are pretty good.  That's pretty much the only thing I like about the whole meal.    I will probably won't come back again."}
{"text":"Ajisen Ramen has just opened a new location on Spadina bringing the count to three in the Toronto area. (Yonge, Warden and now Spadina)   It still has that new restaurant smell and was packed to the gills when I went in at lunch. I'm not a big fan of the colour scheme but that might be because I'm not big on hot pink chairs.   The menu is a decent size with a good selection with 37 different types of ramen on tap. I just had the basic pork ramen because I like to start simple with new places. If they can't get the basics right then there is little point to trying out more complex dishes.   The staff were super attentive and polite but I'm chalking that up to the manager hovering over everyone to make sure people were happy and taken care of. I'm pretty sure it just opened this week so I would expect service to be great for a little while at least. I will have to head back here soon to try a few more things on the menu.   The miso was pretty good but it would be great if you could choose your broth like more authentic ramen places. I've had better noodles and for the first few mouthfuls I was wondering if they were actually using spaghetti noodles. The odd butchered/broken Japanese the servers were speaking was a little jarring as well.   For the time being I'm in a bit of a holding pattern. The place has promise but I'm not sold yet."}
{"text":"Reading the other reviews I have to agree that:   1) The ramen is like spaghetti noodles  2) MSG flavor country  The soup is suppose to be miso based but they did have some thai and korean inspired flavors like kim chi and tom yum goong. I ordered beef ramen with their original soup but the soup looked very milky. In terms of the meat portion, it was small and in general so was the portion of the meal. I left unsatisfied in search of more food to feed that hunger of mine. I've come to a conclusion after trying this and Kenzo that there really isn't exceptional ramen in the city. If anyone can prove me wrong please msg me :)"}
{"text":"The food there was quiet appetizing. My Ramen Home. My friends and I always order the Ajisen Ramen, BBQ Onigiri, etc. However, the food fills you up, yet it doesn't. It gives you a nice, warm, fuzzy feeling when you drink the broth.  The noodles and a nice texture and flavor to them. It's a great place to eat if you get past several flaws:  1. Beware of the washroom; it's in the basement, and I doubt they hardly clean it.  2. Pink. Lots and lots of pink...  There are also plentiful of good points about Ajisen:  1. The service is AMAZING! I don't know why people say it's not. My friends and I go there on Fridays, and the Manager always greets us with a smile. He left a deep, positive impression on us when he did magic tricks for us. Yes, magic tricks. Plus, he took our picture to post on their FB page and the gave us this red card to stamp each time we return.  2. The food arrives quickly, despite how busy it is.   3. Amazing broth!!!   4. IT'S CHEAP!!! :D (Well for us highschoolers.)   Yes, I've been to Kenzo since it's straight down from my school, but I prefer Ajisen."}
{"text":"Good ramen. Tasty broth. Pork ribs ever incredibly tender. Fast service. Nice wait staff. :) will come again for a ramen fix."}
{"text":"I usually go to Ajisen Ramen on Warden and Steeles, but since me and my boyfriend were craving ramen and were in spadina, we stopped by.  when almost finishing up my meal, I noticed a very small fly in my soup.... The manger offered to make me a new one, but since I was almost completely done my meal I said no and he cancelled my order. (I order Tom Yum w/ Shrimp + extra noodles)  In the end I will not be returning to this location just because that's nasty.  Very unhygienic and the manger didn't even apologize..."}
{"text":"Buzy during lunch on a weekday but got seated after a few minutes. Had the tender ribs ramen. It was delicious. Taste is unique than other ramen i've tasted. Will come back for more."}
{"text":"This ramen is AMAZING!! I cannot say a single bad word about the food at Ajisen Ramen. Their ramen is amazing. I really like their wide range of appetizers. Super delicious. I would highly recommend this restaurant to evvvvvvvvvvvvveryone!!  I would say it's so much better than Kenzo ramen for those who have made comparisons. Kenzo is tasty too but Ajisen just hits it out of the park!"}
{"text":"Still trying to find a decent ramen place. I come here as a Plan B when I'm bored with a friend. Ramen has always been a gray area in cuisine for me - it's quite expensive for trying to get full, and the taste here is a bit bland, and pricey. There's one called volcano where they just dump the typical Dim Sum spicy oils in for 11 bucks - just for those spoons of spicy oils. I wouldn't recommend coming here if you wanted to have good ramen. It's not bad though, so I will return since I'm in the area."}
{"text":"It's been forever since I reviewed a place and since I've been here more than once, I'm on a ramen craze, and I've had Ajisen in different places I thought it be worth reviewing.  First off, Ajisen is EVERYWHERE! It's in over 10 countries. I've had it many times back home in SoCal and honestly the TO one tastes better. Maybe it has less MSG so it doesn't make you as thirsty. But compared to the one back home they give a lot less noodles. I usually can't finish the noodles back home, but this joint does not give you enough! I'm still hungry by the end of the bowl. However, I am quite particular about the texture of the noodles and I enjoy that Ajisen's is a bit softer. The broth is nothing special, just MSG. The meat is typical to other places that serve pork/tonkotsu ramen and will give three slices of pork with some fat on it.  This place will fill you up (if you order extra noodles or a side) and is just okay enough to satisfy your ramen cravings. Don't expect anything super special. However, I haven't found places in TO with spectacular ramen, but I've had bad ramen. So this place gets 3 stars for truly being \"A-OK\"."}
{"text":"A perfect place to go when you're craving a hot bowl of yummy ramen.  Broth is good and pork is tender.  Service is prompt and courteous."}
{"text":"Food: 3 stars Service: 2 stars Value: 3 stars  I am not sure if I liked this place anymore. When we first came here a few years ago, I loved their ramen. But now, they have raised their price and cut down the portion, it just wasn't that good any more. The most annoying thing was when we ate here at lunch, we always felt rush... The waiter would give us the check even before we finished our food. They didn't refill our tea. All these actions was a silent way of saying \"hurry up, we need your table.\" I just don't like that kind of pressure... Unless I am super craving for ramen, I probably won't go back again."}
{"text":"Can't really say this is ramen.  I know there are different kind of noodles, but their noodle is more like spaghetti.  The broth is bland.  The price is okay.  I prefer paying a bit more to get authentic ramen at the ramen places downtown though.  I wish there were more authentic ramen places in Markham."}
{"text":"We went here on a whim with a group of us.  We all tried different ramen, and we added a few side dishes, such as Agedashi Tofu and Karaage Chicken.  The side dishes were tasty and inexpensive, by Toronto standards.  As for the ramen themselves?  They  were good enough to satisfy the craving.  However, I have had much better elsewhere in the states and Japan, so this is good if I wanted to have a satisfying meal.  It is not a must have bowl of ramen.  The portions were good, and the price was right.  Overall, I would come back for a casual meal if I was in the area and really did not have the urge to go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Came in here only a few times by myself and always during the lunch hour.  They greeted me with \"Irrashaimase!\" as you would normally expect in a regular restaurant in Japan which is great! Service is fast and the waitresses are incredibly nice. I've only ordered the miso BBQ pork ramen which was very flavorful. I also ordered fried potato cakes (croquettes) which comes with mayo, a bit hot when they first serve it to you so it's best to wait a few minutes before biting into one. I would recommend going here when your stomach is empty so you can enjoy a big bowl of delicious ramen to its end."}
{"text":"Perviously had a bad experience with ramen. This place changed my mind about it. Chicken knee popper appetizer was crunchy, chewy and tasty. I had the sliced beef ramen, beef was tender, ramen was good, broth was good. Busy, lots of young people, yet service was prompt."}
{"text":"I came here specifically for the ramen and it was pretty good. I ordered the Ajisen spicy pork ramen. They were very accommodating when I didn't know to what degree of spice I wanted my ramen so the waitress said she would put the spice on the side. The ramen itself was very flavourful and filling. The pork was very tender, however I wish they put in more pieces.   My friend and I also order some apps: seaweed salad, takoyaki balls and the pork rice ball. Those were very disappointing. The seaweed salad tasted very artificial and salty. The takoyaki balls were small and mainly all batter - no surprise there. The pork rice ball was the worst. The seaweed that wraps around the ball didn't even wrap all around! Pork? Abysmal. I found one small piece of pork, the size of a kernel corn. It was basically all rice and a bit of soy sauce.   Overall, the ramen was a delicious bowl that hit the spot. No more apps for me though."}
{"text":"Since I have never had authentic ramen, I cannot judge its authenticity. But I do like this place more than Kenzo for both the selection and lack of obnoxiousness (the staff aren't really friendly either, but passable). Every time I come here I order one of the pork based soup ramens and I really love it!"}
{"text":"A place you can have all kinds of asian food. They have everything not everything is not perfect or impressive. When a group of people have different preferences, a place to go."}
{"text":"It was disgusting...I had a teppen-yaki chick ramen for take out, and it looks like they have \"recycled\" the chicken with other people's left over in my take out as it contained rices and other stuff.  I took a picture and wrote a compliant note/with pic to their FB Fan page (Ajisen Ramen Canada) but no answers.  Will not go back again and I don't know how they pass the food safety inspection."}
{"text":"Amazing place for your ramen fix and more.. try the shrimp tempura sushi (put wasabi in your soy) and beef tenderloin before chowing down on great spicy ramen.  Lots of great memories here on pink couches"}
{"text":"Though it only got 3.5 stars here, this place scored 4.0 stars over 386 Google reviews.  I've been to Sonoya at First Markham and Sansotei near Highway 7 and Birchmount before so I have experience with ramen.  When we were there on a Friday night, there were 3 couples ahead of us, but the wait was not too long. They gave us a number on a piece of paper but I' not sure that was necessary.  We ordered an Ajisen octopus seaweed salad off the appetizer menu. We didn't know that is what it was as there was little description on the menu and my wife did not ask what it was we were ordering. At $7.99, it was good but not worth the money. I was thinking for $4.99 It would have been okay. It was just cold octopus in an average red sauce, a B-. The seaweed salad was a B+.  The fried tofu in soy sauce was good with a crispy layer on the outside, a B. I knew how it was going to taste and knew it would be only so good, but we picked it anyway.  The star of the evening was the Ajisen ramen noodle bowl. The noodles were on the hard side or al dente. I didn't mind, though I would have slightly liked it a little softer and any harder I would dislike. So if you like soft noodles, maybe you should inform them of this. I don't remember having bad ramen and this place is just as good as the other two, though Sansotei had a rushed vibe as it might have been in demand because it was new, so I like the atmosphere here better.  So overall, I wasn't good blown away but it is pretty good ramen near where I live.  3.5 stars"}
{"text":"If you compare to the Ramen you make with ' just add water and microwave', Ajisen isn't bad.  If you don't want more than spaghetti noodle (yes Italian spaghetti) in grocery store broth, generic seasoning, and a spoon full of meat/veggies...Go to Ajisen for a cheap meal ($10 will get you more carbs than McDs).   Vegetarian option (for wifey) was weak, but the only notable veggie Ramen I could find.  I recommend the veggies stick to Pho...you can't fake Ramen.  I had the pork Ramen and spicy chicken wings.  Chicken wings were plain, small and 'spiced' with *continental Thai chilli sauce...and my Ramen was barely worth the $9.  You can do a lot better in that neighbourhood for $10."}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed the first time but we just went again and it was yummy! The place look renovated and new items were added to the menu. I had the tom yum BBQ pork ramen! Spicy & delicious. My bf had the the other spicy pork ramen 100 spice level and the broth was phenomenal! Not that much meat but you can other more on the side. My favourite ramen place is still Kenzo on Yonge near steeles. It's not part of the Kenzo chain (near Shepard & downtown). There's parking in the back so check it out if you can! The portions are huge, broth tasty and you get lots of meat, sides, etc..."}
{"text":"The food is always good. However, their waiting system is horrible. We were a table for two and several others got seated before us and we were told we didn't need a number. The owner then tried to seat someone who came in after us before us. The wait staff is great but the owner/manager is really bad."}
{"text":"Inexpensive, filling and flavourful. Staff were very friendly, efficient and food came fast! I ordered the tom yum beef teppanyaki ramen ($8.99). Also got an order of pan fried gyoza ($1.99/3pcs) at a lunch special price available only from 11am to 3 or 4pm.  My soup was delicious and had just the right amount of heat. Other ramen places I have been to had really thick soup that seemed more like a sauce, whereas this one was more like actual soup; it wasn't too greasy or salty either. Each table also came with a set of shakers that included chili powder, fried garlic and gyoza sauce for you to garnish your own dish with.   Overall, clean space, good lighting and seats are bright pink! I've been here before and service has always been very friendly and accomodating -- a definite bonus on top of the food coming quickly!"}
{"text":"I'd like to actually give this place a 3.5/5, but since I can't, I'll up it to a 4/5 because I am in love with 2 items on their menu. More details to follow below:  The ramen: 3/5 (for most of their ramen), 4.5/5 (for the pork ramen + fried chicken on the side). I've been here a couple times and this place is really hit or miss with their different kinds of ramen. Ive tried various types of ramen, from their specials to the regular items, and their spicy ones to the ramen with the meat served on the side... but I only really like 2 items: the pork ramen with deep fried chicken appetizer on the side. Their pork ramen (not bbq pork) is full of thinly sliced pieces of pork that is portioned well with the amount of noodles in the bowl. I found that the other types of ramen they served had too little meat to last me till the end of my bowl. The fried chicken is done with a smooth batter and is very juicy! Also, I like that's its served with mayo as some ramen places don't offer that :(   Cost: 4/5 - cheap. Nothing more to say, average for ramen, cheaper than places like santouka.  Service: 4/5 - decent service here. No complaints. Had a waitress once that couldn't speak much english, but on average they got the job done.  Ambience: 3.5/5 - I personally dont understand the pink seating... and the leather they have for the seating becomes dry and cracked, so on some seats you'll see duct tape as an attempt to patch it up, alittle sketch and takes away from the experience. Other than that, mirrors and decor are decent. Not bad after you get over the duct tape you are sitting on... lastly I've never seen this place full, which takes away from the experience imo. It's always nice to see a restaurant operating at close to if not 100% capacity because you also feed off the successful energy of the business and it reduces the awkwardness of having staff just sitting or standing around while you eat =/  Overall I come here for nothing else other than the pork ramen and a side of their fried chicken because I am tired of playing of the hit and miss game with their menu."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is good, the prices are helpful for your wallet and it's pretty filling. I go for lunch with a few office friends and the manager at this location is very friendly. Some of the staff have trouble understanding you sometimes, but just be patient with them.   RECOMMENDED RAMEN/SOUP: Spicy Pork Miso, Steak Teppanyaki, Spicy Filet Mignon  Their curry bowls are also decent and come with a small cup of soup and a side. Good amount for the price!"}
{"text":"Yes it's junk food. So are other ramen places. I can care less the egg comes in a can. They have the best (most flavorful) ramen broth I've ever had. Don't brother with other dishes other than ramen, all else tastes like rubber. I try to limit my consumption of junk as it usually make me feel awful after. Bottom line: the flavor of a bowl of ramen here beats any super expensive places run by Japanese. Service is super fast. I can get in and out of there in 30 minutes. Love that!"}
{"text":"I have tried Ramens and Tepannyakis, can't complain. And once tried the fish cake or something along that line, wasn't impressed. Good service and nice location."}
{"text":"I think Ajisen Rame is the BEST I've ever eaten in Toronto. I had the BBQ Pork Ramen. The soup was rich and not sailty, and BBQ Pork was sooooo yummy!! It's like a real Japanese Ramen! The food always comes fast, it's about 3~4 min!! Also price and location are good.  If you want to eat a good ramen, I really recomend Ajisen Ramen. I wanna go there again and try another Ramen!"}
{"text":"First of all, is this really ramen???  The noodles looked and tasted like spaghetti. I ordered the tenderous ribs ramen.  I got 4 small pieces of ribs, which had more fat than meat, a handful of bean sprouts, spaghetti, and some green bits that I couldn't identify. That was pretty much it. Not much flavour in the broth, at least nothing memorable.  My bf's tomato and chicken ramen was even sadder. This was our first time at Ajisen, and based on our first meal, I don't think we'll be coming back for seconds."}
{"text":"wjen i dont feel like going north to kenzo ramen, i come here to get some japanese style ramen. i think the place is run by chinese so its  of very authentic but they have a wide choice to choose from, good friendly and fast service."}
{"text":"Was not expecting such great customer service, would come back for sure since I had such a lovely experience. They didn't look like they hated life when I went, they seemed content, albeit maybe a little bored; I went during late afternoon so it wasn't very busy. The manager was really friendly and smiley, he made me want to come back.  I ordered the deep fried shrimp ramen. Shrimp was delicious as was the ramen was average, however the broth was just warm and I prefer my broth hot! There was quite a lot on the menu but would love to see more meatless options (I think there's only one or two for any vegetarians out there).   Decor was nice and the bathroom was clean. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I don't tihnk Ajisen Ramen is particularly authentic, but the spaghetti was really good.  I found it strange that they used spaghetti noodles, but didn't mind.  If you look at it from the point of view of a spaghetti lover, their Tom Yum noodle soup gets a win.  What doesn't get a win, is the claim on Ajisen's website that their food is healthy.  It should go without saying that there is nothing healthy about eating a bowl of spaghetti in broth made of pork bone, MSG and spices."}
{"text":"their service is awesome! we didn't need to wait food coming:) Servers are so friendly. the taste of ramen was like real Japanese !! Of course I'll come there again."}
{"text":"They once served me food that was so stale it smelled like a trip to the hospital. I looked at it and smelled it, didn't even complain. I just put $20 on the table and left without tasting anything. I frequent ramen, pho etc. This smell was like rotten food in my ramen. The egg looked like it had been sitting out for days. Disgusting."}
{"text":"I've been to Ajisen Ramen locations on Hong Kong and Shanghai so I'm familiar with their menu - what's good, what's not and I can tell when something isn't made particularly well. I was quite excited when I heard that a few of these restaurants had opened in Toronto.  Some of my favourite items on their menu are the Ajisen Ramen, Chicken & Tomato Ramen, Pork Cutlet (tonkatsu) Ramen and the Beef Wrapped Enoki Mushroom Rolls. Their ramen broths are very tasty - there's obviously MSG in it but it's not excessive. I'm quite sensitive to MSG (dry mouth, insomnia) but I don't have any problems from eating here. I've had their eel and rice box before but the eel wasn't fresh and was very \"fishy.\"  My overall impression of this location is that it's so-so. The place hasn't been open for very long but it's not aging well. The vinyl benches are torn, the menus are filthy, furniture is chipped and the tables feel sticky (i.e. they are not very clean). The food quality is passable - the noodles are a bit mushy and they've changed all of the dishes that contain cabbage to bean sprouts. The beef-enoki rolls are mushy (they should be a bit crispy) and served with too much sauce (and decorated with mustard on the side o_0\").   Does this location measure up to it's Asian counterpoints - nope."}
{"text":"Amazing consistent food for the price.  Huge bowl of ramen noodles under 9$.  Try the potatoe deep fried side dish mmm Great in the winter.  Open late"}
{"text":"Came here with my mom and brother for dinner. Service was very friendly and very fast! A little too fast at first. The manager was working and he took our order, he seemed to be in a rush and was eager to take our order down quickly so he can continue working, I was scared he was gonna leave before I could order additional gyozas. That wasn't really a big issue though, he was still very kind to us. I ordered the Miso BBQ Pork ramen, it was a little too salty but I added in a crap load of chilli powder and fried garlic bits that they set on the table for you so it wasnt too bad afterwards. My mom got the Tenderous Rib Ramen and my brother got the Ajisen Spicy pork ramen, I tried both of their broths and theirs were fine. The portions are fantastic for the price that you pay, very reasonable. The gyozas I ordered were also delish! Juicy and plump with lots of flavour along side a vinagrette-type dipping sauce. I find this place to be a generic ramen joint, nothing special but it is a good place to go if you're ever craving ramen. They have more options than if you were to go somewhere like Kinton or Kenzo! Thumbs up from me :)"}
{"text":"This is definitely my favourite ramen place. There's just so many options- seafood & vegetarian included. Service is great, ramen is great, and the location is convenient too. I like this location cause it's in a mall and after my ramen I can get ice cream (Wooffles & Cream).  Ajisen never disappoints me. follow me on ig for more reviews: @gta.eatss"}
{"text":"I came to Ajisen Ramen on New year's 2018 with a group of four. The location was unexpectedly small with people standing in the doorway holding the door open while waiting for seats to open up. Understandable, but slightly annoying. However this could be forgiven as a result of the flavourful and rich tasting ramen I recieved. I ordered the spicy beef ramen with a vegetable base instead of the normal pork based broth.  Another annoyance was that one member of my group's order was forgotten and came after everyone had already finished  their meal. Soon after it arrived we realized that her order was wrong and they had to quickly remake it. This was somewhat forgiven because we did receive free pops on the house. The manager was very friendly, however a few members of his staff could learn from his joyous personality.  Overall it wasn't a completely bad experience. I would rate this location higher if many of the negative experiences that we encountered never occurred.   I will re-state this though, my ramen tasted very delicious."}
{"text":"I go to this place nearly 3 times a month (or more if there's an opportunity). Its by far one of my fave places to eat in the city. The manager at the Spadina location is the sweetest man too! He always treats me and whoever im with like we are moviestars. Plus the food is always 100% :D"}
{"text":"Me and a friend found the service and decor to be more than acceptable, but what I really liked was the food! The ramen was about average, but the pork inside of it was super! If you're ever in Chinatown I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Good, fast service. Tea refills without having to ask. Menu is large but served very quickly. Clean. Try the filet mignon ramen. Mmmmm."}
{"text":"Awesome ramen! My favourite is the curry lamb ramen. There's an extensive selection of starter dishes too, the gyoza is delicious. Great value!   Update 2017-12-29 They are still delicious! They have a menu of rice dishes now. But really if you go to a ramen house for a meal, why would you order rice?!  Anyways, their Steak Ramen, Pork Ramen classic and Pork Shoyu ramen are excellent!"}
{"text":"We were on vacation in Toronto and were happy to see Ajisen Ramen on Spadina in Chinatown.  Ajisen Ramen is walking distance from our hotel on King Stree.  We are huge fan of Ajisen and when we saw the Ajisen doll on the street we had to stop and try it.  I had the tender pork rib ramen and it was so good.  The tender pork rib was so \"tender\" and the soup was rich and not salty.  Wife also loved her miso ramen with BBQ pork.  They were as good as the ones in California and Japan.  It was so good we had both lunch and dinner at Ajisen."}
{"text":"Ajisen Ramen is an okay place to eat. I wouldn't call it amazing but it is pretty good and has a wide variety of ramen, curry and other japanese cuisine. It's also very well priced for the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"Ajisen Ramen has been my go-to place for quick, delicious food whenever I'm downtown and craving something easy.  They provide quality food and exceptional service for next to nothing. As soon as you step through the door you are greeted with a loud hello from everyone serving and at the register. You're seated right then and a waiter brings you tea, water and menus. The tea is yummy and is nice to have when figuring out what to order.  Ajisen has a wide selection with many different traditional Japanese soups, meats and sides. My favourite ramen is the Koji Salt Chicken... I believe it's number 19 on the menu.  The food arrives in less than 5 minutes and tastes like heaven.   The staff are always energetic and seem happy to be there. The manager (who I believe is the owner) is very social and enjoys talking with the customers. He frequently takes pictures of them enjoying their food and posts them on the restaurant's Facebook page.  Overall, an awesome little ramen place right in Chinatown. Great service, great food, great atmosphere. Definitely recommend to anyone in the area or passing by."}
{"text":"I come here about once every two weeks. The food is delicious however,  half the menu is \"discontinued\" which is disappointing.   I have tried the other 2 locations, I must say they are pretty disgusting comparing to this on. I usually go for lunch, service is alright. My favourite server is Abby, she's super adorable, has the greatest smile every time. Going for lunch, they have the appetizer specials, which are only $1.50. The potato cakes are a must try, crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. For the Ramen, I always get the pork cutlet ramen, changing the broth to Tom yum broth for only $1. Totally worth it. The ravens average around $8.99. They also have bubble tea, their bubble teas are surprisingly good. It's average, it can be a lot worst.   Overall, I recommend this location of Ajisen Ramen to anyone and everyone.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Salty but good. Often go back when i feel like Ramen.  can not compare to real japanese ramen, but good enough."}
{"text":"Oh gosh, the inflow of sodium ions that immediately entered my system as I ate the noodles. Mind you, I made a point not to drink the soup; the noodles had already soaked up a ton of salt from the briny soup.   We went there on a Friday night, and the small restaurant was almost full of people eating away at their bowls of ramen. We made our orders: tom yum beef, seafood, and chicken ramen. Each bowl was priced roughly $8-9. Two men arrived soon after and received their orders within 5 minutes.   We received ours after 25 minutes, as the two men next to us wiped their mouths and prepared to pay. Oh well, we thought, maybe they didn't have enough chefs here.   Then came the first taste, and we knew coming here was a bad idea.   All of us agreed that Ajisen Ramen puts way too much salt in their otherwise flavourless food. I was fortunate enough to have some spices in my tom yum beef bowl for some additional flavouring, but my colleagues were less fortunate.   What's more, the beef was difficult to chew, and the amount of seafood would satisfy approximately 30% of my colleague's appetite.   I did like the textures of the noodles, but considering the lack of taste, miniscule portion size, and long wait, I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Ajisen is ideal for late night ramen runs, but if your tummy is telling you it can wait, then I suggest you treat it to something nicer the next day.   I've been here a couple of times, and it's always empty. The ramen I've tried all had extremely salty soup base, I had to water it down. The ramen was cooked nice and chewy. As for the pork.... well, you can tell by the toughness that it was probably frozen before.   Unless you live in the area, I see no reason for you to trek down here (and find street parking) for \"Meh\" ramen."}
{"text":"Ehhh...not a big fan of this place.   After going to Sansotei, another popular ramen joint, I was excited to try this place as I am a ramen fanatic! However, I left feeling fairly unsettled but don't get me wrong, it was still super tasty!   First off, the egg in my ramen was hard boiled instead of soft which was disappointing. I ordered the Shoyu Pork ramen and got multiple slices pork. However, they were all poorly sliced and tasted dry times. The soup base wasn't that salty and it had a good balance.   Also ordered a bubble tea for $3.5 but the tapioca was super hard and I think they used green instead of the usual black tea so it tasted a bit watery. She told me I had to wait 20 minutes for her to brew a new pot of black tea but she came back fast and yah think she gave me green but oh well. My friends also ordered it before the black tea ran out and theirs tasted much better.   Overall, the biggest pro was that my tongue wasn't itchy after meaning there wasn't that much salt or MSG. Flavour wise, I would say Sansotei is better just based on quality of pork slices and egg. However, the soup base here is more sustainable (Sansotei is SO salty) and probably healthier.   This place also has slightly bigger portions and cheaper prices."}
{"text":"I've been here three times, and would have gladly awarded Ajisen 3 stars for my first two ramen experiences (mixed vegetable the first time, beef the second), but I have quite a few gripes about my most recent visit.   I came in with my boyfriend, and we both ordered deep fried chicken ramen. My ramen arrived quickly, but without chicken. I asked about the chicken a few minutes later, and was told that it would be out soon (it came out 6 minutes after my ramen). This is not acceptable. The dish should be served all at once, not in halves- the chicken and the bowl of noodle soup are equally important components of the same dish. I was not pleased to find that my noodles had softened significantly by the time the other half of my lunch arrived.  My chicken arrived, but my boyfriend's meal did not (not even half of it!). 3 minutes went by. 5 minutes. 10 minutes after my chicken, and he finally asked the waitress what was going on with his meal. Visibly confused, she said \"oh, you ordered two ramen?\" It took another 7 minutes or so before they corrected the mistake and served him his food (all at once, thankfully).  I realize that mistakes can happen, but the restaurant was barely half full, and there were plenty of servers to manage the workload. One person sitting with their meal, while the other glances around hungrily, should at least alert someone to come by and ask if everything is okay- but strangely, no one noticed that anything was amiss until we complained.   To top it all off, the deep fried chicken was very unpleasant, filled with grisly, chewy chunks of fat and sinew. The broth was thick and fragrant, but far too salty, and the noodles would have been delicious if I was not forced to wait and let them overcook. I will not be back."}
{"text":"Been here twice with my girlfriend, we both love Ramen. Don't think I will be back here again as both times we have been here, an order of ours gets to our table stone cold.   The first time we had been here, our tea order was freezing cold. The second time, we had ordered spring rolls which were cold and looked as if it had been sitting out for a while as it was really greasy.   The waitresses are not attentive and just stand at the back. You have to stare or waive one down in order to be served.   We ordered the Japanese fried chicken as well which was good. We then ordered the volcano Ramen, which the broth tastes too powdery for my liking."}
{"text":"Love the food and service is fast My fave is curry beef ramen    They're very nice. Sometimes gets packed so avoid busy hours"}
{"text":"I think of Ajisen as the de facto ramen restaurant. It's like, the McDonald's of Ramen...it's always fast and consistently tasty, but I can't put my finger on what makes it taste so good.  And every once in awhile, I just find myself craving it.  I find Ajisen to be good value for money, and their broth is really tasty and consistent. They have a huge variety of flavours and meats you can get in the ramen, so the food never gets boring, but there is always that yummy broth base.  My favs are Tenderous Ribs Ramen (when I'm splurging) or just the regular old pork ramen, but I also like the curry ones for a different flavour, or the veggie one with corn for a slightly sweeter ramen.  It's also fun to put wagers on the degrees of spiciness that your dining partners can withstand and then watching them sweat as they try to finish a bowl of 200 degree spice.  This particular location of Ajisen is quite big, but the benches and furniture have been getting worn down over time so it's looking a little grungy these days.  Other than that, I never have complaints about this Ajisen, including the service or the food."}
{"text":"Good variety, and the non-ramen dishes are pretty good too....  But I would still say it's just OK.  Which means, I don't crave this place, but it's a good late night option.  The broth can be a bit salty...and it's really far from true Japanese pork bone broth.  But, it's still okay!"}
{"text":"Love coming here with the boyfriend when we get a ramen craving. It's convenient since it's nearby! This place isn't that large and usually busy but when the owner is there we get seated quite quickly. He doesn't talk much but is very nice and sometimes we get free appetizers or he comes and asks us how we're doing. I always have a good experience when he's there. When he's not there I find the lines move a little bit slower but we still enjoy the food. The quality is always consistent and delicious. Very good price for some filling food. We also have a stamp card since we come here enough to get a free bowl of ramen. The owner let us use it on the current bill instead of making us come back to redeem it. Heck yeah!  They have lots of different choices for ramen. Some are spicy and some aren't. The broth is always flavourful and delicious. It gets cooked quite quickly! They also offer some Rice dishes if you're not in the mood for ramen for whatever reason (you weirdo). They do have a delicious curry with rice dish which I really enjoyed. You can also call in to pick up an order. I've called and placed an order on my way and it would be ready when I arrived. Very convenient!  I've come quite a few times over the year and only expect to visit as often as possible."}
{"text":"So we've been to this franchise before in other states, and we found this in the heart of downtown Chinatown in Toronto.  Some days you just need some spicy ramen, it's comfort food!  I can deal with spicy pretty well!  Choosing 100 degrees was a bit much for me, whoa! \"Sumimasen, omizu okudosai!\"  Whooooo my introductory Japanese class came in handy!  Food was great! Manager/owner, you could tell this dude has been around the block a few times, he rocked! Great job bro! But...what absolutely kills the review is that he unfortunately hires two Japanese girls who DO NOT SPEAK ENGLISH!!' FAIL!  Could not understand us, we could not understand them!  Bubble tea!! Ok you want tapioca?.....uh! The tapioca IS the bubbles, asked me if I wanted black or green tea, I said two times, original milk bubble tea...ok just bring me anything, just go do something or bring me someone who can communicate.    How they can hire Japanese servers who don't speak English is beyond me!  And they are in Chinatown, well they don't speak Chinese either!! Anyhow, the manager had to take care of half the entire experience.  Dude! It's Chinatown in downtown Toronto, I'm sure there are more waitress' than cops! Hire some who speak English!"}
{"text":"If tacky could bleed, it would bleed pink.  I can't even remember who convinced me to try this place, there's a huge Chinese porcelain statue of a girl wearing a Japanese apron holding a bowl of soup, that's not very Japanese?  All of the chairs were in pink vinyl, which has nothing to do with Japan.  It's not like they call it The Land of the Rising Flamingos.  There are traditional style sumos painted onto the walls, and a dish display that reminds me of those vendor games where you throw a ball to knock the plates down.   The servers looked Japanese, but of course when I say 'looked' Japanese I'm only referring to their height.  I couldn't understand what I was looking at when I opened the menu, I'm not a ramen kind of guy.  There was a photo of a dish where it was very obviously octopus covered in melted cheese, but I asked the waitress what it was just to make sure.   \"Excuse me, what is this?\"  Pointing to the photo of the cheese octopus. \"Uhh....I..I don't know.\"  The waitress replied. I looked at her, she looked back at me, then she looked at my friend, then she looked back at me, and I looked at my friend who looked at me, then I looked back at the waitress who was still looking at me.  We all fake smiled at the same time. \"I'll have that\"  I said. I also ordered a bowl of ramen.  I didn't like the food, I'm sure it wasn't very authentic.  The cheese octopus was horrible.  Did I mention that the furniture was all in hot pink?   Japanese food is difficult enough to figure out on it's own, but when the wait staff don't even know what it is, I think maybe the chef should take it easy and humble his menu.    I should of said to the waitress when she brought me the bill.  \"What is this?\"   Who knows, maybe I would have gotten lucky."}
{"text":"Moar noodlez plz.  Seriously, this place is pretty damn good when you want a hot meal and some flavour to boot. Don't recommend this during the summer as the heat outside doesn't go well with the hot soup.  During the winter I normally have the lamb ramen. Also recommend the fried chicken curry or their chicken karaage.  Also be wary, they flavour the food pretty heavily with what I think is artificial flavouring so it can make you very thirsty afterwards.  Mandarin speaking establishment. Don't touch their mannequin outside, she's feisty."}
{"text":"Once in a blue moon my mom wants to venture out and have something different for our weekly Saturday lunch date.  This past Saturday she choose Ramen.   I've eaten at ajisen once before at their Chinatown location years ago and was not too impressed with the place but we decided to give the new location a try.   There has been such a sprawl of authentic Ramen spots in Toronto it's at times hard to keep track.  I for one don't have Ramen often so am not an expert but can say the broth bowls that come out of here are not truly authentic but have a bit of an HK flare.  The broth is a touch on the salty side, it misses the complex dimension authentic Ramen has but is still quite good, I ordered the spicy pork Ramen in level 25 (lowest) and it was pretty spicy.  The noodles aren't as dainty or delicate as I've had elsewhere (I'm not really sure how they're suppose to be) and have a similar texture to spaghetti.    If your in a pinch and craving some broth noodles then this is a great option, however, if you're looking for authentic Japanese Ramen you might need to look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Ramen wasnt great, it took less than 3 min for me to receive my order, makes me think if it was fresh or a leftover they happen to have. Shrimp tempera was overly fried, felt like I was trying to bite off a piece of rock. The service wasn't great either, very unhelpful and felt like I was being rushed to order. Overall a very bad experience."}
{"text":"They make the most amazing tum yum steak ramen. I have literally driven from Brampton to Markham to eat it! Hands down the best ramen place in Toronto."}
{"text":"Opens late | fast hearty food | free wifi | Not authentic Japanese ramen | MSG | seasonal menus available   Ajisen ramen is opened by Chinese people but their ramen to most are good. I am highly sensitive to MSG and everyone I eat at their restaurant I feel it. Nonetheless, it's a decent affordable meal if you're craving for some noodles. They have multiple locations and all their locations give me the same MSG feeling.  They have snacks, bubble tea, ramen noodle soup, rice dishes, etc. They also have a stamp card available where you get a stamp per $10 spent. Upon collecting 15 stamps you get one house special ramen for free.  They often have seasonal menu items that keeps us on our toes.  Their other locations include Markham (on Warden), Toronto (on Spadina) and North York (on Yonge)."}
{"text":"I wouldnt bash Ajisen's ramen even though its not particularly that good. Reason is I love that garlic powder stuff you get as a condiment which I cant seem to find anywhere. Its also inexpensive and it fills you up. They have many kinds of ramen but they all taste the same. this place is just OK and is definitely better than those chinese noodle soups from food courts in the chinese malls. Hows that for a comparison.   If you want a more decent ramen, go to Kenzo"}
{"text":"Being a Ramen lover I decided to check out Ajisen Ramen to see how it compares between my homemade concoctions and Kenzo. I've only been to Ajisen once so take my review as first impressions.   The decor is simple and comfortable with enough room to handle the office lunch crowd. Upon my arrival I was instantly greeted by what appeared to be the manager and quickly ushered into a seat. The menu contains a large assortment of Ramen style soups making choosing just one a difficult task. I went with something spicy.   The food came relatively quick and I had my first opportunity to taste how Ajisen's Ramen fares against the competition. All in all it was OK. Not great but not bad. It seemed to lack the quality I found at Kenzo. I inquired to the manager who was hovering close by as to whether the soup and noodles were made in house. He told me that it was all imported from Japan. Now, you'd think this would add a bit of authentic flair to their Ramen dishes but I am reminded that those one dollar Ramen noodle packages you find in corner stores also come from Japan. Really, nothing compares to fresh made Ramen and in fact is more in tune with the art of Ramen made in generations old Ramen houses in Japan, even if the restaurant is in North America.   The prices are reasonable, good to get a Ramen fix on a budget. But if you are going out specifically for Ramen I suggest checking out other places that make everything fresh in house."}
{"text":"The restaurant maximizes on space and has a lot of seating but we still had to wait about 10 minutes before getting a table. We ordered a pork ramen to share, spring rolls and toasted black sesame ice cream. The ramen was very comforting and filling. The black sesame ice cream had so many layers of flavours; it was so unique and fun to eat. The spring rolls were a little greasy and I would not order those again. This restaurant is definitely worth a stop while in Chinatown."}
{"text":"Upsides: - Yummy ramen in general with lots of different options! I don't know when I'll find the time to try everything on the menu. A whole page with different appetizers (I want to try them all)  - The broth is super rich and yummy - I enjoyed my miso BBQ pork ramen with spiciness added to it.  - Open late!!! There are times when I crave noodles and most of the ramen joints are closed so this is the place to go to   Downsides:  - Service. I mention this time and time again how important service is to maintaining good customer relations with the business - my fingers hurt having to type this in a lot of my reviews. But I guess it's hard for some people to show a personality they're not familiar with.  I came here with 5 other people, and I'm not sure if seeing a group made the servers upset, but they seemed upset LOL. The server had been sweeping the floor as we walked by and she just randomly let go of her broom, almost hitting me with no apology. It was also hard for us to get their attention the entire time although we sat right in front of the register.  - Parking: it's located right on the busy street of Yonge so brace yourselves tryna find a spot!! But at least there's free parking after 9pm if you get late night cravings (and not as many cars depending on what day it is)"}
{"text":"This was the second time I've been to Ajisen Ramen.  The first time I went, I thought that the ramen was quite good.  This time, I ordered the EXACT same dish, and it was terrible!  The broth tasted like water!  I'm not sure why there is so much inconsistency with how the dish is made.  The broth was very very bland, and I ended up eating some of my boyfriends ramen instead, because it tasted a lot better than mine.  I left the restaurant without having my ramen craving satisfied.  Don't think I will go back again."}
{"text":"Went here my friends and it was nothing spectacular. The portions are kind of small and the broth wasn't too great. I ordered the ramen with lamb pieces and it just wasn't something I would eat again. The wait for tables took a long time as well and the food took a while.   I would probably come back here to try something new, but from my experience I don't think it is the holy grail of ramen like others say!"}
{"text":"I had the BBQ pork ramen which was pretty basic.  Ramen was okay....noodles didn't feel like ramen noodles and the broth felt too strongly flavoured. Meat slices were a bit small and the egg was hardboiled.  Service was pretty good. Was during lunch so they gave the bills out first and you paid while you eat. Food came out pretty quickly too."}
{"text":"This is the best ramen in toronto!! The steak is heavenly, i highly recommend this place for anyone"}
{"text":"I've been here many times since their opening. It doesn't taste as authentic as other places in the area, especially their onsen tamago (bland), but there aren't that many alternative ramen shops to choose from in the first place.  Fried oysters and noodles are fine, but the broth is very salty most of the time. I end up needing to drink lots of water an hour after the meal.   The place is pretty busy with little room to wait for a seat. You'll have to try a few times in order to get a waiter to your table."}
{"text":"I like the variety of options this place has. Other ramen joints around town only have their staple and don't really change it up."}
{"text":"This place is okay if you're used to mediocre ramen. I'm too used to the other ramen places to appreciate this place. Soup is nothing special and the noodles were a bit too hard. There is however a lot more variety compared to other ramen places. I had the spicy pork ramen in 150 degree. It was a bit spicy but manageable. The pork though was a bit rough. My parents both had the spicy miso...I liked their soup a bit more. The owner is super sweet and walked us out and asked us if the food was okay. I feel almost a bit bad writing negative things, but Im not a fan :("}
{"text":"A friend of mine introduced me to Ajisen Ramen in Willowdale almost two years ago, and I've been going back during cold weathered days with different people every time, and they all have enjoyed it.  My favourite ramen is the Pure Miso Veggie Tofu Ramen, it's filling and delicious. Getting a side of fried shrimp is always a good idea too. I haven't explored other options on the menu though, cause I always seem to be craving the same thing.  The staff is always really friendly, and come by regularly to fill up your glass of water or tea.  A few tips when visiting:   1) Don't sit in the booths, they're not stable and you can feel when the other person moves in the booth behind you.  2) Don't sit close to the door, especially when it's freezing cold outside.  3) Leave your coat and scarf in the car if you can, because your clothes are going to smell like fried food."}
{"text":"I wouldn't go to Ajisen Ramen for authentic ramen noodles nor to be smothered in niceties by the staff (especially around closing time, yeesh) but service is fast and the BROTH..mmmmmm  Favorites include the tom yum ramen and the tenderous pork ramen. noodles, whatever kind they might be, are nicely al dente.   A good go-to when i need hot food, fast."}
{"text":"This is my first ramen experience and I enjoyed both the food and great service. The waitresses really attend to you, no matter how busy they are. They give you a lot of options to chose from the menu. In conclusion,this is one of my favorite late night spots to eat. Done know"}
{"text":"Decent place to satisfy ramen cravings if the other ramen places are far from you. Tasty ramens but small portions. Had their chicken katsu ramen and was kinda disappointed since there wasn't a lot of cutlets. The owner is very friendly although he is very rarely seen."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of spicy Asian food and Ajisen's Spicy Pork Ramen did not disappoint!  This is my second time ordering their 200% Spicy scale Ramen and again it was absolutely awesome!  I was crying by the end and loving every minute of it!  When they say \"200% Spicy\", they really mean it!  This is one of the only places that actually served me nicely spicy food in Toronto since I came back 6 months ago (most take one look at me and think \"this guy can't possibly really mean SPICY\") :P  I am definitely coming back here for other dishes and would highly recommend it to anybody!"}
{"text":"Good variety of ramen, and a deep broth.  Not complex, but definitely flavourful enough for the ramen & meat itself.  With so many ramen places though, I'm inclined to try others before returning."}
{"text":"Les sièges sont rooooses, tous roooses. Non mais mis à part ce détail plus que flashy, Ajisen Ramen propose une grande variété de Ramen, soupes traditionelles japonaises.  Service rapide et courtois.  Pinnnnk, the seats are all pinnnk here. No seriously besides that tiny colored notice, Ajisen Ramen is a restaurant specialised in Ramen, traditional japanese soup. Staff is nice and quick."}
{"text":"Aijen ramen  A very popular franchise of Japanese style ramen.  I most say this is not the first Ajisen ramen that I have been to. The first time I went to one it was quite a pleasant experience. However each time I goto any aijen ramen it gets more disappointing. This may be the last time I goto Ajisen and it may possibly be just a personal thing.  First off I found this place extremely crowded and cramped. We sat at a 2 person table for the 2 of us and it felt like we were sitting at the same table as the ppl beside us. I'm not a bug guy to begin with, but I wonder if a larger person comes in how would they possibly eat comfortably. It's not just the seating area that's crowded. When going to use he bathroom; the corridor that separated the bathroom and the dining area was so tiny that a lady can open a door and smack me right on the back. It didn't hurt that bad, but it was enough to make you go \"are you serious!!??\"  The food wasn't all that impressive either, I ordered the ribs ramen and the broth didn't have much taste. When I tried my gf's broth it tasted much better. So ditched my bowl and ordered exactly the same thing as she did. It came out tasting completely different. How can the exact same thing taste so different?!   It can be just my luck but I don't see myself visiting Ajisen anytime soon."}
{"text":"This restaurant is nearby within my vicinity, so I'm here quite often. I don't particularly care if this place isn't real authentic Japanese ramen. I like that this franchise offers meal sets, which are of good value. I've tried some of their ramen, too, and it's decent. I'm sorta indifferent towards ramen, as I feel all ramen bowls (wherever restaurant I go) tastes the same to me. I guess it depends on the soup base and toppings. At Ajisen, the pork slices are tender enough and juicy to my liking. I can't say much about the soup base, other than that it tastes good. What I love about this place is when I order the Japanese pork/chicken cutlet deal. I get a lot for what I pay for (side of zucchini, the cutlet, miso soup, and the curry with rice). It's cheap, super filling, and delicious enough! I guess this review is sorta biased towards their meal sets, and not so much towards their ramen, but oh well."}
{"text":"This is my bi-weekly fix of ramen GO TO place. It's just too good!   The manager truly has a keen interest for customer satisfaction which truly makes the food even more enjoyable. Every visit he's sure to provide us with an appetizer on the house. Plus points!   MY ALL TIME FAVE IS THE TOM YUM SPICY CHICKEN with of course corn added to it.   I just wanted to rewrite this review because I LOVE THIS PLACEE!!!"}
{"text":"Cheap, satisfying, and filling...but without that 'I'm too greasy and full to move.' feeling. Know what I mean? Go for the pork cutlet ramen. It comes with a large bowl of ramen noodles and bean sprouts in a pork bone based soup, and a nice crispy tender pork cutlet on the side. Dip the pork cutlet in the sauce or in the soup. Both are awesome. If you're feeling hungry, every side I've tried is excellent: edamame (cooked salted soy beans in the shell), fried pork dumplings, and rice plates are all good and cheap. If you're feeling adventurous you can try the volcano soup base (that's not bad), but I like to keep it simple. Food comes fast, service is quick (if you can get their attention), and it's always very friendly. The owner has come to my table to check on me on multiple occasions. This is one of my go to places when I want something quick and cheap that isn't going to leave me stuffed or gross feeling (like most fast food) for when I'm too lazy to cook."}
{"text":"My husband and I come here as our go-to date place when everything else fails. The owner/manager - when he's in - gives everyone complementary spring rolls and he is very accommodating and also makes sure that his customers are happy and satisfied. The waiting staff could have a little more personality but the food makes up for that. My faves are the tomato based ramens. The reward system they have is good incentive to continually come back but with technology these days, they could upgrade from collecting stamps on business cards to some kind of app? Or permanent reward card. Parking can sometimes be a hassle, but nothing I can truly complain about.   My only irk about this place is space. It gets busy and when it does, customers are left to wait in the tiniest foyer and sometimes even outside. A majority of the time, customers are waiting with the door open staring at you eating your food. And when it's cold, you don't want that damn door open with cold air on your hot ramen. I wish they could do something about that, but I know that is not possible.   So for now, I give this place 4.5 stars out of 5. I'm going to come back regardless."}
{"text":"First time visit, so I decided to be adventurous and try their generic sounding \"Ajisen Ramen\", which I'm pretty sure is just shoyu ramen, but with a side of corn (because I'm fancy.) And... well, it's good. Really good. I actually surprised myself by finishing most of the broth, something I never do because I usually find it to be way too salty anywhere else.   When I told my friend (who fancies himself as a bit of a ramen snob) that I'd found my new favorite ramen place, he told me that Ajisen had a reputation of being \"food court ramen\" since it was a chain. I felt ashamed for having a gutter palette, but then common sense kicked in and I promptly threatened his life in honor of my beloved Ajisen. Ajisen oh Ajisen."}
{"text":"My favorite ramen restaurant because no other ramen restaurant offers ramen as spicy as Ajisen such as the Spicy Pork Ramen 200 degrees."}
{"text":"This isn't a sad date story, but it *could* have been one... Met a dude once that said his dating deal-breaker was: Must-Love-Ajisen Ramen. I laughed. He didn't. I don't love it. It's novel, nearby, affordable, and tasty, but I only like the food and setting here enough to go once every two years. All of the components to a good food joint, but something didn't sit right in between my preference for subtler, slow-cooked flavours or in-your-face spice or savour. I sensed something was amiss for my palate. Still, I do recommend giving the menu a try.  I went out with the dude once. It's not you, it's me."}
{"text":"Really good portions, fast service, good food. However a thing that bugs me is that the manager seems to be quite rude, and looks like she hates the world. However the rest of the waitresses are all very pleasant to be around. Over all, it is a neat restaurant to try out, but note that the soup for the ramen may make you thirsty afterwards."}
{"text":"This place has the best ramen in the city. I eat here once a week after having tried many others. None compare."}
{"text":"I had a really bad experience there. The waitress accidentally spilled a whole glass of water on me. My winter jacket, jeans and shirts (even my underwear lol) were all wet. They didn't even try to offer us a discount to make it up for it. I got out the restaurant cold and shivering.  About the taste of the Ramen, it's not authentic Japanese ramen, the one I had was more like a combination of Chinese noodles and Japanese ramen. It did not taste as good as Japanese ramen like Raijin or Kenzo but it's slightly cheaper."}
{"text":"I came here Nov. 7. 2014 .The food  was pretty good~~ i ordered pork ramen and really loved eating the pork from the ramen. It had a bit of burnt taste that added flavor.   The ramen was pretty chewy and the soup was ok... but overall it was pretty good. Service was nice aswell~~  Will come again :)"}
{"text":"the food at ajisen is amazing! i've been obsessed with their new items and i'm also so indecisive about whether to get my usual spicy miso pork ramen or the new soft shell crab tom yum fried rice. the service is pretty good and the wait for the food to come is usually not too long. this location has really fun decor and is very roomy.  i've been visiting some of the other locations more recently tho because this one is a little bit further away, especially with their new location on kennedy and highway 7 but if i'm in the area, definitely my go to restaurant."}
{"text":"Ajisen Ramen is by far the best ramen I've had in Toronto. I've been a customer since I was very young and came with my parents and now I come with my friends and I only love it more.  I must say they have undoubtedly improved their quality over the years, their noodles are freshly made now from my conversation with the owner, and the soup is now consistently scorching hot!   Ajisen has an extremely wide variety on their menu. You can change the ramen to udon or change the soup base with whatever topping is on the original order.  I personally love the saltiness and tastes of the soup bases but I am impressed that they have a less salt/oil option.   I have grown accustom to the timing of the teppanyaki steak/chicken. I personally don't mind that the ramen and meat don't come at the same time because the timing does also ensure its freshness!   The owner is very nice and really works to satisfy customer needs. He often walks customers in and out and listens to customers' comments.   The new location is much more convenient for me and the new design in this store is very modern and aesthetic."}
{"text":"i absolutely loooooveeee ajisen!!! my favourite ramen restaurant. I've been coming since i was young with my parents. the environment is not too roomy but its not really a problem. the manager is super nice. i am obsessed with their new soft shell crab tom yum fried rice! the price is pretty cheap and worth, especially compared to all the over priced ramen stores around nowadays"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of ramen and hadn't had any for a while so I was excited to try out this place for the first time! We were seated quickly as it was pretty late (about 10 pm on a Tuesday) and I ordered the basic pork ramen. It wasn't spectacular but the broth was tasty and the noodles were a little chewy which was nice. The pork was thinly sliced which I prefer but there wasn't a lot of it. Overall the portion could have been larger, I definitely didn't leave feeling as full as I would have liked but not bad. The service was just okay, our food came out quickly but the waitresses were pretty distant. Overall, it was a good meal, I would probably go again if I was around and craving ramen but wouldn't go out of my way."}
{"text":"Came to try this place first day opening. I'll give them credit the place was busy. The noodles however was too chewy and the soup wasn't that great.   Not only that I had to wait 20 mins for my noodles which they had forgotten.  I'd say I'D NEVER WANT TO GO BACK. Food was medicore and this place is way to overrated,"}
{"text":"Had the spicy beef teppanyaki ramen. It's was decent and it had a good spice level to it. There are so many menu items it was hard to decide. I think they are used to being busy because the service staff seen very rushed running around the restaurant getting you things....but I get the impression that they want you in and out as quickly as possible. There are 4 locations around the GTA. I would probably recommend the one in North York over this location.   I did like their options of sauces and spices you can add to youu ramen at the table. Try the roasted garlic spice, adds a nice flavour to my soup. I also like the gyoza options (fried/panfriend/boiled). It's gives you a chance to feel less guilty without having to get something fried.  Overall it was worth trying out. Being in the Asian district of Toronto I will probably try another \"mom&pop\" place for ramen before deciding to try this out again...and I probably will given how big their menu selection is."}
{"text":"The best spicy ramen in Markham! So delicious and the service is quick. Even when there is a line out the door you are seated fairly quickly. This is my go to for cold winter days!"}
{"text":"I came here once with a friend awhile ago and never came back since.  There isn't any problem with the food, I think its pretty decent but the thing I had a problem with is the portions. I don't know if its because I'm a big guy or I'm just a fast eater but I don't feel that the amount they give you is worth the money.     I suppose me and my buddy where pretty large compared to everyone else sitting around us, we ended up going for pho afterwards.    One last thing that bothers me is how small the place is, I suppose its pretty hard and pricey to get a larger space but this place gets packed almost all the time, you better get here early or enjoy camping outside but then again, I wouldnt want to come back here after the bad impression.  It sucks that there isn't any good ramen places nearby and the good ones require me to head downtown. Some people seem to enjoy this place and a lot of people do not,  not worth the hassle of gambling your night away for a chance at bad food and service."}
{"text":"Regular customer at ajisen RAMEN it's literally the best RAMEN NODDLES I have ever tasted. Highly recommend this place  Personal favourite is fillet Mignon with corn (addition charge $1)"}
{"text":"For a place that so boldly states Ramen as part of their name. It's ironic that there are no ramen anywhere (_). So if you are reminiscing gulping down tasty wavy ramen, don't come here! Otherwise you will find yourself staring at a bowl of spaghetti in soup and wondering what went wrong? When did all noodles become substitute of each other?  I was sure I stepped into a ramen place and not an Italian soup noodle."}
{"text":"You call this ramen?  Visit this place only if you're into salty, greasy broth with spaghetti-type noodles that are probably from a box, served by indifferent staff.  I've had better food on airplanes.  There are dozens of better options for ramen in the GTA."}
{"text":"The ramen is average, which makes sense with 20+ options. The service is just terrible. The atmosphere is meh. Ordered pork ramen, seaweed salad and gyoza. The ramen was okay, nothing to write home about. The gyoza was semi cooked arrived 5 min after I finished the other dishes. It actually tasted well.  I'll come only if I don't really have a choice."}
{"text":"Yummy food and friendly service.  Will be returning to try other item from their very large and varied menu."}
{"text":"i have enjoyed my years of going to ajisen out at warden/steeles, always good noodles, hot and steamy.  thought it would be the same at the one on young just north of the 401, nope.  noodles were under cooked, temp was not hot enough.  i usually can't touch them for a few minutes til they cool down, these ones i could tuck into straight away.  i tried explaining the noodle problem, i asked for them to try again.  the second batch came back the same as the first, not very hot and under cooked.  tried explaining this to them, they just didn't seem to care too much, only offering to try again.  this was on a friday night, only 3-4 tables had folks in there, would have expected more since the warden and steeles one is always full when we go in on any night...and this is the second time i have been to this one, so this was a second chance for them, won't get a 3rd."}
{"text":"Wow. What's with the haters.  I had the kimchee beef ramen and it was tasty, fulfilling and somewhat affordable. Probably one of the better Ajisens i've been to"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful! Me and my friends came here one night and we all ordered their famous Ajisen ramen. They served our food 5 mins after we ordered, wow. I don't know if they are trying to get us out right away since we came in 45 mins before their closing time. Anyway, the food was amaaaaaazing. The pork was so tender and the soup was savoury . Also, the food didn't cost much which is a big thumbs up!  We wil definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Pretty decent ramen, despite its reputation of being \"the McDonalds of ramen joints\". I always know I can come here for a quick ramen fix for any cravings and come out satisfied. This location is faster in terms of service, as the dining area is greater than that of the location at Woodbine/ Steele's. I typically get the BBQ Pork Ramen ($1 more than the regular ramen for three extra slices of pork), and occasionally opt for the spicy version. The broth is consistently good, a little on the salty side, but the flavour is there. As for the noodles; perfect in texture if you ask me where it's not too chewy nor not too soft. I appreciate the abundance of toppings, like the corn, bean sprouts, and seaweed that come complimentary. However, the tea egg is hit or miss, where it sometimes comes completely done opposed to runny. Overall, a pretty great chain for that quick, affordable, and quality ramen craving fix!"}
{"text":"Tom Yum BBQ shrimp ramen was amazing! We went late at night, so they ran out of gyoza by that time, which I will try next time."}
{"text":"I love this place. Ramen is delicious. Friendly, attentive and fast service. Highly recommend during a cold winter day/night. Good option after a night of drinking! I'm almost certain this cured my hangover :$   I highly recommend this place. The manager (?) is also really friendly."}
{"text":"I'm actually quite surprised how busy this place gets.  The tables are packed really close together, and trying to get in or out of your seat without moving too close to someone else's meal is quite a challenge. If you need space, this place might be a bit of a problem.  Ordered a  tom yom teppanyaki chicken ramen cause what the heck. The broth is just full of shrimp paste that you can get from the grocery, so it's pretty terrible. The noodles are generic thin noodles that doesn't have much texture to it. And the portion size is pretty small as well. The chicken came with maybe 6 pieces, which was already less than the pics shown. It had this texture that was like as if they cooked it, left it out, and then recooked it.  For what you're paying for, if you're looking for noodle soup, just go to one of the chinese noodle shops. At least, you get some chewy noodles there and paying less for more."}
{"text":"Arguably the best ramen in toronto - I can't speak to its authenticity, but the deliciousness and the variety of options they have keep me coming back for more. Insanely fast service as well. My personal favourite is the tom yum bbq shrimp ramen, which comes with two skewers of shrimp (as the name implies). The broth has a nice heat to it, and the noodles are smooth and delicious."}
{"text":"Great location right on Spadina in Chinatown. The interior is kind of kitchy with its bright pink vinyl chairs and booths and they really pack em in.  The menu is huge so I just asked the guy at the next table what he was having when they brought out a big bowl and sizzling platter of meat. Tom Yum with chicken ramen is it! It was very good loaded with coconut milk and ramen noodles.  I would return for the Tom Yum if I happened to be in the area it was quick, cheap and tasty."}
{"text":"Nice setting with abundance number of booths.   Busy but it clears up quickly.  Now the food: Expect the broth to be tasty and the ramen bland. I somehow expected more ... like the broth would have infused itself into the ramen and its overall egg-iness (noodles) would transpire back into the broth. Not so.  Overall, alright price and impression for my first time there."}
{"text":"this is the place where I tried my first ramen soup! the portions are huuuuge! the food is good but the veg options are very very limited.  I licked the decorations (pink couches and colorful walls=)) and the cutlery (funky soup spoons) hard to miss this place as there is a huge figure of a soup eating kimono wearing girl in front of it=)"}
{"text":"I came to this place looking for that soul warming bowl of soup.  I had the house special noodle bowl, which had strips of chicken and a bunch of appetizers.  The appetizers were good and the soup was passable, but I found everything to be very salty.  I like salt, but in this case it was over applied such that I did not enjoy the subtle flavours of a simple dish.  It is too bad because I was looking forward to this place with its kitschy design and plentiful soup offering."}
{"text":"The chicken teppanyaki noodles was awesome. A little to spicy for me though."}
{"text":"Fast service, delicious food, reasonable prices, and a happy tummy! Still my favourite ramen restaurant. I got the kimchi bbq pork ramen and it was delicious."}
{"text":"My favourite as always. Delicious ramen and good service as usual! I got the pork bbq ramen with kimchi and my brother got the pork ramen without the kimchi. Food came out hot and quickly. The portion was super filling. I have to say this is my favourite ramen bowl at Ajisen yet.  I got the vegetable spring rolls as an appetizer but I would not recommend them because they are so oily."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend for a quick and cheap dinner last night. I've never had \"real ramen\" before, so I'm not able to say if the ramen is very good here.  In my opinion, the noodles were nice and al dente, the broth was on the salty side, but fine and the pieces of lamb were flavourful and cooked nicely. The amount of food was just enough for what I wanted. My friend had the curry lamb ramen and said the same.  Not the best food I've ever had, but not terrible either."}
{"text":"I live in the area and used to come here alot, however came here and had a terrible experience about a year ago and haven't been back in awhile. Decided to give this another chance today and was reminded why I haven't come in so long.  The service is ok but nothing special. My bigger problem is with the quality of the food. This isn't sansotei or santouka but I used to love the taste of the food. It has gone so far down hill from those days when it first opened. The meat (whether filet mignon or beef) has no flavour and is so overcooked it might as well have been labled beef jerky. The noodle is also overcooked which is so disappointing because good noodles is the least you can provide as a ramen restaurant. I asked for my tomyum soup to be less spicy but it was more like less spice, less salt, and watered down. The pan fried gyozas were super wet as if they never bothered to give it at least a mini sear, but was somehow sitting in a pool of oil. The worst was when I told the waitress the soup was plain and watery, her solution was to hand me a salt shaker.   This restaurant has a small glass window to the kitchen where you can see the chefs doing everything with mediocrity. You could hear them joking around unprofessionally which explains alot why the food came out the way it did. Overall, this place is so far from the old days where you were greeted with a loud welcoming by the staff when you walked in. I remember the owner being a very nice guy. If I were him I would do something about the current standards that his employees live up to before this restaurant is no more as there is increasing competition moving into the area."}
{"text":"My friend works here so I guess my review might be a bit biased.  A lot of the workers here are super friendly, especially the kitchen staff! The service is also pretty fast and the washroom here is very clean compared to most restaurants.   The ramen is decently priced, but doesn't taste the best compared to the more expensive ramen places around. They raised the prices too so it's a bit pricey now!  There's also wifi! Just ask them for the password :)"}
{"text":"By far the best Ramen I've ever had. The base is called a \"white broth\" and looks as though there might be cream or milk in it, and I've never had better. I love Ramen and have taken it upon myself to try as many places in Toronto as possible, but I can't help returning here time and time again. My favourite is the beef ramen. Always perfectly cooked with tender meat and crisp beansprouts. This is my ideal comfort food."}
{"text":"Service was efficient but not personable/friendly. Restaurant was busy. The ramen was good :)"}
{"text":"I used to love coming to this place. But now, I feel their ramen is full of MSG and the food quality has def went down since a few years ago. The price is still pretty decent, but there are def much better ramen out there for the same price.  Their portion is decent, their side dishes are still pretty good. But I personally find their food way too oily. Service is good."}
{"text":"I remember the first time I was here I was not super impressed, the food was kind of salty and everything was average. However, this visit the manager gave us free spring rolls, the food came pretty quickly and the curry pork cutlet I had was surprisingly good! I would come here again for the same dish for sure"}
{"text":"Ajisen ramen has more selection on their menu than most ramen places. I particularly like their seaweed salad. It tastes fresh and does not smell ( some seaweed salads have this subtle smell which does not appeal to me).  The ramen is decent but not particularly exceptional. I used to like it before I tried Kenzo ramen. I find Kenzo's broth richer and more complex in flavour. Ajisen's noodles I find better than Kenzo's. Overall, Ajisen is not bad and I would return if I didn't have to drive so far."}
{"text":"I gave this restaurant 4 stars because it's at a convenient location when I am in Markham area.  I love the tom yum soup and kimchi soup they are my favourite.  The reason this restaurant doesn't get a 5-star is because of the service.  There are these two usual workers who are always SOOOOOOO miserable looking.  My husband gets upset everytime we go and these ladies have this look on their face as if you are their enemy, no facial emotion, no reply or acknowledgement of any kind when you give them your order.  Yet I still keep going back, only because this is where I meet my mom once a week and I am starving by the time I get there and it's the best thing in the area for ramen.  Now if I was downtown, I would never pay a visit to this restaurant.  The owners are so friendly, the younger gentleman he must be the son, is always so friendly, smiley and welcoming who talks and checks in on the customers so he balances the poor service of the two miserable workers."}
{"text":"I tried both the ajisen ramen and the koji salt premium ramen. The ajisen ramen had a stronger flavor and the meat was very tender. The koji salt had a lighter soup. I would recommend both! The flavors are balanced. If I would recommend anything, it is that the noodle be drained properly. Some of my noodles on one of my soup was stuck together but that was a small matter.   The ambience is casual. The owner walks around and greets everyone. So down to earth! The ramen came to our table in less than 15 minutes. The payment was also quick. There is also a lady who walks around with toothpicks and asks if there is anything we need. We came in around 8pm on a Saturday if that helps others decide. Really loved the experience!"}
{"text":"Something about it just wasn't the same as the original Toronto location uptown, let alone the ones in Hong Kong.   Surprisingly there wasn't a line up for this place, like I've experienced before. Nor did they shout Aiyamasaay at me in unison.   The menu is the same, but I also noticed missing some items (maybe I just haven't come here in a long time)  This is Asian fast food for you. It's cheap, it comes quickly, and the quality is just okay. I mean, there are other choices for noodles all along the street.   Around $7-8 a bowl, it comes with meat, half a preserved egg, seaweeds, green onions...One bowl + shared appetizer is good for one person.  It's comfort food all the way. Like a good big mac.  The place is a franchise, so you'll get a different experience if you go to the other locations, so don't write off Ajisen after coming to just one!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Never had ramen before in my life before coming here. Now I eat here once a month =) good prices too!"}
{"text":"This was my first time trying ramen - and I did enjoy it. I ordered the beef ramen for pick up, and it came deconstructed with the beef in a tin foil pack, the broth in one container, and then the noodles in another. At first i thought it tasted quite salty, but after a few bites it was really good! Would return in the future, but only for takeout, as the restaurant looked really small!"}
{"text":"Ordered the beef tenderloin ramen (spicy). Server's English was very basic (but we are in Chinatown). All the girls were really friendly. I like that there's wifi at this place. Service was very fast. My ramen came in around 5 mins after ordering. Although it was a bit salty, it was still very good. I was impressed by how much meat they gave and was really happy about that."}
{"text":"Went to Ajisen Ramen for dinner and it was pretty empty with only about a couple of people. We went around 6pm. We sat and ordered quickly.   I ordered the Tom Yum Ramen with Steak Teppanyaki and my friend ordered the Pork Ramen. My go-to now is the Tom Yum Ramen with Steak Teppanyaki because the tom yum flavour had a spicy kick and the steak teppanyaki always comes on a sizzling hot plate. I always eat the steak teppanyaki later because it's hot.   FYI: There's not much other toppings in the ramen itself. Just noodles, bean sprouts and a lime. There's no other meat or vegetables.  The service was quick and efficient. There wasn't many people there so I would expect it to be quick and efficient.   Overall, it was a quick good meal that gave me my ramen fix and I was satisfied with the service."}
{"text":"I ordered the tender pork ribs noodles. Really tasty ramen. Juicy pork ribs. Waitress explained that the way they prepare their pork ribs makes it so that you can actually eat the bone. It was very tasty and tender. Broth and noodles are tasty too. Huge bowl.  Place is clean, comfy booths, great service."}
{"text":"Melt in your mouth yummy meats and ramen! Delicious and decadent MSG. Yum."}
{"text":"I go to Ajisen Ramen once a week for Lunch or Dinner because it's easy, quick and delicious.   The service is also pretty amazing as well. Everyone seems happy to work there. They deliver food quickly and always the way I want it. I'm not always an easy customer. Im eccentric and always ask for certain things (a little extra broth, fresh chopped garlic on the side) and they always deliver on my requests with a smile and no extra charge.  I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants a yummy quick meal while passing through Chinatown. I always get the Spicy Miso Filet Minion Ramen!! The tataki balls are really amazing too!   You can't miss it... It's got the little Anime Character statue out front holding the bowl of ramen!"}
{"text":"Ajisen Ramen was a recommendation from one of my friends who is a regular there and I must say I was impressed with what I ate. What impressed me most was the menu. No other ramen place has offered me so many options. Secondly the seating capacity is much bigger than most ramen places. I ordered Tom yum ramen with steak and it was so delicious. I would also recommend spicy pork ramen.  If you ask me to go into intricate details then I'd say the service was good but not the best. I also found a small piece of broken glass on the chair next to me. As far as the service and food goes I would give a 5/5 to Ramen ishin and Kenzo Ramen.  Like I said these things will not bother me from eating at Ajisen ramen again. Good luck."}
{"text":"Do you like instant noodles? Do you like a lot of msg? Do you like cheap food which will make you feel full for hours after you finish but doesn't contain any nutritional value?  I don't even think it's worth writing anything else. If you've eaten here and you've also eaten homemade ramen, you'll know."}
{"text":"This was the first Aijsen Ramen in Toronto and I remember being really excited about coming here - being a fan of the chain in Hong Kong.   I remember when it first opened, there was always a line up. Once they came out and served us tea. And when you come in, they all shout at you Guu style.   We more recently on a Thursday night at 7pm. It was half full (or empty, however you want to see it). They weren't as friendly as they used to be.   The menu has evolved into this crazy 10 page book. The low down: You can get almost any combination of soups and meat, including japanese beef steak, vegetarian, lamb, chicken, tempura etc. Their soups include Tom Yum soup, Kimchi soup, regular broth among others. I didn't see the miso soup version I used to like.   There are also rice plates and set dinners if the soup isn't to your liking. I remember their eel rice was really yummy, but that was a long time ago.   Two people $20."}
{"text":"Had the veggies miso, would recommend.. It was really cold in the restaurant. Felt kinda rush. Also had the beef curry it was mediocre.  The appetizers  are small but filling."}
{"text":"Safe choice for ramen.  Nothing amazing but definitely good for a quick meal. service is friendly and quick"}
{"text":"The service was so quick, we didn't have to wait for our food that long, and they came as soon as possible if we needed anything, plus the stamp card is a very nice bonus :)"}
{"text":"I'm no ramen expert but I know deliciousness when I taste it! This is my second time here and I love it. The interior is quaint and cozy with free Wi-Fi, the staff are super friendly and quick, the food comes very quickly and most importantly it tastes SO GOOD. Their ramen is the perfect consistency with fresh noodles cooked al dente. I got the chicken Kim chi ramen and it was great, the grilled chicken came out first in a sizzling hot skillet and it allowed the chicken to develop a crisp texture on the outside while remaining tender inside, and the soup followed with the Kim chi. Please note that some dishes are spicy, but I love spice and I was feeling under the weather today so today in particular I really needed/appreciated it. I felt like a new guy walking out of there. My partner got spring rolls and fried shrimp ramen and his tasted amazing as well! We both really enjoyed ourselves, and for only under $30 for both of us! Can't go wrong, Ajisen is a North York staple for a reason; it clearly earned its stripes."}
{"text":"Ajisen Ramen has made a lasting impression for Torontonians looking to satisfy their ramen cravings.   This place is normally crowded, so it is best to come early if you would like a spot to try some authentic Japanese ramen.   There are a lot of ramen varieties to choose from, so it does become very difficult to choose a ramen to try. They also have other dishes like gyoza, curry, etc. The menu can be very extensive, but it is best to experiment your different tastes in ramen.   This location can use an interior upgrade as the same cushions still preside from the location's opening when it first opened in 2004.   The service of the wait stuff was very good they were very accomodating to every request I had. Overall, Ajisen Ramen started the ramen trend that has been growing over the past few years.   So, come check out any Ajisen Ramen location if you are looking for something to warm you up , especially during the winter months."}
{"text":"My favourite ramen place I recommend the steak ramen.  Steak is served on a hot sizzling plate and then you get your ramen"}
{"text":"i had lots japanese food in different place, rame is one of the most popular in japanese food. for japanese ppl it's like burgers/pizza for north americans.   but this place is just a joke.  iv never had any noodle that taste this bad  in any noodle place. it taste more than paper than noodle to me. hard and dry. the cook is doing something else instead of cooking it obvsly.   only eat there 2 times, their noodle is just like that, no excuse, thats how their noodle is, just raw and dry, dipping in almost clear soup. and they call it rame.  do u even kno how thick the soup is in real japanese rame?  apparently not, as the cooks and the boss and every1 in there is chinese. the japanese rame place is chinesed."}
{"text":"I know this is a chain, but it's fun.  The ramen is solid, service friendly, and right on Spadina.  Every time I come to Toronto, I want Ajisen."}
{"text":"Ramen is OK. The menu is a bit too... large and filled with images. It feels a bit too much no frills for what could be a bit more elegant ramen place. They also seem to have issue with handling large tables. Seemed very chaotic with staff all over the place and little room.  They charge extra for spicy; a dollar or two more for the same item. What the heck? Soup base wasn't impressive and too MSG or strong in taste.  And it's supposed to be Japanese style right? Decor and style seems very gimmicky.   I'd eat here again but the two star rating is quite accurate: \"Meh. I've experienced better.\""}
{"text":"Good. I like the taste of the ramen here. Think I'm coming back for other flavours. Yup, have to try beef ramen next time.  Just came back with my wife, and she liked it. We'll return soon."}
{"text":"PROS: 1. I had the beef tom yum, and omg the soup base taste was spot on. SO GOOD. I was tempted to ask how they made it. 2. I love the decor. The pink chairs with the sumo wrestler wall mural looks cool. 3. It's very affordable. Like $8 for a ramen that is sure to fill and satisfy anyone.  CONS: 1. Bathroom is in a basement and is quite dingy. 2. Definitely no 'service-with-a-smile' here.   OVERALL: -I would definitely recommend Ajisen ramen. It's sooo much better than Kenzo (where the soup base was so-so and my noodles kept sticking together)"}
{"text":"The manager is so rude here, and store is not clean, especially the bar and the place hold noodle, they take things by hands into the soup and take it out. When I use discount card, I was informed that I can only use one instead of two at the same time. however I ordered two ramen. Also, they ask you to pay in the front but actually the machine is available for moving. Unpleasant experience that I do not recommend to go this place anymore.I would consider Santosei Ramen next time. The manager seems like a Cantonese but so rude. Wish someone can fire her."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. I prefer Ajisen over Kenzo (another ramen shop) because Ajisen offers more variety. Also, I never taste spicy food... but at Ajisen, when I asked them to make my ramen EXTREMELY spicy, I could actually taste the spiciness. Majorly impressed."}
{"text":"Honestly I prefer this place to the other more pricey and \"authentic\" ramen places. I've had many of there different ramen dishes. The soup base is good, the noodles are decent and the toppings are good. What more can I ask for? And the price is great. I have to say props to Ajisen for not making ramen seem so posh and upscale like the other places you can find in this city."}
{"text":"First time here and it's not bad . This place is much cheaper in price. Raman is average and the dumpling is like eating Chinese dumplings lol. It's worth a try if you never been here."}
{"text":"I come here a few times a year when in the area and it's been a very consistent experience.   The always smiling gentleman owner of this establishment is a steady ad constant fixture here which is great as he ensures staff are attentive, not that they need any coaxing. He is also a very generous person as on more than one occasion he has treated us to a free order of appetizers, for no real reason at all, which we appreciate!  The ramen itself is great! Soup base is not very salty yet tasty. The beef and pork toppings are both great tasting and cooked well.  They also have a loyalty program which is great if you frequent the joint.   Parking is a bit difficult as most other outlets in this area due to the sheer popularity of the businesses in this plaza. And if you go for lunch be prepared to possibly have to wait for a table as the place gets packed fast."}
{"text":"So I'm updating my rating after another visit. I think this will be my choice in the area instead of Kenzo. For one, the service is much better - food comes out very quickly, and there hasn't been any nonsense with the staff taking meal breaks en masse (I understand, but maybe don't leave the entire restaurant hanging? Maybe do it in two stages?) or giving me water once and never refilling it.  My last visit, I ordered a ramen with corn and BBQ pork. The broth was a little more oily and had some tiny specks of something - maybe a garlic, because it was much more flavorful. I think the chashu was different than the one used on the Ajisen Ramen, and I liked this one better. The egg was still too cooked and not runny in the least. I also ordered the grilled sanma and had no complaints - good to the bone. The side dipping sauce was weird and almost tasted like sumac, but I had no problem not using it and just squeezing the lemon you get.  One note: the ramen came out in less than 5 minutes, but the sanma took about 6-7 minutes on top of that. I didn't care, but I thought it was odd that not only did the appetizer come after, it was so much slower to come out than the main course.  I would still like to try the tenderous ribs and I still love the variety."}
{"text":"Ajisen Ramen($5.95)...   Tonkotsu Broth I do have to say I enjoy but then I naturally enjoy and set a preference for this type of Broth over other selections. It was a Milky Broth and at the same time Tonkotsu is always satisfying much like a Beef Stew on those cold nights. Unfortunately, the Broth was the highlight of this meal. 2.5 *Star*   The Chashu and Marinated Egg looked like what I SHIT out from a bad meal. The Noodles is what I believe is highly discussed when anyone goes to Ajisen and so I will also give my honest opinion.   It is slurp-able but uses the Straight style rather than Wrinkled which needs a longer slurp to consume what a small wrinkled slurp could have done. Wrinkled are more playful and also what most of us are more accustomed to as well.   The CHEW after the slurp is where I believe most will dislike as it is somewhat a Spaghetini style Ramen with an Al-dente core which means when you bite into it, it doesn't bounce back and the uncooked mid-core gives off that distinct raw Noodle flavour that doesn't complement the Broth but fights it instead.  In terms of the appearance of this Ajisen, while it has the usual unique Bowl Museum on the side wall and the Sumo Photo Wall.  The pink benches and seats were really showing wear & tear and I didn't imagine how unappealing it could be but this Ajisen has now showned me this visual aspect should be budgeted for the next make-over."}
{"text":"Don't have experience of authentic Japanese ramen, but this place is very good. Lots of choices, I personally love the  BBQ pork ramen!"}
{"text":"Great food and service is adequate, love the selection of Ramen. The prices have increased lately but I still love their ramen"}
{"text":"Decided to give this ramen joint another try after several years. My feedback would still be the same as before, not much has changed. Tried the ajisen ramen - broth was lacking in flavour and noodles were not crunchy. Not a big fan of this joint and prefer other ramen joints."}
{"text":"This used to be our go to place a long while back until we started to notice the portion sizes grow smaller and smaller. We stopped going for awhile, and only came back because its a Monday and every other ramen place in the area is closed. The owner is really nice, always gives us complimentary spring rolls. Not sure if he does that for others but its appreciated. The longer I sit here the more dissatisfied I become and remember why we stopped coming. The ramen is great but the service continues to be atrocious. I don't blame the server, as she's pretty much on her own. But she needs to take the time to get the order correct. We waited our whole meal for our appetizer...and when it came it wasn't the right dish or the right quantity. Its good if you're in the area but there are better places to go!"}
{"text":"AJISEN!!!! I love their iconic Japanese Character doll of the shop.   First off, I would just like to say how lucky I am for just getting here before rush hour in the two times that I have came here. AWESOME. I got the Ajisen Ramen ($8.50), I love trying the \"house noodles\" every time I visit a noodle place to see what they recommend most. I also realize that house meals are most worth the value. The Ajisen ramen is comprised of green onions, half an egg, BBQ pork?, bean sprouts and of course, noodles.  My friend got the Pork Cutlet Ramen ($9.50), where the noodles is basically plain noodles with soup and green onions and a separate plate of pork cutlet. Although the pork cutlet was a small plate, it had a lot of texture and tasted delicious.  It tasted awesome while I was eating it, but I guess after I left, the MSG started kicking in. There was actually quite a bit of MSG in here, but nevertheless, it was still really tasty.   Beware of awfully long wait times!"}
{"text":"Thank you Ajisen Ramen!  Because of your crappy bowl of noodles I had yesterday, it will make my ramen this weekend at Ippudo NYC (http://www.yelp.com/biz/ippudo-ny-new-york) taste so much better!  Notes:  1. \"Irasshaimase!\" sounds funny when Chinese people say it. 2. The creme-coloured broth tastes like salty water 3. Pretty cheap (but there are way better eating bargains to be had in the Chinatown/Kensington area) 4. It's very busy -- I suspect it won't be once they've had enough people try it 5. Has me rethinking that Kenzo might be a lot better than I give it credit for 6. Decor is too bright and busy.  Annoying really.  Dare I say that you are banned?"}
{"text":"Seems to be in a pretty good location; nestled within a plaza with a whole slew of other restaurants, this place is consistently busy. However, I felt that the actual ramen was disappointing. While I didn't find the (miso based) broth to be too salty, the pork slices in the pork ramen ($9.50) were overwhelmingly stingy. Instead of the thick and substantial pieces of pork you'd find in places like Kinton, Sanostei and Ryu's, Ajisen's reminded me of deli ham (that's how thin they were). Additionally, the egg add-ons were also more expensive than other places downtown, which is surprising; $1 for an extra half egg. However, they do have two types of egg: one seems to be a plain hard boiled while the other is the more typical seasoned, soft boiled variety.   I also tried the takoyaki, which, again, disappointed. While flavour was alright, the balls were tiny!!! For $6, I really expected better. They came in a plate of 5. Bonito flakes were also scarce."}
{"text":"I'm a regular guest here and came here the other day for lunch and the menu was large and had many different dishes. One of my favourites is the ramen that comes with the sizzling plate of steak on the side and the smell is buttery and amazing. The staffs there were very friendly and polite and immediately sat us when we walked in and got us our drinks, making us feel very welcomed and comfortable. The atmosphere of the place is very soothing and clean, providing a warm feeling while eating our ramen. As far as pricing goes, it is fairly decent and one bowl of ramen will definitely get the job done. I would recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a huge selection of different ramen flavours and dishes."}
{"text":"Had the tonkotsu ramen here last night. The pork bone broth was nice and creamy, but I found it too salty. The ramen noodles tasted good, and the pork tonkotsu itself was nice & tender. It would've been perfect if the broth just wasn't too salty. The server was friendly and the overall restaurant was nice & clean."}
{"text":"My go to is #19. The filet mignon ramen. We come here often. Hits the spot when its cold or wet outside. The gyoza is an easy pick. We recently discovered the garlic flakes in the shaker on every table. We always see hot plates but have not tried it yet. This place is beating all the other ramen places we have tried."}
{"text":"The quality of the ramen is not good compared to other ramen places. I feel like I ate instant noodles. The only good thing is that the portions are pretty large, and there aren't as many ramen places in this area."}
{"text":"The food is really good, I've been there couple times and never been disappointed on my order. It's also affordable and fits perfectly a student budget.  The staff though isn't nice, I haven't seen a smile on their face even though I tried to...  Decoration is okay too.  Just go there for the food !"}
{"text":"This place was my favourite place to come for Ramen \"Was\"  It's no longer what it was and the price keeps going up. There is now much better near by."}
{"text":"Used to go here quite often as it was located at the bottom of my building. I recently checked out the location on Spadina, few menu changes and small changes to the dishes since I've been but everything still delicious."}
{"text":"nothing special...got the ramen with steak but the steak came way after (it's advertised as a set and thus should come at the same time)....i'm sure kinton or the other ramen place in this area are better"}
{"text":"Pretty good, although don't order the steak ramen...it was much too tough to eat. Just stick to the deep fried stuff. Service was really good & price was decent as well. Would come here again."}
{"text":"My favourite place!   I've been coming here for 4 years and I'm never disappointed. The service is polite and quick & the food never takes longer than 10 minutes! The manager is very friendly and always gives us free spring rolls when he sees us.   I always order the kimchi beef teppanyaki & my mom always gets the ajisen spicy pork. I love everything about the ramen, the broth, the noodles and the egg! The pork chasiu meat is creamy and soft, very much a \"melt in your mouth\" kind of feeling.   I love this place!"}
{"text":"It's been a couple years since I've been to any Ajisen Ramen. I came for dinner tonight, and they were full at 7:30pm. We waited for a few minutes for our table, but I don't have a problem with that. I was quite surprised that their menu is considerably larger than it was before. I quite like that. The prices are around 9-12 dollars per bowl of ramen.  I had the BBQ pork ramen ($9.50). It had 6 slices of pork. The pork wasn't dry, but it wasn't melting in my mouth either. The egg wasn't soft-boiled, but it wasn't disturbingly dry. There were some bean sprouts and some shreds of black fungus. There was also a sprinkling of green onion. The soup base was a tad salty. The noodles had a nice chew to them. The food came out quickly. It wasn't super piping hot, but it was hot enough. I was in and out in less than an hour.   My friend had the teppanyaki steak ramen ($11.99?). She said the steak was juicy and tender and delicious. It smelled pretty good. Oddly enough though, the steak and the bowl of ramen did not come out at the same time. She said this is normal (I'm assuming she would know, because this is her regular).   Thing to note for next time: Their black sesame ice cream is $1.99. That's super cheap. I don't know if the portion is small or the sesame ice cream is now of a cheap quality, but if they're using the same kind as they were three years ago, this is a really good deal. I had black sesame ice cream for the first time in my life here many years ago, and I'd have to say that this black sesame ice cream was the darkest colored black sesame ice cream that I've ever had, and that's a good thing.  I'd come again to try more of their menu."}
{"text":"Good food, attentive staff and decently priced.  The Ajisen franchise seems to be all over Toronto. It's also one of the top choices for ramen on Google. My cousin and his girlfriend came from New York and really wanted Ramen. He googled and Ajisen came up. I met him there which was kind of a mission because the area was so jammed! Right around Pacific mall at Warden and Steeles... watch yourself if you're driving. This place was kind of hidden in the plaza there was jam backed with other restaurants.   Now for the food - we got edamame to start, pretty standard. I got the spicy chicken ramen and my cousin and his girlfriend both got pork ramen. I thought it was great. The broth was flavourful and spicy, the chicken was cooked very well and not dry and there was a lot of noodles. Personally I like pho rice noodles better but this wasn't bad.  You can get a good portioned plate or bowl for between $10-$15. The staff were also so nice. We didn't have the chase them down for anything. They came with extra napkins, the food was prompt even though it was busy and they accept cash and credit. As my first ramen experience, I was happy and so were my family."}
{"text":"This place actually has quite a few choices of ramen comparing to kenzo and sansotei. Being able to choose the spicy level of the ramen was pretty neat imo. However, not a big fan of the Japanese fried chicken, it was pretty much tasteless and the chicken and coated batter wasn't in balance. Overall the service was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"A POEM TO MEDIOCRITY:  Not much to say, 'cept  this place is very spacious  Seats are far enough  Can't hear the table next to us   forgot what I ordered  Not that it's important Menu's very set  Can't customize your ramen   Probably ordered shoyu base  With pork and egg on top Didn't have a long wait But when it came it wasn't hot   Soup was pretty average  Taste was mediocre  Before today I didn't think I was a ramen connoisseur   Taste doesn't really stand out  I don't think I'd recommend  If I had to give a rating  I'd give four out of ten."}
{"text":"My friend and I (its pretty much always the same friend in all my reviews. She loves eating more than I do) were walking around Yonge and Finch yesterday, and we strolled down here. We wanted something different from our usual Korean or Sushi fare, so we passed by here, and thought we'd stop by.   Basically, the bright pink decor drew us in. I loved it. It totally looked tacky, but it was awesome.   We were seated right away, and the restaurant was packed. They had lots of seating sort of cramped together, but it was fine with us (before we ordered, I spent a good five minutes watching the people on the tables next to us eat, so I could figure out how to eat this soup correctly)  The menu was great because it included a picture of everything. Everything looked amazing. But some of the cool items were suspended :(   So this is what we ended up ordering  Apps :  1. Gyoza - It was good gyoza, but not the best. Also, on our trek here, I got some gyoza from the food cart outside shoppers at Yonge and Finch, so that may be my fault. The filling was chicken and mushroom i think, not the usual beef.  2. Deep Fried Chicken AKA Karaage : AWESOME. Huge Chunks. Lots of pieces. Served on a bed of lettuce and a bit of parsley, and some mayo to dip, and a wedge of lemon to drizzle all over.. mmmmmm love that lemon.  Ramenzzzzzz  1. I got the Spicy Pork Ramen (see picture I added). When I spoke to the extremely awesome waitress, I asked her which is the spiciest ramen. She suggested the Spicy Pork and the Volcano sauce. I was tempted, but I just decided to play it a little safe and go with the Spicy Pork with 200 degrees. It was amazing. The broth was sooooo delicious. I drank half the broth in like 10 mins. It was sexy. Then I got overexcited at the awesome condiments at the table (there were three, Dried Garlic, Soy, and another one not labeled but smelled spicy) and put too much dried garlic into the soup. It was still awesome. One con though, which I'll talk about at the end.   2. My friend got the Kimchi BBQ Pork Ramen, and aside from no heat and added kimchi, it didn't taste much different from mine.       Final Thoughts:  1. The egg that they put in the soup was AWESOME. At first, I was scared because I thought it was a century egg, and that shit scares me. But it was just a baked egg with soy. It was so delicious.  2. There's two cons here (At least to my taste)  Con A: There were only 3 small slices of pork in my soup. Like wtf.   Con B: The noodles kinda just tasted like spaghetti. It was al dente.     I would definitely go back though, but from what I hear, I have to go to Kenzo first :)"}
{"text":"Out of the many options at new kennedy square, this should be your last. The waiters dont really care and tosses your food on your table. The ramen there are really bland and the pork cutlets dont really have pork in it either. The set came with miso soup which tasted like store bought packet miso soup. Only good thing is there was no wait for a table."}
{"text":"After fighting traffic for 40 minutes just to get to Ajisen, I was one cranky little girl who was ready to write off this place for no reason other than I was having a bad day.   But... then I had a taste of their rich, milky tonkotsu broth and realized how short-sighted I'd been. Delicious. I had the pork and corn ramen, and although the serving of pork seemed skimpy, I was totally satisfied by the time I'd slurped the last drop from the bowl. Just the right portion to fill you up without making you feel like you're going to pop open from fullness.   Cute Japanese pop-arty decor and reasonable prices add to the allure. However, find street parking if you can because the lot that this restaurant sits on is ridic expensive. I probably wouldn't come this way again considering there's another Ajisen much closer to where I live (a fact I hadn't realized until after I'd done all my upstream swimming to this particular location), but if I'm in the area this place would be a top choice."}
{"text":"I used to love coming here. However, the last 3 times in a row-- the noodles were hard and quite raw. So, I always asked them to recook the noodles... That wasn't too much of a problem but it was a real turn off.  So today day when my mom was craving noodles, my baby sister and I went with her.  Wow... They even pissed my mom off. She requested for them to make sure that the noodles were cooked more thoroughly so my baby sister could chew it.  We sat there for at least 25 minutes... those who came in at the same time as us and after us all had what they wanted. So why didn't we have our ramen too?  While all this was happening, my sister was starting to feel extremely bored and almost falling asleep.  We asked for them to be alittle faster.  After a while longer, my mom asked if they processed our ticket... And it didn't seem that they did. I guess they were pissed that we asked for the noodles to be cooked alittle longer?? I don't know.  After a while longer they brought out two bowls and we were finally ready to eat.   These bowls weren't for us. They went to a table who ordered 10 minutes ago. 10 minutes and they already got their food. We were pissed and asked the waitress what was going on. She told us to calm our shit and just gave us attitude as if we were the ones being unreasonable. We were fed up. Got up and on our way out-- the waitress told the chef not to cook the noodles. They didn't even start cooking the noodles yet?   never coming back*"}
{"text":"The food was good. I ordered Tom Yum BBQ Pork. highly recommendation. The service wasn't good but the food was good ok. because i paid for food. that's enough if they didn't want to service."}
{"text":"We travel here. We walked by this place and decided to try it after we already had a bad japanese restaurant for dinner. I read their sign \"Best ramen in town#1\" I ordered Tom Yum BBQ pork. It was good."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend on a Thursday evening around 6.30pm. The restaurant was quite busy, like 3/4 full. They do have nice settings, and the outside light would contribute to the restaurant's lighting. I like how the chilli powder was accessible just behind me.   Since it was my first time at Ajisen ramen, I ordered what I think to be their original ramen, the \"Ajisen ramen\". It comes with pork, half an egg, black fungus and beansprouts. The taste is different from other ramen places I've had, but it was still tasty and yummy. The egg is more like hard boiled egg with the yolk fully cooked, unlike other places. As usual, I enjoyed both the noodles and the soup. Their price is a little higher than where I usually go, but they have a large selection of items in their menu.   Will go back when I'm around the area with friends.   Food: 4.3/5 Service: 4/5  Price: 3.5/5"}
{"text":"When we walked into Ajisen, we could not wait to try their famous ramen! The mural on the wall was very colourful and added to the fun vibe of the restaurant. The service was friendly and accommodating. However, one of the servers made our dining experience a little less...appetizing. How do I put this delicately...the server had problems with personal hygiene. We could smell her a mile away even after she left for the kitchens. The service overall was very friendly and accommodating, save for the slight mishap with bills.   When it came to the ramen, we were not disappointed! The Ajisen spicy pork ramen was flavourful and filling. Our server was kind enough to provide us with the spice on the side since we weren't sure about the spice level. With just the right amount of heat, the spice pork ramen was absolutely delicious! The Koji salt premium sliced pork ramen was also amazing! The broth was flavourful, the noodles were cooked perfectly and the pork was tender and juicy.   The appetizers were a different story. The seaweed salad tasted very artificial, and the pork to rice ratio in the pork ball was abysmal. The takoyaki tasted mostly like batter and were very small in size.   Overall, we were quite happy with our experience at Ajisen, especially with the ramen. We'll be sure to come back again - but only for the ramen next time."}
{"text":"Not sure why they don't have better rating which I almost didn't want to stop there but everything was great and we  went there with a group of 9"}
{"text":"Toronto's oldest ramen joint is probably the worst. The noodles are like low quality spaghetti noodles that have such a weak texture and are bland. Broth is boring. It's just not good stuff. I give them 2 stars because they were the first ramen place I knew of in the city and I like the way the place looks. Quirky and fun. But food wise, this place is just not good at all. And I'll never go back. I feel terrible writing a bad review, but I can't only have 5 star reviews. I got to do my part to reflect on some of the weaker restaurant spots in the city. Just so people who want a good meal will know there are many better options in the immediate area. Like Ryu Noodle Bar, Kinton, Kenzo, sensotei, santouko and on and on and on. There's no room for bad ramen in Toronto any more."}
{"text":"Came to this location 50mins before they close and told us that the last call is at 11:10. We asked if the last call is 11:10 everyday and the servers said yes. Why would the store closing sign says they close at 12 if the last call is 11:10? Doesn't make sense at all. Very poor customer service. Would not recommend this location."}
{"text":"Their spicy beef ramen is a MUST! I crave it so often - it's delicious! Their service is excellent as well! This place is small but comfortable and also tends to be busy! I do usually wait to be seated! However, it's definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"It was pretty good!!  They had tons of noodle choices, but I wish they had descriptions. I think I was annoying the waiter with all my questions....  Small cute restaurant. Wouldn't recommend if you're cloister phobic. You often have to share seats. The portions were nice and big! Filled me up. Great tasting food.  Recommended!"}
{"text":"Had the Shoyu ramen with pork belly. Noodles were on the chewy side which I prefer. Broth was tasty but waaaaaaaay too salty for my liking. Price reasonable. Service good.   Returned for a second visit and had the tonkotsu ramen with pork rib. Noodle was still good but the broth was much improved from my first visit. Way less salty than before allowing the broth flavour to come through.   3 1/2 stars"}
{"text":"I have been to Ajisen 2 times.  Both times on recommendations by friends that this place has good noodles (ramen).  My experiences both times have been terrible.  My first visit, I ordered a Kojo (might be Kojun) sea salt & pork ramen.  The soup was way WAY too salty, making the entire meal very difficult to eat.  The other ingredients in the ramen were BBQ pork (limited portions), a handful of mix veggies, and half of an egg.  Overall, I was unimpressed, but I thought maybe it was the salt that made the overall meal too salty.  Hence I went to try a second time when some friends suggested Ajisen.  I ordered a vegetarian Ramen this time hoping for better food, but the result was similarly terrible.  The ramen itself was ok, but the soup was again way WAY too salty.  It tasted like a just took my box of salt and a big spoon and scoop 2 spoons of salt into the soup!  It was so salty the other taste of the noodles and vegetables were pretty much covered up.  If I had wanted bad ramen, I can just go buy a box from the supermarket and make it myself.  No need to come to Ajisen and spend $8-10 for a bowl of Ramen.  Bottom line: I think this place is terrible and would not go back here to eat.  1.0/5.0"}
{"text":"Pretty good experience, you may find that this location may be hard to find because the front of the establishment looks very similar to the surrounding area and is not very particular.  So Ive only been to this location once but I was with a medium sized group and was able to see the quality of food by the four dishes that were served. The ramen I had was salty pork and, despite its name, was not overly salty! Rather, it was a deliciously savoury! If you're looking for a quiet intimate place to eat for lunch or dinner, this may not be the right place for you. However, if you don't mind a little noise coming on the side with your dish, then Ajisen may be the place for you!"}
{"text":"I'm usually not one to go against the grain when it comes to ramen. I've been around the block and sampled the noodles in NYC, Boston, SF, LA, Vancouver and Toronto joints in search of the ultimate bowl.  Ajisen isn't great but I'm going out on a limb and saying in Toronto, it's definitely passable. Maybe even above average in a severely disappointing market. Stick with the ramen with miso and pork and you'll leave satisfied. The ramen aren't authentic but the noodles are reasonable. The pork trimmings are tasty and the miso soup, while being salty, still packs good flavours."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places for ramen. I love TOMYUM flavour as you know in most of my reviews. The steak TomYum is amazing, curry is amazing too also must try the Tom Yum rice! Incredible !!!! Great on cold nights. Service is average depending on how late you go. Highly recommended if you want to try something alternative to the classic miso broth. Reminder parking is not free, only after 10pm I believe."}
{"text":"Definitely great for a quick bowl of ramen  I wouldn't say it's authentic bone boiled ramen but it's delicious for something quick and hot.  The soup base is a little bit too msg-y for my taste but after all, Ajisen is considered the fast food version of ramen. Nevertheless the taste never disappoints !"}
{"text":"Provide good quality ramen at a fair price. The ramen itself came in at just under $10 while additional sides/appetizers were around $5 each.  The ramen was very tasty, the noodles were a nicer texture than other ramen restaurants while all of the other topping were on point. The portion size is also good for the price you pay. Side dishes were also good, ordered gyoza and chicken teppanyaki which were both worth the price.  Lastly, the restaurant itself is nicely furnished with lots of available seating. Service was efficient and accurate. Overall, I would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Chicken Teppanyaki every single time! I love coming here for the delicious food but sometimes the service isn't good. It's always crowded when I go but I never wait too long, it's well worth it."}
{"text":"Pretty good Ramen Place. Tons of options and flavors. You can also pick how spicy you want your ramen to be. They also had a bunch of appetizers, edamame, gyzo, seaweed salad, and a bunch more. They are located right on Spadina in Chinatown. Cheap dinner or lunch option."}
{"text":"I use to like this place. I called to see if I can order take out, I asked the women on the phone if they have an online menu and she said no. I asked if I can get a menu faxed and she said no, and she said I can stop by and get a menu. I asked \" so what you're saying is that I can't order because I don't have a menu\" she said yes, you can't order.   What stone age are these people living in???  Get with the program people!  They just lost a very loyal customer. They get an F for no effort."}
{"text":"Very tasty ramen, and udon noodles, will be back again. We were there around 4:30, and it got really busy after 5.  Only reason for 4 stars, back area where washrooms are (including washrooms) are quite dirty, but the front of the store and the kitchen (visible from the seating area) are okay."}
{"text":"I only have been here two time both times with my girlfriend. The service is always amazing however I do have to ask the waitress when I am ready to order. I do eat out alot and this is nice touch that I do not get hounded down every 2 minutes if I am ready to order.   Both times I got the Miso Pork Ramen and my girlfriend both times got the Shrimp Tempura Ramen. The broth is really good not salty like other people on Yelp are claiming.   I ate Ramen in many places all good in their own way but this is the only place I think that I will keep coming back to. Just to put it in perspective I live about a 15-30 mins drive away depending on traffic on the 401, and I will make that drive daily just for their Ramen.   This is my first Yelp review and some people care about how it looks inside. Well it is very sleek. very modern look, looks very clean, and yep...   Just make sure when you are ready to order to flag a waitress and get your EAT ON!"}
{"text":"Very ordinary ramen place. Got this spicy beef ramen during lunch time. It was pretty spicy. Food arrives quick and this place is not really busy even during a week day lunch time. However I would still recommend for a quick bite or if you wanna sit there and just chat with your friends while enjoying your ramen. Parking at this plaza is hard because it's definitely a Chinese plaza, so be very careful."}
{"text":"This is our new weekly lunch out.  Always friendly and the food is always great. Slowly making our way through each of the various dishes."}
{"text":"Great service and good ramen. There was a missing ingredient for the seafood ramen and I didn't even notice but the waiter brought it in a plate. The manager also served an appetizer on the house! Amazing service!"}
{"text":"Got the kimchi pork ramen. Quick service considering that I went right as they were opening. The ramen was decently portion was not really spicy you can also add kimchi to your tasting. Hallway leading to washrooms have some quirky notes, read them for laugh.  The TV was also showing a drama where an ajisen was featured. Didn't really understand it as audio was off and sub was chinese for some reason, maybe cause they were located in chinatown"}
{"text":"Not trying to sound like a snob, but if ur looking for Japanese style ramen this ain't it.  You should be able to tell when the bowl comes out with the egg cooked all the way through. Service was also not that good!"}
{"text":"Lack of communication for servers, been waiting for my pop till the end of my meal, not evening a soy sauces. Spadina is way better!"}
{"text":"As far as the chain goes, it is pretty decent (3/3.5 stars). It is not the best I have had but the broth and toppings are tasty enough.  It should be noted that this particular location is newly opened and really is not quite as good as the other locations yet. This was obvious during my visit last night.  Normally when I order the most popular ramen (soft pork ribs), it comes to me very quickly, in this case the wait was noticeably longer. Also my wife ordered a ramen with chicken teppanyaki. The chicken teppanyaki came approximately 10 minutes after the ramen itself was served. They obviously do not have the timing down yet. This was also observed when the deep fried chicken knee cap we ordered was served long after my ramen was done.  With Sansotei Ramen (Highway 7 & Birchmount), Sonoya Ramen (First Markham Place), and one of the older Ajisen Ramens (Warden & Steeles) so nearby, it might be best to hold off on going here to get your ramen fix until they have some time to get their act together."}
{"text":"When I first heard about Ajisen Ramen in Toronto, I was ecstatic to try it. I remember how packed it got during the lunch and dinner rush hour, though the hype has died down in the recent year.   Whether it is a hot summer day or a cold winter night, I always enjoy a good bowl of ramen with a warm and comforting broth. My usual order is their signature \"Ajisen Ramen,\" filled with BBQ pork, half boiled egg, in a Milky Tonkotsu broth. If you prefer the extra kick, there is a spicy degree level you can request. The ramen had an added chewiness to it, which I enjoyed, while the broth is probably the best one I've enjoyed there.  There are other different topping/broth combination, including BBQ/teppanyaki options for pork, lamb, beef, chicken, in Tom Yum, Shoyu, or Kim Chi broth.  Note: Heavy on the MSG in the broth, so you can get quite thirsty after the meal. Once on a dare, our table ordered the maximum spicy level for the for the Spicy Ajisen Ramen. Was it burning armageddon? Not necessarily. I survived. No other casualties."}
{"text":"It was our first time eating ramen and I walked into this place expecting something like the ramen they have in japan or even remotely CLOSE to it  (I know I was just being hopeful), but in the end... it tasted alright to me. Nothing too special sadly. If you want some authentic ramen... this is not the place.  I do like how they made their broth. I got the Miso BBQ Pork Ramen and the broth was great. I barely finished my noodles since ... I dont know.. it seemed a little off because I expected the noodles to be different. Like a bit more thicker and chewy? Something like that. Am assuming if you have some sort of expectation on your ramen, this place would be a bit disappointment.  Anyway, my partner loved his order though. He said it was the best he tasted. He got the BBQ Chicken Ramen. Although I know it's his first time eating the cuisine... he had nothing to compare it to but still liked it just time same.  Personally, my experience in this place is okay. It's a nice place to drop by when you just want something hot to eat regardless how it is made. The price is relatively inexpensive and the atmosphere is quite cozy. The servers are attentive when it's not crazy busy...yet I have a feeling when the \"manager\" is around almost all of them seem to be attentive and their quick to give you what you want... I just wonder how attentive the regular staff is like without the boss around. lol"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the service at this location;the servers were kind, friendly and very attentive to our needs. Also, our food came rather quickly and tasted delicious!   The only reason why I am giving this place a four star is because I felt kind of rushed... we were handed the bill after the last person finished eating. If you're looking for a place to chill with friends and eat, there are other choices in the plaza. However, if you're wanting to eat and leave, this place is perfect!!"}
{"text":"If this is your first ramen experience, it will be good. But definitely not comparable to the top quality ramen in the city. The Tomyum is probably the highlight here. The broth is too oily, not enough flavour and the noodles are one generic size no options of thin or thick. overall the food didnt seem fresh to me especially the egg and spicy chili oil, a bit lackluster like its been around for too long. However decent prices and you'll get your ramen fix for sure."}
{"text":"Yummmmm  Not fancy, but definitely cozy environment.  The service is fast, friendly and efficient.  Keep in mind this place gets very busy during dinner hours so you may be expected to wait for a table. Price range for ramen or rice orders range between $9-$13 which is well affordable.  For beginners we both shared their Aijisen Dumplings (6 pcs.) which came with their soya dipping sauce.  Both Jen and I took our own ramen since we were craving it big-time. I decided to opt for their Spicy beef tepanyaki ramen.  Beautifully presented, with a boiled egg on the side, their portions are sufficient! Most of all the soup (stock) had a good kick to it, not overly spicy, just perfect. Jen on the other hand chose their Spicy lamb tepinyaki ramen, much like mine and not as spicy it was just as delicious.  Overall I think we've found one of our favorite local Ramen places, OH and FYI they supposedly have a Ramen stamp card where if you accumulate enough, you could get a free Ramen."}
{"text":"Be prepared to see a lot of pink when you first walk in. Hot pink seats to be precise, but gorillas of the world, be not alarmed and do not shy away. The rest of the restaurant is quite traditional and welcoming.   The menu is quite colourful and descriptive, the server is to the point, but vaguely polite. I ordered the Scallop ramen($8), and although the noodles were delicious, the scallops themselves were rubbery, and a mental image of Gordon Ramsey flipping out fit the bill to a tee. No, he definitely wouldn't stand for them.   The chicken teppanyaki($6) was well prepared, and came to my table sizzling. If you're going to try Ajisen, you must order the chicken teppanyaki.   As an aside, it always worries me when hot items, such as tea and soup are served in plastic containers. Do we not have enough information about the detriments of consumed melted plastic? The servers pour out green tea from plastic pitchers and the ramen is always served in plastic bowls. I hope they switch to ceramic."}
{"text":"Ajisen--or as I often referred to it as, the 'cartoon girl ramen'--is an international chain. Though not as big as McDonald's, I have encountered a couple locations in the Los Angeles region, and another way up on Yonge in downtown North York's Koreatown. I am however more familiar with this one in Chinatown.  The location seats plenty, and its bright white walls accented with awkwardly-shaped hot pink chairs makes me feel like I have stepped into a Japanese cartoon scene or something.  In the daytime, a Chinese man who I swear looks like a Yazuka gangster, is usually the one who greets you walking in. I assume he is the manager.  A lot has been said about the grumpy looks of the staff here. I don't mind it; you get used to it growing up eating at many Chinese places. But they don't check on you much. And they are so fast, they nearly screwed up an order once when the guy misheard me.   They have a ridiculously extensive menu. Ajisen offers ramen in less conventional broths such as curry.  Food arrives quickly, like ordering a bowl of pho at a Viet restaurant. And boy, it's a sad bowl of ramen they give you here. Usually it is more broth than noodles. Though it offers an interesting twist to eating ramen, the curry is watered down and I can taste quite a bit of an MSG taint. It was unimpressive to say the least. The wooden spoon they give you is also awkward and impractical.  Ajisen may be easy on the wallet, but you'd really want to be here for the hilarious decor.  {TTC: 505 or 510 to Dundas/Spadina, then walk north on the west side of Spadina until you encounter the cartoon mascot statue.}"}
{"text":"Best Ramen I've had...hands down...and my grandmother's Japanese and a Japanese chef.  I know good ramen lol.  Broth, noodles, spice, pork, PERFECTION!"}
{"text":"My first taste of \"ramen\" in the GTA was Ajisen, some where along the lines of almost 10 years ago.  Today, this chain that originated from Japan still exists in the GTA.  It may not be the greatest, but it does have a market that keeps it in business, despite what the ramen enthusiasts or purists will tell you.  My first time at Ajisen to the best of my collection was great, I thought I was in ramen soup heaven when I first had it.   But, somewhere, somehow, their Canadian operations over the years altered the recipe and now every time I find myself here by accident or because I got out voted by friends to come here, I always end up with a stomach ache a few hours later or the day after.  The soup is now very greasy, as are the spaghetti-like noodles used as ramen noodles.  It always has been in the last 3 times I was here over the last 4-5 years.  I can recall this exactly because nowhere else that serves ramen has made me sick.  Perhaps it's my age that prevents my digestive system from breaking down the greasy soup and noodle from Ajisen, or maybe it's the over abundance of MSG used.  Perhaps in my youth, I could digest the grease fast enough that I did not get sick.  In any case, this particular location is definitely showing its age with the ripped cushions, cracking uneven floors, greasy tattered menus.  They could use a renovation to \"modernize\" it a bit.  Still, it's a cozy noodle house, with attentive and quick service, still not exactly a true ramen noodle house though.   Over the years, they've expanded their menus to offer such additions from the Korean side with rice and bulgogi, kalbi, even chicken katsu.  There's also Tom Yum flavored broth.  You get a little bit of everything that is Asian soup broth inspired at Ajisen.  Careful of the grease if you're like me and can't take it anymore."}
{"text":"Note to self: Never a good idea to sit next to a bowl of Ramen soup that looks like a zombie prop from the movie 28 Days Later especially when you are severely hungover.   My Yelp buddies south of border, Janelle P. and her husband TJ hit up the mean streets of the GTA in search of good eats and when the invite showed up to join them for a bite I couldn't resist. Funnily enough it seems that every time I do get together with them we find ourselves eating Japanese food! I know the truth about these two though. As much as it appears they are chow hounds on the loose the real reason they travel north is for the love of hockey. I expect to see them a few more times before the winter has passed.   I was sporting a major hangover when Janelle sitting next to me got her Ramen soup and when she began to stir it up I felt queasy. Maybe I'm just one episode of Dexter over the line but I swore it looked like body parts floating in that bowl. This is supposed to be appetizing how?   I ordered Ginger Pork with Rice plate. I'll be damned if I could even remotely taste a hint 'o ginger. The only ginger in this place was the colour of the hair streaks on the young teen like waitress who took my order. The meat was slivered very thin, almost shaved and it was juicy and moist but it was completely void of any flavour or seasoning. If I wasn't already feeling the need to drink a gallon of water I would have asked TJ to pass the salt shaker.   What is up with the loud music? Ok, ok...enough bitching on my part. There are a couple of bright spots, one was price point. There was five of us there for lunch and the bill was less than fifty bucks. We sat there for a couple of hours and they never pressed us to hit the road. They kept topping up our tea which is great especially when you are feeling like I was feeling. Now if only I could shake the image of that Ramen bowl from my brain."}
{"text":"Great service and filling portions. The seafood medley ramen was delicious and also very affordable, as well as every other dish on their menu."}
{"text":"Best place for ramen!!!!! If you want delicious meal come to this location. Have been coming here for over 6 years - never disappointed. Love it!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best ramen restaurants in the World. It is not fancy or upscale, but the food tastes exactly the way it is supposed to taste. Really good ramen and good appetizers. Their original ramen is still my favourite. Will return as often as I can."}
{"text":"Came here twice. The first time was about 2-3 years ago. Found a piece of hair in my ramen and the service was extremely slow. Ended up waiting about 20 minutes just to get my ramen. The second time was pretty recent. Service was super fast and my girlfriend and I got our ramen about 5 minutes after ordering. The ramen was tasty and the broth was very good. It was filling enough that you could walk out satisfied and not overstuffed."}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place for a while based on recommendations from friends. I had higher expectations, and I have definitely eaten better ramen in Markham for the same price.  We went around 11:30am and the restaurant was almost empty. We were seated quickly, and our food came very fast.  I ordered the Spicy Beef Ramen (~$11). The portion size was satisfactory for the price, and the bowl was tasty. However, the broth was very, very oily and contained a lot of MSG. It also seemed like the bowl did not have much ramen noodles, but rather, was mostly filled with spicy soup. Overall, the meal tasted cheap and the large, visible volume of oil in the broth made me uneasy. I'd say you can find better ramen in Markham, and I likely will not be coming back here."}
{"text":"This is a chained restaurant globally. I came to this one long time ago. After having ramens at a variety of other newly opened ramen restaurants in GTA, I decided to revisit this place again to see if there is any changes on the menu as well as the quality of the food.  I came with the other two friends, so we ordered 3 different types of ramen soup base. The one I ordered is the beef plank. The taste of the soup base is very light and plain. I meant it is nothing wrong with it, and some people favouring a bit heavier taste can add some spices on the table to enhance the flavour. The taste and the quality of the beef and the noodles are at average. My friends also gave me the similar comments based on their choice. We also ordered the Japanese Deep Fried Tofu as well as the Black Pepper Beef Tenderloin. The tofu was so-so, but the beef was fairly tendering and juicy. Thus, I gave an above-average rating for the food.   The customer service was pretty good. The servers came a few times to refill our drinks and checked upon us a few times to see if we need anything else."}
{"text":"I was a fan of the broth and the brown-ish egg but I was not a fan of the miniscule amount of pork I got (like 4-5 slices) and the noodles. It tasted like pasta...I mean, sorry maybe I don't understand the difference but if it tastes like pasta - tis pasta!!!! It was thick and I can't say that I was blown away by anything in particular.  Abbas got the 200 degree and his was waaaay too spicy for me. I got something like 50 or 100? Kimchi BBQ Pork ramen. it was perfect. (I know this review is like 2-3 months overdue...oops?)  We also got the chicken wings for apps and they were DEEELISH!   The decor was a little bit nauseating at first but it kind of grows on you. It's like a really cute Japanese girl threw up bunnies and unicorns all over the place. And they're all pink. Sorta cute after a while!  It wasn't that busy when we went. I think think place would be great on a nippy night. I would go for this or Pho OR Hot Pot. Need to try more ramen places to be able to compare 100% but I wasn't blown away overall."}
{"text":"Nice and cheap, but the soup has a lot of msg. My cup had lipstick still on it and my bowl was a little dirty on the edges. Overall it's decent"}
{"text":"I honestly don't understand how this ramen joint have customers when there are so many other ramen places nearby for customers to choose from. I am not saying their food is that bad, but their service is...  This joint is fairly big compared to other ramen places nearby, they can seat a lot during peak hours. I came here during peak lunch hours and I was surprised we were seated immediately given the fact we had a big group.   We were seated immediately, however, what is the point of being seated if you are not given a menu to order? My group sat down for a few minutes...no water and no menus...we waved down a server to ask for the menus, he looked at us and acknowledged. But he got too busy and forgot, or maybe our group wasn't his priority during peak hours. My group asked another server to bring menus, and he finally brought menus. But, he brought 4 menus for a table of 10. Are the servers that busy or lazy to serve us? He expects 10 people to share 4 menus, which will slow down ordering even more. The service was just that bad and I wanted to leave already.  Anyways, we ordered and got our food. The ramen here is okay. I don't find it that great. The broth was okay. I've had ajisen in the past and it was decent, but maybe not this location. Not surprised because they are so lazy to give us enough menus, and to serve us properly. I will not be surprised if they slack on the food quality too.   The lunch was filled with horrible service (or minimum service). Even at the end when we were asked to pay upfront at the counter, the manager/boss had no smile and she was rushing everyone.   I will never return here."}
{"text":"I had ramen, japanese hashbrown and gyoza. For $2 you get a side and the noodle soup is real soup not thin water."}
{"text":"Ahisen Ramen could EASILY be passed by, as the store front is quite narrow, but that would be a mistake! My boyfriend and I popped in here after a massage and we LOVED it!!   Upon arrival, the restaurant was actually closing up early but the kind server told us to come on in anyway. The restaurant was long, narrow and moderately full which we considered a great sign as it was 9:30 pm on a Monday. We were handed menus and poured hot tea almost immediately. What an excellent first impression!  I ordered the spicy ramen with grilled BBQ prawns and it was DELICIOUS! We were checked on throughout our meal as we enjoyed the laid back atmosphere.   As we finished up, we put down a credit card - the server was prompt to bring over our bill with a pleasant smile and even brought us a points card. I would definitely go back to this spot.   *Additionally, it was also very affordable. Great bang for your buck!"}
{"text":"Fantastic ramen place. Food was spicy as intended and the broth was very favorable. Would highly recommend his place."}
{"text":"I was really in to going here when I first found the place, but lately I've been not so up for it.   The dumplings are wonderful and I love them and I don't mind the soup. The service is also really good there. They are very quick to seat you take your order and check up on you.  The place it's self is very clean and has a very casual feel.  I've just found the last few times that the noodles are more like spaghetti noodles and I don't like that. I'm not sure if it changed or it was always like that and I never noticed before. It's kinda made me indifferent about going there any more though."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: cozy, good place for a quick eat Price : 9.00 for most of their ramens, their appetizers though I find are a bit pricy, for example: 6.00 for fried chicken knee caps, 5.50 for crab roe salad Food : this was the first place my bf took me to for ramen, so I do have to give them credit for introducing me to ramen. The noodles are nicely cooked, and their tom yum base is the perfect mix of sour. The only negative thing I would have to say is that their egg isn't as spectacular as Kintons or. santouka.   Overall 3.5/5. It's my go to place for ramen in Scarborough. Ajisen is a franchise therefore it doesn't have that authentic vibe as the other ramen shops in town"}
{"text":"My favourite ramen place in the city, which will probably raise some eyebrows among the foodies that prefer Sansotei, Kinton, and the like. There's more variety here, better vegetarian options, less wait time, friendlier service, and far more value. The manager who one reviewer complained about is actually super friendly. Overall, it's quick comfort food at a great price."}
{"text":"I've always been wanting to try out this place and I finally got the chance to last night!  The interior decor was very random and cutesy. All of the chairs in this restaurant were pink! I thought that it was kinda weird and unique. Never seen restaurants with pink chairs before, haha. On the walls, there were cute paintings of sumo wrestlers that looked like they were...kind of tickling each other? (That's how I saw it anyways, haha!)  Enough of the mix and match decor with the hilarious wall paintings, it's onto the food.  The food, was alright at best. It wasn't that bad and it wasn't that good, just average. I ordered the \"Pork Ramen\" and  \"Seaweed Salad\"  while my two friends both ordered the \"Seafood Ramen\".   I enjoyed my seaweed salad, it tasted just like how it should taste like. It was nothing special but I thought that the portion that they gave me was very good for only $3.99.  So our bowls of ramen came and it was time for the taste test.  My pork was actually nicely done and I enjoyed the soup. The soup wasn't too salty nor was it too bland, it was just right. The only off part about this bowl of Pork Ramen were the ramen noodles itself. The noodles were hard to chew and I felt like they didn't cook it well enough but I guess it's just a personal preference? I like my ramen noodles soft and chewy but the good kind of chewy where you can easily bite it apart without looking like an idiot.  Both of my friends enjoyed their bowl of ramen but they didn't like how it only had one of each type of seafood in it. They also hated how it only had about three to four pieces of seafood in it as well, talk about being cheap! Just kidding, haha (Okay, maybe not). This piece of information is just a heads-up for those who are interested in ordering this in the future.  The service here was terrible. I guess it's chinatown but some of the waitresses were very polite and nice while some were just rude and unfriendly. Their menu was extensive so my friends and I were having trouble on deciding what to order. Our waitress kept coming back to ask us if we were ready but we kept telling her that we still weren't ready yet. It's only been a few seconds since we've been seated, what's the rush for, lady! She comes back every 10 seconds to pester us and every time we tell her \"Not yet\", she sighs or gives us a very annoyed face. Talk about being rude.  Overall, this place has alright food for cheap and the interior decor is funky. Get past the crappy service and you'll be fine.  Is it worth the trip to come here to get some ramen? Not really because there are plenty of other ramen places around downtown with better tasting ramen and better service but if you're around the area to grab some grub, it won't hurt to try it out once."}
{"text":"In all honesty, this place has always been very tasty. Whether you're having the Shoyu pork ramen or trying one of their seasonal specials, it's not bad, but after a few minutes of eating, you will naturally feel the food is way too salty, the meat is dry as it cools (meaning bad quality or reheating) and everywhere you look, the restaurant is insanely dirty. The ground looks like it is only swept and never mopped. There are food bits everywhere and much of it isn't not recent. Worst of all, my wife saw a small cockroach in the washroom. Not to overexaggerate but cockroaches are not common in Markham area which can only attest to how poorly kept this restaurant is. I will not be coming back again."}
{"text":"Oh my god. What's happening? Luke warm tea, Cooks seriously don't give a shiitake.  Sent a plate of the sizzling steak, and it was literally raw in the middle.  Kimchi soup is to die for... Literally. You don't want to eat it. Had a really weird taste to it, and the little side dish of kimchi was very poor as well (Almost alcohol tasting).   Garnish for my pork soup was cold. Nasty.  And this has to be a good 4th time we've been here. Has dropped a lot in quality and standards. Really don't want to come back here anymore."}
{"text":"Not the greatest of ramen shops, but I do like the fact they are open later than the other spots in the area/city.  I also do like how you can get a bowl of soup/noodles with a side of fried pork chop at a set price. One again, I just hate how they garnish such a beautiful soup with the terrible mung bean sprouts..."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge ramen/noodle fan. Soup as a meal I consider a last chance food source before you turn to your pets for calories. But I liked what I found in this North York ramen house. Clean, spacious, and bright. I've walked past this place dozens of times and never saw it too full so it's easy to get a table.Service is quick and efficient. Prices are reasonable.  I did like that the menu is huge. Dozens and dozens of items, although most are ramen. Duh.   Tsuma: Have you got anything without ramen?  Waitress: Well, there's ramen tamagotchi sausage and ramen, that's not got much ramen in it.  Tsuma: I don't want ANY ramen!  Man: Why can't she have tamagotchi bacon ramen and sausage?  Tsuma: THAT'S got ramen in it!  Man: Hasn't got as much ramen in it as ramen tamagotchi sausage and ramen, has it?  Samurai: Ramen ramen ramen ramen... (Crescendo through next few lines...)  Tsuma: Could you do the tamagotchi bacon ramen and sausage without the ramen then?  Waitress: Aigo!  Tsuma: What do you mean 'Aigo'? I don't like ramen!  Samurai: Kawaii ramen! Wonderful ramen!  Waitress: Shut up!  Samurai: Kawaii ramen! Wonderful ramen!"}
{"text":"Toronto has it's fare share of Pho places, but is seriously lacking when it comes to Ramen. I'm not sure this place is going to fill the Ramen whole in TO, but it's giving it a shot. I've been a few times now. The food is cheap, which is what one would expect from a Ramen place. I thought it was perfectly fine as Ramen goes, but I haven't had any in ages and ages, so it's possible I don't remember what it's supposed to taste like. They have a big selection of soups. The place is loud (aurally and visually) and a bit cramped. I think that all ads to its charm."}
{"text":"I love ajisen ramen! I came here on a Tuesday afternoon and I easily got a table and ordered right away. I noticed there is a really great value lunch deal - when you purchase an entree, an appetizer is half price! I didn't personally get this offer, but I noticed a lady who ordered an appetizer and the portion is quite big!!  I highly recommend getting the BBQ pork and corn ramen, since it comes with so many toppings for the cheap price of $10.99. There are also seasonings offered on the side at the table, my favorite being the fried garlic!! It makes the broth ten times more flavorful, and even better THERES NO MSG!  My service was great and I managed to use my coupon card and redeem it for my bowl! For every $10 you spend, you get 1 stamp that goes towards getting a free bowl of ramen. I will say, I think it's quite a bit of money having to rack up these stamps, but they have a very long expiry date so it shouldn't take too long to gather them all up ;)"}
{"text":"Been here a few times and always had a good dinner.  Nice broth, nice toppings, good/quick service, and always leave feeling full.  This isn't really my go to place if I want Ramen, simply because there are so many other options now that offer better noodles or value. While I love the broth here, I am not a fan of the noodles. There's better options and the pricing doesn't seem that different for what you're getting. Just depends on what you're personally looking for.  Parking here can be a night mare if it's busy, because you're looking at a Bubble Tea place and other restaurants along the same side. But people come and go pretty frequently, just be patient. :)"}
{"text":"Was really excited to try this place because we have never tried ramen noodles besides the instant noodles.  Instant noodles would have been better than this place.  They had some afternoon specials, a fried potato fritter but it wasn't that good.  Overall the service here wasn't that great either.  I don't even think it's run by Japanese people as most of hte people were speaking mandarin.  Overall I would rather eat an instant noodle at home than waste money coming here.  Came here for the novelty and won't be back."}
{"text":"Best Ramen in Markham. :) Try the special ajisen pork ramen. Broth based soup. Good alternative for people in east if you don't want to go downtown TO."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. I've been to quite a few of the deemed \"best\" ramen places in Toronto (Kenzo, Santosei, etc) and I beg to differ. Ajisen Ramen is my favourite. The steak teppanyaki is to die for - so juicy and so good. The ramen is also delicious despite the fact that they do use spaghetti noodles the soup is absolutely flavourful and the portions are extremely satisfying especially for their price ($11.99 for steak AND ramen!? Yes please). I gave this place a 4 rather than a 5 because although the service is fast I find that half the servers there don't seem to understand a lot of English. We had a waitress come to our table 3 times slightly confused with a credit card terminal asking if we paid yet (um what!). Besides that, I love this place and will come here many times."}
{"text":"After the disappointing ramen I had last night, my stomach was craving something amazing.  Ajisen was close to work and remembered it was good, so of course I had to go there for lunch with a couple co-workers!  Service was good; quick, friendly and super polite.  After we ordered, they quickly gave us complimentary spring rolls!  The ramen itself: OMG! I had the Spicy Miso Fillet Mignon ramen.  The broth was full of flavour and the meat was nice and tender.  My co-workers and I were very quiet because we were too busy enjoying the soup!  They currently have this promotion(?): get 20 stamps and get a free bowl.  Will for sure shoot to get the free bowl!! 100% would recommend to any ramen lover."}
{"text":"As nice as it is to have Ajisen in the city it does not compare to Ajisen in Shanghai or Hong Kong.  The ingredients are different in Toronto and don't taste as good."}
{"text":"Was here with a group, and our orders were brought out in a very disorganized manner and were missing utensils. I ordered one of their most popular dishes on their menu, the pork cutlet ramen. The cutlet and pork didn't arrive at the same time, ramen came at least 10mins later. The ramen was good, especially the broth, and it was just the right portion! But the pork cutlet was really disappointing, too thick so it's difficult to bite into, and it had a really strong meat smell like it wasn't fresh. I cook a lot of pork at home so I'm rather familiar with the process you have to prepare the meat for it not to have that taste. Wouldn't recommend what I ordered, but maybe other ramens tastes better"}
{"text":"Worst ramen I have ever had.   They put MSG in their soup base, and everything was super salty. The ramen was not even ramen, it looked like some chinese noodles.  AVOID AT ALL COSTS.  I spent $13 for MSG chinese noodles."}
{"text":"I never get cravings for ramen but my friends love it, so I kind of just tag along whenever they go. Thankfully ajisen offers more than just soup. That's why I opted for a rice dish! I ordered the beef curry and I guess it was pretty good. No complaints. It wasn't amazing but it was still tasty. However, my one friend that tried some of my curry thought it was amazing.  It comes with flanked beef and not cubed beef, like I thought it would be. This didn't bother me that much though. It is a good serving and comes with a miso soup and pickled cucumbers (see my pic!). Overall pretty decent."}
{"text":"2.5-Boasting York Regions Best awards on the wall, there was expected hype at this place...the only thing I found was disappointment with a touch of mediocrity. Ajisen is not bad, far from it but either those \"awards\" are either fake or someone has no taste buds.  I judge ramen by 2 main things...broth and noodles.   The tonkatsu broth was amazing. Light and refreshing with a very full taste. He Ajisan spicy pork ramen however was so oily I was surprised America hasn't delivered a does of FREEDOM. There was a very nutty taste reminiscent of tantan with a varying levels of spice.   The noodles were disappointing. Imagine your first time with your bf and when u finally got down there all there was was a soft limp noodle. Basically my experience at Ajisan. The noodles were soggy. Lack of chew and bounce leading to a mediocre dish. Portion were small so I mean :/  Toppings were poverty. Poverty as in I wanted my osap to help them out. Chashu  was thin, chewy and very small in portions  Takoyaki was pretty good. Very nice batter to octopus ratio leaving small Foodgasms in the mouth.   Overall a potentially go to ramen spot if they get their noodles together"}
{"text":"Service was fine for me, but the food was not so great. IMO they have no idea what they are doing. I have been to a considerable amount of ramen restaurants and this one is one of the worse, if not the worst. The broth is WAY off and the onigiri shattered into dusts as soon as I tried to hold it. Quite disappointed. There are better options around for cheaper."}
{"text":"During the long, cold winter night, my body sought for warm food that would satisfy my hunger. Wandering through the busy traffic of Spadina, I came across Ajisen Ramen. Tempted by my dire need for food, I ventured into the restaurant and ordered a Tom Yum Deep Fried Seafood Ramen for takeout. I quickly drove home and began eating.   The first bite was heavenly, with spices that warmed my mouth and noodles that were soft in texture. Wiping tears and sweat, every bite of noodle and fried seafood was increasingly painful, yet more flavorful than the last. The Deep Fried Tempura Shrimp was crispy and complimented well with the spicy Tom Yum Soup. The mussels and octopus tasted fresh and delicious. After my long battle with the Spicy Tom Yum Deep Fried Seafood where manly tears were shed, I rushed to the refrigerator to drink milk (heed my warning of a drink on the side)  Ajisen Ramen fulfilled my expectations and satisfied my hunger. A bowl of spicy ramen cannot be resisted and my body screamed to eat- I obeyed my instincts. Ajisen Ramen deserves 5 stars out of 5. I recommend Ajisen Ramen to everyone who is tempted by hunger for spicy ramen."}
{"text":"Wasn't very good. The curry pork cutlet combo looked better than it tasted. The texture of the curry was very inconsistent and the pork cutlet was very plain. I was unable to finish the dish and I definitely do not wish to come back. On top of all that, there was no wifi. However, the lady who took our order was very kind. In all honesty, I do not recommend this place. If you do, however, take the risk to come here, do not order the curry pork cutlet combo."}
{"text":"For the price.. and the convenient  location in Chinatown where we frequent, Ajisen is a good place to drop in for a cheap snack.  Highlighting the restaurant is the broth used in the pork ramen; Although it's not traditional miso based ramen, it is flavorful and tasty. But sadly, the low life of the place is the noodles in the ramen. It's definitely not traditional ramen noodles, so expect more of a spaghetti texture when visiting. Given how heavy the meal is on salt (and probably MSG), it sits heavy in your stomach as well.  Although I can confirm what most reviewers have said about the staff being very off putting, never smiling, etc, we did have an exceptional experience a few months ago after seeing a movie downtown. We were late making it to Ajisen (about 20 minutes until closing) thanks to the streetcar, but the wait staff of two let us come in, order and eat inside. The last waitress in was chatty as we were finishing up; Not trying to rush us out (she encouraged us to 'take our time and slow down'), just being friendly. A pleasant experience compared to the busy lunch and dinner hours.  Overall, it's an okay cheap eats place. It is a bit more expensive than it was during their opening, and they have less noodles in their ramen now with 'extra noodles' coming for an extra cost."}
{"text":"Family friendly. Fast, delicious Japanese food! Generous portions.   Came here with my family on a Friday night. We ordered the curry pork cutlet set which came with rice, curry (with potatoes, mushrooms and carrots), a deep fried pork cutlet, miso soup and some pickled cucumbers. Absolutely delicious! This combo is my go-to as it includes everything a meal should have. A huge portion for someone with a small appetite as myself.   My sister ordered the Shoyu pork ramen which she said wasn't very good and left a strange after taste in her mouth.   We also got the beef teppanyaki which came on a small hot plate. The beef wasn't as tender as other places but just as good otherwise. We also ordered the deep fried potato cakes (aka croquettes) which came in two, sliced in halves to give 4 pieces. It was absolutely delicious. Crispy on the outside, creamy on the inside.   I have been to ajisen many times before, and will definitely always come back!"}
{"text":"2nd time going back to Ajisen. Service has always been up to par. I just ordered my usual: Assorted Seafood Ramen. There was no rushing, everything was easygoing. The waiter even came to check if we needed anything else. The excellent part of this was how they gave me and my two friends all separated bills."}
{"text":"I would say this was okay.  It certainly wasn't Tatsyu that we have in Austin, TX.  The broth was good and the pork belly was tasty.  Can't really ruin pork belly :) The noodles I would agree with another reviewer that they were more like pasta than Ramen but oh well.  The one thing I was disappointing in was the hard  boiled egg.  I was so ready for that soft boiled yumminess you get mixing with the pork broth but it wasn't the end of the world.  It was nice for a Ramen fix and since I am only visiting it was close and did the trick until I can get home."}
{"text":"It was probably -20 degrees Celsius here in Toronto.  My friend and I wanted something nice, warm, and homey in the area.  We were thinking of getting pork bone soup, but we were going to cook some pork bone soup that night, so we decided not to.  I liked teh Ajisen up in Markham, so might as well try this one out as well.  As per usual, I ended up ordering the Aso takana pickle ramen.  No complaints.  However, for some reason, I wasn't full like how I usually would be.  It was a good lunch especially on a cold winter day."}
{"text":"If you go around lunch time, they have this \"special\" where you can add $1 and get a \"combo.\"  You can add a california roll, crab and roe salad, tofu, or whatever onto it.  It's a nice little snack before your lunch.  I order the Aso takana pickle ramen.  This is always my go-to dish here at Ajisen.  The traditional one is good as well.  My friend ordered the scallop ramen, and said she was thoroughly disappointed.  However, the dish was filling.  The restaurant is quite tiny, so make sure you go a tad before or after lunch.  Service is okay, and turn-over is surprisingly fast."}
{"text":"I love Ajisen Ramen. The ramen never disappoints. Perfect for rainy or chilly days. The ramen is so flavourful and the service is speedy. The owner is really nice and when he's around, he often gives out appetizers for free to big groups. The location is near a Green Grotto and a Chatime so you can get bubble tea after. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Huge portions, very good ramen (try the spicy tepanyaki), and add some dumplings as a side... If you are really hungry!"}
{"text":"It is okay ramen.  The quality sits right in the middle of truly good ramen and Chinese style faux ramen.  The ramen itself is smooth and has good texture.  The broth is rich, but it lacks a wow factor.  The spicy ramen is really spicy.  Personally, I can take no more than 50 degrees heat.  The portion is generous.  The service is fast.  This place is great for a quick bite, lunch and otherwise."}
{"text":"This place is one of my regular favorites! The ramen is delicious, the selection is pretty big too. I recommend #9 it's my personal favorite. They bring the steak on a hot plate pretty fresh.  The staff is super friendly and always seems excited to see you. Of the three locations I've been to, young street, Markham and spadina, spadina is the best. Least busy and friendliest staff that really makes the difference. I always get good service.  Prices are very reasonable at anywhere from 12-20 dollars per person for a meal and drink. For the quality of food and service it's pretty amazing.  My only criticism is that the facilities could be better. They don't ever seem too maintained, not terrible, just not very nice. That's a small price to pay for the rest of the place though. I come a few times a month and one visit might be all it takes to hook anyone else."}
{"text":"Ramen is delish definitely recommend the curry rice and side dishes"}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time and it was overall a great experience! I got the curry and rice with pork cutlet and it was delicious! Pork was nice and crisp, rice warm and sticky while the curry had a pleasing aroma. I must add that the rice to curry ratio was a little unbalanced; too much rice for my liking. However, it came with miso to wash it down. A very cozy restaurant with beautiful decor."}
{"text":"Good place for a quick bowl of ramen if you're in the area, yet there are much better places if you're looking for quality over location.  Seating arrangements are a disappointment by being overly cramped. If you're not tiny (both height & waist wise), don't sit at the booths as there is no leg or breathing room.  Everything tastes very salty, but portion sizes are decent. Prices are mediocre for what you get. Stamp card is a bonus, yet you need to spend 120$ within a few short weeks to get a single bowl of House Ramen.  Service is good ONLY when the manager is there; when he is not on the floor, do not expect them to pay attention to you. We never got water which we asked for when we first sat down. After our meal, we had to get up & go to the kitchen window to ask for a waitress to clear the table & bring our bill as not a single one was on the floor for about ten minutes."}
{"text":"So I've actually came here many times. The first time, food and service was great. It was very enjoyable...the food is still good, but portions are smaller. The service quality is poor; slow, and unreliable.  My boyfriend and I had to call the waitresses several times to receive menus, our orders and bills."}
{"text":"The menu is extensive compared to an uptown location. although, some of the booths at the back had broken back rests... (Wobbly). Food was good, service was good. had a small mishap and the waitress quickly took steps to remedy the situation which I was quite impressed at. Overall, a good experience."}
{"text":"There are ramen shops where you take to impress your friends, and then there's great comfort food ramen. Ajisen is a humble, affordable spot for everyday comfort ramen.  My favorite is the \"Tenderous\" Ribs Ramen (melt in your mouth chunks of ribs), but the Pork Ramen also is nice, smokey and full of flavour. The selection is HUGE and it's all about knowing what to order. Some of their menu items are a bit funky - the Volcano Ramen is definitely WAYY too spicy (I had to spoon most of the spicy paste out of my bowl. But the service is great - they refilled my bowl to lighten out the spicy that time. And the other time, I ordered a seasonal special (Tomato Pork Ramen) which turned out tasting like powdered soup. But they offered to swap it for a new order of a different ramen - so I was happy at the end.  My boyfriend's obsessed with Ajisen, so we come here all the time in the cold winter months. Great comfort food at a great price. There's a special place in our hearts for Ajisen."}
{"text":"When we first entered the restaurant, the waitress seated us at a table with another couple already at the other end, which was slightly awkward.  I didn't really like how the tables were all crowded together and he did not offer us the option of sitting at another area, which was completely empty.  Additionally, the seatings were cramped so it would not accommodate large groups very well   My bf and I both got the ajisen ramen and all we could taste was the msg and the soup was otherwise bland.  I found the noodles slightly undercooked and there were too many beansprouts.    Will not be returning"}
{"text":"OUR ORDER: Corn Salad (loved it!), Koji Salt Ramen (yum!), Grilled Eel Rice (eh)   Pros:  - amazing food  - cute decor: different plate designs, comfy red booths, love their utensils (the big soup spoon!)  - convenient parking   Cons:  - I went in the winter: every time someone came in, they brought in a gush of cold winter air. - It seems like they're trying to copy Guu/Kinton with the whole greeting when customers come in/leave. They didn't greet us, they did to everyone else though, GRR!!    My friend who lives in Scarborough calls Ajisen 'msg mein'  which means noodles drenched in msg. It makes sense. Then again, I love their ramen despite the fact (once in a while never hurt :D)."}
{"text":"Just had dinner here.. reminds me of why I haven't gone to an Ajisen ramen in years.  Pricing is similar to sansotei ($11+). Both are pretty salty but here it's just msg and not much else. I got the shoyu ramen with bbq pork - pork was quite dry and not very flavorful. there were three small pieces. noodles were ok but lacked texture and springiness. portion size.. not enough and I'm a small eater. the egg I didn't eat... it's hardboiled all the way through and not like what you would expect in ramen. the meal itself did not come out hot.  service was courteous though our waiter was a bit absentminded - we had to ask twice for water and then he poured the water into a cup that already had tea in it (I guess cause he thought he already gave the person water before). they seemed a bit understaffed though it is the holidays. the CEO (his picture is on the menu) was working there as well which I respect. the booth seats are also tiny... I'm speaking as a petite Asian girl who stands at a whopping 4'10. if you have a belly or if you're taller you're going to have trouble fitting in the booths. the space itself is not very big but not too tiny - groups might have a hard time during peak hours.  Sansotei is a short drive away at birchmount and 7. Kiu too at enterprise and birchmount. In a pinch you could come here if you REALLY want ramen but I'd pick either of those two first."}
{"text":"We were in the area and decided to drop in for dinner tonight.  I've passed by this place many times, but never tried it until now.  Walking in I immediately noticed the nice decor, with a drawing of sumo wrestlers and an interesting ramen bowl collection on the wall.  The restaurant itself was filled with many little asian girls, as these types of places tend to cater to the younger crowd.  Tonight, we ordered :  02  Ajisen Ramen $6.99 R1 Grilled Eel Fried Rice $8.99  The first thing we noticed was that the grilled eel fried rice dish was very small.  The rice was mushy and not very good.  For the price we felt ripped off.  The ramen noodles however was very delicious.  The noodles were perfect, the soup broth was yummy, and the toppings were tasty.  I really enjoyed the noodle soup here.  Would definitely come back and try some of their other noodle bowls (they have two pages full of spicy noodles!)"}
{"text":"After having first tried ramen in Kyoto, my boyfriend & I had a really hard time finding a place back home that could compare... until Ajisen came along. Their pork ramen is delicious; hits the spot every time. The broth is delicious, the pork is so, so tender... it's my favourite place to go to whenever it's cold outside, when I'm sick or when I'm just looking for a light meal late at night."}
{"text":"The food is very tasty.  The place is very comfortable and well ventilated.  We were there for two straight days.  We will go back in the future."}
{"text":"Ajisen is the first place I ever tried true authentic Japanese ramen so I do have a soft spot for this location. The soup is amazing and the noodles are done just the way I like - not too thin but not too thick either and with a slight chewiness to them. I have been here countless times but I have really only tried a few different flavors. The one I always get is the tenderous rib ramen with extra noodles. Its so good. The ribs have the soft muscle parts of the meat which I love and its making me drool just writing this review. Also try the red baby octopus with sesame as an appetizer. The appetizer is a bit expensive for what you get but they are so yummy. Service is usually pretty quick and I'm usually in and out of this place in less than 30 minutes."}
{"text":"Definitely my favourite ramen spot, although my opinion may be off. In general, I am not a fan of ramen and haven't really enjoyed it at any other location. In all honesty, I still don't enjoy any ramen at Ajisen except the seafood or deep fried shrimp ramen. If you aren't a fan of ramen like me, this is a must try. It'll change your perspective!   In general everyone else I know that enjoys ramen really like this restaurant. Recommend you go to the kennedy location, more space and less wait time. Service is excellent."}
{"text":"~4* food ~5* service  Left a review long ago and its time to update with more details.   This is not your traditional ramen place. They have an incredible selection of all kinds of ramen, curries, etc. For the price you are paying, you get quite a large bowl that seriously fills your tummy.  The quality of each ramen is a hit or miss, but the majority of them that i tried have been very positive. The only one i wouldnt recommend is thr tonkatsu which tasted quite hard and unflavorful. The soup broth is not incredibly rich, but like i said they dont serve traditional ramen, but they make up for it for their creative flavors!  The service is always amazing. They are so fast and efficient, but never rude when doing so. The owner is always there and make us feel so welcomed!   The wall art of the sumo wrestlers are a bit weird though."}
{"text":"I am a sucker for a noodle soup.  Pretty much any kind as long as the broth is flavorful.  The star of the show must be the broth in conjunction with a boat load of noodles.  I don't want allot of \"stuff\" in my Ramen.    At Ajisen Ramen, I was able to satisfy my noodle soup craving.  I found myself sitting in front of a huge tasty bowl of pork ramen dialed up to the level of heat I desire. A moment of happiness envelops me.   Looking for some tasty ramen served quickly, stop by the Ajisen Ramen."}
{"text":"they have the best ramen ever! great staff, cozy and welcoming atmosphere. yummy takoyaki and yummy melon milk black tea with tapioca balls!!!"}
{"text":"just got there and i thought its was ok . i took the beef ramen and i was a bit disappointed with the noodle, i also took the spring roll with i think were pretty bad, probably frozen. its ok for the price but for sure they are not among the best!"}
{"text":"So this place I haven't been for a couple years like maybe 7 or 8 years? Until recently when I went back and wow its amazing! It was probably amazing back then, but I was quite young and didn't really realize how good this place is until recently.   My gf and I usually come here for lunch and I usually get the fried rice with green onions lunch combo and my gf usually gets the steak ramen and wow the steak is delicious. I'm happy she orders that because I get to steal some :) hope she doesn't read this haha.   The parking is limited as it is in the same plaza as tnt. It can become super packed during lunch time as the lunch combos are a good price and the food is quite good!"}
{"text":"First time here and overall everything was great! Space is small so wait time could be long."}
{"text":"This place is fast, cheap and easy! It is clean and good service!  I ordered the spicy beef ramen. It was spicy, with beef and lots of ramen. My only criticism would be that the soup is a little too salty and the noodles were slightly overdone. However, it was all very tasty none the less and portions are large!  I would definitely come back for cheap eats! This place is great for University students nearby!!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and so far I am very happy with my soup choices. The first was steak-something and ramen, and the second was...you guessed it, another steak soup, this time the filet mignon in spicy miso. DANG!! It was spiiiicy. And the filet mignon pieces were sooo yummy! It comes with bean sprouts and half a boiled egg too. Fo-shizzle I would order this again and again and again. But for now I'm curious about the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"I come here occasionally, mostly with my friends since they enjoy ramen so much.  The soup and the ramen are both good, along with the tofu with tobiko...forgot what it's called. Service is good too for an asian place. However, the restaurant is a bit on the small side. As well, the layout of the restaurant is terrible, agreeing with someone who mentioned the issue below.  Oh, and expect a wait at the best of times."}
{"text":"We frequent this place about once a month early in the morning so there's less people. Place does get full closer to lunch time. Service is pretty quick and the food is pretty good. Always get the #1 soft pork/tendon ramen and pan fried dumplings. Obviously not kinton or sansotei quality but still good and really the only choice around."}
{"text":"The ramen is not too bad. Half their menu isn't available at this location. Lame. Kim Chi is tasteless. Ramen is tasty. Service is weird."}
{"text":"3.5 stars!  This is a decent ramen restaurant in Willowdale. There are quite a few in the neighbourhood now that ramen has become so popular. I ordered the spicy pork ramen with mild spice, and man, was it spicy! I usually can handle a decent amount of spice, but even for me, it was a bit too much. For those who are sensitive to spice, it would be safer to get a non-spicy ramen dish altogether. In general, the broth was flavourful.  The atmosphere was spacious, many booths on the side with several tables in the middle of the restaurant. If you want to pay by card, you have to go to the cashier to pay. They give a few pieces of meat and noodles but one can order more if desired. My friend ordered a beef ramen but beware, the slices of beef were all chewy and tough so my friend didn't enjoy her dish very much!  I would come here again, but I'd probably want to try all of the ramen places around first."}
{"text":"This is ramen.  I've been missing this place since I left SoCal.  I think the one in Irvine is part of the same chain.  I got the spicy pork ramen and got it at \"150 degrees.\"  I'm one who loves their spice.  If I'm not crying and snotting everywhere unattractively, it's not hot enough.  This was hot enough.  Going for 200 would probably be overkill.  They do have free wifi, though the waitress seemed confused when I asked for the password.  She eventually found it for me.  I also ordered to go for a coworker and they packed up the noodles and broth in separate containers to avoid mushiness.  Good stuff."}
{"text":"The food is good and the side dishes are delicious. This place has more food selection compare to Kinton and Sansotei Ramen. However i still think Sansotei Ramen has the best ramen in town."}
{"text":"Mediocre ramen restaurant. Was once hype when ramen was still new to the city but with crappy service and barely passable ramen, I don't think I'll be back anytime soon. There are just too many much better ramen joints around the GTA these days.  The waitresses all looked like they hated their jobs and were not attentive at all.   I ordered the lamb Teppanaki ramen and octopus side. The ramen didn't compare in terms of texture, soup seemed heavy on msg and the lamb was like hotpot meat. The octopus was extremely overpriced for what arrived at our table."}
{"text":"We came during peak hours, and were greeted and seated in a matter of 15 minutes. I ordered the curry ramen and my friend had ramen with pork.  My broth had a nice balance of curry flavour and traditional seasoning. The pork was very fatty and not too my friend's liking. This was brought to the manager's attention, who graciously replaced the pork cut with a less fatty cut. Talk about excellent customer service! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've been here a lot as my boyfriend is quite a ramen addict. The ramen here is so flavorful, the first sip of the broth makes me feel like I'm drinking broth cubes in liquid form.  The ramen topped with steak fillet mignon for instance, its broth also literally tastes like steak cooked beef (as opposed to it tasting plainly like beef as you'd expect broth cooked with beef for a long time). I get that they're infusing the flavour in the broth but I guess they don't care if they customers are drinking a huge pool of sodium so long as they keep their business running."}
{"text":"Not super authentic but was good and quick... Not over flavoured there's a place down the street that is way better for the same price wouldn't go back but it's made more for the westernized palette"}
{"text":"Pretty cheap, tasty, cute decor, but the service was pretty shitty (the waitresses looked really unimpressed)."}
{"text":"Came here for late lunch with family. Ordered fried tofu, filet mignon ramen and corn/crab salad. All were very flavourful. Absolutely loved the corn/crab salad. This is my 3rd time here. Definitely would recommend and would for sure visit again."}
{"text":"Fast, cheap, reliable. Ajisen Ramen is just what you expect to find in Chinatown -- no-fuss noodles and efficient service. The place is cute. The winking girl holding a big bowl on Spadina is hard to miss, and the interior is adorned with colourful ceramic bowls stuck to the walls, a fresco of sumo wrestlers, and hot pink chairs. I've gone on weekdays for lunch in large groups and they are always able to accommodate us. The menu has photos. I usually get #38, assorted vegetable ramen. The portion is big and the noodles are decent (the straight kind of ramen... don't expect curly ones like Mr. Noodles!). I like the broth -- not too salty or oily, but rich and flavourful. It comes with greens, corn, mushrooms, and carrots. I wish they threw some tofu in there as well. For $1.50 you can add a side dish. The gyoza comes with 4 juicy pieces. Other options include fried tofu or potato croquettes. You can also add bubble tea for $2.79 (it is cheaper when ordered with a meal than if you order bubble tea alone). It's not by any means the best ramen in the city, but it's respectable and a good option if you are in the neighbourhood and suddenly get hungry!"}
{"text":"I love Ajisen--I spent about three out of five days of the week here when I was in high school. I eventually ended up having my 17th birthday party here and had about 30 people invade the place--the waitresses were really nice and decorated the restaurant with banners and birthday swag saying \"Happy 18th Birthday\"! Everyone here has always been cordial with me and orders come pretty quickly. I also love the pink...everything! I definitely wakes me up. Food is pretty mediocre, I have to say. For around 5-10 you get a large bowl of ramen that will fill you up. What else can I say? I also recommend trying some of the snacks/sides as they are pretty good."}
{"text":"The location in Chinatown is super cute - definitely has that kawaii Japanese vibe to it, in a tacky, cramped sort of way. Brighhhht pink chairs, some of them extensively duct taped to cover holes. The ramen menu is extensive and kind of confusing - they have pictures on top of the names, but no descriptions, so if you're not familiar with ramen everything kind of just looks the same.   I ordered a pork katsu ramen, and my friend got the Ajisen ramen. The katsu ramen came with a fried cutlet of pork, but was otherwise pretty plain - the broth was flavorful but lukewarm, and the noodles were not overly soggy but nothing special either; also, I definitely felt like the noodles were very sparse. The katsu was weirdly dry and tough. Something that really annoyed me though - the egg that came with the ramen wasn't the hanjuku egg (the soft boiled, tea marinated kind) but was literally just a hard boiled egg. Very disappointing.   However, the price was pretty reasonable - ramen goes from 7.50 for the basic variety to around 10 dollars a bowl for some more robust varieties. It is fast food ramen from a chain, so I didn't really approach with high expectations.   The service is pretty atrocious. The waiters are all a little confused, and seem to make frequent mistakes. They forgot to bring my katsu with my ramen, and I had to ask for it. Additionally, halfway through our meal a homeless man walked in and began soliciting from the other diners - it was a surreal experience to just watch the staff go about as if nothing was amiss. I saw the waiters make multiple mistakes with other orders too - taking orders of things they knew they were out of, or bringing the wrong meal to the wrong table.   Overall, two stars because of convenience and price. I can see myself coming back here for a quick bowl of mediocre ramen, but it's not a place I would send my friends."}
{"text":"If you want to potentially get food poisoning, then I suggest you check Ajisen out.  If you desire your fried chicken (karaage) to be raw and pink in the middle, then eat at this restaurant.  To call this place a ramen house, is disgraceful to the Japanese/ Korean art of Ramen.  The service as lacklustre and the chicken dish my husband and I shared made us immediately sick.  I suggest when you see the statue of the winking Asian girl with the gigantic bowl of ramen mounted outside of Ajisen Ramen, that you keep on walking... there is deceit in that wink... and your tummy and wallet will thank you later."}
{"text":"Very consistently good ramen. Soup is fantastic.  I rank it second only to Sansotei downtown on Dundas. Prices were bumped up a bit in the last couple of years, but still a very reliable ramen joint. I'd sooner eat here than the newer ones that have popped up along Yonge Street near Empress."}
{"text":"Perfect for a chilly day although the 25/200 spice level for the spicy ramen was too overwhelming. The BBQ pork ramen was just right."}
{"text":"My favourite thing I always order here is the spicy beef ramen. It's a bit too spicy for me so I usually ask for less spice. If you are unsure you can always ask them to put spicy on the side. Another favourite is the corn salad. I always get the corn salad with my ramen. It's good ramen but not authentic Japanese ramen, but still deliciois"}
{"text":"Ramen. A Classic Japanese dish that has its following for many.   In Markham I was able to enjoy a dish of this history in a cute establishment.   With a decent menu I was able to understand that they has some decent choices.  I like things spicy so I made sure I was enjoying a hot bowl of spicy chicken ramen.  The portion is decent for lunch and there is a good amount of meat in the bowl.   It was a good dish. Very unique in flavour and I enjoyed the noodles. The experience was worth the stop but it did not blow me away.   The place was very busy and you grab any seat available. Pick an item from the pictures and in a matter of 3-5 min the bowl is on your table.   I'm not rushing to come back, but this place serves a decent ramen lunch menu for the soup lovers.   Pricing is no deal here. For 10-15 per head it's on the high side in the area since there is a pho next door for almost half that and a Japanese all you can eat for $15 lunch.    Service is very average. Take your order and bring your food. No extra tea or anything.  I had to ask for the cheque and I walked out without even a thank you."}
{"text":"RUNNY. EGG. YOLK.  Whenever I go to Ajisen Ramen, I always order the tomato beef ramen which comes with an egg. I usually go to the location at Warden and Steeles and even though I thought the egg yolk should've been runny as shown in the picture, it has always been completely cooked. I shrugged it off, thinking that maybe they don't cook it that way anymore or something - not a big deal. The egg still tasted good, but THIS LOCATION GETS THE EGG DONE RIGHT.  Not completely runny but still oozes, the egg they make here is the best. Now I know I should be asking for this runny egg at the other locations as well because although though the tomato beef ramen is delicious, the egg just makes it even more satisfying.  Just one small thing has made this location so much better than the others."}
{"text":"Ramen is good as usual, once again I got the beef teppanyaki ramen. Ajisen Ramen is consistent with their ramen.  I usually don't have a problem with their service since the servers usually do their job decently, but last night was a little disappointing.  For one, I arrived around 5pm and when I sat down, one of the servers gave me the regular menu and the menu with the seasonal specials. I was reading Yelp reviews when I read a review about some $2 gyoza lunch special that apparently ends at 5:30pm. I assumed it was just outdated because I did not get a lunch special menu, but when my friend arrived and opened her set of menus, there they were - the lunch specials. Unfortunately it was too late to ask for the gyoza as my friend arrived after 5:30, but if the place is going to offer specials until a specific time, the specials should be shown up until that time. (Tldr; They might not give you all the menus they should be giving you.)  When the food came, my friend and I got our bowls of ramen, but her steak teppanyaki was missing and all she had was a sad bowl of noodles, corn, and bean sprouts. She asked for her steak teppanyaki and it came a few minutes later, but I don't understand why they'd separately bring her ramen and her steak if they're meant to be eaten together.  I like their ramen, but they could've been better with the service.  Tldr; Disappointed that I wasn't given the lunch special menu and missed out on the gyoza special everyone talks about."}
{"text":"Hit and miss experience. Used to be good.   Today I ordered the curry pork cutlet ramen which tastes good. Hubby had no. 12 shoyu bbq pork ramen which tasted blah. Soup is not even creamy as it used to. Both kids had shoyu pork sliced ramen which they usually enjoyed but not with the kind of boiled egg that was served.   Downside of todays experience is from the get go, we told our server to make sure egg does not come hard boiled. Well it ended that all dishes came in with a  hard boiled egg. I have to complain about it and she finally served the right boiled egg. Just not happy with that.  Feel that the warden/steeles branch is more consistent when it comes to taste. Soup here taste less flavor compare to the other branch.  Staff are not as enthusiastic as they used to be. Before, they would welcome and say goodbye to customers on every visit. Not today!"}
{"text":"Sad sad sad ramen experience.    I know what sort of noodles they're trying to go for, but theirs are WAY too \"spaghetti-ish\".  Too dense, chewy...actually I'm not sure they weren't really just spaghetti noodles.    Holy MSG!  Don't get me wrong: I like MSG, but my god!  A good bowl of ramen doesn't need 4 tablespoons of MSG to give it flavor!    The only reason why I did not give it 1 out of 5 is because I've had worse."}
{"text":"They now have a card that allows you to collect 1 stamp per bowl of ramen ordered. You will receive the 11th bowl for free!   I ordered the Ajisen Ramen and my bf ordered the curry fried chicken rice (he said the Ramen never fills him up). My bowl of Ramen came in about 4-5 minutes after I ordered it and it came steaming hot. The soup looks opaque white and it tastes -fine-. The toppings were of decent portion, the egg is more of a hard boiled egg rather than a demi-egg. The chasui is alright, nothing special but not dry. The Ramen noodles were o-k, nothing special and wasn't as chewy as I would want it to be. I didn't try my bf's curry, but it looked alright. It came with a bowl of Miso soup and a side order of pickled cucumbers. He said it was alright, nothing special.   Service was good and they were quite attentive, filled our tea without us asking.   Overall they are alright, but I would prefer to go to the Ramen place in J-town."}
{"text":"I remember coming here all the time back in high school/university when ramen places were far and apart. Now that a ton of these fancy Japanese ramens have moved into town.. Ajisen seldom crosses my mind!  Although the noodles here are not as amazing as say, Sansotei or Kinton.. I do love their tom yum soup base!! I got the tom yum bbq pork ramen and it was delicious. The portions are perfect. Ajisen offers a ton more options of ramen, toppings, side dishes, meats, etc.  Will definitely be back for their soup base :)"}
{"text":"Definitely a good bet for some late night noodly goodness.  This place is convenient, it is inexpensive, and the soup is good.  The broth is really tasty and the noodles were spot on.  Definitely tasty if you can get past a couple of flaws  1) Service, although prompt, it definitely is NOT friendly service.  The girl at the cash seemed annoyed that I bothered her to pay for my meal while the waitress was not all smiles, that's for sure.  2) Interior, holy pink chairs batman.  I think they got a bit enthusiastic with the pink stuff."}
{"text":"3.5 stars  Hubby got the regular beef ramen.  The broth was tasty and the noodles were nicely cooked.  The beef was tender.  I had the tom yum beef ramen and it was SPICY.  I like spicy but I guess spicy + temperature hot made it challenging to eat.  The broth was very tasty though.  It had a hint of lime which perhaps is supposed to counter the spice.    They only had a few pieces of beef in there, which isn't good, especially when you're paying $8 for a bowl of soup.  Add more beef, please!  Service was fairly quick, probably because we went on a Thursday night and there wasn't too many people.  I'd visit again, perhaps try a rice dish or something."}
{"text":"3.5/5 While on a trip to Toronto with my boyfriend for the weekend we are originally from Michigan so we decided to try a bunch of places that weren't the \"high end\" type of restaurants! So while we were in Chinatown we decided to stop by this Ramen place because it was highly recommended. Now I was still full from our meal prior but he decided to get the curry fried pork Ramen. Now he has been trying to find a place that had the same taste of Ramen from when he went to Virginia so we stopped by here because it had the curry Ramen he was looking for however when it came to the taste it wasn't the same. So although it was deference it wasn't that great of a place. But they do have a bunch of different types of Ramen as well as food so if you're looking for a noodle joint while in Chinatown this one isn't that bad."}
{"text":"I worked near here over the summer so we came here out of convenience. They have one vegetarian ramen option so of course, I opted for that. The service was pretty good and the food took about 15 minutes to arrive after we ordered, which isn't bad right in the middle of lunch time.   I really liked the ramen, there was a lot of flavour in it. And the veggies were added in generously. It's a very large portion so I wasn't able to finish it, but I would still come here again!"}
{"text":"Ajisen Ramen is sort of the McDonald's of ramen joints....it's a huge franchise started a long time ago with locations around the world and follows a given formula.  But like what McDonald's is to Burger's Priest, Ajisen is to Kinton or Santosei, not in competition.  Ajisen was probably one of the first ramen joints in the GTA before the ramen explosion.  I remember going to the original GTA location at Warden and Steeles when it first open many years ago and now I remember why we haven't gone back.    The ramen here is okay, cheap and does the job.  Its definitely not authentic as the spicy broth has Sichuan peppercorns, the batter on the fried chicken was almost like sweet and sour chicken and the egg was hard boil instead of soft and runny, so can't really say it was memorable.  The teppanyaki ramen was on the salty side and the ramen itself was okay but didn't stand out either.  Staff was polite and efficient but they definitely wanted to close early as people were turned away 25-30 mins before closing.  Overall it's okay if you are in the area but to be honest it will be a long time before we come back.  2.5/5"}
{"text":"Love it! Amazing soups, very flavourful... Only I prefer North York location: bigger and cleaner. However, if you live downtown Toronto this place is really good. Ramen portions are very big. Big enough to share if you are not starving. You may also ask for \"no noodles\" option, or replace it with veggies. I usually order original Ramer with veggies or Chicken Teppanyaki Ramen. They also have delicious sushi, gyozas, fried rice, etc. And the Bubble teas are one of my favorites. So delicious, must try. Will be coming back again.. and again. Ajisen Ramen restaurants can be also found around the world. I have visited Ajisen Ramen in Melbourne (Australia), Shanghai and Hong Kong. The same deliciousness!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry, but I don't understand how this place has a 3 star avg. rating.  The atmosphere is amazing, and feels like Japan. The servers are super nice and ALWAYS on the ball. And I've tried almost every Ramen dish in the menu...they are all great. This is the perfect place for beginners of Ramen."}
{"text":"My wife was hungry for noodles so we decided to come here. We got a seat right away. My wife had the beef ramen and I had the pork cutlet.  My order came with a side of soup and some sweet marinated cucumbers. My wife found her ramen delicious with just the right amount of ingredients. My pork was also delicious. My wife also ordered spicy dumplings which she enjoyed but was too spicy for me. The total price was very reasonable and the service was friendly and quick."}
{"text":"After having spent a while in Hong Kong before returning to Toronto, I was pleasantly surprised to find an Ajisen Ramen just down the road from a major Toronto attraction (that shall remain nameless, but has something to do with a certain province's formal showing of pretty painted and sculpted things) shortly after my return.  I can highly recommend the shoyu broth- it's a little thicker than standard soup broth and definitely tastes better. (I'm convinced it was part turkey, but can't be sure.) MSG is a favourite flavouring, so don't forget to order something to wash it all down with regardless of what you order.  Expect to be seated at a table in what looks like cafeteria-style sealing that was semi-reminiscent of Salad King. Service was efficient and impersonal. Prices rather reasonable for lunch, but remember, it's still just a big bowl of soup."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with some friends a couple of weeks ago. They all enjoyed the ramen there. I'm not a fan of ramen so I ordered a seaweed salad ($3.99) and fried chicken ($5.50), which were both pretty fresh and good.  The service is a little rushy but they were friendly for the most part. The food came pretty quick which was nice. I'd come here again!"}
{"text":"A pretty good dining experience. I came in for a weekday lunch recently and wanted ramen with a miso base, but they ran out so I picked another dish at random. I'm not even sure what I got, but it had mignon in it and it tasted great. The servers greet and thank you for coming in japanese, which is pretty neat. Just raise your hand up and they'll get to you for any other needs.   At the end of the meal, you get a stamp card to get a bowl of ramen for free after you spend enough at Ajisen. Overall, it was a decent dining experience."}
{"text":"Really, it's a hit or miss. The sirloin ramen is definitely a hit. The rest like pork and shrimp temp is absolutely a miss. Well, its just an OK taste for me. I \"might\" go back to try the other stuff but I kind of doubt that."}
{"text":"A new experience with a friend who has a pretty tame palate - we found a place that worked for both of us!  I ordered the pork cutlet ramen, she ordered the corn and pork ramen.  We shared an order of spring rolls.  The only odd thing really was the spring rolls arriving after we were already into our ramen - and they were so insanely hot we couldn't really eat them for another 5 - 10 minutes.    The ramen broth was terrific - my pork cutlet was perfectly prepared - crispy, not dry.  Just the right amount of ramen noodles for me.   I may have overdone it with the fried garlic shaker but oh so tasty with some garlic added to the bowl.  The chili powder on the table could have had a bit more bite ... but it was too hot for my friend.   She found her ramen just right - she enjoyed all of the ingredients which is a great sign!    The jasmine tea was just right on a snowy day.    Service was fast and friendly.  The manager was also friendly and helpful when we had questions about the food and the display of bowls  (they replace all of the bowls every year - there is a display of about 20 of the bowls they've used in past years).  The sumo wrestler mural is fun and you have to love pink chairs that look a bit like they have handbag handles.   We'll be back.  A great place to have a comforting bowl of ramen on a snowy, slushy Spadina day.   (oh - the bathrooms are clean, though the stairs going down could use some attention)"}
{"text":"Yeah I'm a Duchess here. Who wouldn't be with their awesome spicy pork ramen? I've been to the North York location and the one in Chinatown. They're both solid spots to fix a craving (or a hangover). The portions are good size for the price. I've ordered the spicy pork and Tom Yum. The spicy pork's broth was definitely more flavorful than the Tom Yum, I do wish they added more pork in it though. The Tom Yum was a little cumbersome to eat after awhile, it was like eating a gigantic, never ending bowl of Tom Yum soup. The gyoza - spot on, nothing too special, but tasted the way you would expect."}
{"text":"Yummy!!! You have to try their tom yum BBQ pork ramen. Take a journey into Tokyo Japan as you sit in the crowded restaurant with no AC but with the best food I've had in terms of ramen. The servers are fast, friendly, and overall nice people. I always enjoy the ramen here and honestly you can't go wrong with what you order.   A big secret : order the corn salad with mayo (extra mayo). Sounds disgusting right??? Nope, so good. Zam"}
{"text":"I love it! Highly recommend! And their place has Japanese ambience.  And very reasonable price!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch during my visit in Toronto for a good ramen, and i wasn't disappointed. Their soup base just taste right. Although we had to wait a bit to be seated, it is still much better than other ajisen ramen I've been to in the States."}
{"text":"If you don't want to wait in line for a table at lunch, get there before 11:30am.  My friends and I were in the area on a weekday and needed something quick for lunch. We were seated right away when we got there at 11:30am. The waitress gave us the menu to peruse, and wow! there are quite a number of ramens to choose from. There are also appetizers and rice dishes as well if you want something extra or something other than ramen.   Now the place wasn't particularly full at this time and there were 2-3 people there to serve tables. When we were ready to order, I waved at one of the waitresses. She looked at me and completely ignored me. I waved at her again and she walked away as if she didn't see anything. THIS IS COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE. After flagging her down for the 3rd time (the other waiter/waitresses were busy), she finally came to us unwillingly to take our orders. I noticed she was wearing a Trainee badge, which is even worst, because I would expect her to have the willingness to learn. She was definitely the opposite.   In terms of the food, I ordered the Pork Ramen for $9.99. The portion of the ramen was good enough for me, and the noodles were chewy, which I really liked. However, there was only 5 VERY THIN slices of pork in the bowl. The soup base was SUPER oily and overpowered the flavour. My mouth became super oily as I kept eating it and it made me feel really gross afterwards. I felt like I was drinking cooking oil or something.  Move over Ajisen Ramen. There are definitely better ramen places that are more authentic than here."}
{"text":"I've been to Ajisen Ramen several times over the past 2 years. I usually get the boiled or pan friend gyoza and the spicy pork ramen. I tried the miso broth the last time but prefer the version off the \"spicy page\" on the menu. The broth is always delicious and the noodles are cooked perfectly with a bit of chewiness to them. On top of the good eats, I've always received courteous and friendly service. Speaking of friendly service... I went there just before Christmas 2014 and told the waitress I liked her Santa hat. Next thing I knew she offered it to me! (I graciously declined) A big thumbs up to Ajisen Ramen."}
{"text":"I haven't had Ramen in awhile. My buddy said that that this was his go to Ramen. The menu was pretty large for a small joint but I had the TomYum bbq pork and had a side order of pan fried pork dumplings and edamame. The broth was amazing and the noodles were so tasty but I needed more noodles. Kinda expected more meat and veggies also. But if ur looking for flavour this is the place. Good service and very quick."}
{"text":"Another great ramen spot. I had the Octopus salad which was a cold salad. It was served with seaweed salad and it was quite refreshing. The gyoza was not anything spectacular, but of course the sauce made it 10x better as always!   I also ordered the spice pork ramen. English was not the server's first language, so at times it was a bit hard to understand her suggestions, but she did her best to answer my questions.  There were 5 levels of how spicy one can have the pork ramen...now I'm Indian so I can take spice, so I asked for the 4th level of spicy. She suggested I get the 2nd level of spice. I said no I'll be fine with the 4th level of spiciness. She still insisted that she will bring it on the side just in case. I'm not one to argue she knows the food better than me so I accepted. OMG!!! it was soooo spicy. I was getting hot LOL. It was so good though!, but man she was not playing around. The food wasn't too salty or had too much sodium, so that was great! The food was not expensive. The average appetiser was $6.99 and generally the ramen were $10. The restaurant was clean as well as the washrooms."}
{"text":"I ordered grilled pork ramen which is my favorite. Prepared quick. Too quick that the pork wasn't grilled. It's cooked but not grilled. The ajisen ramen at Steeles is still my favorite ramen house in Toronto."}
{"text":"I haven't been to many ramen places, but let me just say that the broth here is AMAZING. I'm pretty sure I finished every last drop, and for those prices you can't go wrong! Plus, what's not to love about hot pink chairs? Also, there are so many choices on the menu! Always a plus."}
{"text":"I love this place but my last outing was terrible. I always go at lunch and it's the only ramen place in the area so I really wanted it to work and for the most part it did. The manager owner knew our group and often gave us great service. Last week I took my family for dinner. Boss man was not around and the service sucked. The wait staff were totally inattentive. Never refilled drinks. My wife ordered the Cali roll and it was cold and it came out in like less than 1 min. So I asked if this was freshly made. She said yes. So I said. You mean it was made in less than a minute? Why is it cold? To which she said it was made earlier in the day. And the ramen that evening just wasn't that good. I may try again at lunch but I doubt I'll ever go back at dinner time."}
{"text":"Heard some good things and decided to check this place out.  Good ramen and decent broth, but dry pork cutlet, steak and eggs.  May consider trying again but likely not anytime soon."}
{"text":"I would've given this place a better rating if they had better service. I've been coming to this ramen restaurant with my family ever since it open. The place has pretty good ramen and they have have a large variety of soup bases. But the service is horrible and the utensils are not that clean. There was food stuck on some of the chopsticks.   As for why the service is bad. Well, when you first enter no one greets you. They do not even acknowledge your existence. I stood at the door for a couple of minutes before they noticed us. We arrived about 9:50pm and they close at 10:45pm. So we have around an hours before closing. Right when we were seated the lady tells us they're closing soon and there last call is at 10:30. However the way she said it was not polite. Besides that we ordered everything pretty quick as we all knew what we want.   When the food arrived the waitress pretty much kinda dropped the bowls of ramen on the table rather than properly placing them. I didn't really like her attitude already but at least place the ramen on the table properly. The ramen is hot and we have children and seniors at the table. It's dangerous... someone could've gotten burnt if it spilt.   At around 10:30, the time that they said that's their last call. She came around and told us it's last call and just handed us out bill and told us we need to pay because they're trying to cash out. But they could've at least asked us if there was anything else we wanted before handing us the bill.   Overall, the foods good. The teppanyaki steak is really good. Would definitely recommended it. I also like the arisen ramen.   As for service. The Quality of service went down over the years. Service is horrible. The waitress have poor attitudes and pretty much don't want to be there. The place needs to get better waitresses.  Lastly, the signs they posted indicating where the washrooms are, were intended to be funny. But I feel they are kinda offensive and rude."}
{"text":"I love coming here! It's cheap and tastes bloody good! What more can you ask for?   I absolutely ADORE the eel fried rice. It's prob imho one of the best in Toronto. The portion is quite big & I often have to pack it.   The Ajisen Ramen is another favourite! The noodles & soupbase is just delish!! I think it's safe to assume all the ramen are excellent. Wish I could eat this everyday :D   Kani and Fish Roe Salad is another must try! It's also not too hard to make on ur own if u love it. Sliced cucumbers, crab meat, japanese mayo....if u want then fish eggs :D  Service is always wonderful and fast!"}
{"text":"After a Yelp event, my hubby and I had a craving for a high sodium late dinner. Overall experience was a 2.5.  Food: The portions were ok but the price has gone up a little bit ($2?) since I last had dinner here (been a long while). I felt the noodles could have been cooked sightly longer. I ordered the Ajisen Spicy Pork Ramen w/ 50% spice level. Damn it was spicy (in a good way). Made me curious to see what 100% would be like. It is definitely full of monosodium glutamate. But there are definitely better ramen places in the GTA in comparison for around the same price.   Service: Could be better. We seated ourselves and the waitress quickly plopped the napkins and chopsticks down. I was kinda surprised cuz who knew these fob girls actually have arm/hand power? When we asked for the bill the waitress practically threw it on the table as well...maybe they are cranky cuz it was late.  I haven't been to this Ajisen since it opened a few years ago. It sure has aged. Next time we have a ramen craving, we will hit up another place instead."}
{"text":"Best ramen I've had in Markham! The place is quite small and very busy but it's worth the wait. The staff are very helpful in answering any questions and for the quality of the food the wait is not long at all! I had the Spicy Pork Ramen and it did not disappoint at all, the portions are really good as well! Definitely recommend this place if you have a craving for good ramen!"}
{"text":"Although I quite enjoy the kimchi ramen and the chicken curry, I am utterly disappointed by the poor customer service experience recieved by both the waitress and the manager there.  My partner and I was dining at the restaurant one day, the food as I have previously mentioned is decent despite the inadequate portion size.  As I proceeded to pay for our meal I presented my stamp card of 13 stamps and requested to redeem the ramen as I have now collected enough stamps for the redemption.  She went to the cash registry and spoke with a female staff and came back advising us that we cannot redeem the free ramen until next time.  I was puzzled and asked for clarification.Her explanation was \"that's how it works\".  Unsatisfied with her response, I inquired even further why this is the case and if it was indicated anywhere on their stamp card.  She seemed frustrated and my simple request was then elevated to the restaurant manager who was also hesistant to assist us with the redemption and was also unable to provide us with a reasonable explanation.  Although we were able to redeem the ramen at the end of the day, the hassle was very unnecessary and the customer service was beyond poor.  All I wanted to do was exercise my right as a customer!!  I have not returned to the restaurant since and would not recommend it to others."}
{"text":"If I could I would give no stars at all!! The service was beyond abysmal. We stood near the door for 2 minutes until we sat ourselves. There were no menu on the table so we just sat there for a few minutes dumbfounded. They were more busy cleaning the tables rather than provide us with a menu! One of my friends asked for a menu and even then they were confused whether they gave us a menu or not! I think they are confused as to what kind of an establishment they are running - its a freaking restaurant for crying out loud!! In any case, we lost our appetite after all these mishaps and decided to walk out. At the end, being a long time customer, I hopelessly hoped for an apology. Alas, I was disappointed yet again."}
{"text":"I used to live in Toronto some years ago but currently reside in Dallas. This last week I went up  with a friend of mine to explore the city and enjoy ourselves over the summer when we happened upon this place on our tour of Chinatown.   At the very least this place's ramen is phenomenal. I've been to a few ramen places in and around Dallas and I would go as far as to say that this is the best ramen I've ever had, by far. Pricing is reasonable, staff is friendly (though I do agree that they seemed to be shorthanded on fluent english speakers - something I didn't really find a problem with, mind you) and the owner seems like a genuinely nice and happy guy.  I definitely would recommend."}
{"text":"I walked in on an impulse, it was the restaurant I was standing next to when I decided I was hungry. Inside it's a little tight but clean. Service was quick and the food came even quicker. The soup was delicious and satisfying. The price was downright affordable. I can see my frequent diner card getting lots of use"}
{"text":"This place isn't authentic Japanese ramen but it's really good for the price! Everytime I go I always order the spicy miso pork cutlet ramen, it's literally my go to. For the price I pay which is 9.99$ I get a good sized portion of ramen and pork cutlet with my meal! Which is a steal for me. For appetizers I like their tofu fish roe and the black pepper tenderloin. I would recommend to stay away from the rice dishes because they're not that good. Everytime I come here the customer service is always amazing and the overall atmosphere is okay."}
{"text":"So it's currently 11:39pm and they close at 12. They are currently walking around asking everyone to pay the bill as the computer is going to shut down.   Let's also talk about how I ordered S11 - a rice set with steak. The meat came to the table but no rice. So I inquired about it and they informed me they are out of rice. If that was the case then why bother ordering.   When I come here and the gentleman is managing everything run smoothly and if he is out of something I know right away.    There has been other times I've walked in at 11:30 - I know what I want and I eat quickly and they refused my business. Honestly between the staff running outside to make out in cars (I only know because I got there and parked and there were two employees doing such tasks) and the lack of communication. I've grown to really dislike coming here. I used to recommend but now I'm just getting incredibly sick of the crap.   By the way I texted the number... no response"}
{"text":"I know this is a ramen spot, but I decided to order the curry rice and breaded shrimp rice set.   The meal was curry rice with breaded shrimp, miso soup, and pickled cucumbers. The curry tasted really good, not too spicy and not too bland, but the breaded shrimp made my meal disappointing. There were 4 and they were all really hard to eat! The outside shell was crunchy to the point where it hurt my mouth! The rice tasted really mushy and watery the more I ate.   Overall, won't be ordering the rice dishes anymore, but will be back for the ramen."}
{"text":"Excellent and very flavourful ramen. Fast service and fair prices. Will definitely be back. So far we have tried the pork ribs, beef tempanyaki, and steak ramen. They were all very delicious. We also usually get a couple appetizers since they are so cheap, only around 5 bucks each. We both enjoy the Japanese fried chicken and dumplings."}
{"text":"I love the Tom yum lamb teppanyaki ramen! Especially with the side of spicy pork!  The ramen here is really good and the bubble tea is a huge glass!"}
{"text":"I ordered the pork chop ramen and it was disappointing. The pork chop was overfried and had to be taken apart to eat, the ramen was just all artificial flavouring and the noodles were kinda too underdone. Overall, it was not a good experience at all. I will probably never return to this location. I suggest you find somewhere else to eat. Drive to the enterprise area and go to sansotei."}
{"text":"This ramen really hit the spot! Had crappy and expensive ramen on Friday but this definitely makes up for it.   Pork bone ramen: delicious.  Noodles were good consistency, pork was soft and chewy, and the broth was yummy. The portion felt a bit small but maybe that's cuz I just scarfed it down. I like the atmosphere, crowded but friendly and attentive staff.  This is my GO TO ramen place. $13 all in, that's about all I'm willing to pay for ramen."}
{"text":"As a visitor to Toronto from Chicago, we tried this ramen spot and it was within the top two ramen bowls I have EVER had. While the picture is my boyfriend's spicy ramen, I ordered the Miso BBQ Pork and the broth was out of this world. Service was amazing, and the atmosphere was personable and pretty typical of a cheap ramen spot- complete with the cutest little signs throughout the restaurant. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I love Ajisen Ramen! On both occasions I've visited, I've had the spicy beef ramen, which, (good for me) is not ridiculously spicy. It's just the right size and totally delicious. I've also tried the chicken and tomato ramen, which is great, especially if you're not feeling the spicy-ness.   The service is pretty good, the price is right, and the staff are happy to give suggestions if you're not sure (especially helpful on my first visit when I wasn't so ramen-savvy)   Other things to note: I love how insanely branded it is... every single thing (napkins, sauces, peanuts, tables, every page of the menu) has their logo on it. Also, I love the instructions of how to eat ramen on the first page of the menu!   For my first ramen restaurant experience, I am not disappointed!"}
{"text":"The miso ramen and salt soup ramen were both mediocre at best. Soup was too salty as it was obvious they used an excessive amount of MSG in their soups.   The ramen itself was too hard, and the eggs were definitely not freshly made as they were both rubbery and cold. The place appeared to be clean but we received dirty chopsticks, which were promptly replaced with clean ones. Service was poor and the waitresses all looked confused and overwhelmed due to lack of leadership from the manager on shift.   Food came very quick, but probably because its all premade. If you are a ramen enthusiast like myself, I would definitely not recommend this place.  The only reason it receives 2 stars from me is because the spices used in the miso ramen was well balanced."}
{"text":"Feeling sick after spending a weekend at a music festival, I thought it would be a good idea to find a decent ramen place in Markham. Too bad Kinton was too far, Ajisen was the closer option and away we go.   Walking into the Warden Avenue location it seemed pretty small, only fitting a maximum of 40 people. For 9:30pm it wasn't too packed, me and the gf were happy! My first initial problem with the restaurant was the service, we had to call our servers twice before they realized we were just sitting in our table waiting to place an order. Server came and finally placed an order of BBQ Pork Rice Ball, Pork Ramen with extra meat and Tom Yum BBQ Pork Ramen.   Waiting game time and we waited about 2 minutes BBQ Pork Rice Ball. Pretty impressed that it came so fast but really wasn't impressed that the rice was borderline stale and the appetizer itself tasted and felt microwaved. During this time, two people were seated behind us and placed their order 10 minutes after. 10 minutes passed and we got our order, seconds later they got their order. The girlfriend says that the servers or cooks don't seem to prioritize the orders whatsoever, which bothers her a bit.   Finally, the ramen portion of the review! Both dishes came and it was time to eat. Taking the first bite of the Pork Ramen, I realized that the broth was pretty buttery. Other than that, the presentation is similar to the picture! As for the Tom Yum Ramen the girlfriend says its spicy and the noodles are very very \"slurpable\" (don't ask). It tasted better than she expected especially cause she loves Tom Yum so much. Even I took a small bite of it and it was probably the best tasting Tom Yum I've had.  Looking past the service and the lack of prioritization, we give Ajisen an overall 7.5/10 for their presentable and \"slurpable\" ramen dishes!"}
{"text":"Curry lamb ramen... That is all.. Place is small, portion was just right for me and the noodles were cooked perfectly, with speedy service. I just love their broth minus the msg.. I know there are a lot of upscale and authentic ramen places sprouting up in the GTA, but for a franchise location that doesn't market themselves to be servicing authentic ramen and the price ($8 approx) you get a pretty good bowl of noodles. Just make sure to order a large glass of water as you will get quite thirsty after.. 3.5 stars from me!"}
{"text":"I love ramen. I frequented two restaurants often to get my fix. The first one recently changed ownership. It is now an all-you-can-eat joint and it completely dropped ramen off its menu. The other one that was a five-minute drive from my home has closed.   Today's mission? To find a yummy ramen place to call my usual hangout when I crave it. I have found it!  I have dined at the Yonge Street location a few times. The one in Markham is the latest addition.   I went in at 3 pm, after my dentist appointment. It wasn't busy, so I highly recommend dropping by during off-peak hours. The lunch specials are good until 5:30 pm, which is great for someone like me who takes lunch late.   What was impressive was seeing gyoza in pan-fried, deep-fried, and boiled varieties. I went with the former. You get three for $1.99. It was the perfect appetizer.   I then ordered the number 5 item off the menu, which was corn with pork ramen. I am a huge corn fan. It came with mushrooms, half a soya hard-boiled egg, three slices of pork, bean sprouts, and thin ramen noodles in a salted soup base.   The verdict? It was so delicious that I finished the soup base. I rarely do that! The portion size was perfect for me.   If you are a protein lover, you may want to order extra pork. I had gyoza as an appetizer, so I was good.   I saw a couple of customers ordering ramen to go. I will be giving that a try next time.   The washrooms aren't in the best shape, which is the only reason why I am not giving this place a perfect rating.   I will be back for more yummy ramen goodness."}
{"text":"Stop by several times for lunch or dinner. All dishes I tries were delicious  Very prompt service and polite Reasonable price. Convenient location  Stop by several times for lunch or dinner. All dishes I tries were delicious  Very prompt service and polite Reasonable price. Convenient location  I will come back tonight"}
{"text":"This is a decent small chain. The ambiance is pretty inviting but the staff, not so much. They have a huge menu of ramen and some other items as well. They also have boba tea if you're into that. It's not as great as some other ramen places I've visited but when you're looking for something to warm you up on a cold night when a lot of places have closed, this will have to do. We waited a really long time for our check. We wouldn't have cared any other night, but I needed to get to bed early to catch my early morning flight. Karaage goes by Fried Chicken in the menu so if you say karaage, you might get a funny, \"what's that?\" look."}
{"text":"Ramen is on point and love the fried chicken knuckle. Would've given it 5 stars if it weren't for their horrible service. The waitress didn't smile until it was time to pay. It was like she wanted us to leave right when we got in. But the ramen was so good that I can look over their horrible service. Will want to go back and try their other ramen"}
{"text":"The ramen was pretty good. The broth is tasty but not as complex as say some other ramen joints in the city. The hot springs egg is way better than the standard egg that comes with the ramen. The edamame was unfortunately old and sad tasting. The service was fine - it was pretty quiet for a Friday lunch hour.  We just found all the signs that implored the customers to \"say please\" and give them tips was strange. Perhaps they have had a string of horrible patronage but it turns off the new customers like us a bit. There's a lot of restaurant options in Chinatown and ramen options in the city so we probably wouldn't make a special trip back to this one."}
{"text":"Most Toronto folks think its okay.  I personally think it was great. The various varieties of Ramen served there was amazing. I could decide what to get. I was sorely tempted to order 2-3 various types just to try them out. The broth itself was rich and flavorful, non overpowering. THe portions were just right for a average male.   What else can I say? I was speechless at the end"}
{"text":"I often visit Ajisen when I'm in the mood for soup, and don't want pho.  Get the steak ramen. The steak comes on a hot plate, sizzling by the time it reaches your table. It is always cooked perfectly and tastes great.   I've had the assorted seafood which included tempura shrimp, mussels, squid, scallops, and a tiny pink octopus- which literally had me jumping out of me seat cuz I didn't expect that. It kinda grossed me out to tell you the truth.  Great prices, and the new \"stamp-card\" system actually entices you to come back for more."}
{"text":"This place put me in a pretty crappy mood. Already in a crappy mood before entering the restaurant I came here wanting to enjoy my first true ramen experience(I actually enjoy instant ramen) , hoping it would turn my day around.   Wishing for something to completely blow my taste buds, I was disappointed big time. What I expected was a bowl of delicious broth and noodles topped with a hearty amount of toppings. A dish to put beside Vietnamese pho and Filipino mami in my food hall of fame. Instead I got myself a bowl of spaghetti in flavour-lacking soup, topped with a couple of slices of pork, a little green and a hard boiled egg. It was a sad experience for this lover of noodles in soup.  The service was pretty good though, with my only complaint coming from my server not knowing what were the condiments on my table after I asked what they were.   I won't give up on ramen though. I'll keep my eyes and mouth open for a bowl that will make me a happy man. For now I must give this place two stars, not for Yelp's standard of \"Meh. I've experienced better\", but for \"Meh. I hope to experience better\"."}
{"text":"Ajisen is a great option for cheap ramen. There are ton of options (overwhelming really) and the service is fast and friendly. Prices are also affordable."}
{"text":"Service is friendly, fast, and attentive. Menu is a lot more extensive than Kinton and Sansotei. The prices are also cheaper and I found the ramen to be just as delicious as Sansotei's and better than Kinton's. Tea is also complimentary.  There's also a loyalty card but it has a 4 month expiry date. Earn one stamp for every $10 spent, collect 14 stamps for a free house special ramen."}
{"text":"An extensive menu that doesn't feature only ramen. For ramen alone, there's about a dozen choices, it is a bit overwhelming. The service here is very attentive and quick as they seem to be overstaffed in my opinion but the staff are no where near as friendly as the Chinatown location. The portion size is a bit smaller than other ramen joints but of course it is cheaper. It just leaves me wanting more noodles."}
{"text":"Again, I give 4 stars to this ramen shop.  As a ramen fanatic, I've been trying ramen shops everywhere I visit. Grew up in China, I used to go to ajisen ramen near my home all the time. It introduced to me what ramen was and what the atmosphere in a ramen shop should be like. Until its price continuously rose to a certain point that I decided to not go anymore because I believed I was paying too much for a bowl of ramen.  So I went in ajisen at toronto, after many years of not having ajisen. I ordered their most popular and the second I tried it, it brought me to back to the time when I was in China. The soup was rich and noodle was cooked to al dente. The 1 star deduction is due to its messy environment. It was like a zoo, especially the restroom. Also for the reason that ajisen keeps its way of acting cheap regards its promotion offers.  I probably will come back for the memory, but there are definitely more ramen shops out there for me to explore."}
{"text":"Great customer service, very nice and welcoming. Food was awesome too. I had pork ramen which is really good and my friends got different dishes and they said its good too. A must try here in Toronto. By the way, we are just visiting here for a day."}
{"text":"One of the best ramen places in Toronto! Pork/Lamb Teppanyaki Ramen and fried dumplings are my favourite items on the menu."}
{"text":"The manager or owner is nice. The food is decent."}
{"text":"I went to Ajisen Ramen for lunch and ordered the Filet Mignon Ramen which is traditionally served with the pork-based ramen broth. Since I don't eat pork they were very accommodating and used the spicy miso broth instead. The filet mignon was super tender and delicious and I liked the addition of the bean sprouts. I also ordered the spring rolls which was part of the lunch special -  they were super crispy which I enjoyed and came with a dipping sauce.  Ajisen also has a loyalty program where for every $10 you spend, you get 1 stamp that goes towards getting a free bowl of ramen. I went with my coworkers and since my coworkers didn't want to collect the stamps, they gave me a card with everyone's stamps which was great!"}
{"text":"The broth is to die for!! We used to go in Kinton and I've always not enjoy it but when we tried this the other night I finished it all. The portion is appropriate to the price of the food. Nice ambience of restaurant and good service too. We were able to sit right away when we arrived. The parking is a little bit tricky if there's no more spots on the front store. We will definitely come back and I guess this will be our go to ramen place in north york!!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location three times, it seems as if everytime I come here to eat nothing has really changed.   The first thing I noticed when walking in was how loud the music was, it was to the point where I had to talk almost beside the servers ear as if I was at a night club or an Abercrombie store.   The portions are not worth the amount it costs. I ordered the Shoyu BBQ Pork Ramen, when it came it looked nothing like what it did on the menu and was lacking portions of meat, I then asked the waitress which order was given to me, just in case it could have been a mixed order. The waitress then called another lady which I'm guessing is the manager. She was all super defensive and telling me what I ordered and what it came with. All I wanted to know was if there was a mix up.  The ramen tasted mediocre. There was a heavy taste of MSG in the soup and the noodles were slightly undercooked. Not to mention when the waitress was putting the bowl on my table she dipped her whole thumb in the soup.  When asking for the bill, the waitress threw the card machine on my table and walked away.  I wouldn't recommend coming to this location."}
{"text":"Second time here and its as good as it gets!! The choices of Ramen can be overwhelming, so many choices!! The appetizers are also very good. Service is quick, the place is roomy and all in all, a great experience. Will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Correct, clean and (pretty) good; but not lots of noodle in the bowl. And clients are not noodles!!! so add more noodles in the bowl if you want me to come back!!! (and I will, because otherwise it was really good!)"}
{"text":"In all honesty, my boyfriend and I only came here because it was late at night and all the nearby ramen places were closed. Not that Ajisen ramen is bad, there are just better ramen places popping up all over York region and closer to me. I think they were better a few years ago when I first ate there but after this last visit, we probably won't be back any time soon.  Food: 2 stars My boyfriend complains that the portions are too small. He orders an extra side of noodles and it's not much. I find that there is sufficient amount of noodles but...that's pretty much most of what I'm going to fill up on. I ordered the tender pork ribs ramen and yes, the pork ribs are TENDER (oh so delicious), but it would be nice if there were some other toppings other than bean sprouts and some seaweed. I thought mine would come with an egg but nope. None of the above-mentioned bothered me too much. What bugged me the most was that I found my ramen too salty. I felt so thirsty after my meal and honestly, my boyfriend nicknames me 'camel' because I'm rarely thirsty and I drink very little water in a day (REALLY bad for my overall health). So experiencing that sort of thirst after my meal really turned me off wanting to return.   Ambiance: 3 stars Brightly lit with some booth seats. Comfortable seating area. The place is ok clean.  Service: 2.5 stars Service was typical of Asian restaurants. They do their job. Really bugs me when they can't even smile a little bit. Any time I ask anything of them, it makes me feel like I'm inconveniencing them."}
{"text":"Loved the food. Ordered the Tender Pork Rib Ramen and it was delecious from the first bite to the late. Everything about it I loved. I was with 7 other people amd everyone got there food about the same time so there really wasnt any waiting.  The staff were fast paced and got everything we needed to feel the experience of the restaurant.  The prices were very very reasonable and the quality was great. I would definately go there again when im in chinatown."}
{"text":"Even though this was one of the first Ramen places I ever tried, I rarely come back here. The food just wasn't great enough for me to remember, or go out of my way to try again.   When I did come back recently, the service was disappointing - even though it was not too busy that evening, the food arrived very slowly, and the server forgot one of our orders. I usually go with the \"Spicy Pork Ramen,\" which tasted fine, and came in a decent portion, but I had some \"stomache issues\" the whole day the next day...FYI. Will probably not be back."}
{"text":"Service is extremely poor, food is mediocre. If I want to go eat ramen in downtown Toronto, this place would be my last choice. I mean, their ramen is on par with the rest of the Aijisen chain, but there is so much better out there."}
{"text":"Love their noodle and broth every time I go, no matter what I try, I'm almost never disappointed. This time I had their new tomyum noodle with teriyaki beef. The noodle an dbroth is good, and the beef was amazing.  YUM!!"}
{"text":"Whats more to say ? The ramen here is amazing. The broth provides an abundance of flavour, especially the Tom Yum. The staff here are friendly! They greet you when you come and when you leave. I definitely recommend the Crab salad. The restaurant's interior is appealing with its bright decorations, and seems quite insightful."}
{"text":"Ok - I have 1 negative thing to say about Ajisen, and lots of positive things, so bear with me!  The one negative thing: THIS IS NOT RAMEN!  The noodles actually resemble more of a thin spaghetti - and were perfectly cooked, frankly.  Nice and tender - but this isn't authentic ramen, so beware! (By the by, the proprietors aren't Japanese, so you can't be too too surprised?)  If you can get past this one, significant fact - read on!  It was a chilly, Feb evening.  My folks had just flown in from Vancouver (!) and were hungry.  We walked a couple blocks from their hotel in anticipation of some hot tasty soup, and this place didn't disappoint!  We were welcomed with enthusiasm, and got a nice toasty seat away from the doors.  My dad ordered the Shoyu, my mom the Assorted Vegetable, and me, the Miso with BBQ pork, and a \"Japanese Fried Tofu\" to share.  Everything came hot and quick.  Dad's Shoyu had a nice light flavour and wasn't too oily.  My Miso broth was rich and tasty, but not overly salty.  Mom's Assorted Vegetable was the third place finisher in the group - this is the \"white broth\" described in other reviews - and I think Mom would agree - it's a bit like under-flavoured salty water.  (She coveted Dad's Shoyu.)  In fact, Mom, who is notorious for poking her head into Chinese restaurant kitchens and asking them for \"Less Salt!\", asked for some soy sauce to kick up the flavour (Note: the bottle on the table is actually vinegar!)    Appetizer was great!  Expertly fried, and in a great sauce.  Will order again!  In fact, will be back in the future, any time I want non-pho soup noodles and I can't make the trek all the way to Kenzo.  I would stay away from any of the \"white broths\" options though; don't worry - the menu is multi-paged, and I'm confident that there is plenty of variety and flavour in the other broth offerings."}
{"text":"I've been to other ramen places, this is probably the best one so far. My family and I went here for sunday lunch. First the place is small, can probably accomodate 30 ppl max. But they turn tables pretty quick so wait times are not bad.  The service is really good and fast. Price of food is moderate for the type of food your ordering. I ordered the spicy beef ramen, and it was really good. Broth was flavourful and the ramen had perfect texture. And from the looks of it, everything is made to order. I would definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"Ramen bowls are huge! You will be bloated afterwards if you gulp the whole thing. I didn't order it, because they didn't have smaller portions. Customer service was great. I tried the shrimp (2 small pieces) with plenty of spicy fried rice \"Chef's choice\" on the menu that came with miso soup. It was tasty, but there was nothing special about it. The miso soup that came with it was too watery. Overall, a good place to try out if you like Ramen."}
{"text":"After driving around looking for food ideas in Bamburgh Circle, we realized we wanted noodles. My girlfriend and I were both tired and wanted a comfortable place to sit and relax while we ate, but the local pho place just didn't cut it and the line up outside wasn't worth the wait. Driving North towards Warden and Steeles we saw Ajisen Ramen from the road and thought we would give it a shot.   We were welcomed as soon as we got in and sat down in a cozy booth. I wasn't planning on eating anything, but I wanted a light snack. I chose the Beef Tenderloin and my girlfriend ordered Pork Cutlet Ramen. Both dishes came at roughly the same time which was great as I didn't really want to start eating until my girlfriend got their food too.   The Beef Tenderloin was great, exactly how I pictured it and the taste was really intense which I liked. Cooked perfectly, not dry but wonderfully chewy. The real surprise was that my girlfriends dish looked good enough for me to try it. The soup base itself was really rich, fish soup I believe. Didn't look watered down at all and it was really flavourful. I could of just had the soup alone and I would have been happy. The pork cutlet was deep fried and and cut in strips on the side. What really surprised me was that it wasn't over cooked in the deep fryer, a nice golden brown crunchy outside, and a moist centre. I was honestly expecting something dry and fried out to the point of no return, but I was wrong.   The only thing that I was not a fan of is of a personal nature. The spoons are made from wood, it's traditional but also appeared well used. I see wood as porous which absorbs moisture, so I am not comfortable using one after someone else has and especially one that looks well used. Would it stop me from going back though? Not a chance, I'll definitely go back. I'll just ask for plastic or metal utensils next time. And if they don't have any, so be it. I'll just set my own personal issues with hygiene aside and just eat delicious food. I'm still alive after-all."}
{"text":"[Good] Consistency - I've only ever had ramen at Ajisen and it's remarkably consistent in terms of flavour even across locations.  The broth flavours are rich and enjoyable.  Steak - Teppanyaki steak is done nicely.  The steaks come out rare on a sizzling hot plate and cook to just the right temperature.   Meat is fatty enough and tender.  I'd say pretty good quality and I would get again and again.  Stamps - Added bonus to get free ramen.  [Bad] Price - All items on the menu are jacked up now, presumably due to minimum wage increase.  $11.50 for a basic tenderous pork ramen.  I'm pretty sure it used to be $8.50 or something.  At this price point, you might as well pay $2 more to get steak ramens.  Prices are starting to close in on higher end paces like Sansotei.  Cucumbers used to be $1 and now it's $3.50!  [Worth it?] Borderline.  I would say the higher end ramens are still worth it as the gap between the cheapest and the most expensive bowls close in on each other.  The stamp card helps provide a little more value."}
{"text":"I got the Japanese fried chicken, usually get the pork cutlet ramen (fave). The chicken was really good and their ramen is one of my favourites so far. Not a top gourmet cuisine kind of thing, but definitely a place to go for comfort food. Their stock is yummy, noodles on point and the portions of their food is worth the price you pay for."}
{"text":"Back in the day this place was the only option in the area for ramen. Then I went to university and discovered all the ramen places downtown. Now, if you're willing to drive a bit further north or west, you can get much more savoury ramen at the uptown locations of those same downtown ramen places. In addition to better competition, I also feel that the quality of this places has gone down a little since I first started visiting. Service is lacking here too. When we asked for the bill we were given the one for the table next to us who had just finished ordering. We only realized after we had already paid and noticed how low our bill was. That's no way to make money.   I ordered a tomato pork ramen. It tasted like a watered-down version of their regular pork ramen broth with a few pieces of diced tomatoes thrown in. The pork was a little burnt, but otherwise tasted fine. Noodles were ok too. The egg was some sort of hardboiled black egg (not the Chinese kind) and tasted terrible. For appetizer, we had the deep-fried tofu and beef teppanyaki. No complaints about the beef, except that it didn't come on one of the hotplates as pictured. The tofu had a thick deep fried skin that double their size and made them crunchy (not a good thing). In general, I'm very skeptical of restaurants with big menus as they tend to not do everything well, and this place is no exception. Despite being so critical, I still enjoyed my meal."}
{"text":"I came here during the summer time, and did not enjoy it as much as I hoped to :(  I went to the other location a few weeks before I visited this location, and actually preferred the other one better. I noticed that the food was cooked a bit differently (since I got the same thing).  The actual location was a bit hidden - there are a lot of similar restaurants to it surrounding it, therefore you might miss it. The inside was very busy, and it took a while until the server came up to us for waters and to get our orders.  I'm not a big ramen fan, so I had the pork katsu with curry. I did not like the sauce it came with, and thought that the other location cooked it better.  Overall, I thought it was just ok. But may not come back here."}
{"text":"Was not too happy with the service but the food was good as usual. Prefer their other Markham location."}
{"text":"I was in love with Kington ramen. But act trying Kington multiple times I decided to try Ajisen again to compare to get a better idea .  Kinton : less selections only choose chicken or pork broth , then fewer selections of meats , chicken was like boiled n slices tasted boarder line raw. Sometimes kinda pink n nasty.  Ajisen:  wide variety of meats (from grilled steak , grilled chicken , fried chicken etc to seafood) even have plain Ramein with grilled steak or grilled steak served on sizzling iron board.   Kington: Ramein average $15 aft tax  Ajisen:  average $13 aft tax  Kington:  the waitress do NO speak English at all, do not come to yr table to refill water , do not come to give u bill. NO free Tea!!!! I ordered one , it come very bitter green tea not the traditional Japanese tea. U have to pay for it it's pretty pricey. Waitress will chat with customers for long time if a dudes talks to them about Japanese culture or hit on them, won't even look out for other customers. Always takes forever to ask for water refill or pay , one time we sat forever waiting for bill n forgot to pay n walked out since my bf had bit too much beer . Then we decided to walk back in to pay, the two girls were still busy chatting up customers , had no clue we walked out n were confused why we came back.  Ajesen : waitress have accent but constantly walking on the floor busy looking out if anyone need anything . They sever u free tea as soon as u sit down!!! Evey time I went to just get take out, as soon as they give me takeout manu n invite me to sit down for takeout, they sever me tea before I even order! And it's the traditional Japanese tea with very beautiful Aroma! U get to enjoy the tea while waiting for takeout order.   Kinton: doesn't have variety of food beside noodle soup Ajisen: has fried noodles, best fried rice(my fav is iron grilled BBQ chicken strips served with fried rice at side , comes with small soup n little sweet n spicy pickled cucumber as side $9.5) , classic soups n spin of Tom Yum soup base etc. I wanna try the grilled fillet mignon topped Ramein next! Also it serves very good bubble tea. It is actually better than 168 classics milk tea with tapeyoga. So ppl like my bf who don't personally like soupy things or pork flavours , can find beautiful stir fry noodle or rice for himself when we attend the restaurant together.   Kinton: no reward program.  Ajesen: they give u stamp for evey $10 spent! Once collect 15 stamps. U get FREE classic Ramein!  Wohoo! Me n my bf get two stamps at a time so we rank up very quickly.   One last thing. Kinton space is VERY SMALL! u are most likely waiting at door for seats for 20-30 min at busy hour! N ended up sititng on hard bench with strangers at each side, or high uncomfortable stools, or sitting at bar facing the chef. Ajisen u get to sit on comfortable seating with cushioned  full chairs or booth seats. Much cozier.    Over all Ajisen is very good both food and service wise. I am lately in love with the slow cooked short pork ribs on Ramein! If u pick something on the menu I don't like , give other things a try. There are a few things I am not fan off such as octopus on the starter menu, they were too under cooked n soggy . But the main dishes r usually quite good."}
{"text":"This is probably the best ramen I had in Toronto. Very decent pork broth and many choices for savoury dishes"}
{"text":"So I'm reviewing this restaurant as a regular noodle restaurant instead of a ramen restaurant, because compared to the other chains that have come from Japan, what they serve is hardly in the same category. Their noodles are tasty and they do have a large menu, but the prices are really too high for what you're getting. I just don't think anything will draw me back."}
{"text":"Ajisen isn't an ''authentic'' japanese ramen joint but it's as good as it gets in Markham/ Scarborough area. Especially its price point in comparison to famous ramen downtown like Santouka or Kento.  For under $11, you can get ramen with 6 to 7 different soup bases. The menu looks extensive but for the first time adventurers, let me break it down for you : pick  a soup base, pick your protein. Done. It's not complicated.  The noodle is lacking in texture and chewyness but the soup is definitely at par with many ramen joints downtown.   It's good, cheap, and the only one in the area."}
{"text":"I've been to multiple locations (including overseas), and I don't understand why this place is a chain.  Their ramen is sub-par at best (all the ramen I've had were consistently sub-par, espevially when there are better ramen places around).  Their fried rice was pretty bad as well. The vegetable in the fried rice was raw, and the fried rice was not flavorful.  And another thing I noticed during my second visit (I like to give it a couple tried before I post a review under 3 stars), the staff completely forgot about us and never attended to our table for water. And when we ordered something, the staff that we told went on break (she started eating in the corner of the restaurant) and didn't relay the information to the other staff."}
{"text":"Ajisen Ramen is a great Ramen Joint if you have some cravings for Ramen... great location if you are in the area..and it is opened till Midnight great for a late snack after eating at Izakaya in the area where no matter how much food you ordered, you still be hungry!   Ajisen Ramen ($5.95) - Milky Tonkotsu always my preferred Ramen broth based and Ajisen did not disappointed! - Noodle wise, the straight version ramen was cooked nicely with chewiness Bite I found it A-OK! - The paper thin Charshu and the small rubbery egg were definitely uninteresting   Ajisen Spicy Ramen ($7.50) - Basically is the same ramen as Ajisen Ramen but the waitress gave me some spicy ground pork to put in the broth so I can adjust the level of spiciness - It does taste better compare to the basic Ramen if you are into spicy!  Kenzo up the street definitely a better choice if you want a better Ramen and they do have complimentary parking.. but they closes early and have more limited hours compare to Ajisen Ramen!!"}
{"text":"Ajisen Ramen, not the best and not the worst ramen. But I don't mind coming to one of the franchise once in awhile. The selection of so many different items:  ramen, rice dish, udon and snacks, They may not do everything right but at least if you are picky or with some one that is picky, you will find something to eat.  Interior is roomy and with a lot of booth seating!  Beef Spicy Ramen ($9.50) was A-OK. Noodle was cooked al dente.  Opens till 12:00 am when most of the other ramen places are closed. Great for late night snack, as it is a snack portion anyway."}
{"text":"I have been hearing all these negative comments from my friends about Ajisen Ramen! About the noodles not good, soup loaded with MSG, small portion, high prices...  I have to say I am pleasantly surprised with my lunch experience here!  Yes the place can be pack during lunch time... I arrived around 11:45 so I got a table with no problem.  I really love their menu... all the photos with all the different choices of soup based... I feel like ordering everything!  The lunch special combo is good value for that extra $1 for an little apetitizer. I pick the crab and roe salad. BTW for the Cali Roll is extra $1.50.  For the noodle.. of course the Ajisen Spicy Pork Noodle ($7.50) level 150. I was tempted to try the 200... But I have to tell you 150 is pretty good... yes after 4 hours eating that bowl of noodles.. I can still feel there is this fire in my tummy....(is it a heart burn??)  The soup based is really flavoured and the noodle not soggy and have a good texture... The pork is really tender and tasty... but there is only 2 little piece.. haha.. it must be good if I complain that there is too little??  The crab and roe salad is really enjoyable... just love how those roe crunching in my mouth... crunch crunch crunch...  Service is fast and indifference... But it is ok.. typical Chinese service.  I will definitely be back again to satisfy my spicy ramen craving..!  They accepts Mastercard and Interac!"}
{"text":"There are only few ramen places I've tried in Toronto so far. Very quick service but place is cramped. The washroom? Hmm not so nice. I have been wanting to try the ramen here because I was told it's better than kenzo which I go to most of the time since it's close to my workplace. I ordered the ajisen ramen, some gyoza and their takoyaki. Takoyaki from kenzo was way better and the ramen too. It's a bit unfair to compare since I've only tried here once and haven't really got the chance to try the rest of their menu, they do have a wider variety of choices though compared to kenzo but I like their broth better and their servings are bigger. Kenzo may just cost a bit more but it's worth it. Anyway, I'm still going back here to try some of their ramen, who knows? I might like some of them!"}
{"text":"This place will make Kenzo looks so bad!  The doll outside of the store will drive you away and the hot pink chair may be a little bit too much, but the quality of the food and its price is where it's at!"}
{"text":"I am surprised that this place has received the poor reviews that it did.  I thought this place was pretty good.  The Pork Ramen was very good and filling.  I came into the place pretty hungry and I can't say that I was not full afterwards.  If you like spicy things then do not hesitate to try the dishes with the hottest symbols.  My friend who came with me ordered the hottest dish and it wasn't deadly, so no worries there.  Plus they have this awesome spicy powder/seasoning which isn't too spicy but adds some good flavour to the soup.  The service was really really good.  I mean, as soon as we were ready to order we were attended to and within a minute of ordering we already got our bills, split.  I thought that was pretty cool.  Anyways, our ramen came fast and like I already said, tasted great.  Everyone in our party of four was happy.  The one thing that sucked is that we got seats next to the door and it was a very cold day so there was a really cold breeze every time someone came in or out.  If you can avoid it, try to get a seat further into the restaurant so someone else suffers for you.  Kind of like we did.  Anyways, that aside, a good ramen place."}
{"text":"Favorite local spot for ramen, because the vegetarian/meat free options are great. Don't expect the best service, but it's good enough.  A bit pricey...but we keep going back."}
{"text":"This is our family's favourite go-to ramen place.  The best broth among others we have tried. The service is excellent too especially the manager that gives over the top customer service. They also give you complimentary spring rolls if the manager knows you are a regular customer."}
{"text":"A good ramen place. The service is pretty fast with bringing you your food.   I had one of the chef recommendations, ramen with teppanyaki chicken. The chicken is served separate on a stone dish that comes sizzling, which was a nice touch. The ramen was delicious, albeit a bit too salty. I paid $9 before tax and tip, which was very reasonable. The amount of food was just right; enough that when I finished, I wasn't too full, and I definitely wasn't hungry anymore.   I'll be returning here for dinner next time I don't feel like cooking on a weekday."}
{"text":"Not my favourite Ramen joint, but it was cold and it's close to my yoga studio. Next time i'll hike the extra distance to kenzo or kinton."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in forever. Anyways, ordered pork ramen here, though it was interesting to note almost half of the menu was plastered with stickers saying which items were \"suspended\". While it was alright, that's the most I can say about it, really."}
{"text":"Good ramen they have various options that include vegetarian soya or miso soup.  Portion size is good and taste is also good."}
{"text":"I've always like arisen ramen.  Food is good and price is reasonable and the staff is nice.  When we went it wasn't too busy so they gave free appetizer which was super nice of them to do.  Their ramen is pretty good too and along with the other food items like the agedashi tofu :)"}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for delicious noodles at a fair price.  The staff are always so nice and the food comes very quick.  They always have quirky videos on their T.V screen to entertain you as well.  I always have problems at the other locations where the servers were being very rude but this is the one I always go back to due to their excellent customer service.  I would give this location 10 stars if I can!"}
{"text":"The ramen here although not entirely authentic was delicious. Their portions are very generous and the staff provides great service and recommendations. Their combos are a great deal - I had the fired chicken with ramen. The crunchy chicken was a great offset to the soupy ramen."}
{"text":"You know, Ajisen is not altogether that bad.  Although it is heavy on the MSG, I don't mind the texture of the noodles, and it's perfect when it's cold outside and you don't feel like having any noodles at King's Noodle or adjacent Chinese food properties. There is a much larger selection than at Kenzo, and the service is fast.  Almost so fast though, that you can't order any other food even if you wanted to (the bill arrived just as we were going to order some bubble tea..... never mind that incremental purchase).    I ordered the Ajisen Ramen, and I found that the fixings were rather skimpy.  However, when I did finish the meal I was pretty full, so perhaps their portion control is the way to go.    Finding the perfect and authentic ramen in Toronto continues to be rather elusive.    Side note: what are those bowls on the side of the restaurant with dates on them?"}
{"text":"Starting to doubt Yelp's rating system. Some businesses that have 4 to 5 star ratings i find are not that great and chain stores like Ajisen seem to get a lot of hate and end up with a meagre 3 star review.  Ajisen has the best broth and worthy of 5 stars. In fact I've been here prob around 50 times in total.   My favorite ramen is the assorted seafood ramen with corn and a dab of chili oil.   My favorite appetizers are garlic chicken wings and beef enoki roll.  The manager is great and the servers used to be rude but they were all replaced recently and are now all extremely polite.   Definitely would recommend this place...not that it needs it as its always busy during dinner."}
{"text":"I've been to like four ramen places in the area but Ajisen is my absolute favourite. There lots of options and it makes for a cheap and tasty meal. The service is good and pretty quick. Seen the boss a few times and he's seemed very humble and treats the customers very well."}
{"text":"Quality of the dishes here has degraded since they first opened. Soup not as tasty anymore and the eggs are hard boiled rather than soft boiled.  When we complained about the egg being hard boiled, they did have the soft boiled available.  Why not serve the proper one in the first place? If you're looking for ramen there's other ramen places nearby that are more worth going to."}
{"text":"this place is horrible this place is so bad that I am taking the time out to complain about it The service is horrible no one understands anything that you ask and when you asked for something they take forever to get to you The soup sucks all of there noodles were old not fresh too salty not enough Taste it just sucked I will never go again even though I live literally two minutes away I live in a condo right upstairs so never ever am I going"}
{"text":"I really want to like this place.. i have eaten ajisen all over the world.   but till this day it still does not impress me.  I almost 100% will leave this place absolutely not full all the time..(im not fat... only in my stomach a little...(dont judge)).     i have an expectation of being full and its always ruined when i leave because its exactly like eating 1 instant noodle.... you know that feeling where you feel like theres not enough noodles.. you want to cook another one but your afraid its a lil too much.. yet one isnt enough?  sad.. anyways  this warden and steeles location.. the staff are HORRIBLE.. service is horrible.. i came here with 40 mins left till closing and they couldnt wait to shoo me out.. giving me the bill way in advance.. the soup was super salty too...  i have seen the manager several times.. hes okay.. but the staff really needs to take a lil course on customer service 101.. or human decency 101."}
{"text":"I have never in my life tasted a better broth. Not even my grandma can make something better.  Yes, the locations may not be posh and the side dishes aren't prime but the one dish they specialize in is worth more than 5 stars. This location doesn't carry bubble tea, but some do and it's also honestly amazing. This place is my shit."}
{"text":"a lot of menu choices but the broth is too salty a lot of the time for my palate.  steak is too tough (someone mentioned that and i agree).  the gyoza is okay, the Japanese style fried chicken is really good though and this location does decent bubble tea for cheap (not all Ajisen restaurants have it).  you have to park on the street which is hit or miss in availability.  although it is a ramen shop, it is chinese run and you have menu options that include kimchi, so along with the bubble tea, you get quite an asian experience here.  service can be slow, so dont come thinking it is fast food.    if you really want a good bowl of ramen, Kenzo is your better bet -- Korean run, but the ramen and its soup base are more authentic.  No bubble tea and less menu items, but it is a more honest bowl of ramen (newspaper article said that the korean chef trained in japan on ramen).  Kenzo is the same plaza as the Figure Skating Boutique which is south of Steeles on the west side of Yonge.  There is parking at the back, a little in the front. If you are craving noodles, ramen noodles, if you can spare the time to drive north a bit more, Kenzo is worth it."}
{"text":"I've been here consistently for their ramen and it's always been good in terms of their soups, noodles, and proteins!  I've also ordered from their appetizer menu their mini octopus (~$8 for 4 pieces is steep), seaweed salad is dressed a little to much but it was delicious nevertheless, and their pork cutlet was well done (crunchy breading and flavourful pork). However their service is lacking and the pork cutlet took WAY TOO long to be ready..I was the last person at my table to start eating when everyone was already finishing."}
{"text":"It's okay, not the best ramen Ive tried. The soup was more salty than other places and the meat wasn't as soft. But if you are just looking for a hot bowl of ramen on a cold day this would be okay if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Ramen was good, soup was a bit salty, u need a lot of water after eating. The fish combo not recommended, huge bowl of rice with one fish on it, and it smells \"not that fresh\"."}
{"text":"Great noodles. I love the spicy style of soup here. The portions are often small and contain a vast proportion of noodles. The fuchsia-pink atmosphere is a clear separator and makes this venue very appealing and interesting."}
{"text":"This location is pretty small and is usually packed, but the wait time hasn't been too bad in my experience. Lots of options for ramen, as well as rice sets and side dishes/appetizers. The pork ramen and tender rib ramen were both good, but the pork was a little dry. I also wish they were more generous with their toppings (i.e. bean sprouts, green onions etc). The ramen isn't the best I've had and I'm sure there are better places in the GTA, but it's not bad. Food is served quickly and the owner is so nice! 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Service I received here is pretty mediocre. I stood at the entrance waiting for acknowledgement for way too long before I had to approach them to make an order for takeout. Once acknowledged, they were nice.   Space is a bit small and cramped.  But Oh. My. Goodness. There ramen is amazing. The broth, the meat, the flavour! It's heavenly. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Ugh, I just went here again and it's not a place I would rather go to.  This place to me is one of the epitome of commercialized food.  It reminds me of Shadow Ramen in The World Ends With You.  The presentation and service is very nice and flashy I have to admit.  Heck the food even looks good.  I had the chicken katsu and had a taste of the Ajisen Ramen.  They both look good.  However, there's really no life when you taste it.  It's just so blah and mechanical.  Though not as bad as Bento Nouveau or Foody Mart or T&T plaza.  Their ramen noodles have the consistency of spaghetti noodles.  The good part is that I was able to convince my food buddy to try out another ramen place nearby (Niwatei) and she admits she likes it a lot more :)  Hopefully I would never have to hear about going to this place anytime soon."}
{"text":"I has to give this review after a trip to another ramen place   The ramen (steak) is amazing   My go to!"}
{"text":"Ajisen Ramen is my favorite ramen chain. I used to eat there at least once a week when I lived in China. After wandering around Chinatown and discovering that the place I wanted to try had closed down, my husband and I decided to go to Ajisen. The owner was outside enticing passersby to come inside. He was so energetic & friendly. The staff inside was just as friendly.  We started with the spring rolls, which were delicious. My husband ordered the bbq pork spicy ramen & I had the Ajisen spicy pork ramen. With the Ajisen spicy pork ramen, you can choose the level of heat, 25-200. I chose 50 and great googly moogly was it spicy! Incredibly scrumptious, but also tears in eyes, snot running down your face, coughing after every bite, spicy. I love when I order spicy and it lives up to its name. My husband loved his ramen, too. The prices are fair, around $9-13 for a bowl of ramen, and there is a wide variety of ramen to choose from. There are other items on the menu too, like rice and noodle dishes."}
{"text":"A small and crowded place when I arrived just before 6 for dinner. Be the time I left, people were lined up outside.   The Tonkatsu Ramen was very very good here."}
{"text":"The ramen - noodles were good, not great, but good, the broth has been as described most times I've been - which is about 5 times now. My friends love this place, though the distinction from most ramen places downtown is hard to tell.  The menu is a mess to say the least, with no guidance but lots of pictures to save it.  Service was very quick and friendly, and the manager took a couple pictures of my group and posted it with our confused consent.  I've tried the tom yum, miso, and kimchi broths - tom yum was spicy and made me sweat a little hahaha, kimchi was decent and miso was good.  I also tried the bubble tea here one time as I was craving it - tapioca was old and chewy, so it seems it isn't as popular but that's not an issue as it's a ramen restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times, it's really close to where I live and the price for Ramen is pretty decent. The bowls served look somewhat like they do on the menu. I ordered the chicken cutlet Ramen, which was good. The only problem I had was that it was kinda cold sitting by the window."}
{"text":"Food is ok but bad service, especially the lady , her name is Lisa and when I asked her questions she didn't want to answer me. Also she doesn't have good manners !! Very disappointed, this is my first time coming here and will also be my last time !"}
{"text":"This is place my family consistently goes to for ramen. I admit I don't remember having much ramen when I was in Japan, but I do enjoy it when I'm here as simple, casual food. I tend to like their ramen far more than their other meal dishes, and sometimes a lot of their dishes are unavailable.   For a typical Asian restaurant, they are rather accommodating with things, like making half-sweet or unsweetened bubble tea, or changing up the soup and adding things (although recently they've capitalized on that adventure by their set menu, with another page for additional options for a price). They're pretty nice and the late hours are good when kitchens in other places are closed after a late gig.   I wonder if I get better service because I'm Asian though. One time I came with a bunch of my non-Asian friends, and when my one friend ordered BBQ Pork ramen, the pork was grossly fatty and just not right. When he asked the waiter about it, she gave him a dirty weirded out look and told him all BBQ was like that. I had to step in and tell her that it was not, and only then did they change it. I had some issues with that.   In general, good value food. It's not gourmet or fancy, but it'll do the trick."}
{"text":"I'm a regular at Ajisen at all locations. The service is usually quick and consistent every visit but never amazing. I've tried many things on the menu but we tend to always go back to my regular order: steak teppanyaki ramen, shoyu pork ramen, deep fried tofu, and pan fried gyoza. All my food comes out nothing past 10 minutes. The soup is still hot but not too hot that you can still eat it comfortably and enjoy it. The steak comes out on a sizzling plate and tastes so good when you put the chilli powder and garlic powder.  Overall Ajisen is my go-to ramen spot. They never miss and I have never been disappointed going here. I come here so often that I've collected so many stamps on my cards. I've gone to various other places that cost more and I still will choose Ajisen over them."}
{"text":"My first time trying ramen and I loved it. Took the 150 degree of spice (out of 200) and was really good. If you think you can handle spicy, try it. I could have tried 200, next time I will. The waiter and cook were amazed I eated all of it without a sweat.  Excellent service, fast, food really great."}
{"text":"I had the bbq pork ramen and it was amazing! I think on a regular day it might have tasted a bit on the salty side but after biking around sweatily the whole day and with the cold night approaching, my body needed this.   The ramen itself seemed slightly undercooked but was hopping the line of undercooked and cooked. Still very tasty nonetheless. The broth was very good. Savoury, Salty and warm to the right amount that I was craving.   Service was quick and efficient.  The interior decoration was really fun to look at and even though it did not give the off the vibe you'd want for a cold night with warm food it was certainly an atmosphere which lifts your tired spirit.  Spacing is a little tight but they weren't full so it was nothing to worry about.  Prices seem pretty fair.  Overall a great place to eat. I'm coming back."}
{"text":"My friend and I have been wanting try this place, as soon as you walk in the staff was very welcoming. This place offer so many options but we decided to get miso pork ramen and beef spicy ramen with medium rare steak. in my opinion Ajisen ramen is honesty the best ramen I've ever had so far.. way better than sansotei ramen, highly recommend this place."}
