{"text":"While nothing is particularly wrong with Guido's, it is not a place I go unless I am with a group. I only ever go there during the day as the crowd at night is a bit too annoying. Tends to be frequented by young (early 20s) looking to score. Not really my scene.

For the food there are better burgers & sandwiches, better nachos, and better salads at the many other places downtown. The staff is very friendly and the prices very reasonable but again I can find that at most of the places downtown.

During the summer it is nice to sit outside as they have a prime people watching location.

Guido's is good for large groups."}
{"text":"This place is terrible.

Nice location.  Terrible atmosphere and service.  If you feel like hanging out with the service staff and their friends, and feel like you are at a party where you don't know anyone and you are not welcomed, if you like to pay more than you should for your food and drinks, then you got to go to Guido's."}
{"text":"I go to Guido's occasionally and always have a great time.  
During the day it has a nice, laid-back atmosphere and is a great place to just sit and chill at the bar or watch football on the weekends. At night it gets more crowded and is a perfect place to grab drinks with friends or get some late night food.   
The food is fantastic for the price, especially the nachos! The martinis are also surprisingly good. Try the pumpkin martini; it is delicious and only $5!"}
{"text":"Came here during Pygmalion and the outside had plenty of seating open so we thought it would be great- it's in a prime people-watching location in downtown Champaign. 

Unfortunately the service was EXTREMELY slow.  We waited 30 minutes for drinks and another hour on top of that for a couple of bean burgers that definitely weren't worth the wait.    I have to say that the waitress was extremely nice and very apologetic about the wait, but it was seriously ridiculous.  

It's probably a good place to go if you've had a couple drinks already, aren't in ANY hurry and just want bar food.  It was a definite bar-feel inside and like I said, good location for sitting outdoors.  That was the appeal, but  I won't waste my time again."}
{"text":"Uh... No. If I wanted to hang out on campus and be eyeballed by frat boys looking for a fight, I'd go to Joe's or some other place like that. The food sucks. I don't drink anything but beer, so that's okay. Not my kind of place, and that is not Guido's fault. Verified family man just heading out for a cold beer that's all."}
{"text":"Great place for eating and enjoying some really great beers. Lots of TV's around the bar area.
Summertime offers outdoor seating. I usually get a cobb salad and it is always tasty. 
The people who work there are really great and they seem to like their job. I don't want a \"dining experience\"..... I want great people. That said, you will enjoy this place. 

The onion rings are caramelized and are the best I've ever had. Almost forgot to speak of their milk shakes. Don't try one, you'll be hooked."}
{"text":"One nice thing about this place is that there's plenty of place to sit inside during the summertime. That's about the only good thing I can think of offhand. I had the eggplant sandwich with steamed veggies. The veggies were great. The eggplant sandwich was awful. Soggy, flavorless, just plain gross. A friend ordered a burger and was very unimpressed. Flavorless and cold. And another friend got fries that were limp and frigid. The server seemed overwhelmed. We had to ask for water refills multiple times. The server took the orders for most of our table but not all of it. When she finally came back, she had no clue she hadn't gotten all the orders. All in all, I'm not dying to go back here anytime soon."}
{"text":"A comfortable place to have some drinks and snacks. Bartender is very skillful. Two billiard tables underground."}
{"text":"The food is very good, but I've been to lunch there three times and it always seems like they're training...everybody, management included.  Slow service, screwed up orders, slow to get me my check.  It's lunch time folks, I have to go back to work!"}
{"text":"Food: Ordered a Prime Rib Sandwich, and by no means expected an actual cut of prime rib. I'd guess it was a cut of ribeye, but it was still pretty tasty nonetheless, somewhat fatty, but it's to be expected on these types of sandwiches. Ordered mine cajun style with a side salad, meaning I got a steak sandwich that was pretty well seasoned. For $10, it was a pretty good fix of red meat.

Service: My waitress was very friendly. She refilled my water, made sure my food came out correct, and was very personable.

Ambiance: Guido's seems to be more of a sports bar type of place (at least, I think). TVs everywhere, pool tables, I've heard it can get pretty rowdy on weekend nights. For lunchtime it was pretty quiet, and I was able to hold conversation. It was clean, but I guess I hope for personality out of a restaurant, in which Guido's just doesn't really have much.

Overall: I enjoyed Guido's, but I can't really say there's anything about it that makes it highly distinguishable. The food, while very good, was pretty standard in selection. For having the best location in Champaign, it just feels like they're trying to play it safe, which I suppose I can't fault them for. Pleasant time overall."}
{"text":"Mediocre. The bar environment is okay in the evenings, and there's pool if you're into that sort of thing, but Jupiter's is better if you're looking for pool and food, and Esquire is better if you're looking for pool and booze. The bar looks okay, and drinks are priced reasonably, so there's that.

My problem is the food. The chicken tenders are acceptable, if greasy, but the burger is indistinguishable from most other places in C-U. It's just so darn bland as a restaurant and a bar that it's not worth going to."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I enjoyed going here for half off draft beers on Wednesdays.   Not only that, but the food was worth having and the staff was always very friendly.   They have a great outdoor seating set up that allows you to take in the downtown environment."}
{"text":"Over the course of a week, there comes a time in a college student's life when the dining hall food is not an option and cooking a meal requires too much effort. On this particular Thursday, that is exactly what my roommate and I were going through. We typically go for our favorite restaurants (usually the ones within a short drive), however, we tasked ourselves with trying new restaurants in the Champaign-Urbana area this semester. And that is how we ended up at Guido's Bar & Grill. 

Menu: Big font for the name and smaller font for food description; Subtle colors of maroon, black, goldish yellow, brown

I am the type of person that usually is able to find something right away no matter what the menu offers. However, this time was difficult because the menu did not have as much as I expected. I was in the mood for a sandwich and decided to get the Buffalo Chicken. This consisted chicken breasts battered and deep fried, spicy sauce, melted Swiss cheese, ranch or bleu cheese dressing (I chose bleu cheese)! I honestly only chose this option because it came with all toppings and a choice of a side item. Might as well get the most out of my money, right? For my side choice, I chose my favorite of tater tots. 

Restaurant: Spacious room with the bar in the center and surrounded with multiple booths with low lighting. 

My roommate and I decided on takeout and were surprised at the amount of people in the restaurant who were studying and networking. When we walked in, we simply walked to the bar and were asked if we ordered takeout. When we said yes, the bartender simply gave us our receipts and then our food with minimal taste. 

Food: This is where it gets real. 

Nothing is more terrifying than a hungry college student and unfortunately, Guido's did not meet the mark to satisfy my needs. The food was not as tasty as I expected and it might have been to the combination of the spice as well as the condiments. Also, on a sad note, the sandwich lacked the bleu cheese, which may have aided in the taste. For some reason, the blend of all the ingredients actually made the food quite bland. On a plus note, the tater tots were the perfect combination of crunch on the outside and softness on the inside. 

Overall, I do not think that I would return for any of the entrees at this restaurant. Yet, I do think that that their sides would be a great snack on a late night of studying!"}
{"text":"We visited Guido's with a group of friends on a Saturday evening. We had been there once before and enjoyed a nice evening on the patio. It was a chilly evening so we had planned to stay inside. The venue is comfortable; the service was good; the bartenders were friendly. Unfortunately, the music was so loud we could barely hear each other. We did not order food so I cannot comment on that. Although it was a nice place, it simply was not a good venue to have a drink and visit - at least not the weekend we were there."}
{"text":"Had lunch with a friend on a weekday! Despite all the bad reviews on service, it's fine on a weekday when the students are gone. Our waitress was very attentive. Burger and salad were good; I enjoyed the eggplant fries. Great weather and outdoor seating were the biggest plus!"}
{"text":"I would have to say that my recent Guido's experience was quite spectacular. My waitress, who had THE cutest black Levi's, was absolutely fabulous and welcomed me into the establishment after a 2 year hiatus. 
As a fellow server within the downtown area my waitress attended to my needs regardless of my shady ways- that alone takes balls- and I applaud her tenacity and friendly sense of professionalism. 
Also, there was a beautiful man, 6'4 in height, who made my meal that much more satiating. I feel confident he was a staff member given that he was wearing a Guido's shirt with the word \"STAFF\" on the back which would imply I was checking out his upper body and the fact that he too has a well defined lower half and does NOT skip leg day. I hope this gentleman is a true man and not some over-glorified man child who makes excuses because that would be a wasteful shame.
If he and my waitress are also bartenders I would most DEFINITELY return for future investments if not I know that service, such as theirs, will be promoted at some point :)
Do you in your black Levi's miss, and black-shirt man be ever so glorious."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Sunday afternoon. Great service by Chelsea. Not a bad tap selection, still went with a lagunitas... (Get that stuff on draft). Nachos were out of this world. My wife had a Guido grilled cheese that was suggested and she loved it. The six year old had one of the best burgers I have ever had. Our next trip to ChampBana will include this place just to try an adult milkshake. Thank you for doing things the right way!"}
{"text":"Me likey.

If you're looking for a nice, off campus bar, I suggest Guido's.  It does get fairly crowded on weekend nights, but typically no line, and no cover, and the crowd that frequents this bar is fairly diverse.  They have a wide selection of beers and great food which makes this place a good spot for lunch or dinner as well.  The grilled chicken I got was really juicy and tasty - not the dry, flavorless, just out of the freezer stuff you'd usually find at other bars, and the nachos and quesadillas are yummy, cheesy, goodness.

It's clean, spacious, great ambiance, and they have an outdoor patio for additional seating.  Guido's is a great place to take out of town friends for a good time."}
{"text":"Love the nachos! Nice atmosphere, friendly staff. Great outdoor seating which makes for great people watching!"}
{"text":"I went here for a business meeting after a seminar.  It was about 5pm, and sure, it was raining, but the lights were turned down really low, ready for the night crowd (although it seemed a little early for night time lighting).  So I thought it was a little dark, but anyway...

I had the bacon cheeseburger, and it was alright.  I'd give it an average rating.  You would think paying $8 for a bacon burger, they would put more than 2 skimpy slices of bacon on it.  The fries were good though.  They were the super skinny ones, sort of like Murphy's.  I did not check out their beer selection, not because it was a business meeting, but I had serious studying to do after wards, so I can't comment on that aspect.  

I can see it being a good place for groups to go.  Not sure what the night crowd is like.  It's maybe a little fancy, but not required.  Like, if you wanted to \"go out\" and \"dress up\" you could probably go here, but if you were in jeans and a t-shirt that would be okay too.  Know what I mean?

The waitress was nice, it has a large, open area, I think a pool table, and booths and tables along the perimeter.  And outdoor seating."}
{"text":"waitresses in skin tight mini dresses.  check.

all the townie mid-90's uiuc frat alum.  check.

waiting forever to get your bill.  being subsequently charged twice on your card.  having to deal with your bank to get said charge reversed because the manager at guidos can't be bothered to call you back.  check.  check.... and.... check.

the drinks are standard.  the food is fair.  the experience is forgettable. accept when you get your credit card statement.  then you are reminded.  sometimes twice."}
{"text":"guidos has really good french fries. REALLY REALLY GOOD. like sneak them off your husband's plate when he's in the bathroom even though you already have your own good...

...but remember all those people you hated in high-school? the ones you figured would join a fraternity or sorority to try and legitimize the fact that they are drunk, mentally disturbed, and semi-literate? remember how you thought they'd all still be acting like jack-asses in their thirties? well, you were right, and i promise you, they are hanging out at guidos right now with five hundred of their best friends."}
{"text":"Very good outdoor seating and fairly spacious inside. Outside of block party nights and townie reunions, you can usually find room. The food is definitely above par, especially for the bar scene. I suggest going with the nachos, but be ready to share... it's quite a bit. The chicken tenders we had weren't bad, as they're hard to mess up, but we should have just stopped with the nachos. Drink prices are not bad for downtown, but they need a more broad draft selection."}
{"text":"Move to town 4 weeks ago. Finally decided to give Guido's a try. Had the blackbean burger, side of broccoli salad and garden salad. It's perfect pub food. I'll be going back for sure! BTW... the staff are rather cool as wll. Greeted by the manager who couldn't be any more engaging, and the bartender was busy but very attentive."}
{"text":"I go here a lot and usually love it. I've never been when it was busy and tonight I went for the first time on a busy night and was ignored for 15 minutes so I decided to leave. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"I really like the outdoor seating they have and the place is pretty big w/out having too much of a line. Good place if you're not a fan of typical campus bars. More townies and older people. Really bad name though"}
{"text":"I had an event here last night and they did a really great job in accommodating us.  The quesadillas (both chicken and steak) were out of this world! I ordered off of the catering menu and everything was perfect.  The temperature and the flavor were spot on.  We had 45 people attend this event and I did not hear one complaint."}
{"text":"Guido's Nachos are awesome!!! We only go when the students are still hungover (weekend mornings) or out of town.  It is better that way.  Boozy shakes are pretty good too."}
{"text":"The only way this place gets three stars is because the service was good and our food was good. My wife and i went there for lunch. I got the chicken salad and fries. She got a veggie sandwich and onion rings. My sandwich was good and hers was ok. They were what they were. No frills. The veggie sandwich was just a plain veggie sandwich. 

The reason this place needs less stars is because I would liken it to a TGI Friday's or Chili's. There is just nothing that would set it apart from standard American fare. I am glad I just went there for lunch rather than dropping more money at dinner."}
{"text":"Guido's is ok. 
Pros: great burgers (even the vege burger is good), awesome fish sandwich on Fridays, one of the best outdoor seating locations in Chambana... Perfect for a leisurely and/or boozy lunch in the sun.
Cons: Downstairs club gets a bit rough later on in the night...sides (ESP fruit and veges) on sandwiches not always fresh and service can be slow."}
{"text":"Easily the worst and most frustrating bar in town. Expect a 20 minute wait on a drink whether they're busy or not. Don't expect a smile from the bartender. Don't expect them to check on you when sitting at the bar... I couldn't even get a napkin with my dinner. The food I have had is actually really good, but I only ordered the basics like a grilled cheese and chips with salsa. It's not worth the ghastly staff, or frat boy rude customers. Just avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"Cool downtown bar with great food.  I had the hot turkey sandwich and the eggplant fries.  Both were absolutely wonderful.  I also love the Boozy shakes.  Great drink specials and a great atmosphere.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"This isn't a bad place. It's nice on the inside, the booths are spacious, but the menu is severely limited. There's a handful of appetizers, a few salads, and the rest is sandwiches and burgers. Nothing on the menu really stands out as being that special. I got the Reuben sandwich and it was fine. The bonus was the eggplant fries, they were pretty good. There's a decent beer selection (mostly in bottles, with some on tap). 

With its apparent shortcomings I plan on going back. This is the kind of place I could see myself hanging out at and having a few beers before moving on to other places for the night."}
{"text":"Absolutely unimpressed.

The frat boys yelling and carrying on Saturday nights when I'm walking past don't make for good advertisements, guys, especially when one shouts, \"Look at the fool with the fro\" and points.  ugh.


Still, I decided to give Guido's a shot.  I went for dinner after studying one night with some friends.
The waitress was polite but chronically forgetful, and had to be asked multiple times for anything from water to silverware to condiments.  The burger was...okay.  The fries were disappointing.  The crab cakes were dry and icky.

I'm not coming back.  And I'm certainly having my headphones in each time I pass the ever scintillating crowd on the weekends."}
{"text":"The food was so-so, and the service was sloooow despite there not being many customers. The burger lacked flavor, the chips and salsa tasted stale, and the food eaten by the others in my party was on par with mine."}
{"text":"If you are in the mood for nachos, head here. Of course many other reviewers make good points, it's a weird crowd, it can be really loud, etc. All true. But the nachos are pretty delicious."}
{"text":"4 stars for the food and boozy milkshake, and 0 star for service. I went on a slow Tuesday night, and the bartender AND barback were both so rude! The bartender literally THREW napkins at us after we got our food, never checked up on how our food/drinks are."}
{"text":"One of my go-to's in downtown Champaign. Great beer selection and solid bar food that's consistently good. I love the fact that they have ample outdoor seating as well, which is a huge plus in my eyes. I'll definitely keep coming here."}
{"text":"Came here for a beer with a few friends, not sure what all the hype is about."}
{"text":"Mediocre to sub par.  Great location is wasted on the below average food. Started out with simple chips/salsa.  Salsa was out of a jar. Chips were restaurant supply, not fresh. Oh well..$4 I'll never get back. Wife had eggplant sandwich on the server recommendation. No flavor, nothing to write home about. Left half-eaten. I had the classic with cheese and bacon. Meat had no seasoning. Chinsy on the bacon. Wendy's classic has more flavor. 

Service was outstanding.  Beer list was decent. Unimpressed and will not go back for food."}
{"text":"First bar experience, so it was alright. Wasn't expecting a whole lot. 
Burgers are amazing though (a bit overpriced, but OMG their special mayonnaise is sooo good). The service isn't great - my friend got the wrong order and the waitress was like \"are you sure?\"."}
{"text":"Went here during the recent Dad's Day weekend at University of Illinois.  It was a hugely busy weekend, so Guido's was packed.  Pleased to report that though the food took a long time (Dad's Day is always packed) it was good and the service friendly."}
{"text":"The management went out of their way to make up for a bad experience. We had a wonderful dinner. And interesting selection of Martini's. It is basic bar food, but delicious. And the service was very good."}
{"text":"Guidos... All I have to say is what the f*ck did you guys do to the honey mustard sauce. It tastes like baby vomit. It tastes like your cooks are chain smoking cigarettes and leaving the ash in it. It taste like a rhino took a dump in. It taste like my grandmothers foot fungus. It tastes like the must on your dirty cousins back. It tastes like the sweat under your knees after a long game of basketball. It taste like you left a steak out for 3 weeks in the sun, letting it mold, and then stirred all that mold up and called it honey mustard. 

Please, just do something to fix this tragic tasting sauce."}
{"text":"Excellent location. Great outdoor space. Servers are very friendly. Food is yummy, and they serve tator tots. Yum!!"}
{"text":"3 stars for Guido's.  No more, no less.

The menu is very limited.  I was surprised at how limited.  Maybe we were there at an off time where they were in between lunch and dinner and that's the bar menu, I'm not sure, but it was small.

On our table:
Queso
Nachos
Teriyaki chicken sandwich
Grilled cheese
Both sandwiches came with \"eggplant fries\" as an upcharge.

The queso and nachos \"looked better than they tasted.\"  The grilled cheese was standard.  The teriyaki chicken sandwich was very salty and very dry.

The eggplant fries stole the show.  They were delicious, with a side of grainy honey mustard for dipping.  They're probably the only thing I'd go back for.

Also, if you want a cup of coffee (as my dad did) be aware that they use a Keurig, and therefore, charge by the cup.  No free refills on your joe."}
{"text":"The burgers are good! They claim double patty which is necessary when the patty measures the thickness of a stick of gum. If you want decent service, make sure to be a bit of a douche, or a hot chick."}
{"text":"Can you review a place based on 1 dish?

If you come here for food, alright, the nachos are out of this world. Get em with meat and be prepared to eat nonstop for a while. I would rate the nachos at Guido's a 4-5 star dish

The rest of the menu is just a real small variety of burgers and thats about it, and I don't remember it standing out or anything. JUST GET THE NACHOS

As a bar, I came here and ordered a couple drinks and the waitress didn't know what a couple of them were so... yea.. I haven't been back to drink, but only to order dem nachos."}
{"text":"Love the bar peanuts to fill in food gaps. Steak sandwich there is super solid. Always a chill time. Service can be slow at times as its a towny spot. But the customer seevice is usually good"}
{"text":"I came here for a work happy hour and our group received substandard service. The server was unfamiliar with the beer list. Our group started as three and then grew to just 6. Not a large group and it was surprising when she was annoyed that the additional people that joined wanted to order food. It was only 6:30-7:00 on a Friday night, so we weren't putting anyone out as the place was fairly empty. This was my first visit and my last."}
{"text":"I keep coming back over and over for a good drink at a nice bar. It's great for our friends and my wife because we can both really enjoy what we enjoy whether it's her wide variety of beer or martinis or my usual order of an Old Fashioned or Manhattan.They do both very well and at a reasonable price. Bar food is good and the atmosphere can range from hip and jumping, to sports night, to low level relaxation depending on time of year or time of day."}
{"text":"I am not from Champaign but Guido's has become one of my go-tos when we go out for dinner. I've been there so many times to eat and never had notably slow service. I love the food, their burgers are great and their eggplant fries are the bomb. I also am a huge fan of the fact that they serve dinner until midnight because that's hard to find in this area. Oh, and I think they have one of the best outdoor seating areas in summer."}
{"text":"Came here for drinks on a Friday night. 2 stars because my tab was 15.50 for two well vodkas and lemonade and 2 Budweiser bottles. 15 fucking 50 who the hell does this place think it is. Really did we magically take a road trip to Chicago. God damn I'm just so mad that a bar this average in central Illinois would have the balls to charge that for 4 cheap drinks. What ever guido's keep over charging people for drinks I won't come back here."}
{"text":"While I had been to this place before and it was passable, I made the mistake of going on some \"Jose Cuervo\" day, when downtown Champaign was all blocked off.  Even worse, I took my family.

Tiny, overpriced menu, with heated-up pulled pork on a grocery store bun.  Chips on the side.  More than $7.  My dad asked for a bottle of Miller Lite, they brought him a draft without checking if it was alright, and charged him for a bottle anyway.  Inattentive waitress, despite the place being full of workers, we were left waiting a long time for pretty much anything we wanted.

Truly awful, I will never be there again.  Extorting your customers and ignoring their requests is not a good way to get repeat business."}
{"text":"I witnessed an amazing fight here, involving a beer glass and someone's eye. Guido's is awesome for men and women in their mid-40s who desire a social atmosphere comparable to Joe's Brewery."}
{"text":"An overall pretty good bar in downtown Champaign. the staff was quick and attentive and they had a huge beer selection with plenty of TV screens. the place is clean and there is ample room and the environment seemed laid back in this young crowd. A good place to eat and drink likely on the weekends."}
{"text":"Cheap drink specials,no Effen, large space,odd crowd, big ass jager bombs!

that's really all  I can say about this place."}
{"text":"In general, I like Guidos.  They have a good selection of bottled beer, and it's reasonably priced.  I think their food is fine, I've taken my dad there before and we've definitely had worse meals in CU over the years.  Hell-- I even think that some of their martinis are better than those at Boltini-- blasphemy, right?  

The bartenders have always been very nice, but I had one interaction with a waitress that was less than ideal-- I ordered La Fin du Monde, she brought me Lindeman's Framboise, I pointed out the error (they're polar opposites of the bottled alcohol spectrum, I didn't want to pay $8 for raspberry stuff) and she made a comment about how it's not like they could give it to someone else.. trend in DT champaign? But, she did bring me the right beer after I questioned her initial decision.  

Overall, I like going there to play pool on the quiet nights... on the weekends, I'd rather go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I come here often. Love the atmosphere and the bartenders are always super friendly and welcoming. The burgers and salads here are probably my favorite things on the menus. They have pretty good drink specials during the week as well!"}
{"text":"I don't go here for the nightlife, so I can't speak to this place as a bar. As a lunch place, though, it's fantastic. There is always a place to sit, the service is fast and friendly, and they have a great menu that leans slightly towards the southwest. 

Their southwestern quesadilla with the cajun chicken is amazing. I don't usually like things with corn, roasted or no, but the whole thing is delicious and not laden with grease. The grilled tortilla is flavorful, as is the side cup of southwestern sour cream they give you to dip each bite in. 

Other good eats are their onion rings, Cobb salad (and it's under $9--cheap by my book), and Buffalo chicken. 

Bottom line, I dig Guido's."}
{"text":"Last time we came here, it was a busy Saturday night and after being seated, the staff had no idea. After waiting for 15 minutes, we notified the bouncer and had to wait an additional 5 minutes. At that point we left and still saw no sign of the waitress.

2 stars for half price drafts on Wednesday."}
{"text":"I like their decor, and I like their onion rings.  I also like that getting blue cheese is an option for the burgers.

Other than that, I was just not impressed.  It was one of those non-busy times when there seem to be 10 bored waitresses milling around, but not one of them is actually helping you.  It seriously took 10 minutes between being seated and seeing our waitress.  Then our burger orders were mixed up.  Then we didn't see our waitress until it was time to leave.  It's also worth noting that while I may sometimes have the self-esteem and paranoia of a 13 year old emo girl, I really feel like the waitress was judging me.

On a more food-related note, I was DEFINITELY unimpressed by the veggie burger.  It was over-spiced with chili powder, which made my choice of blue cheese crumbles unappetizing.  It seemed like it came out of a package, which could be true, but I've never had a bad Boca burger.  Definitely not worth it for the price."}
{"text":"Guidos was a disappointment in the service department. Our server waited on us apathetically and dressed in an inappropriate manner. If I had children, I would have had to shield their eyes:she had a black camisole without a bra. It was uncomfortable to have to converse with her. Even more egregious than her dress was her lack of awareness and concern for our dining experience. We waited for more than 45 minutes for our food, even though there were few customers at the restaurant. We had to acquire our own silverware and our own napkins. She did not ask once if we enjoyed our meal or if we needed anything else. It's very disappointing that so many restaurants fail due to the cancerous threat of poor service."}
{"text":"Not a bad place to stop in and grab a bite to eat. I have been here several times over the past few years and they have been pretty consistent in food quality and service. The food is very much bar food, for me, I have to be ok with how I am going to feel after eating it. I always enjoy their nachos or chicken tenders, but their burgers are never a bad choice either.

I have seen that they have trivia nights and only just recently learned that they have a basement area as well. I am excited to check that out and see how it goes!"}
{"text":"Great service.the server Chelsea was excellent.were from out of town staying at the hyatt.def will try to stop by again in the future :)"}
{"text":"I really dig the atmosphere here on late nights, reminds me of being back in Chicago. Large oval bar area with tables all around. The chili con queso keeps me coming back for late night snacks and the boozy shakes are addicting, although they they only contain small traces of alcohol. The nachos are incredibly stacked and almost impossible to eat by yourself. The philly cheesesteak is fine but really had no flavor. BLT was not great according to my buddy. Eggplant fries are probably their best side but nothing to write home about. The chili is fine. Overall, the food is pretty much fine. They do have a room in the basement for parties. Pretty lively late at night and located in conveniently in the middle of downtown on Neil. The service has been pretty damn good so I'm bumping it up to 4 stars for that."}
{"text":"Every time I come by Champaign for business, I stop by Guido's at least once since our dessert store is right across the street from them. The bartenders are all pretty awesome. 

When I stopped by for drinks, the girl bartender was very attentive and friendly.

I've also gotten their burgers before and it's always awesome. Had their Mushroom swiss and spicy cajun. 

Service: When I ordered the spicy cajun, I asked for less cheese. The server went to the counter and came back to show me the receipt that less cheese cannot be requested on the machine,  but he wrote on the receipt. I thought it was awesome that the man (server 24) was so attentive and came back to tell me. When I got home, I found extra cheese on the side without me asking for it. This is what I called service!"}
{"text":"My companions and I almost didn't stop here due to the reviews. I usually do take reviews to heart. But the people I was with didn't want to go to my choice, and they thought it looked cool. Well it definitely didn't disappoint like a 3 stars joint. Everyone liked their food, and I especially recommend \"The Dude\"; a white Russian milkshake won't disappoint. The vibe felt like a Buffalo Wild Wings toned down a bit. I'm sure this place can get packed but it wasn't packed when we were there. Overall I would definitely recommend Guido's, and that's a sentence I hope I never have to say again."}
{"text":"This is a relatively classy place, not necessarily a college bar.  At least, there was a fair mix of ages in here, and nobody even gave me dirty looks when I cheered vociferously for Penn State against the Illini during a Saturday-night game.  It was lively but not crowded.

They have dark red paint and cherry wood in here, which individually are quite handsome but do not match well together.  In general, though, it's an attractive place with a mellow atmosphere.  One detraction:  the bathrooms are terrible, far worse than you would expect given the rest of the establishment.  

Service was friendly and attentive from our two waitresses.   The first one could not name the bar's whiskeys besides \"Jameson, Jack, Jim, Crown\" (thankfully I ended up with Woodford Reserve) but give her credit for at least knowing what \"whisk(e)y\" is (you'd be surprised)."}
{"text":"I've been to Guido's three times for lunch. I've had a burger and fries all three times, all were cooked to perfection and really tasted great. The first time I went alone as I work nearby. I expected the experience to be pleasant, if not speedy, as I was on a short lunch break. For some reason, it took a while to get the burger and fries. The waitress was accommodating and polite, but it took way to long - like 30 minutes before I had the food. 

Second and third meals there were all great experiences with less trouble than the first. The burgers are really good and the fries become awesome with the queso added. 

Its a decent enough place for lunch. If they sped up the service I would likely eat there more often."}
{"text":"I had not been to Guido's for several years.  When my work group came for happy hour, I was totally down.  We received our menus and I asked if the draft beer menu was up to date.  The waitress said yes and walked away.  The menu listed 4 beers as seasonal.  When she came back, I asked her what the seasonal beers were for Sam Adams, Bells, Leinenkugels, and Stone.  She let me know that they didn't have any Bells or Sam Adams seasonal beers, but had Lienie Summer Shady and an Avery IPA available.  The entire time, she was surly and annoyed with my questions.  
I just wanted to know what was on tap at your bar.  Give me a break.  
After my drink, I left my group and had a wonderful experience at Radio Maria."}
{"text":"Service was good, and the place was big and clean.  They have so much competition in town, and the food was greatly lacking. Prices were not cheap for the lousy food my group had. I will not be back."}
{"text":"We came in here for a private event organized by the med school department at UIUC. The private event was held downstairs, its a small cozy place good for private events. They have few booths and a bar downstairs with no TVs. We ordered the famous Guido's nachos and they are AMAZING!! Also we tried their fries and they were great too. The bartender made some good cocktails and the service was friendly and attentive. They have very limited option for good wine, so if you love wine this isn't the place. It's great place for beer and cocktails, Moscow mule is excellent! Later we ordered some chicken burgers and quesadilla and they were good bar food! The upstairs is more fun place to hangout with friends, it's huge to accommodate more people and tv all around to enjoy some sport! Overall it's a fun bar environment place with good beers and cocktails."}
{"text":"Pretty standard bar fair. A little over priced but great location and a good selection of brews make up for that. Friday fish is their best dish."}
{"text":"Outstanding food for the price, but the staff is clueless.  Best onion rings in town.  Everything on the menu is excellent.  I take customers and job interviewees here all the time."}
{"text":"Service was terrible.  Place was half full and waitress told us she couldn't take our order.  I had a BLT and my son had a club sandwich.  We both got sick (throwing up) 2 hours after we are there.  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"I came here with some friends to grab drinks and dinner. My friend and I arrived first, and we were still waiting for 3 more people. Our server came up and asked if we'd like anything other than water and I said I would and just needed a quick minute to look at the drink menu. She walked away and was nowhere to be found for about a half hour. Even after our friends showed up, we waited another 10-15 minutes. We finally got our drink order in and no one was ID'd (My friend is 21 and I am 23...we honestly should have been...), and then waited about 20 minutes for 5 beers. We luckily got our food order in at the same time and waited at least 30 minutes for that (and still, one of the dishes wasn't even ready and took extra time). Every time we wanted another drink, we had to wait 10 minutes to get the server's attention and then another 15-20 to actually get our drinks. Our server did not seem to be overly busy, wasn't at all in a rush, and never once apologized for the poor service/long wait. As a server in the area, I was very disappointed with the service my friends and I received and probably will not return here."}
{"text":"Burger and sandwiches! Lots of tvs for the games, enjoyable food, and great music. Offers slot machines in the back corner. 

Was a good price! About $7.50-$9.00 for a burger or sandwich

Lots of waitresses and hosts that loved to talk together in groups though so they were always rushing. 

Overall decent experience"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for drinks and appetizers on a Wednesday afternoon, the atmosphere was very relaxed and service was very attentive! Tried a black forest boozy milkshake, I highly recommend it! It's clear to see that even without booze added their milkshakes are very well made.

They were missing a few of the draft beers but still had a lot of options and the waitress gave my boyfriend a few other options to try. 

Got the Guido's nachos, HIGHLY recommend those! Definitely get a lot of bang for your buck and you can choose to add steak and chicken for only over $1 more. Huge portion size and the Chipotle ranch on the side was super good. Overall, definitely worth a stop in even if it's just for drinks and apps!"}
{"text":"Great service and good bar food. Cute place. Smells a bit like the day after of a huge party but what else would you expect at a sports bar close to U of I campus. The beer list is extensive. High back booths are cool. Wouldn't be my first choice  but it was good."}
{"text":"Like the music here! And the boozy shake was bomb!!!!! Sometimes you just deserve that sugary but absolutely delicious dessert. Who doesn't love milkshake? adding booze in it makes it even better!!! Nice treat for myself. Piña colada."}
{"text":"I really like this place that I go nearly every weekend when I am in town.  They used to have really hot waitresses so my guy friends would make me go all the time.  There is no cover.. no lines..  busy and it's a posh place to hang out on the weekends.  It's supposed to be a sports bar.. but it doesn't really have that feel.  The drinks are also decent.. it's not watered down and the prices are reasonable.

I like some of their food too.  Best quesadillas in town.  Nachos are pretty good too.  Crab cakes are NOT good.  I'm not a huge fan of the sandwiches.. but the fish sandwich special on Friday is okay."}
{"text":"The service is the only thing that can be hit or miss here but other than that then food is great. Love the nachos and the sandwiches.... literally every sandwich there is wonderful. I usually get the Reuben with tots! Don't forget the cheese sauce for dipping. So good."}
{"text":"Owner reached out to me after I wrote this review and said he would like to go over the bill because he reviewed the video of that night. He went over each drink I ordered and determined that there were some discrepancies with the bill. Yea thanks already knew that. Offered no apology or explanation. I disputed all of these extra charges with my bank. Hopefully if customers are complaining about food items, managers don't review video footage to determine honesty. And hopefully bartenders are no longer messaging customers via Facebook. Unprofessional."}
{"text":"This place seemed to be the fun college hang out bar. The place where the frat boys come to hang out and scan the ladies up and down. I, am not a frat boy. I did not come here to hit on ladies. I felt old here. 

Though the bartender was nice and offered some suggestions to my friend on where he could meet some ladies to hook up with. Mercifully, I got to go back to the hotel and get myself to bed."}
{"text":"What comes to mind when I think of Guido's? Three things:

Nachos. Burgers. Want.

Everything else about this place kinda fades into the background, for me at least. The decor and ambiance are nice enough, I suppose, though a bit on the dark side. But seriously - who cares?

I'm there for the nachos anyway. These bad boys are listed under appetizer, but don't be fooled - the order is huuuuge and definitely could hold its own as an entree. If you're going to Guido's, get the nachos. End of story."}
{"text":"Usually will get drug here with co-workers every now and then.  Very average, just passable food.  Typical greasy food type of fair.   A bit on the higher side price wise I think. $10 for a sandwich and fries.  

I hear at night the service, crowds can get pretty bad, but I've always went for lunch and generally the service/wait times were OK.  Yes, not good, just OK.  

I would never go here if I had the choice, but if I was with a group and ended up here for food, I could probably find something to hold me over to my next meal without being too upset about it.  All and all, this place is average at best."}
{"text":"I came in with a friend for some bar food on a Friday.

I have actually been here before with a friend before but only for drinks.

The place is pretty nice on the inside. Clean, fairly spacious and a cool atmosphere. We looked over the menus and started with quesadillas. The menu is pretty basic, most of your standard bar food, plus a few salads and a few other options. Nothing too crazy, but we really weren't looking for anything too different tonight so it was all good.

The quesadillas were pretty tasty. The cheese was melty and the corn and other contents were tasty as well. Not 5 minutes after our quesedillas came, so did our sandwiches. I ordered the (only available on Friday) beer battered cod sandwich and she got a buffalo chicken sandwich. Mine was pretty tasty. Very messy to eat but I think anything beer-battered is pretty good. The fish was a decent portion, too. I got tater tots for my side and these were pretty standard, as most tater tots are. She said she liked her buffalo chicken sandwich, and that's all I can say for that.

Our server was nice, but the entire experience seemed a little rushed. We got our sandwiches a bit too quickly after our appetizer came out. I wasn't even 75% done with my sandwich when we were asked if we wanted anything else, and when we said no she asked if we wanted the check. I'm not the fastest eater, but the whole sit down experience couldn't have been longer than 20 minutes, it was a little too rushed especially since there wasn't really anyone waiting to be seated.

My other qualm was the price. Our entire meal, 2 sandwiches and 1 appetizer, without drinks, came out to nearly $28. After tip, we were at nearly $35, for bar food, with just water as our drinks. I just think this was way too expensive for what it was. At nearly $20/person there are definitely better options in the area. I also remember the one time I came here last semester, the drinks were pretty expensive too.

Overall, it was expensive for what it was, I felt a little rushed, but the food wasn't bad."}
{"text":"This Saturday a small group of friends and I stopped in for a drink for my Birthday. It was busy, I'm not exactly sure how this place is still in business because every time I've gone I have had a bad experience. After my recent experience was so horrible I felt compelled to write a review. 

When we arrived we immediately noticed it was busy. We went downstairs to try to get a table and drink, no one was there so we immediately felt lucky. We all ordered a drink, and found a booth in the back. We had literally been down there long enough to take a sip when a bartender (male) approached us and very rudely told us they were closing downstairs and we had to leave; in which he gave us 5 minutes to \"get out\".

I mean, did I just die and wake up as a giant baby? Did this guy just speak to me as if I was a child who was up to no good? Yep! Ok, not a good start. My friend and I went to the bathroom downstairs before we decided to head back up-- assuming we could get in and out quickly. When we came out of the bathroom, we noticed our small group was being reprimanded by a security guard who clearly thought he was apart of the secret service. 

This guy. I mean, wow. He spoke to my friends as if they were scum, a big inconvenience to the establishment for being downstairs, when we were clearly ordered to go back upstairs -- how dare we?!! Apparently this jerkoff was asking them why they were not sprinting back upstairs and clearly violating a direct order. My boyfriend calmly explained that they were waiting for us to return from the bathroom -- By the way they were literally standing in the stair well.

Upstairs we received excellent service from the waitress who was very attentive and friendly. Which is such a shame, because no one was ordering another drink after that! Whilst my friends finished their drinks I quietly observed their security staff. They were all dressed similarly. Khaki cargo pants, which I'm sure were equipped with the essentials: flash light, pepper spray, a small picture of themselves to gaze upon during down time. One guy had on leather gloves... No joke! They all had ear pieces in and clearly thought very highly of themselves. I thought to myself, \"Secret Service Rejects\"!

The whole place is just terrible. The people who chose to spend their evening there were typical... Basic. Terrible! You should never treat patrons as if they're criminal. I would hate to claim that the experience ruined my birthday, but it did. I left not understanding why they had treated us so poorly. Had I just stepped into some time portal or a portion of Hell on Earth, where those in the service industry should be allowed to treat humans like dog shit? I will never go back. I will make it my JOB to tell everyone I know about our experience to ensure they don't go there."}
{"text":"Just an average bar with slightly above average bar food.  It is a nice atmosphere with an island bar and big booths around the perimeter.  There is a nice patio outside as well.  The service can be slow and uniformed at times, but nothing all that bad.

Food is pub grub.  Lots of burgers that are good.  A few other sandwiches and some apps as well.  Nothing is great, but certainly not bad.  Some Bell's and Goose Island on tap, but not much else on that front.  Nothing to go out of your way for, but a decent spot downtown."}
{"text":"Nachos are good but that's where it ends.  This place is over run with \"street pharmacists\". The staff has to be aware. I've seen it more than once. Instead of the morbid bouncers they have they should hire some security that don't get winded turning on and off a flashlight."}
{"text":"Going a few more times since last review, I think that the banality that is this place drags it out of the 3 stars range. If friends suggest Guido's, which they often do, because it is a vanilla compromise place, I cringe. I still go along, but my heels drag on the way there, and my feet get itchy after half a beer.

There are a million places just like Guido's on the North Side of Chicago, and I think that a high proportion of the patrons here represent next year's crop of Chads and LP Trixies. Guido's isn't 100% a Campustown bar, but its on the way. Teej T.'s observation re: the crowd is 100% accurate, and unfortunately asshats like this are more the rule than the exception. 

Food is pretty decent, prices a little on the high side for pub grub, but a good value for lunch. The place gets pretty crowded on Thurs-Sat nites, and the service gets understandably slow then. Good, but stingily-portioned onion ring sides. I say if you're gonna upcharge me for onion rings, I want a lot of 'em.

Objectively, the place is 'fine' in a ho-hum way. Subjectively, the intangible anti-culture, anti-intellectualism, anti-anything that is novel, interesting, and unique in favor of everything that is popular, faux-hawked, slutty, and top-40 brings this place down a peg."}
{"text":"After always going to the bars on campus, this is certainly a change-up in downtown Champaign. A chill atmosphere, a lot more older people, townies. Just something different outside of the college town. It took forever to get our food, but I must say even with a very limited menu, the food was delicious. Typical greasy food, but the western burger was just really good.

Surprisingly though the eggplant fries were amazingly delicious!. This was my first time trying eggplant fries, so good my friends and I had to get a second order! 

I would go here again, the prices aren't bad and the service could have been better, but when you're with people who make you laugh, it overshadows that. Go & try it out, even if it is just for the eggplant fries!"}
{"text":"Food just never up to par. Walk across the street to try something else. Good bar though."}
{"text":"I've had a mix of experiences here but one thing remains true: the Jack & Cokes are yummy (and I don't drink Jack) and the chicken quesadillas are amazing. It's an appetizer but as a meal, it's exactly what you need to accompany a beer or two. The sour cream, bacon, creamy whatever is delicious too. Service can be slow or they may ignore you depending on the time of day, but the food makes up for this 100%. And there's ample seating! One of my downtown haunts for sure."}
{"text":"Probably more like 3.5.
Listen, if you're looking for a fancy bar, you would know as soon as you walked in that this isn't it. I feel like some reviews here are punishing Guido's for being what it is: a place to grab decent burgers and bar food, beers, and maybe take a chance on a mixed drink. If you have a fancy drink request or want a specialty cocktail, perhaps you shouldn't go to a sports bar in a college town.
That said, I've never been here late at night, and I could completely see this as begin a place that would have a vibe I'd hate at that time (again - college town, people, know what you're getting into), but coming here on a weekend during the day or right after work is nice, especially if you want to watch some games."}
{"text":"An OK place for bar food and a decent selection of bottled beers though crafts is a short list. Place is clean and employees are very friendly"}
{"text":"I was really impressed with Guido's. Couple of my friends that attend UIUC love dining off-campus here, and I can see why - fab food, affordable beer menu, great service. I was surprised to not have to wait for a table during the height of Saturday dinner rush. Once I sat down our waitress came by, gave me a water and took my beer order. Totally friendly and personable, she took good care of us [wish I could remember her name!]. The five of us were catching up and she seemed to have perfect timing for when to come by for drink refills/seeing how we're doing.
I ended up with the Western burger and eggplant fries [thanks be to Yelp]. Totally in love with the entire meal. I'd never had an eggplant fry before and would come back just for a basket of those suckers. Definitely a cool place in an area that seems to be getting fairly hip."}
{"text":"Great burgers and bar atmosphere!

Came here a bunch back in the day, just havent been in awhile, but definitely worth grabbing a seat and ordering a burger."}
{"text":"Very disappointing tonight. I know it's pub food, so I didn't expect haute cuisine, but we hit on the evening (apparently) when seemingly half the menu, including the advertised special, are no longer being offered. I wouldn't even have minded this if we had been told when we were given our menus, but the server told us nothing about until we ordered all the wrong things. Service was slow and not terribly accurate, food was mediocre at best. I hate to pan a restaurant, but a good mood was impossible after this. Grateful that we have plenty of better options in downtown."}
{"text":"Ate at Guido's early Saturday evening. Great burgers, great service. Great date night- would love to go back and try the \"boozy milkshakes\""}
{"text":"Decent food and service, but I can honestly say that this is rarely on my list of places to go. In fact, I only go here when the rest of the group insists. I'm not sure what it is, but it's just...\"meh\" to me. I can easily go across the street and feel a lot more at ease and get better food and drinks."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, good bar food and great drank specials. Can spend hours here. Awesome patio, especially for solar eclipses. TVs on TV's in this place so always something to watch. Just wish the basement was open more, it's oddly cozy"}
{"text":"Had a grilled ham & cheese sandwich that was good. Tater tots were cooked just right. Sat at the bar and service was pretty poor considering it was a Saturday evening and they weren't very busy."}
{"text":"This is a bar that i have been to a lot of networking and social events so I can only speak to that aspect of the business. I have not come to this restaurant and sat upstairs to get real service or anything. But, there is a great space downstairs that is versatile and easily used for events. 

The bartenders are always very friendly and nice. Also, the bar food is fantastic but it usually is always running late coming out of the kitchen. But please, indulge in the quesadillas, tiny burgers, and chicken fingers with honey mustard :D."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today. Carle coworker (who I was at dog of blackness with yesterday) had decided we wanted to have Black Bean Burgers from the carle coffee shop today. When we got to the coffee shop, it was inexplicably closed. So as we sadly walked back to our desks, we pondered \"where can we get a black bean burger from?\" He mentioned \"doesn't guido's have them\" and I'm like \"yeah\". But we also wanted to get the fried mushrooms, and sadly, guido's doesn't have fried mushrooms. On a happy note, they have eggplant fries. 
So, we drive to downtown Champaign. 
Walk into Guidos. I  attempt to sit at the bar (as I'm bar folk) but he doesn't prefer that (he gets plumbers crack sometimes and doesn't like to sit in exposed back chairs... tmi?) So we grab a booth. 
Immediately a server comes to take our drink order, mountain dew for me, diet for him. Drinks arrived momentarily. She asks if we need some time to look at the menu. As we knew what we were in for, we said \"nope\". Both ordered the black bean burger, his with fries, mine a side of the eggplant fries and toppings on the side. 
I go to do outside things. 
I come inside, sit down, we chat about office things. Food arrives shortly thereafter.
Black bean burger is as good as a black bean burger can be (and that's pretty good). Eggplant fries are both eggplant and fried. He tries one, as he's never heard of such a thing, he becomes a fan. 
She refills his diet. 
Food is done, she asks if we are ready to pay, we say yes. She drops the checks. She comes back a minute later when we've pulled out our cards. She runs them. She brings it back. We sign. We go.
It's about as perfect a blackbean burger and eggplant fries lunch as you could ask for.  
I managed to not go play the devil boxes."}
{"text":"Wallet was left there and when it was returned there was no cash. Could have been someone else who took it but i got a bad vibe from the staff."}
{"text":"Uggh I think Guido's is my favorite bar in champaign.  The \"uggh\" is because my favorite place in champaign still has miller light girls wearing slutty referree outfits at football games.  

I'm pretty sure they have the best bloody mary's in town, and their pineapple upside down cake martini is more or less killer-- as are all their specialty cocktails, for that matter.  Which is probably why if you go after 9PM, even if you are lucky enough to not have to stand in line, you almost definitely won't be able to get a table."}
