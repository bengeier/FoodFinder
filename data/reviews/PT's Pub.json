{"text":"A big group of us are here today to have a good time.. Drink, shoot some pool and let me tell you the bartender is absolutely horrible. There is just a few other people here.  I came up to the bar to ask if they can put the game we came in for on one of the TVs and it took FOREVER for her to even acknowledge me sitting at the bar.. Then she says to me, \"I really have to finish this story (and points to a male customer) but what do you want?\" - rudely.  Then I come up to the bar a little later after our group has already spent quite a bit on drinks, and I'm trying to order food for us ... Guess what, I sit there with the menu in hand for at least 10-15 mins and still no acknowledgement... I sit and patiently wait as she's talking it up with another male customer then goes on her cell. Finally I said, fu*k it.  I cannot believe how horrible the customer service is. And I think it's because either I'm not a regular or I don't have the right body parts. I am utterly appalled. And, no I will never return to this location.  You are losing money with this bartender running your bar."}

Overall a very friendly staff. And ALWAYS a great time. I wish I could give more than 5 stars!! Hands down. Best bar staff ever."}
{"text":"I usually LOVE the pt's on Sahara, but we were on the other side of town and tried this location.   There was a drunk couple at the bar arguing about being \"from\" Las Vegas. The bartender, named 'Tip' entertained this argument instead of trying to calm the couple down. He also used profanity loudly during the conversation. This made the atmosphere feel chaotic and slightly aggressive.   We arrived for happy hour, ordered 1 beer, Tip charged us 6.50 for the beer. We asked about happy hour prices and why we were over charged and he seemed to get frustrated with us. But then realized he was, indeed, overcharging us and proceeded to put 2 bucks cash on the counter in an irritated manner, saying \"I will just GIVE you the 2 dollars so you can exist happily\" this was rude and unprofessional.  We weren't being obnoxious customers. Especially not obnoxious compared to the drunk couple that Tip kept arguing with.  Lastly, Tip was talking to a guy next to us and said very clearly \"I can't wait until this game is over, I hate this crowd\"  We were there to watch a game, so was he referring to us? Or all the yelling customers around the bar?   Either way, as a bartender, his performance and attitude was negative and unpleasant. We will not be returning"}
{"text":"This place sucks!! If your black don't come here I heard the bartender say something as if he hates black... FYI I use to like this place but now I would never ever go to pts again... oh yea and good luck getting a drink here... in the manager at night sucks and he walk around like he owns the place"}
{"text":"Don't go twice I've been in to eat and there's a crazy guy. Once with a bat. And today he verbally attacked me. The bartender said nothing about the bat.

{"text":"First impression was this would be a good evening watching preeason bears game.  Bartender was cool, but thats were it ends.  This place was not like the website.  Their half off food specials was only pizza i was told.  Bucket wings was short on expectations, small hard peices, over sauced, even short on amount, no way near worth the $12 price. I gambled on poker machine an was even charged $2.50 for a soda, lol big joke, but took it out of the bartenders unearned tip.  Overall, PT's Pub is not the locals place i experienced or recommend to go to."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong the servers are amazing both Drea & Rachel are absolutely the BEST!! .... BUT the GM Scott has horrible customer service UNLESS you're a personal friend of his, he won't talk to you or try to help you out, I've been coming here for months now and consider my self a regular seeing how everyone else remembers me and not once has he approached me or introduced himself I've literally sat at the bar for over an hour and he never once asked if I needed anything. And I've seen him give so much more attention to his buddy's then everyone else, favoritism is really a factor when it comes to him, only reason I come to this location Still is because of the bartenders they're awesome they make you feel welcomed and do their absolute best to serve you.  Corporate really needs to have a talk with him or replace him cause he needs serious improvement."}

Your paying customers should be able to pay to listen to the music they want to. I will continue to give you guys one star reviews until this is fixed. Why would you filter out music from you jukebox ??!?!?  Do not come here unless you want to listen to the worst music selection ever."}
{"text":"This place was horrible. Horrible service and horrible drinks.  The bartender Laura was extra horrible. It was hard to get her attention when we needed assistance because she was too busy flirting for tips. Just horrible horrible and we would not ever go back here again. A waste of time and money."}
{"text":"My story begins on Saturday night, November 21 2015. I decided to go out with a friend to your location on Tropicana and Maryland Parkway and the night began like any other. I came in and was carded and then sat at the bar. The bar was very crowded so the service time wasn't good at all. There was only one bartender working which I didn't understand since it was a busy Saturday night, but that's material for a different complaint letter. My friend and I ended up waiting for 20 minutes until we were even able to get a menu and a drink. The bartender was a male, possibly Samoan or Hawaiian, and he had curly hair that was up in a ponytail.  After sitting at the bar for awhile longer he was finally able to take our order. My friend ordered boneless chicken wings and fries, and I got the messy tatter tots and a barbeque chicken pizza. With the food, drinks, and the extremely generous tips that we gave, our totally came to a little over sixty dollars....for two people. My friend and I ate and enjoyed the atmosphere. My friend could barely finish the wings and friends and I ended up eating the whole tatter tot plate and I had a slice of pizza. We were both extremely full, especially since we were drinking beers. I then asked the bartender if he could give me a to go box or something for my pizza since I was full and couldn't eat it, this is where the night turned bad. When I originally ordered the pizza, I asked him if he could give it to me in a to go box and he said no we had to eat it there, I said not a problem and followed directions. Since the pizza was $9 dollars I ended up tipping him another $9 dollars since I got the discount. Once I asked for a to go box the bartender ended up flipping out on me in front of my friend and other bar goers. He said and I quote  \"You're going to have to eat more of that pizza or else I'll have to charge you full price man!\"  I then replied \"are you serious? Even though I spent all of this money?\"  He then said \"Yeah man, I have to charge you full price. You've been here before man so you know the drill, you knew what you were doing man, trying to pull a fast one on us. It's a dine-in only deal and I should be charging you to cover my ass from my boss but I guess I'll let it slide\" and he said it in the rudest tone possible, yelling and talking to me like I was a child. It was shocking to me especially since I spend at least $100+ dollars at this location a week and always tip extremely well...yet I can't take a pizza out of the building without catching a case from the bartender? The quality of the pizza wasn't even good either but that's material for another complaint letter as well. I don't see how you guys could charge $18 dollars for that bland pizza let alone give it to people half off with an attitude. Next time I will just go to Albertsons and get beer then go to pizza hut. It'll be cheaper and far less attitude will come with it. Quality of the food was bad, service was terrible, I was talked to like I was a child in the rudest manner possible, and on top of all of that the bartender ultimately ruined my night because I wanted to stay at the bar and drink more but I was so angry about the pizza that we left. I just didn't want my pizza sitting out while we were drinking so I wanted to put it away in a box....but having these wishes came with the consequence of getting talked to like a dog by your bartender. I don't know what needs to change but he shouldn't have gotten attitude with me. Another thing that I acknowledge is that he's under pressure because it's company policy to not let people walk out with pizzas. But if people are paying customers then why won't you let people leave? Especially if they've eaten at least one slice like I did. I bet if I told any Kids hunger program or World hunger program that you tried to force me to eat a pizza or suffer the consequences of having to pay more they would be appalled. The funny part too is that he had already cashed my bill out and I ate for awhile then he threatened to charge me more for leaving with the pizza! It's absolutely ridiculous. You can't force people to do anything after they've paid for the food and are constant paying customers of yours. Next time I'm at a PT's and someone threatens to charge me more $ for not eating I will make it more public then you can imagine. This is ridiculous service and that bartender needs to brush up on his customer service. If his service had been better I would of stayed longer and bought more drinks. Even if he had just said it to me nicely that I couldn't leave with the pizza THEN I WOULDN'T HAVE! But he was so rude and such a douche that I had to write a complaint. If he is seriously losing his mind over a pizza then maybe you guys need to reconsider him as an employee. You guys just lost a good loyal paying customer due to your bartender having a bad day and giving me attitude over A PIZZA. That's totally worth losing my constant business (sarcasm). Goodbye PT's"}
{"text":"Service suck bartender aways on his phone and rude. I ask Daniel for my 10 dollars back for my hamburger because he walk to the back where the cook was so I don't know what he went back there and said. I ask him did he tell the cook to spit in my hamburger he said yes JUST A LITTLE BIT in a sarcastic manner. He refused to give me my money back then called the cops for no reason. On the way out I ask Mr. Daniel for his manager name he refuse to give it to me he said the manager would be in around 4pm tomorrow on the 5th are 6th time I ask him he gave me his manager name. Something should be done about this young man I been to alot of PT'S and this one is the worst one. I'll take that back can't let one bad worker mess it up for the whole business."}
{"text":"This is my favorite PTs in town. Kinda a rough neighborhood, but I love the bartenders. Especially James and Aluna"}
{"text":"This was by far the worst place I have been too. I entered the bar and the bar tender gave my friend attitude over his passport and not his ID. Then when it was all said and done I spent over 20 in gaming. I earned 26 pts and my friend earned 28. He refused to comp my drink because I played my machines by entering 5 instead of a 20 bill. Honestly it was a slap in the face for a 5 dollar drink. I'm grateful I'm not a crabby old man like him."}

{"text":"Why I will never step foot in a PTs again. Golden Gaming sent me some free play so me and my wife stopped by the PTs Place on Sahara about 5 in the morning only to be met by the rudest bartender in Vegas. My wife puts $20 in her machine and starts playing I punched in my free play and started playing. It took the bartender at least 5 minutes to get to me even though there was only one other person in the bar I handed him a $20 and told him to give me back $19 and give me a beer. He very rudely told me he couldn't comp me until I played $20 I put a $20 in the machine even though I had already lost $15 he then says I had to play a dollar a hand because I was playing Cleo keno I have played at PTs for years and never heard such a thing I start off betting 2 quarters and add one quarter to it every time I get a bonus in till I Max out at 10 quarters. I told my wife let's go. Golden Gaming without the locals you would be out of business you are not too big to fail so keep the small free play you send me and I will play at Dotties where my play is appreciated and they have no problem comping a beer. There's a reason the bar was empty your rude bartender"}
{"text":"As much as I love the wings here (which has had the price jacked up lately) this place just doesn't know good customer service. 20 mins to get drink that turned out to be the wrong order, very dirty bar that didn't look like it had been cleaned in the last 12 hours. Even more disgustingly dirty bathroom, and this was early evening, I can't imagine what this place looks like after it gets busy in the later evening. If the public areas are this dirty I can't imagine what the kitchen might look like. By far the WORST BARTENDER SERVICE EVER,,(or lack thereof) and this is based on at least 5 visits thinking it might get better..... forever to get a drink, if it is the right order it's watered down, then the check is wrong and the bartender gets an attitude about correcting the tab accusing me of trying to cheat him. As I ask if he remembered serving me cosmopolitans (which I hate and never drink yet had 4 on my tab) I remembered he couldn't remember I ordered crown/coke to begin with when I did order it. Oh yeah, and very little comp for playing $80 in, max bet on quarters and only got two drinks comped? Management really needs to overhaul the staff here big time. Used to be the pinnacle of service standards some years ago. Lots of pooltables is really the only plus here."}
{"text":"Great bar with a good menu. It's a little smokey inside, which can be overwhelming if you're not a smoker. Try the chicken strips and have a cocktail. The bartenders are friendly and know how to make pretty much anything. They're also kinda hot with those leather vests."}
{"text":"If I could give it 0 stars, I would. Came for the UNLV-Arizona basketball. Waited 45 minutes to order one drink because they had two bartenders in the entire place. No clue who the manager is but they cost that place hundreds of dollars that night. Embarrassing."}
{"text":"I have spent a couple of my evenings at PTs and it's always been a fun time. They have good music and karaoke as well. There's a woman always working when I go, she goes by Texas! She is a excellent bar tender and is great with The customers. I would recommend going here if you're looking for a laid back relaxed kind of night."}
{"text":"I've been to a dozen or so PT across the valley in my 17 years in Vegas. I WILL NEVER go back to this particular PT's as the comp \"system\" is beyond ridiculous! I played Max credit because I was asked to. OK no problem. Put $40 in the machine during my stay which was 45min. or so. Also bought an appetizer which was fine. I put 140 points on my card (that's $140 into the machine in every casino in town) and STILL had to pay for a 2nd beer. Why would ANYONE pay $40 for 2 beers (let alone $180 when you consider the points I put on my card.). I expect a better system than this. Local pubs NEED to treat locals better! If the \"management team\" replies to this, I expect a better reply than \"we will address this\"."}

{"text":"Normally I LOVE going to PT's. I've been to quite a few in LV already! This was my first time at this location. It sucked that the jukebox didn't work, but I get that the bartenders have no control over that. So I ordered my usual drinks, and also asked for the mac and cheese wedges. The guy repeated back to me, \"mac and cheese bites\"? And I said yes. 10-15 min later, they come out with mozzarella sticks. When I come back to the counter, I said I asked for mac and cheese wedges. He then replies that they didn't have any as the menu had changed, etc. Well, you should have said that at the beginning! Mozzarella sticks are literally twice the price, and not worth it in my opinion. Whatever, I deal with it. I'm tipsy and want food. I go to pay in cash, but tell him to keep a tab open because I'm going to keep ordering and eventually pay in card. He almost gave me an offended look when I took my change (as in no tip). I go back to order and ask if Orchard is a part of happy hour, and in a sharp tone he replies \"It never was.\" ...um...ok? Whatever, I took a hefe. I start to walk away, and he yells \"You don't have a tab anymore!\" Ok... So i asked for my i.d. back. Not sure why he wouldn't give it back to me to begin with if that was the case. This was all on top of the bathroom being a mess (pee everywhere, cigarette ashes all over the toilet seat, and the whole thing was filled with cigarette smoke). While I remained calm through everything, I most certainly won't return to this location."}

{"text":"I really wish I could give this place zero stars! But since I can't, I'll say that one star is for the food because it is the only thing that's worth mentioning. I went here with my best friend for a quick girl's night out and the drinks were terrible. Shannon was our bartender/waitress and the poor lady can't make drinks to save her life. We left after paying our bill and said maybe she was having a bad night, so we'll try again another time since we live so close.   Today was the day for that 2nd chance....maybe Shannon has a bad night every night because today was worse than the last time. My drink was so bad, I sent it back and asked for it to be remade. When she brought back, it was just as bad as before so I left the whole drink on the table (the 1st drink was practically full also). When she brought the bill, she had charged me for 2 drinks. Absolutely not, you see this whole drink in front of you and you know you took almost another full drink away because I was not happy with them. So why are you charging me for two drinks???  My friend ordered a drink and hers wasnt too bad so she was going to order another one since it was happy hour, but Shannon deliberately did not come back to the table until 701p (when happy hour was over). We had our food and it was all pretty much gone with no service to see how it was, if anything was needed. Nothing! Was she busy, NOPE!! There were only 3 other ppl in the place. It's practically a ghost town in there. That's how I know it was deliberate.   Also when I ordered my food, I informed her that the last time I was there, I was charged for sweet potato fries but didn't get them. I didn't fret last time over the $2, but I did mention it because I wanted to be sure I received them this time. Do you think she was friendly and offered to take the extra $2 off this order for her mistake last time??? Nope!!   So will I ever go back to this PTs that is close to my home, yes I will. For chicken only (because it was very good) but not at all for drinks! We are now here at Winchells and my Long Island Iced Tea is amazing. Thank you Jasmine for setting this night right Shannon, come down here and take some lessons on customer service AND bartending!!"}
{"text":"This place is a dump...i've frequented several PT's  all over the valley & i must say that this particular PT's ranks at the bottom of the barrel..it's too small & cramped i felt like i was trapped inside of a milk carton... It smells like \"stale\" cigarette smoke the bartenders are like off in their own little world...the food blows like they just microwave all their shit..& the best part (not) is that their drinks are RIDICULOUSLY expensive!! $6.95 for a shot?(not even a real shot half a shot is more like it) when I can go down the road and get an actual shot for 3 bucks? INSANITY!!!they're always out of shit too...like seriously somebody has a real inventory and stocking problem...how the hell can you be out of domestic beer? That's just simply retarded to put it mildly...won't be going back to this PT's as a matter of fact I probably won't be visiting anymore PT's period! 2 thumbs down"}
{"text":"Had poor service with bartender Trevor. Treated my friends poorly because a song came on that he didn't like and assumed that we had played it which was not the case. Other than that I really enjoy going to this bar. But Trevor was not nice towards us, threaten to kick us out if the song came on again while we were in the bar."}
{"text":"Came in last night for a drink with a friend of mine. The bartender asked me for my id and i asked \"when is happy hour?\" She relplied \"Now now\" and gave me sarcastic smile. I paid for my drink with my debit card and she never gave it back, never asked me if i wanted to keep a tab. After i got my first drink and an order of fries, I waited for her to come around to see if i needed snother drink. Before I knew it, 45 minutes had gone by. My friend finally waved down another bartender and asked him whats on the happy hour menu. He gave us a menu and i asked \"So is it half off appitizers?\" He said \"No its not on the menu we have to tell you one one.\" (I dont know why he gave me a menu that doest have what i asked for) He then said he didnt know what was on the happy hour menu and slowly looked away and brushed us off. Finally we had enough and decided to leave this place due to rude bartenders, waited another 15 min to get their attention again to ask for my debit card that i never i wanted to use to keep a tab in the first place. Horrible service, We will absolutelty never be back to this location!"}
{"text":"Bartenders are rude and although i got my first drink pretty fast, it took 20 min to be asked if i wanted another one every time after that. I tried to order food and get their attention but they walk right by me pretending they dont see me waving at them or hear me say 'excuse me'"}
{"text":"This is the worst bar that I've been to.  It wasn't even that busy and the food took 30 minutes.  This was for a quesadilla with no real cheese.  You don't even have to melt the cheese because it already comes melted for you.  After 20 minutes of finally ordering a drink,  I could not get a second one.  I do not recommend the food, service.  You get better service at another pub."}

{"text":"I agree with Brian. This PT Pub needs to advertise more. This is the best one by far. They are located just behind Village Pub, on Eastern and Sunridge Heights, kind of hidden, but a great place!!  They also have a Great pizza and happy hour special.  We can buy a pizza and 2 drinks for $13.00 during 4pm and 7pm.  The waitress is a sweetheart, but bored, because it is so slow.  There is another PT Gold just 2 blocks away, that is full of smoke, and very noisy, behind St. Rose Sienna Hospital, that is always packed, because they advertise.  Come on PT PUB, advertise!!  Don't go out of business, we love you."}
{"text":"Went to try hamburger the other day was so greasy and fries so hard..before they had a better cook..don't know what happened..won't goback for awhile"}
{"text":"I go to this place at least 3 times a week because I live across the street.  When I first started coming here last year the service and the food were both good.  As of late the service is non existent and the food is ok when it finally shows up.  Tonight I was having a couple of drinks with a friend during happy hour.  There were only 15 people in the place.  I made the mistake of ordering nachos.  After 20 minutes I asked if they were almost ready and was told yes they're on the way.  After 35 minutes no nachos.  I asked to cancel them and I was told they're on the way.  I've made nachos once or twice in my life and know that it doesn't take this much time when only 3 other people have ordered food.    after 40 minutes I told the bartender to cancel the order.  He then told me that if I was going to come in and order food then cancel it; to never come back again.  40 minutes for nachos?  He then started cussing at me along with the cook that tried to tell me that he had to cook the paper thin steak from scratch.  This place is always empty and I finally figured out why!  Too many options in Vegas to put up with this type of BS!  Never again!!  I'll go somewhere else to get ignored and get treated like crap!"}
{"text":"So glad this changed to a PT's it use to be a \"Tom Fooleries\" and it use to be horrible!!! Now they have fixed the place up and replaced the staff. They are very professional and friendly. I have taken my kids to eat here some nights, safe and tasty!"}
{"text":"It might be easier to just list their regular-priced schedules, since their happy hours are extensive. Half-priced drinks and half-priced pizza (surprisingly good with a super thin, crispy crust) are available 3-7 p.m. And again 12mn through 5 a.m.  They have around 20 beers on tap and regular price for 32oz is around $7 and $3.50 at happy hour. The ambience is pleasant enough, the furniture comfortable enough, with flat screens scattered liberally throughout. Nothing to write home about, but a perfectly adequate neighborhood bar."}

Now I'm a very open minded person so I can hang out with any crowd and still be comfortable and still have a great time. but this place was so dead there was no one to talk to. and the bartender was in and out of the back I only got two drinks after playing $30   they do have a few pool table and nice size bar and a really nice seating area for watching the big screens. but all bars these days have those and this is definitely not where I'll be taking my girlfriends next time I want to have a girls night out or just a nice night at the bar."}
{"text":"The service was very good tonite ... No complaints on the food... Not my regular spot but I do enjoy coming here with the wife when we do..."}
{"text":"I've been to this PT's twice in a week. Both days different ladies are bartending. Came in with my cousin who is visiting from Cali to do some catching up!  Last time was a thick Asian girl second time big white chick. BOTH times terrible service! I don't know what we did wrong but the first time the lady was just flat out rude with an attitude for no reason. She was very short and looked like she was ready to leave (which she did and another bartender took over who was friendly hence the two stars). Second time was tonight. Came here with my cousin and co worker. They looked a tad busy so we sat down and played while waiting to be acknowledged since both bartenders were busy but then 20 mins go by and nothing. No one asks us if we need a drink or any help! The lady who was helping on our side wouldn't even make eye contact with us at all! So I cashed out and left! I'm so disappointed because this place is right down the street from me."}
{"text":"Cool spot to come grab a drink during happy hour. Good prices, cheap smokes. Can get packed tho."}
{"text":"Pretty cool atmosphere here. Cool place to hang out with friends, a boyfriend/girlfriend,  even for new dates. The drinks are great, has pool tables and a few arcade games. Great bar to relax, cool prices."}
{"text":"I was out celebrating my 21st and.  Rachel/Texas was amazing!! Such an awesome personality. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Fish Sliders are excellent! If you like Fish n Chips you will enjoy the Fish Sliders. The slaw is full of flavor crispy fish all works together."}
{"text":"Don't ever go there. Drinks  not good music it not good either that place don't even deserves a one star"}
{"text":"This was a 2nd choice for viewing the Stanley Cup, after a Summerlin \"Irish\" pub would not play the Bruins game (Wha)?. Anywho, this PT's was very friendly, cheap drinks and a bartender that was cheering loud and hard for Hockey!! My new go-to hide out!"}
{"text":"Chicken fingers were a little on the crunchy side and dry french fries were kind of sorry the mozzarella cheese sticks were okay not enough marinara sauce though the chili cheese fries we're good so that being said I give them 4 stars it was really quiet and not a lot of people there so I can't really judge the atmosphere but the seatings look nice and the bartender was kind"}
{"text":"Aggh tonight was the last straw. Came to gamble with my boyfriend and a friend. The rude bartender dude doesn't give 1 crap. He is rude. When the machine wasn't working he said well just guess it's keno seriously dude he couldnt just calibrate it. We wanted some of their bomb wings but honestly the BS service is not even worth it."}
{"text":"This shitty as bartender had 3 people at the bar today. Took 10 min from when I walked in to ask me what I want. Got a flat miller lite. Then when I asked price for the beers she snapped back and said \"you want me to tell you all 25 of them\" then laughed a sarcastic laugh. I asked what blue moon was and she goes \"it's 6.25 and walked away\" I then waited another 5 minutes til she got done emptying every ash tray at the bar to come back and take my order. I was there to watch the Spurs game and she refused to change the TV that was in front of me from some day time crime show and told me I had to move to the other side of the bar to watch it, right next to the old couple playing the game machines. Terrible service, terrible attitude, I didn't even tip her."}
{"text":"We waited for about 5 minutes at the bar- no service, sat a table for another 15-20 no service. Blonde bartender with curly short hair was talking with everyone, she looked straight at us multiple times but didn't even acknowledge us. Had to walk out! Very poor service! We think she was waiting for happy hour to end to come serve us."}
{"text":"Not a  huge fan of PTs . The food is good but I feel like you have to know the bartender and come in everyday to get good service. I asked for a simple cherry coke and he came back with no cherries. I had to ask for cherries in a cherry coke????I got the stink eye when I complained lol....well I do like cherries in my coke ! SORRY! I only nibbled on my friends plate so I don't feel the abilty to review their food to much lol"}
{"text":"I have been going to this PT's for a little while. Its very close to my house which is really cool. Lisa and Angel are the best bartenders. They really take care of me every time I come in. The atmosphere is pretty good for being an older PT's. The food is very good especially there hamburgers and chicken wings. Another reason I come here its a pretty clean bar for being as old as it is. The drinks are cheap during happy hour too."}
{"text":"Though I hate the smell of people dying from cigarettes, this bar is my favorite around the university area. Pool tables, sweet jukebox, beer pong tables, and a great staff. Bobby is probably my favorite bartender as of now.   It is heavy on the smoke inside, but I get past it when hanging out with my friends here. They have amazing food, at least as far as what I have had. Pizza, wings, the chicken caesar salad and club sandwich is my favorite !  They may not have a huge variety of beer, they can make pretty much any drink you want. Bobby makes a pretty good AMF.   Thursday nights are UNLV pride nights as well as karaoke night. Come in wearing any UNLV gear and you get discounts on drinks. Like $2 bud light for me last night! Plus get drunk and sing ridiculous songs all night. I cannot sing Summer Lovin' from Grease sober, that is for sure.   Then everyday from 4-7pm and 12am-3am is Happy Hour.   I really love coming here to just sit and have a beer some nights. It is chill and a favorite hole in the wall place in my eyes. If you go there as often as I do, you would want to request a Beer and Bites card. Reward card for food and drinks, as well as needing it for Happy Hour prices. Another rewards card to add to the collection of the one's I already have from every casino in town, no biggy. haha   PTs, you may not be the most cleanliness place in town, but you have your style of attractiveness that lures people in.  I'll be seeing you soon!"}
{"text":"Sean the bartender and Thomas the cook make this place awesome. My husband and I go here frequently and it's never been bad. Clean, well stocked and always a friendly crowd. Sean always makes sure to serve us as soon as we walk in and is always charming. Thomas the cook is amazing and takes pride in his food and is super sweet. Thomas also likes to talk sports with my husband which is nice touch. Happy hour is on point and the atmosphere is chill. Overall, this is the coolest PT'S in Vegas just based on chill factor and kindness. This says a lot because we like to drink and we like wings. Boom...confetti!"}
{"text":"I was recently at PT's off of Durango, which is two minutes away from my house and is my go to spot. I have came to this location for a couple years now and I usually have a good experience. Today, my bartender was Jen and I must say, you'd think if you were in the customer service industry, you'd actually provide good customer service. She did not provide anything but a horrible attitude. First of all, when I came in, my friend and I could barely sit down before she demanded my ID. After she spent a minute or so looking over it, she got my drink and slammed it on the bar. She didn't provide me with a beverage napkin or anything of sorts. It took me ten minutes to ask her for a water because I'm going to assume I'm a female and I'm not gambling. I watched her talk to every GUY at the bar and ignored me. I have been a cocktail waitress and a bartender for over 7 years and I know there is someone who would love to have her job. She needs to be re-trained to accommodate her customers. I'm sick and tired of seeing Waitresses/Bartenders be a complete asshole for no reason. You have one job. Do it right or find another one. I will not be coming back here when Jen is working ever again."}
{"text":"I've been coming here on and off since I moved to Vegas the Summer of 2008.   The setup is your basic bar in Vegas... which are poker/slot/black jack machines at the bar, as well as regular sitting, no machine in front of you. They also house pool tables, a few arcade games, a little lounge area to sit down and watch TV, juke box, and brand new flat screen TVs . There is not a kitchen at this location but rather a Roberto's next door and Hawaiian BBQ is a 4 minute walk away.   Initially I started coming here because it was close to where I was staying at the time and they had great happy hour specials. The happy hour times changed a bit since then, they are currently from 4-7pm and 12am-3am everyday and all drinks are half price. In addition to good deals, they also have Sunday Ticket so you can find me here on Sundays too.   Overall, it's a basic bar that stands out in customer service. All the bartenders I've met here are really cool. Of course a few have came and gone, but all replacements are open to customers make you feel comfortable. This place is pretty well kept, even when you stumble in at 2:30am."}
{"text":"Many locals have their \"own\" PTs, this one's mine. Go in often for lunch, usually get the double burger special. Usually Kat is there to cook it, and usually Tracy is behind the bar. Both are always nice, and the burger always hits the spot."}
{"text":"I have to put 1 star but if I could, I'd not even give half a star. We had to leave as they wanted to ID 2 people who were clearly in their 60s. They're visiting from out the country without passports on them. With my husband and I in our late 20s early 30s had ID. Rules are rules, but common sense should always prevail they didn't want our business apparently. We just took it up the road to have the dozen drinks we planned on having on our last night in town. Cheers."}
{"text":"I love to go to sports bars on Friday nights to watch my favorite sports team. PT's is a highly recommended sports bar. PT's wings and burgers are really tasty. In my opinion PT's is not the best sports bar but one of the best. Keep doing good PT's your a wonderful sports bar!"}
{"text":"If you've ever been to a PT's, you know what to expect.  You'll walk in to find a dimly lit video poker bar showing various sports on multiple TV's, maybe a pool table, and some couches.  Well......that's what you'll find here.   The bar tender here had no problem putting on a hockey game for me on one of the TV's, and discussing his thoughts on a few of the seasonal beers they had on tap.  Since this is close to my house, I come here from time to time to catch a game or grab a pint with a friend.    Not too much to get crazy about here, but nothing too horrible either."}
{"text":"Best bar in Vegas, especially for locals who don't want to deal with the Strip hype. GREAT service, GREAT food. Even when they are noticeably busy, my friends and I feel like VIPs. Beer is always prompt and cold. LOVE THIS PLACE!!"}
{"text":"PT's at spring mnt and arville has to be the worse of them all... it took 20 minutes for the chubby bartender to acknowledge me, and it wasnt even busy , she just keep walking by me like i was invisible, and when she finally got my beer, it was the wrong size and the wrong beer...will definately not going back there...."}
{"text":"Used to go to this bar quite a bit in the past. Recently we stopped in for a beer, and we were very disappointed. It was very smokey, and it did not seem that there was any ventilation working. It used to have several pool tables, and a Trivia game as well as an upbeat atmosphere. Now it seems depressing with everyone's focus on the slot machines. The Bartender took awhile to take our order, and never made eye contact until he decided to take our drink order."}
{"text":"Awesome service.  (Thanks Jen!)  Beer selection as expected.  Great pool but no Darts!!!  Location is convenient and parking is not an issue!  Other customers were friendly and happy!"}
{"text":"Great place, awesome breakfast. It is located in a plaza next to Jerusalem restaurant, foot massage place, and blueberry hill. I can waste a whole day swing between these places.   Music is old school and that's cool. Had pt platter with breakfast and two ciders. Waitress is fun, can hold a conversation but leaves you alone if you want. 3 in the afternoon and there is only one other couple in here.   It's smaller than most other PTs around town but that actually makes it Kind of cool."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were regulars, at this location, when Rick was the bartender. We moved to Henderson and have been back about 3 times since. The past experiences have not been pleasant, but we continued to give it a chance, because at some point this was our favorite happy hour. However, John has given us the worst service ever!!! He interrupted my boyfriend as he politely said \" John may I have another...\" he said \"hold on!\" As if he was bothering him. We both work in the service industry, so we gave him the benefit of the doubt and continued to wait. We then saw him on his phone, talking to other guests, and avoiding our area. When he finally made it back to us, my boyfriend accidently dropped his tray of french fries, John was furious and my boyfriend said \" sorry brother\", to which I replied \"we've been waiting long enough\" and he said \" so then he drops shit in my bar?\" Oh hell no!! I said \" I work behind a bar and know accidents happen\" he then stayed quiet and we decided to take our money elsewhere. This bartender is rude and should not be behind the bar.....I'd rather drive an extra 10 miles to go see Rick at his new spot."}
{"text":"It's a good place to hangout and drink, Saturdays are especially sweet because they have karaoke. It just needs more lighting and a better happy hour menu, or at least new items to choose from."}
{"text":"The food was awesome.. Service too. Very quiet. Good music..Definitely will be going back.."}
{"text":"The food was good, service was great.....yet I am still in utter disbelief that the graveyard bartender waived my 100% tip to the on-coming dayshift bartender(right in front of us) who did not wait on us at all.  If I had known Jason was that independently wealthy, I would have kept my money.  What a slap in the face!"}
{"text":"This place is a solid bar-staple in Las Vegas.  My understanding is that there are 54 locations in town, all of them 24 hours with happy hour from 4-7p.m. and again from midnight till 3.    Happy hour equals half-off ALL drinks and giant pizzas with your choice of toppings.   The bartenders are usually friendly and efficient.  It's always smoky---yes they could use more ventilation, but so could every bar.  Pool tables, a few arcade games, megatouch, and of course video poker, ensure that something can always keep your fingers busy at PT's."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to just hang out, have a drink and watch the game, or gamble.  It is officially licensed as a casino, so they do serve food along with allowing smoking.  The ventilation is pretty good at this location, so its not too smoggy in there.    The swing shift bartenders are awesome (Alyssa & Ben), and seem to never forget a name or face - or drink for that matter.  There is a decent local following at this location, lots of the same faces, young and old, most of the time.  They have a decent variety of beers on tap, which I appreciate, because I hate beers like Bud, Miller, etc.  Our favorite is the black velvet - Guinness floated on pear cider (some people call it a snakebite).   The menu is your standard bar food.  I love the chili cheese fries and the nachos.  Be wary of ordering any of the monthly food specials though.  I don't know who comes up with these weird combinations, but I've never had a good one.  Stick with the main menu.  I've had better luck here with the poker machines here than any casino in town.  That's not to say that there haven't been days where I've lost my britches.  They have progressive machines, but watch where you sit if you want to play it, not all of the machines are on the progressive.  A few of the machines are triple play, but not many.   Their players reward program is decent.  If you're gonna play, make sure to sign up for it so you get the meal comps/discounts and cash rewards.  There are also three pool tables, which are often busy, and couches with big screen TV's.  The place is clean and maintained well.  The only problem with this location is the women's bathroom has some sort of ventilation problem that flares up at times (sewer stink) so I have to knock 1 star off for that.  But other than that, the best PT location in town, hands down."}
{"text":"Me and my husband come here regularly! Sometimes it's just us and others with friends. We live in the apartments across the street so we love coming here. The bar tender that works the graveyard shift, I think his names roger, is awesome! We're already regulars so as soon as we walk in he pours our drinks cus he knows exactly what we're gonna get! If you're there graveyard and this guys your bartender give him a good tip!"}
{"text":"I am giving the bartender 5 stars only because there arent 10 stars. BUT the cook on graveyard, who has worked there 9 years, ought to stay in the kitchen because his customer service skills are gone. If it werent for Ryan, my husband and I wouldnt go back.  We usually stop in and have a bucket of wings 1/2 parmesian garlic and 1/2 lemon pepper and they are usually very good. The lemon pepper were so salty that they actually felt like they were burning my tongue. My husband likes a lot of salt and even he said he couldnt eat them. We called the cook over and he was rude.   I was just going to chalk it up and go somewhere else next time but my husband wasnt having it. The cook was rude telling us that \"oh well thats the way lemon pepper is.Sorry\"  We have had the wings here (another cook) and the lemon pepper was very good. My husband likes them for the saltyness. These were ....terrible and uneatable.  Anyway, Ryan intercepted and made everything right. Its not very often, anymore,  where employees treat the customers in a way that they appreciate their business. It seems like employees everywhere have a bad attitude these days.  I hope it gets back to the days where the customer is treated well. And I thank you very much Ryan."}
{"text":"Went to this location my first time service was slow and they wasn't even busy I order a salad and a French dip with fries .. The fries was soggy and the beef looked fake on the sandwich .. It also tasted dry the beer was kinda warm also .. The waitress was kinda to herself not check on us at all but stuff her face behind the bar .. I asked about their sports book app on how to sign up on the Machine but the players card feature was broke .. All and all I will not be returning to this location"}
{"text":"So we show up here to get something to eat it was nine in the morning door was locked no problem will ring the bell the buzzer to get in ring ring ring ring no answer ring ring ring ring no answer so after waiting a few minutes ring ring ring then the bartender comes on the intercom to say you guys will not be getting n ringing the buzzer like that or reply was like what? We've been sitting here for over 5 minutes is what I said she said no you haven't I been watching you guys so the question is why are you watching this instead of allowing us to come in to eat breakfast definitely bad customer service this bartender should be fired"}
{"text":"I generally loathe PT's. They are more/less a disease in this valley, sprouting up everywhere. Yet, this one, largely due to the service, was an adequate watering hole."}
{"text":"I hit up T's for drinks the other night. Was a decent place that had a pretty decent crowd in there. It was good service at the bar and I was able to get drinks with a decent pour quickly. So overall, decent setup."}
{"text":"So appreciative of Tracy Ray - such a help with the transition from work to home, always welcoming, always personable."}
{"text":"Been coming here for almost 8 years. Hands down the only pts I'll go to. Gary, Tony, and Candace have always made me feel at home. Food service is tip top. Overall me and my buddies always have a good time here and if it weren't for the bar and food staff me and friends wouldn't be here."}
{"text":"Low key kind of place. Really good pastrami sandwich with good beer choices. Won $45 on the black jack machine. Pool tables at $5 an hour. Great bartenders. More than you could ask for in a sports bar."}
{"text":"Sarah the bartender is great! Always a great little place to grab a few drinks after work. Grab some nachos or carne asada fries from next door to enjoy with your beer! Half off drinks during happy hour!"}
{"text":"The food was absolutely amazing the service was very quick fast and upbeat I will definitely go back and recommend it to all my friends"}
{"text":"First thing before anything. This place is the cleanest PT's in town. Looks small from outside but huge inside. I only came across it because I decided to take the bus instead of driving. I was waiting for the bus on Desert Inn and took a look around while I waited. I live two blocks away and will definitely be back. Pretty awesome spot. I just need to migrate my coworkers to this Spot because the PT's on Sahara and Paradise went down since the new bartender. This spot would do way better if they had a actual PT's post on Desert Inn. Can't wait to bring my friends here"}
{"text":"I love this place. My friends and I go there once a week. The manager and bartender James is AWESOME, always suggests new drinks and they are great drinks! Food is very good for being bar food and I can even find light options like the chicken wrap or their salad, very yummy! I totally recommend this for a week night, great!"}
{"text":"I just had lunch at this place and was amazed by the $11 burger that was smaller than my index finger in width!!? Wtf!!! They should call it a overpriced slider..  Then the place has horrible ventilation, smells like a old ash tray. Very dull, non attractive environment and the music is horrific!! I would not recommend and based on the 2 1/2 star rating, I'm guessing that I'm not the only one who is less than amused with this place!   The food was good but for the portion it was over priced, my burger was the size of a $1.50 cheeseburger from McDonald's! Definitely quality over quantity, which is fine if the environment of the place didn't suck! The place is dead and once again stinks like an ashtray, this place needs better ventilation and music!!!!  Don't believe, just review my pics of the lackluster view of this place and the mini burger!!!"}
{"text":"I come here with my boyfriend because Dave, the bartender, is awesome!   They have a really good dark beer that I like called 15 something... I forget the other two numbers. But it's really good.   The chicken fingers are delicious too!!   This is a funny location. There's always very interesting people there. Some reviewers said it's too smokey there... I never noticed that and I have asthma. Sometimes it can be a tad obnoxious if you come here when folks are doing karaoke, but the service is still good and so are the drinks and food."}
{"text":"Since Big Dogs on Nellis and Owens went away, we needed a local watering hole.  We found this place a few blocks from the house.  The drinks are cold, the food is tasty and very affordable, and the service is fantastic.  Definitely beats the other places in Sunrise Manor."}
{"text":"I love this place the customers are friendly and so are the bartenders ( Joe, Holly and Kevin) are what makes this bar so fun and interesting!"}
{"text":"had a red neck breakfast here, was so good ! Cost $30 for my lady and I, little expensive but not complaining. Waitress, Christine (?) was so nice and provided excellent service, thank you and keep up the great work! We'll be back, preferable when there are special prices, as we are locals and don't want to spend $30+ each time we go out to eat. Will come back between 6-10am for the 1/2 off breakfast"}
{"text":"Great bar for UNLV sports. Close to the campus and a great happy hour.  Tons of Pool Tables and beer pong."}
{"text":"The wing sauce they call gold fever is amazing.  I highly recommend this sauce.  Ice cold beer  too"}
{"text":"I was pretty drunk here and the bartenders made sure i didnt leave in my truck. they called a ride for me. at the time i was a bit frustrated cus i didnt want to leave my truck there. im very thankful though now because who knows what could of happen to me."}
{"text":"Came looking for a nice place to watch Hockey...and I found it.... Comfy seating...good service...my new go to place"}
{"text":"Good food, cold drinks, good atmosphere. Weekends are fun here, but you can have a fun time here during week aswell."}
{"text":"Well the main reason to go to a bar is koo people and good vibes. This bartender kills the vibe so much I'm literally never coming here again. I thought maybe he just having a bad day but going there 3 times pretty much confirms it. Customer service literally the worst I've seen. Disgusting for this guy to be in the service industry. Not personable at all. Barely does his job because I have to ask him for everything and anything if I sit there I could be there his whole shift and not be served.   Last time we went my brother had a hair in his food and had to wait a very long time to even tell the guy because he never checked up on us after we got the food. I finished my food and still 5-8 mins after my brother had to flag him down and tell him about the hair. My brother said he understood and things happen but he gave my brother an attitude asking \"so what do you want?! You want another one or you want me to take it off!?\" First of all why this guy getting mad at my brother like if he put the hair in there or something. My brother just wanted one without a hair like it should be. So they made another one for him with no discounts and we paid the bill and tipped more then 20%. But I'm never going there again and now you know also."}
{"text":"They get a big fat Zero review, this establishment chooses disrespectful jerks over Veterans, not a good look.  A Veteran Marine was asked to leave when he stood up for himself and all other Veterans.... It made me rate it, I would never even give them 1 star Jodie"}
{"text":"I came to this pts once because a friend recommended it, and I had such a good time I've not been to a different pts since. The bartenders are all awesome, to the extent that even if I come in here alone I'll have a good time. Adam always makes me feel welcome, and Eddie makes me a new unique drink whenever my normal orders are getting stale. I would 100% call this my favorite bar I've drank at in town. I wish I could give this place higher than a 5/5."}
{"text":"Pt's on E Saharah has the worst burgers, compared to the cheapest fast food burger.   Lost 200, had a lousy burger  and she wanted to charge me for a drink."}
{"text":"History has been made in this pub... In my work's shopping complex (that's dangerous,lol), we have seen the news here, handfuls of rounds bought by the bartender when -name your team wins- I aint a fan of football so whatever. I'll take the free drink anyday though! We've seen managers on their way to bigger and better things, co-workers send off to other stores, and happy birthdays. Really we go there all to often to blow off steam. They know what we drink! Wolf has been there for years,though I havn't seen him in a while.. Which reminds me I'm due to stop in.  It's mainly a sports bar with a different sport, seemingly on every tv, and the place seriously lights up when whomever wins. Bathrooms are nice for bar bathrooms. the bar itself appears unfinished, and has for the 9+ years I've been at my pedestrian job. gives it its charm, I suppose."}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time Ben & Jen where the best !!! New waitress Angel is always in a bad mood she's rude and it seems as she needs a new job, she shouldn't be around people if she doesn't enjoy what she does,  I seen people waiting for over 20 minutes for her to come to the table wile she just walk around behind the bar, where has the service gone in this place?"}
{"text":"Walked in and waited 35 min and bartender \"Brad\" saw us and never even acknowledged us or for that matter took an order. Place smelled like vomit and music sucks. Needless to say me and or group of 5 just left. Not worth it."}
{"text":"I love this PT's. The bartenders, especially Shannon, always make me (and everyone else) feel welcome, and the drinks are always good. I just wish I could win at Keno every time I'm there, but that's a totally separate issue!"}
{"text":"Used to love this place. I used to stop here at least 4-5 days a week and dump 50-200 in the machines daily.  The manager Shannon has a bad attitude, and she goes thru bar tenders and Asst mgrs all the time as no one can stand her!! I have heard it for the last 3 yrs. I finally gave up when even being a regular that spends a lot, it takes 20 mins to get a drink. And even if your playing Shannon has told the bartenders only one drink for every $100 you play. That's not company policy but hers. She had lost me and many others business as she is just outright rude. We tried B.A.R. (Born and raised) down the street and it it our new hangout.  Drinks within 2-3 mins of sitting and a new drink brought before you even finish your old one. PT's corporate needs to really look at this location and the management!!!!"}
{"text":"Sometimes PTs can have a revolving door of bartenders. I hope they keep Serafina. She's been here two visits in a row (and is one of the friendliest bartenders they've had here - Larry is great too). And I think she digs me (but probably not)."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, cold beer and decent food.  I loved the buffalo wings but was disappointed by the garlic parmesean wings.  Would definitely go back.  Plenty of seating!"}
{"text":"Dale is amazing, I come in and he always remembers my drink even if I miss a few weeks. I  usually come in here late at night when I'm hungry and I always order the potstickers, and I'm Asian and I used to make my own so I'm very picky. I live very close to Chinatown but I will come here after work for potstickers and they are always good. Happy Hour is the best we order 9$ pizzas and they never fail."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been going to the Sahara & Nellis location for years. Always good food, drink, and staff. This recently changed. See about two weeks ago PT's corporate apparently decided that the patrons who come in to eat and drink really don't matter that much. They have cut the food menu by more than half. They no longer have club sandwiches, no chicken fingers, no italian pizza, etc. The PT's food czars have spoken and the public apparently don't matter. Let's only serve the best sellers, not offer a large variety of items to choose from. Still love the staff and bar selection, just don't agree with cutting the food menu to the bare bones. Might have to start looking for another place to eat, drink, and gamble. Rewards customer No. 331502."}
{"text":"The bartender was great! The food service was horrible. We went for breakfast. The place was fairly empty, we were the only table and there were 5 or 6 people playing machines at the bar, and it took over 30mins for 2 omelettes. The server dropped the creamer containers on the carpeted floor and just scooped them up and have them to us. I like PT's but would not go back to this one."}
{"text":"I had an hour between classes and wanted a quick lunch. I've been to other PT's and thought it might be a good choice. Ambiance: walking in from a bright sunny afternoon sky, it takes a few seconds to accommodate because it is very dark inside. The room is pretty much divided into three sections. You walk into the bar area. Then there is a relatively small area with tables for the eating. And then there is a third section with 8 pool tables. But overall, it was pretty depressing, in part because it was so dark. And in part because it was so empty ( other than me, there were only three people shooting pool in the entire place). Plus, while I was eating someone came in and while sitting at the bar lit up a cigarette. With no real separation between the bar area and the dining area, the smoke drifted over. Yuck!! Service: my server was at the table almost immediately after sitting down. She gave me the specials menu and the full menu. She brought my drink almost immediately. And a different person brought out my food. My server came back a couple of times during the meal to make sure that I didn't need anything else. Overall service was good. Food: I had the barbecue chicken salad. My biggest surprise was that the presentation was excellent (see the photo). And the salad was actually quite tasty. Unfortunately, one third of the plate was chips , which was not mentioned on the menu and I had no interest in. Were I to come back for lunch, I would order it without the chips. Value: Overall, four-star food and service was dragged down by 1 star ambiance. I would not come back here for lunch."}
{"text":"God this place is ran by idiots. I've been coming here sometime now and the waitress has always been a little ditzy and not that great at her job but tolerable. A few days ago she was particularly more incompetent than usual.   I was in a table with four if my friends of whom I was train to introduce to this bar. She took the beer order of a guy next to us, then brought his beer later and took the food order, then brought the sandwich and never once did she ask us if we we needed a beer or food for that matter. As she was walking away I got her attention with an \"Excuse us\" as she did a slow 180 while rolling her eyes. We asked for our beers and a food menu.  Now she has seen me several times but asked for all of our IDs including mine. I have her my voided drivers license which can now only be used as an ID, the real one is in the mail. She said she could not take it that I need the drivers license paper. I argue against so she involves her manager which today confirmed is just as inept. He says I need that paper. I let him know that this was not an issue the previous day when their internet was down and could not take credit cards. He said he'd make the exception this once because what else could he do. I assure him that just because I did not have the paper to rest assured that my age has not reduced since they stamped it VOID. We drank one beer and when she never returned for our food order we got our check and left.  Today I come in and this time I leave my ID in the car and ask to be served. He asks for the paper and provide it to him and point out where it says that it isn't a valid form of ID. So I ask him if this is just valid for driving why do you need it? \"That's just the way it is\" he replies. So after reading that he asks for my license and I let him know that it's not on me. He replies that he can't serve me then. At this point it was obvious he had an agenda and too dumb to admit he was in error and provide customer service. We left and I won't return now. Too many bars in this town to deal with idiots.  I'd stay away."}
{"text":"Dave the bartender is the man. Great guy. Great service. Food is decent and they have a great happy hour."}
{"text":"I always have late cravings, and was reccomended to go here for the food! Have to say best wings, great flavor!!! Always come nack for the food!"}
{"text":"One of the only PTs where I experienced poor service with no attempt at recovery.  My friend and I stated when we first sat down that we were on a bit of a tight schedule and immediately ordered beers and a pizza. The pizza took 40 minutes. There were 4 other couples in the bar.  The cook brought out plates and a bar buddy 10 minutes after the order. We got excited. 15 more minutes later, we asked the bartender where the food was and he BSed his way through an explanation, then attempted to bring us more plates as a sign that the food was coming.  Kinda crappy. 40 minutes for a PTs pizza :( Don't expect much here."}
{"text":"The bartender here I asked for the check he still hasn't brought it. When I asked him for an ipa and asked him for his recommendation he gave me one and said go with that choice cus it doesn't taste like burnt popcorn. Ummm sorry old timer IPA is what the young people drink. Hater. And I asked him where he was from before this rude comment he made he ignored me. Also when I asked for my change at the end he ignored me said nothing and took a long time to go get it."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite bars. The decor is dated, its dark and smokey but I keep comin back. The bartenders rock (Andi and Steph) and are always nice. These reviews talking about having food ... that is NOT this PTs. This location does not have a kitchen. However it has delicious mexican food next door for cheap. They have pool, karaoke(once a month now) plenty of poker machines and some cuties come in. Def recommend."}
{"text":"Decent daily HH, but food quality was lower and prices higher than expected. Service was dismal at best. Convenient to my 'hood but can't see myself returning, not sure how they have so many locations unless this was out of the norm for them.  One waitress for whole place, but only three tables. Still barely saw her and had a mistake on our order. It was fixed and she was polite but not particularly attentive. When not serving she was seated at the bar watching a screen and drinking from a mug, maybe she wasn't feeling well.  Menu describes wings using the word \"giant\" but I found them quite small- one in the bucket was literally the size of my car key. Medium buffalo sauce was spot-on, regular and curly fries are both tasty. Standard bar fare, really. Website menu lists a November special of soup and sandwich, but those specials were nowhere to be seen on in-store materials. Luckily they still had it, because the potato soup is actually really, really good!"}
{"text":"They shortened the happy hours at these bars, so happy hour is actually almost an actual hour now. More corporate greed at work. They did have a few beer specials, like 5 buck tall bud lights,  so that made it workable. Ordered the bikini wrap which was pretty good for a wrap. White chicken, avocado, lettuce, tomatoes and onions. Choice of wrap like spinach would have been nice. The fresh Cole slaw almost stole the show...The cook must have cut it up after I ordered. Best slaw in awhile. Good switch from fries. Not a bad location. Good living room area which I had all to my lonesome watching game."}
{"text":"I really like this place! Bartenders work hard to cover the floor during happy hours and still manage to be attentive. Even the ding ding ding of the cashouts are handled expediently. Good tap array with Langunitas IPA in the big mug. Refreshing!  It's nice to come relax here and watch baseball in the lounge. Watched the nba finals too. Solid TV coverage. The artwork of women in full desert rock regalia just amazes me. Love it here."}
{"text":"I've been to a PT's or two in my day. The set up of the space just isn't good. That pony wall splitting the pool tables and the couch makes no sense. Then there is no way to see the TV's by the bar unless you're at the bar counter making all the other tables useless. Service was ok. Food is ok. Drinks are good. PTs are solid 3-4 * bars. But this location is my least favorite of the PT's I've been to."}
{"text":"I come to this PT's often. Mostly for happy hour either early (5-7p) or late (12a-2a).  Happy hours drinks are all 50% off!  All the bartenders are great Laura, Roger, Troy and Angel all do a great job. Laura has an infectious laugh that will instantly put you in a good mood!  While not exactly my type Roger and Troy are both good dudes and great bartenders. Laura and Angel both have larger than life \"personalities\".   All in all a fun place for adult beverage or ten."}
{"text":"Went here with 2 others after work. We are all casino workers, played for about an hour, all ate dinner, and had 5 drinks amongst us. The check came and the bartender did not comp us one drink. Never have I been to a PTs and not gotten my drinks comped. The receipt says Loreta. That may be the bartenders name. Had she introduced herself or been even remotely social we would have known. Never going back there after that. Super disappointed, both in the service and the fact that I personally spent over $40 playing and didn't get a $5.00 drink comp. seriously PTs, what have you become?!"}
{"text":"Kevin, joe and Jeff are the whole reason I keep coming here!! They're awesome, and always have positive attitudes and provide a fun atmosphere!!"}
{"text":"I was informed by the bartender that $20 in a machine equals I free drink. $60 later I was compted 1 free drink. It's your choice but I would go somewhere else. Even chain bars offer better than that."}
{"text":"It is what it is. There are better and worse In The area. Fortunately, there are many options within a 2 mile radius."}
{"text":"The PT's bar here is great! The staff is really fun and the vibe is very relaxed! But there are better, and need to work better on sanitation! Good thing is there great locations and ope 24/7"}
{"text":"I don't go to PT's very often but when I do, it's this location. I've had some fun nights here for sure. This is probably one of the nicer locations. It's pretty spacious and never that busy when I go which is awesome for me. I work in the nightlife industry and I would rather avoid packed bars full of belligerents lol. I'm giving them a fourth star because they serve Stone IPA. Most typical bars don't serve beer that I like so being able to get some pitchers of Stone is a plus."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar with a few friends . While they all ordered alcohol beverages .. I order a Shirley temple ... Witch is Sprite with some syrup .. I shouldn't even be drinking soda . Well bottom line the bartender got the drinks mixed up and I ended up taking a extreme sip of alcohol .. I was beyond pissed off I got up and walk out before I even order my food and left in tears . I'm 34weeks pregnant  and I'm praying that I don't get my child taken away over another persons mistakes . I'm never going here again"}
{"text":"This is one of those PT's stuck in the middle of a strip mall. It looks divey and sketchy from the outside. Inside, it is definitely a more rundown PT's, but otherwise isn't much different from every other PT's. And the karaoke set-up here is just odd - there's just really not enough room for it. The whole thing just feels awkward. When it comes down to it, though, I'd much rather hang at a different PT's."}
{"text":"I like the location. It's close to my home. Happy hour is a plus. Usually hang out for a few hours order a half off pizza and we are out of there under 40.00.  Pool table is 5.00 for an hour. Food is tasty, but some items are pre made and reheated. . I would like to state that there is a serious lack of personality from the male bartender.  Un friendly and sometimes rude."}
{"text":"I always say that PT's are Vegas's equivalent of Starbucks on the East Coast - there's one on every corner. This is an older PT's, but it's very nice and clean. The bartenders are friendly and attentive. I like this location as it has a cozy, neighborhood bar feel. And it's never crowded. Otherwise, yeah, it's your standard PT's. It's not all that much different from the one down the block or the other one up the block."}
{"text":"We've been to this location a number of times.  They serve cheap beer and offer bar games, such as pool, darts, & golden tee. If you're looking for something more than a divey bar feel, look elsewhere.   They have a full menu. It's okay food if you're looking to fill your belly while you drink your beer, but I wouldn't call it a destination restaurant. We've had the sliders, chili, man n cheese bites, & wings: they were all middle of the line. I wasn't a fan of the pizza there, so definitely wouldn't recommend.   To order, you'll have to see the bartender. Go find a place at the bar, place your food order and someone will bring it to you at your table.   Overall, if you're looking for a drink and some video gambling games or bar games this place will fill your needs. Don't come in expecting to find a place with spectacular service or spectacular food."}
{"text":"Wow! I cannot express enough how comfortable I am here. I feel like I am at a family get together, and, having none, this is my family! The service is exceptional, the food is made from the heart and the drinks are perfection in a glass. I genuinely appreciate the experiences I have here, thanks to people like Ashley Sasaki and James, who not only do an amazing job at what they do, but also care about my wellbeing and take the time to care. Go to this PTs if you want to feel amazing, comfortable and at home!"}
{"text":"It's yet another PT's. And it's one of those PT's that is in a strip mall. Inside, it's like most every other PT's - shocking, I know.   The bar area is large. There are only a couple of bar tops off to one side of the bar - and it is usually way too crowded to even want to sit at one of them, as people will be constantly bumping into you. But it is nice that the bar are is so large, making it easier to snag a bar stool and play some video poker.  Down front is a slightly lower level with several couches and assorted games. This is the area where the karaoke happens. It's actually one of the better PT's for karaoke, as the space / area is large and open - much more accommodating for karaoke."}
{"text":"Service is always super slow If you're not gambling, u have to sit in the back corner TOTAL ASHTRAY no matter how few people are smoking Two stars are for their great Cajun wings"}
{"text":"I'd never been to this location until Wolfie started working here. Was there on his first night and continue to come back frequently.   The difference between then and now is like night and day. The place is lively, the staff is friendly, customer service is light years from what it used to be and the crowd is a nice mix of all kinds of people just out to relax and have some fun.   You almost forget you're at a PT's and feel like you're just at great neighborhood bar. As a company they really need to take a few pages out of his playbook because he obviously has a formula that works. Good management and actual customer service. Who knew?   One of the few PT's locations that I highly recommend. Even if it's your first time and you don't know anyone, it's an atmosphere that makes everyone feel welcome."}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of PT's pubs over the years with mixed reviews. Actually there's a few that I've only been in once and will never go back.   I used to frequent this location quite a bit years ago when Tommy and Chuck worked it, and haven't been back since they left.   However, \"Yeah, Yeah!\", Wolfie's in the house. Love what he's done with the joint. It's a nice crowd. The place looks great.  Very comfortable.   He's a true professional, personable bartender. A dying breed in Las Vegas. Good conversation when it's not too busy, laughs, and don't get him started on the Bruins and Red Socks (I'm a Red Wings and Tigers fan so we got that going).   And it's not just him, the entire staff is dialed in. Everyone makes you feel welcomed and comfortable. Like they actually enjoy working there and you being there. Not like they are just waiting around for your tip.   I may have never come into this location ever again, even though it is close to the house. But now, it's on the top of my favorites list.   If you liked him at Rainbow, you'll love him at Flamingo!"}
{"text":"Meh. I'm a 20+ year Vegas resident and have always known this location existed, but have only been here 3 times in the last year. One Sunday for football, a swing, and a grave. With the exception of the Sunday day shift bartender, each time I walk out feeling that I just wasted time and money that I wish I had spent elsewhere.   I couldn't tell you what color the walls are in this place, but it always feels dark and dingy. Even during the day. The staff is no different ..seems like they're just going through the motions waiting for quitting time. The clientele reflects the same. As if people are just there out of convenience.  Having been to various PT\"s over the years, (with very few exceptions) most times if you don't personally know the bartender the service sucks and people who work there seem to be hired for every other reason other than their knowledge, abilities and customer service skills.  Good bartenders get moved to shifts where there are no customers, or leave altogether, and bad bartenders get rewarded with busy shifts seemingly just for sticking it out, being under 35, or having tits.  PT's marketing seems to pretty much amounts to a  concentrated strategy of \"Put one on every corner and then put all of the pressure on the min wage bartenders (who by trade are not marketers) to magically make something happen\".   With the exception of a handful of locations and employees,  the company has become a boring, cookie cutter, stale reflection of what it thinks Vegas used to be, and is completely out of touch with what Vegas is and the markets and neighborhoods that they serve. It's main goal seems to be amassing real estate, not actually innovating  or customer service.   How do you know you're not at a PT's? You get a beverage napkin under your drink, and the bartender actually checks on you from time to time even if you aren't gambling.   In 2016 when anyone can pull the world up on their cell phones, it's strange to put money into an \"internet\" jukebox and find \"certain\" music blocked. I've been to a lot of bars in many states and Pt's jukeboxes are the only censored internet devices (for grown ups) that I have ever seen. Even Rick James?! C'mon!   Why even bother having a jukebox? Just play satellite radio and leave it at that. I understand that certain gamers may not want to hear Dr. Dre' or Wu-Tang 24/7, but in it's attempt to cater to one specific kind of customer from the 1950's (a shrinking demographic that has almost completely disappeared), PT's as a group has become just blah, outdated, and isn't any thing to anybody. But that may be just a symptom of what Vegas bars as a whole have become and no one seems to be willing to break the mold and move forward.   Nothing reflects that old mentality more than it's insistence on playing Fox News on it's TV's.You think of your local tavern as the place to get away from it all and relax, and yet every PT's you walk into makes it a point to let you know their political views. Everyone in the free world knows what Fox News is. It's not a secret.   Maybe it's a not so subtle message to let you know who their target market is and that no one else is welcome. I don't know. it's just strange that they go out of their way to make sure it's always playing,   I have an idea, since you profess to be a sports bar how about just playing all sports? You know..the thing that I don't normally get at home, or on my phone. I don't need to go to the bar to see Fox News. I go to the bar to get away from things like Fox News.  Overall if you think of PT's for what it used to be back in the day, and expect that level of excitement and customer service, you'll be severely disappointed in what the majority of PT's have become today. Yes they have a lot of locations, most of which they seem to be just dragging along behind them. And yes I'm sure as a corporation they're making money at the moment. However if I didn't know a few people who still worked for this company, I would easily pass it by like a tasteless piece of dried tofu on the side of the road. Options in this town are plentiful. You don't have to put forth much effort to get something different from the same old stale bar with apathetic service.   I had once hoped that the new corporate PT's with all of their various names (Gold.Tavern. Pub. Place.and so on...)  would raise the bar in this town, but the reality is that they've actually lowered it while simultaneously saturating the market with total suck. And it seems like everyone realizes it except the people in the corporate office.  Is it just PT's? That would probably be unfair to say. The Vegas bar scene as a whole is stale and boring, and none of the main players are leading to improve it."}
{"text":"I come here often with my husband to watch football games, and yes, they will put on any game you want. The only drawback is when a big group comes in and start playing their crummy music on the jukebox: you can't hear what's going on and have to resort to lipreading the announcers on the T.V.  They have a great happy hour and decent beers on tap that rotate seasonally.   James is pretty much the only reason why I go because he is probably the best bartender in town. By the best, I don't mean that he juggles bottles and stuff like that. I mean that he is attentive, mellow, kind, laid back, pretty much everything you would want in a boyfriend.   The crowd is a mixed bag, and sort of shifty at times. It is located downtown, after all. But then there are normal people that stop in for drinks, to play video poker, etc.  I've never felt unsafe there, and the staff is good at chasing out the riff-raff."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I go to a lot of Pt's & I felt like I was at home as soon as I stepped in, the waitress is so friendly, made my mom and I feel so comfortable and had us laughing in minutes. Her name is sharon and she is the main reason why I would come back."}
{"text":"We just to come over to dine and the happy hour cause the pizza was half off. It wasn't amazing but the happy hour on drinks and pizza sound great. We are not great gamblers but last time we went we tried to sit on the bar. And we were not allowed to sit because we were not sure about gambling. The place was empty and when we were about to order they told us pizza was not half price anymore. I don't think we are going to pts for a long time. Cause there is plenty of new local bars that offer outstanding food for the same price."}
{"text":"four stars because they won't let you order just flat wings  Rick ross said wing stop was the place to eat- wings---Wrong it's Pt's  This is a place that me and many of my co-workers go after work or after a late night party  Singing they thinking filet mignon, I'm thinking PT's Lemon pepper(jk)  Lemon pepper wings are the bomb baby"}
{"text":"Wait for my food more than 30 mts. Men's restroom be careful if you want to use the toilet door doesn't work.  I give this place 2 stars.  But you get what you pay ford.  Right.   Don't order chicken fingers. They're $24.00   That's bullshit. $$$$$"}
{"text":"It's been almost 20 mts that I ordered my food and I am still waiting. It's something simple and the lace is small."}
{"text":"It's just a normal bar. The drinks were just a little lite on the happy mixer. The bartender was very laid back almost looking blazed......lol"}
{"text":"-very smoky, not recommended if you don't like cigarettes -over priced drinks  -mediocre food -inattentive service   in a city like las vegas there are much better options than this place."}
{"text":"This place is awesome Saturday night kareoke is fun and happy hour special from midnight til 3am food and drink can't beat that great place"}
{"text":"The Happy Hour beer prices are great. Chicken wings are always very good and variety as well. Bartenders Ashley and Courtney always provide excellent friendly service."}
{"text":"First time going there and as soon as i get to the bar right away the bartender (older male) is really rude. Not a good first time impression. The beer's are warm and the limes look like they are days old. But the main reason why i would not go back it is because of the bartenders service. Then as soon as i was leaving and about to pay that same bartender was waiting for an other customer to pay but that customer was taking a bit longer because he couldn't find his credit card in his wallet, well that same bartender was so mad he kept shaking his head and looked furious. kept moving his posture. Not a good place to be."}
{"text":"Place is a little dated, but definitely a good place to have a drink, play some pool or just meet up with friends. Doesn't look like much on the outside, but I was surprised it was larger than I thought on the inside. May be my husband and my new place Monday nights."}
{"text":"Me and my boy went here while waiting for his flight and watched the Warriors game. The reason I'm giving this review is mainly due to how good the wings and French fries were!! They were off the hook! We couldn't believe it, we even heard ppl around us talking about how good their wings and fries were!   Other than the food is was a normal PTs. Not as nice as the new ones of course but they could definitely benefit from from some bigger TVs"}
{"text":"riends and I love to go here for cheap drinks and awesome pizza! Happy hour. Scoree!"}
{"text":"I called to place an order of chicken wings and after holding for 12 mins and listening to the back round conversations she was having, Holly hung up on me.... Trash!"}
{"text":"I woke up in the middle of the night aroudn 1:30 a.m. hungry. Yeah, I said it, I woke up hungry!  Happy Hour is from midnight to 2 a.m. It used to be until 3 a.m. Since I only had 30 mintues left, this one was the closest to my house. Got there, it was kinda packed but not smoky like other PT's.   Sat down, Chris the bartender was by himself. Poor guy. But he was pretty attentive and knows what's going on in his bar. Got a black velvet and oh man, too much cider not enough guinness. Ok, so I said I was hungry but the first thign I got a was a beer. Haha. I ordered the Gilroy pizza which is a thin crust pizza with Italian sausage, pepperoni, mushrooms and dices tomatoes.   Delish! But I could only handle 2 slices, cause I was already full from my Black Velvet.  I'd come back here if I wake up again in the middle of the night....hungry. Haha."}
{"text":"We went in for lunch and sat at a table. There were 4 other people in the place, all at the bar. It took 10 minutes for someone to come over to take a drink order, she came back with our order pretty quick and asked if we were ready to order food. I asked for a menu and said we would need a few minutes. 45 minutes later a woman in her PT'S  uniform shirt came out of the kitchen and was saying goodbye to her coworkers! I stopped her and asked if she could just ask someone to come and take our order. This young woman did that herself, she took our order and was super nice about it. Then she was leaving so I stopped her again to say thanks and gave her a $5 tip. Then it was another 35 minute wait for a hamburger  and some wings. We never did get to reorder our drinks.  We were done with our meal and just wanted to pay and leave.The bartender was flirting with a guy at the other end of the bar and after waiting 10 more minutes, I stood up by the table (which, by the way, was the closest one to the bar) hoping she would turn around so I could get the check. No such luck. Finally someone came in the door so she turned around, and saw me! She brought our check and said sorry for the wait. I paid, left NO tip, and promised my self never to return. You see, this is not the first time we've had to wait for an unusually long time, nor the second. This has been a constant problem for the last year. With the change in the menu and a total  lack of customer service, we will not be back. I had hoped that when they removed the wall and door between the \"restaurant area\" and the bar that the long wait times would dissappear.  No, they did not. I believe this is a management problem and ignorance on the part of the employee."}
{"text":"Girls nite out once again at our favorite PT's! Angel always makes sure we have everything we need, she's the best!  It's great knowing that we will get consistently good service with a smile and a great attitude from Angel! Beer is cold and pizza is hot, what more do we need?"}
{"text":"Oh em gee.  The bartender Ashley just did the Heimlich maneuver on me when I choked on a tater tot.  She SAVED MY LIFE.  THUMBS UP!!!"}
{"text":"This PTs is terrible, not sure how the franchise allows it. Bathrooms are positively gross, service is slow and I feel like I'm hassling the bartender every time I ask for something. Nice pool table section, but apparently it's not heated over the winter- I'm pretty sure it's warmer outside.  I watched lots of patrons getting mad because the jukebox was playing during football...   If I wanted to visit the 'hood PTs I would have cruised down to Arville!  And edit: you can't call an order of French fries a 'skillet' just because you serve it in a frying pan. Lame"}
{"text":"Walked in and sat at a table. 2 bartenders behind bar and neither could be bothered to actually walk to the table to get an order for drinks and food.  After about 5 mins and a loooooong stare at the bar, we were informed they don't have any servers and we would have to come to the bar to place our order. Horrible customer service for a bar that had less than 10 patrons at the time. The food was ok, but nothing to write home about. We hadn't been in a PT'S in a few years and had hoped they had improved..... this is clearly not the case! PT'S is officially off our list!"}
{"text":"This ia probably the worst PTsPub i have been to. The bar is great, the location is not a problem, but the service and food was pretty bad.  I was here for thurs football and my server was more interested in eating his chips and using his phone. Guy kep calling me \"dude\"/like we go way back. I am not your bro, you are at your job, be somewhat professional. The lady bartender was not any better i never saw her smile at anyone but at least she was not my server. Oh and i asked the bartender for extra crispg, well done wings but instead my sliders were burnt and the wings were not crispy.  It was not a busy night the bartenders were busy with their social media and the cook was walking around making his rounds. Skip it!"}
{"text":"Complimentary bathrooms! Free water! What more can u ask for???    Always fast service! Great happy hour and they play the games you want to see! Its very lively and the bar staff is excellent!   They dont serve food like other PTs but they let u bring in food from next door....Don Tortaco!   Pool tables, juke box and fast women always available..."}
{"text":"I came here help fellow yelper and roommate Roy celebrate his birthday party with his coworkers, hockey family and more hockey family. Unfortunately of all days too pick he choose bite of las vegas going on across the street. It throws this review into loop of sorts. Talk about business being prepared the whole mini shopping mall with mostly restaurants had tow trucks on speed dial if your not going into any one of the establishments. NO JOKE. If they see you walking across the street they might give you warning but more then not going too get towed. I seen at hanging out the bar for hours one lady complaining.  Like putting players card in machine justify that your playing or even at the bar. So if anything that stands out rather then just like most other PTs have been too around town. On bite of las vegas this is one place that takes their customers seriously. I admit enjoyed seeing business take care of its customers.   The bar like mention its like most others PTs nothing much special although it was my first time at this particular location. I like the fact that they had two separate areas on one side with divider of sorts plants that had three pool tables and then other side lounge type set up with three wide scree televisions all with sports on. The bar is decent size (big rectangle) with lots of machines too play, and television all up at the bar area. We had great service. It wound up being small crowd but notice everyone was getting their drinks and birthday shots ordered got were all tasty.   I like the way bar set up if get group of friends together for drinks. It has almost three separate area that can mingle with friends. The prices are always reasonable at any PTs especially comes too HH. The player card is nice that your get credit for your food orders too and universal card can use at any PTs."}
{"text":"PT's is my go-to neighborhood bar to watch a game, play some video poker, and have a few drinks. It's almost always empty, so you don't have to fight to get a drink and the bartenders are very attentive. No frills, just a cool dive bar with clean toilets."}
{"text":"My gf and i used to frequent this place about 2-3 times a week when they offered 50% off all drinks and pizza for their Happy Hour.  Today, we returned for the football game and was shocked by the new price structure for their food and drinks.  I ordered the 25oz Blue Moon and cost me $8 dollars but it to used be about $4 dollars back then.  Their pizzas are now $25 before the discount.  It's safe to say, we won't be returning to any PTs any time soon.  The service was good but food and drink prices are not worth it.  I can find better deals elsewhere."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good food! This place started out as a place we'd go for Happy Hour because it was near by. Now we go there just to eat, and we have even ordered their pizza TO GO!  It's not just a bar/pub, their kitchen definitely exceeds expectations, check it out!"}
{"text":"Not the best PT'S experience. Service was slow for us as a non-bar patron; our favorite Pizza, the Gilroy, had a crust which the center was raw on, and we had to request our own plates and silverware from the bar.    Everything was made ok, but we'll probably stick with the one on Town Center."}
{"text":"Located in the corner of a strip mall right across the UNLV campus. There's probably a lot of UNLV students that comes here since the dorms are right across the street.  Stopped by before the MWC semi-finals. There was a lot of UNLV fans getting their prefunk on, some New Mexico, San Diego St, and not a lot of Colorado St fans but everyone all representing. It was busy but they did an good job handling all the craziness.  Typical neighborhood bar but a little older and maybe need a little touching up. There's the typical bar entertainment tvs, video games, darts, billiard tables, etc . Full bar and great friendly environment.  Parking kind of sucks because the lanes right in front are one way and tight confusing when the lot is packed and people are  driving in the wrong lanes. Also it shares the lot with other businesses which were equally busy."}
{"text":"Mine and my boyfriends hotspot! Come here late night after work often, staff is nice, the place is clean, and we play pool."}
{"text":"I went there with a friend he had an international driver license and he's 26 years old, the manger over there a girl name Tania was so rude to us and basically kick us out becuz a valid international driver license that can b use for driving in the us plus entering to all the high end clubs in town isn't enough for her and she just having a bad day or something and humiliating there guest when the place is empty. I would never go there again. Thx a lot for the attitude Tania."}
{"text":"I visited this place for drinks and dinner with my friends after work. The service was ok, the drinks reasonably priced but the food was mediocre. I ordered a burger, medium cooked but it was very dry and over cooked for my taste. I guess somebody wouldn't expect to have a good meal and this kind of local bars but you can always improve the kitchen on the basics."}
{"text":"Sometimes I forget that this PT's is here especially since the Marie Callender's that shared the same parking lot closed down a while back, I don't venture in the area anymore.  With all PT's they have their 50% off Happy Hour for drinks and pizza which run from 5pm-7pm and 12am-2am.  It's next to liquor store and massage places.  I decided to write a review because I thought the bartender was awesome.  She showed us what was under her top...just her tats.  She's cool not gonna say her name but she already knows she's cool. She even hooked us up with a pitcher.  She was very friendly and always came by to talk and check on us while tending to the other people there.  She is also a lot smarter than the guy bartender at the PT's I usually have no choice of going because she knows how to redeem my free beer with Yelp check-in and knows you don't need a printer to redeem.  I ended up not even using the check-in offer.  This PT's was clean like most other PT's I've been to.  It had a pretty chill environment with shuffleboards and billiard tables.  Plenty of TV around so you don't miss any of action.  I liked the movie posters that were scattered around the bar.  I spent some time looking at them cause I love movies.  I finally tried the pizza.  They weren't that bad just difference more like pizzas you'd get from the groceries store."}
{"text":"This is definitely my all time favorite bar. This is the after work hangout for all of my friends and I. It's got the best bartenders, the best drinks, cheap prices, and good times all around. They've even got clean bathrooms, complimentary water and soda. And, if you've got the Touch tunes app you can play music on the jukebox. Can't forget Karaoke night on Saturdays starting at 10 PM. Plus, you've got don tortaco next door, so you can get drunk, pop in for some Mexican food, came back in, eat, and then drink some more. What more could you want? Also, it's really sad when people want to post incorrect reviews and lie because they drank too much and got mad their tab was too high. Shout out to my favorite bartenders Andie, Stephanie, the gorgeous Tony, and Tony with the good butt!"}
{"text":"We came here after celebrating at Olive next door for a friend's birthday.  Came to continue the celebration since they closed early.  This place is a joke.  It's a Thursday night and not only did it take us 20 minutes to get acknowledged at the bar but the male bartender (brown hair with a blue long sleeve shirt)..but after ordering, no name was taken and we had to ask repeatedly for the drinks we ordered. Finally when food came one of the guys yelled across the dining room and threw one of our food orders down and said \"I don't know who ordered this, Noone did but I said I'd find you\" and threw it down. We had to go to the bar and inquire about our order and we were met with very rude service after being ignored. I asked the food delivery guy (same one who was rude to us when dropping off the first order) about our missing order and his response was \"I don't know but what about the sandwich in my hands\" and we do not work here or know what goes where. As I am writing this, we are still waiting on our food. I am very disappointed. I love the PTS by our home and will now probably not return to any."}
{"text":"dude this place is what it is a BAR nothing more nothing less, the bar tender looked like he was having a hard time kepping track of all the customers since it was just him but he kept apologizing and acknoliging us every time he passed us. the hubbie and i ordored an order  of wings uh hit the spot we  were buzzn so it was perfect  timing we stayed until 4 am just drinkin and playing some slots here and there i had fun!!! we live down the st so this place is perfect no DUI  for us and left happy. service is good and people are nice the thing about the tranny is deff true!!! i love em power to u girlfriends yall do ur thing in heels or in 80's clothes OK."}
{"text":"The bald bartender at night whose name I can not remember is AWESOME!! The one with the stupid faux hawk looking hair do is useless. I set at the bar to play and he didn't say anything. So screw that guy. But everyone else is great"}
{"text":"This is the worst pts I have came to they have the worst customer service and I wouldn't recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"first time at this location, and it smelled really bad when I came in. I'm not sure what it was. bartender wasn't too attentive but nice. then we finally order. we got one pizza and chilli fries. we had to wait a while. then bartender says the pizza didn't come out right. so we wait for the next one no problem. eventually 45 minutes have passed. and my friend never received her chilli fries. and the 2nd pizza stuck to the oven. at that point we gave up."}
{"text":"One of the better Pts I go to. Oliver is  a good bartender and is on point when it comes to keeping your glass full.  Wish they had their own food and didnt have to go next door though. Also pissed I cant bet sports here anymore but not there fault."}
{"text":"I have never been treated so badly at a restaurant/bar I literally walked in the door and the second I walked in the door a the bartender told me you cannot gamble or drinks here and I said I did not ask for a drink all I do is want to gamble a little bit and you said I do not care you do not belong in this area let alone this was the first bar I went to when I was 21 years old and now that they have new management or just rude employees I will never go back there again"}
{"text":"New blonde day time (M-W) bartender doesn't take care of regulars.  All of the other bartenders are awesome!"}
{"text":"Nice place. Bartender was not really nice to us. Good energy good music. Not sure if I will stop there again ."}
{"text":"Great bar, great atmosphere, great staff!  By far my favorite PT's location in town.  They have 3-4 pool tables, darts, and a golden tee machine.  Also an internet jukebox where they won't skip your music if you put on a little death metal (I HATE bars that skip songs- why have a jukebox in the first place??).  I was there on a Saturday night, when they have karaoke weekly at 10pm.  We had an awesome time!  There's a HUGE seating area down front with plenty of room for the karaoke singers to do their thing.  Also, unlike many karaoke bars, it was VERY upbeat.  Most karaoke places just go through the list of singers all night, with silence in between karaoke songs while waiting for the next guy to get up.  Not this place.  There wasn't a moment of silence the whole night (DJ would play instrumentals in between songs while waiting for the new singer to come up).  Also, in between rounds of karaoke he would play popular upbeat music.  There was a crowd dancing to the Cupid Shuffle and Cha Cha slide!  You don't see that at Ellis Island, that's for sure!  It was definitely the kind of atmosphere where you could have a great time even if you're not a karaoke fan.  The best part is that all drinks were half priced from midnight- 3am.  The karaoke normally goes 10-2 but the host stayed almost until 4am because people kept tipping him to stay.  Definitely a great place to party- I'd highly recommend it!!"}
{"text":"Came here for my sister in laws bday and ended up staying 2 min.. Bartender Jeremy or johnny or something made this whole experience horrible.. We came around midnight waited way to long outside to be buzzed in.. Asked another person in our party to open the door for us.. And right when we got in that bartender with an attitude was flashing his flashlight all over screaming for our IDs and told the person in our party that if he ever opened the door for anyone again he would be kicked out.. Well we didn't have it and the whole group left.. What bad customer service.. You let us wait outside for so long but didn't waste any time to ask for our iDs right when we come in... Honestly if you don't like working the graveyard shift as a bartender there then you should quit.. We came to celebrate something nice and I wouldn't say you ruined the night for us but you sure did damper it.."}
{"text":"I have lived in Vegas for 12 years now and this place is the most ghetto pub you could ever imagine. They have no regard or respect for customer service. You can't even go to the bathroom after hours without being offered cocaine by the bartenders and patrons. these people just bought the stratosphere?! Good luck you ghetto ass suit and tie mofos."}
{"text":"Great to hang out with friends, the menu is finger foods, they have chairs at the bar so you can gamble there as well."}
{"text":"Nice interior with decent pool tables. There is usually only one staff member at the bar, so dont expect good service. The bartender is also really bad at dozing off and staring at the TV instead of serving the patrons. The food passes for edible, but the prices are too high."}
{"text":"I have been to PLENTY of PT's around the city...some have pool tables, some have kitchens, others are just bars with your shitty Roberto's Tacos or other no-name Mexican spot attached to it. My favorites are the ones that have a kitchen so that I can get my buzz on, order food without having to go into another building, and keep drinking.  This place is not that. In fact, it's one of the PT's with a random Mexican food place attached to it. So why five stars? Well, three stars because a bar is a bar and any establishment that can supply me with alcohol is A-OK in my book. FOUR stars because when you walk into this place you can instantly feel the LOVE. I've walking into PLENTY of a places where the first thing you hear is \"where's your ID, kid?\" I mean, yes, I look 16 but can you say hi and possibly smile while you're at it? Alicia was SO quick to say hello...SO quick to make my sister and I feel welcomed.   So, FIVE stars because Alicia was SO. DAMN. AMAZING that I didn't care that we had to get up and go into another building to order food...I didn't care that the TVs were a bit on the smaller side when watching the Knights game...I didn't care that I had to wait a bit for another round of drinks. And 100% certain, had anyone else been serving that night I probably would not go back to this bar. But now I certainly would and it's a place I can see myself becoming a regular at.  Also, when we were there, it was almost Alicia's birthday. So, happy belated....hope your vacation was awesome and I hope whoever served you drinks met your expectations CUZ GIRL YOU DESERVE IT."}
{"text":"After a night of bowling, my friends and I decided we needed food in our systems! Thank goodness we came during happy hour!  HAPPY HOUR: Half off all drinks and pizza from 4-7pm & 12-3am!  WHAT: Since our favorite pizza wasn't on the menu (The Gilroy), we all came to a consensus on what we wanted on our pizza! The pizza was definitely half off, but since we added several toppings, each topping was 75cents additional- SO WORTH IT!! We created a monster pizza (all meats minus ground beef, and topped it off with jalapenos to create that neede ZING).  The only missing ingredients were tomatoes & mushrooms! BOOOHOOO!!  We also had a bucket of sliders, which were pretty legit!! Also, garlic parmesan twister fries, which I always get at the local PT pubs!! Gotta love me some curly fries!!  & lastly, had to top it off with the Pear Cider!! This has become my new found favorite drink!! I know, it's girly, but I LOVE IT!!  *NOTE: The service was great!! The bartender made it so easy for us to order, and had a great sense of humor! I love people with a good sense of humor. It just brightens my day! =D"}
{"text":"Eh....went here for happy hour. A couple decent beers on tap, but nothing too special. The food was half priced but service was slow. Only two bartenders taking orders and the kitchen was kind of backed up. The food was decent, but again nothing spectacular. Not sure I'd go back."}
{"text":"I wanted breakfast and found out that PT's Place serves it. Jennifer was the bartender and waitress and was wonderful. I had an omelet with hash browns, it was so good. I ate the whole thing. Thank you PT's and Jennifer!"}
{"text":"I wish I could put a no star because 1 star would be giving too much credit at this point. I've never wrote a bad review on yelp because I've always have had great customer service until now as of June 6th 2016. It was my boyfriends birthday and we spent a lot of money along with friends for gambling, playing pool, playing beer pong, buying pizza, and wings,put money into the juke box and the bartender rolls her eyes ALL night like she doesnt want to be at work serving us and even interrupts a conversation that was personal between me and my boyfriend and gives her 2 cents on how she feels.  This was around 6am. We always have a good time here, but they have made our experience really bad now.  We even left our vapor cigarette inside while we were outside talking and we go back to claim it and they tell us they cant help us. Our vape was gone at the bar where we left it. We asked the bartender where it was at and they denied they didnt take it. Nobody else was there. Never have we ever experienced this. The bartender even accused us saying \"your vapor cigarette to smoke weed.?\" we said no to smoke vapor e liquid with nicotine. I've never felt so much disrespect and judgement. With that being said a bartender who is \"suppose\" to provide customer service \"Erin\" who I think is new. I will NEVER EVER go back again after 4 years I've been going there because of this one time. HORRIBLE experienece."}
{"text":"Can we all just agree that the rude unnamed woman that everyone is writing about is Mandi? She is probably the worst bartender I've ever had . Doesn't make sense to treat customers like crap and expect a good tip. Idk that's just me though . Won't be back if she's working .."}
{"text":"Lacey the bartender was not a good or pleasant bartender. I didn't like how my cousin and I walked in at the same time as two males and she served them before us girls. Also, she asked if we wanted to run a tab and we said yes so she asked to hold one of our ID's which is perfectly fine but I noticed she asked the males next to us the same thing but didn't require to hold one of their ID's. She didn't come back to us until our beer was completely empty, mind you we ordered the big cup of beer, to ask if we wanted another one. Normally we stay and have a few beers and maybe a shot but not today. My cousin and I go to PT'S regularly for happy hour after work and this was our worst experience due to Lacey."}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever received at this location.  Sat for 15 minutes before someone came up to me.  After asking for a menu I waited another 15 before I was asked if I want anything.  My wife arrived at 7:10 pm and ordered a blue moon.  At 7:30 we walked out without receiving her drink.  Waitress had conversations with others and played on a computer but waiting 20 minutes for someone to poor a draft beer and bring it over is ridiculous.   The pub was not busy, there was no excuse.  Will not go back."}
{"text":"Awesome service! Lindsay was super friendly, greeted us promptly and asked us what we wanted. She even asked which game we'd like to watch.   Me and wifey had a free drinks and I had a shot of Johnny black and there was only a little left at the bar and Lindsay made good on it by giving me a free drink coupon. Awesome!  Nice ambience, not loud at all then again it wasn't crowded in the bar either. We tipped a few and ordered some pizza from next door at Amores (try there deep dish yummy). No trouble parking at all, they had golden tee golf game, what bar wouldn't be complete without one. Highly recommend this as a happy hour spot or after work bar to enjoy a few drinks."}
{"text":"This is a divier, smokier PT's than most, but the bartenders are friendly (made me aware of a customer rewards card even though I'm a non gamer & they don't serve food) Usually this is a nightcap stop, or occasionally Happy Hour, they usually put up sandwiches or something for the regs. There is a Roberto's connected for those who want to cap off dive bar with dive Mexican. Not a place I'd hang out all night but a good hit & run, service with a smile. Lots of smoke and gamers, no matter what time you stop in."}
{"text":"Very nice PT's. Some in Vegas are trashy but this one looks clean and nice on the inside and they have a great happy hour :)"}
{"text":"Pt's what can you say. They are all the same. Except I popped a royal today after being in Vegas for 10 years. Finnaly! Suzanne was so cool she came by and said good luck then I nailed it. Only her second day on the job too. Thanks suzanne."}
{"text":"Decent place. Was smoky which I hate but it is what it is. Drink prices were very reasonable. Didn't try the food. Has a few pool tables."}
{"text":"This is a nice little pub to go relax and even catch up on some sports if that's what you love to do. The people here are nice and they have 3 pool tables which is usually where I end up. They do get pretty darn busy sometimes so the wait can be a bit every now and then. Pretty clean bathroom for vomiting as well if you need to. All in all great place."}
{"text":"This is the best local bar that I've been too. I've been coming to this bar for about 5 years and they've always been fantastic. Many reviews that you read on this page is comical because they're reviewing the Pts on Charleston down the street from here. The 3 main bartenders at night are Andie, Stephanie, and who we all like to call princess. If you want a good time, they'll give it to you. It's laid back and if you want it poppin come in on Saturday when they karaoke with my boy Mr. Edd"}
{"text":"This is my favorite pts by far, Paulette is the sweetest, her crew (Shelby, Lindsey, Dayra, Ashley, Ray and kitchen) are on point. Quick and great service, great food friendly staff as a local they always make you feel at home and welcome. Been to many pts  through out the Valley but none compare by far."}
{"text":"This bartender is filthy!! The health department would close it down if they saw these violations."}
{"text":"Roger is the only bartender I care for here. He always give great service no matter how busy and always keeps a drink in my hand! The nachos are my favorite things to eat here. They also have really amazing early morning country fried steak! It's only $5 too. There's a lady that works mornings and she's horrible. No service, forgets to give people their beers, and doesn't tilt the glass when she pours it. What a shame. I don't remember her name sadly. They have a bunch of pool tables and a cool little sit down area separate from the bar. It's in the same plaza as Blueberry Hills! It's perfect for those who don't want to spend $15 on a drink at the strip!"}
{"text":"Came in here for the ritst time after work today. It's a huge location right off of decatur end charleston in the same plaza as Walmart! It is bigger than the other ones I've been to! Great service from the morning bartender (his name started with a D) and great nachos. I got a jack n Coke double as usual."}
{"text":"So I am definitely impressed by the change in service.  Tanya has seriously improved things there as the service is the best it has ever been.  The drinks are never empty, bar is always clean, and the place is back to fun atmosphere.  It has made  a difference with having a regular and caring staff again."}
{"text":"This location is literally 2 blocks from our home. My husband and I would frequent this place oh so often, and have spent a lot of money patronizing this establishment. We've never had any issues until recently when Erin the bartender, (shes mostly there at night) accused my husband of throwing up outside in the parking lot on one occasion and unofficially 86'd him and told him he had to leave and never come back. My husband tried to explain to her that she was mistaking him for another gentlemen that was with my husband that evening who had too much to drink and did throw up. She was very rude, my husband was never rude to her, my husband asked her for proof of the incident which she could not provide. I don't know what kind training she's had but it's definitely not customer service friendly. She has singled out my husband as if she has a personal problem with him. And argue every time he has asked for proof and threatens to call Metro if he doesn't leave. She said that he can come when she's not working her shift because and I'm quoting her \"this is HER bar\" ???? What working employee says that? Thats how you know she was lying because \"86\" means your not allowed there period. No matter who is working. It seems like a personal issue or she's discriminating against my husband for being an African American hard working  paying customer.  We've asked for the mangers info and Erin has refused to give it to my husband. You don't treat customers like this. We won't be going to any PT's locations thanks to this horrible experience with this rude bartender Erin. Also don't count on having the music you pay for play because Erin bragged to customers that she's able to control the music tunes from her phone. And if she doesn't like a song she will skip it and play music that she likes, so if you ever wonder why your song that you paid isn't playing. It's because it's being skipped."}
{"text":"Cant remember exactly which location I went to but they are all over the fricken place it seems so I am sure they are about the same no matter the location. As one person put it, a PTs is a PTs is a PTs. Anyways, went to Vegas 4th of July weekend 2011 to visit a friend. We were going to see Ralphie May the night I got there so my friend took me to PT's for a bite to eat before the show since this place was close to the casino and it was supposed to be \"fast.\" Although the waitress was nice, I am pretty sure she forgot about us after she dropped off our food cause we waited around forever for her to refill drinks and just to get our check. PTs is a smoking bar also so if you hate the smell of cigarette smoke, you should not come here. Also, because of this, children (under 18 that is) are not allowed in this bar/ restaurant.  No for the food, my friend ordered a chicken sammich which she said was really dry and the chicken was overcooked. I ordered the BLTA which was ok but the bread was toasted to the point of being difficult to bite into and it cut up the roof of my mouth. I was not impressed PT's is one of those places that is on every corner in LV it seems and I am not sure why. Maybe they have awesome drinks and drink specials or something because I can't honestly see how there would be such a demand to warrant having so many locations when judging by my experience, this place was crap. The extra star is simply because the atmosphere was clean, our waitress friendly (although still kinda sucky), big water cups so we didnt have to wait for as many refills, and I remember the fries being decent. Other than that, I don't think I will ever understand the appeal of PT's from investors willing to open so many freakin locations!"}
{"text":"Very small PTs. We usually just come here to eat during happy hour because it's just right down the street.   Coming here so often we became known with the bartender, Jeff. He's the greatest. I'm notorious for googling cocktails. So I would just shout out some drinks to him & he would gladly make them. Sometimes I would come in & he would be like I have a drink you're gonna like and of course I love it! Some nights I would crave a certain taste & I'll let him know and he'll just put some stuff together for me. He's amazing.   For the food-- it's bar food. The beau loves their chicken wings so that's what we usually get. The pizzas are half off during happy hour so once in a while we'll get a pizza.   Last night the cook wasn't there though, disappointingly! So we just had a few cocktails and left."}
{"text":"Las Vegas, is the city where adults come to play. Gamble, clubbing, drinking, whatever it is your 21 and over heart's desire. As with any city, it's best to know where the locals go (even better to know a local) so you can have the inside scoop of where to go, what to eat, what to do.  Thanks again Cheska for showing my fellow L.A. Yelpers and I another spot to go, especially on the cheap. If you've ever been to Las Vegas, you already know and expect to pay an arm and a leg on the strip for anything, that's why, to make your almighty dollar stretch, you go off and beyond the strip.  Happy Hour prices were insane. I remember getting two drafts (domestic, the biggest ones they had in glasses), a mixed drink, and a bottle of Heine for less than $7!! Yes, less than $7! That's almost unheard of from the places I go to in L.A.   The only drawback, my friends were ribbing me a bit about getting bottled beer and told me to just get a tall glass of someone from tap. I asked the bartender what came close to Henie or Hef, in which he proceeds to say \"I don't know, um, O'douls?\" I didn't know, so I said, OK, and $3 later, I came back to the table.   My friends ask me what I'm drinking..I proceed to tell them what had transpired and that's when the entire table laughed at me. WTH?! I don't know!! That's when they told me, I basically had a non-alcoholic beer in my possession! That's pure and utter sacrilege!! If I'm going to get a beer gut from drinking said liquid refreshment, I better get some alcohol with it. Needless to say, the O'douls didn't even get half way finished the rest of the night and I went back to my Heine's thank you very much.  Also, we happened to go on karaoke night and one of the patrons (with a friend of his) got Linkin Park mixed up with some death metal band the way he was singing \"In The End\".   Overall, a nice locals hangout with cheap drinks. I did notice they had food, but did not try it out. Hmmm, \"PT's Bucket of Sliders\"? Interesting."}
{"text":"This a nice bar.  But the bartender Shannon ruins it.   Plays 80's pop all night such as boy George and pep shop boys.  Forget asking her a question she gets mad and pretty much kicks you out (places bill in front of you rudely) want to sit at the bar?, not at a machine, even if it's dead she'll make you move.  Oh you just dropped 100 bucks, too bad you are not playing anymore.  I have tried a few times to give this lady a chance due to niceness of bar and location but I'll go to pts down the street rob is way nicer, Shannon ruined it for me. It's a shame, bar has great potential. Pts off 10940 s Eastern."}
{"text":"Super Bowl 2011  Ordered: Coors Light on tap- Ice cold and cheap! Party bucket of Buffalo wings (feeds 3)      PROS- * Good Food for cheap * Friendly staff * plenty of seating * happy hour *AYCE sliders, wings, pizza for super bowl  CONS- * no happy hour during super bowl * overwhelming smell of cigarettes * no hand soap in bathroom  TIPS- * Sharing is caring:  Take advantage of their awesome party buckets for wings.  You can order up to 3 different flavors.  I highly recommend trying the Garlic Parmesan flavor!! * I'm not lucky at gambling at all, but I was lucky here... 5/6 #s on keno * pool tables available behind bar * had wings then realized there was no more soap?  It's okay... ask for a lemon wedge and extra napkins.  It serves as a good substitute to clean off those fingers and kill the wing scent.  Overall, this is a great place to enjoy the game.  There are enough tv screens in the place so there is no bad seat in the house.  The only thing that hindered a perfect score for me was the lack of the happy hour during the Super Bowl game.  Bummer!"}
{"text":"I generally love PTs. Good vibe, laid back, pool, reasonably priced drinks, etc. But the two bartenders here very OBVIOUSLY don't like each other, and deliver poor customer service as a result of it. They don't pick up each other's slack, or seem to help each other beyond the bare minimum.  My friend and I asked one of them (Mike, I think) for a glass of water before we left. Mike replied something to the effect of it not being his particular responsibility at that time. He didn't even tell the other bartender that we had requested it. So we are sitting there another 5 minutes for her to come back around to get us water. Keep in mind, this is a bar.   This isn't the first time I've received crap service at this location from those two. They even look miserable working together; arguing as they are working, both with resting-\"grumpy\"-face grimacing. The dude is curt and dismissive, and she just seems fed up.  Anyway, I won't be going back to this one. Sucks, too. This was my favorite spot."}
{"text":"Wow. I came here at 3 am because I was hungry. the bartender, Ricky, threw the menu at me, gave me the ultimatum when i ordered wings. The worst service i have ever seen! Not only that, I left him tip on the table, and he came by and made a sarcastic comment about it. He was lucky i even left him a tip! Seriously the worst PTs I have ever been to: and I am born and raised here. I should know."}
{"text":"Cool bartenders and good bar food. Beer pong, pool tables, and HOT machines!"}
{"text":"Best PTs in my opinion. They have beer pong tables and pool tables. It's close to UNLV so there usually a big crowd after games or on the weekends. I usually go with a big group and drink through happy hour.   My favorite thing is there selections. They have the pear cider and it's the BOMB. Usually the bartenders and really cool, they get a little busy so you gotta be patient."}
{"text":"I had been here before and didn't get great or even good service so never went back but I wanted to watch the Stanley cup game not to far from my house with other fans and needless to say they did disappoint again I got there early so service was good but as soon as the people came in I got totally ignored when I told the bartender I was ready to order more she said give her a second and she never returned she was helping other people at the other end of the bar and new people that had just walked up but didn't even give me a second glance so after waiting 15min for her to come back I said no more I asked for my check and then left I will never go back there again I call it shit service"}
{"text":"Quite honestly, the reason that I am a fan is that they have a lot of pool tables, they offer free pool on certain nights, and the bartenders, male or female, are always awesome. PLUS, I get this humongous beer for 2.50 during happy hour with my PT card. Or free if playing 5 quarters. Can one really beat this? Okay, maybe, but I still love this location of the PTs. The food is okay, but what do you expect? It's a bar."}
{"text":"The evening bartender Joe is amazing love him and only reason I come back....the new bartender Kevin he needs an attitude adjustment...Example:made a comment when I asked for fries. Told me Sonic is next door..hmmm does Sonic serve beer now too??"}
{"text":"Will never be back.... so obvious the tightening of machines and horrible customer service. What you have built will come crumbling down because you lost your focus..... #sosad"}
{"text":"We love it! Gary and Toni are the best! My hubby and I like to go for a quick beer and a friendly environment. Great locals spot for Summerlin folks."}
{"text":"Very slow service for the night time. This one sucks in comparison to the on on horizon ridge. But then again different side of town."}
{"text":"Worst place ever! Don't recommend at all!  The service is awful and the waitress was very rude"}
{"text":"Well no blended drinks here! So it's gonna be margarita's & a shot of patron tonite.  There was only 1 bartender (poor guy!) but all went well! Thank u smooches"}
{"text":"Always a nice place to chill with friends good food a lot of pool table, beer pong table cheap drinks and friendly stuff"}
{"text":"Their lunchtime double cheeseburger w/fries for $6 was simply the best burger my wife and I have had in many many years. Quick, friendly and accommodating. And their home brew was awesome. Thanks"}
{"text":"This is the place if you are in The Lakes! Great servers happy hour 5-7 daily! the Big O Burger!"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service at this location. The bartender Shannon is quite a sad woman. I've been coming here a few times a month but last night was the last straw. To begin with she has a big attitude problem towards certain people. She intentionally ignores you and your requests. She takes a long time to tend to you. She gets everybody else's drinks but me and she never comps a drink even a soda water she charges for even tho I play 10 or 20 dollars every time I go there. Last night I had ordered drinks and pizza and playing video poker. When my food arrived I began to watch a tv series on my phone. She came over and said \"Do you have earplugs you can use?\" I was amazed bc I couldn't hear my phone over her  music. I asked if it's really loud and she replied yes I can't hear anything... She then said that \"it's not a party bar and that she has had this conversation with me before and that I can't use my phone to call people in HER bar\". This offended me quite a bit. I will tell everyone I know about their practices and crappy client service. This is sad because other bartenders like ... who's amazing at what she does are stuck here as well. DON'T GO HERE. GO TO VILLAGE PUB RIGHT IN FRONT OF THIS PLACE. GO TO SHAKESPEARS. GO TO REMEDYS. GO TO BORN AND RAISED."}
{"text":"Buddies put in a decent amount of money into 3 machines equaling $540. The original bartender only comped if you played dollar bets and the second bartender won't comp unless he sees you gamble. We bring up the comps and he stated \"I think you guys are just trying to take advantage of the situation\". Not sure if their rules are different from any others, but unless your only trying to drink and not gamble, this is your place."}
{"text":"It's a PT's. It's definitely not the worst PT's in the city like some have suggested. It is surprisingly large and inviting inside, but it had a funky smell the day we went in. The bartender also told us that about 75% of the beers were pouring foam so we had to have bottled beer. There are lots of TVs and video poker machines as well as plenty of seating for non-gamers. The food was on par with other PT's, though my bikini wrap had the faintest hint of spearmint and I can't figure out why. The Philly Cheese Steak was surprisingly good. Get the tots every time. There seems to be a lot of regulars here and the staff was very accommodating. I was definitely expecting a much older and small PT's but this was a surprise. Now I won't be afraid to come here and I will be back."}
{"text":"This is my home Pts. John the manager is an amazing person and I just love coming to see him. The bar is big and it never gets too crazy. Food here is really good and it comes out quick."}
{"text":"if you are in this bar, you have to del with johnny as your bartender, he definitely makes the experience  a good one.  without johnny it may not be quite what i experienced"}
{"text":"This is a great place to watch a Football game and the staff is super nice and always willing to serve.  The Happy Hour specials are well priced."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst PT's experience ever. I go in for lunch this bar lady/hostess decides to take my order with her back to me. Takes her 10 minutes to get my drink. Another 30 minutes go by and I realized I am really hungry and my burger still hadn't arrived. I get up and she asked to close out my tab. What the heck, tab, you should be paying me for wasting time. Her only reply was \"I don't know what to tell you\". How bout you need to fire yourself but before you do that, have a performer assessment with who ever hired you and tell them you are sorry for your deceitful interview. This happened at 240pm 6/8/2017 I left at 330pm even hungrier than I came."}
{"text":"Glazed over the other reviews.  What about the cleanliness of this place?? Umm.... no.  But it's awesome isn't it.  Pool tables.  Old drunkies at 2PM.  Sliders, fried wings, french fries.  Preps the stomach for a long weekend of drinking and overdosing on everything, in its own weird way.  The burger kind of reminds me of a Whitecastle burger.    A lot of locals come here."}
{"text":"Hidden on the corner of Eastern & Sun Ridge this pt's is a nice place to relax & enjoy some food & drinks. Come see Josh at night, great bartender."}
{"text":"Yes, I am a fan. Maybe even a super fan. I have now been to this specific PT's on Eastern and St.Rose and had an excellent experience.   When I first arrived I was alone and the bartender immediately came over to me even though I had zero makeup on and glasses. Major points for that. He was friendly and told me about their Golden Rewards Club which I was instantly sold on. Half off pizza and booze from 3p-7p. This made my Ginger Ale-Vodkas under $4 a piece. Which the bartender stayed on top of. But the star of this show was the freakin pizza. I must say I haven't stopped thinking about it. On Facebook I might put myself in a relationship(not open) with the Gilroy Pizza from Pt's. A perfectly crisp thin crust with Zesty garlic ranch sauce, cheese, pepperoni, Italian sausage, mushroom and diced tomatoes. It was the bomb!!!! I had a moment with this pizza and almost ate the entire pie on my own. Even if you are not a drinker go just for this pie. The bathrooms and bar area were spotless and two thumbs up for the service. The reason it gets a four is because I am not huge on the red plastic cups used as ashtrays and the smoking in general. Sorry smokers, but smoking is so 1989. Yes, I will be back for the pie and the booze this week!!!!!!"}
{"text":"My first time here - Good fun! I was with good company, the atmosphere was kewl to and the sstaff was nice. I did order Pizza - and let me say it was pretty tasty!  If you're a gamer - they do have gaming machines at the bar!  Defiantely a great go to place if you ever need to just have a nice cold beer and wind down after a long day, i would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Was in there today. Asked for virgin bloody mary while I put some money in the machine for keno. It was the worst I ever had.just couldn't drink it. Ordered a beer instead but was charged for it even though I was playing and had to return the first drink. While I was there a customer was buzzing 3 times at the door to get in but the bartender was too busy getting snacks in the kitchen to notice. That customer walked away. This isn't so much a knock on the place as it is the bartender who was a short, blonde girl."}
{"text":"I love this pts because of Roger. But if he's not working at night it's not worth coming because the partner guy with the slick back hair doesn't really care for taking your order if you don't know what you want right away. I called him over to get a drink at least 5 times and didn't get anything from him. But Roger makes it worth coming. Other than that the dude sucks.  PS. His name is Peter. Be on the lookout."}
{"text":"Meh.kinda boring over priced for what you get,not happy about my meal requested no meat because I'm a vegetarian in my omelette and well ya meat was all in it.Bar tenders are nice. a little different but nice"}
{"text":"It's a PT's... it's a bar, with beer. And liquor. And TV's. And pool tables.  It's PT's. If you live in Vegas and you need to read a review for PT's, maybe you should just leave your house every once in awhile; PT's is everywhere. Good for a drink or five, obviously."}
{"text":"This was the worst experience I've had at PTs! My bartender with blonde and pink hair never introduced herself, so I do not know her name.I asked if she knew what they had for happy hour and she named two things off the menu! I asked if they had the shrimp she said no. I asked if the shrimp were on the menu she said no. I asked what they had for happy hour and she named off each appetizer extremely fast and then said there is pizza and walked away. She was so rude my fiancé and I decided to leave. I've always loved PTs but after this experience I won't be back to this location. Don't be rude to customers."}
{"text":"Always great service,  has never been too crowded and they have drink specials."}
{"text":"A PT\"s is a PT's is a...well you get it. Great happy hour and the food is slightly better than bar average. Service always seems slow but tolerable. We generally smoke cigars there and nobody seems to mind, so that is a huge plus. Get some eager cute waitresses and this becomes a 4 star place!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I rarely receive decent service at PT's bars around Las Vegas and this one is no different. The lady manning the bar last night, a little after 8pm (6/16/15), seemed like she hated her job. She was just pissed off and slugged around the bar reluctantly serving guests, never once flashing a smile. I ordered a Long Island Iced Tea and it was really weak (and I'm not even a fan of strong drinks!). When I was finished, I was waiting to get a bill and proceeded to stare at her for 10 MINUTES, waved my hands a few times when she was walking towards me, and I even politely asked her for the bill when she walked by. Eventually, I became fed up and simply left without paying.....and I don't feel badly about it at all, the drink and service sucked.  To PT's management: Do an overhaul on your employees. Finding a job around here is rough these days are there are a plethora of skilled individuals who will be THRILLED to find paid work. It's to the point where I mention these outings to my friends and they respond by saying: \"Why would you go THERE?! PT's SUCKS!\" This is when you know it's time to find a more upbeat and friendly staff, typically a requirement in the hospitality industry..."}
{"text":"So this is not my favorite place to go I was just really craving a a club sandwich the good thing is is that it was close by and I got my club they put too much mayonnaise on it but I'm okay with it. I like the one that's closer to my house but this one was just kind of kind of close by I was just leaving the mall and I wanted something to eat and I was in Chinatown area and I didn't want Chinese food I wanted something different so I ended up getting that"}
{"text":"Ordered 4 drinks. Only got 2. Bartender took FOREVER to come check on us when there was only 3 ppl in the bar.... Including me and my girl. Put $60 in the machine and NEVER got a drink. Bet a $20 hand hoping he would maybe one day notice since he was standing right in front of me, NOPE! Service sucks. Rather spend $20 on a drink on the strip than 20 mins here wasting time."}
{"text":"What can I say if you've seen one. You've seen them all or  at least the inside looks like the same bar different variations for the most part same atmosphere. good beers, friendly bartenders, decent food and maybe a four of a kind.  This is like a mini PT's but always good for a quick beer."}
{"text":"There are numerous PT's around town and this one needs work on the basics. First off I can understand a shift change, when one Bartender leaves and another one takes over. Yes there is a delay since one person is leaving and the other is coming on duty, but at least acknowledge the guests that are waiting at the bar to order. \"Be right with you, shift change\", but here around midnight, not a single word or even a glance up to make eye contact. Then when the change over is completed, the Bartender should take care of business, but not here. We waited a little longer and since there is no table service, I go up to order again and finally get acknowledged! I order my beers and when she goes to the tap, the keg is empty! So without saying a word she goes to the back room to change it. After another delay she comes out and starts to serve some other people, I'm like...What?! So I go back up to the bar and when she comes over to see me again, I ask what happened to the beers I ordered? She says, \"we are out of it\". Well after nearly 1/2 hour of wasted time, it's time to leave for some other bar! This PT's sux!  (This is a delayed review from December 2015)"}
{"text":"What a terrible PT's this is. From the moment I pulled into the parking lot, it was a bad experience. Upon walking in, I immediately felt unwelcome. The bartender, Tip, continuously argued with 2 customers. The customer kept nagging him childishly, but he continued to argue and insult her using profanity like a bully. He should have taken the high road by ending the conversation for the sake of customer service. When I ordered my drink, which was during happy hour so it is advertised as half price, the bartender over charged me. I asked him the drink price and he responded 6.50. I was skeptical that my beer was 13.00 before happy hour prices so I asked him if it was supposed to be $3.50 and not the $4.75 he charged me? He became upset after going through the math with me. He exclaimed loudly and in a very annoyed manner that I was right. He even took out two dollars from his pocket and put it on the bar aggressively saying I could have it. It was very rude and it seemed as though he was looking for a fight. I just wanted to watch the baseball game and drink for happy hour. He continued to argue with the woman and her husband and complained loudly throughout the hour that I was there that he disliked the crowd tonight and he couldn't wait till the game was over so that people would leave. If he hates his job so much that everything bothers him he should not be there. It was an extremely negative and aggressive environment.  I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I went here and the service was slow. The bartender was very rude to me for no reason after our drinks where taking 15 minutes for us to get them."}
{"text":"My favorite local bar, w my favorite local bartender Candace.  I'm  not usually a yelper but as someone who is there A LOT! ( probably too much ;)) I need to give credit where credit is due. I witnessed some patrons arguing w Candace for over 1/2 hr about how they shouldn't have to pay their tab when they put money in a machine so it should be comped. First off, Anyone who plays knows it's pretty common to play at least a $20 for a comp. This patron was trying to scam the bar by putting in a 20 getting a drink and cashing out. Candace was a total professional about it as She calmly and nicely explained the policy over and over to the people who were very rude and clearly just out to not pay their tab. Im not sure I've seen anyone be so patient. I was super impressed how well she handled the situation and will continue to come there for her awesome service. Go Candace!"}
{"text":"This place blows...Rookies, gamble 40.00 get like a drink maybe 2 if you are lucky. I WILL NEVER! Go back to this bar....local rip-off...3rd time DONE..LOCALS SPEND YOUR MONEY ELSEWHERE."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving this 3 Stars is because of the happy hour. The bartender might as well have been a change girl. No personality and no social skills just waiting for a toke. He was so insignificant in the experience his name was insignificant . With all the people unemployed or underemployed in this city I can't believe this is the best help the PT's can find."}
{"text":"I feel like Seth Y. needs to learn how to Yelp because he's AWFUL. It's like reading a review written by a drunk hobo. Based on last nights events that isn't too far off. PT's is obviously a local bar that has lots of tasty libations and typical pub food. A huge bar and pool tables makes any drunken night more memorable. Now go drink!"}
{"text":"This PT's loses stars because they don't serve food but they gain it back in their attentive and friendly bartenders. I generally only come to this location to bet sports but if anything goes wrong with the machine the bartender is always quick to help and offers a hello or a welcome back every time I walk in the door.   Unfortunately this location always smells like an ash tray regardless of the actual amount of smokers in the bar. Because of this I barely want to stay more than a few minutes before retreating to fresh air."}
{"text":"A bit of a painful star rating,  the place used to better until new management took over.  Since the management the good quality has decreased, the staff are not very talkative, and service is slower.  Food is average bar food, they have a pool table but over all your best bet is to by pass this bar and travel down the road a bit."}
{"text":"I had bad experiences in the past but they have new management and they have solved the issues. Started coming back and the new manager Patricia is awesome and the new bartenders are great. Haven't had a complaint since. Jeff is a great bartender if you happen to get him. Oh and they finally give pizza boxes for your remainder pizza, thanks Patrica!"}
{"text":"This PT's is very dimly lit, and they only had two employees on staff on the Saturday my wife and I went there. It's clear this location is all about the machines and nothing more."}
{"text":"Love this local bar.  Every time I come in I am ALWAYS greeted with a hello.  The bartenders, Shelby, Laura and Angel are friendly and always come around quickly and ask me for my initial order and they regularly do follow-ups to see how I am doing.  I love the atmosphere there and feel at home when I do stop by.  Ordering food is easy and is usually quick to come out and tastes good too.  I never had problems obtaining free drinks while I was gambling.   Love this place!"}
{"text":"Absolute worst Customer service EVER!!! If I could give no stars I would. Complete waste of time, bartenders didn't even acknowledge us after sitting at the bar for over 10 mins. Sloppy bartenders kinda glad I left."}
{"text":"The deals for happy hour are amazing! Half off on 16 inch pizzas AND half off on any drink!! The bartenders are all really friendly and attentive! Lisa and Angel are the best! Food is yummy too!"}
{"text":"Jessie is the best bartender ever... I would have given myself more stars if there was an opportunity"}
{"text":"I was getting my haircut next door at supercuts and came to PT's to get a drink while I was waiting I played $60 on video poker.  When I first sat down at 4:15 I was asked if I wanted something to drink and i ordered a gin and soda (which was 4oz w ice and wasn't very strong at all). I waited another 15 min until I got  frustrated and asked a waitress if I could get another and she said well im technically off!!!!  Well I spent $60 un your establishment its not that hard to pour a gin and soda takes 2 min if that.  I feel disrespected and wont come back or recommend due to poor service!    There are multiple venues in the city that offer video poker and drinks.  I dont need to be ignored or told im off so tell your other 2 co- workers this gentlemen would like a gin and soda and pick up the pace!!!  Lazy and entitled.  I live 4 min from the venue and wont return again!!!!"}
{"text":"Super slow service and a really small cramped space.  Not my favorite place to go for happy hour or to watch football but I go because it's near work. Good beer specials but crummy service in an unclean bar. I'm surprised it's so poorly run considering it's part of a chain. Lots of parking is available and there are pool tables for use. The bar takes up most of the restaurant.  If you want alcohol, slow service, and sub par bar food, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"This location is NOT closed.  We ate there yesterday.  My husband has been to another location, so we stopped here for a bite before heading out of Vegas.  Although it says bar and grill on the outside, it is really BAR.  They do have a full menu of sandwiches, chili, and these new buckets of wings, fries, etc.   We sat at the bar and ordered, the bartender/ server was friendly.  There were several people sitting at the bar either drinking/ eating/ gambling/ all 3.   It was dark in there like a bar, but the food was rather good.  We split both the Cuban (ham, terrific pulled pork, pickles and grilled onions) and the Philly cheese steak topped with Cheez Whiz.  LOL.  We also had sweet potato tots and garlic fries.  The garlic fries went REALLY good with my Copperhook beer!  Overall, seems like a great local bar to hang out in.  Food is pretty tasty.  Service was friendly.  Didn't get any bad looks from locals in the bar.  Ha. ha."}
{"text":"Nice as she was, my great-grandmother smoked three packs a day and cooked chicken liver; this PTs smells like Grandma's place. Despite the smell, I hung out longer than expected.  Our wings came in paper \"buckets.\" I have never wanted to eat out of a bucket, but if I do, it shouldn't be disposable. It's doubly offensive. PT's wings are crispy, though, and the five of us had no problem finishing off the largest bucket size available. I ate the last one.  Patrons should know that there is no fruit on premises, not even an orange slice for your Blue Moon, which is served in a big glass for only two or three bucks. Thank you, PTs.   To top off our night, our waitress shared her marble birthday cake with us.   With all the cake, food, drinks, conversation, and deadly smoke, I could almost feel Grandma Dye in the room. It was a good night."}
{"text":"This is our favorite local bar. Steve the manager is very personable and has our beers waiting for us as soon as my fiancee and I come through the door. I have luck every now and then and have hit 8 out of 8 on my usual keno machine. The regulars are friendly and there is often group conversations full of laughter.  The music is often controlled by the customers. Yes, there are certain bands/songs that are frowned upon. But only because they can be offensive and crude. I happen to be one of those people whose music is restricted. But with thousands of songs available,there is always a favorite or two I can play.   When it comes to sports everyone is invited. During football season you will see many different teams represented throughout the bar. In spite of being in Hendertucky, I have found there to be always be a diverse clientel. Young and old, we all hang out together.   The food is great ! Especially the Asian Cole slaw. It is almost addictive. The pizza is half price at happy hour and is delightful. (I'm a new yorker)   Overall it is a great locals bar that is welcoming to everyone. Perhaps I'll see you there."}
{"text":"This is one of the better PTs that I have been too and I must say it is quite nice for just a neighborhood bar. What makes this one is the staff, they are much friendlier than most of the PTs that I have been too around on a consistent basis.  The few times I have had a burger or the steak and eggs they have always been spot on."}
{"text":"Great little local bar.  Always feel welcome coming in for a hot meal and cold drink.  They also have a couple bar games such as darts, golden tee and a pool table."}
{"text":"We live right around the corner.  The bartender Chris was awesome.  He was always there but never intrusive.  We will be back.  I've been to many PTs and this guy on rampart is the best!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere in this place is about the only thing this place has going on on a Saturday night. The bartender \"mark\" did a horrible job with service. Had me and my group waiting about an hour to get anything. I waited an hour to order some food. I finally got up and complained to the manager about my dilemma.  She was very attentive and took care of my problem(thanks jessie). Everytime mark came  around he kept acting like a complete a**hole. This guy needs to be replaced with a hearltess evil vilian, maybe he'll be a better bartender."}
{"text":"I live nearby this one and have gone in a few times.  It never gets any better.  Once I ordered chicken and waffles.  They gave me one crusty frozen waffle and two dinky pieces of stauffer's frozen chicken and a plastic cup with cold syrup in it.  Another time my wife ordered a lemon drop.  The indifferent bartender gave her an unchilled shot with no sugar or lemon wedge and charged us eight bucks for it.  That same night we had probably 3 big beers a piece, some shots, and split some mozzarella sticks.  We also each lost $20 on the machines.  Our bill for drinks and food even though we were playing, and part of the time was happy hour, was about $80.  So did we have $120 worth of fun?  Nope.  The message I got was clear:  \"We don't care about your business, give us your money and leave.\""}
{"text":"This place Is kinda like \"Cheers\" where everybody knows your name... except In this bar everyone forgets It the next day. Great memories and moments can develop here and the happy hour roks! It starts nightly after12pm and you can get a club card to earn points for drinking and munching."}
{"text":"My favorite locals bar and this location in particular is always a great time. The graveyard bartender JJ is the man ! Always prompt with great service and makes the whole group laugh. Great food and a great late night happy hour from midnight-2am"}
{"text":"I was accused of not paying my bill, loudly across the whole bar. The bartender even told people i work with that i didnt pay my bill. I have my receipt from the night in question. Needless to say i am never going back."}
{"text":"Cheap drinks at happy hour!   $3 any well drinks, what a deal! Come and get wasted!"}
{"text":"Service was excellent, very prompt, the drinks were amazing and the bartender got our orders correct.    The Hawaiian Burger was great but could have done with a few more fries.   My biggest complaint was the smoke, but I went in knowing full well that would be an issue.    We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great happy hour. Stone IPA on tap. Great deal when it's 50% off!  We stopped in around 6pm. My only real complaint was, no waitress. I've been to other PT's where a waitress would come around to your table. No such luck here. The bartender was friendly, but the woman who brings out your food from the kitchen, was not. :/  In any case, we will come back for happy hour."}
{"text":"Don't come looking for craft cocktails or craft beers and you'll be fine. Surprisingly bigger than it looks and all the bartenders are extremely friendly. There's golden tee, a pool table, and a juke box. What else could you want? Yes it might be the most neglected PT'S in the chain but if you're just looking for a neighborhood bar you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been a patron at this PT's for about 5 years, and it's great. The management here is superb, and the bartenders are always friendly. Pedro is a super friendly cook, always has a smile, and makes me feel like I'm at home. The same goes for James and Ashley. They all look out for their customers, make sure everyone is safe, and generally create an atmosphere that is super chill. Halloween is always my favorite time to go because they really decorate the place, and it's a lot of fun. Whether you want a place to play video poker and have some cocktails after work, or meet your friends to start a night of partying before heading downtown, I highly recommend you come to this PT's location."}
{"text":"This is My Fav, Local Bar, This is my \"Cheers\" Where I get to know a lot of other locals and have a good time with never a worry. prices compared to other places I have gone are nice. Happy hour I think is 4-7pm and 12am-4am where things are half price. The Bartenders are cool and not afraid to chat it up. there's 3 pool tables a dart board and they have a beer pong table, with plenty of seating. Sat Night at 10pm-2am is Karaoke always fun. There's no food here but they let you bring in food."}
{"text":"Food - good bar food! (Pizza, wings, fries, bikini wrap w wing sauce!) YUM!  Service - Mark - like WHOA! Happiest, most professional person I've ever met. I'll come here all the time just because of the way I was treated by him. THANK YOU MARK!!!  Cleanliness- it's all good. No complaints. Security- don't feel like I'm gonna get shot or robbed. Hmmm idk.. A lot of fun stuff! Love the darts!"}
{"text":"Anthony aka Tony charged my friends and I full price for drinks during happy hour...confronted him and made an excuse that only certain drinks are half off. $9.74 for a bud light? No thank you. #trash"}

{"text":"I was on hold for 20 minutes and all I wanted to do was order wings. Didn't feel like cooking. I truly blame management. They have 1 bartender on a busy night. I picked this pt's because its close to my house and being in customer service I know what its like to be overwhelmed and busy buuuut I have also worked at a restaurant and we had to multitask. To forget someone on the phone is not the way to go. No manager on duty either...what kind of crap is that? Would have given 1 star but the food is always good."}
{"text":"I'm starting to think that PT's trains their bartenders to not refill your drink unless you ask."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and avoid the morning weekend shift.  Between the bartender who was more interested in her cellphone than actually serving the customers, forgotten or ignored drink orders and breakfast menu food that was delivered without eggs.  There are better options out there for breakfast."}
{"text":"EEEEEWWWW!!!! DO NOT EAT HERE!!!!!!!!!  My boyfriend and I went into this particular PT's last week. We saw their signs talking about their \"happy\" hour and we were hungry so we went in and ordered a couple beers and a pizza to share. The pizza for sure was nothing great. I've had frozen pizzas that taste better. But here's the kicker....MOLD IN THEIR PARMESAN CHEESE.   About half way through our pizza (and putting parmesan cheese on each slice) some green cheese came out. SO NASTY! At first we were like, is that really mold? You know how dark these places can be. Sure enough......MOLD!!!!   NAUSEA took over. We told the manager, who obviously comped our bill. Was that enough? Hell no. We will never go into a PT's. I mean seriously....what kind of quality control is that? Oh how I wish a health inspector had seen it.   It was such a disappointment. I only gave them one star because otherwise Yelp wouldn't accept this post.   NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER....get it?"}
{"text":"This is my favorite PTs..Staff is amazing especially Courtney and Ashley. So friendly, they make delicious micheladas and really nice."}
{"text":"So Shannon the bartender must've stuck her forked tongue into both side-slots of a power outlet. That's only way I can explain the terrifying coiffure her head can somehow can support. Either that or she has cryogenically frozen each strand in place, which sounds more accurate based on her icy demeanor. I understand good help is hard to find, but so it the sarcophagus this woman must sleep in to not crumple her tender 'do. This place is empty as a tomb anyway which leads me to believe in the sarcophagus explanation. I'd go to another bar if I were you and were in the area. Plenty of draft handles on eastern."}
{"text":"Taylors service was spectacular. She's one of a kind, gary on the other hand..... also awesome, love the banter."}
{"text":"Good food enjoyed the philly cheese steak, the appetizer cheese mozzarella would probably not get again, loved the Mango Maggie! Only real complaint was the blaring music over the couch/tv area near the pool table for the first 2 hours we were there. We asked the guy if it was possible to turn it down and he said he doesn't have control over it. After 2 hours the music got louder while they adjusted it then it got normal volume and much more bearable. Unfortunately we were ready to head out by then."}

{"text":"Best local bar ever. The bartender Kyle is amazing and Cynthia in the kitchen is fabulous. Always feel welcomed and food is always great. (Especially the tater tots)."}
{"text":"Hands down the worst bar I've ever been to and I'm originally from Detroit, Michgan. The bartender Michelle, who I think is the assistant manager, is a rude and very unprofessional bartender. She is the perfect example of what not to be in a bar employee. Never smiles unless to regulars, terrible attitude, doesn't comp drinks even if you put a $100 in, and then rolls her eyes at a $5 tip after she totally wrecks you on your comps. Will only go back in the mornings to see the girl who is from Indianapolis and is nothing but courteous and comps well. But overall, DON'T COME HERE! MICHELLE WILL RUIN YOUR EXPERIENCE. AWFUL IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT!!!!"}

{"text":"Don't judge the outside before judging with this place. I came to this location a week ago around 9pm during the week and really enjoyed myself. Kyle and Nicole were working and they were very friendly and welcoming. I had a build your own veggie pizza and it was cooked well, the crust was perfect not soggy and was very tasty. I definitely recommend this location to others."}
{"text":"This is my neighborhood pts and i really like hanging out here. But ever since the change in management its no longer friendly, at least not to islanders from what i can see. Since this new manager started she's treated me and any with me rudely. As if i was trying to cheat her out of drinks. She's overcharged my wife for food and when she paid her bill, this manager \"Angel\" says that she didn't and says that if she did she would remember. She said that just before she finds it behind the bar where she put it. I've never dealt with racism before so i dont real know how to react."}
{"text":"I'm usually the guy who disregards the haters and skips the negative yelp reviews, because people can be emotional and have bias opinion based on one experience.... This time had I heeded the negative warning it would have saved me!!  I went in at 1:30am on a Monday on my way home from a holiday party, completely sober. They were dead empty and I walked to the bar and sat down for a moment to read Vegas weekly before ordering. I was there for about 30 seconds glancing between the menu and the paper before I had my first encounter with the bar tender who, had zero etiquette. She treated me like I was drunk or retarded asking me \"um, can you focus up here for a second\" and demanded I order immediately or gamble immediately, if I was going to sit at her (empty) bar..   After a short conversation during which I maintained a winning attitude and let her know I was going to sit and look over the menu and settle in before ordering, she bluntly and forcefully gave me a third option, the door. I gladly thanked her and gratefully exited this God awful bar..  I represent a lot of money, big tips, referrals, and a long term customer for those who get it right and offer personal and prompt service. Unfortunately the whole of the PT's brand lost (at least) one customer tonight. If there were an option for zero stars, I would pick that one because I'll never be their customer."}

{"text":"Where to start?  One and a half people working an entire bar and grill on a football sunday....table service early but we get ignored for the rest of the day...we wait at the bar for ever and place a food order...ask the half employee to put a game on and get a snarky 'after I put in the drink order!'  Dude finally comes over and puts all the same afternoon game on three tvs and not the one I requested..this place is absolutely horrible....if u like to order one drink and don't care about what game is on this place is awesome.  Nothing like having to wait and beg for drink and food and be given attitude...the woman behind the bar was doing the best she could but this dude in a Seahawks shirt is a dick....maybe our mistake for expecting what the website advertised."}
{"text":"Hated this place.  One and five star reviews are seldom. I don't use words like love or hate, but jeez the service, is awful."}
{"text":"I love this location but my bartender kept swearing a complaining about how the company treats her like crap.  Not what I want to hear when I'm putting money into your company.  Plus I felt like I was a bother when asking for a drink even though I've spent hundreds of dollars.  I'm disappointed.  I would love to have a happy bartender.  I've spent well over $500 tonight and my bartender is chatting with the kitchen staff not asking if I need anything.  She's on her phone not helping me. I'm not happy as a regular patron.  It's time for someone who cares.  And the profanity coming out of her mouth makes me sick."}
{"text":"First time here on a Saturday night 1/09/2015  And I will never go back ! Service was bad the ad who helped us seemed like she didn't wanna be there bitchy  additiued and the male that was also there didn't even ask if we needed help had to walk up to the bar and ask if we can get some service the food was okay fries were not cook all the way ! Second Sri KS tastes flat ! But nerve again will I go back wasn't even worth 30 $ on 2 chicken wing meals next time I'll stick to wing stop"}
{"text":"We were in search of some bar food, a beer, and a nice game of pool on our day off. We got exactly that at this nice little PT's on Monday evening. The waitress was sweet and professional. The food was spot on. The Perfect grilled cheese. My husband had the fish & chips which was great too. We didn't gamble this time but there must've been some action because we heard some ding dinging behind the bar. My only minor complaint would be that there are about a Dozen Photos of Half Naked Girls on the walls making the place feel like - I don't know - the inside of a boys bedroom! I got that uneasy feeling you get when you walk into your creepy neighbors house and he's got a trashy calendar on his wall and you feel kind of objectified and unsafe. Not surprisingly, there weren't any other women around gambling or eating or playing pool. My husband and I had a laugh about it. Overall, we still had a great time. Cold beer, tasty bar food, great service, and a few games of pool."}
{"text":"Best chicken wings I have ever had... I also love the fact that no matter which location you go too the food is consistent"}
{"text":"This is probably the best PT's in town. Consider yourself lucky if Kristen is your bartender/server. Good drinks, good music, good pay-outs. There's usually some kind of event or karaoke on weekends. The DJ's are usually pretty good and the patrons will surprise you with their singing abilities. The chef at this location (I think his name is Tony?) is great. He will serve the best chicken wings you've ever had. Ask for Kristen or Erin! Don't settle for any less!!!"}
{"text":"When i'm in town I hit up this  PT's. Close to home. Don't judge..It's in a not so great area but inside its super cute with a nice area to sit and relax. The bartenders are very nice. Not sure what the bald guy's name is, but he's great and always makes good drinks. Also I think her name is Amanda, she's also very cool and knows her stuff when it comes to making drinks. The best time to go is Happy Hour(4-7) I believe?, half off food and drinks. I am a fan of the pizza. thin and crispy and sauce is tasty."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite bar. Their happy hour was fantastic and I used to go all the time. After not going for a few weeks I went back last night and had the worst experience. It used to be that all of the beers were half off during happy hour. Now it's only Pt's brand beer. I mean things change and that wouldn't have been a big deal except for the guy who was bartending was incredibly rude. I had never seen him working there before maybe he is one of the floaters but he was awful. And when he made a mistake on the bill and I mentioned it to him he immediately took a condescending tone with me stating that he told us that the non Pts beers weren't on the happy hour special. It just so happens that it was a Pts beer. Maybe he was just having a bad night I don't really know but it wasn't appreciated.  Honestly I'm just really disappointed because I loved going here and this experience left a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"Your typical neighborhood bar: pool tables, sport channels, finger food and your favorite drinks. Friendly service and down to earth atmosphere. Happy hour from 5pm to 7pm, and 12am to 2am; 50% off domestic beers (not sure about other drinks), until recently it also included import beers, no longer the case unfortunately."}
{"text":"Dominick was extremely rude. Worst service I have ever received at any PTs ever. Took over 15 minutes for him to even acknowledge my group even though the woman he was flirting with across the bar pointed at us because he was so rudely ignoring us. I ordered a Stella and a shot and got a bud light instead. I ended up drinking it because even after walking around the bar multiple times to get his attention he still ignored me. We decided to leave because it was difficult to get a drink even though the bar wasn't busy at all. After trying to get his attention for MY check he slammed down a bill with my group's drinks, walked away, then ignored me for another 15 minutes while we tried to flag him down to split the check. The only decent part of this trip to PTs was the guy who brought me my fries, he was nice. Fuck Dominick, he's a dick."}
{"text":"Waht I'm about to write are not actually criticisms but observations. In a strange Vegas way, these things are the setting of a community environment to me.  When I first actually made plans to go in there, it was to talk to a potential roommate. She was a dispatch caller for one of those escort services. She asked me if it was okay if all the girls came around all hours for their \"assignments.\" Some of you are shrieking in horror, but think about it. For a guy, this would be immense drama, but would there ever be a better source of Vegas stories in your life? In retrospect, I should have taken her offer instead of moving in with a \"friend\" who wound up stealing a lot of shit from me after being his maid for 2 years.  I went back a couple of times after and thought this was a hooker bar. I noticed a lot of platinum blonds with bling, but the kinda bling that doesn't mark affluence but a trip to the swap meet. They seemed to get called into \"service\" halfway thru their burger. One even brought an old guy in who hobbled in with a cane, looks like he was spending the last of his money for a final fling situation.  The food there- and most PT's in the chain- are excellent. I had my first really good Monte Cristo there, which is sad because they have since removed it from the menu, damn recession. It's basic burger/ sandwich stuff on the menu. they have specials and their deal is they have 3 sizes of \"buckets\" that are filled with fries, mini burgers, poppers, etc. As I write this, happy hour is from 4-7 every evening where drafts and pizzas are half off. There's another happy hour and I have to guess, since I can't find my weekly. It may be midnight to 4:00AM. Call ahead or google it.  Oh, another group of people I noticed that the bartender commented on was cross dressers. There's a group that meets there regularly. In all honesty, I only have 2 problems with cross dressers: 1) Why the hell would you ever decide to wear high heels? Those things are unbearable (someone had shows that actually fit me and tried it ONCE, just to feel. No, I didn't go out like that or anything). 2) more of a question, I don't understand why cross dressers wear feathered out hair and as a group look like a bunch of 40 year olds in the 80's. Their clothes, and look, the dresses and jeans aren't from any other decade.  The bartenders are cute and the cook hangs out. We shoot the shi7. I also love their grilled chicken plate there, taco salad. I'm real easy, I actually prefer \"bar food\" over any of the \"4-5 star\" celebrity chef places on the strip. I've paid a fortune to have a server be snide with me and felt like the food was too froo froo, no substance."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a night away from the strip, this is the place to go. I had several hours to kill before my flight out of Vegas, and wanted to watch a football game. The service was great, the food was great, and the atmosphere was good if not a little depressing.  Close enough to the strip to be a close drive and far enough to not pay the crazy prices or have the tourist atmosphere, this place is a cant miss."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. You'd think this location would be busier with its proximity to UNLV and cater more to the campus community. Ive worked in campus for 8+ years and have only been here 3 times. Service is decent, unless they do get some business and overwhelm easily. It is waaay too dark at the bar. If it were brighter and livelier I think there'd be more return business. Pool, darts, great TVs. The issue may be that all PTs are run the same regardless of there location."}
{"text":"Real quiet PT's. Pretty dead when it comes to Billiards as well.   And you know a place is ghetto when you have to ring the doorbell to enter. LOL"}
{"text":"this place sucks! terrible customer service there was about 26 people there and only 1 bartender we were sitting on a table the bartender just put our drinks at the bar and made us get up walk all the way and get them ourselves plus not to mention had to wait at least 30 min to order a drink"}
{"text":"Sat at the video poker bar, was told by the bartender what was needed to get comped drinks, played that much (and then some)... bartender ended her shift, I got the bill.... none of the drinks were comped, and the new bartender said there was nothing he could do.   I'm pretty sure there are numerous other places in this city you can play VP and get comped drinks, so I don't see any reason to return."}
{"text":"They are next to unlv which is prime. They used to have better prices but as soon as the semester started they raised the prices. It's dead on a Sunday... This is ridiculously overpriced their \"special\" is a 23 ounce bud light."}
{"text":"Really laid back and nice dive bar. Their wings are AMAZING. best I have had in a very long time!!"}
{"text":"I like the PT's chain. They have good beer and bar food, they cater to locals, and prices are fair. I've never really had a bad PT's experience -- but I've never had a great one, either. So let me tell you about my last trip to a PT's, the one one Trop/Maryland in the University neighborhood.   I came here after the Runnin' Rebels game (Go Rebs!) as it's one of the closest bars to the Thomas and Mack. The place was cool, and there is clearly a lot of school spirit there. Our beers arrived nice and cold, and the $2 Coors deal was pretty good. My Jack and Coke was too weak for my taste, but that may be because I drink a lot. I ordered wings and fries to go along with my beer. The wings were nice and hot (temperature and spiciness) and the fries were good, too.   The reason I'm giving this place three stars instead of four or five? It's really, REALLY smokey in there. They could do a better job of clearing some of that out with some air recirculators or filters or something. Seriously, you walk out of there with the worst aroma ever. My clothes smelled like I lived inside a Marlboro carton.  Also, the weak drink really brought me down, too. Also a con, the men's room contained two urinals, a toilet, and a sink... all in a room that's about 25 square feet. You could imagine the situation...  Still, this'll be a place I might re-visit eventually, but not somewhere I'd be keen on bringing others. It's not cool."}
{"text":"So I work down the street from here, and live like 5 minutes away, too. Thus I come here simply out of convenience, and not because this place is awesome.   This PT's does not serve food like some of the other ones do. However, they're connected to a Don Tortaco (a Roberto's-type place) where you can order your food and they'll bring it to you inside the PTs. That's good in my book, because sometimes after a number of Corona's you need a taco or three.   The service at this PT's is ok, though nothing to write home about. They're always prompt with my drinks, and I don't think I've ever had to wait more than a few minutes to get my drink order taken --- no complaints there at all.   Ultimately, I come to this place when I need a drink after work. It's really convenient in that regard, and the service is ok, too. Do I recommend you come all the way out here to grab a beer? No, as there may be other equally cool PT's in your area to serve you."}
{"text":"I only started coming here because it's close to my parent's house, so I could walk to their house if I drank too much. That's never been the case, thankfully, but I still go there because it's a cool place.   The food is pretty good and quick and cheap, the beers are cold and they come to you quick, and the bartenders are cool dudes. It's a really cool neighborhood spot where you have a drink or two with friends, but not a Strip-type establishment where everything is ostentatious and pricey."}
{"text":"The thing with PT's is that they're all pretty much the same. They don't deviate too much from the standard formula of drinks, food, smoky environment, and mostly-blonde lady-bartenders.   This one actually doesn't serve food, which really sucks. I like getting chicken wings with my beers, but these guys send you to the Roberto's next door to get food. That kinda sucks bc Roberto's doesn't equal wings/burgers/bar food.   The drinks here are ok, though nothing to get excited about.   I'll prob return here, but mostly bc it's close to people's houses."}
{"text":"I should let you know that I have a very basic list of requirements in a bar: attractive lady bartenders, ice-cold beers, good service, low prices. THAT'S IT. I love having a million tv's all over the place, but that seems like an extra perk to me. Having said that.... I love PT's.  This particular location is semi-close to work, so sometimes we drop in to grab a drink after work. I only ever get a beer or two before heading out for other things, so I cannot complain too much about prices or anything like that. However, I showed up last Sat at like 5pm with a buddy, and all drinks were half-priced with their loyalty card. We had a lot of Jack and Coke's for like $30, which was a great deal. I was totally happy with the price, the drinks flowed well, and the lady bartender was hot. Happy camper, right?   Mostly. At first, they were quick to keep giving us new drinks. Towards the end, they tapered off really quick. I could've totally had another drink had they offered, but I sobered up and realized the best thing would be for me to stop.   Still, I'll be back."}
{"text":"Was not impressed...karaoke was more dancing than singing. The place was very smokey. The bartenders weren't very friendly or personable. We had to chase them down and even then they weren't trying to provide good service. I would not recommend this place. Sorry, you failed to entertain."}
{"text":"Right Across the street from UNLV. and theres NEVER any Girls or Action there. Food Is Good. Experience Is Weak"}
{"text":"Okay, so to keep it short and simple. I waited over 30-40 minutes for a pizza. An employee brings it over and says, \"sorry for the wait.. i thought i had closed the oven and the temperature wasn't where it was supposed to be at..\" This pizza was uncooked, the crust was white.. Horrible experience, the bartender knew we didn't like it and didn't even offer a discount or to make another one. All he did was joke about \"yelling at the cook\".. yeah never again will i come to this location."}
{"text":"Good place to enjoy a beer and play pool. the location in Lake mead and rampart does not have a full kitchen open so if you are hungry you have to order from Roberto Tacos which is next door- A bit  inconvenient."}
{"text":"The bartender Lacy is awesome :) very attentive and she definitely knows how to do her job. This is one of the busiest PT's I've been to in Vegas, this place is super packed, not a single bar stool or table available. It's a nice little place, the happy hour is always great at PT's, and I like that this is a Rebels Bar. It's close to my house and the staff is really nice. Even though for how busy it is I think they should have 2-3 bartenders/servers at a time. Other then that It's a fun little bar to go have a drink at and grab some wings during happy hour."}
{"text":"I've been to a few PT's, but this one is my go to spot. Always a good crowd, never crowded, and the bartender Mark is always there to take care of you. Can't complain at all."}
{"text":"No reason to go here when you have places like Black Mountain Grill, Shakespeare's, Village Pub, Hooters,and even 052.  At least the bar tenders take care of you there....this place used to be OK back in day.....now.....it's like \"hey money or GTFO!"}
{"text":"Very clean, comfortable bar. Great food and the day bartender Melissa is a lot of fun. Kinda hidden in the plaza but worth looking for."}
{"text":"It was OK. I wasn't scared or threatened, but I also didn't have that instant thought after you sit down with your first drink , \"wow, I need to come here more often.\" My husband and I sat on a couch and watched the local news. Someone at the bar was eating nachos and they looked good. That's about it."}
{"text":"I haven't walked into a place where all I get is a nod for a hello and an eyebrow for what do u want to drink, but I did today!!!   Sorry I  don't speak bad bartender Ryan.  Thats what I overheard his name was,  he didn't introduce himself.  Other than my crappy service my food was delish!  The lady that brought me my food was awesome, brought me my sides right away.  It took me 7 minutes to get my check...and that's 7 minutes of me trying to flag him down when he wasn't but 5 ft in front of me.  Since there a lot of pts in las Vegas, I'll just drive down the street and hit up another .....sahara and nellis is not the one to go to"}
{"text":"Locals seem to be the norms (Norms lol) of this place. Bartenders and patrons seem to be close to each other. When I arrived, I was greeted promptly with a smile from Bree (who is also the manager). She served us right away and we began our night. Throughout the night we juggled some loose machines and won a lucrative share. Yay! Bree was there to make us feel special throughout our first PT experience. We were skeptical at first but now our minds are at ease and made up. If you're in the neighborhood, stop by. Guys, it's a fun time!"}
{"text":"I had a great experience here when stopping in for a drink and to play some video poker. The bartender was awesome! He was very attentive and did well making the drinks. The gambling was actually loose for a PT's. I was able to play for a while and win some money. The juke box had a great variety on music to suit our drinking habits lol"}
{"text":"This is a really nice PT's! It's very large inside, and nicely decorated. The boneless wings here are a very good choice. I also like that they have tater tots as a side, that's not a common find.  There are also a lot of video poker machines at this location."}
{"text":"Fun little local bar for a quick drink or night cap. They have a lot of video poker machines and pool tables. They also serve Roberto's food when it's open."}
{"text":"Great breakfast and lunch spot Saturday-Wednesday! Go visit Sharon and she will take care of you! Friendly bartenders and great food! A lot of regulars making a comfrotable, \"family\" feel to a 21+ bar."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Every time I come here I'm greeted with a huge smile. Don't really come here to drink, mainly for the best coffee west of the Mississippi AND the breakfast specials. Always cooked to perfection. Also doesn't hurt that football season is starting and while other places get too loud and packed, this place stays a controlled kind of crazy. You can cheer with the crowd and at the same time hold a conversation with your friends. Friendly staff and fast service and great drinks/food, this place is a win! Also Jen makes this place a wonderful experience. Nothing but good vibes and smiles here."}
{"text":"Not the best bar, but bartenders were super nice and hooked it up :)"}
{"text":"Pretty chill bar when I came here with my coworkers after work. It was on a Tuesday night so it was not that busy.   When you walk in it is pretty dim but, it was a solid setting. Happy hour was from 12AM-2AM so we came at a perfect time to order a few drinks for cheap.   The bartender was genuinely friendly and offered some groovy suggestions on what to drink based off what drinks you like.   Pretty spacious bar with lots of video poker at the bar area. I did not really walk around the place but it seems like a neat place to chill.   Overall really respectable bar to chill with a couple buddies and the drinks were great!"}
{"text":"Next time i come to vegas ill stop by .hopefully im still not 86 from here i use to love this place"}
{"text":"First of all this is one of the few pts with shuffleboard so that's a win and also Becky and Steve are awesome. Definitely will be a regular here :)"}
{"text":"Went there last night just to play a round of pool. The guy seemed like pissy right when we got there, but just thought cause it was already late. But as the night progressed his attitude didn't seem to change. It seemed like I was bothering him cause he was hanging out with some friends. Like excuse me?! Anyways. Besides his service I love pts, doesn't matter which. I just like the happy hour and the pool tables. I hope I don't get him again next time I go back. But what can you do. I'll still come back, it's literally right down the street."}
{"text":"If i could give this place negative stars i would. The only reason i am giving them one star is because YELP is making me.    Absolutely the worse service I've had the misfortune of experiencing. I am guessing that management or whoever runs his bar doesnt read these reviews because Shannon is the glaring problem with thos bar. The reviews are in, and they need to let her go. Maybe because she has massive breats that they keep her here. But i came to rhis bar for beer burgrs and the game and i didnt get any of that. The nba playo#s were on and i asjed for her to turn the channel from the silently playing FOX news to the game. She didnt. What she did do was walk around the bar with the remote and who knows what else shoved i  her cleavage as if she wee smuggling it thru immigtation. I am sure at some point everything in this bar has made ita way on there.   She didnt greet us when we came in. There were maybe 8 other patrons in the bar when we came in. A couple walked in before us. They had their drinks and were well into their evening before she even made it over to me.  It took her 10 minutes to even start pouring our beers, and when she got to mine the keg ran out half way through the pour. She said for me to \"start\" with that one implying that once the keg was changed over.id be geting topped up or at least a new beer. Well when the keg dinally was changed she poured a beer and took it over......to a guy who had just walked in. I never got my beer.  We ordered food. Yes I  know, we should have left by that juncture, but we were hungry.  We were already there and just wanted some food after work. It took us 15 mins to have someone take our order, and when we finally did they took 2 of our orders and left before our 3rd friend could order. It was so rude that we thought it was a joke....it wasn't, and nobody found it remotely humorous.   We asked for place settings from the woman who brought our fod as well as the bartender. They never came. After about 5 mins i walked to the other side of the bar where she had been hiding. I asked again for place settings for our now cold food. She glanced up at me, said nothing, then looked back down at the computer screen that she was smooshing numbers into. Finally after a few minutes waiting i just reached over the bar to grab them.for myself. She came over and snapped, \"I was going to get those.\" Yeah, sure like our beers, food, orders, or any form acceptable service.  Never, ever, ever would I even think of setting foot in that place. And they will never see another dollar from.me. and i suggest that you boycott this place as well until they let Susana go and change the serving culture of this bar. Our dollars are our voices.  Use them.to speak to the owners that this is UNACCEPTABLE   I'm writing this on my phone and im not going to bother to spell check it. ...thats how little effort inwas shown, right back atcha."}
{"text":"Bars don't really have to do much to capture a decent review from me, specially in Vegas where they have gaming. I've been here before several times for some late night pizza and nothing stood out nor got under my skin. Last night was by far the worst experience of my life at any bar. My buddy was going to a bank to get some gambling cash so asked me to order him some beer and get us a pizza. I sit down, put a twenty in the machine and started to order; this is the beginning of the nightmare experience... I order his beers and myself a bud light response: \"I can't comp you a large beer and your friend can order his own beers.\" Ok fine he's irritated about something, understandable. Next question, \"well can I please get a chicken bbq pizza?\" Without missing a beat, \"$9 how do you plan on paying for that!?\" I haven't even played a hand yet and if he gathered to look at my card,  he would have seen that I go to pts a lot. My buddy comes in and before I can even tell him about why he didn't get his beers the bartender does the exact same thing even though I had an open tab. If that wasn't bad enough he had an attitude the entire night and was often found sitting down before I can place order. Never again will I go here because of that experience.1 star is being generous."}
{"text":"Used to come here a few years ago and recently brought my girlfriend in to watch the fight. Bartender was by herself at the start of a Saturday evening. When she got around to us she didn't introduce herself and was very matter of fact. Didn't bother to acknowledge that my gf requested her drink a certain way and brought without the requested change. Slow to service but she was by herself with at least 12 people at the bar and half as many playing pool or sitting away from the bar. Was never asked if we'd care to see a menu. After dropping $60 in about 30 mins in the machines was told 1 Bloody Mary and 2 drafts beers wouldn't be comped because we weren't playing max bet. Slow service, tight machines, unfriendly attitude and not much appreciation for locals was enough to get us and other people that came in to leave. Got the feeling the bartender was unhappy and that our business was not appreciated. Funny thing is we would have stayed another 2 hours and played a lot more if there had been just a hint of appreciation by showing a smile or taking a minute to make an introduction. Too many other options for me to ever consider going back."}
{"text":"Located next to Naked Fish... This place was packed when we came on a Sunday around 2 AM~!!! But even so the bartender said we had just missed the happy hour rush so I guess it gets pretty freakin crazy.. It looks like your standard PTs nothing fancy.. I did notice they had some karaoke going on.. Which could be a good or bad thing LOL  The 2 stars are because even with how crazy busy it was there were only 2 bartenders.. Really NICE bartenders but c'mon really?!!!! It took forever to get some drinks & I didn't even see any servers for the tables or maybe they were just to busy to come to ours?   So yea... Other than the staffing issue.. I would say this place could be a good time! I bet a lot of fights happen here though it seemed like it was filled with a very lively rowdy bunch of people... Myself included HAHA   Funniest part of the night was seeing the older Naked Fish server drunk at the bar & hearing her tell the bartender how handsome he is.. LOL ...  My FAVORITE PTs is still Buffalo & 215 ;)))"}
{"text":"24/7 Local video poker sports bar, everything you'd expect. It seems like I'm always just stopping in for a cheap breakfast, the Pt's Platter is way better than its Ihop and Denny's counterparts and the waitresses are much friendlier. Unfortunately, I always get sucked into the video poker machines and end up leaving with a full tummy and an empty wallet."}
{"text":"Shannon was absolutely amazing ! I came in after class just needed a beer Shannon was so knowledgeable and showed me the new loves of my life PTs Sean Irish Red. I'm so thankful for the hospitality and new knowledge! Thank you!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I don't normally hang out in this part of town but this has been my favorite PTS so far thanks to the bartenders Rick and Aaron.. Bartenders can make or break an experience these guys  truly made the experience really memorable .. this area has a reputation and I realize why some people might be scared to come here due to where it's located .. thankfully the guys behind the bar watch out for their customers which I got to witness first hand but also made sure my drinks were always full and we had yummy food..  PTS has an awesome happy hour but a variety of drinks to boot but for me the biggest take away was how safe I felt when someone was causing trouble for me in my female only group of people Rick made sure I was safe and didn't tolerate disrespect and it made all the difference  I definitely am Grateful for the delicious 50% off pizza and the friendly bartenders both Rick with his smile and Aaron with his dimples this Friday night!"}
{"text":"I wouldn't gamble on their food it was horrible the nachos were just disgusting the steak look like little rat turds for extra $7 that was a waste I will not return to this place due to the fact that it took me 30 minutes to get nachos and there was nobody else eating"}
{"text":"This review is actually for my visits to the Horizon Ridge/Horizon Drive location, I couldn't find a Yelp listing for it.  PTs has been serving the Vegas Valley since 1982. This hometown bar/restaurant has been consistently popular ever since, and tons of properties have popped up all across the area.   First and foremost, I have to say I am surprised at the atmosphere of this place. It is quite elaborately decorated, plus there are TVs all over the wall so that you can watch newscasts and sporting events alike. Perhaps the best thing about this place is that they have a huge, enclosing glass wall, complete with door, separating the restaurant from the bar area. That is an ingenious idea, and I wish more restaurants would follow their example.   The menu is larger and more diverse than you would expect. The place carries tons of dishes, including a number of monthly \"special\" items. I have tried numerous entrees here, and don't really recall ever eating something I didn't like. The Mardi Gras Chicken Breast is to die for, and the Zookie (a fresh-baked cookie piled up with ice cream and chocolate syrup) is simply amazing.  However, I was VERY disappointed to see that the place doesn't carry shakes. Given their ice cream-based desert items, I don't see how much harder it would be to make these.   If such great food items and good, separated atmosphere, then why only a 3-star rating? Two main reasons:  1) Even when the place is practically dead, the table tops are always dirty. It's pretty sad when I have to come in with my family to eat and choose the \"least dirty\" booth to sit in.   2) The service is VERY SLOW. There are friendly employees here who recognize us when we visit, and I appreciate that. But they just aren't around enough - don't know if this is a staffing issue or what. When my dad asks me to go to the bar to get him another beer because the server is taking too long, that's the first sign that the service is too slow.  PT's has good food and a better atmosphere than you would expect. I only wish the service and restaurant cleanliness were up to snuff. If you want a quick dining experience with decent food, though, you've come to the right place.  UPDATE: My opinion of this place has gone down severely for two reasons:  1) They have taken all soup off their menu. You've got to be kidding. I get sick and tired of seeing places do this, and now PTs can be added to that list.  2) Happy hour ends at 7. We got there at least 5 minutes before 7, and the server didn't get to us until after 7 because they are all incompetent and slow. And they REFUSED TO HONOR HAPPY HOUR, even though WE WERE THERE ON TIME. The server said some BS about the computer changing after 7. If that's the problem, just ring up every other drink! It isn't rocket science!"}
{"text":"Me and my wife use to come here but a couple of the bartenders were not great, we decided to come back here tonight, Alex was our bartender, you can't miss his big beard, he was fantastic l, very attentive warm and welcoming"}
{"text":"As a local I've been to a lot of pt's and this one stuck out and not in a good way. I think this pts has the grossest bathrooms of all the land. Maybe I came in on a non cleaning bathroom day? But there were things/fluids/bugs caked on the stall. The pig tailed bartender was not as bad as the bathroom but did have some attitude. She did get our drink order right away gave us menus and left to be on her phone and ignore her customers for a good ten minutes(?) Then she was ready to take our food order.  My boyfriend and I planned on grabbing a drink and app but I thought twice, due to the bathroom/bartender situation. But he was really hungry so he convinced me to get the nachos with him. They have cheese sauce which is the only way I like my nachos and it was a huge plate, so this was a win. Very tasty nachos and cold beers. I would do all this again but not at this Pts."}
{"text":"I didn't even know there was another PT locations as this is the only one I have been too. I've been here 3 or 4 times from my trips to Vegas and it is a great pub to grab some food, drink some brews, play pool or just chill. The bartender is awesome and the drinks are super cheap during happy hour.   When I came here on my recent trip, we had a huge party who didn't want to go clubbing and just wanted to chill and relax. This pub is spacious, still has game machines for the gamblers, and the service is awesome. We had ordered 3 pizzas, and 2 chilli tots, the server accidently gave up 2 chilli cheese fries, we told him about the mistake, his quick response was, \"sorry about that, would you like me to make you chilli tots for you?\" At no additional cost, he gave us the fries still and with a quick response like, that honestly gets an A+ in my books. So we ended up with 3 pizzas, 2 chilli cheese fries and some chilli cheese tots.  They also got shuffleboard."}
{"text":"Went searching for a PT/Sierra Gold near the strip for some late night grub with a buddy a few weeks ago. Almost didn't see this place due to construction blocking alot of that area. I couldn't quite put a finger on it. Best I can explain it is the place had sort of an outdated look, or hadn't been renovated in quite awhile. The bartender was the only person out on the floor. I was surprised it's not very busy for a place so close to the strip but I guess it isn't being it was a weekday night. We got our drinks and ordered my usual gilroy pizza since it was happy hour. It is worth noting that their gilroy here did not include salami or artichokes. The couple other PT/SG I've been to usually has those ingredients on the gilroy. Also, the pizza was slightly undercooked. Instead of the normal cracker thin crust, it was floppy. I'm used to just right to slightly overdone crusts. This visit to a different PT/SG was by no means horrible but it wasn't great either. Service was decent and it did satisfy our late night hunger. Although I might try to find another location next time when wanting my gilroy fix near the strip."}
{"text":"When I am in N. Vegas I usually make it a point to stop into PT's for a good breakfast and some fun gaming. Go visit Sharon and she will take care of you! She brings in a great crowd of regulars making a this place feel like a fun welcoming hangout spot."}
{"text":"Came in for breakfast 25.00 later the food waa nasty and you could not even taste the vodka in the bloody mary. The blond was unattentive saw I did not even touch my food. When I said something she said next time have t cooked longer."}
{"text":"Worst service ever.  Standed and waited for 30 min without ordering any drinks and walked out.  Management here is awful.  Workers understaffed working hard but people waking out left and right.  Owner should be furious - killing current business and future business"}
{"text":"I know some people don't like pts but this particular one is the best bar in town. The bartenders Lindsay and Erin and Mike are some of the best people you will ever meet. The service is always great and they're always in a good mood and make you feel welcome."}
{"text":"horrible food, horrible customer serivce, & horrible drinks. this place is a waste of space!!  i wish i could give them a half of a star!!"}
{"text":"Fucka this placa Jennifer and whoever the other dumb bartender who's name I didn't catch, I hate you.  I used to come to this place every so often about a year ago, and I was given a rude reminder as to why i had stopped. The security guard let us in around 8 pm and we took a seat at the tables right off to the side of the bar. The bartender was sitting across the bar smoking and no one else was to be seen. We see the waitress come out and give her a few minutes to spot us, but to no avail. About 5 minutes we get up to move, getting the hint, and the security guard comes over to tell us there is no server (on a Friday night?) and we should sit at the bar. Way ahead of you bud, but seems like the armed security guard has more customer service than the two bozos at the bar.  Magically we are noticed and the waitress tries to chat us up, I politely tell her to fuck off (I worded it civilly of course) and put in our food order. Towards the end of our meal was the end of the dumb bimbo's shift, but she didn't bother letting us know she was leaving and that we should get the attention of the other bartender if we needed anything else, like most normal people would do (maybe explains why she's just a waitress?). Probably cause she knew we hated her and she wasn't getting a tip anyway.  This guy must be afraid of eye contact or something, cause I pretty much got the whole freaking bar's attention besides his. People even tried helping us wave him over. No avail. Took us over an hour and a half to get out of this dump, gotten out of a sit-down meal at a real restaurant faster. After getting fed up I finally walked over and waved my hand in his face and demanded my check.   I don't ask for much when coming to run down bars, but really. The bar. It has corners. Look over to them."}
{"text":"I always come here after a shitty day at school to drink my life away.  The environment is very nice, very typical neighborhood bar theme, and the drinks are cheap. There's the occasional asshat of a customer that always tries to talk to me, and I have to tell them to go hang themselves to get them away from me, but I don't really blame the bar for that. It is a bar afterall.  Food is a little on the expensive side, depending on what you get. Particularly the chicken buckets, but it still tastes good.   Bartenders are friendly, Teresa the waitress is hilarious, and overall the place is mostly empty. When I go in there anways."}
{"text":"Very rude bartender!!! Went to Pts and was treated badly by a bartender named ANGEL!! First, We asked for suggestion on drinks and her response was \"I don't know you, so I don't know what to recommend\" and also we've been playing the machine and she didn't comp any of our drink! She said \"you're not playing enough so no free drinks!\" After putting more than $80!! She even told us that we're the one who's rude!!"}
{"text":"Bartender making out with client at bar and when he starts smoking we move the client starts making comments to us.  Never will return pull camera videos"}
{"text":"I'm guessing the four star rating is because this is a great place to go for a drink in between making batches of meth.   For anything else I don't see the appeal. There was one bartender/server and one person in the kitchen on Saturday afternoon and it took two hours to get any food. The bartender/server was slurring her words and took orders three different times and still didn't get it right.  Food was ok but not anything special or fresh and not worth the wait. There was \"something wrong\" with the Blue Moon keg.   While you are waiting you get to experience the wonderful clientele and have your clothes absorb the ash tray smell of the inside.   At least it's cheap and if you are lucky at the slot machines inside you can pay for your food/drinks."}
{"text":"Love this bar! Great happy hour, wonderful personable service, and great music selection. Perfect locals bar to visit for a cold beer on a hot day."}
{"text":"I have to admit I was hesitant to return to this location but I'm glad I did. Tuesday nights Troy is there and by far the best bartender I have met in the city. Attentive and drinks are amazing. He even has his own menu of drinks and all I've tried have been great! I only come here when Troy is there because of his experience as a bar tender and customer service. Don't get me wrong the other nights are great too but I come only Tuesday nights. Try his cherry cheesecake drink, awesome!"}
{"text":"What the hell can I say about this place ? It's great for locals! Mindy is a terrible bar tender she always remembers me even tho I only come in once every six months also she's remembers my drink of choice. ( please note the sarcastic tone) she's great most of the people that work here are great. I don't think I've had a bad experience here so far in the two years I've been coming ! So give this whole in the wall for a PTs place a good shot!"}
{"text":"The coustomer service from the bartenders not good they don't transmit a good vibe i don't know because I'm mexican one day i went there and they didn't accept my consular id and i had money so i guess is the owner rules so my overall my complain is the owner is a racist and the pizza they sale there is bad like really bad if you buy one from the frozen section in the store is ten thousand times better because that's what they do don't think u get a fresh pizza that shit is frozen they just microwave or somthing beacause you can notice right away for anyone or latinos out there pts pub are RACIST I WOULD NEVER GO THERE AGAIN !!!!! FTP"}
{"text":"Of all the PT's scattered about Vegas, I really think this is one of the nicest ones. It's clean, comfy, and there are a gazillion pool tables, all pretty well-maintained. The menu is pretty large, consisting of all sorts of anything fried, sandwiches, burgers, and wraps. I've never really gone to a PT's specifically to eat, but it's happened a handful of times that I've been in a condition where food has become necessary. The chicken Caesar wrap is pretty good, but it's packed full of croutons, which can make for quite a mess in your lap. And of your grill. The prices are reasonable, service is always friendly, and there's a juke box. I couldn't ask for anything more.  If you make it in before midnight, say hi to Bubba. You can't miss him -- he's comparable to The Fridge. Sweet as can be, though. He'll take care of ya."}
{"text":"I had sworn off PTs after playing some slots at the bar at one and having the server tell me I had to play max bet in order to get free drinks. What? What locals bar has that rule? Well one opened near my house so I decided to try it for football and hoped maybe my last experience was just one bad manager. I was wrong.  This location use to be an Irish bar. They did a nice job setting it up. Good seating options, lots of TVs. And like all PTs the food and beer prices are good during games. For those two reasons I give it 2 stars. But yet again I was charged for drinks even though I was gaming at 40 cents a bet. The bartender didn't even say anything about it. It would be a good place to watch games but I won't go there if I get charged for drinks. Way too many other options in this town that don't do that."}
{"text":"Day shift is the best. If you need a beer or want to play for a while, day shift bartender Fatia will totally take care of you. She is bomb. Leave her a good toke, because she is the best."}
{"text":"Went here last night and ordered a 10pc lemon pepper chicken wings to go and they were horrible! I always order them but they must have had a new cook because I couldn't even eat them. They were covered with an enormous amount of lemon pepper salt. Too salty to even eat! I won't be going here again. A waist of $$"}
{"text":"This place smells SO bad.  The smell of cigarette smoke nearly takes your breath away!  We came in on karaoke night.  The place was packed and the karaoke options were not bad at all.   It took some time before the waitress took our order.  She was very friendly and the drink tastes good. I didn't like that the drinks were being served in large plastic cups.  Were the being lazy and didn't want to wash glasses or were they out?  Were they expecting some bat fight?  I don't know but I don't expect to come to a local bar to be drinking out of a plastic cup.  I do have to say they have some killer happy hour prices late at night.  We ordered one beer and one vodka cocktail.  Total price for both was under $8!  That's a steal!  There was food being ordered and didn't look all that appealing to me but since we didn't eat here I can't say if it was any good.  Had to wash all our clothes and rinse off after our night of bar hopping as we smelled of old stale smoke:("}
{"text":"This is probably my all time favorite bar since relocating to vegas....it's not because of the music or decor, or the big screens or cozy atmosphere. What makes a great establishment is the staff and patrons. Since the first early morning I walked in a bartender named Candace made me comfortable, at ease and ready to grow another long term patron in me. She is funny, professional and knows the perfect balance of checking on me and my needs. Over the years I have watched her with many other patrons and find that she offers the same upstanding service to them. On a few occasions I have witnessed situations with unruly people. She handled them professionally and swiftly as an experienced bartender should. That's when I realized a bartenders true job is to continue to offer the style of atmosphere in which her established long term patrons are accustomed too and grow that base. It's not to allow disrespectful, scamming, free willing antagonist to disrupt everyone else's good time. I hope Pts on lake mead and rampart will be around for years to come! They r a true beating heart for the locals of Las Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"Made a mistake and tried going again just for a drink because it is so close to our house. We waited over ten minutes and did not see one bartender, waitress or even a cook!  People were walking out. This PTS is a joke.  People were sitting there waiting for service and to pay. No one ever came out onto the floor. The bar was unattended for the ten minutes we waited and the guy next to us said it had been awhile since anyone was ever seen."}
{"text":"One of my favorite local bars. The bartenders are always friendly at this location and there are a lot of regulars here. My favorite spot for happy hour. Never too crazy or crowded when I go"}
{"text":"\"Why review P.T.'s?\"  My reply......\"It's a Vegas staple.\"  Honestly, these day's P.T.'s is like Starbucks, there's one on every corner. It's the place you go when you wanna get a casual beer down the street from your house.  Or the place to watch the game without the hassle of going to a sports book on the strip.  It's Cheers, but in Vegas.  The Sahara location was right behind my apartment, I could hop the wall and be there in seconds.  Honestly, when you just wanna hang out and let it all hang out this is the place....easy.  Ain't nothing wrong with a giant iced and frothy mug of anything on tap.  Why be picky at a P.T.'s.  SO....you don't wanna wait in line after getting all dressed up to go to a club?  You don't wanna go to a sports bar buried in a casino?  Look out your door and I bet there's a P.T.'s Pub within spitting distance.  See you there."}
{"text":"First time I had their house made beer. Horizon Ale,  light crisp fresh beer. Hint of hope and malt, light in color.  Great deal on the bucket of chicken wings with 3 flavors. It was much cheaper than getting 3 orders for the 3 of us. We'll worth it and will come come back for this deal when craving boneless wings."}
{"text":"Food was good. Service was average. Problem was the music and other customers (one guy) proving he knew every voice genuflection EVERY artist was going for when he/she recorded the album. That AND tight machines will make this my 1st ever NEVER GO BACK WINNER of 2017...NEVER AGAIN"}
{"text":"I love this PTs. It is hidden in the corner of a little run down strip mall.  It's completely cute, cozy, and clean inside. There were several large screens playing various sporting events. This PTs wasn't smokey at all.  The bartender, Melissa, was very welcoming and was really fun to talk to. She had reggae playing and it set a very chill vibe for the place. And gentlemen, she's beautiful.  My sister and I split a pile of nachos. They were huge and tasty. We ordered a brownie Sunday for dessert. It's a warm freshly baked brownie with a scoop of ice cream on top. It was heavenly.  This is my new favorite PTs. There are two pool tables, darts, and video poker machines. I will be back."}
{"text":"Great Bar. I guess some other PT's dont serve food. Well this one does. I went with the cheesesteak with whiz and fries. Both are delicious and the best Ive had outside of philly. They play Broncos games so im happy. Lots of seating at the bar, and tables and couch seating. Your only a stranger once here, and the other bar patrons are very friendly. Good happy hour specials and The Frosted mugs. I shall be here each time my Broncos Play. :) And try the Zookie."}
{"text":"I feel like PT's is one of those places where no matter which location you go to, you're most likely getting these three things: an unfriendly bartender, watered down drinks, and low quality food.  What keeps everyone coming back to a PT's are the cheap drinks and mediocre bar food. Here's a tip, though: just stick to the pitchers because the mixed drinks suck. The only good thing about it is that they have happy hour, but it's from Midnight - 2 AM. Come if you don't want to spend your dough on the swankier bars of the strip.   Other than the cheap booze, there's really nothing special about this place."}
{"text":"Came here to meet someone (blind date) and I felt very comfortable with the atmosphere. The bartenders that were serving us were friendly, kind, and sweet. The music playing in the background was awesome. Ordered the steak quesadilla which was delicious. We had such a great time we were there from 9pm to 2:30am! Nothing like enjoying a cigarette with your drinks and being able to converse with someone without feeling annoyed, uncomfortable, etc. What was great was the fact that it was close by to our homes. All in all, I had a great experience and look forward to coming back. Thank you"}
{"text":"This is my favorite neighborhood bar. I have been coming here for over 15 years. The staff is always fun and upbeat. It keeps me coming back.."}
{"text":"Absolutely disappointed by their food and customer service.   A bar should have two important things other than liquor; good service and decent food. Missing all three at this location.   The coleslaw in a small ranch container was a joke and the burnt fried fish was nothing but bites of oil.   The burnt fries tasted like the burnt fish :("}
{"text":"One of the worst bars in vegas, unless you are a supper friend of the bartender. You are not wellcome here."}
{"text":"We came in to play for awhile and have a few drinks. Alicia was amazing! She  was friendly, suggested a tasty drink to try and made us feel at home. We will defiantly be coming to visit Alicia again! What a great bartender."}
{"text":"Again, I have had friends come into town to hang out and we hit a few local joints to drink and hangout.  PT's is close to home and we were sick of the Casino bars.  But, to be honest, after awhile, all bars look the same.  But, it's not really about the place you are drinking but, who you're drinking with.    PT's is a chain but, that doesn't matter to me.  A Jack & Coke tastes the same here as it does at the touristy bars, but it's cheaper.  Anyhow, we just sat around and reveled in stories from our past.  The bartender took care of us and was ready for more drinks when we needed / wanted it.  Everything was clean, a ton of T.V.'s which would probably mean that watching the Superbowl here would be fun.  I have no complaints...  Some may say, that this isn't the best part of town, but who cares.  Lock your doors on your car and turn the alarm on, and you'll be fine."}
{"text":"Yes!!  I found it.  The shittiest PT's in Las Vegas!  The search is finally over.  What a relief.    I come here a few Sundays a year because for some ridiculous reason, there are no New England Patriots bars in town and a bunch of fans congregate here for the games.  Those people make it fun, but I'd definitely go more often if the venue were better.      You might say \"I've been to several shitty PT's.  How bad could it be?\"  First, they're regularly out of most beers.  I'm not talking Sam Adams seasonal; I'm talkin Miller fuckin Lite.    Here's a typical conversation:  Me: I'll have a Guinness.  Bartender:  We're out.  Me:   Stella?  Bartender:  Out.  Me: Horse urine?  Bartender:  Coors Light is all we have on tap right now.  Me: OK.  Give me the large.  How does the biggest chain of bars in Clark County forget to stock basic things like domestic beer?  Does the delivery person accidentally bypass this specific location??  I wouldn't blame them.  It has been open for well over a year, yet they still sport red and white vinyl signage.  I could imagine the corporate meeting regarding this bar: \"If it becomes profitable, we should put a white van in the parking lot and have it say 'BAR' with an arrow pointing left to increase exposure.\"  Then there's the food.  Pizza is 50% off during happy hour.  After ordering, the bartender (on her own free will) said \"It's pretty good unless you're snooty about pizza or from the east coast.\"  Well, gollygeekickmeinthenutswhiz, how could I not be pumped up now??  Upon first bite, safe to say it was pizza like none I'd had before.  It was a disgrace.  When the cook gets an order for this barely edible disc, the recipe card probably says:  1. Get cardboard  2. Add \"canned red sauce\", \"pepperoni product\" and \"cheese product\" 3. No need to heat 4. Serve  If that weren't enough, people can smoke to their dying heart's content here.  I've seen patrons leave the bar by halftime since it got so goddamn smoky.  Not sure why this is allowed.  Marge Simpson's sisters would give this place 5 stars."}
{"text":"It's PTs, people, don't come here expecting great food!   Come here for the cheap drinks and the excellent service. The bartender, Amanda, is a sweetheart and starts pouring my usual drink as soon as she sees my face walking through the door.   I think all these 1 & 2 star reviewers need to calm down a bit."}
{"text":"Sad to report, but I've changed my mind about this PT's.  The bartender (didn't get her name and was a little afraid to ask) is a Comp Nazi, insisting that you play video poker non-stop and at lightning speed in order to get a lousy shaker pint glass of Stone IPA. Boo! Heaven forbid you take a few seconds to look up at the TVs to watch a little basketball.  God help you if you take time out to enjoy your dinner.  No, no, no! Keep hitting those video poker buttons! Or NO BEER FOR YOU!!!!   P.S. Generous tips (I put a fiver in the glass before I even sat down) make no difference."}
{"text":"So I am so sad I have to update my review and give only one star, hopefull the quality of service went down because of the bartender and not the company as a whole.   So my bf, his sister and her friend headed to PT's on Sahara after hitting up a couple of other place. The place was semi empty we found some seats at the back of the bar. One of my friends orders a strong, fruity drink and I order a bloody mary. Well my friend can't tast or smell any alcohol and asks the bartender if he forgot to put it in. He said there is only strong and only fruity, both cannot exist together. The fruity will always hide the liquor. Well after I sipped my bloody mary I realized the bartender was full of crap. My bloody mary tasted like cold tomato juice, no alcohol and no spice. It appears that the bartender doesn't know how to make a drink or just is stingy with the alcohol and has to make some bull answer up, so we paid for the crap drinks and left. I wish I had gotten his name, but he worked 05/22/10 late shift around 12 or 1 am. Please make a not of it."}
{"text":"So disappointed. So I went to PT's Place on 05/22/10 after having a bad experience at Pt's pub on sahara. We literally left sahara and came to this location. We have been here before and never had a problem. This night was busy, but I mean not anything that a bartender can't handle. We sat there for I don't know how long without any recognition, the bartend came to our side of the bar and never asked us if we needed anything even though there was 4 of us and 1 soda in front of us that didn't even belong there. After a good 10 or so minutes, probably longer, we decided to leave. Strike 2 Pt's we used to love you."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 starts I would. Literally left infuriated and usually PTs is my spot, but I'll never come back to this one. No wonder it was empty. The little african american waitress/barback was the rudest person I've ever dealt with. How do you make any money if you're working for tips? She messed up my order, and then gave me a crazy, sideways attitude about it when I nicely, while apologizing (for her mistake), informed her that the order was wrong. Then, 5-10 minutes later, she came out and snapped at me across the bar and said \"it's going to be another 15 minutes\". Then, when I finally got my food and just decided to leave, she only gives me 4 tiny to-go boxes and no cups for wing sauce (the sauce I apparently paid $9 for, despite ordering $25 worth of wings). I thought blonde bartender was sweet, she even gave me a few free drink vouchers... Then I saw my tab. Nachos, Fries, and the 2.5lb of boneless wings, and ONE drink, was $55. Never at a PTs have I been charged $9-12 for BBQ sauce. I didn't even say anything because I couldn't deal with the stupidity and attitude anymore. I still left a tip because I can't in good concience leave no tip, but I will never be back. Y'all are terrible. Good luck to you."}
{"text":"Had a great first visit can't wait to go back and watch the game and chill on the leather couch"}
{"text":"I love PT\"s . The atmosphere is great. Their food is wonderful and at a great price also. I win a lot at Keno on the bar machines in here . The people who work here are very friendly and welcoming..swing by if you get a chace..Great place to have a drink, have lunch, play pool or table games and watch sports!!!  I prefer the PT's on Sahara myself, but there a few others here in Vegas also."}
{"text":"I love Drea!!  The prices are just right and they have the best happy hour in town!! The wings are bomb!"}
{"text":"Remedys is better. Walked in and the place was dead! After  looking at us several times a blonde bartender finally came over..7 min into seating by bar. Ordered drinks.. waited another 13 min before she came back to give us menus, still no drinks. Took us another 4 min to decide to just leave. I'd rather spend more time driving down eastern to remedys then to waste my day and money on a place with zero customer service. How come there's only ever 1 or 2 people working at a time? Must not get busy, and now I know why... Sierra gold on warm springs is the same. We went there a week later to try it out. Never going to a PT'S franchise again."}
{"text":"Filthiest , most disgusting Mens room in all of Las Vegas !!"}
{"text":"Ok place to watch football games. They get a small crowd of Patriots fans every game, and they some times can be a lively bunch. If you are close by this is a place to watch them play. Bartenders are always friendly and attentive. Not a very big crowd."}
{"text":"Came here a few times for midnight happy hour. Pretty good deals and food is good too. Chill environment too. And Vince is the best bartender in Vegas, hands down. Super cool dude. I always make a stop here when I'm in town. Wish we had these places in Cali!"}
{"text":"Cool chill place with good prices for drinks and the have shuffleboard and pool tables as well as cozy couches ... Best thing about this place is that it's connected to rebertos!!!!! Can't get much better drunk food then that!!"}
{"text":"Early dinner at PTs tonight. We ordered the finger an fry bucket , which was pretty good, probably could've put more fingers in the bucket, but it's cool, was very tasty. Than we ordered the spinach dip with garlic toast an chips, which I loved very much! The atmosphere is mellow, not too noisy, very clean and our waitress was very nice/pleasant.  I enjoy this bar for it's location, cleanliness and tasty food.  Will I go back? Haha I've been going here before yelp was taking reviews! Of course I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Its a good place but like every bar of that kind people there weird sometimes , food is good location is perfect easy to find its comfortable and clean enough.  Bartenders not the best take them forever to take order and people are allowed to smoke that I dont like it ."}
{"text":"Good place I like going there to shoot some pool or just have a beer. Great environment , good service for the most part. Not busy ,close to strip not always great people so 4 stars."}
{"text":"Worst Pts ever! Looks sketchy from the outside but we gave it a try because we were picking someone up and were waiting for a delayed flight. The inside was nice though. Very deceiving from the outside. Our first bartender was very nice and we got our drinks right away. Decided to leave the bar area to play pool and opened a tab.   So...  when I went back up to grab another drink, another bartender clearly saw me sitting and waiting to order, then turns around and asks \"do you need something?\" Um, yeah! Hello. So rude. Drinks are overpriced, $7 for a tiny rocks glass of rum and coke with barely any rum. Stay away.   Oh yeah! Someone swiped our truck on their way out. Didn't notice it until we got home, called, and they told us there was no parking lot surveillance."}
{"text":"My bill for 4 drinks and sliders during 12-3 am happy hr was $34 when drinks are supposed to be 50% off. Never going back and spreading the word."}
{"text":"So I'm a masochist... I keep visiting this Joint every couple of month with the hope things will improve, but they never do. The atmosphere is dumpy, the food is greasy, the service is so so.......sometimes better then worst. Last night I experienced the straw that broke the camel's back, I asked for ranch dressings to go with my (very) greasy fries and was charged $1.25 for a single ounce of it.  Goodby PT's may we never meet again."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. We came in sat down and waited for about 10 minutes.  Finally, the worker yelled from across the room, \"What? Do you need a menu or something?\" Customer service is usually spot on at other restaurants  and bars in this area. PT's Pub is the exception here.  Do yourself a favor and walk across the parking lot to Village Pub instead."}
{"text":"I hate to be the one but, barkeep, not the best, unfortunately it's always the bad ones that make it. Food 1 out of 10, I got the wings and fries and my wings tasted like they tried running away from the deep fryer but failed. My fries were soggy, just imagine cereal after 20 minutes. Best of all the barkeep didn't know his taps and gave me a lager when I asked for stone ipa. Honestly I don't know what happened to this place, but you get what you pay for I guess now."}
{"text":"I am reviewing on my service only and they are excelling in costumer service. Normally service at pt's pubs are mediocre at best. Our bartender Aluna is amazing and very helpful. We are here on a Sunday morning for football and have no problem getting the bears game. Although at all pt's the sound is only on one tv and it's first come first serve.  The cook is also very professional and timely. The food here is typical bar food and tastes alright. Overall I'm a happy camper."}
{"text":"None of the PTs have very good food but ok neighborhood bar...  most already know if you don't gamble enough you pay for your drinks.  I don't think you need to remind us every single time we come in and definitely not more than once in a night.  You should try to remember who comes in occasionally and how they tip horrible service made you feel like you were trying to drink for free... done trying... we'll stick with remedys and wildfire..."}
{"text":"We have been here a couple of times. It seems like a locals place for sure. It is kinda dark when you enter.   Depending on the time you come here is how the service is.  We have had good service and other times slow. Its a great place if you  want to sit at the bar and watch some sports.  They do have a happy hour with specials as well. I don't think we would come back to this one just to eat. Food was ok."}
{"text":"They have the best bar tenders bar backs and cooks!!! Drea and Rachel always make sure your taken care of! And Anthony and the other older black guy I forgot his name come out say hello and are always friendly! They are the best crew and that's the only time I like going there no one compares!"}
{"text":"Here for the Miami Dolphins game I sweat really bad. we got the Big W... lost few hundreds was so happy to get the Royal the end bartender lady was amazing even when I was losing she kept me in a good mood I threw up my last 20 in the and I got the big W is well what else can you ask in this beautiful Sunday afternoon. By the way they  keep the doors lock all day but on this part of town and I blame them. kristie the bar keeper. thanks you guys"}
{"text":"I went for fried pickle chips which I really like because you can taste the pickles with in them and they change them to pickle fries which all you can taste is the oil and the fried batter which is completely disgusting... I will not be ordering food from them again hence I will be going to a different bar now... drinks are nice their during happy hour but you can get those same drinks anywhere... plus I've noticed that they tighten the machines all over PT's in general... so I'm down losing money there I will be trying Timbers now since I'm told they have better drinks, better food and the machines are looser"}
{"text":"Just got off work came to hang out and play a little... Played over 220 in poker and got a bill for 75 dollars .....CRAZY BUT WHAT EVER ........ put 20 in a machine it did not read it and I Don't get it back..... How does that work........ Never again will i bring anyone here. After paying for extra fireball i didn't order.....now i have to wait for a tec to give our money that we put in a machine"}
{"text":"Bad bad bad...  came here for my 21st birthday,  and they didn't except my call consular id card. I could be in the place but couldn't get a drink.  I don't understand why,  it's  issued government ID.  They said if  want to have a drink here that I have to bring my passport."}
{"text":"Do food is good n staff is friendly but only reason Y I'm giving them a 3 star rating is bcz if their failure to verify to go orders (3rd time I've ordered to go  3rd time I'm giving the wrong thing)"}
{"text":"Love this PT's. Bartenders are great! Friendly service. Happy hour is the best. 5-7pm and 12am-2am. 50% select appetizers and pizzas as well as all drinks! Food happens to always be on point whenever I come here."}
{"text":"Asked for a drink the girl was super rude I want to how she got a job there in the first place. Super full of herself ignored me the whole time I was sitting there waiting for a drink."}
{"text":"I have been to a Sierra Gold before, but this was my first time at PT's. What a bad experience it was, I can't even believe I wanted to try this place out!  My husband and I walked in and sat down at one of the tables. No one greeted us. There was a decent amount of people inside, but the place was not packed. We browsed the menu, waited for about 20 minutes and no one came by to help us. Finally, my husband went to the bar and asked one of the bartenders if we could order drinks and food. She told him that they don't have any servers so everything would have to be ordered at the bar. Wow, it would have been nice if someone greeted us and let us know in the first place! Right!?  The menu is a little different from Sierra Gold's (Sierra's one is better in my opinion). I was looking forward to at least having the bbq pork stuffed potato skins, but they didn't have those here. I ended up ordering the club wrap with NO tomatoes, which of course, came with tomatoes. My husband ordered the buffalo chicken sliders that he ordered in the past. This time, they made them way too spicy. So we both didn't enjoy our meals. Also, they did not give us any napkins.   The bartender gave us the wrong bill at first. She gave us the correct one after we complained. Then, she accidentally charged my card for BOTH bills! Can you believe that? She said that she voided out one of the charges, but wasn't very apologetic. I checked my account a few days later to make sure, and thankfully, I wasn't charged twice.   They really need to train their employees on customer service!  *Sigh* Never again...."}
{"text":"Dropped by for a late breakfast and got a traditions PT breakfast platter ( which is eggs, sausages, potatoes, rye bread and butter ) it was really good and the service was pretty fast. Our waitress told us that there is a special price for the breakfast items from 6 till 10 am. Overall it was a very good experience,  the only reason k give this place 4 stars is because in my opinion it is a little bit too expensive for that particular neighborhood and for the environment/atmosphere it offers. Solid 4 stars."}
{"text":"This is a very typical PT's location. When we walked in and were a little surprised by how bright it was for a bar. We were expecting it to be quite dark like the rest of the locations we have visited.   We were meeting a group here for an evening of drinks and pool. The service was really great. I was quite impressed by how attentive our waitress was and how easily she was able to keep our rather large party happy. I was, however, completely turned off by how smoky and smelly this place is. I know it's a bar, so what do I expect, but I really wish they had some better non-smoking locations.  Overall, exactly what you expect from a PT's."}
{"text":"This is my home away from home , great staff and great prices . What more do you want ! Stop by weekends , it gets crackin"}
{"text":"Becky rules!  Nuff said!  seriously though.  Modern day cheers.  Clean safe fun. Good food. Good people.  You can't ask for more than that.    I really miss living in NV because there are no PTs in AZ."}
{"text":"This is my favorite local hole in the wall Kevin's one of my favorite bartenders. They have plenty of things to keep it fun and interesting including a pool table, darts and TVs with games on. It's a must visit spot!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to this location and was very unhappy with our experience. As a bartender myself I don't understand what this woman was doing and she had personal friends in there that were on drugs  it was all around a bad experience. So much for trying different locations we will still with our normal location or staying at the local bar around the corner"}
