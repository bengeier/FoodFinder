{"text":"Great little restaurant that's been there for many years.  Best ravioli around no question!  Decor takes you right back to the 60's.  Daily specials are all good and don't miss out on fish pieces on Friday.  Can't say enough good things about this little gem!"}
{"text":"We wandered into this place on a visit to a local farm.  It has a lot of regulars, as I'd expect, given it's located in the heart of New Eagle.  We had the choice of breakfast or lunch, and I got sausage gravy and biscuits, which were perfect.  My husband got the reuben with fries and the chicken & dumpling soup, which he loved.  Our toddler love the homemade mac n' cheese, which was actually good (I'm a critic)!  They were extremely friendly and service prompt.  The interior consists of booths, tables and a counter with stools.  There's nothing spectacular about the breakfast menu, but it appears solid, based on my impression and other reviewers  We finished with the coconut cream pie and it was amazing--with real meringue on top as opposed to whipped cream.  Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"It's pretty clear this place has been a staple for decades now, and the staff are very friendly. I usually have the pancakes when I get breakfast there and the burgers are well cooked for dinner. I'd recommend this place if you're nearby. One of the better diners in the area, and with such competition that's saying a lot."}
{"text":"As the other place I discussed in my last review had a long wait, we figured we would go back to give Hill's another shot, and to see if maybe we had missed something last time we came, as others seem to really like the place.  I wish this visit had been our first--as it was much better than last time.  The food was leagues above what it was last time, and the service was better.  Items sampled this time were their homemade Gnocchi, homemade Cavatelli, homemade wedding soup and their version of a Bacon Egg and Cheese on toast.  For dessert, the apple dumpling, pumpkin pie, raspberry cream pie and the coconut cream.    The wedding soup was phenomenal, and one of the better ones I have had.  You could tell it was homemade, and the meatballs in it were great.  The Gnocchi were great--light and airy, paired with the homemade meat sauce.  From most places I have had gnocchi, I would say this is in my top favorites.    The \"Cavatelli\" was their gnocchi covered in a small layer of cheese, and then covered with the homemade sauce.  I liked it a lot, but my personal preference would be to have a little bit more cheese on it.  When I ate it, it didn't seem to have much on there.  It was VERY GOOD though, and I would recommend trying it.  I would get it again.  I was told the B-E-C was one of the best my wife has had.  She said they were generous with the bacon and toppings.  As always, the homemade desserts did not disappoint.  All of the pies were phenomenal, and I have to say it was one of the best meringue's i've had on a coconut cream pie.  The crust is great, fillings perfect and generous.    So, bottom line is, if things would continue in the fashion they did in this visit, we would have no problem coming again.  Would we choose it over our fav down the street?  No.  However, we would willingly come as our second option, without being --too-- upset about it.  We look forward to going back and trying something new off of their menu in the future."}
{"text":"I grew up in Hills. Best diner burger with New Eagle Bakery bun toasted on the flattop."}
{"text":"Since the new owners have taken over the food is much better and it looks much cleaner. The food is very reasonably priced and tastes good.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've gone here for dinner over 100 times as a child & this restaurant hasn't changed on bit it seems! One of the best restaurants in the Mon Valley."}
{"text":"I love this place they have the best pie and it's comfortable! I love their burgers and fries. So good! I don't go there often enough and I need to start going back."}
{"text":"I lived in Monongahela for 5 years and never ate there.  Met some friends there for lunch and it was really good!  Huge portions, nice servers, and good food. Not for ambiance, but if you want a solid, casual meal, head to Hills. Had the homemade pasta.  Good stuff.  And they use the old red Coca Cola cups that are big enough that you don't need more than one refill."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast the other day for the first times. You can tell the business has been there for many decades because it has an old diner feel. Counter down the right side split by booths and tables down the left.   Breakfast menu isn't bad but they only have the norm. Eggs, omelettes, pancake French toast; no biscuits, country fired steak etc.   None of the breakfast meals come with potato so you have to add that on which makes a 6-7.00 breakfast turn into 9-10 fairly quickly. My only complaint was the 'French toast' they tried to serve me. It looked like two pieces of bread toasted in the toaster and put on a plate and brought to the table.   One bite of that with no syrup got that sent right back to where it came from in exchange for pancakes which were pretty damn good!   The service was good, COFFEE WAS GREAT, and the food was decent.   I will go back but I won't be ordering the French toast"}
{"text":"Well this is a little hidden gem of a local place. The decor is pure 60s with Naugahyde boots and 50's music playing  quietly over the speaker system. The walls are adorn s with old photographs of the local area.   I was feeling a bit nostalgic and ordered biscuit and gravy, scrambled eggs and home fries. My military friends will recognize their chow hall staple.  It arrived quickly and hot! It didn't disappoint....took me right back to the dining facility which isn't a bad thing!  Good, simple, diner fool done right with great service and low prices. As long as you are not expecting some culinary chops, want home style cooking and don't mind a bit of a time warp, this place won't disappoint!"}
{"text":"Good little place to go for breakfast...the prices are very reasonable and the meals are home cooked. Atmosphere is cozy with decor that hasn't been updated since the 60s which gives it a nice feel- like you just walked into Grandma's house to eat."}
{"text":"New owners ruined the homemade sauce. It is disgusting and greasy! Had to ruin a great thing! Place has been in business for literally ever and then new ownership has to go and think they have to change things. Complete shame......"}
{"text":"Who has never tried Hills Restaurant in New Eagle? Well, it's a hidden treasure and if u like ravioli's, they are homemade and delicious. Diann Donaldson keeps saying \"oh my God\" every time she takes a bite. Plus they serve New Eagle Bakery bread. Yummo!!! It' doesn't say it's Italian but I think it's the best in the Mon Valley ... can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Off the beaten path Hill's is in the sleepy town of New Eagle.  The decor is American Diner and you can just tell upon entering good home cooking is what you can enjoy here.  There are booths and tables as well as a counter bar.  The menu isn't very large but the portions are.  Pasta of gnocchi, ravioli and more are home made.   The sauce is quite good though everyone has a special take on what makes good sauce.  The night I was there lasagna was on the menu.  Offering of a small or large portion is a nice option because you want to save room for dessert.  Home made pies are EXCELLENT and worth saving room for."}
