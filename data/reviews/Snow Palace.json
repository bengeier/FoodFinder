{"text":"Let It Snow - Although the city is full of Chinese restaurants, it's exceptionally hard to find one that actually serves tasty, decent portioned, authentic servings that don't cost you a Krugerrand. Also, you don't have to speak special code to get the dishes you want. Snow Palace is a little pricey, and on occasion, they've messed up our take away orders, but as stated earlier, in a city bereft of quality and reliable Chinese take out, I'll take it."}
{"text":"Great authentic Chinese food - delicious and great friendly service. Too bad they are moving in August to Varsity."}
{"text":"Ordering a To-Go dinner on the phone, was told $55+ plus 10% discount if I pay cash. When I pick up the order, they insist of charging me $55+ for cash payment, $58 if I pay credit card !!! I was very dissapointed. Went home and found out Brocolli Beef has no beef in it.........I was speechless... from that moment I swear to myself I would never order anything from this chinese restaurant, and I would tell anyone I know and I met, how bad the experience I had with this restaurant !!! If I can give 0 star rating, I would definitely rate them as 0 star!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent takeout place! Sorry that we haven't ordered from here until now.  I would not order the shanghai noodles or the spring rolls again, they were both bland. The beef with green beans + black bean saud and eight precious jewels dishes were amazing! Portions were a good size. Veggies and meat were of good quality + fresh. They also offer free delivery within 6km which I didn't know about until I picked up."}
{"text":"Love their silver noodles.  They have a sate version and a XO version.  I love the flavour of the XO sauce but it has dried shrimp bits that I don't like.  Have had dim sum here a couple of times already, its great to see a decent nw dim sum option is available."}
{"text":"I haven't been to the new location since they moved and I'm quite impressed with it. The place is spacious, clean and nicely decorated. For a chinese restaurant that's quite impressive in my books. The service is a bit slow considering we were there on a Tuesday night and it wasn't terribly busy. The food is just as good as I remember it. We had the beef brisket hot pot, gai lan with garlic, imperial chicken and the deep fried soft shell crab in egg yolk sauce (must order!). The complimentary taro and coconut dessert soup was good and actually hot, not lukewarm like the other restaurants. I would really like to return for dim sum."}
{"text":"Finally a place i can totally trust. D real deal lies in chinese menu. Otherwise ur missing out. I had my all time fav 8treasure tofu pot. It made me cry almost. It was sooooo good"}
{"text":"My review is for delivery only. I have never been inside their restaurant.   -Customer Service on the phone is understandable and quick  -Price for a one person combo is around $11 - includes a spring roll and fortune cookie, and more than enough food even for a grown large man  -Delivery from Crowfoot to Royal Oak is always estimated around 45 mins, however the 4 times I have ordered, I have received my food in 25 mins  -There is a delivery charge for orders under $30 but it is still worth it  -Food is great but unfortunately since I've lived in Alberta I haven't been able to find a place that beats Vancouver Chinese food, but this place is the best so far!  Always order from this place when I order Chinese."}
{"text":"Average food on the edge of expensive for dim sum, $5 per order   Pork dumplings with fish roe, average (frozen?)  Pork short ribs boiled? Then a spoon full of black beans put on top ugh  Beef flank stewed with bok choy and a lump of noodles I had to cut with a spoon"}
{"text":"I have been to Snow Palace a few times for lunch but never had the opportunity to go there for dinner before.  We finally went there for dinner and was pleasantly surprised.    The food is authentic Chinese but there are dishes there that you cannot order at a lot of other restaurants in town.  I quite like the 'drunken cold chicken' and the 'lion's head' (giant pork ball) dishes.    The service was good.    The decor is simple and functional but won't win any awards like most small Chinese restaurants."}
{"text":"We were first time visitors and enjoyed this place. Lots of other Chinese visitors here which was a good sign. The food was good and had authentic flavours here. I did find certain dishes to be blander such as the fried rice and the chow mein.  But there was Excellent service here!! Also I thought the location inside the complex in the basement was really cool!"}
{"text":"I live right across the street, so have ordered from them probably 10+ times. The food is pretty good, fairly consistent, portion size can vary quite a bit from dish to dish, and the price is a little on the higher side for Chinese restaurants. I've tried couple of their noodle dishes and definitely would not re-order... Everything else have been tasty =)"}
{"text":"This restaurant used to be located in Crowfoot but now it is in Varsity and it is downstairs in a seemingly renovated area.  It was my first visit to this location on a snowy Calgary afternoon. There was no wait for a table for two at noon. I first ordered the soup dumplings aka Shanghai xiao long baos.  It's difficult to get delicious ones in Calgary so I wanted to try them here. They were a disgrace: Oversteamed and the soup (the best part!) had completely escaped the dumpling. On to my noodles in soup...steaming hot, delicious and hit the spot. It was also a generous portion. Hubby got the beef curry on rice and he loved it. Solid place but don't get the soup dumplings."}
{"text":"Good Dim Sum, very interesting Northern style dishes, go early or you might have to wait."}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese restaurant in Calgary.  The vast menu does cater to the North American palate, but you would be doing yourself a disservice if you don't sample something from the crazy selection of authentic dishes.  These are sure to delight.   I'm always skeptical of large menus, and often wonder how they can possibly keep everything tasting so fresh.  But they do!  The availability of authentic dishes is a big deal for my wife, a native of Hong Kong.  She has been longing for a decent Chinese eatery ever since we moved here from Toronto where there is a wider variety of options.  A couple of our favourites here are the oyster & eggplant hotpot and the beef brisket hotpot.  Both are always cooked perfectly in clay pots.  If you are a bit more adventurous, be sure to try the pig stomach with ginger and green onion.  If it were up to me I would eat this on each visit, but sadly it's not.    We typically visit 1-2 times a month and always order 3 dishes and some steamed rice.  This is enough for next day's lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"Ordered take out after reading reviews, and sick of other Chinese restaurant close by. Food was perfect. Wor won ton comes with broth, and all ingredients in tray so they can be put in fresh. This is the way it should be. And salt and pepper seafood was delicious. Nice to get fresh squid, not cold and chewy like the other place we used to go to. This is definitely our new take out place."}
{"text":"I believe this restuarant is one of the most authentic Chinese Restuarants in Calgary. I was a bit surprised to see a lower than expected rating for Snow Palace. I recall good reviews at their original location in Crowfoot, and I think that there should deservingly be better reviews for this new location in Varsity adjacent to Crowchild Trail.   As most Chinese places do in Calgary, they cater to both Canadian and Chinese crowds, so obviously you'll find your sweet and sour pork and the like, which I won't comment on because I focused more on the Authentic Chinese culinary experience. (Which, outside of China, is actually somewhat difficult to find.)  The real secret to a Chinese restuarant like this is to order off the Chinese menu; here, fortunately, it comes with pictures of the dishes and a description in Chinese (unfortunately, no english). I suggest that you even get the waitress/waiter to read and translate these dishes for you so you can pick some that you like. These dishes are the ones with authentic flavours and where Snow Palace really shines.  A combination of both Northern and Southern Chinese flavours, Snow Palace did a truly impressive job capturing the authenticity of homestyle traditional cooking in a way that was not too greasy nor bland.   We ordered a steamed fish on tofu dish that was incredibly flavourful and tender, in a way that even my grandmother admitted she couldn't get at home. The Green bean & Mince Pork stir fry was also excellent - often it can be soggy and greasy, but these beans were crisp and fresh, the mince pork was tender, and the flavours were bright. We also got the beef brisket \"hot pot\" plate, which was a favourite of mine and I highly recommend. The beef was tender, with rich flavour and a rich, stewed, thick sauce. Portions where reasonably sized and priced - we were very satisfied.   Even the green tea was good tea, remarked my grandmother. We finished the meal with a sweet, tapioca based \"dessert\" soup that is traditional at Chinese restaurants after the meal (and is also complimentary). If you don't speak the language, you may have to ask for it as they will probably assume you'd rather prefer a fortune cookie.   This is a chinese restaurant, which has culturally different service. Good service means that they are attentive in re-filling the tea pot and bringing the dishes and serving the soup, but will otherwise leave you alone to enjoy your meal. I wouldn't expect them to come around and ask how the meal is generally.   Their new space is newly renovated, spacious (which can be unusual for a Chinese restaurant), and quite tastefully deocrated. Unfortunately, it requires a flight of stairs and is not wheelchair accessible, which made it a bit of a challenge for my grandfather (We insist the exercise was good for him, though).   My favourite authentic Chinese restaurant in the city."}
{"text":"Review: dinner with vegetarian options.  Bottomline: food is on point and authentic, whether it be vegetarian or not. It's unfortunate that this restaurant is not easily accessible.  Atmosphere: I've frequented this restaurant even before they moved near Dalhousie station. When I went to check out their new digs, I was truly lost and confused. I didn't realize that they had moved to the basement of a commercial complex. Access is not easy because there is no elevator. The flight of stairs makes it difficult for people less mobile. Otherwise, the place is clean and decorated traditionally with Chinese lanterns and such. But unlike other traditional Chinese restaurants, service is great and very friendly.  Food: great authentic Chinese food. Sweet and sour pork was awesome here. So was the fried duck with taro. Both were fried to perfection and batters were light. Veggie options were fantastic as well. The diced pineapple veggie ham fried rice had good \"wok hay\" (where the heat of the wok gets so hot it transfers the wok taste to the rice) and the fried egg plant with salted egg yolk was very flavorful.  Value: average for the quality and type of food. Portions were reasonable."}
{"text":"I was working at the construction site next door and came with one of my coworkers for lunch. While you can order anything off the menu, they have a lunch menu where you can have soup or a \"combo\" where there's limited selection of items.  Overall the food was decent. I had a combo. The quality seemed like they have a bunch of the items pre-made. It hit the spot and came out relatively quick."}
{"text":"Excellent Chinese restaurant!  It has authentic Chnese food and it also caters to the N. American palate.    By authentic, I mean food like pan fried sticky rice, kai lan (Chinese brocolli), choke (congee/porridge), dim sum, pan fried beef with rice noodle and bean sprouts, and lots of great dishes.    There is the other menu for the N. American palate - you know, the usual sweet and sour pork with pineapple, ginger beef; it's pretty good, too."}
{"text":"Tucked away in a tiny strip mall next to some warehouses, Snow Palace is about 20 feet wide and easy to miss, which would be a mistake because the food, Shanghai style, is outstanding and reasonably priced for the quality.  Moreover, due to its smaller size, its quieter so you can actually talk with the people at your table rather than have to constantly scream over the cacophony of clanking plates, screaming and shouting often experienced at larger sized Chinese restaurants during the weekend dim sum rush. Since we went for lunch I can't comment on larger dinner menu.  Service was fast, efficient and excellent.   Where to start on the food...Singapore noodles, perfect, a little heat on the first bite to get your palette reved-up, then a tsunami of curry, onions, garlic and other flavors bring up the rear in grand style.. The chili, sesame pork dumplings...killer.  Onion cakes, perfect, chewy, light layer of oil and very tasty. Not on the menu but highly recommended is the snow pea leaves (not pods) shredded pork, preserved egg and garlic cloves in broth.  Buckle up for dessert. The Dou Xia Guo Bing (not sure of English name I think its Shanghai style  fried, glutnous red bean paste crepe).  I've been eating these suckers for 30 years and this it right up there with the best of the best.  The very thin crisp outer skin pops like a first bite of a hot, followed by a thicker middle chewy layer of crepe before you get to the warm, sweet red bean paste oozing out the sides of the crepe.  Youzer!.  If you're in Calgary, I wish you clear skies, fresh powder on the slopes and an opportunity to eat some of the best Chinese food in town."}
