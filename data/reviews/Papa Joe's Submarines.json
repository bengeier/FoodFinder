{"text":"Ordered some food about a week ago. Showed up 15 minutes after I ordered it and it was ready and fresh. Fries nice and crispy and fresh and Subs were delicious. Have to get they're Philly cheesesteak. That's what they're known for and it's awesome. Will definitely be going back especially says my work is right there. Recommend for anybody to check it out"}
{"text":"I love going to this place you call ahead you order 15 minutes prior to going there and when you get there is always done cooked the way you ordered and ready for you the manager Linda is always smiling and eager to help you the french fries and meatball sub is my preference although in a hour or two afterwards when you burp you get that garlic taste but it is well worth it. This is Eastlake must go the only downside is to take out only"}
{"text":"I'm so glad someone suggested this place to me! Food is amazing, employees are always friendly, and it's reasonably priced!

The Tuesday pasta special is so worth it! The pasta and sauce is always amazing, and that's very hard to find! $6.55 for pasta with meatballs garlic bread and a small salad!

Plus, my favorite new thing is the steak and cheese sub! You can't get it at Mr Hero's for the price, and you don't get is as good!! Piled high with meat and cheese! So amazing!"}
{"text":"I must be quick...I don't have much time. I just finished a deluxe cheesesteak and a warm, fuzzy food coma is about to kick in...

Anyway, I work near here currently and had never stopped in as I usually noticed it on the way home from work and not at lunchtime. A rogue snowstorm (yup, Cleveland) had me coming into work around lunch time today and it was the time to give it a shot. Friendly people, simple menu and a good cheesesteak. Quite good. Not as chopped up as the ones out in Philly but this was so smothered in cheese, I didn't care. 

Next time back I'll probably try the chicken parm sub, I was kicking myself after eyeing that while waiting for my order (which was prepared quickly)."}
{"text":"Good neighborhood sub shop.  Steak & cheese sandwiches are good, so are the criss cross fries with cheese sauce.  They have soups daily that are good, my favorite is the chicken dumpling.   No dining room so it is stricly an order & pick up for take out shop."}
{"text":"When there is no time for a long wait at a sit down restauraunt Papa Joes hits the spot. I always get exactly what i want. ..fast and tasty. I can call ahead when coming home from work and my order will alwsyd be hot and ready."}
{"text":"Good prices.  Everything is greasy.  Great for a hangover.  People at this location are on par with the other location.  Miserable.  Will I eat here again?  Hell yeah I will..."}
{"text":"This is a great local sub shop. They have an excellent meatball sub as well as a philly cheese steak. The food is prepared very quickly even if ordered at the counter and the quality is always top notch. I highly recommend trying papa joes over any local chain sub shop. You will be very satisfied with that decision."}
{"text":"Well first off if my other option for to-go subs is Mr. Hero, yikes, Papa J's is much better.  Not saying its much better for you but I'm strictly going on taste.  I've been to this location many times and have never gotten a bad sub.  I opt for the steak and mushroom or the hot Italian.  I can't believe I've driven by so many times without stopping.  Now its on my list of places to go for quick subs if I can't make it out to Willoughby for Whataboutbob's."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for lunch during a road trip.  Got a 12inch sub, bag of chips and a drink for $9.  The sandwich, a turkey sub, was great.  They didn't skimp on the meat at all.  Looks like a family owned and operated place.  I'd go back in a second!"}
