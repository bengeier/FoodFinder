{"text":"There is again a new owner who seems very nice but as for the food. Every time I get food to go it is absolutely gross. I decided to get their prime rib dinner. Big mistake unless u like eating shoe leather. Other than the food its not a bad place to drink"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time after numerous people at my work said they have great food. Stopped in and they were right I got the big burger and seasoned fries. The burger was huge and tasted  great. the fries were great also. Drinks were cheep. Bartender was cute. Food was fast. Croud was nice. One of the best bars for food around. They need to get yellow mustard tho. I'm taking my own next time they only have brown"}
{"text":"It's gross here. Dead bugs on on the ledges. Bathroom is scary.  Owner sent out coupons to attract business, then after you order he tells you  he will not honor them. It's just a dive now. Lost its charm."}
{"text":"We've been coming to Hurricane Alley for about 30 years, since it was The Lighthouse.  We could not be called regulars, as we visit about 2-3 times a year. This is a dive bar, with booth seating separated by a floor-to-ceiling divider.  The place has not changed one bit in 30-years (even through ownership changes), I'm happy to say.  Here's what you can expect: 1) Great food.  Hubby loves their pasta dishes and I love their wings.  They are the real deal, all three parts, deep-fried and well-seasoned & served with the intention of burning both mouth and fingers, because nothing is ever served cold except the beer!   2) Clean restrooms.  If you think that's no big deal, you're wrong. 3) Loud bar patrons and loud juke box music.  You got a problem with that, move along - they really are the regulars and they are always here! 4) Ripped booths.  Big booths on one side.  Tables on the other side.  They are not concerned about it and neither are we. 5) Great service.  Always happy; always pleasant.  If I wouldn't have been coming here since I was in my 20's, I probably wouldn't just pop in and give it a try.  But that would be my loss.    Next time you've shoveled snow all afternoon or have just cut the grass, showered and don't feel much like cooking or dolling it up and you are just plain HUNGRY for something awesome to appear in front of you, give Hurricane Alley a try.  Did I mention that the Stuffed Banana Peppers and the Cole Slaw are the best?  And every place doesn't make great slaw you know - cut big, creamy and not swimming. I certainly am not looking for more snow to shovel, but thinking about Wings & Rings almost makes me want to cut the grass!"}
