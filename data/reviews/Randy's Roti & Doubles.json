{"text":"The lamb roti taste really great. The flavor was spot-on. The price is very affordable!"}
{"text":"Bland doubles
The doubles I got lacked flavour and we're dry. 
I was looking forward to having a west Indian spot downtown but I gotta keep waiting"}
{"text":"Came here last week for roti and doubles

The good: the doubles and the chicken roti were on point. Lots of flavour, nice heat and well cooked chicken. I'd never had doubles before (shame I know) and I feel like they were a good representation. The roti also being cooked to order was good.

The bad: the channa roti was not great, with a very strange taste. The filling to dough ratio was a bit hight and finally the service was super super slow."}
{"text":"Randy's Roti now has a standalone store oppisite the Toronto Reference Library. 
Service was great, Portion size was good and the pepper was hot . Really filling on a day when your hungry."}
{"text":"New roti Place in Yorkville. I liked the food and is prices are ok.  I got boneless chicken roti and was a decent size meal. Food was served really fast"}
{"text":"I really hate writing negative reviews. I had been planning to eat at Randy's because I just discovered it had taken over Buster's Sea Cove and was near us. I arrived at around 7:30pm on Saturday for takeout - my order was taken pretty quickly, and it looked like there were about 4 others before me waiting for their food. One hour later, I'm still waiting, and asked at least four times on the status of my order, without getting any clear response. Others who were with me had long gone. 

Before going, I had read the negative reviews on Google/Yelp on the terrible wait and service, but I always give a new place the benefit of the doubt since they're just starting out."}
{"text":"Overpriced food. Doubles were 2 for $5 which is NOT a deal what so ever. You go to other trini places they range from $1.25-$2 each. Also, the doubles were HARD. They were clearly sitting around for too long, I almost chipped my tooth. 

Try Caribbean Queen for cheaper ($1.75 each I believe) and proper doubles. Don't waste your money at Randy's."}
{"text":"Despite the less-than-enthusiastic reviews from my coworkers, I still had to try this place for myself. It's the only Caribbean restaurant within a few minutes walk from my office. Convenient.

Chef Randy himself was at the counter taking orders and he pointed out the special of the day which was a goat roti for 7.99. I also ordered 2 doubles (5.00) for my coworkers to sample.

First impressions: the portion seemed small. The roti and doubles both seemed to be a little light on the filling (see photos). They also both tasted a bit sweet. Sugar? I'm not used to these items being sweet. Unfortunately, I was disappointed with the taste, portions, and value. Perhaps I should have listened to my colleagues."}
{"text":"I'd never heard of Randy's Roti before, but it looks like they started out as a food truck in Mississauga. Their new brick-and-mortar location at Yonge and Scollard is a welcome addition to the neighbourhood, but I've seen a lot of restaurants come and go at this address. I personally love Caribbean food, so I'm hoping \"Randy\" does well here.

I ordered a large jerk chicken with rice and peas. The menu says \"rice and peas OR coleslaw\", but they gave me both. Maybe that's just what they do with the large. I'm not complaining; the coleslaw was extra crunchy and delicious. The jerk chicken was amazing! The meat was juicy, the skin nicely charred, and the seasoning doesn't hold back on the spice. My only complaint is that the rice and peas are cooked separately, and the peas are poured over top of the chicken. It didn't affect the flavour of the chicken, but the peas kind of congealed into a thin layer on the top. It didn't look very appetizing at all. I would have preferred if the peas and rice came mixed together. The portions are gigantic, but that's typical of most Caribbean places I frequent around the city. You definitely get your money's worth."}
{"text":"I stopped buying roti because what you get today is not nearly reminiscent of the 80s and 90s and my adage had become \"it's impossible to get a good roti in Toronto anymore!\" 
Only hunger pains motivated me to walked into Randy's at Yonge & Bloor for the first time yesterday - 'cock sure' it would be the typical disappointing experience. Restaurant chains are usually very mediocre to say the least. 
To my surprise the man greeted me politely, took my order then offered the curry chicken lunch special although I had missed the time deadline.
You can see the preparation of your food which is nice and this place offers good value for the buck. Caribbean restaurants usually gyp you of meat. 
Back in my car, I bit into that bad boy and a piece of Caribbean sweetness busted me in the mouth. I'm talking pure \"Trinny Flava.\" My taste buds were dancing. 
The roti was nice and hot, all the ingredients fresh, plenty curry gravy and the bake was nice & warm, soft with that rare stretchy touch. 
I'd asked for lots of pepper and usually the pepper sauce fights the flavour of the curry, this pepper sauce was balanced and complimented all the spices. 
In my opinion, the roti reminded me of Island Foods before the parents retired and handed the reins over to their children and the Roti Hut of the 80s in Againcourt Scarborough. 

Hope they don't drop the ball."}
{"text":"Tried 3 different items and thoroughly enjoyed all of them!
1. Stuffed goat curry roti: nice soft roti, curry was not bad. Overall, not the most amazing or best stuffed roti I've had (for background my family is Indian and I know this isn't an Indian place...). Can't say much more because I only sampled off my friend
2. Oxtail curry - delicious! First time having oxtail. I love the soft tendon around the tender meat. The meat to rice ratio was perfect! Lots of meat and sauce. The rice was not drowning in sauce and was definitely not dry at all. The coleslaw was among the best I've had. It was spicy, crunchy, fresh, and had a lot of flavour. The portion was so small though :'(
1 star lost because not only was the side/veggies small but the overall plate. Even after eating the main and half a double, I was still hungry.
3. Veggie double - small but very reasonably priced imo when compared to a taco that costs much more. The bread is so fresh and the curry was so flavourful.
I also dislike how the dine-in food is served on paper plates. It is very wasteful and the plate does get quick soggy from the curry. Plastic cutlery is also used and I'm not sure if they have a recycling bin on site. Cups for water are also not given.
Overall, I would come back and also reccomend the food to others for takeout."}
{"text":"Randy's was a pleasant surprise. I was expecting quite a bit less, just based on the location - often finding ethnic specialties lose their charm in highly gentrified commercial neighborhoods. That being said, the boneless chicken roti could've been more flavourful, the channa in the doubles could have more chutney, and everything could have been a lot spicier. It wasn't a disappointing experience, the food quality is great, the roti is soft and fluffy, the chicken curry is tender and perfectly cooked. I also found the prices were quite a bit higher than most of my tried and true roti spots."}
{"text":"Had to be the worst curried goat I've ever had in the GTA rice was very watery and way to expensive my god would not recommend ever sorry"}
{"text":"2nd time going to Randy's Roti's today and it was not a great experience. My friend and I arrived and the line was so long! Gowever we decided to wait thinking it wouldn't take long to prepare the food. BIG MISTAKE. We waited 45 mins for our food which was just ok. The roti shell it self was fresh, however there was barely any meat or potatoes inside the actual roti and it was bland. It was the same thing on my first visit, so no I wouldn't recommend or go back."}
{"text":"The Goat Roti is great - a great amount of filling, the pepper sauce was delicious. This is a weekly regular in my rotation now.  I took away 1 star only because of the service on paper plates and plastic cutlery.  I assume it has to do with their setup and that they started off as a food truck service.  As far as flavors go, it's some of the best I've had in a while. True West Indian style roti is hard to find in the area but I feel that they've nailed it.  
Saw the other reviews that complained about wait times but I've never had to wait more than 5 minutes."}
{"text":"Honestly I think this is the best West Indies / Caribbean style roti in Toronto, certainly in downtown. Very nice friendly staff in here too, nice and clean and comfy. I work nearby and come here once a week. Chicken roti is consistently fantastic. I'm personally not a fan of the doubles though."}
