{"text":"Happy Hour is AMAZING there - the calimari and roast beef sliders the best of the bunch.  I also enjoyed the fish, branzino, I think it was.  The siracha chicken sticks were not fully cooked, which was a bummer, because the sauce was good.  I could pass on the mashed potatoes, and side salad.  Also, it's valet parking only - so bring extra for the valet drivers.  I probably wouldn't go here for dinner, but would be there in a second for Happy Hour.  :)"}

{"text":"Richardson's came highly recommended by a friend, so we thought we would check it out while in town.  The venue was terrific, it has a great vibe.  The shrimp quesadilla and pork burrito were excellent, while the Santa Fe chicken was marginal.  Contrary to other posts, the service was good."}
{"text":"They do not offer self-parking, the parking is all valet.  We parked on the lot, and the valet company used someone's car to block us while demanding keys.  We said \"no\" and were further harassed.  When asked about self-parking we were told to park at a different business.  Now furious, trying to leave, the valet used the patrons automobile to block the exit.    Be very afraid of a valet person using your auto as a weapon."}
{"text":"Awesome food more awesome service thanks cj. Kendra one who knows all makes a great libation"}
{"text":"As a long time (15+ years) patron, it's hard to write this. I'm not sure what's happened, but Richardson's is not what it used to be. After several not-great-not-terrible dinners, this last one was unfortunately worthy of review. From a server who pushed us 3x in the first 10 minutes to order when we'd already ordered appetizers and were enjoying wine and conversation, to tilapia swimming in a soupy, tasteless \"sauce\", to salads that arrived AFTER the main course, to an unopened bottle of wine left at the table with a broken cork, this was a sad and disappointing experience. The server eventually apologized for the wine, but not before pushing the broken, crumbly cork into the wine, capping it with the cork from the first bottle and offering it to us to take home. Almost $300 for a party of 4 to have this kind of experience? Unfortunately, we probably won't return unless we hear from many, many people that things have improved. Sniff."}
{"text":"little confused on the outstanding reviews. went there over a year ago (got enchilada's) and our second time there today. i will say warm cozy atmosphere and no overhead harsh lighting was the absolute best and one of the reasons i wanted to go back. it stopped there. service was just ok. house margarita just okay and considering the cuisine it should be outstanding and trademark to the venue. food served on plates so hot (tamale's) that eating your meal is a job versus enjoyment because you have to let every bite cool on your fork before you actually consume it. my husband ordered brisket tacos and i had one of them. every bite was chock full of fat. after the third bite and swallowing it all i was ill and had to spit it out in my hand and put it on my plate. i was chewing on more fat than i cared for in every bite. i'm fully aware it can have some fat but this was beyond horrible.  and lastly, i ordered the tamale's and i can handle spicy food but this is ridiculous. the food is sooo spicy that it takes away from what could be totally wonderful and hearty flavors. again, it was our second time and i think this is the theme to all their dishes. very spicy and temperature hot beyond so beware. i don't know how a food critic would commend this. the spice in the enchilada and tamale dishes is so hot that you can't appreciate the natural flavors that are there to begin with."}
{"text":"Service was fine. Place is decent. Here is my issue. And Hey, Richardson's I reached out to you via email first to see if you would respond and make good but I never heard anything back. So if this cost you guests so be it.   Ordered the Renello Platter, lots of food. Not complaining about the taste or the amount. But for the price this can't happen. The platter of food is enormous, so I got a take home container. The next day for lunch I went to eat the leftovers. I took a bite and got pierced in the roof of my mouth with a bone. Wasn't small. I'm a guy that takes big bites, so this bone wasn't something I noticed. It was sharp and over 2 inches. I took pics and complained. Nothing was done. I email management, nothing. I called, no call back.   For a place that charges what they do... Get bones out of your meat. Disgusting. Not only did I lose my appetite but I got a cut in my mouth.   Beware if you eat there for the bones in your chicken.  I won't be going back. And I hope you all reconsider before spending 20-50.00 a plate here."}
{"text":"The food is very good and I liked the atmosphere.  If you go for happy hour be very careful where you sit and then still ask the server.  We had a group of people on Wednesday and sat at a patio table only to find our table did not get happy hour prices.  Had we sat to the right of us at the bar or to the left of us at a different table, we would have saved about 50% on our bill.  Even the manager would not override it.  They said that we sat at a private table, this table was sandwiched between the front entrance gate and the front door of the restaurant, nothing private about it.  The waitress never mentioned it or suggested that we sit at the other table."}
{"text":"What can I say about Richardson's?  It's a Phoenix staple with delicious food and amazing atmosphere; however, the service is lacking.  What does that mean exactly?  Let me tell you... We stopped here with four other couples on a bike pub crawl over the weekend, and sat on the patio to take advantage of a spectacular Happy Hour menu.  After ordering a few cocktails and appetizers, when it came time to settle our bill, our server said there was no way  she could split a check.  Moreover, after we questioned the logic (because who really doesn't have the means to split checks today?), she claimed that it clearly states this rule on the website.  Really?  That's the argument?  I checked the website, and there is nothing stating anything remotely close to her claim; and regardless, if that IS policy, why not clearly state that on the menu with the other \"You order, you own it\" rule? So what did we have to do?  We had to isolate each order, and write on the check the amount we wanted charged to each card, and had to ask the cashier to run each one separately.  Sure, we could have paid all on one card and figured it out among ourselves afterwards, but it's now about principle.  Moreover, in retrospect I wonder what she would have done if we all claimed not to know one another, thus required that the checks be split accordingly?  It's this type of policy, or simply lazy service, that makes me dislike a once highly recommended dining spot. It's to note, we never have any service issues while alone as a couple; it's only with others where we have concern. Additionally, service challenges aside, the food here is spectacular.  The bacon wrapped shrimp, along with the presentation, is one of the best happy hour selections one can make in the valley.  And the entrees are nothing short of amazing as well.  The blue corn smoked turkey enchilada is comfort food at its finest, and the smell of pecan wood just heightens the senses. Overall, we'll surely be back; however, between now and then I hope they can figure out a way to accommodate split checks.  If I can find an app on my phone in less than 30 seconds that does it, I would think a restaurant of this quality should have a similar solution."}
{"text":"Friday night was my last night of my business trip. My friend took me to Richardson's. New Mexican style food...yes, yes, yes. I had the BLACKENED SCALLOPS. Mmmmm!  Got there just after 6, so we missed happy hour.  It's not a large venue, but luckily there were two seats at the bar.  There were so many selections that sound so delicious. I must go back to try those green chile potatoes.   For Happy Hour enthusiasts...on the menu  \"During Happy Hour 3pm-6 pm & 9 pm-Close Until We Change Our Mind!\"  We got there just after six, so we missed Happy Hour, so go early. It's also valet parking.   I have no pics. I ate it all before I remembered."}
{"text":"Not the best experience for at this chain of restaurants. It was our first time back to Richardson's new building and we were there for lunch. It looks just the same on the inside, complete with the horrible step up as you head left after entering the restaurant. C'mon guys, you couldn't have put in a ramp? Two people tripped on that step as we were having our brunch. We were at the first table as you walk in to the left, right next the the fireplace. Unfortunately, I don't think they had the thing set up right because we were blown with ash at one point.   We got the eggs benedict jalapeno to share because the plates are usually so large. It was plenty of food, but not stellar. The english muffin was cut so the bottom was so thin that it got soggy and flimsy with the jalapeno hollandaise. The meat was supposed to be pork loin, but we were served a big piece of thin ham. Yes, I understand pork and ham are the same animal, but what we got was not pork loin. It was a much cheaper version. For $15 I was not happy. I was happy we didn't each order a dish and get completely ripped off.   The service was not great but I chalked it up to our waitress not having a good day. She came by after we waited nearly 10 minutes to get our drink order and we tried to put in our food order, but she walked away as we trying to say \"and then...\". She also refilled my coffee without asking if I'd like more (my personal pet peeve). I just hate it when the automatically pour in more coffee when my cup isn't even half empty. I have the sugar/cream proportion perfectly set to my taste and you just threw it off because you swooped in and didn't ask. Grrr. She did this twice. I had food in my mouth the second time and don't like to throw up a hand (I think it's rude). Grrrrrrr.   Last oddity was the fact that the charge shows up as \"burningembers\". I couldn't figure it out for a few minutes before it finally hit me. You know, because they keep burning down their restaurants. Bet their insurance is a doosey."}
{"text":"We went to Richardson's for a date night. We were told they don't take reservations for parties less than 4 people. When we arrived, the wait was an hour. We chose to wait because we didn't want to sit at the bar, but after a while we were hungry so we gave in. We were constantly bumped into by anyone passing by behind us and I had some personal space issues with the drunk woman standing next to me. I enjoyed the prickly pear margarita and, with the exception of the crowded bar area, the ambiance was nice. The chorizo spinach dip and sriracha chicken skewers were great but our entrees were just okay. The food was overpriced for what it was."}
{"text":"We came here for Sunday brunch and they serve it till 4pm (yay!). This also includes very spicy margaritas and large mimosas for $5! Until 4pm! Our food took a while to come out and the staff was full of characters not good or bad just unusual service. I was lucky enough to nibble off of everyone's plate and it was all savory, satisfying and very very filling!  Portions here are gargantuan! Finishing your entire plate proved to be impossible for everyone in our party so order appropriately.   Also, the inside is very dark so if you are done with the sun this is a nice refuge. This place get 3.5 stars for me, but I think it's better to round up!"}
{"text":"I have frequented Rokerij for sometime, but this was my first time dining at Richardson's. DEFINITELY make a reservation (which we did) or you will be waiting a LONG time for a table.  The atmosphere is lovely, though a bit cramped. I think it would be nice to sit outside near the fire in the cooler months.  The food was good - not outstanding, but good. The seafood was fresh. Don't plan on dessert unless you like flan, since that is the only dessert on the menu. The wine and cocktails were pretty good as well.  What was awful was the service. Our waitress acted like serving our table was an inconvenience. And it wasn't just her - at one point, before we paid our bill and while we were still talking, someone came over to our table, took our wine glasses and our placemats. We all stopped talking and looked at him. It was obvious they wanted us to leave so they could turn the table. I'll stick with Rokerij from now on!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was recommended to us by the concierge at the hotel we were staying at. Overall, I'd say the food was excellent, and I particularly liked the different salsas and other sauces they had. I put away a plate of tamales like there was no tomorrow! They made an off-menu burrito for dinner for one of us, and a very nice quesadilla for one of my children. All the dishes had a nice smoky, somewhat spicy taste, although I think they overdid it warning us about how spicy this were. Maybe they should come up with a scale to measure spicyness, like most other restaurants do.   Anyway, I liked the dark, cave-like interior and cozy booth seating - very nicely designed, and made for a nice atmosphere for dinner. Alas, the service was slow and indifferent, and I had the same gripe about tiny beers that are so expensive. We ordered a second round, which came in clearly much larger glasses, which made it feel even more like we were cheated on the first round. Also, the sodas my kids ordered were from syrup, and not mixed properly.   Overall, very nice atmosphere and food."}
{"text":"I've been going here for 15 years and never once have I had a meal that was boring or disappointing! Love this place! Yum, yum, yum, yum is really all I can say!"}
{"text":"Have lived in the valley for three years and this is hands down my favorite restaurant.  Have never had a bad meal here.  My two favorites are the Carne Adovada and the New Mexican Platter.  The New Mexican Platter is not for the faint of heart and should be attempted only on an open stomach.    Great atmosphere, great vibe, can't recommend highly enough."}
{"text":"We had such a poor experience with this place last night.  Things started off poorly when there was clear conflict between the hostess and the server, Susanne.  After several attemps our party of three was finally sat. Our waitress gave us a couple of snide responses on menu questions   \"what's in your Mexican style ceviche?\"  \"Its just ceviche.\"  That's not helpful.  Turns out it is fish and shrimp with tomatoes, onion and jalapenos.    I explained my food allergy and she claimed the tacos were safe to eat after going off to check.  She did say they sometimes garnish with peppers but that it could be left off.  I ordered tacos and reminded her off my allergy.  I took one bite, swallowed a pepper and immediately reacted.  I was very sick the rest of the night and into this morning.  I had to run to the bathroom to avoid throwing up at the table.  The worst part is that the manager (i think his name was Frank) lied and said he had seen the ticket with the no peppers written on it! He later admitted to lying because it was not written on the ticket.  We had to force them to comp the meal we never ate (one appetizer and 1 order of tacos and 3 drinks that were never drunk).    This level of service is ridiculous!  I clearly explained my food allergy and asked about ingredients in order to enjoy a business dinner out of town.  The experience at this place and their handling of it was appalling."}
{"text":"After years of being Richardson's customers we have sworn not to return. The good flavors are diminished, the service is average at best and the music was loud and appropriate for a nightclub, or running a marathon but not for a candlelit dinner. If you are arriving from the north it is very difficult to make a safe left turn into the only entrance allowed by the valet.  We had arrived with big appetites knowing the food to be hearty. We were force fed an unappealing dose of wrestling on one of the distracting TV screens - definitely an ambience and appetite killer. We asked the waitress to turn the music down, she said she'd see. It didn't happen. Eventually we called for a manager. Mario was pleasant and changed the playlist. Apparently the owner dictates the music, which makes me think he's trying to win a new young crowd and neglect his stodgy older clients like me, a forty something. The waitress was not knowledgeable about the menu. There were two hostesses, one in training, and the trainer on her phone texting all evening. The halibut was dry. The Chimayo Chicken is no longer the standout dish it used to be. The signature jalapeño potato was bland, not even spicy this time. The lamb tacos arrived ten minutes after all the other main courses were delivered, with no apology. They had to be sent back, they were way too dry to be enjoyed. Lamb needs to be seriously over cooked to be so dry. The waitress took the dish back. She did not return with a counter offer from the chef, the manager did not appear to enquire about it. The lamb was included on the check. We paid and left and they have lost two families who have been long time customers."}
{"text":"I was in town for a conference and tried this place after reading the reviews.    We were greeted by the hostess quickly and waited at the bar for our table.  The bartender was attentive and served us a couple of drinks.  The ambiance is actually quite nice and cozy as folks have mentioned.  Our wait time to be seated was also about 40 minutes, so i would recommend coming when less busy or for happy hour and grabbing a seat at the bar.    The waitress seemed rather rushed and not attentive, as we had to ask for water.  Additionally, it was odd that the waitress did not even go over any of the daily specials noted on the chalkboards.  We ordered a fish taco special noted on the chalkboard and a relleno platter as well.  Both dishes were served rather late, after about 20 minutes of waiting.  The place was not really packed by the time we were seated.  The main courses were fair, but nothing really to write home about.  I was definitely expecting more.  We did try the flan, which was quite good.  The overall rating would have been three starts if our service was improved and the waitress took time to be more attentive and explain the menu items."}
{"text":"Fantastic ambiance and fresh, tasty food!! We had never had New Mexico cuisine before and were pleasantly surprised. Prices ranged... It was worth every penny for the $4o Sea Bass. My only complaint was that my red wine was served too cold... We enjoyed having a drink in the joining bar downstairs... Quaint and cozy and busy. Had to wait awhile to get served."}
{"text":"As a native of new mexico i appreciate the attempt at authentic cuisine. As with any restaurant, the green chile is going to vary. Sometimes hot, sometimes mild. But, good flavor. They lose a star because the bar tender brought me the wrong beer twice. Then charged me $7 a piece, during happy hour. After a whirlwind of criticism he finally took one off. But, great wine list during happy hour."}
{"text":"Rude, sloppy, and lazy customer service. Specifically the incident that inspired me to give my rating today (believe me, if I could give 0 starts - I would)...I have been here several times and always ordered the same thing. Twice I was told the change I requested to my food was possible and I thoroughly enjoyed my meal. The third time I came as a paying customer to their restaurant, I was given a dirty look by my waiter, but my food was served to me as I had asked. Following this experience I attempted to try to dish as the restaurant originally prepares it and I was absolutely disgusted. Upon my final attempt to order the dish as I preferred, I was told they will no longer make the dish this way for me. In return, I will no longer be recommending this restaurant to people, and the 3 people who thought to possibly return here after I brought them, will also be informed of this disservice. I have now been informed by someone, likely an employee, that their food is also laden with semen."}
{"text":"Outstanding, this place has it all.  Food, service and atmosphere...all great!  Chimayo chicken: terrific.  Wife reports Tomatillo Toast:  VERY good and our guest rated the New Mexico EnchiladasAs outstanding.  Bottom Line:  visit with confidence and enjoy!"}
{"text":"I'm shocked this place only has 3.5 stars!  The food was awesome and the restaurant is unique - something I value in Phoenix.  We had a hiccup with seating but the manager quickly rectified the situation and made us feel welcome.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went to brunch today at the Rokeri and enjoyed it primarily for the service. We were relegated to the bar which I wasn't to happy about but turned out to be the highlight of our visit. We were seated across from chef Laura and were treated to her magical touch. There wasn't a empty seat in the room and when we asked whether a certain sauce was to spicy she stopped cooking and brought a sample. She was aided by the great server Alena and a overworked bartender who's name we didn't catch. Great job bartender! By the way, the food was excellent!"}
{"text":"I did not think this place was all that.  The food wasn't bad by any means but I've had better in Santa Fe.  I think the fact that our waitress was distracted and oblivious for most of the meal really tainted my experience.  We were seated in the front patio and she rarely came by to check on us.  Since we were starving we ate our queso appetizer without any silverware or napkins, and we ended up never getting any till after our entrees arrived.  I had to hail down a waitress from a neighboring table to get some for us and she was visibly annoyed.  How else were we exactly supposed to eat?!  I hated my drink, having ordered the prickly pear margarita after being assured that it wasn't sweet, but it was.  Of course the waitress never came by to check on us, so I couldn't trade it in for something else, but a friend graciously switched with me.  My enchiladas were nice and the portion generous, but it was on the spicy side so beware.  The restaurant seemed charming enough and the food was good enough to save this from being a two star rating."}
{"text":"The best place in Arizona for Carne Adovada, Guacamole and Prickly Pear Margaritas. An especially fun place to bring out of town guests for a Southwest experience. Dark, cozy booths inside which require early arrival or reservations for parties of four or more. The outside bar also has great atmosphere for a more casual evening."}
{"text":"I rarely give 5 stars, but this place was AWESOME.  Definitely not many of it's kind in Phoenix, in my opinion, or any for that matter!    Went for the first time on Saturday, Jan 4th and Jason was our server.  His service was outstanding, and he didn't make us feel rushed in any way, and answered all our questions and chatted with us a while.  The atmosphere was very inviting and had an authentic feel to it.  I ordered the Rellenos and Eggs with green chile and my friend got the Pork Chop and Eggs.  We both loved our dishes and ate everything on the plate.  The Relleno peppers are filled with your choice of pork, beef or turkey.  I ordered the pork and beef and it had such a delicious smoky flavor to it, like it was slow cooked.  Also ordered up a couple Bloody Mary's, only 5 bucks each and outstanding.  I will DEFINITELY be back to this place, and don't know why I didn't go sooner."}
{"text":"Always awesome at Richardsons. One of my favorites. Love the stroganoff special. The Moscow Mules aren't bad either."}
{"text":"Thank you, Richardson's for delivering, once again, an exceptional dining experience. We stumbled onto your great New Mexican (yes! there is a difference) cuisine back in the 90s when we lived in the area.  We were thrilled when you reopened.  We have friends visiting us from FL and they are definite \"foodies.\"   There was only one place that was a \"must\" place to eat while they were here.  Jason, our server, was fantastic and fun. His suggestions were outstanding. Another terrific Carne Adovada and the servings are so large we all have lunch tomorrow.  We drive from Anthem and it is SO WORTH IT! I don't say that about too many restaurants.   Thanks, Jason. It's staff like you that keep us coming back. You are awesome."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Large menu with alot of variety, strong drinks and an interesting atmosphere. I usually prefer to sit downstairs next to the fireplace and have a few cocktails before checking out the menu. The service is eh, dont expect much on that angle but the food is great and the atmosphere is a close second."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I couldn't say enough great stuff!  The reputation of Richardson's had my expectations set high and I was not let down! I thought that $15 was a bit expensive for a scallop appetizer but once it hit the table I was very happy, each scallop was plump and cooked perfectly. With rice, beans and four different sauces to pick from it was perfect to split.  We had two entrees, the Garlic Shrimp and the New Mexico Surf and Turf. Both meals were hot when the waiter brought them out and were cooked perfectly. I couldn't have asked for anything more, just an awesome meal!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! I'm from New Mexico originally and they have the best carne adovada I've ever had! Great brunch too."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and green chile dishes! The best I have found outside of New Mexico and Colorado."}
{"text":"Richardson's = best sea bass ever!  Short ribs were also amazing.  Everything was great; can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I am THRILLED that this place is in my new hood.  Came by here again yesterday and could eat my fat ass to death and not get bored.  So many choices and the flavors are simply wonderful.  The ambiance is nice too.  You have to check it out!  :)"}
{"text":"Went to Richardson's again tonight as it's one of my favorite restaurants for the past 10 years. Horrible experience tonight as we made a reservation late for 6 p.m. and they said all they had was on their patio. I specifically asked if they had misters and they said YES. So off we went and when we were seated the misters weren't on, so we asked for them to be turned on. They did, but they they kept turning them off. When we continued to ask why they were off they said others where complaining they were dripping on them. The only other patrons were ones at the bar waiting for their inside tables. We had 6 people and our bill was almost $400. At the end the waitress asked how everything was and we asked for our check so we could leave as we were all VERY hot (misters were off for the last 30 minutes of our meal). She apologized and told us it was a \"liability\" to have the misters on and that someone had reserved the \"pit\" on the patin and paid $500 as a deposit and they didn't want the misters on. As we walked out of the restaurant and left a 15% tip instead of our normal 25% (she lost $30) we saw NO ONE else eating in the \"pit\" area, only 4 or 5 people standing around and the floor was completely dry. Very disappointed that we were told outside would have misters, which the few times they were on made a BIG difference and that the few bar patrons were more important than our table of six, with drinks, apps, $35 entrees. We will definitely rethink heading back to Richardson's after this experience no matter how good the food is.........since we had to take 50% of the food home as it was too uncomfortable to eat."}
{"text":"A special shout out to our wonderful server, Misty!   Thank you for making our brunch so special!  The food and service amazing. What a gem to have in our fair city. Simple casual atmosphere with great food!  Can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"This is a must when in Phoenix.  Best carne adovada ever!  The new place is even better with a great patio and outside bar; moreover, the keep with the feel of the old place.  Great food, great atmosphere, and spectacular service!    LaDonna is phenomenal!  Have her make you a Jamaican Ten-Speed.  You'll love it!"}
{"text":"This place has some of the best and spiciest carne adovado! Their signature pasta dish (the first on the menu) Pasta Heidi is delicious as well. If you order the margarita, make sure to get it \"skinny\", the prickly pear is very good. The outside seating is beautiful."}
{"text":"This place kind of disappointed me. Whatta bummer.  First of all, it's 2 places in one. Did not know that. From reviews I read before going, I was lucky enough to grab a parking spot out front because they're tiny little parking lot is usually valet. I hate valet!  Anyway, the cobblestone, hanging plant walk-way was pretty cute. Oh and the firepit seating and couches look like they'd be really cozy and intimate for an evening cocktail. So they've def got that going from them. Although when I was walking through the entrance no one greeted me. There were two guys who looked like they worked there just standing around. Come on, man.  The host thre me off too. He wasn't in a uniform or anything that identified him as the host, so I was a little taken back.   But when we were seated, I loved the adobe like seating arrangements and the lighting in the place made me feel like I was in a 1950s New Mexico saloon having a whiskey at 2 o'clock in the afternoon with a surly old bartender... that's a good feeling.  Wasn't impressed that the waiter didn't bring us chips and salsa until 30 seconds before our meal arrived but they were tasty. I orded the Taos Club because I love avocados. It turned out to be more of  wrap cut into 3s and not wrapped tight enough because it was disaster to eat and nothing stayed inside. The accompanying salad would have been way better had it b=not been slathered in ranch.   I had such high hopes for this place, but I honestly can't say that I'd go back. Wah Wahhh."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. I eat EVERY meal out. This is one of the best. I had the chilliean sea bass. The atmosphere  ( eat on the patio, I had it to myself Temps high 40s) is almost as good as the food. Service was very friendly and helpful. Thanks to Tana and Jen. Memorable afternoon"}
{"text":"We found this spot on chance. What an amazing spot! Atmosphere, service, and food were all excellent.   Walking in was a great experience feeling like you stepped into dim lit romantic spot. The menu is varied but the items we had were incredible, very flavorful and attention to detail.   I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Zero stars.  - Terrible food, mostly canned or pre-processed garbage - Service was pitiful.  Staff was extremely rude and disrespectful to the customers - Atmosphere was depressing.  Dark, dingy, smelly, uncomfortable  My biggest gripe is with management.  They offer happy hour specials, but do not clearly tell you which sections of the restaurant apply to happy hour.  As such, we were overcharged for our meal, and they were not willing to discuss the misunderstanding.  Clyde, the \"manager\" is pathetic.  He has no authority or power to manage the restaurant.  I'm not sure why the owners would employ a manager who doesn't respect customers, but I can see why they have not given any decision-making authority to this hapless schmuck.  Under no circumstances should you go to Richardsons.  Best case scenario, you eat overpriced, low-end slop in a depressing setting.  Worst case scenario, they'll steal your money and give you food poisoning."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place through my Thrillest app, looking for a good place to eat after my girlfriend's graduation from Arizona State University. I have to say this place is truly exceptional from the hot plates and exquisite food to the decor. If you find yourself near Phoenix I highly recommend this place, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great New Mexican style food. I have a hard time not ordering the Carne Adovada every time. However, the pork tenderloin and beef tenderloin are great choices. The atmosphere is a winner. Very little light with flickering candles to create a warm enjoyable dining experience. They get it right"}
{"text":"This really should be a 5 star review, but I can no longer take clients to a restaurant where the wait staff looks down their nose at you. I felt the whole time like I had done or was doing something wrong.   The food was amazing and I'm willing to pay their $15 a plate charges, but this was the first time in a very long time I've left less than a 20% tip. If I were not with a client I would have handed it to the back of the house staff.   When the waitress (outdoors) barley keeps from rolling her eyes at you (because I was stupid enough to think I was allowed to box my own leftovers) something needs to change.

{"text":"Food was pretty good, however DO NOT bring your kids to this restaurant.  They would do better to just put a sign on the front door telling you that small children are not welcome (I would have appreciated that much more)  No kids menu, and nothing really on the menu that you can work into a kids meal.  no booster seats, not even a straw for the beverage.  All and all, a very unwelcoming experience.  Might try it again when it's just the two of us."}
{"text":"Nice to see that some things never change.  A friend and I decided to try Richardson's last night after a late meeting since they are open late. We started at Sierra Bonita Grille but they close at 9pm on Monday nights and actually referred us to Richardson's.  So we arrived at Richardson's at 9:30pm. Where the hell is the door into the place?!? There were 4 people at the bar. No sign whether we seat ourselves. Finally we got the bartender's attention and he told us to sit anywhere and that yes, the kitchen was open.  We sat in a booth. A busboy brought us water. And then we waited....and waited...and waited...and joked about them being soooo busy that no one could help us. Finally, a tall, jet-black haired waitress with a nose piercing that looked like a giant booger hanging in her nostril came to the table. She was a bitch with an attitude and acted extremely annoyed to have to wait on us or answer a single simple question about the appetizer. Again...a bitch. We almost walked at that point.  We ordered a draft beer, a glass of reisling, and their whole garlic appetizer that comes with toast points. And then we waited....waited....waited. We never saw the waitress again and the bartender stepped in and waited on us the rest of the night. The food and drinks arrived. All were good. Loved the appetizer.  The bill then came. $32 for a glass of cheap wine, a draft beer and an appetizer of a head of roasted garlic, some melted cheese and toast points. Good God. And, let me mention that the air was heavy HEAVY with smoke from the kitchen. We both walked out smelling so strongly of smoke that I showered when I got home to get the smell out of my hair.  So....congratulations Richardsons! Even with the change in location you have obviously worked hard to cement your reputation of having the biggest assholes for wait staff. That must take some doing and I applaud your consistency over the years.   We will never, ever step foot into Richardson's again. There are far too many better restaurants in Phoenix who actually give a shit that you are there. Can't wait to tell everyone I know, and I'm in public relations, to stay the hell away from this place."}
{"text":"First visit and we really enjoyed our experience.   Cheese enchiladas were delicious- spicy and very flavorful.  Waiter was helpful and suggested which sauces the vegetarians would not want to order- he was knowledgeable about the menu and made us feel appreciated.  Cons: the entire lot is valet, and you don't have a choice to opt out, unless you park across the street in someone else's lot.  Also a bit too pricey to visit often, but a nice treat."}
{"text":"What can I say? Food is good and my server Susanna was excellent. However, this place is fit for the Dodge Viper crowd. Bahda boom bahda bing!!! Just can't stand the attitude from top to bottom. Who needs the attempt at East coast attitude in Phoenix. Too bad because the concept and food is good but the tude is a major turn off. Who needs the aggravation?"}
{"text":"The place is nice, the waiters take their time, service is way too slow. I decided to come here after seeing good reviews and was disappointed to find out the food was not that great. I got the enchiladas and both with red and green sauce. The rice tasted funny but the beans were good. I don't think this place is as good as its hyped to be."}
{"text":"I agree with everyone on here who said the food is great but management sucks.  We went in with a gift card we got for our wedding with the person who gave it to us and other friends.  It had never been used and should have had $60 on it--the server came back and said it only had $18 when we were paying the bill.  My husband wanted to handle it discretely because we were with a group, so he paid the server and spoke with the \"manager\" (stupid--he should never have paid until this was resolved).    The guy who bought it pulled up his bank statement on his phone to show he paid $60 and we had never been in there--so there was definitely a \"mistake\" made by the employee who sold it.  The manager did not know what to do and said he would talk to their computer guy when he came in later--it's been 5 DAYS now and no resolution, not even a phone call from the manager to let us know he's on it.  We have had  to call several different managers who all play dumb. I'm sorry, but this is theft--selling an $18 gift card for $60--and poor management for not handling it seriously. Too bad because we had a great brunch but I don't trust the honesty or the competency of people there. DO NOT EVER BUY a gift card from this restaurant.  Update: Filed a complaint against this company with BBB and Attorney General's office."}
{"text":"We go here at least once a week and take all our out of town guests when they are visiting! Green and red chiles are unique and flavorful...the smoked meats are always good. Adovada and New Mexican Platter are our go toos. Mimosas are 5 bucks. Specials are delicious. If you're looking for uniquely special food and ambiance this is a great place!"}
{"text":"I am originally from NM I had been to Richardsons before when they were at a differnt location. I ordered green chili stew then... Potatoes were not fully cooked. That was about 7 years ago. So i decided to give it another chance I love NM food there is nothing better In my opinion. Mexican food just does not compare sooo. My family and I went for easter brunch. ... I ordered green chili stew with eggs over medium, husband ordered chiliquies (sp) daughter ordered a breakfast burro with side potatoes. 3 year old grandson had a pancake. My green chili stew had carrots. ummmm a unnecessary ingredient. It was made with beef, i have always made it with pork. They served me 1 tortilla i asked for a second and i waited and waited and waited.......finally got it it was hard lol. Husbands food had some steak in it and it was burnt he actually said Juliobertos was better that this place. Daughters potatoes were reheated and not good. Pancake and syrup not so great... Perhaps it was because it was right before they ended brunch. Not too sure but service was horrible. Food was not good. Maybe if you've never had authentic green chili stew or chiliquies but i would never recommend this place. I don't know how they have 3 resteraunts that all serve the same food pretty much and how they have remained open for so long."}
{"text":"A friend and her wife brought me here one morning for breakfast because they were convinced it would change my life.... And they were right   I decided to try the Carne Adovada plate (around $16) and it was by far one of the best meals, breakfast or not, that I've ever had. The pork was perfectly cooked and tender, the beans were flavorful, and the eggs and potatoes were delicious. The amount of food was too much for me, so I was happy to have leftovers for dinner. The price is worth it, since it's basically 2 meals in 1.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Bad service.  Bad breakfast.  Eggs were runny.  Bacon was over cooked.  Server had pissy attitude.  They always pretend it is busier than it really is.  Going down hill.  Go to good egg for a great breakfast."}
{"text":"Whenever we're in Phoenix, we make at least one stop at Richardson's. This is our go-to place for New Mexican food. The chiles here are killer, red or green. The New Mexico enchiladas are the perfect chile delivery system. (They'll give you red & green on same plate, but we're partial to the red.) Combined with daily happy hour until 6, what's not to like?  Btw, roasted garlic plate app is great but definitely a big portion. It's a lot for two people to eat and still enjoy full entrees. Rokerij, the sister restaurant next door, is very good, too."}
{"text":"I can't express how excellent the food was...five stars is not enough.  The Chimayo Chicken was one of the best dishes I've ever had....amazing.  Friendly staff and good drinks.   If you haven't tried this place you will be glad when you do."}
{"text":"Wow! What a great restaurant. The food was out of this world! The service was perfect.  We all had a different dish and we were very happy. Can't wait to go back. Be sure and try the appetizer  Roasted Garlic Platter! Like nothing we've tasted.  Their Guacamole was another wow dish."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant for Santa Fe style food.  I took my brother there last week and we both had the carne adovada. The meat is tender and nice and spicy. It is served with pinto beans and rice and tortillas.  The servings are so large, we took some home and had with eggs the next morning.  We also LOVE the prickly pear margaritas. And of course the guacamole and chips and salsa are favorites.  Superb!!"}
{"text":"The waitstaff has come off as fairly miserable on my last few visits.  The food is either not great or inedible due to inaccurately described spiciness levels.  The last time I went, I ordered the chilaquiles off the board.  I know this dish can vary greatly between establishments, but I've had excellent luck up until now and I order it whenever I see it.  It was awful.  Firstly, it came on a plate that was about 2' long.  Thanks for the head's up, waitress.  Secondly, the eggs were so incredibly spicy that I could not eat them.  Any of them.  Since the egg portion of the meal was the size of a regular dinner plate, this was a lot of waste.  The waitress apparently thought so too, because she became agitated when I declined her offer to box it up.    I told her I didn't want them because I couldn't eat them, because they were incredibly goddamned spicy.  She ignored that part and asked me if I would perhaps want to eat them later.  I said I figured they'd still be spicy then.  Then she asked me if I could take them home to someone.  I said I would never give this food to my animals.  THEN SHE TESTILY ASKED IF I KNEW SOMEONE ELSE I COULD GIVE THEM TO.  This B really didn't want to see the food go to waste, but wasn't super concerned that I had just purchased pounds of food that I hated.  I said no, that I wouldn't be ringing up my phone tree to see who likes their eggs with an entire jalapeño, and as she began to angrily suggest yet another option for the reuse of the food, my dining partner interjected and said that jesus christ he would just take the bloody eggs.  Waitress needs to STFU.  Seriously?  Seriously.  This isn't the first time I've been served something I couldn't eat.  I know it's ~Richardson's~, but write \"spicy\" on the goddamned menu when something is spicy.  Just do it.  As for the waitress, sister needs to research some food outreach programs to volunteer for.  She's wasting too much of her vigor being shitty to customers about eggs."}
{"text":"Always great food and great margaritas! Plenty of gluten-free options as well. I love the enchilada, garlic board and the classic dishes."}
{"text":"all i can say is WOW.. food was delicious.  atmosphere was cozy, not very large area, but nice. we had the skewers and calamari for appetizers, and they were flavorful and cooked just perfect.  next came the main dish,  oh my,  i ordered the chicken burrito and chili relleno, and it was enough to feed my two kids and myself.  hubbs ordered the tenderloin medallions,,, again just perfect.  staff was very friendly  we will be back"}
{"text":"I think the 3 1/2 stars for this place is right on the mark.  The new Richardson's will always be compared to the old one, and it doesn't quite hit the mark (yet).  Perhaps it was because we were seated before the customary 2 coctail standing wait at the old place, but the new place didn't have the same vibe.   On the plus side, they offer a number of seafood dishes, and know how to properly cook fish.    It was relaxed and the service at the bar was good.  They also have a decent selection of $5 wines for happy hour.  I think once the place is getting more traffic the atmosphere will improve."}
{"text":"The food was good but OVERPRICED.  The setup was exactly like the old spot.  I thought the old location forced them into a cramped space but apparently,  they like it that way.  Service was good.  The $12 specialty margaritas DID NOT produce a buzz and I COULD NOT taste the tequila. Yes, I SAID IT, 12 DOLLARS!!  (Pint size with ice)  I guess if i order a $12 drink, I expect to taste some liquor in it and it should probably come in a giant margarita glass, like at Arriba's.  I think that the owners are cheap and trying to lure a snooty crowd that likes to show their friends how to properly waste some perfectly good money!!!  I had been to the old location several times.  Won't find me coming back to the new location though.  You've failed to retain an old customer.  Oh,  and the valet parking is just irritating. I walked out and there's my car, parked 20 feet away, and I gotta wait for the guy to get it for me?  All those blue cones are enough to piss ya off!!  What other place in Phoenix is like this?  I had a hard time finding my way out!!"}
{"text":"Great food and portions. Parking can be rough, but tolerable. Service is always solid!"}
{"text":"Food-great, service-a joke  The food and atmosphere at richardsons is FANTASTIC! I ordered the chimayo chicken and was very pleasantly surprised and the scallops as an appetizer were amazing. That's where the positive experience ended.... We had a reservation at 7:00pm and were greeted very pleasantly, however, just after receiving our bill while having conversation and unfinished cocktails, we were approached at 8:25pm asking us to leave as they had another group. But don't worry, we were offered sopapillas upon our next visit."}
{"text":"This is a great new mexican restaurant for Arizona. I am from New Mexico so I am pretty particular. We had good service and both the green and red chile was good but I really loved the flavor of the green. We will be going back."}
{"text":"This was the worst experience EVER!! It is never a good start when on the Menu it is written \"If you order it you eat it\" To start those of us that drank soda had to send our drinks back more than once since they pour them out of 2 liters and it is flat and watered down.  Our waiter seemed clueless and a little like a deer in headlights when ever we asked about any menu item. For and example we asked what the size difference was for the large and small guacamole his answer was \"Well you know the small is well a small bowl and the Large is like a large bowl\"   When ordering a few in the group let him know that they did not like spicy food and asked what the best choice was and he directed them to the enchiladas with Red Chili Sauce. Four out of the seven of us ordered that and when the food was served it was so spicy they could not eat and and told the waiter and his response was \"do you want me to box it up for you\" No they were still hungry.   When we asked to see the manager the response was nobody new where he was and didn't know when he would be back.   He finally showed up 15 min later and would not exchange the food or comp for the uneaten meals and said that we should have seen the note on the menu that states \"If you order it you eat it\" and he does not know why the waiter would have told them the red chili enchilada's where not spicy because they were VERY spicy.   The service is awful and the food is Spicy and any restaurant that does not even try to make a customer happy is not worth the trip.   Way over priced and they treat you like crap!!"}
{"text":"New Mexican cuisine done right- this is the original of trifecta of restaurants (rokerij and dicks hideaway) that have similar menus.  A cozy patio entrance greets visitors in a warm welcoming way.  After 2 visits off peak times we have had no wait. I recommend the happy hour from 3-6 as most appetizers are a few dollars off.  A decent house margarita sets my mood with a happening bar area and fast moving staff.  Brooke did a great job on our recent visit.  She knows a lot about the dishes and can answer any questions that one may have.  So many great specials this evening including a cheese steak option!  We are in a Mexican mood every day so we order a beef chili relleño and smoked chicken toastadas.  Very crispy shells with yummy chicken and a salad atop- could have benefitted from a salsa or aioli.  The relleno was super classic on a grill pan with yummy bubbly sauce and delicious cheese.  Sharing the adovada was a smart move on our part.  You can substitute the rice and beans for a veggie or salad so we did a salad. This keeps the meal light because the red chili pork is very smoky and flavorful but a generous portion.  We loved it!  We did not hear about desserts and this is my one regret after dining at Richardsons.  We had 2 drinks each and everything came to about $75 for 2 people."}
{"text":"SHORT VERSION:  MAJOR disappointment tonight.    Just paid $52 for 2 Pasta Heidi's (online menu says $22 each but they are now $24 each) from \"Richardson's\" when the EXACT SAME ITEM at \"Rokerij\" is $18.  Received horrendous service from Richardson's tonight.   FULL VERSION:  First off, it really kills me to write this.  My husband and I loved this place and met here often for dinner after work.  It's been a gem for us but I'm not sure we will go back after tonight.  My husband ordered 2 Pasta Heidi's to go tonight for our dinner tonight.  Nothing else.  No sides, no drinks, nada.   It's pretty far out of our way for a to-go order (from our house) but we were craving this delicious dish from Richardson's/Rokerij big time so we were more than willing to make the trek.  However, when my husband was about to sign for the bill, he noticed something felt off.  It was much more expensive than we normally pay.  He asked if the prices went up and the gal mentioned she wasn't sure, but that maybe it was because we had called the Richardson's phone number and not the Rokerij number. He then went to the Rokerij side and checked out their menu.   Mind you, as many people who eat here know, there is a lot of carry over between the two.  In essence you can order many of the same items from one vs the other.  Heck, they even use the same font and menu layout!  Sure enough, he was right.  There was a $6 price difference for the exact same item.  He asked about it and a male server said they had just had this conversation with management last week because it doesn't make any sense and people have mentioned it.   My husband then walked back over to the Richardson's side and asked to speak to someone about it since it must just be a mistake.  Our meal was literally $12 more at Richardson's for no real reason.    After explaining the issue with the lady he was directed to (wish we had gotten her name) all she said \"I don't know anything about that\" and that \"it is what it is\" with a very condescending tone.  She neglected to offer any assistance to explore or amend the issue and smugly shrugged at him like he was crazy.  For the record, if this were a mere couple dollar difference we wouldn't have bothered, but $12 is a pretty big difference.  At the end of the day our experience was a seasoned patron's nightmare and it breaks my heart to share this story.  If you absolutely must have the Pasta Heidi, save yourself some frustration and money by ordering it at Rokerij.  Please see my photos for proof.  Both are menu screen caps from their website.   Both documents are dated 6.30.14, which indicates this is an issue they've probably known about for a while and haven't bothered to correct."}
{"text":"I've been going to Richardson's since 1995.  Yes, I have.  That was 1.  before the place burned down,  2.  when they had a separate pizza menu with 25 delicious zzas that they served until 1 a.m.   3.  they had a short-glass full of loose cigarettes at the bar that patrons could just help themselves to  4.  when they'd serve free appetizer bites to folks around the bar  5. you could park your OWN car, and enter through the secret door in the back, and 6.  when the staff weren't jerks and appreciated the customer.  That's the part that gets me about this place now.  The food....great.  It's unique.  Try finding anything else like it anywhere, except New Mexico. I dare you.  Portions are ridiculous. You pay for it, but you can spend $20 easy for dinner at Red Lobster.  And this is no Red Lobster.  The atmosphere...great too.  Music is usually spot on. The place is comfortable. I like the no-windows thing, especially in the summer....it's cave-like.  The staff....jackasses.  Look, I know there's a line out the door, but you're still in the hospitality business.  So quit making me feel like i've got some-nerve asking to eat here. Get over yourself.  It's your jobbbbbbbbbb.......  I will say this, the cooks are some of the hardest working folks I've ever seen.  They are machines, and work magic in that tiny kitchen...somehow never running into one another. So, bravo cooks, keep it up.  So, go.  Just don't expect to feel welcomed."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. $39 Lamb chops had no flavor, $39 Sea Bass was sugary and gross, vegetable were way overcooked and soggy. Service was slow and bad. I don't understand why this place is so busy, I will never go back."}
{"text":"I have reviewed Richardson's before, but I wanted to give a quick update on Happy Hour. We came from seeing a play at Phoenix Theatre and wanted to grab a quick bite. I had always heard about the happy hour, but never caught it before.   Turns out that we were very lucky! During happy hour the small plates are $5, glasses of wine at $5, and draft beers at $5. This makes the place fairly reasonable. As for the food, we had Green Chili Sliders (outstanding), Carne Adovada Sliders (outstanding), Chicken Skewers (darn good), and Tostadas (crunchy and tasty). There are maybe 4 or 5 more things you can choose from.   The only hitch is you have to sit at the bar or in the cove (a closed in patio area). Small price to pay.  N*Joy..."}
{"text":"The food and service was amazing. A few dollars more than usual but, the quality was well worth it. It has a great vibe and comfortable environment.  Three seperate businesses entities squeezed into one building was a bit confusing and unnecessary and leads to confusion.   On the downside, the valet parking is stupid, pretentious, and completely without value to the customer!!"}
{"text":"My friend invited me for lunch with friends since I know my New Mexican food and  amazingly, I haven't been here yet after a decade in the valley. I judge every New Mexican restaurant by their carne adovada, the signature dish of northern New Mexico besides the green chile cheeseburger and sopapilla.  Sitting outsude is a choice to be weighted heavily given the weather. Nice for evenings but not for lunch in the summer unless you're under the misters. You might THINK you'll be OK in the shade... We ate outside on the patio for Sunday lunch.  Anyway service was nice but somewhat inefficient. The beertaps were 10 feet away but our server went inside, I guess to add the order as well as have it filled. It took a while to bring back the incorrect beer. Anchor Steam and Lagunitas IPA are the saving graces for beer. Anchor Steam was served at first in a Hoegaarten 330ml glass.  This is UNDER 12 ounces for $5.75.  UNACCEPTABLE. Don't accept the \"premium beer\" line, get a big boy glass. My next one I asked for a big boy glass. I tried my friend's bloody mary and it tasted totally righteous - this isn't a mellow V-8 tomato soup pillow! Garnishes vary, you might get a mushroom, you might get a celery stick...  Our appetizer was served without silverware or napkins. Asked for silverware from manager.  My main was carne adovada with eggs. The plate had an excellent eye appeal and was served extremely hot. You'll need to be prepared for this as all hot plates are served ON A HOT METAL PLATE. BEWARE. You're warned by me as well as the server.  So how was the carne adovada? Not technically accurate or traditional. The meat was smoked (they have a smoker and a woodpile out back), and this is not usually done in New Mexico - the pork is usually marinated overnight before being slow cooked for several hours and the fat rendered out. Here at Richardson's not all the fat was rendered out and this made for some sort of funk in one bite, and the smoke flavor was to the point of ashtray on another few bites. Mean and in between though was a nice smoky style to the carne adovada but it seemed overpowering.  Good CA has a depth of flavor in the red chile sauce with the other ingredients.   It also came with beans and the flavor was great and out of the ordinary. The potatoes were plain and so were the scrambled eggs (eggs are made to order, you don't HAVE to get scrambled.)  I guess we have to sit inside for decent and accurate service, but I'll give another dish a chance."}
{"text":"I have been eating at Richardson's since the early 90's and I have to say I've never had a bad meal.  Sometimes the servers can demonstrate a bit of an attitude but the overall experience is generally very good."}
{"text":"We have been to this restaurant many times over the years and the food is usually pretty good, but not great. You also have to accept the inevitable explosive stomach pains the next day. It's spicy going in and just as spicy on the way out. From a hospitality standpoint, if I could give this place no stars for customer service and humility, I would.  They really make it apparent after a couple of times dining here that they think very highly of their menu, but in a bad, pretentious way. The wait staff are never overly warm and almost snoody. We thought this was just a fluke, but almost every time turned out to be the same experience. On our last experience, which was the straw that broke the camels back, our family officially swore off this place. Having out of town guests and being nearby to the restaurant, we wanted to let them experience this type of cuisine. We called in to check wait times and they told us come on in and that there was no wait. Upon getting there literally 5 minutes later and basically being obligated to park VIP, which in and of itself is totally ridiculous, the hostess asked if we had a reservation and then acted like I was crazy when I told her we were told to come right over. The restaurant wasn't even busy, but she told us it would be a 30-45 minute wait. We then requested a highchair, which they told us they do not have. Highchairs are not available inside or on the patio we were told, also known as \"children are not welcome\". Really?!? I mean, lets be real...there are a million other restaurants where I can choose to spend my money and introduce new people too. I will not be giving my service to a restaurant that does not take the effort to return it back to its customers."}
{"text":"Richardson's has great, unique food, and definitely a fun vibe. I am excited to go again.   I think it's important to note that it is a bit dark, cramped and loud at times. This would not normally be a problem, but I went with my grandparents and this was a bit of a problem, because it was very difficult to see the menu and steps in the restaurant, and hear each other.   I'd recommend this place more for an outing with friends, to grab dinner and drinks, and less of a quiet family dinner kind of place."}
{"text":"The ambiance and location saves this place from zero stars.  Food wasn't good at all, specially for the price. Guac was boring and chunky with unexpected (and unpleasant) textures.  The chips were oily although the salsas were good.  I had the angel hair chilly pasta with shrimp. The shrimp were good but the pasta was packed with alfredo sauce and no hint of spiciness at all.  I tried my friend's lamb rack and it was boring and flavorless.   Besides the great company and great place ambiance wise, the food doesn't worth the visit.  I'll give this place a try someday soon with hopes that it was just a bad day because the setting and ambiance are really nice.   Public service: servings are humongous, so don't over order."}
{"text":"Had heard great things about Richardson's New Mexican food and finally went.  Definitely did not live up to the hype! Tasteless, watered-down margueritas (both regular and prickly pear), rude and inattentive service, waiter strongly suggested both couples split food, then only brought one tortilla for each entrée and no extra plate, waiter acted very annoyed when we asked for more toast to go with our Roasted Garlic appetizer. Entrée was sooo hot it was inedible. Never asked if we needed anything or how the food was.  Very disappointing, will not return."}
{"text":"I like the style of food and the ingredients. Bueno \"New Mexico Chilis\".  The atmosphere is awesome for hanging out and the beer selection is fair. Valet park only helps you get on with the good stuff. Cheers"}
{"text":"I love this place.  It's consistent, it has great flavor and a myriad of options.  I never get bored eating here.  I sometimes just get an appetizer and that is PLENTY of food."}
{"text":"This place is good but it gets over-hyped.  Good Land o' Enchantment-style cuisine. Hot Hatch and Anaheim peppers make most of their menu items awesome.  Even the burger is decent.  But like going to an over-hyped movie this restaurant makes you leave feeling ripped off. I'll give it another try in the future."}
{"text":"Visiting the area for work and had not found a great place to eat until now. Food is wonderful! What a great patio and dinning area. Service wa great. The carnitas are spicy but excellent and prepared the right way! I will return to try more dishes"}
{"text":"We went to Richardson's last night because we had some family in town and wanted to treat them to a nice dinner.   They did not disappoint. I had the fish special which had swordfish, mahi mahi and salmon and it was simply delightful. For some of the older folks in my family some of the menu was off-limits because of the spiciness but that's not true for me!   I will be visiting this establishment again and suggest you do too, if you have a few extra bucks. (A little pricey)"}
{"text":"My boyfrined and I went here on Monday night and loved it! He had a pizza and I had a wonderful chicken dish (the name escapes me right now) stuffed with spinach and a wonderful roasted onion sauce, it also came with amazing mashed sweet poatoes and veggies.  I have a gluten allergy and our server Nick was very helpful in finding out what I could and couldn't eat. He was super nice and patient with us-we kept having to ask for more time to order because everything looked so good haha!  This resturant is very romantic, the service is good and I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"We came to Richardson's/Dick's Hideaway for brunch during my whirlwind trip to pay court to Vicki and Enzo.  Brunch is the whitest of meals and it is something I often look forward to with glee.   When you get to the restaurant you'll notice that it is very small and you'll be seated family/European style (sitting with people you may not know because there is space at the table).  If that's not your bag of tricks there is a bagel shop across the street that is home to many fond memories for me and is a perfect substitute.  The room is decorated like a dusty wine cellar and is a dusty wine cellar, there was a wood fire warming the room and the set up was charming.   It took us longer to order than it did for us to decide where to go, get ready, and leave the house.  This wasn't because we couldn't decide what to eat but the waiter - I didn't catch his name but I'm thinking this is his hideaway - took forever to bring our drinks, take our order, argued with Enzo and spoke to him in a dismissive tone, lacked personality, and was fairly rude (no thank you, just walked away when Enzo was speaking).  The other thing I didn't like was kitchen door that would forcefully swing open around where people were walking.  If your kitchen door doesn't have a window and there is a chance people may be moving around it then it's a solid idea to open it gently.    I had the breakfast burrito \"Christmas style\" which meant green and red chilies.   I'll be straight up pedantic and point out that Advent and Christmas' liturgical colors are white and purple, green and red are used other times .  It was good.  The terrible service didn't distract from the good food - and sometimes it can.  My friends enjoyed their food as well.    I wouldn't suggest this place if bad service, crowded seating, or dust, bother you.  If you're cool with this or you're pretentious this will be right up your alley."}
{"text":"During a short trip to Phoenix, Richardson's got on the list of must go to restaurants. The reservation was made and the pictures of platings had been viewed several times over... Needless to say we were excited to go.   On first impression the place and atmosphere is extraordinary, the dim lighting made us all look really good and the waitress was one of those that didn't need to wright your order down. This is the reason that I didn't give less stars.   The food was not so good. I listened to a radio broadcast recently where Steve Wells (a famous food critic from the NYT) talked about how Instagram and the Internet had changed the way chefs think about presentation rather then actual flavor profiles. The dish I had was a perfect example of this. I ordered a steak - can't remember the name of the actual dish but I looked amazing. My mouth actually started salivating when food came mainly because I had saved myself all day for this moment. And then... I took a bite. Nothing tasted as good as it looked. The steak was chewy and l was simply dissatisfied.   If your thinking about visiting this restaurant I encourage you to go. I'm better for having gone once in my life then never having gone at all. It may be that southwestern cuisine doesn't move me, however, the visit and atmosphere is worth a peek."}
{"text":"This place has a great atmosphere but the food fell flat.  We would have loved to have some actual flavor but someone forgot to add that"}
{"text":"I love the food here and try to eat at one of the Richardson Places when I'm in town.  It's a little pricey. Tonight was unfortunately not as good as every other time. Service wasn't great, appetizer took a long time to come out of the kitchen but I must say it was worth the wait. I love the roasted garlic plate and so does everyone I recommend it to. Chicken was cold in my burro and by the time the server came around I was full from eating around it.  She did ask if we wanted something else but didn't want to wait.  I will definitely be back on my next trip and hope it's a 5 star experience."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here twice now. The first experience was great. The service was good the food was terrific. However, our most recent visit not so much. The food was good but the service was sub-par. It started with the parking, there is a sign that says complimentary valet, no one came out to get the car. When we walked into the Richardson's side a kid who looked like the host was not helpful. He told us there were no tables but offered no other information. We found a table on our own at the outside bar. The atmosphere was great.  The server took a long time to approach and again gave us no information until we asked. She walked away and we had to ask another employee to find her for to take our order. Like I said the food was good but the service could have been better."}
{"text":"This is our favorite restaurant in the valley. The menu changes often with great specials. The food is spicy New Mexican which is fantastic. We have never had a bad meal. It's very busy but worth the wait. The prime rib is our favorite."}
{"text":"Tonight we visited Richardsons for my sons birthday. Another great meal after many over several years at this wonderful restaurant. Jason was our server and took extra time to explain options on the menu that we had never considered. We started with chips, salsa and their homemade guacamole. Followed by crab empanadas  . All were delicious.  We enjoyed the Seabass special that was accompanied with vegetables and their delicious potato stuffed in a green chili. My husband enjoyed the Taos trio that included grilled shrimp, sausages, and a delicious quesadilla. My son had one of their specialties for which they are known for, pork arcavado. Delicious. We finish this fantastic meal with a delicious salon. Nothing compares to it and any other restaurant. This southwest restaurant and  is a must for people who enjoy food with a bite and Southwest flare. Thanks Jason to adding to a really spectacular dinner experience"}
{"text":"It had been a while since I'd been to Richardson's and not since it moved to the new location in combination with The Rokerij. Maybe it's because the now two times I've visited recently I've sat at the bar ( and am only reviewing based on those experiences, admittedly ), maybe it's just that I have too much bias from my memories of the old location but it's just not the same. While we were able to park our own car today, the usual mandatory valet requirement is a huge turn off.   The bar at the old Richardson's was a comfortable, friendly place you wanted to hang out at with friends, the restaurant was usually busy, vibrant and fun; you didn't much mind the wait to sometimes get in. Now it just feels like a bar. The interior here is impressive and frankly pretty cool, but the feel is different. A usual staple, the Prickly Pear margarita, is much too sweet now and seems to have not much kick to it. I'll stick to the nice wine or beer selection from now on if I return.    What does remain is that distinct aroma of wood-fired goodness promised within but I'll reserve comment on that as well until I try more of the menu; I did sample the calamari, which I enjoyed a lot but wasn't crazy about the sweet dipping sauce. I expect the food is still pretty good though overall the prices seem a bit high in general. The staff has been generally friendly but not overly enthusiastic.   I will very likely update this review some time in the future once I put more time in here, try out the restaurant proper and maybe the Rokerij. Still, to me, the character is decidedly different and I'm not sure whether that's good or not.  May have to see how Dick's Hideaway has fared since...."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere and superb margarita. I splurged and went with the $1 up charge for their new tequila and it tasted so smooth. The food is not at all comparable for spice level as Los Dos Molinos, but the ambiance was a lot nicer. Thanks!"}
{"text":"If you are the person that doesn't like a noisy place then Richardson's isn't for you. And if you're craving for a Mexican or Italian food, this is definately not a good place to go to.  We ordered their signature Mexican food and we we're disappointed because the taste was not appetizing at all. It was too salty and a the meat was a bit chewy.  I'm not sure if we would come back in this place."}
{"text":"Adore this place, seriously fabulous times spent here.   A+ - Ambience. Dimly lit, Architecturally comfortable, Open yet intimate seating A+ - Crowd. Meet great people here; professional, classy, intriguing  A+ - Service. They'll seat you where you prefer and will never leave your glass empty (;  A+ - Menu. Amazing food. Simple yet different and delicious. Fun to try something new, they always serve fab specials. Extensive wine list, Happy Hour has 1/2 half bottles!!   Go here when you're in Phx, Az"}
{"text":"My all time favorite. Absolute best steak and eggs Benedict in town. Service is always great. The wait is sometimes a little longer than I would like but that goes to show that people are willing to wait.   Great margaritas."}
{"text":"The food is great. We've  been eating here for 20 some years. The music could be louder, I don't talk politics when I go out for dinner, nor do I want to hear anyone else's views."}
{"text":"This is the best place in the valley for cuisine that is from New Mexico. The portions are Enormous but totally bomb. I love how little the restaurant is with its character and dark feel. It is very unique and has its own vibe. I want to come back for brunch because the menu looks glorious. Highly recommend if you are hungry and want some authentic food."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Great food, beautiful patio, AMAZING service. My roommate and I stopped in for breakfast a couple weeks ago. We got a few Mimosas and the Carne Adovada Eggs Benedict. In addition to the delicious food, our server Chris was so accommodating and fun.   Would recommend to anyone in PHX. Will be going for dinner in the near future!"}
{"text":"Oh Richardson's, how I love thee. Once again you blow my mind and taste buds.   This has been my favorite restaurant in Phoenix for years. I remember the first time I visited the the original restaurant and my frequent visits to the one of the three variations, always amazing. I love the little touches,  the gcp- green Chile potato, the way your dinner comes with a flour tortilla buried below sweet and spicy sauces and is just the right stuff to sop up every last ounce of flavor. The fresh tomatillo salsa and of course the green chiles found throughout. Tonight was once again fantastic and as I've never commented, I felt this time it was right.   We sat at the bar,  service was quick. Drinks delicious. Ordered tomatillo toast, roasted garlic and the taos combo- tonight the adovado quesadilla, bacon wrapped shrimp and new mexico sausages. Superb. Flavors are so on. Not just your typical southwestern restaurant by any stretch. I've never been to New Mexico and I can't comment on authenticity to their cuisine, but I can say the originality, combination, flavor burst, portion size are to die for. My friend was blown away. To quote...\"i wanted a quesadilla, but this is the best meal I've had in ages\", and yes it was. This place has been cooking for 20 some years, maybe more and still crushing it, for good reason: the food is unbelievable and the experience legit, not playbook. Take that sam fox.  Keep on being awesome Richardson. Still my favorite restaurant in Phoenix by far."}
{"text":"Great food!  Had one of the specials of the day... Pinenut crusted halibut which I had them smother with the green chili sauce...it was amazing!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to Richardson's a few times, and have yet to leave without having a great meal. It is definitely a Phoenix staple, and a great example that you don't have to sacrifice quality for quantity. The atmosphere is top notch, and the service is hard to beat.   Richardson's is definitely aware of their value, so don't be surprised with a bill a bit pricier than your neighborhood go-to. Don't fret it, as this will probably be your future pick for date night for every date night to come.  Personal favorite: Chicken New Mexico Enchiladas with red sauce. Chips and the habanero verde salsa to start."}
{"text":"This place always looks packed at night time, and someone in my party used to love the restaurant's food. Decided to go for a late lunch, & received mediocre service in an obviously slow time for the servers- we were one of maybe three parties in the whole restaurant. Our food came out after what seemed like a long wait for the amount of business they had at the time, & appeared to have been sitting under a hot lamp for longer than it should have.. The beans & rice were bone dry & crispy. The enchilada sauce was half dried up, with it's accompanying enchiladas stuck to the plate. Overall, the food was terrible, especially for the price! I've had really great tex mex before, and Richardson's flopped in comparison. And with barely there service, I would not recommend this restaurant for tex mex. You can definitely do MUCH better."}
{"text":"Great food, decent prices... the pizza here is really good. A very relaxed, quiet, romantic scene to take a date."}
{"text":"Always a huge fan of Richardsons/Dick's Hideaway. I went with the green chile meatloaf with eggs, $12. Very well done meatloaf with just the right amount of heat, awesome with over easy eggs! I also put back a few bloody Mary's with a beer back, nice touch! Overall, a great meal."}
{"text":"Richardson's is amazing New Mexican food. Michelle, our waitress was very informative and friendly!  The portions are huge and delicious.  We went for brunch and the menu is full of breakfast items as well as other seafood items. Great mimosas too!"}
{"text":"Excellent place to eat while visiting the area for a wedding. Very good food and reasonable prices. Only real negative was our server only checked on our table 1 or 2 times and we had to wait about 20 minutes to get the bill."}
{"text":"Really, really good food.  Went here for brunch, sat on the outdoor covered patio, and drank cheap mimosas!  I love the New Mexico style of food and great selection of seafood as well.  Good service.  Amazing place overall."}
{"text":"My first experience with Richardson's was actually at the Rokerij.  When I finally got to eat in their newly redone restaurant I became a fan FOR LIFE. My boyfriend and I decided to try to get in last minute on a Saturday night, which in hindsight, was a ridiculous thought. However, on the way out a manager flagged us down and encouraged us to take advantage of their tables in the bar. This actually worked out perfectly and wasn't offered to us by the hostess, but I will most definitely look to sit in that 'hidden' area again.  I ordered their signature dish, the Pasta Heidi, and OH MY GOD. Insane. I didn't understand how pasta could be what put them on the map, but SERIOUSLY this was so good. Green chili pasta, grilled chicken, a yummy cream sauce all served on top of a tortilla. I crave this on a regular basis now.  Great ambiance with big tables which make me want to host a big dinner their just to utilize the cute space.   This place is a must, just think about maybe making reservations ahead of time."}
{"text":"Green chile stew is to die for. Complimentary valet parking. Great place for a date night and the customer service has been on point every time I come here (often). Outdoor seating on the patio with an outside bar and indoor seating with great lighting. The food has been amazing every time I order but as I said you cannot go wrong with the green chile stew. Definitely an all time Phoenix fevorite."}
{"text":"Happy hour is amazing the chicken salad and flatbread top notch"}
{"text":"Excellent food. The chili relleno and eggs were outstanding. My girl had the avodoba Benedict and that was very good as well. 6 people are couple of drinks and the tab was 150 so not bad. We will be back"}
{"text":"Best restaurant ever!  Never had a bad dish and the staff is great. I've been coming here for over 20 years and it still remains one of my favorites. I recommend everything!"}
{"text":"OMG great service, great lighting/atmosphere, and great food. I can't wait for it to cool off so we can also hang out on the gorgeous patio between Richardson's and their subsidiary restaurant Rokerij."}
{"text":"Love the reverse happy hour...5 stars there  Yet, my first time for dinner trying to show a little bit of phoenix to an out of town guest was a disappointment. We walked in and no one greeted us, then we waiting 10 minutes and some seconds for a server. This is after 2 people came to the table to say our server would be with us soon. Drinks, chips and dip, even water would have been nice as we waited. THEN....we waited again after we got drinks to order our dinner.  But WOW, the food was great. Yes I'd go back. The food rocked!"}
{"text":"The 3.5 star rating baffles me.  Maybe people aren't ordering the right menu items.  I come to Phoenix about once a year and usually find a way to eat here 2-3 times.  It's simply the best southwest food I have ever had.  This isn't Mexican, this is southwest.  There is a huge difference.  I several times debated making the 300+ mile drive simply to eat the Carne Adovada and then drive home.  It's that good.  Also, the Carne Adovada Benedict is great for breakfast, the orange juice is fresh squeezed.  I am sure there is also a Carne Adovada Flan that is to die for.  If you can get an appetizer with carne adovada, you should try that too."}
{"text":"For starters, it's dark as hell inside. They never asked if we wanted to be indoors or out. That sucked. Ambience and design is cool. Lots of dark wood, bright copper and adobe. Our server was very good and attentive.  My draught beer was flat but I left it at that. Ordered only one.  I can't stand booth seating unless at a diner so I was somewhat uncomfortable the entire time.  Food was good. I got the tacos ala carte. Pork and the tilapia were very good but the lamb was nasty grizzly.  Rice and beans were tasty and cooked just right.  My one daughter's brick oven pizza was well liked and my other daughter's skewers were great. My wife's shrimp quesadilla was over the top great according to her but she was buzzed! I'd say Richardson's would be an excellent place to bring or meet friends but as for families or business clients, not so."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, margaritas and New Mexican food .... and free valet!   But tip your valet guy, of course ha!"}
{"text":"Very cool atmosphere. Five of us had brunch. Everything was very tasty and the portions were huge.  Would like to go back without kids and enjoy the multiple bars."}
{"text":"This isn't your cheap Mexican food joint around the corner, but it's also not your haute Spanish fusion fine dining. What you get is a relaxed and unpretentious environment, large portions and good food.  Had dinner here with my wife and some friends. It's a good sized space inside, though there can be a wait during peak times. But they have a nice covered patio bar area where you can wait and grab a drink. The portions are huge. My wife and I shared the Carne Adovada and Chimayo Chicken, and probably had a full serving left over to take home. The Carne Adovada has a little kick to it with the red chili sauce, but the smoked pork is succulent and delicious. My wife thought the Chimayo Chicken was a bit too heavy for her liking, but I thought it was delicious. I'm looking forward to the leftovers :-)"}
{"text":"Hubs and I didn't have a reservation like we needed to get a good table. Our fault.  So we ended up at the bar, and we were lucky to get those seats; this place fills up fast.   The food is excellent quality authentic.  The ambiance is dark, with only candles for lighting, leather booths that looked really comfy. So make reservations and enjoy."}
{"text":"My friend and I went in for brunch because it was recommended by a few friends and...wow! We both loved it! 5.00 mimosas and bloody Mary's?! So good.  Nothing about Richardsons was lacking. The service was great, the prices are fair for the quality of food and the atmosphere is awesome! Love the copper and dim lighting.  Sunday brunch at Richardsons is my new go-to.  Also, the outside bar is a nice touch and the bartenders are always easy going and creative enough to make you speciality drinks. -I only say this because I am allergic to syrups, but they always seem to substitute the syrups without sacrificing the flavor so I am able to enjoy it!   Definitely get patio seating and ask for Max or Adam !!!! - best service from those two."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots to accompany my wife too. The hammered copper bar top is cool while the ambiance is just plane awesome in this New Mexican cuisine restaurant. We usually start with their Chips, salsa, and guacamole while I get a beer on tap. The wife gets a prickly pear margarita or a glass of wine from their great and reasonably priced wine list.  Although I have tried just about everything in the menu and many of their specials, I find myself going back to the chile rellenos platter. They offer two chiles stuffed with one of their several different stuffings. I like to mix it up and get one topped with red sauce while the other topped with green sauce. My wife is from NM, and she has stated many times that this is by far the best spot in AZ for NM styled food."}
{"text":"First time here and everything has a flavor profile that is very New Mexican authentic. The appetizer, the roasted garlic plate was a leap of faith for me as it sounded like nothing I would normally order but I was feeling a bit on the adventurous side. When it arrived I was not only surprised, my taste buds were blown away. I highly recommend the plate when you have about 4 of your friends or family to assist in taking that plate on. Now on to my main course, I opted for one of the specials of the night, a bone in prime with new Mexican Chile sauce and a cheese graded over it. Plus a sweet potatoes puree, twice baked in a poblano pepper along with a roasted vegetable medley that was equally agreeable. In a word \"delicious\" now on to the sweets and closer of the meal. Our choice was the flourless chocolate cake and a creme brulé, both were fantastic and truly they both were standouts but we combined the two for a couple of spoonfuls and wow. Service was exceptional and the ice tea, yes just iced tea was also fresh brewed and all around I recommend eating here at least once in your life."}
{"text":"Lots of good breakfast places in the greater Phoenix area.  I finally got to Richardson's to try theirs, and I'm sorry I didn't make it sooner.  Now I want to work through their entire brunch menu.  I had the Adovada Benedict.  Outstanding, and something I'd never find back home.  It's not really a trip to the Phoenix area if you don't stop for at least one meal here."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints. I love the food especially as it's on the spicy side. They have a large selection of southwestern style steak & seafood.   I ordered the Taos Tenderloin, which is 3 medallions, each with a different sauce. The meal comes with a salad. The main dish is served on a tortilla with beans and a green chile potato (GCP). The meat was so tender! One of the best places in town for spicy food that's not the usual Mexican style cuisine."}
{"text":"Decided to take my wife to Richardsons  after I went there with friends two weeks ago. Didn`t disappoint. Food and service were excellent again. This is becoming one of my favorite places. I can see why it`s been around for 30 years it`s great."}
{"text":"Food is amazing. Staff is not. Been there two times and they got an order wrong on both visits. The wait staff were rigid and not accommodating to questions asked about the menu. They're not rude or terrible; just make you tilt your head and wonder what's up with the people in this place?"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The atmosphere is nice and the new Mexican food is amazing. I'm a big fan of the tenderloin Benedict. Nom."}
{"text":"We celebrated a family birthday here.    Richardson's staff made it as wonderful as twenty years of memories there could have aspired to.  The New Mexico platter was absolutely the epitome of New Mexican Cuisine.  Our native New Mexican was impressed with the adovada entree.  My chorizo pork chop was simply amazing.  Nothing in New Mexico was on this level of service and flavor.  All said another wonderful visit to Richardson's."}
{"text":"So me and a lady friend stopped here for a night out a month back.   We arrived, there seemed to be no self parking or maybe I'm just not aware of it. Because it was just valet at the front. So i of course had to valet it. Which to me is odd. I'm not a huge fan of a valet service. I'm a big boy, I'll park my own fucking vehicle, FOR FREE. But whatev's.   I tried to bypass that. We entered and found a both near the bar. The food is a mix/hybrid/fusion of mexican-new mexican food.   I forgot what I had at the time. But I remember it being REALLY REALLY good. We also shared a great bottle of red wine that our server recommended to us.   The service was awesome, the food was amazing. A bit pricy, but like i've said before. You get what you pay for.   Definitely a place to check out, a wonderful date environment."}
{"text":"No happy hour on valentines day - really, the sign at the door says happy hour everyday!  The food and service is great, Managment not so much- boo"}
{"text":"******* 1 star service/ 4 star food ******  What a nightmare!!! What was supposed to be a birthday meal meal for a friend, quickly turned out to be a sideshow...  When we asked the waitress if the special of the night \"green chile pasta\" had seafood, she adamantly stated no. When asked what type of pasta it was made with she had no clue. She the proceeded to inch her way over to the next table of diners and poke them for the answer. After much debate the patrons determined it was a rice noodle. This was very uncomfortable for all parties.   2 of us received our meals. When Our birthday friend received his pasta special... It was decorated with shrimp. We specifically asked about seafood due to allergies and were told no seafood was included. When we advised our server that we could not accept the meal due to the seafood, she shrugged us off and said she would send over the waitress. Once the waitress arrived we explained the allergy situation again and advised her that this could not be eaten... Instead of apologizing for her error, she asked if we wanted them to \"remove\" the shrimp??? We stated to her that it would need to be remade. With some resistance she took the plate. 10 minutes later a shrimp free version arrived.  Our birthday guest had to wait 10 more minutes than we did to receive his food. We opted to eat our dishes, otherwise, we would have had cold dishes ourselves....  The total bill for this event was $ 154.00 + tax. I tipped the waitress $40.00 as a courtesy as I was advised she split tips with the busboy and server- who very polite and on point.  I proceeded to email Richardsons to advise of the experience. It has been 2 + weeks and not a word from this restaurant. I was not looking for anything except an apolgy and ownership for ruining a birthday celebration.  This restaurant is far from a 3 star service level... What a shame as the food is exceptional. Recognizing that the entire experience is key when charging $25.00 + price points for meal is a must in this competitive market.  Stick to Barrio Cafe as they have the formula for success down. I will never eat here again and route all co-workers, family and friends elsewhere."}
{"text":"Everything I had was wonderful during two visits.  The Chipotle ribs were to die for - perfect spice and loads of flavor.  The New Mexico spiced sausage were also a wonderful balance of spice and flavor and accompanied with some of the best pinto beans that I have ever had.  Then there was the CARNE ADOVADA which was perfectly cooked and wonderfully flavor filled.  The NEW MEXICO ENCHILADAS were accompanied by Christmas sauce - both red and green.  The green sauce was perfectly spiced unlike most more bland green sauces.  I only regret is that I never had room for dessert."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch at the end of a conference last week with three other conference attendees and enjoyed a wonderful and unique Southwestern style lunch.  I ordered the Carne Adovada with Eggs; a huge plate with 3 eggs (mine over easy - is their any other way?), a huge chunk of smoked pork simmered in red chili, potatoes (or you can have hash browns), beans all served over a tortilla. The eggs were cooked perfectly, the pork was fall apart fork tender smothered in a rich red chili that added great depth of flavor without overpowering the meat. The potatoes were large cut and good. A real delicious meal that went great with the house margarita.  My other friends each ordered something different, and they all looked really good, especially the Relleno Platter, which I was thinking about ordering before I decided on the Carne Adovada. In fact, there were many things on the menu that I would have liked to try - so much to try but only one lunch/day.  I really enjoyed this place and will seek it out again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Best Southwestern food in the Valley - Dick's Hideaway was part of Richardson's. They have the very best New Mexico style food especially the Carne Avodada breakfast dish. Service is always good and the atmosphere is great which is essential for fine dining. To bear this out; PF Changs opened a spin off Asian restaurant that was about 5,000 s.f. and almost never filled up. Because of this \"cafeteria\" atmosphere, even though the food was identical to PF Chang's it didn't taste as good and the experience was not there. Goes to show that PF Chang's and Oregano's have got it down. They have good food and are limited in seating so that they are always full and on a wait which really adds to the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Food was excellent, service was great, first time here and I will definitely be back! Sat at the bar and the gal that took care of us did an excellent job! She left before we were done and the new girl was pretty good too but the first girl was awesome!"}
{"text":"This was by far the perfect find for our dinner last night. The atmosphere of the restaurant was dimly lit, romantic and had a touch of prohibition feeling. Valet parking was a plus. We sat at the bar but there were several seating options. The bartender was on point with his drinks and the food was amazing! The Carne Avado was spicy and so flavorful even my husband who does need eat spicy food enjoyed the complex flavors. I had a chicken Caesar with grilled chicken. A single position is enough for two but on the bright side we have our lunch for today. I would ram commend going and may go again during my trip to Phoenix. This restarting would rival anything in Portland, Or."}
{"text":"I liked it, but got my sodium intake for a month"}
{"text":"Went to Richardson's for the first time the other day after hearing about the place for a long time.  I thought the food was good but not great.  The atmosphere as nice but a bit dark for my tastes (to each his own).  Overall I guess I was expecting a bit more than this place delivered.  I had the enchilada plate and as i said it was good but did not stand out compared to other new Mexican enchiladas.  I liked the salsa a lot but the chips were pretty oily. I would go again if someone I know wants to go there - but it it is not high up on my list for a repeat visit - -  overall, the food did not overwhelm me and for Mexican/New Mexican the price was a bit high.  Not a hater of of the place but not a lover either."}
{"text":"Bleh. If you're like me and searching for new Mexican style green chili outside of Colorado and New Mexico don't come here. Staff is really friendly and the place is pretty cool but the food tastes nothing like New Mexico style. The green chili smothered is actually just shredded green chili there's no pork or stew so sorry none of that. Bummed."}
{"text":"This was our first visit with some friends who were regulars.  Our friends go ocean fishing at least once a year so when they say that this is a good place to get fresh fish we listen!!  Our group had the halibut ($26) which was outstanding.  It had a pico de gallo salsa that I had on the side in case it was too spicy.  It had a mashed potato side served in a roasted whole green Anaheim pepper.  Excellent!!  The small salads with salmon, either 4 oz or 8 oz depending on the salad size was excellent.  The seafood trilogy was excellent as well.  They have large billboards with the specials of the day.  Our server was attentive without being intrusive.  It appears to be a \"mom and pop\" place which is our favorite.  They have a good selection of wines that are a little pricey but wine really does enhance the meal.  Our total tab was $125 for four of us with full entree's and a total of 5 wines ordered."}
{"text":"Richardson's brunch always offers great tasting food with a Southwestern Flair. The portions are large, and The Taste is deep. Very good Southwestern flavored food. The service is always well done and the environment Lively."}
{"text":"From out of town and was looking for some authentic southwest food. This placed delivered in their food, ambiance and friendly service. All food items my wife and i had were excellent. Highly recommended even if you have to drive for 30 minutes (unless you plan to over serve yourself)."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is a 4- very casual, great date night place. Service is a 4- solid,attentive, and very knowledgeable about the menu  FOOD- is a 4, awesome appetizers, and great fare. My favorite is the pork shoulder (advova) dish, and the enchiladas. I love the queso, elephant garlic, and the rib appetizer.  its awesome, you have to go if you are in town."}
{"text":"Was just there for a company Christmas party and let me tell you, awful service. I never got my salad prior to my dinner, fucking salad never came. Never got a chips refill, service staff was awkward and not interested in working. Had a way different experience last time we were there in a big group. The food quality was also lame. Subpar. Mixed drinks were also on the verge of being pure ice and water. Wont ever ever go there again. Cant believe that a big group received such poor and awful service."}
{"text":"See my review of Dick's Hideaway for more details on this company's self righteous attitude.   So, I was planning a birthday dinner party. If you've ever been to Richardson's patio and sat at the big table outside on a beautiful AZ evening or day, you know why I thought it would be nice to have the party there.   Well, I called 40days ahead of time to try and reserve the space. They will not speak with you about it on the phone and instruct you to email them with your request. So, I did. 25 days later, I'd not heard back from them so I called. I was told to email again. I did. Then 10days before my event,  I emailed again stating that I was very dissappointed that they hadn't replied and that I guess I'll find another venue. So I did. After all, if you're expecting to get a party of 15 at a nice table on a Saturday night during high season, you'd better plan ahead!   Literally, LITERALLY, the day before on Friday afternoon, they called me to see if I still wanted the table. LOL! Really!!?? As if I would have thought for one minute that that would come through and I'd be able to tell 15 guests on Friday night, where to be on Saturday night!   Clueless. Entitled. They have lost ALL perspective."}
{"text":"No matter what the knuckleheads say this is one of the finest restaurants in the greater PHX area.  There is NEVER poor service.  The service when it busy slows down is normal, but not excessive.  The drinks are awesome.  The food is always excellent.  They have spicey and nonspicey food.  Prices run from $15 to $40 and yet it is not cheap, but not expensive because u get quality and a great experience.  Just try it@!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants to visit when I'm craving some good and fresh tasting New Mexican specialties. The flavors are out of this world and it will make your mouth dance with joy.  Been to their other restaurants many times and always enjoy coming back. First got to experience this kind of treat at their older restaurant that mysteriously caught on fire. This place is a favorite of my boss and he usually pays. Nice!  Love the Chimayo Chicken and on other visits order one of the Fish Specials written on the board. The appetizers are delicious and you can easily get filled up on them quickly. Really enjoyed the Green Chili French Onion Soup on my last visit. It had the perfect amount of heat for me and made me break a sweat.  Service can be somewhat mediocre at times. Make sure to also bring a flashlight or have your smart phone app ready to go. It is ridiculously dark in there and can create a bit of a problem. You can always choose to eat outside at the bar or at one of the smaller tables.  This is not a cheap and inexpensive dining experience. Then again it is not super duper crazy expensive. They do have valet parking at certain times so don't be surprised.  Give them a shout out and get ready for some yummy flavors. You won't be disappointed. TOUCHDOWN IN MY MOUTH!  4.5 STARS"}
{"text":"So this has been my favorite place for years, but last week we had a group of friends meet there. The food did not come up evenly, it felt like the servers were not on the ball. Started with 4 trips to bring silverware to the group, and not enough glasses. I got my meal after everyone else had finished their meals. Told him to just cancel my meal, but he said it was on its way and I ordered it. I thought it would have been dropped off the bill, but it was not even reduced in price. I feel like customer service need retrained. The food tasted great as always, but not enough bread to go with the Garlic plate, they brought more, but meals had been delivered.. I have been taking family and friends to Richardson's over 20 years, but now I will have to rethink my GO-TO place."}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming to Richardsons for over 15 years at least once a month. My Dad recently experienced some health issues and needs a wheel chair. We called to make a reservation for an ADA table and was told they couldn't make the reservation less than four people. Two weeks earlier, we called and got the reservation. The man of the phone was rude, unwilling to help us at all. I even told him of our patronage and previous reservation. He basically hung up on me. We will never go to this establishment ever again. You just lost a 15 year costumer."}
{"text":"The food is great but the margaritas are the bomb.  I had the mole and it was rich and just the right spice.    Our waiter was a hoot, asking a lot of questions and super helpful on ordering.  Even giving us a hard time because we ordered the same thing and we should have ordered different items and share.  It was a good time.  Did I mention how great the margaritas were?"}
{"text":"This local restaurant is a gem. This is located down the street from the Hilton at Squaw Peak and probably the best restaurant in the area that is filled with a lot of chain type restaurants. I had heard about the Rokerij small plates menu from office workers and I thought I would give it a try. My girlfriend and I did not have any reservations, so we went downstairs in their bar area and ate the bar. You can order the Mew Mexican specialities or the Rokerij side of the menu. There was so much to choose from so we decided to eat off of the small plates menu. We chose the 3 small plates for $25. I was thinking the plates were going to be small and that we would not be filled. I appreciated that on the menu they told you how many \"pieces\" you were going to get of each item. The tenderloin on toast with triple cream brie was delicious. The amount of tenderloin was just right and the cream brie made it taste over the top. The scallops were cooked perfectly as well. Thoroughly enjoyed the taco sampler. Everything is fresh and the service was great. The couple next to us ordered off of the New Mexican cuisine side. The servings were ample and looked very tasty. I have heard the menu for brunch is equally fanstastic, can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Food was just okay.  Waiter was rude and arrogant.  Noise level extremely loud on a Tuesday!  Won't go back."}
{"text":"AH-MAZING!  Absolutely love this place.  Try the turkey enchiladas - so good!"}
{"text":"My wife and I are from New Mexico and were thrilled with the find. Richardson is one of our favorite places. Because of the food we had our wedding reception there last Saturday. Everyone raved about the food.... Well, except two young people who thought the food was spicey. Their server was on top of it and got them both something to satisfy their taste buds The wait staff and management were fantastic.   The reason I gave a 4 instead of a 5? Because of the poor follow through/communication. I worked with one  office staff for scheduling. The first impression was great but her follow thruogh was minimal to non existent at times. Finally, after 2 weeks of no communication (3 weeks til the wedding) I complained! To everyone who would listen. I even posted on Yelp. The next day I got a call and a text.  After all is said and done...I am grateful all worked out in the end. Regardless of all the bumpy couple of weeks. Richardson is the bomb and worth your patronage!"}
{"text":"After reading reviews on Richardson's, I wasn't sure what to expect. I grew up on New Mexican fare and it is not an easy cuisine to perfect. I was also a little reluctant toward the menu as their vegetarian options seemed few and far between.   We visited the restaurant with another couple who are avid carnivores. We were pleasantly surprised to find something on the menu for everyone. My husband and I split the chili rellenos and cheese enchiladas. The beans are vegetarian but the rice is not so in lieu of it, we were able to get a green chili potato (ridiculously tasty). The food was delightfully packed with heat -- the kind of heat that's cured by a bowl of ice cream or more of what caused the burn in the first place. It IS spicy so be sure to heed the warning on their menu. I dabbed my forehead with a napkin more than once.   To me, there's something about a server who knows her stuff. Our server was fantastic. We wanted for nothing during our entire experience and she knew exactly what was safe for us to eat as vegetarians.   I don't agree with others who think this place is overpriced. Our party of four had the same number of entrees, a bottle of wine, and two cocktails for $120. And yes, they only have valet parking. Welcome to any good restaurant in Phoenix. Can't wait to visit again and get my sweat on!"}
{"text":"Richardson's is an excellent choice if you love high quality New Mexican food. Today we enjoyed a delicious brunch- enchiladas (cheese & beef) Christmas style (red&green chile), carne adovada & over easy eggs, a bowl of beans with red chile, onions & cheese, mimosas, and bloody Mary's.   All were excellent!!!  It was a beautiful day so the patio seating was full but we were able to grab a spot at the bar inside which is always a good place to sit and enjoy your meal and cocktails. Next-door, at the Rokerij, or just south on the opposite side of 16 th street, at Dick's Hideaway, sitting at the bar is definitely The way to go because you can watch as the cooks prepare your food and enjoy the wonderful smell of the pecan wood used in the grills.  Both the red and green chile are excellent- I generally prefer the red, but only slightly.  There's not a bad thing on the menu and they always have some great specials that are not on the menu- The only challenge is convincing myself to order something other than my favorites that are on the menu!"}
{"text":"Today (9/2), they fulfilled their promise... Richardson's.  It has taken over a month but they came through.  Sorry to have had to hound them but I guess ok."}
{"text":"Just tremendous service, great food and a really nice atmosphere. We brought our kids and although there weren't any other kids there we all had a great time and loved the food. The pizzas are great, but they are better knows for their enchiladas and quesadillas - and for good reason. The portions are huge and they taste fantastic. Would highly recommend for a fun night out."}
{"text":"Went for my 40th birthday at the large patio table. It was a great choice. The ambiance was amazing, the food was so good. Our server Tana was a 5 also she was engaging and we had great conversation with her. It was like she was a part if our table and party. After dinner we visited the basement bar and found it to be so cozy and inviting. This is an excellent restaurant and I will be back!"}
{"text":"Great food.  The red and green chillie sauces had a good amount of \"heat\".  Will definitely go back my next trip to Phoenix"}
{"text":"Had the pan seared salmon it was so unbelievably great perfectly seared on each side pink in the middle with the capers in the sauce Homerun."}
{"text":"After hearing about this place for years, I finally decided to give it a try. My husband and I came here for Sunday brunch. We were seated promptly and served chips and salsa right away. I ordered a $5 bellini which was on special and decided on the tenderloin hash special and my husband ordered the crab cake benedict. My tenderloin hash was cooked to my specifications along with a nice runny fried egg on top with beans on the side. My bellini was a generous pour as well. My husbands benedict was amazing and full of flavor with a rich hollondaise and really good crab cakes , I was jealous I didn't order it. The portion sizes were huge, we probably could've shared one dish. Prices were a little on the higher side, but the quality and amount of food made up for it."}
{"text":"Best New Mexican restaurant in Phoenix. It's a 30 minute drive from the east valley, but worth it for the great food, good service, and ambiance. The free valet parking is a nice touch."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Richardson's many times and have always loved it, but this past weekend has made me rethink whether I will ever return.  Out of town company were very excited to dine there as I had raved about it.  Well, the waitress, Diane, made our evening miserable.  We sat for quite some time waiting for her to come.  We had questions about the menu, specials in particular, and she sulked off to bring us a chalk board as we couldn't see all of the ones on the walls.  She then left the table and didn't come back for a long time.  Once she did, she  stood at the tableside, chewing gum and jutting out one hip.  We were clearly boring her.  Questions asked of her were not audible in their response.  Never have is felt so embarrassed as my out of town company were very shocked and very disappointed.  Perhaps I could expect this treatment at Hooter's, but the total indifference was very very difficult.  If you get Diane, you might consider moving to another table and if she is chewing gum, it might be the same piece as she chomped on it the entire evening.  Very sad, indeed."}
{"text":"I like the place... Very quiet. The staff is attentive. Other patrons are pleasant. Great menu... Something to please even the pickiest of eaters.  Totally not a fan of the ceviche. They do not cook the fish in lime juice...so I was told by a staff member. The shrimp delivered on a bed of rice was delicious tho!"}
{"text":"if you love new mexico hatch green chilis or just want a really delicious breakfast with quality ingredients, this is the place to go...the food is superb and worth every penny...and the atmosphere of the restaurant is awesome if you are someone like me who misses living in new mexico!!!    loretta in phx."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed in Richardson's and the Rokery. We stopped in today for lunch and asked for a table. There were at least 4 open tables, the larger tables, but still they were open. The bartender and then the hostess were only willing to seat us at the bar since we were a party of two. We were looking for a sit down lunch in which we planned to eat and enjoy several drinks.  We walked out after realizing the staff had no desire to accommodate us or concern for losing a customer. We decided to go down to the Rokery to see if the attitude was different there. It was complete empty yet all the tables said reserved.  We asked the bartender if we could sit at a table. He had to excuse himself to go upstairs to ask permission. That was enough for us. There are too many good places to eat in Phoenix.  Oh by the way, until today we were loyal regulars to all three Richardson's restaurants."}
{"text":"Our group of four had dinner at Richardson's tonight and we are still waiting to have feeling return in our mouths. The guacamole was hot and this was before we added salsa, and our dinners consisting of enchiladas and chicken rellenos were inedible. The chiles overwhelmed all taste. We heard people at an adjacent table complaining about the over-spiced food, too. We think the chef may have gotten carried away with chiles.  That was all so disappointing since we had friends from out-of-town who we had told they were in for something special. We were right but also so wrong."}
{"text":"Richardson's is a true classic in the Valley! It has been here forever! I have been dining here since I was a young girl (...it is one of my dad's favorites) and have ALWAYS loved their delicious house salad! Last night, I told my boyfriend that I hadn't been in years and wanted to check it out again on our date night! Not much has changed, it is still the same dark and cozy atmosphere! And yup, the salad was just as delicious! This time I ordered it with beef tenderloin and the meat was marinated and cooked to perfection! We also split the queso dip with chorizo as an appetizer and it was fantastic. The house margarita was not the best marg that i've ever had but it did the trick. You should also know that it IS a little pricey. I was actually pretty shocked by some of the entree prices but if you stick with the basic meals (enchiladas, burgers, etc.), you can order a plate under $25. I'm sure we'll be back with family again soon!"}
{"text":"My husband, having lived in Phoenix for 40 years, has been a huge Richardson's fan. After the fire, we were both waiting for news of its reopening.  While driving  south on 16th street, I darn near gave myself whiplash when I saw a lovely building that said \"Richardson's\".  I texted my husband and 3 hours later, we walked in for dinner. The place was packed,and I had no idea what \"Rokery\" was.....Richardson's sister restaurant next door. This is where it gets confusing. While we were checking out the drop-dead gorgeous candlelit entry-patio, we were led to a table at Rokery .....not understanding why, not understanding the two-sided menu, etc. On the plus side, the booths are huge,  but I am not a fan of the open-kitchen concept because of the noise. Our booth was 8 feet from the bar and kitchen and conversing was impossible, and we there for a special occasion. It turns out that they serve both menus in either restaurant, with Rokery having an impressive fish-steak menu - which we will definitely return for. The daily specials - posted on a blackboard/wall was a small novel of offerings. We started with the Pomagranet margarita, which was very weak on the tequila. We ordered two of the Mexican entrees, which were very authentic and spicy. The only problem with my husband's plate was that it had been placed under a broiler and  the red chili sauce  had coagulated into a blackened, burnt- tasting flavor. Surprisingly, he didn't finish half of it......very unusual. My selection of the Mexican Platter was excellent, but could be delivered to the table at a temperature that is less than molten lava. It must have taken 15 minutes before it cooled enough to eat it. At any rate, the new location is beautiful, although when they welcome you, they need to tour and explain the two neighboring restaurants and the fact that you can order from both sides of the menu. I would love to give them the additional  stars the next time we visit."}
{"text":"The breakfast combo is the best brunch meal I've ever had. My only mistake was ordering it Christmas because the green sauce is amazing! The only thing I might change is the meat choice for the benedict."}
{"text":"I searched yelp and found that this place had pretty good reviews for New Mexico style food (note it's not \"standard\" Mexican food or Tex Mex)  I don't get any NM food in California so when I visited Phoenix yesterday and today, I jumped at the chance to get even a temporary fill.   I had the huevos rancheros (Christmas style- Red and green chili) with potatoes and beans and a tortilla.   The portions were big and I left content! The food was tasty and is making me miss New Mexico even more. The service was excellent. The place has a cool decor too.  If I'm back in PHX, I'll definitely stop here!  By the way, they said the name of the restaurant isn't related to the family of Bill Richardson... Former NM governor."}
{"text":"Stopped in once again after a short hiatus and found the service to still be less than adequate. One feels like they're a bother asking for someone to take an order or get a refill because they're just so busy with preparations and waiting on tables. I don't believe it is the help's fault ...they all appear to do their best. But there is a genuine lack of any small talk or anyone asking you \"how did you enjoy your meal?, etc.\" I believe it must be the management that schedules too few employees. At any rate, the food still rocks and the pours are generous. Happy hour prices are competitive with an array of excellent menu choices. Pork & dirty rice, the chili rellenos w/ red or green sauce is amazing, but very spicy at times (especially if you order the red sauce). Their chicken, shrimp and beef skewers are amazing. Basically, you can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Went to dinner tonight at Richardsons. I felt nickled and dimed from the moment I arrived. Forced valet or park a block away. We requested bread with our spicy soup and were brought 2 tortillas that we were charged $2 bucks for. And the food although different wasn't worth $75 dollars for 2 people with no alcohol. I have no problem spending $300 for an amazing dinner but this food and restaurant was not worth the cost. Skip it and go to Abuleos. Just as good or better and a much better value."}
{"text":"Loved this restaurant!!! Food was excellent! They have a nice outdoor patio. Would come back if im ever in town again. The Adovada benedict was soooooo good."}
{"text":"The food is unbelievable!  I love the smallness and ambience.  It strays away from the chain aura every other restaurant has.  The quesadilla dip is one-of-a-kind."}
{"text":"We have been to Richardson's many times over the years and have always found the food to be consistent- steaks, seafood, fish, specials- have all been excellent. But we had a problem on our last visit that really affected our experience- The service was poor-our waiter recited the specials in such a low voice that half of our party couldn't hear him, and our drinks took 15-20 minutes to arrive and came out 1or 2 at a time for a party of 6. The bar appeared to be well staffed so not sure what the issue was, but it was disappointing  to have such lackluster service at one of our favorite places."}
{"text":"Every year I come to town I eat here. And every year I love it. The service from curb to bar to table is great. No valet to night so we parked in back no big deal. The margaritas were made perfect. We had several dishes in my group and all of them were made hit and tasty. I think you can not go wrong here and the bill was reasonable for a group of 6. Try this place you won't regret it. I would be patient if your on a time crunch it stays very busy."}
{"text":"Upon walking into Richardson's, I instantly fell in love with its unique environment. A very fun and cute restaurant that perfectly paralleled Arizona's desert culture.   We stopped in around 9:30PM for dinner and found out that there was happy hour until close. I decided to indulge in the vast list of sliders. I opted for the steak and brie while my friend the salmon. Both versions were absolutely delicious. The steak and brie was a bit on the pricier side, at around $18, and the salmon was around the $12-15 range. The sliders were hefty, and although both plates left us full, I found the salmon to be slightly more bang for your buck, especially being that they were filled with huge chunks of salmon.   Overall a solid restaurant to enjoy food with friends and family. Would definitely stop in again if I ever found myself in the North Phoenix area!"}
{"text":"Being a true New Mexican I had to try this place out. When you pull into the parking lot it's valet only, I'm not a fan of that at all but it's complimentary and being the lots so small it's understandable. When you walk in you enter into the patio dining with lots of tables and room. The restaurant inside is extremely small and when I went it was packed, I recommend a reservation on weekends. I had to sit on the patio and it was a bit chilly. I ordered the Carne Adovado. It came with pinto beans and rice. The red chile was delicious, it was truly New Mexican no doubt. The pork was smoked which isn't in any way, shape or form New Mexican but it was extremely tender. I wasn't a fan of the smokey flavor with the red chile. True New Mexican restaurants serves chips and salsa before the meal and sopapillas with the meal. I missed that but all in all I would go back for the red chile alone."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. We had a corner booth. Not too crowded for a Thursday night. Low lighting. Large portions, so maybe order to share. We started w the cheese dip which was yummy. I had the tortilla crusted fish with broccolini and the famous potato. While the potato was just okay, the rest of the meal was delicious. Free valet parking. I'd visit again."}
{"text":"Dark cozy spot with a great menu and nice selection of cocktails, wines and beer.  Food was solid , with  our group ordering a nice selection of small plates, including scallops, and beef skewers, served with a tasty selection of salsas.   Our server seated us immediately, walked us thru the menu and then disappeared .  Subsequent service was slow, with orders arriving at different times and one not at all.  Good if you have time and are in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"We were referred by the Sheraton Grand hotel.  The front of the house staff were friendly and informative. The Pueblo style and warm ambience were inviting.  The layers of flavors were quite remarkable.  Overall an Outstanding experience. We will be back."}
{"text":"This is a hard review to write.  I really want to give the restaurant 1 star for the very poor service.  However, the food is good, I felt obliged to give it 3 stars.  Service - called last week to make a reservation for 3 for 6pm Sat night.   Was told they don't take reservations for parties of 3.  Show up to the restaurant at 5:30pm. Hostess says we can sit at the bar and she'll put or name on the wait list.  Meanwhile, at the bar we watch several parties of 2, without reservations, get seated at tables large enough for 4.  Hour and a half later...still no table for 3. Hhhmmmm...  Food - carne sliders were too sweet and the ratio of meat to bread was off.  Relleno was outstanding!!! Bacon wrapped shrimp incredible, Queso was just ok.  Not sure what the restaurant has against parties of 3, but FYI, parties of 3 tend to spend more than parties of 2."}
{"text":"I have been to Richardson's many times and it still remains one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix.  For the people complaining about the food being spicy, um, it is a restaurant serving New Mexico cuisine - it is supposed to be spicy.  My favorite dish has to be the Relleno Platter.  I usually split it with a friend because the portion is huge: two rellenos with rice and beans.  I especially like the pork rellenos with verde sauce, but there's also smoked turkey, beef and regular cheese.  Their margaritas are outstanding...honestly, I haven't had anything that was bad at this restaurant.  And the wait staff is friendly, too.    I love their patio renovation.  It is stylish and sophisticated with a modern New Mexico ambiance.  Great for having dinner and/or drinks outdoors on one of our beautiful Phoenix evenings."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar since it was an early dinner. We ordered off the happy hour menu - pork sliders, queso and chips and ribs.  The sliders turned out to be the worst of the bunch.  The pulled pork was a bit dry and though the bun was nice, the whole thing was bland without some kind of sauce maybe.  The queso was probably one of the best I've ever had.  The ribs fell off the bone and the seasoning was pretty tasty despite the appearance of the dish.  The wine I had was very good, the margarita my friend had was super tangy but he enjoyed it.  All in all, I'd like to explore the menu further and maybe venture to the basement.  :)"}
{"text":"Awesome food, atmosphere, and drinks.  We ate in the downstairs bar and loved it.  I had the New Mexican Platter.  You should try it soon."}
{"text":"I'm a long time fan of Richardson's and after finally visiting the new location I am head over heels again! I love that the new place looks just like the old place inside, except a bit bigger it seems. I love the food and the specials are amazing. I recently tried a green chile tilapia that was incredible! I have family in town soon and already know we are going to Richardson's for a meal."}
{"text":"We finally visited the new restaurant 3 1/2 years after the Richardson's fire. It is quite amazing how similar the new Richardson's looks and feels like the former landmark restaurant. Their service is great. We ordered a pizza and salad. I should have known better to order a pizza from a New Mexico style restaurant... roasted tomato sauce with New Mexico sausage and mozzarella. It brought back memories of conversations with my Papa debating whether Prego or Ragu was the better canned tomato sauce."}
{"text":"Wow...do I ever love this place!  We stopped in Saturday for happy hour and dinner and it reminded us how much we missed this place.  Love that they offer $6 glasses of wine for happy hour at the tables as well as the bar - I enjoyed a lovely Silverado Sauvignon Blanc.  We shared the spinach queso, green chile pork tamale, chicken, beef, shrimp and sausage skewers over rice and pinto beans and the shrimp and scallop pasta with a side salad.  We definitely overdid it, but couldn't decide what NOT to have...tough problem, right?  After dinner we went to the cellar bar at the Rokerij...perfect way to end an evening on a hot summer day!"}
{"text":"This is one of the few places in Phoenix that is truly unique.  Both the atmosphere and food are something you can't get anywhere else!  There is a back entrance which is really cool, a descending stone stairwell in front that leads to the underground bar, and a main entrance.  They call their food \"New Mexican Cuisine\" which is perfect.  It's not traditional Mexican, they have little tweeks and variations of many Mexican favorites.  Mixed in are modern American fish and chicken dishes with a new Mexican twist.  You can regularly catch them fire roasting the green chiles out back, and they are used in various dishes.  I love stopping in here anytime I'm in the area.  It is a must try if you like finding something that provides a break from the mass produced and safe, boring menus of the corporate culinary machine."}
{"text":"Best brunch and always a stop for us when we're in Phoenix. Great New Mexico Chile, both red and green, though I prefer red. Jalapeño hollandaise is soooo good."}
{"text":"Having dined here approximately 5 years ago and having enjoyed our meals I wanted to revisit the restaurant.   First, is the mandatory (complementary) valet parking. I am perfectly capable of parking my own car, thank you, without the need to use a valet service.   Second, chips and salsa:  Sorry, Chevy's is just as good but the habanero salsa is wonderfully freakin hot!  Third, my wife's seafood combo was wonderful. My tamales were just so-so with too stringy pork inside. I've had as good or better eating tamales at my farmers market. Rice was dry and crusty in places. The pinto beans were just plain bland.   I'll revisit on my next trip, or maybe not."}
{"text":"Great Pozole and awesome bloody mary's.  We come here often on the weekends and we love this place."}
{"text":"I love Richardson's. Incredible food, great service. One of the best places to eat in Phoenix"}
{"text":"Everyone in the \"know\" in Phoenix knows about the Rokerji / Richardsons. This place serves the best southwestern food hands down. Ask Esquire magazine, who awarded them best bar in America. And of course Phoenix Mag gives their nod to this place almost every year. These 2 restaurants occupy the same real estate but the Rokerji is in the basement and it is my personal favorite. The atmosphere is 5 stars. Big sofas, large booths in a Grotto like setting with a roaring fire. It doesn't get any better than this. The menu is the same whether you choose to stay up top at Richardsons or go down below to the basement. The food is hands down the best of its kind in town. Now if you are heat sensitive, listen to your server. The owner of these places means it when he says \"spicy\" but it's oh so worth the pain. My favorite here is the Carne Adovada with an egg on top. It is unforgettable. The egg is the magic touch to me with this dish. They tend to have this more on the breakfast side but don't let that deter you. You can have them add the egg anytime. The richness of the warm yolk melding into this dish sends it over the top. Trust me you will absolutely love it. I give The Rokerji / Richardsons 5 stars in spite of some of the tired burned out staff members. Unfortunately some of the servers here have forgotten the true meaning of being in the service industry.  It is my feeling that the owner, Richardson, needs to remind his staff that there is 3 parts to a great dining experience. The ambiance, the fantastic food and the SERVER.  But for now overlook the occasional subpar server and give this place a try. It will become one of your favorite spots right after your first mouthwatering bite."}
{"text":"I have been going to Richardson's for so many years. I can not believe that I have never reviewed this amazing restaurant! It's like an icon to the valley of the sun! Richardson's brings New Mexico to Arizona. Here you can find traditional New Mexican cuisine but also specialities like fish or great steaks with the spice that gives it southwestern flare and taste. I have never had a meal here that wasn't amazing and the service is always, ALWAYS consistent. I like to arrive early, put my name on the 'list' to wait for a table at Richardson's and have a drink 'down below' in the 'dungeon' of Rokerij.. the 'speak easy' feel of going underneath the main restaurant is always mysterious and fun to me. I love all of the copper top on the bars.. I kind of want that on my bar at home! Maybe I am just a little weird?! Okay. I get that! Down at Rokerij, you can pretty much find the same drinks and wines that you find at Richardson's. They have several sparkling wines and champagnes for me too! If its Fall or Spring, the patio of Richardson's is a great place to hang out and there is a fireplace that gives off a great ambient feeling. Drink specials and small plates on happy hour are a really great find! There are great tequilas, mezcals and that leads to what? Great margaritas! Last weekend, I was here with my daughter, who dub's this her 'very favorite restaurant' for southwestern food, when she is home from school on the east coast. This is her first stop and her last stop before heading back to school, always! The bar always makes her a refreshing Prickly Pear Lemonade that she requests when she is here. It's likely not special to her, but she thinks it is, and thats what matters. We always start with the Guacamole, housemade, of course and served with a trio of salsa and duo colored tortilla chips. We always love the New Mexico Con Queso too.. just the right amount of spice and chorizo and served in a hot skillet. This past weekend, I had the Surf and Turf; a nice sized filet mignon, two nice sized grilled prawns atop that, AND, (as if that is not enough!), Chorizo Enchiladas.. they are served open faced. The housemade beans come on the side. This is a huge meal, as most of the entrees here are! This plate is served on the classic pewter Rokerij/Richardson's plate that comes out HOT and will burn you if you don't mind it! I've had most of the entrees here, and again, I have NEVER been disappointed. My daughter had the New Mexico Enchiladas: three generous enchiladas of your choosing, ( she chose the green chile pork; grilled shrimp and the cheese), with green or red sauce and the green is usually the 'milder' of the two. We were so full we didn't want dessert, but the awesome waiter brought us flan anyway to share.. its almost like a caramel type cheesecake thats super creamy! We have had brunch here and again, nothing is even in the 'mediocre' category.. it falls into the 'amazing and FILLING' category! I highly recommend the Enchiladas and Eggs or the Huevos Rancheros and Eggs.. they will do the eggs any style; poached is my personal preference and they don't bat an eye! Oh! Weekend Brunch Mimosas! I like a Mimosa that is mainly Champagne and little OJ , #bckimberly, I swear I was given almost an entire bottle of champs and a small glass of OJ to add as I wished! The Bloody Mary is also worth the hair of your dog.. or your chinny, chin, chin left over from the night before. The staff here is on point.. Maybe one of the best in all of the valley.. attentive and not rushy. They will talk to you; leave the check when you need it to be left; OR let you linger and hang out and enjoy drinks or those mimosas! The history of this restaurant and all its endured makes it a place we continue to come back to over and over.. and now its the same for our daughter who talks about it while at school in DC. Tip: Richardson's does not take reservations unless there are more than 3 in your dinner party and the weekends and some, MANY week nights get busy! Parking is valet; bring cash to pay and tip! :-) Go to Richardson's hungry and ready for New Mexico spice.. this isn't your 'typical' Mexican food!"}
{"text":"I think after tonight, this will be the last time I go to Richardson's. My husband likes the place, but I find it overpriced for the quality of food. However, I thought it would be nice to take him there tonight for his birthday. First, you can't make a reservation unless you have a party of four and as I discovered, there are no tables for two people. So when we got to the restaurant, there were no tables available and the bar was full, so we were offered a side bar area or outside sitting at a coffee table type area. Less than stellar choices for a birthday dinner. Finally, we got a couple seats at the bar. I ordered the Grouper with caper lemon butter sauce. Imagine my surprise when I received my dish and there were no capers. Everytime that I have had a caper sauce it has had capers in it. When I asked about it, they looked at me like I was crazy. Plus, all the sauce was absorbed by the tortilla on the plate. So I basically I paid $27 bucks for a dry Grouper with asparagus. My husband kind of liked his dish, but he was not overwhelmed. Yeah, the last time we will go there."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere. Staff was great. Food/flavors exceptional! Pricey but a lot of food."}
{"text":"Honestly was not at all impressed. The atmosphere is really nice, but that was where it stopped. Went with a group of six, we all agreed that our food was too spicy to really enjoy. On top of that, it is fairly expensive for what you get. I have a hard time paying $20-$30 for Mexican food."}
{"text":"This was a great place for dinner. Plenty of choices on the menu, from salads to pizzas to pastas to classic Mexican-style plates. I went with something called Chimayo chicken, which had sun-dried tomatoes, poblano, spinach, and asiago, along with some delicious veggies on the side, and a green chile potato, which was awesome.  There were quite a few things on the menu that looked good, so I'm sure I'll be back.  Oh, and I almost forgot - I ordered the sopapillas for dessert - best sopapillas I've ever had. Cooked perfectly, just the right amount of crispiness, drizzled with sweet honey. This would be enough of a reason to come back."}
{"text":"We returned here to celebrate my father in laws birthday. Service was great, we were there about 3 pm. Food was excellent. Carne Adovada was superb. Others had the Halibut and meatloaf and that was great also. We had a party of 8 and had a booth, room was adequate. Not a place for large parties unless you sit outside in the misters..."}
{"text":"Richardsons is one of my favorite places to eat! They serve New Mexican style food with a luxury twist which is exactly what I was searching for for the last 10 years in Phoenix. It is a bit pricy but in my opinion worth the cost! You have to get the New Mexico enchiladas plate! You will thank me!"}
{"text":"Life changing, absolutely!  Finally made it out to Richardson's after hearing nothing but good things about this restaurant. Right as we walked up you could smell the amazingness, is that a word??? Who cares... because the aroma had nothing on the the way the food danced off my tongue. Such a cute dim room, perfect for a date night, and I have to say that I was very impressed the the music selection. I mean who doesn't want to hear great tunes while enjoying a meal. Anyway let's get down to the meal.  We ordered the New Mex con Queso, delicious! Great flavor not too spicy, fresh green chilies and spinach topped with Schreiner's Chorizo. The waiter asked if we had been there before and continued to tell us about their \"Signature Dishes\". I was already looking at the Pork Chop Chorizo when he sold me on the dish. For $27 you get a pretty decent size salad, fresh and crisp with jalopeno ranch. A side of Richardson's Famous Green Chili Potato, some mixed veggies and the glorious 14oz Pork Chop, double stacked stuffed with chorizo. This sits on top a large tortilla with beans, now you don't want to discard the base, you want it to soak up all the juices from the meat. I made sure to eat each bite of the chop with the beans and tortilla. Holy cow, was it marvelous. It arrives to the table in all it's glory on a silver platter, literally... my mouth dropped. I was not expecting anything of that size, and let me tell you about the icing on the cake or the chop for that matter...Mango Chutney. That definitely gave it the over the top, out of this world, better tan sex flavor...OMG heavenly!  Now, I do consider myself somewhat of foodie for sure...but I have to say, I have not had anything that amazing in a long time. I was expecting to have some great grub but I did not think I was going to come home still salivating over my dinner. Thank god I have more then half left over for lunch. This is for sure my new favorite place, can't wait to come back again. All in all the atmosphere, great wait staff, and quality of food, I give this gem 2 thumbs up! Richardson's I will see you soon."}
{"text":"If you visit, order the New Mexican dishes because that's what they do best. The Enchiladas with Red and Green Sauce (Christmas) and the pork-stuffed Poblano Pepper were fantastic (both traditional New Mexican dishes).  They offer a lot of different types of fish, but the preparation seems a bit of stretch to make it New Mexican. For example, I ordered the Sea Bass with an Orange Chili Glaze. In theory, this sounds delicious, but it was overly sweet with no chili heat for balance. This is a great date spot because many of the tables  and booths are in little nooks for privacy. The sweet potato filled chili is supposed to be what they are known for but for me, it was a bit meh and obviously made en masse before service (which is fine, but make sure it is hot when it is added to the plate). Great cocktails, especially the margaritas."}
{"text":"Brunch today with hubby and best friends--good food, glad I don't have to fly to ABQ just to get adovada,"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the experience from the mixed up, they booked the wrong restaurant, reservation to the meal delivery, every 5 minutes they brought one plate, to the manager that was clearly not interested in discussing my concerns when I asked and they daid he would be right over. Had he done so I would have possibly returned in the future. Their loss not ours. 10 customers lost."}
{"text":"We went there last Sun for brunch.  I'm impressed with the atmosphere most. Love their unique fun kind of foods.  I didn't remember what we ordered but there were  shrimp sandwich, grilled spicy pork, and crab omelet. It won't take long to get the food here and they all are delicious! Worth stopping by :)"}
{"text":"The food was just a normal food but it was so expensive. Services was not good. It took alot to take our orders. I did not like the place."}
{"text":"I came here again with a previous co-worker for lunch.  We were able to sit outside on a beautiful cool Thursday afternoon.  The service was great and the place was very clean.  We ordered the following: Chips and Salsa ($3): it came with 3 different salsas. Pico De Gallo, Tomatillo, and Habanero (it was mild though).  It was very good.  The blue and yellow corn chips were warm, light and crispy.  The salsas were great but I wished the Habanero had a stronger kick.    Blue Wedge Salad with Cajun Chicken ($9): The chicken was great, it was moist, tender and very flavorful.  However it had tortilla strips and black bean salsa, so it should have been called the \"Tex-Mex Blue Wedge Salad with Chicken\". It didn't come with Blue Cheese Crumbles only blue cheese dressing with very little blue cheese crumbles.  Cuban Sandwich ($9): last time I had a Cuban sandwich was at Porto's in Burbank, CA.  Porto's Cuban sandwich had very thinly sliced ham, pork, Swiss cheese in a delicious flatten sandwich.  However, the Cuban Sandwich had 1/2 inch thick ham, roast pork and a green sauce and a Swiss cheese (see picture). They should have renamed this the \"Thick Cut Cuban Sandwich\".   My visit was good, but I will definitely try another restaurant when I'm in Phoenix, AZ again."}
{"text":"C.J is a server to request . I have never seen someone work so hard . I have been going to Rich/Rok for years and he has made a huge impression. The food was amazing and the service was even bette ."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food I had here. I had the daily special - a fish trio, with different sauces and preparations. When I left, I was sad that I didn't live in Phoenix. I was also sad that I was with a bunch of my co-workers who, when they were complaining that the food was too spicy, would have looked at me funny for stealing the remainder of THEIR dinners.   This place is an absolute winner."}
{"text":"We stumbled across thid place looking for a mexican place.... this is New Mexican! Carne adovada is as good as everyone is bragging about. Just the right amount of spicy and full of flavor. The pasta dish with shrimp was also a hit. Nice decor and ambiance. Very pleased with the service as well!"}
{"text":"Went here with my husband and a friend for dinner. The ambiance is dark but nice. Our friend is from New Mexico and she said they do a very good job making authentic NM food; to me it was a little too salty. Perhaps that is the style of cooking there? The portion sizes are large so that does help to justify the high prices, however, I think in the Phoenix area there are more affordable places to try with food just as good or better.  With that being said, I've only been here once and maybe the chef was just a little too \"happy\" with the salt that night... I'd try it again if I was in the area. For now, just 3/5."}
{"text":"The food is good and there's a lot of it. The atmosphere is great, but is a little dark."}
{"text":"I hear this is the most authentic New Mexico food in town.   In any event it is really really good. Food is fantastic and the clientele are loyal because you will see the same faces. Excellent place especially over the long haul."}
{"text":"Honestly hands down my favorites brunch spot in PHX. Every time I come I pick a new  menu item and end up ranting and raving about it. I've tried the jalepeño Benedict, the Richardsons Combo, then now the chille rellleno breakfast (pork and beef) . The $5 mimosa or bloody marry are always a winning choice. I can't wait to come for lunch or dinner! This place knows what they are doing."}
{"text":"Took friends here for lunch ... It had been a while since my last visit and wanted to try it again.  So glad I did!  I ordered the New Mexican Platter ... Everything was perfect as I expected.  The right amount of heat, spice, and temperature.  Too often foods are over or under spiced, or too salty, too cool.  I love it when they get it spot on.  Dining companions had the relleno platter and the Santa Fe chicken.  Everyone was pleased with their meals.    I did order the GCP (Green Chile Potato) .. It was good, but didn't blow my socks off as I had expected.  Don't get me wrong - I just won't order it as an additional side item.    Overall - kudos on a great meal and great service!"}
{"text":"All I hear about from Richardson's employees is what a dick Richardson is, and how they all hate working for him. I have to say, it shows. The service was horrendous, the brunch doesn't accomodate families. The menu is full of empty threats regarding plate sharing and a 20% gratuity on parties of 8 or more. The food looks tremendous, but I couldn't bring myself to order because my beer came to the table looking like someone had taken a swig from it, and we were waiting 15 minutes for a cup of coffee. The only people this place serves with respect and decency during Sunday morning brunch are martini ordering geriatrics and drunks from the night before. It has a great reputation, yet feels the need to ride the coattails of that as opposed to holding a quality/standard of service that should be commonplace in an area with strict competition. Do not bring your children. this place obviously prefers to serve adult clientele. My daughter is three, well behaved but we were still ignored."}
{"text":"I issued a challenge to my ex-pro baseball player buddy: Find me the best spot in the area for Southwestern cuisine. NOT Tex-Mex, but true Southwestern. Oh, and it needs to be a \"spot I've not tried\". He knows I camp out at The Mission and absolutely love the food, so getting close was a challenge.   Richardson's Cusine of New Mexico is a unique dining spot with an \"Old Phoenix\" ambiance. It helps that it's also located in \"Old Phoenix\" and is dark and cozy. I had a special called the Taos Trio or combo. It consisted of Carne Adovado, Bacon wrapped Shrimp and home made spicy sausage with green chili potatoes. Incredible food! Several people ordered the Chilean seabass which I tried and this was also wonderful.  Service was excellent and we really enjoyed dining for 4. Apparently, this place takes no reservations, but uses a call-ahead approach up to about 6:45. We were in Paradise Valley and gave the 10 minute warning and they greeted us as we came in.  Excellent food and really nice people!"}
{"text":"As a long time patron of Richardson's I am always taking new people in and encouraging others to come downtown and try it!  This occasion, February 28, 2014, one of my good friends and I stopped in for a much anticipated lunch together.  This is the first time I have ever considered never returning.  The restaurant was not busy  There was only 12 people in the inside dining area between 11 am and 12:30. We arrived at 11am and chose to sit at the bar inside. The young woman at the bar greeted me and served me a glass of wine and then proceeded to continue her \"set up the bar\" duties.   When my friend arrived we waited several minutes and then I had to call to the server to ask someone to take my friend's drink order. 5 + minutes later our server/bartender still had not brought the requested beer although the server/bartender was right there on the other side of the bar in full view. 3 feet away from us. Remember the restaurant was not busy.  We ordeedr the bacon-wrapped shrimp appetizer to share and it arrived in a reasonable amount of time and was amazing, as usual.  Unfortunately we could not seem to get ANY service for a glass of water or a second glass of wine.  Again I had to ask the server to please ask the bartender, or whomever was supposed to be working behind the bar, to please see if someone was available to serve us. At this point we still had not been able to order lunch.  The Bartender/ young woman who initially served us come up to take the drink order and I asked if the three salads on the chalk board were good.  She assured me they were excellent.  I am used to the house salad, which is excellent, and we assumed we could count on something of that quality.   We ordered the beef tenderloin salad split and another glass of wine and a beer. 12-15 minutes later we still did not have our drinks. There was NO ONE new inside the dining room and one party out on the patio and several servers so as far as we could see there was no reason for the total lack of service.  Another 10-15 minutes and the salad showed up on one plate.   This salad was a very un-inspired 'Cesar\" with limp flavourless beef flopped on top of a mound of rusty romaine lettuce and some basic croutons with some shaved Parmesan Crude and messy presentation and it was certainly not what we envisioned.  The server went to \"find\" some small plates and the salad was then deposited on the bar for us to split. No serving pieces were provided for us to accomplish this. She also did not offer to assist or to take the salad back to the kitchen to be re-plated.   Maybe I am being picky here but I can get a terrible salad at any Denny's or Village Inn. Richardson's is known for service and quality. The service was non-existent. The salad was terrible, overpriced and tasted flavourless. The only thing that was good was the wine (which we had to practically beg for) and the shrimp appetizer which is all on the kitchen's skill.  So feeling very un-welcome and very disappointed in the salad, lack of service, and our expectations for a great lunch - we gave up and decided to forgo anything additional. 60 dollars later we were happy to just leave.   I am terribly disappointed. Richardson's is my go-to restaurant for special occasions, lunch with friends, happy hour - you name it. I can go to Postino's (closer to my house) or Windsor, Zinburger - any number of other options for a great meal. I fully expect Richardson's uniquely prepared high-end food when I come here and for 60 dollars for lunch I would hope to be at least not frustrated and hungry when I leave."}
{"text":"Their carne adovada, prickly pear margaritas, and patio are what dreams are are of. We always enjoy having a girls night or date night here, especially during cool weather, so we can sit on the patio. It is pricey, but I've never had better carne adovada anywhere!"}
{"text":"Their brunch is positively out of this world! And not nearly as expensive as I would have expected - definitely competitive with other brunch places in town. Hands down the best french toast I have ever had in my life - and I'm a snob when it comes to french toast!!"}
{"text":"Truly outstanding food!! I had the steak with crab! Wow. The shrimp appetizer was excellent as was the roasted garlic plate!! Service generally good. If the food weren't this great, I wouldn't give 5. I will say the average of 3.5 is definitely way low"}
{"text":"Pretty good new Mexican cuisine. Their portion size is hefty and the patio is a must-experience. On the flip side, food can be a bit pricey and they didn't have the desserts they listed. Recommend adovada"}
{"text":"We have been in Phoenix for 23 years. We moved here from Tucson and haven't found a great Mexican restaurant until now.   Food is fresh and beautiful  Tana was a very attentive waitress. She is great"}
{"text":"I love New Mexican and southwest food. Richardsons took me back to downtown Santa Fe. The atmosphere is perfect - adobe booths and tables. The salsas served were spicy, and yummy!  I had the New Mexican enchiladas with chicken, veggie, and shrimp. I had to try both sauces, so Christmas it was!  This food is authentic, and we enjoyed every bite. The service was superb as well!  A must while in Phoenix!!"}
{"text":"Richardson's is New Mexican Cuisine and is similar to Mexican and Tex Mex but is slightly different. The Big Things here are the Potato stuffed green chile and the do you want Red or Green Chile Sauce question.  I tried the Santa Fe Chicken. It came out on a very large ornate silver platter. I have to say everything on my plate was delicious! The chicken was pecan grilled and was very moist and flavorful. It was topped with sautéed mushrooms and Jalapeño hollandaise sauce and served over tasty garlic toast. It was delicious as it was but I though it was shy with the jalapeño. I had my choice of side and went with the house specialty Potato stuffed Green Chile. It had some heat to it but not too much and was delicious. Also on my plate was a very large salad that was mostly cheese. For me it was WHEY too much cheese but the salad was fresh and lightly dressed with a very thin white dressing.  My husband tried the New Mexican Enchiladas. He had a trio of pork, chicken and beef Christmas Style with Red and Green Chile Sauce also filling the plate was rice and beans. He said everything was seasoned nice and everything tasted different and his plate was also very generous with LOTS OF CHEESE.  Based on this one exsperience the food seems solid but you'll need to cheddar a few pounds if you eat all the cheese.  You Cheddar believe it."}
{"text":"Every time I walk in here, I think... I should eat here more often. Every time I walk out I'm reminded why I don't.   A Mexican restaurant is first judged by their salsa. Theirs stinks. Not the first time I tried it either. I can't believe there is a manager or owner that wants to serve this stuff.    I'm sure there are some solid things on the menu, but I'm continually underwhelmed.   5 star atmosphere. 2 star food.  This place could be famous...their food keeps them from it. Pride is needed from someone."}
{"text":"The food is excellent. We have been coming here for years and have never had a bad meal. The seafood is great!"}
{"text":"This is probably not the best Mexican food in Phoenix but it's also not the worst. However, it might be one of the most overpriced for an enchilada. However, the ambiance kind of makes up for it, I guess. Subpar but edible if you're looking for a quiet low-key spot. Just bring you wallet and cash for valet. Don't ask very unnecessary."}
{"text":"I love this place and in return they love my money! It is a little on the high end folk's but worth every dime, everytime! The fish is wonderful. Actually, now thinking about it I must have eaten here 5-6 times and have only ordered the fish. This time I enjoyed the sampler with 3 different types of fish prepared 3 different ways. The mashed potato stuffed pepper is a must as well. Suggest dining inside though. The patio is great for a drink while waiting for a table. We decided to eat outside and unfortunately had to quickly retreat inside plates in hand due to the flies."}
{"text":"Great food, beautiful atmosphere.  Must have the sopapillas, they are the best in the area.  Worth the drive from other parts of the valley."}
{"text":"My husband and I go here almost every date night. So... The service isn't exceptional and it's almost always busy but you can't beat the vibe. It's cozy and unique. The food is good. It's a matter of personal preference and we do love it, our friends love it (especially when we're down in the basement sitting by the fire enjoying a bottle of wine and socializing). The Rokerij and Richardsons (same owners, sit side by side) are worth visiting. Oh, and another unique spot that's owned by the same is Dick's Hideaway... My husband loves this place."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I had a sad, sad experience at Richardson's a few weeks back. I was tasked with planning a dinner for about 50 of my colleagues who would be traveling to AZ from various parts of the country. Because we have been having the most incredible weather and because Richardson's is known for authentic New Mexican cuisine (which I thought many would not have experienced before) I decided on this restaurant's patio for our setting.   Working with the events manager was great, she was very responsive and easy to work with, I had great expectations! Sadly, it all went to sh*t on the night of the dinner. First of all, they had two servers on a 50+ person party. Whaaa? I felt bad for the servers as they were completely set up to fail. Second, when one of my colleagues asked if some of our tables could get water, after waiting 45 minutes, the manager got in her face. Inappropriate!   The manager later apologized and our colleagues who had not yet been greeted or helped were quickly taken care of. I appreciate them stepping up but these thing should have never happened in the first place. As great as the food was, and that is the only reason for my two stars, I will not be heading back to Richardson's anytime soon."}
{"text":"This is high end Mexican food. The ambience is so wonderful as well as the service and food. It is very cozy so great for a date."}
{"text":"We have been to Richardson's many times in the past -- but after moving away and returning recently we decided to go with some local friends last night.  We have not been to Richardson's since the original (which we LOVED) burned down.  We had a 6:45 reservation and could only be seated on the patio -- which was fun, festive, and comfortable.  However, we had to wait a bit for our table so we sat at the bar and ordered up a few drinks.  The bartender was inattentive and aloof -- and the drinks -- margaritas, were horrible!  We were a bit surprised by this.  When we were seated at the table the bartender, again, was our server.  Before we even had a chance to get settled in she came over to take our appetizer order.  We explained that we needed some time because we were just getting settled in, and we still had our bar drinks in front of us.  In less than 5 minutes she was back again -- and quite annoyed that we weren't \"ready.\"    We decided to order appetizers.  When they arrived we were told the plates were HOT and to be careful.  Actually, the plates were barely warm!!  The queso was nearly cold and the skewers were cold as well!  We waited for her to return but she didn't -- so we picked at the appetizer and continued to talk.  When she finally showed up she was ready to take our order but didn't ask about the appetizers, so we told her they were presented cold.  She said, \"Hmmm, well you managed to eat most of it!\"  How inappropriate was THAT?? And, again, we weren't ready to order because we were busy talking AND we wanted her to get back so we could tell her the appetizers were unacceptable.  Finally, we ordered.  We asked her to please be sure the entrees were warm. Oh, they were warm, alright.  Each of us ordered something different but our plates looked almost identical -- TONS of red chile and everything was dark brown -- burned looking.  My burrito was unrecognizable and so covered in the red sauce as to be unpalatable.  The chile relleno was so-so.   We LOVE spicy food and love spicy chile! This was just unacceptable! Each of us picked at our plates and decided to give it up.  It was horrible! When the server resurfaced and asked if we wanted boxes (because most of our entrees were still on the plate), we told her we didn't.  Again, she didn't even ask if there was a problem!  This visit was not only disappointing, we will NEVER return.  Oh - and the tab for 4 of us was $180.  That would be okay IF the service and food was good!! This server was inattentive, annoying, and not service oriented AT ALL!  She got a 10% tip (and we are typically 20-25% tippers) and left.  We were also quite surprised that a manager didn't come around to check on things.  I can't believe they get repeat customers if that bartender/server is what they have to offer on the patio.  HORRIBLE!!!!!"}
{"text":"Very good...service food and great customer service we arrived at six pm my fiancé birthday wanted to make it special wanted Mexican steaks another application recommend this place very good we did not have reservations  (Saturday night) they made accommodations and made a spontaneous adventure very special my honey had a stuffed pork chop n green chili stuffed with sweet potatoes very good i had their special steak and roasted Brussels sprouts the steak had the best green chili sauce spicy.  Great service by Michelle thank you for making my honeys day that extra special"}
{"text":"Such an amazing dinner! Porterhouse and Halibut entrees were amazing. Happy hour menu standouts included chipotle ribs, New Mexican sausages, bacon wrapped shrimp, and stuffed jalapeños."}
{"text":"I like places that are different. This place is like no other. Be prepared to try something you don't normally get. Our table ordered green chili meat loaf, green chili stew, breakfast burrito and a Carne avoda. They were all very tasty.   If you're a foodie and like food experiences, than this I a good one. I'll be back"}
{"text":"Amazing food and our server was radical!   She suggested a delicious red wine :  Catena, \"Vista Flores\", Argentina, Mablec, '12 AND informed us that on certain nights select wine bottles are half off! We felt like winners before even getting our appetizer.  The apps written on the board all sounded grand but we are suckers for the super spicy jalapeño poppers so we stick with them. Both of us loved our entrees and truly I bet I'd be happy eating anything on the menu here. Everything has been so delicious here and at Dicks Hideaway. We favored the ambience here though, and now we have two fabulous places to pick from, depending on our presently desired ambience.  We are coming back soon! Thanks for being so awesome!"}
{"text":"I've always wanted to eat at Richardson's and I finally did-  My family of three walked in on a Saturday night (around 5:30) without a reservation and we were sat in a corner booth full of pillows. I loved that it was dark and private with the Red Hot Chili Peppers playing softly over the speakers. The bar was packed and so was the dining room.   When you are an Arizona native you know that salsa is important - three salsa's were served: habanero, spicy pico and a mild (for the kid!). I ordered the blackened scallops with three dipping sauces, rice and beans. 2 thumbs up! My husband ordered the tasty Santa Fe chicken - lot's of flavor! The buttermilk ranch dressing is heavenly if you like that sort of thing.   Nice beer and wine list. They also have top dollar margarita that I plan to partake in after my pregnancy. We will be back! Maybe for breakfast?"}
{"text":"Worst excuse for a newMexican restaurant in Phoenix Grizzly meat used during happy hour, very cheap way to service guests, expensive and can do much better going to Scottsdale's frank and Lupe."}
{"text":"Went on a whim based on a friend's recommendation.  This is not \"tex mex\" but upscale food with Mexican or New Mexican influence.  Prickly pear margarita was excellent, the house salad that came with the entree was good, the jalepano ranch was not at all spicy, but had good flavor.  I had the steak and the portion was huge.  After eating an appetizer (chorizo spinach queso) I couldn't even eat 1/2 my entree. :) the twice baked potato in the green chili was cool and it isn't a sweet potato :) the atmosphere was laid back and decor was cool.  The outdoor space is another restaurant? All in all a good meal and experience."}
{"text":"My favorite place in the neighborhood!  Be chill when you come here.  You can get some food quick but the personality and character of this place is found by taking your time.  The food is amazing and cooked with heart over an open flame.  Get your sauces Christmas.  Always the Duck relleno.  The seabass never disappoints.  Stafg: Rick, Lauren, Robert, Will always be great for you.  Enjoy our neighborhood gem.  To all the no talent asshats posting poor reviews about our local favorite, go to taco $mell.

{"text":"Very average new Mexican food. Have been to New Mexico, and while I don't expect a restaurant in Phoenix to match restaurants in Santa Fe, this one unfortunately is not even close. Both red and green chillies which really are the hallmark of new Mexican cuisine are very sub-par. Red chili was a bit bitter and the green chili was just a low on flavor gooey mess. The service was very inattentive as well, too long to take orders or pick up the check. Just remember sitting and waiting for something to happen most of the evening. A lot of mistakes were made as well, the waitress nodded to acknowledge our special requests like \"only green chili and not Christmas\"  but the dishes eventually came out as they were described on the menu. Don't think we'll be back"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, this is my first negative review of a restaurant. New to the Phoenix area, my husband and I went to Richardson's yesterday evening, per our hotel concierge's recommendation.  We ordered drinks, appetizers, and two main courses. I tried the Carne Asada Pizza, and after the first bite, I could barely take another. It was UNBELIEVABLY spicy (the meat was fine, but the pizza sauce was not). It completely ruined the flavor and taste of the pizza - and the over-seasoning of the sauce made it completely inedible. I'm even tolerant towards spicy food and enjoy most meals 'with a kick', but this entree had a BOOT of ruined spicy flavor - and I'm now convinced there was a mistake in the kitchen with over-seasoning/peppering the plate, which I understand can happen on occasion. I tried a few more bites, hoping I had just gotten a flick of habanero pepper, but each subsequent bite was just as bad, TOO hot. My husband could tell I was struggling (ie eyes watering, guzzling water, lips on fire), so I offered a bite to him, to see if my judgement was skewed, and after he tasted, he said 'no, you're right! It's like 'burn a hole in your stomach spicy'!'  And this is when our experience turned for the worse. I've never had to tell a server that I can't eat a plate because it's too spicy, but I respectfully pulled ours aside, and informed her of the situation. I thought she'd be more understanding and would offer to send the dish back and simply have it re-cooked, with less spice. But all she offered me, was a quick, 'I'm sorry.... can I bring you some sour cream?' She explained that the sauce was made like that and never offered to fix the dish (or inform the cook) - but merely asked if I wanted to order something else. After I told her, 'no, I don't need sour cream (which would not have fixed the dish regardless) nor did I want to order (and wait) for another entree,' she took my completely uneaten plate, and the WORST part, brought the check, fully charging us for the pizza (which hadn't been touched, minus the few small, trial bites). It wasn't worth arguing about, but we were most disappointed with the service and the handling of the situation (the server/restaurant could have simply comped the pizza, right?!). While the ambiance of Richardson's (and all other food we tried) was great, we wish they could have better handled the situation of a seriously bad plate. For this, we will never return or recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"It's Saturday morning at 11:27 am, and I should be at Richardson's savoring a Richardsons combo with a jalapeño benedict (with pork loin and jalapeño hollandaise) and two chicken enchiladas with both red and green sauce (why settle when you can have both).  I would also even have some of the asparagus they throw on the plate so you can feel that you had a healthy meal.  I should be washing it all down with a bloody mary requested to be \"just a little spicy\", so that it has just enough of a spicy kick for me.  Or maybe I should branch out and have the carne adovada and eggs or huevos rancheros or anything on that wonderful brunch menu.  And maybe I should go a second time to award the coveted 5th star, just to make sure it's excellence was not a fluke.  But instead, I'm writing about it.  Should have, could have, would have, but didn't.  Well this is just depressing, so I'm headed to the tamale festival instead.  But I'm thinking Richardson's tomorrow."}
{"text":"We have been frequenting Richardson's for the last three years at least 3-4 times a month. The last time we visited the hostess sat us in what I like to refer to as the concrete-hole booth where no one can see you and you cannot see out (if you've been there you know which one I'm talking about). The hostess then neglected telling our server we were there so we sat in the concrete abyss for nearly 15 minutes before our server peeked over the wall at us. That visit ended well as the server knew how upset we were and did everything she could to make it right.   However, today we had a server I never met before. She left us sit for a while too, but we were in full view of her and every other staff member. When she finally came to our table, we inquired about chocolate milk for my granddaughter and received an emphatic \"NO\", not \"No, I'm sorry we don't have chocolate milk but we do have...\" just a rude abrupt NO followed by silence. Then my scrambled eggs arrived with the entire top of the pile just sort of jellied, not runny but definitely 'jellied'. She kindly took them back to the kitchen to throw back on the grill for a second or two. She returned with a plate of rubbery, burnt eggs and told me next time I need to request \"hard scrambled\". Well, NO dear lady, next time I would like my eggs scrambled the way they should be, soft and fluffy with no jellied grossness hanging around the top or the middle. We then sat, and sat,  and sat, and sat staring at my pile of uneaten food and my companions dirty dishes. When she ignored us and walked away one last time I said, \"Excuse me Ma'am. Can we get our check please.\" At this point I was met with a rude \"Give me a minute!\" accompanied by a feisty glare. My husband then suggested maybe I should wait outside while he settled the bill. Good thing for her I took his advice because I don't generally respond well to rude, feisty glares.   Richardson's... I am sorely disappointed and this last experience will probably keep me from coming back because if you try to seat me in that girls station I'll get up and leave. You should do the math: 3-4 times a month at nearly $100 a pop. That's a lot of lost revenue.  And since I'll be sure to share my experience with others, you should remember, word of mouth is a powerful advertising tool as well.   I used to love you. Now I'm just booooooo Richardson's, I'm taking my money down the street."}
{"text":"This place is the most amazing ambience and food I have had in a long time! I loved it! They have Rye!!! As in Whiskey!   Very cool vibe and the food was so good. I even tried to come home and copy their Roasted Green Chili Baked potato... I didn't do it justice, so I will need to go back and have it again.   The place is small, and the parking non-existent, but they have complimentary valet and that helps. Get there early or make sure to make reservations.   LOVED THIS PLACE! Loved everything about it!"}
{"text":"I would like to try Richardson's again. I went on a date here and we were going to order a couple things off the menu, but the manager said, \"Let me take care of you- you're going to love this\". We looked at each other (date and I) and were like, \"Ok, I guess\".  The manager sent out a garlic plate. It wasn't the worst thing for a date, since roasted garlic isn't stinky, but it was a cheesy heavy gross mess for me. I'm not into that kind of food at all and would have much preferred to choose something different. It was huge as well, we couldn't even finish it and didn't have any room to try any entrees on the menu.   So, well, next time I know better and will stick to my own palate preferences rather than be persuaded by  a stranger that thinks first date food should be the size and style of a fancy superbowl platter. The dish wasn't gross, but it was incredibly heavy for 2 people. i might order that as an app if I was with a party of 4 or larger.  Overall, the place is beautiful and it's a great date spot. Call ahead and make a reservation though. I hope one day I can go again and try something that I like better."}
{"text":"We're in town from Los Angeles and found this spot on BringFido.  Once again, BringFido delivers!  We were immediately greeted with a bowl of ice water for the pups and seated on the cool, shaded patio.  Overhead fans keep the area in the 70's in spite of triple-digit temperatures outside.  The chips and salsa are a MUST (housemade warm chips and 3 amazing salsas).  Very dog friendly (they have pork and chicken menu options for your pups at a reasonable price), and service and food were impeccable.  I had the New Mexican platter with a sampling of dishes - cheese relleno (excellent - my favorite!), chicken burrito (moist and flavorful), bacon-wrapped shrimp, rice and beans and red and green chile sauces.  The presentation was beautiful and the portions were enormous!  Paired with a margarita, it was a very memorable meal.  Service is warm and friendly here.  They clearly care about your experience."}
{"text":"Ouch, where do I start? I should have known better when I realized they only had valet. Our dear friends recommended this place and were meeting us there, that is the only reason we stayed. We asked for self parking and they said to park at Runner's Den.... now I am wondering if they have an agreement with them or if they send people there just because. We sat and were welcomed by \"Absolutely no split plates\" and \"no separate checks\" notes on our menus. : ) Friendly business, uh? Our server was pushing for appetizers (asked multiple times before and after our friends arrived), but once we were ready to order she was nowhere to be seen for a while.  We also asked for straws and she gave them to us grabbing them from the top where your lips are supposed to go! I think that was by far the worse. Other than that she was OK and friendly. I do not know anything about New Mexico food but I do not have respect for places that spell adovada with a 'v', and that do not peel the green chiles : o Over all I thought the place was kind of 'uppity' for my taste (I am a very very simple gal), and I would at least have expected them to have options for artificial sweeteners, but they (oh surprise) only had the pink saccharine ones. OK, enough bickering : ) The food was good, the portions (other than the adovada) were generous and everyone agreed they were tasty. I think one of our friends had the New Mexico plate and it was huge. I am OK with the food, but for the prices they have I would expect excellent customer service and Stevia, Splenda or at least Nutrasweet. I am on a special diet but was even afraid to ask, lol... The hostess was very nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great staff. Great food. Great environment. Tops all around.   I recommend the specials. Their fish is fantastic. The prime rib is ridiculously good.  Everything on the menu is top-notch. I especially like the sausages, so give everything a try it's worth it."}
{"text":"This is a touch of class infused with New Mexican style cuisine. Steeped deep with Hatch Green Chilies and New Mexican/Southwestern flair, these dishes are well conceived and incredible. The flavors abound and melt in your mouth.  The dining areas are upscale even though the dress code is not. The outside bar at the Rokerij is a treat and lends easy access to either dining location. There are a wide array of draft beers on tap, as well as a fairly extensive wine list that is sure to please any palate.  Twyla and I had the New Mexican Enchiladas that were well prepared and delicious. These gems showcase just enough heat to keep you alert but not so much that your ordering milk with dinner. The dress is casual and the ambiance is intimate. This is great date place to sit, chat, enjoy vino and find out what a weirdo you met on Mingle; kidding! However, whether a special occasion, chilling with the crew or a night out with that certain someone, Richardson's and the RokeriJ will fit the bill nicely. Check out their menus on line...  #Vino2 #Vino2ultimate #Vinosquared #IrishcatV2  #jimsboisset"}
{"text":"I asked for a straw for my water and the server told me that they aren't allowed to give out straws anymore, that it \"came from the top\".  Meanwhile, my boyfriend sees a glass at the bar completely filled with straws (as well as bar sitting customers' drinks with straws) so he gets up and takes one.  The next thing we know, someone has put the glass of straws out of sight.  The server comes to check on us, notices the straw in my drink and asks me where I got it.  Are you kidding me???  At $40+ a person she is going to interrogate me about a straw?  How dare they!!!!    Well they just lost previously loyal customers who have been coming her for over 18 years!!!!"}
{"text":"Food was good, drinks were alright, our server, Michelle was sweet but it didn't really seem like she knew what she was doing... She didn't mention any of the drink specials and did not pace any of our food out, so it all came at once. And then she brought us the check when we didn't even ask for it? It was our cousins 50th birthday and we spent quite a bit of money. Perhaps she is new and in need of more training....?"}
{"text":"Their 3 and a half star overall rating is quite generous, in my opinion. The ambiance...eh. The food...heed the warnings regarding portions! I have no problems with taking food home so it doesn't go to waste but, this was nowhere near good enough to even bother. Humongous and ridiculous are the first 2 words that pop into my head. SHARE! We had issues with seating and service but, I was waiting on the food to determine my final opinion. I'm not impressed with the flavor at all. My mom and I had Chimayo Chicken. Asiago is great in moderation. The Chimayo Chicken is not only stuffed with Asiago but, also served on a BED of Asiago! The medley vegetables are...just...a weird combination and not cooked enough. I like my steamed veggies cooked until there is just a bit of crunch. These were way undercooked. The \"home of the green chile potato\" dish was very bland. I definitely expected more since it's a signature dish. Besides being bland it didn't look or taste fresh. It seemed reheated to me. If it wasn't reheated keep that in mind for the taste you expect. Just overall terrible really. Will never go back."}
{"text":"Good food, terrible service. Maybe nice for a bar dinner for two, but definitely not kid-friendly.  We went today to catch a celebratory brunch for a few family achievements. My wife and I tow along a toddler and an infant, and we wanted to get a table for 6, for the other family coming in. The hostess looked at us like we were blood-stained hobos or something, and seemed oh-so-upset that she had to take us to our table. When we asked if there were high chairs or accommodations for the infant in the car seat, she flatly replied no and suggested we could put our infant on the floor. You know, totally normal restaurant practice.  The staff, from bus boy to waiters, seemed to do just the bare minimum. No smiles or friendly talk, and it was almost like they didn't want to make eye contact. I'm Asian so with my squinty eyes I can understand if people have a hard time making eye contact. But my in-laws have perfectly normal eyes. One waitress, who was also attending at the bar, was nice enough to talk to us a bit, but was too busy and eventually had to ask another grumpy person to take care of us.   Anytime we had questions, like whether we could sit outside, or where the restroom is, or, oh I don't know, if we could I have a water refill, we'd be met with what looked like eye-rolling. We all felt uncomfortable. I actually felt relieved to leave, eventually.   Food was nice, but not good enough to warrant coming back for."}
{"text":"I've been going here for 9 years solid. The most heartbreaking thing is seeimg how the management, staff, and cooks have been turned over so much lately. The service quality is nothing like it usedd to be. And the food quality is declining each time I return. The guys at the Hideaway are the only people keeping this place alive in my opinion. Damn, I hope the day never comes when I say this place sucks!"}
{"text":"Incredible ambience and amazing food.  Very different than your average Mexican food spot.  Things are spicy since its New Mexican flavor so be prepared.  A hole on the wall spot that doesn't get as much attention that it deserves."}
{"text":"Came here with my family. Have been coming here for years. My step dad Alex is friends with Eric and Phil. We waited for more than 40min to get seated and noticed 2 people got seated ahead of us when they had came minutes after us. We spoke with the manager Clark and instead of just saying he would speak with the people who are in charge of seating us, he kept talking back to my step dad. I don't know what happened to customer service, but it has gone down slowly. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Food is 5 Star stuff  Service was AWEFUL! From the moment we sat down, our server, an older blonde lady, was rude, passive aggressive and truly toxic.  Carne Adovada was amazing! Margaritas were solid but overpriced.  It is a total shame when a server ruins an entire evening. $375.00 check for 8 people. You would think she would try a little kindness considering there is a pretty good tip coming their way.  Oh well, maybe next time. The bus boy was nice!"}
{"text":"What a disaster! Our food was late, they lost our orders, they do not take separate checks. The food, when it finally came, was very good but the service was worse than any place I have ever ate in my life. This is 2.5 hrs of my life I will never recover."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for dinner while staying at the Four Seasons. Food was delicious and our waiter was such a nice guy. Very helpful in guiding us through the menu and making sure we tried the top Dishes. The tostadas, quesadilla, enchiladas, and pork abodabo were all awesome. Our eyes were bigger than our stomachs - but we got plenty to take home for leftovers."}
{"text":"My favorite place for a hearty breakfast and memories of home (Though I've lived a lot of places, I claim New Mexico). There is NOTHING like good chile and it's near impossible to find after crossing the NM state line. The adovada and the shrimp enchiladas here meet the challenge!  ...So do the huevos rancheros.   Heck!   You really can't go wrong! (And,  YAY for $5 mimosas!)  And for dinner, my favorite is the pork tenderloin, moist and sweet, basted with a green and red chili jelly and the \"famous\" GCP (a chile stuffed with cheesy mashed potatoes and baked).  As much as I like the hip Dick's Hideaway location, I'm grateful for a greater shot at a table and the \"new\" Richardson's location just a smidge up the street."}
{"text":"Wow. Do not dine here. Please let me list the reasons why...  Made a reservation three weeks in advance for a seven top reso for a bunch of Chicago 20 something's in town to go out and have a great night in Phoenix.  Our server was non existent throughout our entire dinner... Our plan was to dine... Translation, spend money! No one was served more than one cocktail. When asked what to order, we were answered with; everything is good. We relied on one girl who has been here before to walk us through the menu. Food came out staggered, and when the food arrived, we asked the food runner (who was clearly the rude host with short spiked boy hair) which entree had meat and which had cheese... (We had a vegetarian in the group) she responded with, \"I don't know, this is not my job\" Okay, really?! As we are all completely done with this place, and parched because our waters hadn't been refilled on the 90 degree patio. I thought that I should just let the manager know about how much money they lost out on, and more importantly how neglectful his sever was. His response; I wish you would have told me earlier so that I could have fixed it. (Mind you, our entrees were still on the table) No, I'm sorry, no, let me send you dessert. No, apology or care for my complaint in anyway.... Talk about one, the server. Two, the host/food runner. Three, the MANAGER... Dropping the ball! Needless to say, we will never be back. We have now wrote this review, so hopefully other people don't go here. And lastly, to whom ever reads this internally. Find a manager who values the customer... And get a training program in place for all your other staff members who interact with the people who pay your bills."}
{"text":"Sensational Carne Adova. I normally don't like beans, but this place changed my mind. The tortillas are fluffy, and the smoked pork is unbelievably tender. The decor is eye catching and features tables made of copper. This place is busy and rightly so!"}
{"text":"This is my brothers favorite restaurant in Phoenix and he and his GF took me and my husband here for Easter Brunch when we were visiting. Who knew the food scene in Phoenix was so hip and classy? They have really great food and the decor is super. Punched copper bar, adobe like ambiance, with a fire pit and outdoor seating that looks really cozy. New Mexican cuisine is one of my favorites so it already had me at hello. The menu is really classic mexican-ish with a tweek of gourmet. Such as Huevos Rancheros with Crab or what have you. We had blood orange juice, yum-, a Garlic Plate app. Was out of this world with roasted elephant garlic bulbs and several kind of cheeses melted over red and green fire roasted chile salsa and onions and little crustinis to use like a bruchetta I am guessing, which was clever. My Chile Relleno was really great, everything cooked perfect. Hubby got chile verde and eggs (forgive me I dont know the exact name of the dishes) he loved it. My brother and his girlfried said they havent had anything they didnt love. Its one of those places that makes you wanna stay a while...you can tell the owner really takes pride. I hope you go check this out when visiting Phoenix because its really worth the trip!"}
{"text":"I am not sure if I just dislike Mexican fusion, so I have to preface with that. I don't think I do. The waitstaff was very friendly. The food was mediocre. I had a special, tilapia with cheese. It was OK. Tasted like something I could do. The other three diners seemed to enjoy their food. I think it was a little overpriced too."}
{"text":"Amazing New Mexico cuisine!  I highly recommend the Carne Adovada with eggs for brunch or dinner... It has so much flavor with just the right amount of heat to make it enjoyable to the pallet.  My next favorite is the chili relleno stuffed with pork.  Can't get enough of this place.  Our server Susanna was amazing and is a definite must to sit in her area.  Great food and great service, what a winning combination!"}
{"text":"LOVE IT LOVE IT!! Every entree is delicious but the Sea Bass is the best outstanding and I order it every time we go to Richardsons. We love to take friends there to introduce them to the quality of food and comfortable environment. It's on the top of our list of Best Restaurants in the Valley!"}
{"text":"They are open again!  The green chili soup is delicious and is like playing Russian Roulette.  Sometimes it's super spicy, sometimes its manageable.  Pork Adovada is the standard here.  What I like is that you can also order off of the Rokerij menu and the wine menu is exactly the same which is nice.  They have a great patio which you should take advantage of if you can.  I'm still annoyed that they can't just give you a chile relleno a la carte, you have to get the entire plate.  These are the quirks that you deal with when you come here.   The service is friendly and yes the prices are still a dollar or two, too high, but then again, it looks exactly like the old restaurant, so the same gripes and same good stuff are all there."}
{"text":"What's the deal with Rokerij and Richardson's?  We thought we were hanging out at Rokerij and it turned out to be Richardson's.  They aren't the same place but they are in the same place?  The valet parking is set up so that it drops you off at Richardson's entrance, see the confusion?  As we were sitting there I remember thinking, \"I don't know what all the fuss is about.\"  The oysters were good, the wine was alright, the ambiance was okay - western decor isn't really my thing.  My friend and I sat at the bar and the bartender was sweet but not really attentive.  Hopefully we'll pick door number two next time and end up at the right place."}
{"text":"How anyone can rate this place below five stars is ridiculous!!  Everything from the excellent service to the tasty and perfectly mixed margaritas to the perfectly spiced eats -- simply amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"This is as New Mexico as it gets. Everything from the Spanish tile on the floor to the decor and artwork in the building. This was my second time here and both times I left very satisfied with my meal and the service. As a warning you should like spicy foods if you are going to try this spot. The Adovado and New Mexican Enchilada are the 2 plates I have eaten. Both were really good. I am definitely making this a spot to stop at when craving a spicy dish. It can be pricy and is a bit upscale."}
{"text":"Took clients here for lunch.   If you like spicy southwestern food, this is the place for you.   One of my clients even ordered a side of habanero salsa cause it wasn't quite spicy enough.   Guess what??  That sauce could be considered a bit on the hot side!    Since we were celebrating an almost closing on their house, she had the mimosa, and he and I had the bloody mary.   I don't normally order bloody marys, but even that was a bit on the spicy side.   It was good, though.   If I was into bloody marys, that's what I'd get, at least, from here.   I like the spiciness of it.  I ordered my standard carne adovada, he had the corn enchiladas and she had the pork carnitas.   (Or was it the other way around??)  Still love the carne adovada.   It comes with rice and beans, and I added some of the habanero salsa as well.   They both stated they loved what they ordered albeit he said his enchiladas was a bit spicy.  I definitely would come here again.   It's my go to place for southwestern food in the desert."}
{"text":"I have been a big fan of Richardson's since its old location and love it and its sister restaurants, Dick's and Rockerij.  The food is fantastic, creative and always hot which is something I really like.  Went there today for lunch and the food did not disappoint.  The service, however, was a different matter.  Our waitress was not pleasant and either completely overwhelmed or just incapable.  We would have had at least two additional rounds of drinks for the 5 of us but we had a tough time finding our waitress.  Even getting our water glasses refilled was tough.  We actually had to go find someone it was so bad.  We asked her for an additional silver setup which she brought but when we again asked for more water and if she could find our waitress so we could order more drinks, we got attitude and the its not my section look.  In addition to being non existent for most of the visit when she was around our waitress was really bit**y and showed no personality or interest in us being there.  We were there for almost two hours to get through lunch and while the food was good, its tough to enjoy when you can't even get a glass of water.  Lastly, we ordered red beers and rather than charging us the $3.50 beer price plus some amount for a little hot sauce we got billed for full on bloody Mary's.  Not a big deal but didn't really seem right.  We will ultimately go back but with their understaffed or just poorly trained service they missed out on an additional $70 in drinks from our table alone and probably one or two visits over the next month until we just can't stay away any longer.  Really hoping the next experience will be better."}
{"text":"Typically someplace we'd come for fantastic Mexican-infused munchies & drinks. The wait staff and bar tenders were always professional and attentive, and the food was fresh and had rich flavors, as well as a chill energy. The downstairs bar was like a groovy cave, dimly lit and a din with chatter and music. Tonight was different: the wait staff fell far short of expectations, as did the food. The salad drenched in dressing, the fish -- fishy, and the pasta way short of al dente. Maybe it was a fluke, but it felt more like commercial TexMex in ambiance, disinterested service, and in a dull, super salty, and unhealthy cuisine. I hope management gets itself centered and focuses on doing things the right way. Too expensive to be disappointing."}
{"text":"I had lunch here one afternoon when it was surprisingly not crowded. I am giving four stars for an always cozy atmosphere and a nice patio.  I had the enchiladas which had a nice kick, especially the pork. But the quality if the food in relation to the price is what gets me. Everything is good but not great enough to warrant the prices. And the service is almost always lacking.  This particular time, we seemed to be the victim of our server going on break and their being a breakdown in communication or coordination. In any case, we had to  wait a while before our drinks were refilled and my salad was forgotten. Our server was nice and apologetic so no worries. Not always the case as some servers make it clear that they are way above looking after the likes of us.  So overall, not a bad place, the prices, quality and atttiude serve as enough of a deterrent to patronize again in the future."}
{"text":"My family went to Richardson's for dinner and it was the WORST dining experience any of us has EVER HAD.   I cannot believe that any good reviews of this restaurant are real. To start, the food was terrible. All the plates came out separately and my moms almost 15 minutes after everyone else's. Her meal had been over cooked for so long the food was burnt and stuck to the plate. The kitchen staff and our waiter had obviously forgotten about it. Our waiter had also forgotten to ring in appetizers on 2 separate occasions... the 2nd time the item never did make it to the table. When we told the waiter about my moms dinner he rolled his eyes and said \"it's supposed to be hot\" and then walked off while we were still talking to him. Next thing I know another staff member walks up and just starts clearing off everyone else's plate from the table without asking if anyone else was done...which we weren't. Then our waiter shows up again with the bill. DUDE... WHAT?   5 minutes later another guy comes up and asks: NOW are you done? I said no I wasn't and he responded --Well, I wasn't talking to YOU!! Needless to say everyone was beyond rude and has no business being in the customer service industry.   We all agreed that the staff is on drugs. I am not joking around when I say that. Their behavior and mannerisms were not normal. Oh and we all got the shits from the little food that we did eat. Having the runs while being hungry is the worst."}
{"text":"My first time here and I have to say, it did not live up to its expectations. From the moment we got there, the hostess was rude and when I asked if they could turn the air up before my friend turned into a popsicle, we were declined. I then asked if we could turn the fan off right above us and she still said no without any explanation. I ordered the shrimp enchiladas and I would say there was MAYBE three pieces of shrimp in the entire dish.   Splitting up the check was a nightmare since we were told they dont do seprate checks , she came over probably every two minutes to make sure we were moving along in the bill splitting process. It was not relaxing, enjoyable or worthwhile. It was a going away dinner for one of my friends and I was sad to say that upon leaving, I knew she wasn't thrilled with the service or the food."}
{"text":"went on a tuesday, not too busy.  i had the sea bass, others had the porterhouse.  service was good, seabass was excellent.  portions are quite large so i would stay away from appetizers.  overall good southwestern food.  nice bar and outside lounge area."}
{"text":"My daughter recommended this Resturant & said the food was good & a fun place. We loved it & plan to go back soon!  She was right on!"}
{"text":"We went for a friend's birthday and were impressed with the food.  The service was average, but the ambience made up for it. It looks like it has an excellent happy hour."}
{"text":"My husband and I enjoyed Richardson's for years and were devastated when the original location burned down. Until recently, we hadn't had an opportunity to visit the new location that's in the same building as Rokerji, but some friends came to visit and we decided to take them. I have to say that we were delighted to see that the decor was exactly as it was in the original restaurant! The service was as fantastic as it's always been, and the food is unparalleled. Everything is prepared perfectly. I highly recommend the pinenut encrusted sea bass!"}
{"text":"I come here every time I'm in PHX.  Great wine superb food awesome atmosphere.  Service usually excellent except during crunch times.  Definitely get a reservation or expect to wait!  Osso bucco is phenominal!!!"}
{"text":"Have you heard of New Mexican food? Let's be clear, I'm not talking about Mexican (at least that's what the locals in the area want you to believe)... my take? Mexican, New Mexican, who cares? IT'S SO GOOD!  Margaritas are strong and tasty. Portions are large and delicious. If you get a combo you're in for a mix of meat/poultry/fish (your choice), beans, rice, cheese, diced tomatoes... the works. The cheese brings it all together and presto - you've got yourself one hell of a New Mexican meal =)  Three salsas served to start, one has a great kick. I can't promise you'll be able to really distinguish between Mexican and New Mexican, but I can promise you'll enjoy your meal."}
{"text":"You fill up quickly in this place.  My wife has always told me how much she loved New Mexican from a summer spent there and this upscale rendering did not dissapoint.    I had a gimlet with a splash of grapefruit juice.  It was good  but with no room at the bar while we waited (make reservations of you have a chance) as they used it primarily as overflow for dinners at both bars and told not to go downstairs to the bar as no cell service down there...  We were offered a chance to dine at the bar and debated but decided against it which seemed to irk the hostess a bit.  We started with the scallops which were grilled perfectly, huge and on a flour tortilla which contained rice, beans, queso and green chillies.  Really wish I had taken a pic.  5 stars for this dish!   I had the New Mexican which included bacon wrapped grilled shrimp, chicken enchilada in red and green Chile sauce and a cheese relleno.  The cheese relleno which was not fully melted in the middle.  Not only hard but also a bit cold in the middle.  I would give 4 stars but the bar situation and no real waiting area irked me a little.  I give 3.5 stars for this, 4 but for the relleno.    We will be back!"}
{"text":"After not having been to Richardson's before they relocated I was less than impressed.  I remembered well the prickly pear margarita that was so good and when I tried it again all i could taste was sweet...no tequila. The service was severely lacking.  We ordered appetizer and had to ask twice as to where they were..  They also refused to put us on separate checks which most restaurants will do. The busboy was actually more helpful than the waitress.  This was actually wasted money as far as I was concerned..The only saving grace were the chili relleno's were pretty good."}
{"text":"French toast , eggs and hashbrowns! Yum! What an amazing breakfast! The portions here are big plan on splitting it with your bestie or a significant other!  The outdoor seating is phenomenal i love the bar and high tops for amazing and personal service and conversation with you wait staff."}
{"text":"This place is definitely worth a try. My family and I came here for a nice hearty brunch and we were not disappointed.   All the dishes we tried were so flavorful. I tried the enchiladas: tried one cheese and one green chile pork. The green chile pork was my favorite. My husband had the carne adovada benedict. I will definitely order that next time. The meat was so tender and had a great smokiness to the red chile. The only downside to the meal was that all over our eggs were over cooked. I didn't send the eggs back but my father did and they were happy to give him eggs cooked to his liking. Overall, we were happy with our experience at Richardson's.  Also, just a heads up, they have valet. I'm not sure if they always have valet but they had it when we went."}
{"text":"So we came here after finding out Rokerij doesn't serve the new Mexican food anymore. My Lil Sis was in town and the rellenos were a must ! My Mom, both Sisters and I came on our girls day after the art museum and shopping. It was the perfect way to end the day ! Our food was amazing !!!!!! The enchiladas and rellenos were out of the world !!! All I wanted in life at that moment ! I also tried the carne adovada and cordon bleu, they were very good also. We had the skewers thinking that were like the rokerij version, but they weren't, still good though. We finished with the flan and sopapillas. The flan was really good. I am not crazy about flan, but I really enjoyed theirs. The sopapillas were good, not authentic, but still very good. I appreciated the density even though it isn't how I have always known them to be."}
{"text":"Such a cool space! The outdoor patio is absolutely beautiful & would be the perfect spot for a group dinner. We sat inside for lunch & started with chips and guac. For my entree I ordered the special of the day, the blackened mahi spinach salad. Huge portion - essentially there was an entire piece of fish on top of a bed of spinach. Definitely couldn't eat the entire thing.  Their happy hour deals look amazing - I'm sure I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Went to richardsons recently for the first time after hearing a lot about it from a friend. The environment was awesome and the staff are super friendly. Our server was Brooke, and she was very friendly and knowledgable about the wine and food. She also took the time to explain the menu to me because it was my first time, and it was much appreciated since she was so busy. Food was out of this world! All together a wonderful experience and I am definitely coming back in the near future!"}
{"text":"We took friends out to dinner last Saturday night- food was a 4 but service was horrible which is why we give the restaurant a 1.  First- it took 2 calls to get a reservation.  When we initially called, the woman that answered said she had to \"confirm with her manager\" and would get back with us in 48 hours.  After receiving no call back for four days, I had to call them back.  Next, at the table, the waiter just could not fathom or remember that our friend was unable to have milk product.  Even after the loooonnng, drawn-out conversation while ordering, he STILL brought her salad with cheese on it (totally discussed during the ordering process).  Finally, and this is the biggest downer of the evening, the bill seemed high and I couldn't see well in the restaurant because of the dimmed lights, but I signed it and paid.  Next day I look it over... We were totally OVERCHARGED... charged for 2 drinks we never had, and the drinks we actually ordered we wrong on the bill.  OVERCHARGED!!!  Don't trust this restaurant... I tried to contact them 4 days ago, received a VM that said to leave a message and they would call back.  No call back.  I left another message a bit ago.  This is seeming like a scam... I'm about to go to the authorities and report it... Very frustrating.  We will not be back and I don't think you should consider going."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! Best New Mexican grille around!! Breakfast is our favorite time to go!! Especially on the outside patio!!"}
{"text":"Yes! I don't know why I have waited so long to leave this place a 5 star review... The food is to die for. The food here is always in big portions but is the best food I have tasted, you can order anything on the menu and be satisfied. My favorites are the benedicts. They have delicious bloody mary's and never leave you with your glass empty. They are open on almost every holiday serving the valley. I recommend this place to all of my friends."}
{"text":"I just had l lunch here. The enchiladas were excellent! The red chile is hotter than the green chile and both were very good. I finished off with the sopapillas. The outdoor patio has a fireplace for temperate desert evenings. I ate at the beautiful brass bar. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Had family in town and wanted to take them to one of my favorite places in The Valley. I should have gone with my gut and not taken the 9:15 reservation but they really wanted to eat here. We were seated at about 9:30 and they were definitely not ready for us. We received water right away and then were assured by the manager that we would be well taken care of. We didn't see our waitress for 15 minutes after that. She was good and very nice considering she was our bartender for an hour and a half while we were waiting for our table drinking. We wanted a pizza and they said they weren't serving them anymore?  Ordered our apps. and they were good. Ordered our dinners and the Caesar salads came out without dressing. Ouch. Dinners were OK. Just not as good as every time else I have been there. Oh well. Maybe it was too late in the evening."}
{"text":"What a wonderful evening to start out with happy hour and mike I or ( my guy ) excellent food from grilled shrimp to creme burlee fun friend, tequila ... Had a great time mike was on top of it at least we were one of few customers on the patio ."}
{"text":"Hour plus wait after ordering. Nobody came to check on us during wait. Brought all three meals out separately and left the child until last. Poor execution. Daughter is crying.   Place is all fail today   Food was excellent as always however."}
{"text":"Great food! Pork chop was a tad over cooked but flavors are amazing! Fish specials are the way to go. Lots of food, great service and atmosphere. I only wish I could cook with that much flavor."}
{"text":"Another GREAT restaurant. From the cocktails, to the appetizers, the main course, and the after dinner drinks, this was one of the best dining experiences I've had. I ordered the Carne Adovada but substituted a green chili potato for the rice and beans, and it was uh-MAZING. My husband got the Pork Mole, and if I hadn't loved my dish so much, I would've traded him.   I only wish it wasn't such a drive, because their happy hour items look just as good as everything else I had. Next time I'm in town, Richardson's, I've got a hot date with you."}
{"text":"I came to Richardson's straight from the PHX airport.  I was eager to eat good food and be outside as I had just came from Chicago aka Chi-beria (-9 degrees).  I was on a business trip, so I sat alone at the outdoor bar.  The bar tender was really friendly and whipped me up a skinny margarita (which was very refreshing).  The menu is huge and they also have a lot of specials.  I should've looked on Yelp prior to ordering to get some guidance on what was best.  I ended up with a fish special - Mahi Mahi w/ mango salsa, ranchero mashed potatoes, and broccolini.  I wanted so badly to give Richardson's four stars, but two things held me up:  1) Side salad was served w/ ranch...maybe I am being too harsh, but ranch dressing is one of the worst dressings for you and they could've offered me another alternative. 2) Mahi Mahi had a bit of a sour flavor (not sure how to describe it) and was kind of tough  Otherwise, the dish was plated very lovely - very colorful!  The mashed potatoes were served in a jalapeno.  The broccolini and asparagus were cooked perfectly and had a corn sauce over them.  The mango salsa was not very ripe, so it was not very sweet as I had expected.  I love the ambiance here and I would definitely come back to try one of their other many dishes."}
{"text":"Food is awesome being from NM- like amazing. But service - being in the industry.. ehh."}
{"text":"The food was good - I had the scallops which had three different sauces and beans and rice. My husband had the kabobs (I assume they were good as he didn't save any for me to taste!) I had a glass of wine however, the drink of the night was the prickly pear margarita. Not too sweet and very easy to drink. The only reason for the 4 star review was the service was not good at the start."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday for lunch and was seated inside in the bar area. My husband sat down and the cushion he was sitting on was soaking wet. His pants then became wet and when we told the waiter she just said sorry and took the whole cushion/pillows off. We had a sleeping baby in the car seat carrier and the waitress was pretty loud which woke her up. I know it wasn't really her fault really but that made me a little annoyed since I had to hold the baby the entire time now instead of enjoying my meal. It took a little for the food to get there and refills weren't very often. Had to ask her twice for another sprite. The food itself was okay. We came during brunch so maybe if we come during lunch or dinner and try out the menu things might change but the brunch/breakfast wasn't worth it for me. But my husband and brother liked what they ordered."}
{"text":"Their food is just too good to not give them 5 stars even if sometimes the staff is a little slow.  Good food is worth the wait!"}
{"text":"This is such a shame. My boyfriend and I came here last Valentine's Day, to walk into the restaurant and find out that they lost our reservation that was made weeks in advanced, and called the day before to confirm our reservation. Then we get there and they lost our reservation, we had to wait 45 minutes to be seated. THEN! We had a bunch of family in town so we figured to come back because their food is really really delicious . We brought my 92 year old grandma and 9 other family members. We walk in and they LOST OUR RESERVATION again? For the 2nd time!!!!! I mean this is just he most annoying thing ever! My grandma is in her walker so this was like the worst thing to happen at a restaurant. The food is incredible which is why this is just so unfortunate. I hate writing bad reviews but this just is soooo not right."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good- The chili Relleno in particular. They have a large menu and offer a good selection of drinks as well.   They have one major problem here, the flies! If you sit outside, it is almost unbearable due to the abundant amount of flies. I have come for happy hour a few time and they only do happy hour at the bar outside, so you are forced to sit in a swarm of flies.   The service here is also not very good and the servers are pretty inattentive.   I probably will pass next time I am invited to eat here, as I do not like flies all around me at anytime, in particular when I eat!   I went to another resturant in Phoenix that introduced a type of bee that does not sting people but it eats flies! Richardson's should look into this."}
{"text":"How this place has less than 4 starts is beyond me.  This is the best New Mexican food you can find outside of NM and one of the best restaurants in all of phoenix. The food is incredible (get the carne adovada or the chile rellenos) and the bar selection is great.  Service is good and atmosphere is great.  Fantastic place."}
{"text":"Food is alright. Service is garbage. You would expect a lot more from a place with the kind of prices they have. If anything, the food is what gave it the 2 stars..."}
{"text":"THIS IS THE BEST PLACE FOR BREAKFAST!  We had been going to dicks for awhile now and one day we walked in and they said that it was full that morning,  and the waitress told us that Richardson's was up the road.  We never knew this was there.    We usually order the french toast which is AMAZING both Dicks and Richardson's serve the same breakfast.    Service is great and the coffee is even better!"}
{"text":"I would give it zero starts if I could.  I would never eat in a restaurant that proudly states (in super small letters on their menu) that if you order it, you pay for it.  Really?  If they posted a sign in an obvious place that said that, I would have never walked in.  We had a group of 7, and an a waiter that seemed new and had no clue about the menu items.  We asked for something that wasn't spicy.  Four of the 7 of us sent back our cheese enchiladas, because they were inedible, and crazy spicy.  An arrogant guy, who called himself the manager, never came over to talk to us, until we went looking for him.  They refused to bring us something else without charging us again, he claimed he was standing by his small letters on the paper menu, and it was our problem.  Customer service at its absolute worst.  Everyone has an off night, but I would never return after that experience."}
{"text":"The atmosphere in this establishment is amazing. Love the cozy, romantic, dark feeling of the restaurant and the patio. Our plan on this chilly night was to sit on the patio and order from either Richardsons or Rokery, as we had several months prior. Apparently that is no longer an option, so we decided to go to Richardsons. When we entered, we inquired about happy hour, which is only at the bar, so we chose to sit at a booth, instead, and skip happy hour. We ordered a round of margaritas and our entrees. The food was good, but, for some reason, was not kind to my stomach later. The service was so-so. I agree the waitstaff acts like they are way too busy to be bothered with doing their job. Our waitress was standoff-ish and absent. We had to ask one of the other workers for drinks and extras, like napkins, etc. The place was not busy, so I am not sure what happened to our server. We may return for a romantic cocktail or to bring guests for a drink, but that will be the extent of our return."}
{"text":"My family and I have been patrons of Richardson's & the Rokerij for over 10 years. The service has always been so so, with condescending waiters, etc. but the food usually made up for the bad service. I mean we even returned several times after my sister found a rubber band in her pasta Heidi and still had to pay for the dish. However, our past few experiences have been sub-par. Service is worse than ever and the food does not make up for it anymore. It is either too spicy or severely overcooked and dry. It will be a while before we return!!"}
{"text":"This review is super delayed, but I could not just forget to give this place the great recognition they deserve.  I recently moved to Oregon after living in AZ my entire life. I made my first trip back home to AZ to see my mom and sisters.The girls went out for a day filled with food, laughter, and love. We saved the BEST for last. RICHARDSON'S!!!!!!!  Between the 4 of us, we ordered some of the best items on the menu. Carne Adobada, Enchiladas, Mexican Chicken Cordon Blue, and ooooooohhhhh the Chili Relleno!!!!! Richardson's has the most impressive chili rellenos I have ever experienced. And I have experienced some freaking Rellenos!  I would not expect to find Mexican food this good out of a some what up scale restaurant in what my sister would call Cen Pho (FYI, I would NEVER call it that).  Great job Richardson's!!!!!"}
{"text":"We had our best meal during our recent Scottsdale visit at Richardson's. My wife had the fish trio and I had the New Mexican surf and turf. So much of such amazing food."}
{"text":"One hour. That is how long we waited after ordering before we decided we would rather eat anywhere that wasn't here. A crushing, impressively underwhelming experience in lack of service.  We arrived and found:  Free valet parking? With a teensy parking lot, this works, thank you.   A good selection of indoor and outdoor seating? Also a plus.   Setting expectations and/or taking care of waiting customers? EPIC FAIL.  On a beautiful AZ autumn morning we came here (tho we entered Rockerij). We asked to be re-seated outside because inside of Rockerij is dark as a tomb and had loud conversation-intruding music. We were reseated by the fireplace and a waiter came over shortly to take our order. So far so good...or so we thought. 30 Mins after placing our order, I ask another waiter to check on the status of our food and he cleverly asks about what we ordered (exactly)...so we think it is being taken care of. 40 MINS after placing our order, I have still only had my coffee refilled once...and had to flag down another waiter to inquire about the status of our food again, because our actual waiter is nowhere to be found and the previous \"drive-by\" waiter never returned. A few mins beyond that, this guy actually comes back and indicates that our order is nearly ready and should only be a few minutes longer. Shortly thereafter OUR waiter stops by with comments of:   \"I don't know why it's taking so long...\" and \"I put the ticket in right after I took your order...\"  So...as a waiter...maybe it might be part of your job to check on the status of an order say...15mins after bringing it by the kitchen? Perchance? What do you think?  FIFTEEN (15 == few?) minutes later, we still had no food and I'd had quite enough. Out the door we went.  On a comical note: As we were outside (another 5 minute wait because the valet had our car either parked in Egypt somewhere or tandem?) our waiter came out to find us to let us know that our food was ready if we'd like to come back inside?  Oh R E A L L Y? The Clue-Delivery Train will be visiting you shortly. Facial cues you may want to look for in the future are: 1) the furrowed eyebrows 2) fuck-you facial expression and 3) curling fists  It seems that we are not alone in this. Courtney W.'s review (10/14/12) is representative of what we experienced.  I am dumbfounded how they have any good reviews. There must be a serious drought of sit down restaurants in this part of town, because this crap would never fly where I live. I cannot tell you how much I am looking forward to NEVER COMING HERE AGAIN.  P.S. They own 3 restaurants apparently: Richardson's, Rokerij, and Dick's Hideaway...all right in the same area (Rokerij and Richardson's being attached).   P.P.S. They all serve the same menu. It is NOT amazing. I have previously been to Dick's. Yes, it is good. No my socks did not come flying off.  P.P.P.S. ProTip: Drive down to Central Phoenix and go to Durant's, Portland's, Switch, or Fez. All of these places have exemplary service and food to match."}
{"text":"Wait was a bit but so worth it! Sat in the patio is was a nice night and the dim lighting made everything so relaxing.  I ordered the Chimayo chicken it was spicy but wonderful I couldn't stop eating it! My husband ordered the pork chop chorizo only expecting one pork chop but the plate came with two! He was pleasantly surprised. For the first time ever he took home leftovers!"}
{"text":"Loved everything tonight, and always do when I come to Richardsons. Loved the chips, guacamole, salsas, and the chile rellenos. My friends loved the spicy chicken tostadas and the steak and shrimp plate. Just the right amount of spice in the food and in the waiter."}
{"text":"I first went to Richardson's 15 years ago when in Phoenix on business, and after that first fantastic meal, went there multiple times over the next few years.   Fast forward to this past Saturday night when I took my family there. I'd heard mixed reviews but wanted to see for myself if they could still pull off the kind of meal I remembered. I was not disappointed!  I had the sea bass in an orange salsa that was prepared perfectly, along with their famous green chili potato. The other three in my party had fish - the fish trio, the salmon and the swordfish. All were cooked to perfection.  Add an appetizer of chips with fresh guacamole, pico, and two green sauces, one to set your hair on fire and you have the total package. Finally topped it off with the house made flan - absolutely delicious.   Richardson's definitely passed the test of time. I'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"How can a place with such great food have such terrible service....consistently terrible.  We went here for brunch and three of us got some variation of the carne adovada (there are multiple preparations available.); the other guest ordered the green chili stew.    All four meals were divine.  However, the service, the service, the service is still an issue.   We sat at the bar, and she didn't seem that busy.   Yet, she was too busy to take our orders....pretty much through the almost two hours we were there.   And I am almost positive I have never seen a manager on duty.  I am improving my rating from a 2 to a 3 because no one spilled anything on us and then pretended it didn't matter."}
{"text":"I organized a corporate dinner event for 50 employees. I had not been to Richardson's before, but had heard great reviews and was excited to host our event at this special space. I walked into the restaurant and was greeted with rude service from the start. A waitress actually yelled out behind me \"MOVE!\" It appears that the staff was overwhelmed and acted as though they did not know the specifics of our reservation, which we had gone over with the events person in detail weeks prior. After speaking with the manager, the service did improve and I have to say the food was fantastic. It is a beautiful, special space and they serve amazing food, but the service was not good."}
{"text":"Went to Richardson's with 2 other couples to specifically get authentic New Mexico Mexican cuisine. Since one couple are natives of Santa Fe we knew what we were after. Hatch green chili and chimayo red chili sauce. The food delivered, highly recommend the Carne Adovada which was amazing.  If the service would have been good I easily would have rated the restaurant a 4 or 5. Slow service and the waitress acted like we were a major inconvenience. We arrived at 9pm which for us is not an untypical dining hour so I'm not giving them a pass based on the time. We get great service at many other local places at this time."}
{"text":"The blackened swordfish was absolutely fantastic!  Great service and attention from the professional staff. I'd definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I had really shitty service here, and the food was mediocre. I'm from New Mexico and was looking forward to some homestyle cuisine."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with a large group. Everything was so delicious, I can't even choose. The appetizers were filling, so I barely was able to dig into the entree. I ordered the New Mexico Enchiladas. They were fabulous!!! I would come here again, for sure."}
{"text":"I can't believe I've never written a review of Richardson's.  How many times have I been in here?  Like, a million?  A billion?  A quadrillion?  Ok so it must be a smaller number, but enough to have gained a few lbs from their always delicious and always ample grub.     This also happens to be my (now) 19 y/o daughter's favorite restaurant in Phoenix and this is probably the 3rd year in a row we've had a birthday meal here.  This time since it was a workday, the girls came up and met me for lunch, which gave us the opportunity to enjoy items off the brunch menu (served till 4pm daily!).  We started with the (chorizo) Con Queso, which was amazeballs.      I had the Carne Adovada Benedict, which was one of the best bennies I've ever had, with pork that was super tender and flavorful soaked in their jalapeno hollandaise and, true to form, totally massive.  Two others had varying enchilada dishes, which they raved about, and another had the Huevos Rancheros, which she raved about as well.    Oldest daughter had a Prickly Pear Margarita which made her eyes go wide with enjoyment when she first tasted.  Winning!    Finally, our server brought our 19 y/o a trio of birthday mini-desserts - a cheesecake-in-a-pot (consistency of a pot de crème with the flavor of a cheesecake), a dense flourless chocolate cake and a crème brûlée.  The brûlée was her favorite.    We had good service and a good time!  Thanks again Richardson's!"}
{"text":"The chile rellenos are delicious! I ordered the pork and smoked turkey. I wish the smoked turkey had been pulled apart more but this is a minimal issue. The green chile was the perfect sauce too."}
{"text":"This place was highly recommend by several people so I had to check it out.   My first impression was that the restaurant was way too dark inside. I had to use my phone flashlight to actually read the menu. I suggest sitting on the porch if at all possible. You'll be able to see better.   I ordered the New Mexico enchiladas and they were fantastic. I got a beef, pork, and chicken. I have to say out of the 3 the chicken was the best. Accompanied with the prickly pear margarita this meal was phenomenal.   If you enjoy spicy food ask for their spicy salsa. Great addition to the meal."}
{"text":"Took the wife to Richardsons for our fifth year anniversary splendid time in a little booth with great food and yummy bloody Mary's."}
{"text":"Went in on a Sunday night, great looking place and the service was on point. It was a little slow and the bartender chatted with us pretty much the entire time. What was suppose to be dinner and drinks, turned into an all nighter. The food was great, I had the enchilada plate and it was just packed with flavor. I haven't been I awhile but I may return soon and try something else, considering I live in the area there are just so many options that I still want to try around me."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food!  The blackened scallops (yes done mexicany) AWESOME!  Served with rice and beans in a skillet over a tortilla.  Heaven with a kick. Had the pumpkin cheesecake served in a tortilla shell.  This place is nice-great patio also."}
{"text":"Hi guy's just a BIG SHOUT OUT to all you guy's at Richardson's , Rokerij  and Dick's down the street all of you mix up lot's of great eat's  and drinks a Special shout out for the bartenders they ROCK  ,,,I recommend all of them ;  )"}
{"text":"Awesome food, awesome service and an even more awesome patio!(three awesome's).   It's going to be 108 today but you wouldn't know it on the patio, Mattie took awesome care of us (and everyone else at the bar) and breakfast enchiladas and Mimosas can make anyone happy!  Skip the chains, skip the \"new\" places and go to one of the best brunch places in town!"}
{"text":"Good food, awesome ambiance and the patio is beautiful!! Will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"I have wanted to write this review since our dinner at Richardson's.  Procrastination being the culprit.  I had read some iffy reviews of the new place, but we loved the old place too much not to give it a try.  Walking in to the restaurant was a bit of a shock.  I couldn't believe it was the exact same!!  That was a little weird, but in that the restaurant LOOKED the same, the food TASTED the same if not better!  Sea bass was perfect in every way! I had the chili rellenos which I love.  The sevice was wonderful! I believe his name was John.  I hope that is correct, because the reviews about service have been spotty at best, and he deserves a great review.  We will, definately, return to Richardson's, but not soon enough for me.  Glad to have it back!"}
{"text":"Although expectation is the leading cause of disappointment, I'm here to set some expectations. As far as I'm concerned the individuals who rated this place \"average\" are some average joe's themselves. The ribs appetizer from this place was so tender and seasoned it was as if the me and the animal had shared a previous bond. This is the only place I've been to that the guacamole could be an actual dish in and of itself. The Chimayo Chicken(add Jalepeno hallandaise, you're welcome) was my entree of choice, and as you can tell from everything I've previously written it was knock your socks off and wash them for you; good. If they served the five stars I gave them, I would slap some jalapeño hollandaise on there and call it a meal.  Everything had just the right amount of spice to leave even the saltiest of critique's satisfied."}
{"text":"This is going to be in a weird order, so sorry.  First I want to say that this is a beautiful restaurant. In fact it is one of the most beautiful restaurants I can remember going to in the recent past. The neighborhood and the very exterior are Meh, but as soon as you walk through the gate, just gorgeous. Even though I can't recommend it, it seems like a great place to sit outside at during the nicer months. The inside is nicely decorated, dark and cozy. Place is fancyish.  If you like wine and drinking, and excellent food or great service isn't really high on your list of priorities for a dining establishment, I would recommend this place to bring a date. It's nice and dark, and if my experience is representative of their service, you'll have plenty of time to chat with your date uninterrupted.  Unfortunately for me, I don't have a lot of game, so I go ahead and eat at most restaurants I go to, since that is what they are there for. I want very badly to find a New Mexican restaurant I like on my side of town, and today this was the place.   I may have made a mistake by doing so, but I sat outside for a minute and read a few of the yelp reviews beforehand. What I was looking for was an idea of a great dish, what I found was a few too many mentions of poor service.   Some of the reviews mentioned condescension and patronizing responses, but I might have preferred that. I got a lack of attention as well as lack of friendliness/helpfulness. The onus should be on the server to get a dialogue going and get some rapport built. It would take minimal effort.   As far as the food, this place is a step above your normal family restaurant price-wise, so if they are justifying the prices on the food, I just could not see it. It was decent, but not \"OMG this is great New Mexican food!\" If you value your money and would be upset by wasting it, my advice would be to try it on your own before taking the financial bath of bringing your family.   There are plenty of decent Mexican places around far more reasonably priced, and this place just didn't justify the cost.   My search continues. I don't think I'll be back to Richardson's any time soon. Not worth it. Sad."}
{"text":"Some buddies and I recently had a great meal at Richardson's. Great atmosphere, great food. The wait staff was first-class and especially helpful. They're doing it right."}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service.  Had the skewers with some wine.  The food was flavorful and cooked nicely.  The setting in comfortable and clean with a nice ambiance.  An excellent choice for nice food, wine and a classy setting."}
{"text":"Fantastic New Mexico cuisine and ambiance. Especially lived the frint room' which is actually outdoors."}
{"text":"Richardson's is the best restaurant in Phoenix. They have delicious enchiladas, killer pico, succulent steaks and amazing prickly pear margaritas .  They open at 8am for breakfast so you can start your day with mimosas and end it with fine wine.  Been going to Richardson's , Dicks and Rockerij for over twenty years at least twice a week and, if company is in town, they want to go every day.  Staff is crazy good , they have a great patio for my dog , and they never fail to deliver excellence.  You want see much advertising for this restaurant group; they don't have to:  the locals show up every day.  Get there early or you won't  find a seat.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Many people are recommending the Chimayo chicken & I agree it was delicious! I am from New Mexico so it is a little different but feels like home"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to eating at Richardsons but was unfortunately let down. My wife and I ordered 3 dishes and only one was worth eating.  The ceviche comes in a bowl of salsa with little fish. The garlic plate was okay but nothing to write home about.  Our final dish was the carne adobada. I loved this dish but it was a little too spicy for my wife.  The service was great however our first round of drinks tasted watered down and at $13 per drink, I would like it to taste like it contained alcohol."}
{"text":"To add to what many other Yelpers said: you really can't tell what is Richardson's and what is Rokerij; the free valet is very convenient, especially considering there is basically no lot; it is extremely dark inside, so don't plan on enjoying the appearance of your food; and MAKE A RESERVATION if you want to eat in Richardson's.  That being said, we had very good service - not super attentive, but I much prefer when servers don't spend a lot of time hovering.  All our meals were correct and everything was prompt but not rushed.  We went on a Tuesday, which happens to be half price bottles of wine night, so that was a great surprise.  I ordered the Posole to start.  It was VERY spicy but delicious.  We also had the chips and guacomole, with the 3 different salsas, and that was wonderful to start.  My husband ordered the enchilada platter and his father ordered the New Mexico platter.  They both loved their food, although it was alsy very spicy (the particular green chiles in their sauce were very spicy at least).    My mother-in-law had the skewers and it was fine.  I had the Pasta Heidi: green chili pasta with chicken and a chipotle cream sauce.  I literally could have died right then and been satisfied.  It was SO.  GOOD.  We literally can't wait to go back just so we can have the Pasta Heidi again.  My mouth is watering.  YUM.    I would also recommend checking out the basement bar, just to have a drink.  Have your server or a hostess show you how to get down there.  It's pretty cool, and a nice place to spend some time while you wait for your table."}
{"text":"Eggs Benedict Jalapeño is one of the top 5 breakfasts in town. Today the weather is awesome so the patio is perfect."}
{"text":"The location was nice...I had a hard time finding something I would like. And after I got home I got sick-food poisoning."}
{"text":"Not that impressed at all.  The food and drinks were way over priced and the service inside was so bad.  We had to ask for water 3x, food took forever to get and it just seemed like our group of 7 was an inconvenience.  We got there early and had drinks outside, which was lovely, but we were told all the tables outside were reserved so we only had a short time to sit and enjoy until we had to move.  I would have rather gone across the street to the City Grill."}
{"text":"Oh Richardson's...you never cease to impress  me. I was there tonight for my mother's birthday with my brother, sister in law, niece & nephew & surprisingly enough, it was pretty dead. This was the first time I've been to the new location (hadn't been to the previous location in at least a year) and even though some lady came in & said \"OH it's so different but so similar\"..(doesn't make a whole lot of sense)...it looks pretty much identical to the previous location...cozy seating & all..pretty sure there's extra seating on the side as well.   The hostess was nice & sat us as soon as our full party was there. We started off with the chips & guac which was pretty fantastic (spicy as well but I love a good kick to my food) & the pinot noir which is fabulous...best pinot I've had in a while.   We then proceed to split the blackened salmon with pineapple salsa (my mother & I) with the mixed veggies & potato stuffed green chile & two side salads....two side salads were definitely not required...they're huge as are the portions typically served at Richardson's. It was delicious.  I'm not sure where previous Yelpers have noted they only have one dessert as we had not only the flan but the sopapillas as well which were prepared perfectly...not too doughy, not too tough. Absolutely great end to the meal.   Overall, great experience. The server was extremely patient with us as we requested things frequently & was laid back while being attentive at the same time.   If ya haven't been, go. It's a great atmosphere for a date & I can't wait to go back once the weather's cooled off to enjoy the patio."}
{"text":"Went to Richardson's this morning for brunch with friends.  Sat on the patio, that was nice.  We ordered the drink specials, $5 mimosas and $5 bloody Mary's. I enjoyed my Mimosa a great deal.  For brunch, I ordered the Crab Cakes Benedict that I thought was rich and delicious.  Would have loved a piece or two of fruit to help cut the richness but it's a minor complaint.  I would definitely order this again and return for Brunch.  My partner had the Adovado Benedict and that was also delicious.  The service was pleasant.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My review is of the service, not of the food. I live very close to there, and the service staff has never seemed like they care about their jobs. I'm glad I go for the flavor of the food, and not to be catered to, but it kind of ruins the atmosphere of a BEAUTIFUL restaurant if the servers don't care about their patrons."}
{"text":"This is NOT a review about the restaurant!!!  This is an internet complaint about one of the servers, Jr.  He's incredibly rude!  He wasn't personable one bit and came off as snappy.  He was demeaning every time he spoke.  This is our absolute FAVORITE place to eat and I can't believe that my experience didn't meet my expectations ONLY because of this server.   Obviously I will continue to return because the food is amazing, but I hope I won't be seeing such rude employees at the best restaurant in Phoenix."}
{"text":"OH, RICHARDSONS!!!  You broke my heart!  After 2 wonderful, memorable \"home-run\"  experiences in the past, I bring my family to share good times and brag on you...and YOU LET ME DOWN...BADLY!!    Before arriving in Phoenix this weekend,   I learned though that the old Richardsons burned down but another \"sister\" restaurant \"Rokerij\" was serving the Richardsons menu.  I thought that's cool!  I am sorry to say that this time, it was a MAJOR FUMBLE.  I don't think a restaurant has ever disappointed me like Richardsons or Rokerij (or whatever they call themselves\".    I ordered one of their blackboard special entrees of the day:  Sea bass encrusted in pine-nuts.  The waitress told me I could have either mashed potatoe baked in a half of a jalapeno, or I could have plain mash potatoes.  I chose the plain mash potatoes since I cannot eat jalapeno.  My husband (who is trying to go vegan) ordered the calamari entree salad.    My son ordered the pastole soup and a BBQ chicken pizza.  Past 2 experiences at Richardsons:  we were always served chips and salsa when we sat down.   This time:  no chips and salsa.   So, we ordered some.  we didn't get it for 15 to 20 minutes.  (And they charged us.)  My son was served his Pastole soup at the same time as the pizza, not ahead of the pizza.  That was odd.  Then when he started eating the pizza, it was not the pizza he ordered.  It was a plain feta cheese pizza, not BBQ chicken.  My husband's salad tasted bitter...my husband said he thought the lettuce did not taste fresh.    As for MY entree, it was served about 10 minutes AFTER my family received their food.  AWKWARD!!  My son and husband didn't feel comfortable eating their dinner when I sat there with nothing (except chips).  When my entree finally arrived, it had the wrong potato...the one I didn't order...the one with the jalapeno green pepper...not the plain mashed potato.  Also, the pine-nut encrusted sea bass didn't look like it had any pine-nuts.  I wouldn't have ever guessed that there was a shred of pine nut associated with that fish.  So, I inquired and was told that just because it said it was encrusted with pine nuts doesn't mean that it would be covered with pine-nuts...it was supposed to be a \"dusting\".    It was clear by this time,. we were having major problems with our dining experience.  I thought, this can't be the same Richardsons I remembered from the past.    The waitress was \"busy\" and my husband went in search of the manager at the front of the restaurant.  He was in the middle of explaining the problem to the manager when the phone rang...the manager told my husband he had to take the call and my husband was just left standing there.   (Oh, really??  You interrupt a customer standing in front of you telling you about a service issue to take a phone call?)  My husband is a good sport and he waited and then continued to expalin the problem.    Some minutes later, the manager appeared at our table with the plain mashed potatoes.  As he served me the potatoes, he blurted out that \"I wasn't really supposed to get a choice of potato in the first place, since I was ordering off the Richardsons menu\".  (Recall the waitress gave me the option...I didn't ask for the option.  I didn't know what menu I was ordering off of...how am I supposed to know?) Is the manager actually telling  the customer that she shouldn't have gotten what they offered.  (OH REALLY??)  My husband explained then that the waitress had offered it.  Reply:  \"She wasn't supposed to.\"  (OH, DEAR! WHAT'S A CUSTOMER SUPPOSED TO DO!)    So, in summary:  most of what COULD  have gone wrong at Richardsons DID: 1)  Chips and salsa (I guess not offered to patrons complimentary anymore).   We requested them and were charged the $5...alright, I can pay for the chips.  It's just odd they don't offfer this anymore.  AND why did it take 20 minutes to get chips and salsa?? 2)  My husband's salad did not taste fresh.  Poor guy...he had his hands full trying to voice his concern to the manager about my meal and my son's and his wasn't right either! 3)  My son's pizza:  they served him the wrong one.  Shouldn't the waitress be checking the order for accuracy before serving it?? 4) My son's soup wasn't served before the pizza.  So he has pizza and soup served at the same time.  Maybe the waitress could have asked if he wanted the soup before or with the pizza.  We thought it would come before.  (ASSUME NOTHING AT THIS PLACE!) 5)  My mashed potato:  offered an option, served the option I didn't pick, then told by the manager that i shouldn't have had the option in the first place.  (JEESH!)   By the way, the table next to us also had terrible service.  We overheard the waitress ask the patrons when they were asking for their check, \"Did you ever get the beer you ordered?\"  (DOESN'T SHE EVEN KNOW??)    As stated before, I have experienced much better at Richardsons previously.  They should be embarrassed!!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing Sunday breakfast w/fam and this is all due to our amazing  server Rick! Thanks Rick!!! Food, drinks, experience."}
{"text":"The food is nothing short of spectacular! Must try the carne adovada! Go hungry. Portions are enormous. Adam is a wonderful bartender and always takes good care of us when we come in."}
{"text":"Hotel California dining.  This restaurant is a unique gem with great food."}
{"text":"Breakfast Nirvana.  One of the best places for New Mexican style breakfasts. If you like pork with your eggs this is the place. Carne Adovada Benedict a real treat. Great interior and friendly knowledgable staff."}
{"text":"Took the family there for my anniversary. This was a recommendation from a co worker. The parking is complimentary which is a good thing as it is coupled with another restaurant and they seem to be land locked. The restaurant has a cozy feel about it with a mixture of bar, booth, or patio seating. The Mrs. and I both had top shelf margaritas and we were not the least bit disappointed. We then moved to some of the best calimari I have ever had. On to the main course. Our top sirloin steak was cooked perfectly and had great flavor with the portables mushroom and seasonings. My wife got the Brussels sprouts with her steak. I hate Brussels sprouts with a passion, but WOW we're these good. I had the corn which was excellent. The green Chile potato was excellent. My son had the sea food pasta which he said was very good. The shrimp and scallops were nothing to laugh at, they were yuge! Desert was a chocolate cake served with chocolate sauce and raspberries and blue berries. Yummmy!   Well, that's was out 26th Anniversary, and I am glad we spent it in such a quality restaurant. Next time I'll have some fish or Mexican food. They have a nice variety but don't overwhelm you with to many choices. Price was adequate for the quality of food. But I'm the guy that will spend $100 on a steak, if it's a $100 steak. Highly recommend reservations!"}
{"text":"I had lunch here yesterday with friends and it was just OK.  I was disappointed because I love Mexican food, but can't eat hot spicy. It is recommended that you ask for a 'sample' before ordering a dish and I did so. The sauces had a lot of flavor, but were just too hot for me. I asked the waitress what she would recommend on the menu that was more suited to my taste buds. She said there was nothing but perhaps a pasta dish or hamburger. So, my friends got huge, beautiful, aromatic dishes of steaming food and I got a plain hamburger with skinny, cold fries. I was so disappointed. I'm not sure why restaurants only cater to clients who can add heat to their dishes with hotter sauces, but leave others wanting.  My friends loved their food and kept raving about them. So, if that is what you like, super, but don't invite your friends that you know can't enjoy it.   As if that wasn't bad enough, on the way out, we passed the patio area and there was a couple with their dog sitting next to the man in the booth, eating off the table!  This was NOT a service dog, it was a spoiled pet and it was disgusting to watch. I personally don't want to sit on a cushion where a dog has been licking tidbits off the seat and I certainly don't want to see a dog eating off a plate on the table. People are abusing their privileges of being allowed to take their pets onto the patio. I'm wondering what the health department would have to say if they witnessed such a thing. Yes, I complained and the employee placated me by saying he 'understood' and that things were 'sterilized' after dogs leave, but he didn't do anything about asking the people to put their dog on the floor!   There are tens of thousands of wonderful restaurants in Phoenix competing for my business. I don't think Richardson's will be on my list again anytime in the future."}
{"text":"Food was delicious as expected but the atmosphere at dick's is more my style. If you like New Mexico hatch chill cuisine, you can't go wrong with Richardson's. Big portions and always piping hot out of the kitchen."}
{"text":"Went for brunch yesterday and ordered the CARNE ADOVADA BENEDICT(twopoachedeggsonEnglishmuffinswithcarneadovada,jalapeno hollandaise, beans & your choice of potatoes or hash browns)And it was Delicious!!!!!! My friend and I also had 2 very good mimosas- I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We LOVE this place. Food is consistently on point. The staff is super friendly and they make a mean jalapeño margarita. Keep up the good work Richardson's!"}
{"text":"The Carne adovada never fails in its deliciousness.  Richardsons is a definite \"go to\" place when we are in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I was suggested this place by a friend who recently had a date there. I made reservations for a Friday night and was very excited since she highly recommended it. I was happy to find that there was valet service considering parking was limited. We were not sat right away but I wasn't too worried about it. Our service was great. The server was not overwhelming and very informative. I am a steak guru and decided to order the surf and turf dish with steak. I ordered it rare and it was prepared perfectly. I was AMAZED on the quality of beef that was used. I'm very apprehensive to places that serve steak considering its basic USDA choice, not prime. However, I was pleasantly surprised and pleased. I love this place and have no been back, but plan to go back soon!  I also REALLY liked the wood burning smell in the restaurant. Was definitely a welcoming smell."}
{"text":"Lovely dinner.  The staff is cordial, the ambiance is warm, the smell coming out of the exhaust fans outside is heavenly.  I came on a night when I wasn't feeling well and still forced myself to eat.  Wasn't a fan of the bar element as I'm more into intimate, quiet dining, but would still gladly come back.  Good New Mexican isn't that easy to find outside of NM."}
{"text":"Deliciousness - 3.5/5 Happiness - 2.5/5  Richardson's is fine, but I don't think it is worth the price. The building itself is very unique and I have always enjoyed my time most when sitting in the outside lobby during happy hour. The restaurant itself is very cramped and very dim. You can hear every conversation and there simply is a lack of space. Water pitchers were constantly placed on the booth where my wife was sitting, meaning she kept looking over her shoulder to make sure they weren't dropped on her head. In my experiences, the servers never seem too engaged either. You get a bottle of water to fill yourself and rarely ever see the waiter post-order. On my recent trip, we got the wrong tab handed to us and it took us about 15 minutes to flag down the waiter to redress the issue.  The menu is relatively limited but full of unique offerings. My favorite is the pasta heidi - green chili linguine in a chipotle sauce. Very delicious. Their double baked green chili potato is also unique to Richardson's and quite delicious. I have also enjoyed their steak and fish offerings. But there are also plenty of just fine, nothing special options. That includes the Santa fe Chicken and their pizzas.   My biggest complaint is though the food is good, it simply isn't worth the price (mid $20s to mid $40s). A lot of the appetizers are the same price as the entrees, and I simply don't think the food justifies the prices.  It's a fun location, and the food is good. I simply have never felt compelled to make this a top option when I go out to eat."}
{"text":"We were here years ago (actually Dicks Hideway) and loved the tamales so dropped in when we drove by. We had our kid with us and didn't think that would be an issue, but felt the cold shoulder when we walked in. We felt unwelcome, and the hostess seemed to have an attitude. No one smiled, once. At all. When we were taken to the table, the hostess just stared at the server and we stood there uncomfortably in silence for an oddly long period of time. We weren't offered the specials and had to ask about tamales, which were a special.  We were talking about how we felt like our presence was an inconvenience and I think someone overheard, because then the waitress started being nicer. The food wasn't as good as we remembered and the experience was miserable and we won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Small bathrooms  Small TVs  No food happy hour?!!"}
{"text":"Richardson's was recommended to us for brunch while we were visiting Arizona for Spring Training. I'll state right now that I have a thing against restaurants that pretend to be something that they are not. Richardson's came off as very pretentious. I do not understand why they have valet parking when there is plenty of parking to go around. On top of that, the host actually asked us if we had a reservation when there were plenty of open tables and when we replied that we didn't, the host made it seem like he was doing us a favor by giving us a table. It would have been better had the service improved as our meal progressed but it actually got worse. It took forever to get our food. In fact, it took so long that the server apologized multiple times and offered my husband a free iced tea.   We ordered the Huevos Rancheros (three eggs, blue corn tortillas, red or green chile & cheese, potatoes or hash browns, beans & a tortilla) and the Carne Adovada & Eggs ( three eggs, smoked pork simmered in red chile, potatoes or hash browns, beans & a tortilla). Apparently their main seller is the Adovada. I did not care for it at all because it was smoked too heavily. But this is just a personal preference. My husband liked it and loved the generous portion size. He could barely get through it actually which was surprising since he's a pretty big eater. I liked my Huevos Rancheros for the most part but it was just so expensive for what it was. I added some ham to go with my eggs but the dish just felt way to heavy for me and I didn't enjoy it enough to finish it. With that said, I definitely preferred the green chile sauce over the red so please order the green sauce if you get the chance. Oh and Richardson's? Stop skimping people on the tortillas. For the amount of food that was served, you can definitely serve more than one tortilla.   I'm not sure that I can recommend Richardson's. I mean it wasn't bad in any shape or form but it also wasn't anything that justified the price we paid for brunch. It was just too expensive even though I'm sure everything is high quality and such. And that valet. Unnecessary. Plus, living in California means that I'm exposed to some fantastic Mexican cuisine and Richardson's did not blow my mind. A pass for me! 3/5"}
{"text":"Amazingly good food. Great cocktails. Ate dinner and brunch here. Rachel was our brunch bartender, really attentive, very charming. Great bartender. I will miss this place. Highly recommended. Real deal cuisine."}
{"text":"I go to Richardson's on every visit to Phoenix just for their Huevos Rancheros. It never disappoints!!  On my last visit, my cousin ordered Eggs Benedict Jalapeño with a jalapeño hollandaise that was wonderfully flavorful without the heat. I loved it so much that I put some of her hollandaise on my food!  I've only eaten breakfast here, but I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, the drastically mixed reviews are are accurate- although unless the really good ones are purely nostalgic, I'm not sure where they are coming from.  I hadn't been t Richardson's since they'd rebuilt...remember when this spot was Timothy's??  Now, that...I miss!  Anyhow, our dinner for 8 went from bad- a bartender who had very good wine knowledge but then just poured my drink into a new glass after I discovered a crack in it and gave us serious attitude when questioned about the need to remake the drink....to worse- spoiled seafood with major ammonia smell.  2 stars- one for the Manager who when we finally complained took care of us properly and one for the cozy patio.  Just not sure if I can bring myself to give them another try... Sad."}
{"text":"I returned with a group but didn't tell them about my prior review.  Here's my second experience...better than last time but still a food timing issues.  The better part.  I ordered the egg breakfast.  Everything on the plate was great and there was so much I took left overs home which were good reheated later.  The star was the bacon.  The best bacon I've ever eaten in my life.  The valet parkers were speedy and organized.  It's an amazing place to people watch.  Here's the area they still struggle with - speed from food order to table. So the key is just enjoy another beverage and cherish the extra conversation time."}
{"text":"The flavor and amount of food is unparalleled to any Mexican food place out there. I guess that's it... it's not just Mexican, it's NEW Mexican cuisine; It's wonderful! Great atmosphere and they have drink and appetizer specials after 9pm. I've visited about 5 to 7 times ( mostly dinner, a few late nights, and once for brunch) and each time, the food is outstanding. Some dishes are spicy. It can be pricey but it's so worth it, plus the portions are huge. You will not be disappointed,  there's a reason people drive from all over the valley to come here. Now, EAT!"}
{"text":"WARNING, do not sit on the patio. During this wonderful weather, you may be tempted to bask in the outdoors while you leisurely indulge in a mimosa or bloody mary. This restaurant is not the place to do so. For two weekends in a row I have sat on the patio only to be sorely neglected. I waited for 20 minutes to get a drink each time I sat down. This was because I discovered that the bartender outside is also the waitress for the entire patio. She is heavily bogged down and cannot accommodate patrons sitting at the tables. There were 5 of us, all four adults got their meal and were done eating when the 5th persons food finally arrived. I have no complaints about the food, but I also have no desire to give money to a place that has great food but crappy service."}
{"text":"Had the Carne Adovada and was more than impressed!  Going back for some of the pricier dishes because they sound fantatsic."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, friendly service, but the food was just okay for me-- some dishes were definitely better than others. I ordered the sriracha chicken and my bf ordered the porckhop. I didnt think the chicken was very good at all, i much preferred his pork chop-- the flavors and texture had way more depth. On the bright side, drinks were strong and the waitress came around a lot."}
{"text":"The food was wonderful, but the service at the bar was TERRIBLE. I MEAN THE WORST EVER. The bartender got my first drink and never came back to ask if I wanted another one. Then he looked and saw me with my card in my hand and ignored me. It took 10 minutes for him to bring me my check I felt like I had been taken hostage. The food was great but I'd never come back due to the poor service."}
{"text":"Fantastic. Had a table of 12 on the patio and it was a beautiful experience. Food was delicious and fresh. Very authentic. Service was perfect. Could not have been better. The ambience of this place including the Rookery was all we could have hoped for a casual yet elegant evening. A must go-to place when in Phoenix. It is a special place."}
{"text":"Came here to find out if this place knows how to make authentic New Mexican food. I grew up eating Carne adovoda and green chile stew. I was feeling home sick and this place definitely hit the spot. The stew was wonderful and the Carne adovoda was pretty good. Turns out they know what they are doing when it comes to New Mexican food. Some of the items on the menu are New Mexican food with a twist, I can't wait to find out how everything else tastes."}
{"text":"Tell me why you dont have high-chairs! Had a reservation here this evening. My husband said three and a toddler. Showed up, my 17 month old started crawling on the table- had to leave, unfortunately. The menu looks phenomenal, the vibe was poppin for  a sunday night, so sad we had to miss out. Until next time- highchairs please!!"}
{"text":"Where do I start. Made a reservation for my wife's birthday and took my family. We told them we had 6 adults plus a baby. When we arrived a young man led us out to the patio and showed us to our seats. The atmosphere was nice but the table was so low it would have been hard to eat so we asked for another location. They had another outdoor table that was normal height and would work for our party.  They said they had a reservation for that already. Why not place the people that weren't there yet at the lower tables. They took us inside and sat us in a corner booth. The noise level was loud. We waited for the rest of my kids got there and we waited and waited for drinks. We then waited quite awhile for our food. Longer than is the normal time to expect. Even though we mentioned we had an infant they had no booster seats or high chairs.  Not even one. Our waiter said it has been mentioned before but no change. The booth sat in the corner and it was overly hot. As we were finishing our dinner and about to pay the air conditioner was turned on. So over all the service was mediocre. The food was hit and miss from dish to dish as some were good and some were not so. After paying the almost 300 dollar bill we oft and decided we wouldn't be back. Richardsons needs to listen more to their clientele on ways to make things better for all their customers. I DONT recommend this resturant for a lot of reasons."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely terrible. If your waitress's name is Misty I suggest you ask to be reseated. She's rude, demeaning, and VERY inexperienced. It'll take you 30 minutes just to grab her attention to place your order.  The food was nothing to die for, and you have to ask for refills. I really wish our experience was better as the reviews below suggest its a decent place, but we will not be back. For the money you spend here you can get a great meal with EXCELLENT service down the road. Usually if the food was not to par but service was good we return for a second try- as every kitchen has an off day. But Misty sealed the deal for us. Management needs to rethink that one."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I have been coming here for years. Now it's Tuesday tradition to come and drink and eat some amazing food. Tony and Eddie are epic. They never let my drink go dry and we have the best conversation. I have never eaten something here that I didn't love. I can't survive my crazy week without Richardson's!"}
{"text":"Wonderful eggs Benedict with jalapeño hollandaise, with green chicken enchiladas! Susana out server was very attentive and enthusiastic the entire time, such a great southwest brunch location in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I really liked the ambiance here. I went here for a business dinner and it was a nice, relaxed atmosphere. I'm always happy to find a spot that serves good mole, and this fits the bill. My boss was also raving about their Moscow mules. Nice work, Richardson's."}
{"text":"Make sure you come hungry, the portions are very large. Also make sure you can handle spice, as the chile packs a punch, much like you would find in New Mexico. The only drawback was that the service was a little slow. Still, it's authentic New Mexico-style food, and it's delicious too."}
{"text":"Wonderful what a treat , just found it on yelp after we flew in and boy were we blown away . My husband had the pork it was so well seasoned with out sauces , wow thank goodness he shared , my daughter and I both ordered the chicken which was wrapped around spinach and cheese also very good , we could not eat everything such big portions you might want to share . We were staying at a hotel without a refrigerator so we couldn't take left overs . This is the place I will send people to and come back to every time I am in town"}
{"text":"Let me get the negative out first, the lighting!  It makes me almost sick and takes a while to get used to, really dark purple colored lights, yuk!  The food is really good (try the garlic plate if your not on a 1st date).  Prices are a little high but not out of touch.  Would be a great place for a date.  Make reservations, it gets busy, hence service can be less than spectacular."}
{"text":"I was visiting Scottsdale on business and one of my colleagues suggested this place. We came here for dinner and the food was very good although a bit pricier in comparison to the portion size. A glass of wine can cost $15 and above.  We ordered the skewers for appz which were really very good - the flavours and char on the meat and veggies! My entree was the top sirloin which was great too!"}
{"text":"Absolutely one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix! Always have gracious servers and an amazing crowd. The best is the food, always consistent and always great tasting!!!"}
{"text":"This place is the go to place for me and my husband.  We go here for anniversaries.  We take out of towners here.  This is one of my favorite restaurants!!  I love this type of food.  I am from NM and the green chile's are right on!  The food here is down right amazing."}
{"text":"We loved Richardson's! Great date night restaurant. The food was fabulous and our server, Jason, was amazing! Best service we've gotten anywhere in awhile!"}
{"text":"Far fancier in style and atmosphere than I had expected from the menu or the, quite reasonable, prices.  There's a valet and everything, and it gets insanely crowded.  At 5 pm I was told there was only one table for 3 before 9 pm, and they don't take reservations for groups that small.  Fortunately we got served, and the food was entirely decent, but nothing to rave for.  I had a tamale plate, the main course of which was larger and less brick-like than most of the tamales I've actually had in New Mexico."}
{"text":"Portions were huge!  We ate it all though.  That must have meant the food was tasty.  My wife and I shared one dish, The New Mexican Platter.  We also enjoyed the prickly pear margarita."}
{"text":"Seriously overrated! We have been to Richardson's once before and had a pleasant experience. This time around was completely different and have to say will not ever be back. A 2 hour 10 minute disaster! First server warned us of the 16 min garlic platter which was fine, we were excited to try it. Didn't realize she also waited to put our order in until after we ate it. With 11 people on the patio (4 kiddos) at 108 degrees with misters they turned off on us after sitting down for 10 mins...it's a no brainier to grab the manager for an explanation. Well, that didn't happen because the mgr left for the Dicks last Resort location??? It is Friday night, is it not??? So the kitchen lost our ticket was the explanation and when the mgr showed his face he decided to give us a 12% discount on our evening. Sorry, not good enough! Too many other great choices in the area to go back again. Blahhhh!!!! Server was sweet...not her fault...just inadequate management!"}
{"text":"We like the food here because they always have a special seafood and meat menu. We did a trio fish with special request for grilled asparagus and cauliflower. The cauliflower did not look pretty but was really good, had a nice charred flavor."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.   How does a restaurant top rated on Zag ats and Thril list not get top billing on Yelp?  No idea! I was blown away by the quality, service, and atmosphere.   Authentic Southwestern cuisine at it's finest.  You won't regret coming here."}
{"text":"Great owner and staff. Waiter was wonderful took the time to explain 'the numerous' specials. He knocked it out of the  park and recommended the Carne Adovada (one of their classics). Smoked pork simmered in green chile.  It was delicious, the best Mexican I have had in a very long time. Oh, and they have great drinks too. I will be back!"}
{"text":"We have been going to Richardson's for years, even before the fire. We were looking forward to the reopening. Have been there several times since but last night's experience was horrible. Service was poor, wouldn't re-cork wine we bought, food marginal, seemed to be understaffed. Manager said they went through a \"major house cleaning a month ago and new staff are not all trained.\"  So we wasted $80 for 2 people to train their staff?  Manager offered apology and suggested we come back in a couple of months.  FAT CHANCE!!"}
{"text":"Place is bomb dot com Must visit when in Phoenix In my top five joints   Long before Yelp or the Travel Channel, my go to source for finding the best places to check out when travelling was a book called \"Eat Your Way Across the USA.\"  I think this was only one of two places in Arizona that the book featured.  Went to Richardson's for the first time in probably the late 90's or early 2000's and have been hooked ever since.  It is among my absolute most favorite restaurants.  A couple years back, the original location was destroyed by fire.  This was my first time in the new location which is right around the corner from the original spot.  The interior looks almost exactly like the old location.  They now have mandatory valet, though, which I am not crazy about.  In the past, I have gotten the huevos rancheros and the enchiladas.  Best I have ever had for both.  Today, I got the Trio which was Swordfish, Salmon and Mahi Mahi.  Came on a tortilla with asparagus and carrots.  Outstanding!  They have five dollar mimosas, bellinis, and bloody marys during brunch hours.  Had one mimosa and one bellini.  I wish I had just come to Richardson's straight from the airport when I arrived last Tuesday.  It is that freaking good!"}
{"text":"Dark lit, copper top bar (I think, it was dark), booze flowing and amazing comfort food makes this place a nice place for Tommy to go! Yeah, third person, so 1990's! Belly up here and get special happy hour prices on drinks and food! I usually stay clear of New Mexican food, but I have been here a couple times now and the flavors are amazing. Green chili, roasted peppers, garlic, smoked meats, fish, oysters, you name it, it's all amped up here. The heat of spice here isn't bad like most New Mexican food so don't be afraid and eliminate choices. Now I know some people aren't fans of the darker atmosphere here, but let your eyes acclimate and you'll see the warm inviting dinning room. Just be sure you don't drop your keys or wallet! JK. This place also has a great outdoor dinning and bar area in between the restaurants. Nice little patio to grab drinks and visit!"}
{"text":"Still a five - without a doubt!!  We went here with another couple who are good friends.  They had never been to Richardson's before and so we were a little uneasy about whether they would like it as much as we do.  We arrived at 5:20 without reservations because for some reason I thought they didn't take reservations for under eight which they indeed do.  They take reservations for 4 and over.  Anyway, they seated us immediately but explained that our table had been reserved for 6:45 and would that work for us.  Yes, indeedy!!  Nabbed a great corner cozy booth!  One of the best in the house!!  As soon as we sat down we were served big glasses of ice water with lemon and asked if we wanted chips and salsa.  We had never ordered them before and they were really good.  They came warm, with a very flavorful guacamole, a salsa which tasted really great but was a little too warm for me and a couple other dips which I didn't try because I thought they'd be warmer than the salsa.   We ordered drinks - one Reisling, two house Margaritas and one Rob Roy on the Rocks.  Everyone was pleased with their libations!  Onto our dinner orders!   Two of us ordered the grilled shrimp pasta which was amazing!  I can't begin to guess how many calories were in that dish but it was so worth every bite and we both brought some home.  Our companions ordered two of their chicken items and were very pleased!    Our waiter was wonderful!  He was knowledgeable about the menu and spent time with us describing the various dishes.    They also have specials every night written on a chalkboard.  Lots of great sounding stuff, but oh my, that shrimp pasta was - ooh la la!  Will I be back?  Without a doubt if my chapter three in life lasts awhile longer!"}
{"text":"I'm amazed that I haven't posted a review, after years upon years of patronage to both this new and old location. I always describe as upscale New Mexican with large portions.  Green or red? I love green, but sometimes I go for both.  My favorites: + smoked turkey enchiladas + Green Chile stew + breakfast tacos + can you say specials? Fresh fish specials served daily + GCP: Green Chile Potato + Pasta Heidi (Green Chile pasta linguine) + stuffed Anaheim peppers   Location: side by side to Rokerij- I check our both for whom has the better seating. Pro tip: you can usually order the same menu at both.  Decor: who doesn't love the custom hammered copper bars?  Weekends: if you have a group, make a reservation or your wait will be long.  Only thing I have ever disliked on their menu is the House salad: which I avoid."}
{"text":"My favorite out to dinner place in PHX.  Service is spectacular, CJ in the outside bar is funny as Hell, and Jamie, well she's very friendly, and quite a looker.  Oh, the food by the way is outstanding.  Try the enchiladas, pork chop, and my favorite, the pasta Heidi.  If you only have one place to eat in PHX, this is it."}
{"text":"I only come here for breakfast/ brunch and I only order one thing the Eggs Benedict Jalapeno. I've had most of their breakfast and lunch items but every time I order something else I regret it. As a younger man I had them the first time I was there and it was love at first taste. I came back as frequently as I could trying everything I could on their menu. As I have aged Richardson's has taught me that I don't need to be so damn adventurous. I mean I had to honestly ask myself do I really need all of the heart racing excitement of ordering the unknown, wondering if it is going to be any good. The honest answer here is when you find the perfect breakfast item at a place just roll with it. Richardson's Eggs Benedict Jalapeno is my breakfast soul-mate."}
{"text":"I loved the decor.  Missed happy hour but had a marvelous drink called the Hemingway.  Food was expensive, good but not exceptional.  They smoke their own pork.  I put my clothes outside when I got home because they reeked!"}
{"text":"Where do I start? I'm from New Mexico, northern New Mexico, and I am picky about places claiming to serve our amazing cuisine, but clearly the Richardson's restaurants know their stuff.  Oh my goodness: I ordered the breakfast burrito with bacon, potatoes, Christmas (red and green chile together) and my mouth was in chile heaven. Wait. How did I forget? Sunday is happy hour ALL DAY until 6pm. My fiancé ordered the rellenos and eggs and his steamy plate came out covered in chile and cheese goodness. Truly, this is a diamond in the rough.   Our food came out piping hot, the only way to eat a fantastic meal, and our drinks were fantastic.  This place is beautiful! We sat at the outdoor bar, enjoying the beautiful weather, company, and ambiance. You can smell the wood oven and watch pizza and drinks being made right in front of you. The outdoor patio seating looks amazing and we'll definitely be back. Most definitely.   Do not skip this amazing place. It's wonderful and then some!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch (same menu as dinner so a bit pricey) and enjoyed the Chimayo Chicken which is a stuffed chicken breast with spinach, sun-dried tomatoes, poblano chiles and asiago. Not much stuffing and the cheese was all oozed-out but it was tasty with some nice vege's and a great house salad. Probably wouldn't get again. My guest had the Richardson's combo which was more of a brunch item - two chicken enchiladas (outstanding) and a jalapeno benedict (great ham and hollandaise - light) and a mess of tasty asparagus - would highly suggest this dish. The heat level on everything was a bit light but we had not specified more. That was a bit disappointing."}
{"text":"I just want to preface this by saying I LOVE to go out to eat.  And I am not picky and NOT hard to please.  But last night's dinner was one of the top 3 worst dinning experiences of my life.  I don't think the night could of possibly gone worse.  We walked in and were completely ignored.  Servers acted like we were in the way (there was no where to go - didnt they just remodel?  Couldnt they fix that?). And the restaurant was practically empty.  Finally someone came up to us and asked to help us.  I told them we had a reservation and they started to walk us to a table.  The aisle is only one person wide and he walked us to a table full of people.  He said \"oops, that was wrong, I guess we are going over there...\" so we all had to turn around and shimmy down the aisle to the OTHER side of the restaurant.  We were sat in a booth for a few moments when we were approached by an employee who told us we couldnt sit there and the person who sat us \"was just a busser.\"  Um, WTF?  So we are moved to a 1/2 booth/table.  Finally sat, a server immediately approaches us and asked if we would like something to drink or an appetizer.  Um, just sat down, super annoyed, can i get a minute to recover please?    And this server then proceeded to suck my will to live the rest of the night.  More on that later, though.  It is ridiculously dark in the restaurant.  Like, cannot see jack dark.  And the pillows in the booths kind of gross me out...like sleeping in a stranger's bed with dirty sheets.  And bottom line, the food isnt good enough to put up with price and the hassle of valet parking.  My mother in laws steak was well done when she ordered it medium.  My \"stuffed\" pork chop didnt appear to have anything in it.  But again, it was so dark I could of been eating a bear for all I know.  Back to the server.  She would take our order, not write it down and come back FIVE MINUTES LATER and double check with us what we ordered.  And her guess was wrong!  She did it with the drink order AND the food order.  So I guess it makes sense the steak was incorrectly cooked...  End of drinner, we just want to get the hell out...server takes the bill and credit card, brings it back with no receipt to sign.  And of course never comes back.  We had to hunt someone down and he brought us back the recipt to sign.  Sigh.  At the very end of the night, we then get stuck waiting in a line for the valet.  Some lady butted in front at the line.  Unfortunately for her, she got the brunt of my frustrations.  Poor gal was probably just as scarred by her shitty dinning experience."}
{"text":"The bartender was going off on the ladies next to us who returned a dish because it had no turkey in it.  When returned to the kitchen the 3 Mexican  guys in the kitchen were totally talking BS about the customers. In Spanish.  Unprofessional and bad. This place is seriously lacking management and the staff all seemed miserable."}
{"text":"If you are looking for New Mexican food you might as well drive 6 hours to Albuquerque. The food here is mediocre and the red chile tasted burnt. It tastes like the red chile has been made by red chile powder and way too thick. I had 5 people with me. All pro's on NM food. No sopapilla's at all. On a positive note the green chile pasta was pretty good even if the chicken that came with it was dry. The food was heated on the plate and half of the chile was stuck/burnt to the plate."}
{"text":"My son and his fiance brought us and a friend here Saturday night for dinner. We had a reservation but arrived an hour early to sit at the bar for a drink. The hostess was pleasant (with beautiful light lilac colored hair) and said she could get us a table early, which she did within 20 minutes.   Our server was prompt, knowledgeable and very helpful. I am a vegetarian so I read menus whenever possible before my first visit to a restaurant. I knew going into this place that there wasn't a selection for vegetarians, but I held out hope that the there were sides not listed on the menu that I could have them put together for me, which they did.   We ordered appetizers - the roasted garlic plate was delicious! I didn't try the other appetizer plate that was primarily dead stuff, but everyone else said it was wonderful. For dinner I tasted one of their potato stuffed chilies and that was very tasty; I also had sauteed vegetables, rice and beans. I presume the rice was cooked on broth, but I didn't ask. The beans were really good, but very salty. Most restaurants salt the heck out of their beans, though, so I won't deduct for that. I turned my plate of food into 3 meals!   Everyone else at the table loved their entrees. They said their meat/seafood was cooked perfectly with the right amount of sauce/seasoning.   I must commend our server again, he was a young guy who couldn't have been more accommodating. I read reviews where service was the biggest issue for other customers. Fortunately, that was not our experience.   We will definitely eat here again.    Pros: Unique Ambiance - great place to bring a date Service Accommodating  Food was fresh, hot, good flavor Valet parking Charming/cozy patio seating Intimate indoor setting Wine selection   Cons: Very little vegetarian faire  Valet parking the only parking option A little on the pricey side"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times over the years.  Similar to the other two places owned by the same people.  Unfortunately they have the Valet parking for no apparent good reason.  They just tend to be in the way, blocking the parking!  Anyway the food here us OK, I have never been blown away by this place so it has never been a regular of mine.  I first went here almost 20 years ago when it was down the street and remember being a little disappointed back then.  I went with my neighbor who raved about the place but he is from Iowa!  What do they know about Southwest cuisine?!  Like their other two restaurants they have a good atmosphere and friendly staff and their apps are usually better than the entrees and a better value, especially during happy hour."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since the original location on 16th & Bethany before it burnt down.  I recently moved across town and now I'm 5 minutes away so naturally I've been going about once a week.  One of the best places for brunch in the city.  The portions are huge, the food is very spicy, and love the low-light ambiance."}
{"text":"The ambiance to this place was nice, and can be perfect for a date spot. :)   I met up with a friend of mine. The hostess that lead me to my table, seem like she didn't like her job at all. I didn't get a grin or smile,nothing.  I ordered the vegetarian New Mexico enchiladas.  OHHH MYYYY GOOOODNESSSSSSS. Deliciousness to my mouth. :)))))))) the rice, beans to the enchiladas was perfect!!!! I almost killed that dish. And you know what else was perfect??  My  pomegranate  margarita. Yes.. very friendly drink :D   I'll definitely return again."}
{"text":"Very pricey dinner menu, but I couldn't get a simple salad with a vinegarette dressing. Drinks are over priced without any flair. The carne plate, supposed to be their signature dish had much room for improvement. I had high expectations for my first time at this place, but was definitely disappointed!"}
{"text":"STAY AWAY - The food has an amazing flavor and the restaurants offers a unique atmosphere.  However, the restaurant is located in a terrible spot along the main road.  The parking situation is so limited with poor entry signage in fine print.  It can get one feeling very agitated and frustrated.  The valet staff was blasting cars out of the driveway and I would not want them parking my vehicle.  I can park my own vehicle but, there is not much place to park.  Once we got thru the obstacle course and made it into the compound things went more sour.  The hostess seemed excited to quote 45 minute wait at Richardson's and sent us over to check at Rokerij with a longer wait of an hour. Imagine that, all on a Tuesday night. It wasn't even a weekend. I know it says something for the food.  Although, it isn't that large of a place.   In any case, we all just left and went somewhere else.  As a result, I found a great taco shop with great service.  This isn't the first time I've been to Richardson's where I encountered this type of situation but, this is the first time I decided I should write about it.  I was not real pleased with the way the hostess and staff interacted.  Richardson's staff seem to think it is a privilege for me to eat at the establishment and give my business.  In any case, I left dissatisfied and very hungry.  Lets just say I would not go out of my way to recommed this place.  I would recommend Richardson's if you can make reservations and walk there or if you don't mind waiting an hour and half to be seated for dinner.  Perhaps some people are more lucky with better service.  If you are visiting there anyway, maybe try going early.  As I mentioned, the food is amazing but, the service experience might not be so great.  You might even get bad table service from a snotty server like I did on a previous visit a few months back. I gave Richardson's several months before I decided to return back and now this. Now, I'm really not in a hurry to return.  Well they probably won't miss the business anyway.  Did anyone else notice it took some other yelp reviewer people up to 11 years to return?  I wonder why?   If you read this and decide to visit anyway,  maybe you'll have better luck than I have.  If not,  don't say I did not warn you. Good Luck!"}
{"text":"If you haven't been....it's a MUST!!  Unless you hate the freshest, highest quality ingredient or Southwest inspired menu, I promise YOU WILL LOVE it!  Everything from the food, bars (one inside one outside), the most friendly, knowledgeable and down to earth staff.....thus place has it.  They own Rokerij next door which is connected by the coolest outdoor patio and Rokerij has an awesome underground bar......dark, mysterious and fun.  Forgot to check in when I was there last week but I'd give the same review as Richardson's."}
{"text":"I considered myself a American patriot until Richardson's took their red, white & blue enchiladas off of the menu.  Now I don't know what to stand for anymore."}
{"text":"First time I went with my wife sat at the bar and had a great experience.  Bartender was very attentive and friendly.  Drinks were tasty. Bar was crowded too.  Food was on point had ceviche app and spilt the surf and turf,  they spilt it up with an extra green chile potato and was easily a 4-5 star experience. Btw we just told them we were sharing and they spilt it up nice.  Second time, had reservation for 6 for a birthday.  We arrived on time and had to wait 45 minutes for our table.  Host seemed confused and had no one to go for help.  Service was extremely slow food took forever and didn't all come out at once.  Server seemed very frustrated.  Food was off and seemed like there was a major lack of leadership in the front and back of the house.   It's a shame because the flavors are good and group liked the food.  We were in the place for 2.5 hours easily. They did comp an appetizer for the wait but someone in our party had complained. Some of the meals are $40+ you expect them to do a little better.  I will go back and hoping next time I can upgrade score."}
{"text":"My husband and I went for an early dinner here for our anniversary.  We are crazy about this place after just this one visit, Jason was our waiter and he absolutely makes your evening so great !  We sat inside, it was not smokey in there at all.  We arrived about 5pm, Jason said all the tables were reserved at 6:00 and 6:15, so he sat us in a nice booth but we needed to out by 6:15 ( good to know going in, right ! )  Speaking of reservations, you cannot make a reservation for 2 at all, must be 4 thats because they only have a few booths inside, large outside seating on their beautiful patio with fire pit. The food, I had the three enchiladas and you can pick what you want in each one.  My pick was one with green chili pork, one chicken and one cheese, comes with rice and beans and a large very tasty tortilla.  Most places the rice and beans are filler, but here they are so good, you will eat every bite.  The green chili pork was my favorite, the chicken was really good coming in second and the cheese which is usually my fav comes in third  My husband had the carne adovada rice and beans and tortilla.  He really enjoyed it, and the portions were to large that we had it again for lunch the next day. Appetizer you must try the queso with spinach and chorizo comes with blue and regular chips so tasty, so spicy good we ate every drop, the blue chips were the best. We tried the flan, it does have cream cheese in it so its not like regular flan, but its good too. Love, Love, Love this place, their food and Jason ! At dinner all parking is valet."}
{"text":"Beautiful dog friendly patio with cool air fans! Great place to take your furry friend for Sunday Funday!!"}
{"text":"Excellent!  Love their garlic appetizer and they green chili stroganoff is my favorite.  My husband gets the enchiladas which are terrific, and it is always my dad's go to restaurant for his birthday..."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite. Hands down! The food is AMAZING and consistent. Very important because I want to know that I every time I go I will have an amazing meal. That's how it is at Richardsons! Always perfect. The ambiance is chill, it's the perfect place to settle in and catch up with friends. Drinks are delicious. I always leave happy. Love it!"}
{"text":"The husband and I came to Richardson's for happy hour to celebrate our 9 monthaversary (and we had a gift card, so that helped). We sat at the bar, the husband got a beer, I asked for a bellini (since it said they had them on special on their menu) and the bartender looked at me like I was insane... I guess they don't make those anymore? Not sure. I ended up getting a mimosa, which was very good. The OJ tasted fresh and the glass was a generous size. We had a feast of happy hour food items that included: Blackened scallops, chicken tostadas, chipotle ribs, green chili sliders, and a green chili potato. Some items were delicious and some were not so much. The scallops (HH priced at 15$, so still fairly expensive) were the best of the bunch in my opinion. They were perfectly cooked and came with 4 different sauces, beans, and rice... it was all delicious. I would come back and just get that. The portion size was very generous. The ribs were the second best item. They were very tender, fall off the bone, and flavorful. The green chili potato was ok, but really not as special as I would expect for a restaurant's signature item. It is essentially a twice baked potato, but instead of putting the potato innards back into the potato skin, they stuff it into a pepper.... I thought the pepper was too firm and the flavors didn't completely complement each other. The filling could have been seasoned better. The sliders were alright, they were like little french dips sort of with chilies on top. I didn't love them, they just weren't that flavorful or special. The worst dish of the night was the tostadas... they lacked flavor, fell apart, and just were boring. When a menu states that when you order chilies, you're responsible for the heat level, I expect something will be spicy... but nothing was. I liked this place alright overall, but it was a bit inconsistent. I would probably come back for happy hour, but it wouldn't be my first choice in town."}
{"text":"Richardson's along with its sister restaurants are staples in the neighborhood. Always great food with large portions. The service is always good. The servers seem to stay a long time so you see a lot of familiar faces which is nice. Another perk is they open early even during the week. As a early riser it's really nice to have a breakfast option other than IHOP."}
{"text":"A New Mexican restaurant in AZ? This made me think of my best friend who lives in NM. =)  I came here with a friend last night for dinner since she's been dying to come here. I think everything deserves a four star. I ordered the Pasta Hedi which was amazingly delicious! It's a pasta that comes with chicken on top of a tortilla. The sauce was sooooo yummy. I'm really into pasta so I really loved it. It also comes with a house salad which I thought was really good and very good size portion. I had to split it with my friend. We washed everything down with margaritas. I ordered the Prickly Pear margarita which definitely satisfied me after a long day..You have to try it!   The service was also very good. Our server always came back to make sure everything was to our liking. I loved the ambiance of the restaurant as well. It's a great date spot.  The only reason it doesn't get a four star from me is because it's a bit pricey. Between the both of us with our entrees and drinks the bill came out to about $60. That and it's pretty far from me. I wish there was one on my side of town. But you get what you pay for!   I'll definitely be coming back for that pasta and margarita again! Plus their brunch menu also looks beyond yummy and something that I'd like to try out. =)"}
{"text":"Ok I'm updating my review because this place is by far my favorite restaurant in this area. The servers and bartenders are so nice and attentive! I felt like I needed to give them a shout out for their awesome work and for always making mine and my husband's dining experience here amazing hence why we continue coming back. I should try different items but we always end up getting the same thing every time. This place is great for brunch, lunch and dinner. For brunch I always get the enchiladas and eggs. I usually get the beef and cheese enchiladas and it's served w eggs and hash browns. It's HUGE so plan on taking a lot of it home w you... or share it. Also, you can choose from the dinner menu for brunch if you want... And my go to for dinner is the New Mexico Enchiladas (yes I luv enchiladas!!). I usually pick 2 beef and 1 shrimp or 1 chicken. The shredded beef inside the enchiladas are the best! And it comes w rice n beans but I opt out the beans for extra rice. And I always get the red and green sauce combo!! How can I choose btwn the 2?? My husband always gets the garlic shrimp pasta minus the avocado (he has an allergy to avocado! I kno so sad!!). This comes w a tri-colored rotelle pasta in a garlic cream sauce w jumbo shrimp which I always steal a couple from him! It's absolutely delicious!! Overall, I highly recommend this place!! Oh and if you want to watch sports, sit in the outdoor patio in front of the bar!"}
{"text":"Go!  It is really good!  In from the Northeast and sat ouside (true sign of an out of towner in January).  Great space, great decor, and great servie.  Just really good and fresh tasting New Mexican food.  Had a Jalipo Mule and enjoyed it very much.  We both ordered off the specials board and were thrilled,  I ordered a \"trio\" while my guest ordered Lamb Taco's.   The flavors are amazing and with a great balance.  Guaranteed visit next time I'm back in Phoenix."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is classy and fun . Always love the food the spice can be a little hot. Pepsi served in bottles, no free refills. Brought my girls and thought it was not very kid friendly."}
{"text":"I came here just to get a prickly pear margarita.  All 3 were great!!   The food is covered in cheese and sauce, which is not the way I like my food, but I have to give the Manager Mario cudos, he patiently listened to our complaints and did not charge my friend for her dinner, which honestly she did not eat.  Please had a very nice outside seating area which would be great for a group of friends to enjoy some drinks and appetizers"}
{"text":"I am such a huge fan of southwestern food and this place does the trick. Be careful that the food can be pretty spicy as a whole. The ambience is very chill and dark, like a lodge.   My fave dishes are the bacon wrapped shrimp, scallops, and the roasted garlic plate. That garlic plate does me in with the sauces and soft elephant garlic to spread on bread. Wow! I just wish they didn't put a tortillas on the bottom of every plate. The prices can be a little high but the dishes are delicious.   Parking is valet and happy hour is so-so."}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've had in a long time.. I will definitely return. Had to prime rib special it was outstanding"}
{"text":"Finally made it into this great restaurant after hearing good things about it. The food was all good for all four in our party but the prices seamed too high and the service was a little inattentive. I plan to give it another try. I'll also dress a little nicer to blend with all the clientele that frequent the establishment."}
{"text":"Great food but the service is hit and miss sometimes.  Warning: No high chairs, so if you bring kids come prepared."}
{"text":"What an amazing dinner! Richardson's patio is beautiful. Protected from the elements, intimate and yet open and easy dining were tucked into quiet alcoves and booths. We ate at the bar serviced by an exceptional bartender.  The Hendrick's gin and tonic was cold and perfectly poured and the buttery Chardonnay by Landmark was an excellent suggestion. My husband had the Tortilla crusted halibut, and I selected the Pine nut crusted sea bass. The fish was a generous cut that was served at the perfect temperature - the sea bass was flaky and soft while the halibut was tender and firm. The sides were equally delicious with the right touch of Southwestern heat.   Perfect ambiance. Service was excellent and on point. The food innovative and delicious - a 5 star evening!"}
{"text":"Terrible experience at Richardson's!     Uneducated, lazy, INEXPERIENCED people working here.   If you're going to charge families $80 - $100 to eat at your restaurant hire competent staff."}
{"text":"Loved this place so much, I wanted to stay for hours. Felt just like home. It's a very cozy restaurant, yet fancy and I love that. The waiter was very friendly. The food thou, it's delicious! Can't remember what I ordered but I'm pretty sure I will be ordering the same when I go back."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places. Not kid friendly, no high chairs. But beautiful setting and delicious food!"}
{"text":"This was always our go to for brunch, lunch or dinner. But now we live in California, so don't get to go as often as we'd like.  We'd always choose to sit outside, being Phoenix the weather is always great and to be honest I think it's just far to dark inside.  My favorite is the double Pork Chop Chorizo. It's massive and will satisfy any hunger. Although I must admit last week while there half of the meat was far too undercooked. Asked for it medium but it was raw and I like my meat on the rarer side. I would've said something but I was completely full with what I'd eaten. That's the only time I wasn't 100% happy with my meal there.  If they have it, which sometimes they don't for some reason get the Mango Habenero sauce it's wonderful. Spicy but just so tasteful.  Nice atmosphere, a bit on the pricer side but I'll keep going back and I'm fussy about where I eat. Always a full house so you know they're doing something right."}
{"text":"I've been here many times after moving to the valley 2 years ago.  After having most of the dishes on the menu, I have to say that it's some of the best food that I have ever had. Any time that visitors are in town, this is where we go out to eat.  Love it, love it love it."}
{"text":"Perfect every time! From the $5 Mimosas/Bloody Marys to the  Huevos Ranchero! Definitely try the garlic plate it's delicious. Today I went for the fish trio. Mahi, Swordfish and scallops and washed it down with a Greyhound that's made with fresh grapefruit juice."}
{"text":"This place doesn't understand how to fix a bad situation.  Our friends got us a $50 gift card for Richardsons/Dicks/Rockerji for our wedding.  Two weeks later we went in for brunch at Richardsons, and were told there was only 18 dollars on it.  The manager said there was nothing they could do, but he'd look into it and get back with us. We heard nothing.  Two days later we called, and another manager said he knew nothing about this but would research it.  We heard nothing.  Again, we called and a third manager said it was the first time he heard of this and would look into it.  Finally someone called back and said they'd make it right - come on in and have dinner on them.   A day later someone calls and says the card was used a week after we got the card at Dick's Hideaway on a Monday (we have kids and haven't gone out on a Monday in years), but they'd still make it right.  We asked them if they had any video footage, because we didn't use the card, and would like to help them get to the bottom of this.  They never responded to this request, but said come in and we will make it right.   We decided to come in and take up their offer, only to be told the owner told the managers not to honor it.   A)it's concerning that they don't care that their gift cards are faulty or someone is stealing from them internally, and B) it's amazing that they decided not to make this right and fight us on this over $32.00.  UPDATE: After involving the BBB and the AG's office, they finally refunded the disputed amount."}
{"text":"Great service and fantastic food. I had the Carne Adovada and it was phenomenal. Great experience!"}
{"text":"This is a New Mexico Mexican food restaurant. I liked hearing this when I first arrived. I personally do not care for spicy food and so it may not be fair for me to leave this review because just about everything on that menu did not sound appetizing to me. I did tell the server I did not like spice and was not given any alternative suggestions. The area we sat in was extremely cold all of us were shivering. Overall the food was alright. I did like the atmosphere. I'd go again but definitely would not be my first choice."}
{"text":"Tried this place one more time.  Sat outside in the bar area....much better!  The service was awesome and the food was fantastic.  We ordered several apps that we all very good and orders the stuff pork chops again...this dish is a must if you go there.  The margaritas were also really good.  I will go back again, but will definitely sit outside."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places!!!  Love the cozy atmosphere & how they replicated the old place to a T!  We love to take friends there because we know with out a doubt they will Love it!  There is something for everybody, seafood to mexican, to pizza(which is wonderful)  they have a wonderful happy hour if you are lucky enough to get a seat around the bar :)  And don't miss the chance to have the roasted garlic platter, it is to die for!  (just make sure everyone with you eats it too ;)  Easy to make a reservation on yelp so what are you waiting for?  Go NOW!"}
{"text":"Review for Dick's Hideaway:  This place is called many things from Rokerij(y), Richardsons, and Dick's Hideaway. We went and grabbed breakfast and it was ok but pretty pricey for what we got. I was not a fan of the filet mignon breakfast or the way they do the beans on the tortillas but it was an ok experience. The next time we decided to try it for an early dinner but then decided to sit at the bar since happy hour is 5$ for appetizers(small plates). This is where the place really shines. The onion rings are the best I have had, The filet mignon skewers were excellent. The bacon wrapped shrimp were good but nothing to write about, but the prime ribsliders were top notch. We left with a small bill after a few drinks and some good food and vowed to go with friends again soon.  Go at happy hour and sample some small plates."}
{"text":"Definitely a must-try in Phoenix for New Mexican food with some unique twists.  The atmosphere is cool, but the staff can be hit-or-miss depending on who you get as your server or bartender.  Regardless, check it out for yourself for savory food and an authentic feel."}
