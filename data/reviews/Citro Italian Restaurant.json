{"text":"Citro is a quaint little restaurant and fairly unassuming at Yonge just north of Major Mackenzie in Richmond Hill. While it is small, Chef Johnny commands the kitchen, and delivers fabulous food.  We went with a party of 7 people on a Monday evening, and had for appetizers: the caesar salad, Carciofi Fritti (the grilled artichoke hearts, and a special lamb ribs. All were excellent. The artichokes were lemony and crispy but not overpowering in the breading, and the lamb ribs, according to those who had them were succulent and tender in a delicious sauce, while the caesar really spoke italy, with the punch of anchovy in the dressing.  The main courses rolled out in a timely manner, as the restaurant filled up (a good sign on a Monday night). The one waitress handled the room well, and we felt that everything was brought out without too long a wait.   The main courses enjoyed were: Veal Scaloppine Limone (served with roasted fingerling potatoes and seasonal vegetables, Penne Vodka (perfectly balanced with the smoky bacon and rose sauce and al dente penne, and two specials that night - a wild mushroom risotto and a seafood risotto, both were scrumptious.  The desserts - hang onto your hats - Citro may actually serve the best creme brulée on the planet! Perfectly sized and delish! They also served wonderful cannoli special with delicious marscapone filling.  Overall we had a wonderful meal, good service and in the last two days since, we have recommended Citro to several friends - it's worth the drive to Yonge and Major Mack!"}
{"text":"Great meal. Small room but food is very good, clearly made fresh and service was attentive. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Ah Richmond Hill, when will you grow up to be what you could be? Thankfully, this little hole in the wall gem renews my hope. This is a great little place with perfectly cooked pasta. Saying it is the best that the town has to offer doesn't do it justice as the bar for \"good\" around here is set way too low. So let me say that I've had several of the menu options and have been delighted with each. Citro could hold it's own with some of the best Italian in NYC. I truly hope that they can attract enough clientele to grow and to encourage other good restaurants are to begin to expand the town's offerings."}
{"text":"Tiny place that looked unimpressive from the outside, but I was definitely impressed with the food and service. It is a very small place so the inside is cosy with a peaceful atmosphere.   Because the place was small and they had an open kitchen concept, they were able to maximize efficiency in bringing food to tables. The waitress was very friendly and attentive. She is a ninja too; she came by and refilled my cup of water without me noticing. (That or I'm just inattentive of my surroundings.)  I ordered a zucchini and sweet pea soup, a seafood linguine, and for dessert we had a creme brulee and a tiramisu. The soup had a perfect consistency; it was not too watery yet it was not very heavy. I thought it was slightly under salted but I think that was part of the light taste. Either way, it was an enjoyable opener to the meal. The linguine was refreshing and filling, and there was plenty of seafood in it. The desserts were delicious as well. The creme brulee had a good consistency and it was fun to hear the crack of the top layer as I dug into it with my spoon. The tiramisu had plenty of coffee flavour. The chef definitely makes an art out of his food."}
{"text":"I was there for lunch last Wednedsay based on all the review.  I was craving pasta, and that's the only thing I ordered.  Their home made spicy pasta sauce was ok.  Probably because of lunch time, there were no one except for us (12:00 till 1:00) For the price of the pasta, the quality of the pasta was just a little better than IL FORNELLO  but for a little bit more."}
{"text":"Excellent! I had the bruschetta, Mediterranean salad, and gnocchi. All very good. The salad was tossed well with the right proportions of all the ingredients. The bruschetta was slightly outlier than I would have liked but the taste was great. The gnocchi was amazing! Loved the sauce, the veggies were fresh, gnocchi fresh and homemade. Service was great - they were very friendly and attentive. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Friendly and efficient service. Butternut squash and apple soup is amazing. Vodka penne with bacon is good. Creme brûlée was served cold and a bit runny. Food portions are a decent size. Free parking behind the restaurant."}
{"text":"I always get my pizzas from Citro. The vegetarian Pulita is so good.  Everything made from scratch, fresh ingredients and always tasty Supporting a local restaurant, which is not a chain or a mall is important to me. So if you live in Richmond Hill Old Village; take a walk up there or use their parking just behind the restaurant!"}
{"text":"This is definitely one of my favorite restaurants! The food here are amazing, and the price is very reasonable! The waitresses are very friendly and nice, as well as the chef, Johnny! Highly recommend this to people who love pasta!!"}
{"text":"Great cozy little restaurant with authentic Italian food.  When I came back from Italy I thought it'd be pretty hard to get me to go back to an Italian restaurant that would own up to real Italian food, but Citro did it for me! Great service and try to save room for the tiramisu!"}
{"text":"We were going to go for wings and found this place on yelp. Probably the best decision ever made. We have decide to make it our restaurant. The service was amazing! It's a nice quiet restaurant so it's not to loud and you can converse with family friends or your partner. The food was out of this world! Perfectly priced and deeeeelicious!! If you're around the area I would highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Johnny the chef is passionate about food and your tongue will agree. This place is a  jewel. I have experience in working in kitchens and recommend his food to anybody. He will also cook low calorie diet strict foods if u wish."}
{"text":"This is a small family owned restaurant.  Johnny who is the owner, chef as well as the guy who picked up my numerous calls about my reservation was very genuine and friendly. When the restaurant was too hot and he had to jump up on a chair to fix the fan and lights - he was very kind enough to do so. We felt very welcoming.  Food wise - it is pretty good, I would strongly suggest the calamari, braised beef and the steak. Steak came out too over-cooked and we sent it back with no problems. I ordered the seafood pasta and requested to change the tomato sauce into creamy Alfredo but got refused to. A bit disappointed there and the seafood was not up to par, shrimps were not fresh and very small like frozen ones. So don't go for the seafood pasta.  Overall, service was quick and it is a pleasant experience but I would not go back."}
{"text":"Excellent homemade pastas. Service was friendly and solicitous. Visiting from the states with a large group.  Hits-gnocchi, linguine frutti di mare; Misses-none. Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I enjoyed a fantastic meal tonight. I had the vodka penne - the sauce was delish. My boyfriend had the Calabrese pizza and he loved it. I highly recommend the tiramisu to finish. A note about the service - our waitress was wonderful! We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"It's my second time here only because That's Italian is fully booked and this is the closest Italian restaurant.  The food came out way too slow, I mean over an hour of wait for the main course? And I see my fish , pizza and pasta all waiting behind the kitchen for the last dish so it can come out all together. Of course when it's served, the fish is cold. And I told the server when she asks how's the food, and she just smiled.  While we were waiting, we didn't get bread.   The pizza was good, pasta was al dente, which was good. Lasagna was small portion with a big dish, could have just put a piece of bread beside it. Fish was cold. Overall the food was not bad but waiting for over an hour or more is just abit too much and we are the only table there. Can you imagine if there's another table ?"}
{"text":"(3.5 stars) upon entering this cozy restaurant, I knew we were in for a treat. They are a bit short-staffed, so the service was quite slow. Be wary of this especially on weekends. However, the food met my expectations. I got the grilled calamari and lamb sausage farafaelle, which were both delicious. the halved olives were my favourite part of the pasta, as they were not too sour. Aside from slow service, the food quality was above par. Would come again on a less busy occasion."}
{"text":"LOVE this place :) gnocchi is great, bruschetta is great, calamari is great, everything is great! It's quite a quaint little place but the food is perfect. Only downside is when there's other groups it's hard to have quiet if you go only as a group of two, but usually very quiet :) been there three times and will return!!"}
{"text":"Nice environment to chill and have dinner. Can't say I was impressed with the pasta (too hard and not too flavourful) which is what I thought these guys are known for."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant because we were in the area and there were raving yelp reviews.   BIG MISTAKE  This restaurant won't last much longer - we were the only ones in the restaurant during dinner; which I now understand why.   Appetizers - I ordered the caprese salad which was $14. Way too overpriced for slices of hot house tomatoes and store bought stale mozzarella. Nothing about this was appetizing. My father ordered the mushroom soup and enjoyed it.   Mains - he has the liver which he said was ok. The meat was tougher than it should have been and the gravy was way too salty. I had the chicken piccata which was rubbery (had to work quite hard to cut it) and again was covered in a salty flavorless sauce.  The main dishes were not worth their $24 and $22 price tags.   Stay away if you are in the area. You are better to go to one of the big box restaurants down the street."}
{"text":"My wife and I were searching for a random Italian restaurant to try in the Richmond Hill area and came across Citro, which had very positive reviews. When we arrived, we were surprised to find a very small and quaint restaurant. My wife ordered the Homemade Ricotta Gnocchi with sautéed Mushrooms, Zucchini & Roasted Red Peppers in a Rosé sauce. Each of the gnocchi pieces were smaller than what we've usually seen, but they were just melt-in-your-mouth delicious! I ordered one of the specials they had - a mushroom risotto with tenderloin tips. The risotto was excellently done with a wonderfully creamy sauce and the tenderloin tips were very tender. For dessert, we shared a tiramisu. Very creamy and just the right amount of coffee flavour. One of the best we've tried. After conversing with the waiter, we also found out that everything is made in-house, including their sauces and desserts (including the tiramisu). The restaurant is also planning on re-making their menu. I encouraged them to add the mushroom risotto I tried as a regular menu item. I really enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"Back to 5 stars again! This last time we went we had much better service! Yay! Chef Johnny at the top of his game, slightly modified specials menu, we tried the European sea bass - excellent flavours! Everyone should try this place, it is soooo much better than the other Italian restaurants in Richmond Hill!"}
{"text":"Overview: Good Italian food, nice service, average portions  Visited Citro on a Thursday evening. Staff were very accommodating which was appreciated. Small place. Ordered the bruschetta, zucchini fritta, and zucchini and spinach soup (special) as appetizers. Both the bruschetta and zucchini fritta were very good. The fritta came with a nice tangy marinara sauce. The soup I would not order again, bit oily for my taste but the portion you get us worth the price of a soup! As a group we ordered two types of gnocchi, a pizza, and bolognese. All were good. Their espresso is also very good.  Good flavour. Would come back here again should I get the itch for Italian."}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time, only the pizza and calamari was good, had the lasagna ($16) and the potion was very small. Looked like it was reheated in the microwave and the center was still cold. None of the entrees on the menu comes with bread or salad. Menu is very over priced for that kind and size of food.  Very disappointed and will not return or recommend!"}
{"text":"It's a little over priced for what you get. The food was good. I ordered a pizza, other people got pasta and the steak.. All were considered pretty good but the serving sizes were just almost not enough.   The interior is nothing special, dark, no character.  The service was alright. Forgettable to be honest.   Comparing to grazie.. There's no comparison. You get better service, food (and more)  at a lower price."}
{"text":"I am only taking off one star due to the parking situation behind the premise.  When we visited the restaurant for dinner at 6:00pm on a Saturday they were 3 cars already parked in the designated parking space for Citro at the back of the building, but there was only one table occupied with patrons inside.  Other than that, the overall experience was great.  Clean tables, nice quiet, cozy ambiance. Respectful, friendly waitress. Food was served in a timely manner. We tried the spaghetti with chicken meatballs, beef ravioli and the Garlic bread w cheese as appetizer.  All were great choices!  Recommend it and will go again for good food."}
{"text":"I have said this before, Chef Johnny is arguably the most attentive to detail I have encountered in years.  Having recently returned to being a vegetarian, I had spoken to him when making my reservation and he assured me that he could pretty much prepare anything to suite my taste.  Chef Johnny, DOES NOT DISAPPOINT!  Our salad consisting of tomatoes, cucumbers, olives and goat cheese was perfect and fresh with a house made balsamic drizzled dressing.   I had order a linguini a la putanesca, one of my favorite Italian dishes and my wife had the calves liver.  when compared to some other high-end Italian restaurants we have frequented in the past, Citro is by far and away better.  The ambiance and regularly changing artwork make it a wonderful place to enjoy your evening.    Our meals were outstanding.  It is rare to have a meal whereby you find the food is perfectly balanced and layered.  Neither requiring salt nor pepper, you find yourself savoring every mouthful and wishing your dish did not end.  The portions are GREAT because they are closer to Euro than American, meaning you don't feel bloated but you do feel satiated.  We finished with espresso, tea and the house made mixed berry pie with gelato.  I don't know about you all, but I like, no LOVE, to taste my food and not have it masked in sweet or salt.  This pie was unseated and allowed the berry flavors to marry with the flakey pie crust (all house made).  An end to a perfect meal.  Thank you Chef Johnny!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant! Don't judge it by its small size! It's cozy and the servers are always fantastic! The room is always clean and I love the open concept! You can see the chef cooking your meal and it always arrives at your table hot and freshly done.  Their pastas are always a great texture, not to hard and definitely not mushy. And their sauces are the best I've ever tasted short of actually visiting Italy. If you want delicious Italian food that can still surprise your taste buds, this is the place to go!  My personal favorite dish is the penne vodka! Well priced, great portion sizes and just so delicious!!! And after dinner, you can take a stroll down the main street :)"}
{"text":"Don't ask me what took me so long to try Citro. I have no excuse. Finally after multiple friends and neighbors recommended it most highly, we tried it. Excellent meal. Had calf liver, gnocchi, and a couple of pizzas. Very good flavour. Good value. Restaurant was very clean. Chef Johnny was very pleasant. Nice to see some of the action as Johnny cooks in front of you. Now I have a new go to Italian restaurant in the core of old Richmond Hill. Give it a try. This is the kind of place the downtown really needs."}
{"text":"They said they ran out of pizza dough and pappardelle but the table came after us got pizza.... They claim their pasta is homemade but it tastes hard which means it's not really fresh at all. If this place was located at downtown Toronto it won't last long. It won't.  PS. They also do 17% auto-gratuity for large parties but didn't bother to give us a heads up until the bill came."}
{"text":"Cute quaint restaurant in downtown Richmond hill. We were a party of 5 and the service was efficient and fast. I had the tilapia with white wine sauce and it came with a side of veggies and pan-fried potatoes. Delish, but wish the side was bigger, I was still hungry after the main entree. The tiramisu was to die for. Not too sweet and the perfect texture. Will be back again!"}
{"text":"Okay, so the party of roughly 14 probably contributed to the long waiting time, but my friends and I were collectively ready to pass out when our food was finally served.  I ordered the dinner special of strozzapretti with turkey ragu.  It was actually an elongated and chewy type of hand-rolled pasta - and I loved the texture.  The pasta sauce, however, was underwhelming.. could be from a canned product for all I know.  The turkey was sparse but with the parmesan cheese the dish tasted okay overall.    I tried my friend's linguine with seafood in red wine sauce - it was a little too sour for my taste so I actually liked my own dish better.  My other friend's risotto was made with lots of 'shrooms and while the mushroom taste was VERY strong, the risotto was done deliciously.  If I ever return to the area, that would probably be my dish to order.  Also, there's a cake cutting fee of $2/person if you ever go there for someone's birthday :P"}
{"text":"Gem in the rough!  Amazing butternut squash soup!  Veggie pizza & pene a la vodka with bacon is to die for!  You definitely have to visit!  They even have their own hot sauce! Ask for it for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic little spot in Richmond Hill. It's in an older, rough-looking building but the food is out of this world. Fried artichoke hearts are really good and the pasta is spot-on as well. The fettucini had a great sauce so I requested a couple pieces of bread to soak up all the goodness and I was brought about 8 pieces of beautiful sliced baguette that was quickly grilled to give it a little crunch, no charge too!  Very classy place! Haven't tried sandwiches or pizza but I will be back to give them a shot for sure. Prices are reasonable too!"}
{"text":"I was surprised by this place. I caught them at a good time when I decided to drop in. It was quiet and not too busy which means there is less room for lower quality food.  I ordered the gnocchi and i had the waitress baffled. Sweet girl but she's got to learn a lot real fast if she is going to work in an Italian restaurant. Service was fast and attentive. She did a great job, I tipped her well for her effort.  As for the Gnocchi, I always love to see freshly made gnocchi, however it was a TAD underdone, but sauce made up for it and was a great dish. However, the star here to my surprise was the vegetables you really got to taste their flavors.   I love places like this. These are places that turn into the little hidden secret of cities and I LOVE finding them. Definitely going to bring my wife here later on this month."}
{"text":"Best food ever!!!. the staff are so kind and friendly. very nice and clean place, plus you will get your food ready so fast. The best italian food I have ever had."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the lack of street presence. The outside is not even lit up at night and the inside is definitely so low light that it looks like it is closed. We both ordered a nightly special of beef tips, fusilli, garlic and mushrooms that was virtually perfect. Try to remember the last time you had a dish that you had to eat slowly because it was so good. My only problem with Citro is I live 50km away :("}
{"text":"We just had a lovely dinner at Citro restaurant. The gnocchi are home made and delicious. The veal shank perfect on this cold Fall night. We highly recommend you visit this neighbourhood gem."}
{"text":"Thanks to Yelp, I was able to discover this nice Italian restaurant near home.  It was a quiet evening with another party of 3 that was there already when we arrive at 6pm on Monday night, Family day.  A few of us had soup to start.  The Manhattan clam chowder was delicious.  We also got the garlic cheese bread which was also very good.  As for entrees, we had Linguini Di Mare (seafood pasta), Calabrese Pizza (pepperoni, salami, chorizo sausage and smoke bacon), Chicken Picatta Limone (butter & lemon), Grilled Salmon and the Grilled Rainbow trout.  All the dishes were good portions and the sides of potatoes and veggies were nice.  I really liked my salmon which I will definitely order again in the future.  My sister enjoyed the seafood pasta and it was nice that she was able to change it to a spicy sauce.  Everyone enjoyed their meals so we will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Was there for dinner. Food is amazing !!!!!!! The only downside is very dirty windows...please clean et .... Will back again for sure"}
{"text":"I had deep fried artichoke as appetizer and it was delicious. It wasn't greasy at all even it's deep fried. The sauce was tasty and i was told it's homemade! lovely pasta, it's al dente. it reminds me of the time in Italy. All their desserts were homemade as well. I would go back again."}
{"text":"I wasn't terribly blown away by this place. Came to celebrate a friend's dinner with a large group of 15+ people. The restaurant is pretty small and there is limited parking space behind the restaurant so you may need to park in the lot across the street. I ordered off the special menu and got the strozzapreti (a twisty kind of pasta) with turkey ragu and spinach ($16). The dish was okay overall, but nothing amazing. I liked the texture of the pasta, which was a little bit firm/al dente. The sauce just tasted like regular tomato sauce though and there wasn't really that much turkey.  We experienced some difficulty when it came to splitting our bill, since the waitress at first said we had to keep everything on one bill. Afterwards she wrote up a bill for a few of us who wanted to leave early, but miscalculated a few things and overcharged us. The bill was just written by hand and was kind of unclear, so make sure you check for any human errors.  We brought a birthday cake and the staff was kind enough to help us cut and serve it. However, keep in mind that they do charge a cake cutting fee which is $2 and based on the number of people sitting at the table/number of slices cut."}
{"text":"We had my son's confirmation luncheon at Citro today. As usually the service was great and Johnny wowed us with a spectacular meal.   This place is a family favourite of ours and we have had several large dinners there. Thank you Johnny! Can't wait to come back:)."}
{"text":"Walked into this restaurant with high expectation especially after reading all the good reviews about it from yelp. But sadly, I was pretty disappointed not only about the quality of the food but also the dining atmosphere and the experience.  Ordered spinach soup and seafood soup for appetizer. The spinach soup was watery and the taste was not up to par.  The seafood soup was a little bit better than the spinach soup but the soup is mostly consist of over cooked seafood chunks.  I was expecting the atmosphere of this restaurant to be a little bit more up scale with the price like this.  Very disappointed with their table setting and decor. Tables look like those typical lunch room tables. They should at least consider using table cloths to cover them up. The waiter was polite and well dressed in uniform, however he messed up our order and gave us a different pasta.   I will not recommend this place and will not come again."}
{"text":"Being a Manhattanite, it's sometimes easy to forget how spoiled we are when comes to good restaurants.  But since I am visiting family at Markham, I had to adjust my expectation.  I would give Citro a 3.5 star:   Pro: + we had three dessert dishes, all pretty good (Tiramisu tasteful but a bit too soft, poached pear with gelato-good pear but gelato was actually not very impressive) + the short rib was the best--good taste and tenderness, the gnocchi has good taste but a bit too soft, seafood linguine was good, lobster Ravioli was a bit big and salty + the espresso was good  Con:  - the appetizers were pretty week (spinach broccoli cream soup, crab cake, and cucumber tomato salad) - no signature bread?! - ambiance was pretty minimum though comfortable...  I wouldn't count against it   - the wait service was a bit underwhelmed.    Overall, I liked the experience.  It's a wall in hole place, but I like to help a restaurant with good food to succeed, especially when it's in a place where we don't expect decent Italian place."}
