{"text":"All the fish is fantastic, especially the salmon. The head chef is and expert and great to talk to. Seek his recommendations, he won't lead you wrong."}
{"text":"Let's face it, sushi is a luxury. So when you indulge in such make sure to do it right. I've had the pleasure to experience the artfully crafted dishes that Chef Jay has been putting out for well over a decade. He has the knowledge, skill, and passion to which carries out in his food. If you are looking for high quality fish look no further. Become a regular and be friendly with Jay, it pays it's dividends. After time he will begin to understand your palate and create something to suit your sushi needs. I see all sorts of regulars from professional athletes, young professionals, and older Asians following Jay around and it's for good reason.  If you want recommendations I can tell you this. Nothing is going to let you down. Not only are the rolls on the menu delicious but so is the hot food from the kitchen. The meat is fresh, the vegetables are crisp, and the flavors are bold.  Oh and it's summertime so it's nice to know that the beers and glasses are always perfectly chilled!"}
{"text":"This is the best sushi place ever!!!! The best presentations on every plate! A lot of attention to detail.  The food tastes \"5 star\" amazing and first class service!!!!"}
{"text":"AMAZING!  My wife and I were looking for an AYCE Sushi place, and ended up here after reading some not so great reviews of Mido.  They don't offer All You Can Eat here, but GO!  They have \"Happy Days\" instead of Happy Hour, with great specials on Sunday-Thursday(see Menu).  The sushi was phenomenal, not to mention the miso soup, gyoza, and mochi ice cream!  Our favorite roll had to be the Tootzzy Roll, with a very close second being the Geisha. The Las Vegas Roll is my favorite preparation I've ever had. In the Tootzzy and Geisha, the shrimp and tuna were on par (or honestly even better) with some of the best quality fish I've ever had - and that's coming from a Southern California native who just moved to the valley a few months ago!   Needless to say, we found our new Sushi spot. Between the manager regularly checking in on us and giving us 5 star service, to the quality preparation, and creativity of the sushi - we'll definitely be back for more!  Also, the chef even modified a roll or two to our liking - like preparing the Marilyn Monroll as a traditional roll, and offering to add cream cheese to another, or even preparing a regular roll as spicy. It was a genuinely pleasant experience.  Didn't even take a picture of the sushi because we were too busy enjoying it... But here's one of the mochi ice cream!!  Don't waste your time with cheaper quality AYCE Sushi when you can eat to your satisfaction for what works out to be about the same price, and actually get top quality fish from a chef and manager who are doing a fantastic job with this new spot!"}
{"text":"Great Sushi in Mesa!  Their specialty rolls rock.  Great and friendly service.  Don't fight the crowds elsewhere, come to Makittos in Riverview where you can enjoy amazing sushi in a quiet atmosphere.  Our new favorite place for sushi!"}
{"text":"Sushi was amazing.  Very good service and owner was great to talk to.  I highly recommend this place if you're craving sushi."}
{"text":"This place was okay the fold was good but the place had a bad smell I would expect them to keep it a little cleaner overall I would go back if the smell went away ."}
{"text":"This is the only place I've eaten in the valley that is comparable to quality LA sushi joints. Totally legit. I will be back for chef omakase. Great service. Really rooting for this little joint!"}
{"text":"I've followed Jay, the owner and head sushi chef, for years simply because his sushi is excellent.  His new establishment, Makitto, is small but comfortable, and it pains me little to make the drive across town knowing that his sushi is the destination.  He's very particular about the fish he orders (i.e., making sure that certain species come from specific regions) and is happy to make recommendations or create something special for you if you feel like trying something new and different.  Their customer service has been excellent, even in these early days, as the staff has always been genuinely friendly and very attentive.  On the weekends, I'd recommend arriving as early as possible as they're likely to fill up quickly although I doubt a wait would be very long (as others have noted, its located right next to the Cinemark 16 movie theater, so it's a great place for date night!).  Makitto is quaint, clean, comfortable, and the kind of place that one goes to when the priority is really great sushi.  I could make no greater recommendation - I just cannot think of any sushi restaurant in the Valley where the quality and presentation compares.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Location: New sushi restaurant in Mesa Riverview plaza. Its located right next to Cinemark movie theater.  Food: Their speical rolls are awesome. Very unique and different from other sushi restaurants. Sushi chefs are very friendly and really know how to make good rolls and sushi. Highly recommended.   Price : its slightly more expensive than other small size sushi restaurants in Mesa. But totally worth it.  Service: very friendly but could be a bit slow when they are busy. Overall decent service"}
{"text":"This is a great sushi place. The portions are somewhat small, we ended up having to get more than usual because of that. But needless to say, it was delicious. We had the jalapeños and calamari for an appetizer - I was not a fan of either.  Our server was very friendly, welcoming and attentive."}
{"text":"Amazing food, friendly service, and a great atmosphere! There wasn't anything I tried that I didn't like. There is a great selection of sushi rolls and sashimi as well as other dishes such as chicken katsu and tempura udon. Can't wait to go back and try more!"}
{"text":"Secret spot. Delicious.  The spicy edamame and sashimi lunch platter is my go to during the day."}
{"text":"This place is great. The servers were all friendly, the music selection was awesome and the food was perfect. Their salmon sashimi was our groups favorite part, it melted in your mouth and was absolutely delicious. We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this gem while visiting The Riverview. I typically only go to Scottsdale for sushi; reluctantly still. After dining in at Makitto, I can easily without a doubt say this is the best sushi place in AZ. Better than Sushi Roku, Geisha A Go Go, and any spot you can think of. The owners roll the sushi and wait on the customers. Truly a remarkable experience and cannot stress how highly I recommend this place.  -Highly Satisfied Cust."}
{"text":"Come over to this new sushi joint in Riverview.  The owners are friendly.  Come try their house rolls and Japanese entrees.  You can eat at the sushi bar or at one of their dining tables."}
{"text":"Best sushi in the Phoenix area. We've been following Chef Jay Chung for a few years, and we're excited that he's opened this new place. His sushi is as fresh as it's always been, and he's added some new touches to his dishes. He's an artist: His food is always artfully presented AND delicious. This is worth repeating: His sushi is the freshest in Arizona.   The location is a short drive for us from south Scottsdale, just off the 202 in Mesa Riverview, so we're thrilled that he is still close to home!"}
{"text":"One star for the service, the sushi is good, a little too pricey for area and the menu is poor in that there are no sushi/sashimi/roll combos.  So, I called twice left 5 minutes in between and both times went to the answering machine.  So I went down there to put in the to go order and waited 10-15 min for them to prepare the order.  I mentioned to the waitress that I called twice and no one picked up so I wouldn't have to wait.  She acknowledged that she heard the phone but didn't pick up because two tables came in when I called.  I asked if I could get happy hour price which is done in only and was more or less $2 off a roll since I waited inside.  She responded it is dine in only, I asked if can make exception since I waited and she acknowledged I called, she said no.  Just think that bad business and service when you acknowledged that you chose not to answer the call and say please hold."}
{"text":"Delicious and fresh sushi! So happy to have a great sushi restaurant in Mesa Riverview plaza! Great service, nice atmosphere and as I said, yummy sushi."}
{"text":"Came here when they first opened a month ago to catch their grand opening specials and because we know how expensive a sushi dinner can get. We came back today because we were hooked and would pay without the discount just to have their rolls again! This is the kind of place that you get what you pay for. The quality is present. New favorite sushi spot!"}
{"text":"I am pretty picky about fish and have never been disappointed with the selection here. The fish is always fresh and you can see the passion in the food that comes out. The specialty rolls are unique and delicious.  Giesha roll, lay back roll and so sexy are a few of my favorites. If you like sushi you have to make your way here."}
{"text":"I find it very hard to find good, quality sushi in Arizona. Fortunately, this place was amazing! Super cute restaurant and friendly staff. My server was Edson and he was the absolute best! My friend and I weren't very hungry, but we decided to have a quick bite here after our movie. We got the agedashi tofu, spicy tuna roll, and sexy me roll and all I can say is that I can't wait to come back. Next time I think I'll try their wagyu!"}
{"text":"Awesome spot!! Lots of creative healthy options.  Marilyn Rolls and Seafood Poke are the must-get items. This is undoubtedly our new fav' restaurant now. And its not just the food but the hospitality as well. We will see you again soon!!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best sushi restaurant in the valley. The food is great, very high quality.  Love the sushi burrito, a must try."}
{"text":"This place is one of those shopping mall joints you go to when there's no other option but you really want sushi. I ordered two rolls with specific requests to add rice to one (instead of the rice wrap) and to avoid using soy sauce on either. The menu is odd - the items are super specific and limited - so I had to request modifications. One of the servers made us order by marking on the menu but took the order verbally. Weird. My prediction was that she would completely slaughter the order, which turned out to be correct. The rice modification was forgotten and one of the rolls I ordered never appeared. We had to reorder everything. The food was mediocre at best, so I  felt like I wasted all that time for nothing when I could be having a real meal just about anywhere else. They did have a 20% off special, which was nice. The discount is really the only thing this place has going for it."}
{"text":"I vacation in Mesa every year in May and simply love sushi. We'd been frequenting a place near our vacation house for the past few years, but I wanted to try something new.   I read a review from a person that followed this sushi chef around, stating he's super particular about the quality/types of fish he uses. I love me a particular sushi chef, so we tried it. It was amazing! We had the salmon nigiri and the scallop nigiri along with seaweed salad, edamame (of course) and 2 rolls.   It was so good, I went back a few days later for lunch. I found out the sushi chef has been making sushi for 22 years. Everyone is very friendly, service is great and the food is SUPER fresh and delicious. I found my new favorite restaurant in Mesa!"}
{"text":"I've grown up eating sushi. I've eaten sushi around the world.  This place ranks up there. Jay the sushi chef is excellent considering he didn't follow the traditional training route where you may spend several months just cooking the rice.  Jay has worked at several different sushi restaurants.  He currently owns this place.  I know the quality of the ingredients will always be excellent. HIs creativity shows in his rolls which offers a plethora of taste and textures.   Since this place is relatively new and initially starting out his variety of seafood has only the standard items with a few interesting items (e.g. - mackerel).  I haven't tried the food from the kitchen, but I hope to fix that next week. :-)  This place is small and unassuming.  The decor is nice, but not extravagant.  It's located by the theater."}
{"text":"Food was ok. I did get an upset stomach after I left there. And I did have to go to the bathroom pretty quickly after I left there. I'm not sure that it was actually from the food though. So I'm giving it two stars because maybe it was not the fault of the food who knows?"}
{"text":"This is my new \"go to\" sushi restaurant. The food is so fresh and so well presented and tastes SO GOOD that I felt like I was stealing from the place when I paid my bill.  The staff is super friendly and attentive.  Seriously love this place."}
{"text":"Jay is the man! Wherever he goes we follow!  My husband discovered Jay years ago and introduced me,  we both cannot eat sushi anywhere else as it just doesn't compare to what Jay brings to the table so we go where he goes!  By far he serves the best sushi I have ever ate anywhere, period!  It is not often when passion and talent combine, but this is Jay and it is amazing.  He always has the freshest and best tasting fish, his creations are an art, he is personally invested to make sure he creates delicious food and a great experience for all!  We love taking our guests who visit from out of state to Jay to really wow them because we always know whatever he is serving is the best.  So glad he has opened up this new spot!"}
{"text":"Good sushi, but more pricey than the usual sushi you can find around Phoenix.   Great service."}
{"text":"this place was amazing! the sushi was the best we have had outside of San Diego! service was great too, the sushi chef himself recommended sake for us based on one a group members requested. and they weren't bad suggestions at all! and the servers took good care of our table clearing efficiently and keeping our drinks full! we will definitely be back for the Crunchy Bay and Monster Roll and Spicy Tuna!"}
{"text":"I'm always looking for new sushi places to try and came across this sushi establishment in Mesa.. Let me say that is is one of the best sushi places I have had the pleasure eating at in the valley. Sushi was super fresh and a wonderful selection at a great price. they had a blue fin tuna and toro that melts in your mouth! Service was also superb!! I highly recommend this place!! I'll be back many more times in the future!! :)"}
{"text":"A friend in my neighborhood shared with our FB group and he is not one to post food pics and is a hard sell.  So I figured, I had to check it out.  Currently, they are running Grand Opening specials through May, so their Happy Hour doesn't apply at this time.    I tried 2 sushi roll (birdgang & salmon skin) a stuff jalapeños dish and calamari & jalapeños tempura.  Everything was made fresh and what needed cooking was prepared perfectly.  The place is small-medium with 10 4-person tables and a bar that seats about 6.  It's decorated and furnished nicely.  The service was very good & friendly.  Definitely will be back for more goodies."}
{"text":"I usually don't like trying new sushi places but this is right near my house, so we tried it. Sushi was way too over priced, granted we got  25% off our bill, but we didn't know that till we were paying, which was great cause I was livid that I was paying so much for a mediocre sushi that had old fish. Fresh fish has a good fish taste, old fish taste bad and too fishy. If you know what I mean. (Not a sushi chain person, have my hidden gems,hole in the wall places That are amazing)So that was a complete shame. Won't come back here."}
{"text":"To start off, the service was great! Drinks were always full, very attentive. The food was amazing. Sushi taste fresh, ordered a menu item an it was delicious and comes with rice. The teriyaki items were not overwhelming by any means. Will def be coming back here soon!"}
{"text":"Small place so didn't expect much but man their sushi are legit! Have all types of flavors and styles. I personally tried the spicy sushi called dragon ball and it just hit the spot.  Great 00's music to remind me of the past."}
{"text":"We found this place by accident and it was a pleasant surprise! We ordered the softshell crab roll, our favorite sushi roll, and tried two other rolls that are the Makitto specialty: the Superman roll and the Lay back roll. It was one of the best sushi rolls I ever had. What I like about them is the freshness, and combination of the flavors, and the creativity that were put into the food. The lay back roll was done with rice paper and spring mix. It gave the roll a unique texture but familiar flavor of the sushi roll. We also ordered the chicken teriyaki and the udon noodles. Both were exceptionally good as well. The chicken teriyaki is not dry, glazed with teriyaki sauce and together with grilled mushroom and asparagus, it is the perfect chicken teriyaki that you can't get in other places. The udon noodle was a simple dish, but it showcased the texture of the noodle. Not some soaked pile of carbs that you have at other places.  Overall, great food. Thank you Chef for giving us a perfect meal!"}
{"text":"We followed J over here from Sushi J's in Scottsdale which was our previous favorite. The quality and flavor of his sushi is by far superior to any I've had in Phoenix before. We'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Excellent udon! The staff is very friendly and attentive. The restaurant is in one of the suites connected to the Cinemark 16 theater in Mesa Riverview."}
{"text":"New date night spot! It's the best sushi in the area hands down. So delicious and the food is just beautiful. We always sit at the sushi bar so we can joke around with Chef J and look at all the different rolls as they're ordered, plus he always has some off menu sushi cuts like yellowtail and salmon Toro that are super fresh and off the charts taste-wise. The miso soup, gyoza and the \"so sexy\" roll are must orders every time my girlfriend and I go in, and then we usually get another random roll or nigiri.  If you're taking a date to cinemark or you just really love sushi, this is the best spot around."}
{"text":"I happened upon this place after an appointment in the same parking lot and was pleasantly surprised. I was planning on trying a different sushi place closer to home (further north) but I saw the sign running the opening special and did a quick search for reviews. When they were all pretty good, I decided to give it a shot and I'm glad I did. The service was great, food was fast and fresh, and it was all around a good meal. Some of the prices on special rolls seemed a bit high but after moving to Phoenix from SoCal, all of the good quality sushi places out here seem to be about 25-50% more expensive than back home. I think that's just what you have to pay for great quality sushi out here. Getting 25% off my bill for the opening special was awesome though and made it a great deal for what I got. Unfortunately the restaurant is pretty far from where I live, but I have an appointment in that parking lot every month and I already told them I'll be back next month after my appointment!"}
{"text":"I've been following the owner Jay as he's moved around the Valley for more than a decade. Everywhere he goes, he brings his well-earned reputation - fresh, high-quality fish, artfully crafted. This new location is no exception. Whether it's the simplicity of sashimi, one of the many rolls, or a new creation just for you, this is the best sushi you can get in the Valley.  Jay also has a knack for introducing people to sushi. Whether it's your first time, or you'd like to expand your horizons, let him know. He loves to make something special for everyone, and to explain the dishes, including where the fish is from and how it was prepared.   Don't be fooled by the location or size - this is the highest quality, widest variety of sushi you'll find."}
{"text":"This is one of the best sushi bars I have ever eaten at. The fish is so fresh and they have AMAZING low carb rolls."}
{"text":"This place is legit. Amazing atmosphere and sweet staff, very accommodating. The food - fresh and chilly sushi and sashimi, perfectly cut. Udon (tanuki style) fab. Now their seafood poke bowl. Lets talk about that. Unbelievable; so amazing. Cannot wait to come back and try all the variants of their poke bowls."}
{"text":"I finally tried this sushi spot after passing it over and over again. Everyone was extremely friendly and the sushi was very fresh. They also have espn playing on a nice big screen behind the bar as well as a display of the sushi they make. Definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Makitto Sushi is a small and cozy sushi restaurant that just opened in the Riverview Plaza next to the Cinemark.  Despite its size, the interior is nicely decorated and has a warm atmosphere.  The staff is friendly and is very attentive to the customers.  Jay, behind the sushi bar, has been making sushi for over 20 years. The knowledge he has of the fish and the industry definitely shows in the recipes and sushi he provides the restaurant.  The fish is fresh and is of high quality.  I also hear they will be getting specials once they are more established. This includes live ama ebi (sweet shrimp), sea bass, monk fish liver etc.  If you are a sushi fan, I highly recommend visiting this restaurant. If you can, try to get a spot at the bar and give Jay a hello! You definitely won't regret it."}
{"text":"Awesome little new sushi joint in Mesa Riverview center. Friendly staff and fantastic food."}
{"text":"Great spot for sushi in an area that needed one. This place is run by \"J\" who also ran a few sushi spots near old town but has since moved here and he's up to his old tricks of serving up some of the best sushi in AZ. It's always nice to find a great place to eat that's run by a genuinely good person that's passionate about serving the best food possible. I'd highly recommend stopping by to see J if you're looking for fresh, high quality sushi.   Side note: it's a bit tricky to find since Apple maps currently puts the location where it's not but it's located right next to the movie theatre entrance."}
{"text":"The sushi rolls were made with fresh quality ingredients; the vegetable tempura was lightly battered, crispy and not greasy at all. Service was very warm and pleasant, I believe our server is the owner himself, Jay Chung. Everything was so yummy but we wish the portions could be bigger. The portions we got are nothing like the pictures posted by others; the three different rolls we ordered were placed on ONE medium-sized plate and there were 4-5 small pieces for a roll.  .  At first we thought it was just the \"lunch portion\" but the server confirmed that this is of the regular portion. We ended up ordering one more roll so that we would not leave the restaurant still feeling hungry. :( Although there is a 15% discount during the grand opening period, we would like to pay regular prices to get a bit more food."}
