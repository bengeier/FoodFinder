{"text":"I was so happy to have this place nearby, as I've enjoyed their food cart before, but it does not translate well to a restaurant and after several tries, I will not be back. Rude service, and condescending toward food allergies and preferences. Sorry, I had hopes for you but won't be back."}
{"text":"The pizzas, peanut butter chocolate bars and key lime cheesecake are absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"Great choices, lots of filling and healthy options! Prices are reasonable and meal was served with little wait time"}
{"text":"Several of us have dietary needs.  We thought this would be perfect.  I found my Greek salad lacking, containing only one olive.  The others in my group said marginal.  We all ordered something different.  The wait was very long and the four selections arrived at four different times, making the lunch awkward.  Our bums were starting to complain after sitting on hard wooden benches.  We wondered how kids would eat here.  I'm short but the other person on my bench was tall.  Awkward eating. The bench was at an angle through the meal.  Many people crowded in and the noise level was loud.  We all decided we were into healthy eating, but probably won't return until the service is smoother and those benches are softer!  A bit pricey also."}
{"text":"My Mom and I love getting appetizers and pad thai to split for dinner. Thank you for nummy, fresh eats riggt in our neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I am thrilled to have a restaurant that supports my new dietary regime. Great food. Really good coffee (JustCoffee). Little pricey but well worth it for quality healthy food."}
{"text":"VEGANS: Do not eat here.  I found a piece of chicken in my grilled tofu strawberry salad after I specifically said I was vegan. It was most likely an accident but an accident that could have been avoided if they cared about having vegans as customers. They do not though. Kory, an employee or owner (?), of Good Food wrote this on their Facebook page:   \"I think veganism is unhealthy. We're going to offer fewer vegan options going forward. I see we'll lose some angry vegan customers. Ok.\"   This is extremely poor customer service. If you care about animals then do not eat here."}
{"text":"FODMAPs friendly, whole foods prepared with new flavor profiles that are yummy and taste delicious.  I've been eating real/whole/nutrient dense foods for decades and its not often that I come across delicious new versions of an old dish. I had the Pad Thai with zoodles, and my companion, who does not like cooked vegetables, also enjoyed the zoodles with creamy artichoke sauce.  Our food arrived quickly and the bench seating (only kind) was actually quite comfortable.   This is a good place for someone with a wheelchair to get around and serve themselves or for a family with children.  There are community tables for meeting (or ignoring) other diners and many different beverages.  I especially enjoyed their homemade iced tea.   What's FODMAPs?  Its a limited diet for people with IBS. There is a lot of research that shows some people have an inability to digest certain fruits and vegetables.  Eating them causes gastric distress.  Good Food Low Carb had several dishes to choose from that worked with my limited diet, which is pretty rare.  My only regret is that I live too far away to make it a regular drop in place!"}
{"text":"I eat here all the time because: 1) the food is great,  2) it's low carb which is a necessity for me, 3) the staff are friendly and efficient, and 4) the food is right-priced. I have had most everything on the menu. I don't have just one favorite. My favorite zoodle bowl is the bolognese, favorite flatbread is the buffalo chicken, favorite salad is the Bravo, and favorite soup is creamy tomato. Both desserts are wonderful and I usually get the berries and whipped cream to eat right away and the peanut butter chocolate bar to take home."}
{"text":"Saw the review in the Sunday paper. I was interested in giving this place a try since I've been on a low carb diet for the past month. I tried the Pad Thai salad with tofu and loved the zucchini \"noodles\". The tofu was not bland at all and the peanuts gave the salad an extra crunch. Loved how the heat snuck up on me. I was very pleased with this dish and will be back again to try their Fat Head wraps!"}
{"text":"OMG....why have I not discovered this place sooner? Finding dining for Keto diet is sometimes tricky.  This place nailed it! The stuffed mushrooms are amazeballs!  Portions are nicely sized and well worth the money.  Ordering online was easy and staff was super friendly.  Wide variety of goodies to try and cxant wait to sample the fathead recipies! Thisbis my new favorite take out spot. Extra bonus that it's on my Way home from work!!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan! Dined in once and Second time coming here for takeout. I love all of these healthy choices. You can tell the owners put love into this and are passionate about healthy eating. I'm a nursing mom trying to get back in shape and I feel good about eating out here and putting whole real foods into my body. Thank you for putting a restaurant like this in the Monona east side area! I am raving about this to all my mommy friends and will continue to. This is my go to spot. The hibiscus tea with lime is great and the zoodles are soooo good.  Don't forget the fresh berries with cream for dessert"}
{"text":"Tricky to find but excited to try their menu! Got the creamy artichoke chicken after my work out and it has 20 grams of carbs, which come from the zucchini noodles) super chill vibe, I ordered 2 dishes to go and they were done under 10 mins. They just opened up in April and hope they stay for a while. They have a great selection of wraps, salads, bowls, a little bit for everyone, my dish was $8.25 so they're reasonably priced. Could use more artichoke I only found one piece lol and a bit more chicken would be great."}
{"text":"Went out of our way specifically to eat here while in town since we are  strict keto eaters.  Wasn't disappointed!  Had the Asian meatball zoodle dish.  Very tasty.  The sauce was full of flavor, meatballs were relish and plenty of zoodles.  Proportions are as they should be for good health.  So many opportunities to run with for them to expand the menu,  I would think.   burgers, fathead pizzas, etc.  it would be awesome to se a keto restaurant go full on!  Thx for starting up, hope you thrive!"}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely amazing. We tried flatbread pizza, pad Thai made with zoodles (squash noodles), jalapeno poppers, and artichoke spinach dip. They have a great assortment of teas and sparkling waters too. You don't have to be a low-carb adherent to love this place.  If you are a low-carb person, though, this place is amazing. You're going to want to try everything. A low-carb diet has been the only one that I have effectively lost weight with and I'm very happy that a restaurant that caters to low-carb folks is around now. My wife and I will be coming back to this place quite often!"}
{"text":"It's challenging to find a restaurant with a gluten free menu that does not just consist of salad. Low carb cafe was delicious, they have a great sized menu that could satisfy any craving. I ordered the Greek flatbread, it was crispy, cheesy and fresh! I'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS AMAZING! I think I go here at least 3 times a week. The BRAVO salad is so fresh and delicious. I also love their peanut butter bar and their flatheads are amazing. Best spot for lunch and if you are gluten free! Their stuffed mushrooms are also to die for! Go here now. You'll love it"}
{"text":"A hybrid between a healthy foods place and a comfort foods place run like a cafe, so don't expect service on the customer's side of the counter. I sat around waiting for my party to arrive for 5-10 minutes, staff passed by me without acknowledgement several times.  We got the pad thai salad and the \"mac\" and cheese, what appeared to have been zucchini cut into curls and then topped with a simple, plain shredded cheddar. The pad thai salad was amazing, although we had to specifically request avocado in place of tofu or chicken, which is included in the price of the dish. Maybe just... charge extra for the added proteins so I don't have to offset the cost by asking for some other addition? I dislike paying for a dish and having it made vegetarian or vegan by having one or more items omitted from it. I don't want to pay for that animal product that got left off, and I don't like tofu, so I frequently find myself limited.  The \"mac\" and cheese was a letdown. Very bland. We were asked how we liked the dishes and gave our feedback - salad is amazing, zoodle bowl is a letdown; staff apologized and went away. Staff had no intention of remedying. I would recommend not asking about dishes if staff is not prepared to offer service past an apology, as it sounds insincere when given."}
{"text":"So happy for a healthy choice restaurant!!!  Had the pad Thai with chicken in a wrap. They have several dishes that you can get in a wrap, salad or on zoodles (zucchini noodles).  I had the cauliflower soup was delicious.  I can't wait to go back to try other items.  You order at the counter and they deliver the food. The staff is friendly and accommodating. It is clean and bathrooms are gender friendly.  Really like this place and I will be back."}
{"text":"We were quite impressed with this place...it was worth the wait.  We tried to go in two weekends ago and were a little annoyed to see the place sitting closed - luckily there was a lady outside (waiting for her friend) who told us it was amazing and worth coming back, so we planned to....and later I found out the owners had gotten married that day so I couldn't be too mad! :) We went back the next weekend, and got their Zoodle Pad Thai and 'No Mac' & Cheese - both were just simply, amazing - so tasty and I didn't feel disgusting after completely inhaling my meal!  The 'No Mac' & Cheese tasted like the real thing.  We will be going back to eat our way around the menu, for sure!  It's really nice to have a place to go that focuses on healthy options."}
{"text":"Delicious food with options for everyone. Low carb, Paleo, Vegan, vegetarian etc. I am so happy to have this in Madison! Yum!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Good Food Low Carb Cafe and I had been looking forward to it for a long time. The dining area was nicely decorated but simple.  The cashier was very friendly and cheerful. We ordered the jalapeño poppers wrapped in bacon as an appetizer. The jalapeño poppers arrived quickly.  While the menu stated six poppers wrapped in bacon we received three jalapeños cut in half and filled with cheddar cheese and wrapped in bacon.  They were not spicy as they removed all of the seeds. The bacon added a nice flavor.  For dinner my husband ordered the Pad Thai Zoodle bowl.  My husband liked it but he thought it was a bit bland so he went to the counter to get the sriracha sauce to liven it up a bit.  I told him Pad Thai is not supposed to be spicy, but he loves to doctor up any food with spicy ingredients.  I am not a big Pad Thai fan but I did taste his and I thought it was good and liked it better than the traditional version.  I ordered the Citrus Avocado Kale salad with tofu.  Yum, that sounds great!  It states on the menu that is prepared with chopped pink grapefruit and orange segments that is tossed with massaged chopped kale, mixed greens, avocado and topped with pickled red onion, crumbled feta cheese and sunflower seeds.  When my order arrived, it took me a minute to realize that it didn't appear as the menu stated.  The menu stated massaged kale with mixed greens and I was expecting a salad consisting of mostly kale and field greens mixed in.  My salad was at least 98 percent romaine lettuce with seriously maybe 4 pieces of kale leaves.  Not only that but I stirred around looking for the pickled red onion.  I found a one-inch piece of red onion but not pickled.  I went up to the counter and told the cashier that I thought I received the wrong salad as I was expecting a kale salad with field greens, not romaine.  She stated that she thought so too and she would ask the chef.  She disappeared for awhile and then was taking care of the next customer.  After a while I brought my salad to the counter.  She stated that the chef said that was the Citrus Kale Salad I ordered and she would ask the chef to add more kale and mention to the owners my concern.  I received a new salad, with the same amount of romaine lettuce and probably ten pieces of baby kale.  I did finally get my pickled red onion on top.  Avocado mostly absent with two tiny bites. To be fair she asked me if I wanted to order something else but I was so irritated at that point I just ate what I received.  My suggestion would be to show pictures of the menu items so you know what you are getting before it is served.    Maybe they ran out or were running low on ingredients for the salad?  If so, I would think they would let me know the salad was not available.  Maybe we will give them one more try but for breakfast or lunch.   Cashier/Waitress would get five stars as she was super friendly."}
{"text":"Do not stop in if you actually have to get back to work during lunch. We waited 25 minutes for our food with only three tables ahead of us.  I am updating this review because the food was really five star quality. It's just the amount of time that it took to get our food. As we were walking out, they brought the food out so we took it with us and ate it in the car on the way back. I REALLY wish I could've enjoyed it at the table because my chicken Caesar wrap was delicious.  I have since found out that they target an 8 minute order ready time and are usually in the 10 minute range. The day of my visit was just a unique confluence of events. If you want great tasting healthy eating options give them a try."}
{"text":"Wonderful addition to the east side!  As someone who tries to maintain a ketogenic diet (extra low carb) it's great to have a go to option.   They were able to provide me carb counts in everything I asked for.     So far I've tried the spinach artichoke dip and it's fathead chips and the fathead flatbread buffalo ranch chicken with blue cheese crumbles.  Both were very good and I loved the fathead chips.     It's a little spendy for me to eat at regularly and I was disappointed that the second time I wanted to eat there the oven was broken and nothing I wanted was available.  However, this has not deterred me overall and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is such a hidden gem. I try to eat one low carb meal per day and this restaurant is just what the doctor ordered! I got the pad Thai zoodle bowl! If you like peanut flavor this is a great dish to try. We indulged a bit and got the spinach artichoke dip... yum! My dining partner got the chopped salad which was chock full of goodies like bacon, avocado and blue cheese. I will definitely be back and I think I want to try their brunch on Saturdays!"}
{"text":"We stopped in on a whim and were pleasantly surprised.  It was a weekend late morning and unfortunately they were only serving their brunch menu - we both wanted to try the \"noodle\" dishes but alas they weren't available, The food was great nonetheless and we would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I've been on the ketogenic diet (less than 20g carbs per day) for 2 years now, and I've been dying to try this place.  It lived up to my expectations and more!  My food was delicious and the portion size was great as I had half leftover to take with me for later.  I had the creamy artichoke chicken zoodles and a peanut butter bar for dessert.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! If you are a low-carbor, this place is especially a gem. So many delicious options it's hard to chose. I had the beef Bolognese and the spinach artichoke dip with cauliflower bread. Yum! Had to get some desserts and a flatbread to go. Low-carbors won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"I have been grain free and following a keto/paleo diet for about a month it was awesome to find a place where I could eat everything. I did not have to take the bun off any thing or add a salad. I got the Asian meatball zoodle bowl omg delish! I hadn't eaten all day but could not finish the whole thing. I did leave room for one of their peanut butter chocolate bars... holy cow delish! I was also super happy to have sweet tea that tasted like sweet tea. I will be back again and again the prices are very reasonable for as expensive as some of the ingredient can be and the service was awesome!"}
{"text":"Not a super busy place but it should be! I loved the service, super friendly and the food was great! The price was and is more than reasonable too!"}
{"text":"If the Butternut Squash soup is any indication of how incredible the food is here I am so looking forward to coming back!! Menu selection is varied yet not overwhelming. Casual Comfortable Healthy and full of Pride in all that is served (via observation). On a side note, a clean respectful restroom is normally always a true indicator of how things are cared for in the kitchen. This place is a gem!! Thank you!"}
{"text":"First, a big thank you to the owners for expanding their food cart business into retail and revitalizing the Rolling Meadows Shopping Center.  Heritage Cafe was great and I was sad to see them go, but it was hard to give them business when they were only open until 2 or 3pm during the week.  I'm so excited to be able to come to Good Food for dinner after a long work day!  Next, what an amazing and unique selection of entrees!  I had the Asian \"Zoodles\" and it was so good it was hard to believe it was low carb!  Hubby had the Pad Thai and will definitely be getting it again.  The restaurant decor is welcoming and staff was friendly and helpful.  I was happy to see steady traffic coming in on a Tuesday night.  Despite the kitchen likely working non-stop we got our entrees in a timely manner and had no trouble getting a table.  Their brunch menu is only available on the weekend.  I look forward to returning and trying that out soon."}
{"text":"I made an account to review this. I was very impressed by the people here. They seemed to care a lot about their restaurant and that you enjoyed your meal.  I came in for their Saturday morning brunch and had an omelet and veggie hash. The omelet tastes...fresh? Is the best way I can put it. The veggie hash was killer good. Highly recommend.  But like I said, it was more the owner and the workers here who made me make an account. I wish them the best and I will continue to come here even after my low carb diet is over."}
{"text":"Having been a fan of the Good Food cart for some time, I was excited to come and dine at the newly opened cafe out on Cottage Grove road.  I took my little sister along, who in general eats low carb/little gluten, and we ordered seven or eight items one early afternoon enjoying the clean, casual and cool atmosphere of the place, having had the menu described in some detail by kind and friendly staff.  It was all pretty excellent; the creamy artichoke chicken \"zoodles\" - a zucchini/vegetable noodle - and the cheese stuffed, bacon wrapped jalapenos were especially great, and it was a nice bonus to have Madison's Just coffee available.  I look forward to trying out brunch soon... I'm sure Madison will be continually grateful for the addition of this healthy, innovative, and delicious cafe."}
{"text":"Thanks to yelp for helping us fine this gem. We are trying to watch carbs and if you are this place rocks!  Several flat bread choices, soups and unique spiralized zucchini pastas.   We got the margherita flatbread. Very tasty. Also had asian meatballs and no mac and cheese. Enjoyed both.   Ended with chocolate peanut butter bar.   Would return"}
{"text":"I was super excited for good food to come into the location.  However, across the board Good Food's menu has changed since Feb 2017, so dont expect any of your old food cart favorites.  Flavor was bland on the pad thai \"noodles\".  The thai wrap might've been ok if I hadnt tried how wonderful their old food cart menu was.  The service is very good but I didnt think the food was worth going back for."}
{"text":"Had the iced hibiscus tea and it was soooo good and refreshing on a hot day. There was a bit of a wait time, but I'm used to that after frequenting the carts for the past few years. The food is excellent and the people are always welcoming at the cart and the cafe. Great variety of food. I had the jalapeño poppers which were excellent and the Asian meatball doodle bowl which was also great.   I'll definitely be coming back. So glad they opened!"}
{"text":"This is so needed. Great low carb offerings. Can't wait to try the rest of the menu. Great service. I even saw them wipe down a high chair. I've never seen restaurants do that!"}
{"text":"Looked up healthy restaurants online and found this gem! Everything we had was amazing! We're in town for a few days and I hope to make my way back here! Delicious and guilt free!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch and it was delicious.  I had the fajitas as lettuce tacos and the flavor was fantastic!  Great options for my diabetic husband!  Very well done and so happy it is close to home.  We will be back ALOT!"}
{"text":"This place has a great vibe going and the food is incredible. We were apprehensive that the food would be boring given the name but were happily surprised. Loved the spinach artichoke dip!! Amazing! However, we got the jalapeño poppers as well and they were incredibly spicy, to the point where we couldn't even eat them. We mentioned it to the staff and they handled it wonderfully- they even asked us if we wanted a refund on them! So all in all, everything was perfect other than the jalapeño poppers. Highly recommend this restaurant, the food is very tasty!"}
{"text":"Ran across this wonderful gem of a place while driving through and m needed a healthy option. Highly recommend!!! We had the hummus plate, chicken pad Thai salad and also tried the keto fudge and key lime cheesecake which was phenomenally guilt free."}
{"text":"Asian meatballs are way too salty. Pad Thai wrap was pretty good. The chicken in it was too salty but not as bad as the Asian meatballs. This is all I've tried so far."}
{"text":"We were very excited to go here & the lack of the oven was an immediate disappointment. Because their oven is broken, they are missing the apps and flatbreads- coincidently those were the items where excited about.  I was still excited about the zoodles so I got the pad Thai.   It was ok. Lacked the strong flavor of delicious Pad Thai, the zoodle itself was good but I wouldn't recommend this if you are craving pad Thai. My boyfriend got the meatballs, they were good but cold! Maybe we'll return when the oven is fixed..."}
{"text":"Good Food comes in with big expectations from those who know it as a beloved food cart on the Capitol square. I was hopeful but realistic when we showed up on a cold and rainy evening for dinner--on their opening day.   The place was hoping with people of all ages.   The restaurant has taken the old Heritage Cafe space and made it their own, with unisex bathrooms, warm colors, and a menu that is bold and fun.  I got the Tofu Pad Thai. \"Noodles\" are actually a made from zucchini and other vegetables. They hold up well under the sauce, which had a nice amount of peanuts in it. The tofu itself was quite salty, so you will want to chop it up and mix it in with the noodles to tamp that down.  For a rotten rainy night, Good Food definitely felt warm and happy. Wait times were a bit long, but I would say that is because they had a lot more customers than you would expect on a cold and wet Monday and their first day of business.   We are looking forward to trying a weekend brunch. As it stands, this is a welcome addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Stopped with a friend who's on the keto diet. I let her pick because her dietary needs are more strict than mine. I was a little apprehensive that there'd be a ton of food I couldn't eat, because low carb usually means all the almond flour and nuts in general. I'm happy to report that while there are menu items I can't have, it's less than one would think. The staff is friendly, and getting access to the menu ingredient list was quick and painless.   The prices are really good, and while the portions are slightly small, they aren't ridiculously so.   I ordered the Creamy Artichoke Chicken over Zoodles. The chicken was amazingly flavorful and perfectly seasoned. The zoodles were ok, but needed a little more seasoning. Because they're zucchini, they also added a lot more water to the sauce than was probably intended, which may have been the contributing factor to the seasoning issue.   Overall I'll eat here again. There's a few menu items I'm still curious about. I left a little hungry still, so I may just add an appetizer."}
{"text":"When you're following a paleo or primal diet, there aren't a lot of restaurants where you can reliably stay on plan.  The transparently named Good Food Low Carb Cafe is a welcome exception.   This was my first visit, and I had the Bolognese zoodle bowl. Zoodles are noodle substitutes made from thinly sliced vegetables rather than grain.  My lunch entree was basically grain free spaghetti and meat sauce with a generous layer of melted mozzarella. It was hearty and delicious. Most of the time my mouth was convinced I was eating spaghetti and meat sauce, albeit with a bit more crunch.  The decor is spacious and relaxed, the service was good, and the wifi reliable. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Was visiting Madison and found this restaurant on yelp. So glad we dropped in for lunch.   No Mac and cheese along with Asian meatball zoodles were scrumptious. Great flavors and good size portions. Also indulged with margherita flatbread which was crispy and cheesy.   This cafe is great food favoring a healthy lifestyle. As a long time low carb believer I applaud the owners for taking a risk and opening up this gem.   Dr Atkins would be proud of you."}
{"text":"I've been doing a low carb diet and cooking for it isn't so bad but sometimes you're just lazy. I was ecstatic to find this place in Madison - - low carb food cooked and ready to go for me? Yes please!! The flatbreads are my go to because making low carb pizza at home can be a pain. They're tasty and you don't really notice it's not your \"normal crust\". I also tried the spinach artichoke dip - this was delicious. Warm, creamy, and so comforting. It comes with some veggies and bread.  But the thing that makes me come back are the low carb desserts. The cheesecake and peanut/chocolate bar is so good. Again, you don't really notice what you're eating is low in carbs because it all tastes so good!  Some other stuff - The menu at the tables have the carb count for each item. You order at the counter and they bring the food out to you."}
{"text":"I would eat here every day if I could but alas I'm a traveler. Fantastic service and delicious food. I love the low carb niche this restaurant has found. I'm saving this place to my favorites for my next trip this way. Yum!"}
{"text":"Love having the carb count on the menu and the food is delicious. Being on a keto diet I was really missing the bread and pizza but the flatbreads here are just like pizza except better! The new dessert key lime cheesecake is delicious! We've been going there regularly since they opened and have never been disappointed except when the oven broke but it's all fixed now!"}
{"text":"As keto eaters, it is incredible to be able to eat out without asking a hundred questions or having the kitchen hold this-n-that while still paying full price for your plate.  We had the wings - split order of asian and buffalo - I preferred buffalo and hubby preferred the asian. Both were delish.  He got the chicken alfredo zoodle bowl, which looked kinda small but was really plenty of food. It needed salt, but that is just fine.  I got the fajita lettuce tacos with chicken and really loved the side sauce with cilantro and the taco filling itself. Huge mess to eat, but that is how tacos and I commune.   We will likely go back when in Madison, which is a bit of a haul for us.  Oh - there are also bookshelves with several tomes on low carb eating for various reasons. Nice to flip through and learn while waiting for food.   Also, you can sit at a private table or one of the bigger community tables.  Good service, Nice atmosphere. Good food."}
{"text":"This was my first meal here and unfortunately, I was disappointed. I learned the oven was broken when I arrived and a large portion of their menu wasn't available. I wasn't able to order what I wanted but no problem, those things happen.   I ended up ordering the meatball zoodles. I thought the flavor was good but all 4 of my meatballs were cold in the middle. For a hot dish, this was really unappealing. I think it could have been a good meal if they cooked everything to temperature."}
{"text":"I had a broccoli & cheddar soup today and it was bomb. Ordered Keto BBQ pulled pork pizza (flatbread) and it was fabulous. I'm coming back with all my friends next time!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious. I am on the ketogenic diet so it's so refreshing walking into a restaurant and not having to guess if there are hidden sugars or carbs. I had the artichoke and alfredo chicken zoodles and my boyfriend had the fajita lettuce tacos. Both were very flavorful. My boyfriend also ordered the bacon wrapped jalapeño poppers. Fresh jalapeños without the breading stuffed with cheese and wrapped in bacon. Very spicy and flavorful! We each had a dessert - I had the mixed berries (lowest in sugar in fruit) with fresh whipped cream (sweetened with stevia and vanilla) and Ben had the chocolate peanut bar which tasted very much like a peanut butter  cup.  Prices were reasonable. Can't wait to go back and especially to try their breakfast menu! Hello blueberry pancakes! (Made with almond flour)"}
{"text":"I stopped in for a quick lunch after the dentist. The space is brightly painted with fun chalkboard menus. I ordered cold brew coffee and asian zoodles with chicken. The food was cooked well and had great flavor. I felt healthy eating here without any sacrifice. The prices were reasonable. The bathrooms were unisex."}
{"text":"I was excited to sample the trending zucchini noodles (zoodles) craze! I ordered the \"un Mac\" n' Cheese, and my dining mate had Bolognese on zoodles. Both bowls were tasty and of decent size. I chose to add grilled chicken to my \"un Mac\" bowl, and it was nicely cooked. The Bolgonese was a hardy meat sauce. We also sprang for one Margherita flat bread to share. The crust did not disappoint and stayed crisp. Glad we got the flat bread because the zoodle bowls didn't quite satisfy our appetite. But, they also offer many salads that could accompany a hot zoodle bowl. Yay, got in my vegetables for the day today!"}
{"text":"It was recommended to me by my hair dresser. I did online order so there are different sizes to choose from. I got a small bowl of Asian Meatballs; surprisingly delicious. I will bring my hubby there as he is looking for low carb and GF options."}
{"text":"I found this cafe completely on accident. I was trying to go to the subway nearby on the strip and saw this cafe instead. I'm familiar with Good Food because I've had their food catered before and I was extremely impressed. It was a really hot, muggy day so when I saw the low carb sign I thought this would be a good opportunity for a light lunch. I got the chicken Caesar wrap in the whole wheat tortilla. I always love a good chicken Caesar wrap and this did not disappoint. Service was really fast and friendly (at least for a late 1:30 pm lunch).  I didn't  even realize this restaurant existed so close to my neighborhood. Would definitely come back for lunch or even try some of their zoodle dishes for dinner sometime."}
{"text":"Had the pad thai with tofu and it was amazing!!! We shared the spinach artichoke appeitzer and it was tasty as well.  Will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"i eat low carb/high (good) fat & eating out can be a bit of a chore, so i was super stoked to find out about this place. it did not disappoint!  we had the spinach artichoke dip & fathead flat bread (my bf is not low carb) & it was some of the best we've had. i got the mediterranean salad with chicken & it was equally delicious. bf had the no-mac & cheese & he though it was meh, but another person in our party loved it. the sweets are also really great, the chocolate cookie cheesecake tasted like regular cheesecake. yum.   my one \"beef\" is their use of lean meats like chicken breast rather than fattier types-if they offered chicken thighs or higher fat beef or fish options, that would be heaven.  i highly recommend this place, even if you're not low carb or gluten free, the food holds its own against almost any restaurant in madison. this is going to be a go-to place for me moving forward."}
{"text":"Yum! First time trying this place was today. Ordered online for pickup. Ordering process was very easy. I got the \"No Mac\" & Cheese, with chicken and bacon. It is SO good! It's really a lot better than I thought it would be with the zoodles. Very nice healthy twist on a traditional favorite. Cheese could have been a tad creamier, but other than that, I have no complaints! I will definitely be trying more from this place!"}
{"text":"Great Hidden Gem in Madison.  Quick and flavorful healthy food at a reasonable price makes there no reason to opt the fast food route if near by. We stopped in for lunch on a weekday.  I had the Zoodle Pad Thai bowl and didn't miss the traditional noodles one bit.  Only caveat - I should have ordered an appetizer, the bowl was large but I was still a little hungry when I finished the meal.  The meatballs looks great so would have ordered those!"}
