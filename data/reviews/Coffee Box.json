{"text":"Nice coffee shop that serves alcoholic drinks as well. Comfortable environments with some relaxing coffee shop music. Good for a weekend afternoon with friends. The only entrance is thru the office building. The good about it is patrons don't get freezing cold in winter. They also serves some cakes and sandwiches here. Lots of parking underground at World on Yonge shopping mall some parking spots on ground level in the adjacent mall which is usually packed."}
{"text":"There are pros and cons about this cafe. The pro is when it is freezing rain outside, you can access from the free underground parking (the cafe is at unit 101) The ambiance is nice and cosy with bricks, wood and a rustic look. I like the lighting (my favourite filament bulb) too and selection of music.  In a way, it reminds me of a little like the Starbucks reserve. 

They also serve alcohol. The only thing is when I asked for a glass of sparkling wine ($7) they said since the bottle is not opened, I have to get two glasses. I am stubborn so even if I can drink two glasses, I ended up ordering a tea. Japanese sencha and free refills. 

My husband ordered the red velvet cake. I find it a little dry. There are signs are reads 1.5-2 hours time limit policy so even when they don't kick me out, I feel a little conscious of my time. The washroom is not inside the cafe, it's near the security area, one stall, if you can't hold, there's one on the 3rd floor. Not bad to try it out if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Finally found a new coffee place in North York that has great espresso and a good atmosphere for doing work/studying. This place is tucked away in the Shops at Yonge plaza. It's inconvenient because you have to park underground but the elevator takes you right up to the shop. This place has awesome decor and furniture and natural bright lighting. I tried their Americano and iced lemon ginger tea - both I would highly recommend. I will definitely come back to this place in the new future!"}
{"text":"Although it is a nice cafe for the uptown area but the owner blocked access to many websites since they did not want people to stay there for a long time to do their work. I have never seen such a thing  and it just doesn't make sense at all. I would choose Starbucks if I ever wanna get a coffee to go... So be mindful ;)"}
{"text":"My second time trying the latte here and it taste nothing like latte it's really bitter and cold. If I'm paying $5 for a cup of coffee I would like to be able to drink it!!"}
{"text":"Very cozy feel with rustic aesthetic. Nice friendly staff with mostly tasteful music. The drinks are very good and they offer refills for tea which is appreciated. They have a great atmosphere which caters mostly to students so it's a very chill spot. It's located in a nice plaza that has a variety of different spots to choose from. Overall, A+ coffee shop."}
{"text":"Perfect place to bring a laptop. Food is delicious, staff are friendly, wifi is super fast, and it's open late. Definitely a hidden gem!"}
