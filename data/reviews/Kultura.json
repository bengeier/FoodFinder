{"text":"Over-priced food with poor presentation. Perfect example of an egotistical owner who thinks the place is perfect and refuses to improve even after customer complaints. Their solution? Force the staff to right fake glowing reviews. Pathetic. Avoid at all costs. They won't be around for long anyway."}
{"text":"Mixed drinks are a bit pricey but I find the wine to be comparable to other places around the city.   A great menu to choose from with a lot of creativity and taste."}
{"text":"I tried Kultura's Summerlicious dinner menu for $35:

Grilled Calamari was standard with nicoise olives and tomatoes.
Mushroom Oricchiete was overly salty, needed pepper and was oily at the bottom of the bowl, where the flavour profile changed a bit.
Lemon Vanilla Panna Cotta was ok.

Service was pleasant (demeanour), but distracted and forgetful. 

Probably will only come back for open mic upstairs, which was fun!"}
{"text":"DO NOT BELIEVE THE HYPE; Kultura is all smoke and mirrors with NO culinary substance to speak of. It tries too hard to provide upscale service as a way to mask their ultimately mediocre, and sometimes downright bad, food. 

PRICE:
- For what you actually get in taste and finesse, it's highway robbery. 
- For the prices that you're paying (average $17 per appetizer) you should not have to feel like they are butchering the ingredients. 
- Only saving grace is that their wine by the glass selection (around $12) was quite good. 

SERVICE:
- The service was fine. The host was helpful as was the waitress and the runners who described the dish to you. No one was snotty and overall it was alright.
- Only problem I had was I couldn't understand the bridging between the type of service they're trying to provide with the type of food they're sending out. They had their staff explain the dishes to you in an attempt at fine dining but from the moment you put any of it in your mouth it's such a complete disappointment that service without a description would have been less insulting. 

AMBIANCE/CROWD:
- There are three areas to the restaurant. The main floor section where it's more quiet and more conducive to one on one gatherings. 
- The second floor is divided into two areas. The front area that matched the downstairs area quite well but the back room area was reminiscent of what a mafia team would have put together. Brick walls, high ceilings, dark colours, bar on one side and an overall I-had-to-go-through-a-small-back-street,-through-three-back-doors-and-a-kitchen-to-get-into-this-secret-operation kind of place. 
- Crowd: like as if Woodbridge exploded everywhere and was the new colour of the season. (No offense to anyone from Woodbridge). People were around mid-late twenties with too much attitude but no substance to back it up with. A lot of pretension: cold stares, uptilted chins, big hair, men's arms draped on backs of sofas. 
- The majority had definitely gum-smacked their way down from the 905.

FOOD:
***WHERE DO I EVEN START TO DESCRIBE THE CATACLYSMIC CULINARY CATASTROPHE THAT IS KULTURA?!?!***
- First of all they describe themselves as a tapas style restaurant. Okay seems appealing and like a nice idea but WHAT A FAILURE it really is.
- Sun dried tomato naan ($10) was chewy and tough in ways that a flaky and airy naan bread should NOT be. 
- Ahi Tuna Cornets ($14). One would think for something raw they wouldn't be able to mess it up. Think again. They smother the tuna in so much sauce that any taste of the fish is gone. Whatever happened to respecting the ingredients? Not to mention that the tuna was chopped so tiny that mixed in the sauce you wouldn't even know you had a protein in there. And then the bloody cornets that they're in?!?! I understand what they're trying to do is play with the idea of contrasting flavours; to juxtapose an ingredient with it's opposite as to bring out the best in both...but it just wasn't executed well at all. The hardness of the cornet shell with the texturally soft but overpowering flavour of the tuna/sauce was jarring. 
- Beef carpaccio. One of my favourite dishes...but NOT from here. It's raw. It should be a no brainer but apparently not. First of all, it came THICK and just slightly pink in the centre so obviously it was cut from a piece of meat that has been sitting around for a while and not actually raw. Good carpaccio should be so thin that it cooks itself at room temperature. Apparently our cow had sunbathed quite a bit before going on the plate. VERY big disappointment. 
- Seared scallops ($18). Three pieces. Saving grace is that the size was good and it was cooked well. Not raw. Not overcooked. Just right. Unfortunately, once again they try to do just too darn much and smothered the scallops in overpowering herbs and sauces. Rather than bringing out the flavour of the scallop, it completely masked it. 
- Sesame Oil Hamachi ($14). Same old Kultura story. Too much going on. Hamachi is a beautiful fish with a very distinct flavour that is completely masked and butchered here.
- Sushi pizza ($13). In my opinion, sushi pizza is not something that can be done easily. It runs the easy risk of being overcooked. At least Kultura hit the mark on that one. Kultura over-fries the rice so that it's so crunchy that it gets stuck in your teeth and is pretty much inedible. If you need a tooth pulled, come to Kultura: their sushi pizza is bound to pull out a few for you and then some. 

BOTTOM LINE: Kultura tries to be something it's not. It's not exciting. It's not new. It's not fine dining. It tries to be with it's decor and service (a la dish description) but it falls so short in its culinary skills that you're better off going somewhere else...like Canoe or Pangaea where service matches food. THAT'S fine dining. Not Kultura."}
{"text":"Number one reason to visit Kultura: the mushroom orechiette. Roger Mooking proves his genius as a celebrity chef with this addictive dish. It's simple really: tiny pasta in a mushroom sauce, mixed just before serving with a mild cheese that melts into ooey-gooey goodness.  

On the night that I dined here,  Kultura must have been having an off night. It was mostly empty even though the DJ was playing music that just begged to be danced to. It seems to be a great place for drinks, dancing and lounging, but on this night the people were just not there. 

No matter to me, as long as the mushroom orechiette is on the menu, I'll keep coming back."}
{"text":"I love Kultura because their food is just like how I like to cook at home. I like foods from all walks of life and I'll cook in any style depending on what ingredients I have on hand... Maybe I'll make jerk chicken tacos or Indian curry sitr fried udon...OK... on second thought, maybe I should just go to Kultura.

I won't label Kultura as Asian Fusion or anything like that because their food is basically influenced by every continent in the world. I can see how less adventurous eaters wouldn't like this place because the flavour profile changes so dramatically between dishes. If experimenting with your palate isn't your game, then stick with the meat and potatoes because Kultura ain't for you.

If you're still reading this review, then you're going to like Kultura. There are Caribbean, Indian, Japanese, Thai, Chinese, Italian, and even French influences visible throughout all the dishes. Park your traditional expectations of what these food styles should taste like at the door and you won't be disappointed..."}
{"text":"Always nice to visit a tapas-style restaurant because it satisfies the ADD-addled side of my palate. The menu on this place seems a bit confused, though. Fusion is one thing, but here it wasn't so much fusion as a pervasive sense of \"let's throw this in, why not!\" 

There are a few items that are best avoided. The sushi pizza was tough and one-dimensional, texture-wise. I wouldn't order the naan again, as almost any Gerrard Street hole would do it better. Same with the chicken samosas, which felt like they were partly filled with warm sand.

On the other hand, the mushroom orecchiette was superb, full of dusky flavour inside the not overly melty pasta. The cod and seabass were also done perfectly. 

I would go there again, simply because the environment is very nice (clean lines and earthy textures everywhere), but I do wish they'd tweak the menu a bit, and also expand it, since if you go there with a few people (as you should in a tapas style place), you'll end up with very few actual choices to make in the end."}
{"text":"I pass by this place all the time and never stepped foot in because it always looked so quiet, but I finally decided to give it a try and I'm glad I did. The reason it looks so quiet from street level is because it's actually a tri-level restaurant, so I suppose the diners are spread out. The tapas style plates are great, the nan bread, samosas, cod, ribs, you name it - it's all good! It's now one of my favourite places to go, you too will be delighted."}
{"text":"Don't come hungry. Word to the wise. 

When I come to an establishment like this (high end, mature, classy) I don't mind paying a premium price for premium food and service. I ended up paying a premium price for mediocre (at best) food. There is no excuse to charge patrons entree prices for bite-sized tapas. To add insult to injury, the service was meh. We had a large party that night with 12 people so we expected to wait a little bit for the food to come out. It took almost an hour until the last person was served! The dishes also come out as they are prepared so half the table received and ate all their food before the other half even received theirs. It makes for a really awkward dining situation. 

I ordered foie gras pulled pork tacos ($16), Mediterranean naan ($9) and vanilla fries ($6). The only thing I enjoyed was the fries. You couldn't even taste the foie gras in the tacos amid the thick filling of guacamole and creme fraiche. The pulled pork was also extremely dry and tasteless. So disappointed. Naan is also supposed to be soft and pillowy but the one served was hard and dense. The food here needs a little refinement considering it is fine dining. 

Overall, I think you should save your money and go elsewhere. There are plenty other restaurants with the same ambiance with much better food and value."}
{"text":"Nice people but the worst service for everything. The one waitress for the whole restaurant took about 20mins to get to the table to take our order then she disappeared. The appetizers are so small and over priced for what you receive. The drinks are good and strong but you have to wait for another 20mins after you order to receive them.  Do not get me started on the hookah....they have no idea what they are doing and I am a newbie to smoking the pipe and I knew it was not right. No atmosphere and for a Friday night it was empty.   This place needs help."}
{"text":"I tried their Summerlicious lunch prix fixe menu, and might I just say that it was an unforgettably terrible food experience. I say food experience because the ambiance was fantastic, and the service was great (hence two stars instead of one), but the food was simply terrible.

The strawberry gazpacho appetizer I got was very confused about what it wanted to taste like, a strange mix of strawberry, tomato, with a hint of mint and some spices. I chalked that up to the fact that for me it would be an acquired taste and I would pass on it in the future. The french hen main course that I got was a good size (something I can't say for what my boyfriend got since his Atlantic char was tiny, it was the size of a biscuit). It was even very tender. The problem was that the entire portion of chicken that I got, which came in a small clay pot, was swimming in butter. As in, the pot was filled to the brim with melted butter, and that was the only distinct flavour that I could get from the chicken. The dessert that I got was infinitely forgettable. The best part of the meal was probably the tiny piece of chocolate that came with my gelato dessert.

With the sheer number of Summerlicious options available to you, I'd suggest saving your money for another restaurant."}
{"text":"When perusing this year's Summerlicious offerings, my boyfriend and I both came to common ground with Kultura. We got a nice table on the second floor in the back and were able to admire the lovely interiors. Our server was attentive, helpful and informative and definitely added value to the experience. 

Given that it's ultimately a tapas bar, we ended up leaving a touch on the hungry side. However we did enjoy our meal and savoured the various flavours in the dishes we were presented with. I would most likely go back with some friends for post-dinner drinks and to satisfy a non-pub snack craving, and to return to a part of town I rarely venture into."}
{"text":"My boyfriend bought the groupon for 69 dollars and we went to this place before it expires. I like the Champagne and mango saketini that i ordered, but i hate my beef tartar...the scollops is good, but has some sand in it; I like my hen, but there is no sauce, so the meat is not tasteful enough and the dessert is tooooooo sweet.

I dont like the environment,  it's so old and the table we sit next to is not stable. The waitress that served us is probably new and always forgot to fill our water.

The price is not cheap even with groupon, coz of the wine and cocktail we ordered. I think there is a lot of space they can improve on."}
{"text":"No expectations going in. 

My Fiancee made Summerlicious reservations for this popular place.

The place is too cool there are no address posted or restaurant sign. The sign in front is just black. lol 

We were seated near the middle of second level of this three level restauarant. It was kind of loud where we were initially seated and asked to move. Our server then seated us at a nice table by the far end in the skylit room also on the second level. Ah what a releif I don't need to scream into my fiancee ear plus I can see my food thanks to the skylight. :)

For Summerlicious there's a set menu:

For me I ordered the app Sushi Pizza, main Sea Bass, and  dessert Doughnuts
She had the app Samosas, main Steak, and dessert Flourless Chocolate Cake

Each item was introduced by the server, they described it's preparation and ingredients used. The presentation was great! Most importantly the dishes tastes were distinct and flavourful.

I enjoyed what we had, we shared. In the future will definately have this place in mind when visiting the St. Lawrence area.

Note: Be aware your experience can vary depending on where you sit."}
{"text":"I highly recommend this restaurant if you are looking for a cool tapas style dining experience. The wine list is great and the menu size is such that if you go with enough people you might be able to order everything off the menu. We did last time we were there and it was great to try so many great dishes. The space is very cool with urban lofty feel. It's the kind of restaurant decor that would make for a very cool living space."}
{"text":"You know what they say - a woman hides her inner ugliness behind a wall of make-up.....well Kultura hides its lack of \"coolness\" behind a wonderfully designed website and overpriced, watered down martinis....how un-cool is that!

I just have to say all in all Kultura is not worthy of  anymore ink."}
{"text":"Toronto, I'm really warming up to the quality of the food you have!!  Kultura has all the elements that I like in a restaurant - to start it is a beautiful two level space, high ceilings, beautiful backdrop, furniture and layout.  We went for Winterlicious and I was impressed with the service and the food.

So on to the food - it's the food that I aspire to cooking - combining the yummiest elements of different cultures and pushing food forward.  To start we had the truffled Naan bread and chicken samosa with a really yummy sauce.  

The main was the best fusion combination for a flat iron steak I've ever had - miso flavoured with butternut squash musturda, okra tempura and honey glazed rutabaga.  I was blown away by the creativity and how all the flavours really worked.  As for the steak quality we both agreed that it was way too chewy (not in a good way) so probably not the best cut.  (Niagara Street cafe wins for my fav aged flat iron steak)

The dessert was also so creative - espresso brule with white chocolate cream (didnt look like a creme brulee at all but tasted delicious) and an chocolate torte with apple cider ice cream (i devoured the ice cream, but the chocolate cake was way too thick for my liking)

For $35, this was well worth it!  I have my qualms about $9 coors light and $12 house wines at the bar but maybe this is just a toronto price I have to accept. 

I'm definitely going to come back to try the Orecchiette and other things on their menu."}
{"text":"Dear Kultura,

Let me explain how a Groupon works. You give customers a nice meal on a discount. If they like it, then they will come back. If you give them a shitty meal (bad food, terrible service) then no one will come back. Ever. We will tell all our friends about how bad it is. We will write Yelp reviews. We will completely ruin your restaurant. 

We are not being unreasonable. Let me explain. Kultura looks fine. The decor is nice. The music is bad. No one wants to listen LMFAO yell \"I work out!\" while eating. 

When you put something on your menu as tuna carpaccio, I do not want four tiny pieces of tuna buried under a pile of over-salted arugula. I want tuna carpaccio. 

When you serve us four oysters, please make sure these oysters are bigger than my thumbnail. 

When you serve scallops, do not over cook one, under cook the other, and have all of them full of sand. 

When you serve 'donut holes,' make sure they are better than Timbits. 

And please speak to your waiters about their attitude. I get that they've probably gotten a lot of flak because of the 'special' Groupon tasting menu, but this is no excuse for giving us such terrible service simply because they are guaranteed gratuity on the final bill. I was appalled that one waiter patronizingly offered to 'explain' the Groupon to me (No, let me explain the Groupon to you). 

Kultura must be avoided at all costs. Even as I type this, creeping waves of nausea wash over me. You have been warned.

Kultura, this is my letter to you. Stay Klassy."}
{"text":"Great service, delicious food, fabulous atmosphere... doesn't get better than this. Went here with my girlfriend for her farewell dinner and we had the best time! Had a variety of dishes from scallop appetizer to lamb loins, everything was cooked to perfection. Love the idea that everything is meant to be shared, so you get to try 4 -5 different dishes per meal. The chef was able to integrate Asian spices and ingredients beautifully with western cuisine. Bravo!"}
{"text":"I purhcased a groupon for Kultura's tasting menu.  The restaurant is 2 levels and we were seated on the main level.  I wasn't a fan of the atmosphere -- the music was too loud for a restaurant (and on a tuesday evening at 7pm no less).  Decorations were nothing to write home about.

I ordered the beef tartar springroll -- beef was a little chewy and the texture of the springroll was too hard.  Then I had the seared scallops -- upon eating them, I thought it seemed a little fishy; I guess it was not that fresh.  My boyfriend had the Malbec oysters, he also noted it was a bit fishy.   

The rest of the dinner was better.  I had the cornish hen with mango/tomato salsa and my boyfriend had the black cod.  For dessert, I had the chocolate lava cake and he had the lemongrass creme brulee.

However when I got home, I got violently sick!!  I am pretty sure it was the scallops.  

STAY AWAY!!"}
{"text":"Kultura is one of those places that remind you why Toronto is so fabulous. The ambience is remarkable with 3 floors of seating. We sat on the top floor which has 4 long tables for guests. We were a party of 8 and it was perfect seating. I must say we tried the majority of the Menu and every time a new dish came out, I swear it was my favourite. I wish I could recommend one favourite dish but it's in your best interest to try ALL!

The service was outstanding. Every server was friendly, and charismatic. We had a late dinner which usually means we get a server that's running out of steam but these guys were pros. Very efficient and on top of everything. 

If you are looking for a place for a good night out on a Saturday night without the disco music drowning out the conversation, I highly suggest going to Kultura.. I would also suggest stretchy pants. You're gonna need em."}
{"text":"I'll bump the stars to four since the service was excellent and fun. The decor is hip and romantic - bring a date here.

The food was delicious but the portions were meager. Yeah, I know it's tapas style but the prices should be toned down then. Each of us paid $70 and we were still hungry after we ate.

I would go back but would sit at the bar and get a couple of dishes for a snack. I recommend the Samosas, Black Cod, and Jerk Pork.

FYI - the menu on their web site is outdated."}
{"text":"This places shouts \"girls night out!\"- electronic music plays, it has an (overpriced) wine and cocktail menu, the food menu consists of lots of visually pleasing, international fusion-based small sharing plates, the space and decor are pretty and trendy seeming (but not \"cool\" at all) and unsurprisingly, the couple of times I've been here have been with lady friends of mine. I will speak of my latest experience as my first one was a while ago at this point. 

My dining partner and I arrived and sat right near the front. After deliberating for a while with the drink list, we each ordered a glass of pinotage (a polarizing South African offering- both of us have parents from SA so it was a deliberate choice). It was absolutely delicious. Even though it was pricey, we each ordered another glass because we enjoyed it so much. \"Dark and juicy with plenty of rich damson and baked plums, a hint of coffee on the nose and soft tannins.\" - definitely juicy and just so tasty!

We ordered the following dishes as nibbles to accompany our drinks:

Palak Paneer Naan Truffle Oil, Jalapeño, Peppered Honey           

Seared Scallops Thai Asparagus, Baby Shitake Mushroom, Fresh Bean Sprouts, Tagarashi  

Tofu and Vegetable Thai Curry  Green Curry, Broccoli, Red Pepper, Cauliflower, Shredded Coconut, Shitake Mushroom, Almonds

They were all quite delicious, with the scallops ranking as the least exciting (though still tasty) and the paneer naan being the dish that I wanted to scarf down the most (come on, paneer and naan fused together?! heaven). The reason I have given Kultura 3 stars despite speaking quite highly of the food is that it is overpriced, the atmosphere is a bit cheesy or something (the space IS beautiful though) and I found the service to be just OK both times I've been there."}
{"text":"How many smart people does it take to split a bill??? Well when the bill is muy expensivo and people start ordering bottles of wine that are barely enough to fill everyone's glass it gets expensive. Even without the extras it's an expensive restaurant though - tapas style always is. The macaroni and cheese - sooo good. The cheese was really great and the small pieces of bacon added really good, juicy flavor. The Chilean Seabass was pretty good too. I hate brussel sprouts but they were cooked together with everything and you could barely taste it - two thumbs up. I can't remember what made the sauce part sweet underneath the fish but it was a bit too much for my liking. I can't speak for anyone elses food but I don't think anything went to waste.

Overall my suggestion is to not go hungry otherwise you'll surely be spending an arm and a leg to fill up. I could have had another meal afterwards but instead I went to sweat it out at the club!"}
{"text":"I have been meaning to review this place since November just to tell you one very important thing - mushroom orechiette."}
{"text":"Kultura has been around for awhile and you come to be seen and heard as opposed to for good eats.  The food is pretty medicore and the staff don't know up from down as they run around in a disoriented mess.  Mariko M. summed it up best when she said that she found the food to be very 'meh.'

It's more of a place that I'd come to grab a drink and maybe some casual nibbles, but definitely not a dinner spot.  I have been her twice (once for a private cocktail party and the second time to preview their summer menu and hookah lounge).  

As with most resto-lounges the food is mediocre.  The yummy things I have tasted here however are:

Korean Short Ribs with Mushroom Arancini Ball (weird combo but good)
Heirloom Beet Salad with Gorgonzola Cheese Ball (savory + sweet done right)

It's definitely not a place I'd dine at again, especially when Origin is just a few doors down and if you're super lazy, Hiro Sushi is just next door."}
{"text":"my friends and i went to Kultura's winterlicious to celebrate my friend's birthday. I didn't like how they asked for a CC number when we're just making reservations, it makes customers nervous and unsure if they really want to eat there. 

service: my waitress (sadly did not get her name) was very polite and thanked us for coming to celebrate my friends birthday ( i never had a server that thanked me). They offered a free dessert to the bday girl besides the dessert that came with the prix fix but there were no other dessert selections besides the winterlicious desserts. When it got busy the service slowed down, if its during winterlicious then wouldn't you hire more ppl? i didn't like having finished plates infront of me for 15mins after each course.

decor/ atmosphere: i loved the decor and ambiance. it was really nice and i was so glad that they weren't blasting out music and having everyone shout across the table.

food: appetizers: the Dungeness Crab Naan had a huge portion compared to the others, but overall the apps were nothing special. however, i did like the Chai Tea Glaze that came with the chicken samosas. IMO the sea bass was the best entree, it was so juicy and buttery. The flank steak was cooked medium rare, and they didn't even ask my friend how she wanted it. There were high reviews for the Mushroom Orecchiette but my friends said that it could've been better. I wasn't too excited about the dessert selection, no one ordered the doughnuts because we read that tim hortants made better timbits so we ordered the cheesecake and creme brulee. The cheesecake tasted like pure butter. The creme brulee tasted different..maybe because it was almond flavor? i just couldn't put my finger on it. 

overall, the experience was good."}
{"text":"Summerlicious fail. From the gawdy decor and the pounding midday music to the disorganized and painfuly slow service, Kultura's club vibe is more akin to a bar than an upscale restaurant charging $20/head for a Summerlicious lunch. My appetizer was a strawberry gazpacho with a soggy donought in the middle. I had a sip and set it aside. Gazpacho should not taste like a berry smoothie. My main dish, the arctic char, was decent but very bland. The \"side of vegetables\" consisted of a couple of cherry tomatoes and a few strips of sauteed bell pepper. We didn't have time for dessert after our 1.5-hour lunch which consisted of only one appetizer and one main dish so we asked for our pannacotta to go. They said OK and then brought it out to us on plates! Helllooo! I think they were serving in their sleep. To top it off, there were 3 servers working together one our ONE table - how difficult can it be?! I was utterly disappointed and embarassed that I brought guests here from out of town to experience the wonders of Summerlicious restaurants in Toronto."}
{"text":"It's hard to know what Kultura is like without a Groupon running, but my experience early this month was one of the most painful experiences I've had in a long time. 

My wife and I showed up at 7pm for our reservation.  Our drink orders were promptly taken and served, but then the wheels went off the bus.   After ordering our 4 course prix fixe, we proceeded to wait an hour for each course.  The most challenging part was that our respective dishes arrived at different times, so instead of us enjoying our own 4 course meals, we had to endure an 8-eight course tapas dinner!  Thankfully, we didn't fight over the food!  

The restaurant staff did an admirable job trying to serve us.  They explained that the kitchen was new and running way behind and offered us lots of free drinks.  Sadly, I'm not a huge drinker, so after a free cocktail and two glasses of wine, I just wanted my food. 

Honestly, it was hard to assess the food.  It came out in dribs and drabs.  Most dishes were passable, but nothing remarkable.  

The most frustrating part of the whole experience was watching the restaurant owner entertain friends and then host a wine agent, while his servers were being attacked by angry patrons.  

Until they get their act together (maybe give the kitchen staff a month or two), I would avoid!"}
{"text":"Asia is large as you may know and thus Asian Fusion really isn't descriptive enough for Kultura.  It's predominantly a Japanese/Indian mix, a different spin than most Eastern compounding.  

Per a another consultant friend's recommendation we headed to King Street to the barely marked front of urban loft/modern nature aesthetic Kultura.  

Again, Toronto astounds me with very light crowds on Wednesdays.  Peak time it wasn't too busy, just a few sizable groups.  Hell, I don't mind, I'm taking advantage of this week day paradox.  

The cocktails were decently crafted, my Sazerac nicely done though weak on size for price; more like a shot.  As to the food, it was the smaller portion, good exection style, which worked out fine.  For four we ordered edamame, mushroom orecchiette, chicken samosas X2, naan, lamb loin, beef tenderloin, and gnocchi with a flourless chocolate deal to finish along with some port.  

The indian spiced ground chicken in the samosas was probably my favorite flavor, second to the beef tenderloin.  The flourless chocolate deal was a bit different than expected with a smaller chocolate dollop than expected and larger accessories."}
{"text":"It was an exciting dinner experience, as I was curious as to how the dishes I ordered would turn out. It is tapas style, so the dishes are smaller and meant for sharing.

Ordered:
Mushroom orecchiette - a MUST order. The creaminess and flavour was so good. The mushrooms were delicious. 

Panak Paneer Naan - One of their more popular naan bread. It was also delicious. The truffle oil really made it stand out.

Seared Scallop - Served 3 scallops. I didn't find this dish too exciting. The coconut made it a bit weird for scallops.

Twice cooked beef short ribs - Twice too salty! Really, the saltiness masked everything else.

Overall, I would come back to try out the other diff. dishes."}
{"text":"If you like...

$20 dollar martinis that taste like regular martinis
Forgettable food that tries too hard
Hit and miss service staff
Hipster pretensions

then Kultura is for you. 

A beautiful space which sorely lacks substance; disappointing and barely mediocre."}
{"text":"Very trendy restaurant with great food.  Good spot to go on a date or to have a nice group dinner before going out on the town.  Servers are very friendly and accommodating, food is expensive but tasty (small portions, though).  You're paying for the overall experience and that's why I'm going to say that Kultura is worth it.  The decor is very sexy and the place just exudes a chic vibe.  Try it if you haven't yet."}
{"text":"I can't put a finger on exactly what it is that left me unimpressed about Kultura, but it felt lacking. The food was good but not memorable and the restaurant itself was trendy but felt a little uncool, as evidenced by the lack of other patrons around us.

I think it was perhaps the contemporary setting and decor that felt a little cold and unsettling, and perhaps out of place in its King East location. 

If you're in the area, do not go so far as to avoid it, but it's not exactly a destination dining experience."}
{"text":"We had dinner at Kultura last week.

I had gotten a coupon through Dealicious and thought it would be good to partake (being that others had recommended it).

Things to know:
- not your standard menu but \"small\" plates meant for sharing
- has tables upstairs and down -- upstairs is warmer in the winter time-
- a bit on the expensive side, but the food is well worth it
- great modern ambiance
- street parking or lot parking nearby

Plates I would recommend:
- warm octopus salad
- beef short ribs
- ahi tuna tacos

We also had the hamachi, the naan bread and the donut holes with caramel and chocolate sauce to end.  Some of the food had chili or jalapeno oil  -- so a bit of a kick -- but very good!

Service was good.
They had a reasonable selection of wines by the glass.  Bottles were a little on the pricey side.

Still -- I would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"So where should I begin?  I went to Kultura on Valentines Day as my girlfriend had been wanting to try it.  Upon arrival we were impressed with the warm decor, comfortable seats and relaxed atmosphere - then the food came.
I had the beef tartar in my first course - trusting the fact that they understand that this must be fresh to ensure safety.  I only had a little as my initial impression was that it was not infact fresh. 
Next was the Tandoor Beef - terrible.  Looked like it had been steamed (to me tandoor is not only an indian flavour but cooked in a tandoor oven.  It looked pasty and only had a mild indian flavour and no browning whatsoever.  It was also lukewarm on a bed of cold noodles. 
My third course was the Coq au vin - this was the only dish that felt close to being freshly prepared but the chicken was very dry and doused in sauce to cover this up.  Not great but better than everything else by that point.
Finally, dessert - strawberry something or other - was very good but could not have made up for what was to come.
What was to come was the most vicious bout of food poisoning I have ever encountered in my life.  I can't be sure what it was (most likely the tartar) but the worst part about it was that my \"inner voice\" was telling me not to eat any of this \"food\" while it was being put in front of me but I did it anyways!  I take part of the blame for this nightmare - go with your inner voice - its smarter than you.
To top it off, I was proudly presented with a bill of $170 (tapas for two plus one (1) glass of wine each) - *no prices were on the menu*  SURPRISE!!! (again my fault - could've asked - but why do they not just disclose it?)
So here I am two days later, $200 lighter in my pocket, here to tell you not to bother.  Beyond their issues with bacterial control - a lot of money for \"pretty little dishes\" that have little substance and a lot of price.

STEER CLEAR!"}

{"text":"Came here for Kultura's Winterlicious Menu. Was totally expecting an amazing overall experience due to the pouring of rave reviews. 

What I ordered:
- Mediterranean Chicken Samosa w/ Asiago, Sage, Spiced Apple Gari Chutney on the side
- Mushroom Orecchiette
Malivoire Pinot Noir Pear Chutney, Aged Cheddar
- Espresso Brule
White Chocolate cream, Chocolate Malt Crumble butterscotch

I found the food to be very 'meh' and the dessert to be an 'eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeek me thinks not.' For the prices that this place charges, the food should be much better. I didn't get any wonderful explanation of how the food was prepared as some Yelpers experienced.

It can't be all that bad... the decor was nice. It's multi-floored here so I thought that was cool. Where it's situated (King and Jarvis) is really a chic area too.

{"text":"I recently hosted my 27th birthday dinner at Kultura and was very impressed with the care and attention I received for my ~15 guests throughout the evening. The staff was super-accommodating, even as I changed the reservation a few times beforehand.
 
My guests really enjoyed themselves, enjoyed the food and did not feel rushed, which made the event very memorable. The food arrived very quickly and we were really pleased with everything. All in all, a great experience for my first time at Kultura - I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Just had the winterlicious menu at kultura.   This place never stops surprising me. Most supperclubs either fail to be a good club or serve mediocre overly contrived food. Kultura can serve something as simple as steak and fingerling potatoes and leave you drooling like an idiot. If you've never bothered to order dinner after showing up for drinks do it."}
{"text":"I had lunch at Kultura last week with a friend.  We shared three of their sharing plates - the sliders, the mushroom orecchiette and the black cod.  The sliders were very good, the mushroom orecchiette was to die for and the black cod was too salty even for me (and I love salt).  I would go back just for the mushroom orecchiette alone.  I have been dreaming of this dish ever since Friday."}
{"text":"EXPENSIVE. Delicious, but expensive.
A small menu of sharing dishes that range from $6 to $25. Don't assume that if it's a $25 dish, it must be an entree, because the sizes are all pretty small, and you will have to order 2-3 dishes per person to feel full, regardless the price of each dish. 

We had the:
- Palak Paneer Nan (truffle oil, jalapeno, peppered honey): The flavourful bursts in your mouth but a bit too sweet
- Baby octopus tampura: a bit more bland than i expected
- Chicken gnocchi: The chicken is fried and really tasty, felt like a fried pork chop, and the gnocchis are tiny, but very flavourful. Also a bit too sweet.
- Twice cooked short ribs: Really good and tender.
- Miso black cod: my favourite dish of the night. The fish was fried perfectly and the potatoes were delicious.

The bill came out to be over $85 without drinks or tips for two people even though the food wasn't filling. We probably could have used two more dishes. 

Overall, I think there were too much fried food and most of the food was a little too sweet. The atmosphere and decor is extremely romantic though, so it's a great place to have an expensive date. Honestly, I don't think quality and quantity of food matches the price, but I do love how flavourful all their dishes are."}
{"text":"Love it. A great night with a group of friends who want to sample and share a bunch of unique, tasty tapas plates."}
{"text":"great carpaccio,the waiter refused to serve us nan first, please teach him that nan is bread, and many of us like to eat it with food, good,friendly manager, rushed yet slow service , we enjoyed the food and ahi tuna is a must,Meal for two, one glass of wine,one dessert 116 tax included"}
{"text":"We came here on a Tuesday night after work. Place was almost empty. We had not made reservations, and the staff made it clear that we should have. Found one girl in particular to be sort of rude and snotty. After making us wait a few minutes to find a table at the almost emtpy restaurant, she seated us.
Food was good, but very expensive. Might be worth it if you go with a large group of people so you can share and order more. The naan appetizer was delicious. The tandoori shrimp was also good. Way too overpriced though, probably would not return."}
{"text":"Rating: 3.5/5

Kultura is a very sophisticated and upscale restaurant that has 3 floors and seats about 200 people according to their website. This restaurant is somewhere you would bring a date or have a group dinner at. There weren't many people having dinner on a Saturday night when a group of 10 of us arrived last night.

The service was great all night and the food didn't take that long to come out. The server was super because he gave us drinks on the house and even took pictures for us. There wasn't much of a selection of food to choose from and it's a bit pricey. A bottle of wine would run you about $50. But what do you expect? Kultura is a fine dining restaurant so it's expected. I ended up getting the pearl barley risotto and shared the chicken samosas with a friend.

I didn't really like the pearl barley risotto because it was too rich in flavouring for me. The chicken samosas were alright...nothing special though.

The service was great but the lack of food options didn't satisfy me."}
