{"text":"Such a cute little vegan spot! The girls were very accommodating & helped me find something to eat with my insane list of food allergies. The atmosphere is so calming & beautiful. Highly recommended to any vegans visiting the area!!!!"}
{"text":"FINALLY A HEALTHY PLACE TO EAT!!!!!! I tried this new eatery this morning and ordered a scrammbled spiced tofu on toast (the Bhurji) and it was delicious! All the food is super clean and wholesome, such a wonderful change to the greasy low quality food options in Calgary. I also got a hot elixir with honey and turmeric which was amazingly tasty and warmed me up. The price is not bad for the great food you get. Plus the lady running the counter is super friendly and happily talked to me while she made my breakfast.  I highly recommend this place for quick healthy eating!"}
{"text":"My mom in law brought me in here and really it was the best place I have visited in Calgary for a long time. I know it just opened up but just the fact it caters to vegans makes me happy. The 2 girls in there running this place are very sweet and I do hope that this place gets what it deserves.  I enjoyed my burrito so much, that I came by just to grab food for the road trip back. And the fact I brought non-vegans in here and they actually liked it made me happy.  The menu albeit not so big was enough to please anyone. Keep an open mind... stroll on in and try. it will make your belly feel good and support local business. And they supply games to play with! keeps kids busy while you eat and what parent doesn't want that."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The food was so good. I had the tacos on their new Spring menu. The service was friendly. Very comfortable environment. My food didn't take long to prepare at all. While I was waiting I walked around the place and there is great thinks to look at. My mouth is currently watering thinking about the next time I go in."}
{"text":"Fresh, tasty vegan food served by friendly staff-what more could we ask.  If we lived in Calgary we would be here all the time!!  Highly recommended - vegan or not."}
{"text":"Wow! Yesterday I had their sunflower seed meat tacos with added avocado.. BIG FLAVOUR!  I want more!!!  In recent years I have gone dairy free and so finding a delicious cheese-less taco is not easy - this is THE ONE! Regardless of whether you are an omnivore or vegetarian this is a must-try! My companion enjoyed his Thai Rainbow Pad Thai and said that he would order it again. The service was friendly and informative. :-) The location is down below eye level so get to near the address and you will soon find it. There is convenient paid parking nearby."}
{"text":"The only place I can order a Wiz Khalifa and the lovely ladies know what I am talking about. But for real, the food here will knock your socks off and make you poop like a champion."}
{"text":"This place has the BEST cold brew in the area. Don't bother with all the local coffee shops, honestly, just go here. Better quality coffee, and friendlier service. A+"}
{"text":"Fairly new little place in Kensington . Easy to walk by and miss. Located below street level.  But DO find it, and go on in, you won't be disappointed if you love fresh raw vegan food! I had the Tangled Thai, spiralized carrots with chick pea shoots, avocado,peanuts and wonderful dressing. Delicious! I also had the apple cider which was like an apple pie in a drink! So good! Already planning my next visit to introduce a friend to this place!"}
{"text":"Located in Kensington, the place is a little difficult to spot at first. But after your first visit, you won't forget!   Parking is difficult around here but is just the typical Kensington/downtown parking situation. Street parking available at a fee during the week but free after 6pm and on Sundays!  Once you go down the stairs and enter the cafe, the feel for the space is very homey; I personally like the different tables and chairs throughout the space. The cute little table and chairs on the patio were a nice touch too.   Menus are available at the front but everyone working here is so approachable and friendly; they can easily make a recommendation for you or answer any questions you may have about the ingredients list, etc.   I've tried a handful of dishes here including the tacos, the zucchini thai, the pesto salad, the kale salad, the sourdough... EVERYTHING IS DELICIOUS. I love that this place exists cause honestly, Calgary doesn't have enough options for vegan restaurants/cafes. They also have desserts that seem to change on the regular! On top of all their amazing food, they carry products from other local companies like kombucha and chocolates..  :)  If you need help picking a menu item, FOR SURE pick the tacos - they are my personal fav, and the girl told me that they are also the most popular dish there. I don't think you could go wrong with any of the menu items though, and I can't wait to go back to try more and to one day have tried the entire menu....  Overall I LOVE THIS PLACE. Delicious, healthy, affordable and VEGAN! Still a good place to eat even if you're not vegan, so please check this place out if you're on the fence and you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Healthy, affordable food in a cute space! Came here with a vegan friend for breakfast and ordered the tofu scramble on sourdough. I'm not even vegan but would come here again for this! It was super tasty and just the right amount of food for a light healthy breakfast. Would love to try some more of their stuff."}
{"text":"So not typically one to eat vegan but wow! So impressed with the food here. I ordered the lettuce tacos - excellent and full of flavour. My friend ordered the zucchini Thai bowl which she really enjoyed. We both enjoyed the coconut chocolate donuts.  Very friendly staff and casual atmosphere, makes for a good place for a quick bite and to try something new! Looking forward to coming back :)"}
{"text":"Love this new hidden gem in Calgary! Tons of great healthy options and they all taste delicious- try the broken burrito it's excellent."}
{"text":"Enticed by the pictures seen on Yelp, I tried out Raw Eatery this past weekend for lunch. The place is very homey, quiet (though not eerily so), and comfortable. I tried the fixed tacos and the pope's pesto, and both were amazingly delicious and satisfying. I couldn't even tell that it was vegan. That was how good it was! The flavours for both dishes were on point, and what's even better is that the prices for these dishes were totally affordable. I'm already craving to return for both the dishes. However, I would also like to return to try some of their other dishes. Two big thumbs up! Good price point, tasty food, healthy and satisfying without the feeling of guilt.  I was on the fence about writing a review, as I selfishly hope that this place doesn't become too known, in fear that it'll become too busy. But I decided against my worry, as this place was just too good to not share."}
{"text":"I'm not really into the idea of raw foods, I'm the kind of person who wants food to burn my mouth as I'm eating it, I also like things that taste oily and unhealthy, but I like trying new things, so I went in and ordered their tacos.   I don't say this often but ohmygerd... This is one of the best tacos I've ever had, and I left feeling full! I may have to try their zucchini pesto next!"}
{"text":"Raw Eatery is a really cool spot that is tucked away in Kensington. The vegan menu is delicious, especially the nachos. Everything is so healthy! You'll find the most unique kombucha like mango strawberry on tap. The atmosphere is super hip, due to the cute decor and alternative music. 10/10 recommend."}
{"text":"Enjoyed at fabulous raw vegan cooking class and dinner with Megan and Ali owners of Raw Eatery and Market. So so wonderful!!!!"}
