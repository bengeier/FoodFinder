{"text":"Whoever wrote the previous review needs either drug tested or owns the place. I will agree that the decor is hometown, yes the local sports teams are supported. The staff that is left alone with no management is flat HORRIBLE! I have been here many times with my family and large groups after sporting events and as we leave we ask ourselves why did we come back again. Tonight 4 26 2011 was the last straw. The help again made me feel like they were doing me a favor and please don't ask for anything such as another drink because you will get the look. The owner has a nice little place but he needs to fire and hire new people and park himself there or he will be belly-up!"}
{"text":"Took my wife and son here for a quick Friday night meal.  The place was pretty empty for a Friday and now I know why.  Got there around 5 PM, and they were all out of the special crab cakes. Our waitress gave us the bad news after a 5 minute wait.  We had to ask her again to bring our drinks.  

We waited more than 20 minutes for a burger, wings, salad and sandwich, and got corn with the sandwich instead of the beans we ordered.

Filthy Restrooms  yecch!!

Staff is friendly, but they could be a little more on the ball. 

A good place to grab a beer and bar food, but they've got to step it up."}
{"text":"If you are over 35 and want to have a beer and a home cooked meal  that fits in your fixed income budget, this is the place for you.  Tons of TVs for watching the game. Haven't tried much of the menu, but what I have tried is better than average. Service has been spotty. Sometimes great, sometimes not. 

The bar is actually pretty gorgeous. They'd be better served here if they decided to take down the kichsy bar decor and classed the place up. This place has a bit of a personality disorder.  Lots of potential here."}
