{"text":"Best Filipino food in the city, with the best prices, hands down! It does get busy at times, but that's because the food is just soooo damn gooodddd.  Also, to Jennifer K., that squid is squid adobo; it looks like it's been cooked in its own \"ink\" but it's been cleaned and cooked in a delicious soy sauce mixture -- which gives it the appearance of being cooked in its own \"ink.\""}
{"text":"Budget meals for 5.99 (2 viand, rice and bottled water). Quick fix for Filipino food. Pork Bbq great ; just ask for not so charred ones; sisig is good too. But some of the food there I could make it better at home. The only downside is they have lot of fat in their pork dishes :-("}
{"text":"I would come back for the buko pandan and pork BBQ stick!! Done well and tasted pretty good. The lechon paksiw was disappointing due to having more bones than meat in my dish."}
{"text":"This is still one of my favourite Filipino food places. I've been coming here for a long time now, so I decided to leave a review for first timers at this place.   It's located in the oriental center food court.  If you're new to Filipino food, I would suggest the BBQ pork or chicken (I prefer the pork because it's the normal Filipino BBQ), I would also recommend the lumpia (spring rolls). The veggie spring rolls are also good! You also can't really go wrong with a Filipino breakfast so a tosilog or barsilog or any other on the menu that cater your fancy.   Now if you're going Filipino and picking dishes I would recommend the Kare kare (peanut butter stew), or Bicol express (its pink in color but it's like a slightly spiced pork with a slight coconut flavor in the sauce?), beef or pork steak, or the pizza bangus (milkfish)   Definitely order a combo for your money's worth! You can get two dishes with rice and a water for 6.99. If you wanted just one dish with rice it's 4.50."}
{"text":"Stop 2 on Food Tour 2.0 (Scarborough Edition).  Came for the halo halo ($5). The ube ice cream scoop on the top is smaller than I remember, and it's not quite as colorful (When I say not as colorful, I mean instead of multicolored jellies, there was an unidentifiable brown goop with bits in it at the bottom) as I remember, but the flan was warm and tasty, so I'll forgive them. Still tasty, but I may have to rethink whether this is still my favorite place in Toronto to get halo halo.  Also got a pork skewer ($2.50). 5 pieces of pork, if I remember correctly. Tasty, but not made to order, so not as hot as I'd like, and not as tender as I'd have liked."}

{"text":"Mami's Philippine Cuisine continues to thrive in the Oriental Centre Food Court because of its loyal Filipino clientele. The food is consistent in its quality and its  variety and for myself, its the only place where I know I will always find my favourite \"Giniling\", done like my Mother's when I was growing up. Mami's combo prices  always includes EVERYTHING  you see in the steam tables, unlike other Filipino joints that have a \"special \" price for this or that. Their Halo Halo and Gulaman/sago are one of the best around. I often meet friends for a lunch date at Mami's and some good shopping after."}
{"text":"I enjoy Filipino food and have not had much of it recently, but I have never been disappointed as they are typically homemade from small restaurants (never been to a \"fine dining\" Filipino restaurant though).   That being said, Mami's was a bit disappointing in my eyes. Mami's is a small little food stand located in the food court of the Oriental Centre at Brimley and Shepphard. The place itself doubles as a tiny little grocery selling some filipino items to go along with the menu. The menu itself offers plates like Adobo Chicken, pork knuckles, and meat skewers.  I ordered the Adobo Chicken and pork skewers. It comes with a side of rice and a drink for around $5, which is great. The adobo chicken was served in a cup which was a mistake. There is a lot of grease and fat that came with their adobo chicken, so much of it compiles at the bottom. The taste was fine, but the oily meat was disappointing.   The skewer, on the other hand, was very flavorful and cooked wonderfully. I wish I got more than one. The meat was tender and the slightly charred exterior was awesome. Definitely better than the adobo chicken.  Prices are great, but the food was a bit lackluster. The food didn't look too fresh, but maybe you just have to come at a much earlier time than lunch time. The lady behind the counter was very friendly, but the place is just ok for me."}
{"text":"I am surprised that this small Filipino fast food is not included in the list here in Yelp. Mami's Philippine cuisine is located on the second floor of the Dragon Centre at Sheppard and Brimley. They offer combos that are affordable and well satisfying.  For a $4.99 combo you get two entrees, a cup of rice and a bottle of water. They give you a bunchful of food unlike other Filipino fast foods or restaurants that give you just a tiny piece of their food. The quality of food is superb. Try their Laing and Diniguan.  You get to choose your food and they have around 15 or maybe 20 entrees there. So far this is my favorite Filipino food quickie here in Toronto"}
{"text":"Mami's Philippine Cuisine is inside the food court of Oriental Centre at Brimley and Sheppard.  The price of food there are cheap. The BBQ pork/chicken/beef skewers are around $2.50 each and there are all big chunks of meat! I love their bitter melon with egg, pork simmered in tomato sauce, fried spring roll which are all really good!  The only think I don't like are the squids And they don't even clean out the sqids.. they are whole baby ones with all the \"trimmings\" inside.  All the food are there so you can point and get what you want without guessing what you getting into..   As you see in my pictures, the pig legs and really pig legs!!   This place does get busy during lunch time!!  CASH only!"}
