{"text":"Costa Verde it's the best restaurant. they treat you like family.  the best  roast chicken at great  price. my favorite dish it's the stake with fries salad."}
{"text":"This is our favourite neighbourhood churrasqueira. We pick up our chicken with side/s (come as early as possible for roasted veggies side because they seem to run out of that much sooner than the rice or potatoes). Potatoes are addicting; rice is neither spectacular nor horrible. You can choose either regular rotisserie or BBW style chicken. Line up is out the door every single evening. Reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Situated very close to very I live I tried this place out. I love their chicken !! However everything else was alright. They have take out and sit in. Their price is very good as well."}
{"text":"On the unassuming corner of rogers and oakwood, one might stumble upon a wealth of good food available at all hours of the night and wonder why they had never known about this area of the city before. I myself lived within a 20 minute walk my entire life and only recently discovered how great it is to have anywhere around where you reside.  Open 24 hours a day is Jacks bakery which serves a massive variety of delectable treats but the crown jewel of the neighborhood is without a doubt Costa Verde,  the finest churrasqueria in Toronto that I have encountered.  The chicken is always juicy and well marinated in one of the better bbq sauces I have tasted and the potatoes and rice are also a model of consistency and flavor. The chicken is always cut to order and the prices are phenomenal, you can get a whole chicken with rice and potatoes for 20 dollars even and feed a family of 3 or 4 depending on the collective appetite of said family.  I'm not ashamed to admit that I killed this very meal with only one companion, but that was a one time occurrence and can speak to the quality of this establishment.  Ramado's in Montreal takes the cake for best churrasqueria in Canada but then again there are so many yet to try..."}
{"text":"I've tried them all, but I keep coming back to good old Costa Verde. Definitely one of the best churrasqueira take-out joints in the city. Be sure to get the rice and mini potatoes.   Just go there."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The staff is always very friendly, the restaurant itself is always very tidy and clean and the portions are always ridiculously huge and very affordable. The seasoned potatoes and classic chicken is to die for! This place is by far, one of my favourite places for lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"Best Portuguese chicken rated by at least 6 of my guests. Best potatoes hands down. It's very oily but after you drain the oil it's not too bad. The oil is probably how they prevent it from bring dry like some other places. They are frugal with their hot sauce but ask for extra hot sauce the stuff is good enough for drinking!"}
{"text":"Although I have my beefs with some churrasqeiras (look at my review prior to this one), this place lives up to its title. The chicken really is barbecued!  And it's also excellent. The best churrasqueira I've experienced.  Slightly charred with a highly salted rub/hot sauce, it's hard to stop eating.  To me, Costa Verde is the king of Portuguese BBQ. And they don't need to include it on their storefront sign like others do."}
{"text":"This place took a whole food to get my chicken. Very disappointed cause the food wasn't cooked properly I had to go back and change the potatoes cause they weren't cooked through"}
{"text":"A strong 3.5 out of 5. For lunch on a Friday got good brisk service and good food at a great price. Food portions are pretty generous. The chicken was crispy on outside and succulent on inside. You could ask for hot sauce on your chicken or for it at the table,  I recommend both. The rice is savory and plentiful. If you're a rice person, share it with another and have the other person order something else to share with you."}
{"text":"Gave this place a try because I saw all the great reviews about it and I wasn't that impressed by my experience. :(  Upon entering everyone working just stared at me which didn't help the fact that I was already nervous since it was my first time there and I didn't know how they worked. Secondly, they don't speak much English and couldn't understand or explain to me the menu (which wasn't helpful itself too because there was only like 8 things on there and it was in Portuguese). I asked for quarter chicken and they don't do that so I ended up getting half a chicken which was way too much for me and I knew it was too. I asked for rotisserie and I ended up getting grilled because of miscommunication. They asked if I wanted spicy or bbq on it and I asked for bbq and ended up getting a dry chicken with hot sauce on the side.   Besides the language barrier and my experience, the food. The chicken was dry to me and I ended up only eating a drumstick and gave the other 3 pieces of chicken away to my friend. The coleslaw was drowned in mayo which made me feel really gross after eating so much of it. But what I liked was the potato balls because they were soft and cooked correctly!   Other than that, I don't think I'll return to this place"}
{"text":"Still the best chicken in the city after 30 years. If you get lucky, and it's not that busy, you're in and out in 5 minutes and home eating in 10. The rabbit on Wednesday/Sunday is also a favourite in my house. As the neighborhood changes around us, for the MUCH better in my opinion, Costa Verde is a staple that hopefully won't go anywhere any time soon."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Portuguese chicken in the city. They speak very little English... It's as authentic as it gets lol. I used to live across the street from this place.. And it was always our go to dinner when we didn't have time to cook. Grilled chickens halves(it takes longer but tastes of much better than rotisserie) , cut extra small, with their picante sauce... Is just nommmssss. Potatoes... Bomb. Rice.... Bomb. Also perfect to order for dinners or get together where no one has to cook... And you don't feel like eating shitty food like pizza. Line ups out the door and no illegal parking out front if you come at dinner time. Tip: you can call ahead and place your order... You might be able to wait cut your wait time by a few."}
{"text":"Great Portuguese Chicken on the edge of Little Portugal.  I've only ever had the grilled chicken, and the accompanying rice and potatoes.  Amazing grilled chicken.  Get it with the hot sauce, it not really that hot anyway.  \"Roasted\" Potatoes are a let down, as they are deep fried.  Rice is the standard fare (no olives IIRC) with peas and carrots.  Both the 1/2 chicken dinner (with rice and potatoes) amd the whole grilled chicken are about $9 plus tax.  The place is tiny, and if you are inside for more than one minute you will smell exactly like your meal (women, if you want to get ravaged by your men - take note). If you want to eat this fabulous chicken while seated in a place that is not your home, the bar next door serves the same hot fresh chicken to order.  What else is on the menu? I don't know and I don't care."}
{"text":"This place is good not great. I been coming here for a long time since I live in this area. The chicken Portuguese potatoes and rice taste Amazing even the rabbit did. The people are always nice to you and talks to you."}
{"text":"I worked next door at Wychwood Open Door drop-in center and was really excited to be next to a Portuguese rotisserie. Came here one cold day for soup it was everything I needed that night, came again for lunch, chicken and salad and it was alright. C'mon it shouldn't be alright. You only have one task to do. Just one! And that's make the best darn grilled chicken, how  can you not do that?"}
{"text":"My rating factors in price. This is definitely a joint that sells itself on the price they charge for the food you get. I will not even do them the disservice of rating their... service or atmosphere as it is nonexistent.  But for $10, you get one tasty half-chicken dinner that could easily feed two hungry people.  Certainly not an expert on the cuisine (though I am obviously becoming a big fan) but I thoroughly enjoyed the food. Compared to Rotisserie Romados (in Montreal) the chicken was saucy, where Romados was drier (in fact, everything at Romados was pretty dry) which I really liked. The heaping portions of heavily spiced lima bean sides were also amazing. The rice was... rice. And came in generous portions.  All in all, great place for your tam-night-in dinner if you live in the area. Only caveat is the neighbourhood can seem a little rough to your financial services or doctor-in-training friends. Best keep it at take-out only (we ate it off the trunk of a car)."}
{"text":"I give this place a zero out of 10 their potatoes were horrible there rice was dry and their chicken was shit worst Portuguese food ever tasted!! (I got to give it a star because it won't allow me to leave zero stars)"}
{"text":"Parking is a bish but one does not simply give up so easily when you are minutes away from the best chicken outside Portugal. The potato balls are 'ballzy' with flavor and tender with love and carbs!!!!  Bbq half chicken dinner is the way to go with sides of rice (very moist and never Dry or overcooked) and the potatoes. Lasagna was delicious. Make sure you get the privilege of getting it fresh outta the oven though. Mild sauce is for the weak, get it hot for the thrill."}
{"text":"I get take out from this place frequently.  I recommend the grilled chicken.  It's even better than the rotisserie.  It's got a great charred BBQ flavour.  They serve no-nonsense food at unbeatable prices.  They always greet you with a friendly \"Ola Amigo\"."}
{"text":"We recently moved to the Oakwood village area from St. Clair/Christie.   After tearfully bidding farewell to our friendly neighbourhood chicken place (Churrasco of St. Clair), we were thrilled to discover that Costa Verde is even better!  Love the local, family vibe and friendly atmosphere.  Good prices too!  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"If an amazing Portuguese chicken place is what you're looking for then look no further. This place does the best Portuguese chicken and if the lineup isn't proof enough the fact that every inch of all 4 grills are covered in chicken at all times should be. Plus great prices 30 bucks will feed a group of 4 no problem."}
