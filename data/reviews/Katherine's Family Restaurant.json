{"text":"I was very disappointed with the customer service from the server to the owner which really surprised me, what a BITCH!  I ordered a western omelet with hash browns crispy and when I got the omelet there was no cheese in it. The hash browns were barely cooked. In addition, we wanted coffee refills and no one ever came back to ask us!!  When I inquired about the no cheese the server told me no it doesn't come with it, and when I asked the owner she said that that isn't the correct way western omelets traditionally  are served! She argued with me about the history of the western omelet instead she should have been more focused on her customers being happy, especially since we I told her it was our first time there and we were excited to try her food Quite honestly, I don't look for a class lesson when I go out to eat I just want good food and good customer service, I got neither today!  The correct thing for the server and the half wit owner would have been to say, \" sorry sir but I would be happy to redo your omelet with cheese and make u another order of hash browns and make sure they are crispy\".  But guess what none of that happened!  I have cooked in restaurant my whole life and I have never heard of any omelet not coming with some type of cheese and even if she was correct in her history, she definitely failed me at her customer service skills. In addition, when paying for my food I was told that they only take cash so I had to go out and get cash to pay for this horrible experience and that didn't sit well with me, I almost said screwed it, but my conscience said don't do it, so I went back and paid my bill.  Long story short, if you want good customer service and u want good food I would recommend going to Denny's or Bob Evans. Oh yeah one more thing, if no stars were a choice I would have put none!!!"}
{"text":"Been a customer years for the fish fry during lent..will not be back,for some reason the breading on the fish changed to cornmeal,blah,not sure how the french frys were made,they were white and tasteless,soup too,salad oh my gosh,Prices are low if that's all you care about. Sad to say bye bye,will not be back."}
{"text":"I've been going to Katherine's since I was young with my dad and always enjoy breakfast here. Prices are cheap and service is fast and the servers are always in good spirits even though they're swamped with guests. I've always been a fan if their breakfast croissant sandwiches. Great after a night of drinking . There's a charm about Katherine's that keeps us coming back, worth a stop for brunch."}
{"text":"Katherine's family restaurant 
A basic diner restaurant located near the airport in Cleveland OH . 
The staff is very friendly and the food was very basic & delicious.
The decoration inside the restaurant reflects the nature of the restaurant itself . 
A good spot for breakfast. 
Unfortunately the soft drinks machine was broken the day I visited the restaurant.
Plenty of parking around the place. 
The price is reasonable."}
{"text":"Great eggs benedict, huge omelettes. Service was okay and the owner was very nice. Cash only so make sure you have cash handy."}
{"text":"It's been a few years since I've been here and apparently forgot what I loved and what I hated about this place. I do recall when it was better and felt like home but today the food was disappointing the service almost robotic. 

I think I'm done here nobody likes a cold breakfast unless it's cereal. The eggs were cold, the potatoes half raw and lacked any sign of ever touching a grill, the bacon was hours old and the coffee well the one cup I had was okay but getting a refill was impossible.

I remember having to wait in line to get a table today it was mostly empty a party of 20 could of found seats it's sad they lost their way."}
{"text":"We were in town for a concert at Browns Stadium and were looking around for a good breakfast place to go to before heading back home. This one popped up and after reading all the great reviews we decided to give it a try. We were not disappointed!! Portions were large, generous, and delicious. The sausage gravy is very flavorful... They use cut up pieces of link sausage, which is different, but it worked! I was able to substitute a couple items in the combo with no trouble... Our server could have been a little more peppy, but it was busy and she could have been in the weeds. Totally understandable. The manager checked in with us and was super friendly. Even the busser was great. Always polite and ready to refill our water glasses or remove dishes we were done with. Great experience, huge selection to choose from, really great prices. Great find! Oh, and if you're a lady, don't be alarmed if you go into the ladies room and find a urinal. You're in the right place! :-)"}
{"text":"Great prices. Decent food. The tables have a sticky vinyl cover on them that was very icky. The decor and smell is old and musty."}
{"text":"Said they are open until 3pm, but when we showed up at 2:30 we were turned away. Said she shut the kitchen down already.  Poor business practice. If you want to close at 2:30, post that on your door.  We've been there a few times before, but when you're made to feel like you're not welcome, it doesn't make you want to come back."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner and the place was deserted.  Service was excellent and server and bus girl were friendly and accommodating.
Food was good, if greasy, but you get what you order in large portions.  Was very surprised to see strict limits placed on beverage refills noted in the menu; that can be a real turn-off to diners.
Don't go in here expecting a warm, sunny decor: the 1970's dropped a bomb in here and it's now growing things like fake plants and baskets hung on the walls.  Table surface was clean, but the booth I sat in was broken and my backside plunged into a hole that kept my feet from touching the ground the entire time I was seated.
It's the decor and shabby seating that keep Katherine's to 3 stars."}
{"text":"First thing to know is this is a \" cash only\" business. So I'm posting that as we were lucky to have a $20 on us. Specials are a good deal & service is good too. Sausage gravy is odd to say the least. I'll post it."}
{"text":"Katherine's is completely insane.

From the outside, it looks like it was a 1950's post World War II building, where great things once happened. It looks like sometime in the 70's the place turned into a diner. It has cool font for their sign outside, it's in a blank plaza where life doesn't exist and no oxygen is present, and has a cool structure to the building.

Upon entering you hit a complete time warp, which rules - everything is brown, it looks like people were smoking in there for 80 years, the tables are cool. Anybody born before 1987 can really appreciate this old school style. Yellow water glasses with the weird twisty pattern and all - real charming. Except there's a really intimidating crew of like 2-4 Vietnam Vet dudes that post up at the counter (if you go in the early morning) who mean mug the shit out of you when you walk through the door. I mean, a TOTAL death stare, like some Sling Blade shit. I was afraid they were gonna throw me in the back of their truck, like, \"don't take me to the corn silo, Wilson, please not the silo\" style. Like, old harmless men with evil stares that would scare anybody. Borderline inorganic being status, the shit Castaneda warned you about. 

These dudes are obviously running shit, they've got to be there every day. It's that 20 years retired style, like when you see an old dude at the post office with a 'nam vet hat on who could have just dropped his .27 cent stamped letter in the mailbox, but waits in line and pays in exact change at the desk and wastes everyones time because it's his event of the week. Fully blasted, I hope I die before I live through a world war - sorry if that's un-american, shallow and arrogant. These dude's just weren't cut out for the future of a failed America. Kind of a deep zone..

Annnyyywayyy - The food is cheap. REALLY cheap. Like $3.00 for a breakfast - which sounds great on paper. I ordered strawberry pancakes. Simple enough. When they arrived there was about 1 lb. of insane, bright red, extra-terrestrial gel, that was as thick as dish soap, that was supposed to be strawberry. My plate looked like a goddamn crime scene. I was pretty worried. One bite indicated that this was sugar and some sort of chemical gel that probably gave me diabetes. Grid food for civilians designed by The Man to shorten your life for the low-budget heads stuck in the hamster wheel lifestyle of the crumbled American economy. The seasoned Nam Vet heads obviously lived through agent orange, charlie in the trees, and killer 70's drugs, so I can see why this food isn't as harmful to them; but I knew I was about to be in trouble if I ate any more. So I scraped the gel off to one side of the plate and got through some of the pancakes and then covered the pile of aborted alien goop with with a half eaten pancake. The server knew what I did and gave me a cold mean mug. Fair enough.

The place is cheap, but it's just too big of a drag - the nam vet dudes are horrifying. The food is toxic, and i think it's just better to leave some memories in the past, even if the aesthetics are inviting due to nostalgia. 

Extra star because the sign looks cool and the building and interior is old school.

Sorry kitty, deuces."}
{"text":"Stopped in with my daughter before a Saturday morning shopping trip. We like to visit local mom & pop like places vs the chains. Have never been to Katherine's and it was close to our destination, so we went for breakfast. Dated interior, but clean. Sign said to seat yourself, we did. Only about 6 other patrons inside. A woman came by and asked if we wanted coffee and promptly brought it over. Then a young waitress started taking care of us. My daughter ordered the short stack of chocolate chip pancakes ($3.99), I got the biscuits with sausage gravy and home fries $5.99) I like to refer to myself as a sausage gravy expert. My daughters pancakes were about 9\" around. My plate had 1 biscuit cut in half, covered with what was one of the least sausage tasting gravy's I have ever had, there were maybe 2 sausage links cut into coins and put in with it. It tasted nothing of sausage. The home fries were OK, crispy and soft mixed together. The coffee was better than some other places we've eaten at, so there's that.It was almost $16.00 for the 2 of us. While more or less attentive, the young waitress obviously wanted to be anywhere but there at 7:30 on a Saturday morning, so chipper she was not. This place was average. Not sure we'll be back. Can get better and more food for the same price at other local places we passed to get here. But never say never."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast, delicious food and decent prices. They only take cash, so come prepared. The veggie eggs Benedict is my favorite."}
{"text":"This place is still CASH ONLY, so be prepared. There are signs on the doors, but it's easy to miss... The food is okay, but nothing special. The portions are huge, and the prices are cheap, but the seating is terrible. It's retro in that it literally hasn't been updated in at least 40 years.

We ordered French toast made from raisin toast, biscuits and gravy, a strawberry waffle, and the corned beef omelette with egg whites. The biscuits and gravy was weird - whole sliced sausage mixed in a gritty gravy with no flavor. Someone here described the strawberry topping as looking like a crime scene, and that's still true (we think it's just pie filling, but can't say for certain). The French toast was really good, but that was the only thing that was.

Our service was slow and inattentive. Overall, there are much better options for breakfast nearby, also reasonably priced, so look elsewhere before going here."}
{"text":"Good service...great portions....only been here for breakfast....bad thing is cash only"}
{"text":"First time here. Place was packed for breakfast. When we were seated the lady asked if we had been here before. When I told her no, she gave me a quick run down. They use extra large Amish eggs, and Idaho potatoes. There menu is huge, I like selection. They brought crayons for my minions. Sitting here waiting on food I'm glancing around and portions seem to be on point. 

10 minutes for our food and it's served. Portions are huge. Seems to be well worth the money. I couldn't finish my omelet! Waitress made sure the minions never ran dry on their chocolate milk and when they noticed they had finished coloring they brought more for them to do so I could eat in peace. 

Very family friendly! Only down side is they didn't have avocado for my omele"}
{"text":"It was good. The portions were huge and the prices reasonable.  Service was outstanding.

I had the chili and some french fries.  The chili was very good, the fries were frozen, but they had no salt at all.  My friend had the crazy omelet.  It must have been made with 6 eqqs, it was huge.  He also had the home fried potatoes.  The potatoes were cooked perfectly and the portion huge."}
