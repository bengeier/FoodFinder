{"text":"Great place. They played Hotline Bling while I was eating, so I had to hit the whip on the downlow. Great food, great atmosphere."}
{"text":"If you like ramen noodles, you will like theirs. If you love a good bowl of ramen, this won't be on your list of favorite bowls ever, but its plenty good. The noodle bowls are enormous, but some seem a bit light on toppings. I had the miso broth and enjoyed it a lot."}
{"text":"Servers are nice and foods are good. The one thing is those don't taste like real Japanese ramen. I think more like Japanese-ish Chinese ramen."}
{"text":"So good! I'm still sitting here while my husband eats. He won't leave till it's finished because it is just so yummy! Highly recommend Ramen Bar if you like ramen dishes. You can basically get anything and everything you want."}
{"text":"Best Ramen in Pittsburgh!!! I went to there twice, and the ramen was so yummy. I could not love it more."}
{"text":"Ramen Bar was one of the restaurants that I have visited during my stay in Pittsburgh. They gave prompt and helpful service, and the ramen came out very quickly- we got our ramen in no more than 5 minutes. The ramen itself- Miso-base Ramen ramen-was pretty good. If you are looking for a large portion of  some good, hot ramen, come here!"}
{"text":"Not the best ramen I've ever had in the world, but for Pittsburgh, it's the best you're going to get. It's a nice change for a casual dinner on a cold night. The ajo soup is outstanding if you can tolerate smelling like garlic all night ;-). The service is spotty. I've had one really good server there and one frosted flake. The portions are large which should make Yinzers who want more bang for their buck smile - this is definitely a doggy bag situation.  My only suggestion would be to offer a rice noodle option for those who are gluten free."}
{"text":"Terrible delivery experience. Worst I have ever experienced anywhere. Ordered $40 of food at 3:30pm. It's 5pm now, and still no food. The kid on the phone blames the driver, explains they aren't very busy, etc, offers me 25% discount. 20min go by, more calls back and forth, still no food. I have two kids who are more than ready to eat dinner, and I have to go to work soon. Fail. Decent food, too. Not great, but ok in a pinch. What a shame to wait 90min during their slowest, non-peak hours."}
{"text":"I love this place. I wish I could say something intelligent about the menu as a whole but I can't because I order the same thing EVERY time I go there. Tan tan men!  It's delicious spicy goodness with flavors that leave me craving it often. In fact, when we travel to different cities, we are now on the hunt for good ramen similar to what we get here. When I was in NYC, we went to a ramen place that got excellent reviews and it was  good ( similar to this tan tan men) but hands down The Ramen Bar still can't be beat!

The owner is very nice and I enjoy eating at the communal table, even when I'm with my husband. 

If you have never had \"real\" ramen before, give this place a try!"}
{"text":"The food was great, which makes what happened even more disappointing. After everyone in my party had paid (a group of 7, some paying together and some with bank cards) we exited the restaurant. We were about 5 steps from the door when our waiter ran out after us yelling \"Not all of you left tips!\" Excuse me? First of all, even if we hadn't, chasing after us and screaming /making a scene isn't the way to convince us to actually leave you a tip. Secondly, every single person is not going to leave you a cash tip when some are paying together, and some are paying with cards. Common Sense. Lastly, the restaurant actually kept one of our party member's change, which was over $5. They didn't want to demand it as they are non-confrontational. So there's your tip from that customer right there, which technically you stole to begin with. Very saddening. Will never be eating at this establishment again as will none of the other people with us that day."}
{"text":"I LOVE RAMEN BAR!!!!  It's perfect for when you want a custom soup full of all your favorite things during rough Pittsburgh winters. I'd give them five stars but they don't deliver to my area although I'm only 15 minutes away :("}
{"text":"I tried it three time, they used Asian flavor which is delicious and not that much salty. It has different options of huge dishes. The place was nice and warm, it is perfect in cold weather."}
{"text":"So simple yet so good! They let you build your own bowl of ramen with your choice of meats, broth, and many add ons for about a dollar like a hard boiled egg or vegetables. A little pricey though, typically a bowl of noodle soup was like $9-11 without any add ons but it is still a definite must try!"}
{"text":"lucky us to have this place in Sq. hill among the ever growing restaurant scene..I thoroughly enjoyed by soup with roast pork and had enough for leftovers"}
{"text":"Environment: 5/5
Food: 5/5
Service: 4/5
Price: 4/5

We came here late on a Friday night. They were about half full at 10pm with customers still coming in the front door. My boyfriend was a bit trepidatious about the menu because he loves noodles but isn't a big fan of brothy dishes. We ordered \"Chicken Karage\", \"Yom Yam Men\", and \"Tan Tan Men\". The dishes arrived with just a little wait. The karage was extremely juicy with a great creamy dipping sauce. My boyfriend was pleasantly surprised by how much he liked the tan tan men. He ordered it with chicken and broccoli, but decided that next time he'd skip the chicken and double the veggies because they really stole the show with how well they paired with the spicy broth. The yom yam men is reminiscent of vietnamese noodle bowls with its lightly spiced broth and heaping cilantro. Unlike most vietnamese dishes expect lots of delish veggies rather than tons of meat. Really hit the spot for me.

The prices were pretty reasonable for the large amount of food. You don't go over $10 a dish unless you add extra toppings. I really enjoyed the experience and would recommend it to friends. We'll probably be back next month."}
{"text":"I walked in here 15 minutes before they were scheduled to close on a Friday night (about 10:45pm). The two of us were greeted by a friendly waiter and seated right away. We ordered two appetizers and split a bowl of udon. We loved the vegetable spring rolls! Four small rolls that were crunchy and delicious turned out to be the perfect start. We also tried a kim chi appetizer with cold tofu. Loved the kim chi the tofu was tofu. I don't think I would order that again.

The soup was spicy with chewy, delicious udon noodles. Service was fast & friendly and the food was good. I can't wait to go back and try the ramen!"}
{"text":"The most important thing you need to know about the ramen bar is that they do not serve the Tonkotsu broth. Tonkotsu broth is the thick, white broth that we've come to associate Japanese ramen with. While there are a variety of innovative ramen dishes, such as kimchee ramen and spicy egg drop ramen offered at the restaurant, we left feeling disappointed. I understand that the Tonkotsu broth is by far the most time-consuming and difficult ramen to pull off, but really it's the biggest draw for ramen lovers. I don't mind paying $11 for a bowl of al dente noodles with rich broth, but it better be really good. Considering that the restaurant is doing a soft opening this week, I hope that they will gather feedback from their patrons and make the appropriate improvements."}
{"text":"If I can give negative points I will do so. My  roommate and I went for dinner at around 9:30 . The waiter ( girl) just walk through us without any greetings. We were standing for more than 20s without any greetings. There were three staff in the store and only two customers. But that's not the most annoying part. I got the Japanese seafood undo but I found a little fly in the soup. The waitress came and said  THAT IS NOT MY FAULT.  I am not asking for anything but the attitude is so bad! Then the guy came and said he can't see that. He game us half price of my ramen but I just ate a little. Will never be there !!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my experience here. There is a neat little seating area right by the window for two that is bar-style and looks out on the street. The ramen is good, though the pork was a little fatty for my desires. The broth was delicious, and overall was a great dining experience. Huge portions, and great food quality. It's the best ramen I've had outside of Japan."}
{"text":"Cool decoration, cool concept, but why the food is not good . Over cooked noodle , fake broth , I mean I can taste it was made with  some type of concentrate adding hot water and everyone on our table end up adding hot sauce and soy sauce in order to not waste the over priced  food we need to pay later. I was excited when I saw they are open thinking finally we got a ramen place, but what a waste of good concept and good decoration . I still need to go to LA to have a decent ramen ........."}
{"text":"Perfect ramen.
Perfect place.
BYOB.
Try the Ajo Ramen + wontons."}
{"text":"It is bit much to call the restaurant 'Ramen Bar' when you can't make good ramen. I visited there two times. First time a few months ago. The service was nice but, ramen was ok, nothing outstanding. I put it on ok list. Second time last Friday, and it is probably last time. I ordered Tom Yum Seafood Ramen. It was bad! I mean I could eat, but the seafood all smelled way too fishy like it was not fresh or not cooked properly. The broth was not good - just ok. Very disappointed. The server never came to check back on the food and refill water."}
{"text":"tantanmen was spicy and I like spicy. I'd say 8 or 9 on the american spicy scale. The green tee wasn't my favorite but I may not be into green tea. My boyfriend loves garlic and got the ajo with mushrooms and loved it! We also had the garlic edamame which was delicious and the octopus balls which were heavy and the octupus was a little chewy but overall something interesting to try!"}
{"text":"This review is based solely on the fact that the four waters we received all had debris floating in them.

I'm not sure if their dishwasher needs to have its filter changed or if their dish washing staff isn't doing a very good job. In any case, we left prior to making orders."}
{"text":"There food is cheap and flavorless. We've eaten here once and ordered take-out twice, each time it has no flavor and I have thrown it out after a few bites."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try the new Ramen Bar in Squirrel Hill. 
I was sadly disappointed with my food.
The broth had GREAT flavor but the chicken and vegetables were BLAND.
It tasted like the chicken and veggies had absoloutely no seasoning.
The atmosphere was okay.
The weight staff was extremely nice and helpful."}
{"text":"It was my first time at Ramen Bar and it was a good experience. I got the wonton ramen with tofu and it was great! It came with pork which I thought I would like but it was just one big piece of dry pork.... No bueno. And another downside was my friend didn't enjoy her Japanese garlic fried rice (it was bland) and the waitress knew it so she avoided asking my friend if she enjoyed her meal or not. Which isn't good customer service. Other than that great spot! And if you don't like your meal just speak up! Because they sure don't care to ask."}
{"text":"I went to the Ramen Bar with my two boys and one of their friends. They were familiar with the cheap Ramen Noodles and wanted to try the real thing. I was very pleased with the Curry Ramen I ordered! It was flavorful and filling! My older son who has a more sophisticated palate enjoyed his order with the basic Shoyu broth and wanted to make a return visit! My younger son and his friend (both under the age of 12)prefered the .25 noodles found in the grocery store. This would definitely hit the spot on a cold Pittsburgh winter day!"}
{"text":"Love ramen bar! This was actually my first ever experience with ramen, never having the packages stuff, and will definitely be coming back. Picked up an order of Tan Tan Men, service was quick and I was on my way. Ramen was very good, perfect level of spicy, and portions were huge (definitely enough for two meals). I will be back!"}
{"text":"I live near Ramen Bar, and there's nothing better on a cold day than a big warm bowl of ramen. (Except, perhaps, a warm bowl of pho -- I go back and forth on this point. Regardless, I appreciate the noodle renaissance we're going through in SqHill.)

Ramen Bar's menu is a lot of hit and very little miss. I really enjoy the standard ramen (shoyu base) and the wontonmen (shoyu base), both of which come with a delicious slice of roast pork. Of all the optional toppings, I've only tried the egg -- I found it to be very nicely cooked, and appreciated what it added to the dish.

The special ramen provide different takes on the dish. Of the many offerings, I like the Wu and Ajo; however, with any of the specials, I find myself missing the roast pork of the standard offering.

The only miss for me was the gyoza appetizer, which is somewhat boring. I've steered away from the appetizers since.

The only downside for me is the price; at $10 / bowl, it's a bit expensive. I would eat here more often if there were a smaller portion at a $7 price point."}
{"text":"Excellent service, clean tasteful decor, but poor food. Not a great experience by my standards . I had negi ramen, friend had ajo ramen. The old vegetables and meager chunks of pork in both our dishes were disappointing. My miso broth was tasty, friend's ajo ramen broth was strange. I might come back a second time, but would not rave about this place."}
{"text":"Pretty good ramen place.  The menu doesn't distinguish between hot and cold though, so make sure to ask.  I got cold noodles by accident one time when I really wanted something hot."}
{"text":"I should preface this by saying it is nice to have a place in Pittsburgh that serves ramen.  However that being said, I was disappointed by the broth options - either miso or shoyu but not the rich, fatty pork broth that I am used to getting on the West Coast.  Might be good for the health but to me somehow I feel like it's not quite right."}
{"text":"Not a huge menu and pretty much just ramen soup. Good flavor to the curry and kimchi soups. Good prices, fairly small place, and quick service. Recommend for the price point and lunch."}
{"text":"Ramen Bar never disappoints. One of - if not the best - ramen places in Pittsburgh. During each of my visits I've been waited on by several different people and they're all super friendly. Food comes out quickly and is delicious."}
{"text":"Waiter was super nice, had perfect timing. Even though this isn't fancy, they really paid attention to every detail. Had the vegetable ramen with a miso base and the kimchi and tofu appetizer. Ramen was fantastic and fresh; the kimchi tasted strange (as in chemically-off?). Overall, I loved it. Great service and food for the price of my bowl :)"}
{"text":"It was very good and a welcome addition to Pittsburgh dining. I had the basic ramen shoyu with pork and kimchee, and felt it was worth the price. ($10) The service was good and the place was packed, and the big communal table is fun. Definitely going back. And this is their soft opening, so I feel they're off to a good start, and may even get better."}
{"text":"First time at ramen bar and enjoyed everything there. Service was great and we didn't wait too long for our Food which was excellent. My kids enjoyed the fried rice while my wife had the curry ramen. The music was enjoyable as well. Definitely recommend Ramen Bar!!!"}
{"text":"This is the best ramen fusion in Pittsburgh! Okay so its not New York, San Francisco, or Japan, it's still a great meal.  I would actually rate this as 4 and 1/2 stars if I could, because all items were not created equal.  I love the Tan Tan Men, which is also available in a vegetarian version.  Some of the options can be a little bland, but for the price, the ambiance, and the friendly staff, this little place has become a staple.  It's also open a bit later than a lot of places in Pittsburgh, which in my option, is sadly lacking in late night dining, why does everything close by 9??  Great on a cold day!"}
{"text":"I'm completely addicted to this place. It's fairly small, but we'll say it's cozy. My favorites are the vegetable ramen with the miso base (it's an extra 50 cents but worth it) and the iced green tea. Sometimes I'll get crazy and add the won-tons (you can add extra veggies, meat, etc. for additional $). The service is quick and when I've had takeout it arrives promptly."}
{"text":"The food is good. But I'm giving it a 3 star (neutral) because of the awful delivery experience/service I had. They got my order wrong 3 times but every time I called back to explain the situation the guy on the phone always gave me an attitude and acted as if I was the one at fault."}
{"text":"As ramen joints go, I have seen better.  Not the best ramen I have had but not the worst either.  The portions are good but the broth was a bit bland.  Everyone at my table had to ask for extra flavor (hot sauce) and we all ended up using soy sauce too.  There were a decent number of veggie in the soup.  The egg on top was a pre-soft boiled egg (not cooked on top of the bowl as I have seen in some other ramen bars). Each bowl seemed to have a good amount of veggies in each bowl.  

I was unpleasantly surprised to hear that they use chicken broth in their miso base soup.  Why spoil a good thing?  Miso is a great stand alone flavor, I don't get it.  Make sure you ask for the veggie broth when you come if you need to as isn't on the menu."}
{"text":"Checked this place out tonight, not impressed at all. Service was a problem, food was bland and tasteless, and dining room was cold with no heat. I understand its a new business but there are some basics they should've got right. Don't think I will be going back."}
{"text":"The delivery man called me and hung up twice. He then proceeded to bang on my window loudly before knocking on my door ringing my doorbell. My ramen smelled awful and tasted even worse. I didn't have more than 4 spoonfuls. My Shrimp Gyoza tasted good. Given the other reviews and the fact that half of my order was decent, I'll give them the benefit of the doubt regarding food quality. However, the service was atrocious and I probably won't ever order from them again."}
{"text":"our little family( me,my husband, and our lil daughter) love love love this place.
the soup is flavorful; it may not be spicy hot, but the joy of  good ingredients (yolks on those eggs..freshety- fresh broccoli...) and skillful, loving preparation is all there.

whoever complained this not being ny- or tokyo- enough, i have to say this-- the whole experience strongly recalls honolulu( which has its very vibrant asian cuisine scene) .

and the person who disagreed w noodles getting packed in separate container from the broth- have you ever tried to eat noodles soaked in broth for however long it takes for you to get hungry again? someone actually took their time to separate said items thus preventing a soggy mess of broth and noodles.

overall, place kicks some serious butt. the athmosphere and decor are sort of retro- romantic- dreamscape honolulu/osaka escape from just about anywhere.

thanks for being here, ramen bar !!!"}
{"text":"The food was great! We really enjoyed the tan tan men, tenshindon rice (aka omurice, or omelet rice), and takoyaki (octopus inside a ball-shaped fried wheat batter)."}
{"text":"Sooooo much food for your money. This place was at least 3 meals for me. Love the environment, it's nice and quiet and intimate. Went with a couple of friends and everyone enjoyed the experience, I don't think anyone had a complaint."}
{"text":"The service was great! But the ramen broth was very plain! It tastes like warm soy sauce water. I wasn't able to eat ramen a month after! (BTW, I'm Ramen Lover!)"}
{"text":"Love the food, but hate the décor. Unappetizing green wall, unrelated photo mural, bad floor and awkward group table. I wish they'd gone for a more warm real wood interior because it just like a strip mall joint. However, good ramen and that's what I go for. Glad there are a couple veggie options on the menu."}
{"text":"After craving ramen for a solid couple months now, I'm so happy to have finally tried this place out!

First thing I noticed was the lovely ambience. The place had a casual yet classy feel, with nice tiled floors and furniture made of dark wood. We went around 2pm on a Tuesday afternoon but it was surprisingly popular! The staff were polite and service was very fast. Great place for a quick lunch!

The food was AMAZING! I got the miso ramen ramen and I could not get enough of the soup. So savory, pleasantly salty, warm and comforting. The portion size was great especially for the price! I also got a small side of kimchi which was delicious and hit the spot. My sister got the ramen with wontons and they were very generous with the wontons. My only complaint is that they did not give too much pork with my ramen.

Overall it was a delicious and delightful experience. Would highly recommend and we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Wish there was more depth in flavor in the broth. But otherwise pretty good. I'm just glad there's a ramen place in the area."}
{"text":"Bad service! Bad service!!!

Japanese food is my favorite food and I was so excited when I saw this restaurant. I was here once when it was soft opening. The service was not good at that time, but I understand they just opened business and need time to get on track.

After the opening, I came back at a Friday night, with expectation of slightly improved service. 
My friend and I were waiting at the door while two groups were waiting inside. After 10 minutes, a waitress walked to us and asked whether we wanted to seat at the bar, we said yes, thinking the other two groups might not want to sit in the bar.

Right after we took off the heavy winter coats and sat down, the owner came to us, in front of everyone, said very loudly \" hey, you cannot sit here, those people came first!\"  It was so rude, embarrassing, offensive, and insulting!
I replied politely, though still very confused, \"but your waitress invited us?\" I was trying to point to the waitress.
The owner interrupted and said \"Don't point! I know who she is and I have already YELLED at her. Look, I am just trying to be reasonable, okay?\"

Does that mean we are not reasonable? We did not bribe or lie to the waitress to get in. If the owner walked to us in a POLITE manner and explained the situation, we would understand and go back to the waiting line. Instead, the happy Friday night was destroyed by the way we were treated. 

We decided to leave the restaurant right away and never come back again. We don't want to have food at a place owned by people who YELL all the time. If he/she doesn't treat people well, who knows how they treat food."}
{"text":"Delicious food, fast service, clean place, friendly people.
My favorite - Curry Raksa Ramen. Ask the friendly personnel to make it less spicy if you are not into too spicy stuff.
Huge portions - I take home half of the soup."}
{"text":"I was strolling by on a Saturday mid-afternoon when I came across this place. Upon looking at the pics of various dishes posted outside and realizing that this was more than a few steps up from the packaged Ramen on which I survived in college, I decided to venture in.

I was greeted very pleasantly. I ordered a cocount curried soup with wheat noodles and beef. Although the beef was a little tough I though the soup was delicious. It wasn't too sweet or too bland but imo had just the right flavor and spice. The place had a pleasant decor. I would have preferred either outdoor seating or more windows on the front for outdoor viewing but all of that was really minor.

My dish was excellent not to mention I was able to leave it in my car all night (something I try not to practice), heat it up the next morning adding two hard-boiled eggs to it, and indulge it with no problems. The price at around $10 wasn't bad considering the serving size. Finally, the service was excellent as the guy serving my food was pleasant and genuine. Verdict: I'll be returning to try their other dishes."}
{"text":"Wow. Incredible. The waitress is literally so lovely that I think it's the main reason Ramen Bar deserves the rating. She could serve me unsalted tuna with crunchy peanut butter on it with a side of soured yogurt and iced robotussin and I would tip her 50% and come back for more. Definitely go here."}
{"text":"As someone else said, it always seems very empty when I visit the Ramen Bar, but I always enjoy the food. The wait staff is pleasant, and the portions are very large. Lots of options and it tastes delicious!"}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday for lunch. I had the spicy vegetable ramen with miso base, with additional tofu and egg. The bowl of ramen was huge, but was not as flavorful as I had hoped. The egg was soft-boiled and had a nice runny yolk, which was delicious, but the tofu was plain... I was hoping for fried tofu, something more than just out-of-the-carton.

The service was initially great, a college-aged guy who was very attentive and polite. However, as we were finishing our meal, an older guy who seemed like he might be the manager took over serving our table. He was brusque and was obviously trying to rush us. I wanted the remainder of my food boxed to go, and he tried to take our food without asking how everything was or if we were done. When I made clear that I wanted the remainder to go, he placed my dish of hot sauce with the underside resting ON my food. Ew."}
{"text":"Pretty good: 3.5 stars for meat, 3 stars for veggie ramen

Went for an early dinner. Started with the vegetable gyoza. The filling was tasty and had some depth but fell short of everyday noodles' dumplings. The gyoza were nicely browned and not dry.

For our entrees, we both chose the spicy shoyu broth (mine was vegetarian). The wonton men ramen ($10) broth was good but one dimensional. The noodles were unremarkable and the dumplings were more wrapper than filling. It was good but not great. I got the Midori ramen ($9.5) - vegetarian. It was okay, the vegetables seemed fresh - especially the broccoli. I added tofu for $1 which they added generously. 

The vegetarian soup was not significantly better than a packaged ramen that you could spruce up on your own with fresh ingredients. But the portions were large - a good deal for the price. 

Food was average, service was good, the place was a little noisy for being half-empty."}
{"text":":) so so so good the veggie ramen makes me :) came out very hot and delicious. the service was fast and very sweet. going again tonight because it's a cold one :)"}
{"text":"Rarely do I venture to Asian restaurants because I never know what to order. I get scared of the chopsticks and fear that I will regret my order and end up getting worst thing at the table. 

Yesterday, I went to Ramen Bar for the first time due to a friends request. The staff was very friendly and helped me order something that most 'non-Asian food eaters' enjoy. The food came out quickly and was beyond amazing. The noodles, caressed in a flavorful broth, reminded me of my college days where all we could afford were ramen noodles; but these were a lot better and had  a touch of class. I would highly recommend this restaurant if you are in the mood for something delicious and different."}
{"text":"The service has always been excellent - servers offer to split bills, they're friendly, and the food arrives faster than expected. The small dining room has the tables packed in, but the atmosphere is more cozy than crowded. 

The food - My favorite is the Tan Tan Men. Not too spicy (for me), and the sesame-based broth is rich and flavorful. My friend's favorite is kimchi udon. 
I've also tried Japanese udon, veggie ramen, wonton men, and a few appetizers. Always hot (heat, not spice). I usually stick to their specialties, mostly because I find the broth options more flavorful than their basic shoyu and miso.  However, dining companions have had few complaints. Also, take out and delivery options are available - who wouldn't want to eat spicy ramen in front of their non-working, ancient gas fireplace on a cold night? 


**Note: I don't have other ramen dining experiences to compare it to, but Ramen Bar is a solid choice among the other dining options in Squirrel Hill."}
{"text":"Some of the best ramen bowls in Pittsburgh. Tan Tan Men is my go-to. Mildly spicy, fresh spinach, lean ground beef, and noodles that take on the broth flavor. Perfect for rainy or cold nights. Food comes out in a few minutes and staff is always friendly. If you don't see a creation you like, make your own bowl."}
{"text":"It seems that this is the only ramen specialty restaurant in Pittsburgh. But honestly, the place is mediocre at best. Their soup was not bad, the service was good for the price, but that's where the positive part ends. The noodle obliviously just came out from the refrigerator and was not cooked well, as they stick together into several chunks, which really made me uncomfortable. The meat (chashu) also felt like it had been frozen for some time and was defrozen hastily. The overall taste and presentation was not authentic. It's neither Japanese or Chinese, at least. While it's a relieving that they have bamboo shots (some ramen restaurants in New York don't!), it's not what ramen should taste like. The only reason I give it 3 stars is because I like their Chicken kara-age, which was way better than the ramen itself.

Now, if you have never tasted ramen before I won't stop you from trying this place since good noodles (of any type) are quite rare in Pittsburgh. But this is not what I would expect from a ramen specialty restaurant."}
{"text":"FLAVORFUL BROTH AND GREAT OPTIONS FOR VEGETARIANS

Hi my darlings! I'm going block to block lately in Squirrel Hill and BF and I figured we would give this popular spot a try. I was PLEASANTLY surprised. I anticipated blah bowels of broth and additives. What I got was great broth with a depth of flavor I hadn't anticipated. It was great! Vegetarians have lots of choices here and will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Although I'm sure better ramen can be found elsewhere, this is as good as any I've had in Pittsburgh or Philly. Service is always good, and extremely fast (they just spoon some soup out), and the soup is consistently savory and delicious. Always hits the spot."}
{"text":"I GrubHub here a lot.  I always order the Veggie Ramen with Shoyu broth.  I love this restaurant.  The food is consistently good and every time I have it delivered, it's hot and fresh.  Some day, I'll have to eat in the restaurant."}
{"text":"When I'm craving some ramen (and not the 25 cents/pack ramen noodles I used to live on in college), this is my go to place! I've dined previously and had a great experience. The wait staff were all so sweet and the service was quick! I was happy to see that they also deliver. I ordered lunch from Ramen Bar one afternoon at work. When I received my food, everything was still nice and hot. They give you a giant plastic container with the broth (I got the miso broth) and some veggies (bean sprouts and pink radishes) then they gave you a small take out container full of the noodles, meat of your choice (I got seafood--mussels, scallops, shrimp) and the veggies that you choose (I chose bamboo shoots, seaweed, baby corn, and bean sprouts). There was so much food that I was able to make my lunch into two meals. My order was about $20, but it was worth every penny. So yummy!"}
{"text":"Not impressed, so far.

Friend and I were excited to try this place as soon as we heard about it and waited until they were officially open to come here for lunch. I had to stalk their facebook to see that they were open all day starting Jan 1 (then changed to Jan 2) from 11AM-10PM. Except I walk in and they tell me they're not open until 12PM. No hours posted on the door, no information on the web.  The \"cash only\" sticker wasn't removed though they now take credit card. The menu is still a wrinkly piece of paper. Seems to me like they really rushed their grand opening, but working out logistics is still understandable.

What I won't be able to look past is their really really mediocre but pricey food. For Pittsburgh, I wouldn't mind paying twice this for a really great bowl of ramen. That, or I love a good valued cheap homey meal. Ramen Bar was neither. My negi ramen had a pretty average shio broth and only a tiny helping of  pork and what seemed like scallions cut 2 ways. Notnotnot worth $9 - and that's without some of the toppings I would consider standard (like an egg) that is extra for $1 here. My friend tried the kimchi ramen off of the \"specialty\" section, which included some things like garlic or curry ramen - interesting twists, but there's not much to dropping delicious store bought kimchi in soup and making it taste great - again, not worth the price. Naturally as kimchi lovers we both liked hers more than mine.  

What's REALLY not worth getting, though, is the chicken karaage, at $7, for 5-6 nugget-sized pieces of blandly battered chicken, served alongside iceberg lettuce which took up more of the plate than the chicken did. 

The helpings are generous (though it helps if the food were good) and the decor is great. The service was... inexperienced, it seems. At this point, I'm just going chalk many of this up to growing pains. My friend had a much worse impression of the place than I did though, so hopefully next time I'm in town I can actually convince her to see how the place is developing. The potential for a ramen shop in Pittsburgh to succeed is so high, and hopefully Ramen Bar will grow into a great little shop. For now though, they've got a lot of work to do."}
{"text":"Tasty food and GREAT service.  Ordered online, with coupon, and the follow-up from the establishment on when my order was placed and when we wanted it was awesome.  Our favorite dish is the noodle soup of course.  Lots of yummy additions.  Also, vegan options.  A huge plus."}
{"text":"Def somewhere you know you'll get a warm filling dinner! I decided to try the dry noodles instead of getting the ramen soup which is what I usually do. It was surprisingly very delicious although a little dry. There wasn't a lot of chicken either but the few chicken it had was well cooked and yummy. Good place for a cozy date and never too nosy. I think I prefer the ramen miso soup though compared to the dry noodles."}
{"text":"Great simple Ramen Bar.  Don't expect more and bring your own booze but if you want great Ramen, this is the place."}
{"text":"I love flexibility of making your own ramen bowl. It reminded me of the good ramen I can get back home."}
{"text":"Really good food, and you get lots of it but the down fall is its price and you have to pay extra for almost everything"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to get a quick bite in Squirrel Hill. I have tried the Ramen Ramen with Shoyo base (the classic ramen that I would definitely recommend ordering if its your first time), the Tan Tan Men (very unexpected flavors, but one of my favorites, also not too spicy if you order 1 spicy star), and the Curry Ramen (probably my least favorite of the three, because the flavors where so unexpected). I love the atmosphere of the restaurant because its always very busy, but you never have to wait for a table. The service is also extremely fast, everything comes out usually within 10 minutes of ordering."}
{"text":"First all Ramen place in Pittsburgh, and for that 4-stars. Great place to go on a cold day."}
{"text":"Excellent food, prices and service! Despite the big size of our group, the service was fast. This is a great place for affordable yet delicious food. Also, there are plenty of options for vegetarians!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Great service and awesome ramen. The dumpling appetizer is delicious."}
{"text":"Can't comment on the food because we never got any.  Seated right away but sat for 10 minutes waiting for water and asked to order right away.  Waited another 20 minutes, then we were told a big take out order trumped us and he tried to push us to front but it didn't happen.  When all the people around us who were seated after us got their food and we still had nothing, we were out of there.  That was 30+ minutes of our lives we will never get back.  They need a manager."}
{"text":"Despite that All my friends told me Not to go to this place, I walked in anyway just for the curiosity that how a ramen place can be so bad? 

The moment me and my wife saw our noodles, I regret right away....
Anyone with common sense would know that Japanese ramen is made of pork bone broth, the ramen my wife got has a thick chick broth oil on the top, and it's so salty that she couldn't finish 1/3 of it given the circumstances that she was extremely hungry! 
And my ramen was even worse, I can't believe that they use canned meat (from chinese supermarket) pour over the ramen for the price of 8 dollars!  Huge disappointment !  I recognize the smell of the canned meat cuz that's what I eat when I m lazy at home.....
Oh well, I ask for it I guess... At least I know now why everyone around me told me \"Don't go\" so .... If you are also a curious George, just order the Mapo ramen to take out and compare to your canned meat from maybe Lotus or   you will see what I meant."}
{"text":"This isn't ramen. Go visit any decent ramen restaurant in SF, LA, NYC, or just any other city with a good food scene. Their kimchee ramen is literally just a korean kimchee soup with terrible ramen soggy noodles. The \"ramen ramen\" dish tastes BASIC, like they used some instant powder and microwave to make the soup base. The \"tan tan men\" tastes like a hodge-podge of asian flavors that just leaves you with an impression of WTF? Seriously, this place is awful and I guess it's still in business because people haven't anything better to compare it with....but the flavors are still pretty bad."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to check this restaurant out for awhile now and I'm glad I did because I really enjoyed the food and atmosphere. I did a build your own bowl with spicy shoyu broth and the ramen ramen recipe. I added baby corn and egg to this and asked for additional spicy paste to put in the ramen. When I received my order I was surprised (in a good way) at how large the bowl and meal were. It came out piping hot, which I appreciated. I hate tepid, lukewarm soup. The ingredients within my bowl were all blended well and I could get a bite of everything each time. I thought the additional baby corn portion was quite substantial and paying the additional amount for it was worth it. I personally think the ramen should already come with an egg and customers shouldn't be charged extra for it since there isn't a whole lot of protein within the bowl, but oh well. As for the taste, it was delicious. The ramen was hearty and filling. My broth was lighter than my date's miso broth. I preferred mine to his. The only thing that was a little difficult was eating the ramen with chopsticks and the large spoon, but I think this makes the experience and slows down your eating speed so that you really can enjoy the ramen. Lastly, we had also ordered edamame as an appetizer and it was good. I also thought the service was normal, nothing exceptional. I also believe the restaurant if BYOB. We didn't know this before coming in."}
{"text":"Ordered to-go and was pretty satisfied with my ramen. Had the takoyaki balls and they were also filling! They separated the noddles and soup which as great. Friendly staff!"}
{"text":"HUGE bowls of soup - the leftovers were another meal - good choices, nice atmosphere, delicious food."}
{"text":"I've had ramen here a few times. I recommend the kim chi as an add on. It is really delicious. Also, I would caution against adding the chopped garlic. I love garlic, but their food is already so falvorful."}
{"text":"It's very small, very loud, very crowded and can get very hot or cold very quickly, depending on the weather. There's also no parking lot. Parallel parking is your only option. If you're not skilled with chopsticks, you may want to avoid this place, lest you make the same mistake I did and go with friends who are all chopstick experts and make a fool of yourself while you try to gather udon noodles in your spoon to no avail, leaving you hungry, frustrated and embarrassed. I don't know if they're supposed to offer forks (or if they even have forks) to struggling diners because our server didn't offer one to me. There was a small, sharp chicken bone in my soup that I was lucky enough to find and discard. The taste, quality and temperature of the food were all good, but it can get pricey pretty quickly if you enjoy appetizers and add-ons. I know this place gets excellent reviews all the time, but I have to rate it based on my experience, and unfortunately, my experience wasn't the best."}
{"text":"My first ramen bar experience.  Yay!  I'm a fan.  

Basically this is the perfect place to get warmed up with a hot bowl of tasty ramen on a cold day, or probably any day for that matter. 

The staff was really nice and our ramen came out quickly. 

The vegetable ramen was presented as a huge bowl of miso broth filled with noodles and various veggies that left me feeling comfortably full and happy."}
{"text":"Not bad! I was nervous to try this place because of the mixed reviews but I was pleasantly surprised. We ordered the pork gyoza, tan tan men and spicy miso ramen ramen. We were told the gyoza are handmade there and they were fried to perfection. The tan tan men was delicious: really nice balance of sweet, spicy, salty, and sour. However, if you're sensitive to spice, this might be a bit too spicy. Although the gyoza and tan tan men were delicious, the spicy miso ramen ramen left a lot to be desired. The broth wasn't very spicy and it was quite one-dimensional. All in all, I'd come back mostly for the tan tan men :)"}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool. Always super busy but even when there is a small wait usually on the weekends, it goes quickly. 
Service is really good here, wait staff is on point.
The food is delicious. What is better than a big azz bowl of Ramen?! I eat ramen at home on the regs (when Im broke sometimes) but also because I love noodles, sometimes i get wild and eat Ramen for breakfast- there is no wrong time to eat Ramen. The ramen here is way better than 99 cent top ramen from the store (Obvi)... 
They have a lot of different broths/noodle combinations that are pretty interesting. I usually get the Octopus balls as an app- also delicious. 
Really good noodles decent prices, especially good on a cold winter evening when you are hungry and in the Squirrel Hill area!"}
{"text":"Love their Ramen soups and very nice...I accidentally dropped my chopsticks and they were at our table right away with new ones:) I would defiantly go their again..."}
{"text":"When my Japanese coworker recommended this place as being, \"not terrible\", I was quite excited to try it.

If you're the kind of person who has never experienced ramen except for cheap instant noodles in college, then... surprise, surprise! the $12 offering at Ramen Bar is far superior to a disposable $0.50 meal. But, if you have ever been to Japan, or to any large American or Canadian city that has real ramen, then you will immediately realize that what the Ramen Bar serves up is only a poor imitation at best.

I tried the shoyu chashu ramen, a classic dish that earned the Tsuta ramen shop in Tokyo a Michelin Star. At the Ramen Bar, the shoyu broth had none of the delicate balance of saltiness and umami that one would expect, but instead tasted just like any $1 shoyu-flavoured instant noodle seasoning, except strongly diluted with water so that it was even worse. Instead of richly marbled chashu that's sliced to 0.5 mm thick and melts in your mouth, they give you... stringy pork monoliths that are rock hard, tasteless, and take away all the moisture in your mouth so as to scrub against your tongue like sandpaper. 

Well, at least they give you quite a large quantity of meat, so they've got that going for them. The server was quite nice too. It is deplorable indeed that many Pittsburghers will never get to try the real delicacy that is ramen."}
{"text":"Am absolutely stoked that Pittsburgh has got its own dedicated ramen bar now. I think the only other Japanese related craze we now need to get on is an izakaya bar (Japanese tapas... for the most excellent small plate Asian restaurant in Pittsburgh, try Tamari's happy hour... cannot be beat for price and quality). This place has all the right moves, and reasonable prices to boot. I know it might be sticker shock to pay $11 for a bowl of noodle soup, but these bowls are HUGE. And delicious.

If you are expecting the more traditional fatty pork broth, you won't find it here, but that might be for the best, given your New Year's resolutions. Their broths are plenty good regardless, with a choice between shoyu (soy), miso, and plain salted broth. I thought the miso was a bit too potent for my taste, and prefer the shoyu. It has a subtle flavor that builds over the course of the meal.

Ultimately, the ajo ramen is my favorite, even though it's not exactly \"authentic.\" If you like garlic, you'll love this. And if you love someone who loves garlic, well... let's just say that you'll be safe from vampires after dinner.

Apps are relatively expensive, given the quantity, but the noodle bowls are enough for a full meal. Staff is very friendly and attentive, although they can get a bit behind when they are swamped."}
{"text":"I heard this place was going to be pretty good I believe that the pork was left over from yesterday and this place I was hoping I was going to be pretty good I believe that the pork leftover from yesterday. My children also did not like it. :("}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late lunch today.  I had the shrimp gyoza and chatsu ramen.  I was still working on my gyoza when the ramen arrived but it was steaming hot and needed to cool a bit anyway so it worked out ok.  Both the gyoza and the ramen were quite good.  I'm surprised to see reviews that the broth was bland and mine was very flavorful with 3 large slices of pork that was falling apart tender.   Very glad I sought out Ramen Bar on my trip to Pittsburgh today!"}
{"text":"I ordered the kimchi ramen, with tofu and wonton add ins. It was delicious, hot, and fulfilling. You definitely receive your moneys worth in food, I had enough to make me full and to take some home for an other meal. The service was quick and our server was very attentive. It is a smaller restaurant with only a few tables. 


Also, I went with a very picky eater, he was able to find something on the menu that he would eat. which is not easy with most Asian restaurants."}
{"text":"I ordered two dishes, the fried chicken appetizer and the chashu (?) ramen which consisted of extra pork in a syoszu (spelling) soup.  I added extra wontons for fun.

The fried chicken was awesome.  Tasted great and the orange mayo they had was good.  I definitely see myself ordering this everytime I come here.

The pork in the chashu ramen was good.  The noodles does have the same taste/texture as the ramen noodles I am use to bring home.  However, I didn't really care for the broth.  It still tasted great overall but I feel the broth can be better.

What's up with Pittsburgh and wontons?  Everywhere I go, including this place, the wonton sucks.  It is mainly wrapper with a little meat.  All I taste is wrapper.  If you go anywhere in California, wontons are wontons with meat inside.  I'm paying for wontons, not wonton wrappers.

I wish they added pictures to their menu.  We had to run outside to look at their sign that had photos of their dish.  I didn't really think the restaurant look anything amazing.  I did wish the waiter was more attentive.  I didn't get a refill for water until after I was done.

But I do want to come back and give their other dishes a try.  They have potential."}
{"text":"Very nice and clean noodle bar. Food was delicious and the seaweed salad the best I have ever had. They don't however serve alcohol which didn't bother me. Service was fast and friendly. There is street parking available or you can park in the public covered parking lot which is just around the corner. Will definitely stop there again!"}
{"text":"I had the udon Kim chi soup. Delicious! Great service ambiance with music and people!"}
{"text":"As a 3 star suggested in yelp- it's OK.

I love ramen, especially soy shoyu ramen, and I look for it every cities I stayed when I have time to. The one here:
Soy soup base: no soy sauce savor, but all covered up by daikon. Don't get me wrong. I love soup base with daikon, but it's just not the right smell for \"soy\" soup base. The right one should come from the savor of good soy sauce and long cooked pork bones. I didn't taste strong msg tho. That's good at least.
Shoyu- the pork is as hard as beef jerky and tasteless :(
Topping egg: it's plain! I love how the egg is soft boiled, but it should be flavorful. It should be marinated in the cold sauce for hours/days.

Overall, it's an ok place if you are really craving for a bowl of japanese raman. Just don't expect too much."}
{"text":"I was in pittsburgh on vacation I was craving ramen and I thought I would give this place a try bc other yelpers posted such delicious looking pictures... 
My oh my were they deceiving. 
I had the chashu ramen in shoyu broth with an egg because it seemed like a safe bet. Overall the bowl was less than satisfactory, the aroma was meh, the egg was completely bland, broth was weak in soy flavor, and the chashu was pretty tasteless.  My favorite topping for ramen usually is menma (fermented bamboo) and somehow that was ruined- which baffles me because you can buy jars from Asian markets that taste better. 
The only saving grace was the noodles, which was firm and cooked just right. 

The miso broth my friend had was better, but not by much. 

I was sad when I walked out because it didnt hit the spot at all. 

Give it a try if you're feeling adventurous, but just know there are better ramen out there (idk about in Pittsburgh though)."}
{"text":"Cute set up inside the restaurant with the big tables. But unfortunately, this place cannot compare to anything in either San Jose or New York City. With all the other Asian restaurant opinion on the same street, I don't think I will be back here anytime soon. Don't get me wrong, this place is not bad but it really isn't up to par compared to everything else around it.

I came here not long after it first opened and was really excited that a Ramen place finally came to Pittsburgh! One star for their interior set up - I had a lot of fun sitting at a big square table that's shared with different people! After going through a menu, I see they do have quite a few options for ramen and it was a hard decision because I wanted several of the options listed! Anoter star is for variety! The prices are very similiar to the other ramen places in the big cities, which is fine to me as well. But when the noodles finally came out, reality also hits......

First of all, the noodles weren't as hot as it should be - since a big part that makes ramen taste so good is the fact it's almost steaming hot! And the taste was very so-so. Although nothing tasted bad, but their soup base is no where close to the other places I've tried. Nothing with the flavors made me want to come back again soon. But immediately I know that as long as there are other Asian food next door, I don't want to pay the price I did and come back for mediocore noodles.

BUT WAIT.....I did give them a third star because this is the ONLY ramen place in the greater  Pittsburgh region. And if you've NEVER HAD ramen before, this is still a good place to test out just for the ramen experience. Other than that, I wasn't very impressed overall."}
{"text":"Just avoid trying it out, it is a disaster. The noodles are plain and too much MSG in the soup."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for ramen in Pittsburgh. The miso ramen is a little bland, but the shoyu ramen with egg is the best. The egg adds a lot of flavor after you mix it in. The takoyaki ball is huge and delicious, but don't try to tackle it alone. The gyoza is slightly crispy on the outside, but tender and juicy on the inside. I love this place and highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I went to Ramen Bar for the first time and ordered the Tan Tan Men and it was delicious, but very spicy. The staff was very kind and did a good job of explaining the items on the menu. Unfortunately, after I got home and went to eat my leftovers, there was a dead fruit fly in my container. Obviously I was disgusted and threw away my leftovers. I was highly disappointed and this incident makes me not want to go back."}
{"text":"I love this place! I have been several times and have yet to be dissapionted. everything it tasty. The spicy vegetable is delicious and the tan tan men was out of this world! I usually ask for them to leave the meat out of my dishes becasue I just have a weird thing with meat in soup but the groud beef in the tan tan man was great."}
{"text":"Taste - No tonkatsu ramen. Shout base only.  Soup was good. Egg was not very tasty as it was not marinated. Chashu was not real Japanese chashu. It was just a prelude of pork. 

Service - good


Price - ok."}
{"text":"I'm usually a huge fan of ramen, but this restaurant just did not do it for me. I ordered the Tom Yum ramen, hoping it'd have a sweet/sour soup base. However, the ramen soup was really salty and tasteless at the same time. I didn't even know this was possible. Unfortunately, instant ramen tasted better than what I had. Definitely won't be coming back again!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place a lot more than I actually did since ramen is my most favorite food in the whole wide world but couldn't. This place reminds me of a ramen restaurant in Los Angeles called Ramenya but nowhere near as good. The bowls of ramen were okay. Decent variety of ramen but the flavors could be better. Ajo Ramen and miso ramen were good. Try to stay away from the basic create your own bowl ramen.

This is pretty much the only place you can get ramen in Pittsburgh, so it has that going for them, however I hope being as trendy as ramen has become in America, someone will open a decent tonkotsu ramen in Pittsburgh. Please someone."}
{"text":"Had a great meal here! My kimchi ramen had lots of flavor. My partner had the curry ramen was also quite tasty. Beware, the portions are huge! I couldn't finish my meal unfortunately."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Ajo Ramen was great, had the dumplings added to it. Great place, didn't realize it's BYOB. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"The ramen is not very good if you are truly wanting a tasty bowl of ramen BUT I think I will be back here in the winter for a nice, big bowl of noodle soup."}
{"text":"Not the biggest place, and it's always busy, but the Ramen is the best.  Had the Tan Tan seafood Ramen and has a nice spicy kick to it  Also we had the pork Gyoza which is also very good. Couldn't pass up getting some Takoyaki so got an order to go. Would have been better hot but the soup was just to filling.  Been here many times and always good, but especially on a cold winters day."}
{"text":"First time visiting this place and it was a good impression. The employees was really friendly & we was seated right away. The ramen was good.. And the portion was cool too. Pricing is decent also. We go there every 2 weeks so I guess it's a pretty good place lol"}
{"text":"I'm not really a connoisseur of Japaense food, but I do have taste-buds, and you better believe that they don't lie.  I had a great time dining at Ramen Bar.  It's a clean, modern-looking establishment with relatively decent service and a good selection of food choices on their menu.  I had the ajo Ramen which was flavorful and spicy hot in the way I like it.  Sriracha sauce came out promptly as I pre-emptively asked for, which automatically deserves an extra star in my book.  

Service can improve a bit, though.  I felt like things were just a bit too slow at times, though I bet some of that has to do with the popularity of this place.  It gets packed!"}
{"text":"It's good to find a vegan friendly noodle soup broth in Pittsburgh (anyone know where else?) but with that said, the broth was not very flavorful, besides salted. Needs more vegetables. I got it with Tofu. Rice noodles. Hot soup on a cold day."}
{"text":"So bad! Maybe it's because I just went to the best ramen place in all of Toronto, but this REALLY tastes like the kind of ramen you get... from a supermarket!! Try their soup base and make one yourself from any $1 instant noodle, they are the same! The noodle itself is kind of mushy, and the pork cutlet is very bland. Overall: I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Quite mediocre.  I got the Ajo ramen bowl. The flavor was fine, but nothing spectacular.  The thing that annoyed me was that given the price, you should get some \"extras\" with it. All of the garnishes that make for a good ramen all cost extra.  The noodles are not fresh, but rather the kind that you'll get in a $0.10 brick.  I've been to three ramen places in pittsburgh, and this is my least favorite."}
{"text":"This is a place you'll want to visit multiple times to try all of the variety. The ramen noodle bowls are delicious, I had the curry ramen bowl and could overhear the table next to me ranting and raving about two entirely different dishes from the one I had before me... this place lived up to what I had heard about the taste, definitely not your average ramen packet and the prices are good for the value. Another pro, the service is friendly and prompt and you can get seated fairly quickly if you get in early enough on a Saturday night which is a bit of a transition into some of the downsides. The ramen bar (though in mentioning the name will plug another plus of byob) is certainly not a place that seems to encourage a good date night, the food comes fast, the check comes fast, they don't proactively ask about wanting dessert i.e. They want to clear tables, and the establishment is pretty small. They have one large table, but I'd encourage going elsewhere with a group. Also the appetizers seemed to be less than their forte (I tried the shrimp gyoza) so my suggestion go for a specialty ramen, with someone you want to spend a well served hour with, enjoy yourself and come back soon!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I don't eat pork, I got got a shoyu with veggie base ramen with seafood and egg.   Maybe deviating from their norm was my mistake, but It was bland, had to ask for extra sauce and soy sauce which improved it mildly.    However, I'm willing to try this again because my hubs' Tom yum (he was hesitant to order it because it was Thai in a ramen place?) was quite delicious.   But their soup would definitely hit the spot on a chilly Pittsburgh night..."}
{"text":"Cozy modern atmosphere and very flavorful food.  I've had the shoyu ramen with kim chi mixed in and the black pepper noodles.  

The shoyu ramen is great, but I would not recommend the pork version since the meat itself is quite bland.  

The black pepper noodles, however, are beyond amazing.  I would highly recommend them to anyone who likes moderate spice.  

Ramen Bar is one of the things I miss most about living in Pittsburgh.  

Unfortunately though, I'm not sure that they make their own noodles.  If this is true, then it would be my only criticism.

Overall, Ramen Bar is superior to Everyday Noodles, which is across the street.  Although Everyday Noodles has better vegetable dumplings, makes their own noodles, and is set up in a really cool way that allows customers to see the noodles being made, everything else is more flavorful at Ramen Bar."}
{"text":"Tan Tan Men every single time. It's spicy but one of the best items on the menu. Also have BYOB which is nice!"}
{"text":"Looking for something different yet comforting and fast?? This was our first stop after a 3 hour drive, we ordered, ate, paid, and were out in 20 mins. Noodles were decent and the broth was yummy."}
{"text":"Based upon the reviews and information from friends, I gave a try.  As a native Japanese who loves ramen noodles, I would rate the taste as 3 stars.  The reasons are;

1) the soup does not have much 'broth\" taste and it is covered much by miso (I ordered miso ramen) to make it up.  Not bad but I wish I could taste the broth (either chicken or pork bone base with some vegetables).  

2) Ratio of noodle and soup was not well balanced.  As a ramen lover who has eaten many ramens in Japan, the volume of noodle was low.  I would like to be full with more noodle than soup.  

3) The sliced pork was too thick and does not have much flavor.  They call it chasyu but the size and the thickness were way too big for the authentic ramen topping.  The sliced pork for the authentic Japanese ramen is seasoned with; soy, sake, mirin, sugar, ginger, garlic, scallion, and simmer the whole block for a few hours, then thinly sliced like a ham.  The authentic ramen usually comes with 1-2 slices while Chasyu-men serves with 4-5 slices.  This thick slice was dry, tasteless, and not fun to eat.

4) The negi (green onion) was also too thick.  Again, the authentic ramen noodles do not have thick sliced green onions.  They usually served with thinly sliced ones.

5) Menma (seasoned bamboo shoots) was probably not homemade.  That's OK even in Japan, menma is not always homemade.  It was not too bad.

Here is a good one I can defend.

1) Seasoned eggs were pretty good.  They were not hard boiled; still soft inside and nicely seasoned with soy base sauce.  

2) The entire volume was very generous.  I was thinking about ordering soy-base ramen as an extra (shoyu ramen) but one bowl of miso was enough.  

This is my only first try and I won't judge this potentially good restaurant with a negative thoughts, therefore, I would rate as 3 stars for now.  There are many other items I would love to try.  

If this place wants to serve the real and authentic Japanese style ramen noodle, they probably need a little more research and improve the smaller details.  Again, I am a native Japanese and knows about ramen probably more than the average diners there, thus, my criticism may sound too much and too picky but since they sell Japanese style ramen, I needed to say what I thought.  

I will visit again soon."}
{"text":"This was a specular experience for me.  No 3 inches of snow on the ground or frigid wind was going to come between me and my bowl of steamy hot Ramen. I credit my boyfriend with the idea to try Ramen Bar and it was well worth the two buses and tramping through the dirty sludge to get there. 

Ramen has been a dish I was curious about for so long one that I have seen my favorite TV personality Anthony Bourdain enjoy. I had the Tom Yam Men I made this choice because I saw in the menu description that it was Thailand inspired hot and sour broth.  I added egg and shrimp.   The shrimp was plentiful in the dish however I found myself wanting more mushrooms and the egg was hard boiled I had been hoping for a poached egg one with a runny yoke. 
The service was very friendly and the other dining guests there were of various ethnic backgrounds.  Ramen Bar is an A + in my book."}
{"text":"I like the ambience in this restaurant -- it's dark and subdued. For large groups, there's a huge table available in the back which is kind of communal seating. It worked well for our group of six although the stretch was a bit long for sharing appetizers. Speaking of which, I would recommend the garlic edamame which was delicious. Food wise, the portions are huge so prepare to split something or take leftovers home. I'm not exactly a Ramen connoisseur, but I enjoyed my meal thoroughly and plan to go back again."}
{"text":"I love Ramen and as I am half-Japanese and love to eat authentic ramen in and out of Japan as well as to make it at home - I always am thrilled when I find a place that serves great, 
authentic ramen outside of Japan.  Ramen Bar in Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill area is just a place.

I stopped in for dinner and was promptly seated.  I ordered the takoyaki, chashu ramen in a miso base soup with corn, nori, bean sprouts and traditional poached egg with calpico to drink.

The takoyaki arrived hot with plenty of bonito flakes garnishing and melting on top.  Blistering hot but delicious, I might have liked a bit of the traditional okonomiyaki sauce with the mayo but it was fine.

The ramen was perfectly cooked, in a delicious miso broth with truly the most perfect Japanese style poached eggs.  The garnishes were perfect and the bowl was empty before I left.

If you love authentic ramen - Ramen bar is THE place to go for it in Pittburgh."}
{"text":"Life is about second chances.  I tried Ramen Bar again.  Service much better, the gyoza were good and hot.  The best thing was the miso ramen, it was actually quite good and I finished it.  Maybe not the best ramen shop in the world, but it's worth visiting.  Good on them for striving to improve."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch during a cold winter day with a friend to eat. In short, I found this place extremely disappointing and overrated. I don't exactly recall which ramen dish I ended up getting, but like many who have wrote reviews for this place, I remember it being extremely salty and as such, I had to drink a heck of a lot of water to be able to eat it all. That being said, the quality of the ramen here is really subpar and not in line with quality standards that you would find in a respectable ramen joint in other cities on the East Coast (let's not even begin talking about how it falls short of baseline quality standards for West Coast ramen). It's also really oily, which didn't particularly go well with my conscience. Oh and for what you're getting, the price is rather ... not particularly worth it. Really salty, oily, and as for the noodles? Subpar. Not sure I'd want to come back here for another go around."}
{"text":"Got takeout when I was visiting. Veggie ramen was great and very flavorful. I got the spicy miso broth base-- filling and yummy! Lots of veggies which is great. Pickup time was only 10-15 minutes even though it was dinner time on a Friday!"}
{"text":"Spicy and delicious Ramen at reasonable prices. Lots of choices, or you can design your own Ramen bowl. 

The staff was welcoming and friendly.  I was helpfully guided in choosing and customizing my Ramen.

My order came very quickly and it was steaming hot. I especially enjoyed the great decor."}
{"text":"VERY tasty, food ALWAYS comes fast & always good service. The Tan Tan men (spicy!) is what my dreams are made of!! I love trying everything on the menu, but I can't stop myself from ordering this every time... Mmm..
(P.s. You know it's good when most of the restaurant is Asian patrons!)"}
{"text":"So good!  Try the Tan Tan Yen and add garlic and an egg.  Great balance of spice and flavor!"}
{"text":"Lota superb Asian spots on this street and Ramen bar fits right in.  The takoyaki was yum and they offer very easy substitutions for switching out noodles (ramen for udon etc) and swapping meats (pork or chicken etc).  I know what I like and Ramen Bar hits the spot."}
{"text":"I love ramen. I used to think it was just like what you get with the instant Cup Ramen, but then I had ramen in Japan and was absolutely blown away. Ramen at Ramen Bar, unfortunately, is not like the ramen I had in Japan. It's not bad though.

I had a Curry Ramen bowl and I liked the flavor. Why I'm not rating this place higher is because the noodles don't taste that special. They are sort of like normal instant ramen noodles. I'd really like to see them kick up their noodle game. There was also just a lot of liquid in my bowl. It gives the illusion that you get a huge bowl of food, but most of it was soup. Everyone said they had more than enough and some people were taking food home, but somehow I demolished my bowl and wasn't stuffed. Did I get less food than the others or maybe I was just hungry that day?

I came with five others though and I thought it was a good place for lunch with a small group. The service was good, and everyone was pretty satisfied with their meal."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery on a particularly cold night when I was getting over a stomach bug. Got the Negi Ramen with Shoyu base with egg, white onions (For some reason in my post-Gastro stupor I did not realize this would be a legit white onion chopped up in slices--thought would be white chives for some reason, but that's a me problem not a them problem), spinach, and mushrooms. I was really excited that mushrooms are an option, because I live right near Tan Izakaya and have been disappointed that mushrooms are not an option in their ramen.

My food came earlier than GrubHub protected and was still warm enough that I did not have to reheat it. The seasoning on the seasoned pork and marinated onions was very nice, and I really liked the soup base. The mushrooms were shiitake only, and the dry seaweed is cut up into tiny strips. The egg was still Runny and very delicious. I was very happy with my food, the only things I would've changed would be bigger pieces of dry seaweed and adding maybe some oyster mushrooms in there. 
Also, this was legitimately two big meals and I will be ordering from here frequently as a medical resident on a budget!"}
{"text":"A weird sequence of events brought me to the Forest Hills area last night.  When I realized I was only a few miles from Squirrel Hill and Asian food deliciousness, I knew I had to make a side adventure, and this adventure brought me to Ramen Bar.

I love real ramen (now that I realize it's not the top ramen of dorm room days), but I'm far from an expert, so I asked the server for a recommendation.  Without hesitation, he recommended the Tan Tan Men.  While I overestimated my spiciness tolerance, this was delicious stuff!  Very flavorful broth, perfectly cooked noodles, tasty beef, and spinach.  Soooo good but soooo hot.  And, at $10 for a giant bowl of soup, a great deal!  All of the servers were very friendly.  I was by myself, and they found me a seat immediately at the bar, which was nice.

I don't get a  chance to go into Pittsburgh itself all that often, but next time I do, I may be making a return to Ramen Bar."}
{"text":"I don't get all o the gripes. This is not New York or Tokyo and if you're expecting Pittsburgh to suddenly live up to that then it might be time to move on. That being said the Ramen was delicious and the staff went out of their way to make sure we were happy.

I can't speak for their specialty ramen, we had the roasted pork miso ramen and the ramen with regular broth and dumplings. Miso is my personal fave and it was rich and delicious with perfectly chewy noodles and a nicely done soft boiled egg. This place is an excellent addition to the often mediocre/awful Asian food scene. 

Based on my fellow yelpers maybe consistency is an issue but give this place a chance!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice, ordering the shoyu negi ramen both times, and I honestly can't say I've ever had better ramen, including Brooklyn's famed Chuko. Amazing, amazing, amazingly fresh noodles and hearty, flavorful broth. And they package it separately for takeout so the noodles don't get bloated. Delicious."}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite place to eat in Pittsburgh.  Just love this place. The Tantanmen Ramen with egg and sprouts added is my go to dish.  Always amazing and just enough spice to warm your body.  I often ask for additional spice on the side just in case it's not spicy enough."}
{"text":"The noodle soup tastes ok. I have had better ones before. The soup doesn't come with enough toppings unless you pay extras for more, which is kind of stupid..."}
{"text":"I crave the spicy vegetable soup. I would go way more often if it weren't for two things. Thus only 3 stars instead of 5. So please--to the owners/management: #1. You simply must do something about the terrible freezing draft hitting diners every time the door is opened. It's brutal. #2. Often the choice of music playing is completely inappropriate. How about something more authentic? Please, no more rap, thumping bass, or screeching heavy metal guitars."}
{"text":"The results of this review are inconclusive because I ended up ordering a soup that I knew I didn't really want (we all know how that happens). There was nothing wrong with it, but it didn't wow me.
My girlfriend ordered a beef and bamboo shoot soup that was very good and hearty. It was more like what I really wanted and should have ordered.
But what I know for sure is that we showed up at 940 at night and the staff was accommodating and didn't make us feel rushed, whereas other restaurants on this strip were already closed up or trying to tell us the kitchen was closing. 
I will definitely give these guys another shot when I'm in squirrel hill again."}
{"text":"Not a ramen expert, but this place isn't bad...however some options are much more flavorful than others so pick wisely if you're trying to get a really spicy flavorful soup. My favorite is the tan tan men! Cute simple ambiance too and your food comes out SO quick!"}
{"text":"Apparently servers and managers are not Japanese. And therefore the Ramen is made from semi Japanese  and semi random stuffs. Then why would you want it? 
*Price: You would get exactly one piece of meat and a few pieces of vegetables. Slightly better than instant noodles from local Asian supermarkets and you spend 5 times the money.
*Service: I was served with water without ice, without being asked. 
*Noodle: I guess they either bought the noodles somewhere else or made the noodles a long time ago, since 5 bowls of noodles came to the table in less than 1 minute.
*Taste: Salty, salty and salty, I had to keep drinking water.
*Environment:  We were told to sit next to a stranger.

**Summary: It is just too easy to do business in Pittsburgh man. How can it survive in other big cities?

Update: I had a diarrhea at 2am, I had the noodle at 6pm and did not have anything after that."}
{"text":"I went with a larger group and there were very mixed reviews none of which were great. I personally didn't like my dish at all! I ordered a spicy soup, it tasted like mildly spiced water and left the worst taste in my mouth. I ate a third of the bowl which was all I could stomach. The curry ramen smelled somewhat decent and seemed to be the best option at the table but the overall consensus was that everything completely lacked flavor. The meat in the ramen was fatty and chewy. The service was friendly but not the fastest which was not the fault of the waiter. There appeared to be only one or two waiters in the place and maybe a busser here or there. We had reservations but waited about 30 minutes. No one took our drink order, although they don't serve alcohol so that wasn't a huge deal. I will say the egg roll appetizers were delicious but it was so small! We got 4 egg rolls that were a quarter of the size of a normal egg roll. To sum it up, thumbs down, won't go back, won't recommend."}
{"text":"Ramen can be the best to warm your insides on a cold, bitter day. There's certainly a lot of those days in Pittsburgh.

I was pretty excited to find out about the Ramen Bar, and was recommended to come here by a few others. While the portions of noodles and broth, there was a lack of vegetables and meats. My Ramen Ramen dish had only a few bean sprouts a single slice of pork. It was great for flavoring the broth, but the meat itself was terribly overcooked.

My partner ordered the seafood ramen, which for $4 more than my dish, and included only two shrimp and and two mussels. 

I also wish a spoon had been offered. I struggled to eat my ramen with chopsticks. While we were getting ready to leave, I saw everyone at the table next to ours ask for spoons and forks. I felt kinda silly not asking at that point, but a soupy dish is not easy to eat using chopsticks.

I do applaud the quick service and the hot meal, but I'm curious if I could find a better local ramen place."}
{"text":"Ordered one of their specialty ramen bowls, the curry one. Broth was good enough and not spicy at all by asian standards. Beef came as sliced and frankly quite dry. Also ordered their gyoza (pot-stickers). They looked nice but tasted OK.Overall not a bad place to go."}
{"text":"Really wanted to like this place, but it was just ok-- not bad, but not good either. Will we go again? Maybe if we're desperately craving ramen.

We tried the Shoyu ramen and the Shoyu Chasu ramen. The broth is just missing some depth. There was no layer of fat/greasiness that you usually see in a bowel of ramen like this. It was maybe a step above soy sauce and water. Also they nickel and dime you for toppings that should be standard, like an egg and nori. The pricing leaves you paying $12-14 for a bowel of \"meh\" ramen. 

With that said, they do have a lot of other noodle choices that could be better. But our first experience here trying the standard was not that great."}
{"text":"Decent place. I was craving a bowl of ramen. I ordered the spicy miso base. It was ok, by decidedly not spicy. Flavor was pretty good, but not great.  The gyoza I ordered were excellent, and service was very prompt and friendly. 

Maybe I should have just ordered a different ramen base, but the experience was decent overall."}
{"text":"Ramen bar was Ok. Having had a lot of Japanese noodle previously in different places, I might have expected too much from the authentic vibe that i got from the initial look of the restaurant. 
I liked the clean taste of their soup bases and noodles, but was very disappointed in the amount of vegetables and toppings they put on for how much I paid (some of which cost extra $1, and noodle itself was 9-10 dollars )...considering chewing fresh vegetables and meat w noodle at the same time is a big part of the Japanese ramen experience. The restaurant does have a good atmosphere  (good lighting too) and decorations."}
{"text":"This is probably by far the worst ramen bar I have ever been too.  The ramen isn't terrible per say, but relatively speaking, it's pretty bad.  First, they messed up the order, which is fine... mistakes happen.  They're human too.  The ramen with the vegetable broth was the most flavorful, compared to the spicy and regular shoyu, but it still wasn't amazing.  The regular shoyu was so bland and tasteless.  Even Swanson's chicken stock has more flavor than it.  The spicy shoyu was not spicy at all.  I feel so terrible saying this, given that it seems like a mom-pop shop, but the ramen (at least the one we had) were nothing but bowls of disappointment.

On a brighter note, I did like their takoyaki appetizer.  It's fried balls of octopus topped with bonito flakes and nori.  Correction:  it's supposed to come with nori, but I guess they forgot it in our order.  

Service was OK.  It met the minimum requirements which is fine by me, minus the almost dropping the ramen on people. Our server also wasn't quite the whipper snapper."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try The Ramen Bar because spicy ramen was one of my favorite things to eat when I was in Japan.  The soup here is just ok-ish.  Really nothing special.  They do give you a big bowl of soup but I thought it was a bit pricey for soup."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. The good is wonderful and the service is great. I would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"I like to eat very basic foods and ramen bar does the basics right. I used to just get the ramen ramen but I've since discovered their wontons, so I now get the wonton men in a shoyu base with an egg. I get the bamboo shoots and bean sprouts on the side and no green onion because I do not like to mix anything with my noodles but meat. The pork slices are average, but the wontons are simple and delicious, the filling is just a solid piece of soft meat and both go great with the noodles.  The noodles are nice and firm and perfectly cooked, and go well with all of the meats and the egg. Even their boiled egg is so good I started to make my eggs like they do. The broth is so delicious that I can't resist the urge to sit and sip on it while waiting for my friends to finish even though I know it's unhealthy and I'm already really full. The portions are huge and satisfying. When I'm looking for a warm, simple, filling meal I always suggest ramen bar."}
{"text":"I was so thrilled as I was surprised that there was a ramen shop in Pittsburgh!! The place was pretty small but cozy. As we walked in, they sat the two of us at the big table (seats about 15 people) which you share with other parties. While we were looking at the menu, our waiter kept coming over to ask if we were ready which was a bit annoying since it was our first time there. We ended up making up our own ramen bowl. Mine was the shoyu broth, ramen, egg and chasiu. We also ordered takoyaki and pork gyoza. The takoyaki came first which tasted pretty fresh (6 pieces). I liked the takoyaki as it was a pretty good size and it was fresh. The gyoza came next which was a disappointment.  The gyozas came in 6 pieces with a sauce for dipping. I didn't really like it as it was a bit cold and I think that the frozen ones from trader Joe's taste better!! The ramen came shortly after. I was soo excited for this and was truly disappointed.  The broth had NO taste and so did the chasiu. I felt like I was eating something which was seriously tasteless. The egg was not fully cooked which might have been the highlight of my ramen. The spicy shoyu tasted a bit better but I still did not like it. 

The cost of the takoyaki was definitely worth t but not for everything else. The gyoya was about $5.50 which as mentioned you can get better ones at other restaurants or trader Joe's for cheaper. My ramen was $12 which was definitely not worth it as I left about half of it. Occasionally,  I had ramen at different restaurants and this was one of my least favorites. Overall, I would not go back to this place. Glad that I tried it though."}
{"text":"One of my most favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh! The flavors in their ramen never fails. My favorite is the tan tan men ramen but I like creating my own sometimes too. I always always order the takoyaki as an appetizer. I love coming here because I always get in and out quickly. So if you're not sure what to get but don't want it having to take too much time, this is the perfect spot to go!"}
{"text":"Best Ramen Bar in Pittsburgh in terms of taste.
Strongly recommend Ajo Ramen (not spicy) and Tantanmen (Spicy)."}
{"text":"Excellent service and great ramen!

I went to Ramen Bar on a Friday night with my girlfriend. We had an AMAZING server who ensured that ever detail was covered and the menu was thoroughly explained. I ordered a Ramune Japanese soda, which was a nice touch and we started with an order of gyoza. The flavor was great and I especially loved the dipping sauce. The vegetable ramen with pork was delicious as a main course.

All-in-all this was an awesome friday night date choice. The service was excellent, the food was good, and the atmosphere made me feel like I had made a hip choice for the evening. If the price had been slightly lower I would probably make this a weekly occurrence."}
{"text":"It seems like every time I walk in here, it's never busy.  Most people would be turned off by this, but I know better.  I love soup, and I lived off ramen in college, so to find an upscale ramen that I can eat without having dorm room flashbacks is top notch.

The atmosphere is nice, simple, not your usual tacky paintings of tigers and samurais adorning the walls.  Dark colored tables and walls...it's relaxing.  The only thing I don't like about this restaurant is the giant table.  I don't think anyone would be excited to be seated at a family style table with other parties of two, I've seen it before, no one likes to be paired up with complete strangers.

The food is pretty straight forward.  Typical appetizers, I got dumplings, and they were dumplings, slam dunk.  The ramen menu is straight forward as well, lots of pre-set items, and if you want to act like you know ramen more than the chef, you can make something yourself that  will probably be disgusting, and you'll send back, because you're an awful person.  Oh, and I dont think the noodles are made fresh, but if they were, that would be over the top.

Everything tastes great, but when it comes down to it, it's soup, nothing is going to straight blow you away, but there are some great flavors in the broth, and some pretty substantial ingredients that are a nice touch to an entree that can barely be considered a meal.

But yeah, anytime I'm in squirrel hill and am looking for a casual lunch, or even an early dinner, I like to check out ramen bar."}
{"text":"Came here for my friend's birthday! I ordered the Tan Tan Men, ramen in sesame soup with spinach and ground beef. Last time I visited, I also ordered the Tan Tan Men, so I can say that overall taste remains consistent across visits. 

I really like the soup base flavor of the Tan Tan Men and the noodles are good too. I would probably add vegetables next time or order edmame on the side if I were to get the Tan Tan Men again since the original order itself doesn't have a lot of veggies. Otherwise, looking forward to visiting this place again sometime and trying another ramen order!"}
{"text":"Anyone who has never had \"real\" ramen (just the packaged \"impasta\"... ha ha, get it?) needs to come and check this place out!  I will admit, this was only my second go with the legit noodle experience, but I was with someone who lived in Japan for three years and was impressed with the authenticity.  There were three of us and we each tried a different kind (Chashu Ramen & Negi Ramen both with the miso broth and the specialty Kimchi Ramen) with a couple add-on's of egg and bamboo shoots.  Was this the best broth I have ever tasted? No. But was it delicious, full of flavor, and more than enough food to fill me up? Yes!  I actually couldn't finish my bowl and the waiter was nice enough to separate my noodles and broth when he packaged up the leftovers so they wouldn't get mushy.  If nothing else, I don't know how anyone could not find enjoyment out of slurping up the noodles with their chopsticks.  I will definitely be back here, especially in the cold winter months!"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in here during an ice storm and it was just what we needed. It's perfect for a cold Pittsburgh day. We each got Ramen bowls with Shoyu Base. I got the Won Ton Men and she got the Vegetable Ramen. The bowls come out quickly and steaming hot which is great because it takes some time to eat the whole thing and it's still hot when you get to the bottom. The staff is friendly and seated us right away at the big table in the back with other parties. We went back a week later and had a similar experience, were seated right away but this time near the door. Ramen was hot and delicious both times. Will definitely go back often!"}
{"text":"This place has great Ramen, and the customizability is awesome--you can pick a basic soup and then add eggs or green onions or whatever your heart desires (though it does get expensive, as each add-on costs extra). It's also BYOB, which is nice. The atmosphere could be a little better--in winter, every time the door opens a gust of cold wind blows through the entire restaurant. Also, the tables smell weird. But I still go here frequently, and would recommend it if you want some hearty noodle soup to warm you up."}
{"text":"I don't go to Ramen Bar very often because my very own, what I thought was original, (delicious!) miso broth recipe tastes identical to their miso broth, but it's a great spot for a comforting bowl of soup. The ramen is not vegan, but they have rice noodles they can substitute. And they have and use TONS of veggies, which is how they sometimes win over my home version. A little pricy, but they don't skimp on ingredients."}
{"text":"Sooooo good! Friendly staff, and lots of options. You can build your own ramen, but try the tan tan men. It's spicy but amazing!"}
{"text":"Food was good. Service was quick and pleasant. Parking is a concern. 

I got the tan tan ramen lots of flavor probably on the spicy side for most people. Ramen texture was good. Didn't have much more than ramen bits of ground meat and spinach in it I added chashu. Chashu was just ok. 

Outside of the restaurant parking is difficult to find. I saw a car getting towed on the street and parking attendants checking plates at the library so make sure you follow all parking rules, markings, and pay (approximately $1/hour)."}
{"text":"I like ramen a great deal but Ramen Bar doesn't quite live up to my expectations. It's just bland... It's not by any means bad and do come here if you're really, really craving for ramen. However, if I am just casually walking down the block looking for a lunch spot this will not be my first choice."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy here. Just decent soup, choice of broth (soy or miso, spicy or not), choice of standard toppings, good selection of appetizers and rice dishes, and also house specialty ramen bowls to choose from.

The interior is clean and fitting. There's a giant picture of a part of Tokyo on the wall, that just adds to the ambiance of the restaurant. I actually can't stop staring at it every time I've dined there. 

Wait staff is attentive, food is hot and your order is done relatively quick. Decent Ramen and a good addition to Squirrel Hill."}
{"text":"Never order takeout or delivery from this place.  They do not stand by their product.  I order delivery a couple times a month from here, and today I received my food and it was totally rancid.  It smelled and tasted sour and fishy.  I contacted the restaurant and they assured me it was perfectly fine and they would not refund me.  I literally spent almost $30 for food I was really looking forward to, and ate 3 bites of it.  I am actually nauseous and have zero appetite from eating that food.  They lost a really good customer in me today.  There are plenty of other places to order from in this city that don't treat you like crap."}
{"text":"For me this is really a 3.5, but I'm inclined to round up since it's probably one of the better ramens you can find around here. The menu is quite extensive in that they have Chinese and Thai style noodle bowls in addition to the more standard Japanese ramen. The price is not too bad, considering the size of the noodle bowl that they give you. Ordering the shoyu \"ramen ramen,\" we found that the noodles were cooked pretty well and weren't too hard or too soft. There was a generous amount of toppings as well, and the chashu pork was actually pretty tender. The only mediocre part of course was the broth--while it was nice and hot, it lacked savoriness and so wasn't particularly memorable. Still, it's a nice place to go for a bowl of noodle soup, and with so many different options available it shouldn't be too hard to find something you like."}
{"text":"Very interesting place... it's called ramen bar but they offer other asian soup noodles reallys. I got the japanese udon noodles with clear broth and my husband got the ramen ramen with spicy miso broth.
To start off, we always get the chicken karaage. The chicken was definitely very tender and juicy inside, but the outside wasn't crunchy enough for me. It felt a little too oily from the outside as well.
The noodle bowls were BIG and will fill you up. But the broth wasn't fantastic and the noodles were just too soft for me. The egg was good though, they have the yolk a little runny stiff."}
{"text":"Ramen! I so love you. A hot delicious broth, soft ramen noodles coupled with a choice of protein and vegetables is such a comfort meal. I frequent ramen bar, especially on those days where the weather is dull and cold.

I love the curry ramen! It reminds me of back home in India where as kids we would gorge upon Nestle's Maggi noodles! :D It is a spicy coconut based curry  with vegetables. I get the curry raksa ramen, and have the beef substituted with chicken. A careful selection of the broth is all what is needed to make your ramen awesome. Since I like spice, I usually would opt for the spicy shoyu or curry.

What I like about ramen bar is that the service is attentive and friendly. Also they can accommodate a wide range of substitution requests. Recently I tried the green tea Mochi for dessert, and I was definitely impressed. Overall, I love it that a place like this exists in our squirrel hill neighborhood."}
{"text":"Ramen that doesn't come out of a crinkly plastic wrapper and cost .11?  Oh, brave new world.  It was suggested we try this here new fangled idea, so we did and...

Holy Shiitake!  (Ha--that's a food joke).  I'm not a foodie, if you can't tell by my reviews--but I know what tastes good, and this place is awesome.  

It's a nice, clean little place--makes me feel a little hip and urban, rural guy that I am, without pretension. The wait staff was quick and moderately attentive without being cloying, or hovering.  We ordered, and it wasn't all that long before steaming vats of food appeared in front of us--think serving bowl size portions of rich deliciousness. I had the Tom Yam Men because I love it, and this version was fantastic--chocked full of noodles and big chunks of stuff and just enough heat to make me wish I'd toted in a sixpack.  

My friends got some other stuff--there was some chatter about authenticity, but I've never been to Japan and couldn't give less damns about what other countries, or even other restaurants, make: I judge based on what's in front of me and kind of sensory kama sutra it performs on my taste buds.  A few months later I went back, and I didn't even care to try anything else: I ate the same damn thing.

You can't ask for more from food.  I'm a 6'3 345 gluttonous libertine and the generous portion left me more sated than a pair of Dutch prostitutes. I'll be back, even if means delaying visits to some of the other promising places on my list."}
{"text":"A great place for the ever changing Pittsburgh weather. Honestly the best miso broth I've had in this city. Disappointed in the eggs but the bowls are huge, service is quick, and it's more than affordable for what you get!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Loved the service and music. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Food is probably 3 stars, but the service ruins the experience. There's a white guy with glasses and a jew-fro who wears a red shirt and has a horrible attitude. We were in awe of how much he seemed to hate being there. That guy needs to be fired."}
{"text":"I ordered a delivery and the curry/rice are already blended together which means that it looks like a messy congee when it arrives and rice has been sticky. Also I could hardly find more than 5 small pieces of chicken in this bowl. Soup is ok."}
{"text":"Ramen Bar offers an array of noodle soups for those not particularly into ramen. They have everything from Kimchi Udon to Tom Yum soup in addition to ramen.

We started with the Pork Gyoza- nothing special, and the dumpling sauce was kinda bland, which was surprising. I got the Tan Tan Men, and he got the Ramen Ramen with Miso broth, and we both agreed it was OK. Broth was lacking depth, but sufficed. Noodles were a tad overdone."}
{"text":"The first time I came here it was before their grand opening, so they were more attentive to how the food turned out. I ordered the Wonton Ramen with shoyu base. It not only had wontons but came with several large pieces of pork which I was pleasantly surprised. The broth was very flavorful and the noodles were a nice texture. I also ordered a Japanese Curry Beef to go. The curry was very flavorful with lots of pieces of beef and not too many onions which is nice. I dislike curry with too many onions. 

The second time I came here I ordered the Mabo Ramen which is essentially Mapo Tofu with Ramen. I expected it to come out more like a sauce but it came out as a soup instead. It was okay. Not as good as the Wonton one but decent.

The third time I came, I was disappointed. It was a few weeks after their grand opening so I guess they became less attentive to the food. I ordered the Midori Yasai Ramen. It was basically just ramen topped with a bunch of boiled vegetables. Not much flavor to it. What disappointed me the most were the noodles. They came out extremely soft and way too soggy. Overcooked noodles are very off-putting."}
{"text":"Family loves this place!  I really like the Curry Ramen. Sometimes there is a wait, yes, but it moves quickly."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to stop in here for years. After getting my routine bubble tea I decided it was time to walk in and try it out. There are so many options on the menu. You can either choose one of the prefab options or you can create your own from the drop down menu. After looking through the entire menu, I decided to create my own:

Spicy Seafood Udon

I really love udon. I don't know why; I normally despise large noodles. There is just something so satisfying about these large noodles; it helps that they are firm. The taste of broth was good and the amount of seafood in the soup was more than enough to make up for the extra price. 

My only concern about the food was the condition of the vegetables, but I did take out for the soup so I figure I should try it out again to see if perhaps the driving distance caused the limp, sogginess of the veggies. I have already recommended this establishment to others."}
{"text":"This is a review of Ramen Bar's food and delivery service. I have never dined in at the restaurant, but have ordered delivery numerous times.

In a few words, Ramen Bar isn't really worth your time, but you can give it a try if you're absolutely craving for ramen. I have had their Tan Tan Men, their Kimchi Udon, their Ramen Ramen, and the Karaage (fried chicken). I really would not consider their ramen authentic 'ramen' as their ramen lacks the richness of broth that is present in good eateries like those of New York. The flavors are acceptable, however, but only acceptable. The karaage (fried chicken) is pretty good. Can't really commend their ramens, unfortunately.

On another note, their delivery service is NOT acceptable. I highly recommend AGAINST ordering from them. Recently I ordered delivery service from them off-peak (around 7:30pm), and it took them over 90 minutes to deliver me my order. I called the restaurant around an hour in, and the person on the phone told me the driver had left a long time ago with my food. This means my food had been sitting in his car for more than 40 minutes by the time I received my food. The driver was unapologetic, and blamed the newness of my residence (it's a new street) for his inability to deliver. He could have CALLED me to ask for cross streets, or asked me for directions, rather than wait for something to happen. By the time my food arrived, the noodles had stuck to themselves already and I had to vigorously pry the strands apart before dining."}
{"text":"Amazing ramen. So tasty. The portion sizes were huge and they serve the ramen with a mini ladle as a spoon. Great service. My only complaint is that the music was absolutely awful and bit loud."}
{"text":"This was my second time trying ramen, woohoo!
We were seated immediately (at a big bar table with other people). I didn't know what to think of that at first, but it still felt pretty intimate. Within minutes of ordering, our food came out too.

There are so many options! The portion sizes are very generous too. I ordered my ramen with shrimp. The only downside was that the shrimp was basically just thrown on top (with the tails) so it didn't have much flavor and it was a little hard to eat with chop sticks.

Overall, this place is SO good. It was just so HOT in there. They had a space heater, and although it's winter.. when you're eating soup it keeps you pretty warm anyways!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery on a Sunday night and was very happy with my choices.  The spring rolls were crispy, hot and flavorful, although much smaller than I imagined.  A side of seaweed with kimchee ramen with rice noodles hit the spot.  I ordered mild spicy level and it had an even heat throughout the meal.  The temperature of the food was hot when it arrived, which I very much appreciated.  

I plan to stop by and eat in soon.  Maybe I should put them on speed dial for late night dinners at home."}
{"text":"Amazing ramen, best in Pittsburgh! My husband and I both had ramen soup (Tan Tan and kimchi ramen) both were delicious with homemade noodles. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The food is great and a good value.  The delivery service has gotten better but can be slow on the weekends."}
{"text":"I love the ramen bar!! It's fast, fresh, and authentic ramen in Pittsburgh.  Huge bonus points from me because almost everything on their menu is veggie/vegan friendly, and if it can't be made so, it is specifically indicated on the menu.  

The vibe is kind of interesting; the walls are a dark grey and decorated with a ramen mummy zombie-walking out of a bowl...and then there are neon candle holders and napkins on all the tables, I suppose to just brighten things up a bit.  More bonus points from me because they played Radiohead AND Django Django while I was dining.  No 90s movie piano soundtrack at this place!

The food may not be anything special to a lot of people, but I love a giant bowl of steaming broth and noodles, especially on a polar vortex day, so it hit the spot for me.  And Rachel C...I totally finished my bowl in one sitting. ;)"}
{"text":"I stopped by here a couple of Saturdays ago with my wife for dinner.  We arrived around at 7:15 to find the restaurant absolutely packed and we were told it would be a 10-15 minute wait.  The inside of Ramen Bar is fairly tiny (seating for 34 at normal tables and a large community table that can seat 14) with tile floors and a ramen \"mummy\" caricature drawn on one wall and a picture of a large Asian city (Tokyo's Shibuya Center?) on the other.  The temperature was in the single digits, so anytime the door was opened a blast of cold air reached our table and probably most of the tables in the restaurant.

For dinner on this evening my wife and I decided to split the takoyaki for an appetizer and then I went with the ajo ramen for my entree.  Our appetizer came out first and consisted of the fried octopus balls covered in bonito flakes amongst other things.  They actually had enough other stuff on them that the balls themselves were hard to see.  That didn't really matter though and my wife and I dug in.  The takoyaki was rather tasty and was crispy on the outside and then soft and chewy in the middle.  My wife and I quickly polished them off and within a short time our ramen arrived.  It was piping hot which was nice as it counteracted any of the cold that was let in by the door.  As a matter of a fact I was left sweating by the time that I had finished my meal. The ramen had a really good flavor to it which mainly consisted of garlic and pork.  My favorite part of it ended up being the crispy garlic which was still tasty even after it got soggy in the broth.  The only complaint I had was that on the menu it was marked as a spicy dish (a pepper next to it) and while I noticed a few red pepper flakes floating around in it I got no heat from it at all.

The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  My wife and I both enjoyed our meals here a lot and I am looking forward to trying more of their ramen dishes."}
{"text":"Can't get enough of this place!  Prices are great and the service is excellent.  I've eaten here like 5 times in the past month.  One of the best places I've tried in the area."}
{"text":"Wow, wow, wow.  Ok, I think I found my new go to spot in Squizzle Hizzle.  Ramen Bar exceeded my expectations, but mostly because when I think \"ramen\" I think, 'the case of noodles under my twin bed my freshmen year of college'.  NOT the case here.  This is not your college ramen friends, this is superb noodles in flavorful broth served piping hot.  

I had the Ramen Wu which was a thick noodle in an egg drop broth.  Full of flavor and a huge serving it warmed me up on a rainy November afternoon.

This place was packed and continued to have a steady stream of people coming in and out.  The space isn't very large which adds to the ambiance of a cozy little soup place.  I'm creating a new adage, and it's, \"There's this cozy little soup place nestled between a fro-yo and shoe store you just have to try.\""}
{"text":"I just had a bowl of tan tan men and literally I could swim in this bowl.  So good.  On a wet rainy day this was exactly what I needed."}
{"text":"Would say save your money. Had the worst and most expensive Japanese curry here."}
{"text":"With cold winter nights ahead, I was on the hunt for soup. Between Chef Chang (a la Netflix) and the ramen trend of NYC, it was time to seek an authentic ramen experience.

Though I don't know the first thing about ramen or kimchi, I know taste and quality... And Ramen Bar hits the mark.

The menu seemed a bit overwhelming with its many options so I chose a chef's special to avoid creating my own combination and a possible ramen disaster. My Ayo Ramen was filled with noodles prepared to order and delicious ingredients. This was definitely not your usual thought of commercial, freeze dried ramen. The soup was hearty, tasty, and more than enough for a big meal.

My boyfriend got the Korean Kimchi Udon to mix it up and since he enjoys a little spice. The noodles were again fantastic and the meal filling and flavorful without being overly hot or salty.

Next time I want soup, I'm getting Ramen Bar."}
{"text":"Comfortable seating, uncluttered walls, fast service and tasty broth. Lots of ramen to choose from. They even have one udon option. So if you're feeling like ramen noodles, this is a great spot. Stars on the menu show their tasty options. If noodles aren't enough, you can side of gyoza dumplings or spring rolls."}
{"text":"I think I found all the Asians (and Asian-food lovers) in Pittsburgh---they are at Ramen Bar!  The place was absolutely PACKED on Friday night.  We got seated at the one big communal table (they have individual tables too) and met some fellow ramen lovers.  They just opened so service was very choppy and the menu is still on photocopied pieces of paper that they asked us to share 1 copy of.  The menu consists of \"make your own ramen\" (pick soup base, type of ramen, extra toppings like egg, corn, nori, etc for a dollar each) or a number of specialty ramens (like kim chee ramen).   

All shortcomings with the service was forgiven as a HUGE bowl of steaming hot ramen with all of my requested fixings appeared before me.  Not the most amazing bowl of ramen I have ever had, but it really hit the spot on that cold December night.

And if the owners are reading, I suggest switching from the plastic ladles (not good dipped into boiling hot broth) to the traditional Asian soup spoon!"}
{"text":"Ramens pretty good. Broth is pretty light so it tastes.. healthier? Isn't too busy either so it's a good place to get some quick noodles."}
{"text":"AMAZING ramen! Quick service, although there's sometimes a wait to be seated but it's worth it, I promise! Huge portions and savory quality food."}
{"text":"Being a native San Franciscan, perhaps my taste buds have been a tad spoiled by the array of noodle shops in the City. Sadly, I've found Ramen Bar to just be okay. However, if I could rate them on their ambiance and set-up in general,  I would've given them 5-stars. Everything from the beautiful backdrop of Ginza in the back to the unique lighting provides an intimate setting for a date or just a get together with a close friend. But, back on tangent...

They have a nice selection of appetizers, ramen, and rice dishes. I've tried most of their rice dishes and have found them to be pretty good. Their tenshindon stands out the most, with its most fluffy eggs and tender shrimp covered in a thick sweet and tangy sauce. It's an absolute delight to my mouth and taste buds. Their curry is a bit lacking, as I can taste is the kick of the spice, but not so much in terms of actual flavor. Their ramen is acceptable. You have a choice of miso or shouyu (soy sauce) base along with you choice of toppings. There are a few set selections of ramen that you can choose from as well, if you don't feel like creating your own bowl. The noodles are on point, soft, but with a slight chew. The stock is a bit bland in comparison to a traditional bowl of ramen, where chefs try to pack as much flavor in the soup to bring the all the flavors of the toppings and noodles together. What also bugged me was the fact that their wontons were always undercooked in the part where the dough seals together, but is severely overcooked elsewhere. 

Overall, I was a bit disappointed, as this place looked quite promising. I'd go back for their rice dishes and the ambiance if I were in the area. However, I wouldn't venture all the way to Sq. Hill just to go there."}
{"text":"Ramen Bar delivers everything you want about a ramen place. The service is quick, tables and seating are nice, there is a cool Japanese culture vibe about it (even though Chinese people run it), and of course, the ramen is good. Most ramen places have the just-right, chewy ramen noodles, as does Ramen Bar, but what separates this place from others is the meat and the soup. Meat is cooked so that it's still very juicy, which is hard to come across, and it's flavored very well. It might be on the salty side for people who like bland foods but as someone who craves flavor, I loved the meat. And then the soup --- wow. It has a really deep and hearty feel to it. You can really taste the broth, and it doesn't have too many particles and random veggies that usually end up in the yuck pile.

Awesome experience for me, and I can't wait to try the other soup and meat combinations for ramen they have to offer."}
{"text":"Three star worthy ramen. The broth as ok, and the noodles and flavor were slightly strange, but as ramen goes, it wasn't the worst, But it also wasn't the best"}
{"text":"We had walked past several times (always after having eaten elsewhere) and the pictures in the window were always eye catching so finally we visited this little noodle shop yesterday for lunch. I ordered the Japanese udon noodle soup (thick udon noodles, shiitake mushrooms, green and white onions, carrots, broccoli, and chicken in a clear broth). The soup was served in a gigantic bowl, piping hot. I would have liked maybe a little more flavor to the broth but I really can't complain-it was so fresh and tasty! My dining companion ordered the curry raksa ramen (which is what I originally wanted but I thought the spice might be a little much for me and was I right!) and added an egg and chicken to it. He made the comment he would have liked the udon noodles in his dish instead of the ramen but that was his only complaint. He said it was spicy but the sweetness of the coconut curry really toned down the spice and the flavors melted together amazingly. We both can't wait to come back and try other menu items since everything looked so yummy!"}
{"text":"Ramen Bar is a welcome addition of Japanese food to the Pittsburgh area. Unfortunately, me and my roommate are both from California, so we have very high expectations of ramen.

The portion were a bit on the small side, and the flavor wasn't anything spectacular. They charge extra for things that are usually given in normal ramen--like egg, etc. 

The decor was cute and the servers were nice. The food wasn't anything special though so I doubt I will feel a need to head back to Ramen Bar with so many better Asian restaurants surrounding it."}
{"text":"Fast delivery, food taste great, nice amount of food for price! Will order again definitely!!"}
{"text":"Ok, so if you don't incorporate parking and limited seating, this place is pretty good. It's exactly what you expect every time. No surprises. I've tried most things on the menu and it tastes exactly the way it's described on the menu. The broths are flavorful, there's plenty of sauces to add, if you must and it's more than enough food. Definitely good if you're in the mood for Ramen."}
{"text":"I may be spoiled having lived in Seattle last year and had some amazing ramen there and I was really excited to see this place open, but I was so disappointed.  I ordered the kim chi ramen that comes with chicken, kim chi, and green onions with a shoyu base.  There only 2 choices for base in the whole menu, shoyu or miso, which is disappointing.  I agree with others that it is lacking the tonkotsu base which authentic ramen places typically have.  Also the extra ingredients al la carte list is really limited, though when I asked about fish cakes and mushrooms (not on the list) they actually did have them and let me add them (though didn't have different varieties of fish case or mushrooms as most places would have).  I'm really glad I added extra because the amount of chicken I was given was pathetic--just a few miniscule pieces of poor quality chicken (gristly, dry, all dark meat).  The green onions were also few and cut longways in huge pieces.  And there was only a few pieces of kim chi apparent.  And the sauce other than the flavor of the kim chi was completely bland.  It tasted like boiling water with a little bit of kim chi flavor in it.  It was thin and not complex or interesting at all.  And after spending $15 on it, it is much pricier than much better ramen I've had elsewhere.  The decor was nice and service friendly, but not enough to make up for the disappointing ramen :(

UPDATE:  I went back again and will upgrade this to 3 stars since what I had this time was much better and more flavorful.  I think it was called the Yan Tan Men? and it had ground beef and spinach with a spicy orange broth.  I don't know what was in the broth exactly but it was way more tasty and flavorful than what I had last time.  But my issues from the earlier review still remain.  I think this place has potential though and I'll give it some time."}
{"text":"A small and friendly ramen joint. Only shoyu and miso options for the soup base (both available in tasty spicy varieties), but lots of menu add-ons, and for little extra cost. 

The soft eggs were cooked correctly each time and the noodles were quite delicious. 

Never been to Japan, but from all of the accounts from friend who have been, I feel I have at least a minimal grasp on how proper ramen should qualify. 

If you like noodles, go here."}
{"text":"I've finally gotten my ramen noodle fix!

I had the spicy curry soup and I wasn't a huge fan but that's partly my fault. I thought the curry was going to be more of a thai curry but this was closer to an indian curry. It was alright, but I wouldn't order it again. The beef in it was like chewing shoe leather and the shrimp was a laughable portion. 

My friend got a cold noodle dish and it was absolutely amazing! I would definitely come back for that or to try a different soup. The vegetable gyoza was bland, and the fried chicken app was boring as well except for the sauce that came with it. The place showed promise so I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed that this establishment is not honoring the 3 mile radius set on it's website. I live 2.4 miles away and because of my street and zipcode the man I spoke with claims that it is too far. He actually acted as if he'd never heard of Wilkinsburg. Update your radius! I could easily drive but was hoping to relax. The run around I received on the phone left a bad taste and now I don't even want to dine in. I called because of a substitution I wanted to make and couldn't be sure it would come across on the site. I am now wondering what would happen if I ordered online without calling? Would you refuse to deliver my food????"}
{"text":"Had a thoroughly delightful bowl of ramen with vegetables and tofu here a just before the Holidays in 2013. I must say that I am so glad to see more Asian restaurants taking off in PGH! This is a great addition to the scene. Now if we can only get a 'real' dim sum place..."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I just got back from a trip to Asia and we're craving some good ramen.  Unfortunately they don't have tonkatsu ramen (and looks like nowhere in Pittsburgh does yet- sigh), but they had some other good choices to satisfy the craving.

I got the curry raksa ramen and my boyfriend built his own with the spicy miso base.  Both of our bowls were flavorful, not salty, just deep flavor.  The bowls are huge, so definitely worth the money.  Noodles were good, not to over cooked which a lot of ramen places tend to do.  We will definitely go back and would get the same two ramens!

Docking a star because they don't have tonkatsu ramen.  It's everywhere in Tokyo so pretty disappointing that it is so difficult to find in Pittsburgh!!"}
{"text":"No idea if the food is any good since I have been waiting 1.5 hours for my delivery (initial guy who took my order said 20 minutes). I've called 3 more times and the guy keeps on saying the delivery guy is en route (it's no more then 10 minutes from the restaurant to my place). Needless to say I will not be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"If there's only one thing that you can take away from this review, let it be that Ramen Bar is awesome and everyone should go. My boyfriend and I paid a visit last Sunday while we were visiting Pittsburgh, and we were both so happy we did! 

We started off with the pork gyoza, which were perfectly fried and tasted almost exactly like my homemade Korean dumplings (mondu/mandu for the purists out there), which was a welcome surprise and we both loved them. My boyfriend got the tom yum ramen with tofu and I got the tan tan men with tofu. Too good, y'all, omg.  My tan tan men was just spicy enough, and the noodles were perfect. The tofu was also especially tasty, something that we weren't expecting - it was cut in rather large cubes, but was gorgeously silky and took on the flavor of the broth well. It was awesome.

The service is fast and friendly, and the space is well-decorated and cozy (we really liked the noodle mummy on the wall!). Heads up, seating is a little limited - there's a large table that can fit many people, but it looks like the staff also use it to seat smaller parties (almost like at hibachis, without the rice-flinging man in the middle). Also parking can admittedly be difficult, so be sure to factor that in. That being said, it was super super worthwhile experience AND the prices were reasonable: 10/10 would recommend everyone give it a go!"}
{"text":"I had a very good experience here. I brought two of my friends new to ramen and the waitress explain everything thing to them. I had the tan tan men, and it was pretty good i though the broth would have a little bit more taste and have bit more of kick but still good. The service there was excellent. Would definitely come again."}
{"text":"Not worth your money. They skimp on the meat, they don't give you an egg, and broth isn't as flavorful or rich as other ramen places."}
{"text":"There wasn't enough bad things about the place to drop it to a 3 for me. I've been here a few times each experience similar to the last. The appetizers are pretty good and come out pretty quick. The pork gyoza is great hot. The build your own bowl leaves a lot to be desired but that's the execution when you build your own bowl and I think the place gets a bad rep because of it.

 I think the add-ons can be priced differently. Perhaps separated into categories or combined so a few add-ons are free then you are charged for extra. The reason being, if you add all the shtuff that make a good Ramen, you end up with an overpriced bowl and if you don't you end up with a bowl missing it's  flavor. 

That all being said if you order their dishes and don't make your own you end up with a pretty darn good bowl of ramen (granted ramen is meant to be cheap and this isn't really).

My favorite is the tan tan men with an egg and mushrooms added.
If you are sick go here and grab a bowl, loaded with antioxidants(especially with added onion,shoots and mushrooms) and liquids you'll be back to 100% in no time. I swear by it."}
{"text":"Clean space. Wood tables and chairs. Service is good. Food good. Dim lighting In the restaurant They don't carry any brown rice that's a minus for me but overall a decent place to grab some food"}
{"text":"Great place! Ramen is good, though you really can't go wrong with ramen. Dine-in is nice, interesting vibe with the ramen mummy & the cute candles on the tables. Delivery is pretty slow, took more than an hour and a half for gyoza and one order of ramen to arrive.

Love that it's so close to CMU."}
{"text":"This place was awesome! Driving here I didn't know what to expect parking-wise and was relieved to find a spot on the street. Walking into the place was very pleasant. The decor is nice, with a large mural of a boy wrapped in ramen on one of the walls. It reminded me of the mummy from the Groovy Ghoulies! We got two seats at the large table toward the back of the restaurant. At first I didn't think I would like it there but it turned out great - I think better than a traditional table. The ramen tasted great, and was a great way to warm us up on this cold, rainy Pittsburgh afternoon. My wife, who grew up on this stuff, was happy to see fish cake as an option. I am really liking the ramen options in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"It's your standard ramen bar.  Decent, but not the best I've had.   That being said Pittsburgh doesn't have a lot of ramen options so this is it.   If it's a cold day and your in the mood for ramen come here, it'll get the job done."}
{"text":"It's average. I've had more Ramen in Japan than any foreigner should consume. This place fills that \"I miss the Japananese Ramen and feel like settling with a average approximate\" niche. I'd probably drive to Toronto instead of going back to this place if I want real Ramen."}
{"text":"My dad and I often frequent here after my cello lessons nearby and they never disappoint. We come here almost weekly and there's always something new for us to try. My staples are the vegetable ramen and the Japanese udon noodles which are both very good. They give generous portions  (there's always enough for leftovers) and service is prompt and friendly. We will continue visiting! This place is definitely worth a try :)"}
{"text":"Went there 3 times. Takoyaki is highly recommended and there is real octopus in it. The shrimp dumplings are so delicious! I like the black pepper noodle. But make sure you avoid Ten Shindon Rice unless you know what it is. Also the Chinese translation to Ten Shindon Rice is incorrect. The Japanese Udon is insipid. Will try more kinds of ramen in the future. Plus I really like the street shot of Tokyo on the wall."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, especially for dinner on a Friday night. The tan tan men (seafood or regular) are my go to dish here. The ramen broth is always rich and the noodles are so soft that you can slurp them down without chewing on them. I have also tried their delivery and while the delivered food is not as good as eating at the shop, it's still delicious."}
{"text":"I stopped by for lunch.  Only have 30 mins so its nice to get a yummmy but quickly delivered ramen.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"I had an excellent experience at the Ramen Bar.
On the first day of snow and cold outside, this hit the spot and warmed me up."}
{"text":"Amazing ramen! Good service. A little awkward with the Christian music. Not order and appetizer the ramen is so filling. 

Spicy broth is a mild spicy, easy to eat. Pork dumplings amazing."}
{"text":"I've visited here three times now, and each time I've been seriously underwhelmed. I don't hate it. Like the two-star rating says, \"Meh. I've experienced better.\" 

I've tried both the shoyu- and miso-based broths and each time I've left feeling unimpressed. I'd be willing to pay more for an impressive bowl of ramen, but it just seems like they're using canned chicken stock or something and adding either soy-sauce or miso, tossing in meat, noodles and whatever toppings that are requested. 

The portions are huuuge. I haven't been able to finish a bowl of ramen here yet... but taking home leftover ramen feels pretty silly, since the noodles will expand and be weird and soggy by the time you're hungry again... so it ends up feeling wasteful to me. :( 

The seating and interior are pretty cramped, with a huge communal table toward the the back. I don't know if installing such a huge communal table was the best idea, because it really dominates that back space there.

Service was prompt and friendly, but when I go out to eat, the most important thing to me is food. I can't say with confidence that the ramen here is remarkable. It's pretty good for the first few bites, but then I end up getting bored in the middle, and don't finish ever it. I can't say with confidence that I would come back here by choice, but wouldn't object if someone else was excited to go/give it a try."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. I'm not a ramen expert, but I'm a huge fan. I had the curry Raska it had a good spicy level and I've tried the tan tan men both bomb. Servers are super friendly too!!"}
{"text":"Before I forget about it, I have to write this review. 

The decor at this place is nice, environment is clean, and service is good... the quantity of food is decent, BUT the quality is... meehh. 

Noodles were over-cooked. Broth is bland. Chashu is worse than amateur. Egg is not cooked very well either. It is very nice to see Pittsburgh to have a dedicated ramen place; however, this place needs to get serious about the food.

If you are craving for a hot soup in a cold day, this might be a good place to go."}
{"text":"Do not get the basic ramen here! Their specials are where it's at, otherwise you might be disappointed. 

Seeing as its the only ramen restaurant in Pittsburgh, Ramen Bar has the market cornered. Decent food, but the basic ramen could be a bit more interesting (or cheaper, if it's not going to be interesting)."}
{"text":"If striving for mediocracy - job well done.  

Def would not recommend delivery."}
{"text":"The food is horrible.  The beef in my udon soup was reminiscent of boot leather.  You're way better off cracking open a can of Campbell's Chunky soup."}
{"text":"Ramen Bar, it took me two years for me to collect the courage to go in, and it did not disappoint me. Pretty basic stuff, just ramen and basic soup base, and that is indeed the essence of ramen. Udon is always nice. Last night I tried something more exciting: Mabo ramen, which is ramen with a soup base of mapo tofu (spicy soft tofu). Was an adventure and it went well. I get takoyaki here every single time and it's always served at very good conditions. Overall, not a special ramen place but definitely somewhere to consider if you feel like having a warm bowl of noodles."}
{"text":"Really really good ramen bar!!! I am one of the regular customers who come to Ramen bar already 2 years. Good service, good food))
I brought all my friends here)
Highly recommend Tan tan men and Tan tan seafood ramenenjoy!"}
{"text":"Nom nom. Good Asian food is hard to come by in this city and this was definitely a contender. A large bowl will feed two if you're hungry and it'll feed four if you just want something light.

VENUE: Located on cute and quaint little Squirrel Hill, this place is cozy and small. Perfect for an intimate date, or a casual bite with a small group of friends. My friends and I came around dinner time and the ambience was nice. The quiet hustle and bustle of the kitchen didn't detract from the overall calm atmosphere. Lighting (as with many restaurants around dinner) was dim and we were seated at a high top table large enough to seat 10. There were four of us so we shared it with two other parties. There was enough space in between the groups that it didn't feel like we were invading someone else's group nor did we feel encroached upon. I'd say most of the quietness came from the fact that everyone seemed to be enjoying their ramen too much to talk.

FOOD: My friends and I split a large bowl of Spicy Veggie Ramen w/Shoyu broth. We added wontons, egg, shrimp, and tofu. It was DELICIOUS. The soup was nice and flavorful and noodles were perfectly cooked. Veggies were seasoned well. Tofu didn't fall apart, the egg was hardboiled, and wontons had a good amount of meat in them. Shrimp was good (they leave the tail for those of you like to eat every bit of it), and the whole thing gave me just enough warmth the brave the cold that night. I wish  it was spicier (as I am a self-proclaimed chili head) but for those of you who just want a little kick, this is a good pick.

SERVICE: As is the case with all my friends, when we congregate sometimes we get a bit obnoxious. I think we were having a little too much fun picking and choosing from the menu and we were laughing quite a bit. We were a bit ridiculous with our order (in terms of how we wanted it to be split/served) but our server was extremely patient and helpful. The owner even recognized us as having just come from his other establishment, Rose Tea Cafe, and was even more accomodating. 

The bowl came out to be maybe $15? and was an excellent choice (both in taste and portion) for a hankering of something warm on a cold Pittsburgh night."}
{"text":"Ended up getting the tan tan seafood ramen with \"less salt\" and it came out perfect , well balanced and very flavorful dish. It is a bit spicy but very flavorful, definitely recommend it. Looking forward to trying other dishes here. The service was friendly and the place was clean."}
{"text":"Located on Forbes in Squirrelhill.  Parking, as always, a challenge.  Having lives in Japan for years I think I expect a bit more spice and smaller brocholi cuts.  Place is small, staff very helpful.  The soup \"spoon\" is a ladel and not an actual ramen soup spoon.  Very clumsy to use for me at least. Fun decore however.  Open and well lighted."}
{"text":"Expensive, but food is consistent and pretty filling. I've had alot better ramen, but in Pittsburgh, choices are limited people. So if ramen is what you're craving, this is the de facto place."}
{"text":"Love this place! I've been here several times before, and I can't help but get the egg drop ramen every time. 

Seating can be tough because it's a small place, so it might be better to go at a time when there isn't a lunch or dinner rush. 

There's a lot of different options--you can try some of their specialty ramen or you can customize your own. 

Service is fast and friendly, and portions are huge, which make the price worth it."}
{"text":"I decided to head to the Ramen Bar after work because it has been on my \"must try\" list of restaurants in Squirrel Hill. I was a bit apprehensive about ordering Ramen noodles for 9-11 dollars. I mean really, they are .25 cents at the store! But I decided to forgo my penny pinching ways and just go to the Ramen Bar. 

When I walked in the host station was in the back of the restaurant, odd, but not off putting in any way. I walked toward it and the one server/host asked me, with a bit of a weird tone, what I needed. Now, maybe she meant take out or dine in, but that question was just a bit odd to me. I told her that I wanted to sit down and eat, and that it was just me and my other party was on their way. She told me to sit anywhere. 

I sat and looked over the menu. Simple and to the point. I ordered some pot stickers and the Curry Ramen. The pot stickers were amazing. Such a great flavor, the perfect combination of a sweet and meaty taste. They came six to an order and they were a big six. 

The Curry Ramen was very good. The broth was delicious even if I was expecting it to be a little spicier. But while it was not spicy it was still flavorful. The pork was done perfectly and plenty of it in the bowl! No skimping around here! The vegetables were done so they still had shape and texture to them but still cooked thoroughly. I almost ate my entire bowl! It was very filling and really a good time.

The food was good, don't get me wrong, but would I make it a regular spot to go back to? No probably not. But would I go again? Yes, I would.

{"text":"For Pittsburgh standards, this place is awesome. I grew up in Asia, lived there most of my life, so I have high standards when it comes to ANY Asian restaurant in the states... especially in Pittsburgh where good Asian food is difficult to find. Anyway, their ramen is good! I suggest the Tan Tan Men ramen, it's the best one I've tried from them. It's fairly spicy but that's a good thing.  Also, get the Chicken Karage, it's crispy delicious! I also like the Kimchi ramen but I only reccomend this if you already like Kimchi to begin with. 

The staff is super nice and the place looks clean and well-managed. Definitely going back for more!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, they always remember you from the last visit. Great variety of Ramen, always fresh and hot.Highly recommended !"}
{"text":"The attitude of the deliverers is one to note.
Tips are given based on the customer's capability to spend and want.
To that note, I'm a college student and I certainly do not have money to be thrown around.
Even when dining (rarely) at expensive places, I keep tips to a minimum, as it is not my duty to pay the waiters/waitresses. If the bill reflects the service charge and we're told beforehand, I'll be perfectly willing to shell out the buck, through an informed decision, reflected in the bill.

So when the minute bill, from Ramen Bar was followed by a delivery boy asking for a tip and then telling me I should go to the restaurant and pickup the food myself, because he doesn't want to drive far (2miles) without a tip, I'm probably never gonna order from this place again, let alone dine in. 
As well as another situation, in which the delivery person asked me to pay for the gas for the car through tips for the delivery, however, the person was more respectful, so I let that slide.
However, when I was told I should go to the restaurant myself, I was done.

Ramen bar, please pay your delivery staff properly, so that they don't come begging to the customers for their wage and transport."}
{"text":"Gyoza tasty.  Unfortunately, the pork wonton ramen -- noodles were overcooked and wonton were undercooked.   Broth ok, but not as rich and delicious as I would like, like the real ramen places.  Maybe 2.75 stars."}
{"text":"Returned a year later and the place is still good in my book! So I gave them a 5th star.  Wish that they had even more topping options, but I do like that there are different variations of the traditional ramen plus other kinds of soups and noodles/rice too. A+ And I love their wallpaper! 

(This year I brought my own beer too!)"}
{"text":"This was our first time here and I did not know what to order. The waiter recommended a few dishes and the one I went with (the Tan Tan) was excellent. It was a curry and coconut broth with spinach and beef and of course spicy. I loved it."}
{"text":"I had been meaning to try Ramen Bar for a few years now, so I was ecstatic to finally do so yesterday and make a proper occasion of it with friends.

In a town lacking ramen options, Ramen Bar fills the void as a modernized ramen restaurant. Yelpers looking for a solely traditional experience may want to look elsewhere, as RB's ramen selection includes both traditional favorites and fusion-influenced bowls (Curry, Tom Yum, Kimchi, etc. flavors). Additionally, there are a number of vegetarian and vegan options.

I settled on the seafood Tantan-men, which came highly recommended. The heap of shrimp, scallops, mussels, and squid were excellent, but the true winner was the broth. Rich, complex, savory, and the perfect amount of spice. I felt compelled to sip to the bottom.

Restaurant-wise: comfortably dim-lit, casual atmosphere, and a very cool juxtaposition of wall-art and urban photography, which completes the modern feel. The waitstaff was very helpful, attentive, and polite.

Overall, I'd say Ramen Bar stacks up nicely compared to more well-known, modern ramen restaurants out on the coasts. I can't wait to return and try other options...and maybe take home some more Tantan-men too :D"}
{"text":"So good that I came to Ramen Bar three times in a row - Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. Staff is very friendly and are more than happy to explain the menu and provide recommendations especially if you're a first time Ramen Bar visitor, and food comes out very quickly, and the quality is great.

During my visits to Ramen Bar, I tried the following dishes:
Friday - Takoyaki, Wonton Men with a spicy shouyu broth plus corn and an egg,
Saturday - Vegetable Ramen with a spicy shouyu broth alongside Japanese Fried Rice.
Sunday - Kim Chi Udon.

The takoyaki arrived piping hot, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside with a squid flavoring - a perfect appetizer to accompany a giant bowl of ramen. The Japanese fried rice with chicken was also freshly prepared and outstanding - much better than the typical fried rice one would get from a takeout Chinese restaurant - it was very similar to hibachi styled fried rice. 

The spicy shouyu broth is flavorful and definitely worth trying if you want a light, yet hearty broth. It has a nice heat to it that very slowly builds on you as you eat - perfect thing to get if you're coming down with a cold. The pork wontons in my Wonton Men were lightly filled with pork, and the ramen noodles were fresh, perfectly cooked, and remained al dente throughout my entire meal. The roasted pork was very soft and flavorful, and the addition of the egg with runny yolk adds a new level the giant bowl of flavors.

The menu offers a large selection of items so it's almost impossible to get tired of this place, especially with all of the different ingredients you can add to the ramen."}
{"text":"I had a tan tan noodle there. It was good. But I think that they are kind of on the price side. I never been in the noodle store that you have to pay extra for every single ingredient they added in there when you already paid almost $10 fo a bowl of noodle."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery and it took an hour and a half. When the driver arrived, he pointed out that he had spilled my soup and it was pooling in the bottom of the bag. We were hungry so I took it to see what I could salvage. When we opened the bag, all the food dropped to the floor. I ran back out, grabbed the driver and asked him to take the remnants of the food back and return my money. I'll never order from here again."}
{"text":"I love this place! I've never ordered anything from the Ramen Bar that I haven't enjoyed. The food is always cooked well and everything tastes quite awesome.

Of course, I am tremendously white and very American, so I have no way to speak to its authenticity as traditional Japanese cuisine. But I do know that it tastes good to me. 

I've given four stars because the restaurant itself is quite small and can get incredibly crowded during the weekend. I have minor claustrophobia, so this was a little uncomfortable for me once when I ate there during dinner rush on a Saturday night. 

I recommend trying to go there during the week or during a not rush hour if you have any claustrophobia. Because when it isn't super full, the small restaurant is quite nice and cozy!

Definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Squirrel Hill!"}
{"text":"If you're new to this type of cuisine like I was, definitely give it a try. I was hesitant because my only other experience with ramen was instant ramen. They are absolutely NOT the same thing. They shouldn't be allowed to have the same name it is a completely different food. That being said, definitely give this place a try. It exceeded all of my expectations and was super delicious. The perfect food and my new go to for whenever I'm battling a cold. I usually go for the Tan Tan Man and I would definitely recommend it - but watch out, it's spicy. I will be back to Ramen Bar again and again. I love it."}
{"text":"One of my favorite casual restaurants in Pittsburgh. Their Tan Tan Men and Kimchi Udon dishes are to die for. Great, big, filling bowl of piping hot soup with phenomenal asian flavors is hard to beat. Plus, the service is really quick so if you are starving but still want to grab a quick dinner out it's perfect. The portions are very generous, I always have great leftovers to take home!"}
{"text":"I came here with two other people.  Of the three of us I felt like I was the biggest fan of this place.  I liked the decor and I liked the food.  I had a Ramen bowl with pork and miso soup.  Oh man, that broth was so flavorful.  I was so full but I couldn't stop myself from finishing the whole thing.  Next time I'd ask for the same dish but without pork.  I felt the pork was tough, didn't really add anything flavor wise, and got in the way of my noodles!  The noodles and veggies were also delicious.  I heard the Ramen with the dumplings in it was delicious and so was the tofu.  

The ambiance is a mix of casual and intimate.  I would recommend going here for a first date or when you're trying to figure out if you like the person or not.  It's just enough to be cute but not too much where it feels like a real date.  

If you're vegan, this place is very vegan friendly.  The server was helpful with stating which dishes were vegan or could be made vegan.  Any place where the servers even know what vegan means gets a win in my book."}
{"text":"First time having ramen in Pittsburgh! There were so many options to choose from. I had to go for a spicy dish so I tried the tan tan men. The food came out right away which is the best thing about ramen because it's always ready. I added an egg to the dish for an extra $1 because the eggs in ramen are always so delicious. The tan tan men is a must if you like spicy. It was just perfect for my tastebuds and was really happy with the flavor. I was so full after eating it as well which is also another perk of ramen, SO MUCH FOODDD!!! Definitely a 5 star rating for me, no complaints!"}
{"text":"We came late on a Saturday night and did not have to wait at all.

The service was both up and down. We had some staff who were incredibly friendly and out going while our main waitress was gruffy and looked like she wanted to beat someone up but her mood seemed to lighten up towards the end.

Their gyozas were good, and I ordered their Ajo or garlic ramen as my main. If you love garlic, you will enjoy this dish as much as I do though I might not suggest this dish for a first date, unless you bring some gum! The portions are large, the meat/egg and vegetables were cooked fine, and the broth itself had dried garlic chips and a handful of whole garlic cloves so you will be all about garlic.

This was perfect for a cold night, and BYOB."}
{"text":"There's no such thing as bland ramen. You must be doing something wrong. Ramen Bar ain't doing it right, yinz. I've had pretty good ramen in my days so this is easily the worst I've had. There's not a tonkotsu option...meaning there's no option for deliciousness. 

I took my friend from Madison here and she loved it. It was her first ramen rodeo so I can forgive her for not trying Madison's way better version, Umami. 

The appetizer selection was good though and we all enjoyed the fried octopus balls and potstickers. Our food came out pretty fast and our waiter was good at explaining all the different types of ramen. I just think the broth was way too thin for authentic ramen and there was a lack of the marinated egg, seaweed and pretty much everything that makes ramen iconic. Ugh. Pretty disappointed."}
{"text":"I love this place! They never disappoint. The staff is always extremely friendly and attentive. We typically come for dinner and have never had trouble getting a seat, even on the busiest nights. I always get the midori yasai ramen w/ an egg and it is delicious. Simple, but filling!"}
{"text":"First time here and I got the curry ramen bowl. I like more spice and flavor to my curry so once I added sriracha I was in love! Cute place with an adorable mummy artwork made of noodles on the wall. Good portions :) I ate my leftovers the next day for lunch!"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant at the moment. The curry raksa and tan tan-men are excellent. The portions are huge!"}
{"text":"I had the miso broth. it was okay.. the waiter said it would have more of a seafood taste but it tasted just like miso soup.  the portions are huge though! i would recommend sharing the ramen and ordering some other appetizers they have on the menu."}
{"text":"Loved this place!  Great memories of getting Ramen in Japan.  Prices reasonable.  Great fun and great meal with the family."}
{"text":"Not a bad ramen spot fof Pittsburgh, but everything was pretty salty. I had the shoyu ramen and it was good, but a little salty and the chashu was really tough and not good. The gyoza was too sweet, and the fried rice was extremely salty. 

When we let the server know, he just said \"oh I think it's salty too but that's how we make it here\". We just wanted to give our feedback so the reply was a little odd.

Overall decent ramen, but be prepared for the sodium intake."}
{"text":"I would give this place 5 stars, I really would. The portions are just right, the ramen always tastes amazing, esp. the Tan-tan men. The service is good, etc. But the last three times I've been there have given me the runs. I'm Indian and like most indians I generally have a cast iron stomach and can take a 7 out of 10 spice level at most places, so it's def not the spiciness of the food. You guys really need to be careful with your meats, b/c otherwise your food is worth the price."}
{"text":"The Ramen Bar is pretty overrated. I went there for my second time last night, albeit the first experience wasn't great either. I ordered a tom yum seafood ramen, which later proved to be quite disappointing.

To start off, there was very little seafood flavor in the broth. The squid was bland and had a rubbery texture, which makes you wonder how they prepare the seafood. On top of that, the broth was virtually flavorless, even though it had so many ingredients in it. The most flavorful bite of the night was the cilantro on top as garnish. Needless to say, I was pretty disappointed that a bowl of ramen with essentially no flavor whatsoever costed $13."}
{"text":"I am impressed. I spent 2 years in Okinawa and this is the closest I have gotten in America. I will say the miso flavor wasn't prevalent enough in the tan tan but still good. The biggest negative was the add ones get pricey. Seaweed, and eggs don't come in the ramen dishes"}
{"text":"Ramen Ramen with rice noodles is my go-to order! Huge bowls of ramen and i always have leftovers for lunch the next day!"}
{"text":"I'm so into noodles. I love me a big carb-o-licious pile of noodles! So the concept of this joint really spoke to me. 

I saw the three star rating with proceeded with caution, but I really wanted it to impress me. I enjoy that you can pretty much \"build your own ramen\" bowl. I wanted lots of veggies and shrimp. So with that I ordered the spicy veggie bowl with shrimp. Simple, right?

It comes in a ginormous bowl that you couldn't possibly finish in one sitting. No problem, I'm okay with leftovers. Everything looked perfect. Lots of veggies, lots of noodles and fresh shrimp. But... the flavor. It was not there. 

You can choose between the soy or miso based broth. Maybe that's where I went wrong. I find that sometimes I'm not into miso broth, so I went with the soy base. Was that the mistake then for real? Not sure, but what I was sure of is that it was off. It just needed some oomph. 

Sad, because like I said, I really wanted it to be something. I think with my leftovers I'm going ot pepper it up (literally, with pepper) and try and spice it up a bit. Will I be back? Maybe, but I'll order something different and give it another go round."}
{"text":"not authentic Japanese ramen. everyday noodles is much better. will never go to Ramen bar again."}
{"text":"I love asian food.  I love new restaurants.  I love soup.  I love ramen, and if you're out there reading this, I love you too.

When I first tried Ramen bar right after they opened they were a little slow, having been back a few times since, the food's been consistently great, and the service and speed are now excellent.  I'd come here anytime, and the menu is varied enough that there's a wide variety of styles to try (and customize).  I almost look forward to cold days now as a perfect excuse to warm up with a massive cauldron of Ramen's Bar's delicious creations!"}
{"text":"Agree with others, a not so great ramen place. I rather make my own from a package. They also charged me the wrong price but won't change the receipt just \"sorry\" after charging my card. What a disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Good portion size. Curry ramen noodle soup was a bit spicer than I expected, but good nonetheless."}
{"text":"Ajo. Ramen.

No, it's not traditional. I don't care. It's freaking delicious, as is everything I've tried at this shop. The waitstaff isn't particularly friendly, but they are quick and efficient, which is appreciated. The prices are a bit steep, especially if you want to add in an egg (NOM) or other goodies, but with limited competition in Pittsburgh, that's the way the nori crumbles. We aren't in San Fran, but it's still darn good soup, and with the weather we've had this winter, it's appreciated."}
{"text":"I come here to treat myself, especially after rough weeks and tough exams. I haven't had authentic ramen, but it's delicious to me, and the service is great. My favorite is the curry ramen, and many of my friends have defaulted to the Ramen Wu. A bit on the pricey side."}
{"text":"wonderful place for a quick lunch with fair price.

love ramen wu!"}
