{"text":"This place is great for brunch. The best bacon of my life!!! big thick cuts of candied bacon. A tall stack of Gluten free ricotta-lemon pancakes that were awesome. We could not finish our food, but I tried- it was too good to leave.  I am definitely going back."}
{"text":"Best brunch in the area hands down.  Creative recipes and great service.   Recommended."}
{"text":"I've been here twice for brunch and am in love!   I had the ricotta lemon pancakes which were heavenly, light and delicious! they come covered in a blueberry coulis and come with a side of thickly cut smeared in maple bacon. It's delicious!  All the menu items are very well thought out, and the staff is very friendly.   You can tell that the people here love what they do and their food shows it!"}
{"text":"Excellent Wine bar located in the heart of the Monkland Village. Very good food menu along with weekly table d'hote and wide choice of wines including specialty imports to this restaurant as well as vins biologiques.  I have to say the waitstaff are exceptional; all extremely professional and charming, as welcoming to us as to the people ordering full meals. I'd highly recommend this place to anyone who likes a blend of original & traditional flavours as well as great service. The menu is so interesting and inviting - I'll be going back many times to try all the dishes that caught my eye!"}
{"text":"Great ambience and welcoming staff. Good wine menu and a nice fusion styled menu. Sapporo on tap, which is always a bonus. We had the steak and salt crusted baked potato. The sour creme was ice cold and the steak was so covered in heavily salted sauce that none of the meat flavors came through. The salt crusted potato was covered and I mean covered in salt. I did complain to the waiter, who of course, predictably said \"well it's salt crusted.\" It was salt soaked & caked inedible buddy! They gave us a portion of fries as a replacement but brought out enough fries for the whole restaurant.   I would give them a second chance but to be honest, it's more worth trying something else."}
