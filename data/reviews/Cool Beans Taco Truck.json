{"text":"A year or so ago when I ate the beans and greens from this truck, it was really very good - lots of flavorful greens cooked just right - tender but still crunchy.  I was happy to see them back in my neighborhood today, so I ordered the closest thing on their menu, which was a beans and greens and pasta dish.  While it was still fairly tasty, there was very minimal amount of anything except pasta, and the beans seemed mushy like from a can.  This meal is what I would throw together in 5 min in a pinch; not what I would buy when out with other food trucks and restaurants around.  I wish I hadn't spent $10 + tip on this."}
{"text":"I tried their food this summer when they had their food truck in squirrel hill and lets just say I'm not wowed. I thought it would be a nice meal consisting of all my favorite foods, but instead I felt like I was eating olive oil with a side of greens and beans. I feel like it would've tasted great if there was only 1/4 of the amount of oil placed in my meal. I won't be searching for them again. However, if I happen to see the truck again, I would like to try their tater tots."}
{"text":"This is a quick and semi tasty food truck option. I enjoyed the blackened salmon tacos, though felt the salmon was so so, and was over powered by the cabbage. I also thought that the avocado cream dollop and sour cream drizzle is annoyingly placed bc it's more on the outside than the inside and sparse at best regardless... so you're basically a mess for an underwhelming experience.. would I order again? Probably.. bc it's local and convenient..  5 bucks a taco seems high to me... but it given competition reasonable."}
{"text":"I just got back from vacation on Saturday and saw you guys at Grist House. Got their greens and beans with chicken and cannolli bites... Freaking delicious!! I'm getting hungry thinking about it."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the food truck at Helicon Brewery in Oakdale. Great mix of tacos and super enjoyed the tater tots.  Good way to balance brew and food"}
{"text":"OK, it's probably premature to give this truck five stars, but it's all I have to go on... The jalapeño popper sandwich? Probably the best sandwich I've ever had in my life. It was so so so good.

Honestly I should probably subtract a star just because I can't find a picture of their menu board that has the jalapeño popper sandwich actually on it.

That's all I've had. And that's all I have to go on. If you like jalapeño poppers, and you like spicy food,  and you like sandwiches then you should go to this truck and eat this sandwich. 

And if they don't offer it when they visit your venue? Then you should raise your voice and point and gesticulate and be outraged and question their intelligence for not making this a regular menu item."}
{"text":"If you have a Costco membership you can also run a food truck.  Chicken taco was definitely frozen processed chicken with runny processed guacamole. Get ready to empty your wallet and cut off your socks - $8.00 for some frozen tater tots with excessive amounts of seasoning salt."}
{"text":"I had the salmon taco and the Korean BBQ as part of a special where I received a free meal for test-driving a Ford car, so I can't comment on pricing. As for the tacos themselves, the salmon came out a bit dry, with very little taste, although I might have chanced onto a dud. On the other hand, the Korean BBQ taco was delicious, juicy and full of flavor, so it all sort of balanced out. The staff I interacted with were friendly and cheerful."}
{"text":"I'm giving this a five solely because these guys are awesome and they can cook. The funnel cake dipped cannoli bites are phenomenal.  I've spent years looking for this truck. I recently got to try their actual food and it's good. It's just heavy for lunch so I couldn't finish my grilled chicken and cous cous.  As far as flavor goes these guys have flavor. My grilled chicken played well with the spinach, kale, escarole,  red pepper and cheese building upon layers of flavor. This reminds me of something I'd eat in the fall. It's like a warm salad in a bowl. If you ever get a chance to try the funnel cake dipped cannoli, go for it. It'll change your life. Thank me later!"}
{"text":"Cool temperature and cool truck.  Staff was super friendly and helpful.  
The taco special was very good.  Received three tacos and they had three different fillings, so I tried all three.  The salmon was cooked perfectly and tasty, the pork was even better and the chicken was good too.  The Cannoli bites were out of this world.  The little balls of funnel cake were so much better than you get at most of the food stands, wowser!
When I have the opportunity will have to try the beans & greens."}
{"text":"Cool beans, literally. Cool as in good, not cool temperature-wise :)

Cool Beans is a food truck that specializes in greens and beans, which you can get with various meats or without. I don't know what they cook those greens in, but damn, they are good. And not to mention, filling. That pint might look small, but it's gonna go a long way.

They are serving up something that no other food truck is in the city - Funnel Cake Bites. You have GOT to try them! These little balls of joy are reminiscent of a carnival with a more up-scale taste and not nearly as messy.

Follow their social media accounts to find out their next stop!"}
