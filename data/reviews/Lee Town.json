{"text":"We go here often and typically have the Lunch Special - big portion and nicely priced, especially for the area.  Dim Sum is good, but can sometimes take long, so we'll order it right away, then the rest of our food a few minutes later, so we can get all our food at the same time.    Overall, I'm a fan."}
{"text":"i've eaten here once in person but usually do delivery. I find the food acceptable and good and love that I can order dimsum for dinner :) everyone has been friendly so no complaints."}
{"text":"If you like dim sum, this is among the best in the Yonge-Sheppard area and definitely the cheapest as well.  Looks aside, they put out a very good product.  My only complaint is that they don't open until 11am and they don't deliver until 2pm.  I have recommended this place to serious dim sum eaters and have heard that it was the best har gow they ever had.  Definitely worth checking out if you are in the area and craving some pork buns and sticky rice."}
{"text":"this place is cheap, delivers, has large portions with lots of meat, and is delicious.   lee town is awesome."}
{"text":"Ordered in wonton soup and was horrible and the chicken wings not worth mentioning!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try this place for years. Tried it yesterday and it was not bad. Will  check out the rest of the menu next time.  Ordered:  1. Yang Chow fried rice 2. General \"George\" Chicken   Both were good. Their General George was nice and crispy--better than Congee Wong's General Tso chicken"}
{"text":"Flavour was on point - not too salty, not too bland. Price was reasonable too.  4 stars only b/c the waitress misheard our order: we ordered 1 lobster with salt and pepper flavour, and one with ginger and onions. She cooked both as ginger and onions and insisted that she took down our order correctly..."}
{"text":"This has to be the cheapest place to eat in the area, if you compare the amount of food you get on your plate. $6.22 for Lunch special, I got fried rice, sweet and sour soup, and one spring roll. 6.22 included taxes.  Getting the servers attention is challenging during lunch time, they were super busy and only two servers. There is not much seating here so if you are large group do not even think about going here without a reservation. They were kind of strict about not letting people sit in booths that were meant for 4 people if you were only 2 people.  Other than that this place was awesome, I really should've tried the Dim Sum but the lunch deal was hard to pass up, maybe next time.  There are enough vegetarian options for vegetarian and they will not put an egg in fried rice if you don't eat eggs.  There are gluten free options, but not too many, very few."}
{"text":"This place seems a bit sketchy when you go in, but hey, it's passed the health inspection, so it must be ok...  We've only ever had take out from there, and from the looks of the dining room, I would recommend take out.  Despite the shabby appearance, the food is top notch.  We literally have loved every dish we've ordered from Lee Town.  The highlights are the garlic eggplant, the lo mein noodles, and the General \"George\" chicken (for some reason, that's what they call their General Tsao chicken).    Feeling really hungry?  You can get a feast here for not much money."}
{"text":"Coming from the U.S., it is similar to what you find there, but it is waaaaaay better here at Leetown! Such great Chinese food; it was probably the best I've had in a really long time! The next time I am in North York, I will definitely eat here! Very good food and decent prices too for a family of four!"}
{"text":"I loved the dumplings and stuffed eggplant. Service was ok. I missed the original Lee Town downtown location."}
{"text":"Really affordable, Large portions. You will have leftovers for sure. It doesnt look like much from the outside though. They have great shanghai noodles and orange chicken. Definitely a good place to come back to when youre in the mood for some chiense food"}
{"text":"Went here after 4pm as a mid-afternoon snack and thought we would order some congee, popcorn chicken and shrimp dumplings (har gao). Congee felt like it was thickened with lumps of flour... Popcorn chicken was full of batter and the small pieces of chicken were extremely dry and hard. The only decent thing were the shrimp dumplings but the shrimp were not deveined and didn't have much flavour. Overall, an OK place to eat if desperate... But I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Always been my favourite in the neighbourhood.  Never fails to satisfy my dim sum cravings for pork shiu mai, steamed pork bbq buns and deep fried spicy chicken wings.  Hits the spot at each time"}
{"text":"Very mixed feelings about this place. The prices are amazingly cheap, especially their specials. However, the food is very hit or miss. The service is pretty quick, although they asked us what we wanted to order only after about a minute after sitting down.   We got the lunch special. I got the barbecue pork chow mein, hot and sour soup, and spring roll. My friend got the General George chicken, hot and sour soup, and egg roll. My barbecue pork chow mein was okay, it felt very standard Chinese restaurant fare. It definitely wasn't bad but it wasn't particularly noteworthy either. The hot and sour soup was great, it's one of my favourite Chinese restaurant soups and this delivered! The spring roll tasted like the classic store-bought spring roll, nothing noteworthy here either.  The General George chicken was an interesting one, it honestly didn't taste very good. The chicken felt suspicious and wasn't a very good blend of flavours. The egg roll was also somewhat questionable, the fillings didn't taste quite right.  I don't really know if I'll come back. I do want to try some of their dim sum, but my current expletive is leaving me quite conflicted."}
{"text":"Back again, for another positive review of one of my guilty pleasures: lowbrow dim sum, delivered to my home, lightning fast, in the evening, along with a few fun additional dishes thrown in.  Just think of Lee Town as a cheap and cheerful chinese delivery that's thankfully not chicken balls and beef with broccoli.  Favorites include har gow and siu mai, of course, which I like to eat with copious amounts of their fiery chili oil, Plus pan-fried pork dumplings with red vinegar, and cigar size shrimp rolls, that are simply seasoned minced shrimp inside a thin crispy deep fried spring roll wrapper. The crispy egg rolls have a touch of 5 spice, the sticky rice is meaty and drlicious, and the hand-battered popcorn chicken is cheap and overcooked in a salty/crunchy delicious way.  I have found the rice and noodle dishes to be not much to write home about, but I have lots of other options for those anyways, I pretty much stick to the dim sum items which are pretty decent and do not require a long line up in a crowded restaurant to wait for a table on a Sunday morning.  This is absolutely not Dragon Boat quality dim sum, but Dragon Boat won't quickly deliver steaming hot dumplings to my house on a Tuesday evening, especially not for these super cheap prices, either :)   Keep your expectations modest, skip the wonton-noodle soup and bland fried rice & noodle dishes, and go for no frills dimsum, I'm sure you will quite enjoy it."}
{"text":"I agree with Rainie, this place is great!  Doesn't look the best from the outside, but it truly is a hidden gem and one of the best deals in toronto.  Lunch/Dinner specials are 5.99/6.99 respectively and the food is delicious.  Also comes with soup and an egg roll. I recently started working in this area and have been trying the local restaurants and this place is among the best.  I actually wish it was closer to my house so I could go for dinner!"}
{"text":"I ordered a beef noodle in soup dish for $6.50 as a lunch special. Very cheap but the noodles had mold in it.   I confront them, they held their bag of noodles in my face to prove that there was no mold, but I asked them to turn the bag over and there was a LARGE black fuzzy spot of mold.   They tried to hide it from me. Sneaky.   Never coming here again because I don't want pay $6.50 to have a sad shit session."}
{"text":"I've lived in the Yonge/Sheppard area for around 13 years and this is the go to place for Chinese take-out.  I usually get one of their lunch specials, usually the Cantonese chow mein with sliced beef which comes with a hot and sour or corn soup plus a spring roll (or egg roll) for about $7.90 total.  The mains usually come in a large styrofoam box and the portion size is pretty good (usually a bit left over.  I'm about 5'9, 155lbs for reference).  There was a period of time in the late 2000's where I avoided this place due to a health inspection failure and one of our co-op students finding rat poop in his takeout lunch, but since I've been going there regularly since the beginning of the year, it seems like they've cleaned up their act.  Overall, not the best chinese food in the world, but the value is pretty stellar compared to similar places in the area which produce lower quality food.  Never tried dine-in, but I highly recommend the takeout lunch special."}
{"text":"Sigh.. I really wanted to write a positive food review but seems like I have not had much luck recently.  Anyways here's what happened: I placed an takeout order of their sweet and sour pork lunch special today. The price was really low and it came with a spring roll and soup. The soup tasted fine according to my husband but the strange black material on the pork and rice, which looked like coating that fell off the pot.. that could be a MAJOR health hazard. I have never seen that happen at any other Chinese restaurants! Also when I picked up the takeout bag from the counter I could feel with my fingers that the counter surface was very sticky. Yuck.  This is the only place I know that serves (close resemblance) Cantonese style Chinese food around Yonge/Sheppard so I guess that's the best I can get (there is quite a few other Chinese cuisines around though). I don't recommend it to anyone, as what I saw about their sanitation simply does not inspire any confidence.  Not again."}
{"text":"Lee town has great food at affordable prices. The space needs work. They also have bad ventilation that creates an odd scent. I love to takeout from here. Dinr in not recommened."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of this place mostly for the convenience and practicality with their dishes. I've been here twice to get some take-out and both times the taste of the food has been satisfactory to delicious. The first time I got two springs rolls, Shanghai noodles and Yeung Chow fried rice The second time I got one of their lunch specials: a spring + a corn soup + old style rice noodle and the chicken Cantonese lo mein. The rice and noodle dishes always fill up the take-out containers and on both occasions the food had been comforting and I had enough leftover for a few days."}
{"text":"I like their hot and sour soup. The taste of the food is not very consistent, most of the time their food just doesn't have a lot of flavors in it. Service is ok, but the restaurant itself is not very clean."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. Very greasy spring roles and chicken wings. Poor quality tough beef and bland, bland food. At least they could have seasoned to food better to make up for the quality.   I won't be back. There is so much choice in the neighborhood that a poor quality restaurant won't last long."}
{"text":"Ordered for delivery.  The food was quite good, if just a little too sweet.  Portions are large as others have mentioned.  The owner gave me $3 off the bill as she had a new delivery driver and he was a bit confused, resulting in a slow delivery.  They do not speak English very well so be patient in giving an order over the phone."}
{"text":"I don't know why this place isn't rated higher. I had a wonderful experience here. For the price and quality, this is a great deal. Their dim sum is served all day and while it's not tops, it's definitely a great find at 10 pm at night for $3 each. Their fried rice portions are huge. I shared one order with 2 guys. Their chicken wings is tasty and huge! It's crisp on the outside, juicy on the inside with a nice Asian spice to it. It's just the type of hole in the wall establishment for a late night cheap but good meal."}
{"text":"This place is aiiiight.  A sign reads all day dim sum. Ordered me some dim sum. The Dim Sum is aiiiight. Pricing is like the early 2000s.  That's a good look for the wallet. If you're looking for Dim Sum in the area, this place does the job. Restaurant I neither bad nor great.  Aiiiight is the word."}
{"text":"My go-to Chinese restaurant in Yonge and Sheppard area. Its a small restaurant with one staff so if you are in a hurry or not so patient, i recommend you go somewhere else during peak time. So far I'm satisfied with their food and pricing. they do have all day dim sum, but ginger was too strong for my shu mai... Har gao was alright. I really like Orange shrimp. Shrimp has soft but crunchy texture, with good balance of sweet and spicy. Fried rice menus are soso. I prefer their chicken.shrimp.noodle menus over rice."}
{"text":"AVOID THIS PLACE !!! This place is super rude and disrespectful. Food is average. This place is lucky to be still surviving. They don't treat you as human. Please please please do all of us a big favor and avoid this place."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place because its so close to my house also offered very affordable dishes. They have all day dim sum and also other entrees like rice, noodles, soups and stir fried.  I came around 12 so it was a lunch rush and we had to wait for a bit but i'm cool with that. Ive already not have a lot of expectations for service since im at a Chinese restaurant so I'm not complaining about the service there. Lady took our order was in a hurry so we ordered very fast. We wanted to have dimsum but i guess it's not normal to have dimsum on a weekday lunch rush because she said your food gonna take forever. I understand so i said it's fine. I ordered pork siumai, black bean spare ribs, stuffed deep fried tofu, sticky rice and bbq pork buns. Before getting into food quality i just want to inform that price is very cheap here, around $3 for a basket. Spareribs were ok, not too greasy but not very tender. You get what u paid. Bbq pork bun, more buns than pork, taste is good, balance seasoning. Stuffed tofu came in big portion but got spoiled so we sent back. Sticky rice also came in big portion but stuffing only has minced pork which is not like the other places and its portion is ridiculously little compared to the amount of sticky rice. Pork siumai is the best dishes in all the thing that i ordered. It came to around $15 with tips. I wanted to check if she took out my tofu of the bill but its all written in chinese and she didnt let us see it to confirm. She just showed the price and gave the machine right away to pay.  Space and hygiene have nothing to comment about except it is not qualified.  If you want quick dimsum fix and around the area only, stick to the basic items, its also cheap. I havent tried their $6.5 lunch menu yet but everyone around was having it so i assume it is good  Overalls, would not come back. Maybe will do take out if i need siumai"}
{"text":"We came here to order some take out for my MIL who wanted some westernized Chinese food (e.g. chicken balls). The place is really small & there was a cart stacked with dirty dishes by the order desk. The place in general didn't look super clean so I would hesitate to eat here myself. Though I hear this place has been here for years!"}
{"text":"The food is alright..  I was craving dim sum and woke up late so this was the closest thing near home for all day dim sum.   upon arrival we were not greeted or seated.   we seated ourselves and she just came by and asked if we're ready to order lol  the sticky rice is something you should really avoid  ordering the young chow fried rice is good   i got the siu mai, and ha gow which wasn't great either  if i come back it's probably only for the fried rice"}
{"text":"Sticky rice on point. House fried dumplings were solid too. I didn't love the little mein, but a solid all around meal. You can stuff yourself for a few bucks."}
{"text":"This is a hole in the wall, neighbourhood restaurant, if you want fancy decor, this is not the place for you.  I would call this a Canadian Chinese Food Restaurant.  Good prices for lunch (11am - 4pm), from the dishes that came out of the kitchen, the portions are huge. A lot of people also come in for lunch take out.  We wanted to try the $2.50 dim sum,  We ordered:  Deep Fried Shrimp Rolls Baby Octopus with Curry and Garlic Sauce BBQ Pork Steam Buns Beef Balls Sticky Rice - $3 With the exception of Sticky Rice, the dim sum was ok, not the best I've had but in line with the price.  They charge 1.50 for tea  Since our first visit, we have been back to try their lunch special, for $6.50+tax, you can't go wrong. There are also daily special on the board for $5.50 if you are budget minded.  For lunch special, we tried: Sweet and Sour Pork - nice BBQ Pork Fried Rice - huge portion for two, we had to take the leftover home. Chicken Chow Mein Fried Noodles - nice big portion with thin crunchy noodles.  The ladies who worked there are very efficient and nice."}
