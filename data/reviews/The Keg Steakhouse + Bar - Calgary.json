{"text":"I visited this location on multiple occasions and always had a great time. I always enjoy the great customer service - Caitlyn was helping us during our recent visit and she very friendly and professional. Our orders arrived sooner than expected and the food was quite delicious.  Will be back again."}
{"text":"This Keg location downtown is pretty swank.  I like it, though, because it's dark inside, but in a good way - dark for ambiance, not cover up! There are fireplaces near the entryway and the windows are even a bit tinted - very cozy chic.  Lucky me, I was there for Crab Fest. So why I chose the fish & chips I'll never know!  It reminds me of the time that I got the Chicken Parmesan at the Big Boy - not the the most sound decision.  So, I'll tell you that everyone at the table very much enjoyed their crab and steaks. I, on the other hand, suffered through my pancake battered halibut and lukewarm fries. But I guess I had it coming!"}
{"text":"Last night I revisted the Keg at the Westin. Although there has been a marked improvement in the service and the meat was actually hot this time, too much is wrong with the other items to give a higher score.  For starters, I mean actual starters, the Caesar's salad was barely edible. The romaine was limp and not the least bit crisp. It was literally sticking to the roof of my mouth. The parmesan, although grated freshly, was hardly what I could call aged. It was tasteless. They even put the stump where the root was separated from the romaine in the salad. No salad fork was provided; this I consider a major faux pas. When ever I tried to spear a crouton, it would break and fly across the table. Forks meant for meat and fries just do not do the job at all. Salad forks have sharp tynes that will pierce a crouton. I had to spoon the salad with my fork because it would not pick anything up.  The bread again was hot enough to burn one's hand and melt the butter so it falls off into one's lap and that is exactly what happened. I have eaten at some of the finest restaurants in the world and it is close to never where I see bread served this hot. The interior is mushy from the heat. I never ever saw such practices in France or Italy.  The Keg fries were salty enough to make them an ordeal to eat. The sodium was virtually piled on. The salt was so overpowering that no residual taste from my steak remained at the end of the meal. I had to drink close to a litre of water. Restaurants that decide for me how much salt my food is going to contain truly anger me. At least they did not use seasoning salt which the french fry's worst enemy. Let me make the choice as to how much sodium I wish to kill my food with.  The steak, a top sirloin, was expertly prepared an served exactly as ordered, medium rare, too bad the salt from the fries destroyed the memory.  The vegetables, roasted peppers and asparagus, were well prepared and not salted to death like the fries. My only concern here is that the asparagus was too skinny to get it off of the plate with a fork. I cut it up into tiny pieces and shoveled it on to the fork and ate it as if I was using a spoon. Nonetheless, the taste of both the peppers and asparagus was excellent.  The wine by the glass selection is inferior, nothing on the list tickles my fancy. They have some magnificent wines by the bottle but did not offer half bottles. I am sorry but some people who dine alone want wine, good wine, with their meals and I do not feel like being pissed to the eyeballs because I had to drink a whole bottle. It would be a sin to waste a bottle of Dead Arm Shiraz. Almost every good wine on their list they have access to by the half bottle. The Keg simply chooses to ignore the needs of their solo diners. Wake up.  Frankly, I think two stars is generous but I will let it stick for now. If more than one item is not up to reasonable expectations I will not go above two stars. The bread, the salad, the fries, and the wine made four issues The Keg must address. With tax, my meal came to $29.30. I had no treats from the grape vine. Frankly, it was over priced due to major issues with the rest of the meal.   IF YOU ARE HOLDING A BUSINESS MEETING THERE IS NO WI FI. The signal from the Westin Lounge is too weak."}
{"text":"We made the reservation in person and were able to pick where we liked to be seated (except the patio which was on a first-come-first-serve basis). We were a large group of 11 (mostly out of town guests) and had to commend them on the excellent service. The waiter was patient with our questions and orders. Except for one extra dessert at the end, everything was just as we asked for.  Most of us had the prime ribs, NY-cut and Manhattan-cut steak except for the ladies who had the stuffed chicken, lobster and shrimp salad, and the pistachio-crusted salmon. The ribs were excellent compared to the steak which were nothing spectacular. Couldn't see much lobster in my mom's salad and my salmon was decent at best. My 9-year old nephew had the kid's steak with fries but there was unfortunately too much pepper on it for him to enjoy the steak. His meal did come with an appetizer platter (cheese, strawberries and cut veggies) and ice cream for dessert so that was a plus.  Can't say I've been to too many Kegs around town. But I think this has to be one of the fancier locations in Calgary (and perhaps Canada and the States?)."}
{"text":"The service here was really top-notch. Food, alright. I think slightly overpriced, but that's not unusual for a restaurant attached to a hotel. I really liked the atmosphere, which also made it a memorable night.  Overall, a decent choice for a work dinner (as in, I'm glad I didn't have to pay)."}
{"text":"Food here is an absolute nightmare.  Got a gift card to the restaurant so I went to use it up.  I ordered a lobster and a steak plate (as usual) and everything on the plate was over cooked.  Basically, the steak was so dry I was afraid that I was going to choke on my food if I continued eating it ( I asked for a medium). Complimenting the dish was an over cooked lobster. yuk  I don't expect a michelin star dining experience from the KEG but at least serve them so that it is edible.  I don't remember my dining experience from other KEG locations being this awful.  I'll never return."}
{"text":"Only ever had apps and drinks here, but they've always been great. Service can be a little slow sometimes."}
{"text":"We stayed in Westin so it was easy to get to this restaurant since it was located on its lobby level.  Sat outside in the patio.  Very nice atmosphere. Good music was played.  The server was nice and helpful.  Ordered sirloin with medium-well cook, it was okay (it was more well-done that medium-well). If you want a good steak I recommend to go to other steakhouse.  It was the first restaurant I tried in Canada and I thought the service is slower than the US.  I went to few other restaurants in Calgary and figured out that the service is slower than in the US."}
{"text":"\"Meh\" describes this restaurant in every way.  The mojito's: Not very flavorful. Meh.  Bread: Almost as good as the pre-packaged stuff you buy at the grocery store.  Meh.  Calamari: A bit chewy, not much flavor.  Meh.  Bleu cheese filet: decently cooked, but tough like a mid-ranged sirloin and not much flavor apart from the bleu cheese.  Meh.  Didn't bother with dessert.  Price: Youch, much better bang for the buck out there."}
{"text":"First time I've tried out this location of the Keg at lunch time.  It's a fairly new location in where Owl's Nest used to be.  Very updated modern decor with lots of dark wood and booths for privacy.  Nicely done.  We didn't have a reservation so showed up early to get a table.  Noticed that the table board was almost booked to capacity when we got there at 11:10, so reservations would be recommended.  Food:  I've been to Keg's all over Canada, mostly I've gone for the small prime rib, very nice portion for the price of $20.  One thing I took off for rating purposes is the meat was put under the griller for a bit too long and therefore was a little on the dry side.  Otherwise, very tender and nice marbling.  Fried onions were a bit on greasy side so I left those alone.  I went for the side of French Onion soup instead of regular side, never a disappointment.  It was the BEST thing about the meal.  Very nice broth with just the right amount of melted cheese on top.  Service:  if you get there and put your order in early, like we did (11:10 AM), you will get your meal in farily good time.  We got our at 11:35, so it was a 20 minute turn-around after we ordered.  Diners that came in closer to noon or a little after noon were still waiting on their food when we left at 12:40.  The service was good and professional, so nothing of note there.  Overall, good place, good food, so would recommend if you're feeling carnivorous."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a great dinner! The waiter was attentive and even the General Manager was helping at tables to see how everyone's dinner was. We had the prime rib and it was perfect. The vegetables were fresh and cooked just right. From the moment we walked in it was a wonderful experience. A very nice atmosphere, clean and experienced staff. This Keg, at 130th, is always consistent in food, beverage and service."}
{"text":"I enjoyed an early lunch here which was good. But this evening I am having steak and bacon wrapped lobster medallions with asparagus and string beans and roasted red peppers. It is superb and my corporate drink was made exactly right."}
{"text":"Love all of the food items on their menu! The garlic mash potatoes are my all time favourite!"}
{"text":"I went here on Saturday night for a friend's birthday and had a really great experience. There was a larger group of us and we had a reservation for 8:30 pm they were unable to seat us until 9:00 pm but the manager came and personally apologized which I really appreciated. When we were seated the waitress quickly took all of our drink and food orders as we had time to decide while waiting for the table. She was extremely accommodating and kind. All of the food came out within 20 minutes. Everyone's food came out correctly. I had the pistachio salmon which was wonderful. I also really liked the brussel sprouts that accompanied it. After the waitress played along with us to surprise the birthday girl with her cake. The waitress put all the candles on the cake and brought it out. We had a great experience all in all and I will go back to this Keg location in the future:)"}
{"text":"Alert! New happy hour find!!  Come here, Monday to Friday, 3 to 6pm, and grab yourself the Mushrooms Neptune ($7) and a 6 oz glass of Cab Sauv for $6 (or 9 oz for $9 if that's more your thing). There's beers, wine and cocktails all on special, and four appy options for $7-$8. Check it all out here: https://www.kegsteakhouse.com/assets/CocktailHour/Cocktail-Hour-Inserts-3-6T-OCT2015.pdf.  It's a popular happy hour spot, so head there early! I got there at 4:30pm and most of the tables were full. My new favourite spot is a large comfortable couch and chairs around a table in the very back left, but don't tell Di I told you! We also had amazing service, if you can sit in Meisha's section I highly recommend it.   Pro tips: they will bring you bread (tasty, fresh and warm bread) and butter for free if you ask, for all that extra sauce leftover from your appys. The Mojitos are also pretty sweet, I liked mine with fresh lime (rather than lime cordial) and half the amount of sugar."}
{"text":"Went into the bar on a Sunday night. Found parking right across from the entrance. Perfectly cooked steaks. Service was fast, environment was awesome, and the food was on point. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Been there two times and I am just not impressed. The first time the food was very overcooked. The second time the fish was good but the sides were dry, very overcooked and unseasoned. Looking at the prices, which are rather high, compared to what I got, I was just really disappointed! And after trying it a second time I have no desire to eat there again.  Inside the restaurant it is very dark. They try to be fancy, but it doesn't work for me. The seating outside is nice, except that the music is just too loud. The stuff is pretty good and friendly, in general. We had a really poor experience with one waitress, but the manager handled the situation very well.  I might go there again to have a drink, because it is located very well, but I am not going to eat there again. There are just so many other and much better places in Calgary for food."}
{"text":"Must get the stars up for this one! In town on a business trip with my hubby. Enjoyed some alone time today exploring Calgary. Ended my afternoon here. Service...great. Food...excellent! I was looking for a burger. The reviews weren't stellar, but I came anyway. Familiar with the restaurant from living in Portland, OR several years ago. Best Burger Ever!!"}
{"text":"The space is large, and the restaurant itself is very nice inside. If I had to say anything negative, it's that it's dark inside. That being said, I was there for lunch on a Sunday and just walked in from a bright sunny afternoon. I had a steak, and it was tasty and cooked to my satisfaction. Our server, though a bit abrupt was efficient enough and the overall service was good. I'd come back again, but prefer my location off 130th ave. in the south. It's only open for dinner, which is the only draw back."}
{"text":"Given that I travel to Calgary a lot for business, I usually stay at the Westin and consider myself a regular at the Keg.  Environment - 4 stars -- Dining area is very open and nicely laid out -- Only issue that I have is that the lighting is very low lit.  Otherwise, dining area is great -- Most of the time, I spend my dinners in the bar area.  It seems always pack.  I make it a point to always try to go late - 9:30pm - 10pm for dinner -- Lighting again is very dim and dark.    Service - 5 stars -- Excellent.  I never had any issues with staff, servers, and managers -- They do a very good job of following up with meals and ensuring that everything is taken care of  Dinner - 4 stars -- Appetizers    - Would recommend the garlic shrimp (this is my favorite), bacon scallops, clam soup,    and shrimp cocktails.       Sometimes, I add in a mixed green salad or caesar    - French Onion Soup is okay    - Stay away from the escargot.  Personally, it was not to my liking.    -- Entree    - Definitely would go with either the 10 ounce prime rib and lobster tail combination or the Bone In Ribeye.  Love these two dishes!  Price - 3 stars.  I have to say that it is a bit pricey.   Overall, I truly enjoy dining here and would definitely recommend this place.  Cheers and enjoy!"}
{"text":"It was a Friday at 11:30AM and not just any ol' weekday wrap up.. it was the last Friday before Christmas and we wanted to go out for lunch. Everywhere was booked with reservations so we thought \"let's just check out The Keg Lounge\" since they don't do reso's. When we arrived the restaurant was packed but we were able to find a booth (the last one) in the back. Happy days? Well.... Not quite.  We sat there for about 10 minutes before our server came up to us and we gave her our drink orders, there was a table behind us that also just ordered drinks. In a decent time they got theirs but we waited about 15 minutes more just for her to return with one glass of wine, the other two drinks were nowhere to be found. We asked her if they were coming and she said yes and hurried off, now yes I understand it was busy but the table behind us had the same server and everything seemed to run smoothly for them..... When we were finally able to order our food (we all ordered filet mignon - med rare) it ended up being another long wait about 45 minutes and the table behind us was long gone by the time we received our steaks.   Our server didn't wait to see if the steaks were cooked to our preference and well, they weren't. They were all medium well  to well done and the order of fries tasted like frozen fries from a no name brand. It was very disappointing. I did enjoy the décor of this location but if the food/service isn't good what is the point of going?"}
{"text":"The patio at this location of The Keg is one of my absolute favourite patios in Calgary.  It's *Beautiful*.  Located right downtown Calgary, attached to the Westin hotel and next to a Starbucks Coffee, this Keg doesn't leave a whole lot to be desired.  The staff is remarkable, and the crowd, composed mostly of out-of-towners, is so friendly and approachable.  My friends and I like to go down here in the summer and just spend hours chatting on the patio.  The food is standard Keg grub - which is good, and like I said, the ambiance and surroundings are some of the best in town!  See you there!"}
{"text":"I got stuck in downtown Calgary for two days after my plane broke. The airline couldn't get me out on another flight and had to put me up at the Westin. It was a snowy couple of days and how fortuitous it was to have The Keg attached to the hotel.  At lunchtime, my girl had a delicious cream of mushroom soup, and it was full of different hearty mushrooms. I had the iceberg wedge salad and it was good too. We shared a prime rib burger with avocado and the flavor was remarkable. It was our six month anniversary and we mentioned that to our friendly server. He offered us some complimentary champagne, but we both politely declined since she had to go to work, and I had yet to complete my workout for the day.  We ordered the chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream dessert and wow, was it ever delicious! How surprised we were when the check came and our server had comped our cake!  I went back later in the evening for dinner and had the baseball sirloin. It was a very tasty and tender hunk of cow and perfectly cooked! The sides were just right and not so much that you felt totally stuffed walking out of the place."}
{"text":"This is one of those places that looks great from the outside but is not so good on the inside....service is very slow and food is about 30% overpriced.  You can find MUCH better service and a more creative menu in Calgary.   Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Yummy!  Friendly service amazing food. Had the blue cheese filet. So good. Definitely would recommend if in Calgary."}
{"text":"Great service.  Great rib steak,  Amazing wine selection.  They even have a J Lohr Petite Syrah special.  What a great place to go to when you are travelling to get a good hearty meal to get rid of weariness.  Not sure but I can feel a difference in how they cook steaks Chicago style.  Less butter for sure and more char.  Will come back here again!"}
{"text":"We were in Calgary for a night thought we'd give this Keg Steakhouse a try.  First of all making reservations online was super easy!  We were early as our plans had changed. I was very happy that they were able to accommodate us and seat us immediately.  The food was good, steak was cooked to order.  Crab cakes came out lukewarm!  My real problem was the service!!  Not once did our waitress come to check on how our appetizers were if she would have I could've sent the crab cakes back!!  Never did see her after our main courses were delivered! Thank god our steak was cooked to order!!  Terrible service from my point if view!  I think the waitresses name was Anastasia or something like that...I will not be going back!!!"}
{"text":"Everytime we go to the keg we are blown away by the service. But this location has definitely earned a special place in my books. The food was amazing and the staff were exceptionally fantastic! Will for sure be returning."}
{"text":"Good experience.  I managed to go to the Keg twice during my recent business trip.  I was fortunate to have the same server both times.  She did a really good of of taking orders, dropping by to chat and see how we were enjoying our meal  On this trip I had the prime rib with shrimp.  The Keg does a good job keeping food quality consistent from location to location.  I also applaud that they do not mix their horseradish with anything."}
{"text":"This is a frequent place for me to go. I find the decor the nicest and the wicked patio! I generally am here having bevvies, as opposed to eating. But the nachos are delish!  The service has always been good, very funny and polite. Full bar, lots of drink options and tons of room. I would say my fave location of the Keg."}
{"text":"Connected to the Weston, in the downtown area, it has been a predominantly business crowd (myself one of them) each time I have visited. In general, it is a nice space even when semi-busy that meets expectations.  During my most recent trip, we ended up here twice. The first night, after arriving in the city, we sat in the lounge and ordered from the bar menu. I chose the Tuna Tacos. They arrived seared, not cooked, which is the way I like them, with the coleslaw and aioli adding a good accent. A minor complaint, the tacos were slightly damp and kind of adhered to the plate. Meanwhile, the service was excellent, Visited with someone with allergies and they came by to talk to her multiple times, including explaining that the meal would soon be here but they were taking all the extra precautions.  The second night, booked by someone who did not know we went the night before, was in the restaurant section. This time I ordered the BBQ ribs, which were okay, but I would have liked a better quality rib and more falling away from the bone. Also, it comes with the slaw (good) and fries (I should have seen if I could get a different option). While the service was satisfactory, but nothing more.  Comparing the two, I preferred the lounge area visit, since both the meal and service earned higher rating."}
{"text":"Came by here on a Friday night for drinks, escargot and fries. Service was great, food was tasty, however, I'm writing to say bless the Keg's heart, because I forgot my brand new iphone here and I was going out of my mind. Lucky for me, I was at the Keg and our server recorded which table the phone was found at and i got it back.   If you plan to blow off a little steam and think you may forget your personal belongings, come to the Keg, cuz it's a safe place to do so!"}
{"text":"I'm staying at the Westin, and it's cold out, so I decided to eat at the hotel's restaurant. I'm glad I did! I had the stuffed filet - the meat was tender, the jalapenos were a welcome addition, and the sauce was excellent. I heartily recommend it."}
{"text":"I came twice for dinner but mostly I come here for a dessert. \"Billyminerpie\" if you're in KEG try this! It's heaven!"}
{"text":"I frequently go to The Keg for client lunches, or even a quick Friday afternoon meeting with colleagues.  The food at pretty much every Keg location is pretty consistent - I can't say I've ever had a \"bad\" meal, but I do find this location slow at lunch.    I would personally recommend sticking to soup and salad, or their larger meal salads if you're going for lunch.  I had the steak sandwich recently, and did not enjoy it - it came on a very thick baguette that was very hard to cut - the steak was good but I felt like I needed a saw to get through the bread!"}
{"text":"Just had date night dinner with my wife and I have to say that dinner at this Keg was a huge disappointment. My wife ordered the pistachio salmon which was just okay. It was overcooked and dry but seasoned nicely. The vegetables were cooked perfectly.   My dish however, was quite simply a disaster on a plate. I ordered the prime rib and mixed vegetables. The prime rib was so tough that you could stitch a couple of them together to make a moccasin that could probably survive a half marathon.   I spent most of dinner just \"sawing\". Additionally, there was just way too much fat that had that uncooked appearance. I managed to cut out a block the size of Halloween sized Smarties box. It was opaque white and just unpleasant to look at. Additionally, my vegetables had absolutely no seasoning. Doesn't everyone know that all you need is some salt to bring out the flavor? They were cooked acceptably however as bland as can possibly be.  I have had prime rib at several different Kegs and had a positive experience. I have also dined at House of Prime Rib in San Francisco. I'm not sure what happened tonight but we will not be back at this location again. At least not for prime rib."}
{"text":"Until today if you'd asked me what I'd do if I had a time machine I'd have said something like \"go back and meet Jesus\" or \"watch the big bang happen\".  This all changed today at the end of my dinner as I paid my bill (including a generous tip) and as I keyed in my pin on the card machine my last sip of beer was taken from me.   This is a great atrocity.  Class 1 at hospitality school or chapter 1 of any restaurant guide should be \"don't take that glass away unless you are 1000% sure there isn't a sip left\".  I won't sleep tonight.  Otherwise, very nice experience and up to Keg standards."}
{"text":"Never a disappointment. Incredible service! Hands down the best steak I've had. The quality of food is simply perfect as is the atmosphere. I had made a reservation and our table wasn't ready. We went it the bar and had a glass of wine. They forgot about us and realized it and wee very apologetic and took care of our wine. The service is just so much better than most high-end restaurants as is the food. When I come to Canada I always look fwd to the Keg. The one in 4th in Calgary seems to be just a bit better than all the other locations I've been to. Hands down a great experience every time! The menu is so impressive and I always am surprised how good the food and drink are at this Keg in particular...but honestly feel the service at this location is above and beyond that of other locations."}
{"text":"This KEG location is quite fancy with very modern decor. Location wise, this place serves most of the downtown crowd. You'll find most people here wearing business casual - formal wear, even on the weekends. While jeans are allowed, they aren't common.   The menu the same as other locations...steak steak steak and more steak! Of course there are other options, but really if you are eating at the Keg, you should be having steak.   They have a gorgeous patio with an outdoor bar and heat lamps to keep you warm, but unfortunately you're sitting alongside traffic on 4th, which isn't so appeasing.   The service is par, not great, not terrible. I've never made it in and out of this place in the usual hour I'm allotted for lunch. Usually I have to make a phone call to my boss to tell her I'll be late. It doesn't seem to matter if I get there at 1130 or 12, I'm still there for 1.5 hours.   Price wise, it's a little high, but not unreasonable. I think you're paying more for the 'classy experience' rather than delicious food. It's all in the image right?"}
{"text":"Had a business lunch here. I have to say I was very pleasantly surprised. The Filet I had was one of the best I have had in Calgary. It was perfectly seasoned, cooked perfectly and was tender. The bread was warm and soft. Dessert of cheese cake was good also. We will be returning. No pics as it was a business lunch."}
{"text":"I've been to a number of Keg Steahouse's across the country, and this Keg is just as solid as all the others.  The Keg has figured out what good service is and their dinner selections are also solid !    I happened to be staying in the Westin on this particular business trip and the Keg is attached to the hotel.  So I walked through the lobby, right into the restaurant.  Was immediately greeted and lead to a table.  Luckily I didn't need a reservation.  The server was at my table as I sat down and was quick with the water and asking me if I had a drink in mind.  I looked through the drink menu and ordered up a beverage.  The Beer was on my table within 2 minutes.  I was given some time to order my meal and decided to go with the pistachio crusted Salmon.  Shortly their after my meal was on the table and the salmon was cooked perfectly.  There was brussel sprouts that came with the salmon, that could have been cooked a little longer.  Still nicely done.    Overall, Food is always solid at the Keg.  I've always left the Keg with a very satisfied feeling about my meal.  Service is always excellent at the Keg as well.  As mentioned previously, the Keg has figured out the model for good service.  I like the Keg, but I find their prices to be a bit on the high side.  Don't get me wrong you get good food for what you pay for but for the price, it becomes more of a special occasion type of place, versus an every day dinning type of place.  Rest assured, I will be going back to a Keg again (for a special occasion meal !)"}
{"text":"You know I rarely am disappointed going to a KEG for dinner. no matter if it's Prince George, Quebec city, Toronto, Calgary, you pretty much know what you can get.  Today my visit was Calgary, and as usual, dinner was great"}
{"text":"Went to this Keg location for dinner with my family. We chose this Keg simply because its one of the few Kegs in the city that you can make a reservation for. Service was really good and the food was as good as any other Keg - quality - consistently. We did have a slight issue with one of our orders and the waiter and manager was quick to rectify and dealt with great. I definitely would recommend this location to others."}
{"text":"Great food, awesome service and fantastic atmosphere.  I had done the booking few days in advance; we were seated few minutes after we checked in at the desk; though it was a very busy night, no delay in having us seated; customer service is great at this branch of the Keg; the waitress was all over the table with great attitude, If I remember correctly her name was Emmy; Food was perfect, we ordered Kids steak for the kids and Steak Salad and different types of steaks and also few desserts after our dinner, all great. My Steak was cooked to perfection exactly as I was expecting it; the wine we ordered was really good too, recommended by the waitress. Overall, great experience, will definitely repeat, also recommend to all my friends. Thanks the Keg team."}
{"text":"Didn't know most businesses along 4th closed early. We were looking for a light snack before bed. Decided to checkout the Keg-we were not disappointed. Got their sliders and baked potatoes with bacon. Our experience was top notch. Food was amazing. Best late night snack ever."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've been to The Keg, and I'm reminded why it's been so long. For me, this restaurant used to be a place where you paid a little more for a nice dinner, but could expect a great steak, good service and overall a great night out. However, in recent years, their standard for all of the above has decreased greatly (much like so many other chain restaurants do when they grow so much that their quality suffers)... and with so many new, wonderful restaurants opening up... well, who needs The Keg? I came here only because I was at the Westin downtown on a Sunday evening, where 90% of the restaurants in the surrounding area are closed on weekends (really, Calgary, what's up with that?) I ordered a Caesar salad ($7.50) topped with steak (+$10) - how could that possibly be screwed up? Oh, but it can. First of all, I made the mistake of coming here on Mother's Day (I take FULL responsibility for this one), so I knew better than to wait for a table, I asked for my order to go. I was told it would be approximately 20-minutes... totally understandable based on the crowd. As I waited, I saw walk-in customers be turned away because the restaurant was at capacity with reservations alone. I think about 2-3 groups had been turned away before the hostesses started offering bar-seating as an option... I was surprised it had taken them so long to figure that one out and, in the process, had lost some revenue.  The ONLY great thing I have to say about this location are about the hostesses, and the few (I presume) managers who stopped by the hostess table: they were incredibly friendly. During my wait, where I stood awkwardly by myself at the entrance, they all had smiled and made sure I was taken care of, chatted with me a little and offered recommendations on food (although I'd already placed my order, they caught me looking, as usual, at the dessert menu). I watched as they greeted everyone who came in, and tried to accommodate different seating/food requests. That being said, I stood there for longer than 20-minutes (as I watched an entire period of hockey, and then some, on the bar TV's) before one of the hostesses must have realized it and asked one of the managers to check on my meal. He returned immediately ready-to-go which I knew meant one of two things: either 1. he just happened to get there as my meal was being plated, or 2. it had been sitting, waiting a while for someone to get it... I'll give you all one guess as to which scenario happened. The manager DID apologize for the wait, threw in some bread and candy, and I was off to my hotel room to eat...  My salad was small, the medium-rare steak was more like medium (either he cooked it too long, or it really had been sitting and waiting for so long under the heater that it continued cooking) and not very warm at all... I was so disappointed, yet not surprised at all. The Keg has simply gone down in quality, and that's the plain and simple truth. Calgary's bound to have better steaks out there, and you're all better off searching for it elsewhere..."}
{"text":"Keg's a Keg's a Keg.  This time, in Calgary with worse service.  OK, so every time I travel to Calgary the hospitality is lacking, service wise, I don't get it.  Do servers expect a tip when service is bad?  Food was average, for a steak house my medium steak was well done, they apologized and promptly replaced it with a perfectly medium steak.  Server staff needs improvement, management promptly attended to my over cooked steak and even took it off my bill without me asking.  Great outdoor patio!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere here. Great for a social event or just drinks after work. Came here after work for appies and drinks. So we got a few dishes to share: MUSHROOMS NEPTUNE BAKED GARLIC SHRIMP GARLIC CHEESE TOAST  Loved their signature starters. I was told their escargot are really good but I am not a big fan of escargot. So the mushroom Neptune was so cheesy and you can taste the crab meat in every bite. The baked garlic shrimps was cheesy too. Total of 6 small shrimps. It tasted good and best of all the butter at the bottom is great for dipping the small bun that came with it. Loved the garlic cheese toast. Made fresh and very garliciky and cheesy.   Service was good. We came after work and it wasn't too busy at all. A few tables. But the location of this Keg is so central. Lunch time is crazy pack. I see it full all the time when walking by.   Nice you won't be disappointed.   Their steaks are good here if you feel like red meat."}
{"text":"Been here several times for lunch and a few times for dinner. Reservations are recommended.  Service- hit and miss, 3/5 stars Ambience- 4/5, it's not too loud but quite dark and the lights and decor are very neat. Like how the space is used as they have Round tables in a nook, squares, rectangles etc to suit a wide range of crowds. The patio is good too.  Food- 3.5/5. I know what to expect here which is a good solid meal. I always get steak with salad or a steak entree with baked or mash potatoes and veg. Prime rib is consistent. I get medium rare and it's never been over cooked. The hot horse radish on the side is tasty too. This is reasonably priced for what you get but offers nothing unique. If you want a solid steak meal, absolutely go here!!! If you're seeking divine foodie sublimeness/ walk on by."}
{"text":"The service here is awful!! Asked to be notified for a table on the patio while we sat at the bar and we were told too... \" if you see one run for it\". Wow. Not cool."}
{"text":"Last night was my first visit here and I don't need to go back.    The decor is nice but the area we sat in with tables is very crowded when they are full and I couldn't walk between the chairs.  I had to take the long way around the room in order to not disturb other patrons.  Our server was young, awkward and sheepish.    I had the Chicken Oscar and I've never had a sub-par Keg meal until now.  My spouse also didn't think his was that great either.  We both felt the garlic mashed potatoes were dry and my chicken needed much more sauce.    We sat under a chilly ceiling vent, which could not be controlled (we asked).  I was impressed that a manager came out to offer us a different table, but the place was packed and it just wasn't worth the effort to move.    If I were to go back, I'd prefer to sit in the lounge and just enjoy appetizers and a beverage."}
{"text":"if you skip lunch because you are fishing from 5am until 10pm, then almost anything you eat at the keg is worthy of 5 stars....  but if you return the next night trying to recapture the glory of your midnight snack you will be disappointed....  starters and steaks are good - not superb  good beers and wines by the glass"}
{"text":"It is good.. But the service is just ok... I went there for business and It was not bad... The beef was good... I think the service can be improved.."}
{"text":"Lunch today was very enjoyable.  Had the lobster and shrimp salad.  Light and satisfying.    1) service: outstanding.  Our server was witty and prompt.  Knew when to give space.  The host took are coats and bags right away.   2)cleanliness:  a big deal for me, and this place is above average.  Very clean 3) ambiance: very warm and inviting  4) food:  was fantastic.  Can't wait to try larger entries      Highly recommend"}
{"text":"I honestly think this is the BEST customer service I've ever received in Calgary. This last Saturday, my adorable hubby & I celebrated our wedding anniversary here. He had a big juicy burger (the kind that needs to be eaten with a knife & fork). I had the butter chicken flatbread. Both were pretty good. However, I would like to state that our waiter, Matthew, was the friendliest, most attentive and considerate waiter I have seen in a very long time. He made our experience even more enjoyable than it already was, but to top it off, when they found out it was our wedding anniversary, they treated us to an 'on-the-house' brownie sundae, which was really romantic :) If there was a 6th star on here I would rate with it!"}
{"text":"Even here a few times for business dinners. The keg is a trendy place with plenty of people dinning on their corporate expense. The prices reflect the clientele. I've had the filet and bacon wrapped chicken which have both been good. The better part of the dinners has always been the wines. Standard selections you know and love. Good times with good people but not sure I'd venture in on my own dime."}
{"text":"Stopped in with a coworker for a late meal/second dinner (because I ALWAYS have room in my stomach for steak!).  The Keg is a higher-end chain steakhouse in Canada - this particular location was attached right to our hotel in downtown Calgary (the Westin) so it was quite convenient.  We sat at the bar - I ordered from their \"Keg Classics\" menu, which lets you select one of their prime steaks, a salad, as well as a side for a reasonable price.  My Caesar salad was fine - just your standard Caesar, nothing fancy or dressed up about it.  For my steak, I ordered a 14 oz Prime Rib.  The meat was REALLY tender and delicious, and the au jus was excellent.  My only sticking point is that only 2/3 of the meat was edible - the rest of it was purely fat that had to be trimmed off.  I felt like I was paying quite a lot for a small (albeit delicious) portion of meat.  The sides were disappointing.  It came with a side of sautéed mushrooms and asparagus, and you can tell the restaurant definitely treats sides as an afterthought rather than something important to accompany the steak.  Bummer.  I judge a good steakhouse not just on the quality of the steaks but also on the sides, and Keg fell flat here.  OVERALL: 3/5.  Service was slow and not very attentive.  Not a bad place to grab a steak, but nothing really jumped out and wowed me.  On the other hand, prices were reasonable (my meal was only $49 CAD)"}
{"text":"I actually don't understand why most reviews lean toward the lower number of stars. I ate here last night and to be honest, I'd definitely go back. And I'm not one to like going to a restaurant more than once if there are other fun things to try in a town.  I had the Oscar Sirloin, which came with a Bernaise sauce, mussels and shrimp on top of an 8 oz piece of sirloin. I can't say that I had been a fan of Bernaise sauce before I had it here. It was so good I wanted to look up the recipe and try making it at home myself later.   Their seasonal veggie side was one of the best I've had. There were grilled red bell pepper pieces (and nice big pieces, too, that I had to cut up into two or three bite size bits), sauteed onions, mushrooms, zucchini and squash. I have never seen a veggie side plate be that colorful and delicious.   So, heck yes, I'm a fan of this place. Four stars all the way, Keg Steakhouse... You deserve it!"}
