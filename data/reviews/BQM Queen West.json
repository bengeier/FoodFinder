{"text":"I have only been once. I ordered a banquet burger with a side of coleslaw ($13). You get your choice of meat and I had the brisket as I was told it was the juiciest. I ordered it medium rare. I was with a friend and my daughter. My daughter, being 4, ordered a grilled cheese sandwich and fries ($9) and my friend had the sirloin blue cheese burger with fries ($16).  Then began the waiting.... I first noticed something was wrong when I watched our neighbouring table order, eat and pay before I received my food. Another table that came in 20 minutes after us was served before us. Without us saying anything, our server approached the table and told us our drinks would be on the house due to the long wait, but no explanation was offered. Then we ate... The grilled cheese sandwich was good. A nice smokey flavour, but overpriced. It's a GC??!! My burger was juicy but was done well-done. The bacon lacked flavour and was over-cooked. The fries are OK.   The bottom line is that it took us well over an hour to eat a burger for a bill that came to $45 after tax.  There are better places to eat in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I ate at this location twice. If this rating was based off my first visit, I would have rated it 5/5.  The downfall of BQM is the inconsistency. I ate the Hawaiian burger on my first visit and found it juicy, cooked just right and not messy. The second time, the burger was overcooked.  I want to try this place one more time to see if they can improve their burgers."}
{"text":"Was once one of my favourite burger joints, seems to have tumbled down a tad in quality. Judging from my last visit, both my dining partner and I were thoroughly disappointed with our meal. I even found a hair in mine, which I sent back to the kitchen and pretty much meant I wanted to leave.  It's also unfortunate that they changed their menu from the classic, which meant my menu favourite disappeared! Hopefully they make a come back, but I don't know if I'll be going back anytime soon. Sad face."}
{"text":"I've eaten at this diner numerous times (I work across the street and have been eagerly awaiting something to replace stem.) While this location is better than the ossington offshoot, it's still not great. Burgers are over-priced to be served a la carte and although I order medium rare every time I visit - I've yet to see a slighty pink burger. The breakfast (pretty hard to fuck up) tasted like a campfire as everything was grilled. Soggy bread, mini French fries, burnt bacon and raw eggs.  On a separate occasion, I ordered the stem burger (fearful of receiving a disasterous breakfast again) and the egg was also under-cooked. I'm not usually picky but raw egg white dripping from an overcooked burger is hardly appealing.  Conversely, pulled pork poutine is to die for."}
{"text":"BQM on Queen W.  - finally a burger shop that feels more like a restaurant.  Yes, there are many great places to get a burger in Toronto, and though BQM is not the best burger I've ever had, the've done the best job in creating a location that feels more like a restaurant rather than an upscale fast food market.    The menu holds more than meat on a bun, with fantastic sides and tasty salads and a highly underratted breakfast platter.  I mean really, they offer freakn' all sorts of pig on just one plate - I'm in heaven.  I first went to BQM at their innagural location in Leslieville within a month of them opening.  I have to say I was dissapointed for the cost vs quality component.  I went back one more time a few months later to give it a second try, and it was the same but made worse with long line ups and really bad ventilation that made you smell like smoke upon leaving.  Not bad some days (I happen to like smelling like fire) but when you have to go out after not so much.   Years later when I kept hearing about the fantastic things that they had done with the old Stem (yes, I still miss and mourn you Stem West), I thought it was time to give them another go.  I'm so glad I did.  Starting with the space, it has a lovely patio at the front and a lot of the old feel of the Stem still remains on the inside.  Still so diner, I even really like the \"improvised\" look of the draft tap system.  It was a surprise to also find a menu that had more than just burgers, fries, rings and the obligitary veggie burger.  You can actually take non-burger lovin' people here and they would have something to eat!  Please take note other burger places in the city.    I went for the breakfast with PBR as I was still hung over my first time there, but did have some of my dining companion's burger.  It is some tasty, tasty cow.  My breakfast was also absolutly perfect with great attention to detail (my poached eggs medium were better than most brunch places).    The staff are fun and attentive and the only caviat is the size of the booths.  As a tall gal, getting in and out in heels (especially hung over) can be a challenge.    Be sure to check out their daily specials as they have some truly rediculously cheap beer some nights."}
{"text":"I go here at least once a week. Largely due to proximity... But it's a great little place. Service is pretty great, but the number of comfortable seats is limited, ha. High points on the menu for me are the pulled pork poutine, and the mac n cheese (add bacon, trust me). As far as the burgers go - they're great! I actually enjoyed one of the best burgers of my life there this week! However, I have yet to venture away from the \"Stem\" burger (bacon, fried egg, I add cheese) in homage to the many years spent previous enjoying my breakfasts at the old Stem Restaurant. RIP"}
{"text":"My personal favorite is the Riverside Chuck. The tender beef is cooked to order so that you can guarantee your getting a fresh made burger. The service has always been good.  The ambience is relaxing and is a great spot for recharging yourself from the days demands. The patio is also great when the sun is out..."}
{"text":"Went for a burger & onion rings. They asked if I wanted my burger medium, medium-well or well, which I thought was a nice touch. I asked for a medium-well burger. The cost of the two items was about $12.50. Unfortunately the burger was burned, charred and inedible and the bun was cold (for a burger I think it should either be room temperature or toasted). The onion rings were decent but the burger simply should not have been served as it was."}
{"text":"Friday night...Queen Street West.  Busy strip, lots of restos.  Recommendation: choose another place.  Here is why:  We needed food and heard about this place from some friends so we decided to check it out to see what the fuss was all about.  I guess because of the hype, I was expecting more.  Our waitress was new so we can forgive the fact that she didn't know the menu 100%.  But being new is no excuse for NOT taking our order properly nor coming back to check up on us after our food arrived, especially since there were problems:  - I asked for a beer and a glass of water, only got the beer.  Eventually got the water.  - I asked for onion rings as the side, didn't come with the burger.  Eventually got the rings but after the burger was finished and after I asked for them again. They still charged me for it....ridiculous.  Any reputable place would have comp'ed the rings since they were forgotten and came way late in the meal.  At the very least, give an apology for the tardiness.  No apology.  - Friend asked for fries as the side, didn't come with the burger.  Never came.  No apology nor explanation.  - Friend asked for no bacon on the burger, it came with bacon.  No apology nor explanation.  Food: Meh.  Frankly, I've had better burgers at Jack Astor's and Milestone's. Service: Awful.  Frankly, I've had better service at McDonald's inside Walmart in Scarborough.  Would I go back?  Likely not.  Queen Street West offers many, many options for meals.  Restaurants have one chance to make an impression on clientele.  This place failed miserably."}
{"text":"Cool little kitschy diner and very convenient to the Horseshoe Tavern. Grabbed a beer, burger, and Pulled Pork Poutine before seeing the Cults at  the Horseshoe. Definately the highlight was the poutine. Very tasty. Excellent service too. I got the balsamic portbello mushroom burger but probably could have just gone with the Poutine and been quite fine. Definately will be using this for some pre-concert food and drink for now on."}
{"text":"Was wondering by the other day and was craving comfort food, thinking about ordering fries and gravy when my server Olivia let me know about the soup. thought, 'I'll be good' and ordered that instead. It was amazing, so hearty and filling, you could taste the love. All in all, a great experience. I sat at the bar and chatted with my server and whiled away a lovely hour."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, as its around the corner from where I live. The patty is decent but the bun is terrible - and to add insult to injury - the patty/bun ration is completely out of whack.   In short - if McDonald's made a gourmet burger - it would taste like this but be 1/3 the price."}
{"text":"Good food and friendly staff. Too bad it was probably the worst service I've ever had. Took 10 minutes to order, 15 min to get my drink, and then another 10 min before my food arrived. My bill showed up before I asked though."}
{"text":"There are two good things about this place; the service and the decor. The food on the other hand wasn't up to scratch. I had The Shoppe with a soy patte and sweet potato fries. The patte didn't taste of anything, the combination of the garlic and herb cheese (which tasted exactly like philadelphia) with chipotle aioli and caramalised onions was strange. The sweet potato fries also lacked in flavour and the garlic dipping sauce hardly tasted of garlic. With so many burger places around Toronto, I'd definitely give this place a miss."}
{"text":"Maybe I was just hungry but everything that was ordered tasted spectacular!  I'm a fan of burgers but have been disappointed by many overhyped burger joints.  BQM hit all the spot: Fresh buns - check Juicy patty - check Giant onion rings - check Refreshing coleslaw - check Snobby beer - check  The seating could've been better but wasn't that big of a deal.  We had a group of 6 in a longer but still tight table.  The service was good and our food came fairly quick so no complains in that department.  The place itself is pretty cool, nothing pretentious.  I would recommend this place to burger lovers; just don't go in a big group.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Gave them another try today, and I won't be back.  A $13 burger should be topped with fresh ingredients, not canned crap.  I ordered my burger \"medium\" - apparantly their chef doesn't know what this means.  There was not a trace of pink in my meat, and the burger patty literally crumbled apart as I ate it.  I'm not sure if that was a resut of the cooking, or the general poor quality of the burger, but it was definitely a turn off.  Good riddance BQM!"}
{"text":"I ordered the \"Ossington\" Portobello, mozzarella, balsamic glaze & garlic aioli. It was pretty good. My partner ordered the \"BQM\"  AAA sirloin ground in-house with caramelized onions, horseradish & garlic aioli and he said it was average. We both got med rare and chuck cut (cheapest of the 3).  We ordered a side of fries - we could tell they were end of the day batch that were reheated or refried, we left them unfinished. No idea what fresh ones taste like.  Probably wouldn't go back for the burgers, but I will for the location - it being smack downtown complete with a patio."}
{"text":"The first week it opened this place got rave reviews so I was seriously disappointed both times that I've gone.  I went there for the first time a couple weeks after they had opened and on a Sunday evening.  The service was quick and friendly but food was just off.    I asked for a \"medium\" burger but the patty on my  \"Stem\" burger tasted so burnt -- It was like eating at some random outdoor park BBQ where no one cleans the grill.  My boyfriend got the Tofu burger and really liked it.  I had a taste and agreed.  They were out of onion rings so the fries and salad that we got were alright but nothing spectacular.  I figured that maybe late Sunday eve is not the optimal time to go eat dinner so we went back just last week, Sunday at lunch time.  Gah! Once again, asked for a medium and the patty was nowhere near pink and the burnt taste was even WORSE.  I couldn't even finish eating the entire burger.  I tried eating the \"insides\" of the patty but it was flattened and hard to salvage.  The meat didn't have much flavour to it either.  My boyfriend ordered the Mac and Cheese.  It was cheesy and had a touch of herbs -- good but didn't have that oven broiled crispiness that we like about Mac and Cheese.  He also ordered onion rings and there must have been serious miscommunication between staff because the cook ended up GIVING AWAY OUR ONION RINGS TO THE TABLE RIGHT NEXT TO US as if we hadn't ordered it.  The waitress didn't even acknowledge this error.  Overall, this last visit was a complete letdown and we will never return again considering that Oh Boy burger is just down the street, and Craft Burger is a small walk away."}
{"text":"After having multiple awesome experiences at the BQM on Ossington, I decided to try out this location with a couple of my friends that were both BQM virgins.   Unfortunately, this experience wasn't as amazing as it has previously been, not even close. The service was quite poor as there was only one server and one chef which for a Thursday night, seems pretty absurd.   When it came time to order, I asked for tomatoes on the side instead of in the burg, (a reasonable request in my mind) and got a pretty rude response; 'we cant do that for you - I mean, I cant push a button to get the tomatoes off'. I was visibly annoyed by her comment and while I decided to let it go, I also decided never to come back to the resto again. For me, good service in the service industry is an important part of dining out. The burger itself was okay; medium with aged cheddar and avocado. It certainly wasnt the best i've ever had but I did enjoy it with the poutine and balsamic beet salad.   The restaurant had also run out of dessert that night.  Ill stick with the Ossington location in the future. Great service with a smile.  Helpful tip: If you do want to go, arrive before or around 7pm to avoid a crazy rush and 20minute wait."}
{"text":"I was immensely disappointed with this place, what with me liking burgers and all, and expecting a good one here. Not the case, here. I ordered their standard burger; I asked for it medium, my GF asked for hers medium-rare.   We received gray, dry-as-a-sock burgers on a HUUUGE bun that was also quite dry. Having ordered the sweet potato fries, we expected what most people would expect - long, strand of potatoes. We instead got what I can only describe as 'sweet potato nubs'.   These were tiny, pencil eraser sized french fries that either were the bottom of the french fry bowl, or someone cut the fries the wrong way. we had to eat them with a spoon as if it was a bowl of dry cereal. The server kindly took it off the bill, but the bottom line: not a good meal. I'll probably visit again, but my expectations will now be low."}
{"text":"Remember to do your jaw stretches or the panko crusted tofu burger with roasted beet, goat cheese and arugula will school you. No ketchup or mustard necessary. The tofu was thick and piping hot and all the dressings tasted so good together.   Unnecessarily, but deliciously I ordered the hash browns on the side. They were also hot, hot, hot with inviting flecks of salt. Perfect with their golden crust and then the soft potato inside.   The best part? The staff! Really attentive but comfortable and they gave a few tables free tofu scramble! It's some mix of tofu, beans and a tomato sauce that was smoky, yummy and smoking hot in temperature.  I've never come upon this issue before, everything was so steaming hot that it actually hurt. Lose-lose situation, it is painful to eat before cool and painful to wait for everything to cool down."}
{"text":"Nothing outstanding for the price.  It's cool that you can choose your cut of meat for the pattie- chuck, brisket, or sirloin.  I got onion rings, which don't come as a side to the burger, but an entire huge side. Fine. Then they failed. The batter was strange like panko or something.  I couldn't eat them all, so I tried to give them to a homeless woman who denied them.  What does that say?"}
{"text":"So my 300th review will be for my love of burgers, and I had the pleasure of stumbling upon this place for lunch today!   They've got a nice little patio, and have daily specials posted right by the door. The interior is clean and is decorated with more menu items hanging on the walls. I would have ordered the Beets Burger if I saw that first.  I ordered the Ossington Chuck ($9) that comes with portobello mushrooms that complemented the juicy patty (medium) very well. It's very messy to eat, but the meat is super flavorful you'd just let the juice dribble down your chin.   All burger orders do not come with any sides - I'm not a fan of having to order my fries separately and $9 is a bit pricey for just the burger alone. You can choose the quality of your patty, with the Chuck being the cheapest at $9 and the most fatty. The brisket is $11 and for a leaner option, the sirloin is a great choice at $13.   Service was attentive. Our waitress had no issues doing separate bills or moving us inside from the patio when it got too hot.  They advertise organic and grain-fed cattle, but who knows, a bunch of restaurants are making this claim to jack up prices.   The burger here is tasty, but doesn't come cheap!"}
{"text":"There's no better way to start your day than with loads of unnecessary grease and calories!  We wanted to try this brunch place, but it was closed. We heard that BQM had breakfast (and burgers of course) and decided to check it out.  After reviewing the menu, the brunch items seemed pretty boring compared to the burgers.  So, burgers for breakfast it was!  The Stem burger is what you get when breakfast runs face first into an organic beef patty.  It's a burger with a fried egg on it...with bacon topped with a tomato and garlic mayo.  The onion rings were a perfect side, gigantic and crunchy.  I liked my burger here, but I've been eating a lot of burgers and I can't say the Stem wowed me...probably because it made me feel disgusting."}
{"text":"Easily one of the best burgers I've ever had. I opted for the Riverside sirloin burger, it was perfectly cooked and the toppings were great. I was impressed by the bacon, not burnt to a crisp like most places but fresh and still a bit soft. Wasn't busy at all when I was there so service was great, but I'd be interested to see what it's like when it's packed. Kudos for serving coke in the big glass bottles, even if it was a bit expensive. A hefty cut above the usual diner experience. Definitely eating here again. Extra points for their Paleo bun option (not a bun at all, they wrap the burger in a lettuce leaf!)"}
{"text":"It almost seems cliche to open up a review of BQM Diner by mentioning how much you miss the Stem Restaurant which proceeded it. Sorry, I can't help it. I miss the Stem for being one of the few cool old school diners left in this ever changing city. Alas one must learn to accept change, especially when it comes to restaurants in Toronto. So it is I should find myself at 354 Queen St W for a gourmet burger.  Upon entering BQM Diner I discover the layout to be the same as it's predecessor just with a slightly sharper, more modern look. The kitchen area on the left side of the restaurant seems to have eeked out a few inches towards the dining space on the right, making the dining experience for singles and deuces even more cramped than what was previously experienced with the Stem. The table I sat at was incredibly small, literally a few inches away from being comfortable. Which I'm sure is good for business as it inspires people to eat and go, but for what they charge for burgers I don't care to be pushed through like at a fast food joint. They do have a few four-tops in the rear which makes coming to BQM in a group of 3-4 far more appealing.   The meat used at BQM is of the highest quality being local, organic and hormone free. Burgers are optionally cooked medium or medium well. I ordered the Hawaiian burger at $9., cooked medium and a side small fries at $2. Upon receiving the burger and side I was pleased to see a little pink in my burger, the patty was cooked exactly as I wanted it. The fries were decent but really nothing worth mentioning as exceptional. Over all I was pleased with the food and I feel confident in saying that BQM offers up one of the best beef burgers in the city.   As for service I felt it was competent. As for value for the buck I find BQM to be a tad pricey. I'm sure you can find an equally as good a burger for a couple bucks cheaper, though I suppose not at Queen and Spadina with real estate prices being what they are in this city.   In closing I'll recommend BQM if you are in the area, craving a good burger, willing to pay close to $10 for one and willing to sit at and eat at a tiny table. Here's a tip: $10 special for a burger and a Pabst Blue Ribbon beer."}
{"text":"This place USED to be my favorite burger joint of all time.  They have changed their menu since then, at first allowing you to order their classic burgers but that is no longer the case.  The new menu cut out my favorite burger (forgot the name but the one with blue cheese) and also no longer serve sirloin.   The burger I got instead, the BQM, was sloppy and fell apart in my hands. I also ordered a side of onion rings and literally got 6 rings."}
{"text":"Each new branch of this Toronto-born restaurant has taken on its own little theme. Stem Diner was a historic landmark on the old Queen West strip, back when instead of Crocs and Esprit there was The 360 and the old-fashioned furniture store. I'm glad to see the make-over didn't get rid of Stem's old-timey feel. Although the kitchen is hidden in the back now, instead of right up front, I'll give it a pass. They've updated the bar selection- beers on tap include Blanche de Chamblis and others. Wine selection is decent, too.  Since my review of the Ossington Location, the poutine gravy has changed, and from Yelp photos, I didn't think it was worth it.  My husband and I came here as a 'last meal' before starting a new year's fitness diet. No more burgers, no more fried tofu burger, no more poutine for me.  The Miss Joy's sunshine 'burger' is a huge hunk of well-seasoned panko-crusted deep-fried Tofu.  Apparently the chef, a vegetarian himself, prefers this over the grain-based veggie patty. It came out steaming hot and on a bun with goat cheese, roasted beet (only one slice) and lettuce.  I enjoyed it immensely, even more so knowing that I won't be eating out again for 90 days or so. It was also filling, without getting the fries/poutine on the side.  Prices are resonable considering what the rent must be these days on the strip.  Maybe I'll come back for a salad?"}
{"text":"Great burgers, I've been very happy with everything I've order off their menu.  Sides are ok but not great."}
{"text":"Been to this burger place fairly often when I've been shopping around Queen St. and I have to say it has some of the best burgers in the city. It's nice to see someone put a different twist on a burger as well as have the option of the classic burger. I especially like the ability to choose different types of meat. Also the sides are great, I would definitely recommend the poutine or the mac and cheese!   The service is wonderful! Always pretty quick and everyone is super friendly and fun to be around. I would especially disagree with a previous review of a specific server described as \"an older Asian girl\". First of all, calling out a specific person and identifying them by their race in this type of situation is pretty damn rude. But besides that fact, I have been served several times by this woman and have had nothing but fantastic service from her. She is always pleasant and hard working, even when the place is super busy. I find it hard to believe that someone could have such bad service from her.   All that said, I thoroughly enjoy every experience I've had at BQM and will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Good, solid burgers, OK fries, a tad expensive for the burgers. Good service. Not a burger i'd crave but good enough"}
{"text":"Came here for a casual dinner before a show at the Rivoli since I've heard good reviews about their burgers. I ordered a signature BQM burger with pickles and a side of onion rings. The bf ordered a Hawaiian with a side of sweet potato fries. We also ordered a pint of Okanagan Springs Pale Ale each and chose to enjoy our meal on the patio. Can't say I enjoyed the high-low contrast of the bench vs chair, but for a patio on Queen St, it wasn't too noisy and the umbrellas were nice. The burgers arrived with tentalizingly shiny, brown burn tops. The sides, however looked a bit worse for the wear. Sweet potato fried looked shriveled and burnt (they tasted like the fryer grease needs changin') Onion rings left a pool of oil at the bottom of the bowl and had crunch, but no taste. My medium burger dripped grease, left the bun aofgy, and my hands shiny; there were a couple of dubiously pink bites which I consumed with chargrin. The flavour of the burger came from the generous slather of horseradish. The bf's medium well burger held up better though despite the bacon and pineapple was bland. After tip and tax, the meal came to $54 which is (in my opinion) expensive for the meal we consumed.Think I would've preferred a Hero Burger from across the street."}
{"text":"There are a lot of schmancy burger places in Toronto and until I went here, I felt that Big Smoke Burger was king. Consider them de-throned!  BQM does cost a bit more than a trip to, say, Hero Burger, but not THAT much and it's totally worth it. Only at BQM have I seen the option to choose what cut of beef the burger is made from, instead of just picking the size. Insert obvious quality vs quantity observation here.  The onion rings are large and crunchy, like I like my women, and the beer selection is small but delicious. I had a pint of Blanche de Chambly with my burger that was poured just right. Oh and P.S. the garlic aioli is so tasty I've been inspired to try making my own.  I've also enjoyed a solid breakfast here as well. Still relatively undiscovered, BQM isn't too crowded and they don't blare loud music that makes it hard to enjoy the company of whomever's with you.  When all is said and done, I'd say the only weakness (other then above average prices) of the place is an unavoidable side effect of their big strength. BQM brings in fresh meat every day, which (of course) means your meat will not be re-heated freezer business but also can sometimes lead to them being out of, say, bacon.   It's a good idea to have a second choice ready when ordering, though that's not a problem with burgers as obviously they get plenty of beef for their signature meal.  All in all, I'd say to give it a shot before all the unfortunates at the Queen/Spadina Hero Burger realize they're being overcharged and head elsewhere."}
{"text":"I wish this place was open while I still lived in the area! It's surprisingly hard to find an evening snack in the area that isn't Chinese or Vietnamese food.  I had a burger, and while nothing out of the ordinary, it fed the craving.  Got sweet potato fries as well...be advised they come in a very large serving.  Definitely suitable for splitting between two people.  I wish they offered smaller sides!  The layout inside is diner chic, but they don't overdo it.  I appreciate that they don't seem to be trying too hard to be a cutesy diner.    All in all, this is my favorite place in the area to grab a casual bite to eat (and drink)."}
{"text":"Burger was very tasty, but boy was it expensive.  I had burger, fries and a coke (and there are 2 types of meat, one is better quality which I chose) and it came to $23.05 including tax and tip.  A little steep, maybe next time I will go for their most basic burger and not the higher quality meat.  $23 for one person for a quick lunch is a little on the high priced side."}
{"text":"Bleh! I had the big cheese burger (sirloin) and all I tasted was the charred bread and burger was extremely dry. The burgers does not come with fries and wished I didn't order a side of it. It was thin and soggy. My wife got the mac 'n cheese. The noodles were over cooked and it didn't look appetizing. We sent both back. Wife ordered the tofu burger and I asked for the bun to be changed.  The service was good but the food was horrible. I normally give second chances but I will not come back again."}
{"text":"\"Hey, have you been to the new diner next door?\" seemed to be the looming question yesterday among my friends as we tried to decided were to eat.  It was an unknown and people were definitely interested in this small little establishment tucked between Crocs and Ardene on Queen st.   It's fashioned after a 50's styled dinner with a contemporary indy feel.  Little 2 seaters lining the walls with a couple 4 seater booths.  Probably 30 people max capacity?  Definitely a place where line-ups will surely happen once people catch wind of their fabulous menu.    Ordered a \"Shoppe\" burger, a simple well made gourmet burger that impressed me from the first bite.  It's tough to pull off a delicious burger, even more so when you try do to simple with no gimmicks.  Deliciously soft and juicy meat, spicy mustard with tomatoes and lettuce.  Absolutely loved it.  Now you can't go eating burgers without fries, and being a little drunk I figured you can't order fries with out gravy and cheese.  I decided to get the pulled pork poutine, and I was incredibly happy I did.  Succulent soft barbe-quey pork generously topping some well made fries with cheese just goo-ing everywhere.  Fantastic!  Turns out this is the 3rd installment of the \"Burger Shoppe\" opened on Queen East.  Haven't been there yet, but after this experience, I'm sure as hell going to make the effort.  However, some people might have a problem with the price.  $9 gets just the burger, no sides, nothing.  Now, that's not a huge turn off since the burger was so damn good, but many people might not be so happy to pay extra - poutine was $7.  All in all, this was a fantastic burger experience.  I'm loving the resurgence of gourmet burger joints in the city and this one really impressed.    Oh, they have all day breakfast too I think."}
{"text":"This place really tries hard with kind and attentive service, but the burgers suck.  I ordered a burger medium well and it came out a charred crumbly mess.   I sent it back for a less cooked burger but again I got the same thing with just a bit more red.   After an hour ordeal I was too hungry to complain again.  With so many other burger options in Toronto, I'd leave this place off the list."}
{"text":"This is a quality burger place.   The staff was very friendly and the cheese burger was tasty. The bun was particularly nice.   The sweet potato fries were almost too small and could have used a bit more flavour but still worth getting."}
{"text":"With the Big Mac index as high as it is in Canada, I always shake my head when I go to BQM at Queen and Spadina and see the McDonalds across the street is busier than the delicious diner that I'm sitting in, but no matter, more meat for me!  I've been a fan of BQM since they opened, I work occasionally in the area and on a day when you're doing doubles and especially when I'm biking 20k a day, nothing is better than a juicy burger and a pint.  All their meat is never frozen and the cows are fed vegetarian-only feed and contain no hormones, and you can really tell the difference, the meat is tender, juicy and cooked to perfection (aka, not too well done!)  So here's a tough question , what burger is my FAVOURITE? Well, that's a hard question. The Stem Burger is a personal favourite, with toppings of fried egg, bacon and garlic aioli, nommalicious. Another hard choice would be the Riverside,  which also has bacon, but with mozzarella, BQM BBQ sauce, a gigantic onion ring & garlic aioli.  Top it off with a pint of Blanche de Chambly and a side of fries and you're set. Usually though, I don't even need fries, the burger and the pint is enough!"}
{"text":"Another neighbourhood joint, that I'm a big fan of! The burgers are simply delicious, huge and more than filling. Even my girlfriend, who is big into healthy eating, is a big fan of this burger joint. Yes, the order does not come with fries, but you wouldn't be able to finish all the fries anyways, if they did. That's why, my girlfriend and I, always share an order of fries/onion rings/ or sweet potato fries. I wouldn't be able to finish it on my own. I always order the Riverside burger, because it has all fixings, like cheese, bacon and an onion ring to boot! By the time we finish our burgers, we're glad that we decided to dine-in and have to walk home, otherwise if we had done take-out, we would probably have fall asleep on the couch afterwards, from being so full. I say this from experience.   It's not the best meal in the city, but it is the best BURGER in the city.... in my opinion. So, that's why it gets my 5 stars."}
{"text":"I'll start with a summary of the place: Very expensive for what you get.  At my previous job, a group of us tried a few burger places within a reasonable distance from the office so that we wouldn't be taking an excessively long lunch... well... one where our bosses would notice.  This place was actually the farthest we had to travel.  The burgers start at almost $10 and go up in price based on the part of the cow where your want to meat to be for your patty.  All of us chose the cheapest option and order a few sides to share as they were in addition to the burger.  When we all got our burgers, we came to the consensus that the burger was not worth the price and was actually kind of bland. We did finish our burgers at least. That said, we all agreed that we wouldn't come back or see if the next price-level meat patty would be better."}
{"text":"PBR is on the sign: +4 stars.  Haz hamburgerz: +1 additional starz.  But seriously, it keeps it simple, a Pabst and a burger in a booth where I can snag one before heading to the Horse, done."}
{"text":"Burgert Quest: BQM Diner Dining Experience: Lunch Venue: BQM Dinner Specialty: Burgers Location: 254 Queen Street West, Toronto, ON Menu items: Stem Burger  Oh yes, another Burger joint has made it to Foodies Inc. Burger Quest.  I do have to preface this post by making one big disclaimer; this new addition to the quest only applies to the BQM shop on Queen Street West. I have heard and read many reviews on this chain across town and most of them concur that the taste, service and flavour vary by location. Not really sure why, but that's just the way it is...like the song says.   BQM is a dinner specializing in all things Burger, just like The Yellow Griffin Pub. It offers a variety of burgers with many topping choices, as well as three different kinds of freshly, never frozen, naturally raised, hormone-free AAA Ontario beef. My natural choice out of the bunch was to go for the Stem Burger.   Choosing the Chuck part of the cow for my pattie - oh yeah did I forget to mention you get to choose which side of the cow you want? Chuck, Sirloin or Brisket?...sorry about that - I decided to have my burger accompanied with a fried egg (soft yolk), bacon, avocado, mozzarella cheese, tomato and lettuce. The bun was tasty and fresh, I am sure its store bought but pretty good never the less. The beef was juicy and done to my liking, medium-well; and although it could have used a bit more seasoning, the bacon/avocado addition balanced it out quite nicely.   BQM also offers your typical side options, and although this is extra, my recommend would be to go for their sweet potato fries with a side of their garlic aioli sauce, it brings it all together.  And to drink? A pint of the Steam Whistle, which is their staple beer, would be your best bet.  Until my next quest find!  Buen Provecho, Viviana."}
{"text":"One of my least fav burger joints in the city. Was filling but not much taste. Found the burger to be pretty plain.  Also pretty pricey and they don't hook you up with much fries if you order them on the side."}
{"text":"Went for Burger week and will not be going back.  Some of the worst service I have ever had. They didn't allow take-out for the special which was odd, but which was ok by us. Got a seat and waited in a nearly empty restaurant.  Server was rude telling us we had to sit and couldn't have our Gatoraid on a over 30C day. Asked for medium done(rarer of only two options given) and still the burger came out dry.  The place was filling up at this point and the server was becoming overwhelmed. Took a while to get her attention for the bill and even longer to pay it. Eventually went up to the register to expedite the process.   Note: I must have seen the server turn away 20-30 people looking for take-out on the burger week special. I know the would like to earn a little extra on the promotion, but turning away willing customers just to squeeze a few extra out of them by making them stay and clog up the tables is missing the point. They should have allowed take-out for the burger week special and let the tables open for the regulars. So much lost sales."}
{"text":"Omg, the first specialty burger place that I've felt that the prices were worth it.  Gillian our server was amazing. I mean professional, timely, cool and knowledgeable. Have them explain the meat types so you can really enjoy your experience. I found that since I love rib-eye steaks that brisket burger is more for me. Meat & fat grounded for my burger for taste. My fillet people seemed to like the sirloin burger best.   Here is some meat knowledge that I have learned from my boy who works at Black Angus Meats.  If you go to a butcher and you get a fillet, you will think its the most tender meat there is when you cook it. Unless its Kobe beef or aged steak. But, if you yo to the same market and request fillet of sirloin I highly doubt anyone but the connoisseurs will be able to tell the difference.    That being said, this place has chuck, brisket (my favorite) and sirloin. You just don't see that in regular burger places. You really have to try BQM. P.S. The chorizo poutine is off the hook as well."}
{"text":"A solid meal delivered by great staff. I had the Riverside burger which had an onion ring as one of the toppings. What a delicious touch. I also appreciated the soft bun it came on. The patty was proportionate to the rest of the burger too. A side of fries completed the meal. I'd go back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Queen Street west since I moved here a couple years sure changes fast. I never got a chance to go the place that once resided here. Oh, well. A food loss for me.  However, in its place is this burger joint.  I enjoy its local, organic and hormone free philosophy. It's a great alternative on this busy strip of queen west.   With that in mind, I was excited to try their offerings! When choosing your burger of choice you have the intriguing option of three meat options: chuck, brisket and loin.  I personally prefer the brisket because it has a bit more fat which contributes to Le juiciness.  Sirloin, the leaner cut, if any of you are more or less wanting a burger but dodging the fat, this ones for you.  Note: the sirloin is the pricier option.  All burgers are without sides so for a little extra you have the usual suspects to choose from.  In addition, you have to let the them know if you prefer: medium or medium well done.    A little touch of yesteryear with bottled sodas from Johnnie Ryan and of course, Coca Cola but if you want to throw down that burger with alcohol - go to it! They are licensed.  Hands down this place has fabulous customer service!  Friendly, prompt and funny! I appreciated it.  As for the burger, I was disappointed. It felt short on flavour and juiciness.  The bun itself left nothing to be desired nor did the single but rather large piece of iceberg lettuce.  If this burger was juicy and followed through on its description I would have given it more but sadly it was abysmal and  overpriced.  It's customer service is why this place receives 3/5 but food 2/5."}
{"text":"Hey BQM,  Don't serve me a white tomato on my $13 dollar burger and think I won't notice. Geez. If you're going to put so much effort into sourcing the 'best' beef, you'd think the rest of the burger would be just as special. But it was one disappointment after another ....  And what happened to the fries? They're not what they used to be.   Onion ring fail. The batter was literally sitting next to way-to-thick sliced onion. The batter didn't stick to the onion. #FAIL   Oh, You forgot my fries in my take out order. But you probably don't care.   Your Mac & cheese is revolting. What the hell was up with that flavorless white runny flour sauce you poured on top of the overdone boiled macaroni? And then MORE of those insulting white gritty tomatoes diced up on top!?   We live in Ontario! It's the end of June!  You're telling me you couldn't source local,  ripe tomatoes?     I was so upset by this take out order, I send my boyfriend back to return it. Refund, please.  It's all out of principle. Your consistency has always been an issue for me, but this is a deal breaker.     I'm officially over you, BQM. I've thrown your takeout menu away.  NOTE: The interior has been fully changed. More seating, and standing area to eat.  My guess is that it happened over the past few months, based on the time that's passed since me last visit.. Makes me wonder what else has changed ..."}
{"text":"The food is tasty as hell here!  Burger are good, chicken is excellent, haven't tried the veggie burgers but I'm sure they are just as good.  I like that you can choose how well you want it cooked and which toppings you want on it.  The fries are nice and crispy too!  Only problem we had with this place is it took FOREVER to get the food.  Like 45min - 1hr. which is really ridiculous.  We had to get it to go (we were sitting down to eat) because it took so long.  The server was really nice and gave us 25% off though so that was good at least."}
{"text":"The Good: You can get medium rare sirloin burgers or medium chuck burgers. Toppings are fresh, patties are nicely seasoned.  The Bad: The beef's overworked. When you mix in the seasonings, the danger is you overwork the meat and instead of loose and juicy, it's tighter and rubbery. The sweet potato fries we got were basically the crumbs. We needed a spoon to pick them up. The explanation was because they're handcut. That's BS. I make them at home and they're the length of the sweet potato. Unless they use 1/4\" sweet potatoes, what we got was the stuff at the bottom of the fryer.  Service was fine, but they need to not over work the beef when mixing in the seasonings and tighter quality control on the product so they don't send out a bowl of fried sweet potato bits."}
{"text":"We are loving the fact that the Burgershoppe Quality Meats has opened up another location on Queen West (we go to the Queen East location too!)  The meat is always of the best quality!  Organic and they do recommend cooking at \"medium\".  Yes a little more for a burger - but well worth it. Right now they do have another special on if you are dining for 2; between 4-8 pm you can get two burgers and one side for $20. This is a $2-5 savings depending on what you get as a side.  My fav burger is the B+B (blue cheese and bacon) - very good! They also do sweet potato fries (done as thinner frite style).  They are licensed so for a Thu or Fri night it is a great place for a casual date night!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Meh.  A large variety of burger choices (which just means different toppings), and your choice of three cuts of meat - chuck, brisket, or sirlion.  Most burgers are $9, $11, or $13, depending on which of the three cuts of meat you choose.  These prices do not include sides.  I had a Hawaiian on brisket.  It was a decent burger, but I don't feel it justified the price.  This burger is almost $15 when you factor in tax and tip, and getting dangerously close to $20 if you want fries with it.  It's nice to be able to choose a higher quality meat, but I'm not sure I could tell the difference once the bacon, cheese, pineapple, and aioli was added.  The service was friendly without being annoying, but the overall experience was underwhelming."}
{"text":"Pros: - friendly staff - good food  Cons: - slow service - cramped place  10 coworkers and I came here during lunch.  The waitress asked two people who were occupying a large table if they were willing to move over so we all sit together which they did.    Food:  They have daily specials, so I ended up ordering \"The Shoppe\" (pronounced shop) .  The burger was good, but not amazing. I am not sure what happened in the kitchen, but it took them over 45 minutes to deliver the food to us.  After the food was delivered we received 10% discount and a free poutine.    Service: As mentioned above, the service was not that slow (yes, the place was full, but they did not have ppl. doing take out).  The 10% discount was a nice touch, otherwise my view of the place would definitely be much worse.  Apart from it being slow, the service was good.  Locale: The place is a bit cramped, it has a small patio area which has benches, but no tables (When i saw it it was November, so due tot he cold they might have removed them.  I would go again if it is a few ppl., and we are not time constrained"}
{"text":"I think I liked BQM for the wrong reason-the fact that you can also eat something that isn't a burger if you like!  My friend MB was visiting from Texas and craving a burger and we decided to check this place out. We sat on the sunny patio, watching the world go by on Queen West. Staff were friendly and allowed us just the right amount of time to peruse the menu. MB went for the Hawaiian burger and ordered sweet potato fries (sides are separate). I had a green salad with grilled chicken ($4 extra) and added some pear for $1. The green salad comes with a shallot dressing which they were happy to provide on the side. MB was very happy with her burger and pronounced that it hit the spot perfectly.   Loved the server who was very friendly but down to earth and who was happy to take a photo to commemorate MB's trip. I also liked feeling like I had a healthy lunch in the sun at a burger joint so we both left happy. Of course, I spent the rest of the day eating cookies, chocolate and Nutella...but it's all about balance, right?"}
{"text":"I had breakfast here recently, it's ok, with a small 'o'.  The poached eggs were a little over-poached, the homefries were actually fine, the toast a little limp, and the bacon, well, just bacon really.  There's nothing about the place that I'd describe as memorable in any respect, perhaps I should have waited until lunch and had the burger."}
{"text":"One of the best burger joints in town! The Riverside burger is incredible and the burgers are huge and packed with flavor. The beef is quality and can be swapped out for veggie/soy if you're so inclined. Also tried the \"Hawaiian\" which comes with a big slice of pineapple. Tastes great- the pineapple give a fresh burst to the burger. Can't decide if I like it Medium-Well or just Medium... done medium the meat is still juicy and a little pink in the center, but done medium-well it tends to get a bit of tasty crisp and chewiness.   Love how they kept the feel of The Stem alive (even in the menu options). The fries are awesome and seasoned really nicely but I wasn't a big fan of the rings (a bit flavorless), so if you go I suggest getting the fries!"}
{"text":"My first review on Yelp, so bear with me. I'm not impressed. Ive been once, and friends have been one additional time  The food is decent (in my case a burger), but subpar considering the price and the alternatives nearby.  What really irked me was the fact that they charge per glass (which isn't large) for drip coffee. The hipster waiter made sure to tell me that the coffee was quite expensive and had just been roasted last week. Fine, but when I go to a brunch place, I don't expect to pay $6 for coffee.   Considering I and quite a few friends live nearby, we were quite excited that this place had opened. Unfortunately, we've all decided to not go back."}
{"text":"Best poutine I've ever had. I can die now! love the crispy pot fries too!"}
{"text":"Hello my name is Kate. And I love boogers. I mean burgers.  Sorry couldn't help myself. Sometimes I have the humor of a 5 year old. Moving on! Burger talk time!   As a burgers and beer enthusiast, BQM fits my needs. Yummy beers and even yummier burgers. Not to mention the yummy poutine as well. All of this at a price my student wallet can afford?! Sign me (and my tummy) up!  The staff are nice and the booths are cozy. I went on a date here once, and yes I chose the location. Did the date go well? No. But my delicious burger (which had an onion ring in it!) comforted me.   With it's convenient Queen St. W location, I've been here many times but have yet to eat on their patio! Add that to my places to try and patio this summer list!  Over all? Yum. Go."}
{"text":"I really really like this place. I haven't had their burger in over a year; this time it was a quick pit stop but I think it's definitely something Queen St. West needed.   VIBE  It's a modern diner. The perfect sized booths for one or two in robin blue colour are accented by panneled printed wallpaper on the walls. When you're working with a diner, you only want simple understatements. In the decor realm, this works.  Service is friendly and prompt.   I ATE Fries and gravy. It was GOOD gravy. Thick and salty, just the way I like it. The fries were plentiful.  I remember the burger being good a year ago but I need to come back.   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  A good pit stop if shopping amongst three H&M's in the span of an hour."}
{"text":"I haven't had a burger like  this in quite a while!  I ordered the pulled pork sliders for appetizers I must say they were pretty good on the soft bun. I loved how they had coleslaw on the side rather than in the sandwich, which I can not stand. I ordered the Big Cheese burger chuck and it was great! It was slightly overcooked than what I asked for, but it was still juicy and bursting with juices and flavors.   The service was fast and friendly, and would definitely go back and order the Riverside which I hear is a favorite."}
{"text":"Decent food but pretty expensive for burgers & fries. I had the chicken sandwich with avocado with sweet potato fries. I didn't get the impression that the fries were frozen, which is a big plus but they were a little moist for my liking. The chicken sandwich was good and the avocado was fresh but the piece of chicken I got was pretty small. Additionally, this restaurant's seating is extremely cramped. Even the anemic hipsters present had to squeeze into the booths. Not a bad place but overpriced for what you get."}
{"text":"Probably the worst service I've encountered in a long time. My girlfriend and I were in Toronto on a short mini-vaca from the States and after a long drive we were hankering for some decent food. We stopped here and were promptly seated and our drink orders were taken.  However, after that is when it took a turn for the worst. No one ever came back to get our food order. In fact, we were a bit unaware of the process so my girlfriend even went up to the counter to ask if if we had to place our orders there. I think we were in a change of shifts and the lady that served us there on our assumed our food order had been placed when it hadn't.  The food came out and it was quite delicious. I'm pretty picky about my burgers and it was juicy, full-flavored and just quite good. I appreciate the fresh/organic stuff.  However, once again, service dropped the ball and we were left idle for what felt a very long time without anyone checking in on us. I asked for a water that I also never received.  Given the opportunity, I'd give this place a second chance based on how good the food was. But the service was seriously terrible."}
{"text":"Um...yum. Stopped in here for lunch and had the Big Cheese with some sweet potato fries.  I'd never been here before, either as BQM or Stem, so I was surprised at how teeny it was inside. Still, it wasn't horrible. The service we had was great, the waitress was pleasant and attentive.  The burger: Delicious. It's nice to find a place in this city that lets you pick how you want it cooked, so I took advantage of that and had it cooked medium. It was spot on. It tasted homemade...which is good and not-so-good. Good in a way that it was familiar, and not-so-good in a way that I could probably make something at home that tastes the same and costs 1/2 the price. There wasn't anything about it that set it apart, flavour-wise. Don't get me wrong, I fully and completely enjoyed it.  The sweet potato fries: holy crap. I'd be lying if I said I didn't award two stars for these ALONE. They were shoestring, small, CRISP. Just done perfectly the way I like them. The one bummer was that the large wasn't really...large. And it was $5. That's pretty pricey....but they were so damn good that I almost don't care. Kinda chinzy that they make you pay $1 for a dip for them. Come on. Almost everywhere that offers sweet potato fries will give you a chipotle mayo dip for free.   I'll probably come back and try the Stem burger. I've always wanted a fried egg on a burger, but I've been too chicken to try it (no pun intended)."}
{"text":"Good drink specials: $2 half-pints after 3pm I think.  Poutine is sub-par. Probably among the worst I've tried at a burger place.  The burger was dried out and only ok. Even though it was pink inside, it was completely dried out. It left me thinking \"that's it?\" I was expecting more from this place since I've had great burgers at the Queen East location.  Not good value for money because the food wasn't that good. You could get a much better burger and poutine at Craft Burger down the street at King and Spadina.  The server was friendly but got defensive when we were taking pictures of the funny beer fridge (with a Homer Simpson drawing). Perhaps she thought we were trying to take a picture of her.   Now I understand why a restaurant in the big shopping area of Queen West would be almost completely vacant."}
{"text":"I've been twice now and each time I had a great meal. It's a tiny place so expect to get to know your neighbours.  The first time I had a swiss cheeseburger with a side salad. I know, can you trust someone who has salad with a burger but I had just been told by my doc that I had to do something about my cholesterol. Anyway, it was too much food, the burger patty was large and had a little pink in the middle and oozed juice and the toppings were generous. I barely touched the salad.  The second time I went with the blue cheese and no side, and left feeling full, satisfied, and ready to face the crowds at the King Tut AGO exhibit."}
{"text":"MY favorite hamburger shop in Toronto. you get to choose your cut and they even have a paleo option for paleo dieters like me . Service is super friendlily and beer selection is above average. I've had my order screwed up once or twice ..but everything else makes up for this ."}
{"text":"We were looking for a patio seating place for breakfast near the area and I found this place on Yelp, figuring Diner would indicate diner type food. After sitting down and looking through the menu, it turns out that this place is not really a diner, but a relatively expensive burger joint. The only diner-esque food that was served was their all day breakfast (3 eggs, home fries/salad, toast, bacon) for $8.   I ordered their cappuccino ($3.50) and grilled chicken club sandwich served in a burger bun($9). I was pleasantly surprised by how great my chicken sandwich was, although it seemed small and naked sitting there on a big white plate for $9. We ended up ordering sweet potato fries ($5) to complete the meal. It was a pretty mouthwatering sandwich even though I don't think it was worth $9"}
{"text":"I'm going to have to say it's one of the better burger joints I've been to. Better than Five Guys or any other chain restaurant I've been to.  I ordered the Ossington Brisket when I was there. One of the best tasting burgers I've had in a long time. Meat was super tender and juicy with the sauces and portobello adding a nice flavour to it.   Also, tip for people going: the orders of fries are huge. Splitting an order between two people is recommended."}
{"text":"Please don't eat here if you are going to be paying with a $20 bill.  Our floor at work has implemented \"Burger Fridays\" where we try different burger joints around the city to determine Toronto's best burger, and today we have confirmed that it is NOT here.  Called in 40 minutes ahead (11:00) to place an order for 13 people.  Asked to have separate bills since we would be paying all in cash and it is easier to dole out change if the amounts are kept separate.  Haven't run into any problems so far until today.  Server said she was cool with that but \"didn't have any small bills.\"  I told her we had several people paying with smaller bills so that should make change for those paying with $20s.  When we got to the restaurant, the server said she only  had a \"float\" of 2-$20s.  What restaurant that has been in business for more than 5 minutes has a $40 float to start?  We asked her if she could make change and she was not very acommodating, even though: 1) there was a bank right beside the place; 2) there were about 5 customers total who were eating; 3) there was another server there.  We tried to employ reasoning and asked what would happen if 13 people walked in there at that moment and wanted to pay with $20s, and we got an answer that resembled nonsense.  We paid and left.  Drama.  The food - 12/13 people think the burgers were bland, dry and not worth the price.  They also overcharged us be leaving out items in our order.  The decor - didn't really notice because I was too busy playing banker for them.  Overall, would not return and wouldn't recommend eating here, neither would an entire floor in a nameless Toronto office building.  Sorry BQM Diner, poor service + poor food = one star"}
{"text":"Two words: Palmer Poutine. It's a kick-ass poutine with bacon and caramelized onions, SOOOO GOOOOOOD!!! I think it's just as good, if not better than Smokes Poutinery. Great selection of beers and the service was prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"Good food, although I was bummed they were out of coleslaw.  There was one server who seemed slammed by the unexpected (?) wave of customers on a beautiful Tuesday evening and as a result, our table service was a little quick and dirty.  Totally decent experience and my friend's burger looked delicious."}
{"text":"The meat was dry, under seasoned and over-cooked; the \"brisket\" tasted the same as a \"regular.\" And why bother asking how I would like it done if it's going to come to me well done, anyway? The prices were SUPER high for something of this poor quality - the Sirloin burger from A&W is better than the food at this place. The side of onion rings cost $5 and literally had about 8 onion rings in it. The food was cold when it arrived and SUPER slow! Our waiter was unattentive, took our food to the wrong table and it took him a good 5-10 minutes to bring us our bill. The other waitress who was working there walked into me as I was coming back from the washroom and when I had to apologized to her she didn't even say a word in response. We were almost late getting back to work from a simple burger lunch."}
{"text":"really amazing burger place, lots of variety as to burger meats.  excellent place for poutine with sausage in it  great pricing  highly recommended"}
{"text":"Their burgers are not bad; everything else on the menu = approach with caution.  Their little patio is nice in the summer while enjoying their beer specials."}
