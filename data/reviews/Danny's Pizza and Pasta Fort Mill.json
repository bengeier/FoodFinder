{"text":"The pizza dough was incredibly rubbery and the wings we ordered had absolutely no sauce on them. When we picked up the food, they almost forgot our order of wings. When we asked them to check the boxes to make sure all the food was there, they seemed confused. I feel like it's pretty standard practice to check to make sure you get everything you pay for? I honestly wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"I have been so pleased to have Danny's in my neighborhood, and have been a regular customer.  However, it seems since the Doby's Bridge store opened the management and service have not only suffered but disappeared.  The last three times I have placed a pickup order, I arrived at specified time only to find out my order had not been started.  Last night, I inquired about the timing after paying and was promptly barked \"Six minutes\" by a tall skinny guy in dark glasses.  He then quickly yelled at the young lady running the cash register, \"tell everyone its going to be an hour\".
The food is very good, but the service has completely overshadowed my desire to deal with the service issues."}
{"text":"NY Pizza here! Best around. I thought when I moved from NY that I would be missing my pizza :( Then I ordered a pie from Danny's and was pleasantly surprised!! Love this place."}
{"text":"I had a sandwich and the meet was practically nonexistent on their Italian it had literally 14 slices of pepperoni one slice of ham and one slice of a different ham very thin each piece for a total of 1 ounce of meat it seemed. No way was 2 oz!
Lots of filler stuff (greens/peppers) but hardly any protein!!!!

Taste was very good, but WHERES THE MEAT???"}
{"text":"Stay away from the wings. They look like they came from baby chickens. I've never seen such small wings (see pics)!! Plus they were swimming in grease. Pizza was okay. Not great,  not terrible. Restaurant staff was overwhelmed either too busy or understaffed or both. We tried it to get away from the chains but don't think we'll be back."}
{"text":"Stayed at the new Marriott on vaca to see my family. Ordered the Penne with meat sauce  my mom ordered Chicken Alfredo and there was so much food we could not eat it all. The food was amazing!!!! I highly recommend this place highly! Only problem we had they forgot the silverware! LOL They were busy a slight over-site. We had some in our room."}
{"text":"This was only the second time I ordered from this location. In the small kitchen were two large trays of hundred or so uncooked chicken wings on a table at room temperature. There was also a big tub of cheese on the same table. 

The pizza and wings were not good this time. The pizza ovens need to be cleaned. There was a lot of black ash on the top and bottom of my pizza, and one burnt olive on the bottom as well (my pizza was plain cheese as you can see). The pizza was beyond greasy. I know greasy is the standard for NY style, but this was to another level. 

The wings were mostly small and not crispy at all, plus there was no garnish. The last couple of times I had ordered non-chain pizza was from Empire so I will go back there next time. The pizza and wings are just better there, and I never have all of that ash on my pies."}
{"text":"Second time I tried this pizza. It came in about an hour this time and was hard as a rock and cold. The two stars is because I called to complain and they apologized and said I would get a credit. I'll keep u posted"}
{"text":"I really hate writing one and two star reviews, it's bad for the business and bad for me because I had to have a pretty bad experience to justify a really low star count. Unfortunately, this is one of those times.

The one thing we really want is a good pizza place that delivers in our area. We decided to give Danny's a try at around 6 PM on 11/15/2017. 

We ordered an 18\" Extreme pizza, a 10\" Margherita pizza and a 10\" cheese pizza.

First lets talk about what was good:
- The crust was delicious! 
- the sauce was good, not too sweet, just right.
- The ingredients were all fresh.

Now, had they simply taken proper care in turning those ingredients into an edible pizza, this would probably be a 4 or 5 star review. Unfortunately, our pizzas were apparently built by a toddler :( 

- The sauce was uneven, leaving some portions of the pizza soaked in sauce and others virtually dry. 

- The cheese was super greasy! By the time we got the pie it was completely soaked through the crust to the point where you could not pick up a slice. You had to eat it with with a knife and fork or wear it. Yes, I am making an exception for it being delivered and not fresh out of the oven. Even allowing for that, it was super greasy. 

- The rest of the ingredients were just scattered across the pizza like they had been thrown on from across the room. The ham slices were still stuck together into stacks 4-5 layers deep and unevenly strewn about the pie. The peppers were super thick on about 2/3 of the pie and missing from the other 1/3. Before you ask, no, this did not happen in transport, they were cooked into these places. 

- They failed to properly cut any of the pies. The slices were so uneven some of them were 2-3 inches across at the top and others were as much as 8 inches. To be clear, I'm not saying they didn't apply pressure evenly when they cut it. They clearly made no effort to cut the slices evenly. That being said, they also failed to cut into the crust in about 50% of the cuts, so the pie had some cuts but mostly just dents in the cheese. 

- The crust was somewhat under cooked. 

For reference, I lived in Brooklyn NY for years. I have had NYC style pizza in all 5 boroughs. I know NYC pizza. This was not that. 

I really regret not taking a picture of the Extreme. It was truly a mess. 

The pizza tasted pretty good in the areas where it was done right, so we are hoping this was a bad night and we will probably try it once more before we give up."}
{"text":"Disappointing. Took an hour and a half to get our food delivered. Pizza was cold. Crust was chewy. Pasta was mediocre. Won't be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"I went to Danny's in Tega Cay a couple of years ago and I was not impressed. The staff was rude and the pizza was just a swimming pool of grease. So I was a little worried when they replaced one of our favorite restaurants a couple of months back. But today I was convinced by four hungry kids to give them a try.  What a difference!  This place is so good!  I don't know what the disconnect was with the other location, perhaps a bad day or something to that effect, but what that location did wrong this location did right!  Our food came out hot and in a timely manner, and the staff was more than friendly.  And as tasting is believing, I think this place has the best wings I've eaten in a very, VERY long time!  We demolished the food, and even the picky one found something she could eat.  If they have this kind of service and this kind of food all the time, we'll have no problem putting this restaurant in our rotation.  Yum!"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints! Pizza is sways amazing and I think it beats any other in the area."}
