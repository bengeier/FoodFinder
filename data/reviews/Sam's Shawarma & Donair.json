{"text":"My advise: go somewhere else. I work nearby so I wanted to get lunch (take out).  Food is not tasty, expensive for take out lunch box. Even interior of the place tells you all."}
{"text":"I go there almost 2 to 3 times a week and almost every time i go there I order one chicken shawarma plate, not the best in the world but definitely the best in town, and they definitely have the beat customer service as well. There food is affordable and delicious too."}
{"text":"I would provide half of the one star but Yelp does not allow this on their app.   Here we go with my review;   The owner was rude and had no customer service skills.  Secondly, the food was absolutely atrocious!!!! Unfortunately it was takeout so I didn't notice how bad the food was until I got home. I ordered the felafel platter. He included in this meal, one rubbery potato the size of a looney (not kidding), wet lettuce, and stale white rice.  I asked him for extra tabbouleh for at a cost of a dollar more and when I got got home,  I noticed he only provided less than a table spoon of tabbouleh in my meal. Btw, the felafel was tough and tasteless.  Like really tough. I had to drink a lot of water to get it to go down. In the end I could not finish the three felafel and so I tossed them out.   It gets worse! That night and the next couple of days I had food poisoning. I was so sick after eating that horrendous food. I will never go back there to eat and I suggest that others stay away from this place too!   This was absolutely a kitchen nightmare"}
{"text":"I am a bit puzzled by most of the other reviews. Did you expect a 5 star restaurant? A quick look at the aging restaurant and low prices on the menu and you should have a pretty good idea what you are in for. My rating is comparing it other places that are similar. Now that being said I have had the pleasure of having most of the items served here in their actual place of origin. The donair was pretty good. Not the best but pretty solid. Not too dry, not too wet just a good overall donair with fairly authentic sauces unless you are looking for a Nova Scotia style donair where the sauce is almost a paste. The chicken shawarma was delightful. The blend of spices was perfect! The chicken was a little on the set side but it was in no way dried out.   This place was a pleasant surprise just before getting on the highway. Very authentic, no fluff, no weird trendy stuffed mushroom caps.   I live out on the east end and would definitely come back here next time I am out this way"}
{"text":"This place must be under new management!!! I used to go to this place a lot back in the day and they're food was always amazing but after two recent trips (the last one being today) they will never see me again. We ordered 2 chicken shawarmas, 1 beef shawarma, dozen falafels, tahini sauce on the side and french fries. The only edible thing received was the fries. The meat in the sharwarmas was hard and cold, the vegetable toppings were sour and stale ( the lettuce was actually brown and slimy, yuck). We purchased our food during the lunch rush but the food seemed like it had been sitting there since the day before. The tzatziki and tahini sauce was runny, bland and tasteless and to top it all off the staff were extremely rude. Believe me when I say that I felt like shedding a tear for what I know this places food used to be like. Now I'm on a newfound mission to find good shawarma nearby so I won't have to go downtown when we're craving for it."}
{"text":"This place is right when you get off the 401 at Kipling and I stopped here to buy some shawarma for dinner on my way to my friends place just down the street. This place is certainly NOT somewhere I'd ever go again if any other options existed but I didn't get sick so that's a plus.   The chicken shawarma sandwiches were small with very limited toppings options and they were skimpy with those they had. Overall it tasted very bland, their garlic sauce was watery and flavourless, everything seemed to have been sitting around for a while (I was there at 7pmish). We wanted to get garlic potatoes and they only had enough for one order, and they were the best part, and still only ok.   The restaurant definitely hasn't be updated or redecorated since it was probably a donut shop in the 60s or 70s and still has that dingy, cheap CoffeTime (ie not nice/good or classy) feel to it. Overall I probably could have made better at home. The service was fast and friendly though."}
{"text":"Love the chicken and beef plates!  It is a bit isolated but ive never had a problem.  I really dont have much more to add but Yelp keeps insisting that my message is too short so ive addded this sentence."}
{"text":"Shawarma is one of my favorite meals to have whether it be a wrap or a plate, not my first time having shawarma so I got two wraps and a drink. Prices were decent but the food on the other hand is lacking quality. The chicken was very dry and that's from them cutting it too early and just letting it sit there I don't know why there's any reason to do that .you cut it when there's a customer that's what every successful shop does. And I don't understand why they are so stingy with sauces and ingredients in general I mean if the chicken is dry at least give me a bunch of sauce. I think if the owner tried to stop over prepping the food and was just a little more generous on the sauce this place could be a 5 star."}
{"text":"The best falafel I have ever had. The food is definitely homemade, the rice was cooked to perfection, and the hummus was also amazing. If you're in the neighbourhood, you need to stop and eat here."}
{"text":"Homemade Falafel.  Fresh.  Delicious. Don't let the exterior fool you...this place makes great food at a great price.  You won't leave hungry or disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"Been living in rexdale my whole life and always passed this place but since it's been here since I was younger I thought why not try it out..the staff are friendly, the food was amazing ! I usually go to pita land but to feed me and my fiancé would be around 40-50$ but not here I ordered a chicken shawarma plate and my fiancé ordered a chicken shawarma wrap with 2 drinks it was 20$  I was so happy! If your ever craving shawarma and in the area stop by !"}
{"text":"I will never come here again. The customer service was okay and standoff ish at the same time. I got the 3 platter dinner with chicken shawarma, gyro and falafel. I found the gyro to be to mushy but flavorful.. the chicken had okay flavor but it was somewhat dry and Barely any pieces of chicken left! The falafel was okay, the rice was Dry and horrible and the salad was okay. They are Very CHEAP when it comes to the portions.. they seriously need to reconsider.. I don't know how long this place will stay open with how cheap they are.  The food isn't even good.. they need to step up, some way, somehow.. I don't recommend at all. Sorry."}
