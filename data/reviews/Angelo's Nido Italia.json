{"text":"We had the fried mozzarella and chicken Alfredo. Sooooo wonderful. Cesaer salad wasn't the best but loved the atmosphere."}
{"text":"I ate a penne dish with sauteed rapine, but I couldn't pronounce the name so I don't remember it. It was good and was a little spicy. I also had the calamari which was very good."}
{"text":"Don't know why there are so many good reviews for this restaurant! Definitely not worth the money! Get us seated near windy door and said there was no other choice of table, while several empty tables left inside. I think they just thought we were students and easy to be bullied.The room was so dim that we couldn't read the menu. Waited for one hour then finally came the food. The food was not amazing at all with incredibly high price. Finally they added the tip by themselves and the dim light prevented us seeing that and we added the tip once more! Won't recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I was in town for business and needed to find a local restaurant. My coworkers and I choose Little Italy on Mayfield. After several drinks and good laughs we were treated to an amazing dinner that was cooked to perfection. Met the owner who made us feel like family. Thank you for a lovely evening. Will visit again when in the area."}
{"text":"Been there three times and if you're willing to pay a few extra dollars for top notch Italian food then this place is very good. Generally you can walk right in and get a table yet this place cooks up some of the best traditional Italian dishes in LI. The veal is great, the proportions are excellent, and the weekday dinner deals are a nice promotional touch. If the outside of this restaurant looked more welcoming and eye-catching there is no doubt it would be considered a top choice in the area."}
{"text":"I would never come here again. We walked in around 6PM on a Friday night and asked for a table for two. The hostess asked if we had a reservation, we said no, and she said she would check if they had any availability. She came back and said it didn't look like they had anything, but then another person they could seat us outside if we wanted, which we did. The waitress was so nice that we didn't complain when we received fried calamari instead of sautéed for our appetizer. When my plate of food was delayed because the dish broke she offered a drink while we waited, so we ordered a carafe of wine. The food came and was fine- nothing spectacular, but not bad. We finished our dinner and were drinking our wine when the busboy asked whether we were done- we had basically a full carafe of wine left. We said no and continued to have wine, meanwhile paying our check. When giving us the check the waitress said take our time as there was no rush so we continued to sit outside, drink our wine and enjoy the night. Around 8PM the owner came out, asked if we were done, tried to take my glass and  asked if I was done. When I said no (my glass was still full) he said we have a reservation and \"you've been sitting there since 6.\" I was so taken aback I didn't say anything. By sitting there did he mean ordering and eating dinner and drinks? I guess the policy of the restaurant is order, eat quickly, pay and get out so they can get other people in. I understand we walked in and didn't have a reservation, but if you give us a table and say we can take our time then I will take my time finishing my drinks. The thing that get me was how incredibly RUDE they were. If they just asked for us to move to the bar or even asked us to finish up more quickly because they had other people coming in, I would totally understand, However, to just say \"you've been sitting there since 6\" and try to take our drinks is absolutely the worst service I've ever encountered. I will never come back here, Mia Bella has much better food and much better service."}
{"text":"Very good italian food. I will drive over 30 miles to have their chicken alfredo. Never had a bad meal here. Typical decor you would expect for the area with plenty of parking nearby. Well worth a try."}
{"text":"Everything from the food to the staff is fantastic. I've been here more than once and I have not one complaint. I hope the owner knows and appreciates how great his employees are. They step in to assist each other and guests without missing a beat. That adds to the ambiance and delicious food in a way that improves the entire dining experience.  Thank you for a wonderful evening!"}
{"text":"Good value. The salad is fresh and tasty. Sandwich is a good deal, I actually could only finish half of it. The service is quite slow, but could be just because we came in the same time with a large group. Overall, quite happy with it."}
{"text":"My first time there this past Saturday. The atmosphere was very nice, other than getting the feeling like you have to spar with the person checking reservations, which I had. The waitress was great, and the food was fabulous. Love this place and highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Got a strange racist vibe when first attempting to dine at this place by the (presumed) owner. Food was not very good either.  Would avoid this place and go to Mia Bella.

UPDATE:  Received a threatening and racist inbox message from \"Angelo C\" today in response to this review.  Classy."}
{"text":"First time taking the family to Little Italy and among all of the terrific restaurants my son picks this place. He could not have picked s better place to dine. The server was excellent and the other support staff made the whole service experience awesome. We had a hot anti pesto plate as a appetizer: calamari, mushrooms, rice balls, roasted peppers.  Feeds a family of four easy and it was good. We had ceased and house salads, I liked the ceased-a little heavy on the dressing but tasted great. Veal Parmesan with pasta was delicious and big enough my wife a I should have split it. Spaghetti and meatballs, sausage was very large and the girl took home leftovers. We all took home leftovers. The boy had fettuccine with calamari which was very tasty. Definitely would recommend. Family of 4 $100 plus tip. FYI"}
{"text":"We have eaten in Little Italy many, many times as I went to college near there.  However, we had never tried Angelo's Nido Italia.  At first, I was concerned, because the host was very rude to us since we didn't have a reservation and there was apparently a big event later that evening.  However, after that, the service was great.  The main dishes were fantastic!!!!!  My favorite was the beef medallions (which my husband ordered) and the chicken piccata was also one of the best I've had.  Just skip the complimentary salads - the dressings (House or Ceasar) are non-existant and the salads are just greens.  However, big portions totally justified the price.  I can't wait to eat our leftovers for dinner tonight!"}
{"text":"Dirty. The service was ok but too many flys flying around and food did not seem homemade or made w any kind of care or love."}
{"text":"Went to a wedding rehearsal dinner here.  They kept bringing out dish and dish and it was all very good.  I definitely did not leave hungry.  The place was pretty crowded and not to spacious, but that had to do with the size of the party."}
{"text":"Worst. Service. Ever.  We had a reservation and were seated about 5 minutes early.  A couple came in behind us and were seated as well.  The server told both of us she'd be right back, and five minutes later she went to the other table first and took their order, ignoring us (even though she knew we were seated first).  She then brings them their wine and we still haven't been greeted or offered drinks.  Another few minutes and a guy comes by and says he'll be back to get our order, which he does, about 10 minutes later.  About 5 more minutes  and the couple next to us gets their salad, but it's another 10 before my wife gets her wine.  We then proceed to sit there while the folks next door get their soup course and a another table gets served.  Still, nada for us.  Finally, another table who ordered after us got their salad served, so we dropped a $10 for the wine (which she barely touched) and left.  It was arguably the worst service we have ever had.  We wasted an hour of our lives (literally). I can't believe how badly we were treated.  We had reservations, were friendly, were not under dressed...I just don't get it."}
{"text":"Came in for dinner last week.  The place was nearly empty, but most of the other places we walked past at the time looked the same.  The service was good.  My husband and I both got the daily special - soup, salad, pasta, chicken marsala, and dessert for $16.  Since there were few other entrees on the menu that were $16 or less, and those only came with pasta and salad, it seemed like a deal that couldn't be passed up.  And it was a ton of food.  I took my entire entree home (which was the plan all along since I dont' really like chicken marsala) and left stuffed.  The food was good.  I enjoyed the cranberries in the salad and the garlic butter that came with the bread basket, and my husband really liked the chicken and pasta soup.  

I feel like I'm describing a 4 star experience, but I'm just not feeling that excitement to come back that I normally would for 4 star places.  I'd be perfectly content to never eat here again, but I can't really explain why.  Maybe it's because i know there are plenty of other places in Little Italy to experience that are all (probably) just as delicious.  I guess if you have a lot of competition the stakes are higher to impress your customers."}
{"text":"The best Italian food I've had in Cleveland! Our table ordered a bottle of wine and fried mozzarella, both great. Our portions of steak and chicken were massive and made for good leftovers. We loved that all of the entrees came with a salad and side of pasta or vegetable. Wear your fat pants you won't want to stop eating."}
{"text":"My husband and I are from Richmond VA visiting for the weekend. We had dinner tonight at Angelo's Nido Italia.  The atmosphere, wait staff and food exceeded our expectations. I had the Gnocci and my husband had the veal. I could tell the Gnocci was homemade. It just melted in my mouth. My husband said his veal was outstanding. Our waitress was so nice and made us feel like family. We would definitely recommend Angelo's and would definitely come back here next time in town."}
{"text":"This place stinks! The staff was so aloof. The host (perhaps manager) was so rude--never making any eye contact and throwing the menus on the table. The \"garden salad\"  consisted of field mix, craisins, and italian dressing. The food was okay at best and definitely overpriced. We were sat in the bar area with the great ambiance of watching fox news displays of ISIS, and a band blaring in the back room. Not my ideal way to spend a Friday night!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  And let me tell you...after having eaten my way up through Little Italy, this place has the best marinara sauce.  Period.  Lately I have been on a stuffed rigatoni kick here.  So killer good.  The server said the filet mignon is good so maybe next time I will break stride and order that.m"}
{"text":"Want excellent food and service? Don't miss this little gem tucked in Cle's Little Italy neighborhood. Spend a summer night on the patio, or enjoy authentic Italian food inside."}
{"text":"Are you kidding? There is NO other restaurant in Cleveland that has Italian food as good as Nidos. The atmosphere in Nidos is the second reason to come. I have been coming here for 20 years NEVER a bad experience. Price point is fine, Angelo is all the entertainment that place needs. If you are long time Cleveland residence you have about 100% chance of running into someone you know. Anyone who does not 4/5 star this place A) does not appreciate Italian food B) doesn't understand Italians in general. what a great place to take family or friends. Keep it up ang you work hard"}
{"text":"If there were 50 stars i would give it 51.
This place is the epitome of little Italy for us. From Angelo personally making sure you are having an authentic experience to the the food, AHHHHH the food. My god it's amazing: little Italy Cleveland is amazing and Nidos is the pinnacle of that. 
Don't plan to eat fast, you are cheating yourself. Come with the love of your life (like I do) and enjoy."}
{"text":"After roaming around Little Italy we settled on this place for dinner. It appeared busy but so did every other location as it was a beautiful night. After a 15 minute wait we were seated. We then waited about 20 minutes for a waitress to come to the table and that only occurred after complaining to the owner that we still hadn't received service. LuAnne (sp?) brought us a wine menu and we placed an appetizer order. She never came back to get our drink orders so again we had to speak with the owner. At this point we were so fed up that we ate our appetizers after 50 minutes of waiting and left and went to La Dolce Vita instead where we had a fabulous time. As far as food, the escargot was good but the risotto balls were just average.  Each time we spoke with the owner which ended up being four times he could have made the situation right but instead he just made excuses that they were too busy.  It came across to us that this business doesn't appreciate their customers.  My husband and I, along with another couple, agreed that this was the worst service we've ever experienced in our lives.  Also be aware they do not split checks."}
{"text":"Amazing dinner experience! The food was delicious. Real authentic Italian food. The veal Marsala was so tender it melted in my mouth. The Marsala sauce was incredible, best I've ever had. The fried calamari was cooked to perfection and served with a homemade marinara sauce. The dinner/house salad was a beautiful blend of fresh greens with fresh strawberries, dried cranberries and a homemade balsamic vinaigrette. The food at this place is so good you'll think you died and went to heaven! Great atmosphere, lovely decor. Service is slow but just part of the experience, so sit back and relax! Definitely one of the best restaurants in Cleveland's Little Italy. Reservations are needed on the weekends, impossible to get a table without. Valet parking is available drop off and  pick up at the front door."}
{"text":"Places rules, far and away. I love it. If place wasn't constrained by laws I would setting my self for each course of dinner and removing my pants. You read correct, your good friend James wants to relax with you for Italian dinner, share thoughtful banter, without pants. No pants and I may share quite an excellent dinner. Savory, tantalizing and delicious. You read correct this is my ness and I'm not wearing pants today."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. All the food was delicious and appropriately priced. I highly recommend the veal parm. The service was exceptional as they seemed to use a team based server approach. My water glass was never less than half full. The ambiance was very authentic Italian. I had generally been disappointed in my eating experiences in Little Italy until finding this place. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Try the weeknight specials: 4 courses for around $16. I had the Wed. Chicken Marsala special, caesar salad, soup, tiramisu. Olive oil & garlic butter on the table w/ warm bread. Other notable dishes: chicken cacciotore, sauteed shrimp w/ pasta, calamari pasta. Reasonably priced wine list. Real homestyle, family, neighborhood Italian restaurant in Little Italy. A gem!"}
{"text":"I have to say that I just love this place. We come here en masse every year with a visiting scholar (usually around 12 of us) and it is absolutely delightful. The ambience is lovely; the bar is beautiful; the dining area feels comfortably separate from the bar. We've always had excellent service and excellent food. And the desserts are fabulous! Don't miss out on the sorbet...

Once we were there while a large event was taking place in the adjoining room and I was happy to note that they had a different staff for the party so there was no trouble catching our server if need be. And the party looked to be well taken care of.

Overall, one of my favorite places in Little Italy."}
{"text":"This experience was wonderful. 

Although I've only been a couple times, the people are kind and therefore the service was amazing. I went to satisfy my cravings for pasta, steak and tiramisu. I started off with the house salad, which I enjoyed very much so with it's sweet fruity berries? and balsamic vinaigrette (YUM!). I had the filet mignon special one night and that was amazing, however I did not enjoy the blue cheese sauce (which I knew I would not like, but attempted to try nonetheless). **blue cheese is not something I enjoy, but if you do, you should get this! I also had the mussels, which did not taste all that fresh (the sauce was amazing though). Finally, I finished with their tiramisu, which was one of the best I've ever had in little Italy thus far.

Outside seating - felt nice with the wonderful spring night breeze. 

Inside seating - low lit setting, provides a sense of comfort and privacy. 

As a student, this place is quite pricey as expected, but great place for special occasions such as dinner dates, anniversaries and such. 

Thank you for such a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Very good not great. The place has fast and helpful service, with a smile. The owner was present and very helpful. The place could use a facelift but is still nice. The menu is old and the basic American Italian...fare is all over it. If they updated the look and made the menu more modern Italian it would be a four star place. All and all it was a good experience, just lacked innovative dishes. The pasta did taste good but not made in house, if the pasta at an Italian place is not made fresh daily, it's weak!"}
{"text":"I was here this week for an end of the dental school year dinner, and I was impressed! The ambiance is relaxed, and I kind of like the old school Italian decor.  We were seated in the back banquet area which was nice and spacious to accommodate our large party.  I tried so many of their delicious foods I don't even know where to start! I guess I'll just go in order of what was brought out family style to us hungry dentists to be...

First we had garlic white pizza and pizza with tomato sauce as appetizers... This was probably my least favorite course only because the pizza had a little too much sauce for my taste, but the crust was crunchy, just the way I like it! 

Then, the waters brought out both chicken broccoli Alfredo and cavatelli with red sauce.  I could have literally eaten the entire platter of the Alfredo pasta... So creamy and delicious! 

We then had chicken picata and fried eggplant, both were amazing.  The chicken had a lemon buttery sauce that was perfectly paired with the crunchy breading, and the eggplant melted in your mouth! 

I know this is not the \"typical\" meal at Nido, but I will definitely be back if this is any indication of the type of food served here... Yum!"}
{"text":"This is the one place in Little Italy that you want to eat at! Owned and operated by Angelo Sidari, Nido Italia is a neighborhood landmark that has been serving great Italian cusine for decades. The portions are generous, the homemade garlic butter is decadent, and the service is attentive and top notch. The front part had a full bar and seating area, while the back room has an even larger seating section. The layout is elegant and sets a nice mood that enhances any occasion. If you want a truly terrific experience and an superb meal, stop in to Nido Italia!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service. The place is newly renovated and looks gorgeous. Congrats to Angelo!"}
{"text":"Best Italian, period."}
{"text":"Overpriced for just ok Italian food. Veal Parm was pounded very very thin. It was tough and dry."}
{"text":"Didn't even have a chance to eat here because after several attempts to make a reservation we never received a call back. When we finally were able to speak to someone they ignored the messages left and we were told there is no room for us and couldn't fit us in at all. By the way all of this was presented in a rude unprofessional manner.  I don't know how the food is and never will after this first impression!!!"}
{"text":"Hands down, the best Italian food!  I'm from CA and anytime I visit OH - Angelo's is an absolute must! Best gnocchi, best calamari, best fettuccine, best...everything!"}
{"text":"Great food and a very friendly atmosphere. I had the best chicken piccata I've ever had here, I don't know why but the breading really stood out. Wait staff was very helpful and it was extremely clean. The salmon salad gave a very generous portion of salmon which more then proved it as a valid dinner plate option. I'll be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food. Everything was cooked to perfection. My boyfriend made reservations for Valentine's Day. We were running 10 minutes late because of parking difficulties, and had to wait another ten minutes to be seated. I was a bit perturbed but, this honestly speaks to the popularity of this restaurant. Every aspect of the meal was delicious. The bread at the table, our side salads, and our main course. My jumbo shrimp pasta in an Alfredo sauce was rich, creamy, and heavenly; his veal was tender, and his cavatelli in a meat sauce was surprisingly delicious. We had tickets to see the Cleveland orchestra at 8, so unfortunately did not have time for dessert. We probably should have made it clear to our waitress that we needed the bill asap, because we ended up waiting more than 20 minutes for it. This caused us to be late to the orchestra. This is an establishment where you can enjoy your food, and not feel any rush. But, I would not plan on going to any events afterwards. The restaurant often hosts performers and musicians, so dining here is an event in itself. I'd highly recommend for friends, family, or date night."}
{"text":"My family and I were there on a Sunday for my parents anniversary. Normally the food is excellent, this time not so much. We've only gone with two or four of us before this time we had 10. The portions seems smaller and didn't taste as good as usual. The wait staff did a good job but the food was not up to par. I'll be back but only with another couple at the most"}
{"text":"Food is average American-Italian fare. Didn't like they served all our meals with cavatelli (likely because cavatelli was on special that evening) Spaghetti or linguini is certainly more appropriate with Veal Parm and Chicken Picatta. Waitress was pleasant despite language barrier (other waitress thankfully stepped in to help). Decor was festive with Christmas decorations up. Three pet peeves... asking for our reservations with restaurant less than half full, laminated \"special\" menus with no prices, and the signs on the table asking patrons to tip in cash. Tacky."}
{"text":"Very good food and reasonable prices. If your looking for a good meal in little Italy and dont want to drop a lot of cash this is a great place. Most dishes are $15-$20 and the food is delicious."}
{"text":"Yesterday was my third visit to Angelo's and, as usual, it was awesome. The food is moderately priced, so tasty, and served in big portions. Their lunch specials are a steal ($15 for soup, salad, main entree, side of pasta, and dessert!). We've had the same server every time, and he's always so accommodating. My family loves it just as much!"}
{"text":"Ok, so my grandmother knew Angelo's grandmother, Angelo knows my Father and Aunt.  My wife and I had our wedding reception here.  That's my full disclosure.

That said, the food here is solid, southern Italian goodness.  I brought work friends for lunch here and all were impressed by the low prices and high quality food.  Many had never had Wedding Soup before and they loved it.  So yeah the decor is rather Italian American inspired, but it works well here so enjoy it for what it is.  If you are looking for trendy Italian food, then go elsewhere, but if you like old fashioned Italian American dishes, then you will be very pleased.  

Aside from his great lunch specials, he has some nice dinner specials--especially around holidays like Valentines day."}
{"text":"Great local spot with excellent food and a reasonably priced. Service was great and the owner came to our table and introduced himself and asked was our food prepared excellent. Will definitely make a return visit!"}
{"text":"I went for lunch because I was working from home one day and it's sort of nearby. I had the pasta carbonara and it contains a LOT of egg (more than I was accustomed to) and the main ingredient in the sauce seems to be butter so it was very, very rich. I took more than half of it home and ate it over the course of a few days because it was just too rich. Don't confuse that with \"delicious\" though (I was a little bummed, especially for their prices).

PS I didn't see any lunch specials so those may have been discontinued. I'd try going there again if they had specials to sweeten the deal."}
{"text":"They brought out the oldest toughest bread ever. I seriously wouldn't feed it to ducks.  We ate it only because we were starving and then Waited 30 min for appetizers. Stuffed peppers that have zero cheese and cost $14. I can make them so much better at home. Also got the risotto balls appetizer which was good but you only get 3 for I think $14. And do not expect the marinara to be even remotely warm, it's cold. Ugh. My husband and I split the brocollini with peas and chicken.  It came with a house salad that consisted of wilted spinach with raisins and warm lemon dressing. It sucked. Ate a very small bite and left it. The entree was good but very easily made at home. Not what I would call authentic Italian cuisine.  On top of it we sat outside on the patio where everyone goes to smoke, fabulous.  Absolutely won't be going back. Corbos for dessert was really good tho, highly recommend that!"}
{"text":"Yum all the way. 
Great service and a very friendly staff.We went here for a wedding rehersal dinner and were impressed by the service and and the quality of the food.  We were served family style and I must say that the they have great food.   This place has beautiful decor that reminds you of claassic italy and a beautiful patio space that would be great for parties and wedding receptions.

I will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Hosted family gathering here for 13 people, the service was stellar and the food was plentiful and cooked perfectly. The dinner was served family style and was wonderful. The service (especially Pam) were extremely friendly, proactive and very attentive. When they saw us taking photos they asked if they could take them for us so we could all be in the picture. They really made our occasion extra special. Everything was delicious; rice balls, stuffed sausage and peppers, calimari, veal Parm, veggies, chicken Marsala and pasta. There was SO much food and our guests were SO pleased. The servers cut our cake up for us and boxed the food to go, they went above and beyond really. We had such a first rate experience, we'll definitely return.  I will note there is no changing table in the bathroom, somehow I changed the baby on the counter in the bathroom, it worked, but a changing table would have been easier."}
{"text":"I loved Nido Italia.  First of all, the portions are immense.  Particularly the Clams Casino.  I have never seen an appetizer that huge.   Our party of 4 was able to split it.  The pasta is so fresh and delicious, and the veal parmigiana and veal toscano were incredible.  Our waitress was very friendly.  My only complaint is not even really a complaint.  They clearly treat the regulars much better.  They were seated first and served first regardless of order of arrival.  But I can't complain about that too much because there are places where I am a regular and I certainly enjoy the special treatment.  :)"}
{"text":"Wonderful food and service in a restaurant that is willing to prepare dishes in a manner preferred by the customer, instead of the way the chef insists.  The portions are huge and the entrees include a choice of a house or Caesar salad and pasta.  The salads were much larger than expected so I took much of my entree home.  The veal piccata(formerly chicken piccata) was outstanding.  I was able to substitute gnocchi for another basic pasta and it was the best I have ever had.

I will be returning often and recommending this place to my friends."}
{"text":"What can I say.  Wonderful fun great food great service. I have read some reviews before we came. This place is pure italian greatness.  The food was really good. Big portions moderate prices and a fun band to listen to.  Will be back many times."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch with my wife on a Wed afternoon. Atmosphere was nice.  We ordered the hot sampler platter for an appetizer.  The rice balls and eggplant were very good, the calamari was good but slightly chewy, and the roasted peepers were good but spicy hot.  I ordered the veal Parmesan and it was awesome and a huge portion!  My wife ordered the Mediterranean pasta and it was good but not great.  We would definitely come back.  

Came back a 2nd time and got the sampler platter again, jumbo shrimp in creamy basil sauce and chicken Romano.  All were amazing!  Portions were also a nice size."}
{"text":"Good old rich and tasty Italian food. Always good, always warming and familiar. The specials are perfect value meals, with huge amounts of food for a very cheap price. Service is wonderful and they make you feel cozy. Tuesday special is my favorite."}
{"text":"Loved the location near Severance Hall, valet parking, and willlingness to commit to a last minute reservation.  Dining experience was just three stars.  OK, good value, and some concerns.  Front room is cold due to open/closing of front door, if possible, get table in the back room.  Music was loud although the staff turned it down each time we ask (but why did we have to keep asking?)  Loved the fried rice balls (risotto) in nice marinara sauce.  Lots of bread, butter and olive oil.  Server was distracted so there were some oversights in service.  Bus boys a combination of helpfulness and over zealous.  Ambience was superficial, effective use of lighting and facade to cover a plain interior, banquet style furniture.  Good value overall, especially the red sauces."}
{"text":"My husband & I were there for dinner with two other couples on 12-5-15.  The restaurant was beautiful & the life size Santa at the doorway made me smile!  None of us had been there before and another friends son suggested it.   We all absolutely loved our appetizers, meals & vino...every single one of us!   Our server, Tina, was fantastic and fun.   On the way home we had all decided we would be back soon!"}
{"text":"I love this place, traditional Italian food and neighborhood regulars add color.  My new favorite place to go when in back in town.  Get the veal; you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"What an amazing meal!! It was a Mothers Day package to die for. Started with fried eggplant to calamari to cheese ravioli and the beef tenderloin and scampi's and finished with tiramisu!! Outstanding!!! And the music was provided by nick costa & Bill Pirie. If you are getting married and need a band - call them. Best meal in a long time!!"}
{"text":"Upscale yet relaxed.  Lovely atmosphere.  Per the reviews, I so wanted the clams casino but I am the only one in my family that will partake in clams.  At my request, they were willing to prepare a half order of the appetizer.  It did not disappoint.  The flavor and crust were to die for.  It was my highlight.  We had a bottle of Essence Riesling.  Quite excellent.  My husband ordered Romano chicken, he thought it was really good.  I had the sautéed jumbo shrimp pasta made with angel hair.  Fantastic creamy taste.  Would get it again.  My daughter who is sometimes a picky eater had the alfredo over angel hair.  She says she gives it a thumbs up and as we speak she is spooning the rest of the sauce into her mouth.  Our waitress Lou Ann (sp?). Did a fantastic job, great with the kids.  If there was one thing I did not like so much, it would be the Caesar salad.  Loved the dressing but the lettuce is almost swimming in it.  Other than that, perfect night!


Update:  Has been a year since we were first there.  Did not realize it last year, there is a parking lot across the street where you can easily park for $5.   Again had the clams casino, still great. Husband had the sausages and peppers as an appetizer, also terrific.  This time I had the Caesar salad with the dressing on the side and it was delicious.  Daughter went for the chicken Alfredo over angle hair and hubby went with the chicken Romano again.  I had the stuffed rigatoni which was fantastic.  Son is a creature of habit, wants nothing fancy.  He had buttered angel hair and a plain meatball, they were actually willing to rinse the sauce off of the meatballs for him.  Meal was nicely presented and just so good.  Kids shared something with chocolate in a cup, can't even begin to spell it.  I'm surprised they both made it out alive and with all their fingers, they devoured it.  Restaurant is beautiful, as a matter of fact our daughter has decided to have her wedding reception here...she's nine.  The owner actually waited on us, super nice and she even shared he daughters wedding pics with our daughter who was in awe.  Yet another great meal at Nido's.

My only criticism is that I would really like to see the appetizers be half size/half cost.  The appetizers are more like family size.  Last year they made me a half portion of the clams casino or I probably would never have tried them. They are really the size and cost of a meal.  When a table size may only be 1-3 people another what is essentially a whole extra meal is too much especially if you have not tried it before and not even sure if u will like it.  I bet more people would try your delectable appetizers if u made them smaller."}
{"text":"Okay.  So the one and only time I've been to this restaurant was over two years ago, back when I didn't write reviews, and I have no recollection of how the food tastes like.

However, this restaurant is firmly ingrained within my memory as the place where they gave impeccable service... to the patrons sitting at table next to us. While completely ignoring us.

I don't know why, I mean, I understand that I'm Asian, not Italian, and I'm not a regular, and my great grandma isn't buddy buddy with the executive chef, and maybe they thought that my girlfriend and I were just poor undergraduates who were skipping class or something, but seriously!  They kept attending to the other table, and chit-chatting with them, and making sure their waters were filled to the tops of their glasses, while for us we had to wave down the waitstaff for them to take notice of us, let alone take our order.  (And, yes, they ended up serving the other table first even though they had twice as many people and walked into the restaurant 20 minutes later.)

I don't usually take too much notice of bad service but this was just downright rude.  There other fine restaurants along Mayfield that serve excellent food - I urge you to check out one of those places instead."}
{"text":"Came here for a late lunch and the service/food could not have possibly been better. Started with the calamari and ordered the chicken parm. Both were amazing. Throughout the meal our server was attentive and friendly. Highly recommend stopping by for a meal."}
{"text":"Love the old school Italian feel of the area and I cannot wait to explore more of Little Italy. The food here was very very tasty!! The stuffed peppers were a perfect appetizer: spicy and lots of flavor. I had the pasta carbonara (which I added chicken to). It was delicious. My wife got the Caesar salad (which she added shrimp). The shrimp were humongous too! Overall very good, but the service was a little on the slow side. I'll be back to Little Italy for sure, but may not head right back to Nido's just yet..."}
{"text":"Our favorite place I Little Italy. Had the meatballs and sausage and my wife had the chicken broccoli fettuccine. Very tasty. Sausage could use some marinara or other sauce but that's a personal taste. My wife said its her favorite Italian place. Staff were great."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place but the service is just awful.  I got there at 8pm with a group of 12 for a birthday party.  Wasn't really busy and we had reservations so seating wasn't an issue.  We ordered appetizers and drinks, drinks were fine but appetizers took over 45 minutes and our waiter disappeared.  We literally didn't see him until after 9pm and that was after we asked 5 people to send him over.  Someone in our party actually went up to the bar to complain because we hadn't even put in our dinner orders.  After that there were about 3 people taking care of us which is fine, we put in our dinner orders and the rest of the meal went smoothly.  I just can't understand why you would ignore a table of 12 thats ordering multiple appetizers, bottles of wine, and drinks on top of entrees aka a huge bill and big tip.  The food was great, but I likely won't be back due to the service.  Theres plenty of other similar restaurants in little italy with food just as good."}
{"text":"Overpriced is an understatement; my meal cost about $40 for the salad, pasta, and meat! There's a reason why they don't have prices on their website! I realize the photos of the menu taken are a bit hard to read, but the menu is very extensive.

I asked for meatballs and gnocchi and thought they'd come together but arrived in separate dishes. The gnocchi sauce was so thick it wouldn't stick to the bread when dipping. Meatballs were tasty but that's about it. The meatballs were in a marinara sauce, and the gnocchi were in a different sauce, so unless I had a mixing bowl, there was no way to combine the pasta and meat. What a shame!

The Caesar salad was weird. The croutons were burnt, and the salad had a strange after taste. Service wasn't that great either. I was the only person at the bar, and the bartender left for a good 20 minutes. In general, there were no people. There was a family of four and a couple who entered the restaurant as I was leaving around 6PM on a weeknight, and that's it!"}
{"text":"Overrated... The bread was okay. The marinara slightly under-seasoned. The salmon was over cooked and the chicken was very dry. The only thing that was good in my experience was the polite staff and fast service. I would like to have tried the fried ravioli."}
{"text":"Dinner with three friends last nite and all meals
we're outstanding. Bravo Angelo, you continue to serve the best food on the Hill."}
{"text":"This was exactly what I was looking for when visiting  Little Italy.  Authentic Italian cuisine and at a decent price point.  Friendly owner and attentive staff to greet you upon entry and ensure you have a good experience.  When are looking for a Little Italy experience, this place is on point."}
{"text":"We just went to Angelo.What fabulous  experience. It was like eating in Italy. There was no rush in between courses. The food was fabulous. Myself, I had chicken piccata, best I ever had, even when I made it. The caprese salad was so fresh tasting. My husband's granddaughter loved it and never tasted it before. I definitely will be coming back. Atmosphere was wonderful. Great music from all the great stars, Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra,Nat King Cole and  Johnny Mathis. Really way before my time. Our waitress was wonderful her name is Tammy. Don't change what you're doing now!!!! Will recommend to many of my friends."}
{"text":"Wow! Angelo's is the best Italian we've ever eaten!  The atmosphere was romantic with candlelight and Italian music. We met Angelo and he was friendly, funny, and laid back. We ordered the bruschetta with olives,
chicken Parmesan, and chicken Romano. All of the dishes seemed homemade and authentic."}
{"text":"The waitress is very uncaring and not personal. The live music you'll appreciate if you're over 40. And the restaurant has a weird smell when you walk in. I'll update this after I eat."}
{"text":"Exceptional food, service, price,ambiance!  Must try it when in Little Italy.   You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Really wonderful.  Veal parm that was amazing and the portion was huge. Tender veal, a delicious layer of cheese, and scrumptious red sauce.  Too bad I'm from Houston, I'd be at Angelo's all the time!"}
{"text":"Very good! I got the veal tuscano with a side of cavatelli. Good portion sizes. Would come here again. Very classy dining atmosphere."}
{"text":"Love Love Love this place, hands down one of the best family style Italian restaurants! From the moment you arrive you receive a wonderful greeting from Angelo himself to his waitstaff they are attentive, friendly and on top of their game, this place does it right! The food is absolutely delicious, consistent and the atmosphere is always a fun family type of buzz! The music in the background brings back memories of a visit to Italy and coincidentally it's located in Little Italy!! 
It's a request of our adult children when they come back home, somewhat like a tradition! 
Thanks"}
{"text":"Good food, nice house wine, good service. Perfect place for a date. The only strange thing - bathrooms are not up to style with restaurant decor. Can use some improvement."}
{"text":"We tried some pastas here -- the texture of the pasta was good, but the flavours less so.  Carbonara was odd-tasting, with very hard chunks of meat -- disappointing.  Cavatelli with meat sauce & meaballs & sausage was so-so, not very flavourful.  The meatballs did not taste good.  The meat and sausage seemed overcooked & were hard to eat.  Accompanying salad was fine."}
{"text":"We walked up and down mayfield in little Italy reading reviews before just following our noses and walking in to the only place with activity.  So glad we did, the escargot was amazeballs! We ate all the bread cleaning the bowl, salads were perfect and wine was perfect but couldn't finish dinner, ok we barely started it. Really great to stumble in for a great meal."}
{"text":"It's so disappointing to go to an Italian restaurant in Little Italy, and be served such mediocre food.  Their menu isn't exactly cheap either, so you expect quality when you order.

I got the pork chops -- I typically love pork chops.  And this meal cost over $30.  But it was completely burnt on the outside, and so very dry and lacking in flavor on the inside.  It basically just smelled and tasted like burnt meat.  It did come with deicious brocoolini.  But that's unfortunate when your vegetable side is the highlight of the gian protein entree.

The bf got grouper.  It was ok.  It was covered in a lemon caper sauce, and granted, I'm biased against lemon caper sauce in general.  So take it with a grain of salt, someone who loves that stuff might like this dish better than I did.  But the fish had no flavor at all.  It was just a medium to soak and taste more of the sauce.  Season your protein and make it a part of the dish, not just a flavorless thing sitting in a pool of sauce.

They also served us a basket of cold bread.  The dining room was so over air-conditioned that I was shivering to death the whole meal.  I just didn't find any part of this meal enjoyable at all.  Will not be back... definitely not at these prices, but probably not even if the menu was at half their current price.

There are other great options within a block or two.  They have to be better given their near-by competition for great Italian food.

Explanation of my rating system -
5*: Epitome of something, the best I've had, would LOVE to go back
4*: Great food and happy to go back regularly, but not the best of the category
3*: Food is fine.  I may spontaneously decide to go there based on convenience.  But no need to go back either.
2*: If you insist, I guess I'll come along. I'll find something to eat. But I wouldn't have picked it.
1*: No plans to come back.  I'll try to talk companions out of going."}
