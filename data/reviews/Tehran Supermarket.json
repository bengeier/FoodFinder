{"text":"Very friendly staff. Owners on the premises and welcoming to all. New renovated layout is bright, clean, and eye-appealing... The food is AWESOME... Really delicious and cooked over coals... The price of their meals is the best of all the kebab places on yonge st fighting for spotlight... Very busy but they take good care of their customers and are a wonderful place to come if you're craving some yummie Persian food... Grilled chicken, barg, rice w/ saffron and dried pomegranate, fresh nuts everywhere, tah-chin with crunchy crust.... Grilled tomatoes. Yummieeeee"}
{"text":"Tehran has been closed for renovation for some time. There's no telephone message for customers advising when they will be re opening...strange???"}
{"text":"This is a great place to try a quick Persian dish!  I ordered a order of Vazeri (chicken and beef kebob) with rice.  Good portion size.  Price is reasonable and have good service.  I would try them again."}
{"text":"*IF YOU ARE ORIENTAL DO NOT EXPECT THEM TO SERVE YOU* 
I went to the food counter to order something and the girl working there looked at me with hatred and completely ignored me because of my race. She then motioned for the person behind me to come up so that she could serve them instead. Absolutely disgusting how racist she was."}
{"text":"Finally a contender for Super Khorak. Tehran Supermarket is a Persian supermarket with a food vendor inside. I'm reviewing the food vendor. 

I love Persian food! There's something about their rice that's so delicious. Grilling meat on a stick has to be one of the best inventions ever. Near Yonge/Steeles, there's are a million Persian restaurants. I haven't noticed any significant differences in quality between them. 

At Tehran Supermarket, the meat is cooked just right. The seasoning is typical but irresistable. The rice is fluffy and not swimming in oil. Perhaps most importantly to me, the value is there. I eat a lot of kebob + rice dishes. While quality is generally standard, there's a large variation in prices across Toronto. I've seen the 2x ground beef kebobs + rice go for $10 in some places. Here, it's $5.99!!! Since I find most kebob places similar in quality, price is single most important factor. Most items here are cheaper than other places. 

Oh and yes, your kebob + rice dish comes with a free pop!"}
{"text":"Amazing! They use a charcoal grill to cook their food inside. I always get the koobideh kabob. You get a free pop drink and price is great. Far better than big chain stores...a little hidden gem. It is also a supermarket. The wait can be a bit long if you are ordering so i do suggest calling at least 20 minutes in advance."}
{"text":"Super fresh and succulent pieces of meat with aromatic plain Basmati rice. Must try. Found it better than big name restaurants. A good place for non greasy fresh and hot lunch. This place have some wraps and sandwiches too but keeping it for the next visit. The food doesn't come with traditional salad and bread with rice but they have options and you will have to ask before you order."}
{"text":"Great food, great potion size. 
One of the previous reviews says a kobideh plate is \"$6.99\" but is wrong, I paid $11.29 - but for the amount of food I got (+a can of pop) I can't complain."}
