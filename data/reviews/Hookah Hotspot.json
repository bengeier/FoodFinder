{"text":"So dope. This place is really good after a night on the town. Blue mist is hella. 
The lights are cool. The hookah is the spear. It's really long and hard."}
{"text":"Love this place! My boyfriend and I come at least 2x a week. The ambiance is amazing, perfect place to relax, and there is a great balance of music. Service is great and management is very knowledgeable. They even have their own shisha flavors exclusive to the establishment."}
{"text":"By far the BEST hookah I have ever had! New management!! Staff and owners are very friendly and attentive. The atmosphere is amazing, great music and drinks. This is a place where you can go unwind and have a great time with great people and listen to really good music. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"My new go to hookah spot. My girlfriend and I were treated to great friendly service on a Saturday Night. I loved that the cliched and everything were clean! The hookahs appear to be new and they even light up to add to the ambiance. We decided on the spiced chai flavor and it was delicious. The hookah hit smooth and flavorfully as well. The coals were also swapped in a timely manner. The owner informed us that they offer half off during happy hour Monday-Thursday from 4-7. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome place to come relax, listen to music and great hookah. Service was great, lots of variety and great pricing. Would be cool if you had the option to add fruit to your hookah mix. Will be back!"}
{"text":"In Charlotte for work and decided to stop by, I was not disappointed! I was impressed to see that they use coconut coals! I've had hookah in multiple states, Europe and a couple of spots in the Middle East and I would without hesitation recommend (and be back)! I've seen mention of the neighborhood being sketchy, ehh it's definitely a bit remote but I wasn't the least bit deterred."}
{"text":"Hookah Hot Spot is a hidden treasure!!!! Love it!!! I have been hooked ever since I found them on Facebook. Eden and the staff are very nice and the atmosphere is very relaxing. The cinnamon tea is amazing and I recommend Blue Mist Hookah."}
{"text":"Call first. Make sure they're open. Google and Yelp list that they're open at 5. But really it's 6. And even then, we went there at 6:20, and nobody was there. Save yourself a trip and call. We ended up going to Al-Basha and they were awesome."}
{"text":"Stopped by here after a lil night on the town. Place was pretty empty (it was about 1am so that could be why). Regardless, the customer service was good and the hookah was great. Neighborhood gets quiet around that time, just fyi. It's not a fancy hookah bar, but it's pretty legit. Also, prices were really reasonable. It was about $14 for a mix of 3 flavors \"sex babe\""}
{"text":"This was my first hookah bar and it was really enjoyable. Staff was great and very attentive. Although area can be a little sketchy at night, everyone in there was super chill. Had a combo of strawberry mint and it was good. Thanks for the other Yelp reviewers that led me here ..."}
{"text":"This is not my first Hookah Bar so there were certain things I could compare. The location is not in the best neighborhood but I felt safe and comfortable. The ambience was relaxing and the staff was very polite and inviting. Not only is it the cheapest Hookah Bar i've been to but they even had other ways to save money. Though they serve no alcohol they are very accommodating. Not only will I go back but I will take others."}
{"text":"By far the best hookah spot in Charlotte and service is astounding!!!   Good tea.  Chill spot. Must do spot in the area.  They offer several flavors.  Highly recommend this place. Every time I'm in town I make it a point to come and relax."}
{"text":"Stumbled across this gem while visiting family. The homemade hookah flavors are really good - we tried wet dream and mint. Only downside is no full bar. Beer and wine are available though. Good music too."}
{"text":"This is prob the best Hookah Lounge in the Queen City I've been to since it's been under new management! They have the best premium hookah flavor that no one in Charlotte has. Y'all should definitely try the Headrush and Fruity Pebbles which are probably my two favorites! I had a great time with my girls last weekend. It's a great place to go out to in Charlotte with great hookah smoke and great music! This is definitely the place to be every Friday and Saturday nights!"}
