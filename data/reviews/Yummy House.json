{"text":"After having a craving for fried rice I checked out Restaurant.com to see if we could find any great discounts to go out to eat. Yummy House has several gift certificates you can purchase. We got a $10 off certificate for an order over $20.   We order 2 dinner specials. Mongolian Beef ($10.95) and Schezwan Shrimp ($12.95). To start off we had the Egg Drop Soup which was the best I've had in a long time. There was nothing added to it, no corn or other vegetables, no tofu just a nice thick egg soup. We received an appetizer of crab Rangoon and a jumbo shrimp that was very delicious as well. My order came out wrong and I was brought chicken instead of shrimp but it looked delicious and we didn't bother them to fix it. Our waiter offered several times even to bring out a side order of shrimp to go with it. But we were fine and they adjusted the price on our check. Our fried rice was the best part of the meal. It had ham, chicken and shrimp in it. MMMM Delicious!!   Everything was a little bit oily but was very tasty. Our waiter, Tommy was very, very friendly. He explained that everything is made fresh, the sauces are not from packages. As it turns out the red bell pepper in our Mongolian Beef still had the UPC sticker on it. Now the Mongolian Beef wasn't our favorite. It was not like any kind I've had before. We barely touched it and didn't take it to go.   We ordered a Boba Tea in the Mango flavor and I loved it but my honey thought it was too sweet. The waiter said that he adds sugar to it so you could always ask for less if it's too sweet. Our drink there cost us $2.95 and if you buy one in China Town for the same size it's nearly $6. It's nice to stop here just for this alone.   The restaurant is very hot. Particularly the seating off to the right side when you walk in. We moved to the first booth closest to the door directly under the fan and were very comfortable.   I would definitely liked to stop by again in the future for the soup, fried rice and boba tea. And I'd love to see how the orange chicken is.   Oh and they deliver for $2."}
{"text":"I really love the Yummy House. It's such a cute little joint owned by what looks like a mom and pop. I always go back for that poutine (even though they don't use curds there's something about the texture of their fries and gravy combined with melted cheese I love better than any poutine I have had in my life). They have asian food which I haven't tried yet but that will definitely be the next thing I try on my next visit!  Oh also can I say BUBBLE TEA YUM :D!!!"}
{"text":"This small family runned establishment that is  across the street from Riverdale High School.   The menu consist of affordable grubs and snacks - perfect for the students crowd at lunch time and after school.   I was working nearby, and saw the crowd at lunch time.  I returned after the lunch rush and ordered the popcorn chicken and an avocado smoothie.   Their Popcorn Chicken are perfectly spiced and satisfy the salt craving that begs to be pairing with one of the bubble tea or smoothie.    Everything was made to order - probably because I didn't go during the lunch crowd.     I really enjoyed this gem and will be back the next time I am in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Unlike a certain review below, I'm predicating my review on what this establishment is (a place for young people to get affordable food and drinks) rather than compare it to restaurants that serve a more affluent clientele.  This place has friendly service, great value for their bubble tea and smoothies. Basic fast food is very reasonably-priced too. If you're a bubble tea/smoothie fan and don't like paying north of $4 for it, this is a great place to go. Too bad the hours aren't better when school isn't in session..."}
{"text":"I have ordered from here a few times. The first time was fine, the food was okay. But the second time, they were 40 mins late with my order, and the food was cold by the time it got to my house. I gave them the benefit of the doubt, and figured it happens to the best of us. However, this last time I finally had enough. I placed my order on HungryHouse and got the confirmation text that they accepted the order. 30 mins after the expected delivery time I try calling, no answer. I call again 5 mins later... no answer. After a series of calls, and an hour after the estimated delivery time someone picks up, just to tell me \"oh sorry we cancelled your order because we are too busy.\" So I waited more than an hour for them to tell me, after I FOLOWED UP mind you, that they were never delivering any food in the first place. Thanks Dummy House."}
{"text":"My favourite item to get at yummy house is their incredible (not to mention extremely affordable) bubbletea. They have 3 sizes for their bubble and it starts at $2.5 including tapioca and taxes - and it's not a tiny cup it's the regular size cup every bubbletea store starts at. Furthermore, they have several different flavours including rare ones like egg pudding. And you can even mix your flavours at no additional cost, my favourite is mango and strawberry mixed. Some bubbletea stores aren't flexible about flavour and tea flavour mixes (e.g. taro only comes in green tea or something) but yummy house lets you mix whatever your heart desires.  If bubbletea isn't your thing and you prefer other drinks, they have incredible smoothies starting at just $3! my boyfriend just loves their strawberry smoothies..creamy and refreshing.  My highschool is right across from it, so i use to eat from them a lot. They serve fries supreme, fries with cheese and other goodies. It was very affordable for students and it was delicious.   The only thing negative i can think of for yummy house is that it doesn't open late. Usually hours range from 10am-6ish only. Reason being that it targets students across the street. As well, yummy house is small, there aren't much seating room. It's usually a take out kind of shop rather than sit in.  Its location isn't bad, it's beside a starbucks, particularly across from a pizza pizza. As well very close to it within that block is a delicious chinese restaurant. If you walk further down there's a mcdonald and small indoor mall (Gerrard Square)."}
{"text":"Its good not the best but still good none the less. Lunch Specials are good and cheap. Go for lunch skip dinner."}
{"text":"One star for quantity (portion). Really thats about it.  Im always up for trying new asian food around my neck of the woods. Well, I thought I struck gold when I saw an all in one asian restaurant. Very rarely do I find thai food with chinese (normally its either one or the other).  Well I was craving pad thai. well it ended up looking like asian spaghetti. Which didnt have the EGG or the rest of the ingredients I was looking for and it sure as hell didnt taste like pad thai..   Lets just say that I'd rather travel a distance to get thai food rather than going here."}
{"text":"I have a restaurant.com coupon for $25 on this \"cockroach\" Yummy House. DARNET!! they closed. What a waste of printing and ink. I haven't even tried the food yet!"}
{"text":"It looks like a young mom and pop running the house and dam they work like the speed of lightning! I love the poutine i don't care what anyone says it is the best poutine in Toronto I've had many poutine even though they don't use cheese curds the texture of the fries and the gravy and the cheese together make it remarkable the flavour is amazing. Glad to have this establishment in the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"Did not like the food.  Typical poor salty Americanized Chinese food.  Go to Chinatown."}
{"text":"Im definitely a fan of the Yummy House!  Anytime im in the mood for my Chinese fix, I head here.  It's a little hidden and we stumbled on this place by accident but I'm glad we did.  The reason I keep coming back is for the food.  I usually always get the Veggie Lo Mein or the Hong Kong Style Noodles straight up.  The sauces are pretty bangin' and the chinese hot sauce is always on hand in case I feel a little ambitious that day.  Also, if you're into fish, I would definitely opt for the Black Bean Fish Fillet plate.  The tangy black bean sauce is definitely a distinct yet palatable taste worth trying.  What im not too keen of is the decor.  It seems to come up in our conversation every time we're there.  If the place was a little more appealing and music was playing in the background, I think Yummy House would muster up a few more customers.  It just feels a little awkward when there is nothing to counter-act the conversation and I have to use my \"hush-hush\" voice to converse.  Definitely a favorite of mine and I plan to come again.. and maybe with a CD to give them next time so I don't feel so weird having a conversation heehee."}
{"text":"terrible, terrible food. (the service is really nice though)  It's the perfect example of cheap, nasty, Americanized Chinese food. It's just so junky tasting I guess its good for.. really nasty junk food standards?  sun-yat sen is rolling over in his grave.  Ridiculously cheap but nasty nasty food, I wouldn't eat it if you paid me.  Their bubble tea is ok, although they use that fake-ass powder. but for $2 its ok.  this place pretty much stops in the summer, all the dumb high schoolers from across the street come here and blow their parents money for lunch everyday, that is how this vile place continues to exist.  I don't even want to think anymore about this junk"}
{"text":"This gets a big 5 star rating from me, largely in part due to nostalgic reasons. Been going to Yummy House since '06. Best bubble tea in Riverdale, hands down! Be sure to try their melon flavoured BT with tapioca balls. Other stuff on their menu including burgers, poutine, etc are ok, like someone else said it's just a quick and cheap food spot mostly for the highschoolers across the street. Very friendly owners as well. Even after I moved out of the area and returned a year later they still remembered me."}
{"text":"One star for taste, and for having $5.50 lunch combos that include fried rice, crab rangoon, and a bowl of egg soup -- when most places won't give you the soup for To Go orders.  Three days ago, I printed a Restaurant.com coupon to try this place near my office, and he told me they stopped taking that coupon two days ago.  How frustrating!  Good customer service would have included an apology and maybe an offer for something free to thank us for trying them anyway, but he just said, \"Nope.\"  I should have walked out, but the cheap lunch specials pulled me and two co-workers in, so we each tried a different combo.  The crab rangoons were the best part of the meal, but everything else was lackluster and we won't go there again.  The orange chicken had big medallions of breaded chicken (not little nuggets) and was reviewed as \"blah\".  The cashew chicken was nice little shreds of grilled chicken, but was \"not as good as other places\".  And the general chicken tasted like sweet and sour sauce with a little chili pepper thrown in for heat -- very disappointing!  The spring rolls were cooked in oil that should have been changed.  The fried rice tasted burnt, and I want to say there was nothing but rice ... but I literally searched the whole pile and did uncover one fleck of egg, two dice of white onion, and a wafer-thin slice of bok choy.  It must be a minimalist mantra there, because the egg soup had nothing added either.  The service was not friendly, and the food was not fast.  As I waited for our food, the cashier was telling his friend across the room how much he partied last night, threw up all over the bathroom, and couldn't get up - he just slept on top of the toilet.  :-/   Our office will look for non-fast-food Chinese somewhere else.  Update: That restaurant.com coupon is still being sold.  I wonder how many people are being cheated by this bait-and-switch scam?"}
{"text":"I usually buy poutine from this cute little house but today I decided to go for chinese. It was flipping amazing and portion was huge and cheap. I bought 12 fried dumplings and beef and vegetables on steamed rice all for just 11 dollars. They also now have debit! Highly recommend!!!!! Also get the fruit 2 go drink only 1.50."}
