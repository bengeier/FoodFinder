{"text":"Upon first entry, this place already exceeded my expectations with open dinning space, nicely decorated, and a 15 ft studio ceiling.  Their full name has 'fusion' in it on the sign. Apart from a jerk wrap, I didn't catch much else that wasn't traditional - which isn't a bad thing, only that this isn't really fusion.   I was happy to see that they had jerk pork, which isn't always easy to find. The flavour and spiciness on the pork were terrific, but it was too fatty. I'm not even the type of person who can't handle some fat, but this was much more than I've had elsewhere. One piece even had that type of fat which is almost like tendon.  The coleslaw was good, and there was an option to have macaroni instead. From their trays and heating, it also looked like they have very good health and sanitary practices. The rice and peas were okay, but could've improved by being a little more seasoned and less wet. Another tip I'd add would be to have a house-made hot sauce available as the bottle kind can never compete.  A fairly positive experience, but they can literally trim the fat in order to improve my rating. I'll go back for the jerk chicken, as I did really enjoy their jerk seasoning."}
{"text":"A new Caribbean place in Brampton? OBVZ I'm there! Not too busy when we came in on a Saturday for lunch but a few more patrons came in while we were eating there. Seems like a family owned business. The young boy taking our orders was so polite and smiling. It was so refreshing and the gentleman who I assume was his dad was even more friendlier and it just made my day. Because the service was so great, I had to give them a solid 4 stars.  I ordered the medium oxtail (there's only medium or large) which was pretty hefty at 13.99 and my friend ordered a large jerk chicken meal. I can't remember how much that was but it was cheaper than mine. Food didn't take too long. We were asked if we wanted coleslaw or macaroni. We both opted for the coleslaw. It was fresh and not too drenched in mayo. The oxtail was okay. There was a certain taste missing but it was still good and had flavour. Both my friend and I enjoyed the rice. Portions were so-so. I thought for 13.99 there could have been more oxtail. I was able to finish the whole meal and not have any leftovers. This defs mean the meal was a little too small. My friend got 4 pieces of chicken in the large but he said they were small pieces.  I really hope this place succeeds because it is a great addition to the downtown area. Plus they are soooo friendly!! It actually makes me sad how friendly they are lol because I just want the best for them and I hope they do well with the new business. I fa sho left something for them in their tip jar. So totally deserving. I do suggest that people come try the food here and they will be blessed with awesome service. I won't get the oxtail again but I will try the jerk pork next time."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with the portion size.  I paid $15 for a medium oxtail dinner and to my surprise I only got 4 pieces of meat.  There are many Jamaican restaurants in Brampton that offer a FULL oxtail dinner, like Gem Jerk, Willy's, Portland Jerk, MO Jerk, Mr Jerks and Sunrise.  Just to name few others.  Unfortunately, I will not be visiting your establishment anymore.  Quality of food was average."}
{"text":"As soon as i walked in I noticed how clean it was but also quite dead. The decorations were quite nice and customer service was good as well. Nothing to write home but the service is there.  I ordered the lunch special which is 7.90, which is quite pricey for a lunch special. Im used to paying around 5/6 bucks for lunch specials or meals that size. It came in one of those small square containers w a leg and really small thigh. It also comes w macaroni salad i believe which i passed on. There are a few options for the lunch special i chose the fried chicken. The fried chicken wasnt bad at all but could def be seasoned a bit better. The rice and peas was pretty generic but i also got oxtail gravy on top..i love lots of oxtail gravy(well usually). There was even a few pieces of oxtail meat and a big piece on top. So i was able to sample that as well. It was not good at all. The gravy was quite watery and the colour of ketchup , which im sure they put aloy of in the oxtail (gross). It did not taste like oxtail at all and the meat was undercooked and super fatty. I definitely will not be back here again."}
{"text":"This is my go-to Caribbean place in downtown Brampton. Good service & a variety of chicken lunch specials for $5.99 (incl drink). I have tried a variety of soups here (soup of the day) and it is always on point!! I love this place because a range of diversity of people dine here! If you are in the area...don't be afraid to check it out!!"}
