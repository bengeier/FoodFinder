{"text":"I had regular coffee and a pumpkin muffin, both actually really fresh and delicious. I was also in a pretty grumpy mood from lack of sleep (had just come off a long, red-eye flight from Hawaii) when I went in there and the fantastic, friendly service turned my entire morning around. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Skip this place. The coffee tastes burned and stale. Service is far too slow for an airport."}
{"text":"Haven't tried the coffee but the sandwiches are great. Even better though is the enthusiasm of the staff. They love their place and it shows in how they interact. I asked for the chicken sandwich with pesto but wanted some greens added. No problem, but then the cashier asked \"hot or cold\" which confused me since it was described as hot. My face must have betrayed that because he added \"I was just thinking that those greens might not do well heated\"  These guys care that you have a good experience."}
{"text":"Press Coffee is the perfect pick me up when hurrying your flight out of the B Gates. Kurt and Mike provide the ideal blend of great coffee and amazing service. Greetings and great music put you in the mood to take on the bustling holiday travel season. This is my frequent stop over. Sorry Starbucks. Perks to everyone at Press Sky Harbor!"}
{"text":"This place gets the one star because the food and sandwiches are good. Otherwise, it's a hot mess -- there are not enough employees, making for long waits just to order -- at times there is no one at the cashier. If you're looking to pick up a quick bite to take on the plane -- be sure that you have at least a half hour before boarding time if you want food from this place."}
{"text":"Awesome tasting chai tea latte! Whenever I have a stop over at Phoenix Intl airport, I insure I grab a chai latte and \"the pressto\" as well - these are small breadsticks along with three tasty sauces. Good enough for vegetarian like me."}
{"text":"Second review.  Tried the breakfast wrap.  Nicely prepared, just not much flavor.  Now the coffee.  The best carmel latte I have had in years.  Staff was awesome as usual."}
{"text":"Just bought a pinot grigio from Press Coffee at the airport, was served beautifully by an oh-so-friendly gentleman named Kurt, an pretty easy on the eyes as well.  mmmmm maybe I'll go get some coffee too."}
{"text":"Stopped for coffee and breakfast before an early flight.   Sky Harbor terminal 4 has a plethora of good options.   Press was at our gate, so we gave it a try.   Coffee was great, possibly better than Cartel.  Great service, very friendly even at 5 am.  Breakfast sandwich was pretty good.  Burrito was a little messy but with the avocado was probably better.  Will need to try their Scottsdale location next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Kudos to Kurt! I requested a special food order & he did not blink an eye. My food was prepared exactly the way I wanted & delivered with a smile. Definitely not the usual airport eatery."}
{"text":"All the food businesses in this concourse are supposed to open at 6:00AM.  Press didn't open until 6:20.  The nice employees said they were waiting for the manager to show up.  I like strong coffee, but the coffee here tasted terrible, especially for first thing in the morning, like the urn had not been clean out for some time.  I had a breakfast burrito, made with a tasteless cardboard whole wheat wrap, ice cold guacamole mix and ice cold salsa from a jar, some kind of tasteless gluey American cheese and egg loaf.  What a disappointment!  In the airport you are a captive audience and the competition is light.  Mr. Press Manager, please open your shop on time and get better ingredients.  Seems like you want to go out of business.  My visit was 09/29/13 6:23AM."}
{"text":"Traveled through PHX on a busy Friday and only had an hour to get lunch. Press coffee was really busy, but the employees at press coffee were quick to get through the line and were friendly while they did it. I ordered the Tuscan chicken panini, got it fast and it was tasty. Next time I'm at sky harbor I'll be going to press coffee."}
{"text":"So I was here in Phoenix with a 2 hour layover. I didnt have breakfast yet so I scoured the airport for options. This place immediately caught my attention it was alive with energy with music and a friendly greeting from the barista.  EXACTLY how I like to start the day. Also woth mentioning that this place is local so no Starbucks today.   The coffe is unique. Hot right amoint of roast and just enough acidity. The bagel and butter was so so. It wasnt bad but it wasnt anything special either but fare for the price.   This place shimes for the fast service and ambience. Really a great find the next time you have some time to kill at PHX."}
{"text":"Kurt( I'm hoping that is his name), has an award winning personality and makes amazing coffee. Totally made my day! Give him a raise!  It's rare to find employees that are so guest oriented and great at what they do"}
{"text":"As other reviewers have noted, Michael and Kurt with a K are high energy, positive people that make your day. I felt like I was their only customer and they were bound and determined to give me their best. My mother in law had the veggie wrap. She loved it. I had the hummus with ciabatta points. Very good. If you find yourself in Terminal 4, B gates make a B line for Press Coffee Food and Wine and tell Michael and Kurt what you want. You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Of all the fabulous high end restaurants in Scottsdale, I came across this outstanding pair of people at Press Coffee at the airport prior to my return flight. These two young men gave service a new meaning! They were accommodating, friendly and possessed a tremendous sense of humor. Thanks Mike and Kirk for a fabulous experience!!! You are unforgettable!"}
{"text":"In a busy crowded airport where things are hectic, it was so nice to visit this coffee shop and have the two gentlemen working the registers be so courteous and polite. And it wasn't just to me, they greeted each guest with a smile and an extremely positive attitude. I didn't catch their names but I hope their management team will recognize and reward them for their great customer service. If I'm ever back in this airport I will go out of my way to visit this place again. And the coffee is delicious! Great job guys! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Best airport coffee shop experience I have ever had. After a long wait at security those guys immediately changed my attitude and day. From incredibly fun servers, great music and quick service this place was exactly what I needed during my travels."}
{"text":"I had to sign up for yelp just so I could review this place. The entire staff is the most friendly I've encountered since...freakin' Disneyland maybe. They worked well together and were above and beyond happy and friendly. It shows that the company they work for takes care of them. Great job!!"}
{"text":"This review is for Press Coffee Roasters PHX airport Terminal 4 B location.  Had a cappuccino and an egg and cheese sandwich.  Cappuccino was ok.  The big disappointment was the sandwich.  Bread was soft and had no flavor.  Eggs and cheese were equally tasteless.  Overall, a McDonald's breakfast for 3x the price.  If you want a quality breakfast at PHX go to Wildflower Bakery by the A gates in Terminal 4."}
{"text":"Blasting R&b at 7:30 am! Have no choice but to listen to it! Not a relaxing terminal, avoid, go to Peets Coffee in concourse A."}
{"text":"What a great family owned business. Waiting for my flight and needed some coffee for a long day and they were awesome.  Plenty of people having food and wine as well. If you are near B10 stop by."}
{"text":"What makes this so special?  The staff.  I had the pleasure of being served by Mike and Kurt.  They treated me like I was someone special and they may never see me again...why treat me (and all the other patrons) so nicely?  They serve the people \"with love\".  The service here and attitude of the staff is beyond remarkable.  I'll be back....."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed in the service here. Besides being out of coffee my order sat on the window for over 5 minutes before it was brought out to me. Then they forgot the napkins so I had to wait even longer. I will definitely choose another breakfast place on my next trip."}
{"text":"Press Coffee is awesome!  Kurt & Mike just made me the best hot chai latte ever. The beverages are great, but the customer service is great as well!  These guys are lots of fun and made me laugh and smile at the end of a very long day. Thanks, guys!!!"}
{"text":"Michael served me a \"full glass\" of chardonnay. It wasn't the best wine,  but the charisma the two gentleman had made my 10 minutes sipping wine enjoyable,  even if he exaggerating a bit.  21 my butt. If you're headed to B11, or nearby,  stop by for a compliment.  Thanks fir the chips Michael,  they were delicious."}
{"text":"I just had the most wonderful service from Michael D.  He was super helpful, friendly, and just downright nice.  It's unfortunately rare these days to have such great service.  I hope Press appreciates such a great employee. It's people like him who make you want to be loyal to a particular establishment.  Bravo Press for finding such a great guy!  I'll be going to Press first before any other location. Luckily there is one near my home as well!"}
{"text":"Well this is a fairly new place to the airport. All the chains have left the airport pretty much. There are still a few. But a lot of them are independent, however HMS host has their hand in some,if not all. Not that that is a bad thing. Anyway I gave them a try one morning about 8:45. I am precise because, that is what it says on my receipt. The girl taking the order is not very happy and I think that it is very high priced. Yes even for the Airport. It is very confusing the way you get in line to order your coffee as well. You actually have to go through another place to get to the ordering station. Starbucks have all gone away from the inner part of the Terminal. 4 now. So you do have some choices. But, I cannot say a lot of great things about Lola's either."}
{"text":"As the only positive, the service was basically friendly. I am a weekly traveler and already have an objection to getting scalped by high airport prices but I understand there are a lot of factors in play. We choose to buy or not based on the prices displayed. But getting over charged is obscene. I ordered a vanilla latte and an oatmeal (ticket number 20036) which took 10 minutes to get. There wasn't hardly even a line. I was charged extra for vanilla instead of theme I price for a vanilla latte. I was also charged extra for the oatmeal fixings which accordance no to the menu are included. When I asked the \"barista\" about the charges she felt I was \"coming at\" her it all I did was ask why I was charged more than the posted price. When I finally got my order she told me sarcastically \"have a blessed day.\"  She wasn't telling other customers that. Other customers laughed when she said it it was so obvious. In the future I will walk the extra distance to take my weekly business elsewhere. Did they offer to fix my charge? No! And I doubt they will even respond"}
{"text":"First of all, they have a damn good coffee and all the milk options a girl could ask for, including unsweetened almond milk. Hallelujah! Paninis are delish too. What really made the difference was the service. Talk about service with a smile- I couldn't help but smile myself! Thank you Kurt! Keep it up, and we will all live longer because of it. Sure makes traveling nicer when you have an option like this!"}
{"text":"The morning crew at 7am on SUN MAY 28 provided more sunshine than the big ball outside. This is how to run a business! Thank you, Ladies, for that big ray of morning sunshine . . . and the macchiato was great, too!"}
{"text":"GREAT coffee, and the baristas are a blast. Good airport experiences are hard to come by.  Thanks, guys!"}
{"text":"Great service and great mocha!!!! The dark guy working the counter was awesome he had tattoos and clearly works out and was honestly a great barista!!!!"}
{"text":"They are super fast here when you are trying to catch a flight. Always very friendly and I love their green tea :) Its also very convenient if you fly out of the B gates at the end of the hall."}
{"text":"Best food served fast in terminal 4 concourse B near gate B9- I have had the Napa Salad for lunch and the breakfast burrito for breakfast here and both were excellent.  They also make great cappucinos.  Most of the restaurants in this terminal all had salads premade in plastic boxes that looked identical.  Press Coffee made the salad fresh and it was outstanding.  Furthermore, the staff was friendly and helpful, which was the reason I first ate there, after waiting a long time at the place next door for a cashier that did not appear happy to be at her post."}
{"text":"One of the few places in any airport that doesn't jack up prices.  Great food and coffee--always fresh and inexpensive.  Every time I come here the employees are super friendly.  Best service I Sky Harbor."}
{"text":"This is one of the great options for food at an airport. The service is incredible and the music in the background adds to the experience. This is definitely worth stopping bye. I Pay to eat here versus a free meal on the airplane!"}
{"text":"Not super.  I love Press Coffee - it has basically spoiled me for other coffees. The original shop is cute, nice, with awesome food and coffee, so of course I was really excited at the prospect of getting some yummy Press goodness at the airport.  Alas, the airport location leaves lots to be desired. It is located in Terminal 4 by the B gates (opposite B8 and B10) It is quite small and serves wine and food in addition to the coffee stuff and pastries. I ordered my regular - Iced White Mocha with Almond Milk... no almond milk :( But not the end of the world.   The guy working was quite nice - friendly, articulate, and considerate. Offered upsells of food, wine, etc to myself and the other customers he assisted while I was there. They only had one person working, who took orders and made the coffee - that meant that the process took longer than it probably should have, but no big deal.  Their seating area is very small (5 seats at a countertop facing the walkway) and has a couple of outlets. The countertops were extremely grungy, which was pretty gross.   I got my Iced White Mocha within a few minutes and grabbed a seat. It was a tad stronger than usual, but I wrote that off as just a difference in the place. THEN I got to the bottom of the cup and YUCK! All of the syrup was gathered in what seemed to be a half-inch deep, foul tasting sludge. It was awful. Completely ruined my experience and I had to go in search of gum or some other drink to clear the grossness out of my mouth.   Also, they do not honor the frequent guest program that the original Press Coffee Shop has - not cool. When I asked about it, I was told that they don't get a lot of regulars - wha? Well, now I know why, I guess :(   Anyhow, totally sad. I am in love with this movement to capture all of the great local Phoenix spots at the airport - but not when they're poor facsimiles so far from the original that you may as well not even use the same name.  I think its a pretty new spot; hopefully they'll improve a bit over time."}
{"text":"Every time I've been here the customer service has been stellar. Also, there is usually a sexy man working and really good music playing."}
{"text":"Cool casual airport joint. Good music. Great vibes. We ordered veggie wrap and a coffee to go. Friendly staff and the food was delicious!   One star less coz I thought food was a touch expensive. I don't blame them since they are in an airport but still...   Overall I would rate as -  Ambience - 5/5 Food taste - 4/5 Presentation - 4/5  Food quantity - 3.5/5 ( portions are smaller than expected) Service - 5/5 (were cordial and service was fairly quick)  Price - 3/5"}
{"text":"The SKY Harbor location has awesome customern service! Michelle is very helpful and very kind. Their wine and kindness was just what I needed :)"}
{"text":"I guess my palate just doesn't appreciate the coffee these guys serve up. For those of you you do like their stuff... Enjoy!"}
{"text":"A great alternative to Sbux. Americano was good. Asked how many shots I want rather than assuming. Nice. Breakfast burrito was huge. Come if your hungry. Nice experience for an airport. Well done press."}
{"text":"The two guys that work here are spreading joy with their customer engagement. This is my 2nd time here and they are consistent. My review is for the experience though the coffee is great, too. They have turned an airport dining experience into a joy."}
{"text":"Came here 2/16/17 on my way home to Long Beach, CA. @ 8:30  - super nice guy working the register and being incredibly polite and conversational. A really good experience after a long travel across the country. Whoever that guy is, thank you   PROS: - wine & beer selection - coffee options and drinks - sandwiches, teas, breakfast - Smoothies! - outlet to charge tech - awesome staff!!  CONS: - needs more seating"}
{"text":"Every time I come here the service is fantastic. Staff is always friendly. Great coffee and shocked at the cheap price tag on the beer and wine. Great place to fuel up pre-flight."}
{"text":"A little pick me up before a flight or a nice light snack is what this place offers. Press and coffee serves up a cup a Joe, snacks and maybe a little wine at 8 in the morning with positive vibes and energy.   Ambiance- it's made to look modern and grabs your eye right away. Tucked in a little food court area this little business's seems the newest. The lighting is a bit more dim and uses darker shades to create a hip vibe.   Service: top notch!!!! This place radiates energy. The morning staff seemed on fire and on top of their game  on a weekend nontheless. Got up super early for a morning flight connecting here feeling sleepy and groggy, but the energy and service of the team woke me up.   Price: $5.50 for a 16oz vanilla latte. Not bad but not the greatest. But it's at an airport so expect slightly higher prices.   Food/Drink- Did not try any of the food. But the coffee was good. It wasn't amazing. As previous reviews said their coffee isn't the strongest. Usually lattes are known for their slightly stronger bite do to the espressso shots used. The latte i got was  subtle and gave me a quick pick me up for my next flight.   Overall: not a bad experience. GREAT service and a good coffee. Definitely on the lighter side of coffee but decent. If your feeling especially adventurous maybe try some of their wine before a morning flight?"}
{"text":"I stopped here for a coffee while on a layover, and it was some of the best customer service I have received...anywhere!  Usually airport employees are non-engaging and seem like they are just trying to make it through the day. These employees were in a great mood, professional and conversational. It made my day!  Thank you!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice for breakfast before flights.  Both times the coffee drinks were 5-star.  The first time I had an Americano, and this morning I had an iced mocha, made as lite as possible.  Rich and smooth.  I would drink their coffee any day.  The bacon breakfast sandwich this morning on the English muffin had floppy bacon, a chewy egg patty, and a chewy, untoasted, but heavily microwaved English muffin.   I ate 1/3rd because I was hungry and had to let the rest go.  Not worth the $6.95 or whatever I paid for it.  1.5 stars.  The young man taking the orders & money was friendly and fast.  5/5 stars.  The young woman making the drinks was slower than shit and when she handed me my drink and thought she was sending me on my way, I mentioned I was waiting for a breakfast sandwich, which happened to be waiting for me in the window because I saw it delivered a few minutes prior.  Bell dinging to announce it and everything.  She growled and groaned and went back to making coffee drinks.  Slower than shit.    Ok, missy.  -2 stars.  When the nice young man at the register was finished with a customer he brought me my sandwich.    She seriously needs to work on her speed as a barrista and her customer service skills.  I got to sit and gnaw on my sandwich and watch the line grow and grow this morning.  I'm easily entertained.  Overall, I would come back because the coffee drinks are excellent.  If Young Miss Attitudey Judy is working, I may think twice."}
{"text":"So I can only really review the breakfast food here. I was at the airport so early that even security gates weren't open, so when I got to my gate nothing was open either. After some time and right before I had to board, I figured I should get some breakfast, and Press was the only place open yet.  Pretty much every breakfast item is $7.65, and while I know I'm subject to airport pricing, I'd expect quality that would at least surpass McD's. Nope. My breakfast sandwich was a wannabe Bacon McMuffin with a barely toasted English muffin, lifeless bacon strips and flavorless egg and cheese.  I guess Press is a breakfast option for when you're at the airport too early and have a corporate card to pay for overpriced food. At least the staff were nice for it being so early."}
{"text":"These two guys Mike and Kurt are the best. Great service, hospitality and professionalism here! Pretty good eats too. This is the spot without doubt!"}
{"text":"I'm becoming a regular with all my flights taking off next to it. Paninis are great and go well with my hazelnut latte"}
{"text":"I love local spots inside the airport, so much nicer than your typical airport fare.  I had a delicious mango smoothie here. I'm not sure exactly what more there is to say about it other than the fact that it was great, and very mango-y.  My husband liked his coffee.  We'd definitely go again, and I want to check out their location in Scottsdale next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Satisfied breakfast on the GOOO  Thanks for making mine in a hurry, only had a few mins but y'all made it happen. Appreciate the service."}
{"text":"I love that there is some other coffee place now at Sky Harbor other than the usual Starbucks! Not only that, Press is imPRESSive! The staff is on their froth! They are all very inviting and friendly from the moment you step foot off the concourse carpet into the enclave of java/sandwich/salad/etyou are treated like a guest and not a number. I like that. They are seemingly thankful you are there to give them your time and money. I love that they recommend coffees or what not for you if you are sometimes indecisive like me. I sometimes want the Americano add shot and sometimes the American with two add shots! I mean I am a blonde and that is how it goes...hard to make those PRESSing decisions before I fly off to the friendly..skies! To go off the beans of normal try the macchiato, a little different than the one at the competitor. Good on the go grub for the flight too."}
{"text":"5 stars are directly related to the enthusiastic gentleman working behind the counter. Amazing customer skills & genuine. Frappe is delicious & daughter ordered oatmeal she enjoyed. Line moves fast. Bit pricey but expected at airport."}
{"text":"It was maybe about 5% better than what I would imagine McDonalds must taste like. I ordered a breakfast sandwich with no meat. The cashier asked if I would like avocado, so I said yes thinking it was being offered as a substitute, as I've experienced in many other cases. But they charged me a dollar for avocado, which turned out to be a spoonful of store bought guacamole. The cheese tasted like chemicals and my boyfriend's Americano tasted like watered down coffee. Eat at Matt's if they're open, or walk across the terminal to Starbucks."}
{"text":"The B gates do not have as many options for grab and go food.  This was my first time here and I enjoyed the wrap that I took on my flight."}
{"text":"Fast quick friendly service if your looking for a little breakfast sandwich and coffee or OJ before your flight!"}
{"text":"I'm not a coffee drinker so did not try it. I'm sure it's good. However, I ordered the Breakfast Sandwich with a sausage patty and it was horrible!!! There were NO condiments, so it was dry. The description on the menu stated \"scrambled eggs\"; however the egg was a slab of blandness. There was no cheese (???). The English muffin was not toasted and soggy. I can make a better sandwich. It was the worst breakfast sandwich I ever had. And for the price (close to $8!!), a complete rip off!!"}
{"text":"Great place to grab a quick bite and a coffee before boarding the flight. We had their giant oatmeal raisin cookie and a black coffee, and enjoyed it. Kept us pretty full throughout the flight. :-)"}
{"text":"Been here a few times for morning coffee and food. They usually keep things moving pretty well and the coffee is good. Way easier to get a morning coffee and snack here than at Starbucks which always has a long line!"}
{"text":"The coffee is not that great, way too strong.  I love coffee but not this coffee.  Also, I tried the breakfast burrito.  It was even worse.   If I wasn't at the airport I would ask for my money back.  terrible, terrible, terrible.  I feel that I wasted my money."}
{"text":"OUTSTANDING Napa salad with chicken - so fresh/healthy and flavorful! Amazing service from start to finish. I travel a lot and I can honestly say this was my best airport food experience ever! I highly recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a fresh food experience.  They also have great wine and coffee options! And the grilled cheese looked amazing!"}
{"text":"Two hour delay means there is only one thing to do...Eat!! I chose this place with really low expectations. It was really more due to convenience as it was located super close to my gate. To my delightful surprise this spot ended up being very delicious!  They offer a small menu of wraps, sandwiches, salads, and hummus. They also have a ton of coffee options for those that are looking for a pick me up. For lunch I decided on the BLT Panini with a side order of the hummus plate.  Both items were wonderful! The hummus was your usual pita and hummus combo, nothing to rave about but it was delicious. The panini however was the real winner. It has a perfect ratio of bread to toppings and sauce. When pressed with the panini grill it gives it that extra crunchiness and melts the cheese to perfection. The sandwich overall was delicious even though it was just a basic BLT! I recommend it for anyone that stops by.  The staff is also another highlight of my experience. Everyone that I engaged with were super friendly and helpful. They all seem to have been trained well as they worked efficiently and knew their stuff.  Overall, great experience. This spot is the silver lining of a two hour delay. The delicious food and friendly service will have me coming back the next time I am in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Killer cup of coffee and super-cool, super-friendly staff during an all out blitz at the counter. Bravo!"}
{"text":"Super Great Service From Daquan and excellent tasting latte!  All is good at this little stop...   Daquan (I probably spelled his name wrong) was super polite and made me a great coffee.   Stop by when you're at terminal 4 and get a drink...."}
{"text":"I must give credit where it due. As a frequenter of PHX this place always radiates positive vibes and gets you ready for your flight. The owners make the place! I can only speak to the wine, but it's the best in Terminal B!"}
{"text":"Need a good cup of coffee and you're at Sky Harbor?  Head to terminal 4 and find Press Coffee down at the end of the terminal.  Their coffee is a fresh roast with a lite aroma and smooth finish.  I particularly like getting a double shot Americano with a little room.  It's very tasty and a great way to start your flight to wherever you're headed.  As you can see by my check ins I'm here a lot and its because of their coffee and service.     I hope to see you see there."}
{"text":"Drink and muffin were very good, airport prices.  The staff was very friendly and they serve Dr. Smoothie drinks!"}
{"text":"Terrible service from two of the gals up front (believe one was named Marcella). Hardly looked up at me and were laughing about something on their phone that they were showing each other. The next customer in line got the same treatment. I have been to Press at other locations and this was by far the worst experience.   A woman named Michelle came out later and she was professional and nice so I can't justify one star."}
{"text":"This place has a nice selection of sandwiches and wine. I got the chicken panini with avocado, it was ready quickly and very good. The pinot grigio was yummy, not too sweet. The best part was the service! The gentlemen were so personable and warm - vey nice when you are traveling and just need a friendly face! I will definitely stop in again my next time through Phoenix."}
{"text":"Great service goes a very long way. On a connection in PHX I stopped for a latte and panini. Both were good. I'm from Portland, OR...so as far as coffee it's not necessarily star. But when coffee is served with a smile and when you are acknowledged - it goes a long way. I ate nearby and listened as they wishes everyone a good day and apologize when the wait was a bit longer than usual. Love the energy of this place. Thanks for a pleasant pitstop guys! Made the second half of my trip from being away from my family for a week so much better."}
{"text":"Amazing service and coffee! Probably the best blended coffee drink that I have ever had- and I have at least one a day! I got a soy mocha coconut frappe with a shot of espresso. It was delicious and blended perfectly! The right amount of sweet- but still tastes like coffee! This place makes me want to drive the extra hour to fly out of Phoenix instead of Tucson."}
{"text":"Monday the 22nd these 2 girls were in here at 4:40am killing it. Food was fast (I suggest the Grand Canyon breakfast burrito -add avocado ) and these girls really provided some great food and AMAZING service"}
{"text":"Best thing to happen all day so far.  Got groped by tsa in Seattle.  Sat on the runway for an hour in Phoenix once we landed.  Then this young man in a NY Yankees jersey took my drink order with such positivity and enthusiasm.  And the coffee was delicious to boot.  I'll be stopping by again in a couple days on my way back out."}
{"text":"Do not go here !!! The barista makes terrible drinks and it took 30 minutes !! I'm not even exaggerating!! It may have been even longer. Excuse me owners of Press fire your barista from today 5/27"}
{"text":"Very nice modern coffee kiosk with friendly people serving you.  The coffee really amazed me, I went with low expectations just to get a cup of Java but I was wrong. I've got an Americano and the taste was balanced and with good flavour.  It can sound not relevant at all but the design of the cup made with corrugated material feels very comfortable and you don't need to use any slid to don't burn your fingers."}
{"text":"I very unfortunately had a bad experience at this location this morning. I frequent the location in Scottsdale Quarter and love it there--people are friendly and the coffee is wonderful! It's clean and organized and the music is great. This location didn't have any of those things. The staff was rude and while it was busy, they need to learn to be friendlier, especially to someone who is actually being friendly. There were a couple rude people in front of me, but rude customers are a part of life. Treat every customer as a new experience. The counters were dirty, there was a weird sign with an old woman on it with some quote about not being offended by being carded--it looked like something that should be hanging up in a TGI Friday's. I think this establishment is really hurting the Press Coffee Brand name. Perhaps management should be instilling some better customer service practices? Everyone seemed unhappy and this comes from the top down. I would suggest going to the Starbucks near the a14 gates. The iced coffee was pretty good, but they were out of espresso at 7:30am. I hope the management makes some changes."}
{"text":"Located at the B gates (B1-14) this is a great find! While my husband raced across the airport to the C-gates to get a Cartel coffee I opted for less stress and figured I'd just make do with the options we had nearby. Finding Press was like striking gold! It's locally owned and they have good coffee and food (wine too!) the barista and cashier were both super friendly and looked like they were having fun at work- which is pretty rare at airports. I ordered a macchiato and a turkey BLT to go. The macchiato was more of a 4-star coffee (temp was way too hot and served in a to go cup). The BLT was delicious! It's a pressed sandwich with turkey, cheese, lettuce, tomato, avocado and some sort of Pesto. A little messy to eat but really good. I'd eat here again for sure. $23 for a coffee, sandwich and a bottle of water is a little steep, but that's nothing new at an airport. I'd rather spend that money at a local spot any day."}
{"text":"Went here after a great lunch at Zinburger to be sadly disappointed at the quality of our latte. My wife and I ordered a vanilla latte with an extra shot of espresso. The latte had way too much vanilla in it... No need to overcompensate with vanilla if someone orders a drink with an extra shot since they are likely more interested in the taste of the espresso. Overall, this place has a great vibe to have a latte with friends but comes up just short of making a good latte."}
{"text":"Had a long layover at Phoenix Airport and went here.  I must say it lifted my spirits to have Kurt serve me.  He was an outstanding example of kind respectful and delightful customer service.  I have noted that and will be going back here every time I fly through Phoenix.  Thanks for having such great customer service! You Rock!"}
{"text":"Adequate...  Expensive...  Entertaining...  Could be faster.  As an airport employee, I am working my way through the various food and beverage establishments at Terminal 4.  It makes sense to me that I should know and have an opinion about the places folks ask about.  The location is a uniquely placed spot at the end of the concourse.  Not sure how the layout was settled on, but the combination order/service line is a bit confusing.  Try for one of the stools near the counter, just be careful that folks are going to be nudging through behind you as the service stop with napkins, etc., is strangely placed in the flow of traffic.  11:30 AM, and there is no line at Press.  I step up to the counter and place my order for half a turkey wrap, salad and tea.  My guesstimate was that this might take 2 minutes to deliver...no such luck.  2 orders ahead of mine were served up, but it took 10 minutes for my order.  OK...not an unreasonable wait...until I was served.  The half a wrap...about 4 good bites.  The salad...about 6 good forkfuls...and the 16-ounce tea was all right.  For the price, $6.50, I was left wanting.  It was OK."}
{"text":"Terrible terrible.   Two stars only for the very friendly service.   Espresso was burnt. Worst cappuccino (ugh so smarmy). Sorry it's true!   Almond milk tastes off, it could have been because it was heated WAAAY too fast and at too high a temp.   No no no. Starbucks does a better job, I really hate to say that.   True coffee drinkers stay away!"}
{"text":"Iced chai latte was decent but pricey at nearly $6 for a 20 oz. The Arizona Club Panini was awful; the bread was really tough and chewy (like it came out of a microwave). I took a few bites and threw out the rest."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is terrible. If it were outside the airport, it would have already gone out of business. The Tuscan Chicken panini tastes more like a week-old anonymous Tex-Mex dish. My soy latte tastes burnt. I really thought soy lattes were impossible to mess up, but somehow they managed to achieve that. The only reason they get 2 instead of 1 stars is that the employees are actually very nice and friendly. They are just working within the constraints of a terrible cafe."}
{"text":"WOW. Mike and his co-worker were truly two of the best examples of customer service I have ever experienced. I want to go back and get something else just to experience them again! Simply outstanding. My tea was perfect and so were their faces:) Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Why does press put their name on this product?  Literally in the top ten worst cappuccinos I've ever had.  Dreadful.  Love their Tempe location.  Unacceptable coffee here at airport.  Fix it!"}
{"text":"Best coffee I've had in a while. Friendly staff. Great way to kill time before flights."}
{"text":"After a long day of traveling, a bad experience at the next door so called Mexican restaurant and a short time to catch a connecting flight, a tequila shot was desperately needed but wine would be the next best thing.   Press Coffee Food & Wine came in handy. The wine was cold, service was fast and good. Michael, the guy at the register was fun, chatty, friendly and sympathetic to us travelers. I was in and out and had no time to hang out but they seemed to have a wide selection of beer, wine, coffee and sandwiches.   MICHAEL (at the register and serving drinks): YOU ROCK. You get five stars for outstanding customer service. You are fun and witty and your friendly  ways have a way to turn things around. Keep up the good work!  The small bar facing the gates could use some cleaning as it was collecting empty glasses and bread crumbs but on the bright side it had some outlets to recharge electronic devices."}
{"text":"First time I've ever been to Press Coffee, will NOT be the last.  One of the best iced mocha's I've had in a long time.  And I have a lot of them.  This may even be better than the ones I make at home from my superauto espresso machine.  And the employees were amazingly friendly.  See you on my next flight!"}
{"text":"Quick stop, cheerful and attentive service . Great coffee and food and not to forget the wine and beer too! Everything you would want when at the gate waiting for your flight and it's good. Wish they had more to these places at all airports. The two people working the counter and order were so welcoming and engaging , maybe it's an Arizona thing but it sure was something I found very consistent with everybody in line . Cheers to such coffee shops at airports!  Didn't give it five stars as the breakfast sandwich did lack a little seasoning,but their service made up for that."}
{"text":"Great service. Rubbish food. But I guess that's to be expected in an airport terminal. Iced coffee was just alright. I've had way better. Caesar side salad had pieces of rotten & brown lettuce. And my Tuscan chicken wrap came out with nothing but lettuce on it.  There was literally zero chicken anywhere to be found. I had to send it back and request another one. The new one they send out was just as bad. Won't be back. Waste of money."}
{"text":"I only tried the iced mocha so that's what I'm basing my review on, but it was amazing! Prices are decent except charging extra for whipped cream is kinda lame. Service was exceptional!"}
{"text":"Conveniently located at the end of the B wing by gates 11-14. Perfect for early flights! Especially when only other option open is Wendy's. Loved the breakfast burrito & you get an option of bacon or sausage (neither for me, $1 to add avocado). The staff are awesome! Friendly & engaging with everyone in line. I appreciated their humor and kindness at 5am before a flight. I've been here before & grabbed a latte- not bad."}
{"text":"Kurt and J were so great...accomodated my request for 'no this', and 'extra that' on my panini!  And wrapped it separately for my dad and me. All with a smile!   You don't usually expect (or get!) great service at an airport food location, but this was a real exception!    Arizona Club panini is amazing BTW. Thanks for good food and GREAT service!"}
{"text":"Just ordered drinks - great wine.  Very friendly staff!    So needed at airport!!    Located in airport will elevate prices but not too much here.   Found them reasonable!"}
{"text":"$7+ with tip wasted on a horribly undrinkable latte.   Not sure why the high ratings here?  Maybe the food's good?  Wouldn't know since I came for the coffee, and the coffee's just plain foul.  A strange combination of super weak, burnt tasting... all kinds of wrong.  People working here were very friendly and nice though, just not enough to disguise the vile sludge they're trying to pass off as coffee."}
{"text":"This is my first time here and I have to say that I was very impressed with the customer service given. It was 5:30 in the morning and the staff greeted me with a smile. I ordered the Mango fruit smoothie as well as a strawberry one and they were delicious. Although this was a bit far from my actual gate, this place was recommended to me so I took the walk and I have to say that I am glad that I did. If you are looking for a great pick me up on the day of your flight, stop at this little spot and check it out. It's  close to Gate B9 in Terminal 4. You will also be glad that you did!"}
{"text":"I am so impressed with the fabulous service received this morning. Who is that cheerful at 4:30 in the morning?  I don't know how but the young man helping us this morning was wonderfully friendly to absolutely everyone he came in contact with.  He has a smile that would light up a room and he used it well! Very nice to receive that level of service when trying to wake up and get a long day started!"}
{"text":"Loved barristas service, extremely nice and I loved the music they were playing ( R&B ) Overall great place"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff, especially Brandon whose contagious smile will brighten your day. And oh....the coffee & food is delicious too!"}
{"text":"Shoutout to the super friendly cashier and barista who turned my mood around after being welcomed to the Phoenix airport by a snarky American Airline desk operator who was mad that a bunch of people missed our memo (that we didn't get) on where to wait for our valeted bags. Misplaced bitching aside, the guy who was the cashier was crazy personable and instantly fixed my slightly sour arrival. The baristas name was Mike but I'm not sure what the other guys name was. Either way, thanks for reminding me that not everyone is rude and mad that they have to work at their job ;)"}
{"text":"What a delightful experience!  The staff was so friendly and genuinely happy this morning.  Good coffee! Hidden at the end of terminal 4, gate b."}
{"text":"Coolest guys in the world. Definitely a great place to stop if your in the AA terminal"}
{"text":"Oh the guy working there made my morning! He was so kind and positive towards all his customers. It's simple things like that, that could make your whole day. Thank you for making my day, don't remember his name but definitely deserves recognition. I'm from Seattle area so of course I'm picky with my coffee. I got the macchiato with vanilla and caramel. It was delicious and perfect to get me energized for the day. I stayed up all night so it was the perfect treat to keep me up till I boarded the place. Thanks for the great customer service! If I ever have a layover in Arizona again, I will be sure to stop by again."}
{"text":"Favorite Phoenix Area coffee spot and it is in the airport. :D So happy there is more than Starbucks here. Sorry Starbucks, this is real coffee not adult milkshakes."}
{"text":"Service  - with attitude  I always drop by the press coffee at Scottsdale Quarter and staff is great. This was my first visit to the Sky Harbor location.  I asked if they did pour overs (my usual) and the barista gave me a dirty look and said no so I ordered a cappuccino.  She then proceeded to make and serve the next 2 orders one of which was the same as mine!  When she served each order she stared straight at me as if to say: you are going to wait!  I refrained from making any comment or complaint.   I suppose that's one way to feel like you have some power.  I give it 3 stars because the coffee was good.  Just didn't need the 'tude."}
{"text":"Best service and friendliest coffee stop in the airport. Great coffee and a must stop if you are in the terminal."}
{"text":"This place was a nice little airport cafe. The staff was super nice, the breakfast burrito was solid (not authentic, but exactly what I wanted -- eggs and bacon wrapped in a tortilla with some salsa to dunk it in), and the coffee was good. They kept things moving quickly, and were just so friendly and welcoming that I felt all warm and fuzzy as I waited on my 3 hours delayed flight x_X"}
{"text":"Shout out to Lauren for best attitude and customer service! Efficient and friendly: what a dynamic combo!! Delicious latte as well"}
{"text":"I ordered the Grand Canyon Burrito with avocado ($1.00 extra), a Naked Juice, and a coffee that came out to about $19.00 which is quite expensive for a breakfast.   When you get the burrito, you're given the option of sausage, bacon, or ham. I went with the clear choice and got bacon. The burrito was on a wheat tortilla that was lightly toasted/pressed. Two notes about the burrito, it wasn't the size of the Grand Canyon, it was actually on the smaller size. For the extra dollar I paid for the avocado, I expected a decent amount, but I never saw or tasted it. The bacon, although limited, was very good and so were the eggs.   The coffee was too bitter for my liking, but still drinkable. Think of a mix between Dunkin Donuts and Starbucks. The service was quick and very friendly, so they have that going for them. I'd be back to try another item if I had limited options, which there's no lack of."}
{"text":"Almond milk option in an airport? I'm always fascinated by this. I think Phoenix cares about being healthy after all!  I got an iced mocha almond milk and tasted great. The two baristas were super friendly. No complaints!"}
{"text":"This is the worst cup of coffee I've ever had... I've managed to drink some really bad coffee, but I couldn't bear to drink this. Had to throw it out. It didn't help that the barista stuck her hand inside my cup to get it unstuck from the stack of other cups.  I also got a blueberry muffin; it was dry and not that good either. I'd HIGHLY recommend that you get your morning coffee from anywhere else in the airport"}
{"text":"In terminal B. Coffee, smoothies, sandwiches, wraps and charge your phone while you wait to depart. The panini is not the prettiest looking but very tasty and fulfilling. They are made to order also so you can adjust the ingredients. Not bad for airport food"}
{"text":"Had a sad veggie wrap and diet soda. Not unusual for airport food."}
{"text":"You know.... airport locations are rarely as good as regular locations, and this was the truth for Press. Regardless, the service here was top notch and the coffee was acceptable. Prices are fairly reasonable. I'd definitely come here over Starbucks hands down."}
{"text":"My favorite place for coffee at Sky Harbor. On early morning flights, I've been known to walk across several gates in order to get something to eat or drink here. The service is always great, and it feels good to support a local coffee place even while traveling. Nothing like a latte from here to get your day of travel off to the right start!"}
{"text":"I'm so happy The Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport added an alternative to Starbucks!   Press Coffee food & wine offers coffee drinks, beer, wine, sandwiches, salads, wraps, and pastries. It's got a grab and go  atmosphere, but there is also a counter to sit and get on wifi. The coffee is smooth and delicious, I didn't even need to add cream.  My hubby got a cinnamon roll, which they warmed up for him and he devoured it. The staff were young friendly college girls who were very fast and helpful, and greatly appreciated the addition we made to their \"college fund\" jar."}
{"text":"I actually liked stumbling upon this coffee/wine location located within the Sky Harbor Airport during my stopover a couple weeks ago.    Two of my favorite things to drink......coffee and wine?!   The staff here was so nice and couldn't decide whether or not to get some caffeine or alcohol in my system.  After talking to the person who helped me at the register,  I ended up getting latte.  Only because she reminded me that I would have to drink the wine in the tiled area, where as the coffee I could go wander back to my gate.    My beverage was made quickly and tasted up to par, so I'm glad to have come here.  Also, as much as I love my Starbucks, it doesn't have the ridiculously long line."}
