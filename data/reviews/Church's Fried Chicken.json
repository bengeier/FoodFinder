{"text":"I always get coupons from them and it always bring me back to buy their chicken and the price are also good too. But they don't have a drive-thru like the one on baseline and I'm just being lazy.."}
{"text":"I am very disappointed in this place. I ALWAYS try to guve them the benefit of the doubt and everyone time i get disappointed. This time my chicken was old obviously has been re heated and my macarroni and cheese ia burnt. NEVER GO HERE"}
{"text":"We don't have a Church's Chicken where I'm from, but I've seen it plenty of times throughout the south.  After burning an undisclosed number of calories on the elliptical, I was craving just 1 piece of fried chicken, a biscuit and mashed potatoes.  That's it!   I knew I didn't want Popeyes.  Somehow Church's Chicken came to mind so I gave it a shot.  I'm so, so, so glad I did.  I noticed all the 1 and 2 star reviews but that didn't stop me from wanting to try it.  Personally, I think the 1 star reviews were pretty unfair.  I mean who orders Mac and Cheese at a drive through chicken place like Church's or KFC.  Who even orders Mac and Cheese from Boston Market.  You can bet your bottom dollar it'll be watery and runny.  You can most certainly count on that!

Everyone should know, at places like KFC or Church's, your sides should be simple ... something they can't mess up too much.  Coleslaw, Mashed Potatoes, Fries or something like that.  I went with mashed potatoes with gravy and coleslaw.  As mentioned, I wanted just 1 piece of chicken, 1 biscuit and mashed potatoes but Church's had a $5 deal.  For 5 bucks, you can get 2 pieces of mixed chicken (I had a leg and thigh), 2 sides and 1 honey biscuit.  That was everything I needed in that moment ... all for $5. I didn't see dessert on the menu but standing at the registered I noticed a sign for Sweet Potato Pie for $1.19.  In the picture the pie looked at if it were something like a sweet potato/apple turnover.  In the picture was tones of sweet potato chunks and more of a runny filling.  What I received was a Sweet Potato Puree turnover kind of deal ... still delicious but didn't look or taste as it would in the picture. 

I had absolutely no issue with service.  There's only 1 cash register and 1 person to run the register so they can only do but so much, move but so fast.  When I ordered the pie she told me it would be 6 minutes and asked if I wanted to wait until the pie was done to get my entire meal.  I said Yes.  Once the pie was done, nice and hot, she called my ordered and that was that.  No issues with service.

My chicken was hot, crispy and fresh ... cooked to perfection.  The biscuit was cold but when I ordered I noticed they had quite a few sitting out as if they made a few batches not too long ago. When I initially ordered and sat down to wait for my food, there was just 1 other couple in the restaurant.  By the time I received my food there was a rotating door of about 6 more customers.  I like to see that kind of thing ... especially considering how many 1 star reviews they had. I'd definitely try Church's again... probably one more time by the end of the week"}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Don't know the menu and takes forever. Go to Popeyes down the road."}
{"text":"My food is always fresh, you can see the red light but it never sits to long. The manager is always helping out the staff and the tables stay clean. I will return here more often."}
{"text":"Let me sum it up: Food is horrible, mac and cheese was runny, poor service , got a medium mac and cheese I opened it it was basically a small."}
{"text":"I was craving some Church's and they didn't have a drive thru, so I went in and ordered some chicken. They handed me a plate full of hot sauce and ketchup. Whaaaaat????Where's the honey and butter for my corn and biscuit? You missed the mark...Chicken was awful and who puts hot sauce on their biscuit?"}
