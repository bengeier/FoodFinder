{"text":"Heading back to this place.  Thin crust Chicago style?!? YES!!!! its awesome."}
{"text":"Excellent. Pizza is delicious. They serve a very thin crust pizza that is absolutely great. Family owned and operated. Owners are super friendly. We had passed by this spot many times but never stopped. We are glad we finally checked it out. Now we are regulars.   No alcohol served but it is BYOB. Bonus!  Go there & try it. You will like it."}
{"text":"They do thin crust Chicago style pizza perfectly.  And to you other reviewers, this is a well known style of pizza in Chicago/Midewest; not as well-known as a Malnati's/Gino's-style deep dish, but a legit pie.  I can understand being surprised if you're expecting deep dish, and they probably could do a better job warning people that they are thin crust.  ANYWAY, their pies have a nice crispy crust, sweet sauce.  When you place an order for pick-up they give you the exact number of minutes until your pizza is ready, and are pretty darn exact with it.  Decor is all Chicago-teams, street signs, posters, etc. They don't serve beer/wine, but we've brought a cooler with beers in there several times and haven't had any complaints from the staff.  The ONLY reason I gave them 4 stars and not 5 is that they are only open Th-Sun from 3:30-9ish.  It's still my favorite pizza in the valley! (I didn't think they took credit cards, but maybe I am mistaken. We've always had cash to pay with)"}
{"text":"Well, you guys did it now!!!!   My parents came to visit for the 1st time since we moved here from Chicago. We were supposed to go out to dinner last night, but they were tired from traveling and wanted a pizza. Now, my dad is late 60s and grew up on the South Side of Chicago and has lived on the North Side for almost 50yrs with local-family pizza joints EVERYWHERE. Contrary to popular belief, Chicago is NOT all about Deep Dish and Pan Pizza. A lot of us LOVE a proper, crispy, square cut thin crust. Not that floppy pie cut NY Style thin crust. Having tried the regular crust a couple of times, I decided to give the Medium Crust a try with Sausage and Onion, and easy on the cheese(An owner favorite I might add) Fantastic job! My dad and I were both impressed! \"Kid, you found yourself a great pizza joint out here\" were his words!  Whether you're from Chicagoland and craving a family style pizza joint that knows what they're doing, or just curious to try Chicago Style Thin Pizza, THIS is your Spot!  Quit messing with floppy NY Pizza and make the switch! You won't look back..... Just a tip about Square Cut Pizza. We eat the outside crust pieces first, and work our way to the middle. The Middle pieces without a crust edge are the ideal pieces to have leftover the next day. COLD! We don't reheat pizza!!!    Bravo guys!!! The only thing my dad was missing were the crinkle cut fries and some garlic bread from his local Chicagoland Spot! No big deal, more room for pizza!!!"}
{"text":"We've been getting Pizza here for years, and it's still our favorite anywhere.  Very thin crust, wonderful sausage, and very flavorful.  Reminds me of the pizza we got growing up outside of Chicago."}
{"text":"So we have been driving by this pizza joint that seems to be perpetually closed, yet it looks pretty interesting on the outside...especially on this particularly quiet stretch of Cave Creek Rd.  Turns out that Johnnie's is only open Thursday through Sunday.  Johnny himself mans the pizza counter, giving long hellos to everyone.  Apparently, he has been turning out pizza in this location since the 90s.  So it's a total neighbor joint with lots of kids and families dropping in.  I would recommend the deluxe on thin crust...you might be tempted to go for the Joanie (slightly thicker crust) or the medium crust...but don't give in to this impulse...the crust here is perfectly crisp and quite dense, so thin is more than sufficient to satisfy the hungry beast.  Johnnie's has fresh toppings and good sauce.  But they do take 20 minutes to make the pizza to order, so phoning in your order before hand is a good idea.  Oh yeah, and Johnny will let you customize your pizza anyway you want...down to quarters.  3 stars for the pizza plus extra star for super customization and Johnnie with his friendly greetings for all."}
{"text":"TLC is what this place is about!  The pizza is delicious and the owners are great. We felt right at home our first time there. I wish that we had tried this place sooner. Well done Johnnie's!  We'll be back."}
{"text":"Great Pizza wonderful people. Can't get them on the phone and the hours are \"flexible \" ie: hard to reach. But the food is worth it if you can get through to them to order."}
{"text":"My favorite Chicago Thin Crust Pizza place! I've been going here for years and even though Johnnie is no longer with us, offering his humor and conversation, the family still carries on the traditions very well.  They make their own sauce and crust, and hand slice everything. The freshness of the ingredients and the special family recipe make this a unique and delicious pizza. And if you miss Chicago, dine in and take your time looking at the family's photos and collectables."}
{"text":"The real deal.  True Chicagoans will admit a love for deep dish, but have a passion and prefer Chicago Thin Crust.  As authentic as it gets.  This is my second pie, and will now go out of my way to be a regular customer."}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza I have ever had. Johnnie's isn't open all week, but when they are their food is terrific. All ingredients are made from scratch and you can tell."}
{"text":"For those who, like me, love pizza but find most pizza joints more or less interchangeable, this is a find.  The crust is cracker thin, allowing the flavors of the cheese, sauce and toppings to really shine through.  It's cut into smaller square pieces, making it good for \"finger foods\" at parties as well as family meals.  It's almost a different product than that of the other pizza joints I like.  When I have a craving for \"pizza\" I can go almost anywhere.  But when I have a craving for \"Johnnies\", I have to come here."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town.   Makes me miss Chicago!    I don't know if they have air conditioning or they don't turn it on, but it is usually very warm so I take it to go.  Either way....best thin crust pizza in town by my midwest standards."}
{"text":"Crazy little pizza joint that will make you think you are back in Chicago.  If you can get past the paper plates and the fact that they are only open a couple days a week you will absolutely love this place.  Family owned and operated and they were all very nice and appreciative of everyone's business.  Prices were very reasonable considering how most Chicago style places like Rosatis think it is acceptable to charge $25 for a pizza these days."}
{"text":"This is our go-to pizza place in Phoenix! We love grabbing a Johnnie's pizza when we're watching the Blackhawks game at home. Their pizza is thin crust, crispy with a delicious sweet sauce. Their sausage is tasty, and I've never been disappointed with their service both eating there and taking to go. They're not open Monday-Thursday, and if you eat in it's BYOB unless you just want fountain soda."}
{"text":"This is it, this is the place. The best pizza in Phoenix.   That's right, after all this time you finally found it. I had such a tasty, delicious, not stop eating until it's all gone pizza here, and I haven't been disappointed since.   Crispy crust, perfect melted cheese, amazing Italian sausage, and the sauce. oh, that sweet sauce cranks this pizza up to a solid 11 out of 10.   What's more is the service is friendly, attentive, and punctual. They even give you a to-the-minute estimate of when your pizza will be ready if you order take out, which is greatly appreciated for a person on the go.   All around, the best pizza. I lived in both Italy, and now in New York, and I still find myself ranting to my friends about Johnnies pizza in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I discovered Johnnie's Pizza back in the 80's when he was located up the street.I have been a customer ever since.If you are a \"pizza snob\" who only likes deep dish,you won't find it here.The crust is thin and the sauce is sweet just as I like it.I am from Downers Grove,Illinois and it suits me just fine.Johnnie is the friendliest guy and his staff is very welcoming and efficient.I'm not crazy about the soda as it seems flat.I want carbonation.I usually order for carry out as he does not deliver in my area.I love the taste of his pizza and everyone is very nice.Johnnie always remembers my name and it's like \"Cheers\" pizza style there.(Everybody knows your name).I give Johnnie's 4 stars.I just wish he was open more often.Only open Thursday-Sunday."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza! I love that they changed their hours. It always seemed when we wanted to order GOOD pizza they were  closed!  I can't say enough about  their pizza tho! I love that the owner himself answers the phone and takes orders makes it even better! Hard to find a nice mom and pops pizza place these days!"}
{"text":"This pizza is amazing!  I am addicted!  This is worth a trip from anywhere in metro Phoenix.  I have to say that before going in, my expectations were for average pizza - but wow, was I wrong!  This place is a REAL FIND!  I wish they were open for lunch and on more days, but if you're in the mood for pizza on Thursday thru Sunday evenings, GO HERE!  (They open at 3:30p)  We order the Johnnies Deluxe and add jalepenos to give it extra zing!  My mouth is watering already, and it's only Wednesday..."}
{"text":"I think my expectations were too high going into this just based on the Yelp reviews. We ordered a sausage and cheese pizza, well done. We picked it up right when they told us it would be ready and we live less than 1 mile from the restaurant. It wasn't very hot and definitely not well done. I thought about putting it in the toaster over for a few minutes, but I was lazy. I'm also not a fan of the sweet sauce. We would have ordered from Dino's, but they're closed on Sundays. Overall, not worth the calories."}
{"text":"I have been trying to get in here for years but our schedules never agreed, that was until yesterday !! This is hands down THE best pizza I've ever had, my husband took one bite and said \" I guess we don't have to go anywhere else to get pizza from now on!\" Everything about it was perfect, the beautiful thin tatsteful crust, the evenly melted mouth watering cheese, with perefectly placed green peppers and red onions, and to top it off we added pepperoni and their world famous homemade  scrumptous  sausage IT  was divine .. I have to admit I think it tastes even better cold, and I don't eat cold pizza!!!  1000 stars great job in keeping the family tradition alive!!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in here because of the cool retro-looking decor on the outside.  The inside was more of a neighborhood sports team haven than a cute retro diner.  Not a bad thing, just not what we were looking for on a Friday night.  The pizza was good and the ingredients were really fresh, but the pizza was fairly plain.  I like a little garlic and/or italian seasonings.  I had wished they had some beer on tap available because pizza and beer just go well together.  No such luck."}
{"text":"The owner was super nice, great costumer service! The pizza was delicious. I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"This is the best thin crust Chicago style pizza in town. The crust, sauce and sausage is awesome! I have been going here for 30 years and it only gets better every time I have the pleasure to order Jonnie's pizza."}
{"text":"Stopped in today with my children and purchased a medium pizza. They loved challenging each other in basketball while I waited. The owner had a sweet conversation with my little one. Took the pizza home and they ate the whole thing. That rarely happens :)"}
{"text":"Johnnie's makes the best pizza I've had since moving to Phoenix.  I say this as someone biased against thin crust pies.  They have a distinct sauce that helps makes this a memorable pizza.  The decor is Chicago sports and culture centric.  If you're from The Windy City this is a place you need to check out."}
{"text":"This is a great modest neighborhood pizza place. We found the reviews of Johnnies to be accurate. The pizza is yummy, with awesome crust. The employees are thoughtful and have pride in their work and the product they are serving."}
{"text":"I've driven by Johnnie's at least 100 times in my like and never seen it open.  I thought it had been closed down years ago or was a front for another popular Chicago style business.  Last night we were driving by and the lights were on!  Obviously we had to stop and find out what had changed.  We wre informed that this family business is only open Thursday-Sunday nights.  Had I really never driven by during these times?  Pizza was true Chicago thin crust.  Cut in squares with a sweet sauce that hit the spot.  The only thing that could use improvement was the Italian sausage.  It was truly a time warp in there as well.  Felt like we were back home in Wrigleyville, paper plates and all."}
{"text":"Pizza was great and was a good value for the price. The crust is crunchy and the mozzarella is chewy in the way that good pizza should be. We ordered for pickup and the guy on the phone was very friendly. Inside it felt like a classic neighborhood pizzeria, very inviting but no frills. They save the flair for the pizza kitchen and it shows. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Really good pizza - got the thin crust and took other reviewers recommendation and got sausage.  The sausage was superb;  a little spicy and just the right size- not crumbles or large chunks, but nice small pieces.  The sauce was thick and a bit sweet, and best of all, not heavily spiced. I hate it when my pizza sauce is competing with my toppings.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Jus wanna  say !! For get about it ! They do right at this  lil pizza spot ., let me tell ya don't let the hole in the wall location fool ya .,  once in side you are quickly reassured that your in for some good pizza . This is a REAl pizza parlor ! I most say they can hang with my favorite's . There is s reason that the only have one thing on the menu"}
{"text":"One of the best place to get real Chicago pizza. I've tried numerous pizza places since moving to AZ in 1998. Everyone claims to have real Chicago pizza, this place definitely does. Been going here for a few years now. Very welcoming, great Chicago ambiance. They've added hot dogs and beef sandwiches. Super happy!"}
{"text":"I'm new to Phoenix and from Chicago and after a couple of Jonnies recommendations, made my way there! Delicious pizza! There are many pizza places to try here in Phoenix metro but Jonnies makes the best Chicago neighborhood pizza in the valley!! Can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"Being from the Midwest, I've been looking for a pizza place that reminded me of back home and Johnnies was certainly the one! Thin and greasy! My kind of pizza! Will definitely be going back there soon#"}
{"text":"The pizza is sooo good!!! I highly recommend it, take out or dine in. We're very pleased with our experience and the food! Super nice people"}
{"text":"Mmmm... paper thin crust. Love the sausage with light sauce. I will warn you it is not very filling, but mighty tasty. Again, note they are only open Thursday through Sunday. Absolutely delicious pizza! We have ordered from here for  over 15 years. My wife and her family for over 20! As long as Johnnie is around, the quality and taste just can't be beat!"}
{"text":"Everyone is familiar with the the term 'Chicago Style'. The phrase itself is so played out that it pretty much has no meaning. At Johnnie's 'Chicago Style'  means a thin crust pizza with a sweet sauce cut into squares. This is the type of pizza I go for when in Chi-town. If you live within 45 minutes of this place it's worth the journey. The only downside to Johnnie's is that it's only open thursday through sunday after 4. No lunches :("}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this gem tonight. Our first time here and it was AMAZING. The owner John took the time to introduce himself to us and really made us feel welcomed. The customer service and food was excellent. We ordered a half \"volcano\" half cheese pizza and a Chicago hot dog with fries. Zero complaints! Everything was great! We'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"For over 10 years Johnnie Dees has been a family tradition for us. My daughters get to choose any restaurant in the Valley for their birthday dinner. Over ten years now they still choose Johnnie's. My vegetarian daughter will eat the sausage here. It's that good! I am glad to see Johnnie's daughter and son-in-law taking over the place after Johnnie's passing this past year. They have made the place look a little newer, fresh paint, added wings to the menu an are now open 7 days a week.   Try the sausage pizza, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Good tasty pizza, a bit overpriced, but tasty!  The place needs to be updated, specially where the dining room is.  Tear down the wall that separates the dinning room from the kitchen, make it into a sit @ counter situation, fresh coat of paint, take down that pink outdated underwear in the wall and Wallllaaa.  You'll have an Updated Old charmer for years to come.  Nice Family specially the kid named Peter, 3rd generation. You can tell he and his dad care about food and every customer that walks in the door!"}
{"text":"This pizza is the closest pizza that I have found to Chicago pizza! I love the thickness of the crust and the pizzas are exceptional. The only thing I miss about pizza back home is that the sausage and  pepperoni were ground and sprinkled over the top, but that's a personal preference. Two thumbs up John. John is also a warm and welcoming guy! I love supporting small, local businesses. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Chicago family owned business.  Anything on the menu that you like is delicious.  Everything is fresh and made with pride.  Super friendly staff.....asked if I'd like a beverage while I was waiting for my carry out order....no one does that!  This is a must try!"}
{"text":"My new pizza spot. Hands down the best pizza I have had in a long time in Arizona. I still miss Ohio pizza but in AZ this is now my go to!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots in AZ for pizza. It's a great local place that has been around for awhile. The sauce is sweet and the home made sausage daily is incredible. If i ever crave pizza this is my go to!"}
{"text":"I ordered for the first time from Johnny's tonight based on yelp reviews.  The pizzas were awesome, especially Johnny's Deluxe.  Prices aren't cheap, $49 for 2 pizzas but ingredients were fresh and tasted great. We will be back for more."}
{"text":"Best pizza in North Phoenix.  Simple Chicago thin crust pizza.  The sauce is a little sweet and works great on the pizza.  I have only done carry out here but they do have a dining room.  They have recently expanded their hours.  If you like Chicago thin crust pizza, give this place a shot."}
{"text":"Johnnie's Pizza has been around since 1985. First started coming here in the early 90's when Johnnie was still around. No worries. Same great food with his family members taking the wheel and providing high quality product and enthusiasm that would make their father / grandfather proud.  Took my Dad here while he was in PHX on vacation. He grew up in Chi-town and was craving some thin crust Pizza and a Dog. It was fun listening to him comment about all the fun posters and Chicago item that were decorated all over the walls. We must have heard a dozen stories or more about his past and favorite memories around the city.   Ordered the famous Johnnie's Deluxe Pizza and a Chi-Dog and Fries. My Dad really liked the Dog and scarfed it down rather quickly. The Pizza was so good that even my wife from MN got excited. It had the perfect thin crust with their Homemade Sauce, top secret Homemade Italian Sausage, Pepperoni, Green Peppers, Onions, Mushrooms, Black Olives and extra Cheese. So good!  They also have several other Chicago favorites like the Italian Beef Sandwich, Meatball Sandwich, Beef and Sausage Sandwich and yummy Wings.  This is not a fancy franchise restaurant with high end seating and valet parking. Although it was nicely remodeled recently. Just plain good old fashion quality food with some super happy friendly service.  Come on over and give these local guys a visit. Hands down some of the BEST CHICAGO PIZZA in town. TOUCHDOWN BEARS!  4.75 STARS"}
{"text":"They ONLY have a thin crust pizze here and it ain't all that.  You would think if it's the only pizza they make it would be killer, but it's just \"meh\".  The staff is super nice and friendly, which is nice, but unfortunately I can't eat the service.  Don't go here expecting wings/bread sticks/sides, they only do pizza.  I got a side salad and it was basically iceberg lettuce (gross) with the mushrooms/canned olives/green peppers that would go on a pizza. Let's just say it wasn't a very impressive salad.  Don't waste your time here across the street to Belfiore -- they serve up a variety of authentic Italian dishes (way more than one type of pizza, seafood, pasta, and they have a full-service deli as well.)"}
{"text":"I first came here about a month ago or so, we have lived in the area for a few years but for some reason we always settled for Pizza Hut, Dominoes, Sardellas etc. One day after church, I really wanted good pizza and I wasn't willing to settle... I had been to Chicago, IL before, but all we had was Chicago PAN pizza (which was great, just not my type) so I thought that's what \"Chicago pizza\" truly was. As I drove to Johnnies I was just thinking \"eh I won't love it but why not just try it\" ... Man was I wrong. The crust was perfect, crispy, sauce... Oh man, incredible. Truly could of are a whole pizza by myself. My family and I are obsessed. Not too long ago we went and they were closed!!! (Family went on vacation.. Good for them!) So I grabbed my sister and my children and we headed to another pizza place and we almost felt disappointed, not because the pizza was horrible (yes I'm being nice) but because we were really craving Johnnies.Thank goodness they're back, we went and had dinner last night, and this time I brought my mom along. She is a Johnnies lover now well."}
{"text":"Love this Pizza! Great crust and the best Chicago Style hotdog too!"}
{"text":"Very good pizza and service, impressed so i went back the next weekend and ordered 3 more pizzas. Friends liked them too. Favorite so far is the delux and then the pepperoni"}
{"text":"Okay... Been flying past this place next to the Rainbow Cactus and not wanting to stop, but today's the day! Flashy neon sign tells me ... \"GOD LOVES YOU / WHY NOT SHARE A HAPPY HEART? / JESUS IS ALIVE. So I cautiously slide in the front door. Chicago style? I'm thinking deep dish, and my hopes are dashed quickly, and told that theirs is 'thin' crust, bummer. God loves you Jesus is alive Okay I need to loss weight (I'm at 190#) but it was a very tight fit into the horseshoe booth as I burned the roof of my mouth on melting cheese. And boy let me tell you, they put alot of cheese on these pies. But the sauce is a little sweeter than my NYC preference but all-in-all a nice place, they won me over."}
{"text":"Friendly service. Excellent pizza, similar style to Oreganos but without the two hour wait! Wings and salad were standard for a pizza place, nothing to rave about but hit the spot. The restaurant has a great vibe, good for families and small kids."}
{"text":"I guess everyone can tell from my reviews that I love the Pizza here! Part of that is do to growing up. I use to go to a place called Helen's Pizza in Momence Il. It was thin crust square cut pizza with a Pepsi it was so good. It is one on those things that give you warm feeling and safe feeling. The staff are very friendly. All the ingredients are very fresh. You can't compare the Pizza here with other places. The staff cook with there hearts and you can tell it in the quality of the product. They are open 7 days a week Monday Thur Friday 10:30am till 9:00pm for lunch and Saturday and Sunday for Pizza and wings 3:00pm till 9:00pm. I can't say enough about this place. It's not your normal pizza place, everything is great!"}
{"text":"They have delicious sauce, nice people, a nostalgic atmosphere, and tasty meatballs! It's a fun find in Sunnyslope."}
{"text":"Another perfect pepperoni pizza from Johnnie's! They really make it impossible to eat pizza from anywhere else!"}
{"text":"Really good. It's a family treat when we go there! My picky eater kids love it! The sausage is so good. The sauce is sweet and so good."}
{"text":"Had the thin crust deluxe. It was fantastic. Sausage was so good. Definitely worth going to. A 14 inch medium was more than enough for 2."}
{"text":"We have been eating Johnnie's Pizza for almost 30 years. His sauce/cheese flavor profile is still the same and unique in all the pizza I have eaten. We used to get the thick crust when the kids were still at home, but now prefer the thin crust, and I am sure you will ike either one. Johnny is usually there and has never met a customer he didn't like and he has quite a few loyal pie munchers like us, but don't take my word for it, try it, you'll like it. My daughter's in-laws from Columbus have to have Johnnie's with every visit and even when we lived 200 miles away, we always came by for some pie."}
{"text":"Edited March 2, 2014. I was sad To learn that Johnnie passed away last summer. He was a nice guy and earned my  respect as a small businessman. I understand that the family is running the place and they deserve continued success.   Look, this place is weird. They're open really limited hours, Thursday through Sunday only. When you call in a phone order, they want your first and last name, but don't care about your phone number or the name of the person that is going to pick it up. The guy that's obviously in charge, we can assume Johnnie or maybe Dee (but it could be Ralph, as much as everything else makes sense) yells everything. He also gives you a really precise time that your order will be ready, \" THAT'LL BE READY AT 6:48!\".   The pizza is amazing. I get the thin pie, but you can get a thicker crust if you want. They have all of the ingredients that you expect, and they're fresh. What makes it so great is the sauce. It's thin and rich, with a lot of black pepper. It's what you want.  Edited to add that the Pizza I ordered on 10/1/10 was \"ready at 5:51\" . On 11/27, the order went in at 6:28 and the pizza was supposed to be ready at \"6:52\". Today is 4/2 and my Pie will be ready at 8:18!"}
{"text":"People that know my passion for Chicago style pizza always ask me where my favorite thin crust is at.  I no longer need to hesitate with a recommendation.  I had Johnnie's for the first time today and it was off the chart perfect.  I even took home a few half baked ones that I'll freeze and save for another day.   I think his prices were very fair.  In comparison to a Domino's, Papa John's or Little Caesar's, yes this pie is a few bucks more.  But that's where the comparison stops.  Those other pizzas can't hold a candle next to this perfect pie.   Well done John.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Excellent, family-owned and operated restaurant convenient to Moon Valley. Have always received excellent service and great pizza & wings! The pizza sauce is just right and the thin crust is authentic."}
{"text":"Best pizza in AZ. It's not deep dish but it's really good. I order my crust thicker than normal and it's not undercooked. I have never been disappointed by the pizza from this place. Can't imagine how good it would taste right out of the oven.  My only complaints are that this place is only open Thursday to Sunday and it's really far away."}
{"text":"Ok, so on 2/22/2015 I had not tried Johnnies pizza yet. Since then I have had them many times. It is a very good pizza. The initial flavor of the sauce is a bit sweet. I am usually more partial to zesty, but it really is good. I strongly suggest giving it a try."}
{"text":"First things first, the style of this restaurant is super cute. The employees are attentive and professional. The food is super good, I had a meatball sub and salad. Yummy! And was even offered a complimentary scoop of ice cream. Love it, if I lived closer I would definitely visit more!!!"}
{"text":"Love this pizza. The thin crust that is conservative in sauce is fantastic.  If it is warm outside you might want to consider taking it to go.  It seems to get very warm in the restaurant."}
{"text":"This place has the best pizza in Phoenix.  It has authentic Chicago thin crust pizza (yes that is what Chicagoans eat a majority of the time).  The place is so authentic that it feels like I am eating pizza in the basement of my old place back in Chicago ... They even have they same decor!  This is the only place I order pizza from in Phx."}
{"text":"Loved the pizza! Everything from the meat to the cheese  to the vegetables were fresh and delicious! Will definitely be telling my friends and family about this great Chicafo pizza place!"}
{"text":"Best pizza I have had West of Missouri.  Absolutely love this place and the owners are such nice people.  Love supporting local businesses and this place is worth every penny.  So glad I live right down the street.  My entire family loves it!"}
{"text":"This is five star review because of the pizza. The sauce is amazing and the cheese along with sausage and pepperoni are quite delightful. Sausage and sauce are made in house.  Attentive owners along with a friendly staff made for a great visit! The decor would excite any die-hard Chicago sports fan."}
{"text":"Check this out ..been there twice ..my husband and I walk in and he greeted us stating our names. He had two cold mugs for the beverages we brought. He even put the other drinks in the fridge. We were given the remote to watch whatever we wanted. Family owned! Awesome place. The pizza was thin, crispy and delicious!"}
{"text":"Friendly service, good pizza.  All of the employees were busy at work.  They offer pizza, wings and salad - that's it.  When you're good at what you make, you don't need a bunch of things on the menu!  We had the sausage pizza (homemade sausage-yum!).  The sauce is sweet, so you may have to add some spices if that's what you like (they have jars).  Cooked perfectly!  Love supporting local businesses!"}
{"text":"Talk about pizza with character! We came to Johnnie's for dinner and got one extra-large pizza. Their crust was just right, not too thick and doughy like some other places. Best of all was their ultra-specific time at which the pizza would be ready: 6:52 pm. Nice.   The people working there were very friendly. It's definitely not as cheap as some deals you'd find at national pizza chains, but this pizza had so much more flavor and character. Check them out!"}
{"text":"Excellent version of what a thin crust Chicago style pizza is all about. Great cracker type thin crust, robust and flavorful sauce topped with great fresh ingredients. Owner and his family are very friendly and helpful. Don't expect much in terms of ambiance since the pace itself could use a makeover but don't touch the pizza, it's perfect as is!"}
{"text":"Sweet sauce, small pizzas, and way over priced!  We tried this pizza place for the first time about a week ago.  Before I get too negative, the service was great. However, the pizza sauce was sweet (sugary sweet), which is not how we like it.  I could only take 2 bites and could go no further.  I love pizza and can usually get through just about any pizza, but not the sweet sauce here.  Our \"extra large\" pizza was not very big.  The icing on the cake was the price. Our extra large pizza, thin crust, was $29.99 (that is not a typo!). Way overpriced for the pizza you get (even if we had liked the sauce).  We left hungry and feeling like we way overpaid."}
{"text":"Tool home a large sausage pizza from there last night. They make their pizza with a thin style crust and use home made sausage. The people were friendly and actually talked to you while you wait, unlike many other resturants. Only problem was the sause on the pizza was way too sweet. A bit to much sugar was added where I prefer that the tomato sauce be a bit more tangy then sweet. Other than that the pizza was good."}
{"text":"This is a fun local place with real care and love put into each pizza. Fun Chicago memorabilia if you eat there. Good but slightly high priced pizza and wings that are way over priced and not the great."}
{"text":"10 years in the Valley and never made it to this place. Big mistake, the place is a treasure and the food is the best. Yea so OK the place needs a makeover, but come on its a pizza place. Food is top notch, excellent and delicious. Johnnie was there and made me feel right at home, all the staff courteous and helpful. Just a great place. Anybody can make a pizza for $5.99 or $6.99 but not a quality pizza like this, yea it cost a little more but well worth the price."}
{"text":"Best Chicago style pizza in Arizona...This Place is true Chicago and Johnny, the owner, is always incredibly nice. It is simply best Chicago pizza and not a chain."}
{"text":"For thin crust pizza Johnnies is the way to go. I am not a fan of thick crust, but can eat it if the pizza is absolutely awesome. I am not impressed with most pizza places out here, so when my honey introduced me to Johnnie's thin crust pizza it has become one of my faves."}
{"text":"This was my husband and I's first time going there. Very friendly staff. loved all the Chicago memorabilia on the wall including the street signs with well known Chicago Streets. I don't know if I would go back for the pizza the sauce was a little too sweet for me. pizza slices cut in squares this does remind me of Chicago Pizza. I will be back to try the Italian beef and sausage combo and Chicago-style hot dog."}
{"text":"It was like I tripped over a crack in the sidewalk, stumbled into a time warp, and emerged in suburban Chicago in 1985, when I still knew all the words to the Super Bowl Shuffle by heart.   Hard. Core. Chicago. This does not mean the pizza is, per se, good. It will probably come across repellent to those who think Uno's is all Chicago pizza represents. To the Chosen, though, it is excellent - sweet sauce, gooey cheese, thin-yet-chewy crust, all cut into the requisite squares, and infinitely better as leftovers the next day.  Oh, and a little secret: BYOB."}
{"text":"BEST PIZZA, hands down. Seriously. If you're debating trying it, do yourself a favor and get in here. The service is phenomenal every time. It's like going to your friend's house for dinner - the fun friend with the cool parents. Just trust me. There's nothing like it!"}
{"text":"First i would like to state, I signed up to yelp to put feedback about this place. Can you say amazing? i would like to say i'm one of the pickiest eaters(especially pizza) that crap dominos or pizza hut just won't cut it for me. If u like Real authentic \"Chicago\" style pizza go here. i believe that most of these crock so-called \"Chicago Style\" places are just that, crocks. Great Service, ambience is great a bunch of chicago themed sports teams all over the place and just SPECTACULAR pizza. The best pizza for everyone that i recommend here is Sausage and Green Pepper on their world famous \"medium crust\" with extra sauce. The owner johnnie is a stand up man and literally always treats you like family.  There is only one downfall about this place and its' that they're only open on Thurs-Sundays. This place is great i sincerly recommend EVERYONE to try this, it is definately one of these places that will become your usual pizza spots."}
{"text":"The combination of the sweet homemade sauce, freshly made sausage and fresh cheese is outstanding. If you are craving a sweeter pizza I recommend Johnnies."}
{"text":"I've lived in the area for years and always drove past on the way to other pizza joints. I should have been going to Johnnie's the entire time.   The pizza here is excellent, and the service is good as well. Prices are a little on the high side, but the pizza is good enough to justify it."}
{"text":"My husband and returned to Phoenix last week after 21 years. When we lived in Phoenix we would eat at Johnnie's at least once a week. It was our favorite pizza stop. It was such a pleasure to return and experience the same delicious pizza and the same decor. The pizza is a thin crust, the sauce is incredible, and the pizza is still made perfectly. Johnnie's Grandson took our order and made us feel so very welcome during our entire dinner. I wish this place was in North Carolina. The next time we visit Phoenix, we will definitely be looking forward to dinner at Johnnie's."}
{"text":"Great Chicago-style pizza with great customer service. The cheese, crust, and sausage were amazing. They don't sell beer but allow you to bring your own. They brought us cold mugs for our beer. The decor was dated and lacking."}
{"text":"Great service and it was heartwarming to see his son working with him!  I'll definitely be back! Great pizza and wings!"}
{"text":"Amazing. This is a little bit of Chicago in the valley. I am always on the look out for authentic Chicago style pizza and Johnnie's delivered a great experience. Everyone was super friendly. Pizza was heavenly- sweet sauce, square cut, crispy thin crust. Will absolutely be back soon- have to try the sausage next time!"}
{"text":"When I moved back to Phoenix I was hoping that Johnnie's would still be around. Imagine my happiness to discover, yes they were still open and making amazing thin style pizza. The staff is family and treat you as such. The sausage and red onion is the best around. If given the chance defiantly visit Johnnie's, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Eaten here 2x and the first time I was mildly disappointed as the pizza I ordered fell way short on toppings.  As a business owner,.... I always want to ensure that if a merchant loses my business they know why.  In this instance they were quick to acknowledge the gaff and insisted that if I gave them another shot they would not only do it right but offer me a discount on top.  Today I took them up on the offer and the pizza was spectacular!  I also had the opportunity to meet Johnnie and his son ( love family owned businesses ) and they were both extremely cordial and accommodating.  This is how business is done ladies & gentleman.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My husband just got home from Chicago and wanted to go here for Father's Day. We have driven by it countless times but it has never been open. Turns out it is only open from 3:30-9 Thursday through Monday. So we came, and we came for the pizza. Because that is all they have on the menu (no wings, garlic bread, mozzarella sticks, nothing). Pizza is what they do best, and it is all they do. And they do it well. The cheese was so delicious and tasted high quality. We had the standard crust (thin) on one Hawaiian pizza (loved!!!) and the medium thick crust on the Johnnie's Deluxe (also loved!!). Sausage was awesome. The decor was completely lacking, but like I said...you come here for the pizza, not to be wined and dined."}
{"text":"We'll it finally happened.  The planets aligned, the stars converged, and the heavens cast forth a light that led us to the door of Johnnie's Pizza.  Yes friends, I was able to actually get in and try this place out.  After 10 years of waiting; and was it worth it???   eh...  Yeah I guess it was.  I'm not sure it was worth $30 for two small pizzas, but it was fine. It is not the greatest pizza I have ever had in my life, but it was very nice.  I like thin crust and the Chicago style is a nice change of pace.  If you are from the midwest it is very close to a pizza chain called Valentino's.  Sweet sauce and light on the toppings.  They do not offer a ton of choices and the place looks like a throwback to a 60's diner in Chi-town, but hey, at least I can cross this one off my list."}
{"text":"We tried the large deluxe for carryout.  I wish I had only ordered a small.  The service was very friendly. The cheese and toppings were all good, but the sauce ruined it completely, it is about 4 times sweeter than catsup.  The crust was very thin which I like but it was soggy, which I don't like.    The slices were not cut cleanly we had to re slice all of it.  The two stars are for the friendly service and decent toppings.  I really wanted to like this place.....but the sauce ruins the pie.  We wont be back.  Bummer."}
{"text":"How have I not tried this place until now?!?!! It's absolutely amazing! Took the kids and we ordered the Hawaiian, we couldn't stop eating until our large pizza was completely destroyed. This is a must if you are in the Phoenix area, simply the best pizza I have ever had. And of course they brought us out some ice cream, free of charge..."}
{"text":"Alright, so let me start with saying that the service was pretty good (I mean, you order and a window and they bring you food). The people were all quite nice. But man, what a bummer.  I drove by this place Saturday and got really excited because it looked like a hole-in-the-wall place that would have fantastic pizza. After striking out at another pizza place, we decided to give this place a go. The giant lighted sign that professed god loves me was a little off-putting but we decided to go in anyway so we stepped up to the counter and ordered a cheese.   Now, Chicago Style pizza is generally deep dish. I worked in a Chicago style pizza place for 2 years and our default was a pillowy thick crust with thin crust available on request. Given that this is the general understand of Chicago pizza, I feel like the girl at the counter should have let us know it was thin crust (or I could have read the menu closer). But alas, our pizza came out and it was a slightly under-done cracker thin crust. Ok, I normally prefer thin crust so I'll get over it. BUT the biggest problem was the sweetness of the sauce. This pizza was described as a squishy cracker with ketchup and cheese by someone with me. I really wanted this place to be some amazing find that I would love forever but alas my search continues.   Oh, I ordered a dinner salad too. Your options are boring ranch or boring Italian. It was pretty standard bagged lettuce, too many black olives, and shredded mozzarella.  The only decent thing I can say about this pizza is that it was ok as left-overs the next day...slathered in siracha or chiptole tabasco.  So, if you're into sweet sauce and thin crust pizza, this is your place.  If you're looking for decadent deep dish Chicago style pizza, keep looking because you won't find it here.      If you want to leave a tip for the staff, bring cash. Their credit card merchant doesn't allow for tips on cards. Weird."}
{"text":"Another 5 star review from me - but no surprise here. We were heartbroken to hear about the sad news this summer but incredibly happy Johnnie's reopened. We've been regulars for over 6 years now. Favorite pizza place ever. You guys are the best.   Awesome thin crust pizza with a great tangy, sweet sauce.  We love the veggie version: olives, mushrooms, onions, green pepper, and sometimes we also add pepperoncini to half. They have really good side salads too. Lots of toppings and we sometime refer to them as our cheese salads for the extra helping of our favorite topping they give us."}
{"text":"My family and I have been going here for over 25 years.  They have the best pies ever!  (Miss you Johnnie)"}
{"text":"What a shame. This place has great pizza but the guy who took my order over the phone was so incredibly rude. Good pizza is not worth bad customer service."}
{"text":"Went here tonight for dinner. Great pizza, friendly service, and will be back for sure. I would suggest to put a tad more seasoning in the sauce. Husband is from Chicago and I have family back there."}
{"text":"my wife and i went there last week. it was good. great  chicago decor. pizza was good. we just happen to go there when there was birthday party for a kid. a lot of kids running around."}
{"text":"This place is by far best around for thin crust pizza. All ingredients are fresh, and homemade.  The owner is a great guy, while I waited for my order he sat and talked with me and gave me a soda on the house. Place was just remodeled so very clean. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I found this glorious pizza parlor as I was on a road trip. The pizza was the best I've ever had--and I've had a lot of pizza in my lifetime. Best part; they have gluten-free crust!!! So good. So worth it."}
{"text":"Wow! Best Chicago style pizza in town!  Reminded me of home!  (And yes I AM from Chicago!)"}
{"text":"We are constantly on the quest for pizza that is not from Papa Barfs, Domino's and Pizza Hut.  Why bother when there are some many better options throughout the valley.  We tried out Johnnie's recently and liked it a lot.  We had the peperoni Joannie style (this is the middle crust, not the thin and not the thickest).  It was pretty darn good.  The sauce is a bit sweeter than what I like but I still enjoyed it.  It was quick and it is convenient for our location.  The gal who answered the phone and took our order was really nice, she called me \"Honey\" and I liked that b/c I could tell she was older than me and that is the only time I like being called \"honey\" unless from my husband... or a gay man."}
{"text":"Trying all the top Yelp Pizza places. The Pizza was delicious and the service was perfect. The gentleman who greeted us was the Grandson and the lovely young lady kept coming to see if we needed anything and then offered us a complimentary Spinoni ice cream. Definitely worth the drive and we will be back"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza and atmosphere!  True family run pizzeria. Best pizza ever and the family is wonderful!"}
{"text":"I love Chicago pizzeria and this place has a very good Chicago pizza. Pizza crust is nice and crispy. Very good amount of cheese. The staff is friendly. The place looks clean and organized. Definitely I will comeback for another slice."}
{"text":"Was excited thought we finally found good local pizza...soo dissapointed. Service was great but we ran home to  try the pizza and looked great love thin crust but was not crispy and taste was ok.was good sauce but no flavor to crust and was almist like frozen pizza crust..."}
{"text":"Nice family place with limited operational hours (evenings on Friday, Saturday, Sunday only). Chicago theme on the inside is cozy, with plenty of Bears, Bulls, & Cubs posters. Very modest atmosphere, perhaps dated, but cozy nonetheless and a place that is suitable for bring the entire family. Seems to be a small, local family-owned business as well.  Thin crust is like a thick cracker - flour bottom, crispy, yet still somewhat chewy. Sweet & tangy tomato sauce seems to draw people as well, as many of us from Illinois are familiar with the thin crust & extra sweet tangy sauce formula for pizza.  As of winter 2008, the menu consisted of pizza, a calzone like \"pizzoli\", and salads. No subs, eggplant, chicken, etc. that is mentioned in the Web Review."}
{"text":"Hands down, this is the best pizza in town. We are so glad that they reopened. Since me fiancée took me there the first time approx. 1.5y ago, I have been in love with their pizza. Thanks for making our pizza night special every week!"}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out after driving past a million times based on the Yelp reviews.  My boyfriend and I called in our order for a pizza and chatted with the owner when we got there.  We both agreed as we were walking to the car it was a great spot - before we even took a bite!  We got home and dug into our large pepperoni, sausage, mushroom and jalapeno pizza and it was love at first bite.  Hands down my new favorite pizza spot.  We couldn't stop talking about it last night and even again this morning.  Great thin crispy crust, delicious house made sausage, super flavorful sauce.  I wouldn't change a thing inside the restaurant.  They've been in business for over 30 years and the place shows it but I actually think it adds to the charm!  Can't wait to go back and so happy to have a new go to place.  Thanks Johnnie!"}
