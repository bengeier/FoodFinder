{"text":"Very unique Mexican joint. I have really fallen in love with the veggie fajitas but even more so the atmosphere. Great drink specials all day long and I've never had to wait for a table even though they can sometimes get packed. I also rate the chips and salsa at all Mexican restaurants and this place is bomb diggity."}
{"text":"I am really picky when it comes to good chips and salsa and at Serranos, they have the best in my humble opinion. Well priced with quick service, it is one of my favorite places to go!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, love the service the host wears to much cologne which made my allergies act up but besides that excellent place."}
{"text":"When my wife gets nostalgic for those good ol' high school days, she always mentions that Serrano's was a frequent hang out with friends. She recalls the great bean dip and the tasty enchiladas as her meal of choice. Well, after the eventual buildup of wonderful Mexican food, it really is a disappointment to find such memories are best left in the past.

My wife and I went to dinner here when we first moved down to the Tempe area. It was a week day during the lunch hours. It's a dark lit restaurant for \"cosy\" evenings (as one of my fellow reviewers mentions). No complaints on the service side of things, but no standouts either. When service is just fine, I typically don't come back because I know there might be something better on the other side of town. 

When it comes to the food, I'll give some credit to the bean dip. However, seeing as an appetizer was the most enjoyable item eaten that night, you won't hear another compliment from me. The food I had heard so much about was bland, boring and down right meh. Don't expect to see me hanging around this restaurant as I'll be spending my money on good Mexican food."}
{"text":"Heads up....automatic gratituity for a large party.  We had a party of 8 and the service was so incredibly inattentive and slow.  We couldn't get drink refills, chip refills, etc......it was as if we our table was invisible.  Maybe the fact that they knew they were getting a tip excused them from actually serving us?  Not sure we will be going back."}
{"text":"Had my I.D checked twice, then had to sign a book . My chips were never refilled I had to ask. The hostess is old as a dinosaur and gave me a hard time when I asked to sit in the lounge with my child. Service used to be great, but it has really gone down hill. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Best bean dip I've ever had and the chicken chimis are great.  Service is good and the chips are always refilled!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry, but those of you who have given Serrano's  a good review never had really great authentic Mexican food. I've tried this place a couple times, only because it is close to my house. Each time I am hopeful it will get better. Each time it disappoints more than the previous. 
Save your money."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food on the go.... And I'm always treated like a friend not a customer when I come thru!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant! It really is nice to look at and the food is great. My friends and I have stopped in just to chat and soak up up the atmosphere over some chips and shirley temples!"}
{"text":"This place used to be one of my favorite Mexican restaurants but not anymore!  While the service is still friendly and attentive, the food is not as good as it used to be.  Plus, the prices went waaaaay up, sometimes up to $5 more.  Seriously, $10 for eggs and chorizo?  Nope!"}
{"text":"awesome food.....found this place while vising from the far west valley will definetly be back worth the drive homemade chips and the bean dip was great thanks again."}
{"text":"Took the girl out for date night and I must say this place is top notch. Food was delicious, no mistakes. Waitress was a delight and kept our beverages filled. It was slower than expected for a Sat night but that didn't stop them from doing a fantastic job. Servings were large but we still splurged for a dessert, chocolate tortuga was spectacular."}
{"text":"Literally my favorite Mexican restaurant ever! Such a great atmosphere, the food is amazing and staff is always kind. On occasion things will be a little slow but thats only because 90% of the time they are PACKED. Even the kids menu has tons of good options, picky eaters included.

I always get the same order: two item, two chicken tacos (no lettuce or tomato) rice and beans, and I have never been disappointed. 

I do wish that they offered regular sour cream for no additional cost, but I don't mind bringing my own. Keep up the good work Serrano's!!"}
{"text":"Really nice local restaurant.  Love their bean dip.  They have an awesome bar too.  I rate their salsa a 4 out of 5.  Stopping by today after the ASU game.  Go devils!!!"}
{"text":"We love Serrano's. Even had them cater our wedding.  We were regulars @ the Dobson location before it closed.

Really not a fan of this location.  Service is poor.

Today my mother and I tried to walk in with the remnants of our coffees and before we were even all the way in the door were told by two employees that we'd have to leave our drinks at the front. Rude.
We left and spent our $40 @ Valle Luna. It was delicious!"}
{"text":"Very good portions!! The food spilleth over my plate and I was glad. The service was good. Hostess, Server and staff were attentive and friendly. The food was over-salted for my taste but was still tasty. 

For all ethnic food restaurants, I like to see how many ethnic people of that origin actually go there. For Indian restaurants, I look for Indian patrons, Italian, Japanese, etc. For a Mexican food restaurant, Serrano's had zero Mexicans dining when I went. It's only an observation I made."}
{"text":"After our first visit (dinner on a Thursday evening):

3 stars for the food. We got shrimp enchiladas for 2. There was plenty of food and the shrimp was higher quality than the standard tiny-and-too-hard-to-chew of AZ Mexican restaurants. The price was good because we got the combo for two instead of two separate meals ($21). 

4 stars for customer service. Our waiter was nice but it was really the manager that made the experience great. She continually circulated, always smiling, and filled in the service gaps smoothly (filling up a water glass, getting a bag for our to-go boxes). 

3.5 stars for ambiance. The booth was nice and private and it was pretty mellow but got a little noisy toward the end of the meal as more big parties showed up."}
{"text":"Ehhh.....it was ok. Quesadilla was ok......Carne Asada burrito my daughter had was down right aweful. Queso dip was good. I doubt I'll be back. GREAT service tho, very attentive and polite waitress."}
{"text":"What can I say?  I love this place!

All the food is wonderful and the staff is very attentive.

The salsa is very good as is the hot sauce and bean dip that come standard with your chips.  How can you not love that?

It is pretty standard fare with a few twists but it is all done very well and with careful attention to quality and detail.

I go every week and will continue to do so....

Plus....in this day and age, they close on Sunday's to give their employees a day for religious observance. I'm not remotely religious but appreciate a business that gives thought to their employees even if it cost them $$.  

Of course, I do like Mexican food on Sundays so.....that's problematic... ;)"}
{"text":"I was a customer for over 20 years until December 9th. They refused to seat me and my family in the restaurant. They are more concerned about taking your money for alcohol than a family restaurant like they used to be. Very disappointing"}
{"text":"Been here several times, food is always good, services is sometimes slow but very friendly, and it's in my hood. So, not sure why it's not my go to place for Mexican food. Definitely need to move them higher up in the rotation, especially since I love, love, love their beef machaca.

I also recently discovered that they have a margarita cupcake. It's a vanilla cupcake infused with tequila and lime, topped with lime cream cheese frosting, and garnished with lime zest and salt. Heaven!"}
{"text":"I was not impressed with this place. Host seemed inexperienced. Water and tea has a musty taste. Salsa was too chunky. Waited a long time for check. I had a taco salad with beef asada. The beef had good flavor. The staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Blech. Just blech. I guess all good things have to come to an end...not sure why since this place always had such great food. When we ate there ten, twenty years ago the place was always so crowded that lines formed to get inside. The food was always fresh and delicious and when you left you walked away with a full belly and a happy smile on your face. Even five or so years ago the food was good...but tonight we got take out...now I know take it is not a good as eating it fresh  in the restaurant, but we live ten minutes away from this place. Hubby got steak and chicken fajitas and they looked like they had been sitting around all day. He said the veggies were so greasy he couldn't eat them. My meal earned the real blech. Greasy, greasy. The guacamole was greasy and had an odd taste. Not sure what has happened but I guess that the magic is gone and the food tasted like it had been previously cooked and warmed up. I'm sure it was all made fresh today it just didn't taste that way. A TV dinner would have tasted fresher. 

Now, sadly we cross off yet another Mexican restaurant here in Tempe. No one near us knows how to cook fajitas. We have to go to Jalapeño's Inferno up in Scottsdale to get them. They have awesome food, great chips and salsa and the best margaritas around. Unfortunately it is about an hour drive from our house.

Wish I had better news for you people craving some good Mexican food. My husband said there was not a soul in the place tonight save for one other person who was waiting for their takeout order. We did order late so they might have been getting ready to close. The food sure tasted like left-overs. That is no excuse. Drive down the street and Panda Express keeps bringing out fresh trays up until the doors are locked.
Guess I need to sharpen my chopsticks. 

At this rate, another valley landmark might soon be going away. The Mesa Serrano's on Dobson and Guadalupe shuttered its doors. We ate there and the food went downhill too. When it opened it had the most amazing food and service. This makes us old-times sad. We remember how great both locations were and we miss the good meals we ate there.

I didn't bother to call and tell them how lousy their food was since they probably would have offered us a free next time meal. I think not. We do not plan to return to this restaurant...at least not in this lifetime. Mediocre food...I can cook that at home!"}
{"text":"i have been dining with all the valley serranos since 1986.  consistently good food, excellent service, fantastic chips,  bean dip is presented to every table, hot sauce to die for.  fluffy rice, flavorful meats, sauces and cheeses.  excellent.  it is a family place...so not right for a sexy sophisticated evening, but it is always clean, consistent, and just plain good."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Bad food.  Empty drink forever. Never checked on. Won't be back to this one. My daughter didn't get her food even started until we got ours. Everything was over cooked, from the chips and all the food. I"}
{"text":"I have to disagree with the previous comments. While the bean dip with the chip is a good option, the food is below par and the prices are way too high. The tacos I got literally looked like the ones at Jack in the Box. And slip a brew or two into your experience and you're looking at over $20. The service was ok, but the food just really isnt that great imho, and i've been there a couple times."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite mexican food place in the world. The bean dip is, of course, awesome. You gotta make sure you don't get full on the bean dip because they'll just keep filling it up and bringing out fresh chips! I alternate between the machaca quesadilla and the carne asada chimi, and although I don't venture out much beyond that, my family enjoys the machaca tacos, the chicken enchiladas, and the green chile burro. Oh, and I really like the salsa - great taste, great hotness level. I'm getting hungry just thinking about this place."}
{"text":"Not a good experience with management. Had an issue with being upcharged for me dinner when I had expressed not wanting to pay for extras. Manager made me feel like she was doing me a one time favor. Felt she was reluctant to comp my upcharge.  Could have been avoided all together if the serving staff knew the menu better."}
{"text":"Foods just not the same. They changed there red chili and it's nothing like it was. Was recently there for lunch and our waitress was the rudest person. Sound like the family needs to reevaluate what made them who they are."}
{"text":"Serrano's is one of the most amazing mexican restaurants i have ever been to. The food is great, super tasty. There is always a constant supply of chips salsa and bean sauce at every table. But what really made my experience here awesome was the exceptional service. All of the staff are efficient, fast, and super super super friendly. There is always someone ready to help. Kudos to all of the employees!"}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time, as I grew up in the area and always stopped in for the free chips and salsa as a teenager.  I moved back to the area and brought my bf and he was pretty skeptical until he was greeted by the host.   The host was amazing, very friendly and welcoming and funny!  We made the mistake in sitting in the cantina though.  That's apparently where all the staff congregates to talk about personal situations and after hearing about how homosexuals lose, a girl went to a friend's house for a \"quickie,\" the bartender thinking he's the fonz of serranos, i almost never want to go back.  The bartender alone was reason enough for this review.  The worst human I've encountered in at least 3 years.  Offensive, tacky, and unprofessional.  From now on, always go through the dining area or your dinner experience will be ruined."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick dinner. My experience have always been different depending on who our server is. Overall we keep coming back. 

The food has always been good and consistent for us, a major reason why we keep coming back. There's also always lots of seating and we have never had to wait for a table."}
{"text":"My family and I used to love this place. My folks turned me on to them years back. The last time we were there was a couple of years ago, horrible service followed by undercooked food.
The family and I decided to give them another chance. We went there earlier this evening hoping things have improved.
Not in the least, we started out with a cheese crisp(appetizer), it was no where near crisp. The tortilla was chewy and the cheese was barely melted. I asked for another one, it came about 20 minutes later but was burnt to a crisp. My kids who normally devour these things, had no desire to eat it. On top of that my wife ordered a combo plate, her meal was undercooked as well, not even worth taking it home.
The bottom line is: They lost business of a family who enjoys dinning out quite a bit.
What happened Serranos, so sad."}
{"text":"We have been patrons of Serranos for quite awhile now. We really love the food there. Tonight my mom, 3 year old son and I went to Serranos on Rural in Tempe. My son is particular about his food as he is 3. We've gotten him a cheeseburger from Serranos before but he didn't like it and he does not like Mexican food yet. Anyhow, we came all the way from South Phoenix to eat at Serranos in Tempe. We bought my son a cheeseburger from Burger King. As we were walking into the restaurant the Manager tonight said to us right away that he was sorry, but we could not come inside to eat with outside food. We have done this before and there was never a problem there. I told him that in the past we got my son a cheeseburger from Serranos, but he didn't like it and he does not like Mexican food yet. He said that it was the policy of Serranos not to allow outside food and that he would take my sons cheeseburger and put it somewhere in the kitchen. I told him \"If you do that he will cry and throw a fit\" The Manager would not budge and said that was the policy of Serranos. I understand why there are policies for this, but my son is only 3 years old and it was a cheeseburger. I told the Manager that my mom and I had every intention of eating there as well. The Manager would not budge. My mom and I left feeling very disappointed. I did not feel it right that my sons food would get taken away and have him cry for his cheeseburger and honestly he would do this,  and then to sit and watch us eat? no way.  So my mom and I left and ate somewhere else. I feel that, yes I understand these policies, but in some instances could the manager understand? could he bend a rule for a 3 year old? When my family from Oregon came down we took them to Serranos and they licked their lips. I mention Serranos to all of my co-workers. I tell everyone how good the food is and how good the bean dip is. I felt very disappointed in the customer service of the Manager. He is very good at following policies and rules, but in the end what about seeing a situation for what it is and think that not every situation and customer will fit in the same mold? I left feeling that perhaps Serranos is not a family restaurant he was just so business like and policy and procedure. I am from Phoenix, born and bred, I feel proud to take my friends and family to Serranos because it is a tried and true Arizona establishment. But, please understand my point of view, we were not trying to be cheap, we wanted some great Mexican food and make sure my son enjoyed his dinner too. The food is great, but customer service is blech,"}
{"text":"We used to love Serrano's. It was definitely our go to Mexican Restaurant. However, the last several times we went, the service was poor. It appeared as if they needed more servers. Our waiter was slow (or too busy) to attend to our table.  
The food is good. The salsa is great and it's nice to get the bean dip as well. Overall, I would still recommend it if you're not in a hurry."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if they changed something after reading horrible reviews, but it's a WHOLE lot different than when I was in there before.  Food was actually really good as was our waiter \"Omar\".  The fundito was really good...chicken was SUPER moist!  Fajitas were a bit on the veggie side (a LOT more veggies than steak), but still good too!"}
{"text":"Serrano's is on of my most favorite restaurants of all time.  I go at least once a week.   Chips and Salsa are Great! As well as the service and food.  I would suggest sitting in the lounge/bar area. It's nice and quiet and the servers are fabulous."}
{"text":"My buddies and I get together for Sunday lunch, and we've eaten at Serrano's more than we should. As most Italian food joints fill you with bread, Serrano's fills you with their addictive, creamy refried bean dip and chips.  If' you're feeling cheap, order a bowl of pozole (pretty tasty) and then get your fill on the chips and dips. If you're just ordering a burrito and a soda, you might get out under 10 bucks.Their grilled meat dishes are the best things on the menu, but, of course, also the most expensive. The margaritas are delicious (though I'm pretty easy to please here) . 

My only complaint (and this mostly applies to the Dobson/Guadalupe location) is the service. It is generally slow, and groups seem the intimidate the 16 year-old servers working here. The Rural location has better service, however, and a nicer bar."}
{"text":"We usually go to their location in Chandler. Always great food. Since we live in Tempe, decided to try this location out. Really was not happy with the food at all. Services and staff were nice. When lunch is over remove lunch special sign from up front if you dont want people to ask about it. Chips were stale and burnt. We ask for another bowl and they too were the same. The plate I get has an enchilada on it. Enchilada was dry and the cheese inside of it was just a big clump of dried cheese. Almost like  they prepared it and it sat under a heat lamp. Cook should have pride in his food he sends out to customers. This time i think he was sleeping or really didnt care. Compared to other Mexican restaurants we normally visit in the area, this restaurant seems to be be a bit pricey for the food we ordered. Probably wont return to this location and would not recommend. Owners need to visit and quality check this location. Their food at the Chandler location seems to be much better. If i could leave no stars i would, but you have to do at least one."}
{"text":"bartender was awesome. She took good care of me and the food was excellent. I am on a low carb diet and she ordered my meal just the way I wanted it without any issues. I would return here again."}
{"text":"We were looking for authentic Mexican food and this place had great reviews. Most other restaurants on a weeknight closed at 9p but Serrano's closed at 10p which worked out for us. 

They bring your homemade chips & salsa (3 different kinds) to start off, while you look over the menu. There's a fair amount of options. They even have combinations where you can mix&match tacos/enchiladas and/or flautas. Most items cost about $10-12.

We asked for a spicy salsa and make the mistake of dipping too much. Our mouths were on fire! 

The service was fast and the waitress was really professional, courteous and smiley. 

Overall, it was a good dining experience."}
{"text":"Not very good, definitely not authentic and the staff was not professional. Almost like they didn't know they were at work while they spoke to one another in the dining room"}
{"text":"Had lunch at this place today and it did not disappoint.  My family and I have been coming here for years and it is still so good. The staff is always friendly and manager walked around and asked us how we were and how the food was. Always a plus. Our server, Troy, was friendly and very attentive. Even the hostess is sweet. The food is traditional,  in my opinion, and basic mexican food. The atmosphere is comfy and casual and I love it when I am able to eat comfortably and talk. Always a pleasure.
They also give a discount if u show them your AAA card!"}
{"text":"This is a sorry excuse for a Mexican restaurant. The food is bland. The service is slow. The only thing it has going for them is the warm chips and chunky salsa they serve each table. 

I ordered a pork enchilada with rice and beans. The entire plate was tasteless. Who messes up making rice & beans? Well, Serrano's does. I tried adding the salsa to my plate. Ya, that didn't help. 

My son ordered the shredded pork burrito. It was made with a whole lot of shredded lettuce and salsa with a few strings of meat. It was watery and the tortilla was soggy. Very unappealing. 

We were finally asked by our waitress if everything was ok. She asked if I wanted a box. Hell no, I wouldn't feed this food to my dog. She sent someone over who I assume was the manager, she asked if there was a problem. Yes, there is. My food was terrible. She took the plate away without a word and never said anything else to me. Not so nice. 

Needless to say, we won't ever be coming back here and I would strongly advise you, do not waste your money."}
{"text":"After living in Boston for a long time, the land of the worst Mexican food ever, I yearn...YEARN...for good Mexican food on a consistent basis now that I'm back in the Southwest. Serranos, though not the ultimate foodie experience as it tends very traditional, is delicious. Free bean dip, chips and salsa are an easy way to my heart, but followed by enchiladas or a burrito fundido style with a house margarita...Yes, please! I've always had really great service at this location even when they were swamped. Plus...there's always the bean dip to tide you over till you order."}
{"text":"This place is actually a pretty decent spot.  The vibe is welcoming, the hostess welcoming, and the food is great! 

The only reason why this place is getting a 1 star is due to its business practices.  When we asked for our check tammy the waitress took our card.  She then charged our card for $96 dollars but came back with a receipt saying that she charged $80. Tammy was trying to hustle and swindle us for extra money.  We caught the overcharge by checking online on our phones.  Immediately we asked to see a manager and Tammy ignored our request.   Instead she fixed the receipt herself and admitted to messing WITH the price on the receipt.  

To make matters worse while she was in the kitchen at the POS station Tammy was yelling profanities about our table and the kitchen staff.  After everything got situated Tammy took our check and began to make profanity laced sarcastic comments as she walked backed into the kitchen.  If you do eat hear and pay with a card make sure you check your receipts especially if TAMMY serves you or else money will be stolen right from under your nose.

Management please work with your staff.  What Tammy did tonight at our table was highly illegal.  Legal action will be taken if not addressed or ignored."}
{"text":"I wanted to try Serrano's because I have been told they are great?  I went and sat at the bar and ordered the food came out fast was good but service was ok not the best?  There was a weird homeless guy at the bar deffinetely a turn off but he didnt seem homeless until he asked me about cheap motels in the area?  I noticed the no firearms sign outside WILL NOT BE Back.  Signs dont stop criminals it just stops Law biding citizens from going into your establishment good luck."}
{"text":"I'd say pretty average Mexican food. You do get bean dip with the classic chips and salsa. We had a brand new waitress, so service was pretty slow and our bills were wrong. Overall, meh. I probably wouldn't rush back to this place if I find myself in AZ again."}
{"text":"i'd rather go to amado's!

the only thing that's good here is the bean dip, and i'm only saying that so that i have something nice to say."}
{"text":"After reading several reviews of terrible service I figured I should do my due diligence in adding mine to the list. A bit dated but better late than never. A year and a half ago I vowed to never go back and have held true to the promise. At the time my son was 2, and since we live down the street we would walk down for appetizers or dinner every few weeks, usually  sitting in the lounge due to faster service and having a noisy toddler in tow. This last time he fell asleep on the walk over and upon entering the lounge we were asked to leave. Upon asking why I was told no children were allowed in the lounge. (There were 4 or 5 other kids with families in the lounge at the time.) When asking what had changed and why other children were allowed we were told only sleeping \"babies\" were not allowed because if they wake and cry it will disturb the patrons. I then asked if it would be different if he was awake and they stumbled over their words. Infuriated and embarrassed due to the discrimination we left. I hope this helps bring light to management over the poor and unfair treatment the staff applies to customers. Waiting for them to go out of business so I can frequent a replacement establishment."}
{"text":"We came during a pretty busy dinner hour, took us about 5 mins to be seated and the host was very, very nice. The chips, salsa and bean dip were delicious. Our waitress Bonnie was awesome, I would go back just for the great service. The food though was very good, I had a combination plate with a cheese enchilada, beef taco, tostada and a side of guacamole. I have no complaints, they were even great to my kids who were a bit cranky!"}
{"text":"This place needs a remodel in a bad way! Smells of old grease. Food is always hit n miss. Service really sucks at this location too. We will no longer frequent this location & stick with the original Chandler location."}
{"text":"First time back to Serrano's in several years.  Not a good experience...food took about 40 minutes...one person in our group could not eat it because of too much spice.  Server told us that the slow service was because they only have a small grill in the kitchen and one of our group (me) ordered a plate with a chicken breast which takes extra time.  Finally, the \"credit card system\" was down.  Overall, food was just okay...Nando's is a much better choice in my opinion.  I think it may be a couple more years before we return to Serrano's if at all."}
{"text":"We have always like this location. It has always had pretty good food. But, we came here last night for dinner. I was very disappointed.
I understand that the staff is short , they are looking to hire. AS always the Busers are great. Water, chips , salsa, etc. Brought us to go boxes.
But, our service was not good at all. The food was dry as if it had been in the oven and left for a while.
The server walked by our table 3 times and still he did not pick up the check. We had to go to the counter where the host said the server had to ring it up.
The bean dip and salsa are amazing. But, now for the food and service. I say we probably will not be back."}
{"text":"Loved the mexican pizza."}
{"text":"what isn't to like about Serrano's?

Service is better than most restaurants in Tempe. 

They bring you a pitcher in addition to your drink. This is great if you consume gallons of diet coke as I do. 

The chips, salsa, and bean dip (especially the bean dip) are out of this world. Be careful with them, because you will fill yourself before your entrée comes.

Everything on the menu is tasty. Reasonably priced, and VERY filling.

I eat an incredible amount of food, and very often leave restaurants feeling hungry. I have NEVER left this place without feeling full, or even overly full from eating so much of the bean dip."}
{"text":"I have come here twice in the past couple years and I have never had an issue with the service. My cousins love this place since they have been coming here forever. I do like the salsa and warm bean dip with the chips. One of our group ordered a cheese crisp and put bean dip all over it. A solid move in my book. 

I had the tacos. Nothing bad, nothing spectacular. This is a classic Tex-Mex place like we have back East. To stay relevant they need to modernize their menu a bit more. Maybe add some street style tacos?

Overall it is fine. I liked the margaritas as well."}
{"text":"Nothing is authentic here, too much cheese, beans and not much flavor. The chicken looks it has freezer burns,  no flavor because they boil it before putting if on the grill"}
{"text":"Had such a wonderful experience at this restaurant. We were a party of 24+ people and I could not believe how quickly our food came out! Our servers were so pleasant and efficient. Very personable staff! Our food was high quality and there were decent portions/prices. Hours after hour meal, I overheard two of us STILL TALKING about how great our waitresses were and about how impressed we all were with the speediness of the service. Thank you for being so accommodating and for making my dad's birthday such a special one!"}
{"text":"This Serrano's is my favorite because it is cozy, dark and the service is really fast.  I love that you get salsa AND bean dip here, and that both are very good.  The food is seasoned well and if you add some hot sauce it has just enough kick to make your nose run, which is a good barometer for spice in my book.

The food is good and you get a lot for the price."}
{"text":"We like to come here. It is never too busy but has plenty of customers in and out. Although it is open like most restaurants, it has a very quiet calming mood. The unlimited chips, chunky salsa, and warm bean dip is a huge plus! One of the reasons we love to come. The food is not unique but it is pretty good. I always have a combination plate, they have all been satisfying.

We definitely recommend this place. 

*** Side Note: the food was a 5 star at the Serranos on Guadalupe. Unfortunately, they closed. :("}
{"text":"It's not earth shattering food but we come back here every time we visit family for the chips, salsa, and bean dip. 

We were suckered into hitting up another restaurant this visit and it just didn't have the same pull. I won't make that mistake again!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here at least 4 times in the past 15 years.  The best it's ever been was average.  The most recent time, about a month ago, I ordered a green burro.  It was very close to the worst green burro I've ever had at a restaurant.  Mostly soupy tasteless gravy, a few scattered bits of meat, and some slivers of something that might have been green chile many days earlier before the taste and texture had been completely cooked out of it.  The complimentary chips and dips are decent but the hot sauce is barely on the hot side. Garcia's is much better."}
{"text":"Went here again last night and it was amazing as always. One thing I forgot to mention in my previous review is that this is one of the few places that actually pays attention to their comment cards. So if you see one with your bill, I would recommend filling it out if you have any suggestions. The husband really wanted pollo fundido on their menu so he kept writing that on their cards and low and behold, a few months later, there it was on the menu. He likes to take credit for that one and say he is the reason they have it. Haha. I also wrote on their card that they needed new cups cause the old ones they had were looking pretty grimy and not very good. A week after writting that, I go there and there are new cups being used. Its great that they really pay attention to what their customers have to say.
On a sad note: We found out last night that they like to charge 1.75 for side of jalapenos. That kinda sucks! Maybe we will mention this in the comment card and suggest that they be free or 5 cents!"}
{"text":"It is not new, it is not hip or sheek, but it is casual, and quite good.

Start your meal with the signature bean dip, chips and salsa. In reality this is all you need for a meal but it is polite and delicious to try the other offerings. 

I oped for the chile relleno. A large chile stuffed with cheese battered and covered in a rich red sauce and more cheese. What is there not to love.

The red enchilada sauce here is deep and rich it pairs well with the cheese. 

So give the old local AZ chain a try I bet you will like it."}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican place in town. Prices very reasonable, unlimited chips, bean dip and salsa, and great service. I would definitely recommend this place for anyone looking to try a real deal family style mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"Ehhhhhhhh. I'm a Hispanic Californian and this food was not it at all. The guacamole was beyond gross. I don't know who can mess up guacamole. The enchiladas were edible but not necessarily good. We won't return here. Lesson learned."}
{"text":"I was a regular at Serrano's in the 80s while a student at ASU, and have been an infrequent visitor since. Would I drive 20 miles for Serrano's? No.  Would I frequent if I lived in the area?  Absolutely yes.  Do I visit when in the area?  Yes.

On my recent visit, I was seated quickly.  The service was extremely fast and friendly, the food hot and fresh, and they serve the most amazing iced tea- the old school Lipton variety, fresh brewed, clear and cold.   

At the recommendation of another Yelper, I ordered a pork taco, which was delicious. I also had a cheese enchilada and, coupled with their very hot and fresh chips, tasty salsa and bean dip, my meal was complete.

The food arrives quickly, which is important if you are on a tight schedule or have a tight boss who will flip if you take a 61 minute lunch.  

I usually don't comment on another reviewer's commentary- after all, we all have a right to our opinion.  BUT... One Star rating??? ... --what do people want?  This is an old school neighborhood family restaurant.  One star because it isn't as good as other Mexican places in the valley just isn't fair.  

If you're in the area, try Serrano's.  They serve a reliable, old-school Sonoran style Mexican food in a clean, comfortable old-school dining room.

{"text":"Went to this restaurant for dinner and I liked how the place looked nice and clean. We was immediately seated, I was impressed that they served us water without even having to ask or wait. Chips and salsa and bean dip came to our table right away. Employees are friendly/polite and quick service. The chips are good and I loved the salsa it was hot but not too hot, bean dip was good. My 1 year old loved his chicken quesadilla. I got the chimi beef steak, it was good but I thought it had to much pepper in it (if that was pepper I taste), the best part of the meal was Rice & Beans so yummy. I'd come here again."}
{"text":"We had the pleasure of not being acknowledged for 15 minutes before we ultimately walked out. There were employees standby g around and couldn't even bring us a bowl of chips or salsa, let alone water!"}
{"text":"I will start with the service. A+ on service. We were greeted as soon as we walked through the door and it hasn't ever been any wait for us so that's a plus. The servers here are on their feet when it comes to refills on drinks and the chips and salsa. I'm really satisfied with the friendly service here.

The cleanliness of the place is well kept. I don't think I found any major issues so I'm happy.

Food wise. It's pretty good to me but that's based on someone who haven't had real Mexican food. Based on that I usually go for the fajitas or the chimichangas and it tastes delicious! Even when I Togo the food it still taste good the next day.

I like this place but the four stars is because it doesn't pop up to my mind as a first choice when I'm hungry."}
{"text":"Queso fundido, bean dip, green corn tamales are my FAVORITE. This is my favorite place to eat in Tempe and when I come to Arizona. I got off the plane and came directly here. It's AMAZING. I came twice in one week on my last visit. This is my 4th time eating here in 3 trips to the area."}
{"text":"My favorite spot for yummy salsa, bean dip and chips. Went  on the the healthy side today; chicken breast with veggies. Wow the vegetable were great,but the chicken was too salty and plain. My lunch accompaniment had the lunch special and says the red sauce was grainy and not so good.  The severs and family oriented establishment will bring me back, but I am sticking with the enchiladas."}
{"text":"It's not traditional mexican food, lacks flavor inspiration. The restaurant itself is clean, it has a great ambiance, and is nicely decorated. The entrance convinces you that you're about to enjoy a traditional home cooked mexican meal but in reality you're eating to sustain here, you're not eating for joy.  

Let's start with the complimentary salsa and bean dip - the chips were nice and warm, the salsa had a nice flavor. However, the beans used in the bean dip don't appear to be the same refried beans provided with the entrees. it was waxy in texture and bland.

I ordered the Burro and Enchilada plate, I selected the green chile burrito and a cheese enchilada, the plate comes with rice and beans. I enjoyed the rice and beans. The green chile smelled similar to cat food, I still tried it, the meat was tender but that's all I'll say about that. The enchilada sauce must be made with flour and a chile powder, the flavor didn't resemble a recipe that calls for chile pods. This is just personal preference, I still ate it.

Overall, I won't recommend that place and I won't try it again."}
{"text":"The chicken fajitas were excellent with good service. Chips and dips are provided in advance and enjoyed their sauces that were included."}
{"text":"When I was younger and first moved to Arizona, Serrano's on Rural Road became a family tradition to get mexican food. It was basically all I knew till adulthood. If I would have reviewed this place 10 years ago, it would have been 5 stars but now the blinders are off and I have money to try better places. One by one they all seem to dwarf Serrano's in most every way. I feel kinda guilty writing this and hope my family does not read this :) But it has to be said. I would still eat at Serrano's but it doesn't have the same feeling anymore. The Chimichangas are good and their bean dip is awesome. Nothing I have had is gross or anything but its just   basic greasy mexican food. There are better places out there. Once again to any family reading this....I'm sorry :)"}
{"text":"Went here for a team lunch yesterday to celebrate a couple birthdays.  Easily in the top five Mexican chains here in the Phoenix area.  Fresh chips and salsa, and they also bring a really tasty bean dip to the table while you're waiting for your food.  Our table ordered the nachos and the queso fundido (jalapeno cream cheese dip) and both were nice.  I got the chicken enchiladas suizas - which was covered in tomatillo sauce.  The beans and rice were spot on and the enchiladas were nicely seasoned.  So, this is a good standby - I won't be in a hurry to get back, but it's a solid choice if you're craving Mexican food."}
{"text":"After visiting the other locations with clients, I'm sorry to report that this is the worst. I order the same thing every time. The mini appetizer substitute fundido instead of guacamole. Apparently at this location that isn't allowed. A side of fundido is $2.25 they say. So what is a side of guacamole? $2.25. Doesn't make sense. Three other locations have made the substitution without hesitation. If you want to check out Serranos I would not go to this location. Service and quality at the other locations have been top notch. Here, blah. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"This is not really a Mexican restaurant. It serves dishes that sort of resemble well-known Mexican food, but the similarity stops there. 

The six dishes our party ordered were insipid and dull. Even the guacamole did not taste right. When I ordered 'sopa de tortilla' from the menu, the waiter did not know the menu well enough to know what I was ordering. The top-shelf margarita tasted like lemonade. Stay away!"}
{"text":"Good Mexican Food. Salsa is very good. Price is on higher side."}
{"text":"I love Mexican food. I've lived in southern California almost all my life. I was visiting a friend a few times a year for a couple of years, and we would come here regularly at my request. (Either this location or the one in Mesa.) Now I always order the same thing. I get the shredded beef flauta and a cup of albondigas soup, plus I order a large container of bean dip to go, and I am in heaven. This is actually my favorite restaurant, ever. I used to have a favorite mexican restaurant local to me, but they aren't as good as Serrano's is to me. I have actually made a road trip (6 hours drive from Anaheim) out to Tempe just to play at Gameworks and go eat Serranos with a friend. Stayed the night in a hotel and went home. I wish I could take Serrano's back home with me. The food gets five stars from me, and the servers get five stars from me. Every server I've had was super friendly, and some of them have been working there for some twenty years. They get to know their regulars. Also the atmosphere of the restaurant is nice, it's air conditioned (of course, in AZ you would die without it), and spacious, and the bathrooms are clean. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Great menu, great food, great company:) I went with 2 friends for a business lunch.Low key, friendly and fast service. Best of all were the savory platters."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come here frequently since we live less than a 1/4 mile away. We always sit in the bar area/at the bar. Bri seems to always serve us and she is FANTASTIC. She is always helpful, sweet, on point and gives OUTSTANDING service. We have both worked in the service industry for YEARS so we know great service when we receive it. The food is always delicious and fast. We are always impressed and satisfied when we leave."}
{"text":"Had a very good meal.  My only complaint is that the wait staff was not knowledgeable about the menu and could not offer recommendations."}
{"text":"We came to Serranos at about 3pm. We wanted to sit in the lounge/ bar area for happy hour. The old lady hostess asked us if we were both over 21 to which we both said yes. She looks at us like she doesn't believe us and acts like its a hassle for her to seat us in there. We each order an alcoholic beverage seeing as though we were celebrating my birthday.  Our server cards us both and meticulously looks at our ID's...it's annoying but I get it. Then after we put away our ID's he comes back over to us and asks to see them again then he makes us write down our ID number and sign our name... We're 23 and 25. I work in the hospitality industry and this isn't normal! A single ID check will do just fine. Our server was polite and just trying to keep his job but when we ask to speak to the manager, Caroline (the GM) almost argues with us about the process and how it's just how things are. Caroline we understand that. But what we don't understand is why you couldn't even hear us out and talk to the company about changing their policy without having a major attitude and being so defensive. No one wants to go out for a good time then be treated like juvenile delinquents. We can spend our money else where and won't be back. Serranos, you serve mediocre Mexican food, you're no hot spot nightclub. But if you were, Caroline you should have a drink and lighten the hell up."}
{"text":"had family friends come in town and they wanted good mexican food and good fajitas. serranos had both- the bean dip and salsa they bring to the table were excellent. the service was great and our entrees were wonderful. will be returning again soon!"}
{"text":"Best bean dip in the state of Arizona! I always get the red Chili Colorado. My sister always gets the salad tortilla bowl, my dad always gets the pork, and my mother orders the tortilla soup. It's a family thing every time!"}
{"text":"The past few times I've been in I've had great service and incredible food. The atmosphere is a little dark and depressing but the food and service out weigh it."}
{"text":"Some of the best Mexican food I have had! Then again, I am in the southwest. Beam dip is amazing! I kinda wanted to lick the bowl. The chicken chimichanga was amazingly flavorful and delicious! Great chips and salsa. Friendly service.

Ps. I'm catching up on reviews....this was from 10 months ago. Oops"}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of Mexican food, so I usually order a quesadilla of some sort. I came here for lunch today and ordered a cheese quesadilla. The server asked if I wanted it crispy or soft. I was a little confused and told him I wanted a folded quesadilla, not a cheese crisp. He then told me that unless I order the quesadilla with meat, that all they do is put cheese on the tortilla and put it in the microwave. I was even more confused. Why would I come to a restaurant to order food that has been prepared in the microwave? And why would a restaurant admit to microwaving their food? Anyways, my friend and I decided to split an order of mediocre nachos. Needless to say, I will not be back."}
{"text":"So i decided to try the mexican place across the street from me thinking it might be tasty... unfortunately my phone call started with a elderly woman who did not know what was on the menu and she almost caused me to cuss at her and hang up... I finally get my order through and i go to pick up my food.  It was sorta busy and the service was better once i got inside... sadly the food was... bland... i ordered the Machacha plate with corn tortillas... there was a small lake beneath my machacha, the beans were ok as well as the rice.  The tortillas were whatevers also.  It was bad but it was good... i dont think ill be returning... maybe im spoiled cuz im from California... so much better food in Cali"}
{"text":"They didnt pick up the table for over 10 min and the group lect without any service. A little girl cried."}
{"text":"In the last few years I went to Serrano's twice, both times with a client who loves their bean dip that comes with the chips.  The chips are good, but the salsa is not spicy at all.  The food is average.  I have had way better green corn tamales elsewhere.  If you have relatives visiting from the Midwest who can't handle anything spicier than black pepper, this place is ideal.  The service was good."}
{"text":"Yikes. This was a really interesting experience at Serrano's. I've been to other locations and like the food, but that was not the case here. This was my first visit to this location, and I won't be back. 
The restaurant: The interior was old and dated, and I felt like it hadn't been cleaned in awhile. Gross.
The food: Meh. I got a cheese quesadilla and not only was there grease all over the plate, but I felt like I needed to take a shower when I got done with it. My husband was not impressed with his tacos, and the rice and beans were just ok.
The service: This was their one redeeming quality. Our server was really nice and quick (we were on a lunch break).
Overall, I would skip Serrano's- at least this location."}
{"text":"It is Serrano's and I think people either like Serrano's or they don't. It will pass for Mexican food by many locals and most visitors. As a general rule, I find Serrano's only \"OK\" Mexican food. To me if the rice and beans aren't great, it's a mark against a Mexican restaurant. On the other hand, the bean dip they serve with the chips is good.

So specific to this place which we visited Friday - Chile Relleno w/shrimp (wanted a change) was great, no complaints. Wife's Carne Asada was heavy on the pepper for some reason. Our dinner guest had Tostadas and seemed quite happy with them. Margarita's were extremely lame, didn't even bother to order another.

Decor is in serious need of an overhaul. Visiting the restrooms and peering into the kitchen, the place just needs a revamp."}
{"text":"This location is amazing. Had a long day and was craving Serranos, but they had about 20 mins to close. Came in expecting to be told their closing, but instead the manager insisted we have a seat. Our server was Dolyn and she was great! Nobody else was in the restaurant and she was more than accommodating. Her customer service was genuine and she was extremely pleasant. After a long day at work, school and life, this location topped off our day and we will continue to come here."}
{"text":"Chips and bean dip are good.
Salsa doesn't have a bite so to me it's lacking.
Came in here around 3 p.m. and almost expected them to be closed but nope, late lunch crowd.  That would be us and another party of six?
Beverage delivery to our table was super slow.  Busgirl asked our drink order, then server asked, and yet it felt like it was forgotten.
That is until server finally shows up, with the wrong drink.
Entrees ordered and they arrive.  Two entree with one side combo wasn't quite prepared right.  It appears they served a cheese enchilada with meat on the outside to make up for the fact it was suppose to be a meat enchilada.
Mexican veggies side and black beans had cheese all over them.  Enough already with the cheese.  I was trying for something with fewer calories.
Server was kind to stop by to fill sons soda but overlooked water glasses.  Did return, took one of the glasses and filled it from the sink behind the booth.
Lovin' me some tepid tap water.
Hostess/manager passed by to ask how everything was.  I always say, if you really don't want to know how the meal is you visit the table right when someone puts a bite into their mouth.
Food was alright.
Service wasn't what I would have expected.

We used to come here pretty regularly as a family but the quality just hasn't been up to snuff and now the service."}
{"text":"This is not real mexican food.

Who serves beans with chips?  The beans were good but the concept was not understood.  Even in Mexico they don't give you a bowl of beans with chips for an appetizer.  It was free though so plus for that!  The salsa was decent as well and of all the food we ordered (5 people total), the carne asada was the best flavor with grill tasting all over it.  Cute how they give you a \"serrano\" chile with each meal.

Everything else was bland.  My fried ice cream was not crunchy and way too hard that we couldn't finish it because we couldn't wait for it to melt more.  A little over priced too."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican restaurant around. Best chips and salsa too. The restaurant is in a terrible strip mall and the atmosphere is lacking but the great food makes up for all that."}
{"text":"I am a bit picky with my mexican food since I live in a city next to the border. 

The food was average. I recall ordered a machaca burrito with a side of salad, rice, and beans. It cost about $10 which is a bit overpriced for my taste. 

The service was wonderful, although some of the comments one of the waitresses mentioned were a bit off. But nonetheless, she is trying and I appreciate it. 

I would recommend going to another Mexican joint."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Serranos for over 30 years after tonight's experience with the unbelievably rude bartender, as well as the filthy environment of the bar and restaurant as a whole it just seems like they either changed ownership or given up on customer service. I will never return again and I urge others to do the same"}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican food!  Unlimited Chips, Bean Dip & Salsa - delicious!  

This place has a homely feel and reminds me of my Grandma's cooking.  Love the chimichangas & Taco platter.  Definitely try this place!"}
{"text":"Serrano's is a great Mexican food restaurant.  Their bean dip is always a hit and I enjoy their margaritas, too.  It is a nice family atmosphere.   Service has always been good for us.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"In Phoenix on a business trip and I came here for dinner.

I wanted to get the Serranos Special Combination which comes with a beef taco, cheese enchilada and bean tostada. However, I wanted a tamale instead of the tostada. They wouldn't let me even for an extra charge. They lost a star over this. Instead I ordered the carne asada burrito enchilada style with the red enchilada sauce. The flavors were perfect. They did the red enchilada sauce right, using chilis (something you can't find in Miami) and the meat was tender and well seasoned.

The service was excellent (except for not allowing substitutions). They were very friendly and constantly checking in on me.

The ambiance was nice with plenty of seating."}
{"text":"I've been going to Serrano's Mexican Food Restaurants ever since I was a little girl. In fact, the Ahwatukee location (now closed) was where I got my 1st job as a server. It's still the place I go when I crave Mexican food, and the place I take everyone from out of town. 
I LOVE the food there- my favorites are the new carne asada stuffed chili relleno's, Machacha quesadilla, carne asada tacos (on corn only), and any of the chimichanga's. Their salsa and bean dip is the best (and the bean dip is the reason other places started serving it with their salsa) and can fill you up. 
With that being said, their food was definitely better in the past. I'm assuming cost cutting measures in this economy hit them a little hard because the chips are different (maybe healthier? they are not as fried as before and if you want them salty you have to put salt on them), and they give smaller amounts of bean dip & salsa than in the past. The food is still as good, although my boyfriend had the seafood sampler last night and despite being fair, it had definitely been frozen. 
What's gotten better? The fried ice-cream. Used to be vanilla ice cream coated in cinnamon corn flakes and fried, but now it's cinnamon ice cream with the same coating and fried. You rarely have enough room for dessert at the end of a meal here, but if you can squeeze it in, don't miss out on the fried ice cream!"}
{"text":"Good option for Mexican food.  I like their rellenos, which can be stuffed with meat rather than just cheese.  Their machaca is slow cooked, tender, juicy, with a lot of flavor.  Their machaca taco in particular is great.  The taco shell is deep fried, so it is a bit greasy though.  Despite what some may say, I like how they bring out bean dip in addition to salsa with the chips.  It helps distract you from the blahness of the chips : )  Too bad they don't have aguas frescas though.  Some horchata would really hit the spot!"}
{"text":"I ate here yesterday after a friend recommended it. The staff was very friendly and the service was great. Prices were very fair in my opinion. 

I had the lunch special which consisted of a beef taco, rice and received beans. The rice was amazing! Lots of flavor and a bit of spice. The taco was good although the beef could have been better-seasoned. 

Overall, I recommend this place. The owner was very friendly and helpful too!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner while in Tempe for spring training.  Choose Serrano's based upon Yelp feedback and glad we did.  7 of us in our party and everyone was pleased with their meal.  Loved the spinach enchiladas!"}
{"text":"We had an amazing time at Serranos!!! I had never been here before but have heard a lot of great things about several of their locations and I wasn't sure what to expect, but they exceeded expectations! Ultimately deserving all five stars! 

First, we went here with a large group of about 14 including adults and a few kids. We were quickly sad down and felt comfortable in the area. We weren't smushed between other people or feeling crowded by other guests. 

Our server was absolutely fantastic! She was very attentive, funny, and kept the chips flowing before we placed our orders and go our meal. She was really great, perfectly attentive, and got everything right the first time. Being a large group, we've had our fair share of servers getting confused, mixing up orders, or getting things wrong / missing things and we didn't have any issues. Service was fantastic!

The food was also amazing!! Everything was really great tasting and the portions were pretty large. After pretty much topping ourselves off with chips before we even got our main meal we took enough home for a hearty snack and next days lunch. 

Overall, the place was really great - especially for our large group! We were seated quickly and felt comfortable in the area. Our server was BOMB - attentive, patient, funny, and on point with taking our order and delivering what was expected to us. The food was flavorful and served up in large portions. They definitely exceeded the expectations I had and especially for the size of our group the food came out quick!"}
{"text":"Love the staff and manager - always so friendly and creates a family atmosphere.  Great food, only wish they were open on Sundays - but everyone needs a day off.  Thanks for a great family place to dine!"}
{"text":"Tasty.  Nice, sit down Mexican food place with very friendly service.  Lots of options available including veggie.  Somewhat outdated interior, but still pleasant.  Kudos to the server that got us a fresh chips and salsa refill BEFORE we asked for it.

Significantly better than your average Mexican joint.  Closed on Sundays."}
{"text":"We just found this place and very much like it. I think the bean dip is our favorite. It is free with the chips and salsa. We will be back"}
{"text":"It's hard to find a good Mexican restaurant.  This one is okay, but there really should be a great one out there somewhere.  Prices were reasonable (about $12 per dish), salsa seemed homemade and was good."}
{"text":"I wanted to give a \"shout out\" to Serranos!  I haven't been in about a year and was as Serrano's last night! The food was delicious... The service was exceptional!   Great Chips and Salsa... gotta love the Taco Salad with the guacamole dressing!I"}
{"text":"If you've ever experienced terrible service, you know the irritable feeling that builds and builds as you sit for 20 minutes and watch the tables around you being seated and waited on until you're finally \"greeted\" by a surly waitress rushing you to order after she finally decides to waddle her way to your table.  

I had some high expectations for the place because I'd heard everyone rave on about it, so I was patient and enjoyed the cheese crisp appetizer that came 15 minutes after ordering it while the table of three directly across from my duet table enjoyed the meal they ordered after they sat down 15 minutes behind us.
 
As the clock made it's way to the 45 minute mark, and all the ice in the water pitcher they gave us had long-since melted, my friend laid out her ultimatum, \"if she doesn't come out with the food the next time she comes out of that kitchen, we're leaving\".  Even though I was dying to try the fajitas, I was all on board since the cheese crisp had already settled in my stomach. 

Apparently I was meant to have fajitas that day because I heard that distant sizzling that whispers \"yourrrr fajittasssss arrrrre coooommiiiinnnnggg\" get louder and louder until a stranger popped in front of us like a ray of sunshine over our gloom.  Quite the contrast from our waitress, that was clearly deciding to indulge in her mid-life crisis during the Father's Day rush, he was exceptional.

I suppose she had already kissed her tip goodbye when she came to see if we needed anything a couple of minutes after we finally got our food (from someone else) and we asked for the check (since we didn't want to wait until closing to get it), because she was sure to impart upon us a sassy, \"I will if you'll give me a minute\".  

NEVER in my life have I complained at a restaurant and I would have taken it all with a grain of salt if she hadn't used the tone she used when we asked for the check, but that was too much.  On top of that, she began rushing us out of the booth once she placed the bills in front of us.  \"Would like some to-go cups?\"  I know the server-vernacular you fossil fuel. 

We flagged down a bus boy to send a manger our way and he was polite enough to give us a discount (of course it was the principle of the whole situation at that point).  She avoided us like the plague before, but when she saw that manager hovering over us, she was suddenly Gladys Kravitz. 

After paying our discounted bill, we found the bus boy who had basically done our waitress' job and gave him a very generous tip, leaving her nothing.  Another first in my life, but well-deserved, and I flew out of there in hopes to avoid the already awkward situation of the restaurant-complaint.

Had the food not been delicious, I would've given this place 1 star and had the service not been atrocious, I would have given it 4 stars.   I'd recommend the restaurant, but not this particular location, especially if there is any sort of holiday, or the scent of any sales going on in the area."}
{"text":"Second time here and am not disappointed. The staff is the most welcoming staff I have ever encountered at a restaurant. Happy, helpful Nd energetic. And the food is great. Everything is fresh and flavorful."}
{"text":"I am an AZ native from Chandler, and I remember going to Serranos as a kid in Downtown Chandler. In my opinion, it is one of those AZ Mexican style restaurants that emphasizes the greatness of the food genre out here and brings some class to the history of the city. I personally have never had a bad time or bad service in any Serranos location I have visited.

I've also yet to order a meal that I have not liked. Granted, I always feel tremendously full when I leave, but I can't fault the restaurant for that. It is mostly due to the delicious salsa and bean dip you get before you even order the actual meal. 

If you want a recommendation on what to order, you can't go wrong with Chicken Fajitas. Just don't fill up on too many chips, salsa, and bean dip."}
{"text":"Great food! But even better service!!! This was our first time here and the waitress was the nicest person!!! You could tell she loves her job and the company! Will be going back for sure!"}
{"text":"Grabbed a late lunch while the restaurant was pretty slow. Ordered a chicken chimichanga and a margarita. Both were pretty good as was the chips, salsa and bean dip. Pretty on par with what you'll find with most Mexican chain restaurants."}
{"text":"Not my all time favorite but definitely up there!  I've always had good service at this location and the bean dip and chips are wonderful.  There's nothing incredibly creative on the menu, but what's on there is usually pretty darn good!"}
{"text":"Great food.  Seated quickly.  Sat in lounge which was kind of 70s.  Had a beef taco and cheese enchilada special for $5.99 which were fantastic.  Beef taco was the best. Definitely would visit again."}
{"text":"We have been visiting this restaurant for years. We love the consistency of the food and the friendliness of the staff. As the economy recovers this place is super busy. We visited on a Friday night and there was a 25 minute wait. However, we got into the bar and there were two seats at the bar that were separate. Their customer service was fabulous in the fact that they moved the other barstool down next to the one so they were together and asked everyone to scoot down. How cool is that. The customers were really nice and the fact that they didn't mind moving down. I always have the chili Relleno with rice and beans and my husband has steak fajitas. They are really really good and it's always consistently good every time we go. This is one of our favorite local Mexican restaurants that we visit about every month. We will continue to come back!"}
{"text":"I am giving this restaurant one star tonight for one reason, and one reason only.  I came here tonight to eat, I got seated, looked over the menu, found what I wanted, and waited.  And waited.  And waited some more.  About five minutes go by, and one of the busers offered water, chips, and salsa while we waited for our server.  Another five to six minutes go by.  Nothing.  All the other servers looked over and made eye-contact, but not one of them bothered to come to the table.  By this time, about fifteen minutes pass.  I've had enough.  I could understand if someone came to the table and explained that the server was finishing up doing something, in the bathroom, getting fucked by the cook, whatever, but nothing.  I got up to leave and told the manager that I had been sitting at my table with my fiancé for over ten minutes, and the only person who greeted us was a buser.  She apologized, and offered to be our server for the night and comp our meal, but I did not accept the offer.

I have been here several times, and this is the first time I have EVER experienced such horrible service at this restaurant.  Granted, all my previous experiences were good because I was sitting in the bar section....apparently, they have their act together over on the bar side.  Now I know.  I hope the person who was assigned at the table I was at gets fired, or, at least, reprimanded in some way that causes him/her to lose more of his/her tips for the evening.  

It'll be awhile before I come back to this location again.  I'm the type of person that will give a restaurant three strikes before I will not go to them again.  Serranos at Rural, this is strike one.  You have two left."}
{"text":"My family consists of 5 Serrano's regulars and we all love the food dearly. It is with serious dismay that I give this location 3 stars. I've been to this one much more than usual since it is closest to my new home, but holy shizen is the service terrible. There are two waiters, one male in the dining room and one female primarily in the bar that are attentive, friendly, and give a serious hustle. But literally everyone else that I've had at my table - bussers, waiters, & hosts included have been incredibly awkward and slow. I'm not a fan of sitting for two hours at a restaurant and I definitely don't want to be harassed about the number of chips I eat relative to my boyfriend by a sassy, teenage bus boy. Not only did he stop by the table about nine times to talk to us and not SERVE us, but he was rude and extremely awkward each and every time. I'll always choose the downtown Chandler location if I can but sometimes just have to suck up the service for a good taco."}
{"text":"Serrano's has my favorite salsa period. I love the chunkiness and the flavor. The salsa is the THE REASON I go to Serrano's. I used to work a mile down the street from the location at Rural and Guadalupe and I'd eat there at least once a week for lunch. I usually ordered something ala carte because the salsa was the reason I was there.   The rest of the menu is simply ordinary in my opinion. Ordinary food is the reason they get 4 stars instead of 5. Still, I try and eat at Serrano's every time I'm on the east side of town since there are no locations west of Tempe.  I live 35 miles from the closest restaurant and still find a way to eat at one 5 or 6 times a year.  I'm amazed to see the same faces working there 10 years later too. They must be doing more than just salsa right!"}
{"text":"We've been coming here for years. Food is still wonderful but the service at this location has been horrible the last three times we've been here. Took us  over an hour and a half to have a taco with beans and a tortilla soup. Thankfully the chips kept us happy. We will be back but I'm hoping the service changes back to the Serranos we fell in love with."}
{"text":"Only one word to describe this place \"HORRIBLE \"the food had no taste of Mexican food what soever, the service was okay, but I wouldn't go back!"}
{"text":"Hell yeah. Enchiladas were bomb. Being from LA, I'm a tad picky. But I'm gonna keep coming back. Love the chill vibe. Pretty good chips and salsa. YUMMO"}
{"text":"Serrano's to me is one of those good 'bad' Mexican restaurants. It isn't authentic. Everything is covered in cheese. But it still tastes good. Plus, Serrano's serves free bean dip with their chips and salsa.... that is a hue plus! I've been to several Serrano's locations, and this one was a little weak compared to the others. A friend and I sat in the bar, which was fine. I had the Chambord marg, on special for 6$, and it tasted a little like cough medicine, but wasn't undrinkable. We split a cheese crisp and I got a side of rice and cup of albondigas soup. The albondigas has been WAY better at other locations, it could've been an off night, but it just didn't seem like it had cooked long enough or something (the veggies were still a bit firm). The cheese crisp was delish (of course), and still tasted good the next day. I will return!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place.  Great food, friendly service.  GREAT quesadillas.  We prefer sitting in the bar- we just like booths.  Will return often.  YUM."}
{"text":"I've been to this location a few times and my food isn't bad, but tonight for some reason it was so gross! I got chicken & steak fajitas but couldn't eat any of the meat. I couldn't even bite through the steak, and the chicken had fatty pieces and I found a BONE! Honestly I'm so thankful I didn't give that piece of chicken to my dog, he could of choked. 

They forgot the sour cream and guacamole too with my fajitas! Don't forget the burnt tortillas! Thanks for the $17 veggies? They also forgot the salsa with our chips (how does that happen) and they forgot our hot sauce as well after we ordered it with our meals. We had to go back in for the hot sauce & salsa and they made us pay. 

SO cheap!!! We pay $50 for a meal and you make us pay for hot sauce? The only thing constantly good here is the bean dip. Other than that, this place SUCKS!!!! You're better off saving your money and spending it at Los Favs or Filibertos over this garbage!"}
{"text":"Good making restaurant family-run love the bean dip and salsa always get a chimichanga"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican food restaurant in the valley.  The chips and salsa are just the way I like: chips not too thick with a good amount of salt; salsa is chunky and flavorful. I've had several things on the menu, but my favorite is the nachos with machaca beef.  Service has always been good every time I've gone."}
