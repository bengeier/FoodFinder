{"text":"Stopped in to pick up a chicken souvlaki to take home.   Food was cold, skewer was small and rice was hard and barely any in the container.   Very disappointed.   Worst thing is it cost $17.00.  What a rip off."}
{"text":"Quite possible the worlds worst eggs Benny served anywhere on the planet. the cook how sent this garbage to my table should be ashamed of himself. I guess what they had ladeled across my eggs was suppose to be hollandaise, not even close, plenty of breakfast restaurants use hollandaise from a can and that's ok for the most part........ the taste was so awful I could even eat more than 2 bites. The server seemed like she was the owner, when I ordered toast and asked her to take the plate she looked at me and commented I maybe wasn't as hungry as I thought, gee I guess it never occured to her it was crap, and she wanted to be paid in full with taking it off the bill. paid my bill in full and left. I post my review and complain with my wallet, customer lost forever."}
{"text":"Enjoyed an amazing burger and a handful of sweet potato fries.  The sauce for the fries was really good and the burger was delicious.  I like the simple paired down burger and this was exactly how I like it.  Enjoyed some beer as well which was nice and cold.  Tried an ABC shot which is amaretto Baileys and cinnamon.  It was delicious."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was okay. Typical dive type of Bar. Great service. The place is dated but the food. Way. Too. Much. Salt.  Everything tastes like it has salt caked on it.   Could have just beena bad plate but then again I got the soup and it was very salty as well  I usually don't mind salt but I couldn't even finish it was that bad. The bread also tasted old and cheap.   My plate was also a recommended top ordered item on the menu.   The serving portion was good. It looked great.   Would I return? Likely not. Just a bad experience with the food.   Cost was pretty average."}
{"text":"Pretty standard bar.  Lots of TVs, which is great for catching games.  Wednesday is wing night which gets you 2 lbs for the price of 1.  Decent beer selection.  No complaints, but nothing to rave about.  Note: Apparently you can ask for ranch sauce rather than the standard blue cheese dip for your wings."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast and ordered the double with sausage. Came with breakfast potatoes, toast, two eggs, and three breakfast sausages. My boyfriend had the New York style breakfast meal, which same with the potatoes and toast as well, and two eggs. Food was really good, especially since they have all day breakfast! Looking forward to going back here to try their regular grill menu. Atmosphere is really casual. We sat in the bar area. I'm assuming everyone here are regulars, but everyone was really friendly (both staff and customers). Really looking forward to coming back as I mentioned! No negative comments for this place :)"}
{"text":"My favourite neighbourhood place!  I have been going here for years.  Peter and his wife are amazing people!  Pat (server) has been with the restaurant for over 30 years - from when Peter's dad and uncle owned the place.  All of the food is great with great portions and prices are reasonable.  This is my #1 go to place for meeting friends and family, having a night out, or just enjoying a good breakfast (all day if I wanted!).  My favourites:  Clubhouse sandwich, souvlaki dinner, breakfast."}
{"text":"Had the $10 Beef Dip lunch special. Food was good; not great, but the service and speed were excellent!  Might give this place another try if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Their Prime Rib was awesome, but they stopped serving it. The only other thing I've ever had there was the Greek salad and it was terrific. Honestly. Terrific Greek salad"}
{"text":"Went to this complete dive for eggs. Wow what a crook of crap. The over-easy eggs were hard, asked for the fries to be well done and got maybe one crunchy fry with many soggy under-cooked ones. As with another great comment below; the waitress asked if all was good and told her about my awful plate and her reply was I will talk to the owner and the chef is really good. Chef? My ass, it was probably a person that has the cooking skill of a non-cook. Never understood how three eggs and fries could be so messed up. I guess that shows the quality of this dump.  Asked for a refill coffee and I guess the waitress was too confused and did not understand my request for another coffee. And of course sending back my meal did not mean anything to the sleazy owner. My bill way in full. Never thought to discount the bill.  Do not go here it is quite bad including a stingy owner that obviously does not make an attempt to get you back for another visit. And I did hear him say: \"you got to be kidding\" when the waitress told him about my complaint.  See you later looser."}
{"text":"Reasonable prices on food and drinks. Big serving of nachos. Very big serving of chicken souvlaki. The coconut shrimp listing indicates that it comes \"on a bed of greens\", but it's actually a few small leaves of lettuce. More cot than bed.  Service was okay. Odd that the one server kept asking us to \"have a drink for\" her.   The place looked as though many of the patrons were regulars, which must be a good sign."}
{"text":"I've grown up in this neighborhood and know well enough that this is a neighborhood gem. Peter G's serves all day breakfast. Their dining area is a separate room from their bar area, but you can order food on both sides! I keep coming back for their eggs Benedict and large portioned breakfasts. They don't cheap out on you! You get what you pay for."}
