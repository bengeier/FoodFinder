{"text":"Found this place by accident llast week, so I decided to give it a try. Food was very good, service was friendly and quick. A nice surprise at the end of the meal was when my sever brought out a small dessert plate, unprompted. It's the little things like this that get my attention.  I give it four stars instead of five because the salsa was a bit watery, (which diminished the taste), and the rice was a little bland for me. But these are minor - I *will* be returning with friends."}
{"text":"Just went in for happy hour- it says happy hour on the front window. I paid $7.50 plus tax for an alleged margarita. BTW the menu price is $7.50, so, not sure what's on special during happy hour at a Mexican restaurant on a Monday. I really think I just paid 8 bucks for margarita mix."}
{"text":"My wife read some (recent) good reviews of this new Mexican spot (in the paper), so we decided to give it a try.  Inside is very nondescript, and nothing special.  The chips and salsa came out to the table immediately.  Chips were piping hot and almost looked homemade (not really sure). The salsa was a bit thin/runny, but the flavor was quite good.  They also provided another unique dipping sauce, which appeared to be a spiced-up mayo that everyone at the table seemed to enjoy.  For our meals...I decided to give a fairly standard combo a try: beef burrito, chicken quesadilla, rice and beans.  I found the meal to be average (at best), simply lacking any depth of flavors.  My wife (on the other hand) chose a different route and went with the Cazuelada, which she loved!  The meal was capped off with a free, small order of sopapillas, which was a nice touch.  Overall, not sure I'm running back to try this place again, given all the other local Mexican restaurants to choose from...but maybe ordering away from the traditional \"combos\" menu is the better way to go here."}
{"text":"Service here is always above & beyond. The staff makes you feel like one of the namesake amigos. In my never to be humble opinion, they serve the best quality Mexican food in Brunswick. I've never left less than happy with everything."}
{"text":"Absolutely Delicious!  These guys know how to make a Margarita too.  My husband and I stopped on a Tuesday, which was buy 1 Margarita at regular price and get 2nd for .99.  The menu is very extensive and everything is homemade.  The complimentary chips and salsa were great, but a side of their homemade ranchero sauce was a hit!  I loved my La Oaxaquena, which was tender and very flavorful.  My husband was also very happy with his Cazuelada.  Both of our entrees were accompanied by a side of rice and homemade beans.  The beans were the best I've had!   The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. There are a few Mexican choices in the area, but this food is by far the best!   We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Service is really good. The menu is large and varied.  Monday is a good night nit many people around. The salsa is definitely homemade, not your run of the mill stuff, more what you expect from family place.   The cheese dip is very runny, more milk than sauce. Only bad thing was cheese dip.   The food is very fresh and well seasoned. The steak was perfect strips, cheeses are mild but have flavor. The tortillas are small do you'll need extra. The beef in chimi's is shredded, but juicy. The chicken is better.   The service was awesome. After ordering, I got samples of tequila with lime slice. Can't say it's normal, but I tipped appropriately."}
{"text":"Great food. Their menu reminds me of Si Senor (in fact we ordered the same dishes we normally get a Si Senor, and really they were nearly identical), but their service is just great. Glasses never went empty and everyone we had any contact with was friendly and polite. We just loved this place, and we will be back."}
{"text":"Excellent food, good service.    I really liked the combination with two chicken chimichangas, rice and beans.  Chips and salsa also included some white sauce that I can't pronounce and won't try to spell.  It was really good!!!"}
{"text":"My family of three has been here twice and we have not been disappointed.  The food is really good.  The salsa and chips are fresh...and so is the food.  I had the enchilada verde and it was spicy and delicious!  I have also tried the huevos con chorizo and it was soo good!  The rice and refried beans are delicious too!  I highly recommend this place if you are in the mood for some good Mexican!"}
{"text":"Really good food. Fantastic service. Good prices and close to home. I have a big family (6) and they have giant booths so we could all sit together. I like that. I look forward to returning."}
{"text":"Hit or miss. I have been here before, and have had awesome food and Margs. But the other day it was very off. The marg was wayyyy too sugary, and there was meat in my vegetarian meal. Disappointing trip, but typically good."}
{"text":"So I decided to try out this restaurant after seeing all the 5 star reviews on yelp. I went with two other friends for dinner. We got there and were immediately seated, and they brought out chips, salsa, and some sort of ranch dip (which was delicious). We ordered a couple bottles of beer (they were on special that day for 2$). The waiter was prompt, we placed out food orders and it came out quickly. The food was good, not the best but not the worst.  Overall, my experience was that it was no different than any other Mexican restaurant, the food wasn't any better (or worse) than other places, the service was quick, and drinks average."}
{"text":"A few weeks ago we wanted to check out this fairly New Mexican restaurant! Easy to find and located on the Brunswick strongsville boarder. The food was good but did not stand out from any other Mexican food I have had. The service was quick but we waited 20 minutes after we were finished for our checks. I wouldn't come out of my way to come back here but if I was nearby I may give it a second thought."}
{"text":"We love this place. Discovered it a few months ago and we go at least twice a month. Everything is great, the food, the service, can't say enough about it."}
{"text":"There are definitely plenty of Mexican restaurants around if you drive a couple of miles on Pearl (Cozumel, Los 4 Amigos, Gran Fiesta) and we've eaten a whole lot at each of them! But we only go back to one now and that is Los 4 Amigos.  The chips and salsa here are the best; it's more tomato and less onion, always a plus for me. On top of that they also bring an additional dipping sauce that is like a spicy ranch which is delicious also.   The quality of their meat cuts I think is also superior; my wife always gets the carne asada and they give huge portions. The rice and beans are top notch to, so they really nail down the essentials. I like their macho burrito which tops a burrito with queso and pineapple (this makes it healthy to me).....they do a lot of pineapple dishes and I was weary of it at first (cheese covered pineapple?) but this whole sweet and salty combination was amazing!  We almost always get a free dessert to, so who can be upset with free sopapillas?! Really nice and genuine staff; it's the only place that can be busy but not be insanely loud that you can't hold a conversation with someone near you. All 3 are good restaurants but this one has definitely separated itself from the pack for us."}
