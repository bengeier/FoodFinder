{"text":"Toujours excellent, bonne bouffe, bon prix, que demander de plus !! Le service est rapide et les serveurs sont toujours souriant. Il y a vraiment un gros menu, vous y trouverez quelque chose à votre goût."}
{"text":"Looks can be deceiving and Wing Phat is a perfect example of this. From the outside, the restaurant doesn't look very...appealing. It appears to be small & run down. I went based on a recommendation from a friend and boy am I glad I listened!   The interior of the restaurant is really nice and despite looking rather small from the outside, it's actually quite large and spacious! You don't feel crammed up (even during their busier times). The menu is HUGE (almost too big), which makes it so hard to decide! Each food item is properly described for those of us that are not familiar with Asian foods/terms. Their noodles are cooked to perfection & sauteed to the most flavorful ability.  Bonus: tea is free with, unlimited...and yummy!  However...just be careful if you're the specific type (ie: if you ask for no egg, make sure there's no egg...requests aren't always paid attention to). Service is mostly friendly, but try not to take too long to decide what you want."}
{"text":"Seriously delicious Chinese food. We'll definitely be coming back! Plus it's BYOB!"}
{"text":"I have been to this place many times and have tried most of the dishes on the menu and noticed that the meat was always odd tasting and had a very powdery texture to it.   I refrained from giving it a negative review the first few times thinking that maybe i was just unlucky and always went there on bad days.   I ended up going back with a group of friends for someone's birthday a month later and we ordered a variety of dishes for the table to share.  Among them were beef brocoli, ginger lobster and steemed tilapia.   We asked the waitress if the seafood was fresh before ordering because we didn't notice aquariums with live seafood and she confirmed that all their seafood was fresh that they were just kept downstairs. We found it odd but decided to order seafood nonetheless.   When our orders came we were all shocked at how small the lobsters were, like the poor things were caught before even reaching adulthood. We ate it anyway and it was one of the worst ginger lobsters i had ever eaten.  It was overly sweet as if it was cooked in peanut butter and the taste of the ginger was non existant.  The lobster meat was also very dry it felt like it was precooked the day before and then microwaved.  We moved on and tackled the tilapia next and the meat was so bland everyone thought it tasted like a fish that was purchased frozen from a supermarket.   By then everyone had lost their appetite and given up hope but we still forced ourselves to finish the beef brocoli. I was really curious to see if the beef was going to have that same powdery texture like meat that has been sitting in baking soda for too long to achieve tenderness and to my dismay it did!  Something is just not right when the meat falls apart before you even begin to chew it.   All in all im giving this place a one star because i don't believe they use fresh and quality ingredients and i will not be going back anytime soon"}
{"text":"General Tao Chicken was fluffy. Not too sweet, just good. Apparently it's packed for supper time."}
{"text":"Dishes are not salty but flavourful, and unlike many other chinese restos, you don't have to drink litres of water after dining here. Weekend special spicy beef soup stole my heart. Even simple steamed rice is good because they use jasmine rice and cook right (well anyone hates flavourless rice cooked with too much water? That's a turnoff.)"}
{"text":"Wing phat is a great family restaurant and a must try! I come here pretty often with my boyfriend and we always order our go to favourite meals. The Phnom Penh soup and the Lok Lak with rice. The Phnom Penh is a soup with noodles, seafood and minced porc( I usually ask for no organs). The soup base taste extremely flavourful and savoury. The Lok Lak is a dish served with marinated beef bites and a sort of orange fried rice. It is delicious and is humongous. They are so generous with their food portions...   The entire restaurant is super clean, and the staff is nice. I love how the prices on their menu already includes taxes. I would recommend to try this restaurant if you love authentic Asian food. Coming here is about 30 minutes drive for me, and every time I come to Wing Phat, it's definitely worth it!!"}
{"text":"Restaurant asiatique au multiple choix de plats que ce soit du homard, tofu,  de la soupe tonkinoise du boeuf au brocoli ce n'est pas les options qui manque. J'ai adoré mon boeuf au brocoli le géneral tao etait bon pas assez releve a mon goût mais bon. Les plats son génereux a bon prix. Le services est impecable rapide et efficace. C'est une machine qui roule bien le restaurant était bondé. Super bonne option quand l'on cherche a manger asiatique un dimanche ce qui peut parfois être compliqué quand on n'est pas dans chinatown. Tres satisfaite vais sûrement retourner pour goûter les soupe."}
{"text":"Un petit bijou caché.  Un des meilleurs asiatique à Montréal.  Le décor est banal mais la nourriture est excellente.  Une des meilleures soupe Won ton à Montréal et même en Thaïlande je n'ai pas goûté à un Pad Thai meilleur que le leur.  Peu importe ce que vous prenez sur le menu, tout est excellent."}
{"text":"This is my new favourite Chinese restaurant! The food quality is excellent and the place is very clean."}
{"text":"Amazing discovery. We got there at 5 (exceptionally early to be somewhere else after) it was already full! By the time we left at 6 there was a line up. I got the #1 Fish and meat soup. My boyfriend got the Special Tonkinese. Both delicious! I love that the taxes are included in the price. Big portions i got a small and I was so full by the end. We also got a plate of crispy sesame beef. I love that the plate was only beef thats it. I dont care for rice. 2 soups + big plate of beef, 32$ tax inc. Amazing. Cant wait to go back and try all the other things!"}
{"text":"On y retrouve un service rapide, l'équipe est joviale et il a y énormément de choix dans le menu. De plus, les portions sont généreuses. Vous en aurez pour votre argent!"}
{"text":"I asked for a large spicy papaya salad and it was made-me-cry spicy, huge portion, tastes as good as the ones in Thailand. Definitely recommend and would come back."}
{"text":"Pas le meilleur resto asiatique...mais ça dépanne quand on veut manger une bonne soupe tonki dans l'est! On peut maintenant y apportez son vin. Ce que j'aime c'est qu'il y a beaucoup de choix de repas...et qu'il y a des choix très abordables pour les groupes de 3-5 pers!!"}
{"text":"This place is incredible, and super tasty.  This is actually really really good Chinese for the surprising location it's at. Another excellent perk is that everyone including the Asians on staff speak fluent English making it extremely easy to communicate any special requests needed. (and we all know I will have a few)  Let me start by saying this place really has their S*** together !!! I went on a super duper ridiculously busy Saturday night.. (the type when you walk in and there's a line up practically out the door, but then again it's almost always like this because it's that good) and still the wait was only about 10-15 minutes because this place is decently large with a lot of seating.  While I was waiting for a table, I asked the hostess what she suggested as vegan options (I had been there many times before as a vegetarian but first time as a vegan). She was very sweet and quickly suggested I start to take a look at the menu and walked me to talk to a manager on duty.  The manager took some time to go over a few dishes with me and sauce options for my noodles, even though she was overwhelmingly busy. She basically said to choose any dish, substitute any meat for sautéed tofu instead and that they would be able to make almost any sauce vegan with the exception of like 2 (the menu is so large with 100+ dishes).   Yes, this was probably the most difficult order I've had to place because of the specific ingredients needed to make these type of dishes... but in the end it all worked out. It took my waitress a few times back and forth with the kitchen to really confirm what was in some dishes and if they could be made without a specific ingredient (some things are already pre-made like the milk in the curry sauce they use but other things like the fish sauce on veggies are usually freshly added so can just be easily made without). Thumbs up to the chefs. I may have had to repeat, \"no milk, no eggs, no fish sauce, no honey\".. quite a number of times... but everyone was super nice and accommodating.  Customer service is A+, food is A+, oh and I almost forgot to mention the portions are Large and very reasonably priced !!!! The place is also very clean and the decor and marketing inside is very hip and On point to cater to both, the young modern hipster and the authentic chinese connoisseur, at the same time."}
{"text":"Best Cambodian/Thaï/Vietnamese restaurant in Montreal. Their Phad Thaï is unbeatable and their prices are more than reasonable. I go there about once a week. Their green papaya salad is amazing as well as their Imperial chicken (#70).  It's also BYOB/BYOW"}
{"text":"One of the best Chinese / Vietnamese food in Montreal. Very clean, tasty food. Big restaurant convenient for family or group."}
{"text":"Im half chinese and half cambodian. My parents have grown in Cambodia and this is the one of the rare asian places that they are   willing to go eat!!  This is just to show that its authentic, true to the original asian flavours and oh so yummy.  Prices are also very reasonable and they do take out! Thank u wing phat!"}
{"text":"Good place to eat at.  Great ambiance. Real authentic Chinese restaurant and authentic Chinese-feel to this place.  Food is very good. Very tasty. Recipes have that traditional feel to it.  Complimentary Chinese tea is given to everyone .  Overall very good experience and would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Honnêtement j'avais envie de donner 5 étoiles mais faut dire que c'est bruyant comme endroit !! On dirait presque une cafétéria mais pour ce qui est du service et de la soupe wontong pcq c'est ce que je mange c'est franchement parfait! J'y reviendrai!!"}
{"text":"Best place In area for Chinese. Take out, delivery and in restaurant. Great soups. General Tao is crispy. Peanut butter dumpling are great also. Tried almost all menu. Great place. If your out of delivery range sometimes extra couple of dollars they deliver. Very busy restaurant worth it b"}
{"text":"Decent asian food place, pricey though. Went there a few times with friends for dinner. Last time I went with 2 friends. First of all, this place has no parking spots but street parking can be found fairly easily. We went there on a weekday evening for dinner and were seated right away, with the most of the tables with customers already.   As this place serves a mix of Cambodian, Chinese, Thai and Vietnamese food, I decided to go for the loc lac beef, which a meal consisting of cubes of beef accompanied with tomato sauce fried rice. The quantity was generous and the food itself was tasty. However, I did not feel that it was enough for the price that I paid.   I do not think I will go back to this specific restaurant as the prices are a little too expensive for what they offer. Service however was quick and good."}
{"text":"Delicious Swamp Cabbage veges (rau muon)! Fried fish was overrated, ok. Service slow as it was very busy; have to be proactive to get what you want."}
{"text":"My bf and I frequent this establishment every time we are in the St Leonard area. They serve Asian style dishes and we always order the phom penh dry noodle with soup on the side. It's one of the best in this city. Besides the entire restaurant being fully renovated, clean, and service always great, I seem to notice most employees who work at Asian restaurants in Montreal always seem to be mad that they are working or hate their life etc., but everyone working at Wing Phat seem to be happy! Please give this place a try. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Legit combined Vietnamese and Chinese restaurant. They have one of the best fried rice ever! I ordered the Wing Phat Fried Rice (with added spice) - $8 and it was extremely delicious!   They fried the rice right - each grain of rice is easily identified - not too much oil; and right amount of goodness. (meat, egg, vegetables). We also ordered the wonton soup which was a steal - $4.  We also had Garlic Bak Choy which was super tasty! Very flavourful and portions were reasonable.  Highly recommend this place - I will be back!"}
{"text":"This is an honest review. This place was a letdown to me. After being highly recommended to me, I decided to take my mom there for Mother's day.  The Good: It's hip  It's trendy  It's clean It's got a lot of options They have big screen TV's with sports channels. Free Wifi They are relatively fast, despite being very busy. You won't have to wait very long for food to arrive.  The Bad: -It's a bit expensive for what it is. -Our waitress wasn't the greatest/friendliest -We asked for Thai lobster. We were told that they don't have it...we needed to order regular lobster and needed to pay $4 extra to add Thai seasoning to it  -The salt and pepper squid has thin shreds of squid surrounded by lots of batter. -Normally, when you order soup, it should be served first (before the other dishes)...in our case, it was the last course to arrive (never seen this before in any restaurant anywhere...Italian, Colombian, Mexican, French, Chinese, Thai etc. included). -I'm not sure if this is a milennial thing, as the entire staff is made up of college/university-aged workers, but I'll stick to my old-school Chinese restaurants where I can be guaranteed good food, good service, good prices, and my soup being served first (even if it doesn't come with the bells and whistles that this place offers).  NO THANKS."}
{"text":"This restaurant is very family friendly and is perfect for sharing a warm, hearty meal. Wing Phat is a Vietnamese/Thai/Chinese restaurant that offers plenty of options from lobster to stir-fry vegetables. The best thing to order is the sour/spicy tofu soup. It's amazingly flavourful and is a huge portion which you can share with a group. Everything ordered from the crispy tofu to the stir-fry vegetables was absolutely perfect!    You're not going to get five-star quality service, but the staff is approachable and helpful. The service is quite fast so you won't have to wait too long for your food. It does get pretty crowded for lunch because it's a local favourite. A hidden gem, it's a little out of the way but definitely worth it. Take your family or friends here, they will definitely end up coming back time and time again."}
{"text":"Been here twice and this is just the start of a beautiful thing!!  Wing Phat is a family friend authentic Asian restaurant with Vietnamese, Thai and Chinese cuisine. Their selection is amazing. There are many dishes familiar to the locals but many more of them discoveries from overseas that are fantastic. Looking around while sitting gives you a healthy mix of different ethnicity enjoying their food experience.  The first time I had the Sesame Beef was one of the best dishes I ever had. Their crispy chicken was amazing... simply decadent. Their morning glory veggie dish was a great foodie experience. We had a number of noodle dishes are they're all good. Nothing disappointed. Nothing. Excellent food, can't wait to go back with friends! Excellent for sharing. Menu has pictures, smart.  Service was good but slow the first time we went around 7-9PM. Line-up was about 30 minutes as they were incredibly busy, the second time we hit it early and we didn't even wait and the food we got was real quick. I smiled when I left seeing the 50+ people waiting to sit down."}
{"text":"Delicious food and great variety.  Spacious and large dining area.  Only hiccup was that I received my meal about 10 minutes before my dinner companion.  I had to ask the waitress if we had been forgotten.  She was very apologetic and reassured us that his meal was on the way.   I imagine it is not a regular occurrence since most reviews highly praise the quality of the service.   I would eat there again."}
{"text":"This restaurant never disappoints! A BYOW with delicious dishes. What more can you ask for? I would definately recommend their Loc Lac Beef , beef papaya salad and their seafood soup. The service is pretty quick. Friday and Saturday nights can be quite busy but the restaurant is quite spacious.  This restaurant is one of the best asian restaurants in the east end. A MUST TRY!"}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the plain looking outside .Nice big restaurant, always clean, service friendly and speak fluent english.Great prices, tasty food in generous portions. FYI , it gets very busy!"}
{"text":"Good classic comfort food.  Affordable prices."}
{"text":"I must say that this place never disappoint. The service is courteous and fast and the food is on point! Since i don't live in the area, i tend to come here on the weekend. It's always full! This time i came with my mom to have her try this place. She loved it!! We were lucky enough to get the last siu mai, a tender, juicy meatball nestled in a delicious broth. You usually order a fried beignet with it (i don't know what it's called but the picture is right next to the siu mai). I believe the owner(s) are cambodian but you get vietnamese, chinese, thai, cambodian food and trust me, it's all good! Did i mention that the menu is a \"photo\" menu? Yesss! Pictures so you know what you're ordering. So cool! I love it! When given the choice, i suggest you choose the large portion. You get a better deal! Go. Go try this place out!"}
