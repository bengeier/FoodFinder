{"text":"If I don't get home made lunch at any day this is the place I go, no exceptions. The best fast food in the area. Get the grilled chicken before he runs out of it everyday, that is the best.

{"text":"I'm actually a fan of the food here. But the truck is so flaky when it comes to location/timing. I go to 900 West Trade St. at 1PM and there is no truck in sight. I know that I'm in the right location too because I've seen the truck and purchased food from that exact location at the same time before. I wouldn't really even care if they had inconsistent hours if there was a way to check if they were open or their current location. But nothing. Thanks for having me make the trek with hungry coworkers to find absolutely nothing."}
{"text":"Delicious food!!! One of the best spots I have been to, their serving sizes are amazing!! for the price and staff very friendly. I would definitely!recommend to try their bbq'ed lamb chops and chicken those are one of my favorites and their specials. Check it out if you're ever in town, it's one of the most famous fast foods of New York and I am surprised to see it here in North Carolina ."}
{"text":"One of the best gyro food cart. One day I was passing by Trade street and noticed this food cart and stop there to try their food. I ordered lamb gyro with three different sauces and it turned out very testy  and the lamb gyro was juicy and mouthwatering. I will definitely come back for more and recommend other to try their lamb gyro and chicken over rice. They make good falafel for vegetarians. Whenever I go downtown, I can't think to eat anything else than their mouthwatering gyro. They offer affordable yet testy food."}
{"text":"Got the mixed chicken and beef over rice.. with lots of white sauce for $8. My friend and I split this and were so full after. It's delicious and filled with meat.. so you definitely get your money's worth. The guys here will put as much of as little sauce as you request. Cash only! And one of the only options for late night eats in the area."}
