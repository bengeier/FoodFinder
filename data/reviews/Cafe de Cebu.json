{"text":"I've been to Cafe de Cebu a couple of times now. Even when they were still by Rainbow. It's pretty much like a go to place where you miss home (Philippines) and you want to taste authentic Filipino food, feel the Pinoy vibe, chill eat some awesome Lechon, this is the spot right here! So, when cafe de cebu reopened their store by Jones (which is great btw, because they have a bigger place and space for some dancing and open mic nights), we went here two nights in a row!! Friday and Saturday night!! Flipside5 band was rocking the house yo!! Great ambiance!! Art works were nice. Wish it was more on the Filipino side. But all in all, our experience was wonderful and definitely out new hang out spot for some Pinoy vibe! Thumbs up! And did I mention they have bomb ass food?? Haha! Come and chill at Cafe de Cebu! You will have the time of your Filipino life!"}
{"text":"First & the last time I will come to this place!!! Never in my life that I got refuse as a customer to eat in a restaurant because \"they don't have anyone to cook the food\". Unfortunately, the cook was on break and no one can cook our food! Seriously???!!!  Maybe next time they will ask you to get the food in the kitchen because they don'thave a server!!! Too bad i have to put at least 1 star! I would rather give this place a 0 star!!!!"}
{"text":"Very expensive, not worth the small portions given. If you regularly eat good Filipino food, this is at best, tolerable. My parents cook Filipino food ten times better. I've never had Cebuano food before, and I'm probably not going to try it again.  Gulaman was at least good."}
{"text":"On our last day in Vegas, a friend took us to have lunch and say our goodbyes. Their specialty is the Lechon Cebu. We ordered the whole belly.All 10 lbs if it. It was huge. There was 11 of us .We were not able to finish it, maybe because we also ordered the milkfish, the sinigang broth, the chicharon bulaklak. Everything tasted good although it lacked the signature taste that will define them from the rest of the businesses.That is why I am inly rating it 4 stars. If they add some twist to it, they could be a 5. The ube cheesecake was a first for me and it was good.The calamansi juice was perfect for the hot Vegas weather"}
{"text":"What can I say except... Worth every mile and penny to get here! Food is fresh and not re-heated that some places unfortunately are notorious in doing. The staff is so friendly especially Eileen, she was so helpful in suggesting what to try and not forceful at all which I appreciate. A definite go-to place when you visit Las Vegas and want some authentic Filipino Cebuano dishes! Oh yeah, you have to try the isaw!!! Better than the one from UP Diliman (for those local to Manila you know what this means!) good job!!"}
{"text":"My family from California is spending a long weekend and brought them here to try their famous Lechon, everyone was happy and satisfied, we ordered laing which we requested spicy, kaldereta, ginataang kuhol and it was superb, we also ordered bangus but we want to make it a little interesting so we chose to make it sisig style which my cousins love. We also ordered lechon and as usual they serve it with their homemade liver sauce. It was so flavorful,we don't need to go to Philippines just to have this taste of Cebu. They have a lot of specials posted on their board and can't wait to try them all. I hope it isnt too late when I come back for their specials. For dessert, ube cheesecake is the best and halo-halo is worth the price a lot of ingredients are put into it with ube ice cream ."}
{"text":"We tried the lechon and it was heavenly. Eating here brings back memories of home cooking back in the Philippines. Will surely be back!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed! This is our second visit to Cafe de Cebu. First was in the old place and this is our first on this location.   This place is a 100 degrees turn around from the first location. The kitchen is in front left side as you get in the eating area , and as soon as you go in you can smell what's being prepared in the kitchen. When we get into the restaurant , I smelled an uncooked smelly pig smell. It smelled ' MALANSA' in Tagalog !  Eww and in that moment my appetite just went down from 100 to ZeRo..  There's a band equipment in the front and we were told later that they now have  karaoke at night! In the middle of the room in front of the band is a  seating area made of wood pallets and the seats are padded, but still didn't impress me. The eating tables lined up against the wall and the bench are so hard and uncomfortable to sit on. Whoever designed it should be fired !  Now let's discuss about the food! We ordered the lechon belly;  this is the reason we came back to Cafe this Cebu, because when we first tasted it at the first location , we fall in love with it. It was crispy and sizzling hot. This time, it was at room temperature and the skin was leathery. We ordered a 1/2 pound which cost $8.00, not worthed at all . We were very disappointed. We also ordered Pinakbet worth $7.00/order. When our order was served, my hubby and I looked at each other and I said 'That's it?' Lol. Very poor presentation on both dishes.  To sum it up, Big disappointment! We'll not come back and not recommended at all! Sorry but not sorry!"}
{"text":"Had a terrible experience here. Will probably never come back. It seems they want to offer the same poor quality service and food as if they were still in the Philippines. The seating is terrible. It was hot inside as if they couldn't afford to turn on the air conditioner. The food took forever to arrive at the table. And there were several things on the menu that were just not available at all. We were 1 of about 3 tables dining at that time but the service was so slow. I'm not sure what image they are trying to go for but it's not good. The old location was so much better."}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed Cafe de Cebu's amazing food. From their small little restaurant that they started, this new and bigger place is just WOW! I am not surprised that this business got bigger and better. I always come to them for my Filipino food cravings. The dishes are always on point and by far one of the better places to go for Filipino Cuisine in Las Vegas.  I am a fan of their Lechon, consistently crispy and yummy. The Bagoong Rice is another winner and the Isaw is something I always order. I try to order something new everytime I visit and my family enjoys coming here with me.  Doj is great! Very friendly and we love his customer service. Always a pleasure to talk to and recommends the best dishes to order.  Cafe de Cebu does not dissappoint. A must when in Vegas."}
{"text":"Love the food and place. Last Saturday 7/29 we had our group reunion, started with good service.  They announced the Group Aegis is coming for a dinner. They immediately stopped the karaoke singing and music minutes before they arrive and the time when they are having dinner. The reason , Aegis group is tired with the recent performance.  They should have close the place  to accommodate the group and for us the local patron not to enjoy our dancing and singing. We will not come back there anymore.  Remember these locals are your clients and will be your regulars."}
{"text":"Very disappointed!! Lots of food in the menu was not available, 3 lbs Lechon all served cold, \" malamig daw kasi sa kusina \" No pusit, no chopsuey, no ice tea, no San Mig Light Hot water ordered not available too!!! Kare-kare , parang desserts too sweet"}
{"text":"we came here to have a late lunch... interesting because they just started their happy hour... I ordered my favorite chicharon bulaklak and crispy calamari for half a price, my son loves lumpia and we ordered 2 for the price of 1. We ordered lechon belly and dinuguan. I love their food and the place is so nice. Great customer service!!! will definitely comeback with friends during dinner coz they have a band every weekends"}
{"text":"Great food and excellent service! Dj and karaoke entertainment was fun. Definitely a place to hang out to eat, drink, and have fun! Perfect venue for parties. Lechon belly was the best. I would definitely recommend this place! Cafe de Cebu is 10 stars in my book!!!"}
{"text":"We are in search of a new Filipino Restaurant and my sister found Cafe de Cebu on line, the pictures look okay and the food selection is alright, as so we thought! We have a reservation for 8 adults; friends from San Diego. My sister and I was there 1/2 an hour early noticed some 4 tables with guest got seated, in about 30 min the waitress came and ask if we need something to drink, I ordered hot tea and sister ordered mango juice which is NOT available, water then is fine. My tea was served later in a coffee mug, no sugar or honey or any sweetener so I ask for sugar, about 20 min later she gave me sugar in a small cup. We read the menu and most of them are all marked with black marker, NO LONGER AVAILABLE. The famous lechon is NOT AVAILABLE UNTIL 9:30 PM! reason: we RUN OUT earlier! We ordered as if we haven't eaten for weeks, almost everything on the menu. Good thing!!!! because their family size is not even enough for a single hungry Filipino on a diet!! I thought we are in a tapas place where servings are all appetizer size. I am not a good cook but I can tell when a Filipino food is good, and the food came lukewarm almost cold!!! For the price we paid it's NOT WORTH IT!!!!! Love the idea of the live band but please it's sooo loud we got out of there deaf. NOT COMING BACK FOR SURE!!!!"}
{"text":"The good reviews was the reason we came here with great expectation, it was a failure, first only one person serves the customers we have to wait for some time to get our orders, second , most of the food we wanted on the menu are not available, third, when our food arrived the rice was cold  talk about reheated rice from the refrigerator... the sinigang was ok , bicol express was not to my palate. no am not coming back here. Sorry."}
{"text":"I saw this restaurant on yelp and since we were celebrating my friend's birthday, we decided to give this place a try. We called the owner to reserve for 20-25 people and ordered a head of time. We were greeted on the phone courteously and the owner was very nice. Over all, we had a great time! The food wasn't that great but good. The band was great. My friends did karaoke with them and had a blast."}
{"text":"The lechon is amazing but the lechon sauce is a disappointment.  The DJ and waitresses are great!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday night at prime dinner time and we were the only table there. We were still the only table there when we left. 2 out of the 3 things we tried to order, they didn't have. So honestly, what kinda impression does that make? It'll be a long time before I'd give it another shot."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever!!!!!!! Spent over $60 for mediocre food and waited over 30 minutes for a very tiny cup half full taho, what a joke!!!! Never coming back here again and telling everyone I know to never ever come here!!!!!!! I wish I could put zero stars, so disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"first time i went, i'm impressed with the set up of the restaurant, we're assuming the food is good, but when they brought the food, wasn't satisfied @ all. pansit was horrible and the sisig was burnt.  management wise, very unprofessional!!! don't dare plan any event in this place. if ever you decide, goodluck on getting your money back!!!   i won't recommend this place @ all..."}
{"text":"Saw this place on yelplv, pictures look so pretty and yummy.  So when I was in LV for my college reunion I brought my friend/classmate to try this place. I was   disappointed ."}
{"text":"I love their new location. Its open, modern, and did i mention the food is awesome. This is a good place for some drinks and great Filipino food. Its good for me!"}
{"text":"great job dodgie ! congrats! i would definitely recommend this place. best filipino food!                     brookshields"}
{"text":"Haven't tasted lechon so close to home! the best!!! Aileen is great too. The ambiance is really great for friends and Family."}
{"text":"SUPER HORRIBLE.. Food was not as expected.  Service was Horrible. You have to walk up to the waitress to ask for drinks, have to ask her for dessert. And very limited dessert btw.  No wonder the place was empty when we got here"}
{"text":"Service was horrible.  Waited for 20 minutes for them to tell us they didn't have our food.  40 minutes later they tell us they don't have the order we switched to. Waste of time"}
{"text":"too bad we can't give them 0 score! never host a party here ever!!! they will scam you! you guys know what you did.  karma will get you back. 4K for this?? 3hr. + $44/ head that's how much my they charged her...   & they told her to make it 3 instead of 4  Please don't take advantage of people"}
{"text":"I am from Cebu and had high expectations when I came. I have to say the flavor of the food we ordered brought me back home.  The lechón was fresh and crispy and oozed of flavor.  The pork skewers were quite delicious with a bit of a sweet tan to it.  The garlic fried rice was the perfect complement to our dishes.  We also ordered siomai and lumpia shanghai that was quite excellent. They only had one server and it was quite busy which is why I gave it 4 stars.  Hope to come back next time."}
{"text":"My niece had her Birthday Party here. Food is great and we had music, karaoke, and it was really fun! Love their lumpia and lechon"}
{"text":"This place is always the best part of my Las Vegas Trips. My whole family and I make sure we stop by every time we are in Vegas. The Lechon is a must try. Very juicy and crispy, always on point!  Doj is great and remembers the customers all the time. We feel at home when we come to Cafe de Cebu. Wonderful service and great food!"}
{"text":"The food was not that great to be honest... was kinda disappointed. When u think of Cebu great food and super yummy lechon... but the lechon we ordered was not good at all... the sinigang n hipon was not sour enough and doesn't have enough ingredients. The sisig bangus was so wet and was expecting it more crispy and a little dry then what we had last night and binagoonang rice was so-so... to be honest didn't enjoy the food last night... place was nice they a dj last night and can req a song for u to sing."}
{"text":"If only we can give a 0-star rating for this restaurant or double thumbs down!!! We chose this place for a very special occasion but we made the biggest mistake! We trusted the wrong people....  If you want to host your party here, better make a written contract because what they'll promise you will never happen.  We were so disappointed about the slow service and the quality of food.  It was expensive but I thought it will be worth it.  I was so wrong! During our event, we were so dismayed because despite pre-ordering for a lot of people (we even got extra extra food) still they served us so little.  We had no choice but to order more because we were still expecting some guests.  Unbelievable!  Also, it took them a long time refilling the food trays.  The next batches of food served did not taste good at all... The pancit was salty and doesn't taste fresh.  The egg rolls I had were not even cooked on the inside and just tasted like it was bought from the frozen section of an asian store.  Other people who got to taste the turon said it was not even crunchy and the bananas used were not ripe, etc. The quantity and quality of the food we got were so not worth the price.  Our special celebration was ruined because of this restaurant.  We spent the following days apologizing to our guests about the very very poor service.  I cannot believe this happened to us!  We made a major mistake that will haunt us forever, please don't make yours by going to this place."}
{"text":"The server was great she kept a smile on her face the whole time and assisted our needs but the food was just bad. The sinigang didnt tasted like sinagang at all and the lechon tasted like if it was reheated. Im so disappointed not worth the money at all."}
{"text":"We had a big group  from chicago come  sunday  lastnight.. i was very impressed  with their menu selection and fast friendly service. Very cool ambience.. The Bangus Sisig is my favorite.  Joy , who waited our 2 tables was very professional and friendly....Thumbs Up !!"}
{"text":"The BEST Kare Kare everrrrrr (sorry mom), oops hahaha. Seriously tho ~must try~ Anyway, I'm usually skeptical when it comes to Filipino restaurants simply because there are so many styles to cook the dishes depending on the different Filipino provinces/islands, also because most Filipino restaurants tend to be more on the oily side as well as on your he pricier end too. Well, Casa de Cebu is great. They relocated from their Flamingo location and this location is so nicely put together! The interior design and beautiful and they do occasional live performances and they have a nice lounge-y area in the middle of the restaurant for that.   In my opinion, this new location is much better, but the service in the original location was better before. I've been to the old location twice and the owner and the servers they had seemed much more happier and kind to customers whereas I've been to this new location 3 times because the Kare Kare just doesn't compare to anywhere else, but each time I've had this one lady seat and serve us and each time she just didn't really care, nor smile... yannoe basic customer service. So eh kinda takes away from the experience so that's why I knocked a star out. Otherwise it's a pretty solid Filipino joint!  Must try: KARE KARE, Lechon belly, Turon dessert with ube ice cream!!"}
{"text":"Completely different from the first location. Chairs were too high, too hard and the tables too far and too low. You couldn't move either of them. Nearby tables had not been cleaned. It was as hot inside as it was outside. 4 different menu items were not available. They only had sprite and Diet Coke. Our food took so long too. We ordered lechon sisig and Bicol express, and this was after we were told that 4 different menu items weren't available. Me and my fiancé could only hope that the food was amazing. Unfortunately it wasn't.   Ordered ngohiong for appetizers. It was very bland. The server hands me a small cup that was stained and wet. I kind of stared at it for a while wondering if it was dirty. I didn't want to be difficult, I seriously thought she gave me a dirty cup.  She also suggested to use vinegar. So I didn't bother asking for ngohiong sauce - which isn't vinegar by the way. At this time I just wanted to eat and didn't care for a good dining experience.  The lechon sisig which was recommended by the server wasn't hot nor warm. You'd think it would be sizzling if it was on a sizzling plate.  Bicol express wasn't great.  We didn't bother getting dessert.  I hate leaving a bad review but this place was uncomfortable and disappointing."}
{"text":"Reading all the reviews I was so excited to try this place out . I brought my mom with me and we were impressed with the place. Nice customer service.  We ordered: fried  bituka- good love this  Lechon - salty and burnt didn't taste at all like what leeching is suppose to be. Kare kare -shockingly sweet very sweet  Bicol express- decent   Disappointed with the food. Not good at all like the reviews said, not even close except for the fried bituka. I would not recommend this place at all to eat, not worth the money"}
{"text":"Service was trash and food was real salty. I'll give them credit for having a good ube cheesecake though. I wouldn't come back here again and I don't recommend this place unless you only go for the cheesecake"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time and it has a really cool vibe inside. They have a DJ and they do karaoke competitions. Inside is very spacious with a dance floor. We ordered the Café De Cebu Fried RIce and Kare Kare. I was lowkey disappointed with the menu because they do not have a lot of food to choose from. But the fried rice was delicious with the bits and pieces of lechon in there and the kare kare was very flavorful. I would come back here and try something else off the menu."}
{"text":"They have changed menu and there's not a really much to choose from now... Worst thing is we asked for regular water (tap) and the servers says that they don't recommend their water making you feel you have no choice but to buy a bottle water or their drinks that cost much if your a big party. There's one table next to us that brought water with them. If I only knew They should fix their water system. I paid 10$ for a water that I could have spent for another meal."}
{"text":"We are a group of 8 so obviously we ordered a lot. The lechon, we had to return it and exchange because we couldn't chew it as if it was heated several times. The grillled liempo taste burnt because it was really burnt. The lechon sisig was so spicy that the server didn't warn us that it will be hot or ask what level of hotness we want. The rice was so mushy. The beer was outrageously pricey. $8 for one beer. They are a total fail on food quality."}
{"text":"The Lechon sisig was not the usual sizzling crispy Lechon pieces and it was heavenly laden with onions and star anise, or some type of Chinese 5 spice.  The bagaong fried rice needed a little more frying and maybe added pieces of binagoongaan meat. The scrambled egg was burned. The diced  green mango pieces were great! The Lechon belly meat also lacked the crispy skin and it was seasoned with star anise, or some type of Chinese 5 spice. The Mang Thomas sauce was a sad grey colored mess that tasted as such. The Pinakbet was very soupy; no bitter melon, squash, or meat or shrimp. Just green snap beans and eggplant. The green snap beans were crisp.  We will not be back. We will continue going to D'Pinoy."}
{"text":"A friend visiting from LA wanted to try this place after finding out they serve nghiong.  A Cebuano appetizer that is rarely served in Filipino restaurants and of course the Cebuano Lechon known for the best tasting roasted pig. Came here for lunch, got seated immediately.  The interior had industrial touches combined with natural wood. It is a casual and clean restaurant. My friend ordered the nghiong (the reason why we came here.) Our server came back saying they ran out. Oookaaay?! We moved on to ordering the next favorite veggie dish on the menu, then the server came back telling us they run out of the veggie dish. Oookaaay?! This is not looking good. So we opted for another dish.  My friend and I were looking at each other hoping that the rest of the dishes we ordered will be amazing and driving here from Henderson was worth our time.  Our server started bringing in the food and we definitely had a little feast on our table. The chicken tinola soup was a little salty but the chicken was tender and cooked perfectly. The Cebu Lechon tasted amazing, my friend who ordered chicharon bulaklak was having a blast! It tasted crunchy and barely greasy. I could have rated this place a 5 star, but running out of favorite dishes on the menu is not an excuse for not having them on a weekend. There's a lot of popular and favorite Cebuano dishes that could have been added to the menu. The menu has limited choices.  OVERALL:  Pro: dishes we ordered were delicious Con: not a lot of choices on the menu; running out of popular dishes, that's a no no!"}
{"text":"Reasonable prices with heartful serving and everything tasted amazing. The dishes remind me of good 'ol cooking at my hometown Cebu. The owner was very accomodating. The chicken with malunggay soup is a must-try. This place is our go-to restaurant when visiting Vegas"}
{"text":"Lechon, Lechon, Lechon!  This should be the first thing you order.  You can order the Lechon belly by 1/2 or full pound.   It tasted delicious and had plenty pieces of crunchy pig skin.   Also ordered the boneless bangus, Lechon sisig, Lechon sinigang, adobong fried rice.    Wasn't a huge fan of the sisig it was more onions that anything else but everything else was tasty.     The service was quite slow for the restaurant not being busy at all.   There was one waitress who seemed to be doing too many things.    They have large tables for family seating and a cool lounge sofa area in the middle of the restaurant to listen to live music."}
{"text":"I love the steak with butter on top I forgot what it's called but it tasted great (the portion is huge but tasty nonetheless) This is one of the only places in Vegas where you get delicious Filipino lechon pork which a must-try dish for meat aficionados ."}
{"text":"The cook should go back to cebu n get the real taste of cebu, very poor service, ordered coke as my drink n they served it with a disposable plastic glass, no table napkins, food in menu not always available, its a disgrace to my birth place!"}
{"text":"Worse place ever,  for $8.00 you get 5 pieces of squid, poor service,  spent $40.00 AND ZERO satisfaction.   Still hungry as if I didn't eat anything. I won't be going back to this place and I don't recommend anyone going to this place.  If you're planning a trip to Cebu in the Philippines do not attempt to eat at this restaurant or you will be disappointed you may not want to go to Cebu  You're better off going to all you can eat sushi kitchen of Lorraine on Ann road better tasting food and cheaper"}
{"text":"I'm loving the new place. Great place to get lechon belly!! Save room for dessert!! You won't regret!!"}
{"text":"My friends and I were here on a Saturday night. Live bad was amazing but the SERVICE WAS HORRIBLE. Waited 40 minutes for them to even notice us and another 40 minutes for them to serve the food. Why do they only have 2 servers on a Saturday night?? On top of that they were kinda pricey for a so-so taste. Even the beers were expensive. They don't serve any cocktails, just beers and wine. Overall it was such a TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE and we won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I wanted to score them with 5 stars but the place' ambiance needs improvement. Its understandable coz they just moved to this new location. Improve the restaurant's interior and it will be perfect. Nevertheless it is still my highly recommended place for out-of-town friends seeking good authentic Filipino food. Lechon belly is still very popular here. Ginataang kuhol is also a favorite. Aside from a much bigger place as compared to the old location, they also have nightly live bands performing."}
{"text":"The staff and management team of Cafe De Cebu are the most wonderful, sweetest and friendliest people! We hosted a reception for members of our professional industry and I couldn't be happier! Everything worked out great and planning was so easy, this is really helpful as I was planning from the Bay Area, CA. Dodjie the restaurant manager was a pleasure to work with, we had specific requests for how we'd like the food to be served and the CdC team executed perfectly. Aileen and the rest of the staff were very efficient and helpful. The crispy tofu was yummy and the ube cheesecake was heaven. I would definitely be back the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Cozy and comfy atmosphere. The food is delicious and the acoustics are great, probably due to the open rafters and generally square shape of the space. They serve beer only, for now. Thanks for the wonderful time! We'll definitely be back..."}
{"text":"Lechon here is more delicious than the Lechon I had in Cebu.  I must say that it is the Best Filipino Restaurant in Vegas. dishes are cooked and prepared when ordered. superb food selection and great service. cool place  Ube cheesecake and Halo- halo, a must try. their lunch specials are available during weekdays and very affordable."}
{"text":"Before anything else, let me just say that this review is mainly for the bad service and not the quality of the food.  The lechon was superb and it exceeded our expectations. However, the lack of courtesy on their end was so disappointing and unprofessional that I am forced to give them a 1-star review.  My friend pre-ordered a lechon and informed them that we would pick it up on Dec 24, 6pm. That morning, my friend called a couple of times to make sure that the order would be ready by dinner time. Since no one was picking up, we decided to stop by around 4 just to check if they were open. The lady said that it was not yet ready and advised us to come back at 6.   When we got back, they said the oven was not working and they made us wait for another 2hrs without really telling us what time our order would be ready. We kept asking her to give us an estimate  and she never gave us a straight answer. Instead, she kept walking away to call the owner. She also gave us a lot of attitude and kept asking if our order was intended for dinner (6pm) or noche buena (12mn), so we got the feeling that they probably forgot our order. Finally, when we spoke with Roy, he asked us if we wanted to change our order to something else. Obviously, we came for the lechon so we said no and told him it was embarrassing for us to go to our friend's potluck EMPTY HANDED. Only then did he offer to give us free BBQ (which we really appreciated btw) and said that they would deliver the order to our friend's house in about an hour. We got Roy's number so we could get an update from him, but he never picked up our calls. He just sent us an ETA that was actually 45mins late.   The owner arrived with our order around 10pm, but it seemed like he was in a hurry and gave us the most insincere apology.  Mind you, it took them 4hrs to deliver the food---which is approximately how long it would take to roast a lechon, so you do the math.   I just wish that they would give better service to other customers on New Year's Eve."}
{"text":"We attended a party here a couple weeks ago. We got there half an hour after it started. As we were getting our food, we noticed that the trays were already over half empty. There was only spaghetti which had one spoonful left in the tray, pancit, bbq, rice, and chopsuey on the table. Our first thoughts were maybe, our friend chose the most least expensive package as we all know cafe de cebu can be expensive. The staff failed to even refill the food trays promptly. They brought out a small basket of lechon twice which was enough to serve about 6 people. So anyway, as the party progressed, we found out that my friend was charged $4,200 for 76 people on this 3 hour party. I was flabbergasted! Honestly, the quality, selection, and the size of the food entrees served to us would not even be worth $1k. They served us egg rolls towards the end, small servings of cold lechon, spaghetti, chix/beef bbq, rice, pansit, chopsuey, and turon for dessert. Really???!! Even Nanay Gloria's $140 package is more food than that! Taking in consideration you had to close your restaurant for 3 hours to accommodate this party, it was still way overpriced! For $4,200, you can bring your party to Brio or Cheesecake Factory and get better food, location, and service! Do NOT do your parties here!"}
{"text":"This restaurant have really good food and ambiance is nice too.  Decor is unique & interesting.  I like to come here but the only thing that makes me hesitate is that service is painfully SLOW!!! People seem nice but extremely SLOW!!!! I wish it gets better..Don't come here if you're hungry"}
{"text":"After a play, I stopped in for dinner.  It's an interesting place with picnic table-like dining.  As with most Filipino restaurants, it's best to come with a group because portions are large and you want to try different things.  I was looking forward to the lechon but when I saw that the smallest portion was 8 ounces, I decided to hold off on that until I come with a family who adopts me or a group of friends.  Instead of eating too much, I opted for a small starter of Ngo-yong, deep freind palm heart flavored with Chinese 5 spice powder.  There was a dipping sauce served with it that had the wonderful five spice flavors.  A very good start and a smaller starter.  For the main course, I got the kare-kare.  The beef in this traditional Filipino stew was tasty and came off the bone easily and the \"gravy\" of the stew was very good especially when mixed with some of the shrimp paste served with the stew.    For dessert, I went with the turon with ice cream.  Two small banana filled, fried spring rolls with the yam ice cream.  It was a good ending to the meal.  Service was very good and the young woman answered all my questions.  With the tab;e set up being like family picnic tables, I wouldn't come back solo during busy times and I think I'd avoid evenings when there's music.  I'll have to plan my return carefully."}
{"text":"The Lechon is excellent.  Lumpia is really good.  The new location is decorated nicely.  The location is convenient to the Spring Mountain Asian corridor.  Plenty of parking.  Friendly service.  The food was cooked within 10 minutes tops.  It's a relatively limited menu, but what they have is very good.  I noticed they have lunch specials which I will try next time."}
{"text":"Since my wife is Cebuano and since I lived in her town on Mindano for a couple of years, we were excited to be able to get lechon and other Bisayan food during our trip to Las Vegas.  We took our son with us since the only filipino food he has ever had is pancit and lumpia.  He's a sous chef at a high end restaurant in The Cosmopolitan in Las Vegas.  He tried the lechon and lumpia but wouldn't even touch the other stuff.    The lechon was fatty and not good.  We also ordered a kind of sweet style adobo which turned out to be overcooked tough chunks of pork in a bowl of colored water.  We also ordered dinuguan - the worst we've ever had.   Some of the reviews mention that the decor is \"authentic\".  Since it was a cold, dark, warehouse-like room with zero charm and loud acid rock blaring the whole time, I can only wonder where the reviewers had been in the past that led them to label this \"authentic\".  Never again."}
{"text":"Their Lechon is the the most delicious lechon in town! That taste bring me back home to the Philippines. A must try! Its is crunchy, delightful and very much flavorful."}
{"text":"Great place to hang with live music and open mic. Their specialty is the Cebu lechon which is tasty and delectable with or without its skin. Their ube cheesecake is the bomb! It's utterly creamy and velvety smooth, not too sweet, serving size is just right. Every bite is indeed an indulgence! I've had it after 2 glasses of cabernet to wash off the taste of the red wine and it was just perfect!   It is quite a small lounge, with simple interiors , perfect for those night-caps. We were there Saturday night and waited about an hour to be seated. It was worth the wait! I've heard this place gets crowded on Friday nights too.   And their customer service? It's excellent! I love Aileen, she doesn't see to get tired and has always served us with smile on her face. Not to mention that she sings well too! Cafe de Cebu treats every guest as friends and family. No wonder, people stay longer and they kept coming back!   This is a must when in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Food is not good  and the serving is super small Thats why im giving it 1 star, they only have one server for everyone at the time which is ugggghhh .. but for the ambience ill give it 5 stars because theres live performers while you eat and the place is nice.."}
{"text":"It's a brand new place with nice dining area. There's a lounging area where you can sit while the band is performing (I guess). We went on a weekday lunch and the place was not busy at all. Giving 3 stars mainly because of the quality of food. We ordered  sago, gulaman - it has a weird taste, like it's an old sago. It wasn't right.  Sinigang na hipon (shrimp).. not the typical Sinigang, it lacks flavor (sourness).  Lechon sisig, chopsuey and  isaw was okay.  The service was good, the waitress was very nice. I'm not sure if we will be back."}
{"text":"They served us lechon from the fridge it was cold mortal sin never again more of a stinking spot than anything else"}
{"text":"Awesome new location with live music, great food and ice cold drinks. If you haven't been to this place better come down and check it out. They have open mic and live bands nightly. Order Roasted pork belly (Lechon) and some ice cold San Miguel beer Pilsen served in chilled glass."}
{"text":"Just got here been sitting for 20mins but haven't been asked about what I wanted to drink. Isn't that the first rule when you go to a restaurant or am I asking too much? Ha ha  Ok so our drink (finally) and food got served. We had Tinolang Manok first, it was really oily that the only taste I could distinguish was the oil. The chicken was really fatty which made the soup a lot more oily.  The lechon belly came with the garlic rice and Laing. The lechon belly was dry, cold, and the skin was burnt. I like lechon so much and I've tried the original lechon belly from Cebu. However, after having tried this place, I think this is the worst place for lechon. You're better off making your own roasted pork to be honest. The lechon we got served were just all fat! My mouth was extremely oily!   Then the Laing was decent. But the rice! OMG! It was garlic salt and SOY SAUCE! It was like eating rice with soy sauce. Horrible!  Finally we tried the Turon. The banana was unripe and all I could taste in my mouth was the sap. If you're looking for a nice place with good food this is NOT THE PLACE TO GO! Rather, go eat at a Filipino grocery store, you'll probably get a better quality from there!   Very disappointed here. Well, now I know not to rely on Yelp reviews... look at a restaurant first and see how empty the place is before you decide to eat there. Very sad..."}
{"text":"Good place to chill with friends and have some drinks/food. My favorite is one of the most popular filipino pulutan (food/snacks provided as an accompaniment to alcoholic drinks) and that is chicharon bulaklak (fried pork mesentery) dipped in vinegar with a lot of red onions and garlic.... And of course their famous roasted pork belly! Yummm!  There's also a live band playing wherein you can request some songs to be played for u. Feels like home in here!"}
{"text":"Cafe Cebu came highly recommended from friends on Yelp, so when I came to Vegas trying it was on the top of my to do list. I am so extremely happy I did! Dining with someone from PI whose dad's hometown is Cebu,  our expectations were high, and Cafe Cebu delivered.   A word of Filipino food wisdom for those Yelpers who have not been to PI or are used to places like Goldie Locks... This is authentic Filipino food and is not white washed. The sauces are homemade and the food is not washed out to accommodate the American palate. That's what makes this restaurant so special!   1.) Milk Fish Sisig: Fried milk fish is a staple of Filipino food. This dish was made to perfection. You cannot eat here and not try it!   2.) Lechon Pork Belly: the lechon sauce is made from scratch. I've never had sauce made this way except at home. The lechon is tender and the skin is crispy and delicate. It practically melts in your mouth.   3.) Kare Kare: One of the best I've ever had   4.) Adobo Fried Rice: The serving is very generous. The adobo is tender and the fried rice is made perfectly. Even though it already has egg in it, I added an over easy egg on top. Perfection!  5.) Ube Cheesecake & Buko Pandan: Try them both. The buko is perfection in a glass and the Ube Cheesecake is like non other you've ever had...there's a special surprise on the bottom.   Bottom line, do not miss Cafe Cebu if you are in the Vegas area. You will be doing yourself a great disservice. The owners and staff here truly care about the food and their customers and will make sure you have an amazing dining experience."}
{"text":"Try out Full House BBQ and other filipino spots before considering this place! The ambient of the restaurant is about the only thing that's nice about this place. The garlic rice is sucks (it was like white rice mixed with soy sauce and garnished with already fried garlic). The  oil used for lechon and isaw was yellowish orange already and you can taste it.  The fish ball was exactly the one you can buy from the market freezer and they use an egg roll sauce to dip it with! Everything was short cut here. We were the only ones at the time we visited and was so shocked how expensive their disgusting food was! We went to Goldilocks the next day and was delicious in comparison to this place!!! Don't make the same mistake as us! Try a different filipino food place!"}
{"text":"I went here accompanying a party who ordered appetizers and other food. My cousins and I ordered our own entrees which was enough to feed 4 people each. Cafe de Cebu fried rice was amazing and so was the kare kare and sinigang. We managed to swipe a bowl of lumpia, calamari, and fried rice from our parents who were part of a reunion party there. They were great.   The sisig was too spicy and I wish they would've mentioned that to us. My husband is vegan so they had nothing for him to eat, but they were understanding to let him go out and bring outside food. I would come back again."}
{"text":"We love it here! Specially the Humba! And lechon! Cheesecake too :-) highly recommended! Dodjie is so friendly too.."}
{"text":"Good serving portions ! Reasonable price !! Good food !!! Friendly service ;-) really happy to see more customers coming in ... more power to CdC"}
{"text":"I'm not impress w/the food,I order adobo fried rice its taste like w/fish or w/adobong bangus,ginataang langka so sour too much vinegar.place are nice n cozy.lechonnis good skin is crunchy."}
{"text":"First thought once I walked in was \"Wow, place looks amazing!\" Cafe De Cebu definitely outdid themselves with this new spot. Tables are much larger for you big family, there is a lot of beautiful art everywhere to feed your sight, the dance floor is spacey, there is space for live entertainment and the same great delicious food!    From what I hear, there will be izakaya! Japanese tapas are always the bomb so I can't wait for that! Might be during dinner time only tho.   Guys, order the isaw!! Its the best thing next to the boneless lechon! Ugh. The isaw is prepared on skewers and its lathered with sweet BBQ sauce and it cooked with a crisp. 3 skewers and a cup of rice for $7.99.  The lechon is different from what you're use to compared to all other Filipino joints. This ones better and you'll just have to trust me on that. Haha. 1/2 pound is $8.00.  Aileen was nothing but helpful. Wonderful customer service and you can tell she was way excited about the grand opening. She told me a lot on Cafe De Cebu's plans and I'm way excited!   They will be open for lunch tomorrow for the grand opening then at 8pm there will be live entertainment.  What I love about this new spot is that you now have space for multiple families when eating here. You know Filipino's and their outings! Also, they do have Red Horse beers and San Miguel light. So you know y'all can drink! Haha.    Try it out and I promise you won't be disappointed!   PS. THEY STILL HAVE UBE CHEESECAKE!!"}
{"text":"Check out their lunch specials... My favorite place to eat for lunch and always hit the spot! The customer service is great and the new place is cozy and nice."}
{"text":"When I was out in Vegas my friend wanted to go have some authentic Filipino food! Our co worker suggested to go to this place since it just opened!  From the moment we walked in I loved what I saw. It looked like their furniture was hand crafted by a really good designer. They had a lounge area made of pallet wood and their lighting was made of mason jars. So very original and tasteful.   Our party had five adults and 3 kids in our party. The hosts was very accommodating to the kids. Which was nice.   Now on to the food! I am very picky when it comes to Filipino food because my family cooks really good, and I was craving some really good authentic Filipino food. We probably ordered everything on their menu! They had alot of really good choices! They even had pork intestines, talk about authentic, lol I didn't try the pork intestines but my friends who did said it was a bit crunchy and hard. But they still enjoyed it.  The kare kare was a bit on the sweet side for my taste, still good, just too sweet, I wanted to taste more peanut butter.   My favorite thing would probably be the sisig, singing and bagooang fried rice! Both were amazing!!!!   The food portions were a really good size for the price as well!  They had great Filipino background music playing and also offered kareoke. They also have a live band playing almost every night, which I thought was awesome!   I would've given them 5 stars but the service was a bit slow. Don't get me wrong they were super duper nice!!! I just think they need more help. It was one girl taking care of the whole restaurant. Other than that I love this place and will definitely go back when I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing. The food tastes just like my aunt makes it which is super authentic. I loved everything and the atmosphere. It was super clean. Our waitress was very attentive. I will definitely be coming back!!"}
{"text":"DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE--it's awful!!! The food is not good and expensive. We ordered 6 dishes, 4 water and 2 soda and paid $170. We were so shocked with the amount of food serve-/so small and cold when served after waiting for 1 hr to be served. It wasn't even that much people in the restaurant except for one big group. The pinacbet was served in a small bowl about a cup size looks like leftover and we were charged almost $12; no lechon naubusan daw, BBQ was cold after waiting 1 hr., pancit no meat and veggies, calamari was 6 pcs and hard. The music and the band was so loud that you couldn't stand to be inside---this place is a joke."}
{"text":"Vey bad.. came here with my friend. .very disappointed. Waited almost an hour for lechon and it came out cold and nasty. Halo halo was tasteless if it wasn't for the ice cream it would taste like water. Even the lumpia took almost an hour.atleast now we know where not to go. We came all the way from nlv because when I check the reviews it was all good but all lies. What a waste of time and gas. This doesn't even deserve 1 star."}
{"text":"Lechon!  OK, that's all I know.  I've half jokingly asked a very good friend to be my guide in the Philippines only to be told, \"enjoy yourself.  It's hot.  There's no air conditioning.  They don't have electricity all day\".  That said, I blame him for my lack of knowledge on Filipino cuisine.  JK.  Though, ever been to a restaurant and had no idea what anything is?  With zero street cred other than watching Anthony Bourdain's single No Reservations Philippines episode, here goes.  Cool dining space.  The lounge is actually made from recycled shipping palates.    The lechon, boneless pork belly rolled and roasted (not deep fried).  Golden skin, uber crispy with juicy, fatty sweet pork inside.  Good eats for sure.  Digging in with your fingers makes it taste that much better.   Minor observation, shouldn't this have been roasted over an open fire to maintain authenticity and add the smoky bitterness?  Kare-Kare was intriguing.  A stick to the ribs stew.  Well braised oxtail, its melting cartilage creating a gelatin packed broth, with peanut butter.  Savory, rich, and earthy and good eats.  Grilled boneless Bangus (milkfish) is definitely a fish lovers fish.  The fish has flavor.  There is a fatty richness around the belly and a \"fishy\" flavor throughout that is enhanced by grilling.   Ginataang Kuhol (freshwater river snails cooked in coconut milk) is interesting.  Obviously from frozen, the snails are slightly tough.  Unlike saltwater shells, these have a slight muddy, bitter vegetal finish that is toned down by the garlic, onions and coconut milk.  And then, Isaw BBQ.  It looks great.  Beautiful caramelized BBQ sauce on pork INTESTINES.  No, no, 1000x no.  Fatty, chewy, like well cooked tripe BUT the taste.  Barnyardy?  Screw that.  It taste literally like what comes out of the backside of an animal.  Follow up the Isaw with Chicharon Bulalak.  This isn't deep fried pork skin, rather deep fried intestines.  Unpalatable due to the overwhelming smell.  Service is very friendly and welcoming.   A meal that is a journey to a foreign land.  Highs far outweigh the lows and the unusual is just part of the experience.  Truly one that beckons you to return."}
{"text":"The Best Filipino Food in town!!! This place is also very chic. The interior is a mix of contemporary and urban vibe. There is a live band at night that plays great music. My family definitely enjoyed the amazing food and excellent service tonight."}
{"text":"Bad customer service, and a shady restaurant! This place sucks! Never coming back here again. They won't accept my Restaurant.com via my phone. They require it printed. Who does that nowadays? I've been using restaurant.com, and that's the first time I've heard of it. Also, they automatically charged me 18% gratuity for 2 people (supposed to be only parties 5 or more) - really shady."}
{"text":"Second time coming here the food was pretty good the first time and it justified the wait time this time around though we waited over an hour for our food thought it was ridiculous specially when it wasn't even hot"}
{"text":"The waitress was so kind and informing! We went there only for the ube cheesecakes. They are probably the BEST cheesecakes I've ever had."}
{"text":"I would recommend this place. The vibe is pretty lit if you bring some crazy friends with you. They have a friendly workers and fast service unlike rendevouz restaurant... Try pork sisig!!!"}
{"text":"Sarap talaga. As I have said earlier can't leave Vegas without coming by. Since you're close yesterday, I have to stay another day and guess what I was the first in the restaurant today.  satisfied. continue improving and keep your workers that are very nice."}
{"text":"First time coming here and it was to attend a birthday party. Nice place to karaoke or ballroom dance. Place was well kept and very clean. Staff was very nice and accommodating. Food ok the other hand was nothing that blew my mind. Out of everything they had, their sisig bangus was the only thing I liked. Other items were blah. No taste. They had pork belly which was not the best for sure. The skin tasted burnt and it was not crispy. The mean seasoning was not enough. Would I be back? Not sure but I definitely expected more from this place."}
{"text":"Do not order anything online they might never see your order and you'll have to wait so long coz they didn't prepare it yet. Leche flan probably on the menu but they don't have it at all. It could have been better if they just turn off their account here and never say they take pick up orders.  wasted my time!"}
{"text":"The best steamed rice toppings and ngohiong same as cebu. And best server just find Aileen!"}
{"text":"We appreciate the efforts of the owner to make up for what happened yesterday. He personally came to our office and brought us lunch today. He said that he was truly sorry for what had happened yesterday as he was out and wasnt able to supervise his staff yesterday. Here is what our lunch looks like today care of cafe de cebu. Thank you and plus 2 stars for the effort you have shown. It shows you care for your customers and will try to make things right."}
{"text":"Best Filipino food in Vegas! Not only is the food great (we ordered lechon, humba, lumpia and chicken BBQ); the service is even better. Aileen is awesome and makes the best halo halo. My second trip here and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"It was the first time my family and I tried this Filipino restaurant. We were craving for some lechon and so have decided to try it. First off, this place is not suitable for a nice family meal time because it was too loud in there due to their karaoke feature. You cannot have any decent conversation in there. Next is the food. We ordered the lechon belly and it's really disappointing because there's only 3 small pieces of the pork skin, which were not crispy at all and a lot of fats...I would say that sure porkbelly has naturally a lot of fats in it, but the part that was given to us was the one with thickest fat with only a thin layer of edible meat. Then came the bulalo, which was the worst one I've ever had. FYI, bulalo is suppose to be beef shanks and not oxtail. The bulalo came with two sad pieces of oxtail, along with two sadder pieces of baby bokchoy and plenty of soup with most likely powdered seasonings, just like the ones you put in instant noodles. I think it's overpriced, amounting to like $6 per piece of oxtail. The lumpiang shanghai was good enough, but who could mess that up? The greenbeans is fine too, which I think is the best one among our ordered food. We also ordered the halohalo, which was good. We were was also very disappointed by their burnt turon, which was quite bitter to the taste, with the banana inside still a little raw. The waitress that we had also doesn't know that much about the food they're serving. She served us the bulalo and didn't give us rice with it, not until I asked for one. The food here is overpriced, for the quality that we had. We ended up paying $70 for these subpar meal. We surely regret coming here. Anyway, will never be back here again."}
{"text":"If you want to host a party and have your guests go home hungry, you've found the right place! I watched in dismay as my brother hosted a private party here. For a 4 hour party, the food lasted for only 1 hour. It was agreed that there would be enough food for 90, yet the head count did not even reach that. After the 1st hour l, all I saw was empty food containers. I found out that some of the realtives of the host did not eat just so that others could. Really? Is that how you satisfy your customers? You should be ashamed if yourself for thinking that you did a great job. I only wish that Yelp had an option for 0 stars, because 1 star is too high for the service we received."}
