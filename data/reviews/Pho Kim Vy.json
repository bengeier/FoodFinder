{"text":"Have gone to this restaurant 3x and unfortunately the food quaility is getting worse every time. The last trip I ordered pho, broth was flavorless, amount of noodles were skimpy. The worst part was the bean sprouts that were brought to the table seemed limp and looked like they were cooked, but they were NOT! Not planning on ever going back."}
{"text":"The servers are always nice and friendly. The place is always clean. The pho is delicious and when they call something spicy, they mean it! It isn't anything fancy or special, but they make the food that they make well."}
{"text":"11 bucks for a giant bowl of mostly flavorless broth 5 skimpy prices of beef and a giant wad of noodles . Think I'm going to just stick with making pho at home  the flavor is much more intense. Starting  to think restaurants should start listing how many oz of meat they add to the soup."}
{"text":"I'm sorry. I have to update my review and lower my rating. I hate to do it, because the owners seem so friendly and kind. This time around, I ordered the curry vegetable dish with rice and it was super blah. I order this dish often from Saigon Y2K, which to me is standard basic satisfying Vietnamese. It was not delicious at all at Pho Kim Vy unfortunately. They do fine with spring rolls and noodle dishes, but it's not exciting and something I look forward to. I want to give them another chance because they're my local Vietnamese restaurant and I want so badly for them to succeed, but I don't know if I can do it."}
{"text":"Deciding to grab lunch to kill some time before a nail appointment, we decided to go to Pho Kim.  Our server was super friendly and eagerly seated us as soon as we walked in.  Although I was set on getting pho sate, I got swayed by the Bun Bo Hue and my sister got the vermicelli bowl.  My soup was alright, the broth was lacking some flavor but the noodles and variety of meat (meat balls, brisket and beefsteak) were abundant. I had a couple of bites from the vermicelli bowl - spring rolls were crisp and meaty and the fish sauce was well balanced.  Would this be my first choice place? Probably not. But the food and pricing are pretty decent."}
{"text":"Pretty average pho place. There is nothing that stands out about this place but it's. Or terrible either. Portions and meat to noodle ratio are average and the flavours are 'ok' but really nothing special. Service was quick but not overly friendly."}
{"text":"Delicious food, good location, great prices. It has a chill atmosphere with a variety of clientele!"}
{"text":"It's unbelievably horrible. It didn't help that we ordered food from this place to celebrate our daughter's recovery at the Alberta Children's Hospital.   The rice in my meal was literally at the cusp of being rotten. The kind of rice that's not technically spoiled yet but a few more hours and it would be. I don't want to use the culture card, but I'm Asian and know what I'm talking about. Usually Vietnamese restaurants have a pretty high turn over that you should not need to ever serve old rice. But this one did.  My husband repeated our orders three times to the server and they got it wrong anyway. The rest of our take out caused massive diarrhea. Don't waste your money here there are so many better Vietnamese places in the city."}
{"text":"My first visit here for a sub and salad rolls. Friendly staff and clean environment. My food was served quickly but was bland tasting. Cheap food perhaps catering to the local university crowd. Please improve the food."}
{"text":"The restaurant is located in a new condo building so it is very clean and modern. The food however was disappointing. The salad wraps were tiny, the length of two shrimps, and they had chopped cucumber and romaine salad which is incorrect as they should have pork, 4 shrimp lengths and garlic chives. The Pho was very skimpy on meat. I would have to say you get , less than 50% of the meat portions that you would normally get at an average pho restaurant. My bowl was the \"house special\" but the portions of meat were very light, I got 1/4 of a meatball and 4 slices of beef tendon, it was noticeable enough for me to feel ripped off and a little angry at how little meat my bowl had. They also only have \"L\" and \"XL\" sizes which is really a \"S\" and \"L\" in other places. I would not go here again. Very disappointed.   Food: 2.5/5 Cleanliness: 5/5  Service: 5/5 Parking:2/5 very difficult to find parking. You will have to park near Jameson's as there are only 4 spots at the front door and it is quite the walk."}
{"text":"Let's be honest. The name is awesome and is what brought me in. No real complaints, yet, when I think of vietnamese, I still think of Saigon Y2K. I'll give this place another go soon though and don't want to hold anyone back from trying it out."}
{"text":"Service was quick.  Restaurant was clean and new.  Food was ok.  I particularly liked their Sate Beef Sub - spicy and has a bite!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this place more stars as it is close to home.  However, after giving it a second chance since its grand opening things have unfortunately gone downhill  1. The vegetables in the egg noodle stir fry are overdone (I could live with this) 2. Vegetables in the egg noodle stir fry are OLD (they tasted slimy and the broccoli was discoloured ... yellowed from being too old) 3.  Out of the 4 tiny slivers of beef included in the beef stir fry 2 were Un-chewable. 4. The sate is not home made / tastes awful!!!  5. We were 4 ppl (2 adults and 2 toddlers). We got 2 napkins.  I asked for more noting we have small kids.  We were given 2 more napkins,  I asked for more again and got 2 more ... at this point I gave up. 6. The pho broth wasn't bad, I'd give it a 3.5 stars.  I've just had better 7. The sprouts that come with the soup were also yellowed and stale.   Overall disappointed :("}
{"text":"The food was basic and lacking in actual meat that was the center of the dishes.  Shrimp rolls were superb yet again, warm instead of cold.  Missing the mark on these main dishes plus the lack of lime, cilantro and mint were a disappointment.  Nice, little cozy place for intimate conversation regardless of the 3 big screen tv's (excessive for such a tiny place).  I expected much more and the server was not familiar with the menu.  Staff looked haggard and exhausted with the exception of our young server.  Improve flavours, add substantial ingredients, spruce up decor and increase product knowledge to actually sell me on the special items to have me come back and I will be in the front of the line."}
