{"text":"My friend and I ordered food from here since it was available off of grub hub. It took almost an hour for delivery of a slice of pizza and some pasta, that's a no. The total came to around $12. We gave the driver a $2.00 tip which is a descent tip for $12 and we gave it to him in cash. About 15 minutes later,  we received a call from an unknown number. It was the manager of pasta and pizza villa.. No joke. He was upset and accused my friend and I of giving his driver a $1 tip. We explained we gave a $2.00 tip in cash and that was more than 15%. Also, grub hub gives you the option to leave a 10%, 15%, or 20% on your card so nothing is mandatory when you order off of grub hub to begin with. Secondly, what poor management to call a customer to begin with and also accuse them of something they did not do. After arguing, the manager apologized and said he did not want to take money out of his own drawer to tip the grub hub driver. I will never give my business to this establishment again!"}
{"text":"This place is a wreck. I ordered once before and it was great. On time and the food was great. It was a bit pricey but the food was good so I was willing to order again. I don't know if they changed management but it's terrible now. I ordered my food on a Sunday with no games or any events. They told me they were backed up and it would take an hour to get my food. I understand and I was willing to wait. It was 2 hours later and I call back. The guy I spoke to said \"mam I told you it would be a long wait we are backed up. Your food will be there soon.\" and hung up on me. I called back and was going to cancel my order and he went on and on trying to make up for it and said I was getting a discount and not to tip the driver. I don't think it was the drivers fault. It was poor management and now that driver isn't getting any tips from anyone who's food is late. And they didn't give me a discount they gave me a coupon that I'm not going to use. I'm upset because I did like this place. I probably won't order from them anymore."}
{"text":"\"Don't Waste Your Money\"--Don't let their different menu choices fool you..!!..Way over priced...They advertise \"Fresh Whole Wing\" on their menu!!  These wings were a joke..!! To charge over a $1 per wing for the smallest whole wing I ever saw!! Ordered a dessert and it was such a small portion for the cost and it was bought from a supplier!! The pieces were identical to each other and the nerve of the owner to tell me they are good & homemade!! The pizza was just like every other commercialized pizza out their..!!This place is such a rip off!! Another fly by night place that has no flavor in their food charging way too much money..Nothing in this place is homemade!! All store bought and sold at a ridiculous cost!! Sorry my words are harsh, but places like this shouldn't be in business selling lack luster food!!"}
{"text":"Ive ordered from here twice. Each time the food was not only under cooked but also very greasy and plain. f i wanted a cup of grease as a meal thats what i wouldve ordered. STAY AWAY FROM FRIES..."}
{"text":"It's so hard to find a good gluten free pizza and they make a delicious one!!"}
{"text":"Very good pizza! I do think their prices are a bit high, but I've never been disappointed. Never have I ordered delivery from them because I don't think you can ever expect fast delivery form any pizza place. So I wouldn't let that determine the quality of the service. 

The sauce is amazing and is fresh every time!"}
{"text":"Decided to try Pizza & Pasta Villa today for lunch.  Since this is a new joint, I started off small and only ordered an Italian Hoagie.  The hoagie was good and seemed to be made with quality ingredients.  The dining room was very clean and had a nice atmosphere to it.  It was empty while I was there, but they are still a new business.  I talked to the owner, and he seemed like a very nice guy.  I'm only giving 3 stars for now as I still have to try their pizza and pasta.  As for now I would recommend this place if your in the area."}
{"text":"If you eat here your an idiot.
I got a 1/2 steak hoagie with fries and it was over $16.00. When I questioned the price after I returned thinking he charged me for a whole hoagie and was told basically go away. Then I told him I'd review it here. Then he decided to close the front door and get in my face. 
 Thinking this could end up with either of us in the hospital I decided to leave. 
 I will NEVER eat here again."}
{"text":"Diner beware! Owner is extremely rude and unpleasant to talk to on the phone. First time I ordered chicken tenders and mozzarella sticks and everything was great. Second order, sticks were cold and my chicken tenders were burned on the outside but RAW on the inside! And the owner himself tried to tell me that because I used a coupon I was not entitled to a refund! I told him you can't serve pink chicken, it was actually slimy! After much arguing he agreed to a refund. NEVER AGAIN!"}
