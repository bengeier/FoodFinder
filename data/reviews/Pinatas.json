{"text":"The owners of Pinatas tried too hard to fit in their surroundings in trendy Grayhawk and focused too much on the décor. Maybe they should have tried the food first. This is bland, greasy Mexican fare that has nothing to offer as far as originality. The chips left a greasy muck on my fingers and I'm pretty sure the salsa was Pace Picante. The waiters and bartenders were so busy mingling with the beautiful people that they didn't notice how terrible the service was. And did I mention this spot is overpriced? I'll go to Taco Bell next time I want a Gordita. Skip this one -- Xtapa Joe's and Jalepeño Inferno further north are much more reliable."}
{"text":"I've really TRIED to like this place..simply for how cool it can be oh and that it's kid friendly and close to home if you've had a margarita!  For whatever reason I've tried the same menu item 2x now and just did not enjoy it at all.  Margaritas are good though!  Nice bar and patio area...I guess if you're just looking to have a drink...good little spot.  The END!"}
{"text":"Pinatas is one of the few mexican restaurants with a 'modern' design. It's very refreshing to have zero = pinatas, blankets or sombreros on display.  Pinatas has more of a clean, minimal, slightly industrial look. Pinatas menu offers slightly 'fancy mexican' entrees. Better quality items with alot less grease. My favorite dish is the spinach enchiladas! There are some awesome Happy hour specials, BUT, at the bar and on the patio beware of the blaring sun. Pinatas bar faces West. (Sunglasses Needed after 3pm). FYI- possible melting and blindness may occur while chugging yummy margaritas.   Fry's Shopping Center at  Hayden/ Thompson Peak -just north of 101"}
{"text":"Okay, two things to start off.   1) yes, Pinatas is a terribly cheesy name for a restaurant this cool. 2) wow the bartender will blow your mind.   To be fair, I haven't tried any of the food at Pinatas, but the drinks and the staff are great, which is enough to bring me back anytime.   The bartender is professionally trained, and has a repertoire of tricks that will stun and entertain. The place is neat, clean, fashionable - totally one of a kind.   I'm going back. Hope to see you there."}
{"text":"Not your typical Mexian restaurant, its Mexican food with a twist and is very good.  My partner and I wanted a place we could sit outside and enjoy the 80 degree AZ weather. It was a mid-afternoon on Sunday and Pinatas was quite empty. We hoped this wasn't a bad sign and were pleasantly surprised when the food came. I had a Quesadilla and he had a Burrito, both were very tasty.  The decor is funky contemporary and I like it. They were playing a wide variety of music which was pretty cool. While they were slow the server and bartender both provided excellent service."}
