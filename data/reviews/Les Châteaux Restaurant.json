{"text":"Probably won't last long. Forget about service, the place is still figuring out how to run it. Food is average and prices are high for a hk cafe. No combos are offered.  Definitely not returning"}
{"text":"Visited the restaurant today to try it out, no set lunch, no food comes with drinks except breakfast, pricey.

found a bug in my soup, told the waitress about it, and she didn't even apologize and just said \"so do you still want the soup or not?\". 

Ordered hainan chicken and black pepper beef fried noodle, after 15 minutes of waiting they told us hainan chicken won't be ready for another 20 minutes, so we cancelled it.

I would not go back again, very disappointing."}
{"text":"2.5 Star - really wanted to like this place since a close by Malaysian alternative would be awesome for me. On weekday night service was great (even got free Chinese soup), but the dish I came for char kway teow was sold out and they recommended me  the wat dan noodles instead. Not similar at all but not bad, huge portion. 

Returned on Friday night to attempt to order it again. A laksa was also ordered and that came immediately. However my dish came about 20-30 mins later after 2-3 follow up with different wait staff. The annoyance comes in from the fact that tables who got seated even after we ordered got their meals first and even after so many complaints one waitress still tried to bring my dish to another table first instead of mine (I had heard and seen them specifically tell the kitchen to make it so was quite sure it was mine and yes, after it was brought over to me).

The other thing that was not cool was how wait staff would be lazy to walk around the more main aisles between tables and try to squeeze through the little ones between the individual non booth tables. There's about maybe a foot of space so they have to go through sideways and it is not enjoyable to have to watch someone's ass brushing past your table every 5 minutes and wondering if they will knock anything on the table over 

Food overall is okay but on a very very mild spiciness side so I wouldn't say it's a good alternative for other Malaysian restaurants."}
{"text":"This place has much higher prices for their traditional style HK food. Ex, $10.5 for baked pork chop on rice. Blue Ocean in the same plaza has much better value. There's no combos so you don't get a drink or soup. 

I ordered a baked chicken with tomato sauce on rice and it came out stir fried, not baked. The chicken were in small strips, and the sauce was watery. 

Basic service here is subpar as well. My gf ordered a lemon ice tea, it came with no straws....and it took them awhile to clear the tables for the huge line of people waiting. 

Overall, avoid it if you can. The only upside here is the clean environment."}
{"text":"Came during afternoon tea and to my surprise, most items were sold out including the Turnip cake and the fried fish skin noodle (two of the most popular dishes in my opinion). The service was quick but the food lacked any flavour especially the their milk tea! I expected this restaurant to have good milk tea as they do owe a bakery in the same plaza. Given the choices of restaurants in this plaza, I would not be returning back here anytime soon."}
{"text":"Second time around review

Came at 4pm ish foe late hi tea on a Saturday.
The tea came cold.

Ordered 3 dishes: laksa, Singapore fried turnip cake and fries pork cutlet with fries.

My laksa came at 16:02 and my turnip cake came at 16:17. I already finished my laksa. Why so long . .. the restaurant isn't even busy. Pork cutlet came at 16:18.

Laksa 
They really should remove the \"authentic Malaysian\" from the menu. Last time I had the \"gwai dui\" it sucked and was not authentic so i thought I'd give them a second chance. This was also disappointing. It was nothing special. Came with chicken breast, shrimp and fries tofu.

Singapore fried turnip cake
How can you fail at this .. not only did it took long . .. it was not crispy. It was soggy and oily. Zero Singapore taste. Where's the sour melon bits? 

Fried pork cutlet with fries
Fried taste like tasteless frozen fries that were also not crispy. No presentation effort. Fried pork cutlet was also not crispy much. Wasn't good. 

Ying yang hk style milk tea coffee mix
Tasteless.

Overall, I gave them a second chance only to lose another star. Probably really won't come back."}
{"text":"A new restaurant located in Peachtree plaza serving both Asian cafe style food and Malaysian cuisine.

Food: we focused on the Malaysian menu and enjoyed the chicken roti.  The roti was freshly fried and perfectly crispy, came with 3 pieces.  Portion size for the curry was large (don't be fooled that it is labeled as an appetizer!), it was tasty but the curry over at blue ocean cafe is still my favourite.  I would still order this again though, it was tasty and pairs well with the roti.  The belachan fried rice was also big and tasty, a lot of people ordered the Malaysian rice noodle dish which I would like to try next time.  Tiramisu cake was fresh and yummy. 

Service: great service, friendly staff. 

Interior: newly renovated and clean."}
{"text":"Food is slow, service is slow, EVERYTHING is slow.

I went to the restaurant at 8:30pm and left at 10pm, we waited 20 minutes to be seated which was considerable for a Friday night. Something felt strange while I was waiting as I saw a table that got their bill already but didn't leave for a long time, then later I found out that it was because the server didn't give them change yet ! That already tells you something about their service.

I ordered as soon as I was seated and the food took more than 50 minutes to come, FIFTY. And no they did not miss my order because EVERY SINGLE TABLE IS THE SAME. I'm not even exaggerating I observed every table cos I had 50 minutes to spare. The reason one server gave was because the chef don't cook the food in order they just pick a RANDOM order to make, whether this is true or not it's just as bad cos its either they have a horrible kitchen management or that the servers just too dumb to think of any better excuses.

For the food, I ordered their signature Char Kwei Teow and their baked pork chop spaghetti in tomato sauce. Super average, it tasted like any stir fried noodles you can find in any Chinese restaurant. The spaghetti was better in my opinion but nothing too special it tasted the same as the ones you get from hai tang cafe. I was starving when the food came and I still think it was only ok this tells you how average the food is. 

As I left I saw that the table that got seated before me had their stir fried vegetable dish delivered to them like seriously I can make that in 5 minutes and they took one hour to do so. 
Whatever cooking show they were showing there I watched 3 episodes of it so at least my kitchen skills were enhanced.

TL;DR  food tastes the same as any Chinese cafe you can find in Markham . If you're not down to spend at lease over an hour in this restaurant then AVOID AT ALL COST."}
{"text":"Nothing special here. The menu is small and pretty bland. The food was average and depending on what you order, portions could be small or large. Their tea time special was basically non- existent and lacking variety. 

With so many other places to eat inside and around the plaza, I would not recommend this one. The take out places have far better food and with Keung's Restaurant and New City Restaurant within close vicinity, you'd be wasting your time with this place. Trust me, you're not missing out. 

The HK style milk tea was very chalky and didn't taste natural at all. We left with our cups still full. I wish I could say service was the silver lining but, alas, it is mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Access
This is near the south side of the plaza. In other words, park near Ajisen Ramen. Parking here is a bit bad on weekends, so come on weekdays. Since this restaurant is still relatively new, you will get 15% discount Monday through Thursdays. If this offer expires, don't blame me!

Bad Reviews
Yelp gave this baby a horrible impression. 2.5 stars...no. I'm not saying it's a 4 star restaurant, but at least 3 stars. What I realized is that most of the reviews came earlier, so when they first opened. I don't think people were complaining about the food, it was mainly about the service. Let me assure you, their service has greatly improved. We went in with a coupon, and got a fried rice for free! Can't beat that I tell you.

Food
The portions are big. The service was good, they kept refilling our water - that's a big plus for me. They will give you soup if you order the 3 combo meals, this is pretty common for restaurants, less so for HK cafes. So if you do order several dishes, be sure to clarify if you qualify for free bowls of soup. I honestly think all the dishes tasted pretty good for an HK cafe. The beef was very tender and yummy. Veggies were okay. The fish dish was surprisingly good, I ate all the mushrooms - not too salty. The fried rice was average, probably could be more flavourful but that's okay. Overall, a pretty decent HK cafe for dinner options, I'd come back. I think for me, what I didn't like was the restaurant temperature. Sometimes it hovered around boiling hot and then other times, I had to keep my jacket on. I feel this is partly due to their double door layout - exit points within the mall and out into the streets. Too much cold air coming in, it's frigg'n -20 outside..."}
{"text":"One of the worst experience I've had in a while. This review will be uber short because I came under the impression it'll be a fast eat bc it's essentially an HK cafe type restaurant. We went in, seated quickly and she gave us the menu and said to give her a minute while she takes the order for other tables. We figure out what to eat and waited for her to come by, but she never showed up (in kitchen?). So I flagged another lady down to take our order and she said give her a minute. I was thinking, \"calm down.. It's only been 10 minutes since we were seated.. 10 minutes? Wtf?
We waited for another few minutes and still no one came to take our order.. I was clearly getting vexed at this point, at which a customer beside me said\" just leave. We asked for our coffee 40 minutes ago and still nothing..\" so my wife and I picked up our stuff and left.

If I could, I'd give this place 0. Sure the place was full and busy.. So HIRE more people! There were two on the floor to take the entire restaurant and one sitting behind the cash to take payment.. Wtf?"}
{"text":"My parents brought me here on a Friday afternoon. To my surprise, this place was packed. Sitting area is very tight. Chairs are back to back. They have a pretty decent menu,  however most of the items are over priced as no drinks are included. Also, they are understaffed. It took 15 mins for them to get us the bill. The overall service gave me a feeling that they are trying to figure out how to run this restaurant. Food was good but nothing really stands out."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night with my parents because my mom wanted to check it out. It's owned by the same owners who own the bakery in the plaza hence the name. It's basically a HK style cafe with a Malaysian menu. The restaurant is a decent size and it was clean. 

First off the food was tasty and good portion size. But the down side of it is that the service was extremely slow. The waitresses were nice and attentive but the food took way too long to arrive after ordering. We ordered 3 dishes which came with soup but not rice. Usually, rice and soup comes with these dishes. So rice is extra but not soup. After ordering we got our soup within minutes. But we had to wait about 20-30 minutes after the soup to receive our first dish. The dishes didn't even come all together. The second one came about 5 minutes after we had to continue waiting for the third dish. The third dish took the longest we were about half way through the other two dishes before the third one arrived. 

The prices were a bit more expensive than other HK cafes. For 3 dishes and 2 bowls of rice it came to about $40. There are better and faster HK cafes out there for sure. I'm sure there is potential for this place but I think they should either start off with a smaller menu and work on speed."}
{"text":"So you know the bakery inside the main entrance of New Kennedy Square? They just opened a new associated restaurant! Carrying the same name, \"Les Chateaux\", this premature HK-style restaurant is stocked full of new furniture, squeaky clean windows, new paint, and an army of staff. Even though they've been opened for a 1-2 weeks now, they sure are lacking a few things such as interior/exterior decorations to grab a Yelper's attention lol. That, and a solid menu. They've got paper posters all around the plaza advertising this place, offering 10% off opening week. But still, they are as plain as can be.

Unfortunately, I had a subpar first experience. Their menu was disappointing. Being a HK-style restaurant, one of the things I look for is a drink to combo my meal - no such existence here. No lunch meals, no afternoon tea sets. Nothing on the menu comes with a drink except for the All-Day Breakfast which consists of 2 choices that aren't all too popular. Although available, they do not even have a drinks menu displayed. Next, I proceeded to order a Baked Pork Chop Rice (pretty standard), but they informed me they don't have baked dishes at this time (what? I'm scared to ask.. do you have an oven back there yet?). While their menu is quite extensive with Chinese dishes, they don't have the combos that I like to go for at an HK cafe; could use some enhancements there. Not to mention the amusing spelling errors... So finally, my family settled for a few Chinese dishes & rice for dinner at 6pm. 

Service was impressively quick though. We received our orders in under 10 minutes. The moment of truth...*drum roll*... & the FOOD is a WIN! The kitchen can cook! \(^^)/ We ordered an Eggplant Pot and Pork Neck w/ Vegetables, cooked and seasoned well (a bit on the salty side), overall I am satisfied with the food. The white rice that came with it though... so dry. It was probably the rice meant for cooking fried rice; the kind that is intended to be mixed with sauces among other things. Had to force it down. Not very forgivable.

Originally I would've given 2-stars, bump up 1 star for the impressive kitchen performance. I don't write 3-star reviews, however, I will return in a few week's time to give (or take away) the star they deserve in order to move out of this grey area. When we visited, the tables were full, so, they are gaining local attention in addition to their bakery regulars. The kitchen can deliver; if only they can solidify their menu to cater to the more frugal crowd, then they'll be winners in my books!"}
{"text":"Decor looks modern and clean but not too many choices in terms of dishes as all they serve is Malaysian food. I've asked for black pepper sauce steak over rice but they said they ran out of the sauce so that dish was not available to be made. So I've opted for the Malaysian laksa soup noodle only to find it kind of bland. I find the laksa noodle soup tastes better at Deer Garden which is more rich in flavouring. I don't find this place too appealing and being a new resto, no Wow factor to it.
I won't be returning."}
{"text":"This restaurant is operated by Les Châteaux bakeries, which is at the other entrance of Peachtree. I went when it was still in the soft opening but wow, was it packed! Probably because it has 20% discount. 

They have lots of choices, run and displayed very similarly to Phoenix on Raymerville. Prices are about the same too. Only some of their menus have English. 

I ordered ???? (hometown style fried vermicelli) and ?????? (dry fried chicken in spaghetti). The soups came first (chicken feet and some type of beans) and it tasted just like mama makes it. 

The vermicelli was great! Sufficient toppings, taste was there, and not oily at all. We finished this asap. 

But the spaghetti. It's supposed to be dry fried, meaning I should not see it coated in oil. In the end, we didn't even touch this because it was so poorly cooked. 

So why 4*?

When we got the bill, the waitress offered us a box for takeaway but we said we don't want one because of the spaghetti. We didn't complain... We weren't even going to talk about it. But we said that the name is DRY fried and this was super oily, so it's a no. 

She said we're right, so she's going to take it off our bill. 

Have you ever heard of Chinese diners doing that before?! 

Also, the AC was sufficient most of the time. They have a TV on which they broadcast Chinese singers' past concerts... With lyrics. They have two entrances so that definitely increases the traffic. 

I would come here again if they have such great service. But I don't think I would order any dishes from the dry fried section for a long while. They're still in their soft opening / probation, so they're probably feeling out which dishes work and figuring out good recipes."}
{"text":"Knowing this place was getting 2.5 I still gave it a try.  Yes it's pricey and doesn't come with a drink but was there for lunch and it came with a soup. I had to try the qwie diew flat rice noodle large portion taste good   Hunan chicken rice was good the place has two menus a cha Cheng teng items menu and a Malaysian dishes menu.  The baked pork chop rice was not up to par overall portions are bigger than normal in my opinion.  Service was good lady kept topping up or tea 3 to 4 times unusual for cha Cheng teng."}
{"text":"Been here twice already ! My parents really like this place as well, and they're super picky when it comes to things like Malaysian food - and they thinks it's authentic! Also, food was pretty. 

We got the Char Kwei Tweo (might've spelt it wrong), Laska (noodles in soup), and Seafood Curry. 

The Char Kwei Tweo was super tasty, flavourful, and authentic to malaysian flavours. Their noodles aren't regular long noodles, but like thick, slices (almost like a square shaped noodle) which we thought was super interesting and added to the dish. It was also easy to eat and not at all messy (as it can be with eating noodle dishes). 10/10 recommend. Only thing is that there was only shrimp in the noodles, so it might get boring after a while. 

The laska was really good too, a right bit of spicy. Dad really liked it. 

And the curry was probably the least flavourful, a little too watery i think? But it was super pretty. it was a great pairing with this puffy bread thing. I think it was deep fried, and came out looking like a ball. It was like a really light naan?"}
{"text":"Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. If it was not because of a recommendation, I wouldn't give this place a second try after the first time. 

The first time, food was terrible and service was non existent. 

The second time, I tried their Malaysian menu, including their \"famous\" pork rib soup. However, it took me 10 mins to find someone to take my order. Under staff was not an issue, there was about 4 people working. I just want to put in an order!! I ended up having to walk up to the counter myself just for the staff to punch my order into the computer.

About the food- The Hk style baked rice dish took 45 mins and only came when I asked for the bill, I asked to cancel the dish, they refuse, and then made it out in 3 mins. The \"famous\" pork rib soup is not bad, but a bit expensive. However it was really slow. Good thing we were not in a mad rush but what a waste of a weekend. Funny thing was, the table beside us complained about the food being slow as well.

Service- 0/5.
Food- 3/5 for the pork rib soup.
Average- 1.5/5.

This place does not deserve a spot in the mall and they should stick to their bakery business."}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday for lunch on an empty stomach so anything might've tasted amazing to me. At that moment though, their food was outstanding!

Most people tend to order their HK style food which is usually a safer and cheaper choice but we came for and ordered from their Malaysian menu: char kwei tew, chicken curry rice and #5 which was a ho fun type dish. 

Their curry was very tasty, not spicy at all and very comforting. There weren't any under cooked onions that turns me off from curry usually. 

Their noodles from both noodle dishes were PERFECT. Beautifully chewy and just the right thickness. The flavours for all dishes were pungent but not too salty.

Also all their dishes were quite large. We ordered 3 dishes for 6 people at $8 pp! 

I'd come back here for their #5 for sure, it was my favourite.

Try their Malaysian!"}
{"text":"Newly opened. We came with party of 4, they don't have enough chairs and no spare chair.  Also, no highchair so family unfriendly.

No combo meal with drinks which is pretty standard for HK style restaurants especially in this highly competitive Chinese plaza. Price is on the high end for regular HK style restaurant.

We want to order baked pork chop rice, they said the oven is not ready. And will charge same price for just pork chop with rice.

Cutlery are not clean.

Service is subpar, need more training. I saw they took away a customer eye glasses until the customer found out and pick it up from the food cart.

Food quality is ok and portion reasonable."}
{"text":"I feel like some people are being particularly tough on this place. After trying it - I don't understand why. Spot on service. Great food and the bill arrived when I asked for it. 

Man up, own that shit and be a man. Simple as that."}
{"text":"Under the roof of this mall houses both the bakery and the restaurant of Les Chateaux.  Les Chateaux Restaurant is a Hong Kong style Cafe. It has a concise menu that offers the typical and most popular Cafe items such as HK style breakfast, noodles and rices, HK style Western baked entrees, and simple dinner entrees.  Per menu, it aims to be a neighborhood food diner.  

Upon entry, the first thing that I noticed was the nice decor.  The second thing that I noticed was the mall side entrance opened right to the back of a table, with 2 people dining there.  The set up was a bit awkward.  Services were effective and polite.  We were promptly seated at a corner.  

We ordered a Eggplant with Fish Sauce and a Satay Beef with Flat Rice Noodle Stir Fry.  Both tasted delicious.  I particularly enjoyed the Eggplant dish, as the chef added some diced pickled vegetable to make the flavors more intense.  If you are conscious of your sodium intake, however, you might want to eat this sparely.  The flat rice noodle looked colourful and pretty.  The beef tasted tender.  The portion was average for both entrees.

Les Chateaux also offers a few South East Asian stir fry, noodle and rices.  On day I visited, all except Hainanese Chicken rice were not available for ordering.

Minor room for Improvement.  I didn't know if it was due to the air circulation issue or just the interior temperature setting, by the end of the meal I was sweating."}
{"text":"The dishes were bland.  Singapore turnip was not even close to the real one.  Yong chow fried rice was quite tasteless.  Beef fried rice noodle was a little better than the other two dishes.  The value was fair.  Even though the price was good, it's not worthwhile going back because of price.  The dishes at the nearby food court are much better."}
{"text":"Specializing in Malaysian cuisine. Small and cozy with a good amount of seating. Don't know why they named this place Les Chateaux. Doesn't sound Malaysian at all. Tried many dishes here as I have been here a few times already. The service could be better. Portions are very large. Quality very nice. For example the shrimps in my fried rice were large and had at least seven large shrimps. Price is very competative. Will be back again."}
{"text":"I don't particularly agree with most of the reviews about this place and how this place is getting below 3 stars. Perhaps those other yelpers just went on an off day but I've gone twice so far and had no issues. 

Both times came for lunch around 2-3 right before their afternoon tea which begins at 3 (which I find is quite late than most other places)  Maybe that's the time other's should try  coming, between 2-3. I found everything i ordered was cooked well and flavorful 

Both visits ordered the Singapore laksa. Very delicious, good soup base with lots of flavor. With the soup you can definitely taste the coconut and they don't cheap out on the ingredients either. Large pieces of chicken, and shirp (that's not cheap). I didn't find myself being thirsty either after and I drank quite a bit of the soup so that is pretty good sign that their soup isn't loaded with MSG. 

Also ordered the indo fried rice which was quite tasty as well. Large fried egg and shrimp chips on the side. The rice and all ingredients were made quite well all together. Good portion size too. Can definitely be split between 2-3 people. Best combo are: Singapore laksa & Indo fried rice. Can be split with 4 people imo. 

Really not a bad place for Malaysian/Singaporian food. I feel the reviews on here turn people away in not trying this place out because of the low star rating, but their food and service isn't bad at all. Food tastes good, service is pretty quick as well. Experience is what matters, not what others say."}
{"text":"Food: afternoon tea: portion is small but it is pretty expensive considering the price and quality.

Price: $1.50 for an iced drink is excessive. $1.50 for a Horlick hot drink is off the roof. I have been to quite a few HK cafe around the area and they usually charge $0.50 extra for Horlick or Ovaltine and $1 for iced drinks.  I didn't know that ice will cause so much in Canada...

Service: Every time I come, the order came in wrong. The worst is that the server asked me whether I stated my specific request - like no sugar in my lemon tea and the drink came in with sugar.  Then I asked the server and she said whether I mentioned that when I ordered, LOL...

Last comment - the servers are professionally trained to ask for more gratuity. 

Honestly, some of their food are pretty good but for myself, I would spend the money with better service."}
{"text":"Terrible experience here. Came around 12:30pm on a Saturday. Ordered 2 items on the menu. After waiting for 30 minutes they told my table there was no more of what we ordered. How ridiculous is it that it takes 30 minutes to tell a customer a dish isn't available. The waiters are disrespectful and rude as well. The one dish finally showed up after 45 minutes. The food here is subpar and limited. If you are looking for Chinese food don't waste your time here there's plenty of better alternatives in this plaza."}
{"text":"Good and quick service. We usually don't have much expectation for service at quick serve Hong Kong restaurants, but our waitress was very friendly. Quantity is large for the price. Its a much better deal than going for dim sum. Ordered the all day breakfast combo that costs 6.99, includes two pieces of toast, Hong Kong style milk tea, satay beef vermicelli. Theres no better deal than this around the area! 

We came on a Sunday afternoon around 3pm. The place is packed just enough so we got a seat without having to line up. I'm guessing there would be a line if you come at weekend lunch or dinner time."}
{"text":"I came here around 4pm for their afternoon tea, and this place was soooo empty. That already says something when a hk style cafe is empty during tea time. Which brings me to my next point... The service here is extremely slow. There were only 2 tables seated and the service is still slow. There were waitresses on the floor but they're just on their phone or talking to each other. When you try to get their attention to place an order or whatever, they will avoid your eye contact because they don't want to serve you. Never understood why people are like if they choose to work in the customer service industry lol. 

The food here is not that great either. I ordered deep fried chicken wings with fries, and the batter was just off. My friend ordered soup noodle and it was nothing special. The food here is bland and the menu isn't that great. Peachtree has so many better hk style cafes so don't bother coming here!!!"}
{"text":"This place is small but with nice décor, food was good, shrimp noodles soup was tasty, lots of different spicy for the soup, Malaysian fried hofun was good too, lots of shrimp and they were huge and crispy. Good Malaysian food, will be back for sure."}
{"text":"[LOCATION] - 4/5
Initially, my friends and I wanted to eat dinner at Restoran Malaysia until their hostess informed us there was a 45-minute wait for a table of four. We settled for Les Châteaux, and immediately got a table upon arrival (a clear indicator that shows the relative status of this restaurant). 

[FOOD QUALITY] - 2/5
I gave this place the benefit of the doubt and tried dishes from their \"Authentic Malaysian Menu,\" but flavours were not authentic.

[ORDER]
- Penang Char Kwei Teow (Fried Hor Fun with Mixed Seafood) - $10.99: did not reminisce any Malaysian flavours as the dish just tasted like Chinese Stir Fried Beef Noodles with shrimp instead of beef. 

- Singapore Lakhsa - $10.99: broth was too watery. 

- Malay Curry Beef Flank Rice - $12.99: lacked flavour.

- Ikan Billis Crisp Prawns with Coconut Spices - $14.99: had mountain of coconut spices sprinkled on top of a few crustaceans. Flavour was okay but spices and grease made it hard to remove the exoskeletons from prawns. 

[OVERALL] - 2/5
My intention was to try dishes that bring out Malaysian strong flavours and aromas. Unfortunately, the food at Les Châteaux did not meet my expectations."}
{"text":"Not sure why there are so many bad reviews, because my visit was pretty good. This is an HK style cafe with a Singaporean/Malaysian menu, and because of the name I believe is owned by the same people that own the bakery in the same plaza. I had the Laksa and the Curry Chicken with Roti, which were both tasty. I really like the roti which was very fresh and fluffy and lightly pan fried. Service was fast and typical of an HK style cafe. The decor isn't the best and I found the space a little tight between tables, but not dealbreakers."}
{"text":"Les Chateaux Restaurant is still at it's soft opening. I don't understand why they started with such a big menu? 

We came in on a Monday at 9 pm.

At first I want to have rice noodle, they were out. Then I changed my order to Bitter Melon rice dish. Then they said the new batch of rice they just cooked was too hard and could not be served?! So no rice dish?!  Ended up ordering Home Style Vermicelli.

Food was meh. The stir fried vermicelli was just so oily and salty! Even at 20% off, I felt like this is not worth that price. I rather pay a little more and go to eat at Congee Queen or Keung's Delight.

Staff was nice and helpful but if you don't have most of the items on the menu available, customers won't be happy.

A pass for now. Hopefully they will sort things out and have some more set meals available."}
