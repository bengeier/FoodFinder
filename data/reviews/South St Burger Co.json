{"text":"This is a neat concept restaurant. A more glamorous Harvey's, you choose your basic burger and customize your toppings.  Toppings range from your basic mustard, relish and ketchup and go to the more oh la la like feta and goat cheese, avocados and portobello mushrooms.  You're looking at about $15 for your meal, including a side and a drink.  Decently priced and the burgers are pretty good."}

{"text":"Great burgers with all the toppings you could ever ask for! On top of that, you can get a New York Fries poutine on the side, what more can you ask for! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I was beyond starving when I arrived here.  From the modern and clean appearance, I figured I was in for a delicious meal.  They kept the menu pretty simple, which is nice when you're tired of making decisions and just want to eat.  Besides hamburgers, they offer grilled chicken and veggie burger.  I especially liked how they offer a small version of the bugers vs the regular version.     I went for the small cheeseburger combo ($9) that comes with a drink and fries.  After ordering, you get to decide what goes on the burger (eek...more decisions!) but I kept it simple with just lettuce, tomatoes, mayo and ketchup.  Even with this small version, I still had trouble finishing the entire meal.  Perhaps my body was already in starvation mode and had shrunk my stomach.  The burger was a bit dry and bland.  The home cut fries looked good, but the taste didn't follow suit.  Moral of the meal: All that glitters is not gold.  Parking:  The parking at the mall parking garage was packed, but we managed to find a spot."}
{"text":"I had high hopes. Someone at my office hyped this place up and I'm sucker for a good hamburger so jumped on the opportunity for a lunch time mission to the Shops at Don Mills.  Essentially the process is that you get to choose between a hamburger or chicken burger, your bun (white or whole wheat), and whether you want cheese or bacon on it. I went for the hamburger with cheese and bacon on white bun. After ordering, you slide down the row and move to the toppings, much like at a Subway sandwich restaurant.   This is where things start to get impressive. 5 or so different types of cheese, lots of veggies and tons of sauces from different types of mayo's and relishes to ketchups and even mango chutney! Honestly the customizability of toppings is the saving grace to this place. The problem lays in the meat. For the patty, we're talking generic frozen meat with limited flavour that was pretty much falling apart as I ate the burger. The bacon was 2 thin, dry, and strips (assumably cooked, reheated, then thrown on my sandwich) slapped on top of the cheese in a haphazard format.  After spending $11+ for just the burger w/ cheese and bacon and a bottle of juice, I was expected something more. I've eaten at countless gourmet burger joints around town and the only thing memorable here was the toppings which really shouldn't be the defining aspect when you have the words Burger Co in your name.  Top it off with the fact that the parking lot at this mall is always packed and requires good timing or a couple laps to find a parking spot, I'll be passing on this place moving forward and will continue my mission to find a proper hamburger in the area."}
{"text":"Nice and juicy South St. Burger! How much I love them.   I dropped by today after a co-worker who lives in the area told me about it's recent opening. I figured since I was in the area, we could stop by.  This is gourmet burger! You can choose any toppings you want. There are neat toppings and sauces like mango chutney, wasabi mayo, pepper jack cheese, blue cheese, goat cheese, guacamole. The best part is that they are not stingy with the tomato or the lettuce. They are fresh! I'm very picky about how fresh my vegetables look if I have to eat it raw.  The best part is, if you are a fan of New York Fries, you'd love this place!  I can't wait to go back! *drool*"}
