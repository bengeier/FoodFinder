{"text":"I was very delightfully surprised with the curry at this spot. I don't have a ton of faith in food court food, but the meal I had here was incredibly tasty. I ordered the curry beef tongue on rice. When I got it, I thought it was pretty small. Then I started eating it. And eating it. And though I got my way through the beef tongue, I couldn't finis the rice. Though I wanted to, the sauce was so good.

This is a fantastic, and pretty inexpensive, spot for lunch in the area."}
{"text":"Do you hear me? 
I'm talking to you 
Across the water 
Across the deep blue ocean 
Under the open sky 
Oh my, baby I'm trying 

Lucky Curry I like my new friend 
Lucky Curry to have been where I have been 
Lucky Curry to come here again 
Ohhhohhhohhhohhohhohhhohh 

Lucky Curry is supposedly a Malay fast food joint, and funny enough, I didn't order curry.  I spotted the Hoi Nam Chicken (aka Singapore Chicken Rice).  Wasn't the greatest in the world, as I have yet to find a place that does really good rice made with the chicken broth.  Instead they all just use plain rice.  Chicken was good with the ginger sauce, and for $6 beats other fast food joints.

Metro square on the other hand is a bit of a dive mall as I have no idea why anyone would come here aside from the food court and maybe the bakery.

The good news is that they've renovated the food court and is much brighter and cleaner than it used to be.  We'll see how long that takes before it reverts back to it's old self.  They even have a couple of tvs up and running for your dinning pleasure.

Anyways.. get into the grove, cause you've got the moves.. oh wait.. I'm thinking Lucky Curry Star really."}
{"text":"I found this hole in the wall by accident  but I'm glad I did!

I haven't tried all their dishes but their curry is fantastic. I usually order the curry beef with rice with a roti shell to use to dip in the curry.

The beef used is just average, not too chewy and not too tender, just medicore but their curry sauce is really rich and flavourful. Also the roti shell is so soft and crisp, it's absolutely delicious. To compare it to something, it's like eating amazing naan bread at an Indian restaurant which is quite rare these days.

Keep in mind that it's a small hole in the wall in a small food court and the prices are relatively cheap and it's a no frills place with good curry."}
{"text":"I was hoping to get Lucky this time...   
As it usually turns out, no such Luck.

No Beef. Fine. Curry Chicken please.  
Chicken stewed-beyond-recognition.
Curry Sauce below standards, eek.
Laksa, Lacks-a-lot. Identical Curry used."}
{"text":"I've been coming for over a decade now, although sporadically. I have not tried their curry or their roti since I believe they changed owners, but their roti was my favorite roti of this form. Their lamb curry was my favorite too. I would have ordered curry today, but the plan was to grab food for dinner, and I would rather not break curry and roti out at school. It's a tad...messy. That being said, I'm having the Pad Thai ($5.99). This includes soup, tea, or bottled water (Nestle). I got the water. 

While this is not authentic Pad Thai, for $5.99, I'm pleased. It's a generous portion, and it tastes like Congee Queen Pad Thai, but a tad more ketchup-y. There seems to be a decent amount of chicken in there, and perhaps shrimp as well. For $5.99, I'd say it's quite the cheap eat. 

Bonus points for nice takeout chopsticks that do not need separating, and come in a nice plastic sleeve. Oh cute. The plastic sleeve also has a toothpick in it. So chopstick plus toothpick combo. That's new."}
{"text":"The curry chicken was underwelming to say the least. Besides the watery sauce, the chicken was flavorless and resembled the pork bones used in Chinese soups. The potatoes were also stale, and the roti was rubbery & oily. I'm pretty sure they just fried up a frozen one from the mart. What a waste of $7+."}
{"text":"My parents used to love the curry from this place. They would literally buy some for takeout and we would mix in some seafood at home, and eat with rice, along with their Roti. It was that good! 

We came back again after a few months, and things have definitely changed. The taste just wasn't the same anymore. The curry was not flavourful and rich as it used to be, and it was so thin, and had a watery consistency. It used to have this coconut milk taste to it, and certainly did not anymore. We wanted to add an extra Roti to our meal and it was $3.20, a bit overpriced in my opinion, especially if you could get it for $2.70 cheaper at most Indian Takeout places. They also bumped up their prices too. This place was my favourite here at Metro Square, it's unfortunate the quality and taste has gone downhill."}
{"text":"Not sure if this is still under same operator but I see all the bad reviews and thought I'd chime in since I visited for a snack a coupe of times in 2014. I asked for  Murtabak and while I got something that looked like Murtabak the filling was really more like that of Chinese Pancake in a Roti shell.

Now I must say they did make it fresh, which is why it took a while, I could see them roll & shape the dough in the mostly open kitchen behind the counter.  I half expected to get something prefab and warmed up but that was not the case, It wasn't bad, it just wasn't Murtabak.

I don't think these are bad or incompetent people, they're just over-reaching in trying to offer the Malaysian items (and probably the Thai ones as well) with only a vague, beginner's knowledge of the spicing, ingredient ratios and prep nuances of these dishes.

I understand they're in a food court surrounded by other Chinese options and a dozen more across the parking lot so there is the temptation to differentiate themselves somehow, But it's fair to criticize them for not having the motivation to learn & improve a little over the years.  

Bottom line is only go there if you're super hungry, in a rush and the line ups are long at every other counter and don;t order anything exotic or ambitious."}
{"text":"There are a lot of options in the Metro Square food court, this being one of them, located at the furthest food court stall from the main parking lot.

This place is known for Vietnamese and Thai food, and I used to be a regular here years back, ordering their special beef rice noodle. However the quality of that went downhill in recent years so I stopped coming.

I came back here as I was in the area and couldn't think of what to have for lunch. I was looking at several options such as the Taiwanese fast food place, New Fountain, and this place. There were also two new places open, one Japanese and one Korean. Might try those next time I'm around.

I had the curry fish ball noodle. They used the Malaysian noodle you usually find in laksa. The curry soup (I mean...sauce) was decent and flavourful, however the noodle was very absorbent. I was unable to finish the meal cause the noodle absorbed so much of the soup/sauce and it became way too fatty for me. Not to mention the salt/MSG content that was in it...

If you're looking for beef noodle soup there are definitely better options in the area (such as Grotto Noodles). If you're looking for regular noodle soup there's the cafe restaurant outside. In terms of the Chinese-influenced Vietnamese/Thai/Malay stuff...meh, you get what you paid for."}
{"text":"I ordered a chicken skewers... The chicken is so raw that it can almost jump out of my plate. The lady still try to convince me that it's okay BC apparently no blood coming out from a pink chicken is OK!!!

I will come here again when I am ready to eat chicken sashimi with curry."}
{"text":"Most disappointing curry I've ever had. I got the lamb curry and asked for extra spicy but instead they gave me what seemed like water with oil and pieces of meats. The lamb was tender but when drenched in the curry sauce, just tasted like water. The rice was also cold and tasted old (it was hard). It came with 2 pieces of broccoli and bits of vegetables. Even though it was cheap ($7.50), it was most definitely not worth it. The only good thing about this place was the chrysanthemum tea, but you can get that anywhere. 

The girl at the cashier was also clipping her finger nails.... Totally unsanitary and disgusting."}
{"text":"Where to start?  Was really in the mood for some hearty pork bone soup but their neighbor was closed for the day.  The boss lady said they have good curry beef brisket so I gave in (ok. I was starving and needed some food).  The presentation was not very appetizing.   A scoop of rice with very watery and oily curry sauce with 3-4 pieces of beef (me.  Too fatty) and 2 boiled pieces of potato. .. that was whiter than an albino snowman. Which was also crunchy...
The rice had many uncooked/dry prices inside and the sauce was warm at best.  The soup du journey lacked flavor and a cup of non-vintage H2O would have been more satisfying.
One more thing, make sure they give you the correct change as they provide no receipt. Most of the customers complained they were off by a bit."}
{"text":"1.5 star

I guess I am wrong!!

The curry tastes worse than Fried Kuey Teow.

Laksa can be renamed to be Curry Chicken Vermicelli noodle. The noodle was so overcooked and mushy...

No my Yelp friend, I don't need to try your Curry Chicken. I am eating curry chicken already.

Price is good? But this is Chinese version of Malay food?

I don't think there will be a third time.. but is third time suppose to be Lucky?"}
