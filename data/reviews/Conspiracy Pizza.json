{"text":"Had steel beams and a pepperoni pizza on another second occasion. Loved the pizzas! Such fresh toppings. The only reason I don't come more regularly is the price. I consider this a special occasion pizza (or a my-husband-had-the-worst-day-ever-and-this-is-the-only-thing-that'll-cheer-him-up) pizza"}
{"text":"Great pizza! They're huge so if you order for you and a friend, you'll both have lunch for the next day also.   I've only ever had the cheese pizza and the Tour de France, both of which were excellent. The Tour de France tastes like french onion soup on a pizza! I also usually don't like pizza crust but I like theirs.   The only thing that sucks is that it's so far away and you really have to plan around it. Make sure you drive there."}
{"text":"I'm a regular at Adamson's and saw that they opened a pizza joint.  If it's as good as Adamson's, I thought, it has to be amazing.  Well, it is.  I've had the cowspiracy, the tour-de-france and the pepperoni. All of it was amazing. Huge sizes, great content.   The wait is a little bit long but that's to be expected, so call ahead.   They have a great wall of fame for art that people have done while they waited.  The combinations of flavours are excellent. Lots of choice, too.  This place is worth your while no matter what. Just go there. They have about 3-4 tables you can eat in OR take it home.  Truly a 5* pizza joint. And NOT downtown! Woo!"}
{"text":"Different taste! And became my favourite pizza place, not fancy but very good quality"}
{"text":"This pizza is OUT OF THIS WORLD! Don't be intimidated by the short window they're open, or what seemed (initially) like a complicated ordering process. It's all worth it and makes a lot of sense for this spot. I would definitely recommend calling ahead as they only make pizzas until 7:30/sell out. We called around 4:30 and ordered four pizzas...for four people. These pizzas are huge so two would have probably been plenty but it was awesome to try out four different flavours. We tasted: the pepperoni, grasses knolls, cowspiracy, and the one with egg. All phenomenal! If I lived in the area I would definitely frequent this place for quality, delicious pizzas. Great spot! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Yesss, a great local pizza place with inventive new pizzas!  Size of pizzas are huge!  Wish they deliver west of Bayview but otherwise, it is our go to pizza place!  Can't wait to try some new pizzas!"}
{"text":"Found this place on Instagram months ago while scrolling through my regular foodie posts, and realizing Adamson BBQ had a pizza joint and had to try it. The pizza is amazing and I would compare it to Maker Pizza. If I didn't live downtown I would be here more often to try their original concoctions. 5 stars for this za joint!"}
{"text":"Terrible, possibly racist service, underwhelming food. Don't believe the hype for this 'New York' style pizzeria!  The Service: Called an order in one hour in advance, showed up 15 minutes early and still: a) Was served late (7 minutes after the expected time) b) Was served five minutes AFTER someone whose name was under mine (i.e., called AFTER I did), and walked in 10 minutes AFTER I did, but was White (I'm Asian). It's pizza, it's one of the quickest cooked foods out there!!! c) When this was pointed out, was told: \"That's just the order the pizzas were put in the oven. \" NO apology for this, no apology for the lateness.   This despite having already paid (and tipped!!!) in advance (should've asked for a refund on this!!).  One would think that a restaurant would prioritize the person in the store, or at least follow the list in the order they received the calls!!!!  The Food: I get home, and the Cowspiracy and Grassy Knoll pizzas are BOTH not worth the price of $60+:  Cowspiracy ($28): a white pizza with carmelized onions, MAYBE a handful of tiny smoked brisket chunks, and a drizzle of sriracha flavoured sauce. Definitely not worth the sycophantic reviews others have made. Have you people not had REAL NYC pizza in your lives?  Grassy Knoll ($26): Advertised as a red pizza with a mushroom mix, kale, and a crema. Virtually NO mushrooms, just a bunch of kale leaves which mostly charred in the oven and tasted burned.   All in all, so disappointing since I've raved to tons of people (and written glowing online reviews) about the food and service right next door at Adamson.  Adam and Alison, if this is an extension of your BBQ place and is any indication of a trend, you have lost my support and patronage"}
{"text":"BEST PIZZA IN THE GTA  After seeing so many instagram pictures and reviews about this place, I knew i had to try it. Located in a very industrial area, Conspiracy is truly a hidden gem. As you walk in, you feel as if you're in an open concept kitchen... kinda reminds me as if I was going into a store that host cooking classes lol  they have a variety of pizza's to choose from but we wanted to go classic and ordered the pepperoni. They only sell whole pizzas and they're essentially the size of XL (one size only) The cost of the pizza was approximately 25$ but it was HUGE. The wait for the pizza from order to cook was bout 15 minutes but can get busy if there are alot of people ordering... pizza came out piping hot and filled with many MANY pepperonis!!!! The best part was that they were mini pepperonis!!! (my fav). There are about 3 or 4 long tables to sit and enjoy your pizza but most people i saw coming in was for take out or uber eats delivery.  Definitely worth a try.. crust is super crunchy and they had just the right amount of toppings! Also quite similar to NY style pizza... except now we don't have to travel to NYC for it! Cash/credit or debit is accepted.  Can't wait to return"}
{"text":"don't think we r going to eat other pizza except this one?The store is in my neighborhood, since their hours is conflict with my diet, this is the first time walk in. Fresh baked small size pizza is perfect for a couple like us, love their recipe, will try white sauce next time."}
{"text":"Unreal pizza joint. Quality pies - those who say otherwise are nitpicking. This will definitely become my go-to joint for cheesy goodness :)"}
{"text":"Pros: - amazing crust - delicious, creative pizzas/toppings - very large pizzas  Cons: - if you eat in, your clothes will smell like pizza - pricey ($25+ per pizza)  Suggestions: - improve the circulation/venting  I can't wait to order from them again!"}
{"text":"Pizza has to be one of my favourites. It is the upmost comfort food. You have a combination of melted cheese, savoury meats and veggies.   Conspiracy Pizza has been on my list (I have a very long list). Since I heard the owner is also responsible for Adamson BBQ (which was okay) I decided to give it a try. I mean it is a pretty genius idea to combine pulled pork and pizza!   I would suggest driving. It's in the middle of the Leaside Business Park (industrial area). My friends and I walked in to a big and airy industrial spot. It's the exact same as Adamson BBQ. What I loved was the cool mural on the wall.   We decided to order 4 pizzas (hey, you only live once). We got the Deluxe Pizza, Cowspiracy, Bay of Pigs, and Halifax Explosion. You can check out the pizzas here http://conspiracypizza.ca/pizzas/   I enjoyed the Cowspiracy (pickled jalape√±os, red onion, gruyere, bbq sauce, and brisket)  and the Bay of Pigs (pulled pork, red onion, dill pickles, and bbq mustard sauce). The pizza's are really good but I would say I like Maker's Pizza more or I've heard FBI pizza is also great. After two slices, I noticed that I was getting full. The pizza's have heavy toppings.   I do have a few tips.   1. Leave your jacket in the car (our jackets had a really bad bbq smell)  2. These pizza's are HUGE and each slice is huge so come hungry.  3. Get the Garlic Dipping Sauce.  4. Try a classic pizza  Keep Eating,   Angela"}
{"text":"It is worth going out of your way to get a pizza at Conspiracy. The toppings are delicious and original, the pizzas are massive, and the crust is a nice mix of slight charring but chewy and foldable. I've tried three pizzas (Bay of Pigs, The Dale, and Day of Deceit) and I can't wait to try more. Staff are super friendly and the pickup times are spot on so there is no waiting once you arrive. Just like Adamson's BBQ, Conspiracy is a tremendous addition to the Leaside, and Toronto, food scene."}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza in the city. \"Fancy\" flavours like Cowspiracy and Halifax Explosion provide a delicious twist to a familiar classic. Quality ingredients, meticulously crafted dough, and Canada's best smoked meats set Conspiracy apart from the rest."}
{"text":"Tasty pizza ! We opted for the Hawaiian (you can judge me, I don't care I LOVE pineapple on pizza). It was absolutely delicious with adamson smoked ham and house brined pineapple and banana peppers. It made such a difference to not have tiny hard and barely edible bits of bacon like you would usually have at the chains. Also the pineapple was super sweet and juicy.   There is only one size you can order which is the equivalent to an extra large at chains so be prepared to eat a lot of pizza. The pizza box is laughably huge.  I can easily eat four slices of regular pizza but two of conspiracy pizza was enough for me! You are obviously paying more for this pizza but it is well worth it in my opinion. Make sure you call well ahead of time as they can only make 25 pizzas per hour.   I can't wait to go back and try more !"}
{"text":"BEST PIZZA IN TORONTO!!! Creative pizzas with carefully selected toppings. Perfect crust, Great service, 10/10 would go every weekend!!!"}
{"text":"This, I can say definitively, is the best Canadian pizza I have ever had.   The shop itself is trendy and cool, although the location itself may seem a touch odd, and I cannot rave about the food itself enough. I and a few others got Steel Beams to share, and every slice was gone in a heartbeat. Very spicy, as promised, but not overwhelmingly so. Perfectly cooked. Perfect toppings. Perfectly sauced. Since then we have tried a few other options, and they have all been up to the same standard. I had been meaning to try this place for a while, and I am beyond thrilled that we did. I certainly hope their menu selection grows in the coming future, though I appreciate that they change up the specials frequently while keeping the classics consistent.  My only true complaint is that the disorganized ordering process. There's no website or online menu, you just have to find their Instagram and attempt to figure out what the options are, and then make sure you order as soon as the 4:30 window opens in order to get a slot. I understand that the business is still relatively new, so I'll excuse it for now considering the great quality of food, but I do hope that they can get their act together a bit. For the customer's sake, I'd love to see a consistently updated and easily accessible menu."}
{"text":"We ordered pizza from Conspiracy this weekend. It's very good, but there's still some room for improvement.  We had the Bay of Pigs with pulled pork and bacon, conspiracy with brisket and jalapenos, and the veggie with squash and beets. The pizzas are gigantic. Four adults did not even come close to finishing three pizzas.  First of all, the meat was spectacular, as you would expect coming from sister restaurant Adamson barbecue. I especially enjoyed the bacon and pork on the Bay of Pigs. The veggie pizza was good, almost a dessert pizza with slight sweetness plus manchego tang.  My one quibble, and what keeps this from 5 stars, is the way the pizzas are made. They are essentially crust plus cheese plus meat, with some sort of sauce on top (bbq sauce, mustard, etc.). It's a little dry, almost like eating a sandwich rather than pizza. Related to this is that the toppings are concentrated in the centre and don't go out far enough. Don't get me wrong, I like eating a sandwich, but I like my pizza to be saucier.  Anyway, really good, and interesting pizza flavours. Will be back."}
{"text":"Ordered the Cowspiracy and the Halifax Explosion and both were amazing. Highly recommend the pizza. The sauces were a bit sweet for my taste (seems like it's the sauce that they would put on the pizza) but the food was awesome."}
{"text":"Ordered the Hawaiian pizza. Fresh ingredients, well prepared, pizza wasn't greasy and the crust wasn't burnt, generous portions of toppings. Made as it was described on their menu. Pizza tasted great! Huge props for that. Friendly staff took my order over the phone and greeted me at the store. I didn't feel rushed. Pizza was ready for pick up at the time when I was told it would be. Store was clean, bright and well decorated to go with the theme of the brand. Pizza slices are big, a challenge for me to carry in one hand to eat but that was easily solved after a couple of bites :)"}
