{"text":"Did not like, few selections, not really cost effective"}
{"text":"The food was ok, the prices was too high and very few selection dinner choices. Will not return, because of false statement made of another restaurant, very unprofessional"}
{"text":"Pizza was soggy and the salad had so much dressing it was too difficult to eat. Service was great though. Don't think I will try again."}
{"text":"I've been to this chain before, just not this location.  What a disappointment.  First,  I asked the server questions about a specific pizza on the menu which she readily answered.  However, when it came time to order and I ordered this pizza, I was told that the pizza oven was broken--are you kidding me???? An Italian Grill with no pizza oven--why not tell me that when I first inquired about the pizza!  So back to the drawing board, I decided on the lasagna--figured that would be a safe bet.  What a disappointment.  A portion about the size of a deck of playing cards arrived on a large white plate--creating an enormous amount of negative space on the plate--further accentuating the minuscule portion size.  Honestly, I've seen much larger portions at my child's elementary school!  If that wasn't bad enough, the lasagna was made without any cheese--no layers of ricotta between the layers of pasta, and if there had been any cheese on top, it had hardened since it was cooked the first time.  It was camouflaged with a marinara sauce. dumped on top.  Had it not been for the bread, I would have starved!  I will not be returning!!!"}
{"text":"Went into carrabbas last night and it was wonderful! Our waitress Megan was awesome. She answered all our questions and helped me pick out my dinner and it was perfect. I came to carrabbas before and it was ok so we decide to give it another chance and I'm glad we did!"}
{"text":"My order was a phone order, and was hoping for a fast and wasy pick-up.  Phoned in my order, and waited the 20 minutes I was told.  Arrived, and took another 10 minutes for my food to be ready.  Kitchen was \"a little backed up\".  So after waiting 10 minutes, my food was ready.  Left, but when I got home, realized I was missing an appetizer.  Called and told them I was missing an item.  Had to go back and pick it up.  Said they wre sorry, but that was it.  So, my food was cold, my appetizer was warm at best, and I really did not enjoy this to go experience.  Everytime I have dinner there, service was always great as well as the food.  Will have to consider if I will dine here again."}
{"text":"First stop at this Carrabas. We ordered the crusted planko cheese ravioli and the prosciutto pork tenderloin medallions. They were both delicious. I noticed they have s 3-7 happy hour, I'm going to check that out next trip. Left full and happy."}
{"text":"Food was good, place was a disgusting mess.  There was chewing gum (chewed) on our table, dirty napkin under it. The wait staff all looked dirty and sloppy. We watched a girl try to suck up a straw wrapper with a vacuum six times before just leaving it there. How about bending down and picking it up?  She used one rag to wipe a table, then wipe seats, and then continue wiping another table. Sanitary??  I think not.   Cooks were wearing beanies, ballcaps, or nothing at all.  I understand this is a chain restaurant, but it is supposed to be an above average chain. I have been in waffle houses that were run in a more clean and professional manner!"}
{"text":"It's a chain restaurant, so you get the same taste at them all. I have been to Carrabba's many times(around charlotte, and concord), and every time I fall in love! My food is always cooked to perfection and the service is always nice.  If you plan to go on a friday, saturday, or sunday, go early  or you will have a 15-30 min wait. One time, we were told the wait was 45 mins, so we left.   I always start off with a caesar salad, which is never a let down, and a martini. I love the chicken fettuccine here because they add peas, which adds that special touch of goodness. Once I ordered a pizza from the kids menu as an appetizer, and it was pretty tasty. We have had the lasagna, chicken parm, and spaghetti. They have all been pretty good.  Carrabba's is good, better than Olive Garden in my book. But the taste will ALWAYS be the same no matter where you go."}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting this place. Im glad I did - the food is delicious. The atmosphere was very laid back and the staff was friendly. I cant remember what I had... it was some shell noodles in cheesy white sauce with chicken. It was like white cheddar shells and cheese on crack! AMAZING!!!! I will def be revisiting this place again."}
{"text":"Ok so the new proprietor is a real pro. Despite a 45 minute wait, (great to see its busy) she's done all she could to get our 7 top ready. Stay tuned for comments on the good and service."}
{"text":"Great staff and great food. Nice overall atmosphere. The chicken parmigiano is the best. Also, their bread with herbs is hot and fresh."}
{"text":"I went here recently while in the area on business and since I was alone, I pulled up a seat at the bar. I decided to start off with a salad and ordered my entree at the same time. I noticed the place was reasonably busy and expected my order to take a bit of time, but after twenty minutes went by after finishing my salad and no entree, I started to wonder if they'd forgotten my order. Just as I was getting ready to inquire, a gentleman approached me and introduced himself as one of the managing partners. He apologized for the delay, didn't make excuses, and told me my dinner was on them!  I was impressed not only by the way they handled what could have been an unpleasant experience, but was also impressed by the quality of their food even if the service was slow. I will make it a point to go here again and give them a well deserved opportunity to get the service part right next time."}
{"text":"We had a nice dinner tonight. Kate was terrific with perfect timing.  I had the filet mignon perfectly cooked. Our girls had the spaghetti and loved it. They are not easy to please! Thank you for the great dinner!"}
{"text":"MmMmMm....Italian food! Carrabba's if one of the best Italian place to eat. The service is great, the food is fantastic, and perfect place for dates or big crowds or just because. As for the prices (ranging from $10 to $20) it is really reasonable because the serving is good for two people. They have signature dishes if you do not know which one you want to try. But surely enough if you like this place as much as I do you will definitely come back for more.   I highly recommend trying the Chicken Bryan, Pollo Rosa Maria, Pasta Weesie, Lobster Ravioli, Linguine Pescatore, all are delicious and will satisfy your stomach. Every meal comes with soup or salad, the soup's are all delicious, especially with the cheese they put. The bread they serve before the meal is delicious because it's fresh and warm."}
{"text":"this place has some really good Italian dishes, really good seafood dish and the salmon is fabulous."}
{"text":"Top notch in service. Very inexpensive for the quality and quantity of food you receive. I've never had a bad experience. Jay the manager always makes you feel important and ensures everyone is happy."}
{"text":"Been there couple months ago. The food was so-so (portions were huge). The only thing I really enjoyed was the bread (got a 2nd serving it was so yummy!). My dinner came in a very heavy and salty sauce (the color of pimento cheese) that I could barely taste the food. My husband got the shrimp pasta special that he felt was good.  Although there were plenty of other seats available we were ushered into the young family with babies area. I guess we do look like a couple with a young child even though it was just us...:-).   On the positive side our waitress was very quick and checked on us often even as she had to deal with few other big tables.  The restaurant tries to be too many things at once: family restaurant, sports bar and a young crowd hang-out. Instead is just a very noisy mixed-up place with an acceptable food."}
{"text":"I normally don't write reviews but I just had to after my experience last night. Pretty much in a nutshell, it's 9pm on a Thurs, my husband & I go to get a quick bite. My Arnold Palmer was disgustingly tart, the bread was borderline stale, & service a joke. I order off their holiday special menu with all the wine dishes. It was the shrimp & scallop linguine in champagne cream sauce (with roasted red peppers & mushrooms). It takes longer to arrive than usual, by another waitress, so when a plate of shrimp a la vodka over linguine (simply shrimp, pasta & diced tomatoes in vodka sauce) is placed in front of me naturally I think she made a mistake. Nope! In her words, \"they ran out of the champagne sauce so they used the vodka cream sauce instead.\" OH DID THEY? Glad I was consulted in the decision making of what I'll be eating for dinner. I guess at Carrabba's the customer doesn't get to chose what they eat. The best part was when our server suddenly appeared after his long break with no apology or explanation. Oh & no manager either. Yea it's safe to say we'll never return."}
{"text":"The food is great but this location's customer service is poor. We had made reservations and specifically told the hostess and the server is was a birthday celebration.  We were introduced by one server but only saw her one time after she took our drink order. The rest of the service was done by three other people and they had no communication among each other. It took about 20 minutes to get our salads then our food was brought out not even two minutes later. In the process of trying to make room for more plates my drink was spilled. I assumed they would bring me a new one but it never came. So eventually I had to ask for another one and the server asked me if I was serious.   I have been to the carrabbas in chandler on ray and the 10. Everything there was FANTASTIC! I was completely thrown off by the gilbert location's poor service and how rushed they made us feel. They knew it was a birthday dinner but made the only memorable moment of the evening their poor service. I will never go back to this location again."}
{"text":"I had dinner last night for my daughter's bday an I have to say our waiter was extremely good no complaints about him however my food was horrible we orderd 2 orders of the  lobster ravioli and they came out looking different one had sauce parsley the works the other had almost no sauce or parsley note to Carrabas presentation is everything an if a party orders the same meal it should definitely look the same, the chicken parm was watery and the other pasta dishes were very bland im not sure if it was because of a busy night,  but the manager never came over, I would have felt different had the manager came over an acknowledged the bad experience, in the end we still paid for the horrible food an I will never be back there I will be sure to share my experience with anyone I know"}
{"text":"Had a great waitress and is not to blame for a poorly run restaurant.  We've been here before and love the food. Food still good when you finally get it. When we entered restaurant we were told there would be a 15 minute wait. There were empty tables but they didn't have wait staff to service them. Our service was very slow and we got our entree before the salad. Granted there could be problems but why put it on the wait staff to explain everything.  Where's the manager? Will not return. Lots of other options in Surprise now for Italian."}
{"text":"Love the food here, great service, and the atmosphere is very pleasing. The fettuccine Weesie is awesome, we order it every time we eat here. Definitely save room for Sogno di Cioccolata for desert, incredible!!!"}
{"text":"They had an event for Amici club members to try their newest items on the menu. Their Mahi Wulfie was excellent.  The berry sangria was good although a bit sweet. Our server was very friendly and nice.  This was my first-time I definitely will return."}
{"text":"We had a girl's night out at Carrabas. Bad choice of restaurant. we saw the menu on the website and had our dish picked out but was informed they stopped making it 3 weeks ago. The food was blah. Our server Mike in the bar was the only good part of our visit. Mike kept the glasses full and made us laugh. But we won't be returning this place."}
{"text":"the BEST chicken Marsala on the planet!!! really.  everything made to order fresh great people too"}
{"text":"came here with my family . started off bad . then JT came,  JT has great customer service . thank you ."}
{"text":"I'm typically not one for brand restaurants but these guys nailed it! The Cozze en Bianco is one of my favorites. Always a great meal at this restaurant."}
{"text":"I love the food and the service is great. This Sunday the service was the best I have ever had. We had a waiter named Matt who was incredible. Very kind, personable and all together a happy, pleasant person to be around. I will request him again when I return.   Also, earlier that day I had picked my wedding dress and he gave me and my parents desert on the house in celebration. If I wasn't already as pleased as I have ever been with a waiter, this sure did it. It was a very kind gesture and I appreciated him remembering the conversations we had with him. Like I said, best waiter I have ever had."}
{"text":"I have tried carrabas for years. Service and food are great. Never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Every time we go the meals are good, with plenty to take home. The cioppino, chicken Parmesan, and sirloin were all perfect, and the cheese/grape tomatoes appetizer was a delicious surprise. Tiramisu for dessert was fan-tastic!"}
{"text":"I have never had a disappointing meal here - ever! The menu is always fresh, delicious, and authentic. Not only is the food worth bragging about, but so is the service! Robbie is my absolute favorite server at this location. In addition, he makes your dining experience amazing AND he knows \"a thing or two\" (he's essentially a sommelier) about wine pairings. Love this place! Thanks, Carabbas!"}
{"text":"Both my wife and I got sick the next day after eating at Carrabba's.  The wait staff is friendly and attentive but the food was not prepared fresh or kept at safe temperatures. We will not be eating here again."}
{"text":"The food was decent for a chain restaurant, but for the price there are much better local options. The Tiramisu was aweful."}
{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised about this restaurant!  Expecting more of an Olive Garden \"vibe\", it exceeded our expectations.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was because of the slightly unorganized service.  Our waitress was friendly and great with the kids, but once I had to go to the bar to get my husband's diet coke and we had to ask other wait staff for help a couple times because our waitress was nowhere to be found.  I think our table was far from her actual \"section\".  But when we did see her (which always seemed to be seconds after we flagged another server) she was awesome!  And the food...also AWESOME!!  From the bread to the Cesar side salads to the pasta dishes, we enjoyed everything!  My husband had the Mezzaluna pasta dish which I tasted...yummy!  I had one of the special \"wood fired\" pasta dishes ( not on normal menu)....penne pasta with chicken in a pesto cream sauce with some kind of yummy melted cheese (mozzerellaish).  I wanted to finish it all, but I had to stop and take the rest home.  The warm soft bread they bring you with the olive oil for dipping was so good, too (probably why I couldn't finish my pasta).  My 2 year old loved the corkscrew pasta with Alfredo sauce, which we were able to custom order for him and my other two enjoyed the chicken fingers.  All around, everyone was happy!  We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"All I need to say is get the \"Chicken Trio\"!  They also usually have a bruschetta of the day which is always a winner.  The bread with herb oil dip is terrific but be careful not to fill up as the chicken trio dish is large and come with a salad and side dish."}
{"text":"Overated! Ok Italian, But way too expensive! And Service not so great. I rather go to Metro Pizza."}
{"text":"I caught the hostess drinking out of my child's to-go cup.  The Caesar Salad was horrible.   The lettuce had been frozen and so it was wilted. They messed up my entrée and I had to send it back.  They forgot part of my husband's order. The waitress was nice enough but I will not be back!"}
{"text":"If you want iodine poisoning and prefer to serve yourself, come here.   This is like a Maggiano's, but on a smaller scale. The hostess was nice and friendly upon walking in.  Be warned that the place is small and does not fit a party of 8 easily.  We had to wait for half an hour for an early Friday dinner and it wouldn't have been so bad had they not told us it was only going to take 10 min.  Anyway, got past that and got seated.  We ordered and ate family style:  Linguine Pescatore, Spaghetti, Pasta Carrabba, Lobster Ravioli, Seafood Cannelloni, Italian Chicken, and Calamari.  We wanted to order the Antipasti Plate and thought we did but the waiter, brought out a sampler appetizer dish instead. This leads me to my complaint:  we saw our waiter 3 times AT MOST.  It didn't look terribly busy that night but we never saw him.  He was pleasant when we did see him but that was rare.  We had to ask someone else for water refills and were constantly looking for our waiter.  It was quite odd.  We would have corrected the wrong appetizer dish but we were afraid we would never eat if we never saw him and ended up waiting longer for our food.  The owner of this establishment should be aware that the servers are not attentive and it's a darn shame!  Onto the food:  The Linguine Pescatore was boring and didn't have much flavor, Spaghetti tasted like something from a jar, Calamari was WAY to salty (even the marinara sauce couldn't compensate), Pasta Carrabba was not memorable, Lobster Ravioli was done well with good/rich flavor in an orange sauce, Seafood Cannelloni wonderfully creamy filling but a small portion, and the pizza was dry.  Overall, Carrabbas was not a good place for a meal.  The prices are about right from a place like this ($12 -$18 a dish) and the atmosphere is decent.  However, it was really annoying we never saw our waiter and that is just unforgivable."}
{"text":"This place is the BOMB! Olive Garden doesnt have a chance. Really wish they would come to Hawaii - PLEASE"}
{"text":"The restaurant smelled musty the minute we entered...as if the AC wasn't on. It was a very strong smell. Like the humidity was sky high. Later, the AC came on and the odor went away but as soon as it stopped, the smell came back. Went to use the ladies room & the cabinet under the sink was broken and on the floor. The toilet paper holder in the stall was hanging off the wall. And there was no soap in either dispenser. To make matters worse, the odor was horrendous. The hall before the restrooms smelled strongly like disinfectant and inside the restroom that smell was 10 times worse mixed with other nasty bathroom smells.  Very disapppinting overall, however, we still ate the food believe it or not & it was decent.  Wish it was better."}
{"text":"Unbelievable bad customer service and lack of attention to basic restaurant customer requirements. We were looking for a Happy Hour on a Thursday, and found them online listing their Happy Hours as 4-7 so went in at 6:00 pm.  There were two booths open in the bar,  but full of dirty dishes.  There was a long community table in the center of the bar area. I sat in a dirty  booth waiting for friends who were parking the car.  5 minutes later,  no service, no cleaning no acknowledgement of me a the booth even though there was a server for the other 3 booths of people in the bar.  My 2 friends join me and we decide to sit at the clean community table.  Another 5 minutes no contact no service.  Went up to bartender who had only one customer sitting a the bar, and asked if anyone is servicing the tables.  She said the community table was up to the restaurant hostesses to manage.  I asked if the available booths in the bar could be cleaned off so we could sit there,  and she said that server for those booths doesn't start until 6:30 pm.   So, there's no service available for your bar patrons??   She said \"Go ask the Hostesses,  I really don't know.\"  So I go to the Hostess stand where there are 2 girls about 18 working the stand who look all surprised that there would be a customer in the bar who wanted service.  They also said they were not ready to have service at the open tables in the bar. !!?!!!?  Then a manger came up and said, \"Sorry but we don't have any available servers in the bar until 6:30.\"  REALLY???!!!  So of course we just walked out.  Unbelievably Stupid.  How can this be happening in this kind of establishment?  You will have to be your own busser and waiter too, apparently."}
{"text":"We came here for our friend's birthday. It was her first birthday after spending the last year in the hospital and rehab. We were looking forward to celebrating.    My husband and I arrived a few minutes after the rest of the party. I should have known there were going to be problems as we never received menus. We borrowed them from others at the table. I ordered our drinks. They brought my husband Root beer instead of Coke.   The biggest issue for me was once our orders started to arrive. There were 9 in our party. We received 4 dinners, then about 15 mins later, 2 more, and then about 10 minutes later the remaining 3. The last 3 that were served were our birthday guest, her husband, and the 4 year old at the table. The birthday girl was still waiting on her meatballs, but we couldn't flag down our server.  One of the dinners was served cold. The 4 year old's pizza was all bread, very little cheese, and like many 4 year old kids,  she  was really only interested in eating the cheese off the top.    The manager came over to ask how everything was, and we let him know that we were still missing the meatballs, and one of the meals was cold. My friend didn't want the meal remade because of the time it had already taken to get the first one!  I explained to the manager that it was my friends birthday and I asked him if he could \"make it special\" for her. He said he would make it special.   Make it special apparently meant comping the birthday dessert, which from what I can tell is a service they already provide. However, the waitress initially came over and said the manager had offered dessert due to the poor service. The birthday girl and cold dinner girl ordered dessert, no other desserts were ordered. The waitress came back again and informed us only the birthday dessert was on the house. (Really?! The $5 mini cannoli was going to break the bank?!)  My food was good, I really have no complaints but the service was just horrible. We started dinner at 5pm and didn't leave until after 7:30.  My water was never refilled, actually I don't think anyone at the table had their water refilled. The table set up was difficult to deal with as well, and when we needed to leave the table, we had to walk around the table behind us to get out. It was very tightly cramped with tables, chairs, waitresses and patrons.   As we were leaving, I noticed there were about 20 people waiting to be seated. Had the service been more efficient, those folks wouldn't have had to wait so long to get a table. Carrabba's recently updated it's menu, but that won't help unless they look at their process flow, serve time and space needs to improve the efficiency of service."}
{"text":"11/16/2013  -  One of my children and my husband were out of town, so I decided to treat my other two children and myself to dinner at Carrabba's Italian Grill.  We usually only go on special occasions.  We went at 4 o'clock and were seated right away, party of 3, used to having to wait for our party of 5.  The hostess sat us at the last table in the corner in the bar area.  I would have preferred the area closer to the chefs, my children enjoying watching them cook, but I thought we would give it a try.    Our waiter, Cesar (he didn't introduce himself), approached and was ready to take our drink order.   We got our drinks and our bread with the dipping oil.    My daughter wanted to get the pizza dough (that they usually give children) to play with.  He hadn't offered it to her, and we weren't able to track him down due to our desolate table.  We couldn't find the waiter for drink refills because another service brought us our food but he showed up eventually.  My daughter ordered a kids spaghetti and my son and I ordered the Spiedino de Mare - it is not on the menu but still available ( I order it every time I come - for over 15 years).  It is pasta with shrimp and scallops.  Service was good, food was excellent and we will go back again except sit closer to the kitchen."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to this Carrabba's and usually tip very well. I could not bring myself to do so this time. The service was awful. We did not get what we ordered when we ordered it. We didn't get checked on... no refills and kind of rude attitude.   The ambiance was very wrong for a Carrabba's. It is far too bright in this restaurant and there were way too many high school kids talking about contraception.  We need to get one thing straight. Tiramisu is composed of ladyfingers soaked in espresso and marsala wine with coffee liquor layered in marscapone cheese. What was brought to us was dry sponge cake  with whipped creme layers. Do not spend 7.90 on this dish.... or better yet go to the Carrabba's in a better part of town."}
{"text":"Yep, it's a chain restaurant, and perhaps by nature it's a bit sterile.  But it's a GOOD sterile.  Food: Actually really good overall.  The roast pork special was excellent, the lobster ravioli was quite good, and the chicken marsala was passable but a little salty.  The meals all come with salads, and we really liked that they refrigerate the salad plates.  On the beverage side, there's a full bar, and all the wines are available by the glass, which is good for us.  Service: Here's what we were impressed with last night in particular.  The waitstaff all really seemed to be enjoying themselves and brought us into their fun.  And they were attentive and everything was delivered promptly and correctly at the same time.  Decor: Ok, it's corporate italian, but again, its a GOOD corporate italian. Nice lighting, particularly in the booths, which feel more intimate than the tables in the middle."}
{"text":"You are all sheep for loving this place.  f I want boring, uninspiring, factory made americanized italian  food, drenched in cheese, like EVERYTHING in cheese, then I will come here.   Yuck. Every one of my three courses was sub-par and was either cheesy or too salty, or both. I would have never walked in the door if I hadn't gotten a gift card from someone who should have known better.  F'in hate this place.  Could have cooked a better sauce at home blind folded.  Did I tell you how much I despise these kinds of places?"}
{"text":"Carrabbas is by far my favorite restaurant! I'm from Michigan and was always a regular there. Unfortunately there isn't a carrabbas in California where I am now located so we stopped at the one in Vegas on our drive back home. We didn't look the greatest just got done driving 36 hours and they treated us no different! We had a great experience with our server Jennifer. She suggested new things that I never even heard of at the Carrabbas in Michigan which really surprised me. She was very nice and gave us great service. Overall I highly recommend this carrabbas all the food is great I'm hooked on the Sicilian chicken soup and Caesar salad but all of it taste amazing!"}
{"text":"Usually this place is really nice! However today it was not so much.   While there was a short wait, the table we sat at was not ideal, due to it being next to the kitchen and serving area. The waitress was fast at getting our food at first, however it took longer than we thought to get a salad and two soups. Later, when she was grabbing our empty glasses, she spilled some water onto the person I was eating with, making his phone wet as well as some water getting into the soup. The replacement soup that we HAD to ask for was greasy AND ask for a towel to dry off with, which by the way took forever to come to our table. The main dishes we ordered took forever to come by and after she gave us our towel she never came back until we got our check."}
{"text":"Carrabbas markets itself as an upscale Italian restaurant but doesn't quite fulfill its promise. The dimly lit restaurant and open kitchen with woodfire oven creates a good mood and typically for dinner service it's mostly filled and the wait service is prompt. Foodwise, it is similar to Olive Garden but for a higher cost. The lasagna, polla rosa maria, veal marsal and chicken parmegian all are about as good as you could make at home - I most recently had the polla rosa maria and unfortunately the fontina cheese was a liquid mess on the plate instead of adding to the texture of the chicken. Still, the portions are fine and the food is never poor - however, you may end up feeling disappointed  for the cost."}
{"text":"We love this place. Great atmosphere. Terrific food. Make sure to go for half off appetizers during happy hour. The only downside is the really long wait, but we lucked out and got in after 10 minutes or so last Saturday."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here tonight for our one year wedding anniversary. We first came in and had appetizers before a movie and the service was quick, friendly, and really enjoyed ourselves. After the movie, we decided to walk back over for dinner and the experience, again, was phenomenal. We were seated quickly, we didn't wait long for our dinner, the service was quick and attentive, and my dinner was amazing. I had never been to a Carrabas before and I was 100% impressed. Even the bartender welcomed us back. Both my husband and I have worked in the restaurant industry and owned and operated our own restaurants. We both agreed that we hadn't had that great of an experience in a while. I've never written a review before but I would like thisestablishment to be aware of our fantastic review and award their amazing front and back of the house staff. Thank you all!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here last night for a nice celebration dinner. We sat at the bar. The service and the bartender's were nice. My husband ordered the salmon with zucchini and I ordered the chicken Alfredo with a salad. My husband loved his salmon I got a taste and it was great. Now back to my dish. My salad tasted like fish and my pasta was dry. I asked for a side of Alfredo sauce. At that point I was done eating so I poured the sauce in my to go box and thought this would make great leftovers. Guess not! I heated up my pasta and it was nothing but an oily mess! Talk about cutting corners, no wonder why the sauce was so thin.. it was all oil... Won't make that oily mistake twice. Hope I don't get sick from all that oil!"}
{"text":"Eat there every birthday. My favorite Italian restaurant in surprise."}
{"text":"The only reasons that this location is getting 2 stars and not one, are the two gentlemen prepping the food: pizza and salad station. It was Sunday evening and these two employees had more personality and customer interaction than most of the wait team put together.  Our server who had only us to take care of, could not even keep my glass filled with water.  The young lady who delivered our food was madder than hell at our server( we heard their conversation) and we were the \" punching bag\" for her dissatisfaction. I could not even finish pushing my salad plate ( which by the way I was still eating) out  of her way, so she could \"dump\" my plate in from of me.  Food: Oh my!!! My husbands was without any flavor ( apparently salt and paper was forgotten) and mine was soooooo over salted and burnt that it was hard to eat. For years I ate the same dish here so the thing that I was served was totally unacceptable.  I usually don't complain ( hate waisting food).  So when I got home I tried to call to give my feedback to the manager and not to write the review. Manager was not available to talk to me, her customer so unfortunately she will have to learn about my experience here in the public forum."}
{"text":"Normally, I don't really complain about my visits to restaurants as I personally make a note to myself not to go there in the future. My parents and I drove 30 minutes to this location as this is the closest one to us. We were craving Italian and so we went. First the host didn't even smile or say hi, he simply said how many in your party. We were then seated. We sat down and were given a menu to look at and my parents and I have decided what we wanted to eat and drink. We started talking and hoping a waiter or waitress would show up and nothing. Ten minutes and nothing. And then my dad said we have been seating down for 20 minutes and no one has even offered us to drink or said to us we will be with you in a moment. And we simply got up and left and the workers looked at us walking out. But thank you for acknowledging our exit though."}
{"text":"On November 17, a couple of friends and myself went out to dinner at Carrabba's Italian Grill. The only other time I've ate Carrabba's was at a banquet for our swim team my junior year of high school, so needless to say I was pretty excited about having dinner there finally.  The moment we pulled up I could taste the melt-in-your-mouth Italian bread from its scent lingering heavily in the air. As we entered there were two hostesses, both with cheerful, smiling faces, ready to seat us. Unlike most hostesses that I have run into, the one who seated us was chatty the entire way to our booth. Personally it made me feel more relaxed and able to enjoy what was about to come.  After a few minutes our server, Randy, walked over  to grab our drink order. He was very nice and knowledgeable of the menu (although he could never get any of us a refilled drink before the previous one was completely empty). My friend was going to order the Mezzaluna, a ravioli with chicken, ricotta, and spinach in a delicious tomato sauce; however, Randy suggested a rigatoni that was similar to the one she had chose. The rigatoni was loaded with chicken, unlike the Mezzaluna, which had a quarter of the chicken this dish had.  I, on the other hand, couldn't be talked out of my manicotti. Although the crisp, freshly baked Italian bread and Caesar salad were to die for, I, unfortunately, couldn't say the same for their manicotti. The noodles were undercooked, making them hard to cut and there was not an adequate amount of mozzarella cheese melted over them. Their pomodoro sauce was bland and added very little, if any, flavor to the dish. Also, it was a lot smaller than I had hoped for. There were two measly manicotti shells in an oval shaped bowl the size of a kids macaroni and cheese dish.  Overall, the experience was fairly a good one. The waiter could have been more attentive to our needs, such as bringing over fresh drinks before the old ones were almost three quarters gone. There could have also been larger portion sizes for the price of the meal. Up to that point I might have gone back and given it one more chance.  As we were leaving though, the head chef was walking through the restaurant and asking everyone how they were enjoying their visit and the food. It was something I have never seen a chef do in all the years I have been going out to  eat. I admired how the chef was walking through the restaurant interacting with his customers when the place wasn't exactly slow. He walked by everyone's table asking how the food and service had been. I will definitely go back at least one more time."}
{"text":"First time dining here and would definitely go back. Was greeted promptly by our server Anthony who kindly let me sample the blackberry sangria prior to ordering. It was delicious!   My boyfriend and I decided to do the special Monday menu that included an app/dessert, soup or salad then our choice of entree. We started with the calamari which was good. Then had our salads which came with an awesome house cream parm dressing which was amazing (beware, lots of garlic!) !!! To follow, my boyfriend LOVED his lasagna & I had a great shrimp + scallop dish with a side of pasta in their vodka tomato cream sauce. Everything was delicious and we even ended with a strawberry cheesecake that was divine!  Service was excellent and attentive. I really appreciated all the recommendations and look forward to going back and trying more things on the menu!"}
{"text":"Horrible place.  I use to work there and most of the kitchen staff was on coke. Food was never cooked to standard and management never seamed to care. I place numerous complaints about cleanliness and was ignored. I WOULD not eat there"}
{"text":"Mozzarella sticks were bomb but then I realized someone needs to wear a hair net there was not just one hair but two hairs and I mentioned to the server and relieved an apology the veal Marcella was by far the worst I have ever eaten one piece was chewy and rubber texture with no flavor and my sauce was broken I did not mention it but I will keep in mind for the future the only thing good about my experience was my server however I didn't go to the restaurant for the server sad"}
{"text":"I went there for the first time tonight. Getting in was superfast even though it was quite busy. Unfortunately we waited a Really long time for service due to a miscommunication between staff, but Chris, the manager, was very kind and gracious and more than made up for any inconvenience.  Louis the other manager, and Hannah the server were all very friendly and kind and made us feel comfortable and appreciated. I will be back frequently due to the outstanding food and their honest apology for the situation. I was so uncomfortable complaing, but Chris assured us that's the only way to keep it from happening again to someone else and that they wouldn't want us to not come back due to a bad experience (how'd he know, that's exactly what I would do). Great staff. Great food and the best blackberry sangria I've ever had."}
{"text":"I love their atmosphere. Its nice, elegant, yet quiet and very personal. The food is good and fresh. I think they are slightly over priced on their wine, but overall very nice. I loved their manicotti! The staff are very pleasant."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try Carrabbas for a very long time and once I did I was rather dissappointed. Maybe my hopes were a little too high but the food was just okay and the service wasn't too great also. I have only been here once so I will have to give it another try and update my review once I do so."}
{"text":"Service was fair, environment was nice. Wasnt crowded at all and inside temps were cooler. We had a trainee and her lead was very professional we didnt get the full order but they were quick to address it and the rest of order was delivered promptly...Trio order creation is a good choice of you have a hard time finding a entree, also had a mixed drink and they know how to make a solid drink. They dont seem like they do much for birthdays so if you're looking for a good birthday song i dont recommend. Over all food was good, service was awsome and we will likely eat there again..."}
{"text":"Order salmon and asparagus. The asparagus was burnt, salmon OK nothing to brag about. That dish shouldn't have left the kitchen that way. The waitor was nice, but he should have said something regarding the asparagus, like let me get you a new order when he placed the plate down in front of me. The waitor offered a new order once I said, I wasn't paying for the asparagus. A little too late. I was ready to leave. I'm not returning. It wasn't impressive for what you pay for. I don't mind paying for a good meal, but I expect it to be well worth the price."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here on a Monday, and we we chose to sit at the bar where we were served promptly. We're foodie types, but we're not food snobs by any means. We went to Carrabba's because we were craving an unhealthy chain or diner type style of food (and I had a giftcard!). The service was fine, despite being slightly irritated that the bartender suggested that my ID was fake, since I'm young-ish and I have a an out-of-state ID. The Chianti was the special, and I enjoyed it. His Margarita was too sour for him, but the bartender set the expectation that it was a mix, so that's on us. We ordered quite a few things, and we didn't like any of it. The salad was coated and dripping with dressing. The minestrone was flavorless, and I suspect it wasn't cooked for very long, because the vegetables were undercooked. Plus, I like pasta in my minestrone, and it lacked that. The calamari was breaded with a breading that would be comparable to chicken strip breading,  and the squid itself was \"meh\". My lobster mac-and-cheese had a thin cheese sauce that didn't coat the noodles, and the lobster was terrible: it tasted like it was from a can-- very fishy smelling and tasting. He had an Alfredo and shells dish with chicken. I thought it was better than my dish, but he barely touched it. The sauce was runny, and the chicken (and the entire dish, for that matter) tasted and smelt frozen, like a frozen dinner. The food we ordered is pretty simple to do right, so there is no excuse for how bad it was. I understand why a chain would use frozen food, and I'd accept that if the establishment wasn't charging me over $15 for it. There are fine dining Italian restaurants with comparable prices, so if you're looking for good Italian, you certainly should look elsewhere. If you're looking for some fried food and some unhealthy, home-style cheesy dishes, buy a box of mac-n-cheese and bag of frozen fried items from Giant Eagle--because that would be better than eating at Carrabba's. Oh yeah, I also woke up in the middle of the night with indigestion, and I puked the following morning.  If you don't dig food poisoning, I suggest dining elsewhere. :)"}
{"text":"I don't understand the \"call ahead\" service Carrabba's offers when u call ahead 15 minutes before u leave the house and they ask how long till u arrive and then drive 15 to get there and have to still wait and additional 25 when u arrive? Confused and annoyed by this the food is good but customer service sucks! And by the way the hostess is very rude and should not roll her eyes at the guests that put money in her pocket! Be polite seriously! Call ahead is crap? Have reservations or nothing it's worthless to think call ahead is important ????"}
{"text":"Calamari  tased like something from the frozen food section of the supermarket. Terrible way to start off a meal. The rest of meal was decent."}
{"text":"I love this place from start of meal the the end of the meal. They have great salads but I always get the mamas scipy chicken. Chicken, small round noodles, carrots, celery, potatoes to help thicken it, spices to give it a little kick. So good. I then usually get the chicken trio with the garlic mashed potatoes. They cook this chicken on an open flame and gives it the great char taste (char not burnt) and it juicy. The garlic mashed potatoes are really yummy too. Not to much garlic, just right. Of coarse the dessert. Even if there is no room for it I always order it even if I take it home. The called the Sogno Di Chiocclate (chocolate Dream) I am dreaming about just telling you about it. It is for the chocolate lover. It is fudge brownie that has kahlua brushed on it, chocolate mousse, whipped cream and a home made chocolate sauce (that is to die for) all put together. It is the perfect bite."}
{"text":"This place is terrible. My fiancé and I visited with our daughter. We walked in and noticed there were several tables available but were given their pager and asked to wait 10 or 15 minutes. We waited and waited and waited. Needless to say we got tired of waiting and left. Terrible customer service. We will never be back! Fortunately there are several other restaurants close by that are wonderful!!!"}
{"text":"Probably the best chain Italian out there right now. Good overall meal. Try the porkchops! Not on the menu."}
{"text":"BLUF, party of 6 during lunch on a Saturday. Ordered Calamari, Bruschetta, Shrimp pasta and Chicken Caesar salad. Marinara sauce for the calamari was way too salty, I couldn't include a picture of the Caesar salad because either they forgot to make it or they were looking for Caesar lol.  The pasta was prepared well, shrimp was a little bit over cooked but the favor compensated for it so over all 3.5, If it wasn't for the mixup of my order or the salty marinara sauce I would rate them a 4.0 overall."}
{"text":"I had been to Carrabba's years and years ago and didn't really like it, so hadn't ever been back. It just wasn't a place I wanted to go to if I was going out to eat. But we had friends in town this week, and they chose this place. And I have to say, I was very impressed! It was so good! The bread to start with is DELICIOUS. We ordered the bruschetta appetizer - it was good but not my favorite. I ordered the lobster ravioli which was really good, and my husband got the Chicken Bryan which was the standout. It was so good! He said it was one of the best chicken dishes he's had at any restaurant. The chicken had such a great flavor.   I'm not a huge fan of restaurant chains, but I have to say that we will definitely be back. This wasn't my favorite restaurant ever, and the service could have been better, so I can't give it five stars. But it really was a delicious meal."}
{"text":"We placed a \"to go\" food order for our company Christmas Party.  The order was placed by phone at the location on McDowell in Avondale.   We had about 20 people coming to our house at 6 pm on Friday night.  I went to the Carrabba's about 5:30 to pick up our order.  They couldn't find our order, but after several phone calls discovered the food was waiting for us at their Surprise location.  Rather than offer to redo our order in Avondale I was told I could pick it up in Surprise.  You can understand my anger.   I told them to forget it and that we would order pizza for our party.  The upside to the story is that we had not paid for the food, which was several hundred dollars.  I wonder what the Surprise location did with all that food??  Sadly, this location seems to be going downhill.  That is so unfortunate, because good restaurants are hard to find.   We won't go back here again."}
{"text":"Food was good and reasonably priced. Service was excellent.  Pasta was a little oily for my taste."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, food was good. Had about 6 people and no one anything really to complain about.  Nothing to brag about either though.  I would go back and try it again."}
{"text":"Way to Wow!  During my visit this evening, both my waiter \"Josh\" and his manager provided an \"Outstanding Customer Experience\". Carrabba's is very fortunate to have staff and manager's that believes in Customer Service. Acculades to the both of you!"}
{"text":"Love their Chicken Marsala with garlic mashed potatoes and a Cesar Salad. Lobster Ravioli is excellent."}
{"text":"The spice mix that they bring out and mix with olive oil to dip your bread in is simply out of this world. I'm not sure how the do it. But, I can not find the words to describe how fantastic it tastes. The rest of the food was just as good. I have always loved Carraba's when I was living in Kansas City. This location was even better."}
{"text":"Ok, like this was the most scrumptious Italian meal I have had since eating in Italy!!!  I had heard about this place, but always thought it was a Mexican restaurant, but finally tried it awhile back, and man, i hate like a littler oinker!  Everything from Apps to the luscious lemon bread pudding was terrific, though I tend to eat way too much bread and that has some of the best.  Thank goodness they pack leftovers up very nicely and give you it all in a shopping bag [G].  The water was THE BEST; and, if I can remember his name, I will specifically ask for his station again!!!!  Even the owner/manager came by to ensure everything was ok and even left a coupon for a free APP on next visit; oh what to choose; hmmmm, shrimp scampi - YUMMO  I would MOST definitely recommend Carrabbas; just wish they did lunch during the week, but will just have to settle for dinner or nice weekend lunch!!!!"}
{"text":"PHENOMENAL!!!  We always enjoy our dining at this location.  The food, service, ambiance, and friendliness of the staff are top notch.  Our server, Sarah could be the host of \"The Chew\".  She was knowledgeable of the menu items and gave us the opportunity to substitute sauces and pastas.  On this particular visit, nothing could have prepared us for the wings by Tony!!!  We were literally linking our fingers!  The manager Steve visited our table and thanked us for visiting.  We'll definitely be back!!!!"}
{"text":"The chicken bryan, marsala, rosa maria are all great. MAMA MANDOLA'S SICILIAN CHICKEN SOUP is also very good. The sesoning the put in the olive oil with your bread is awesome. The bad thing is they do not have a decent salad or side dish.  So go for the chicken, and bread, but don't expect to have good salad or side dish with your meal."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best (and consistently so) service in phoenix...for the prices. Amazing!! The servers are always happy and smiling - they are quick and my glass is never empty The food is always equally amazing...wonderfully hot and steaming and the flavor is superb hard combination in todays chain restaurant monopoly"}
{"text":"Horrible food. The pasta was mashed together and overly done. I never ate fettuccine so poorly done in my life. I ended up sending my food back because it was too old, salty, and gross. It was a waste of trip to there."}
{"text":"I had a very good dinner with my wifey!  Great service, good and tasty dinner, and good atmosphere:). Recommend Carrabas at San Tan for wholesome dinner out with family. Great values what you get!"}
{"text":"Really didn't feel like cooking tonight, and it is my cheat day, so I tried this place.  The food was amazing, while not on the healthy side, it made for a great cheat meal.  I'll have to come back and try something new on the menu.  I give this place a bit thumbs up!!!"}
{"text":"We went to Carrabba's in Frazer tonight for dinner.  Probably the best dining experience I have ever had.  We were greeted at the door with smiles.   Our waitress is hands down the best we have ever had.  Even the young man that brought out our dinner was nice.  We met the owner.  She just bought the restaurant about a year and a half ago.  Great experience and reasonable.   Food was great.  So if you haven't been there in a while.GO"}
{"text":"They have amazing food in great portions and wonderful, funny, caring, and selfless servers. The place is gorgeous. I definitely recommend."}
{"text":"this place is one of the best!!! had a great waiter named brandon...excellent service and wonderful food!"}
{"text":"Slow service my salad was brown manager had a attitude when  he walked over I asked if he would eat it said its the time of the year that the lettuce is brown such a joke"}
{"text":"I have become a fan of this place. I work a lot and don't have many nights off. This restaurant won me over. The staff is always friendly and nice. The food is above average and they have lots of specials and it really is a good bang for your Buck. I usually sit at the bar. Chris is a great bartender who always seems happy and remembers you. His only fault is he is a lions fan but he can fix that. LOL. I can honestly say there has never been any problem and I always feel welcome. I highly recomend this place."}
{"text":"We absolutely enjoyed our visit. Never had a bad meal at Carrabbas and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"I went here with a friend last week and we really enjoyed our meal.  The service was excellent and fast, the food was tasty and reasonably priced. My friend had a salad and I had the chicken marsala.  We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"This is our go to dinner restaurant. Service is great, food is  even better and the blackberry sangria makes me happy :) Try the Chicken Bryan and don't be afraid of the goats cheese. I didn't think I'd like it but I tasted a friends and the cheese is smooth and mild. Since that taste almost two years ago I haven't ordered anything but Chicken Bryan. The bread and herb oil is delicious too."}
{"text":"Great service...but the restaurant changed their lighting with no way to dim the lights..feels like you are in an interegation room., sooo bright..not good atmosphere..."}
{"text":"We were greeted very abruptly, no welcome and hurried to our table. The waitress was very nice and the food was excellent. The hostess did make our visit most unwelcome and uncomfortable but everything else was good."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant, been going for years...very little personnel turnover...great food."}
{"text":"This place is so awesome I love it so much. The staff is friendly and the service is fast. The food is amazing. Also great for date nights. The manager Chad personally took time to check on us and make sure our food was to par. What a great leader and manager."}
{"text":"I had the citrus arugula salad which I get from time to time and it is a good consistent healthy option. It has arugula, spinach, oranges, and chopped pistachios. The citrus vinaigrette dressing is light and is a great compliment to the salad. My friend got the cedar plank salmon, which is her favorite.   They always have seasonal specials which are fresh and full of flavor. Drink specials are awesome especially the sangria, different flavors and soooo tasty, you can share and get a larger cantor.  Staff is always friendly. Ambiance is nice, with a view into the kitchen. I haven't waited more than 5 minutes for a table.  I highly recommend carrabas. It's well above Olive Garden, and the prices aren't so bad either"}
{"text":"Server, Miguel, was frustrated from the start to wait on my family   He came over to the high top at the bar throwing out beverage napkins, I would not have noticed but my 10 year old daughter told me this. It's Amore Monday and on the bottom of that menu it states,  ask your server about our five dollar glasses of wine, so I did. He seemed annoyed and told me, \"there are a lot of wines for $5, I will have to go and get the list\".   We ordered finally received our drinks, the wine was good, but not sure which one I received.  We never saw Miguel after that.  Another server/food runner brought us our soups/salads and apps.  The manager brought our food, Miguel never stopped at our table to ask how everything was. In fact, we couldn't along with another one or two tables could not find him.  My family's food was piping hot, mine, mahi and broccoli was cold. Miguel, not in sight. I had to let the manager know. By the time my food was ready my family was finished eating and I no longer wanted to eat. The manager was GREAT! She took off my meal and boxed it up. Miguel came over to deliver the check, never apologized, never mentioned anything about the meal. My 10 Year old daughter gave the cc to the manager because Miguel never came back to collect. We love Carrabbbas BUT this was one of the worst experiences I have had at a restaurant and that's because Miguel was not doing his job. Thanks to the manager and the rest of the crew for picking up how slack!"}
{"text":"It's my daughter's 14th birthday, she wants to celebrate at Carrabas we take her. Sorry to say that from the start our waiter Taylor was rude. He brought my husband and daughter's drink and said mine would be coming. He then proceeded to take the table next to ours order, they came in after us. We don't see him for awhile, then we see him coming with a tray of drinks, as he walks by literally he puts my drink on the table and stops to serve the table next to us. He then comes to our table to ask if we are ready to order. I tell him we were ready before he started taking care of the table that came after us. Taylor doesn't recognize his rudeness and is put out when I ask him what took him so long. At that point I realize its best to leave the restaurant for fear of having our food mess with.  Our daughter chose Carrabas because it was her favorite restaurant as a little girl and had good memories."}
{"text":"I'm Italian; Carrabba's is my choice. There's very few GOOD Italian restaurants in the South, but Carrabba's fills that void. I'd like to try other dishes they serve but I so love their Lasagna, I can't contain myself and end up ordering the Lasagna. I believe they use Goat cheese over Ricotta cheese which adds so much more flavor to the dish. Exceeds my expectations for an Italian restaurant chain."}
{"text":"Tonight was the third strike for this place and they failed again.  Every time my fiance and I went to this restaurant in the past we were seated in the bar area, I am assuming it is because we are in our late twenties.  The service in the bar area is terrible and the tables are about half the size of the ones in the dining room.  We had a friend over and thought we would give them one last chance.  After waiting for a table for over half an hour they called a party of older people up who had arrived after us and our party at the same time.  The older party was walked to the dining room and we were walked to the bar.  We sat for a moment and then decided to leave.  I am not going to pay their prices to eat in a bar again.  The food is good but three times in a row shows how they treat younger people."}
{"text":"The food was delicious as always. The server was very kind but very slow. They didn't seem to be too busy as an excuse for it either. Also, all four of my family members ordered a shirley temple and not one of them came with cherries. We requested cherries on the side because that is our favorite part and jokingly made a big deal about it. He came back with 4 cherries, one for each of us. I guess we just expected more from such a nice establishment."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Every time I've been to this location I leave with a smile on my face. When my mom comes to town for a visit this is where she wants to go. She loves the food but especially loves the friendly staff.  Keep up the good work! Service matters and the staff at this location knows it."}
{"text":"My first time at a Carrabba's and it surprised me in quality and service.   The dough wasn't good for the pizza, and instead of serving sub par stuff to my friend the GM came out and explained what happened and offered any other entree. It was classy and put a restaurant that can get mixed in with other mid-grade italian places that extra star. We came on Wine Wednesday and had the Sangria which was delicious."}
{"text":"Wow I can't believe how disappointing our meal to go was.  I've never ever seen such small portions. I ordered veal piccata and it was tiny there was two small thin medallions. I also ordered calamari specifically for the lemon butter sauce and I never got it I got marinara. Sad state of affairs at this place never ever again even if it was free."}
{"text":"My husband and I went there twice now....it's not too bad for the price that you pay.  The appetizer was pretty good, it was shrimp with sun dried tomato on the flat bread.  I ordered Penne with artichokes, olives, and tomatoes.  My husband ordered seafood dish with pasta.  If you want an inexpensive Italian place, but still want to have some good meals, you can try it out."}
{"text":"SO SO good!  Minestrone is excellent; salmon under homemade tomato vinagarette.  Garlic mashed potatoes awesome.  Get in there and eat!"}
{"text":"Horrible service.  The restaurant wasn't even full and took forever to bring our food.  The calamari was salty. I felt like I was eating a salt brick.  The food is definitely not worth the price."}
{"text":"Outstanding food and service as usual. Love the Pollo Rosa Maria.  Can make a meal out of the bread with olive oil and spices.  Love it!!!"}
{"text":"This place is recommended fairly highly mostly for how the meal starts out.  They bring out oil and warm bread but they sprinkle spices on a small plate before pouring the oil.  It is a simple but the best olive oil and bread combination I have had at any Italain restaurant.  They have 2 outstanding appetizers:  the Scotty Thompson and calamari with red sauce.  They have another sauce but it's not good.  The Scotty Thompson is off-menu and not always available.  It is a simple bruschetta with cheese and red sauce that is surprisingly good.  Their soups are good to outstanding.  My favorite is the spicy sausage and lentil but it's not always available.  Their soups are better than their salads.  The house is bland and the Ceasar's not much better.  When it comes to entrees they drop off a bit.  B&B and Circo are better but their steak and double pork chop marsalas are pretty good.    For 2 people who share an appetizer and don't get wine, you can keep it under $60 including the tip.  We have never gotten to dessert because we are stuffed by then.  As a value, it is definitely recommended."}
{"text":"We thought we'd celebrate our four year anniversary here (since they catered our wedding -- which was a disaster) but should have known the service and food was going to be well below average. Our waitress had a crappy attitude and kept mumbling things under her breath. Bad day? It took over an hour to get our food -- which came out cold and with a lovely surprise, plastic/glass in a children's meatball. YES! YOU READ THAT CORRECTLY. The manager handled the situation professionally but I do NOT recommend this location."}
{"text":"I would be remiss if I didn't update my review. After this disappointing meal, and lack of response from Teresa, I did call again to simply try to get credit for the food I didn't get. This time I got a man (can't recall his name) who identified himself as a managing partner. I explained my issue and he immediately said he would credit the whole ticket. I told him that was not necessary - just credit for the missing meal would do. He insisted and then also sent me a gift card. So glad I attempted again. Faith restored - we will go to Carrabba's again!"}
{"text":"We came on a fairly busy night and waited over an hour. The manager came by and gave us free appetizers, apologized, and took our order.   The food was awesome and very reasonably priced, and the wait staff was very friendly. But what happened when we got our bill shocked us.   When we got the bill, we saw that our entire bill, for 7 people including wine, was 13 dollars! The manager was extremely generous and we left with smiles on our faces!"}
{"text":"I don't really want to complain about the portion sizes being small....because I'm sure that most every American is used to grandeous plates across the country, but I did feel these were small. Don't worry though, I still stuffed my face and left feeling like if I could just once be anorexic, this was the day. (No offense to the food disorder peeps, however I doubt they're reading the Carrabas reviews either).  Anywho... It ended up being 1/2 price appetizers time when we arrived after a long day in Sedona and outlet mall-ing. (Great, cuz I'm near broke now!) We ordered calamari and shrimp scampi, and yes....you can bring me more bread too. Calamari seemed like a 1/2 order for 1/2 price compared to what I'm used to in Chicagoland. (Oh yeah, you're from Chicago too?! You don't say!) I do have to say these tasted a bit old, or freezer burned, or something off.... Scampi was delish tho... I wanna say 8 large shrimp surrounded by oh yeah, more bread please. But we scarfed them down drowning out shopping woes.  After that we moved on to one of the new small plates...stuff mushrooms. And they appeared almost instantly! Amazing. (Sorry to whomever these might have been for?!) So good, and so hot....4 hours later I can still tell you where that first bite hit my tongue, #templossoftastebuds. But also delish. Naturally, we debated gastric bypass and purging, but decided to order side Caesars as our 'entree', heh. Oh and some extra dressing on the side to dip the, crap (out of bread) more please?  And of course, after trading in the rental smart car for an escalade across the street to fit our newly stretched jeans into, we settled on the chocolate dreamy, cakey, frosting, dreamy, add some extra calories on top dessert....to go. (Cause eating it right there might have been grounds for a gold metal).  All in all, always great food. Portions were a bit small (but it's not like I left there starving by any means). Will be back, no questions. And to top it off, Jessica, our server - amazing. She was right there with more water, more iced tea, more bread, more menus, without even asking. Snaps to Jessica!"}
{"text":"We frequent Carrabba's in Frazer, and enjoy the food.  Most of the time, the service is good.  Upon arriving tonight, we asked to sit in the bar but the hostess offered to seat us either at the bar itself or at a high table, citing something about a rotation.  Fortunately, the manager, Brett, interrupted stating \"they can sit wherever they want\", and we were seated in a booth in the bar, as we originally requested.  The food was good, as always, as was the service from Ashley, who was also the bartender.  Throughout the meal, Brett stopped by a few times to ensure everything was to our liking.  This extra attention certainly wasn't expected, but it was definitely appreciated."}
{"text":"I like to grab curbside once in awhile thought I would tonight... No parking ... food not ready didn't even know where my food ticket was.. Oh did I mention 20 min later I'm still waiting!? What... Very disappointed! Will not be coming back to this location for curbside again! Fail Carrabbas & shame on you for not even apologizing or attempting to make it right"}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant chain EVER!!!!  I love EVERYTHING there and the service has always been A+.  The fried zucchini strips (appetizer) are the best in the world, the Caesar salad is the best I ever had, even their croutons on the salad are better than any!!!  Olive oil herb dip is Fabulous, the warm bread is like no other.  Most of the dinners that I have tried have been excellent but the Chicken Bryan is magnificent.  Waiters and manager the best."}
{"text":"So so good we loved everything about this place service was excellent and food was outstanding definitely way better then Olive Garden for sure!"}
{"text":"If you are in the mood for some really good food I would highly recommend Carrabbas on Independance, the food is awesome as is the service. Our waiter today kept our drinks filled and made sure that we had everything we needed and every other member of the staff that I came near on my way out thanked me for coming and wished me a good evening... what a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"I first encountered this place with some friends and I have seen commercials for it. The atmosphere was very nice and laid back. We were seated quickly and the service was prompt and very friendly. I enjoyed the bread and oil however it wasn't anything outstanding. The food was hot and very good and I tried the chicken Bryan. Very tasty. The chocolate dream was just that a dream! I was stuffed from dinner and still managed to put away most of it. Great service. Good food and a nice casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"The wait on a Saturday night was about 20 min for a party of 5, not bad... The service was the main problem. The server rushed us. Then when I asked for a refill on chocolate milk for my daughter, she said we don't do refills on that. I would have paid for it, but she walked away before I had a chance to say it. The bread was stale, the olive oil to dip it in was terrible. When they came to put grated cheese on our food the guy spilled it all over the table and never cleaned it up or said anything. More on the table than the plate!  Then it was one of the girls birthday so we told he server. She said in a rude way, \"all we do is a mini cannoli.\" She walked away and then brought it over with barely a word. The pasta was too hard and it was very small portions.   All in all pretty unacceptable. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Wonderful service!!!!! Curb side service is amazing thank u always a pleasure. Good food always. Thank u"}
{"text":"My son and I stopped here for lunch today after a baseball tournament.  The smell was great, the atmosphere was great the food was too hot and rather bland.  It's possible the food was so hot that you couldn't taste it, either way the smell far outweighed the taste.  With that said, it was the best service.  We had Desiree and she was on top of everything.  She was quick, friendly and kind."}
{"text":"My review is quite lengthy, so please bare with me. Upon arrival to this location I explained to Elizabeth, the nice lady who seated us (who l later realize was head, I believe, in the kitchen), that we drove from San Diego, California to visit family, and that this Carrabbas is the closest location to us. I also explained we are a military family and move frequently, and that Carrabbas is my all time favorite restaurant and I was so ecstatic to visit. Beyond ecstatic. The last restaurant we visited was in Virginia and I never thought I would eat there any time soon.  Elizabeth, who was extremely kind and pleasant, offered her welcome, and her hopes that we enjoyed our experience. And that we did. We ordered three courses; my husband, myself, and our two young sons. The timing between each courses was perfect. Just enough time to enjoy and not feel rushed to eat the next thing that arrived at the table. Every meal was cooked to perfection and we could tell that a real effort was placed in its preparation. Even the temperature was perfection!   Giselle, the Assistant Manager, checked on us frequently, but not too much, and was very pleasant with a very beautiful smile and demeanor. We appreciated that. Though this is a chain restaurant, my entire family felt as it was a single family owned Italian restaurant that you must visit when you are nearby for a notable dining experience.   Elizabeth treated our family to appetizer and dessert; which was very lovely of her. I think having her made our dining experience most enjoyable from the start. I don't recall our server's name but she was fabulous as well. And I must say, I had a cappuccino for my dessert, and my husband an espresso, and typically after a big meal I'm exhausted and sleepy... but, it had just enough kick (but not too strong) to where I felt like a million bucks when I finished. :-) My kids raved over their meals and my husband left happily full.   I just wanted to express how great our experience was, and they deserve the recognition. Thank you very much. Whenever we return to Arizona we will be sure to visit!"}
{"text":"I am Italian.  Eating Italian food in a restaurant is usually a crap shoot.  However I must say This happens to be one of the better Italian places to eat.  We live in Surprise so we have gone there several times.  Did we ever have bad service, yes we did on one occasion but I certainly wouldn't rate the place on that one occasion.  It doesn't outweigh the dozen other times we had great service.  Did I ever have a bad meal there, yes on that also on one occasion .  Again you can't honestly rate a place on one bad meal.  I have had dozens of other really good meals.  I wish people would stop using Yelp as nothing more than a sounding board to vent their frustrations on one incident.  I personally would recommend this place.  Your chance of getting bad service or a bad meal are pretty darn slim.  If it happens two times in a row then go ahead and do your rating.  I give them a solid 4 stars.  I don't give out 5 stars on a regular basis either."}
{"text":"The setting was very nice and pleasant. The walls had an embossed Greek knot trim. The entry floor has glass pnels for a view into the wine celler. The decor was blue and white.  The food was all tasty, and the service was pleasant. The pastichio was the closest to yaya's that I've ever had in a restaurant."}
{"text":"Went here for a wine tasting / dinner pairing.  The wine and food were OK, but the service was pretty bad. They crammed the wine tasting / dinner pairing participants in a row of tables so close together the servers couldn't get to you. Heaven forbid you lift your arm to eat, you'd being giving the person next to you an elbow to the ribs. Seriously, shoulder to shoulder. Food and wine were what I expected. Not great, but not bad. Would have given more stars if they had thought the seating through."}
{"text":"For a chain restaurant this place gets my above average vote! I always get the shrimp scampi and I usually get a salad. I've even had the salmon and I'm always pleasantly surprised that's its good and that I still feel the food is worth it. The service has never been poor."}
{"text":"C'mon it is the best run of all of the franchised restaurants. I finally had some variation that was not the Pollo Rosemarie! It was so great and anybody that would spend the time on a bad review simply is a food snob or has an agenda. Bravo Caramba's!"}
{"text":"Carraba's service is always top notch. We have dinner here about once a month. Our favorite appetizer is probably the calamari. Fave soup is the sausage and lentil. Fave entree is the sirloin Bryan (chicken Bryan, but with sirloin. Not on the menu but all you have to do is ask!) Their olive oil is the nuttiest I've ever tasted, next only to a restaurant we found in Santa Barbara. Normally when we're out we try not to fill up on bread, but at Carraba's we don't even try! If we're not too full (which happens VERY rarely) we order dessert. They have some good ones, my favorite is the John Cole. It consists of vanilla ice cream with caramel sauce and roasted cinnamon rum pecans. Heavenly! One thing about Carrabba's is if you're not happy with a dish, send it back. They are all about making the customer happy so be adventurous."}
{"text":"Service at the bar was great, the wine was great, but the food wasn't that great! Your typical franchise Italian restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Nice place.. great food. Friendly service. . Love their zucchini fritters. Kid friendly. ."}
{"text":"Been here a bunch of times. Its very consistent and the Mussels are always good. Good wine selection and attentive staff. Mussels and Veal Marsala tonight!"}
{"text":"The food was okay. We ordered curbside to go and when we mentioned the 25 % off any pickup order to the worker she said it must have been fake if it was online and she never heard of it. We then called and spoke to a manager who said she would send a gift card for the difference. It has been 3 weeks and no.gift card yet. Felt like I was lied to."}
{"text":"My MAIN reason for giving this place 2 stars is because of our waitress. She was awful. Took 30 minutes to even get our drinks. Then another 30 to get our salads. She would leave for long periods of time without asking us if we needed anything. Another reason for my disappointment is, paying almost $20 for chicken marsala and getting canned mushrooms???? Are you kidding me!? YUK! Will not return..."}
{"text":"Whatever you do, don't order the mussels. They were literally the tiniest I've ever seen. They do give a lot of them, but they tasted terrible. Other than that, the food was pretty good. Service was great. Caesar salad average, but good, steak and prosciutto wrapped shrimp, pretty decent. The shrimp were really small and a bit overcooked, so was my (supposed to be med-rare steak) But I wasn't ordering high end, steakhouse prices, so with that in mind, 4 stars is fair. (Tiramisu isn't as good as CPK but pretty close)"}
{"text":"Arrived on a Friday at 6PM.  A few tables but not busy.  We ordered a bottle of wine Ecco Domani Merlot for $28 and knew we could buy this at any market for $10 to $12.  Overpriced.  My date ordered Lasagna ($14) and I ordered the Rigatoni Al Forno ($13). I got the side salad with Parmesan dressing and he the Minestrone.  Bread and olive oil dipping were very good.  The salad was okay but the Minestrone soup, while tasty, had a small bay leaf in it.   When we told our server about this, he said that the kitchen leaves them in and when you get one, it's a symbol of good fortune.  What ?????   This is a serious choking hazard and nothing should be in your soup that you can't eat !!!!  How absurd !!!!  The rigatoni was a \"huge\" bowl but the lasagna, although tasty, was very small and lukewarm at best.  The rigatoni was VERY hot as it was placed in the fire burning oven and was 3 times the size of the lasagna for less money.  We were then given the dessert menu and didn't see our server for 15 minutes.  While we finished our wine, we put our jackets on and the server came over.   Asked if he could bring us anything else and we said just the check.  If we had wanted dessert, it was too late so where did he go?  Don't know if we'll go back."}
{"text":"The food is good. But it's expensive. $48 bucks to take my mom out to lunch. Not really worth it.."}
{"text":"Update May 7, 2017.   First, let me preface these comments by stating I am not a compensated spokesperson.  Still, I can't say enough about the repeated satisfaction with every vist to this Carraba's.  I think what is truly exceptional here in addition to the superbly prepared selections and the welcoming service, must originate from the top.  The enthusiasm and responsiveness of the owner Mark exists at a level very seldom witnesssed in the food industry.  Mark is always willing to receive commentary and opinions on his establishment with the utmost interest and aplomb.  One often finds the opposite with other restaurants, with programmed responses to the extent of \"that's the way we do it, period.\"   You come to find yourself actually wanting to become a \"regular.\"   Creating this experience may be part of the corporate philosophy, but I also believe that Individuals such as Mark elevate it to a truly authentic and personal mission.  My dining experiences extend to a global level and include many memorable stops.  I can say, however, that it is a continued JOYFUL event to dine at Mark's Carrabba's grill.     Updated March 6, 2017.  Upgraded rating to 5.  Perfect experience from level of service to taste and value.  Server Amanda was a pro and had everything done right.  Get there early because after 5 the place fills up.  Wood fired grill makes the difference.   We've joined the frequent diner club and will be making this a regular event.     Sometimes there is a perception that a corporate restaurant chain cannot adequately produce ethnic food that is authentic and good. Readily, I can subscribe to that opinion but I am not extremely disappointed if a white haired grandmother is not stirring the pot or if there isn't actually anyone of that certain ethnic background actually cooking. The true measure is in how well you are satisfied with what is served. I am actually more apt to accept a corporate entity because, as a former military member, I appreciate standards of performance and situational analysis. This visit to Carrabba's, while not a perfect 5.0 this time, was very, very good. The bread is crusty and warm; served with a dipping oil. The salads, though most likely, formulaic and not \"endless\" as another chain, were well presented, composed and served on a chilled plate; a superior extra element. Our choice of appetizers included aranchini (fried rice balls) and stuffed mushrooms. Good for the price point of around $6 each. The main entrees were a chicken and pasta dish titled Linguine Positano. Whether it is actually a dish that originates from Italy's Amalfi coast, I am unsure. The chicken had good grilled taste, but the pasta was horribly overcooked (which for the American taste is too acceptable.) The seasoning of the dish also lacked. (think I might order the sauce on the side next time so I can give a better analysis) My Cioppino (Seafood stew), on the other hand, was superb. The fish including shrimp, mussels, swordfish, and scallops, was prepared to order and not overcooked in any way. The broth was well seasoned and tasty. The only minus might be that there should be a bit more served (I liked it!!!) Pricing for the food appeared in line with most comparable sites though wines and other drinks might be slightly higher. Our server, Brittany, was bright and well informed and knew the company and its products well. Service seemed fairly well timed though the house was crowded. Would have liked to have had the wine a bit sooner so it was there with the first course. The process was admininstered well enough with multiple servers delivering courses and managers nearby. Spoke with the owner Mark for several minutes as he had learned of our displeasure with the pasta. I am always pleased to see that kind of attentiveness to customer opinion. He was very receptive to our thoughts and gave a very comprehensive insight into the preparation of their cuisine. On my file it or forget it rating, I give it a \"file it\" and worthy of another visit."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a place where the service matches the food, look no further. This family style Americanized-Italian restaurant was beyond comparison. The staff is very friendly and if you have children, they will well entertained while stuffing their faces with amazing food. From the freshly baked bread to the main coarse, every bite was like a new adventure for my taste buds. They have a wide variety of food but I highly recommend the pasta dishes. Your mouth will thank you the moment you take your first bite."}
{"text":"Carrabba's is by far my favorite chain restaurant. This particular location especially. The staff  are very welcoming and warm. There is no denying the customer comes first here! The food is no exception. Their pork chop Marsala is a great dish, as well as the Chicken Bryan.  Every time my family and I visit, there is always available seating in the bar area. We always request Cara when we dine. She is very friendly, warm, funny, and knows the menu from top to bottom. She always remembers your name and order. She is a great server!"}
{"text":"Always love good food and cold beer, and we have both. Nothing fancy just real good food. 4 stars!"}
{"text":"Dined here about a week ago with my boyfriend. WOW, was the service great! Our sever Stephanie gave us the best service we have received in a long time. We ordered the small serving of calamari to start, and it was cooked to perfection! Tender and juicy, with a crispy golden breading. My boyfriend ordered the sirloin with asparagus; I had a bite of it. BEST steak I have ever had! It was cooked medium rare, and it absolutely MELTED in my mouth! The orange butter was a nice touch. I ordered the mezzaluna, and it seemed to be even better than I remembered! The bo got Italian orange soda, and I got Coke. Steph was quick with the refills and that made us very happy! We will definitely be coming back. :)"}
{"text":"I went here with friends for their birthday and I would not reccomend this restaurant at all.  Go home, boil some pasta,  add a bottle of Ragu and you will have a better meal.  The service was good, but the pasta was overcooked and the sauces were tasteless."}
{"text":"Been here a few times for lunch. Service is hit or miss and the food is typical chain Italian food and a little blah."}
{"text":"15 mins till closing time and the staff wasnt afraid of a last min stragler, like me. I ordered the mahi with parmesian sauce and a captain coke. Everything came out on time without any hiccups. The parmesian sauce complimented the mahi, which was cooked to perfection. Dont forget to add extra fresh parmesian on top. Thank you everyone."}
{"text":"Down the street from our house so we thought we would try it out.  The Customer Service in this place was OUTSTANDING. Our Waitor was on top of it, always checking on us, very friendly and over all very nice. Even the other waiter in the area (not ours) stopped a couple of times to remove plates and ask us how we where.   Food- Not so good. We will not be back- the food is over priced- the menu is rather small and the food really was not that good... at all.... Olive Garden has better food.... and thats not saying much. The pasta was bland, sauce tasted watered down and not that tasty. Their Desert was yummy though.   We will not be back because of the food- If we hear they change their menu- or chef we will come back. The service was really good."}
{"text":"My family and I have been going to carrabba's since 2000-the one in arrowhead, I have had the worst food here at north scottsdale the 4 times I have visited- I was particularly overwhelmingly disappointed when we had out of town guests and carried out,-the cozze-in-bianco was the worst ever, the sauce was over-sweetened butter-water the food quality was very poor.  My husband and I had gone there in the summer also, I ordered a meal that was cooked in some kind of paper-only to find a pile of rice with what looked and tasted like dried up \"veg-all\" in it.  We eat out a lot and I seriously don't recommend this carrabba's location as a dining choice.-they are not worth spending your money on.  Bad job consistently... Kim"}
{"text":"Service was descent but the crab cakes were burnt! This was my first time here and will most likely be the last. The waitress saw that my crab cake was completely black on the bottom. Obviously they put the lesser burnt side facing up hoping that I wouldn't notice. The rest of the food wasn't much better."}
{"text":"Just had the worst experience at a Carrabba's ever! We're visiting on a training being held at the Great Wolf Lodge. We decided to go out and eat. We were told the wait was 25-30 minutes long. We can see an older couple ahead of us. 20 minutes later a younger couple shows up, they greet the manager and somehow manage to sit ahead of everyone else...apparently someone who opted to eat at the bar 'gave' his table to this younger couple. I became upset and asked how it is that someone that just arrived was sitting ahead of the people ahead of me. Shouldn't they be seated first? We left. At which time the manager tried to follow us out, apologize, and give us some sort of coupon. Sorry. We're from out of town and will never consider eating here. Be warned. Common courtesy isn't very common at this establishment, especially when they have kids running the show."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible service which seems to be par for the course here lately.  I don't expect five star service at a restaurant like this, but I do expect the staff to do their job, not disappear, and not get flippant when asked questions.  We opted to do call ahead seating since it was a Friday evening, but when we arrived were told we got bumped to the bottom of the list and \"it is what it is\".  I wish I had asked for the manager because it just got worse after that.  But, it didn't seem that busy so I figured it wasn't that big of a deal.  Our server started out well, but about 15 minutes after we were seated he was a ghost who rarely stopped by to see if we needed anything (i.e. refills, dirty plates removed, etc.).  When he finally did stop by, he asked if we had saved room for dessert.  We replied that we did, and expected him to take the order.  Nope, he replied, \"Good\" and just walked away.  Seriously?  10 minutes later, after he decided to show back up, we finally put in our dessert order (chocolate dream and a cappuccino for my girlfriend).  The chocolate dream showed up almost immediately, but no cappuccino.  I realize it takes a little time to make one, but 10 minutes later there was still no sign of the cappuccino or our server.  When he finally did come by, we told him we didn't want it because we were finished with the dessert.  He snottily informed us that it takes time to make them.  Sure, but not 10 minutes.  A minute later, he dropped it on the table stating that it was on the house and he didn't want to waste it.  It took another 15-20 minutes to get our check despite asking for it twice.  If I didn't pay with the app, we would probably still be there.  We definitely will not be back, but if you decide to go and get Adam R as your server, you should ask for someone else."}
{"text":"We have been coming to this location since it opened and we have always enjoyed a nice family meal. I've actually moved to North Phoenix and we aren't exactly near to this location any longer. But, when I pick up my daughter from her Dad's this is our fave place to go. I chose the lentil and sausage soup and the house salad for dinner. I've noticed that their salads have been shrinking in size for some time now. Now, they come to the table half the size that they used to be, no pepperoncini's, and a very dry salad..... Tonight's meal however would be made extra special by the presence of a long, light colored hair in my bowl of soup. I'm a brunette so, it was not mine. The manager removed the item from my bill and offered a free dessert to make up for the \"hairy\" soup. Needless to say we will not be back to this location anytime soon if ever at all.  Epic fail Carrabbas's..... We never expected anything like this to happen at your restaurant."}
{"text":"We dined at the Mesa location/Superstition Springs a couple weekends ago and had \"Keith B\" as our server.  I rarely have the time to write reviews, but his service was outstanding and deserves praise.  We dine out all the time and he literally is one of the best servers I have ever encountered.  On the ball he was!  He definitely is a credit to their establishment and I suggest you ask for him when checking in.  Thanks to Keith, for the great dining experience!  We hope to see him again on future visits...  Oh, and the food was delicious as well!  Their steaks are awesome, in addition to their pastas.  The John Cole dessert was amazing too."}
{"text":"Received free gift cards from the manager of a Milford Ct location due to a poor experience ...dirty dishes and subpar food quality just to begin with when using the cards in another state I realized that there food wasn't to bad but the service was equally poor as it was in Ct not returning even for free"}
{"text":"Rude and disrespectful bartender on NYE of all dates. One star is more than generous."}
{"text":"We had my book club here.  A group of women descending on this one poor waiter would normally be a LOT to handle but, he was amazing.  He patiently explained what food and drinks were on Happy Hour as we bombarded him with our order.  Then more of our group arrived and he patiently went through the list again and took orders as well as additional orders for the original group.  I got the goat cheese and spinach flatbread and it was very nice.  Not too heavy on the topping and just a nice size.  Most others in my group got the \"scotty\" which was a generous portion of 5 slices of bread along with a marina sauce with thick goat cheese slices on top.  Everyone enjoyed their meal and the waiter did an impeccable job of checking back without being intrusive.  At the end, he gave all 7 of us separate checks and had everything separated perfectly.  If the delicious food and $5 drinks and happy hour appies weren't enough to win me over, the service made it a slam dunk.  I forgot to add that our waiter says to ask for \"Gabe the Babe\" and he will take care of you as well as he did us!  I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Restaurant was clean and a nice atmosphere. We began by ordering coffee's. We got hot brown water. My wife then opted to change to a latte. Brown water with milk this time. I ordered the Spagetti pomodoro with meatballs. I got an anchovie flavored bowl of wet red hard noodles in tomato snot and overcooked meatballs. My wife ordered the Fettuccine Carrabba. She got grilled chicken on a bed of oilly flat noodles. The very nicev wait staff offered to remake my diner with the marinara sauce but after bringing me a sample it was actually worse though not as runny. the staff was quite friendly and understanding. This is a menu issue. Your food sucks! Your tv commercial suggests fine Italian dining. I went home and made myself Hormel chilli over macaroni noodles and it was far better.  We will not be back to Carrabbas. Terrible, Terrible Terrible."}
{"text":"We decided on this place for sown thing quick to eat before we went out. Food was great. The Carnavale pizza and sausage and lentil soup were spot on. They have the classic bread with olive oil and spice.  Service was pretty good, atmosphere is okay for a chain restaurant. If you want a romantic ambiance might want to look elsewhere. Good food at a good price."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and large portion sizes makes this a good value since leftovers for those with a smaller appetite can be lunch the next day!  When they have the three course specials, it's like getting a free dessert or appetizer for even more value.  Of course everything we have ever had has been delicious!!"}
{"text":"All the food I have ever ordered at Carrabba's has been great! The soaps and pasta are perfect. I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Went here the other night with spouse.  We've been going there over 12 years.  The service is always great, the food is good.  The only issue is price versus portion size.  They greatly reduced it from previous visits.    For example, we quit ordering appetizers because we couldn't finish the dinner.  Following the same principle, when we visited we actually left and went to get a desert somewhere else because we gave them $65 and weren't going to give them anymore.  We both felt like we paid for dinner portions and received lunch portions.  This isn't a food quality issue or a staff issue, this is a management or owner issue.  California pizza kitchen tried this, and after two years of falling revenues they got the message.  We might try them again in a couple years.... :-("}
{"text":"I've eaten here before with varied experiences, but my girlfriend wanted to go out for New Year's Eve dinner so we went.  Prior to arriving she made a \"reservation\" / \"call ahead seating\" or whatever they call it at this place.  We arrived at 7:58 for our 8:00 \"seating\" and there were only two couples waiting.  This should have been my first clue as every other time I've been here the place has been crowded.  Even though there were only two couples waiting, we were told it would be 15 minutes (you could clearly see empty tables).  At 8:19 our pager went off to be seated (kind of funny they gave us this since we were ten feet from their stand and as stated earlier there were only a few couples waiting).  As we walked to our table, I noted seven empty tables and had only seen two parties leave.  I'm trying to account for why we waited so long when we had a \"reservation\" and there were empty tables. Oh well, let's just enjoy the meal.  My girlfriend ordered Chicken Alfredo and I the Conchiglie Formaggi.  They both arrived just warm (the restaurant was particularly cold last night) and our server didn't offer fresh grated parmesan. Both dishes were bland but were palatable, hence the \"Meh, I've experienced better\".  Truly the best part was the fact my belly was no longer growling and we could head out for a great New Year's Eve celebration."}
{"text":"Food wise, Carabbas is similar to many upscale casual italian dining affairs: a familiar menu, a good series of mid level moderately priced wines, and comfortable seating. What makes Carabbas special is the Staff and their customer service. The next time you go ask for Patrick, he's wonderfully knowledgeable and harbors the kind of sincerity that let's you know he actually likes and cares about people."}
{"text":"Kim made our first experience at carrabbas AMAZING, very nice server! Food was so good!"}
{"text":"Food has always been great and service pretty good here. Their pasta dishes are awesome (what I usually get, I'm not adventurous by any means) and they have huge portions, so cost isn't a huge deal because I usually get 2 meals out of one...it's called portion-control people! I've been here probably 5-6 times with my family over the last 3 years and have never had even a semi-questionable experience. Carrabba's over Olive Garden anyday."}
{"text":"Great food and great prices for Amore Monday 3 course meal. Waiter lacked personality."}
{"text":"My first time here. Lobster ravioli was rich and  delicious! My partner had the Chicken Bryan and son had spaghetti and meatballs. Servings were plentiful, and hot bread was available. Good stuff. We will be back."}
{"text":"I had never been here before and we decided to go for date night. The bread and dipping sauce was grad, along with the mussels. The soup was heavy on the pepper. My entrée, veal picatta, was delicious, though too heavy on the mash. Our dessert, Creme Brulee, was correct in flavor but underbaked and liquid on top still."}
{"text":"Our server James O was great.  The wife and I had a blast.  Great food, friendly staff, tasty Vino, who could ask for anything more.  Thanks guys.  See you soon."}
{"text":"Talk about a bummer. My last (and only) trip to this restaurant is one of those horrendous dining experiences you get once in a blue moon. My boyfriend and I went here for our year and a half anniversary. Not a big deal, but we're broke college kids and don't get to go out for fancy dinners often. At other restaurants within the chain, I've gotten clam linguine and it's my favorite thing ever. On this particular night, the only form of this linguine was in some two-plate special. This strange setup allowed you to receive two of the same entree with a salad or appetizer, or something like that. I think \"get one to go\" was the theory. However, I decided I didn't need all that and the price tag was pretty shocking. When our waiter came and asked for our food order, I asked if there was some way to just get one plate of the linguine. \"I'll see. I'm sure we can. What do you want if not?\" \"Um...I don't know. Maybe a caesar salad. Actually, maybe not. I'll have to think about it.\" With that our server left. I kept waiting for him to return with the status of my linguine. He briefly breezed by quick enough to refill our water and ask what the capitol of Maine was-which was weird (It's Augusta, by the way). And was off before I could even ask about our food. A few minutes later, he presented me with a salad. So I assumed they couldn't split the linguine order. Which I thought would be a fairly simple task... Even worse, the salad (which I didn't really want, anyway, I thought I made that clear) sucked. There's a couple of things I don't understand how you screw up. If you're an Italian restaurant and you can't make a caesar salad, a staple of Italian dining, something's wrong. Heck, even Zaxby's has a caesaer salad that tastes better and is almost half the price.  As a customer, it's obnoxious when you can't get what you want. I understand that companies have rules and procedures. However, I've also worked at a restaurant before and usually minor alterations to a meal aren't even an issue. Furthermore, when you don't give your server a definitive order on something, he just kind of brings something out, that is outrageous. Anyway, I'll stop ranting. I just think even the one star is generous."}
{"text":"always a rock solid dining experience at Carrabba's, and the staff at this location is the best, in my opinion. The lentil soup is as good as any I've had. One of our standby's, and one of the few chain restaurants we actually frequent."}
{"text":"I really like this restaurant but I had couple bad experience and I  always want to give another shot. This time was nice, our server looks like he didn't have a lot of experience but he was really polite and nice. Food taste always the same, it's little hard to decide which pasta choose because they're all base with Alfredo sauce..."}
{"text":"The food was great! The Service was awsome... I really enjoyed the blackberry sangria and the calmari is seasoned perfectly!! This was my 1st time here but I will be going back !!!"}
{"text":"Just wanted to take a minute to describe how positive my experience was at this Carrabbas. I dined here with my husband and was greeted politely and seated quickly. I was promptly served and checked on frequently. The manager made a personal visit to my table and asked specifically about the feature my husband was having for dinner. We left the restaurant with pleasant thoughts. Two days later I realized I misplaced my Louis Vuitton bag, a gift I got for Christmas. After searching for a day straight, I called Carrabbas as a last resort and of course it was there. It's great to go to place that is friendly, has great food, and has friendly honest employees."}
{"text":"Great family dinner with fantastic service. Had the Sirloin Masala. Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Oh no! Everyone has an off night, but this visit was extra special. Waitress argued with us over the food items and kind of threw down drinks and walked away. Very uncomfortable dining experience. Just not worth a return visit.  I hate being uncomfortable, especially when it's meant to be a nice relaxing evening out.  Follow up: in all fairness we spoke to the manager who was very understanding and supportive and took our concerns seriously."}
{"text":"We used to go to this restaurant all the time. I would say twice a month and it was delicious, eye appealing and kept us coming back for more. I would say it has been a couple years since we have been here, because we have been on a sushi kick, and unfortunately will not be going back.  I will say the service was good , polite servers etc. However, I ordered my favorite the Chicken Marsala  and could not wait to get it ! It arrived with the most droopy pale broccoli I have ever seen  and a very thick , dark gloppy Marsala sauce. I really didnt even want to eat it. We also ordered the Calamari , another favorite and it was tough and plain, not the same mouthwatering tender perfectly seasoned that we remembered.  Soooo.... not sure if was the cook , just having a bad night or what but its too pricey to take a second chance.   Im going back to sushi !"}
{"text":"The only reason that they get two stars is that my fiancé likes them. I have never ordered a single dish I have actually liked or filled me up. It is overpriced for quality and quantity. Don't get the chicken parm!...flattened piece of chicken that tasted like chemicals and there was NO pasta with it. Who does a chicken parm without pasta? I ordered it \"to go\" and didn't check to see what I was getting. My poor decision to their poor food quality."}
{"text":"I've always liked the pollo rosa maria there. I still do even tough they are getting skimpy on the prosciutto and fontina cheese stuffing. The lemon basil sauce that tops it off is still really goid tough.  A word of caution: never try any pasta dishes. They are a far cry from what they show on their website or commercials. Very little sauce and dry noodles; a waste of money. Last week we tried the champagne sauce pasta with shrimp and scallops and we did not like it at all."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best service I've ever had. Dion, the tremendous manager was courteous and outstanding during an event at this location. The food was perfectly cooked and drinks were always full. The five cheese ziti may be gone, but the pasta still ranks supreme in this wonderfully fun location."}
{"text":"My sister and I took my mom out for her birthday.   They changed their menu  not happy about the new menu.   We had asked our server to do something special for her birthday and never did.  The service was not great either."}
{"text":"Sneaky price changes detected here now. Giving less for the same price thinking customers won't notice.  Just raise the price CARRABBAS so your customers can decide if they want to pay more.  Don't insult your customers by using trickery"}
{"text":"Do not waste your time or money. Our service was slow. The food was awful. The bread basket had fried crust caked on the bottom. They couldn't make a cheese pizza for my 4 year old because the oven has been broken for 9 months(whaaaat???) My husband has been up all night sick from the chicken parmesean. I ordered a chicken and vegetable pasta and took two bites and couldn't do it. It was bland and the chicken looked questionable. I told the waitress who said that the manager tries to steer people away from that dish. Um OK thanks for the heads up. They did comp that. Ordered a brownie for dessert that was blah with chocolate sauce that was cold. With the pasta dish comped it was still too much money to spend for terrible quality food. Stay away!! You're better off going to a fast food joint honestly."}
{"text":"Did call ahead seating and was told that it would be an hour. What's the point of call ahead, the hostess tried but I would go elsewhere if you want to sit anywhere near the time you ask for. Epic fail on the part of this place. 0 stars"}
{"text":"Too dark inside and slow service. The food was mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Prompted by my desire to enjoy my new fave wine (Roscato winery-Italy) we made our annual visit to this Carrabbas.  -Greeting and seating was prompt.  -Server was friendly and took order immediately for drinks. (BUT, Please DO NOT bring 2 waters, if we specifically request only ONE glass, then say, I brought 2 anyway??)  -Wine Did NOT taste like my newly beloved ROSCATO brand wine!  It was a nice Red, but not the one we wanted.  -Portions VERY.VERY  SMALL! Even smaller than chains like Olive Garden! Smaller than our favorite Italian... Taglianis just 1 block to the west of this place!  -Sold Out of the Mahi (understood, it is Spring Training in AZ and we didn't arrive until 8:15PM, but this is not your first busy baseball season!)  -Caesar salad was substantial and tasty -Warm crusty bread, soft in the middle was fine. Dipping oil way too peppery! -Minestrone was very good as we remembered -Salmon not fully cooked, although very small slice, so took it home -Green Beans waay under cooked, so they were tough and stringy. -Shrimp and Scallops fine, but only 3 of each?? (now that is cheap!) -Garlic mashed potatoes were fine. -Dessert cake with fruit...just average, not exciting at all.  It will be a long time before we go back...maybe next year.  Maybe. This was disappointing for the $"}
{"text":"ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh Carrabba's.  my favorite neighborhood italian restaurant.  they really take care of me here.  service is TOP NOTCH.  my wine glass is NEVER empty....EVER.  I like that.  Food is always good.  Thanks Carraba's...keep it up.  I will keep coming back.  Love WINE WEDNESDAYS!  YES!"}
{"text":"So we decided to come here because Olive garden was packed the wait would have been 45mins sooooooo let's just say I wish we would've waited the 45mins my husband an I are very disappointed"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch around noon on a Saturday and it was super dead. Granted they had only been opened 30min tho. I ordered the seafood cannelloni and my fiancé ordered the pork chop Marsala. I got a Caesar salad with mine and he got the Sicilian soup. The Caesar was ok, kinda bland and heavy on the dressing but not terrible. The Sicilian soup was really tasty just a bit difficult to find some chicken. The seafood cannelloni was very tasty, although my personal preference would have been some crunch on top to mix up the soft texture, but otherwise very good. The pork chops we AMAZING! Seriously some of the best. Be leery about ordering an app because the food portions are huge. For both of us it was about $40, which I think is a fair price."}
{"text":"I brought my mom here because she'd been asking to come but our experience was subpar.    Our waiter was lousy and sloppily put together, he was sweaty and this is mid November.  He had grease around his fingernails like he works as a mechanic also.  He didn't come back to check on us and my drink stayed empty for quite some time.  The portion sizes are small for the price and there are only 3 salad dressings from which to choose - not the standard dressings I like.  The choices are Creamy Parmesan, Ceasar, and Italian.  My lasagna was burned on the bottom but hard and not very warm like something that had previously been made and then reheated.  He never offered us more bread and overall wasn't very pleasant.  I don't think I'll be returning here.  I'll stick to Intermezzo or Olive Garden."}
{"text":"Top notch food and service, great bang for your buck and there isn't one thing I wouldn't suggest."}
{"text":"Tonight was date night and I have never been to a Carrabba's so my boyfriend and I went to dinner at this location. We were served by Judy who was very warm and the service was amazing.  My boyfriend and I each had the Blackberry Sangria. It was soooo good!! Our meals were also amazing, but we were going to skip dessert since we were so full. With much persuasion by Judy, we ordered the chocolate brownie with mouse and whipped cream. It was also to die for.   A manager brought our dessert and asked us about the sangria. Since we were so enthusiastic about it, he brought us each a sample of their Peach Sangria. Also amazing!   As she left our tab, Judy advised that if we ever returned during the busy times and dropped her name, we would be seated at one of her best tables in half the time!    Then the manager who served our dessert stopped us to ask which Sangria we preferred. Of course we could not decide, it's like comparing apples to oranges!  Needles to say, the service we received was beyond expectation and we felt like celebrities!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner. Cody & John did a great job and went above & beyond what we expected. My dinner was not quite right. No big deal, things happen & when my 2nd attempted dish was not up to Carraba's normal standards, they both were joint effort to make sure my experience there ended on a positive note.  Thank you Cody & John!!! You two are awesome. Total Thumbs up!!!"}
{"text":"We ate at Carrabba's in Chandler last night. It was okay, but I have had better. The service left a lot to be desired. The server was pleasant enough, but neglected to advise me that they do not have green peppers to put on my pizza. The entire table heard me, so when my pizza came out it was covered with pepperocini. I sent it back, and they remade it, but the experience left a bad taste in my mouth (pun intended). One can get much better pizza and service at Nello's a few miles away, or Humble Pie. It will be a long time before I go to Carrabba's again."}
{"text":"It's alright. All chains are like that tho.  Typical food...atypical pricing.   Had the Seconds special...the plates were like for kids meals or something. You get what you pay I guess."}
{"text":"Ordered to go service was fast and friendly and food was hot and fresh my only complaint is I ordered a chicken Caesar salad as my meal and at the price of $16 I assumed it was meal size however that wasn't the case. It had about half a small chicken breast with approx 5 thin slices of chicken and the salad container was as big as my wife's side salad that came with her $12.99 meal . Food is good we enjoyed it but portion sizes have gotten smaller and prices are still the same"}
{"text":"I really don't know why I waited so long to try Carrabba's.  It's become one of my favorite spots now.  I just love the lobster ravioli, and the fresh bread is perfect.  They also make a delightful red-wine sangria.  The service is wonderful and the price is fair.  My family is from Italy, so I can be picky.  Carrabba's is definitely on my list!"}
{"text":"We had a wedding dinner party on July 26, 2015. There were 20 of us and we were all pleased with everything from our seating arrangements, our two special servers,the appetizers and each individual meal cooked for us.  Everyone called me the next day to tell me how much they enjoyed themselves. Thanks to you and your staff. Jan and Mark"}
{"text":"Health Sanitation Score of 98.5 on 11/2017 but restaurant smells and bathrooms nasty at Concord NC location. This was not a one time issue, been this way for a while, our last visit we left before being seated due to garbage smell all the way out to the hostess stations. Unfortunately, this location is the one closet to our home, but we will go to Huntersville until this facility is better. Bonefish, which is owned by the same chain and very close by is a world of difference. Hard to understand. Outback, Bonefish accept Carraba''s gift cards and discount cards."}
{"text":"Carrabba's for the win.  Good, solid Itallian food.  It doesn't remind me of home cooking because I never make Itallian at home, but it does remind me of other similar Italian concepts like Macaronni Grill, The OG,  The OG Spaghetti Factory, etc.  However, this place seems to do it a little better than the others.  Stay away from the house wine as I felt like a drunken wino after 2 glasses.  And not drunk in a happy way, but drunk in a I'm gonna take a nap under the overpass kinda way."}
{"text":"They have quick service and a good atmosphere the only bad thing is they do not offer ranch dressing for your salad.  I always order the chicken Parma and at this place it was the worst I have had it was dry no breading and it was over done. I would not recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"Michael R. Deserves a rave review. Great service, very attentive. The Chicken Bryan was suggested and I can see why. Scrumptious. We went on a busy Friday night. After hunting and hunting for a place to park we now know why. Even though they were packed the service was speedy. My wife and I were impressed. We will be stopping here again in the future."}
{"text":"This Carrabba's is just 'ok'. I went in with a friend a couple hours before they closed. It was the typical olive garden/italian chain decor with dim lighting. The host seated us promptly, and our server said hello right away. The service itself was great. She answered all of our questions, and made  a lot of suggestions. I ended up ordering the Chicken Bryan Ravioli, and my friend ordered the Seafood Cannelloni. It definitely smelled like seafood. With each meal a soup or salad was included, along with complimentary bread and olive oil with herbs. I probably should have ordered something else, but I had hiked camelback mountain and I was starving. The shredded chicken inside reminded me of what canned cat food looks like... It tasted ok, but didn't look that good. Portions were a bit small, and the sangria tasted like Juice. Nothing was wrong with the service, the manager even stopped by to ask how everything was. I would go back here, but I think I'll keep it more simple with what I order. Maybe just a chicken parm, or alfredo. If you want to try food that is a step above Olive Garden, go here. If you just want free stuff, and average service- go to Olive Garden or Brio's Tuscan Grille. I really did like our waitress and would go back just because of that."}
{"text":"Service was great here. Our server was friendly and helpful!  The food was ok. I ordered two items off of the small-plate menu because I can never finish my meal. I might try something different next time, just to get a feel for an entree."}
{"text":"I really do love this place, even though it's a chain and I don't eat pasta! On the most recent trip I had a delicious sirloin steak, which, ironically, was the most economical dinner on the menu. (My favorite--everybody's fav--of course is the Chicken Bryan.) The servers are always pleasant, and their martinis are great. Love the bartenders!"}
{"text":"Been wanting to try Carrabba's for a long time. Commercials really make it look good. We went last night.... won't go back.   We went to the one on Clearview in Mesa.  1) Food was REALLY good.   2) RELENTLESS, HIGH PRESSURE, DECEPTIVE, UPSELLING WAS EXHAUSTING............. EXHAUSTING........... from the start.  3) We asked the waiter to please back off the upsell - we find it offensive - we came for a relaxing evening, not an evening of high pressure to maximize the check. He agreed to \"back off\", but he was cold and distant after that, though he did give good, professional service.  4)  We talked with the manager about the over-the-top upselling and the deceptive pricing (which we got caught in - similar to the blue cheese scam in W.Y.s review below). He went on and on that the customer's satisfaction was his top priority, all the while spewing gushes of weasle-words trying to convince me that what I call \"relentless upselling\" is really their exceptional dedication to customer service, menu clarification and presenting options....  HUH? Apparently he thinks we're not just stupid, but REALLY stupid....  Won't be back."}
{"text":"I took my mother and my brother to this restaurant Carrabas on Charleston and Durango.   We sat at the table the waitress was in a bad mood she took our order three filet mignons and lasagne.  However, we ordered the steaks medium well and when served they were rare and tough.  It was not the quality of beef that we ordered.  They sell low quality beef for filet mignon and this is bad because this is cheating the customer.  We recommend to anybody that wants to go to this Carraba's not to go there!!! Because it is a rip off to the customer and the service is lousy."}
{"text":"Good... not great. Our server didn't seem to know what she was doing. Overall, not overly excited to go back."}
{"text":"Was forced to go here because the rest of my family didn't want to drive too far. Don't go here unless you are ok with mediocre Italian food. Hardly any choices on the menu and not sure if anyone really enjoyed their meal. Spaghetti with meat sauce was watery. I created my own chicken pasta with garlic and oil sauce. No flavor at all. I just don't ever want to go back there."}
{"text":"We are waiting for our reservations which were made three or four days ago for a party of 14 people we have been sitting here now for 20 minutes and after asking the hostess she said will get to you we're still setting up the table now this would be OK but as I walked away she gave me a nasty look shook her  head and pursed her lips like I had nerve to ask her where our reservation table was"}
{"text":"Wouldn't suggest this place my opinion Olive Garden is far better. Service was disappointing also."}
{"text":"Dinner for three was a good evening. The food was ok, I had the seafood linguine dish and it tasted great but I feel there was less than half the seafood than the same dish my wife had been served. I die for the sausage lentil soup and it tasted great but darn it for being 80% broth. I would like give the rating if 3 stars for the poor portion control coming out of the kitchen, but our waitress was great and the good ones are hard to come by. So thank you to the front line. Did I complain? No  would I go to th s location again, maybe but it may be a while."}
{"text":"Haven't been here for a while, but the commercials advertising new items - along with 20% off?  Had to give it a shot - even tho I've never been a fan of carabbas. We did call ahead, and the got us right in - even on a busy Saturday night. New options on the menu were great - but the stuff they put in that olive oil for dipping the bread in is downright awesome."}
{"text":"Usually Have a great experience but the last time was awful! The host was very rude and our server Jeffrey was slow and sarcastic (in a bad way) the food is always great, but over all dealing with the staff was not worth it!"}
{"text":"Went to Carrabba's for lunch on a Saturday abound 12:30.  Dining room was wide open and we were immediately seated.  Waitress was promptly at the table.  My wife asked her what she liked.  The answer was painfully long (at least to me) and most of her favorites were the more expensive items.  Her favorite on the special menu was definitely the most expensive at $23.50.  After leaving us to decide, she came back a couple of minutes later and we asked for just a minute more.  It took he about 10 minutes to return to get our order.  My wife asked for the special soup (tomato basis) and the waitress came back to tell us they were out of the special.  At 12:30.  In a mostly empty dining room.  One wonders just how much of the special they made.  I am used to places having a lunch menu as well as a dinner menu.  Not the case here.  I thought that $14.00 for a pretty pedestrian lasagna was over priced.  My wife had the Italian Cobb Salad which she liked and my son (aged 18) had the spaghetti which he also liked though the sauce on the meatballs was not what he was expecting.  All in all distinctly average with slow service."}
{"text":"This place set me in a corner with nobody around and all the other people was on the other side when I ask why the waiter told me to turn around rude sucka."}
{"text":"I recently ordered the Pollo Rosa Maria, which has been my all-time favorite chicken dish from Carrabba's for as long as I can remember.  I will never order it again until corporate reverses it's outrageously stupid decision to change the way it is made.  In terms of quantity and quality, it is no longer worth the flamingly ridiculous price I used to happily pay.  The only reason this review is getting more than one star is because the service was adequate."}
{"text":"Horrible new menu! They took away the Mozzetta sticks and the John Cole. We used to go once a week, not any more....."}
{"text":"Wow. Food poisoning! Thanks Crappas!  We went in last night for a simple dinner, and we are both regretting it. My date much more so than I am. She has yet to leave the bathroom 12 hours later.  But before the front and rear gastrointestinal fireworks show kicked into gear, let's discuss the meal.  We had the fried and breaded zucchini appetizer. Pretty much flavorless. I had the steak panini. Overly salted, lacking in real flavor, and somehow a mid rare steak was tough. She had the house salad and the artichoke/mushroom and marinara pasta. It was so salty that her lips were swelling on the ride home.  So, the food wasn't good. The redeeming point of this meal? It was cheap.   Service was overly aggressive. I don't need you to hover while I eat, it really takes away from the whole thing.   Then around 10:30, all hell broke loose in our bathrooms. Its the true upside of our old house that we have two toilets, otherwise someone would have been riding the sink like a toilet in Thailand!   She's been sick as a dog all night. We've taken today off to try to feel better. All night long she's been throwing up, which means no sleep before cyber Monday, the greatest American holiday of all time.   Sitting here talking about our joint sickness, we've now sworn off chain eateries for the rest of our lives. Just not worth it to feel like this to only pay $35 for a meal for two. I'll gladly pay more so as to not be doing the \"is it #1 or #2 dance\" on the sprint to the toilet.   ***December 6*** We were promised a call back from the day manager of this establishment after my girlfriend called and told of our joint food poisoning. GUESS WHO NEVER CALLED US BACK? Yup, the ass bag manager who at the end of the day is RESPONSIBLE FOR THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF EVERY DINER WHO EATS AT THIS SHIT HOLE! Good work there spark plug, you affirmed everything we said about your diner ala Escherichia coli!"}
{"text":"The chicken Bryan is soooo good. Lots of meat cooked to perfection. and the toppings were so tasty. Plus the soup on the side was amazing!        I was so happy with the food honestly.    The food gets 5stars.  My complaint is,    the waiting staff and hostess and seating are so unorganized and unprofessional.   We waited ten minutes. not long at all.  But all the staff was huddled together near the hostess planning on where everyone should seat.  It was kind of weird and I figured ok at Least they are all involved and care.   But then when we were called.  The guy that was leading us to our table .     just all a sudden vanished like a fart in the wind.  We were left standing there like morons next to people sitting and eating..   he came back and then said this way,  then once again he says leaves us and says \"hold on\". He runs back to the hostess table and computer.  Now I'm annoyed and a little pissed.      There was no organization at all.   Anyway they sat us at a table that was way too big for two. but whatevr. It was fine.    Then our waitress took forever to get our drinks ,   but the service did get significantly better as the night went on.    I think the staff needs to be more prepared. I felt like it was opening night or something.   Lot of nervous anxiety.     But my overall experience was pleasant.     I recommend. I think the hostess needs to take charge and know what she is doing and keep the waiters focused more on service."}
{"text":"Our last visit was amazing, had good food and good service. But tonight was awful. We tired to make reservations and were unable to. Then when we showed up, we were not so politely told that there would be a 40-45 minute wait.. After an hour and a half they finally called us to be seated. We were then seated in the bar area. We are both only 20 and we told them when they handed us the buzzer. We just got up and left. It was unprofessional and disorganized and the staff was not in the least bit welcoming. I will never go there again."}
{"text":"Love this place.The food  is amazing, the waiters are friendly and the atmosphere is great!"}
{"text":"As a Veteran I went tonight to take advantage of a free appitiser. I had the tomatos with mozarella soaked with too much Balsomic vinigar. Then I ordered thr Veal Marsala which included one side and soup or salad. I ordered the spinich and soup. When the entree came the spinich was so salty and saturated with garlic that you could not taste the spinich!! Then I tasted the Veal Marsala which was also saturated with salt. Obviously this is a chain restaurant where the line chef does not taste whats being sent out to the customers. The Veal Marsale was almost $30.00  so this is Lousy supervision from the manager NO EXCUSE!! NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"The food is always awesome but depending on the night, how busy they are and the server you get, service is a hit/miss."}
{"text":"Came for my bday ... enjoyed the family yesterday and now my parents treated me to Carrabba's; one of my favorite Italian places. Great service from Teela. Thanks girl."}
{"text":"I have always loved my Carrabba dining experience. But tonight was a different story. I wanted to try something a bit different and possibly less fattening so I decided on the grilled chicken.. with my normal sides ? I was very disappointed with the chicken. It was a flat piece of white meat that had no flavor even with whatever had been put on top of it to give it some as it grilled. I expected a nice big plump chicken breast not an apparently flattened in house or pre bought as this pounded piece of meat. I wasn't going to complain and never order that again until a manager (new) I had not seen before approaches the table and asked about our meal. He knew instantly from my expression I was not happy with my meal. He asked what he could do to make it better and offered a different meal. I accepted and ordered the spedino de mare (sp?). This was fine and delicious. I was given just the fish and not fresh hot sides. OK.. fine.. that was all good until I realized when I saw the bill that I was charged full price for a full meal at a higher price but not given a full hot meal replacement as I had to eat the cold sides left with me.... Grrrrr.... If I had been charged the higher meal price I should have been given another FULL hot meal. BTW, I did not take the flat piece of tasteless chicken home. I was disappointed this go around and I am not sure I will return any time soon after this experience. It appears and is my perception that this store has fallen in its quality. Definitely did not meet my customer expectations."}
{"text":"1/31/16  I had an horrible experience at Carrabas On Tiedeman Rd! We had a party of 12. We waited for 30 minutes for a table despite the table at the bar being available the entire time. After we were seated it took 30 minutes just to put in a order for drinks. It took an hour before we were even able to put in our order for our meal. It took 2 hours before we received our meal. We were not given refills for our drinks. We had appetizers that were ordered and never arrived. After waiting 2 hours for the food, one of the kids orders never arrived. He had to wait an additional 20 minutes for his food. We were not offered fresh Parmesan for our pasta, when I requested it. It took Jared 10 minutes to bring some to the table. The pasta was luke warm and the sauce had started to congeal. I'm not sure if this was due to the kitchen being slow or our waiters inattentiveness! I'm leaning towards the latter  The waiter Jared was a complete jerk for the entire meal! When he finally brought bread to the table after the appetizers were out, he slammed it on the table. We saw him on several occasions refuse to bring items to the table after being requested for assistance by AJ. He refused to bring over our checks. And was completely rude! There were two waiters assigned to the table but Jared lack of cooperation made the job even more difficult for AJ.   If you are having dinner with more than 2 people I do not recommend this location at all! And if you are seated in Jared's section, you should immediately request to move!"}
{"text":"We will not be eating there or recommending anyone to the Bell Road location. Upon entering the restaruant, we had a very foul odor that hit us; this should have been our first clue.   The service was horrible!! Being an ex server, I always tip well and see it from the server side. However, in this case...both the food and service were REALLY bad.  To make matters worse, the meal I ordered I could not eat...it was that bad. The manager would not take off our bill.  Basically, I was told...you did not know what you were ordering and it is not our mistake.  I am Italian and I know what Italian food...  If you are in the mood for Italian, I would not pick this location."}
{"text":"Service was ok but the manager is a different story. My boyfriend was allergic to the pasta sauce, no problem he received plain pasta dry without sauce instead. The bill comes and the manager thinks 11$ for plain pasta is right and refused to reduce the price."}
{"text":"For a \"chain\" restaurant, I love this place.  There is something for everyone and family friendly.  Have been visiting this place for years and have never had a bad meal.  Good chicken parm, ravioli, chicken trio, all their pastas are good.  Good house salad with parm dressing that I've had with a grilled chicken breast as an entree and yummy warm bread dipped in marinara sauce upon request.  Fried calamari is always a winner.  Go on Wednesdays where you get $10 off on pitchers of wine.  Get gift cards at Smith's for twice the Smith's bonus points.  Sign up for Amici Club and they will send you coupons for dollars off.  They are so accommodating which makes the carb factor double!!!  You cannot lose at Carrabba's.  Remember no drinking and driving.  We walk home.  :)"}
{"text":"I like this place. I feel like like its underrated. The food is delicious and I like the restaurant it feel quiet and peaceful."}
{"text":"My family and I visited the Matthews location last evening and was very displeased with the service and the food. Food was dry and over cooked explained that to the server and the management team and no one seemed to care. I got a to-go order for my wife at home and the order came out wrong. Also the server asked four different times how to split the bill after 15 mins of waiting I went to the manager and asked what the hold up was with no explanation. Then after they took my card it took a additional 15 mins to get my card back. We have never had such terrible experience at Carrabbas. We come there constantly for dinner family functions and special events. We travel from Monroe pass other establishments because normally the service food and atmosphere are top notch. Talking with servers and other employees it seems to happen a lot lately. I'm just concerned that if I return I will have a similar experience. Thank you for taking the time to read this email and I hope you have a great day."}
{"text":"I went with my boyfriend to this place. I thought it was nice but when we were waiting for the waitress to take our orders. We saw a cockroach walking on the wall near our table.  It was discounting. The manager came and change us to another table. But it was really disappoint that the managers did not gave us at least a discount or something. They took forever to bring our receipt and the good was not good as it was worth. I recommend people to not wait their money in here   Update:   Today, I went to Carrabba's and gave it a second tried. It was much better than my last experience. the service was good. He was very attentive and he make sure that our drinks stayed full. The food was much better than last time. I really enjoyed my time at Carrabba's thank you so much."}
{"text":"Okay so being in the business I usually don't like to yell I get time it's always wrong slow service our server was Donna she dumped a glass of water on my husband's lap came over with the towel and try to wipe his lap who does that second she leaves her serving tray sitting at our table for about 10 minutes totally disgusting an unacceptable in this business manager not once came over to the table to apologize definitely would not be going back"}
{"text":"Love the chicken bryan and ceasar salad! Servers are ok. They seem over worked on weekends."}
{"text":"We dine at this restaurant  once or twice a month. It is convenient for us and food has always been good. Recently we tried the Shrimp Scampi appetizer. This was fabulous. Next time I may order this as an entree.  The veal is also good. Service was attentive as well."}
{"text":"I always use the click through seating which works really well, even though it was not needed for this visit. Service was excellent- very attentive, with drink refills provided without request. The fish dishes were perfectly cooked. The mahi had a nice flavor with the sun dried tomatoes and a very light lemon sauce.  Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Never had s bad meal here Always very busy but always great service and great food My favorite Mediterranean stew  Delicious and fresh"}
{"text":"We came here after we left nearby Ventano (where we had sent the apps back and canceled our entrees). We were looking to eat at an independent restaurant in Vegas that had Italian food and a classy vibe. When Ventano let us down, we were just hungry, so we settled on Carrabba's. I have been to Carrabba's all around the country and often thought they were decent enough, but was never \"wowed.\"   It had been years since I had been to one tho, so we decided to give it a try. We had great service (which is always nice), and the food was surprisingly OUTSTANDING. I had the Tig pasta with tomatoes, asparagus, garlic, and bread crumbs. It was absolutely delicious. My husband had the Shrimp and Scallop Spiedino and was also pleasantly surprised. He loved it.   We will definitely not write them off as \"just another chain,\" and I see us going back there again the next time we are craving Italian."}
{"text":"Carrabba's is a chain, which makes me like it less, but my sister and I went here recently and it was a great experience.  We are both the grazing type who eat all day so when we go out we often split a meal.  We split the lemon chicken and each had caesar salad.  The chicken was fabulous, and it was just the right amount of food.  Our waiter was prompt and friendly.  I will come back here."}
{"text":"I've always seen Carrabba's but never really thought anything about it. Came here with family and was pleasantly surprised! Nice atmosphere and the restaurant was clean. Their menu is not gigantic nor is it too small. I think the selection is just right. I had the 6oz. steak with mashed potatoes and a side salad. Steak was cooked just right and the spicy butter topping you can add was so delicious!   Then there's our waiter, Reagan. Outstanding, outstanding, outstanding. Not a single negative the entire night. Attentive, funny, and so respectful. His service is the reason why I'll keep this restaurant on my list of places to go. Way to go for hiring a fantastic individual. If I could give more than five stars, I would."}
{"text":"If you want to spend $80 on an average Italian meal served by a condescending teenager who is certain to get your order wrong, this is the place."}
{"text":"We had a great time! The food was delicious and our server was amazing. Yesenia always seemed to know when we needed something and brought it to us before we had to ask. She did a great job, thank you!"}
{"text":"My first time at Carrabba's Italian Grill, not my last! I started with a refreshing Blackberry Sangria, my wife had Peach Sangria, and Shrimp Scampi appetizer. The Fettuccini Weesie was my main entree, yum. Others in our group had the Rib Eye steak, Linguine Positano, and Prosciutto Wrapped Shrimp. All enjoyed their selections with full bellies and had to get to go containers for late night snacks.  We had very short wait for a table for four, and the service was good."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I just came out of Carrabba's completely satisfied. We had never eaten there before so we didn't know what to expect. Our server, Rachel L., was not only nice, she was also very knowledgeable. She knew what ingredients were used in every dish we asked, gave great suggestions, always filled our water, and was overall very personable. You can eat food anywhere but if you go out, it's great to be treated well; it really makes the difference between the start of a good date night or bad date night. Thank you Rachel!"}
{"text":"Bread and mussel ... good to go!  Best marsala (chicken or veal)"}
{"text":"I visit the one on eastern and st. rose. I love the cavatappi ..yumm.. The sirloin marsala is the best. The Johnny is good as well. Love the fresh herbs and oil and fresh baked bread."}
{"text":"Favorite restaurant in Vegas, hands down! We eat there all the time. The salmon is always cooked perfectly. The Mediterranean Salad (lunch menu) is the best salmon salad in town. The owner, Lindsay, actually cares about training her staff properly to provide a level of great customer service that is really rare among most restaurants in town. Her manager, JT went the extra mile last night, no questions asked.  Our server was new. It was obvious. He was very nice but he screwed up one entree on our order. They took it back and proceeded to make it right. However, when it came out, it still wasn't right (6 oz. steak instead of 9 oz.) Not a big deal but wrong. JT came to the rescue. Not only did he comp my meal, he prepared a second one that had the right size steak, comped that one too, and also comped my wife's dinner, which had no problems. They value their customers and it shows. We have eaten there hundreds of times. We have had big parties there. I can count the not up to par issues on one hand. Every time, they make it right (or better than right). While I sympathize with the negative reviewers, I think their problems are isolated incidents. No one is perfect. The key is to take care of the guests when little problems arise. Had these reviewers brought it to the attention of management, their issues would have been resolved.  We ALWAYS get spectacular customer care, and the food is ALWAYS at least a 98% - usually 100%. ALWAYS fresh, not frozen, not processed. Read all the reviews - the good ones are consistent and not fake - the bad ones seem like haters... Sooooo much better than Olive Garden!"}
{"text":"I'm no stranger to good Italian food, and I wasn't expecting anything special but I was knocked out by the quality of Carrabba's food. The tomato basil soup was absolutely fresh, with complex flavors, texture, and spice, along with lovely wilted basil leaves to top it off. I thought this would be chain restaurant stuff, and it's really quite a few steps higher quality than its price point. I loved the olive oil dip and bread (which I tried not to overeat), and my husband and I shared each other's entree. I'll be back!  Highly recommended. Attentive service too."}
{"text":"Just left there from lunch. My son got married today and they wanted a small wedding and reception. They looked around with my wife and found Carrabba's.   This location has a nice room off to the side that was great for the group of twenty. The manager Josh was awesome and his staff were excellent! It was perfect and fit my son and his new wife to a tee.  Yes the food was awesome and they took care of every detail. Food was timed right for service and they were checking on us regularly.   I know I am leaving something out, but bottom line,  1) great service 2) great staff 3) great food 4) great time.   Felt like I was at home there. Recommend this location for events or dinner.  (We like that too)  Thank you!"}
{"text":"This place is great. My server was friendly, funny, and just made us feel very welcome. The manager stopped by and it was obvious that he really cared. Great place for a date night."}
{"text":"Great Atmosphere.  The Host Aaron is very attentive and polite. Immediately got us our drinks right when we sat down.  Nice to see hard workers taking pride in their job!"}
{"text":"We ate in this place and was treated poorly after waiting for over an hour. This is a very disorganized place. Pls beware. Don't waste your time. The food is so so and manager of this place has a monster like attitude towards customers, very defensive, and not apologetic for their shortcomings. This place needs to be on the watch list of Better Business Bureau. :("}
{"text":"First time here & everything  was so delicious!! I've never posted a review before but right when I took a bit of the shrimp scampi I was ready to write a five star review. The lunch combos are very reasonably priced and absolutely delicious. I did the lunch trio and got soup, salad and a small plate. I enjoyed every bite of all three. Definitely coming back & will recommend to friends and family."}
{"text":"It's been quite some time since I have been to a Carrabba's and was excited to revisit when my daughter suggested it.  My favorite dish was always the Mezzaluna, and was pleased to see that it was still on the menu.  Well, it wasn't what I was used to! The ravioli were flat (not a lot of stuffing) and the sauce needed serious help.  I ended up putting balsamic vinegar on the dish, just to make it palatable.  My daughter's Fettucine Carrabba was tasty, though - good sauce on the noodles.  They should also warn people that their Caesar salad dressing contains anchovies - not everyone likes that sort of thing. We ordered drinks - the first two drinks that we requested were rejected because they didn't have the makings for them.  So, I thought that I would treat my 21 yo daughter to a B-52.  We were charged $8 for a drink that was incorrectly made and VERY little alcohol.  I mentioned to our waiter that the bartender needed to go back to bartending school.  Our waiter was meh as well.  I was disappointed that a restaurant that used to be a go-to (when we lived in the city a decade ago) no longer holds that status."}
{"text":"Just have a great dinner and even better service today! Food was quick and delicious! We had Karen as our server, she was on top of everything and really sweet!"}
{"text":"For a chain restaurant.. This particular location is amazing! Both food and service. I always order the mussels as an appetizer and it's delicious and last night was the best we had! Yummo!! Also had their Sicilian soup, spaghetti, Alfredo's, and pork chop entrees. I love the pastas because it tastes like it's made fresh. Very light. Not like Olive Garden or Oreganos. Carrabas is a top pick for Italian family dinner nights. This place would be an awesome 5 stars if their house wines are on point but I'm also a wine snob so..."}
{"text":"I have been to Carrabba's several times and I really enjoy their food.  I have had their chicken parmesan, shrimp dishes, attended there happy hours, etc.  I often send gift cards to my sister in S. Carolina, as she loves them too.  Their prices are reasonable and have never had a bad experience.  Food and Staff are great!  I will eat there again."}
{"text":"Went for dinner to this place and was very hungry too. Ordered Wine, and bread first which came out fast and hot. Service was good too, we tried out lasagna, salad and Oven chicken Parmesan and all were good no complaints.   Service: 5 stars Ambiance: 4 Stars Food: 4 Stars  You will enjoy the food and drinks here and prices are reasonable too. As i have not tried out all that the menu has to offer i cant say for other food. But worth trying once.  \"Try and decide for yourself\""}
{"text":"Went there for a drink and to try stuffed meatball.Seated at bar got drinks and cold bread.Bartender white guy with beard never said a word and was very unfriendly,asked about stuffed meatball pushed a menu at me and pointed.Allways had great service and food,we paid for drinks and left no tip.He acted like he did not want to be there.NOT my problem.We will be back though."}
{"text":"Food is tasty. I like how they give a piece of pizza dough to kids to play with until their food arrives. This place always seems as if it's packed or it takes forever to get a table. I wish they had more booths compared to tables but not a deal breaker."}
{"text":"I only rate places five stars if I have been there a few times and consistantly have had great food for a good price.  Carrabba's fits this profile.  There is a trio sampler that is a great way to try three different dishes.  Talk to your server about specials not listed on the menu! Also, the best time is to be had by sitting at the counter and watching the cooks as they whirl around the grill and prep area.  If you're nice and chat it up with a couple of them, you may be rewarded with sampler dishes... tell them how you would like to sample the lobster ravioli  :) This is one of the newer Carrabba's so the proprietor is making special effort for his customers to enjoy themselves.  When I am in PHX, this is my favorite place to go."}
{"text":"The service was great. No complaints at all. Food was delivered in a timely fashion, but the menu is extremely limited. 2 of the listed items are being permanently removed so they weren't available.   I ordered the tag pic pac, which is one of their signature pastas. The chicken was horrible. The sauce was okay, but it was a boring dish for the money.   We won't be back."}
{"text":"For a chain, Carrabba's is one of the best.  We eat here about once a month and it is always good.  They usually have great servers and hosts as well.  They bring out some really good bread with herbs and olive oil to start that is always hot and fresh.  I always order the italian salad with house dressing- trust me, you won't be disappointed.  My husband usually gets the caesar salad and then wishes he got my salad.  I have tried a lot of the entrees and have found that the fish is great- the salmon/trout nocciola/trout wulfe are all wonderful.  My husband always gets filet marsala and it is one of the best steaks we have had (better than Ruth's Chris in my opinion).  If you have room for dessert- an we always save room for it here- the Chocolate Dream is  our go-to.  Sometimes the seasonal dessert is good- berry crostata.  All in all this place does not disappoint!"}
{"text":"So, today was my first time visiting Carabba's. It was a Sunday night, not very many people at all, it was only my party and 2 other small parties, we were seated and our waitress took forever to come, once she came we placed our order (the waitress was a doll by the way, she was amazing) we got our salads and bread fast, however our food delayed, 30+ minutes later I ask one of the girls on the floor where our food was since there were only 2 other tables there and she said she would check, (mind you I am paying attention to the cooks not cooking anything because they have this open kitchen) I watched as I went back to my seat, the girl spoke with the kitchen workers and gave them our ticket, so the whole time our food was not being made, and she didn't bother to notify us that our tickets were forgotten and that they were barely going to start the food so we would have to wait all the time it takes to cook to prepare our food for us, we decided to leave because of the lack of communication and the fact that the place was literally empty, if you are busy I can understand, but there should never be that much of a wait when you only have 7 customers in total.  What is really unfortunate is that the food is suuper delicious (our waitress gave me a sample of all of the soup) they brought our salads to begin the meal and it was the best tasting salad I've ever had, and it was only a side salad. The dressing was amazing and it just hit the spot, however, I do refuse to pay for food especially at the high price (17+ per plate) when I get horrible service.  Definitely not returning to this location"}
{"text":"I've been to this location about three or four times and have received service ranging from okay to excellent.  The manager (and head chef) has dropped by nearly every time I've been there to see how things are and the host staff has always been polite.  Today we had a booth in the bar area, although we had sodas with our meal.  We shared an appetizer, some spinach fondutu (sp?) thing that was a little runny and slightly oversalted, though still tasty.  It came out with some buttered Italian toast pieces, but there weren't enough of them to eat the fondutu because it was so soupy, so we ended up sopping up some of it with the complimentary bread they always provide.  I ordered parmesan-crusted arugula chicken with a side of some pasta I couldn't pronounce (it was the best meal I've ever had there--I wish it weren't a seasonal special!); my boyfriend ordered steak marsala (he said it was good, but not amazing).  Both of our meals came with salads.  I had a birthday coupon which took my $17 meal off of the tab and our total was about $37 after that had been removed.  What really impressed me this time around was the service.  Before we went, I tried to print out my birthday coupon but had technical issues.  I called the restaurant and they said I could forward the email and they'd print it out there for me, which I thought was really nice of them.  When we got there I let them know that I had sent the email, but the manager told me that they hadn't received it.  He proceeded to tell me that he would take care of comping the meal anyway, and didn't make it a hassle in any way.  Our waitress (Victoria--she's an awesome server!) also brought me out a little sundae thing that was prettily done in a shot glass.  All in all, today was the best experience I've ever had at Carraba's, which is why I decided to write them up here when I got home.  There are two reasons I gave them four stars instead of five.  First is that in the evening the place gets really loud, particularly the bar area.  I don't know whether it's due to poor acoustics or if people just get loud when they eat Italian food, but I've left there with a headache a couple times.  The second reason is that the service isn't always as phenomenal as it was today.  We went in for a super-early dinner (at about 4 pm), and I think it was slow enough that we got some extra attention; when we usually go later in the evening (around 7 or 8 pm) the servers are a little more harried and less helpful."}
{"text":"Our favorite waitress is back! As is the old manager (John, I think?). They must have had an off night with a new manager subbing and it went dreadfully wrong. We decided to try it again after they introduced a reward program and were pleasantly surprised.   I had one great meal (same items as last time), went back a couple of weeks later and tried something different (the Italian Classics). Delicious! However, I tried it again the following week and was disappointed. The chicken parmesan was burned. Like dark brown, bubbled cheese and the lasagna was unruly and tasted like it had cream cheese in it or something this time? It just kind of stayed on your tongue too long after taking a bite and was strangely creamy. Weird.   So I'll just stick with the calamari, sausage lentil soup and sirloin marsala.   I guess I update my review to say when they are on their game, everything is fantastic, but they can really have off nights occasionally. I guess like many places."}
{"text":"I go to Carrabbas frequently and this time happened to be the worst service experience I've had at a restaurant in recent memory. Server disappeared, manager was rude and the entire experience sucked!"}
{"text":"My whole family went to dinner here this past Saturday night.  My mother-in-law is so in love with this place...not really sure why.  The bread and olive oil with herbs is probably the best part of the meal.  I ordered the chicken parm with fettucine alfredo and a side ceasar salad.  The salad would have been really great except it was three bites big...or should I say small?  My chicken was pretty good, and hot when it arrived but the pasta was ice cold like it had been sitting on the plate waiting for the chicken to finish cooking.  Nobody else had a complaint about their dishes but no rave reviews either.    Our server seemed less than interested in being at work that night...she did perk up when I mentioned ordering a cocktail.  Don't know if that was because she'd rather be drinking than working or that I was about to bulk up the bill with an alchohol purchase and thereby increase her tip.  The chocolate martini was amazing.  That bears repeating...the chocolate martini was AMAZING!!!  I would think after appetizers, bread, salad, a main course and two alcoholic beverages I'd be stuffed...nope.  We ordered dessert.  It saved the day in my mind.  The buttercream cake with pineapple, banana, strawberry and creme layers...OH MY GOD!!!!  Skip the food and go straight for dessert here!  So light and fresh tasting.  Not overwhelmingly rich like so many deserts.    For the money...I'd rather have gone to Olive Garden or Macaroni Grill...but if you want a chocolate martini and dessert, this was great!"}
{"text":"It was a busy the night we came.  Had to wait about 20 mins to be seated for a table for two.  But there is a full bar with TV's to pass the time.  Was seated in a odd location.  Our table was in a group of tables located around the perimeter of the \"bar\" area.  Server was attentive and pleasant.  Food was excellent and came out in a timely manner.  However my GF ordered a side of asparagus and after our appetizer and salads came out they brought her side of asparagus before the meal.  Not wanting it to get cold we ate it before our main courses came.  Our waitress came with our meals and also noticed the asparagus came out too early.  The waitress decided to bring us another side of asparagus to have with our meals at no extra charge.  Great food, good service.  I would eat here again.  Parking can be a bit of a problem.  Had to park in front of the Bank of America next door."}
{"text":"My mom and I go to this location at times. We love it. Minus the minor hiccup with the sides getting messed up, I can't say anything negative. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"April 24, 2015.   Matthew was our waiter.  Service was excellent this evening.  He was very patient and gracious as our full party came in at staggered times. I feel bad that he has to serve the food as at looked this evening.    Presentation of chicken Marsala really sketchy. Looked like it was picked up from Sizzlers.  Two small ice cream scoops of mashed potatoes with a wafer thin piece of chicken. 50% of the plate empty.  Caesar salad was dry, served with no dressing, flat on the plate, no croutons, no cheese.    Waiter was great.  Quality control careless.  This restaurant could learn presentation from street vendors in Bangkok and they serve stir fried insects and bats!   Appearance of food careless.  I know it is a chain but our prior experiences have never been so poor."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I eat here often! One of our favorite Italian chain restaurants. He usually gets the pasta carraba and I really enjoy the spaghetti and meatballs. Also, the house salad is fantastic!"}
{"text":"I've been here a bunch of times and have never been disappointed. This is a step up from the Olive Garden and is well worth the trip. I've had the pecan-crusted trout there, which is excellent. The chicken fetuccini alfredo is definitely above average. Pork chops are well seasoned and quality.  Good italian that's not too pricey, you really can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Fabulous, fabulous, fabulous!  From the clean facility, to the friendly staff to the amazingly delicious food . . . Carrabba's rocks!  IF you want to be wined and dined . . . this is the place.  What a blessing to have them in the east valley.  Blessings to them as they provide quality service at a moderate price  :  ) KC"}
{"text":"Excellent. Bread was unremarkable.  Not tasty or crusty at all.  The seasonings served with the oil was not well balanced.  I ordered the campfire delight and it knocked my socks off...it more than made up for the bread.  Salad and Italian vinaigrette was beautiful.  The tomatoes tasted home grown.  I enjoyed the Pasta Carrabba, it was Tasty, and enjoyed, however, I have has much better at home.  The Tiramisú was one of the best I have ever had...I have to tell you our waiter deserved 10 stars!   For a chain Resturant, the meal was surprisingly good...not authentic as you would find at home...I was impressed with their offer to alter any menu item....never had this offer at a chain  before.  They are a bit pricy...I would return in a heartbeat for the campfire delight, salad and  Tiramisú."}
{"text":"We went to Carrabas for our 39th wedding anniversary.  We have gone to this restaurant for years.  My daughter made a reservation online and one of the questions was, is this a special occasion.  She put in that it was our anniversary.  We got there and our server was so unfriendly that it made our dinner uncomfortable.  Her name was Nicole and she was so bothered by us that I just wanted to leave.  When dinner was over she asked if we wanted dessert.  I kind of thought that we might get a cupcake with a candle since it was our anniversary and we had chosen Carrabas as our special place, but no.    My husband said he didn't enjoy our anniversary dinner at all because it was such an unpleasant experience dinner with Nicole.  What a shame!  We can't get it back!"}
{"text":"We usually go because it's a comfortable option when the kids want spaghetti.  The food is okay -- nothing special -- but the service is always great."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service! Did \"to go\" ordering and when we came home our order was wrong. Not only did they correct the order they brought it all the way out to our house which I am sure is out of their delivery zone. They went above and beyond!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and it's fun sitting at the pasta bar area.  Managers, Wait staff and line cooks were awesome!  Definitely will be back.  Happy new year!"}
{"text":"Good service,  good food :)  Drinks were refilled without asking and service was prompt but not intrusive. Food was good but not quite excellent.   Would still visit again."}
{"text":"As always this Carraba's always aim's to please and this last trip was no different. Great food, great atmosphere, and great Service. A winning combination. Now if they would just get \"Red Oak\" on tap. That might change my mind to 5 stars."}
{"text":"We have been there twice since moving to Surprise. They have very good food. Would recommend highly."}
{"text":"No where near NYC's Little Italy but consistently very good fare for a chain establishment. Great service better than anything in Flagstaff."}
{"text":"Read alot of bad reviews on this place... Got to admit the 1st time I went it was NOT my fave.   However i decided to give it a second chance so a few days ago when a friend wanted to take me to dinner - we picked Carrabbas .  We were seated quickly -nice  The waiter was quick and cool. double nice. Then we ordered ... 1st a lovely Pinot Grigio which was both light and sweet to the taste.  We ordered the Caprese Skewers. Which came served with pesto, I was a little nervous but dug in. Was delighted that it was delish. I think I could have sat and ate tomatoes and cheese and pasta all night.  However my salad with house dressing came next. The dressing was light and not over powering.  Also could have made a lovely dinner out of just salad. Yet here came the chicken parmesan.  He got Ravioli with potato chicken and spinach in it. yum yum yum yum yummy!!!! Everything was VERY good.  If you don't want chain food... go where is best for you.  I preferred this to Olive Garden or Macaroni Grill.  But that is just me."}
{"text":"Monday at 9:30 pm is when I walked in with my date.  They close at 10:00pm this night.  Two (2) of Carrabba's employees sees us waiting at the host stand, just stares at us for a monument and walks away as if they contemplated whether to greet us or not.  My date and I wait a little longer while few more employees walk around us without any acknowledgement.  So we decided to seat ourselves.  Another customer that was leaving aided us with the menu.   After sitting, the first employee that recognized us at the host stand ends up being our server/waitress, but that wasn't until much later.     This is what I witnessed while i waited for service.  There was an employee moving tables around and vacuuming the floors around the table my date and I were sitting in.  This may be a little extreme, but why not really disgust guest by picking noses and farting next to dining guests?  The others were focused on the side work as well in preparation to close and leave.  Yet during cleaning up the restaurant floor, they small spec of crumbs were vacuumed but the food on the floor a few tables down from us was left alone.  I still don't understand their priorities.   The restaurant was fairly empty the this time with me being the 4th or 5th table to dine.    I give this place one (1) star only because I cannot go any lower.  I never expected to enter a dining establishment where the employees showed such disappointment because dining guests shows up 30 minutes before closing time.  The term \"going above and beyond\" is not what this particular Carrabba's is taught, so I can only assume.  That assumption come from speaking with the manager for that night.  I was I got her name, but failed to do so because I just wanted to leave after her condescending responses.  She actually said \"well I can't be out here all the time\" as an excuse when I explained to her the chain of events they led me to just leave.  Yes, just leave.  Not only was the server rude, she sounded annoyed that she had to explain the menu.     Going back to the manager, I have a strong conviction that managers are to manage.  The manager for that shift is to blame for either the lack of proper training or the lack of care the employees show to their guests.    So we leave and go to Apple Bees across the street.  The bartender there greeted us as we walked in.  The server sat us strategically so they could continue their side work without interfering with my dinging experience whereas Carrabba's just didn't care.     All Carrabba's cannot be this bad.  I'm hoping this does not happen often, not because I care where this business goes but because it would bother me to know this happens regularly to other unsuspecting guests.   I'm sure if I decided to stay and dine at Carrabba's and leave a low or no gratuity, I can only assume they would have cursed me under their breath for being a bad tipper and not being accountable for horrible service."}
{"text":"My partner and I have dined at Carrabba's on Eastern several times in the past and have always had a pretty decent experience until last night (1-25-28).     The service was sub-par from beginning to end.  The first thing the food server told us when she came to our table was there were several other customers seated in her area at the same time.  Consequently, I don't fault the server for the poor service (very slow & order came out wrong), but rather management.   I ordered the salmon, but specifically requested  that none of the seasoning sauce be used.  I asked that no seasoning be used except for some fresh garlic.   When my salmon came to the table it had the seasoning sauce on top.  When I told the server my order was wrong, It was promptly taken back with the assurance that the mishap would be corrected.    To my surprise, the server came back in lightening speed with my salmon minus the sauce on top.  However, it was quite obvious that the cook simply scraped the sauce off, threw it on the grill for a few minutes, and tried to present it as a whole new order!     When I noticed the newly delivered salmon was the same salmon as previously brought to my table, I declined the food.  Both the server and manager offered to re-do my order again, but by this time my partner was already halfway done his meal, and would have been completely finished when my new order came out... Isn't most of the enjoyment of dining out with someone special, eating together?     Despite the slow service, incorrectly prepared order, and the unprofessional attempt by the cook to disguise my old salmon for a completely new piece of fish, I still would have given this restaurant two or three stars, based on my previous visits.    However, when I received the check, I was shocked to see that the only item that was subtracted from the bill was \"my\" food order.  I was charged for everything else, INCLUDING my iced tea!  As a result, I had the displeasure of paying $50 for the opportunity to drink some iced tea, nibble on some bread, eat a small bowl of soup, watch my partner eat his entire meal, and then leave the restaurant HUNGRY.  Taken in its entirety, I think my overall experience warrants a one star rating."}
{"text":"Miriam is absolutely amazing! Her knowledge blew us away. She knew the menu so well and really catered to our needs. The food was excellent. I highly recommend the Marsala Sirloin with the pasta dish that I can't pronounce or spell. Ü Great food. Great service!"}
{"text":"There's one thing that Carraba's does well...their Caesar salad.  Whether you get it plain, with chicken or salmon, it never disappoints.  It's the best in the valley.  I've been ordering it for years even my very picky husband agrees."}
{"text":"The best italian chain restaurant. Service as always was spot on. The food was excellent as always, and served in a timely manor. I normally order the chicken Parmesan with a side of fettuccini  Alfredo but this time opted for shrimp and scallops in a butter sauce. Both were cooked perfectly and the sauce was amazing. The minestrone soup was delicious as always and the fried calamari was out of this world. Their entire menu is a home run."}
{"text":"We went to Carrabba's in Glendale, AZ. recently, and the guys working in the kitchen were bashing dishes together the whole time we were there! Then they were pretending they were playing instruments with them! The managers were right there, and never ever said a word to them. I don't think anyone would like to have broken glass pieces, or glass chips in their food!  Not only annoying, but very dangerous! The time before that we had a waiter, named Mike, we had him a few times, he is The Worst waiter ever! We took family there and we were asking about an item on the menu, and he yelled so loud, Hold on Hold on, just be quiet, I'm trying to think here! I mean really?? Then he was serving our food, and he took the plates and slid them down the table! He bashed them into other dishes that were still on the table! The food on one plate actually was half off the plate after he crashed them into the other plates! Yeah crazy! We will not be going there again, we will pass on risking having chip glass in our food, and lousy waiters!"}
{"text":"Although I didn't know there was one closer to where I was staying, I'm glad to have been at your restaurant.  Everyone was very nice - and the manager stayed on the phone with me so I wouldn't get lost again.  The food was delicious!  I will most definitely be back when in LV."}
{"text":"We've always enjoyed Carrabba's but last night was horrible. My husbands soup was cold and his Pork Chops were over cooked. They also forgot to bring him the 2nd beer he asked for.  My salad was 1/2 yellow bitter romaine lettuce. I passed on the offer of cold soup so I went without anything. My Chicken Bryan was good,  and the manager said he'd give us dessert to go?? They didn't ask if we'd like to eat it there. He brought us one bagged up chocolate dessert. Since I hate chocolate we purchased a Apple/Carmel dessert ($8.99)I opened the dessert when we got home and the apple pastry was burned.   The free take home Lasagne was not the same as I've ordered in the past. It was small and dried out. So now I was really disappointed. I threw it in the trash along with the burned Apple Dessert. We'll never go back especially after spending $80 for poor customer service and food we couldn't eat."}
{"text":"This is the only chain I will eat at.  The Lake Norman location is particularly good with professional staff and well prepared food.  The sirloin marsala is a top notch dish."}
{"text":"My husband and I were visiting the area and decided to stop in for a late lunch early dinner. The service was excellent,  knowledgeable and friendly. I have diet restrictions and when I asked questions the waitress Mary happily asked the chef if certain items contained sugar.  She was eager to assist me in choosing the right dish based off my food restrictions. The food was succulent and flavorful. I order the wood grilled chicken with red sauce made the way I needed to be done with no sugar and no cheese.  My husband went off of the waitress recommendation and had the Mahi Wulfe. My husband said his fish was outstanding. During or visit we even met the owner he was polite and helpful as well.  It is nice to go to a restaurant and get knowledgeable service.  They did it right.  Bravo!"}
{"text":"I'm Italian and I am rather critical of Italian restaurants in the US (do not even get me started about Olive Garden!). This is the only Italian restaurant chain I've come across, that I find acceptable. No it's not as good as Italian food in Italy but it's pretty alright. I've been let down a couple times but far more often I've enjoyed my meals here. The prices are reasonable. Our most recent visit, our server was really great and I wish I had gotten her name so that I could name her here. She knew when to show up and when to go away, she was very cheerful and really just did a perfect job. Buon appetito!"}
{"text":"It's almost embarrassing to review a chain restaurant but as far as chains go, this is one of my favorites.   The pasta is decent although I don't think it is fresh. Their angel hair is the thickness of spaghetti and their bread is wonderful. They don't bring you balsamic vinegar unless you ask for it.   The service is always good. Service quality is up their with more expensive restaurants in town and they are always well versed on the menu.   My favorite dishes are the Tag Picpac and the Chicken Parm. and the soups are great as well.   One of the high points of Carrabbas is their portions are very large and always fill me up."}
{"text":"We came here for my mom's birthday. Great service! Eric was our server and made our time there very enjoyable. He was attentive, quick with drinks and on top of refills. He has a good attitude and was great with my kids. Food is always great. It's great to see managers on the floor too."}
{"text":"Went in on a Saturday we were sat right away. Our waiter was awesome he checked in on us frequently. He was knowledgeable about specials and everything on the menu. All the food was delicious and cooked perfectly. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"This  is  a  very  nice  atmosphere  and  the  food  is  always  good.  We  are  locals,  so  we  know  where  to  go."}
{"text":"been there so many times. love the food but there is one waitress that is very slow and you kind of feel like your being ignored. her name begins with a V. I have had here twice. the 1st time I put up with it thinking it was a bad day.. but again today, her servive was poor....."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant! The mussels and the chicken trio are the best things on the menu!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, but even better service. Staff was so friendly, from the hostess to the bus boys and server. Even a manager came by the check up. Food is fairly priced, so tasty and comes with soup or salad, and bread. One of the favorite places in the area!"}
{"text":"First time here and will be back.  Had the special steak with crab cake. Everything was cooked to perfection and was delicious Eric was are waiter and provided excellent service."}
{"text":"Yesterday we decided to stop off at Carrabbas Italian Grill for appetizers and wine. What a wonderful experience!! Not only was the food and wine absolutely joyous, but the staff was magnificent and the Mananger, Tonya always reaches out to say hello and makes sure our orders are absolutely delicious and perfectly served~ which they are ~every single time!!! Tonya will be transfering to the chandler branch but I can promise you Dear Sweet Tonya, my family and friends and I will be following you to the Chandler branch along with you!! You are the Best Restaurant Manager we have ever encountered!!!  Good Luck as the new manager of the Chandler Carrabbas and we look forward to visiting you there very soon and often!!! Sincerely, Deborah and Jim Web"}
{"text":"PSA for carb-loving vegetarians: Just found out about the new menu and they no longer have the baked ravioli :-(  This was the only reason I went here."}
{"text":"Disappointing... Ordered a filet mignonette and what they brought me was what appeared to be a small sirloin cut and not a filet cut. I brought this to the attention of our waiter. He then double checked the order and also confirmed with the cook that it was a filet. Folks I have been to many restaurants in my lifetime and I can tell you that was no filet. In their mind perhaps it was but I can tel you it was not. Lesson learned don't ever order beef at this food chain restaurant. They didn't even offer to discount the meal after I sent it back. Don't think I'll be coming here anymore.  I give Evan our waiter kudos for his part in taking care of us. It's not his fault my meal was not up to standards.  Shame on Carrabbas."}
{"text":"After a bad 20 minutes at the Cheesecake Factory, I knew Carrabbas would lift our spirits. This location always has top notch service, and tonight was no different. Our waitress Corinne was just lovely and the food came out quickly and tasted great.  This is without a doubt the best place on our side of town if you're looking for a quiet week night dinner."}
{"text":"We decided to try the shrimp appetizer it was good and I tried the shrimp and scallop linguine I didn't care for the dish much the shrimp and scallops were over cooked and the over all portion size was small . She had the sirloin and crab cake and the sirloin was ordered medium but it was well done ...over all a decent meal but I wouldn't go there again"}
{"text":"Five of us had dinner at Carrabba's on Saturday 3/10 and experienced a few problems with our food and service.  This was a surprise to us because we have been to Carrabba's numerous times and have always had excellent food and service.    We are type of people who understand that sometimes things happen, so we did not make a big deal about it and wrote it off as just a bad night....  Entrees came minutes after our salads were given to us. One entree was not what the person ordered. Food was just warm and not hot.  Not that big a deal, right?  Carrabba's answer was to comp all five meals, the sign of a truly great restaurant.    Carrabba's, a great place, good food and great management....."}
{"text":"This was horrible!  My husband ordered the lobster ravioli and you would think it was a kids meal. I ordered the margherita pizza and it was soggy and crust was terrible. I wished I could leave no stars. My first and last time at this place. Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"This is usually my favorite place to get Mama's Chicken Soup - as in I'll make a 20 minute drive just for soup. Tonight, however, I ordered a bowl of soup to go and got home to find merely 4 spoonfuls. So basically I paid almost $8 for nothing. What a shame Carrabas... you are usually my number one choice for take out. After tonight's rip off I think I'll stick to Giuseppe's wedding soup."}
{"text":"I am from North Carolina where I this was one of my favorite restaurants and I live in San Diego now. Needless to say this place would do amazing in California but they have not come out here so every time I am in Vegas I eat here! The chicken parm with the fettuccini alfredo as the side  is a favorite, as well as the steak marcella and the mashed potatos. Goodness I miss this place already!   Don't forget the Chocolate Dream!"}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday night, there was no wait which was great. The food was good but nothing special and the waitress efficient. We were seated by the front door which kept slamming shut throughout our meal. I would say it's worth giving this place a try!"}
{"text":"We're not at Olive Garden anymore!!!!  Thank goodness!  My mom and I came in Wednesday night for dinner.  We wanted to go somewhere we don't usually go.  It was pretty busy around 6:30 pm and we were we seated right away in a booth.  Our server (sweet young girl) asked if we've been to Carrabas which we said \"not in a while\". She then mentioned everything is prepared fresh so you can easily omit ingredients from your dishes if you prefer.  Cool!  My mom started with a Riesling and I tried the peach sangria.  We were both happy campers when the yummy warm bread arrived with seasoned olive oil dip.    We split the harvest salad which had beets, hazel nuts, carrots, goat cheese...pretty good! Not some bagged salad!  Wow that's nice for a change!  We also shared the spaghetti with italian sausage and oven pizza with mozzarella and pepperoni.  We enjoyed both dishes and ate it all!  Love how the mozzarella on the pizza was golden melted and well cooked throughout with a crisp bottom.  What a nice home cooked meal with quality and service. Our server was friendly and personable- truly taking the time to do it right! Kudos to the kitchen for serving up steaming hot fresh & flavorful italian!"}
{"text":"Our first time ordering on-line and picking up food from here.  Was a very pleasant experience, super easy.  Christi, the carry-out server was very friendly and helpful.  We already know we like their food, using the carry-out makes it easier and cheaper.  Love it!"}
{"text":"We went to dinner tonight with my family. Table of 10 walk in! The hostess told us it may be awhile and I think we waited less than 10 minutes. I am a server and was blown away by our server Mike he was the best!! He was funny, stern, and made our experience fun. He even made a special plate for me that I made up from different dishes on the menu. He engaged with the children and even commented on how polite they were. My family is usually leary about trying new places and he took the time to explain to them what they were ordering. We will definitely be back to see Mike. Thank you for the great experience, great food, and all around good time."}
{"text":"Carrabas for me was a so so experience. The food was good but it took awhile. The employees however were very kind and were understanding of my peers and I paying in all 1's and 5's. The Parking wasn't that good though and the location was a little hard to see. Another issue I had with this particular location was that they didn't have all the plants on the roof like they do in previous 4-5 star Carrabas I've attended in the past."}
{"text":"Excellent service and very good food. Garrett our server was fantastic. Extremely attentive. Order was perfect. Super friendly and helpful. I will go back just for him.   The food was very tasty. I had the spaghetti and meat sauce. Delicious... We had appetizers, soup, dessert. All was amazing. I hadn't eaten at a Carrabas before and will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Quality of meal was sub standard, pasta dish very starchy as was rice dish. Reported to manager who did not understand what \"starchy\" meant. She was not engaged did not seem to understand the difference between pasta and rice."}
{"text":"Chain Italian on South Boulevard.  The food is pretty good - especially the warm bread and olive oil served before the meal.  It is slightly overpriced.  I would go for dinner only since there is no dedicated (cheaper) lunch menu and the place just looks barren during the day.  The wait staff is friendly enough, though the food did seem to take a while to get out and we were some of the only people there.  Location is probably my favorite part, since it is near a ton of other fun things to do - art galleries, bars, shops."}
{"text":"We have been here many times as always 5 stars! Great food and service! The waiters know the menu well and are very helpful. It's a bit pricy but worth it. This is our families special occasion restaurant. I've been to other locations and they have all been great."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and the service and food were very good. My son had the lobster ravioli and I had the seafood cannelloni both were very satisfying. I had salad with the creamy parmesan dressing yum my new favorite dressing. Looking forward to dinning here again."}
{"text":"Newly remodeled very tastefully done, looks like more seating, partly blocked off the kitchen a good thing.  New menu with new items to pick from. Great food and friendly staff. This is not a tasteless 70s Olive Garden."}
{"text":"Came here the other night with friends and the food was very good the service was pretty good to seeing she had to wait on our table and the table next to us of our kids. We got the calamari for an appetizer and it was very good I got the fettuccine weesie and it was awesome!"}
{"text":"Slow and poor service.  The food is bland. Menu needs to be overhauled. Applebee's has better chef creations than this place. I'll never return."}
{"text":"Had a 7 person party with 4 being young kids. Our server Kevin made our experience friendly and enjoyable. He checked in frequently and made sure our experience was exceptional.  Thank you Kevin!"}
{"text":"Mike was our server he was knowledgeable great personality very attentive the food and his service was awesome.  We will definitely be back and ask for him."}
{"text":"Had such a great dining experience the past couple times here.  Our waiter Sam was the shit!  Just the right amount of service, knowledgeable, sensed needs before we did.   We ate on the patio because it was lovely outside.  Ordered some small plates: chicken lettuce wraps, asparagus wrapped in prosciutto and mozzarella, meatballs.  Everything delicious.  We also ordered a salad, which I thought was kind of expensive but when I got it it was worth it.  It was dressed perfectly with a punchy balsamic dressing and I couldn't have been happier with it. Sam brought us another round of bread and I was heaven.  By the way that bread is sooooo good.  Baked fresh, crusty outside, soft thick middle.  he brought us butter too.  We had the brownie with chocolate mousse for dessert.  Lord have mercy on my fat little soul......I would go back for that if there was a 50 percent chance I'd get a turd in it. I have a mild wheat allergy, but the bread is so good that I deal with the runny nose and itchy throat. Thank you carrabbas chefs for the wonderful on point food.  Thank you Sam for being such a great host. The one thing I was not happy about was the tap water.  It is disgusting, and I am baffled as to why you would serve that to anyone.  It is so cheap of a restaurant not to get a filtration system.  Come on man"}
{"text":"Fine job catering: steak Marsala was on point, ceasers salad, green beans, mashed potatoes and cannolis to finish. Good mix of doneness-es on the meat."}
{"text":"Love this place! I only wish they had better hours. This would be a great place to have lunch for office meetings or just with friends, but they are only open for dinner. That would be a huge bonus. But, I have always had great service and food here. The other night the waitress forgot to put our food order in and she gave us a free appetizer then and another one for our next visit. The ambiance is perfect for a date."}
{"text":"We stopped in not thinking or rembering that it was valentine's,  really. Got there about 4:15 waited only 20 minutes and was greeted warmly by Zach. Even though really busy we were allowed to dine and not he rushed. Every detail was great and it reminded me why going out to dinner use to be a special occasion. The salmon was great  and my parents had the dinner for two which at $45 was a wonderful bargain. My mom who normally is so picky was happy and content too.  Great local spot even though a chain and appreciated being remembered by another server, Page!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for our anniversary.  I ordered the johhny combo and my wife got the chicken Bryan.  Our server Drew provided us with most excellent service.  The food was excellent even when my sirloin was well done instead of medium like I asked for.  The marsalla still gave it a great flavor and it was still fairly tender.  The chicken Bryan is also very tasty.  Overall a great experience, which is exactly what we were expecting from going a couple years ago.  The negative reviews here about new management and bad service are unwarranted, at least from what we experienced."}
{"text":"This was the first time I've eaten here and the last! My waitress was really great however the food absolutely disgusting! This place makes olive garden look like a 5 star! I started with mozzarella sticks. Cheese melted but outside tasted like old grease. The salad was lettuce, carrots and dressing.  I'm not 4. I asked for onion croutons and tomatoes. Then the dinner. Wow, waited an hour for disgusting food! My chicken burnt and was so dry I couldn't chew it, my alfredo noodles cold, pasty and stuck together, my ravioli burnt, hard and impossible to eat without hurting your mouth because they were rock hard! I at this point was furious that I waited so long for this. When the manager came she didn't believe me and said she would check my ticket for check in time. Wow! I am not even exaggerating the hour wait. Then she said next time your chicken is hard and cold you need to tell us so we can cover it in more sauce! What! Is she serious! I let her know I tasted it and did tell you.  And sauce won't help this overcooked piece of meat! On top of all of this the water tasted so horrible we had to pay for soda, and the bathrooms (both of them) smelled like sewer with toilets that were clogged and about to overflow. And our table was sticky and dirty! Geez! I wish I never went and will stick to my cooking or rigatonis if I'm craving italian that I don't have to cook. I hope you really consider my review before you eat here. Bathrooms and tables are a good sign of not sanitary elsewhere too! Thats probably why we were both sick before we got home as well. Just from eating the salad and a couple bites. :("}
{"text":"The operating partner took a promotion earlier this year and the place has gone downhill ever since. It is clear they are cutting corners. Today was our first visit in months and will be our last. Our food must have sat at expo waiting for one item for a long time because it was all cold except for one side. Expo 101 is to deliver all of the other food and return later with the one item.  The quality has also degraded. It really isn't much better than Olive Garden, just with higher prices. We hate seeing our favorite restaurant decline like this. It is clear that the former partner held it together. I'm sure her new area is benefiting from her presence."}
{"text":"Great food, great bread Been going there for years It is just a family crave / tradition."}
{"text":"I have been to this location multiple times and I have been impressed with the staff, service, and food every time.  I was very indecisive on my meal because their current menu didn't have the Chicken Trio, which I usually get.   My server, Katelyn, was amazing and told me they could do the Chicken Trio for me.   I was so impressed, she didn't even give the \"well, let me go check and see\"  that you often receive.   She actually suggested it to me and I couldn't have been more pleased.   The food was delicious. I was surprised by the quality of the salad that came with the meal.  It wasn't just a big pile of iceberg lettuce that you get at other Italian restaurants.  It had romaine, baby greens, carrot slivers, radishes, gourmet olives, and choice of dressing and the portion was very generous."}
{"text":"I feel really bad, because they comped my meal, but if you want dinner, you want food, not a comped, inedible meal.  My glass of wine was vinegary, and I got a new one.  My salad was iceberg lettuce and a few carrot shavings.  My chicken was so salty I couldn't eat two bites, and the pasta served with it was cold.  Not lukewarm, but cold.  Daughter and husband liked what they had, but what do they know?  The waiter was very sweet, and the manager came over and explained that he would not only comp my meal, but make me something else, also comped.  By now everyone else was done, so I declined.  I went back to my hotel and drank two liters of water to rinse the salt out.  They did what they could, but I still wouldn't go back:/  Too bad, because for a chain, I remember having a few good meals in Carrabbas in Florida."}
{"text":"I'm a Carrabba's guy, everywhere I go in the US.  This experience wasn't  the  best, I always order the chicken Marsala this time it didn't look the same (not a lot of sauce and mushrooms as I'm used to and the chicken was very thin) I thought  that all the restaurants would be the same. The service was very good though.  I expected more though.  This experience would not keep me from going back to my local Carrabbas"}
{"text":"I'm actually here at the moment, and their food is so great I just had to yelp about it! Even as I ate their appetizers I was like \"omg\"..."}
{"text":"Oh where do I begin?  I normally do not  have any issues when we eat here but tonight was the night from hell!   One good thing was we didn't have to wait too long for a table because we did the call ahead.   The salad,  bread & wine were all good as usual. Then I had to watch my boyfriend enjoy his food while I waited for mine!!!!!!!  Don't ask for anything deleted from the way it appears on the menu it will be a disaster!!!!!!!!!! Twice I had to send my food back.   How difficult is it to not put broccoli or spices on a dish!!!!!!!  Now the third time it came & is still wrong!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Food was good and service and atmosphere were as well. We were there for a party so there was 15 of us roughly and the drinks and food came promptly which isn't always the case with big groups. Apps were great had the meatballs and arncini rice balls, main course was good too me having the lasagna and my wife the lobster ravioli both really yummm! Sangria was tasty and it's nice they have many gluten free options (not for us but it's still nice they offer it) we be back!!"}
{"text":"I have been going to this Carraba's for the 15 years we have lived in this area.   The quality of service & product has been going downhill for the past 3 years.   Our last visit a few days ago may be our last visit.   Our server had little interest in needs or the other couples needs during our visit.   She never checked in with us for drink refills or water refills.   My wife felt the server was having a bad day, this should not be our problem.   I ordered a pizza which I have often in the past, this time the pizza was dry, like it had been made the day before.   I attempted to find the proprietor as we left, however, he was not available.   Too bad, the good news is we, like many couples, have many choices on where to spend our dining dollars. MGrady"}
{"text":"My husband and I came in for dinner one evening and we were sat in a little booth next to the kitchen. Loved watching the cooks. Our server was incredibly nice and the food was excellent. I also tried the peach sangria. YUM! I did have one issue with my visit. It was regarding management. Val, I believe her name was treating her cooks so poorly. They were all working hard and if she didn't think so, she should get back there herself and help. Every few minutes she would yell something about hot food and send her equally undertrained manager to go yell at servers. This manager was named Rita or Reba I believe. They were so unhelpful to their staff on a busy night and just walked around angry at the world. Also, they weren't wearing gloves when getting the food together on the counter. I feel bad that the poor workers here have to work for those two sinister women. Corporate should really look into who they let run a restaurant. They think we can't see these issues but here, they are VERY apparent. 5 stars for all the hard workers and yummy food. 0 for Val and Rita/Reba."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the better \"Chain\" Italian restaurants. While I try to support the mom-n-pops, I need to do my due diligence and check out all the deals. Came in for the free spaghetti and meat balls to take home. Just gotta order one of their chicken dishes. We chose the trio. Wow, each chicken had their own umami going on. Char-grilled to perfection! Because I enjoyed all three offerings, I'm gonna rank it to MY preference. #1 - tie between the Marsala and Pollo Rosa Maria. #2 - chicken Bryan  Yes, I recommend Carraba's. The fresh bread to the cup of coffee.  (I do luv a good cup of coffee)  Jake our server, all on point! I wish we had a Carraba's in NorCo San Diego."}
{"text":"They were pretty busy during dinner time on Monday; nonetheless had plenty of sitting in the bar (liquor bar, salad, and pizza) area. I sat at the Pizza Bar area. My waitress was exceptional; greeted me with a smile as soon as I sat down and brought me a glass of water during her greeting and got my order quickly. I ordered the shrimp and scallops pasta. Oh my this was a huge portion and it was delicious! The shrimp and scallops were cooked perfectly and so was the pasta; el dente just how I like it. The gentleman at the pizza bar was entertaining. He managed to complete his orders while talking to me as well as other guests in the area at the same time. He made an apple fritter dessert and it looked so good that I had to place an order after my meal. Oh my it was as good as it looked. I'd highly recommend this place for dinner because of great food and service."}
{"text":"Party of 5 of us enjoyed a lovely meal here. Very nice service with Joshuwa. He endured my Dad's very strange sense of humor. Delicious food. Festive Holiday decor too"}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner after my father-in-law got into town. Little bit of a wait but well worth it. Lisa took great care of us--excellent service. Thanks so much for a delicious evening!!"}
{"text":"We went in at 5 pm  this last Monday. We were seated RIGHT away and had our drink orders RIGHT AWAY.  MORGAN our server was AWESOME. Very polite and answered all my questions.   And was attentive.   Food was AMAZING..  Being in the food industry and being married to a chef I know food and the restrsnt side as well. I DON'T usually give 5 stars , but couldn't find a thing wrong here. From the service to our food , we will be going back."}
{"text":"I hate chains.  I want to hate this place so bad. HOWEVER.... Every time I come I have a GREAT experience.  The food is good.  The service is EXCELLENT, bordering on perfect.  The prices are very fair."}
{"text":"Very good food delivered in a timely fashion. Prices moderately high compared to some peripheral casino buffets."}
{"text":"Met some relatives here for dinner on a Friday evening.  This was my first visit to a Carrabba's, and the food was cheaper than I had expected.  The food was acceptable, but nothing memorable.  The restaurant had an overall dirty feeling - bad smells, sticky floor, etc.  The worst part of our visit was the service - so chaotic.  I swear we had repeat every request to two different people.  I hope to never go back."}
{"text":"I'm a regular here when I'm in town... at least a couple times a month or sometimes 2x a week if I am on a binge!  Great and consistent service staff... excellent flavor on my favorite dish the linguine positano which use to be tag pic pac.  For those who like the original tag pic pac like I do, I request the positano with fettuccine and grilled shrimp which comes out yummy!  Finally, the blackberry sangria is W.O.W!!! So good I had to look it up the recipe online to make it at home!"}
{"text":"went for lunch on 3-31-18. arrived at 11:15. waited for my soup till 11:40. server said it was still cooking. annoying. server was good. food was ok. all was good except for the long wait for the soup. soup should be ready when resturant opens at 11:00"}
{"text":"1st time here tonight . Eval:  Excellent food + the service was great , they bought our food out super quickly . I had the pork Tenderloin , it was so yummy . My hubby had calamari and spaghetti which was also good . I really enjoyed the atmosphere and the friendliness of all the staff , we will be going here for Italian food from now on :)"}
{"text":"I'll make this short and sweet. Went there with the wife and sat at the bar overlooking the exhibition kitchen. Service was ok, but nothing spectacular. The food, overall was good, The mussels were fantastic, the mezzaluna was ok and the Margherita Pizza pizza was a little too salty, but otherwise ok. Watching the cooks working was priceless,  Having owned a restaurant, it is fun to watch a staff that is well trained and working in unison. However, the front of the house staff, especially the hostess, could use some work. When you are seated and you have to ask for the menu and the response is \"yah\", well.... Still it was a pleasant place to go."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time with family. What a great place to eat. I usually do not enjoy chain restaurants, but this place felt more real than chain like. The staff are very helpful and attentive. The wine pours were amazing ;). The food was delicious. No one had a complaint. Well flavored and spiced. Presentation wonderful and we even had dessert. If you like Italian this is a good choice for a good price."}
{"text":"Not imoressed with this place.  We had a party of 6 and waited an hour and a half for our food.  The lasagna was soupy and the waiter stuck his thumb in my food when he reached around me to fill my water.  I didn't realize he was reaching for my water as he did not say excuse me until after he stuck his thumb into my food.  They charged us for alcohol that we did not order.  Fortunately no one at our table had any alcohol so it was easy to dispute.  Finally, the prices are higher than other better places.   I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Came here with a couple of friends on a Tuesday. The place was not packed so that was nice. Our server was Thomas ,he was very attentive to our table and we never had to wait too long for anything. Something you do not see in many chain restaurants is Arancini. Carrabba's has it on their appetizer menu. They are small little Arancini's another thing I have never had. I have only had the larger ones. They are filled with the rice pasta, cheese, sometimes meat and vegetables. The ones here are awesome. I recommend them very much. Although they are deep fried.  Our group all got a different meal. Which everyone thought was very good. I got the Salmon, delish. The other 2 ladies got Lasagna,which was a large portion and Chicken Bryan which had a great cheese and sauce. All in all our food was great! The drinks are a bit over priced though I think for that type of place.  Restrooms are clean and there is lots of parking in the private lot."}
{"text":"I had an impromtu dinner there late last night with a friend of mine. I have never dined there before so my feelings and opinions were neutral from the start. I am not too big of a fan on chain restaurants in general, as they all appear to be bland across the board. I was satisfied with the menu selections, but disappointed with the portion sizes and the price for what you are paying for. I ordered a pasta dish that looked more like a luncheon portion then a dinner portion. It was luke warm, which tells me it was either reheated, or it sat under a heat lamp for quite some time.  The service was a tad bit too slow, as it was a slow weeknight evening, i would have expected fast service. I would recommend this restaurant for maybe a light lunch option, but most certainly not for dinner, unless you want to walk away hungry. But, in my book, Carrabba's still beats out Olive Garden hands down for overall food quality and price."}
{"text":"Love love love the mama's Sicilian chicken soup.   Brynne is an outstanding hostess,  pleasant and master of getting guests seated when servers are ready.   This location could use a few more servers to keep up with the rush.  Painfully slow tonight (1 1/2 hours for soup and salad plus one entree) but our server (Christina) was pleasant and tried her best.  UPDATE 1 month later.... BRING BACK JOHN COLE DESSERT!!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious! Bought my wife and kids here for dinner. Our waitress Monica was awesome! She took care of us and made sure we never ran out of anything weather it was pop, bread or adult beverages. My son had ordered one of their salads and did not realize it had mushrooms. When the order arrived he noticed and started to take them out. The waitress noticed and said she would bring out another one without mushrooms. WELL that was not possible due to the fact that the mushrooms were in the sauce that was per made. She then offered to comp us another dish AND gave my wife that dish to go! Great people great service. Highly recommend!! Best waitress by far and waitresses like Monica keep customers like me coming back. Keep up the great service and food."}
{"text":"Went there last night, Sara m was an exceptional server!!  Approached us quickly after being seated, took beverage and appetizers. All courses came in a timely manner. Restaurant was busy and she always had a smile. Checked on us frequently refilling waters. All in all great experience Thanks Sara!!"}
{"text":"Nice great service , good food and decent prices. I would absolutely choose Carrabba's over Bucca di Yucko !  Took my wife for a nice steak dinner meat was perfectly cooked my chicken  marsala very good. We are coming back !"}
{"text":"Wine Dinners are the best!! Ask about it and attend! Great service, great food and awesome wine pairings!"}
{"text":"This chain is one of my most favorite & this location had the quality I expect both in food & staffing. We were greeted by engaging hostesses, and seated immediately. Bryan, our server, appeared almost instantly to take our drink orders. His service was impeccable, anticipating what we needed before asking. Carrabba's is always a great place for incredibly delectable flavored & something quiet for special occasions."}
{"text":"This place was honestly pretty good. I went to this restaurant not knowing what to expect because I usually go to Olive Garden. But I ordered the fettuccini Carrabba and it was easily better than olive gardens chicken Alfredo. It was delicious. Screw Olive Garden, this is my new home."}
{"text":"Years ago before I ever considered myself a foodie and was just and avid home cook, this was my favorite local restaurant to eat at. To this day it's still my favorite chain restaurant. Yea, they usually have a long wait for a table on the weekends but I  didn't mind waiting because I enjoy their alcohol selection and bar service.   I have ordered the shrimp bruschetta tons of time, with large shrimp, nice garlic sauce and crusty bread, I strongly recommend this app. Also, their mussels are really good too, if your into that sort of thing.  I quickly learned it's not necessarily about the pasta here, more so about the grilled meats. This place has given me some excellent fillet's in my day. I had the filet marsala one day (was a special for that day) then proceeded to order it ever since. I get it with a side of fettuccine alfredo instead of mashed potatoes.  Even though it's not on the menu daily, they will serve it, if you ask.   I do enjoy their chicken soup, it is exceptional and it comes with your entree. If their out (which happens a lot if your a late diner like me) I go with the caesar, which is a great substitution.   I always take home desert because I'm too stuffed to eat it there. Dessert Rosa is my favorite, by far. Delicious butter cake topped with pastry cream, bananas, strawberries, pineapple and whipped cream. So good, but the last time I was there it wasn't available in full size, only a shot glass. Either way, as long as they have it, I'm fine with that.   I need to go back here soon, after writing this review I want it so bad."}
{"text":"Two stars because I am feeling generous!!!!  I ordered baked ravioli with lemon butter sauce (yummmmm) my problem is that didn't give enough sauce at all. Barley covered the ravioli.   I also asked for a side of Alfredo... I was charged $5.41 for barley 2oz of Alfredo sauce. I knew it would cost I believe I was told $2-$3 by the waitress but not $5 for 2oz I mean the least they could've done is given 5oz $1 per oz......OUTRAGEOUS!!!! Take your business to Maggiano's they will not charge a penny for extra sauce. My fiancé and I always order extra sauces with our food there. He likes mixing red & white. I love their Marsala and we always get plenty FREE OF CHARGE.   Also my to go order for my fiancé, I had asked for a salad without tomatoes and olives well they somehow managed to get a tomato in there. Smh. I wish I hadn't tipped as generously. Highly disappointed...     Also not very friendly if you are handicapped you could be waiting at the door for hours if you don't have someone helping you in. I mention this because I had my daughter with me and am 38wks kinda hard with the belly to be opening doors.... Anyways I will never be going back. Fiancé agrees."}
{"text":"OK???  No offense, but anyone who gives this place a 5 stars is on something.  Not onto something... on something.  Whatever you wanna call it, meth, speed, crank, ice, rock.  Must be some good ish. Or you've never had italian food before in which this will do.  This place sucks on so many levels I cant even write a full review without getting turrets. \"Ahh F' u suck Carrabba's! ahh\"   OK I'll try...  My first nightmare at the Henderson Carrabba's was terrible.  Cold food, bad service. I didn't leave a tip.  Terrible experience.  But my GF wanted to try it one day, so the second nightmare began when I went to eat at this \"restaurant\" and my date and I decided to eat outdoors.  This was obviously a problem cause we got NO SERVICE AT ALL. I had to walk in and remind them that we were there. WOW. OK so besides this, it's all about the food, right? I order the lasagna and about an hour later when we finally get our food after three or four bread baskets, the lasagna comes out... I begin to eat, biting into the lasagna.  This ish was hard as a rock.  Burnt to a crisp.  Crazy right? After all that time you'd think they'd try to get it right.  They comped the meal, but of course they should have. Ridiculous (not in a good way)... My GF's meal was gross too and we left w/out eating anything.   I mean, is there a no stars?   CLIFFNOTES: DO NOT GO TO THIS RESTAURANT!!!   PS: I can't wait til it shuts down. (I had to reedit this and take out all the curse words.)"}
{"text":"Still the best!!! Amazing Happy Hour. Amazing food.  I love the Pollo Rosa Maria, Chicken Bryan, And Sirloin Marsala.  All to die for.  We love the Mussels appetizer, the bread too.  Miss the fried cheese.  Also the BEST Red Sangria on the planet."}
{"text":"Yum! First time I'd eaten here...hooray for birthdays! First off, the salad was fresh and the dressing was delicious! The calamari appetizer was tasty, came with a lemon pepper butter sauce and marinara... We tried the chicken parm (tasty and tender) and the pollo rosa maria (mushrooms and some random spices). Delish! Meals also come with bread and an olive oil/herb spread. Staff is really nice and helpful as well. Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"I read some of the reviews online and so I was hesitant to go here. I went in a Friday night and had called in for the wait list. We got right in and out server was attentive and thorough. Thanks Sarah for a good experience. The food came out quickly and it was delicious."}
{"text":"Consistency is the key here. It was a slow night for this usually booming business and some of the servers were gathering talking about how terrible the night was going to be. A little annoying, but I sat at the bar and my server/bartender was amazing!! She was so attentive and got me everything I needed without me asking. The epitome of great service."}
{"text":"My family and I came here for the first time last night. We were all very pleased with our meals. It was quite fantastic.   We started off with the bread with herbs, olive oil, and balsamic which was fantastic. The bread was nice and warm. We also ordered the calamari and zucchini fritte. The calamari was way overcooked and we were not satisfied with it at all, I could barely pick it up with my fork because it was so crunchy. The zucchini fritte was very delicious. The garlic aioli that it came with was also very tasty.   I had the Chicken Bryan with garlic mashed potatoes. The chicken had goat cheese, sundried tomatoes, and basil on it. It was so delicious. The goat cheese almost melted in my mouth when I ate it. It was fantastic. However, the chicken was a tiny bit overcooked but the flavors made up for it. The mashed potatoes were also awesome! I also had the peach sangria which was good but it tasted a lot like juice.   My husband had the chicken trio and he also enjoyed his meal very much. Although, he did say that his chicken was a bit overcooked. My parents both had the veal Marsala and they enjoyed it very much too. I didn't get to taste theirs so I can't really comment on it.   The service was great too but not the best waiter I've ever had. He was quick and efficient though so it was good. The girl at the front desk was not very friendly though.   Overall, a great place and it's always booming with business. Every time I drive by the parking lot is always packed. The food is great and we were satisfied."}
{"text":"I have only been to carrabba's once in the past. My boyfriend and I wanted Italian but not the same old. He had spaghetti and meatballs and I had mezzaluna. My bf said he's was pretty good and I enjoyed mine. It had a tomato cream sauce, which I really liked, but wish there was more of it. There is no carrabba's super close to us, but we will make the trip again."}
{"text":"I always look forward going to Carabbas in LV because they don't have one in CA. This is one of my favorite Italian restaurant and they nevver disappoint. One of the best things here is their happy hour deal available ONLY in the bar area wherein ALL APPS are half off and they have good deals on their special beverages. Furthermore they have small plates choices that are really good and affordable. I recommend getting their lettuce wraps and stuffed mushrooms. They are good and filling! I will be definitely back here again."}
{"text":"The steak Marsala is absolutely amazing!!! We always have great service. This is my daughters favorite restaurant.   We eat at Carabbas probably every six weeks or so.   I highly recommend any of their chicken or steak entrees."}
{"text":"WOW! We were waited on by the manager, he was awesome. We didn't know he was the manager. We never met our waitress. The hostess was even rude as he@&. The salad was nothing but the core of the lettuce. The meatballs were flavorLESS balls of hamburger. We didn't stay for desert. The waitress never greeted us!  If it hadn't been for a great manager, we would never go back! Half of the star goes for the manager."}
{"text":"First time at this chain of restaurant and would not ever go back. Ordered the chicken park which was dry, little cheese and even less sauce. Pathetic. Also had the flat bread appetizer and that was fine. The bread (hard to get that wrong) was warm the dipping oil was good. Bottom line is that I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Worth the drive!   The food was delicious and unique. Nice change from the same-old, mass-produced Olive Garden offerings.  The staff was exceptional. Especially the manager, Ashley, who interacted with our kids and made them feel special.  Last but not least: the Chocolate Dream is the most amazing dessert I've ever had!  I'd come back just for a bite of that!"}
{"text":"It was our first time and it was great! We enjoyed the food, pasta and chicken trio....yum. The service was good. I would of been happy with the appetizer, calamari, and their bread & dip. So Good. We even got a visit from the manager! Everyone was so nice!"}
{"text":"My cousin and I visited Carrabba's after spending all day at the Aji Spa. For a Friday night, the restaurant was empty, so we got seated right away. The bread and olive oil (with seasonings) they served at the beginning was just the thing to get my already hungry appetite going even more.  I ordered the Mezzaluna: half moon ravioli stuffed with chicken, ricotta and spinach in a tomato cream sauce. It was quite tasty and filling! My cousin ordered the Chicken Marsala: grilled chicken breast topped with mushrooms, prosciutto and wine marsala sauce. That marsala sauce was scrumptious!!!!  I would have been happy eating the fresh bread with that mushroom marsala sauce!   We were too full for dessert, but it's definitely a place that I wouldn't mind returning to. The service was good, food was yummy and affordable and I have no complaints. Yay for Carrabba's!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite mid-priced Italian restaurant! I loooove it. I absolutely love the warm bread and the olive oil dipping sauce they give you upon arrival. I always get the sirloin Marsala as my entree, Let me tell you AMAZING. I have tried other things on occasion which were good, but this is my fave dish by far. Mmmm I am getting hungry thinking about it, lol.   This is a couple steps above olive garden. The food just taste better and is of higher quality, and is really about the same price range. A waiter once clued me in on a little secret, and said they use the same exact meat products from the same supplier as Flemings located right next door. Well, Flemings is \"fine dining\" and will cost you a pretty penny for the same steak. The staff is always very friendly and attentive. I have dined here many times and have never had a bad experience.  Oh, and one last plus. Delicious Sangria!"}
{"text":"Good food and great service last night. Only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because they were out of salmon, and although extremely delicious, our Lemoncello bread pudding was awfully small in portion for being $8. Also, it was served in an extremely hot skillet which made the ice cream melt super quick, but the bread pudding was only warm in some places and actually cold, (like right out of the fridge), in other spots. All in all, a good dining experience though."}
{"text":"This is an over-priced, pretentious fast-food outlet for Bloomin' brands..also over priced! The only reason I gave it a star was the meatball was pretty good Here are the problems: ordering online is almost impossible. Their site crashed my computer 3 times before I gave up and called. I reached someone who put me on hold after which I was connected to the take-out person who was very nice and professional. The food is terrible. Even my spaghetti was terrible. I tried the gluten free which may have contributed to the problem. There was very little sauce. How does one screw up spaghetti?  We also ordered sausage which was terribly over cooked and dry. Flavor seemed ok after one gets over the outer char. Don't waste your time with this place. There are much better real Italian restaurants like Mastrioni's Chef Marc's, or Roma Deli nearby. Their fare is worth the money."}
{"text":"I always come here for their Chicken Bryan. Grilled chicken topped with goat cheese and dried tomatoes. Their Lasagna is pretty good too. Haven't tried much else from their menu because the CB is always my choice but I know everything else is good from what my friends say."}
{"text":"I was fairly unimpressed with Carrabba's this time around. It had been a few years at least since I had last tried it, but I do remember it being better the last time I had it. Maybe it was just the dish that I had, but it was pretty average and too expensive."}
{"text":"Very nice bartender.  After an hour of waiting for the food, I gave up.  Bye Carrabba's!"}
{"text":"these guys aren't the. best but for a big chain restaurant there good but the server I think his name was Cody was five stars the whole night he was on it never needed to ask for refills he gave honest opinion on what he like and didn't care for I had thus seafood stew can't remember the name but on these cold nights I would highly recommend it"}
{"text":"This place is so bad. I can't believe I let myself come here again. Daughter had gummy Alfredo. I had a Jenny Craig portion of chicken parm. Totally pathetic. Wife had lobster rav with so little sauce she had to order more. All served by an untrained 18 yr old.  Never again."}
{"text":"Place is amazing! Service at the bar from Jim is great, managers are great! Lindsay stopped by to check on us, food was perfect! Chicken soup was great along with the lobster ravioli!!!"}
{"text":"Really good food! The chicken Bryan is the best and not fattening for those watching their calorie intake. Services is usually good, last time I was here though we didn't have a great waitress and I honestly believe she was on something, eyes were blood shot and she was slurring her words. The only thing I think it could use is some light, this place is really dark even in the mid morning time. Other than that I have always enjoyed their menu."}
{"text":"We ate here recently, I won't tell you the exact date, in case this review gets back to Steve, our waiter.   But I will say, we eat at Carrabas probably 10 times a month. It is one of our favorite restaurants. On this visit,  we were ordering. I Ordered my usual salad. Steve asks me if I want to add blue cheese and I say \"Sure\" then I say, \"I have never been asked that before, is that something new?\" To which Steve says, \"no, I always ask everybody if they want blue cheese\" and I said \"Oh\" so I said \"Sure, I will add blue cheese\" then he proceeds with my  husband's salad and asks if he wants blue cheese, my husband said \"no\".  Another wait staff member walks by.. Steve, in a proud like manner says \"Hey! Who adds on the most blue cheese here?\"  The waitress said \"You do Steve\" not missing a beat or a step and just kept walking. So, I said to Steve, \" Why is it such a proud accomplishment to be the highest ranking blue cheese giver at Carrabas, is there an up charge for it or something?\"  To which Steve replied \"Yes, but it's only $2. And you get a nice big chuck of blue cheese\". And then I said \"Well, you didn't mention the $2 up charge Steve.\" And he said  (in a gentlemanly cocky and arrogant way) \"I said would you like to \"ADD\" blue cheese, that's how I do it\" and I said \"You are a rat, I don't want the blue cheese\".   So moral of my story, In MY PROSPECTIVE or PERCEPTION, whatever you wanna call it, Steve is a scammer.  And the only reason he is top blue cheese sales guy is his ability to \"fake\" people into thinking he is just adding a nice chunk of blue cheese on their salad. I guarantee you that if he told customers clearly, up front about the $2 up charge, half of the customers would decline the add on.  Most customers probably don't even realize the up charge on their bill, or if they do, then Steve just says, \"I said \" ADD\" then the customer feels stupid and Stevo wins!!!!! You better believe when our bill came, I looked it over, not for the blue cheese ADD ON, but for anything scammer like.  If he feels proud and like he's the pro at getting people to buy something they are not aware of, I don't trust him as far as I could throw him.... Moral of the story; a chunk  of blue cheese on your salad is $2 out of the pocket.  Just so you know ."}
{"text":"Had the Rocco salad as a take out item my husband picked up when he had dinner with his parents. It was tasty. The 6 shrimp and 4 scallops were cooked well but 16.99 for a salad that fit in a 2 cup Tupperware? I had thought to split it but as an entree salad it was quite small. No bread was included in the take out either. So many other decent restaurants to choose  from..."}
{"text":"Wow. I hadn't been here in years and went last night at my mom's request and we were both blown away. Food quality, service, value...everything. The arancini appetizer was delish! My mom had the shrimp and scallops...they were grilled and then served with a side of grilled asparagus. Outstanding. I had the mahi and it came with a delectable sauce with artichoke hearts and sun dried tomatoes. We were too full to try dessert so maybe next time!"}
{"text":"This is the second time in three months that we placed a takeout order.  I wished that we didn't give it a second chance at takeout.  Placed the order online, it said it would be ready in twenty minutes. Arrived at the restaurant and parked in their Curbside area and waited. The lot had a number of cars but not a full lot.  I was the only car in the Curbside area and after 30 minutes I went to the door. Locked. I knocked on the door and was told to go into the restraurant, so. I guess the Curbside area including the door is uselessly marked area.  Went inside got my order and when I got home found no sauce for the calamari,  another dish was cold but the real issue besides lack of curbside service was their signature dish. The Carrabas pasta dish, in which we ordered two, looked like they tried to split one into two ordered. The portions are not even close to the serving size when you dine in, and only two small strips of chicken per order. I won't go back and give them another chance. Working long hours I thought that Carrabas could be a go to for takeout but the service is lacking and the quality is that of screw you at the takeout."}
{"text":"Decent place. Went on a Saturday night and didn't have to wait to be seated, which was nice. The server came straight over and started taking our order. She was friendly and welcoming...although she did forget to bring our bread. The food came in a timely manner and was tasty. The serving sizes were a bit on the small side though. Overall a nice place."}
{"text":"Decided to have an early Father's Day dinner tonight...what a joke! We were seated right away which was great until a good ten minutes went by and our server \"Zach\" never showed up to our table. We got up and left and will never dine there again. We used to love this place but the service has definitely gone downhill. It's unfortunate because we actually enjoy the food."}
{"text":"My favorite Italian in town, good food. Great staff, especially James in bar. Really love the chicken marsala"}
{"text":"This review is for this location and not the chain itself.  The fries zucchini app is so good, but I don't like the sauce they serve with it. I got a side of their Parmesan Caesar and it's amazing with the zucchini.  I got the spaghetti and sausage with the tomato cream sauce. The sauce was watery and didn't cover a fraction of the noodles. I left almost the entire dish untouched and the server didn't even question it, and he wasn't around enough to show him. Lunch took over an hour and an half. WHAT!!! We got there right when it opened.   Basically the service here was terrible. We spent a lot of time waiting for drinks to be refilled and food to come out. Tables around us sat after us and got their food before us..?? The boys were fussy so we just wanted to leave."}
{"text":"Bruschetta was pretty good and the waitress was friendly the seafood was descent needed more flavor though overall good place"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant.  I've been coming to this location since 1999.  Fabulous food and excellent service."}
{"text":"Nicole r was very friendly and the food was great.  The hostess was not super friendly but I didnt let it ruin my night"}
{"text":"Normally I am a huge fan of this chain.  However, this is the worst restaurant I have ever been to.  The calimari we ordered came out full of grease and fried batter. The waiter Noah told my pregnant wife that she should drink more water because it is good for inflammation. Seriously, about wanted to punch him in the face.  My order was brought out with the wrong side.  Was told this would be fixed, never was!!  One whole dollar was taken off our order!!! Food was average at best...stay away from this location!!"}
{"text":"I remember going to Carrabba's years ago with a friend in Florida.  First visit and I loved it.  We didn't have them in Massachusetts back then, and in recent years, there still weren't many in our area, so I didn't get there often.  But now we live here in AZ, and last weekend we decided to have dinner there.  It wasn't what I remembered.  The restaurant itself seemed like it had seen better days.  When we sat down, the chairs were creaky and a bit unstable.  I was just hoping they wouldn't break while we were eating.  I also felt that the overall dining room setup was odd and they crammed some tables in at odd angles.  As for the food....our salads were less than impressive - a lot of very cold bagged lettuce mix with not much else.  I ordered the mezzaluna ravioli as I remember enjoying them so much in the past.  They were just ok and not what I remembered.  Overall, I was disappointed and I doubt we'll be back."}
{"text":"This is the only chain Italian restaurant we will patronize. The food is fresh, and the selection is just right. The staff is always professional. The place is clean as well"}
{"text":"My husband and I enjoy coming here. We always enjoy our food and rarely ever have to wait long for a table. We like sitting at the bar. This is a nice option for a casual date night. But the highlight for me is the chocolate dream dessert. If you are a chocolate fan you MUST try it. Hands down my favorite dessert of all time! Sometimes we come in just to get it!"}
{"text":"Came here this past weekend and it was super packed. It was a Saturday evening so I wasn't surprised. Wait was about 20 minutes? Not too bad.  I ordered the Pasta Carrabba which is fettuccine alfredo with grilled chicken, sauteed mushrooms and peas, except I substituted the pees for broccoli. Everything tasted great and the mushrooms actually tasted like chicken to me LOL. Oh, and I also got myself a cosmo to sip on and my oh my was it strong. .. but who's complaining? It got the job done with just a few sips. Talk about a cheap date haaayyyyy :D   The only minor complaint I do have is our waiter never brought out more bread as I requested, until I reminded him a second time. It was pretty busy that night so no biggie.. and PLUS at that point, I was too tipsy to even really care!"}
{"text":"My review is regarding Reba who works at the bar.  I come there quite often, and every time I am seated at the bar she doesn't acknowledge me until at least 10 mins later and while I order my food she continues to favor other clients at the bar and ignore me nor ask if I need anything, has failed to even offer me napkin/utensils after serving me my plate.  I have to ask her for a napkin or another drink.  She seems very negative/rude and have found/heard her complaining to other customers at the bar about her personal life - very unprofessional.  I avoid any time I come when she's at the bar and never request her as a server."}
{"text":"Ate there last night, Saturday.  Ordered the pasta with pomadoro sauce.  It was excellent, the service was great and the Manager came over to check on our level of satisfaction."}
{"text":"I typically love Carrabbas but something with this location. Moved to area a few more the ago and now given it three tries. I don't want to stop enjoying Carrabbas but may have to limit when I'm in Scottsdale or something.  First was a carryout. Ordered gluten-free. Salad had croutons. Hmmm. Should have stopped there but I was hungry and ticket read gluten free. I got sick. I even emailed them to explain experience and no return message or anything...  Second came with a friend. Slowest service. Food took forever and a day. Even the soup, I mean really? Refills were tough to get. Waited forever for check, you get the point. It wasn't busy. I'm pretty forgiving being I worked in industry in past.  And I tried again tonight. Ate alone at bar to not take up much room. Guy walked up to me like he didn't think to say hi or give me a menu. They were doing amore Monday on Tuesday, no special menu, no happy hour info. No Silverware. Asking for cheese seemed like I was awful to ask. I felt ignored and Iike how dare I bother him.  It's sad. I love this place, just not this location. I emailed first time so management knows what's going on but I figured that was ignored, will this help them improve??? I'd only hope..."}
{"text":"So disappointed.  My in-laws came to celebrate my wife's birthday.  We called ahead, still had to wait for almost an hour.  After we were finally seated we had to wait even longer for water and bread.  We ordered wine and soda for the kids and it finally came.  My wife's dish came out 6-10 minutes before anyone else's.  The others only came after I pointed out that she was the only one who had food.  My \"Johnny\", which is my favorite plate, was bad on all counts.  The pasta was cold and flavorless, the steak was too salty and the chicken bryan was ok but not great.  My wife's plate was too salty as well and my father in law's plate was as off as mine.  We love going to Carraba's as do my in-laws and my parents.  Tonight's meal was beyond poor.  The manager informed us that he was having many problems with the new cook and this was not out of the ordinary.  The manager was apologetic and did take 2 meals of the 4 poor ones off of the tab which we appreciated.  I do not want to put a poor review on YELP but feel you should be aware of the situation at the Mesa site.  We will not return if this is normal operating procedure.  For the record, I tried to post this 8 times on their site to avoid putting it on YELP and just kept getting error messages saying it woudld not go through.  Obviously a sign of what they think about customer service-sadly."}
{"text":"I haven't been to a Carrabba's in years but we went tonight for Father's Day and it was the most amazing meal from start to finish that I have had in a really long time. We got the bruschetta for an appetizer and my husband got the lasagna for his meal and I ordered the seafood cannelloni for mine. The salad was delicious and the lentil sausage soup my husband had was amazing. We decided to keep it going and ordered dessert and coffee- both were fantastic. I forget what it was called but it was the chocolate dream dessert. It was AMAZING! we were so happy we decided to go there. We went home very satisfied."}
{"text":"If you like glass in your dessert, then you'll love this Carraba's. Me and my friend went for dinner a couple nights ago and had a not so great experience. The entrees were fine, but when our desserts came, the first bite I took had a piece of glass in it, and my friend's also had a shard of glass at the bottom of hers. When we brought this to the attention to the management she took down our info, brought out a different dessert. What upset me the most is that the manager didn't seem as concerned about having glass in my food as I was. Working in the restaurant industry myself, I would have definitely shown more concern and taken care of said customer's dinner, no questions asked. Needless to say I was insulted when they only offered me $10 off my bill. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Lasagna tasted like it was purchased from a grocery store freezer section....soup however was great. ..I will come back as I have had better meals here. .."}
{"text":"I always had good experience with this place and after a couple of visits ,I wanted to get my hubby here to try their happy hour menu. We visited early time of happy hour and the bar place is little packed. However we jumped on to the table and ordered some of their sangria's and my husband liked their drink menu.   Also we ordered some appetizers and the service is awesome by their staff.I would definitely recommend this place for groups and parties as they got a private party room which is so cool!!"}
{"text":"Horrible spaghetti and sausage! Marinara sauce was too watery, tasted like water with spices in it...Sausage tasted like cardboard and drank water to get the sausage down my throat...We will never eat here again, a frozen spaghetti dinner would of tasted better than this especially for $16.95 a plate..."}
{"text":"The food is great, service can be pretty slow though. I've come here twice on my lunch break and been late back both times, so that won't happen again. They start you off with delicious bread with oil and vinegar. They have small plate specials for lunch, their meatballs and cheese are delicious as well as their lasagna. On both visits it's taken a good 20-25 minutes for someone to come by with our check after we are done eating, hence why this may not be the best spot for your lunch break. But definitely some yummy Italian food!"}
{"text":"who knew? an amazing and kick-ass Italian restaurant in Phoenix. My cousin was not joking when she said this place rocks.  appetizer that we shared: Shrimp Scampi...delicious in a buttery, garlic, white wine and lemon sauce.  I ordered the Pasta Sostanza - Tagliarini with sautéed mushrooms, artichoke hearts and spinach in tomato basil sauce topped with seasoned breadcrumbs. Out of this world!!! (with shrimp)  My cousin ordered the Pasta Carrabba - Fettuccine alfredo with grilled chicken, sautéed mushrooms and peas.  It was pretty good. :)  Dessert: Sogno Di Cioccolata \"Chocolate Dream\" - A rich fudge brownie, with chocolate mousse, fresh whipped cream and homemade chocolate sauce. Heaven in your mouth!  loooooooooooved this place. service is awesome. portions are gigantic. the place is low key and not fancy-schmancy, it's kind of like going to an Olive Garden - but the food doesn't taste like cafeteria food. :)   I highly suggest this Carrabba's! I am going back for more.   Oh, yeah - there is a gluten-free menu! Awesome!"}
{"text":"We just ate dinner at Carrabba's Italian Grill in Chandler AZ. They were running a special, 1 appetizer, 2 entrees, 1 dessert for $45. Ha d the Tomato Caprese with Fresh Burrata for our appetizer. YUM. Our 2 entrees were the Chicken Bryan...Wood-grilled and topped with goat cheese, sun-dried tomatoes, basil and our lemon butter sauce and a Tuscan-Grilled Sirloin. Both were excellent. We had a choice of soup or salad and a vegetable. The dessert we choose was the SOGNO DI CIOCCOLATA \"CHOCOLATE DREAM\" . I did not try it but my wife said it was very good.       Now for the review of the service. James was our server. He was knowledgeable, attentive and made us feel like we were the only patrons in the restaurant. Our food and drinks were just what we ordered. He checked on us throughout our meal to make sure everything was ok. There are numerous restaurant in the area. Because of James Carrabba's will now be on the top of our list."}
{"text":"Recently dined here for my Abuela's 75th Birthday! The customer service was GREAT - they put up with my crazy family and no one complained about my family either which was good because I could tell some people were getting annoyed with my grandma having our waiter take a billion photos of us hah the food was delicious! I would come back in a heartbeat if my family wanted to!"}
{"text":"Been coming here about every year since 2006 as a way to escape the tourists and enjoy some dining with the locals. This place never disapponts. Different server every time and they've all been excellent - very friendly, professional, and attentive. The food is great as well. Love the deserts.   On hot days or nights, sit outside and and they'll have the misters going so you're not uncomfortable.   I honestly forget I'm in a chain restaurant when I'm in here. It's that good. Will never miss when I'm in town."}
{"text":"I ordered curbside pickup for Mothers Day. My pickup time was 6:20 pm. I pulled up to the restaurant at exactly 6:21 pm and at that time there were 2 bags of food sitting outside on a table. One employee was bouncing between cars and the restaurant dropping off and picking up the bills. After five minutes he picked up one of the bags off the table and brought it to the car next to ours. Next, our bill came and the employee apologized for the wait exclaiming that they've been busier than normal. I told him we understood and he went on his way. At 6:40 (19 minutes after we had arrived) a guy picked up the bag of food that had been sitting for 19+ minutes and hands it to me. I said \"no no no, that has been sitting there since we pulled up twenty minutes ago!\" His response was \"I'll try to be quicker on my feet next time\". And then he ran inside.   By the time we get home our food had sat for 30+ minutes. The food was cold and our appetizer was soggy. It was aweful, a huge waste of money, and a disappointing Mother's Day dinner for my wife, my kids, and myself. I can't imagine any restaurant deeming it acceptable or even safe to serve food under those conditions. We have always loved eating at carrabbas but this experience really rubbed us the wrong way. It is not right or safe to serve people food that has sat for that long. I have made multiple attempts to contact Carrabbas and have yet to receive a response."}
{"text":"Shortest pour of an $8+ glass of wine I have ever seen; barely filled one-third of the glass if that even.  The glass was good size but definitely jipped on the wine.  Everyone at the table noticed it.  Chicken Parm was plentiful and tasty.  Friends said Fettuccini Carraba and Pollo Rosa Maria were very flavorful and enjoyable.  Except for someone needing to learn how to pour a half way decent glass of wine, it was an enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"The Carrabba's that was closer to us in Charlottte closed down last year, so now we find ourselves making the trek to the one in Huntersville when we get a Carrabba's craving!  I know it is a chain, but they do pretty good for an italian chain!  The food/drinks: *Husband always orders the blackberry sangria, while I always order the peach sangria.  Have to get them everytime!  Probably one of my most favorite peach sangrias!  So good, I really could drink a pitcher on my own, but I always just go for the one glass. *I usually get the lasagna, which my only complaint is that it is too small compared to the other pasta dishes which you get a ton of!  Recently though, on their winter menu, they have the Fontina Cavatappi Cream with Chicken which is wonderful!  They need to add that to their menu full time! *My husband usually gets a chicken dish - pollo roso maria, which is amazing.  I used to get this one often, but now that he has switched to this, I still get to have bites and get another dish of my own :) *The meals come with soup/salad and bread with dipping seasonings and oil.  The salad and bread usually fill me up that I don't eat most of my dinner (great for leftovers!).  The seasonings are awesome though, they really need to sell it!  We love Carrabbas and wish their was one closer to us, but I have a feeling more will be on their way out as more local places start to pop up."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch. Was greeted and seated once I walked in. Started of with the house bread. Served warm with an seasoned oil for dipping. For appetizer I had the fried calamari. Was not heavily covered in flour and not greasy. Seasoned well and not over cooked. For lunch it was the lasagne with meat sauce. The pasta was perfect. The meat sauce tasty. Nice and hot all the way through. Great service from the waitress. The food came out fast and good temperature. Since it was lunch, I didn't have that much time. Not a bad place for a quick lunch break."}
{"text":"3 because usually a fan. Best for a chain but worried it's going down hill.  Last carry out order took ages! And last night we dined in. Server, I hope was new. He Didn't let us enjoy our meal. Surrounded us. Yet wasn't good. He knew nothing about wine. We do so don't expect much.  But if I order santa margarita you should know it's a Pinot grio. Also being your most expensive wine. It's not reisling sir. Food was cold yet came out on top of salad. Just eh"}
{"text":"My favorite!   Always stop at a Carrabba's when I come to Vegas. This was my 2nd time at this location and as usual everything was yummy! I always sit at the chefs counter which is really nice because you can see how clean they are. Sometimes you will get a little raviolli or something from the chefs when you sit there!  Love their caesar Yummy bread and herb with oil to dip into Chicken Bryan - a must have Pasta for my side but wish I had gotten veggies because they looked soooo good!"}
{"text":"2nd Carrabba's visit this Vegas trip:   I just love and am addicted to their caesar and chicken bryan! I adore it. I always drag someone to this place if I am visiting Vegas.  We joke that I drive 5 hours for my favorite meal! Service last night was fine but very \"meh\".  It just seemed like she kinda wasn't interested. I don't deduct stars though because she was friendly and on top of things with the exception of forgetting lemon for the waters and tea. Food is always 5 stars and if something doesn't taste rite for some reason I know they are happy to take it back or make something else - I know from experience.  Thanks for making my tummy happy!"}
{"text":"We went to Carrabba's for dinner, we love sitting at the Pasta Bar by the kitchen, and that was where  we were again this time. Our waiter was Kevin, super friendly, we have had him before in the past.  However, we were not as frequent at Carrabba's as we should but he recognized us, and we recognized  him as well. We must say, he was pretty nice, and knowledgeable, great smile. As we were sitting there,  Jay (assuming he's a manager there, always by the kitchen managing the food) brought over a sample of  the appetizer. Plus he was also very friendly. You can tell that both Jay and Kevin are very genuine. We  love being there, it was like being at our family kitchen. We got to watch the interaction of the staff  members in the kitchen and all the wait staff, you know this is a good place to be. then our food came  out, my fiancé was in heaven, because Trevor the grill master that night did a  perfect/wonderful/awesomest job on his steak, since my fiancé is very picky on the steak, as am I.  Please give a big kudos to Trevor! We had never been disappointed when we come here. Then at the  end, as we saw some dishes came out, we started to ask Jay what they were. A few seconds later, Jay  surprised us with a small dish so we could try. WOW!! We were wowed by Jay!! Thank you so much!!  You guys have a great staff here. We will definite come back more often, because you all treated us like a family. Thank you for being YOU."}
{"text":"2 stars, really? I don't know about that. I have been going to this location for 3 years on a regular basis and have only had a couple of bad experiences, which the manager taken care of to my complete satisfaction. Wood Fired pizzas are great! Chicken  Rosa Maria #2 Favorite. Super rich lasagna. Fresh ingredients. Go get you some!~"}
{"text":"The worst...wish we could've eaten but we had called ahead for 6:15 seating and waited until 7:10 when I overheard the hostess telling people they weren't seating people for about 45 minutes because the kitchen was short staffed & backed up so that was the last straw - no way we are waiting even longer!!!  Absolutely ridiculous!!!"}
{"text":"Consistently good food. Stay away from the ravioli as unlike Carrabba's other pastas, it is frozen and not made fresh. The Sicilian Chicken soup is amazing as are the grilled chicken dishes. There is so much good about this place, I could go on a while. The desserts in the shot glasses that taste like they've been sitting for a week and the bland iced tea are my only complaints.  The Chicken Rosa Maria (?) is amazing! Hit and miss for how good it is. Varies from good to great depending on the chef."}
{"text":"The great service at this Market Street location has made us regulars. We had a shrimp dish the other evening, at the Server's recommendation.  It was amazing. As we were boxing up the leftovers, the chef came up to our table with more shrimp. He said he thought the first batch was overdone. We hadn't even complained about it because it was so delicious.  The servers and chefs seem take great care in making sure your experience is positive.  How refreshing!!"}
{"text":"Carrabba's is my favorite place to eat. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I don't think it's authentic Italian food, but it's still much closer to that than Olive Garden. Actually, I prefer this place to authentic Italian restaurants sometimes. My family and I eat here all the time.   The food is so tasty, and is cooked well. The wait staff is always gracious, and the restaurant has a nice, dim lighting, and is clean. For some reason, the last time I went, ALL of the cloth napkins were super dusty. But other than that, I don't have any complaints."}
{"text":"Ate here as a late night meal while I was in Phoenix for a race. It was suggested by the concierge at our hotel. The food was decent a but overpriced for the quality but the ambience was mellow and nice. As you can see from my review... it was a pretty bland experience, but not bad."}
{"text":"This restaurant offers many different selections of foods for the family that can't agree on what they want (e.g., seafood, pasta, steak). The menu offers both moderately priced and expensive menu items.  I had a glass of Coppola pinot noir with my dinner priced at $10.90 for a glass. This is a little pricey for the amount of the pour, but it went great with my meal. I had a fresh salad prior to my lasagne priced at $15.79. The lasagna was good. We were offered a couple refills of bread with their special herbed oil.  I had a pleasurable and relaxing meal two nights ago. Ask for Michael - he was an awesome and very knowledgeable server."}
{"text":"Carrabba's is great for picky eaters and chain fans who don't love local flavor. You know you'll get exactly what you had last time and there will be no surprises. I usually steer clear of chain restaurants, but not everyone loves local food. Carabba's has good solid service, decent food, and decent wine. It's a tad salty for my taste, but it won't keep me from returning with our 'out of towners' who trust the brand and love the product!"}
{"text":"I love vising Carrabba's on amore Monday's you get a 3 course meal for an affordable price. My husband and I have been here 3 times on Monday's for their special and we are never disappointed. The server's are super friendly and we had one 2 of the times we visited. She was very attentive and even remembered us and the conversation we had the time before about my husband not eating sweets and me not eating seafood. The food here is amazing the cook on my steak is always perfect once they did made my steak medium instead of med well and they chef brought it back out re-fired and apologized for the mix up. Its a nice casual environment and every course does not disappoint.  I can't believe it took us 3 years to try this place it was truly our loss! It's hard to find quality food and service and to add at an affordable price."}
{"text":"For a chain, this place is amazing!  Have been coming for years and love absolutely everything on the menu.  Good wine selections and atmosphere too!"}
{"text":"Glad my teeth are still OK! Never coming back!!   Ordered Take Out. Two pasta make your own meals.    Two rigatoni meals with the sugar rosa sauce.  There was hardly any sauce.  I also ordered one side of shredded mozzarella for my pasta. They brought me that cheap powder parmigian cheese. I asked again for shredded mozzarella and got real shredded parmigian. Which the manager swore to the take out lady it was mozzarella. The third time, finally I got shredded mozzarella.  Now for the worst part.    I bit into some hard pea sized mystery thing that was hiding in my pasta, the thing didn't break.  What a terrible thing to find inside a piece of pasta, while your expecting something soft!! I was so disgusted, I couldn't finish my meal."}
{"text":"Always so delicious. Friendly staff. They do a great job offering a good variety on the kids menu, and the menu itself kept my 3 year old occupied through our whole dinner."}
{"text":"I could not love the lemon butter sauce any more than I possibly do.  I only regret that I have to eat pasta with it.  CHICKEN BRYAN was my pre-vegetarian go-to dish, and I still lust over it when I see someone else eating it.  I've had it a ton of times, and it's always incredibly dry, but they make up for it with the tasty marinade, the goat cheese and sundried tomatoes, and the delicious lemon butter sauce.  Ask for extra sauce; you'll want it!  I am happy to see a recent menu addition of chicken bryan pizza.   The spice mix served with the complimentary bread is amazing, and I appreciate that they are always accomodating of my request for butter with the bread (instead of oil)."}
{"text":"Best italian food chain. We always go here hungry and leave happy. They have some of the best bread, their salads are super fresh and their entree's are great. I always get the pasta carraba, and it is always phenomenal. The chicken is amazing and the delicious fettuccine Alfredo pasta goes perfectly with it. Also our waitress was very good and pleasant which made the sitting all the better. Hit up this location if you want a great experience."}
{"text":"Buon giorno!   If your looking for casual night out and great Italian food, this is the place to go. The atmosphere is fun and upbeat, prices affordable. I gave this a 4 star because on this day our service was just OK. Normally they are on top of things, everybody is entitled to a bad day right.? So don't miss out give it a try! Awarded Analynn's :)"}
{"text":"Been here once or twice before, I remember liking it for the most part. This time I got the Chicken Parmesan Panini. Very good, very tasty. Endless bread and oil to start you off, don't fill up on it though. You'll have no room for dinner. Hahah.   Worth the money? Yep.  Service was fantastic. Damon was our server, best service I've had in a while. He was extremely friendly, immediately gauged that we were a \"fun\" table and had a good time messing around with us, and vice versa. Always good to have a laugh with the waiter, and it never hurts the tip amount , either. ;)   Anyways, very good experience overall. Would definitely recommend to any friend looking to have a nice, decently priced meal with good customer service."}
{"text":"This has been our go to place for meals when we decide to not cook lately. Service has always been fantastic and the meals spot on. This place has some of the friendliest servers. Favorites include the Spaghetti Bolognese, Sausage and Lentil soup and a new pasta dish Linguine Positano which has wood-grilled chicken, crushed tomatoes, garlic, olive oil and basil.  Love that they also have curbside pick up."}
{"text":"Not really into chain Italian but my husband for some reason has a soft spot for this place so we ended up here on a Friday night. Let's just say the smell can make you about face as it smells like a pile of rotten cheese (it's fresh cheese I guess). I was sooo turned off by the smell that it took me about 15 minutes to regroup and look over the menu. Once I looked over the menu I did find a scallop and shrimp pasta dish in which I ordered, my daughter ordered the chicken Alfredo and my hubby the Chicken Bryan with green beans as the side and we all had salad before our meal. As we awaited the arrival of our dishes we indulged in an order of cheese sticks which were good just a little too greasy for my blood but of course my teenager LOVED THEM and all the GREASE.. We also enjoyed the bread with the olive oil and herbs YUM.  Shortly thereafter our food arrived and after saying grace we all dug in. Everyone looked extremely happy except ME, my pasta was on the lines of Raviolli O's in a can the taste was bland and the presentation just as bland. Our server was very involved and concerned with the look on my face after I dug in and asked if I was okay and I shared my thoughts. He brought back the menu and told us that we can keep the meal and I can order something else. We declined on keeping the dish as we all thought it sucked but I quickly said I'll have the Chicken Bryan with green beans like my hubby was having.  Can I say ISH on here? Well if so that dish was the ISH .. You can taste the grill on the chicken and the goat cheese was a perfect topper and the sautéed beans were just perfect as a compliment.. Other than the smell and the fact that someone swiped our 2015 in the parking lot I would say the meals we had were great."}
{"text":"My family and I love coming here. This location is the best. We've eaten here 50 plus time but today was extra great. We had a horrible frustrating day and decided to head to our favorite Italian restaurant. Steven our server and all the staff was awesome. So kind, patient and efficient. Not only was our meal fantastic as usual but our day was saved and ended happily. Nothing better than their pasta Carrabba and great service. Thanks so much!"}
{"text":"Service was great. The server was very friendly and knowledgable. Soup was pretty good. For the entrees i had the  Pollo Rosa Maria Stuffed with fontina and prosciutto, topped with mushrooms and a basil lemon butter sauce. Really great dish. My friend karlee had the manicotti. She liked it. We also had this chocolate bread pudding. I have to admit it was good as well even though im not a huge chocolate fan."}
{"text":"Good food. Better than average for a chain restaurant. The portions on some of the meals could be a bit bigger. Prices were reasonable for the meals. Definitely an upgrade to Olive Garden, Claim Jumper and the chains alike. Great service staff. Attentive and sharp. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this will probably be the last chance I give this place. I was so loyal. Portion portions portions! The portions have gone incredibly down yet the prices have gone up. Unbelievable. I used to come here for the chicken Cesar salad and a few years back it was a great portion. I would finish and be nice and satisfied. Today I tried the Parmesan crusted chicken salad and I was brought something that was the size of s dinner salad with a skinny piece of chicken. Finished it quickly and ate the rest of my kids dinner. I'm so irritated with this place. I used to love tuis place so much. Stingy greedy corporate management. I'm disgusted. $15.00 for a damn salad and I'm leaving hungry!!! Hate it. Thanks for nothing!"}
{"text":"We hadn't been to Carrabba's in years and had forgotten how good the food is. Everything came out hot and fresh.  The best part of our dinner was the service. From the hosts that greeted us at the door and chatted with us to our server Cody, everyone was so friendly!  We're locals and lately it seems like every time we visit a casual restaurant chain we get terrible service. Even though it was a busy night we still got plenty of attention from Cody and never went without something we needed.  We'll be going back soon and definitely will request him."}
{"text":"I do not typically go to chain restaurants & then yelp 4 stars but I was genuinely impressed with our server (Cliff) and Carrabas kitchen.  I have been doing a food detox as of the first of the year and the waiter AND the kitchen were so accomodating, even going as far as asking if it was OK with me if they could add certain vegetables to my salad I had ordered (they wanted it to look nice and taste good) to make it more filling.. who does that!?  They do!  Went with my bro, his gf, and my hubby and they had a great old-vine Zin (bottles of wine are on special on Wednesdays) and they seemed to enjoy their meal (though my bro thought his veal marsala was a bit smaller than it should be).  We were seated promptly, the staff (Cliff & kitchen guys) was very attentive and I have to give them 4 stars for going above and beyond what chain restaurants usually serve."}
{"text":"Ok I went last night with my family to carrabba's in Concord NC, and let me start by saying it was a horrible experience I'm a regular customers but I don't know what was going on last night in their first we got seated and it took our waiter 15 minutes just come to our table then we ordered the calamari and a chicken bacon flatbread for the appetizers the calamari was so over cook we felt like we eating rubber, and I order from my son chicken strips meal with penne pasta and we found the long piece of hair in the pasta however they apologized and replace his plate but it took 30 minutes to do that then we ordered three plates of chicken Brian which is I usually love in there and after a long wait on that too The plates came out real cold we called the manager and she had the kitchen to remake our meal she apologized and blame it on the kitchen,and for us we ended up with a bad dinner experience."}
{"text":"Beware! We called to ask if it was possible to get a reservation and were told that it was. We asked for 7pm and they confirmed. On arrival at 7pm, we were told that we would have to wait an extra 40 minutes, and that they don't give reservations. We left immediately. I'm not eating somewhere that would make misleading statements to get us to come in."}
{"text":"Funny thing, I lived in Tampa and there was a Carrabba's next door.  Yet, I never once walked in.  However, I noticed one here in Henderson.  So, my wife and I decided to try it out.  We were there at around 5pm (we felt like old people coming at the open -- woo hoo --- yay baby, dining with the old folks home -- i am so bad).  By being there early, the great thing was that the restaurant had lots of tables and lots of waiters to provide excellent service.  Rocking roll man!  Anyways, our waiter was very pleasant and took care of us.  Water was filled, drinks were takened promptly.    We ordered the following dishes: Appetizers -- Calamari and the Brushetta  -- The calamari was a bit smaller than we expected.  However, it tasted very good with their pepper/lemon butter sauce (low fat ... hee hee) -- The bruschette was okay.  By the way, I am not a bruchette fan.  My wife loves it.  So, we have to order what she likes.  Personally, the bread is too hard for my likening.  Instead, I like warm rolls and butter ~ wish more restaurants have honey butter -- oooh la la...  Entree: -- My wife ordered the Shrimp Scampi -- Of course, i tried it too.  I wished they had more shrimp though!  Yes, shrimp was cooked perfectly -- not overdone!  By the way, everytime we dine out, when they bring our meal, my fork is digging into her plate before they even put it down... and vice versa... we just love food.  I can't believe I am not the size of a Michelin Tire Dude now... I just happen to wear dark clothes, a cape, and shift my weight properly.. LOL...!!  -- I ordered the Pasta Weesie... note: I orderd this because of the funky Weesie name.  Sounds like somebody peeing --- like taking a whizz... sometimes, I am so strange.  Back to the dish, it was really good.  I love the afredo sauce (good balance of taste and texture! and the sauteed mushrooms were yummy!).  Now, if they had shrimp AND chicken, it would have been great (kinda like the Macaroni Grille - where you can pick and choose items).  Dessert: We both split a John Cole (basically, ice cream with caramel and some nuts on top -- of course, it is low fat -- just kidding)  Honestly, for a party of two, we kinda ordered a bit too much food.  We had to bring some home for lunch the next day.  For 2 nice size appetizers, 2 main entrees, dessert, and drinks, our meal totals to a bit under $70 (excluding tips).  Overall, we had a pleasant dinner.  I would recommend this place.  In a way, I prefer and do think this is better than the Olive Garden (excluding the salads of course).  We definitely would be back."}
{"text":"We went 3/14/2014 for dinner & was sorely disappointed in our meals..  The full portion chicken entrees we ordered (wood grilled chicken and pollo sorrento) were okay, nothing special, tender but very, very salty  & portion quite small, around 4-5 ounces, .  The house salad accompanying the meal was terrible for this pricey establishment that calls itself Italian....it consisted of mostly or all iceberg lettuce with ONLY a tbsp. of tiny cut shoestring carrots on top and two TEENY olives on the side of plate.  The house creamy parmesan dressing we went with included very fishy anchovies not explained by our waitress.  A very small loaf of plain Italian bread given for two was adequate but tasted ordinary.   For $14 and $17.50 respectively, we will not return to this establishment primarily due to the salad.  For those prices, a hearty house salad with romaine, onions,  tomatoes, cukes & a tad of Italian cheese on top would not be too much to ask for."}
{"text":"The herbs with olive oil and bread are amazing!!  Can't go wrong with chicken parm!"}
{"text":"Came here today with my girlfriend for their happy hour. Haven't been here in a while, but glad we stopped by. Great chicken wings and calamari.  Prices are good, nice environment, and clean restaurant."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good for a chain restaurant. I was pleasantly surprised. The service was really good tho. Prices are mid range and they offer a small portion of many of their plates if your not super hungry."}
{"text":"I love Carraba's! The minestrone soup is the best in the area and is clearly homemade. Service is very attentive. Nice quiet atmosphere which is nice for a good relaxing dinner or for an intimate date."}
{"text":"I took my mom with me to Carrabba's to celebrate a new job because it is her favorite restaurant. We were not disappointed.  When I started to realize that we had been sitting for a few minutes without seeing a server, a manager walked over, apologized for the delay and took our appetizer and drink order.   We started with the delicious bread and then had crab cakes, that were oh-so-yummy. The drinks were delicious and the waiters were amusing. The atmosphere is casually Euro-hip and the open kitchen is always bustling with excitement.   When my Spiedino Di Mare (shrimp, scallops and asparagus) arrived, I was a bit put off by the look of the plate. For about $20, I received a bland plate with soggy yellowing spears of asparagus, 4 medium sized scallops and 4 pieces of stuffed shrimp. Nevertheless, it smelled GREAT.   I dove into the scallops immediately and they seemed to melt deliciously away on my tongue. The stuffed shrimp were had the same basic components - breaded and grilled with a generous lemon butter sauce to swim in.  The manager came over to check on us and I decided the asparagus wasn't too foul of a move since everything else was pleasant, so I didn't tell him. I'm surprised he didn't ask why I hadn't eaten any of the pitiful looking vegetable on the plate, however.  That being said, I love Carrabba's and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty awful. I got the chicken trio, one of the chicken servings was not edible, it was pure tendon and tasted disgusting. There was another that had a bit of an off-putting flavor. The pasta was so bland. Like we are talking worse than a new grad buying dollar penne and store brand tomato sauce from a grocery store bad... we did get a stuffed mushroom app that was pretty good (hence the two stars) but it was small and didn't model the picture in the menu too well. We came here because we wanted Italian food, we got frozen dinner quality food. One perk to picking this place for dinner was that they offer creme brûlée. The creme brûlée was awful, I mean like how do you even serve this. It was liquid, not creamy or custard like, liquid. We complained and were told they would fix it and when she returned she just said they are all going to be like this, do you want something else? No we didn't want anything else, we wanted the creme brûlée... so they took the brûlée off the bill and that was it. No apology from the manager ( who was literally sitting on the other side of the partition from us)"}
{"text":"I ordered the lobster ravioli. What I got was chunks of lobster shell (felt like cartilage) lodged in my ravioli. That was fun. Never going back =/"}
{"text":"The food at Carrabba's is rarely a disappointment, and at this location it is no different. The service we received from our waiter Matt was absolutely great. He is truly one of the best servers I have ever had at any restaurant. The food was nice and delicious, and although it was extremely busy we got everything in a timely manner, and never needed for a refill."}
{"text":"Went in around 9pm for a late dinner. The hostess was very friendly and sat us right away. We had Justin as our server and he was great! He had full knowledge of the menu and had great suggestions that were delicious. He was attentive and friendly. Definitely ask for Justin when you go in. I ordered the calamari and it was pretty good! Kind of greasy but it was fried so eh. But it was good. Definitely will come back."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants ! Pricey but worth it for special occasions such as birthdays or anniversaries. They provide bread and make you a wonderful and tasty plate with Olive oil and spices . So good! I normally order from the grill menu. I have had the shrimp from the grill (wonderful) , the halibut soaked in a lemon butter (my FAVORITE) , chicken Alfredo, and I also have had the steak. I have never ever had a bad meal here or bad service . I normally order a glass in a half of the Santa margarita Pino Grigio another one of my favorites and the chocolate moose for dessert! The perfect  ending to a perfect meal! Bon appetite!"}
{"text":"Meh...it's a chain. Went in with family on a Friday evening. Not busy. Good service, blah overpriced food. Quality food, just boring, with the exception of the flatbread appetizer. That was tasty. If you want good Italian classics, go to Bella Luna instead."}
{"text":"We live in CA, go to AZ for Spring Training every year and have been seriously wanting to try Carrabba's based on the TV commercials which were spot on. The food looked as good as it does on TV and it tasted amazing. It'll definitely be on our list of places to eat at when we're in AZ."}
{"text":"I dont know about you but this has been the food with the greatest flavor ever i was so happy and satisfied with everything we had to wait a lot but its ok and its a bit pricy but its ok too you know when u have food that delish haha def would love to come back and taste some more of there delish food"}
{"text":"This is hands down our favorite restaurant. We have been going here for years. It's a great place to take your family and a great place to go on a date. They have a great menu with everything from calamari and soups to pizza, steaks and lamb chops."}
{"text":"I seriously love this place! We go to Carrabba's Italian Grill at least twice a month, and that's on the low end. I highly recommend any of the Marsala dishes: steak, chicken or pork. We have searched high and low for another Marsala dish that comes somewhat close to Carrabba's and NO ONE can touch it!   They also have other delicious dishes like the Tag Pic Pac (what I normally get), and their house salad dressing is very good too. The staff is very friendly and willing to accommodate any order.   The only reason that I gave this four stars instead of five is because they don't take reservations.  Love it!"}
{"text":"I hadn't been here in years and it was much better than I remember. The manicotti was excellent, great salad, good bread, and great service. Good atmosphere. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because the portions (although plenty) are not what you would get at most italian restaurants in this price range."}
{"text":"I've been to every location in AZ, and Glendale is my personal favorite.  Awesome restaurant with a really special staff.  I've been a regular here for years, and have never had a bad experience.  In the rare event that a mistake happens, servers and management are quick to fix the issue.  The food is really quite special (I have yet to find a Caesar dressing I like more), and the atmosphere is very comfortable.  If you're having trouble deciding what to order, consider any of the following:  *Calabrian Roasted Wings (ask for some extra gorgonzola dipping sauce) *Mussels in White Wine Lemon Butter (perfect for dipping the complimentary bread!) *Sausage and Lentil Soup (everyone raves about the Sicilian Chicken Soup, but I'm telling you, the Sausage and Lentil is amazing) *Chicken Marsala *Chicken Bryan *Pollo Rosa Maria *sautéed spinach (as a side, but they serve it with sautéed garlic as well and it's really good!)  And as stated above, the Caesar salad (I usually opt for adding chicken) is among the best you'll find.  I usually add sun-dried tomatoes and goat cheese to mine.  Carrabba's is always my go-to spot.  Hope to see you there!"}
{"text":"Good was good! It was close to mind blowing good! BUT ITS VERY EXPENSIVE! sadly the portions are small so it's almost not worth it! The chicken in the chicken Alfredo is so good I can almost taste the wood it was cooked on! Didn't love the oil crap they give you with the bread & I wished the served baked ziti but I would definitely go back! Not on a budget or if I was starving! It's a step up from the Olive Garden!"}
{"text":"A couple of days ago my mom and I were there to have a lunch. We were sat down at a booth close to the kitchen, and we were greeted by Paisely. She took our drink order and then Tyler delivered our drinks to us. He explained that Paisley was in the middle of shift change and that he would be our waiter. Okay that's cool. He was way better than Paisley anyway. While I was facing the kitchen area, mom was facing the dining area. 1) We both noticed Paisley was not on shift change. 2) She was constantly on her cell phone. 3) The patrons a few tables away from us apparently gave her a $7 tip, which I would love to be tipped $7.00. Paisley ran up to her co-worker and actually complained about it. How ungrateful! 4) She was very chatty Kathy with the co-worker she complained about the $7 tip to. Actually, she barely even worked after her \"shift change\". Mom and I don't eat at Carrabba's very often, but we've never experienced anything like that before. I hope the next time I come back in that Paisley won't be my waitress. As a manager myself, I wouldn't let my employees present themselves like that in front of patrons."}
{"text":"Went early on Wednesday 5:15 so no wait which was good. Hadn't eaten here in some time--  remembered it was kinda spendy but forgot how much higher.  Hubby and I split spaghetti Bolonaise.  Taste good but salad was rusty which is always a turnoff.  VERY noisy place between progressive jazz kitchen and crowd  probably won't eat here for a while."}
{"text":"We've been here a couple of times and enjoyed it, but the last time we were there the food was really bad. I ordered calamari and it was tougher than chewing on rubber bands. It was also extremely greasy. My wife order a combination meal and the server told us they were pretty large portions and when the plate came out, we were devastated to see such small portions that you almost need a magnifying glass to find it. Needless to say it was pitiful. I don't think we will be returning any time soon. Even Olive Garden and Macaroni Grill is far superior than this place and that's not saying a whole lot. Anyways can you tell I was pretty disappointed. The only salvation for this place was their tiramisu...It was pretty good."}
{"text":"The $10 coupon is no longer valid.     It redirects to the website and wants you to sign up for their mailing list. :(.  I liked the Chicken soup.  I didn't care for the bread with the oil/spice mix.  Toss some butter at me, please.  My meal was ok.  I loved the chicken but picked out the tomato chucks from my sauce on the noodles.    I would have preferred a blended sauce, I think over the large chunks.  Overall, I will try here again.  It's not Olive Garden (my favorite) but the soup will bring me back to try another entree.. :)"}
{"text":"Carrabba's is my favorite place to go when I feel like being fancy. The free bread with the oil and vinegar is awesome, I try and get as much as I can every time. The portions are great size and you'll love whatever you try every time you go."}
{"text":"I've visited this establishment multiple times. I do not know what has happened lately. I ordered lunch for 2 it came up to $80.00 ok the Alfredo sauce was like water (basically they used milk a little bit of cheese and butter). All he could comp me was some more Alfredo. Save your money and try a local Italian spot. They've really dropped the ball at this spot!!"}
{"text":"By far one of my favorite restaurants! I love the shrimp scampi!!! its amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Always solid , NEVER disappoints us. I try something new all the time and I know they will deliver ! Try it , they won't let you down."}
{"text":"We stopped by here for lunch.  I will say it was good.  We ordered calamari, minestrone and sausage and lentil soups.  That stuff was good and I really liked it.  The bread with the olive oil and spice was good too.  The server did a fantastic job also.  I like this place and will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Time of a good quick and no BS review of this place I have been to before.   What can I say this place is really good.  The service has always been fantastic too.  We came here after watching a movie up the street.  There were four of us with all different sorts of taste.  My meal was the following.  A cup of the sausage and lentil soup.  Which is the bomb by the way.  I make a similar soup but add prosciutto also.  My main lunch was the Pollo Rosa Maria.  It was good.  They went back to the old way of preparing it by stuffing the ham or prosciutto inside of the chicken breast.  It had good flavour and it was really fresh.  The kavatapi pasta was good too. This place has good separation over other Italian chain places here.  I am not sure what it is, but it does separate it self a lot."}
{"text":"I'm not really a snob when it comes to chain restaurants, so I won't be too harsh.  Food is edible. Service is accomodating, and all in all...it's not bad.  I popped in here with my folks for a little Father's Day dinner. The host promptly seated us, and gave us a nice spot.  I ordered the 8 Vegetable Lasagna. I figure after all this sobriety, the least I can do is treat myself to a nice filling meal. It was delicious. I'm usually not a fan of tomato based sauces, mostly because of the acidity, but this was nicely balanced.  Again, I'm not being too harsh, because over the years, my standards for chain spots have gone down.   Bathrooms are clean. Parking is plentiful.  One thing I would like to point out. They are only open till 9PM on Sundays...but you dont have to feel weird about coming in just before they close. The staff is still warm and friendly, and they don't rush you. In fact, the restaurant was still quite busy when we left (10PM or so).  Huge plus in my book. This kind of service makes up for the fact that this is a chain, and the food isn't particularly unique. But it was good. I suppose that's all that matters."}
{"text":"We made a reservation here for two on a week night. When we got there the we gave our name and the hostess said it should be about 10-20 minutes. We honestly waited about 45-50 before we went to the hostess and told her we were leaving she just said \"name?\" We gave it and she said \"ok have a good night.\" I know this is a chain restaurant but we were pretty disappointed. Maybe we will try another location but so far we have a bad taste in our mouth from that experience."}
{"text":"As much as I told myself I wouldn't make a big deal out of this, my visit here starting with the waiter accidentally spilling his water pitcher onto my table and bench, which quickly absorbed itself into my jeans and sneakers.  I will say that the water was ice cold, and sometimes you get luke warm water, but this was very very cold water, so thank you for that.  His attitude about it was apologetic and he did his best to make it a pleasant visit after that, but you really can't do much about soggy bottom jeans and squishy sneakers.  Food was as you would expect from a Carrabba's and this experience won't keep me from coming back.  Atmosphere was nice, but unfortunately we were near a door and it was blustery and cold outside, so speaking as a man sitting in wet clothing, it was a chilling wake up every time the door opened."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Good service. We love the Chicken Bryan. Usually a wait. Prices keep going up, but that's maybe more of a political issue...."}
{"text":"Always come here hungry and leave stuffed.  The primary motivation for driving as far as I do to dine here is the Sangria.  The red kind.  Today my GF and I branched out and ordered the the Blackberry Sangria.  Upon it's arrival my GF noticed a strange fungus like sheen on one of the Blackberry that was placed a garnish in my GF's glass.  I snatched up the first employee I saw and told them to get my waiter or the manger to our table ASAP!  The manager arrived, I was pissed and he took away the Blackberry in question.  He came back and told me that is not fungus but some discoloration of the berry.  He told me that the drinks would be taken care of.  Switched glasses with the my GF and continued on with my meal.  My meal consisted of the Pasta Rambo (like name) with lobster.  When I tasted GF's Pasta Weesle, I wish that I would have ordered that instead.  When we received the bill it was reviled that the manager had lied to me about \"taking\" care of the Sangria.  Not looking for any kind of damn handout just don't stand there and lie to me.  Later."}
{"text":"First time there today  had the best waiter  Joel they took care of everything app zucchini fritas awesome. Ceasar salad excellent my wife a personal chef had the lobster ravioli  she said was the best she has tasted  definitely going to be a regular now"}
{"text":"Usually very good, I think we caught Carrabbas on an off night. Even so the food was excellent. The service however was pretty bad.   3 epic service fails in one night!  Dinner with wife. Very nice food. Pleasant but terrible service.  Fail 1. Never brought out bread. By the time we had ordered, been served and eaten appetizer we realized it wasn`t coming. So we were to forced to ask for it. We were told that it would take 7 minutes. It came up when we  eating our entrees.  Fail 2. Both of our entrees  came out, server never asked if we wanted Parmesan on them. I had Veal Marsala  and wife had pork chops. Both of us would have liked Parmesan, but were never asked.  Fail 3. And for me the biggest epic fail was bringing up the bill when I was less than halfway through my entree. Never asked if we wanted dessert or anything just brought up the bill without being asked.  As I said shame because the food was great.  Update . Carrabbas contacted me very quickly and apologized. Problem dealt with in a very courteous manner. Kudos to them."}
{"text":"The best chicken marsala, ask for extra marsala sauce. Waitress Kate was the best, ask for her. Even though busy on a Saturday night, she was very attentive."}
{"text":"In any restaurant, the bathroom will tell you everything you need to know about the kitchen. My mom and I ordered our drinks and went to wash our hands, and the bathroom was filthy. Not only was it messy, but you can clearly see the mold growing in the creases and drain pipe of the sink. Getting dirty water glasses was the cherry on top. We left without ordering anything. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I try not to write reviews about chains, but hey, the food is good, service was great, and all for a decent price.  If you go on Amore Mondays you can get an app, soup or salad, and an entree for $12.99."}
{"text":"Very great atmosphere, the fresh hot bread and the olive oil with garlic spice is delicious. The Penne Franco and the Wessie are so awesome. There homemade orange soda is definetly the drink u want to get. You can sit at the pizza bar and watch pizzas be made while you eat. The atmosphere is somewhat romantic and family style. This place a way better than going to Olive Garden!!!"}
{"text":"This place is Olive Garden with darker lighting, but more expensive and not as flavorful. Just buy a cheap can of spaghetti sauce, boil some pasta and stay home instead. Our server was nice and attentive, so I added a star."}
{"text":"Went with the hubby on a Saturday night and it was packed! We found a spot open at the bar, so we sat there no problem. They had a happy hour menu so I ordered off of that for the appetizers. We got chicken lettuce wraps (came in 3, wish it would have been at least 4 so we could get 2 each.) We also got bruschetta which was pretty tasty. I didn't like the free bread you get with your meal only because it has tapenade in it and I personally don't like olives, but my husband loved it. I ordered a soup and salad, my husband got a salad and added chicken. Both were good. The wine I had was tasty. Service was great. Our waitress was super nice. I will definitely be back next time I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I don't get what all the hype is about this restaurant? I mean, the bread with the special dipping oil was good but not outstanding.  The salad was forgettable and the fettuccine Alfredo with chicken was edible.  It's a good place for families as the food is inexpensive and the service is good."}
{"text":"I must agree with other reviewers, it is also my favorite chain restaurant. Large seating area so our party of 4 were seated right away. Started with their signature Sicilian chicken soup (highly recommend). My pork tenderloin was cooked perfectly and quite delicious. Good variety of menu choices (besides Italian food) means that I'll be back for another good meal."}
{"text":"wow,  where to begin with the debacle!!   i have been here a few times,  and its ok,  but i rolled in last nite with the misses and every aspect of this place was TERRIBLE.  the hostess ignored us for 2 minutes while she complained to a server about haow hard it is to do her job and keep everyone happy. so after listening to that, and smelling her overwhelming cheap perfume, we were led to a table, in a less then half full dining room.  she dropped the menus and ran off,  didnt say enjoy or who our server will be or anything.  shortly after a server walked by and said 'be right with you',  didnt say welcome, my name is--- or anything.  4 minutes rolled past and he came back, and again , no pleasentries at all,  just asked what we wanted to drink and if we were ready to order.  so we both ordered our entrees, read and sounded very tasty on the menu.  drinks and bread came,  h epoured the olive oil over the herbs, but of course didnt explain what it was,  salads came shortly after (no fresh cracked pepper offered).  my ice tea ran empty, so i puched it to the edge of the table so the server could see it,  he waled past 3 times and didnt notice,  so i had to eventually ask for a refill. he came back to clear the salad, plates, again never asked if everything was ok. shortly after the entrees came, and the runner, much like the hostess just dropped and ran. now BOTH of our entrees were stone cold, and we ordered totally different items.  and i dont mean lukewarm, i mean STONE COLD!!!!!!!  so again we waited for 3-4 minutes for our server to roll around and said oh yuour full do you want a box?  this was 4 minutes after we had been served!!!  i sent the food back to be heated,  the manager came over to apologize, and said it was his fault , that he walked away from the line and missed the food going out,  like i want to hear his excuses and what he was doing??  really???!!!  he didnt tell us his name either, and made no eye contact, looked off into space and he recited his apology. the food came back out, and my meat was now warm but the broccoli gratin and risotto with the meat were both cold still.  ate a few bites and asked the server for the check.  i will never go back here, this place has severly gone down hill in ALL ASPECTS. these people were given several attempt to correct the problems and didnt at each juncture.  so we strolled out of there , paying full prive for everything, and sure as hell will never be back!"}
{"text":"Service was great, really friendly. I noticed the manager walking around making sure everyone was having a good time and greeting the guests which is always nice to see. But the food here is just eh. It's a chain, so didn't have high expectations to begin with, but they still disappointed in the flavor department. A little pricey considering the food quality. Went with the shrimp & scallop linguine alla vodka, which boasted \"now bigger shrimp and scallops.\" They definitely are huge, but you only get 3 of each. The sauce was completely unmemorable. Didn't eat much of the pasta. The complimentary bread is great on it's own when it's nice and warm, but seemed like a low quality olive oil they give you to dip it in. Really strange almost chemical flavor.   Their promotion where they give you a free spaghetti/meatball to-go dinner when you order a chicken dish seems insane, but it's definitely a good deal for the customer. My boyfriend loved his chicken marsala and the free spaghetti.   Wouldn't come back to a Carraba's again. Only went for a birthday dinner."}
{"text":"I come here often because the food is always very consistent and flavorful.  However the service here is unpredictable. You will either get a really experienced waiter that is on top of their game or a barely trained young, nervous type waiter that cannot even get the menu straight or remember to bring out your food, or refill drinks. The managers need to train their new staff better, even if that means for longer periods of time. The service is too unpredictable here so I can only give this location 3/5 stars."}
{"text":"Even for a Carrabba's (not a fan), this place rates lower. I've had some forgettable and unforgettable (not in a good way) meals here. I was once served chicken breast that was thoroughly raw in the center. In general there are better places to eat. Try San Nicola's in nearby Paoli or go 2 miles further to Fellini Cafe in Berwyn. Neither are chains and both are far better, and no more expensive, than Carrabba's."}
{"text":"Why say a bunch of stuff we simply love this place is a real Italian delicious dinner it make look Olive Garden like a fast food. So yes we highly recommend this place and we can say wow to this Awesome place. Menu is great, servers are Awesome, Management is so much better than others places the manager went to our table and i was so polite with us that we score this place with A+ in all aspects."}
{"text":"I love Italian food, so my husband brought me here per recommendation from his coworkers.   I thought the food was alright. It wasn't spectacular, but it was good. We started off with a meatball and ricotta flatbread. For entrees we had chicken Bryan and fried shrimp and scallops with pasta. Our appetizer was good, but the entrees fell a little flat. The winner for the evening was our dessert: vanilla raspberry custard. I've never had custard before, but I'll always remember this one. The custard was not overly sweet and the raspberries were fresh and ripe. They melted in my mouth and were perfect with the custard.  The service was good. Our server was very attentive. He refilled our drinks quickly and always came back to ask how our meal was.  I would come back for the good service, but I definitely need to try more from the menu."}
{"text":"I went into here thinking it was a Macaroni Grill or some other chintzy Italian chain. But I was actually surprised. I got the Tag Pic Pac which is pasta, basil, garlic, tomatoes, and I added chicken. Very fresh and delicious - again, I was surprised. It was a Friday night and pretty packed, and we got our food in a reasonable amount of time. My only beef was the service could have been a bit better. Got food before utensils and we had the hunt the guy down for the check.  But food wise, pretty good."}
{"text":"Place was very classy Christina was our waitress and  service was great she never let this soda go dry not a long wait on a Friday night prices were extremely affordable for the quality of food and the atmosphere people were friendly food was tremendous have nothing but good things to say i've never been to this place you really need to give it a try it really looks fancy on the outside and very expensive but once again the budget is friendly food is great and people are nice"}
{"text":"This is my first time going to a Carraba's. It's nicer than a Olive Garden and less expensive than Romano's Macaroni Grill. The food was nice and priced right in between. Service was quite attentive."}
{"text":"While dining with my wife and adult daughter my daughter found a hair in her salad. We informed the waiter and asked that the salads be taken away. The waiter said he would inform the manager. The manager was making her rounds at each table and when she arrived at our never mentioned the the problem. It seemed by her nonverbal behavior that she was uncomfortable. We had eaten at this location before and were surprised by how few people were in the restaurant on this occasion.  Perhaps our experience was not unique and the popularity of this location has wained. We will not be dinning there again."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! This is a great neighborhood spot for a family dinner or a date night. :) The crowd is always a nice mix of people, and the atmosphere is very friendly and welcoming.  The staff is really what makes this one of my favorite places -- they are en pointe in every way!!! They really make the experience special, even though it's not an expensive place. They run their customer service show like a well-oiled machine, and it's actually a thrill to just sit and watch how everything moves like clockwork -- from the hostesses who will actually open the door for you, to the servers, to the kitchen staff and the manager conducting the whole symphony. It's all handled in a very professional manner.  The food is also great! It is always fresh and delicious. Everything from the bread, to the pasta, the salad, soups, desserts. It's definitely a place you want to come back to. Oh, and your food always has perfect timing -- you never sit feeling hungry and neglected, yet they don't rush you through your meal, either.   At this Carraba's you really feel you're in a fancy place, but at a fraction of the cost -- it's about the same price as The Olive Garden -- but so much tastier and welcoming -- feels like a mom and pop kind of place.  Have I raved enough??? This is my go-to spot, without question, whenever I am in the mood for Italian. We've been eating here for about two years now and have always left happy and satisfied."}
{"text":"I've honestly never had such awful experiences anywhere else like I have had with this place. I'm not sure what's going on here. It used to be a fine place to go. But now the wait staff is slow, and the management is terrible. The food takes forever and taste like frozen food. I'd highly suggest taking a look at your management at this location. There seems to be MAJOR communication issue at this store that is more than noticeable. Will not be coming back to this establishment ever."}
{"text":"We have eaten here about a dozen times in the last two years.  The service is always good and the quality of the food is good for the price.  We usually split the Sirloin Marsala and order a extra salad.  That is enough for both of us after we have bread with it.  The atmosphere is nice and it is always clean.  We take our four teenage girls and they always want to sit at the bar seats near the pizza oven.  I have found that sometimes we are treated to \"samples\" when we sit there.  Always a good experience!!"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. Went to celebrate my moms 86th birthday. Service was slow the appetizer came and they basically gave us the wrote one. Came back with the right one and forgot the sauce we request.  10 minutes later and two more requests later the sauce arrived and the appetizer was to cold to eat. We ordered a dish without garlic and they said no though when we came in they said they make everything from scratch...obviously not. We ordered three more dishes without garlic after our waiter said they had no garlic only to come back to say oops they did. So, my husband didn't eat   My mothers food was awful as was mine.    Not a place to go EVER"}
{"text":"My husband and I chose this restaurant because it was steps away from our hotel and we were pleasantly surprised at how good it was. We started with the calamari and it was a huge but perfectly cooked portion. I had a peach sangria and it was light and fruity. My husband had a sirloin and chicken combo and I ordered the chicken trio. We both started with the Caesar salad and it was perfect. The dressing was light and full of flavour and the romaine crisp and fresh. My husband was in a food coma after finishing off his generous portion but I could barely manage a few bites after the starter and salad. What I did manage to force down was delicious. Just prior to leaving another waitress brought me another portion of chicken and box. Apparently they were unhappy with the previous portion I had already received and wanted to ensure I was completely satisfied.  All in all it was a great meal. Our server, Montana, was delightful, had impeccable timing and definitely earned a star herself."}
{"text":"Sometimes I enjoy the food here but seems like the more I come the less I enjoy it. Eh, what's a brother to do?  It isn't my first choice anymore when I go out. Sucks because the lady likes this place."}
{"text":"I always love coming here ryan the bartender is amazing. Always running around and making people happy. Recommend asking for him everytime."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for the first time on our 5 year wedding anniversary.  Our amazing server was Robbie.  He did an excellent job providing us with incredible service and truly making our experience here a great one.  On top of that, the food was unbelievable.  My wife had the crusted chicken and I had the chicken parmigiana.  We tried the small dishes as well, and every bite was delicious!  We will definitely be returning, especially for the house bread and oil!!!"}
{"text":"Our first time here.  The service is phenomenal.  Food was a very good and we just really enjoyed ourselves.  Great place for date night."}
{"text":"I would give a zero start if it would give the chance to do so .  We had  extremely disgusting situation in this restaurant that we used to love and to take  an Italian dinner once a while but after that night  when we had an order for four people that I took   Them 55 minutes to serve the order and after that it was all wrong input .  That did not stop in being late serving but it was  served by an dripping sweat waiter that we can abvouisly see that in top of the served food . Excuse my description but that no one can be able to see that and can still have any kind of appetite .  We left the restaurant after an complain to the manager hoping that can be no happening with other people definitely not for us because we will not be back  ."}
{"text":"The Filet Marsala is the best. Always a great dish and the side of mashed potatoes is a must. As a chain about as good as it gets and it's clean with friendly staff"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service here.  Came for lunch today and was surprised at how good the food is.  I've never been a big fan of chain restaurants but Carrabba's changed my mind.  My friend and I started out with the tomatoes caprese and the shrimp diavolo.  The tomatoes and mozzarella were so fresh and flavorful.  The shrimp diavolo had a lightly breaded texture that was oozing with delicious flavor.  Seriously some of the best appetizers I've had in a long time.  Even the lentil soup was phenomenal.  Had spicy sausage chunks and lentils in a thick, tasty broth.  We both got the fettuccine weesie for our main course and ended up taking doggy bags home.  Lots of shrimp and mushrooms on top of a bed of fettuccine in a white wine sauce.  It had the right amount of flavor without being too salty or overly strong with one ingredient.  Our waiter, Brian, was attentive and friendly without being overbearing.  A wonderful lunch and dining experience!"}
{"text":"Our first visit to Carrabba's was a good one. 5 of us went for lunch. They have some reasonably priced lunch specials (like pizza with soup or salad and 1/2 sandwich with soup or salad).  The calamari appetizer was very good, some of the best calamari I've had in quite some time. Their sausage and lentil soup was also a highlight. Good atmosphere and service. I'd avoid the fried zucchini, both people who got that as a side thought they were mushy.  Overall a good experience and good food.  I would go often if there were any in California."}
{"text":"Carrabbas is the spot for a delicious meal and great service. Both are top notch. Favorites of mine include lentil and sausage soup, capris style salad, calamari with marinara,  spaghetti and meatballs and last but not least the lobster raviolis. This place is direct competition to olive garden, but if you ask me, Carrabbas all the way! The bread is so good too, they serve it with olive oil and herbs shortly after being seated along with the drinks. You are missing out if you've never been. Oh yeah, you can watch all the action in the kitchen from your seat at the table because it's an open kitchen and entertaining to watch as if your at a iron chef competition. Bon Apetit at Carrabbas!"}
{"text":"Let me first start off saying that I LOVE Carraba's. I know that it is a chain, but as a chain goes it goes out of it's way to fool your taste buds into thinking that you are actually eating artfully prepared Italian cuisine at a more casual and affordable atmosphere. They will tailor to your requests for your food to be prepared a certain way, even if it isn't on the menu. I prefer to have a steak, but the Steak Bryan, which is a filet, or a another cut of steak with their special goat cheese, basil, and sun dried tomato on top. Another worthy mention is their grilled chicken dishes. Too many places love to over cook chicken then flavor it after the fact, but at Carrabba's you know they marinate them which keeps them juicy.  I am sorry that Matt had a bad review on service, because I will tell you that they have FABULOUS service. Every place has their bad nights, but this particular Carrabbba's knows how to treat their customers. We visited one night and they forgot our appetizer. We were in a hurry and we told them to not worry about it, but in return they apologized profusely and gave us a coupon for a free appetizer for the next visit and a free desert. When we arrived home, my 3 year old daughter had left her small puzzle there and my husband went back to retrieve it, but it was gone. It wasn't a big deal, but a few days later, the manager (I think owner as well) James called us at home to again apologize and said that he had bought some puzzles and that when we came in again to ask for them. I was speechless, and had never had such wonderful customer service. We went in and he gave us not just one, but four puzzles, and of course made sure that everything went to our liking. I cannot recommend this location enough and have told my friends and family of our experience.  WONDERFUL location, GREAT service, and FABULOUS food!"}
{"text":"Great service and delicious meal!  This location of Carrabba's provides a great dining experience for all.  We were greeted and seated immediately.  Our waiter was over in a flash.  He was over the top attentive for our entire meal.  He had many many wonderful suggestions and opinions which helped us choose our meals.  He brought out the complimentary bread with oil and vinegar for dipping.    I chose the Mahi Wulfe. This was a wonderful seafood dish.  The mahi was lightly breaded topped with artichokes, sun-dried tomatoes and lemon butter sauce.  The combination of ingredients gave this fish a great flavor and would definitely order again.  This also had the mashed potatoes on the side which were good but nothing too exciting.  With the entrees, you can choose soup or salad.  I went with the caesar salad.  This had just enough dressing with a perfect blend of cheese and croutons.  When he asked if I'd like more of the freshly grated parmesan, of course! I can't say no to more cheese.    We truly had a wonderful dinner here.  I'd come back again for sure!"}
{"text":"I like Carrabba's food, but this location on Clearview in Mesa leaves much to be desired. The interior is in desperate need to be remodeled. It looks old and tired. There was a noticeable odor to the place when you first walk in. It smelled like dirty mop. The smell was most noticeable on the way to the bathroom where you should smell aromas from the kitchen, but instead it was mixed with mop bucket smell. Not very appetizing. I had the parmesan crusted chicken with arugula which was very good. I would go back only to get take out. However I would think twice about dining there."}
{"text":"My family has celebrated many a birthday at Carrabba's near the Mills.  The food is very tasty and the service is typically above par.  I am particularly partial to the seafood dishes.  Yummy!  I cannot address the quality of the desserts as I am ALWAYS too full to try one.  I especially enjoy the bread and oil/herbs presented before the main course is served.  Nice place for a celebration."}
{"text":"I had made reservations the day before and since we had two birthdays in our party, I was very specific about having a small desert or cake or something prepared by the restaurant.  I was told  there would be no problem with that.  When we arrived, I again reminded the host that we were the party that had two birthdays with us.  The waitress, Sarah, pretty much rushed us through dinner and before the forks were put down on the table, she had our check to us and kept returning to see if we were ready to leave.  So much for the birthday deserts.   I mentioned to the host that the waitress had given us the bums rush and his reply was that he was sorry.    The food was mediocre at best, the waitress was certainly not at her best and we will not be returning any time soon."}
{"text":"My husband likes coming here during his lunch hour and he wanted to eat here on his birthday. I made reservations the day of and they were very accommodating. Our table was ready when we arrived. They did the best they could to accommodate such a large group. Everything was yummy but they did have a problem getting us our separate bills... still, even with the long wait to pay our bill, it was a good experience. I will be back here again."}
{"text":"My friends and I had dinner here before a Panthers game one a recent evening.  My friend actually got there early and the place was closed for a private event.  The staff was very accommodating to her though and made sure she was taken care of until the restaurant opened back up at 6pm.  The place was very empty at the beginning of the meal so our server was pretty attentive.  Once they got a bit busier, she was off helping other tables and being the bartender.  But service was good overall.  For food, I had the grilled shrimp salad.  It was delicious.  The shrimp were cooked perfectly.  Good dressing on the salad.  Not too heavy.  One friend had the French Dip and the other had the Salmon salad. Both liked their meals.    I had a gift card for the place so that is why we went there but the food was good so I will probably be back."}
{"text":"Ordered Pasta Positano with extra basil, which was excellent.  I love how clean the restaurant is and the professionalism of staff most especially the male host."}
{"text":"The true test of a man's character is what he does when no one is watching. John Wooden After a mediocre dining experience, I stopped by the restroom before the drive home. What I saw made me think of the quote above. If I had visited the restroom before being seated I would have considered myself lucky and left! Makes me wonder how clean my glass, silverware and plates were. Yuck! Pictures posted."}
{"text":"Totally diggin this one! Our server was awesome!! She gave some great suggestions and the food......Yum! Wait....different place! Lmfao all seriousness...overall nice experience! Kinda pricey but the service and the serving size makes up for that. The older people behind us even talked loud enough for us to enjoy their story about some fun drunken hot tub times they had last winter! That's what I'm talkin bout! Bow chika bow wow!!"}
{"text":"We eat here all the time and everything we have tried is great.  Two of our favorites are the grilled chicken, and pork chop Marsala.  I love the minestrone soup and bread is delicious!   Try to eat there on Monday nights.  They have a special meal deal where you can try quite a few dishes with soup or salad and dessert or appetizer are included."}
{"text":"We always get a great meal here! We eat out a lot and this is one of our favorites. We love the Tuscan Chicken dinner, pizza, fettuccine Alfredo, salads and soup. The service here is always excellent. The staff is friendly and efficient. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"So, I've heard their commercials, and at a Spring Training game at Surprise Stadium Carrabba's was the caterer and my husband fell and fell hard for their chicken marsala.  For my 50th birthday we headed to Carrabba's on Bell.  Could not have celebrated in better fashion.  Our server was Jenny - a pro if ever there was one; she took amazing care of us all evening; very friendly and knowledgeable, she patiently answered our questions and kept returning until we had decided what to have.  Hubby, of course, had the sirloin marsala with garlic mashed potatoes - he loved it.  I had tastes and will have that when I go back.  I, loving seafood and pasta, queried Jenny about their 3 different seafood offerings.  She gave detailed answers, and told me that it was possible to have a different sauce than that described on the menu, or a combination of sauces.  Very accommodating.  I decided on the Linguini Pescatore with alfredo sauce instead of marinara.  She even asked if I liked all three types of seafood - shrimp, scallops and mussels, that the dish contains, because some people don't like mussels, and she asks the chef to put in more shrimp instead.  VERY accommodating.  It was delicious   Dinner was preceded by acceptable salads, and fresh, warm bread and seasoned olive oil.     Jenny noticed I was openeing birthday cards, and she and my husband whispered a negotiation on my free dessert - a chocolate and cream concoction that was yummy good.  The food was very enjoyable, and we would have probably gone back anyway, but Jenny made it a certainty.  Thank you for a memorable birthday, Jenny and Carrabba's."}
{"text":"I stopped in with some co-workers to celebrate a birthday lunch. I can't even remember the last time I've been to this place.   So I decided to review the menu online to see what they had to offer. The lunch and dinner menu are fairly similar. However for lunch they mix it up a little by throwing in  some sandwiches, soups and pizzas.   I decided to go with the pizza and salad combo. I chose the House salad and the Carnevale pizza.   The salad is just a mix of romaine, carrots and two olives. Nothing fancy. The house dressing is just okay, I'd probably opt for a different one next time.   The pizza was good. It's topped with pepperoni, fennel sausage, mozzarella and basil. The crust was just okay but the homemade sauce was tasty and I enjoyed the basil it added a nice touch to a pretty common pizza.   If my coworkers pick this place again I'd head back. Perhaps to try the pasta next time!"}
{"text":"Food and service was great. Server was very accommodating. Here is what my problem is. There is a party of 18 people seated next to me. The woman has a \"Service\" dog. Totally get it. However, when your dog is barking and whining. Disturbing my experience, then I have a problem. She says to her companions, he wants more bread.   A Manager should have said something to this party. The dog needed to be removed. It took 20 minutes before someone in her party, took the dog out.   Maybe that's what Lassie was trying to tell you.  Dumb"}
{"text":"The Henderson Carrabbas has ALWAYS meet or exceeded my expectations. The servers are always polite, the mangers are professional and the atmosphere is always enthusiastic.   Today, I visited the for dinner. \"Emily E\" was my server and the manager on duty was \"JT\". My friend ordered lasagna. She was extremely happy and advised her food was cooked to perfection. I ordered the Fettuccini Carrabbas, without mushrooms and peas. Upon receiving my meal, I noticed the sauce was very watery. When Emily stopped by to check on us, I informed her of the consistency of the sauce. Emily looked at it and agreed that the sauce was really watery. JT later arrived at our table. He was very apologetic and sincerely wanted to make my meal correctly. He removed the plate and advised he would \"fix it himself\" to make sure it was cooked the way it should be.   JT brought the plate back to me and advised he would stop by later to make sure it was cooked correctly. The noodles were noticeably drowned in Alfredo sauce. As a result, I couldn't eat it. I advised Emily. Emily looked at the plate and made a comment/joke on how badly the plate looked. She was very nice. I waited for JT to return and he never did. I was finally able to flag down Emily after waiting over 20 mins. I asked Emily for the bill. Emily brought out the bill, but my meal was never addressed. I asked Emily if she would have paid for it. Emily advised she had to bring the bill out first, then address issues after...making it seem like she was directed by her manager to do so. She looked at both plates, agreed they were not acceptable and still charged me for it. Is this ok? Also, JT NEVER returned. Really? I'm very unhappy. The food is one thing, but for the leader/manager to never return (after saying he would) was upsetting. Uuugggghhhh"}
{"text":"This Carrabba's location is really bad. We usually love Carrabba's, but not this time. The food was not prepared or presented the way in which we've grown accustomed from this chain restaurant. Also, the service was quite rude.  I always order pasta with Picchi Pacchiu sauce. Usually it comes with a lot of garlic (about 10-15 cloves in the dish) and basil (about 6-7 basil leaves which are clearly visible throughout the sauce) and is presented with a fresh basil leaf on top of the dish. At this location, I was shocked when my meal was set down in front of me. At first glance, all I saw was white pasta. It looked really bad. There was one clove of garlic in the entire dish and there was only a very small speck of basil in the sauce. The dish was not presented with a basil leaf on top. It was also extremely salty and not seasoned well at all. I've ordered this dish from other locations many, many times and none of this is typical.   My dining partner also ordered the same thing he always orders - Pasta Carrabba. His dish also was not presented in the usual manner. The chicken is usually grilled, cut into strips, and neatly placed on top of the pasta. Here, the sauce, pasta, and chicken were all mixed together and placed in a big heap on the plate. He also complained of too much salt and that there was not as much chicken as usual.   Our salads tasted off as well. They didn't seem as fresh and the olives tasted very old. The only thing that was good was the bread and dipping sauce. However, when I asked for another basket and more dipping spices, our server acted like it was a bother. At one point, she even took away the bottle of olive oil that was on our table and I had to get up and retrieve it. She was very rude throughout our meal. At the end of our meal, when we needed to-go boxes, she boxed everything up but did not ask if we wanted to take our bread with us. We had to wrap it up in the paper in which it was served.   During our dinner, we heard other diners complaining about similar issues as well as the restaurant being out of a lot of items. Some diners were even laughing, I assume because it was all so unbelievable. There was no explanation by anyone about why things were so bad. Visiting this location has really put a bad taste in my mouth and neither I nor my dining partner have the desire to visit any Carrabba's restaurant again any time soon. I very much regret spending $40 on this dinner."}
{"text":"I generally like Carabba's, but around here there are better options for Italian. Service wasn't great, and if you want good Italian food, try Babbo's instead. For the prices they charge I expected better, and it just didn't live up to the expectation we had compared to another Cadabba's we regularly went to"}
{"text":"As far as Italian food goes, I'm pretty picky being Italian. I thought that the food was good. Not great, but good. The portion size was nice as well. I ordered chicken parmesan and the chicken was good, pasta on the side could have used a little more sauce. Herbs in olive oil w/bread was a great combination of herbs. Was VERY disapointed by the Tiramisu. Couldnt taste any espresso because the lady fingers were so soaked in liquer it tasted like i was eating a shot. Would eat there again, but wouldnt be my first choice for Italian."}
{"text":"Worst Carrabba's I've ever been to. The first time we went the filet was more like a cheap sirloin and very tough. We went back a second time and decided to stick to their pasta and chicken dishes which were good. However, there was a very sick waitress on the floor who was sneezing and wiping her nose while delivering orders. That decided it, we resolved to never go back lest we get Typhoid Mary as our waitress and that resolve lasted for almost a year until I got a huge craving for their lasagne. So we go for the third time yesterday afternoon. It wasn't busy at all. We were seated with menus right away. Another table was seated right after us. A few minutes later two more tables were seated one after the other. That's three tables seated after us. All three had some sort of interaction with a server and two had even gotten drinks while no one had even come up to us to tell us it would be a few minutes, can we get you a drink, whatever. Nothing. When a server approached the third table for a drink order and still nothing was said to us that was the final straw. This location will never get our business again. We left and went to the Metro Diner right behind Carrabba's and made the best of a disappointing situation."}
{"text":"Meeting a friend for lunch and decided to give Carrabba's another chance (it had been almost 3 years since I tried Carrabba's for lunch. Not thrilled the last time to say the least). Almost immediately after we sat down, Corie, our server, came by with a big smile to take our drink order and answer any questions about the menu. My buddy and I each decided to go with the trio lunch. Soup, salad and a small plate item for $10. I went with the spicy chicken noodle soup. Great choice! Not too spicy, loaded with chicken and noodles, and very tasty. For my small plate I had the meatballs with ricotta cheese. This was good but not great. For my third dish, I went with the house salad. Nothing fancy but very good salad with interesting ingredients and tasty dressing. Overall, excellent service, tasty food, and a reasonable price. Definitely will come back again for lunch."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed to find out that the roasted garlic black pepper cream sauce was merely the Alfredo sauce renamed. No new recipe or anything special.  The Alfredo sauce I tasted was not even that great.  Lacked a garlic flavor. What we did get was good food however the service was lacking.  The service was lacking in etiquette. The server reached in front of the two people I was dining with multiple times and asked me to hand her my plates versus walking to my side of the table.  We ended up stacking some of our dishes as they were not being cleared as needed. The quickest our server returned was after she dropped off the bill to see if we were ready settle up which she should have been able to see we were all still finishing our drinks. In addition I had a to go carton with a separate container of sauce and was not offered a carry out bag.  Although the food was good the lack of good service is enough to  keep me and my friends from coming back."}
{"text":"We have enjoyed Carrabba's for many years. The food and service has been wonderful. We have noticed the last few years the drinks have gotten MUCH smaller as the price has stayed the same or gone up. I know restaurants make most of their profit from alcohol but this is making me think I may not continue eating here!"}
{"text":"Awsome good, the bread and herbs rock, and I love the steak marsala. Great service!"}
{"text":"I'll begin by saying I absolutely LOVE Carrabba's in Raleigh.  Next, I'll say that the shift manager did make things reasonably right by taking my ruined food off the bill AND giving me a gift card.  Now, our problem was totally our waitress  She was having a BAD night!  We had to ask for the bread about 3 times.  She had to be reminded to refill beverages, NEVER asked how the food was until I had given up and attempted to eat my overcooked steak.  You could tell the food runner was aggravated with her as well.  However, since I had eaten here (at this same location) a few years ago, I know it was an \"off\" night for the staff.  I know being a waiter/waitress if HARD work, but at least stop by the insure the food is cooked right and is edible!"}
{"text":"Thank you, Jessie and Elizabeth!!  And our great servers!  Everyone loved the food and was so appreciative of the service!  We went straight to Carrabbas when we arrived in Vegas on a Thurs. PM. for a three day soccer tourney. (We love Carrabbas and go there whenever we can since there are none in CA.)  Checked with the manager for availability the following night for a large party, soccer team and parents (a Friday night and St. Pat's day.)  Jessie and Elizabeth were very attentive and made the arrangements for us to have the back space.   It was perfect for the team dinner!  The managers and waiters were very organized and accommodating and had everything set up and ready for us on arrival.   Not all Carrabbas are as cooperative, as we went to one at at tournament in NC and, although we had made arrangements weeks in advance and did the call ahead the day of, as requested, they had sat another team in our space. We had to wait a good while and then split the group into two different areas of the restaurant.   THIS Carrabbas was so much better organized and met our needs!!  And at the last minute!"}
{"text":"A great experience.   Came to celebrate my bday and they exceeded my expectations.  A very nice establishment to have a wonderful intimate family dinner.  The host was attentive to my kids by offering them dough to play with which made their day. Also the food was awesome.   I definitely would recommend this place.  We plan to come back soon due to a great time!"}
{"text":"One of the best Italian restaurants I have been to. Everything we ordered was delicious and the pricing is great. The staff was really nice and very attentive. Definitely will be going there again and again!"}
{"text":"I had the steak and fettuccine combo.  The steak was slightly overcooked and a bit tough, but not inedible.  The fettuccine was just flavored noodles and no sauce.  It tasted ok, but far from my favorite fettuccine.  The service was fine.   I had it to go, and it was ready when they said it would be."}
{"text":"Menu isn't extensive, yet the food is a step or two above Olive Garden, and the atmosphere is pleasant. Food & service are usually pretty good; we have tried various dishes. We like it on Christmas Eve as it is one of the few restaurants open that evening, and late."}
{"text":"Great meal the lobster ravioli. Chad our waiter was the best. Very good for a chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Same great Carrabba's food!  Friendly staff and dedicated takeout area which makes pickups really easy."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst service I've ever had in any restaurant we were seated at the bar because they had said they had a shortage of wait staff then we were shown to a table we asked twice to have a server visit never saw one as for the manager the manager never appeared so we got up and left"}
{"text":"Short Summary,  I do not understand the poor reviews of this place.  Good service, hot good food, relaxing time.  OK, now for the meat of it. No pun intended.  I arrived a tad late in the evening.  Fairly busy.  I asked for a table because I don't do booths.  I just don't.  The only tables they had were pulled together.  The hostess went out of their way to pull a table loose and set it up for me.  I was quickly attended to by the server, Megan.  Top notch. I already had my choice made, a nice penne dish with the Italian salad.  The salad showed up about the same time my water did, which was very fast.  Meagan brought me a couple of wine samples and I picked a nice cabernet.  The penne came out at just the right time, piping hot and fresh. Megan made sure my water never went dry.  She was very attentive.  When I finished the penne Megan gave me a run down of the deserts.  I had the seasonal panna cotta, cooked custard with raspberries.  OK, I get it.  Chains are not always cool.  I much prefer local eateries, and the occasional dive.  But I like Carrabbas.  Their food is prepared the way I prepare things at home.  Megan did an excellent job.  If you have the opportunity to go to Carrabas be sure and ask for her and tell her Bud recommended her."}
{"text":"Loved it!!! Great service, awesome food!!! The decor wasn't amazing but it's my new fav Italian spot!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good Italian chain restaurant.  Excellent service too.  Definitely a step up from Olive Garden.  This place gets crowded on weekends though.  I've taken a few gambles on Westside Mom & Pop restaurants (see my Nino's review) and nearly all have been disappointing.  When you're in the far Westside suburbs of CLE you're better off sticking with the chains.  One thing the CLE area has a lot of are Italian restaurants.  Wish the area had more variety when it comes to restaurants.  One can't live on pizza and pasta alone.  I think people around here seem to forget that."}
{"text":"Oh my, can't say how bad this experience was! If I could give it no stars, I would! Service was horrible! Food was mediocre! And then I got a great surprise when I used the restroom. Only clean stall didn't have a lock on the door!"}
{"text":"Perfect happy hour--all appetizers and house drinks. Diverse options and tasty. Given they're serving sizes easily a perfect shared-meal.  The Baked Lobster Mac N Cheese. Neither baked-or Mac and cheese but! The noodles, sauce and lobster was delicious. Don't lower your expectations but alter them. Still-rather scrumptious."}
{"text":"Came here on a wednesday night. Sat down quickly. Someone took are drink order as our server was busy. We thought it was going to be a horrible night out. After getting our drinks, Mason our waiter came over and then brought awesome bread!  My wife got Chicken Marsala with garlic mashed potatoes while I got the Pasta Carrabba which is chicken alfredo.   We both loved our food! The soup had huge real pieces of chicken. The biggest pieces I have ever seen in soup. It was the same kind of chicken that comes in an entree. So not the cheap chicken.   At the end, we spoke to Mason about other places n such. He stated they do not have a microwave at all and everything is cooked from scratch!  For me and my wife it was $43 out the door including tax and tip of $7. My wife ordered water for a drink and I got an iced tea.   Just remember you get what you pay for, so all in all if you want a great Italian dinner then I'd highly recommend Carrabba's."}
{"text":"It's my daughter's first birthday.....and it's new years eve.  My guy got off of work early, and we got there shortly after four when it opened. BOY OH BOY, did we come at just the right time!  First criticism, The entrance of this restaurant is too small. You walk maybe about 2 feet, and you are running into the hostess desk. To the left there is a small seating area... but be prepared to have people breathing on you, even if there are just two people standing in front of you, waiting to speak with the hostess.  First compliment, we were seated no problem. as soon as we told her two and a high chair, our menus AND THE HIGH CHAIR were grabbed, and we were at a table.  More compliments. Our waiter was nice, and greeted us. We got our drink orders (water, extra ice, with lemon) a beer, and a double shot for my guy....and it was a TRUE double shot.   The bread was delivered warm to us, along with the spices (aka CRACK) and olive oil. We stole the bottle of balsamic off of the table next to us after they left. The spice combination, and the olive oil is some of the best we have ever had....other places need to take a lesson from Carrabbas.  We ordered the crab cakes as an app, they were probably $11 or $12. They were good, and flavorful, but small. I mean, breakfast patties were bigger than these babies.  I completely forgot what my guy ordered, but he said it was BOMB.com.  I ordered the Chicken bryan, chicken \"fire finished\" with a lemon sauce, fresh basil, and goat cheese. I got the cavatappi pasta, and a cup of their sausage and lentil soup.  Soup, was OUT OF THIS WORLD. Perfectly seasoned, a little bit of spice...Kept me coming back for more. I could have had an entire dinner out of that alone. My chicken bryan was good, the only thing I wish i could have changed about it was the whole \"fire finishing\", I don't like the crispy burnt chicken ends...I think that would be done better in a pan.  The waiter came by with as much bread and oil as we wanted, and he had a good sense of humor.  The two things that kind of bummed me out about this place..... One waitress kept putting in tickets wrong. We turned down some one elses' food at least twice....and watched our soup and salad walk around the entire restaurant, until i made eye contact with the runner.  ...You need to know which tables are yours.  So they \"don't really sing happy birthday here \"..... Womp womp....The waiter informed us of that. He did offer us a decent  sized ice cream bowl for our baby, which was complimentary.   Overall, it was worth the visit, the time, and the money. Awesome. Skip Ventanos, Olive Garden, or where ever the heck you get \"Italian\"  ....Carrabba's won't be a waste of your time."}
{"text":"A friend and I had lunch here today. It was a very good choice! Their lunch specials are just right for a noon meal. Hearty but light, the soup and salad option was filling and delicious. The hot, crusty bread accompanying our meal was a perfect complement. The sausage and lentil soup was a little spicy but not overwhelmingly so. My companion had the minestrone which I could see was thick with vegetables. Our salads were crisp and fresh and portioned appropriately for lunchtime. Or waitress was very courteous and efficient. She checked back with us several times to refill our beverages. She also packed our leftovers and bagged them to take with us.  As we left we both complimented the host and e cel lent dining experience we'd enjoyed."}
{"text":"Happy Hour is the best here on Monday - Friday from 3 -6 PM.  Both drinks and appetizers are half off in the bar area only.  Drinks are half off in dining area.  They have alot to chose from and with the wines & Sangrias being the price of the 6 oz for a 9 oz, you can't go wrong.  Also you can order from the full menu as well.  Get there early to enjoy yourself at the bar, order the stuffed mushrooms, prosciutto wrapped asparagus and the zucchini frittes, these were amazing."}
{"text":"Went there for happy hour yestetday (6/10/16),food choices wre great, our initial experience with the hostess, she sat us in the very back of the restaurant which we thought was odd and requested to move  Now I understand sitting people in areas to help with the flow for the servers, but we noticed each couple that came in after us (we were the first one there) that the hostess sat everyone back there firet each one requested to be move.  Not an good initial experience. Working the flow for seating shouldn't include segregating people to the back of the restaurant,  fill in your main dining arear first use yhe rear seating for overflow especially if you open 4 -10 PM Mon-Froday.  Our server needed to slow down and wait tk see if there were additional things we needed before she left the table. She was good but spoke too fast and with time she'll be great."}
{"text":"I'm not crazy about their appetizers, in particular the bruscetta, which is grilled (burned in my opinion) and always too big and covered with random stuff.  But their house bread and main entrees are so hearty and tasty that it more than makes up for it.  They also deliver and are usually pretty quick, usually half an hour or less.  They also include evoo and seasoning for the bread which pretty much disappears in seconds at my house."}
{"text":"I do not know what had happened to this location but it has lost me as a patron. The Alfredo sauce had the consistency of milk. No flavor at all!!! The small plate meatballs were tasty. But I'm not going back to this location."}
{"text":"Sure tell the snowbirds are back. Wow it's packed and everybody is having a blast. Sicilian chicken soup is sooooo good"}
{"text":"Had lunch there on Saturday. Food was good. Service was great. Big negative was the cleanliness was bad. The napkin was dirty when we unwrapped the silverware. The replacement set was also dirty and the fork was also dirty. I suspect the utensils were wrapped in the napkins on a dirty table or counter. I may go back again in a couple months because the stuffed mushrooms were good as well as the meatball sandwich."}
{"text":"We like Carraba's and have had good service at this particular location. Their sausage and lentil soup is wonderful and packs a bit of a kick with it. I always upgrade to a bowl instead of a cup because it's so good and then I take half (or more) of my pasta home for the next day."}
{"text":"Insalata carrabba Caesar with shrimp had too much dressing:( should hv asked for it on the side Tag pic pac pasta was ok home made pasta tasted good but it stack together do it was not easy to move.  Service was good and fast but unlike our other visits to the Carabba's in Henderson the food was not the best this time."}
{"text":"The sauce tasted like it came out of a can if my WIfe were alive today she would be Rolling in Her Grave. And my sister said The drinks were under pored too"}
{"text":"Great service, great food. The conchiglie ai formaggio is incredible!"}
{"text":"I must admit this is my favorite place to enjoy lunch or dinner! I love everything from the moment you arrive the hostess are polite and the servers are great at how they do their job.  Although my favorite part is the food! A must try if you have never been here. I can go on and on a out the atmosphere but the place sells itself  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, great atmosphere wine prices are reasonable ... We will definitely come back again"}
{"text":"We prefer the Concord location, yet come here more frequently because  it's closer. Seems like they need to have a few meetings on customer service.  The hosts/hostesses are not very inviting/warm welcomes. More like \"more customers look\" /blank faces. A smile goes a long way and no one is asking for a red carpet ..LOL. Customers keep the payroll rolling. :)  Well, we have had so-so to very good from the servers.  Just a difference from the sunnier personalities at Concord location. Kinda like going to different Wal-marts- same name, different inventory."}
{"text":"The only reason this location got two stars was because the first time we ate here, we were ACTUALLY acknowledged - but the service was still sub-par. Today, we went in to have a late lunch, walked in to the host stand and there wasn't anyone there. Thinking they were seating other guests, we waited...and waited. The bartender could see we were standing there but didn't acknowledge us either. The manager ended up going to the bar to talk to the bartender, had a small conversation, then went to the back. After 6-7 minutes, we left. Consider having staff that is attentive. I love Carrabba's, but I may not come back to this location."}
{"text":"One of the great things about yelp it helps me find my inner critic. I went to this place YEARS ago and was not impressed- I am loyal to Olive Garden. :) But I believe in second chances. This time was great! The car delivery was super fast. I tried the Chicken Bryan - I enjoyed this. I don't usually eat goat cheese or sundried tomatoes. But it was surprisingly good! It included salad and bread. Quite tasty- the price, well I think it's about average for other restaurants. But I did enjoy and will probably try again!"}
{"text":"A previous negative experience has been remedied. I want to say we had a delightful meal today, from start to finish. The chicken soup was akin to what my great Aunt from Sicily used to make. The scallops and shrimp were tremendous, the cheesecake and cappuccino were simply out of this world. Our server, Peter, is as good as any server in the business. I also want to add that the manager, Ashley, came over to say hello and is obviously a kind, professional, caring and conscientious person who obviously cares deeply about her job, her employees, the food, the service and her restaurant. Wishing continued success to one and all and thank you for a perfect dining experience."}
{"text":"My first Time here and I was really surprised to see how crowded it was. Which means they probably had really good food and really good service. I was pretty right on both. I had a wonderful chicken strawberry salad which was absolutely delicious.  When my boyfriend's soup didn't arrive at all and he was finished with his dinner. The waitress Christina made sure that it did indeed show up and told us the whole meal was comped due to the mishap! Wow!! With having worked for Marriott in my younger years...This is exactly what they would've done! Christina did what  a five-star restaurant would have done and did it with a smile and professionalism! Christina was top notch and the food was great! 5 stars for sure ! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Always our favorite place to go for any special occasion.  My husband and I went back again for our 35th wedding anniversary on September 13th and again, Carrabba's did not disappoint.  Awesome food, good wine, romantic atmosphere, and excellent customer service."}
{"text":"We/ve had great experiences eating at Carrabas in Austin.  While on vacation we ate at the Carrabas in Surprise.  The food was okay, but the service was well below expectations.  There are lots of good restaurant choices in the area, so I wouldn't recommend Carrabas.  For what we paid, I would expect better service and quality."}
{"text":"Dear food wasn't that great to me. We sit at the bar because they were very crowded and we had to keep re-ordering things because the food was just too bland! I won't be back."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Food always fresh, service friendly & prompt. I couldn't wait to try the new menu and was not disappointed. A must try is their Cioppino which is a Mediterranean seafood stew w shrimp, baby clams, mussels & bay scallops, served w great ciabatta bread. I started w Minestrone, which I never order out because it can never compare to mine ( I'm a NY Italian). Very surprised because it tasted just like Mama's. Also love the crusty homemade bread served w great seasoned olive oil for dipping. (I could make a meal of that alone). Back to the Cioppino...a bit pricey for the amount of seafood, but it was one of the BEST and memorable dishes I've had in a long time & I eat out often. It's also fun to sit at counter near kitchen to watch how the kitchen runs. I give them 4 1/2 STARS."}
{"text":"My boyfriend wanted to go here.. I'm on a diet & im picky. Lol. I've ALWAYS ordered the kids chicken fingers with the penne pasta. Well, the manager came & took our order & he would not let me order it. So I sat there and watched my BF eat. We asked the server why we have never had a problem till now & he said that him personally (the server) lets people order whatever they want and that he'd talk to the manager again. Manager says they would give me that BUT it would be larger portions & charge me more. Forget it. This place is all about the money & couldn't care less about their customers. I will NEVER come to this Carrabas again."}
{"text":"Coming here after Day 7 of Feast of Tabernacles here, and they had just opened the doors (So we arrived at the right time) Anyway, I went ahead with a Salmon this time, since I have had steaks at other places, I was tempted on their Lasagna, but its been a longer period of time since I had Salmon so went with that.  Since they have Coke Products (BLEAH!) I went with their House Lemonade since I also didnt feel like having a Beer at that point of time- it was pretty good Lemonade as I had 4 glasses total I think. The service here was pretty prompt and courteous, so overall, if I see a Carrabba's I would have no issues coming in to eat."}
{"text":"We order takeout from here regularly. They have an easy to use online ordering system. As for the food we have enjoyed everything we have gotten here. I highly recommend the calamari.  You will not be disappointed with what you order.   Pickup is easy, just needing to park in the takeout spot and they will bring the food to you. The downside is that they always take longer than they say and we have to make sure to double check our order since they have forgotten items we have ordered on three occasions."}
{"text":"Carrabba's is a convenient spot to catch up with colleagues- those who drink can hit up the HH specials, those who don't can carb up, and the staff have been nothing but great. Meals are around $20/pp but portions will always give you leftovers for lunch the next day.  I usually check out the featured specials (fall is for stuffed porkchops and squash ravioli), but the Chicken Rosa is popular, as are classics like chicken parm and spaghetti. The staff tend to push the apps, but meals come with a soup or salad and a side, which is plenty.   Love how the calorie counts are provided on the menu for all dishes, and the kitchen doesn't mind customizations (veggies sans oil, extra or less sauce, etc.) and even with large groups we haven't had any errors or billing issues."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place, I really did. First off, the service was super slow. I wonder when some servers will figure out if they wanna hang out in the BOH, they probably shouldn't fill their customers glasses 3/4 of the way with ice! Anyways, I did love the fresh herbs for the bread but the white bread needs to go. Next, my flatbread was lacking SO much cheese. The flatbread was predominantly red because of how much sauce there was versus how little cheese there was. Last, my fettuccine Alfredo was practically sauceless. I won't be going out of my way to return."}
{"text":"I always like Carrabba's. Proof that chain Italian food can be better than what you find in your grocer's freezer aisle! (I'm looking at you Olive Garden & Spaghetti Factory) Even making that comparison is probably unfair to Carrabba's. It is considerably better than that garbage. And it was great again this time.  Service was attentive and accommodating and nice to our baby. A couple of us got creative with our orders and they didn't miss a beat. I wish I'd made note of our server's name. He recently moved here from the Bay Area (just like us!)."}
{"text":"I went here on New Years Eve of 2015. Why is it so dead?! I am not complaining because we (party of four) got a table right away.  The server introduced herself, took our drink orders, brought them, took our food orders, brought that, brought our check, brought it back, and dismissed us. It was as you would always expect but nothing too special."}
{"text":"We were seated for about 5-10 minutes without being greeted, which wasn't a big deal to us. When the Proprietor walked by and noticed she immediately took care of us, for the rest of our visit even. She gave us two complimentary appetizers and was very friendly. Food was great as always too."}
{"text":"The wife and I went last week.  We hadn't been in years.  It was delicious.  We had the three course meal 1.  Calamari...Delicious 2.  Salads...Delicous 3.  Fettuccine Carraba...Delicious 4.  Bread...Delicious  The service was very good, but I cannot remember the waitress's name."}
{"text":"Flavor yo.  This place actually uses fresh herbs and spices and food tastes like it.  Most places food is bland.  This place you taste the garlic you tast the pepper.  I honestly think the best thing they do/have is the bread and olive oil wtih herbs and seasonings they bring out.  Serious stuff.  Lasagna is pretty good too.  Here is a tip.  Do not order brushetta.  way overpriced, toast usually a little too crispy (burned) and the bread and herbed olive oil is better, free and unlimited."}
{"text":"Pretty much not real Italian food. Just a crap menu with catchy Italian sounding dishes. Out meal was horrible, from the lame breads, absolutely dressed with dressing Caesar and the \"Tuscan\" chicken that had so much pepper on it you couldn't even swallow.  So, great place for really cheap food, but if you want Italian, go to an Italian restaurant"}
{"text":"We arrived about 3 on a Sunday and there were only a few tables occupied. We were seated quickly and our wait staff person was friendly and took good care of us. I had a drink from the bar and it had more alcohol than I would have wanted but tasted ok.  My husband and father in law were happy with their wine and sangria.  The reason I gave 3 stars is the food is too salty!  A nice presentation and decent portions but the salt was the main event.  The manager came to the table but I didn't say anything because I didn't want to seem like I was looking to get something for nothing so I hope he reads these reviews.  Please cut back in the salt in ALL the dishes even the bread dipping seasoning! There is a salt shaker on the table so people could add it themselves.  Otherwise, great location and nice place to enjoy a meal."}
{"text":"I live in Portland OR now, so it's been about 5 years since Ive been here.   Phoenix has many restaurants with so much fast food and mediocre chain food places. But there are also some really great places to eat. You just have to know where to go.   This is not traditional Italian, but I'm cool with that. Chicken Parmesan with garlic mashed potatoes? great! Hook me up with that chicken sampler: stuffed chicken with the marsala is soo good.   The desserts I have tried were amazing. Inventive menu, consistently great and a pleasant escape from the suburban grind. This was easily my favorite place to eat in the Phoenix, Glendale area. Other than the Italian festival. I miss some good Italian."}
{"text":"Their chicken marsala is the best! The also have fantastic blackberry sangria!"}
{"text":"Great service by Mike!  Love to come here for lunch, the food and service is always good.  And fast when we're in a hurry at lunch but still want to have a great meal."}
{"text":"Very Disappointed!...  My wife and I went to dinner here last night hoping for a great meal. We were very dissatisfied with the quality and quantity and value of Carrabba's food.   Carrabba's is way overpriced for their product,   I got the shrimp and scallop Dinner  on a small plate was several shrimp, and scallops with butter- my dinner $19.79 - what a rip off!!!   Wife had the chicken salad nearly $14 she stated it rivaled \"Wendy's\" grilled salad   The next time we go for Tuscan style Italian fare, it will be the Olive Garden, at least there you get half way decent Italian, and least you get more value (unlimited fresh crisp salad, fresh hot garlic butter bread sticks etc) Olive Garden is much better tasting and the value is matched for the quality and quantity for the money you spend.  Very Disappointed! in Carrabba's...We will not be back!!...."}
{"text":"WOW, what a horrible experience. Look at my yelp and you know I'm not a hater. I had called earlier today to see if Carrabba's at North Scottsdale Rd and Frank Lloyd Wright would make a reservation and be able to accommodate my party of 12. They were super nice on the phone and confirmed with their manager that this would be no problem.   We get there at 6pm as per our reservation and they told us that the table will be ready shortly. Ok, 30 minutes go by and we're still loitering around. I checked in couple times and they stated, \"we're just waiting for tables to leave\". But... that isn't how reservations work? 45 minutes go by and the hangry me is trying to be stern - Let me speak to the manager.   The manager comes over and told me that they \"don't take reservations\". I, again, reiterate that I had called earlier in the day to make a reservation and everything was good. They are willing to offer 2 appetizers for my party of 12 and asked to wait \"a couple more minutes\". At the hour mark, I made the executive decision to bring my party to a different restaurant nearby (Nirvana Indian Cuisine, go there! So good and great service!). As we were waiting to get the cake we brought back from the kitchen, the manager came and said they were cleaning the table and they're ready to sit us in a couple of minutes. We're just like byeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee"}
{"text":"My rigatoni martino was pretty good. I definitely recommend it.  Usually I don't go to these Italian chain restaurants, but a bunch of us were out traveling and it was close to to our hotel, so heck, I gave it a try.  It wasn't bad. I was slightly impressed.  They have booths, tables, and counter seating (where you can watch the cooks prepare the meals). The booths, by the way, are quite expansive and not the tiny type like so many other restaurant booths. They have lots of elbow room."}
{"text":"Well this sucks......... I have to give my first one star rating! Bummer....I really hate to do this.......  OK here it is.  My wife and I went to Carrabba's Italian Grill  for dinner the other night and had marginal food and terrible service.  We arrived at around 7pm and there was not a wait. I asked for a booth and we were seated in the bar area. We sat there for at least 10 minutes before we were acknowledged. Our prize of a waiter, Erik, finally came over and asked if we wanted something to drink. By this time we were ready to order our meal as well as the drinks. However, once we told Erik our drink requests ( a large Panna and a glass of Pinot Noir) he turned around and bolted as I was just about to tell him our entree requests. Any other server would have had to realize that I was going to continue the order. Now keep in mind that my wife and I are not drunk and obnoxious or dressed crazy or smelling bad or weird or in any way unpleasant. It took another 10 minutes for Erik to bring our drinks over and then finally take our order.   I know what your thinking.....Don't order now.......Leave!  Well we stayed...........Although we should have left at this point......  So we finally got our salads after another 15 minutes and the salads were not delivered by Erik but by another server. Erik walked by our table at least 5 times going to other tables without noticing my wine glass was empty and that I was looking at him to try and get another Pinot. So after another 15 minutes a busser took our salad plates. Still NO Erik at the table for more drinks. Finally, after a couple of minutes another server delivered our entree's. My wife got the Lobster Pasta and I ordered the Chicken Trio. There was hardly any Tail Meat in the Pasta, mostly end of the claws meat. Also, the Pasta was dry and way over cooked. My Chicken Trio was OK but the side order of Angel Hair that I ordered was also dry and way over cooked.   Erik finally came back to deliver the bill after 20 minutes! He did not ask if we wanted dessert or if everything was OK.  What do you think I left as a tip???  Needless to say........No more Carrabba's for this couple."}
{"text":"...and the 1 star is being super kind.    My husband and I walked into the restaurant around 8:30 pm and was seated by a hostess that never made eye contact with us.  Never.  Then we were helped by a server that, and I'm almost positive, hates her job and doesn't want to be there.  Again, no eye contact but whatever.  We started off with the mozzarella- horrible.  It came out still dripping in grease and the taste was of old cooking oil.  I had the fettuccini and it was terrible.  I've had better out of a jar at home.  Our bill was stupid for the amount of crappy food that we had.  I usually feel bad saying terrible things about a joint but not in this case.  They should just shut it down.  I am confident in my next statement- I will never, in my life, eat at this place even if it's between life and death.  I'd much rather die.  On the plus side, the water was cold."}
{"text":"We went to Carraba's for the first time in late December for the first time and it will not be our last.  We travel to Scottsdale at least once a year for a week's vacation given our experiences on this trip will make Carraba's our first night dinner stop instead of Picazzo's which has changed their menu and ingredients.  Carraba's was very good food and excellent service for our family of four, one teen and one pre-teen plus mom and dad, for a very good price making a terrific value.  I had the veal marsala and it was perfect, my older daughter had a terrific pasta with grilled chicken and other daughter the lobster ravioli, both winners.  Mom and went for soup and salad and enjoyed them both.  We will make many return trips to Carraba's on our visits to Scottsdale in the future."}
{"text":"So the only reason why this place gets a two star is because the only thing that was good with my meal was the bread and Caesar salad. Now I'm not sure if I don't like the food because I just came from Georgia and I became accustomed to how the food taste out there. What I do know is that when I called in the order for pick up a nice sweet sounding girl answered who happened to be a host. Now she did a good job taking my order but it seemed like she just knew the minimum of the menu. Anyways when I finally got my order that I had to have one of my coworkers pick up since he was off at the time. I get my order and everything looks good but then I notice that my chicken parmesan has no pasta with it.  So naturally I call them and ask if it's supposed to come with pasta and to which the manager says if you ask for it as a side but since I asked for a side of broccoli to be added to my order the host took it as I wanted to substitute my pasta for the broccoli. The manager asks if I wanna come in and grab the pasta and he would take care of it but he made it sound like it was such an inconvenience. I say no since I now can't leave work and go back for it anyways. So I get off the phone with him and I start to eat my food of course I start with the salad and it was good. Then I move to the broccoli and it has a funny taste to it and then it hits me taste like fucking fish and it doesn't taste good. So I only ate one of piece of broccoli. Anyways I switch to my chicken and it's not even breaded see what sucks for them is the fact that I'm a cook and I know how things are supposed to be prepared. And I know it's not just simply throwing egg on the chicken and flapping it around brad crumbs and sautéing it for a few seconds on each side. Needless to say I didn't eat it I just stuck with the salad and bread that came with the meal. So unless they fix a few thing I will no longer being going to this place anymore I would be better off in Georgia eating their food they value the food they serve. Maybe this store needs to take lessons from them out there."}
{"text":"We are regular visitors to this place. Tonight it was little special as we were celebrating my husbands birthday. Resultant Mgr took time to stop by and talked with us for a while. She wanted to make sure that we had a great time and everything was to our expectation. She made us feel bit more especial. Restaurant was packed but she made sure that we were taking care of.  Bartenders were amazing, drinks were great.  Thank you Rhonda and team for making our night so special.  If you want a great food and exceptional service go there you will see yourself."}
{"text":"My son decided to bring me here for my birthday. I wasn't impressed. Our waiter was GREAT! But other than that, I'll pass. I love GREAT food...this was just ok."}
{"text":"Just like any chain restaurant. The food was good and our waitress was nice. The restaurant is probably the best part. Just a nicer looking Olive Garden."}
{"text":"BEST PASTA.. STEAK AMAZING we really enjoyed our lunch Cozy place.this is the1st time in my life to write a review but really worth the effort and worth every penny.  100% great meal  Rachell is great too..  ask for her  : ))"}
{"text":"Saw this place near Towneplace suite where we stopped for a night. It was a Monday and they have a Monday special menu. Amore Monday menu. Got 3 items for $18.99. What s deal.  Step 1 was calamari. A tad dry but crispy. The marinara sauce was very good.   Step 2 was their spicy chicken soup and I would have enjoyed it hotter, temperature wise. That's not their issue. I did a take out so soup cooled by the time I got back to the room.   Step 3 was shrimp and scallops in lemon butter sauce. I ordered a side pf angel hair pasta to go with it.   Great value for a meal. More than enough food for 2 people. Oh, and they included bread as well. Don't judge the presentation, I had ordered it to go.   Order at the bar to go. Bar tender was courteous and very helpful. Definitely recommend this place for a good value meal."}
{"text":"This spicy chicken soup is a must have when sick. Always makes me feel better when my hubby brings it home for me."}
{"text":"A great place to go on a date night :) I went here on a busy Friday night, and the service was so nice and fast, despite it being a little packed that night... i recommend this place, has such yummy chicken and ravioli:)"}
{"text":"Not a big fan of chain restaurants but since it was late and I did want Italian I figured what the heck  I tell you what, wasn't disappointed in the slightest.  Started off with the lentil soup.  Why lentil soup?  Because I'm wondering how an Italian themed restaurant can make better soup than a proclaimed middle eastern place- yes Pita Jungle.  The soup was fantastic with a hint of spice, lots of lentils and unlike Pita Jungle, no overbearing cilantro taste.  Entree was the surf and turf, which includes a perfectly cooked fillet and lobster ravioli.  Obviously the fillet was the highlight but the ravioli was good as well.  For once no beverages except water but do like the idea of their happy hour that has half priced apps!!  Service was up to par as was the overall feel of the place."}
{"text":"Just had the worst service ever. I love this place. However I felt very rushed by our server said one word she would run away. Forgot half of the stuff I asked for. My kids entrees came with 5 min and I waited at least 20 min for min. Grilled chicken and asparagus. My kids were done by the time mine came to table. As soon as she brought it I just asked her for a to go box. She said I'll box it for you. Not oh I'm sorry it came it out late sorry you didn't get to enjoy your meal with your kids. Nope took the plate boxed brought back and dropped my checked. And I paid $17.00 dollars for 6 ounces of chicken and 10 spears of asparagus I didn't get eat st the table with my kids. No I'm sorry no I'll get my manager nothing. Disappointed.  I'll post a picture of my boxed $17.00 to go Order."}
{"text":"Our server was Emory who was very personable, knowledgable and took very good care of us.  I ordered a filet medium rare.  When my steak arrived, she had me cut it and before I even said anything she said, \"oh that's not medium rare like you asked\".  It was medium well.  She took the plate to the kitchen and then the manager, Corrine and Emory returned with the plate so I had something to eat while the steak was refired.  When the corrected steak arrived, it was with a full plate of sides and add ons and was cooked to perfection.  I would have been happy if they had just brought me a new steak. Then on top of that, Corrine comped the entrée for me!  They took customer service above and beyond.   They were very gracious and accommodating and I felt guilty eating this wonderful steak for free.  Not to mention we took home the incorrect steak which my husband, who likes his steak over cooked (in my humble opinion) will enjoy tomorrow.  I also noticed that the server at the table next to us, Avery, was serving a large party and worked very hard to please them all.  Then as she was busy cleaning up the mess on the floor that the multiple children in the party had left, she took the time to ask us if we needed anything.  Your staff seem to enjoy their jobs and very job at it!  The food is always excellent an even when the rare kitchen error occurs, you know how to handle it right! Thank you!."}
{"text":"Diego, our server, was extraordinary. He made a normal meal extraordinary. The quality of food in this establishment was exceptional. I had the lobster ravioli on my wife had the sirloin steak with garlic mashed potatoes. The flavors were well-balanced. And the portion sizes correct. All the courses were served on time and in perfect order. As we were finishing one course the next course arrived and they were always hot. Bread at the beginning of the meal was soft and flavorful. This is a great date night venue. All the tables around the outside have high back seats which dampens excess noise and allows for intimacy. I would recommend this restaurant to anybody."}
{"text":"This has been a great place to eat in Chandler.  Last nite for my BD I WANTED TO EAT AT Carrabbas again.  We have been away for a couple of years and recently moved back to Phoenix.  We went to the one on west mcdowell.  My husband told our server it was my birthday and asked if they had a birthday cake and she replied \"happy birthday I\" ll see what we can do\" and flashed her best coquettish smile.   Then came the food.....salad was skimpy and one or two bites of romaine the ret iceberg, slightly wilted and we each had two, yes two croutons,  then what used to be amazing hot bread was only slightly warm, and tasteless.  I wanted to return the salad but could never see our server.  Then my meal. Sirloin Marsala, runny sauce more browned than should be and mostly oily taste very little of wonderful Marsala.  Husbands chicken Bryan was way overlooked and dry the feta on top was the best part ...then garlic mashed...like soup!  We finally got server and asked for pasta instead of potato soup and asked for manager to talk to about rest of meal.  While waiting, her comes server and put a small card in front of me with three desserts and said which one would you like and I picked tiramisu ....here she comes eith candles lit \"happy birthday\".  Thus was the best part of the meal, but not a tiramisu,  mostly whipped cream and lady fingers,  she brings chech and she charged us for the \"dessert with candles\". My husband questioned her and she snidely said we don't do birthdays!,,,  so I said take this off the ticket you led us to believe this was for my birthday....and she said oh no you misunderstood so I said get me your manager and she threw down the check and walked away,  manager finally came over and we explained about the dessert and he removed it...ans said he would talk to the kitchen about the potatoes...??  Then here comes the server and she tossed our credit card on the table and stormed off.....so my tip for her was written on tip line...\"check you attitude\" girlie!    Really sorry as I had good memories of food here....maybe the Chandler location hasn't gone down like this location but don't think i will find out...."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to Carrabbas in years, and remember not caring much for the food, but we decided to give it another shot. Went on a Friday around 6ish and it was not very busy so we were seated right away. I had linguini with clam sauce and the hubby had the lobster ravioli.  The food was surprisingly good, as was the service, but I don't think we'll go back. There was just something off about the ambiance and feel of the whole place. I don't know if it was the decor, the  lighting or what, but it was not somewhere we really wanted to be. The off vibe mixed with the dingy green carpet made it feel like a nursing home dining room. By the end of our meal we were actually joking about how sad the feel of the place was. I really can't pinpoint what the issue is, but next time we'll go to Olive Garden or get takeout here."}
{"text":"Came here with my gf and had the Trio D'Italia. I had the Chicken Bryan, Manicotti, Cavatappi Amatriciana. Nothing really stood out to me.  It wasnt great, it wasnt bad. just blah.  The service was good and the ambience was nice though"}
{"text":"I was going to leave a one star review because they remove the trout and replaced it with awful, cheap and farm raised tilapia but the manager was very nice and also disagreed with the corporate decision and offered to source trout locally so for this reason I will give them a five star.  Good value and service also.  Filet is awesome. Wayne Gorsek"}
{"text":"Picked up dinner on my way to get a friend from work. There were goods and averages. Mezzaluna average, shrimp al la vodka decent, parmesan crusted chicken with  arugula salad was ok, the salad was great, all the salads were great, the alfredo pasta was meh, the veggie minestrone was actually great, the bread was great, the shrimp fettucini was ok, the spaghetti was good. I just wasnt overwhelmed, by anything... we all tried bites it was decent, but for the price Id rather go to North or Pita Jungle, or Pei Wei"}
{"text":"We've dined at this location approximately 4 times in the last 2 years. Each visit has been terrific! The ambiance is cozy, the staff is friendly and the menu has a lot to choose from.  They have a fun drinks menu, offer beer, wine, and tasty appetizers. The price for a meal is $15-20.00 but each meal comes with bread, soup or salad and entree.  This restaurant would be fun for date night as well.  I would recommend this establishment to family and friends. Solid 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Even as a chain Carrabba's has great food.  Our last visit was enough to keep up coming back.  I couldn't decide between two dishes so I asked our server which he would recommend.  He took time to explain both two me and the differences.  After I still couldn't decide, he suggested ordering a half order of each.  I was completely confused....a chain restaurant making changes like that?  He was more than happy to make that happen and was so accomodating!  Both dishes were delicious and I was so happy I didn't have to choose!  Great customer service and pretty good food too!"}
{"text":"Was expensive for the amount of food you get and quality.  Appetizer, soup and bread good, but chicken alfredo very disappointing hardly any chicken and needed more sauce and salt.  Waiter was very attentive and atmosphere good.  We were up at Concord Mills and decided to stop by - think we will pass next time."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!! Our service was amazing food came out fast. Did some wine tasting and ended up getting a bottle!"}
{"text":"Carrabba's has become somewhat of a family tradition.  It's our go-to place for every special occasion.  We've celebrated Birthday's, Communions, Confirmations and Graduations and they NEVER fail to exceed my expectations!  This year I celebrated Mothers Day ~ every employee that I came in contact with wished me a Happy Mothers Day.  The food ~ as always ~ was delish.  The service was outstanding.  Special shout- out to Jessica (Henderson location) who provided top- notch service with a smile and very pleasant attitude.  I love Everything about this restaurant !!"}
{"text":"Terrible food and drinks. This place has gone down hill for sure. Got the fettuccine and it seriously smelled like vomit. I took it home as a leftover for my brother and even he mentioned the smell of the food. He threw it away. Do nooooooot go here if you like food!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. I have always experienced good food and professional service.  The portions are perfect and the prices are better than expected."}
{"text":"There was a brief misunderstanding between the staff and me, but I spoke with the Manager who was extremely professional and positive. Every person who provided service was excellent including the one with whom I'd had the brief \"awkward moment.\" So glad I went there. Will definitely be back. The food is delicious and the staff is wonderful."}
{"text":"I NEVER go to these types of restaurants. My daughter asked to go to Carrabas so we did. I hate them on principal and that will never change. With that being said, here is an honest review from my daugter, wife and myself.  SERVICE: NON EXISTENT. Thats all I can say. Took our drink order and food order and then NEVER saw the server again. UGGGH !  AMBIENCE: Just like all the other ones. Fake, insincere, cookie cutter restaurant. CORPORATE taste is on every plate.   FOOD:  Caesar salad and both side salads were pathetically put together with NO salad representation other then lettuce and 2 olives....That is not a salad of any caliber whatsoever. Chicken Parmigiana..TERRIBLE quality chicken and breading. First time I have EVER experienced Chicken Parmigiana that is NOT served with pasta. Hmmm...ODD. Options were offered but pasta is not an included item with the dish. Chicken Alfredo. Watery thin sauce lack of any substance. WEAK to say the least. Chicken on the alfredo and Caesar salad had a strong lemon flavor. Again Odd.  OVERALL: UGGH It has sunk to worse then Olive Garden."}
{"text":"I used to love this restaurant.  It's been some time since I've come here because of the very poor service I had previously recieved.  Turns out it hasn't changed.  Was at the Outback steakhouse across the street but it was a 45 minute wait so I told my friends let's try Carrabba's.  This restaurant was only about two-thirds full and I got to sit down immediately.   Now I know why.   The waitress made a couple of mistakes right off the bat and I so think her manager must have gotten on her and she took it out on us.  Terrible service!   A friend that came later on asked why she was being so rude.  April wrecked the meal. Then proceeded to overcharge I think out of spite.   I would have said something to the manager however I recognized he was the same one that didn't handle the previous bad experience.  I still gave the restaurant a two star rating because the food is very very good however when the service is that bad and wrecks the evening, you wish you hadn't even come.     Too bad, you'd think the management would get a clue."}
{"text":"The restaurant in Concord, NC is great.  Our waiter Jared was super great, one of the best waiters we have had at a chain restaurant.  Food was good and plentiful, so splitting an entree (which we did on 2) fed a family of 5 and kept cost down."}
{"text":"Great food, great service as always:).. sitting at Carside writing this review...  Thanks Bryan"}
{"text":"First time to Carrabbas in Surprise AZ.  Restaurant is typical Carrabbas and clean. We were quickly seated and our service was taken. The bread arrived and although it was very crusty the interior was plain white bread dough tasting. One of my golden rule is that if the bread is not good chances are the food will be as well. This is the first time that I can remember that this was not true. We ordered a Pollo Rosa Maria and the flame broiled chicken was excellent. We were not served our soup nor our side unless the pasta is considered a side. Servings look small on the plate. Most Italian restaurants would at least increase the among of pasta to make the plates appear full. We also ordered a 10 oz glass of wine and Mussels in white wine which was good. Now a for the bill. We had a coupon that would provide a Lasagne free. This negated the happy hour prices for the mussels (5.99), and 10oz of wine for the price of 6 0z (3.50), plus they forgot our soup (4.99). We virtually paid for our lasagne. In retrospect we should of used the happy hour prices and forgot about the coupon. In summary, common tasting bread, complicated deals for the client to understand. Mussels were good, chicken was excellent, pasta was not bad. Everything costs extra, servings appear small."}
{"text":"Wow, we kinda forgot about Carrabbas for a while and what a pleasant experience and I really enjoyed my dinner!  I had one of their specials Prosciutto wrapped Pork Tenderloin medalians.  This is grilled and seasoned with a \"port sauce\" and I got to tell you, very tasty!  Everyone at our table had something different and all seemed to really enjoy their dishes as well.  The attmosphere is nice, not too loud, well lit, but not overly bright, their is a slight wood smoke smell (from their oven/grill which is a nice touch.  We will certainly be back."}
{"text":"Me my husband and my son went to go eat at this restaurant one night I would say olive Garden is way better I ordered the chicken fettuccine and my husband ordered the chicken Parmesan I have to say my sons meatballs and spaghetti was the best thing our food was not too good tasted too garlicky weird taste the bread is good the staff is OK Little rude The food was just too pricey  and not that good so I would not recommend this place"}
{"text":"We arrived at Carrabbas early on a Saturday (around 5:00 p.m.) the restaurant was only 1/2 full we proceeded to the hostess desk and she told us it would be a little bit before we were seated.  My husband asked why so long when they are only 1/2 full and he was told that it was because they didn't have the servers, why not seat us, explain that to us and get us a drink?  That would make you feel like a valued customer.  Our server came over and took our drink order, my husband ordered his usual, spaghetti and meatballs, I ordered from the tasting menu, bruschetta for an appetizer, salad and parmasean crusted chicken.  my appetizer should come out first, and we waited, and waited, and waited, finally the server came over and told us it had been given to another table, so they had to make it again, so we waited, and waited, and waited 1/2 hour to get my appetizer which basically is toast with a tomato topping on it which is actually served on the side.  once I finished my app, it was time for our soup/salad course, and we waited and waited, so it finally came.  Then about 1/2 hour later we were brought our main dish.  The size of my husbands spaghetti was about 1/2 the size it used be.  Mine came with a sauce on the side which I tasted and it was cold, I asked the server if it was suppose to be cold and she said she didn't know.  I responded by saying I can't imagine they would give you cold sauce to put on a hot dish.  She said she could bring me another one, so I waited and waited and waited she came back and said the manager was going to bring it so I waited and waited and finally the server brought it.  once we finished we asked for the check and you guessed it, we waited and waited and waited. She finally brought the check and not only  had I been charged for the tasting menu dinner she also charged me for the appetizer that comes with it.  I waited for her to come back and told her, she took it back to change it when she brought it back I told her to wait for my payment because I didn't want to be there all night.  We finally left 2 1/2 hours later."}
{"text":"Giving one star because of the great food. I've been at this restaurant a few times and is one of my favorites but the staff needs some serious improvement. The second time I went I was sitting on our my table for 15 min and no one came to offer drinks or take care of our table (the restaurant wasn't even that busy) I just got up and left then, I tried ordering catering and the manager was so rude to me like if I wasn't gonna pay for it. Never going back!!! I prefer to drive all the way to Scottsdale or Chandler."}
{"text":"Came here to eat dinner on a Thursday night around 5. There was no wait and we were seated right away. Mario was our server and he was great. Hot bread with olive oil and spices was brought to the table. I ate wayyy too much of this. If oil isn't your thing ask for some butter.   For my dinner I ordered chicken Bryan which is grilled chicken with goat cheese, sun dried tomatoes and basil topped with a delicious lemon sauce. I order the same thing every time I come here because it's so good I can't bring myself to order anything else. The tang of the cheese, the saltiness of the tomatoes and the acid from the sauce all pair together so well. I will say the portion is quite small for the price but you do get a salad or soup with the meal as well as a side. Choices are veggies, mashed potatoes or fettuccine alfredo. I got with the house salad which comes with a garlic parm dressing, and the fettuccine alfredo for my side. The salad had romaine, tons of sliced carrots, radishes and banana peppers. Quite an odd mix for an Italian house salad. It was underdressed and the dressing wasn't super flavorful but it was very garlicky. I would ask for dressing on the side next time. My meal with a drink was $26 which is a little pricey for dinner for one. But because of the delicous bread and the chicken Bryan I will keep coming back."}
{"text":"Amazing food,  though I would try something different next time to hopefully get a larger serving.  My soup was amazing, and please don't ask about the bread....I ATE IT ALL!!! :)"}
{"text":"I have visited Carrabba's many times before, but I am giving 5 stars for the amazing customer service along with the great food. I called the day before to try and get seats for my party of 8 for my husband's birthday. Being that it is a Saturday night, I knew it would be very busy and wanted to avoid a long wait with my two young children. There was a miscommunication apparently, and to make a long story short, Erin, the manager really fixed the situation for me. Not only did she apologize many times, she got us all seated right away once we did arrived and gave us free appetizers for the mix-up. Our waitress, Alexis was also attentive and kind during our visit. She was sure to bring out a delicious piece of birthday cake for my hubby. We were very well taken care of tonight. I was only hoping our wait wouldn't be incredibly long, but instead we were treated most splendidly while enjoying our meal. If only other restaurants cared as much about their customers as Erin and Carrabba's Westlake does. We will definitely be returning soon!"}
{"text":"I have to say this is the first time this has happened to me and others should take notes. I sat at the bar and the bartender didn't ring in the salad till like I was almost done with my app. Didn't want to rush me. I really appreciate that. Plus when I get so much food at one time I'm overwhelmed. Since here u get bread too.  Love the service here. And really do I have to say the food is good too,"}
{"text":"I came to the restaurant with a 15-person party and reservation, we waited about fifteen minutes to be seated after the time of our reservation. The hostesses were very nice to work with and brought appetizers for our party as we waited.  Once seated, I noticed the pleasant but busy atmosphere. The decor was contemporary and tasteful, yet nothing special. The waitresses servicing our party were attentive and professional, offering us recommendations when asked for and quick service. I ordered the seafood cannelloni and Caesar salad.    The quality of food was very good but not exceptional. The portions were a good size, including the dinner salad served with most of their meals. The seafood cannelloni had a slight seafood taste (as expected) and was drowned in a tomato creme (was almost like a soup.) Everything tasted good and there were no complaints in our large group, everyone left satisfied.    When visiting the Phoenix area, we will gladly go back to the restaurant. Although it's nothing exceptionally great, it was a nice place to go with a big group."}
{"text":"Love the Pollo Rosa Maria - but everyone in the family has a different favorite- lots of choices that are all delicious"}
{"text":"I never really write about how service is...but this shyt is out of control took 25mins to get our drinks...took 30mins to get bread and oil...and 35mins in and still no one asked my order. ..so yeah fuck this place not coming back..spend my money elsewhere"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Amazing people. They cook the steak perfectly and the lobster ravioli are the best. Desert was amazing also."}
{"text":"Love Love Love the food. Everytime I go.....no complaints!! And to be a chain restaurant. ....they are on point! Can't add anything to this...dont change what you're doing....it's working quite well!!!!"}
{"text":"So,  everything was going okay until a couple was seated behind us.  It turns out that the couple knew the manager on duty and one of the employees from the back of the house.  They were talking loud for the duration of our meal.  Nice ambience! It's obnoxious to have people visit with guests that they obviously know for long periods of time.  Perhaps a few of the staff need a lesson in etiquette."}
{"text":"We came because of their participation in a homeless ministry that we're involved with...and because we fell in love with their Bruchetta! We stayed because of their sensational Tag Pic Pac, Chicken Bryan, Chicken Masala, and Chicken Rosa Maria. We will return because of their service and their smiles.  Thanks guys...you made it a special evening!"}
{"text":"We had dinner here a few nights ago and it was amazing. Patrick was our server and it's safe to say he deserves 10 stars. Very knowledgable and gave great advice about what to choose for our sides. The food arrived in the order it was placed (hate receiving appetizers the same time as the main dish). Our waters were filled on time and Patrick checked on us throughout the night to make sure everything was good. The restaurant was busy and the staff was very attentive. We had a great date night and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went here for Valentine's Day this past February. Arrived at approximately 5:30 pm, went to bar for drinks and appetizers after receiving buzzer. Buzzer went off approximately 6:20, we were seated and gave orders to server, received drinks and salads at approximately 6:45 pm, noticed diners that came in after us were finishing their entrees while we were still waiting for ours, told server we were still waiting for entrees, server went to check on order, waited an additional 15 minutes for sever to return, finally asked for manager, manager went to check on order, after waiting 10 more minutes for manager to return we left. It was approximately 8:30 pm. Three hours, no entrees and no sense of urgency. We have frequently patronized this location since  it opened but no more. We submitted an email to the company via their website a week or so later and after a month, no response. Considering the service we received, we are not surprised that they never responded."}
{"text":"Who knew, Carrabba's can do seafood right? I ordered the Shrimp and Sea Scallop Spiedino. The dish was perfect, the amount of bread crumb, marinade and a hint of lemon. The best best part is when you bite unto the scallop, it melts like butter! The dish was so delicious! It's going to be my fave dish at Carraba's.   Moreever, the service was the best! The waitstaff (Stephanie) was attentive, she kept checking on us, refilling the water glass and took dishes away when we were done. Kudos on the great service!"}
{"text":"Slowest carside service ever, typically corporate service response. One call and they don't really care. Not going back to this restaurant location ..."}
{"text":"I ate here the other day the lobster ravioli is so goood!! The salad was on the wilted side unfortunately...got free ice cream in the end of it though when I mentioned just briefly that the salad was a little oxidized or whatever idk I didn't even really say much. So it was a pleasant surprise"}
{"text":"I just had literally the best service I have received from any restaurant I have been to, my servers name was Rodney he greated us fast, made excellent suggestions, knew the menu like the back of his hand, made sure the food came out fast, the presentations of food looked amazing, food was of course delicious but I think what overall made my experience the best was out server Rodney for sure, I will definitely be returning more often to sit in his section. Thanks again Rodney if your seeing this your truly amazing! Keep up the great service!"}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. Good variety for the whole family. Fully stocked bar and a nice selection of wines. Homemade sausage lentil soup is my personal favorite."}
{"text":"A) The place was so dimly lit I couldn't even see to the other side of the restaurant.   B) They skimped on the Italian vinaigrette on the salad, but I feel like they were doing me a favor because what I did have on my salad wasn't very tasty. The bread was okay, but nothing to write home about. The oil used for dipping the bread into tasted like the stuff you get in gallon jugs at Costco/Sam's Club.  C) This was my first time to dine at Carrabba's, so I went with the classic spaghetti and meatballs (if you can't do that right, I don't trust you to do anything else right either). The meatballs weren't bad, but it was a $3 upcharge to add three of them and they were pretty tiny meatballs. The standard sauce that comes with the spaghetti isn't even as good as the canned/jarred stuff you can buy in the grocery store. My father and I both agreed that it tasted nearly-identical to the Michelina's frozen spaghetti dinners you spend less than $1 for at the grocery store.   Summary: I won't be going back on my own accord."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with Carrabba's!  Wait staff was quick and efficient. Enjoyed the food very much and will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Come here a lot. Just love the food and atmosphere. And they are really creative in their offerings. Always adding great things to the menu.   But I was so blown away by Samuel's service that I just have to share. Thank you for a great dinner and being so friendly. Tonight is my birthday and that really made dinner nice. A breath of fresh air. Great recommendations, great menu knowledge and goes the extra mile. Even my 19 year old son was wow'd. He said \"that guy rocks.\"    Bring Dessert Rosa back!!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my all time favorite (stateside) Italian restaurants. The service is always friendly, the food is always large portions, piping hot, and delicious!  I see some people have left negative reviews, weather it be from service, or food... but I'm here to say that I've never had a single bad experience here.   I think our favorite part is the bread with oil and herbs they give you while you wait for your meal... no need to buy an appetizer as the bread is so damn good especially when you dip it in the herb oil.  Talking with our waiter the last time we were there, we discovered that they are going to be changing up their menu a bit. They are bringing in some new classic Italian fare, and removing some of their less popular dishes. I think the new menu sounds amazing, and personally can't wait to try it out.  Anyhow, if you love good Italian at a decent price, then you should try Carrabba's... Much better then Olive Garden IMHO."}
{"text":"I've been here twice already and had great experience both times. The food is delicious and the staff is so nice and welcoming. Our waiters name was Ron and he was really nice. Id ask for him again next time I see him."}
{"text":"It was a pretty good dinner with tasty food. We had sea food and were very happy with it. The service however was very slow, but in their defense,  the place was packed. Overall I can recommend it, but don't expect large portions on your plate."}
{"text":"I know, I know...it's a chain, but we don't have them in Cali and it's so good!! I got the chopped salad and a side of meatballs, because I like my meats. Their to go system is probably one of the best I've encountered. My chopped salad came with the chicken and dressing on the side, so it wouldn't get soggy! They also have to-go olive oil packets with a side of the herbs to dip your bread in!! I mean, that is really next level service if you ask me!! The salad was delicious with crispy lettuce, spicy pepperoni and perfectly grilled chicken. The meatballs were tender and the sauce was good, but could have used just a tad more spice. But again, I can't say enough about their to-go game!!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant loved the food.... Very nice and light choices for people watching weight."}
{"text":"Terrible service.  We are the only ones here in the dining area side of the restaurant and we need to keep getting up to flag our waiter down for service.  The bar side has some patrons but it is extremely slow.  I head to the hostess to ask where the restrooms are. There are 3 employees chatting.  Didn't address me for a bit. Disappointing."}
{"text":"My girl would be a better Food Server than the one we had there. It was actually really good food. Call me if you need a really good Food Server. 805 298-3655. My name is Peter"}
{"text":"This was my first time at a Carrabba's, my husband's too. We were less than impressed. We arrived right before 5 pm, and the place was fairly empty. There was no one waiting in the lobby area, and unfortunately no one at the hostess stand either. We waited and waited, with no one showing up. The staff in the bar area kept walking by and looking at us, but it was several more minutes before the girl came to seat us. She did ask us if we wanted a booth, which was good, but the booth that I ended up in had the  seat ripped down the middle, which made it slightly uncomfortable to sit in.  I guess our regular server was in the middle of something,  because a girl came over and asked what we wanted to drink. My husband asked what beers they had on tap and she just stared for a minute. She said that she wasn't a server and didn't know. Not sure why she came over to help us if she has no clue what's served from the bar. We asked if they had a drink menu, and she said they don't even have one. What's that about? So she went to the bar then came back, and remembered a couple of the beers, so my husband just picked one of the ones that she remembered.  Our waiter finally comes over, takes our order, and brings us bread. We break into the bread and oil and things are going smoothly until we see a HAIR in the oil. A long, curly one. So I grabbed the same girl from before since she was walking by and told her. She grabbed the oil and did bring us a new one, but didn't apologize or anything. Perhaps this is a common occurrence at this location?  Once our food came, the portion size of the entrees was extremely underwhelming. My husband and I got the same thing - a combo plate of pork medallions and chicken. There was more of the sides that we each got on the plate than the actual meat. The pork was supposed to be wrapped in prosciutto, but instead actually seemed like it just had a layer of fat around it.  If I'm paying money for an entree that's called pork and chicken, then I expect that the side of pasta should NOT be taking up the majority of my plate, and I would hope that what's wrapped around the pork would somewhat resemble prosciutto.  I'm always much pickier than my husband, but as soon as we walked out of there, the first words out of his mouth were \"I'll never come back here.\" Oh well, we tried the place out at least."}
{"text":"I order a pizza. That's it. They waited to tell me the dough was frozen until everyone else's food was being served. Need up getting it comped but the situation was not enjoyable."}
{"text":"Will not return.  I don't know what happened to this restaurant.  I went on a Tuesday evening. The lasagna was fair.  The Chicken Parmesan was burnt.  They tried to hide the burnt side down.  I flipped it over after a bite of burnt tasting dry chicken and black soot too find the hidden problem.  Without saying a word to the server, she noticed the problem immediately.  I settled for a Chicken Marsala replacement.  The wood fired chicken ended up being coated with charcoal soot.  There was no taste of marsala wine in the mushroom sauce.  When I pointed out the heavy charcoal oll over the chicken and floating in the sauce,  I was explained that this is what wood firing does.  It looked more like chicken that fell into the camp fire.  I didn't eat it.  My wife's Shrimp fettuccine Wheezie a regular at other Carrabbas had no fettucciei noodles or Alfredo sauce.  They were buttered egg noodles which although were a tasty change, wasn't was advertised or what I have had at other Carrabas chains. The portion size was diminished  dramatically as well, which meant no leftovers as usual.  The Chicken Bryan was tasty. The salads were below average. I really want this restaurant in my back yard to survive, but I wont go again, until I hear they get back to basics."}
{"text":"The food is absolutely made to perfection every time! I love this restaurant!  My favorite drink here is the Mojitos. This place makes the BEST mojitos i've had anywhere! Their bar all-around is excellent.  My family and I dine at this restaurant very often and keep going back. Service is great too. Everyone is friendly and helpful.   Keep up the awesome service! excellent staff!"}
{"text":"Carrabba's never lets me down!! The food was outstanding as always! This place is still my favorite Italian restaurant that's in the very affordable price range. My new favorite dish is the Prosciutto Wrapped Pork Tenderloins! The flavor was delicious and the meat was perfect!! The zucchini fries were amazing and I can't decide which would I prefer for an appetizer. The zucchini fries or the calamari... they are both really good."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to grab a bite to eat here a few days ago. It was late- I think 9pm and they close at 10pm. We were greeted sweetly by the hostess and seated. Our waitress arrived promptly with our drinks, menus and bread. She explained the specials and gave us her recommendations. We started with the calamari appetizer, which was absolutely delicious! They have the best calamari in town! It was cooked perfectly and covered in a thin, crispy breading- just the way we like it!   My boyfriend ordered the chicken parmesan with the Sicilian chicken soup, and I ordered the lobster ravioli and salad with the house dressing (both of which she recommended to me). Our food arrived fast and everything was delicious. I have no complaints. The salad was crisp and refreshing and the dressing was so darn good!!! My raviolis were cooked perfectly and filled with a creamy lobster filling. My boyfriend's chicken soup was very, very good- better than my mothers, which says a lot!! His chicken parmesan was everything its supposed to be: tender, juicy, and served with the perfect balance of mozzarella and pomodoro sauce.   I am very pleased with our experience at Carrabba's. We arrived an hour before closing and did not feel rushed by the staff at all. Great service and food was provided to us, and I will not forget that! We will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Thank you to the Manager. She was so gracious to my family visiting from out of town. My son's dinner was extremely late coming out and she took it off the bill. Thank you that kind of customer service doesn't happen much anymore today.   We love your happy hr and Food of course."}
{"text":"I'm part Italian...so as much as I love it I am really picky. Maccaronni Grill is Blah, Olive Garden is ok, but Carrabbas is MMM MMm GooD! I went with my friend Matt for the first time and he introduced me to some of the best Italian around my area. I got a glass of Cab. We ordered the Sampler, everything was good, but mostly I ate the calamari. I am mostly into Calamari steaks strips or rings...i don't like the tentacles. Their's I made an exception. The bread they bring out is also very fresh, right out of the oven hot. Salad came with the means and I got the Italian. I forgot to ask for the dressing on the side, but it was really light. Most places put too much dressing. Then we got our meals...CHicken Marsala was amazing. I was already full before the main course came out. If I ate anymore I was going to have to unbutton my jeans. I got a to-go container. Matt orders tiramisu, took one bite and died and went to heaven. Wish I could have ate it, but again I would have had to unbutton my pants. Caution: eating here can lead to happiness and extreme feelings of fullness. I recommend just taking the main course home and going strait to dessert :)  Oh btw only open for dinner."}
{"text":"OMG, food and service excellent. Ask for Tristin if you come I . He is awesome. Best service we've had in a very long time."}
{"text":"You guys are awesome. I came here to reflect on the wrongful termination/retaliation I just experienced by a local, deceitful employer. My server blessed me with a most enjoyable meal and experience. I appreciate the \"Complicated\" wine she recommended. It hit the spot in more ways than one. It was such a blessing the way you went above and beyond the call of duty my sweet special server. May God bless you servants heart."}
{"text":"We have been coming to this restaurant  for 15 years and have never been disappointed . I keep stepping out of the box and still have loved the new dishes. The veal parm is to die for. Caesars salad the best..... Enjoy"}
{"text":"Good service , excellent food ,nice location . Was a really nice idea to bring my family to enjoy a really good food."}
{"text":"Ordered take out. We had the spaghetti and meatballs, lasagna, chicken parmesan, and fettuccine Alfredo. Never again! Stingy with portions and sauces and way Overpriced. Taste comparable to the frozen brands you buy at  your local supermarket. Was seriously considering packing it all back up, driving back down there, and returning it for a refund."}
{"text":"My husband is home sick with the flu and all he wanted was their soup, so i get in the car and start driving while making a call in order only to be hung up on 3 TIMES! Placed on hold a total of 30 mins 15 mins while waiting on a manager. I am beyond upset that i may not be right there in front of you but a customer on the phone is still a customer!!! Worst customer service!!"}
{"text":"Ordered to go,  I requested the spaghetti bolognese, but was give spaghetti with meat sauce, which was bland, watery spaghetti, small portions, & over priced. A friend ordered the shrimp & scallop linguine. Again tasteless, she had to put sauce on it from home. This was my first & probably last experience. This chain is like a well oiled machine in terms of advertising, too bad the chef's in the kitchen are not up to speed like the advertising & branding departments."}
{"text":"Beth did a great job very professional Johnny on the spot a very genuine desire to be a professional waitress if you want good service ask for Beth L"}
{"text":"Awesome food, a great new Italian option we haven't tried before. Came for our Valentine's dinner and great experience. Our waiter Jessica was really helpful and recommended food we both liked.  Definitely plan on coming back."}
{"text":"I ordered online for pick-up at 1140, didn't receive it until 1200.  I ordered the pollo rosa maria, which I have had in the past, and it seems as though I only got half a portion.  Maybe they've changed it.  When I used to go in Glendale, you would get two chicken breasts.  It didn't taste as good as I remember it did at the Glendale location, just not as much flavor.  I also ordered the brownie with mousse and whipped cream ( I forgot the name), and the mousse tasted a little grainy, I really wasn't impressed with that at all-especially for almost $9.00.  I'm disappointed because I was looking so forward to this meal to be as good as I remember."}
{"text":"Delivery and Group Meals. Feed lots of people pasta, salad and pizza!  We ordered 2 pastas, a big salad and a large pizza to feed the office recently. They delivered it to us (but we are just up the street from them - however they offer pick up too) and it was more than enough to feed everyone.  It was catering quality food. Everyone liked it alot and it was a change from our normal healthy lunch we do - most people these days are low-carb, ya know - but let me tell you, they gobbled that pasta up for sure. :)  The pasta was cooked right, the sauces were really good. The bread was great and the pizza was awesome too. Loved the big salad, it was very fresh. It was sort of last minute and I called and they checked to see if they could get that order ready in 60 minutes - they were able to pull it off for us - which I appreciate - but try to plan ahead for large parties. (Don't be like me)  I have never dined in there, but I visit the Aveda Institute and those girls/guys are always eating at this place. I am usually anti-chain restaurant, but I was very pleased with the price and the quality. I don't eat a lot of Italian, but this was very good."}
{"text":"We got greeted by a friendly hostess, promptly we were welcomed by \"Ron\" our server drinks arrived rightaway, every step was on time however our food was horrible, pasta with alfredo sauce was way too rich on aroma almost vomited because  the strong cheese smell, and the runny sauce. Our caesar salad dressing was way too strong to the point that we need to drink lots of water to reset our palate. Very poor quality food and presentation. Ron server was good and sincere. Chances are we wont go back."}
{"text":"Just left Carrabba's after a wonderful dinner at the Glendale location. Although the dinner rush was well underway, we were seated immediately, having used their website to be placed on the wait list for our chosen time of arrival. We started with drinks and were offered the Happy Hour menu. The (blackberry) Sangria was refreshing, sweet and full-bodied. The appetizer, Shrimp Diavolo, was divine; perfectly cooked, flavorful and impeccably spiced. Dinner for two was Cavatappi Martino and Sirloin Marsala and both were delectable and perfect in every way. Portions were generous and well worth the price.  Overall, the experience was five stars end to end, starting from joining their Amici club online for email specials and being placed on the wait list for a table, to settling the check and taking home a complimentary dessert, cannolis.  After signing up for the club today, I received a \"thank you for joining\" email with a coupon for a complimentary appetizer or dessert. While at the restaurant I could only view the email, not the coupon. They honored it with no problem. Our server, Samantha was pleasant, efficient and attentive but not overbearing. Thanks to Samantha and Carrabba's for a thoroughly enjoyable evening. I don't dine there often, but I plan to visit more frequently!"}
{"text":"Much like Brett M., I have pretty much gone to a number of Carrabba's Grills around the city and even out of town. Actually, I went tonite. The service, the meal, the atmosphere all were at 100%. Chris, our server was par excellent. Some people are just good for their job. With Chris, by the time we thought we needed something he was there at the table to check on us. I had the Steak Marsala...it was so huge I still have some left."}
{"text":"My family loves Carrabas and always orders the same thing. We came on a busy Friday night and had no problem waiting the 45 minutes to be seated. Once we were, the waitress took our drink orders- soda for my husband and I and milk for my toddler. Literally 20 minutes later she came back with water. I reminded her that we had ordered sodas and she apologized and said she'd be right back. We waited. And waited. She came back 15 minutes later, no drinks in hand for our food order. We again asked for our drinks and ordered our food, asking that my son's kids meal come with the appetizer as he was starving. We witnessed her for the next 30 minutes talking with customers at the bar who were apparently friends, and finally grabbed an older man out of uniform, who I assume was the manager and asked if our food would be much longer. 15 minutes later he, ( not her) dropped off freezing cold food at our table with not so much as a word. After one bite I got up, tracked him down (waitress still nowhere in sight), and told him the food was cold. He offered to have it remade but by this time we had been sitting for an hour and my patience had grown thin. He popped it in the microwave and we ate as quickly as we could to get out of there. Now we have a cranky 2 year old, a cranky pregnant momma (me), and HaHa, still no sodas. Bill came, we paid and left.  I emailed corporate via Facebook and they called me immediately and were beyond apologetic. They wanted to know our server's name, but I simply wanted to inform them of the problem, not get anyone fired so I declined. They sent me a $50 gift card and we returned on a less busy week night. Our server Adam was amazing, prompt, and all without knowing our dinner had been comped. We will definitely be returning again, as I'm very happy with the way they settled my complaint.  And besides, their chicken marsala is hands down the best EVER!"}
{"text":"Great Monday night specials, cozy outdoor patio, delicious stuffed mushrooms, cabernet on happy hour divine, the staff helpful and super friendly, who could want anything more? :-)"}
{"text":"There really wasn't much excitement behind trying Carrabas, other than the fact we had a gift card. By the end of the night not only were my husband and I impressed but our toddlers as well. The service was excellent and the food was exceptional! The chicken marsala was by far our favorite! The chicken was tender, full of flavor with a perfect amount of melted cheese on top.  My daughters had the spaghetti with meat balls which they finished. We ended our meal with the apple crostata, warm apple pie with ice cream. Sometimes this type of dessert is served look warm ruining the hot/cold concept. That was not the case last night, the apple pie was hot and the ice cream was perfect! Before we left the manager came over thanked us for our first visit and gave us a free appetizer for the next visit."}
{"text":"Wine Ing   This review is bit overdue  But if you are looking  For a comfortable evening out Good food Good wine Great conversation Visit the bar here  And team up with one hella quarterback"}
{"text":"Only been here twice. First time about 1 year ago I thought it was okay, nothing special.  Returned  today for lunch.  I completely changed my mind!  it's great!  The fresh bread & olive oil was deluxe. The lentil & sausage soup was extremely tasty.  Chicken parmesan sandwich quite good.  Service very good--very pleasant waitress.  I've been in similarly priced non-Italian chains (which will remain unnamed) that don't hold a candle to Carrabbas.  (The restaurant's name is *misspelled* on Yelp. Check out www.carrabbas.com.)"}
{"text":"Yuck yuck yuck! Super spicy soup. Sausage soup was spicy. Why? Easter dinner here with 10 people and not one of us was happy. My son's pizza even went back and was taken off the bill. They comped us with 4 desserts. The desserts were really good. Should have had dessert for dinner. None of the food tasted right. My chicken parm was burnt on the bottom. Guess I saved calories not eating. Too bad Carrabba's use to be a fav of mine."}
{"text":"Could have just been a bad night for the place. It was late, close to closing time and maybe everyone just wanted to go home. Food was ehhh, the veal in my 1/2 portion Veal Piccata was kinda shriveled and scrawny; the service was ehhh, the server took our order and then came back 5 minutes later and asked if we were ready to order.   I've eaten at Carrabba's elsewhere and thought it was good so I will give this one the benefit of the doubt and try it again sometime. Everyone's entitled to an off night, right?"}
{"text":"The customer service here is truly outstanding. That is reason enough to come but then you top it up with great food at  good price you can't stay away"}
{"text":"While I've been here several times, I just went last night so it refreshed my mind to write a review!  They close at 9:00pm on Sundays and we arrived at 8:30pm.  Eek.  I had a craving for fettuccine alfredo and it would not be changed.  We were seated right away and ended up having the best server possible!  We had a group of four but two of them were hanging out with us and only ordered water.  Not only was the waitress not put off by this, she kept their waters refilled the entire night.  This is kind of a big deal to me.  The food came out quickly -- my fiancé and I both ordered the fettuccine alfredo.  The soup and salad were first, of course, then the main dishes.  Mine tasted super funny but I am not sure if that is because I was really sick or not.  He said his was fantastic and he is usually quite picky.  One downer is the place can be a bit pricey, but I believe they have some $10 weekday specials going on currently.  I just had a craving - don't we all know how that goes?  -;)  Lovely lovely service, their chocolate coconut mousse was to DIE for, and just a really good experience.  If it wasn't so expensive, I'd probably dine there more -- I should really look up that weekday menu again.  D:-"}
{"text":"Im so disappointed with this place!! I go here all the time its one of my favorite restaurants I go here probably every other weekend maybe even more. The last time I was in will be the last time. Me and my boyfriend Trevor went in for happy hour with my brother and his friend a few weeks ago. Everything was fine until the waitress rang up our orders and charged it to our debit cards. She came back setting the cards and recipes on the table saying sorry guys im bad with computers and walked off. Okay? Whatever that means. We left cash and signed the debit card receipts. The next day my boyfriend looks at his bank statement and then my brother's friend looks at his also and their charged double!!!! My boyfriend and my brother friends matt goes in to carrabas and tells the manager the problem. The manager then says he will take care of it at close out. Never does!!!! We give it almost a week thinking it will take a little bit to show up on the statements... nope still not there. My boyfriend went in last week to talk to the manager AGAIN and trys to find out what's going on. The manager then says AGAIN once I close out tonight then ill be able to reimburse you. STILL doesn't. Its another week later and nothing!! My brothers friend matt went back in the other day the manager then told him there's nothing he can do to help him. Really!??? Thats outrageous to not stand behind your company and the faults your company has made. To charge two people double then lead them on a few weeks saying he will refund then it gets down to it and says he cant help them!? I think is very wrong and not right to do to people.  I will not be in again! Which sucks cause I did love this place. I will tell everyone else not to go in either cause they'll rip you off!!!  *****UPDATE**** as of 2/5/2014 the manager did refund us back!!!!"}
{"text":"I used to just love this place but last night it was so lack luster food wise. I ordered the Linguine with Lump Crab in it and it was just boring. There was no salt and even though the spinach and tomatoes seemed fresh the mushrooms didn't at all. It seemed like there were fresh and canned items. Also, there was barely any seafood in my dish. I love linguine and vegetables but seriously it's a seafood dish and it should have a ton!  My partner had the Mezzaluna Ravioli with barely any sauce when he asked for more sauce it took the waiter forever. When he did bring it dinner was over. Bear stated that dinner was a meh at best and the manager came over and chatted with us but the conversation wasn't about how can we make your experience better, it was please try us next time. He did comp Bear's meal.  Carrabbas went from one of my top chains to go to why bother anymore. And I would like to retract my earlier 4 stars but I won't. I'd rather show any update to that experience. So that you may now how far they have fallen."}
{"text":"The Chicken Bryan is my go to order! Yummy bread(super good with butter...just ask and the will bring you a scoop).Pleasant and thorough staff."}
{"text":"This used to be our family favorite restaurant and I was very disappointed with the service tonight. From the moment we walked in the door.  I requested a high chair from the hostess and was seated at a booth that couldn't accommodate a high chair. So I requested to try a booster. I battled with my active 1 year old trying to climb around for 15 min before I had my daughter return to the hostess stand to ask for a booster again. Then I ordered plain fettuccine for one of my kids. $13 for plain fettuccine! Are you kidding me?  My daughter ordered a medium cooked sirloin from the kids menu and it was bright red and chewy. My meal was great except I couldn't enjoy it because of my baby so I pushed it off to the side while my kids finished their meals. Not realizing moments later the waiter cleaned off the table including my quarter eaten meal. I had to grab another waiter to make sure it wasn't being thrown away and that's exactly what he did. He thought because the plates were stacked that I didn't want it?!  Wouldn't you ask to box it or if I wanted to take a plate full of food home before taking it off the table?  So instead I waited for them to cook another chicken breast and small side of pasta that didn't compare to the $25 meal I ordered to begin with.  I was really hoping for a nice relaxing dinner with my kids and it ended up being stressful and a waste of money!"}
{"text":"As the rating says, it was just \"A-OK\".  I didn't find it to be anything too special.  Service was speedy (although we were there early for dinner).  Food was OK, but again, nothing overly special that would make me crave a return visit.    We were excited because they have Sopapillas on the menu.  If you've ever had them in New Mexico, they are amazing.  These were very lacking.  They were most likely frozen and then deep fried, very dense and not very appetizing.    Most likely not making a return visit."}
{"text":"I will never go again.  It was my first time in any of their restaurants.  Being born and raised in the Chicago area, I've come to expect better Italian food.  The wife had an Italian salad as her side dish, waiter said it came with olives, true, only one olive, guess the price of olives has skyrocketed.  We both decided to just have the spaghetti with sausage.  If you enjoy bland food by all means order it.  You get 2 uncut sausages and spaghetti for 15 dollars each. It's not the price, we all know the supply and demand of spaghetti noodles drives the cost up astronomically.  The sausage was terrible, and someday I'll find out what the mystery meat really is, even Johnsville Italian sausage puts theirs to shame.  However as many of us know, the trick to spaghetti is the sauce.  It was extremely bland. Our palates are different, and you might enjoy bland food, if so, enjoy this restaurant.  One of my forks had residual food on the handle, I didn't say anything.  I do have to tell you that the Sicilian soup was excellent and I'd have that any day of the week.  Oh, if you are there before 6 pm, don't order lasagna, although it's on the menu, it's not ready until 6 pm, don't know why. I'm not telling you not to go there, everyone person has different tastes and expectations.  The wife and I will pass. On the plus side, the waiter was excellent."}
{"text":"This was the first time we visited a Carrabbas after receiving a gift card. It was a Saturday night so fortunately they allowed us to call ahead and wrote down our name. From the moment we entered we were greeted and the staff were friendly even being completely packed. Once taken to our table the Mgr told us the history of the business and promised she'd do whatever she could to make us happy. We ordered drinks; I opted for the blackberry sangria & it was amazing. I'm not a big pasta fan so I ordered a house salad and side of asparagus; they were even nice enough to add some mozzarella cheese to the asparagus for me! The server was awesome! He was funny, attentive, and helped clean up my daughters mess after she spilled her soda. Another thing that is interesting is the kitchen is open so you can watch the food being made; no microwaves! The place has a great vibe and the only reason I gave it 4 stars are the price. The food items seemed a little steep for the quantity but @ least they give you bread and dip while you wait for your food. We'll definitely be back... but probably during happy hour."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the service here. I've been to many different Carrabba's, and this one did not disappoint. I don't feel the food is amazing, but it's good and sensibly priced.  Always a great experience!"}
{"text":"We had 2 coupons for free entrees, they only honored one even though the terms were 1 coupon per check. They could have just given us 2 checks for each free entrees. Service was slow and our server wasn't so friendly compared to our server at the Charleston branch. We felt like they treated us differently because we used a coupon. Overall, if you are looking for the best Carrabba's in town, go to the one in Charleston. Better service and more friendly, accommodating staff."}
{"text":"I stopped at Carrabba's for my first time on a Monday to use a gift card I received six months ago. I sat at the bar and the bartender, Jody, informed me of their Monday specials for 12.99. Great happy hour drinks and bar menu till 6:30 PM. For $12.99 I got a great three course meal. AMORE MONDAY."}
{"text":"Came here to meet up with a friend. Server rushed us the entire time. She even brought the check while we were still eating! Chicken Bryan was good, but the side of pasta was not. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Service was a little slow, but our server was very nice and accommodating. Everybody liked their food, except my husband. He had fettuccini Alfredo with chicken. There was very little chicken, and there wasn't much sauce, so it was pretty dry. The women's room was pretty nasty, and one of the toilets was non-functional. I called it to the attention of a man who was working at the front as you walk in (possibly the manager), but he pretty much ignored me and I don't think anything was ever done, at least by the time we left. This was our first time at this location, and we feel the location in Huntersville is nicer."}
{"text":"On Saturday 3/09/2013 our family group of six met here for dinner. We have dined at Carrabba's in many other locations as it's a chain restaurant. I've read some of the low rated reviews for this location and feel that either we are lucky or they just had a rare bad experience. I've been to a friend's home and had the same bad experience to the point where I avoid going there for any type of meal. It's all a matter of clean hands with food kept at the proper temperature without cross contamination.  My one issue with this location was the lack of adequate handicapped parking. There are just four spaces for handicapped and four spaces for take out service. As you age and develop health issues, this becomes a concern.  Back on track for my review of Carrabba's-we had a 7PM reservation and were handed a device to let us know when our table is ready. Many feel that your reservation should be honored on time-no if, ands or buts! For those who arrive late, they fail to understand that having a table vacant is not a smart business practice. Our wait was about 10 minutes and not an issue at all.  To avoid the feeling of underwriting the meal and bar bill of others, we requested separate checks. Since some in our group do rack up a fairly large bar bill,  that issue was resolved before it became an issue AGAIN.   My wife ordered the Pasta Weesie and reported it was fine.  I had the Manicotti and while it was 'ok', my wife's homemade manicotti is superior. Our meals came with a salad. We were asked if we wanted crumbled blue cheese on it? I figured it would be an extra cost but we weren't informed of that. I didn't recall noting that charge on the menu. It was no big deal having the $1.50 extra charge added but hidden charges can add up. There was NO additional charge for more bread.  Sophie R was our server and she was great! No hunting for her to have drinks refills or additional bread. Those arrived before any request was made. Whenever I receive above average service, I always leave a cash tip. Many restaurants share tips but I feel if one server is great, a cash tip is in order.   I highly recommend dining here-but what do I know?"}
{"text":"It's ALWAYS a good night at Carrabba's!  The staff is awesome, and I found my new favorite dish, the Pollo Rosa Maria.  All I can say is DELISH!  The wine is a little pricey, but it's worth it to sip with dinner, I just love this place..."}
{"text":"The lobster ravioli is delicious everytime we come here. Food has always met expectations."}
{"text":"Wow! The chicken Brian was fantastic. Everyone at our table enjoyed our food and the service was great the only detraction was that the beverage selection seem somewhat limited, the house white wine is not very good and they ran out of scotch which is quite strange..."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to going to this restaurant . My mum raves about Carrabba's and insisted on taking me there. We went for dinner tonight around 7pm and we were seated immediately. I didn't realize this was a chain restaurant but it was pretty evident when we walked in the door.   The service was good, but the food, was just....meh. I ordered the Chicken Bryan and the presentation was sloppy. The flavour was way too salty and the goat cheese was too over powering and I normally love goat cheese! Mom had the seafood cannelloni and it smelled fishy. I was not impressed and will not be going back.   I just finished guzzling a huge glass of water and am going back for more!"}
{"text":"I only eat at this Carrabba's because I hate their newer restaurants' layouts, and this location also has plants on the roof which makes it very unique. The bread with olive oil that they give you is a great appetizer. Their fried zucchini is amazing and their cheese pizza are among the best when they don't make it too spicy. Their salads are also amazing, some of the best croutons I've ever tasted."}
{"text":"I have not been to a Carrabba's in a couple years and typically like it. This time though I did not like anything I had. The salad hardly had any dressing and the croutons were stale. The minestrone soup was mushy and just tasted old. The arincini balls were OK but had a very funny taste from the oil they were fried in and only ate 1of them. Maybe just an off night???"}
{"text":"I like them best for car-side carryout.. Best invention ever. Their prosciutto/arugula pizza is BOMB, as is their bread and olive oil/seasoning dip.   Eating in the restaurant is not so great. Service wasn't very slow, no one seemed to know if happy hour prices were available in the restaurant or only the bar area, we were getting hassled for them to clear our plates every 2-3 mins - no joke. The busboy came over and asked if we wanted more bread (we had 2 pieces left), we said no, so he took the bread away.Weird. In every other restaurant I've ever been in, they've left the remaining pieces at the table.   Needless to say, I'll only get car-side carryout."}
{"text":"Been here many times, food is always great but tonight, Cathryn (not sure on spelling) our server, made it an amazing night.  She was personable, funny, suggested and had us try new things, recommended a great bottle of wine and made the overall experience the best we've had there!  A very nice family dinner with a great server, props!!"}
{"text":"We were visiting my husband's dad at the Mayo Clinic and were in need of some Happy Hour drinks + my husband was in the mood for Italian so we popped on over to Carrabba's to cure our cravings! First, I must start out by saying that their happy hour is a MAJOR winner. Drinks are between $2-$5 (yes, even cocktails!) and all apps are 50% off. It goes until 6:30 PM, too!   For cocktails, we both ordered well martinis (ONLY $4) and they even made me a lemon drop! They won my heart right then and there.   For appetizers, we ordered their Caprese Salad with the creamiest burrata ever (i'll be craving this for days to come) and the shrimp scampi. Both portions were HUGE and absolutely delicious. It is also worth mentioning that they serve warm bread and the tastiest olive oil + spice blend as soon as you sit down. I'm ashamed to admit that we ate the whole bowl of bread. eeeek! *Diet starts in January*. ;)   After the apps and loads of bread, we were both too full to each get an entree so we split the spaghetti bolognese and that too, was a winner. The split portion was still PLENTY for the two of us!   Unfortunately we didn't save room for dessert! We will absolutely be back the next time we're in the neighborhood. Great food, friendly service, and the best happy hour = all winners in my book!"}
{"text":"I eat at Carrabba's often.  The food is Very Good, not Excellent, but very good.  However, IMO, they serve the best Calamari in town.  If it were n to for the Calamari, I would not eat there as often as I do.  The service varies depending on the server you get. Over the years I've had two servers that were really good, but both have left.  Some of their other servers are not that Great."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and waiter took great care of us. My steak came out how I like it but my wife's fish was undercooked. Manager apologized and she got another plate cooked right quickly. Great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I've been to Carrabba's three times, and to be fair the first two were decent experiences. Nothing special, but pretty much on par with what I expected -- honestly I didn't have enough of an opinion to write a review.   Now I don't leave 1 or 2 star reviews often, and only when I feel the restaurant really deserves it. I think most would agree that a key service for busier sit-down restaurants is the ability to take reservations. This Carrabba's assured a friend of mine that his reservation for 12 would be honored, and when we showed up, we waited about an hour while they kept telling us they were waiting on tables, the tables were being cleared, etc. Towards the end when we started getting understandably frustrated, they offered our large party a couple appetizers. When we finally got ahold of the manager, he told my friend that they actually didn't take reservations -- would have been nice to know when they took his reservation earlier on the phone...  Because of the two previous decent experiences, I'll leave two stars. Other than that, in the words of Jerry Seinfeld:  Jerry: I don't understand. Do you have my reservation?  Rental Car Agent: We have your reservation, we just ran out of cars.  Jerry: But the reservation keeps the car here. That's why you have the reservation.  Rental Car Agent: I think I know why we have reservations.  Jerry: I don't think you do. You see, you know how to *take* the reservation, you just don't know how to *hold* the reservation. And that's really the most important part of the reservation: the holding. Anybody can just take them.  *later*  Rental Car Agent: Would you like to purchase the renter's insurance?  Jerry: Yeah, you better give me the insurance because I'm going to beat the HELL out of this thing."}
{"text":"Horrible. First the drink order was incorrect which is really no big deal. However the veal marsala was so salty it actually numbed my mouth. The manager seemed to be somewhat apologetic and offer to bring another entree  however with the service being slow and my mouth be numb, I politely refused. There was no other communication with management, no offer of a concession for a later meal, and only a reduction in the final bill for the incorrect drink and the entree that was inedible. With the abundance of authentic and good Italian restaurants in Charlotte come I should have known better."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to give them another try last Sunday.  I wish we didn't.  My husband found a hair in his salad, when he told the server she continue to say she couldn't understand how it got there.  Well I can tell you it wasn't ours and it already made me sick.  I did attempt to eat my Fettuccine  Weesie $15.90 but couldn't finish and asked to have it boxed. It was good but could used more sauce  The server decided to stop at another table with dish in her hand and have a full conversation.  Well the end product was my pasta was put in the garbage.  My husband had the Lasagne $14.50 was good but could have used a lot more sauce.  The servings were very small for the price.  Unfortunately, our selections in Surprise are not many."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner this evening with the fam, a party of 5 and a baby. I have been to this Carraba's location twice before, but it's been a solid 4 years since I've been back to visit. Not by choice, it's just a ways away from me. We all took part in their Amore Monday Menu special. The menu includes a choice of either appetizer or desert, soup or salad, and then an entree. The hubby and I decided to split our apps and dessert, so we each chosen one. The prices start at $12.99 and reach upwards of $18.99. Hubby got a $12.99 lasagne and I got an $18.99 shrimp and scallop dish (I forgot the name). For our other items, we got calamari, 2 orders of sausage and lentil soup, and a brûléed cheesecake. My sis and mom's finance each got shrimp fettuccine alfredo sautéed with mushrooms. While my mom got lasagne. I don't quite remember their apps, though. We were all very impressed with how quick their service was, how delicious all the food was, and our server was completely attentive and fun. I wish I remembered his name! My moms finance asked where he was from and our server said Boston. At the end, we requested our order of brûléed cheesecake and my mom put in for an order of Limoncello bread pudding and we were warned that the bread pudding would take a while. We didn't mind, we were all just hanging out, anyways. Our server and another gentleman came by on two separate occasions to tell us they were still working on the bread pudding. I appreciated that, a lot. Our server came by again and told us our dessert was gonna be on the house and to include another cheesecake due to the extremely long wait! We couldn't believe it! It must have been a while, but it didn't phase us too much. That was so very professional of them and when the dessert did get to us, it was worth the wait, anyways! Will deff be back sooner! PS, get the prickly pear margarita during happy hour... OMG YES!!!"}
{"text":"So I ordered a takeout, delivery order. They told me it would be at my house in 30-45 minutes. After an hour and 10 minutes I called back as my food hadn't come yet. When I called it told me to press 2 for delivery. I did and no one answered. I tried 3 more times, still no answer! I then call back and press \"0\" and ask for a manager. After 10 minutes on hold a manager, Steve, gets on the phone. He tells me all the orders are out and it should be here soon but that he would check on it. He puts me on hold for another 10 minutes and comes back and says that the delivery driver is at my house. I explained to him that he wasn't at my house that I could see out the window and he was not here. He acted annoyed and said well I can call him back then and figure out where he is. At this point it is been an hour and a half so I told him to just cancel the order. He just said OK sorry and that was it. Horrible customer service. He didn't try to make it right in any way, offer a discount, offer the food for free, nothing. Steve needs some customer service training!"}
{"text":"Husband & I are here often.  Every now and then we will get a server who is not so great but they seems to have gotten that under control.  The last few times the service has been tremendous - I mean on point.  This last time we had James catering to us and a manger who casually asked us how things were going but didn't hover - it was nice to have that extra attention.  I always seem to opt for a cavatappi dish and the blanco was superb as red sauce tends to get to me once and awhile.  Pleasant Cesar salad and fresh bread with a glass of great Moscato.  Husband loves the lasagna and chicken dishes - This place is just a solid choice for some nice Italian close to home."}
{"text":"I don't want to say it sucks but food was ehh.. my family didn't like it. The service was excellent but the cost of the food was on a pricer side for what you get. I rate Macaroni Grill higher than this place."}
{"text":"Service was outstanding. Food was lousy. Nothing we tried was worth the price paid for it. Olive Garden has these guys beat for days."}
{"text":"First time here and I have to say I probably won't be returning.  I used their call ahead wait list and really what was the point? It's the same wait time even if u just walk in, and the hostess is not very friendly.  And the fact that is smells like really bad cheese in here is kinda of nauseating!"}
{"text":"Good service, great tasting appetizers and entrees. Dessert was also good. This came as a complete shock to me as I tend to stay away from the chain restaurants, but I would absolutely recommend them, and specifically this location because of their service and great quality."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants. Get the zucchini or the calamari for an appetizer you can't go wrong. The bread with oil and spices they bring out is wonderful. Their salads are very good and always fresh. I will get the Pollo Rosa Maria or the Chicken Trio which comes with one Rosa, one Marsala and one chicken Bryan. You can substitute one out if you don't care for one. I usually get two Rosa's and a Marsala. I really love their fettuccini alfredo as my side. I don't like that they charge you I think 1.75 extra if you want this as your side. Total crap when you're already paying 20 plus dollars for one dish. I also don't like paying $3 for soft drinks.Total rip off and pure profit for these restaurants. All in all you won't be disappointed coming here but it is costly. Go to restaurant.com and sign up. Every third visit you get $20 off on your next visit which helps."}
{"text":"First time visiting this location.  We were seated promptly.  It took a few minutes for our waitress to visit our table.  Our food was as good as  could be expected. The waitress was semi attentive at first but when another group came in,  I felt we became non existent.  When you have to look for your waitress to request your check, you haven't had a good overall experience.     I would probably visit again just to see if the quality of service improves."}
{"text":"This place is more expensive than most Italian food, in my humble opinion. The first time I ate here I was like \"never going back there, that is ridiculous $!\" However, I did end up going back and I tried their Chicken Bryan which is so good, I couldn't even stop thinking about it. Then again, I love goat cheese and this is basically chicken covered in goat cheese. Now I go back! The zucchini fries are delicious. Their blackberry sangria is awesome. This place is good, but it isn't my every night option because of the price point. Definitely better than any Olive Garden I have ever been to."}
{"text":"I been too Carrabba's couple time now with my brother family. I think the food is great! I get together with family we always get some appetizers start our dinner. We had the calamari and zucchini fries. The calamari thing enjoy or stood out unlike other chain italian restaurants each piece was nicely coated with breaded and no clumps of calamari. The marinara sauce was ok. Just preference like marinara with calamari not so chunky. The zucchini fries cut just like regular fries was fabulous and the dipping sauce was awesome.   Entree apparently there running seasonal specials menu now. Pastas second section on the menu. You get two bowls of pasta for one price. I tried the bolognese. I enjoyed! It was nice meaty tomato sauce. Pasta was cooked nice al dente. Scoop of ricotta cheese on top. The portion sizes at Carrabba's is very generous. Definitely getting money worth comes too food. The bread is really good. End up getting two of three portions every time. I like the fact the bread comes with nice olive oil and herbs instead of butter.   The service always been great. Our waiter was wonderful he took care of us. Never had empty glass, constantly checking up making sure things were great. He never minded fact we hoarding loaf after loaf of bread. We ordered food too go for my sister-in-law and he timed it out perfectly he brought our check food all packed ready too go. If never been too Carrabba's its not whole lot different then Olive Garden (I am fan) prices about the same, lot of food, and great for family night out. Carrabba's different vibe inside and sure the bread take over Olive Garden. It place that will be coming back again with family."}
{"text":"Horrible food and horrible service. From the time my friends and I set foot into the restaurant we could tell that the experience was going to be a negative one. During our visit it seemed like every employee hated their job and didn't want to be there. Our table was wet when we sat down, the server took extremely long to even come say hi to us and the food was lackluster. The food had absolutely no flavor and the dish preparation was zero. I've been to many Carrabba's before and this place seemed like it was trained by a completely different company. For the prices you pay at Carrabba's I would expect a higher standard."}
{"text":"Went there for take out and was not disappointed.  I have my standard when I go to Italian restaurants:  angel hair with meatballs.  I got a nicely sized portion of the dish and it was great.  It came with a cup of chicken sausage soup and some crusty Italian bread.  I had absolutely no complains and can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Went again Dec 12, 2017, another great wine dinner what can I say. Jimbo is wonderful, had about 3-4 people taking care of our table, Samantha who I've never met before was absolutely wonderful, love her, great waitress, we will always return to Carrabbas. Fab meal, great service always!"}
{"text":"I travel to my condo in Phoenix usually once a month and every trip I always go to Carrabbas. The food is excellent as well as the service. The meatballs with Riccotta cheese are my favorite appetizer. Serving portions are very generous and I usually have enough leftovers to take home. Nothing better than a hugh bowl of Carrabbas pasta and a jug of wine to make a man happy. Try it out, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We went to Christmas Eve dinner at Carrabas because we had a gift card to Flemings but they didn't have any reservations left. Carrabas is in their restaurant family group so we were able to use the gift card. I was pleasantly surprised at the food there! We were even able to order happy hour drinks and appetizers which filled me up! The calamari and zucchini fries were delicious! I ordered the soup special and a pasta dish which both were great as leftovers."}
{"text":"Very good food! The wait staff was extremely friendly and catered to all of my party's needs. The bread came out quickly, the drinks were great and the food was delicious. I would definitely come back and recommend this restaurant in the future!"}
{"text":"Went back with co-workers at the end of January, 2016 and...much, MUCH better experience! I had a great, delicious meal and our server was awesome. This lived up to their advertising and all the good recommendations that friends had given."}
{"text":"First time and a good experience...good ambiance, relaxed & casual and very good food too. Fettuccini carrabba and shrimp & scallop de vodka, (for the price, would like to have large shrimp and scallops) warm bread and dipping oil...good stuff!   Wish the lasagna had meat instead of a meat sauce.   A good meal!"}
{"text":"First time here and wasn't impressed. So they sat us down and they brought us bread with oil & herbs but I asked for butter. Cause I like butter more. I told the server it was our first time here & she explained the menu to us and what was popular.   So if you get and pasta or meat plate you get a soup or salad with it.   I got the carrabba's Italian classics comes with chicken parmesan & lasagne with fettuccine alfredo. My aunt got the johnny comes with sirloin marsala & chicken bryan with garlic mashed potatoes. We both got minestrone soup. They didn't have crackers for the soup. Just bread.   The soup was okay. The alfredo wasn't great tasted weird. The chicken parmesan was okay. The lasagne wasn't that great. We couldn't eat all the food so I brought it home and the food smelled like throw up my brothers & sister said.   Don't think I will be coming back any time soon."}
{"text":"I came here on a Thursday Night for dinner with the babe and her Aunty Grace.  This was my first time here at Carrabba's and I must say I enjoyed my visit and will definitely want to come back. Our server was really nice and welcoming. She knew the menu like the back of her and had some really good suggestions. I don't really eat Italian food, but this was really good better than Buca or Olive Garden.   I ordered the Fettuccine Weesie which had fettuccini noodles, shrimp and mushrooms in a white cream sauce. It was really good and flavorful. The serving size was perfect and I ate everything on my plate. That's how good it was. Server came around regularly and checked how our dinner was going and to see if we needed anything else. After dinner we decided to all share a dessert TIRAMISU!!! yuuum. Me and babe are tiramisu lovers. And their tiramisu was pretty good, nice and light. Tasted fresh.   If you ever want good Italian food. I suggest you go to Carrabbass."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are visiting Phoenix this week and last night and we deiced to dine here at the Carrabba's in Avondale. In short, the food was AMAZING, our server Robert was INCREDIBLE and our overall experience was PERFECT.   We were greeted by a sweet young lady that quickly seated us at a table where we were more than comfortable and eagerly awaiting our Server. We took a while to browse the menu and make our choices but Robert was so kind, patient, attentive and moreover, extremely helpful in guiding us through and advising us on the dishes and the menu options. We ordered the salad with Italian dressing and they were divine, fresh greens, tomatoes and flawlessly ripened olives with a perfectly tangy Italian dressing. The complementary Carrabba's bread was equally wonderful, accented with olive oil and Carrabba's herb seasoning mix. My boyfriend, being a vegetarian went with the Baked Ravioli Parmesan which was Panko breaded ravioli filled with five Italian cheeses, lightly fried then baked and topped with pomodoro sauce, romano and mozzarella cheese of which, he loved. I had the Fettuccine Carrabba which was Fettuccine Alfredo with wood-grilled chicken, sautéed mushrooms and peas. As suggested by Robert, Carrabba's open kitchen made it exactly to my specs with extra mushrooms and peas and even with extra Alfredo sauce on the side in a separate bowl. My plate was heaping full with moist chicken, firm pasta and topped with immaculately cooked mushrooms and peas. As suggested by Robert we finished our dining experience with the John Cole desert, a glorious creation consisting of Vanilla ice cream, caramel sauce and roasted cinnamon rum pecans, just AWESOME! And while I am not big on ice cream, this desert was no mere ice cream. It was so delicious, the ice cream had a marvelously icy yet creamy texture, the caramel sauce was balanced perfectly and while I hate nuts, once having tried the roasted cinnamon rum pecans. I made sure to include some in every bite. I left Carrabba's stuffed and so satiated I was on the verge of falling asleep. For the quality of the food, personal attention and overall professionalism the moderate cost was well worth the experience.   In closing, I would with all my heart, recommend to anyone, that you reward yourself with the overwhelmingly pleasurable experience of dining at the Carrabba's in Avondale. The atmosphere is wonderful and they are staffed with some of the most professional and pleasant people I have ever had the pleasure of being served by. I am still taken by just how wonderful our evening was. A special thanks to our extraordinary server Robert, we loved you and Carrabba's is lucky to have you in their employ!"}
{"text":"5 stars!!!! One of my most favorite places to come to! The food is always AMAZING and my service is always AMAZING! I have taken several people here with me because I always have such a great experience. I absolutely love the oven baked ravioli and Sicilian chicken soup, and the bread is to die for. My food is always super yummy, fresh, and hot. This Carrabba's in particular is one of my favorite date night spots"}
{"text":"First of all the place is definitely expensive so be prepared. Second, best thing they have is the marsala sauce. If you are not sure what to order get anything with the marsala on it. Employees are helpful and attentive."}
{"text":"First of all the food is good. My problem is with the service. As I was removing my jacket to sit down there server, with dirty dishes in hand, asked \"What do you want to drink\".  (I said I was not ready). So then when she came back and I told her my drink order she asked two times if we where ready to put our dinner order in. (I was not). Then when the ordering fiasco was over and we began eating the appetizer the soup and salad came out. And then three bites into my salad, and my guest not even half done with their soup.  Out comes the entrees. I have never been rushed so much in my life. Did I go to McDonalds?  She had the food boxed up check on the table and was telling me she could cork the wine to go, before we had finished the first glass of wine from said bottle.  I am guessing that most of this behavior has been taught to the server by management in order to get the most people through the doors as possible.  One of my guest said that next time we would have to control the food ourself by refusing to let them know what we wanted until we where ready. I have a better idea, I just won't go back. I will go to a restaurant that understands what dining is."}
{"text":"If I could leave a negative star review, I would. This was the absolute worst dining experience I've ever had. We were seated and then ignored for 45mins. I sat at the table with my hand obnoxiously raised while 4 servers proceeded to walk past without stopping to ask if we needed anything. I then proceeded to ask the hostess to speak with the manager, to which she said she would go get him, only to turn around and seat another table, completely ignoring my request. I then asked the bartender to speak with the manager who took my request and turned his back and went about his business. I asked 2 more servers who the manager was before I actually got a chance to speak with him. The manager couldn't care less about the horrid service we were receiving. A server finally came over who took am additional 15mins to get out drink order and messed up our food order. I think it's safe to say I will never again return to Carrabba's ever again. I would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Mother's day 2016 pork chop was tough, fatty, small and bloody. Chicken Bryan was perfect tho."}
{"text":"We were seated promptly upon arrival  however the table we sat at had no server    The manager( I assume) came to bring us water after we had been there about 10 min,  once our waiters shift began he was right there and service was excellent       We were hoping for butternut squash ravioli but is isn't on the menu now I was sadly not impressed with the minestrone soup  and the pasta was just average, the place itself is nice but had a bad sulfur smell coming from the restroom  soooo that's why the 3 star review,"}
{"text":"We waited in the bar for 20minutes have a server come to our table. Asked 2 times for menus from the wait staff. The wait staff seated and gave menus to 3  other tables. Waited on the people behind us. And never acknowledges us. Then when we got up to leave the managers said she would cover our bill. NO THANK YOU , Shame on you all!"}
{"text":"Haven't been to Carrabba's in a while, so I suggested this place for dinner with a new guy I just met.  He had never heard of Carrabba's, so we went.  I had a nice glass of pinot noir at the bar prior to dinner while waiting for our seats.  Only waited about 5 minutes.  We ordered the stuffed mushrooms to start and they were delish!  The bread is good, crisp on the outside, soft in the middle.  My date ordered chicken noodle soup and I don't know....it came out the color of minestrone which prompted me to ask our server if it was indeed minestrone and not chicken noodle as he requested.  She very rudely advised me that their minestrone does not have pasta noodles in it, so it is definitely not minestrone. So....the broth is now tomato-ey in chicken noodle soup then? Did they run low on each one and combine them together? I'm not quite sure.  Whatever, he said he liked it.  I ordered the Caesar salad and it was good. For our entrees, he had the lobster ravioli and enjoyed those. I had the chicken bryan and it was delish as were the garlic mashed potatoes that had the ice cream scoop shape. It's Carrabba's...it's fancy schmancy -ish...can you mash the scoops of potatoes down a bit to at least make us think you just made them? lol"}
{"text":"Always love this place.  Our favorite calamari in town.  Salads are always great as is bread.  Entrees are alway 3-4/5, but rest of dinner makes up for it."}
{"text":"I had the pasta weesie and my husband had like a sample platter of chicken dishes both of the dishes were good and we had a really nice waitress Christianne H. We also had the spicy lentil soup at the recommendation of our waitress. I would come back again and I would recommend it as a good date night or just because night out."}
{"text":"Had a great experience at the bar with Brian as the bartender. Great food & service. Love eating & drinking there & we live 3 blocks away. One of our favorite places to eat in Henderson."}
{"text":"I love this chain.  I have eaten here many times, but not at this location.   The wait was long, but that is expected for a Sat night.  Got a booth and the floor was FILTHY!  Food and garbage everywhere.   Our server, Peter, was good.  Got calamity, very good.  Split an order of pasta Carrara (subbed routine for ferrying) and then got 2 orders of the dessert Rosa to go.  Everything was good except the dessert.  We literally brought it home, shared with the family,  and after a few bites threw it away. It tasted like chili.  I don't know if they used another utensil to dish it or if that is supposed to taste like that.  However, we threw it away.  It was literally gross!  Besides the dessert, it was good.  They just need to clean the floors."}
{"text":"My favorite hours of Friday is the happy hours from 3-630 of Carrabba's. The ambiance of this place is cozy and very inviting. There are a lot of seating in the bar area. Their half off appetizers and sangrias are to die for. The staff is friendly and efficient. I love this place. I'd come here every time I can."}
{"text":"I went to Carrabba's last night for a birthday celebration. Being raised in an Italian house I have no preconceived notion that ANY commerial Italian food restaurant will satisfy my tastebuds - Carrabba's did not change this assessment. I had the Chicken and Spinich Cannelloni with Sausage Lental Soup. The innars of the Cannelloni lacked seasioning and was overshadowed by the sweetness of the equally unseasoned sauce. The Sausage Lental soup, for me, was the best part of the meal but was over peppered (black pepper). The bread served at the table wasn't removly crusty and appeared to be brown a serve (and not browned, i might add).  Service: The wait staff was well intentioned but obviously not up to serving a party of 14 quickly. I had to wait for drinks, seasoning for my olive oil, and then the bill (about $70).  I would not recommend this place..though, as I said, I'm accustomed to better italian food. Besides, I make better italian food myself (thanks Mom)."}
{"text":"We went here for a quick lunch since we had about a hour to kill, new to the area so we just wanted something simple since we were a bit hungry. We were seated immediately & greeted by our server Allison who was very nice. Being that it was a late lunch & we hadn't eaten all day we chose to share a calamari which was good with no complaints of being greasy or over cooked. My hubby went with the wings that were charbroiled perfectly & just the right size being that the jumbo wings make my hubby nervous. I decided to try the margarita pizza & it was perfectly cooked with the perfect amount of charr without it becoming burnt. Once we move to Avondale next month we'll definitely be back to see Allison for some great service & a quick simple meal!"}
{"text":"Took my wife here for her birthday on Saturday.  They were not overly busy but we waited what seemed like a long time for our dinner. We made the mistake of ordering the steak, which was the toughest meat I have ever been served in a restaurant in my life. I could hardly cut it with their steak knife! I took it home after three bites and cut it in little teeny pieces for the dog. He'll eat anything.  The pasta was actually cold, not just cool but actually cold. With all that said, we love the salad and the breadsticks, and the pasta was very tasty, but cold. Marsala ravioli would've been wonderful if it hadn't been cold (oh did I mention that already?)  We usually enjoy our meals at the Olive Garden, but this time was less than stellar."}
{"text":"We love Frank! He's serves at the bar rail. Always very pleasant, informative, and loves our personal requests. He will even go to the kitchen and make special requests just for us. He's the best."}
{"text":"I am very much a fan of Carraba's, but this one dropped the ball.  My sausage and lentil soup was great, as usual.  But my mom ordered spaghetti and had to send it back twice before telling them to take it off the bill completely.  For some reason whoever was cooking yesterday thought that spaghetti sauce should be like water.  It's spaghetti and you're an Italian restaurant.  Spaghetti should be a no brainer."}
{"text":"Everything about our dinner was delicious....the bread, the salad with house dressing, and the fettuccini alfredo....yum!!!"}
{"text":"First time here and I loved the food and everyone was so friendly!! Definitely coming back!! Forget Olive Garden. They are nothing alike!!"}
{"text":"Review sept 2017 Huge disappointment. This place was a weekly if not biweekly family favorite. Things abruptly went straight downhill several months ago. I couldn't figure out what the heck had happened until I recently insisted on speaking with Greg, the proprietor, ding ding ding - under new ownership/proprietorship. Her name is Ashley and let me just tell you - don't bother.    Seriously, what a disappointment. I have ordered 3 times for car side pickup since new management.  All 3 times I waited beyond the promised time an additional 20-35 min. Unacceptable. One order ($62) they kept saying they were waiting on one thing. The order should have been ready at 420. It was 455 when it was finally brought to my car. And when I got home everything was soggy and cold. I was ripped, called Ashley and she said she was sorry. That's it- sorry. This type of flippant attitude and sucky service never, not once, happened before new management and I'm sorry to say we will not be coming back. If we are in concord I'm sure we will stop in for our fix. Will not return to this location. Real bummer.   Review from 2016  I can't believe this is my first review of carabbas in huntersville. My sister, 2 nieces and I are regulars. When you order here it is always brought to the table hot and is consistent. I know if I order the linguini positano it will be exactly (and deliciously) the same every time. The staff including manager Greg is always friendly. A peeve I have at other restaurants is when your food is ready to be brought to the table and it sits there waiting and waiting for your specific server. Here when it's ready someone is grabbing it and serving it if your server is tied up. This ensures your food is hot!  A couple of our favorites include the calamari (best I've had), lasagna and linguini positano. I would say the only negative is the pasta dishes i.e. Spaghetti, linguini positano etc could use more sauce. I always ask for extra sauce on the side which remedies my preference. This is hands down our favorite restaurant in the area and for certain favorite Italian."}
{"text":"So so sad. Have been a couple of times to this location and been pretty darn good. Was there last weekend and it was just terrible. The service was excellent, bar and table, but the food was so disappointing. Husband got the grilled scallops and shrimp with garlic mashed. His plate looked like an empty sea of beige, too few pieces food thrown on too big of a plate, was something I would never think acceptable to a higher end chain to serve. We both ordered Caesar salad where the lettuce was old looking and wilted. This the stuff you find in your fridge and toss. The reason we didn't send it back was because they were so busy   I ordered a chicken (arugula was a few pieces, barely  there) dish that featured this terrific Mediterranean vinaigrette (not present). We couldn't wait to leave. Sad this experience was so very poor."}
{"text":"Hadn't been to Carraba's in years and first time at this one.   We called ahead and put ourselves on the wait list but when we arrived at 7:00 PM our table was ready. We were given water and menus right away and Cody greeted us soon after.   Without apps, we a ordered our meals and drinks together. My wife ordered the Baked Salmon with garlic mashed pots and a glass of Chardonnay. Our daughter ordered the Sirloin with garlic mash plus champagne and her husband got the Chicken Trio,  garlic mash and a glass of merlot. I ordered the Chicken Trio, but subbed one type of chicken (prosecco for Marsala) with garlic mash.   Our salads and soup arrived quickly. The soup (lentil sausage) was excellent, as recommended by our server. The salads were fresh, crisp, cold and portioned right.   The meals arrived about 10 mins later. My trio got mixed up: they left the Marsala on the plate and took out the Chicken Maria. Too bad. The Prosecco Chicken was the highlight, with crispy coating, juicy insides and flavorful profile. The Chicken Bryan is always a fave of mine too.   Cody did an excellent job with our table, refilling half-empty glasses, apologizing for the mistake with the Marsala and generally keeping up a good conversation. I planned on mentioning him to the manager but it was very busy and folks were waiting for our table by the time we were done."}
{"text":"I had dinner with a friend here during week of 11-14-16.  I ordered the Chicken Bryan (wood fire grilled chicken breast with goat cheese and sun dried tomato on top with a buttery sauce) and a side of pasta w/red sauce.  Entrée served with a side salad at a total cost of $18.99.  Salad was not nearly as fresh as it could have been (some rusty remnants) and was a bit boring, consisting, to my eye, entirely of iceberg lettuce and two, lonely, tiny, pitted Kalamata olives.  Parmesan dressing was pretty good and not overly garlicky or salty.  Entrée was quite good although the chicken was not cut into two portions; rather, it appeared to be two breasts still attached in the center.  I feel the chicken would have been more appetizing if it would have been cut into two separate portions and better trimmed.  Flavor was very good, though.  Portions were ample.  Hot bread (nothing very interesting) and olive oil and herbs were served with the meal.  Butter was provided to me at my request.  Overall, the meal was quite good but not nearly as tasty as this entrée was the last time I ordered it (when the chicken was properly trimmed and the salad much fresher), which was approximately 1-2 years ago.  We arrived early, around 4:45pm and by the time we left, around 6:00-6:15pm, the place was crowded with people queued up waiting for tables and the noise level was quite high.  Service was very good.  The restroom and the restaurant appeared to be very clean and well maintained."}
{"text":"This place has amazing food! My husband proposed to me here and we absolutely love coming back for the food and the memories!"}
{"text":"Never disappoints, food is good, service good, always walking out satisfied.  We usually sit in the bar and share different dishes, Chris the bartender is a pleasure and always delivers a great experience.  It is hard to get a better value for your $$$, easy to find a more expensive place but hard to find the overall value.  We are definately back next week!"}
{"text":"The food at this restaurant is decent, and every time I've eaten inside it was good. However my review of the restaurant is based on my catering order with management and the catering department.   I had placed an order for apx. 30 people for a rehearsal dinner for our wedding. When I originally called the manager had no idea what I was ordering from. He asked me what menu I was using and I told him the one they had advertised on their web site. He said ok, I'll figure it out. Well he did not and the food was delivered in individual plastic containers as thought I were having a business lunch. Embarrassing is an understatement.   When I called to complain and talk to the manager I was told he was in the kitchen and too busy on Friday night to rectify the situation and rudely asked, \"what is it you want us to do?\" . I was told the manager would call me to refund or offer me something in return for my inconvenience but I have not received any such phone call.   I spent a great deal of money that night for nothing. Food was cold and tasted bad (perhaps because of the plastic containers) and my guests were inconvenienced leaving me horribly embarrassed. I will never order here again, and probably never eat inside again as a result. I can not support a place so unprofessional."}
{"text":"Overall probably our most favorite place to go to eat as a family. Everybody has their favorite entree and the service is always great. Knowing what to get and how to order it makes this restaurant A constant go to for us. The food is always the same tastes great good value good atmosphere."}
{"text":"Came here with a coworker who was in town. Both had the salmon prepared different ways. I liked mine and he his. The cavatappi amatriciana (try saying that fast 3 times) is worth trying rather than the standard variation of mashed potatoes, but those are good here too. Calamari is fried nice and not greasy. Thin batter like  tempura. Great chain food."}
{"text":"Came to check the happy hour with 4 girlfriends and Vashaun had his hands full with us. We gave him a hard time right off the bat, but he handled us well. Great experience, great happy hour."}
{"text":"Great service! As we walked to our table, every server greeted us with a smile and pleasantry. The mussels for appetizer were excellent. All the courses were delivered at exactly the right time. The food was top notch. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I had the chicken Bryan with pasta and minestrone soup. I was surprised at how much I liked the food. The bread was delicious and the seasoning mixed with olive oil was tasty. The portion size was huge. I think of this place as an elevated Olive Garden. The staff was friendly. This is a good neighborhood chain restaurant."}
{"text":"I went with my wife and friend.We all three had different items and all of them were very bland and had very little flavor.  We spent $50 ( with the tip) and felt we had received very little for the money.  I had not been to a Carrabba's in a few years and it maybe a century before I would try it again.  Don't waste your money.  The Blue Beer was great but then again they did not make it."}
{"text":"My grandson and I had lunch here on Mothers Day(he is very thoughtful and only 17) we started with Calamari as our app, which was prepared perfectly. Our server recommended the pasta weezie and was very pleased, have never had a bad meal and on this visit our server was the best and very attentive!"}
{"text":"The piccata was fantastic! They happily allowed me to have chicken instead of veal. Make sure to ask them to add the capers. Yummy! The side of broccoli was okay. They add peppers and onions to it which is not my preference. Why mess with a good thing? The salad was ok, bread was excellent. The Chicken Bryan was very flavorful. We had creme brûlée for dessert which was also very good although we would've preferred to have had the top a bit more brûlée. Service was excellent, even the chef came by to check how the meal was. I also enjoyed my leftovers fir lunch today. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food and the nice romantic setting. I will bring friends & family! The food was not over priced. The liquor was very nice."}
{"text":"De-Lish!!! We came here for dinner and they do call ahead seating to minimize your wait time...that's always a plus!   The menu is great, they have a ton of new items.   Service was awesome...Jaime our server was great!  We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I took my parents here for my dad's birthday. It was busy, but the staff was very accommodating. My father has a habit of talking with the employees. Though they were overtly occupied, they took the time to engage with him. The waitstaff have superb guest service. Our waiter was Brent. If I had to describe him in one word, it would be \"intense.\" He was consistent, yet seemed to be in the midst of a juggling act with his tables. Perhaps the only reason I noticed this is because I, myself, am a waiter and bartender. He thoroughly explained the menu and gave excellent recommendations. I had the Pollo Rosa Maria. Definitely a great selection! My dad ordered the Lobster Ravioli and my mom had a pasta dish with shrimp and scallops. We tried each other's plates. Everything was exceptional! I would recommend this particular restaurant at this very location regardless of the occasion. We all left full and happy. I couldn't ask for a better birthday dinner for my father!"}
{"text":"Amazing service, our server was really sweet and had plenty of recommendations for us.  The servings were a little smaller than we expected, but the food was very tasty.  worth it."}
{"text":"In the past,the prices began to get very high at this location, so we stopped going. A few years past and we decided to try it again yesterday evening. It was disappointing!  The food was good, nothing special but good. The prices were even higher than I remembered. There should be 3 - $$$, not 2 as shown for the listing. However, the real issue, is with the portions of the meals. There were four of us and we all had different dinners. As I said above, the food was good and the ingredients were of good quality. The portions were amazingly small. We all order the full dinner or large as it is stated on the menu. It would be interesting to see what a small or half order would have been like. I cannot recommend this restaurant. There are many fine Italian Restaurants in the area that are far more reasonably priced, with even better food and the portions are large, as you would expect."}
{"text":"Smells like poo, tastes like chicken!!!  This was my first time visiting Carrabba's (Cacabba's).  What a way to make a first impression.  There was a nasty odor coming from somewhere.  The odor greeted me when I walked up to the hostess stand.  We were seated close to the hostess stand and I could still smell it.  I don't mean to gross you out but it smelled like a poopy womens bathroom.  We asked for a different table.  Somewhere in the far back away from the entrance.  We did out run the smell and had our dinner.  I had the rigatoni.  Check please.  Our waitress was good.  She earned a star for this review."}
{"text":"Lobster Ravioli was very tasty, I could have passed on the calamari, friendly and attentive wait staff made the experience enjoyable"}
{"text":"I've dined at this Carraba's location many times and always have enjoyed the food and good service. I don't agree with most of the one star reviews."}
{"text":"Great food but the service was slow, however, our waitresses were considerate.  We went for lunch and had reservations since I had a party of 12.  We spent about 2+ hours there mostly because we were awaiting the arrival of our food and drinks.  There was a mishap in the kitchen which had us waiting for our bread but well worth the wait.    My sister in law and I shared the special at the time which included soup or salad, entree, and dessert for only $15.  It was flavorful and the portion was just right."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time the other day. Solely giving the 3 stars because the waitress had a great personality! Service was a little slow (even though restaurant was nearly empty)  and we had to keep reminding her of things we had asked for (i.e. A drink refill, sugar for coffee). I had the chicken Alfredo which isn't listed on the menu, you just have to ask them for it. Now this was horrible!!! Worst Alfredo I've ever had. Noodles were dry and the chicken was not tasty at all. Definitely will not be coming back but I enjoyed the waitress."}
{"text":"To me, great servers are just as important to an excellent restaurant experience as great food, and I'm glad to say that Carrabba's has an absolute find in Joshua.  This was only our second time being seated in his section, but he remembered us...even down to some of the dishes we had the last time we were in, (and that was about THREE MONTHS AGO!!!) But his attentiveness and his way with people isn't something you can teach, though you CAN improve it with time and experience.  But for the most part, you either got it or you don't, and Joshua has it and THEN some! Even a SNAFU with the building AC on this trip couldn't completely mar our experience, thanks mostly to him! So yes, Carrabba's, give that man a raise! And to anyone going to visit for the first or the 15th time - Ask for him by name.  You WON'T be sorry!"}
{"text":"Can't get the time right?   Called ahead was told 30mins arrived about 20mins later and was told it was still going to be 30mins more. After that wait was told it would be 25 more. Left..."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Carrabbas and I loved it! Our party of 6 was seated right away and out came 2 baskets of crusty bread served with an olive oil and herb dipping sauce - delicious! I ordered peach sangria and was brought a sample glass just to make sure that I liked it before they made my cocktail! A very nice touch.  My husband and I shared an appetizer of Italian sausage stuffed mushrooms which were extremely tasty. My entree was shrimp alfredo topped with mushrooms and basil, which had a nice amount of shrimp and a delicious creamy sauce. Other dishes around the table were lasagna, spaghetti and meatballs, scallop and shrimp linguine, lobster ravioli, and grilled chicken. Clean plates all around!  Unfortunately, I live in an area (Southern California) with no Carrabbas, so who knows when I'll be able to go back, but I definitely will!"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful meal with friends and family on a Sunday evening. Great food and atmosphere, our waitress (Brianna) had a terrific attitude and kept on top of us throughout the meal. Just the type of evening we were hoping for and expecting!"}
{"text":"I eat at Carabbas all the time, but this was my first time at this one. It was so gross, the sauce drenched the whole plate, the pasta was mush, thumbs down carabbas. get your act together"}
{"text":"Very impressed with this restaurant. My first time at one and it was very nice. Despite being packed on a Saturday night, I was seated quickly and attended to often by my server. The food tasted good and I thought everything was reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place a better review.. but I cant. I went here with my husband and daughter for dinner. The food was good but very rich. I felt like I needed to take a bath after. It seemed like most of their flavors came from fat.. maybe it was just what we ordered. I also ordered a glass of their Sangria .. was disapointed with that too. The glass was small.. which you cant do with Sangria since most of it gets taken up by fruit! They did have some delicious herb dipping oil for your bread. That was about the only thing I was impressed with. Good service. However I was, along with my husband, sick all that night after eating there. I most likely wont be going back."}
{"text":"Typical chain Italian food. Not bad but not great."}
{"text":"Everything never comes out the way you're picturing. Simple presentation and not very good.   Salty and they ran out of A1 sauce."}
{"text":"Perfect late night dinner.  Had two new items on the menu, the cioppino  and shrimp wrapped in prosciutto. Both were great.  Best of all was our service at the bar. Sarah was awesome and the sangria was great. .and 10 bucks off on Wednesday!"}
{"text":"Carrabba's is a chain that I've only experienced in NC.  Spending the weekend with friends, this was the lunch choice on Sunday.  We were a party of 6 and were greeted with smiles by the hostesses and seated immediately.  The dining room was not full to capacity, but was certainly bustling.   Our waiter was very attentive and I don't think my iced tea was ever more than 3/4 empty at any given time during our meal.  The menu was varied and the portions were really huge, especially for lunchtime.  I couldn't finish my chicken, pasta and tomato cream sauce dish!  The bread was warm with a nice crispy crust and the salad was composed of very fresh greens.  My experience here has been consistent, which is rare at best in some of these chain restaurants....so Huntersville, my hats' off to ya!"}
{"text":"Had a gift card and decided to use at Carrabbas (other choices are Bonefish or Outback).  We were pleasantly surprised that the food was as good as it was, with it being a chain restaurant!  Two orders of chicken fingers for the kids, spaghetti for the side, Mezzaluna ravioli for me, and Chicken Arugula with spaghetti for the husband.  It was all really good - my older son can't wait to go back.  Patrick was our waiter and he was AWESOME..........haven't had such good service in years.  Will definitely be back another day.    Side note:  We did call ahead and were seated ahead of people that were waiting, which was great!"}
{"text":"I'm upping my Review to Three and a Half Stars. But as I, and others have noted, the service here can be lacking, bordering on atrocious.   So many large chains, like Carrabba's and Macaroni Grill seem to lose track of you, or instead, over working their servers with too many tables, or both.  Carrabba's is owned by Bloomin' Brands, the same folks that own Flemmings, Bonefish and Outback Steakhouse.  And, all places that we've found to be iffy with service.   Now Carrabba's believes they're niche is:  \"We're two Sicilian boys from Texas who love to cook and eat. We love the Sicilian food our parents and grandparents cooked. We love the Creole and Southern food our family members picked up passing through Louisiana and stepping off the boat right on the dock in Galveston. And we love the Western food that's just part of being in Texas.\"    Whoa Nellie, that's a Texas mouth full! LOL. When I think of Texas, I don't think of good Italian food. I think of Johnny Carino's. Ugh. Growing up with Sicilians back east, I found the use of a lot of garlic, red pepper and oregano -- hallmarks of Sicilian food and all missing here.   Now we come here every eighteen months or so and for the most part, Carrabba's keeps getting better.  I started off giving Carrabba's One Star five years ago. But last night we enjoyed the updated food menu and our sever Jeff was on top of things. Nice!  Their Chianti Chicken was very tasty and we would recommend it.   Expect to pay $25 each, including one drink, salad, Entrée and taxes, but before gratuities. And ask to sit in Jeff's section, you'll thanks me later!"}
{"text":"Frankly I don't see what all the fuss is about regarding Carrabba's Italian Grill. I took my husband there for his birthday last week. We had been there before but not for quite some time and so we thought we'd try it again. I started off with the Cesar salad which was pretty good but had a bit too much dressing on it. It surprised me with having chopped celery on it which was a real treat and added a nice texture to it. For a main dish I had the Mezzaluna which is a half-moon ravioli with chicken, ricotta and spinach in tomato cream sauce. I could hardly taste either the chicken or the spinach and the cheese was quite overpowering. I regretted allowing them to sprinkle a little parmesan cheese on top because that took it over the top of too cheesy - and normally I love cheese. Then the cream sauce was just too heavy for this dish. It was rather bland and tasteless and really needed some spice. Because it was a birthday they brought one of their small desserts with a candle in it for my husband. It was the banana cream. I thought it was a nice touch and really appreciated they didn't all gather at the table and sing to him. I thought the dessert was creamy without it being too sweet. However when my husband got the bottom where cake was supposed to be it was just powdery so he didn't finish it.   Overall the meal was a bland disappointment and the service was lackluster. The server never came back to refill my water glasses the entire time we were there. With so many other terrific options I won't go back. They claim to \"serve fresh, flavorful Italian dishes prepared from the finest ingredients sourced from around the world.\" Well, I don't know what part of the world they get their ingredients from but they need to try getting them from Italy!"}
{"text":"I came here with my family and Kevin was our server- he was super awesome!   We dined on a Monday and did the 3 course deal for 12.99-18.99 depending on the entree. It comes with soup or salad and an appetizer or dessert. Good food, delicious bread, and amazing service.   My fettuccine weesie was 15.99 and I really enjoyed it. I recommend the strawberry cheesecake, spicy chicken soup, and meatball & ricotta.  Thanks, Kevin for a great dining experience!"}
{"text":"Tried the Pollo Rosa Maria and it was really good. Great flavors with the stuffed fontina & prosciutto. A little salty but the lemon sauce goes very well to balance it. Instead of the side of pasta ordered a side of steamed broccoli. Great dish here!"}
{"text":"Ordered the TAG PIC PAC WITH WOOD-GRILLED CHICKEN from the Amore Mondays special menu. Very tasty. Will definitely order this again in the future.   TAG PIC PAC WITH WOOD-GRILLED CHICKEN Tagliarini pasta with wood-grilled chicken in our Picchi Pacchiu sauce of crushed tomatoes, garlic, olive oil and basil."}
{"text":"I don't know why I don't eat at Carrabbas more often. The food is always prepared well and is extremely flavorable. Service is always attentive - my tea never runs out. And, they don't make a face at me when I ask for butter with their delicious bread."}
{"text":"Spinach dip is amazing. The rest of the menu is on par with olive garden... Its affordable and the place is good for a nice dinner. I wouldn't choose it for an anniversary or special occasion... But date night would be totally fine!"}
{"text":"Have not been here in more than six months.  They made several changes that do not make sense.  Removed the Ricardo Sauce from the menu - so no more calamari with Ricardo.  Also no longer have the Bambini Sundae, a long time favorite of my wife and I.  Loved the chocolate sauce.  The service was great, but running out of reasons to return.  So sad."}
{"text":"Service here on a Saturday was awful! There is only maybe 5 tables in the whole restaurant and it takes 10 minutes to get just even water. Their pizza oven is not working and of course they don't tell you that until after you already ordered an appetizer and want to order a pizza. The peach drink we got was far from peach and they didn't even do anything to fix it other than say it was made in a batch earlier in the day so it could have lost its flavor. At least the food was hot when it came out. I would definitely not come to this one again unless you have time to wait."}
{"text":"Corena is a magician when it comes to preparing catering orders!  We last ordered for a birthday party a few months ago.  I just didn't make time to logon to yelp to finish the review. The options are tasty, compliment one another, and keep our guests, young and old happy.  I highly recommend Carrabba's grilled salmon.  All the pasta dishes I have had have been excellent as well.  The catering staff's supervision is what makes the food just as presentable at home.."}
{"text":"As always, Carrabba's gave my husband and I a wonderful experience. However, this experience was a bit over the top. Our server, Tina was very friendly and efficient waiting our table well with refills of water and bread and great service. Then we had an elderly couple come sit next to us. When Tina came to wait on them she greeted them and asked what they wanted to drink. The older lady immediately said \"I thought I was at Outback.\" At first I thought she was kidding, but she was not. Without missing an beat, Tina responded politely \"You did? Well they are right across from here.\" The elderly couple got up, never apologized and left. Tina handled that very well. She smiled and never used any condescending tone or sarcasm. Tina was great."}
{"text":"Had a takeout order on Mother's Day this year. The order was to take 15 minutes. Instead it took an hour. I understand that at special days like this it can take longer than usual. No problem . The manager comped the order but asked to leave a $20 tip for the hostess because it was not her fault. No problem there either. Got home and opened the containers. Wow! Disappointed doesn't even begin to describe the food I got. Had the chicken Marsala with spaghetti and meat sauce . First off, the Marsala chicken was dry and virtually no sauce . The spaghetti was just that, no sauce and no meat, terrible! Called and spoke with the manager, Nick said he would send a $60 gift card to me for the bad food and he transferred me to someone else who assured me they would send a gift card out for the food. I understand I got credited to begin with and was appreciative about the gesture, problem is, the $20 that was spent, wasn't worth the food I received. So far no gift card. This place has great food and customer service. Just don't order take out! Again, Terrible."}
{"text":"Another great dinner!!! Lasagna, and chicken Parmesan, awesome for both. Great service too! Love this place"}
{"text":"First time here and we all liked our food.  I had spaghetti and meatballs and they did a great job with this dish.  Not too rich but just right for middle of the road spaghetti.  Good bread with their olive oil dipping sauce they created.  Okay wine list for a medium price range selection.  Not fancy but good for an everyday Italian food restaurant."}
{"text":"Carrabba's just flat out sucks.  Growing up north next to all good italian food, there were times where I will still stop in Carraba's.  It always felt like a step above chain restaurants and the food seemed to almost be on the level of a cheesecake factory.  Not so much anymore.  I rather go to Chile's than eat this mess again.  We started with the mixto appetizer ( i know that is not the name ) with the calamari, bruschetta, and mozzie stix.  This was the only thing decent other than the 1 Beer and 1 wine we had.  For the entrees we had the frozen lobster ravioli and the filet covered in goat cheese.  There was more goat cheese than steak and the steak was pretty rare.  Normally I would be all about this, but for such a shitty cut of meat the only thing saving this thing was the goat cheese.  When i recieved my bill for $93 after feeling like my food was  a step below applebee's I wish i had gone somewhere else like Mama Ricottas where I would get 100xs better food and even at a cheaper rate.  Carrabba's what happened to you?  I used to love you and now I know to just 500 ft away like I have a restraining order against you."}
{"text":"We had not been for a while and found they updated their menu, but all our favorites were still there (Chicken Bryan, Marsala steak, chicken parmigiana) and now are offered in two sizes, which is great idea in theory, but paying 2$ less to get half as much chicken parm doesn't seem like a deal. We got the 'full' size and had enough for a whole lunch the next day.  Server, Amad, was great and very attentive without being a hoverer. If I want someone to hover over me, I will call my great aunt Millie.   Made a good suggestion on the larger plate of fried zuchini, it was exactly right for us to share as an appetizer. The dipping sauce that comes with it is PERFECT! It would also be very good with a squeeze of lemon and used on calamari.   I was about ready to make it a 5 star...but being charged 2.50 for a glass of iced tea in the south just rubs me the wrong way. That one charge on our 68$ bill was what rankled me. Even 1.99 I can live with, 2.50 is excessive, IMO. It is plain tea for crying out loud.   Otherwise, it is great!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly delightful!   I appreciate that every item on the menu clearly has the calorie count identified and that the options to mix and match sides are there instead of guessing if the range of 800-1200 calories equates to the side I thought it would as some places now do.   The shrimp and scallop choices are delicious and reasonable in calorie count.    Bread comes with oil and seasoning, you have to ask for butter. I love to make my own compound butter with the seasoning, no oil, and butter. Delicious!  Desserts are too large, we have not ordered one after seeing a caramel and ice-cream monstrosity come out for one person at a nearby table, but they dug in as if it were the best things they had ever tasted.   They have several specials for a limited time on an insert, but I find they often will have the ingredients to make them after those inserts have been refreshed.   Be sure to join their bonus club via the app (also good at sister restaurants such as Flemings and Outback) and get a discount after 3 visits in a few months of time. You can also pay right at the table without your credit card ever leaving your hands on the app, which I really like!  Wait staff can vary in experience, but they are clearly looking for smiling faces because that was all we saw from the time we were seated until we left."}
{"text":"Always a favorite place to go as a chain because of the fettuccine. Better than any other place to date. Also the Chicken Bryan alone is worth coming here for. Smothered in a healthy portion of goat cheese. Not to mentioned cooked with some amazing sauce that blends very well with the goat cheese. Service is always good. I don't understand why these places are not as busy but maybe my taste is not as common...kind of like my taste in music ;)"}
{"text":"Again we were blown away by the great service & food. China was pretty awesome as we were celebrating what we call our Valentine's Day, the day I proposed to my wife, February 16th. We don't go out a ton but at least once a year we go to Carrabba's. Can't wait until next time."}
{"text":"I came in on a Monday for the three course meal.  And it never fails, always delicious.  The fried calamari is fried perfectly and paired with their delicious sauce.  I got a house salad which was very good sized.  Then I got the fettuccine Weesie which had mushroom and shrimp in it.  Everything was delicious!  Also the wine was $5 a glass that night which was an extra bonus.  We always receive excellent service here.  Hadn't been here in a while and I don't know why because the food and service are always so good!"}
{"text":"It had been a few years since our last visit and we got a gift card so thought we'd try again. Now I remember why we hadn't been in so long. The parking lot was crowded and so were the tables. We got seated right away. I was surprised by the decor and condition of the furniture. The chair was wobbly and squeaky when I sat down. I tried another chair and it was just as noisy. It also looked very aged. I'm not sure if that's the look or it's just really worn, I'm thinking really worn. We ordered a beer and cocktail. Beer price was on happy hour still. The bread and seasoned oil were good. We ordered the calamari, which said breaded made to order. I don't know why that mattered because they weren't anything special. Very small pieces of what I'm sure was frozen since they were all similar in size. The  soup and salad were good. The sausage and lentil soup was very flavorful. I ordered the trio chicken combination thinking I'd have leftovers for the next day. My husband ordered a seafood dish. His was flavorful and had a large bowl of pasta. My chicken was a sample of 3 of their chicken dishes. This is what I remembered when I cut into them.. they were dry/overcooked! If they weren't smothered in a sauce I'd have sent it back. It wasn't horrible, but not anything I'd order again. Service was attentive and friendly. We didn't order another drink or dessert. We probably won't return and if we get another gift card we will use it at one of their sister companies."}
{"text":"What happened to my favorite Carrabbas???  Last night was pretty awful.  Granted we haven't been there in a while.  I guess we were spoiled by Ben (one of the many great servers we had in the past).  Servers were either not happy or not trained.  I am guessing both.....It was the worst service we have received in YEARS.  The restaurant only had a handful of tables.  Our server ONLY had us and he was no where in sight.  He NEVER came out to ask how our food was.  Good thing we ordered a bottle of wine!!  Our small plate meatballs were cold...are they supposed to be, they came out in a cast iron dish???  They were refrigerator cold inside and room temp on the outside--weird.  There is no more fresh shredded Parmesan....Kraft like Romano spooned onto your plate from a small white dish.  Bones in the Mama Mendola's chicken soup.  On the lighter side, my Chicken Marsala was still as tasty and the wine we chose was good....LOL!  I think this is the FIRST one star I have ever given......    :("}
{"text":"Food was great and service was even better.  Ordered food to go online. We show up and due to our error our order hadn't been fully submitted. They were awesome about getting our order in right away and pushing it quickly in the kitchen. They brought bread and drinks to our car while we waiting the 20 minutesfor our food to cook which I feel was really above and beyond. After our food arrived we tried to leave but our battery had died! While we waited for someone to come jump our car the manager Gizelle came out to check on us. She insisted that we take our food inside and dine there however I was in gym clothes and didn't feel comfortable with that. she then set up a table on the patio and insisted we move there. It could have been a really terrible night with the bad luck we were having but we ended up having a nice dinner on the patio thanks to the awesome staff.  The food was also amazing! The wings and meat balls for an appetizer were great. My favorite was the chicken bryan entree. There was also a mushroom chicken entree which was good but if you like goat cheese you must try chicken bryan."}
{"text":"I ordered the pork chop Marsala, and it was very good. The chop itself was pretty tender and the sauce was very good. The mushrooms just topped it off, so delicious. The broccoli was great and the Italian chicken noodle signature soup was very nice as well. The staff were nice and our waiter explained everything into really deep... deep detail, which was nice so you could really understand what you were ordering. I would definitely have another visit to a Carrabbas restaurant!"}
{"text":"This location was my first and only Carraba's experience.  The staff were really friendly and attentive. Our waiter was very nice and checked in frequently. There was no wait on a weekend night - weird but good.   The decor was nice but kinda seemed like a knock off of Olive Garden. The food was exceptionally lack-luster. I had penne pasta, which was under seasoned and had no color. Even a basil garnish would have been something.  The location and people were nice, but the prices were too high for average (maybe below?) food. I would go to an Olive Garden or Macaroni Grill if you're looking for Italian in a similar price range. Everything was fine, but maybe the kitchen needed a pep talk."}
{"text":"I have been visiting this location for over 3 years and never had an issue till the last two visits. The previous time I came in this new staff had just started. The manager, and assistant manager were previously both either black or brown. Now the only staff they have now are white from Chad up too all managers. My husband (he is disabled) we  came in because their soup helps with his digestion. We ordered 2 bowls of soup and 2 ice teas with simple syrup. That's when Jesse the proprietor showed up at our tables.  I told him I've been coming to this location for at least 3 years where is the other manager. He claimed he fired the black guy cause he was cheating them out of money and the rest of the staff where Hispanic, their also gone. I found that odd, then he personally told me that if I wanted sweetener I had to pay for it. I had never heard of that but went along with it until the bill reached my table. He wanted $5.00 a glass for simple syrup?!? I asked for them to send him back over. I asked him about this amount he claimed it was a new policy. I told him I wanted his bosses information and his name and I would report him. He then told me he would take it off the bill and in the future I had to pay for it.   That day I called Bobby, a regional manger and he told me under no circumstances was I to be charged for sweetener. And he would talk to him to address this situation. He also said to keep my business he would pay for my husband and I when we decide to go back.   Well I took him up on that offer maybe 9 months later cause the people really rubbed me the wrong way. They cut their whole diverse team and now it's only white people at the front of the house and the Hispanics are in the back inside the kitchen where you can't see them unless you go back in that direction.   I went this past Tuesday and was greeted by Julie and her smile went from that to a frown. And as she seated us she asked did we need anything I told her to call Jessie over if he's here. She said he wasn't here and what was the issue. I told her he owes us a meal and we had come to collect. She said she will look into it, she came back and said she spoke to Jessie after him speaking to Bobby. And they can issue me 1 free meal and they still have to charge us for simple syrup. I told her this couldn't be true, she said give her a few more mins. She came back and said she spoke to Bobby and that was correct. I asked for her name. That's when she went off, and I quote. \"Why do you come here, you don't like the people and seem to not like the establishment.\" And ask I told her she and the whole new crew is just that new. Prior to this new crew I didn't feel like it was discrimination. After speaking to you and hearing you I know it's discrimination. So as we are speaking Chad (a key manager)walks up, he said we have to charge you for the sweetener because we spend $15 on the bottle. I told him that's the cost of doing business. I'm the customer and when you start telling customers you don't want their business because of the color of their skin. It's feels horrible and the price of syrup don't have anything to do with it. Don't go here if your brown, black, or different they don't welcome us at all and make up their on rules as they see fit."}
{"text":"I know Carabbas is a chain restaurant but I don't care their Chicken Bryant is spectacular. As long as this stays on their menu I will come back time and time again. If you haven't tried it then give it a try. You will thank me. Yummy!!!!!"}
{"text":"Restaurant is very nice and service is good. Food is chain Italian but far better than Olive Garden. Reservations recommended during normal busy times. Try the creamy parm dressing to dip the bread in. Also sitting at the pizza bar is always good for a show. All the desserts are very tasty"}
{"text":"Went here for a family gathering and was delightfully surprised how nice the place was. The food was good and the service was on par. You're paying for it though. At least you know you'll be getting adequate service and good food if nothing else!"}
{"text":"Amazing food & service.  It was truly a five-star experience.  I've never had a bad experience at Carrabba's.  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I went there this evening, staff members looked at me standing there and no one acknowledged me.  Real polite.  You guys just lost yourself three potential customers.  If you actually want your restaurant to seem inviting, actually give a darn."}
{"text":"We have to eat here at least two times a month.. still working through the menu. Have not been disappointed so far. Looking forward to try something new next!!"}
{"text":"Ate here last night for our 40th anniversary mainly because our granddaughter was with us!   Started out with one waiter who asked us if we were celebrating anything of which we told him.  He said \"oh I'll bring you a nice surprise after your meal!\" Then he came to the table and told us he was being relieved.  The new waitress came and was very pleasant.  He must not have mentioned the occasion, as she was totally unaware.   Now mind you the restaurant was NOT crowded and it took forever to get our food - appetizer were even slow arriving.  Over an hour later we were finally eating.  My husband's steak was honestly not edible.  My fish was overcooked and dry.  The lasagna was decent - and my daughter's chicken was just okay.  We only chose this place for the variety of menu choices. The mgr took the steak off the bill - offered to make him something else but at that point it was almost 2 hours into the meal.  He didn't even eat the potatoes!  That is rare! We have eaten here several times, but honestly don't think we will be going back.  Too many places to eat around us that are better than this.  Sorry we chose this place for this occasion!"}
{"text":"Went to Carrabas last Thursday.  Been there many times but haven't gone in a few months...  I don't know what has happened to this place!  We were served the food and I noticed that the sauce on my plate was runny.  I've had this dish before and the sauce never looked like that, it was pretty bland and tasteless too.  Ok, not the best but it was edible and I decided I wouldn't order that dish again.  But when my boyfriend ate his pork chop he realized that 1/2 of it was raw.  RAW.  Ever seen a seared tuna steak?  The outside just lightly charred and the inside still almost cold.  That's what this looked like.  The manager was called over and he said \"well the lighting in here is pretty bad, but we can cook this a little more and bring it back for you to take home.\" Really?  You want to reheat a piece of undercooked raw pork that has been sitting on the plate for more than 10 minutes and send it home in a doggy bag?  Obviously he needs to re-take his food handlers class!  My boyfriend denied the re-heating because well, common sense, and said he wasn't in the mood for anything else.  The manager came back and apologized saying he looked at the plate when he took it back and one side of the pork chop was completely raw.  We were given a $25 gift card and a free appetizer when we go back...  The problem is, when you are served raw pork and THE MANAGER obviously doesn't know proper food handling, you won't go back.  We liked this place a long time ago but it needs to be shut down.  The waitresses were talking among themselves at the bar about how slow service has been lately...  Gee, I can't see why!  Gross!"}
{"text":"I love the bread dipped in olive oil. I call it Italian butter. Not a long wait tonight cute little corner table. The service was wonderful and our dinner was the perfect temperature and tasted great."}
{"text":"I'm 0 for 2 on curbside at this location, and won't be ordering here again even though I live less than a mile away. This time they decided to give me chicken marsala when I ordered the Pollo Rosa Maria, totally wrong entree. They also did not include the bread and plastic ware even though I requested it, and forgot my extra salad dressing that I clearly noted on my order. Last time they gave me zucchini fritte instead of zucchini stefano, and again forgot the bread and ware. I'm not sure why this is so hard for them, I will not be back."}
{"text":"This was my first time dining here. The bread was very good. I ordered the Fettuccine Carrabba which is their version of a chicken alfredo. It was just okay. The alfredo sauce is a little bland and too cheesy for my taste.  The server was fantastic. He was very friendly, kept the refills coming on time and was accommodating to my special requests. Will probably return to try another dish because the service was excellent."}
{"text":"@Russell M, I couldn't disagree with you enough. Microwave? No way, food was very very good. From the moment we walked into this restaurant last night we were happy with everything these folks did. This was our first time at a Carrabbas restaurant and we are now fans.   Well organized, very professional, and we noticed a working manager. Seldom to you see a restaurant manager doing every role and willing to assist where needed.   Our drinks from the bar were top notch as was the food. We will return just as soon as we can. Very satisfied customer."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I received a gift card for his birthday and came here immediately ! Wow what an amazing experience we had. Beautiful Taylor was our waitress , ( I hope that was her name she had beautiful red long hair ) and an amazing personality. She was excellent at service, most definitely has people skills to make the customers feel comfortable, with her great vibes. Fiancé ordered the giant meatball and ate every single bit, I had something else but the appetizer was filling for my little self & I absolutely enjoyed the Sicilian spicy chicken soup. Definitely will not only come back, but recommended family & friends !!"}
{"text":"Really just not Impressed anymore. Carabas used to be soo good but now everything tastes salty and processed. I went here for a date about 3 months ago and probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Walked in on a Saturday night around 8-830... they asked if a table was ok... we asked how long of a wait for a booth (while looking at two open booths... one dirty and one clean and ready)... the \"hostess\" said \"I don't know... I guess until someone finishes..\" we asked why we couldn't sit on the open booth... she said because that server was cut(?).... we asked if they were serious about losing our business because of their server issues (the place was not packed)... they asked if we wanted to wait... we said no and left....called management to advise them about their atrocious service...who apologized and asked that we return and give them another chance.... we accepted reluctantly.... the little Hostess girls were so shitty I wasn't inclined to return period... will update this after the next experience."}
{"text":"I'm going to give them 5 stars despite finding hair in my food....came here to celebrate my daughters 20th birthday and found a piece of hair in my food. I alerted the waiter who in turn advised the manager. She came over to our table and apologized profusely. I understand sometimes these things happen and it's upsetting but how the staff handles it can be all the difference. Not only did she take the meal off of our final bill but she threw in dessert for me. Love this place!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious for an italian restaurant but what made them stand out was the customer service! our waiter went above and beyond to make our night perfect by splitting our food into 2 placed for us so we didn't have to. we weren't too hungry so we only ordered an entree but the bread and the oil helped fill us up.   our meal came with a salad as well, so our waiter divided it up for us then when our meal came out, it was divided into separate plates as well. the sides that came with out food was enough to fill us up too!   all in all we will be coming back here as their customer service was amazing and their food was better than other italian chain restaurants. the place was also nice and clean"}
{"text":"If I could give them 0 stars, I would.  We went here for my daughter's birthday.  I ordered the chicken trio off of the gluten free menu with sauteed spinach as a side, my friend ordered the pollo Sorrento, my children ordered the spaghetti with meatball and cheese pizza.  The chicken dishes were so salty, they could not be eaten.  The spinach, which was said to be sauteed in olive oil and garlic was lightly wilted on top, completely soggy on the bottom and there was no garlic at all.  When talking to the waitress, I tried to explain that a lot of chicken is injected with a 2% saline solution to aid in flavor, and you need to lessen the amount of salt added to it to keep it from getting too salty.  She got the manager, and the manager misunderstood, thinking we were saying THEY injected the chicken with saline (read the package of the chicken you buy, a lot of commercial chicken is this way).  My youngest barely touched her pizza, but my oldest (birthday girl) enjoyed her spaghetti.  They enjoyed the birthday dessert.  The manager and server were nice about everything, and it wasn't their fault the food was not good.  They had a pretty good gluten free menu, and 2 options for dessert, which is more than a lot of places have."}
{"text":"Went here last night. Food wasn't great, really what you would expect from a place like this. There was a clothing plastic tag in my salad. They comped my meal. The waiter was a good guy. Great bread, I'll give them that."}
{"text":"Went in for an early dinner.  Food was good.  Sitting next to table after table of ill behaved children was not.  Can't really fault the restaurant for that but I wish they would pay attention to that when seating people.  If you have a couple seated don't put the Duggars next to them.  I'm dinging you 2 stars for removing Blue Bell from the menu.  Not cool."}
{"text":"Our group of 4 went at 630pm on a Saturday night and waited 1 hour after we were told 30 mins. Not horrible because we went to the bar and had a few drinks in the meantime.  The service was pretty good, the server was nice and you could tell all the servers were  busy running around.  The food: it was good, but considering it was more expensive than traditional Italian resturants, I expected it to be better. My lasagna was not hot when it was delivered to the table, which sucked. Overall, I would visit this place again, but not during busy hours."}
{"text":"This establishment has a fun atmosphere, but the waiting times on Saturdays are at least 1.5-2 hours long. We decided to come on a Sunday evening around 5 pm. There weren't a lot of people , but the food took almost 45 mins-1 hr long to receive and we were sitting right in front of the kitchen!"}
{"text":"Tonight was my husband's birthday and we went to Carraba's.  We were taken in quickly and our server, Ryan took excellent care of us.  We have a habit of asking advise from our servers and Ryan did his job well and advised us on the right things to order.  Years ago Carrabba's was good at giving a drink or dessert (or something) for special events and unfortunately they don't do that any more.  I don't know if that is going to effect us in the future, but they haven't done anything special for some time.  But on the other hand, our dinner was served quickly and both of our meals were really good.  Our server was the one that really made the night special by treating us like WE were special."}
{"text":"Going to Carrabbas is like going visit an Italian friend that knows his stuff. Lots of garlic and bold flavors, and all the staff ready to assist with a smile. Their sauces, like the fig sauce and lemon butter capers sauce compliments every meal. Yum! Love the location and the car side carry out.  Its just good stuff."}
{"text":"This was our favorite Italian food restaurant as far a chains go.  But with the new menu change seemed the prices have gone up and the portions smaller.  The quality of the meal was not good this time.  The Chicken Parm used to be enough for two meals w/ fettuccine Alfredo as a side, the chicken was so thin it was almost see through. My husband got the Chicken Bryan and ordered the larger size, one breast.  Would hate to see what the smaller one consisted of.  But was very tasty.  I guess we will try it again in the future, but will try to find a Mom and Pops place with better quality."}
{"text":"I'm usually impartial to chains but this place is sweet. The staff is extremely helpful and nice. Food is good--chicken fettuccine alfredo=ballin. Great pasta in general. They even gave us a fresh basket of bread to pack up and take home with us."}
{"text":"We keep coming back here for the excellent customer service, quality meals in each course and nice atmosphere in Summerlin.  This Carraba's is always the homeship restaurant my Mom selects for our night out.  First off, the homemade sweet Italian bread slices servced with Italian spices drenched in olive oil gets the palata going.  Then, the next step, the delicious house salad with house dressing is always tasty and has a taste of anchovy and olives in in it -- very tasty.  The soup option, the minnestrone, our choice with the cabbage and fresh vegetables. The entrees are amazing.  I've been hooked on the balsamic tiliapia with fresh basil and grilled cherry tomotoes and request a side of angel hair with pomodoro sauce (red veggie).  My mom loves the salmon with delicious butter and garlic sauce and her angel hair with a similiar sauce.  The decor reminds me of a Napa vineyard, and the service is always great.  Tthank you Carraba's for many family filled memories and years of delicious food!"}
{"text":"being from Nj my standards are high for Italian food in AZ .. most times I cook it my self but when I do go out for it Carrabbas is on the list! Great service, good portions, and pretty good food!"}
{"text":"Very good! We had zucchini fries as an appetizer and they came with a rich delicious garlic sauce.  Husband had chicken parm and broccoli and I had a Caesar salad with chicken that was outstanding. We had the chocolate brownie for dessert, brownie portion was OK, chocolate topping was great. Our waiter was Christian and he was phenomenal!! He was so mannerly and efficient and kept bringing me teas which makes him #1 in my book!  Very professional."}
{"text":"COCKROACH!  Oh, Carraba's.  I've always like their food and their service, but don't have the stomach to ever return to this location.  On my recommendation, the family came here for my mother's bday dinner in mid-July.  (Luckily) before our food arrived, something caught my eye on the half wall directly above the infant carrier.  In the middle of the restaurant at peak dining time, there was a roach.  I pulled the carrier away quickly and my fiance killed it with a napkin.  Roaches are possibly the most disgusting thing on the planet that I can think of.  I may have a roach phobia, if that's possible.  Anyway, we discreetly told the server who, to his credit, was incredibly alarmed and handled it beautifully.  He immediately went to his manager (we watched).  That's when it went wrong.  We waited for probably 10-15min for the manager to come over.  He followed protocol and told us our entire table tab is free.  He also offered to still serve us our food or send it home with us.  Uh, no thanks.  But then he asked for an address, giving the reason that the pest control company likes to contact us when this occurs.  This made us wonder about the frequency of this occurrence, so we asked him if this happens often.  If there is a time to lie buddy, it's now, but I'm not sure he did.  He said, \"Well I don't want to say it's often, but it does happen.\"  Then he followed it up with a list of reasons why it happens---they come in on the boxes, etc.  This didn't make the situation better.  Then he told us they usually only see the roaches when they turn the lights on in the kitchen.  I know restaurant kitchens usually have some roaches and it's a controlled situation, but he made it sound like Joe's Apartment, and this roach didn't even talk to me.  To finish this long story, I purposely waited to write this review to see if the pest control company would contact us.  We never heard from Carraba's again or their mystery pest control company, and a roach out in the middle of a bunch of people in the early evening is a sign that there are probably many many more everywhere else.  Too bad for the servers of Carraba's--they really are top notch.  We moved nearby to Charleston's, and they were so good they gained our repeat business."}
{"text":"This place is always so attentive. Have been coming here for years and Danny is great! He is friendly and always smiling! The food is the best! With Martin behind the line you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Service was excellent...ate at the bar and the bartender was polite, knowledgeable on the menu items...atmosphere was inviting. Had the linguine postino with chicken, it was perfect!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were looking for a place to have a nice lunch on a Saturday afternoon. We both decided to go to Carrabas, since the last time we had Carrabas we were living in Colorado. We were greeted with a friendly staff member, and we were seated right away. Our waiter Mike was awesome! He kept our lunch experience entertaining and our drinks to the rim. We started with the Tomato Caprese with Fresh Burrata as an appetizer. Can I say, OMG!  This was 'so' delicious,  the fresh Burrata was so smooth and creamy. We decided to have the Margherita pizza.  The manager came to our table to deliver our pizza, because the pizza had a couple of oven burnt ends. He apologized for the pizza and if we wanted he would have another pizza made for us. We were okay with the pizza, honestly I hadn't even noticed the burnt ends. The manager extended his apologies again and said he would comp our appetizer. We had a great lunch and outstanding service. The next time we go back, we will definitely ask to be seated in Mike's section."}
{"text":"I have not been to Carabba's in over 4 years and I am kicking myself now! We had a wonderful dinner and would eat here again in a heartbeat! Very friendly and professional staff from the beginning to the end. Started off with fried zucchini appetizer, it was fried light and crispy with fresh zucchini, not frozen. Then we had Caesar salad and all 3 of us each ordered Marsala. One chicken, one sirloin and one pork chop. Lucky for me I was able to taste test each one and picking a favorite would be impossible. Fresh sautéed green beans as well, where do you ever get that? There is a unique divineness on the grilled meat, possibly hickory? I am a fan. Let me tell you about the delectable dessert with vanilla ice cream (I wouldn't be surprised if they made it fresh), caramel and these cinnamon coated walnuts? WOW. Diet? What diet? I went to a parallel universe while that graced my lips. The pace of meal was perfect, never feeling rushed and even the manager stopped by for a visit. I must say for a chain restaurant this topped my charts, completely blew past the Odive Marden....? Just can't remember the name of that place anymore....hmmm. One other point is that I wouldn't say the portions are HUGE like most cheap chain restaurants, but I still left completely full and not grossed out stuffed. I HATE that feeling from cheap over processed food."}
{"text":"Two drinks were 1/2 the dinner bill!  We have not been to Carrabbas for a couple of years and we always liked it, so we thought we'd go for a nice dinner for two. It was not happy hour, but I had a scotch and my wife had a glass of wine. Our two entrees were chicken dishes, which were very good. But the salads (that come with the dinner) were very skimpy & disappointing. But shocker was the bill. It turned out that the two drinks were half of the bill!. I was shocked and I had the server check the charges. She did and insisted they were correct. The scotch was a single pour Glenlivet. The glass of wine was a Rufino Chianti. Nothing super special. But the two drinks together were over $26! You wouldn't even pay that much in a fancy nightclub!  Clearly Carrabbas is price gouging with their drink prices, but they are over-estimating thier value. $73 for two chicken dishes and two drinks? This is not Ruths Chris! I for one won't be going back there."}
{"text":"the question is would i go back and i must say i would we just had a few apps and a salad half order of  calamari done in the usuall deep fried manner it  was good and had a little spicey bite to them we also had the full order od mussels and a great salad with grilled eggpland a nutty coatted and fried piece of goat cheese kalamata olives ect bread was served warm with a herb mixure on a plate ...just add olive oil ....oh and of course i had to try the meatballs as i always say mine are better but these werent bad the martinis are fair but very reasonably priced 6.50 and we had a pitcher of wine the monteplacino de abruzza a nice house wine....and our server was pleasant and attentive as was the rest of the staff i wanted to give 3 stars but if you add all the components together for a busy saturday nite things were well done :)"}
{"text":"Outstanding food, super service, great atmosphere! This is our go to place. Danny is our favorite waiter.  Always on his game knowledgable of the menu & his service is spot on!"}
{"text":"Management needs to read this! Showed up at 7pm for a 7:30 reservation.  Left at 8:10 with no end of waiting in sight. Terrible experience.  Thanks Carrabba's for making my son's graduation night extra memorable."}
{"text":"Excellent service! I never would have been able to stop eating/drinking because there was always more placed in front of me. Delicious chicken Parmigiana, cooked wonderfully and lots of flavor. No complaints at all."}
{"text":"Great Italian! LOVE the complimentary pre-meal bread and rosemary oil! Chicken Parm is to DIE for. Pasta Weesie good as well."}
{"text":"I don't know why but for some reason they like to load up their soups and entries with salt."}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant. Stan was our waiter, and he was great, knew the menu very well. I had the prosciutto wrapped pork tenderloin and it was so perfectly done, I will absolutely return to have this again. I'm here for work, and will make several trips here during my stay. Awesome place, and affordable for the quality of food!"}
{"text":"Pretty good for a Natl chain.  This is the 3rd location I have been to. Friendly servers and pretty good cooks. Vegas is a great town for food so you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong here if you like italian... the Chicken Bryan  is incredible... I usually get that.. but... tonight I opted for lasagne.. Yummy! Delicious!  My husband enjoyed his Veal Marsale as well. Great food.. Great service.. We had Zack and he was effecient and helpful and fun!"}
{"text":"This is our first time here but we will be back. The waiter Cory was so personable and on the ball. Then there was the food. I have eaten all of these things before but they never tasted like this. The seasoning was awesome on all of the food but the wood burning flavor to the steak was to die for. Now the one thing I have to say that is disparaging is that they don't know what well done is but I took the first bite and then finished the redest steak I have ever eaten and loved it."}
{"text":"My family and I went for dinner after a busy Saturday, and we had a very good meal! My youngest son ate two servings of ravioli (his favorite) the service was very good as well!"}
{"text":"What is up with the host's lately in restaurants. They have zero personality and really don't set a great first impression. Anyhow lets get to food and service. Carol is great and really overcomes the original impression left by the podium guards. We ordered a tomatoe caprisi appetizer and it was excellent!  A new variation on a classic. Tomatoes are spread out on the plate and has chopped tomaroes spread around. The new addition to this classic is fresh red onion and then a balsamic reduction and fresh basil. I could eat this dish as an main course but I don't have that much restraint. I orderes pasta franco and it was very food. The combination of olives artichoke hearts and sundried tomatoe makes this dish a little salt towards the end but it wasn't unexpected. I would order it again.  Carol Is very attentive but never pushy and you should definitely ask for her. We don't dine here often enough but we will remedy that."}
{"text":"I had ordered on the phone for my order to go. When I picked my order up it was fast. So when I got home I could not believe the small portions that was in the the bag. I had ordered the penne franco  and the Italian classics dishes. For the amount they charge it is a ripoff. My strong suggestion is to head over to Romano's Macaroni Grill. Much more worth it."}
{"text":"Went there tonight (Sunday) for dinner.  Waiter was the problem.  He spoke so fast I made him repeat everything he said. He seemed to get miffed at that.  When our food came he was there 3 seconds later and asked if it was hot enough.  I looked at him and said \"we just got it 3 seconds ago, I don't know yet\", he said \"oh\" and walked away,  we didn't see him for 20 minutes.  I got the feeling he wanted us to just leave so he could wait on someone else. And, yes the food was hot.  Although the broccoli wasn't cooked.  Otherwise the food was ok.  Atmosphere ok.  Don't feel compelled to go back, and probably won't."}
{"text":"So went to eat here when I seen a sign saying no fire arms in side.  So these guys don't support the second amendment.  If they could 100% guarantee my family safety then I would go.  Yet they have no security guard.  So someone who doesn't respect that rule ( bad guy). Who might get drunk.  Yet the guy with a CCW does the right thing.  He could be screwed.  I am done with people not supporting our rights."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place 0 stars. The pace of this place is just beyond slow. We stood at the front waiting area for a good 4/5 mins while employees walked right in front of the podium without acknowledging us. As for my last review was the last time we had been in, can't recall the date but last night my husband suggested it and we decided to give it a go. Maybe things are better right? Wrong again! It's just bad!! My husband and I both ordered a ceaser salad to start out with and our entrees was a bowl of their chicken Sicilian soup. Our salads were good but not sure how you could mess that up. Anyway. Soups arrive and I start cooling off the soup with my spoon. As I mix around the chicken I notice some of my chicken is slightly pink. No big deal, take that chunk out onto side plate. As I do this a couple more times I notice it has a handful of raw chicken. I mean bloody, red and pink chicken. Gross!!! Before my husband takes a bite I tell him not to eat it because my chicken is raw. He starts looking around in his and same, very bloody pieces of chicken.  My question how does the cook shredding the chicken NOT notice that? Absolute carelessness that could potentially get someone very sick.    We wave our waitress down and let her know the problem with the chicken. She proceeds to take the plate full of raw chicken and says she will bring the manager right over. A couple minutes later she comes back and says well the manager took that off the bill. (Seriously!) The manager doesn't stop by at any point to apologize or offer us something else. Nothing. Nada. Zero. At this point I'm more than anything concerned that someone might not notice and eat it.   I've worked in the restaurant business for a decade so I know things happen but this was not just a cold plate or wrong order. You are serving raw food.    The second we leave, I call Carrabbas and ask for their managers name and call their customer service number to notify them of the incident.   This happened on Sunday early evening with two managers on the floor and neither of them found it important enough to address. That's a problem."}
{"text":"They really focous on the grill part. The meul is full of griled chicken, meat and a fish item. There also are pizzas and pastas.  My main grip with this place i having highly adulterated dishes, go to italy and fettuccine Alfredo means, noodles and sauce, no chicken. The theme is carries out thought the menu, in a poor attempt to seem original lobster, sausage or chicken is added to most traditional dishes.  This left me a vegetarian with only a few choices, I went with the Grilled salmon (no sauce) with the garlic mashed potato. The salmon was a  standard farm raised variety and typically over cooked for my tastes. The potatoes were decent as enough garlic and butter can make anything good. ($17)  I did like the bread here but that is not enough of a reason to get me back. A long wait for mediocre Salmon at a less than stellar price."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for the first time last night for our anniversary, but it won't be the last. We had the best experience. The hostess was friendly and sat us immediately. The decor was very nice. Our server was Maggie, she was amazing. She was so patient with us, explaining the different wines and brought a few samples for us to try. She was very attentive with refilling our water and anything else we may need. At the end of our meal, she brought out a complementary dessert with congrats written in chocolate on the plate. She took our picture for us and took care of packing up our leftovers. The food was not only amazing, but they had a variety of gluten free options, including minestrone soup and alfredo pasta. I had a hard time choosing, so I got the trio. It reminded me of a gluten free version of the tour of Italy from Olive Garden. Also, Olive Garden does not have this many gluten free options. I think Carrabas is even better'as.far.as.the gluten free food. The Rosa Regale sparkling wine was amazing. My only complaint here is  that the bathroom is located near the breakroom(with no door on the breakroom), which I could clearly hear the employees talking. One girl was in there with a couple guys saying she should quit her job so that she could hang out with them outside of work, REALLY?? Overall, our experience was the absolute best. Maggie, thank you so much! This girl should get a raise!"}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant for the first time yesterday. Took a party of 7. The ticket wasn't as high as I thought it was going to be. The food was amazing, definitely worth the money. The portions were fair, the drinks menu had a good selection to fit all kinds of people's tastes. The building was clean and well put together inside and out. And the staff was amazing! Definitely recommend this place for a family lunch or dinner get together."}
{"text":"I had never been to Carrabba's, but I had heard they were good. My family and I went in on a Friday night and they were fairly busy but we got a seat quickly. Our server was sweet and got ussituated with my children in a booth, we use a high chair so it was in the way of the aisle as people were walking by. I felt like I was apologizing all night for this. As we sat down they were seating a family near us in another booth, the members of the family were bigger people and the booth proved to be uncomfortable for them and they asked for a table and were seated at a table, about 5 min later same person comes up with another family of bigger people, same thing...do they not GET that big people are NOT fitting in this booth? This happened one other time at this booth before they got smaller people in there. When our food finally came (about 30 min later) it was \"meh\" to say the least...the kids meals were water-y pasta sauce with one tiny meatball. My husband's order was messed up and the waitress looked like she was going to cry, so I am not sure how they treat the staff over errors like that but by her reaction...not good. My husband just ate what he got. I order kabobs and for 17.00 I got six, dice size pieces of steak )that were SO tough I couldn't cut them with the knife they gave me) and 4  1/2 grape tomatoes and a couple pieces of onion. The ONLY reason I am giving this 2 stars is the waitress was SO sweet and kind and attentive! Otherwise I would have  given it just one based on everything else.  Bottom line, if you are desperate....get a can of chef boyarde! I would be more pleasant than Carrabbas!"}
{"text":"Ambiance: 4 - The environment was okay, nothing really special. But what I do like a lot about this place was there was room between a table.   Service: 5 - Our waitress was incredibly sweet. She was very patient with us when it came to ordering and splitting the checks.  Food: 3 - The food was alright. I ordered pasta and it tasted like every other pasta at any Italian restaurant. Also, every dish on the menu was overpriced by a few dollars. The pricing was mainly my reason for the 3 stars.   Overall I give this place 3 stars. It was nice eating here, but I most likely wouldn't come back here just because of the price."}
{"text":"Not really impressed with the food here. The service is just so-so.   Came here in February with my boyfriend. I ordered the shrimp risotto and he ordered a pizza. Came out in a timely fashion, but the taste was very very subpar. My boyfriend seemed to enjoy his pizza, but the major downfall of the meal was the shrimp risotto. The shrimp had a fishy taste to it (not altogether too normal), and the risotto was overcooked and mushy. The sauce also was very sweet, which was unappealing to the palette, especially when combined with fishy-tasting shrimp and mealy risotto.   The only thing I really, truly enjoyed was the complimentary bread before the meal which is served hot and with extra virgin olive oil and a cracked pepper seasoning. That's about it.   Overall, the meal was not worth $50.. Won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"The food is great, but the service leaves a lot to be desired. I particularly dislike it when the hostess says \"How are we doing tonight\"? Then the server says \"what would we like to eat tonight?\" when he come back to take the order.  That's so rude and condescending. We got the bum's rush as far as service is concerned. We were in and out in 35 minutes! I never got offered a refill on my iced tea either! Next time I am going to one of the independent Italian restaurants in town."}
{"text":"Have eaten here quite a bit lately food has always been absolutely delicious last time service was only ok"}
{"text":"Ahhhh... Do you hear them?  The angels?  They're singing the praises of Chicken Bryan.  Now, I don't know who Bryan is, but he  knows exactly how to make some seriously good chicken!  I was actually really upset with Carrabba's as a chain for a while.  They used to have these wonderful, lovely croutons, but suddenly changed the recipe.  I even wrote to them about it, and they were like.. \"well, our test groups liked these new ones better, sorry\".  It took me a bit to get over it.  Those were some seriously good croutons!  I recovered, however, and continued to enjoy one of my favorite dishes ever created.  (Yes, the chicken bryan)  There are actually many wonderful dishes on their menu.  Their pasta dishes are unique, not your typical Italian chain fare.  There's also a wonderful special that shows up every now and then.. Trout Wulfe.  Delicate trout fillet lightly fried then topped with a lemony basil and tomato butter sauce.  Very delicious!  This location has a nice staff.  I've been a regular here for several years and see lots of familiar faces.  They make a really good pomegranate martini and if you manage to have room, the dessert rosa is delightful.  As chains go, Carrabba's does it right.  Definitely worth a stop."}
{"text":"I've been to a number of Carabba's without being disappointed, and my visits to this location have been no exception.  A popular place, but a great spot for a restaurant and the service has been really good.  Carabba's also has one of my all-time favorite Italian dishes: Chicken Bryan, which forges chicken, sun-dried tomatoes and some kind of interesting cheese on top of a bed of pasta.   Absolutely magnificent!"}
{"text":"First timers! Wanted to try a place we never been and so glad we ended up here. Our server was Brittney M and she was amazing. Very attentive, super sweet, knowledgeable and more. The food was delicious, priced well and if you sign up for there dine in rewards after 3 you get 50% off."}
{"text":"Service was just shy of meeting my expectations. Went in on a Thursday not very busy so was seated right away.  Food was mediocre for the price."}
{"text":"We went here on X-mas eve.  We have been coming here for just over a year now and have been pleased with everything, for the most part.  But our most recent visit was poor.  We we're seated in a drafty corner by the bar.  The calamari was so salted, it was inedible. The worst part is.... since coming here the menu has been gradually shrinking.  And, with our recent visit, none of our favorites were on the menu. (Mine was the lobster mac).  Chicken soup is the only plus they still had."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Italian restaurants! The service is always fantastic. The bread is served warm with olive oil and herb dipping sauce that I rate a 10, & our favorite appetizer is the fried calamari. The atmosphere is energetic & it makes for a great date night out!"}
{"text":"Good place for casual italian food. reasonable prices and service."}
{"text":"It was ok... Can't say I would ever recommend it or even go back.  Service was poor our group of four girls had a coupon and our waitress looked disgusted at us.  Food was nothing special.  Environment seemed more family friendly.  Would never recommend for a date night.  Only positive was it's close to home.  I would say pass on this place if you had a choice but... If it's free take it.  Lol. FYI always coupons online. Just search the internet."}
{"text":"The food is great and so is the atmosphere.  Some food comes out cold or too hot. I love how the lights dim when it gets late. The food is reasonably priced"}
{"text":"Well my date and I were looking for some dependable and reasonably priced Italian that was nearby for dinner before we headed over to 316 and we ended up at Carrabba's. While it may not have been my first choice given the local Italian dining that can be found throughout the city, I felt like it was a decent enough experience and cheaper than a lot of options in uptown.  The place's atmosphere was warm and cozy, but feeling a little empty. Maybe because it was a Tuesday night and dead empty. Now this usually either means you might either get an overly attentive waiter or one that's in a bit of a sulky mood due to not making much for the night. To my surprise our waiter did neither, other than some light banter while we were ordering and some timely water refills he left us alone to enjoy our meal.  This is the part where I wish I had ordered differently or had bothered to comment on the food. The bread that comes out before the meal has a nice toasty crust and soft chewy inside that was spectacular dipped into the seasoned evoo. But then my main course came and I was really disappointed. I had ordered a baked pasta dish with chicken and was thinking the pasta would be a lot more cooked. I don't see how my stuffed baked pasta came out being very al dente to be generous. Man biting into that thing all I could taste was disappointment and the sadness of undercooked pasta. I could see if the restaurant was packed, but if it's empty you should take a bit of time and make sure the dish comes out alright. To be fair though the waiter noticed that I barely touched my food while my date had finished his whole plate and inquired about it, but before I could voice a bit of criticism my date was already saying something about how I'm tiny and don't eat a lot. So I just left it at that.  When we were leaving the extremely grumpy hostess wished us goodbye in a distant \"I don't care\" tone. As I left still a bit hungry, I marveled at how even a chain restaurant can provide inconsistent food/service sometimes. Maybe I'll be back when it's convenient, but I do know it sure won't be with a knowitall for a date!"}
{"text":"Good for Sunday Lunch but be prepared to wait awhile.  It's been awhile since we visited Carrabba's either for lunch or dinner so we decided to give them another try this past Sunday.  We attend Church in Davidson about 5 miles away and Church gets out at 10:30am so by the time we drive down here, it's close to their opening at 11 am.  We got there at 10:55am and waited till they opened the door promptly at 11:00 am.  We were promptly seated but it was apparent that they were not completely set up yet with chairs and stools and cushions still in their night position.  We sat there for almost 15 minutes before the first person even acknowledged our existence 15 minutes and I had to even talk to the wife for a change.  Turns out she's a pretty nice person.  After that point, went a lot better. Our server took our beverage order and gave us a chance to study the menu.  My wife ordered the Veal Marsala with Grilled Asparagus and a House Salad as her side.  I ordered the Shrimp and Sea Scallop Spiedino with Garlicky Mashed Potatoes as my entree and.Minestrone Soup for my side.  After they had taken our ordered, the server did bring out some warm bread with an Olive Oil/Oregano dipping Sauce.  Not bad but would have been better with a more conventional EVOO/Balsamic Sauce. The first never had a chance for the flavors to blend so it was only the EVOO.  First out were the sides and my wife did enjoy her House Salad. My Minestrone was fair but served luke warm with very little distinctive taste.  The cabbage in the soup gave it more of a Northern European taste than Italian although I do realize that cabbage does occasionally show up.  Entrees came out and my wife did enjoy here Veal Marsala with Asparagus although to me the asparagus looked overcooked. Portion size was small to medium.  As for mine, the Shrimp and the Sea Scallops were very good as was the Garlicky Mashed Potatoes. Portion size was again very small.  We both enjoyed our meal but at the end, a couple of comments    If your open at 11:00am be prepared to open at 11:00 am  Food is generally very good although portion size vs price is that of a five star restaurant. Remember this is a chain.  One characteristic of a five star restaurant is the service and you don't leave patrons sitting there because you are not ready to open at your opening time  Atmosphere is nice although lighting is very low which is unnecessary."}
{"text":"Our family has just moved to Nevada and this was the first restaurant we tried. Amazing food and staff!!! We had Cody as our waiter and he was great with us and our kids!!! A huge thank you to Cody for making our experience amazing!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We went with a group to the wine tasting dinner last Tuesday night, February 17th, 2015. I have never had a smaller glass of wine poured at a tasting! Hardley enough to taste the wine and enjoy it. Three small sips and it was gone. The wine was gone before we were served the food that went with it. I complained to the server and was told that they had to proportion the amount so everyone could have some.  ( So why not have more wine? I'm sure if we were paying by the glass we would have ample supply). Then came the first course Pizza. It looked like a personal Pizza, the kind you would get at  Happy Hour for  $5. Then the ultimate insult!  We were served one pizza, small remember, cut into 6 pieces for four people! How do you figure? Math is not their strenght. Again I asked the server for more Pizza so we wouldn't have to fight over it. Again I was told- sorry thats all we have. I thought maybe I'm the only one complaining but as I surveyed my group I found that everyone was dissatisfied.  There were supposed to be four wines and five courses. I only counted four since they doubled up two of the main courses on one plate. It would have been too embarrassing to serve a piece of chicken 3 inches long or 4 raviolis separately. Of course I complained to the Manager afterwards to no avail, as others did in my group. He said and I quote\" I guess it was my fault because I told the servers not to pour much wine\". Well at $40 a person I don't think I will be going back. Too many other wine tastings where they actually give you some wine. I usually give a 20 % tip, but my only recourse was to give a lower tip to show my dissatisfaction so I left 15%. Upon reflection,  it should have been much lower. Well, live and learn."}
{"text":"across the street from siena campus / hospital nice italian (americanized). spacious and cosy dining area. They serve you quickly and waiters are usually very pro-active, coming to check on you often.  came for a light quick dinner. ordered their yummy lentils soup, a caprese for me and à caesar salad for husband. the lentils soup had a little kick of spicyness tonight. My caprese was so so good! the burrata was soft and melting in my mouth.  Dinner was perfect and our waitress was very sweet and pleasant. She even offered to get our ice tea to go!"}
{"text":"Not bad.  We walked in about 9:30 on Saturday, and had the Ribs, Calamari, Side Salad, and the pepperoni pizza.  Everything was good.  The mashed potatos that came with the ribs, were the best things i ate,  really well seasoned.  The pizza was a good quality pie as well.  I guess my only wish was that they had a jug wine option like Macaroni grill.  If I'm going to pay $15 - $18 for chain resturant food, at least have a $4 glass of terrible wine for me to wash it down with.  Other than that, I thought it was PFG.  Not good enough to make it on my list yet, but maybe another visit, and I'll have become a fan."}
{"text":"We ordered the calamari and it was incredibly salty. Our soup and salad were both great! We also ordered the lobster ravioli and the lobster Mac n cheese. Both were good size portions. The mac n cheese was a lot more than what I could eat. Our waitress was great and attentive. The manager walking around asking people how their meals were was nice but she definitely didn't look or sound sincere. Never once saw her smile. She also was the least dressed employee there. Her shirt riding up her back, showing the small of her back just didn't seem appropriate for the dim lit, romantic setting."}
{"text":"I don't know why this place has low ratings, its good for a franchise restaurant, and way better than Olive Garden on sunset. Decent service and the food is always on point."}
{"text":"I wouldn't say it's fine dining but I will say if you would like a good meal with an Italian flair, fair price and good service, Carrabbas is the place to go."}
{"text":"I love the food there, especially the herb mix they put in the olive oil to dip your bread in.  I'm just not in love with the staff.  I have been mislead when ordering certain food items, thinking they were included and then told they were ala carte.  Sometimes the staff can be uninterested or rude.  It's too bad the staff couldn't be as good as the food."}
{"text":"Called ahead to reserve a table. Got to the location and our name wasn't even on the list. Note we visited on a Saturday night. (Busy) The manager came and said it will be 15 minutes but we'll be top priority. I was fine with that thinking they'd make space relatively quick. 20 minutes go by and we're still not seated. Overall bad experience with the employees, so we will not be coming back. Only good thing of the night was the food. The food was good but the people who coordinate the restaurant are ignorant."}
{"text":"Another chain bites the dust. Carrabba's used to me and my husbands favorite places to eat. Last night we decided to go because I got a promotion at work. We noticed that the menu changed and were excited to try a few new things.   We ordered the caprese appetizer. It was sliced tomatoes with basil and balsamic and a huge chunk of cheese in the middle. Not sliced, just a big hunk of cheese. Still it tasted alright but not as much flavor as it used to.  Their house salad was similar but because I have eaten a lot in the past, I noticed some significant differences. Smaller and less olives and no pepperincini. It is the small things with that simple salad that made it great and clearly to cut costs, they cut the special stuff. Sad.  My husband ordered a fetticini dish which did not have a lot of flavor. He could not taste the cheese. It looked really dry, almost like they forgot the sauce. I ordered the Johnny. It was flavored well but the steak was beyond tough and way smaller than it used to be.   Clearly, Carrabba's is chosing to cut corners to save a few bucks. Too bad too. It was one of the best resturant chains out there. Now, it looks like I won't be back.   On a postive note, the service was good. From host, wait staff to bussing, it was top notch. Those 2 stars are for those guys!"}
{"text":"Another corporate chain for people who have no clue how food is suppose to taste! I was forced by my nana (in law) to eat here! First off, stupid busy and a terrible wine and beer list. Typical corporate list! Bread was weber bread formed into a pretend crusty loaf! Gross! I had chix parm! Awful! Defiantly frozen! Super salty! Over seasoned to the point of it becoming bland while burning my taste buds off my tongue! Service sucked! Slow and less than comforting!  This is so far from Italian food  or even good Italian American it's almost laughable that the patrons think it's the real deal!   I will never be forced to eat this garbage again!! I'd rather eat stouffers  frozen french bread pizza!!! lol not really but you get my drift!!! I'd rather eat a Burger King chix parm sandwich over this place! At least you know it's frozen and fast food! This place has a open kitchen concept with actors as chefs pretending to cook but they are just reheating par cooked food and frozen food!!! Suckers!   Try something else and sell the gift card! Disgusting!! Not good for the stomach 20 min after either!!!"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time with my daughter a while ago and I must say we had a great time. The food was awesome. Our waiter was nice friendly and helpful. The atmosphere was pleasant and full of energy. We sat outside to enjoy the surroundings as it was cold on the inside. Other than that, we had a great time."}
{"text":"Been a while  Nothing special with the food. Salad has always been the worst lettuce  Service was odd.  Pasta not much flavor.  Cheap eats at best    Well why is it this place keeps failing?  When we walked in this is how we should have been greeted  \"Hello welcome to Carrabbas just so you know we are having trouble with our air and we know it's 110 out and hotter then hell\"  Not the waitress acknowledging it's out after we sat through and uncomfortable meal.   Bad bad bad"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places but I don't think we will be coming here anymore, the service lately has not been great. we had to ask for extra drinks since he took so long to come give us a soda , forgot the oil for the bread didn't bring my soup until the rest of the food and the soup we have to ask to warm up the last 4 times of coming here every time  .. but the food is so so good , the chicken , the pasta , the lobster ravioli all very good. Just not hot . We have tried many different entrees and appetizers and have been very good."}
{"text":"First time here and the manager Luis made it extra special. Our meals took a long time to arrive and he made us some fresh garlic bread (off the menu). Food is fresh and yummy...definitely come back here and talk to Luis. He is kind and accommodating, we'll be back."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and well prepared. Service was terrific too and attentive just enough. Can be very busy so I call ahead as we're on our way and get our name on the list so wait isn't so bad."}
{"text":"I have chicken marsala every time I eat here and it's always delicious. Quality ingredients, layers of flavor, proper texture and temperature 80% of the time.  Friendly helpful staff as well"}
{"text":"Most of the food no flavor.. Service friendly but just not on point. Ordered the Fiurocci salad sounded great. Piping hot vegetables wilt the lettuce instantly tasted very salty. Goat cheese crusted in nuts. should be nuts with a speck of goat cheese. Ordered chicken 3 ways. the mushroom version had 0 flavor the actual mushrooms didn't even have flavor and especially the sauce. a little dry. The goat cheese and sun dried tomato chicken .Actually was OK. But lets get real throw a big piece of creamy goat cheese on anything and its going to taste good.. 3rd prep was a wine reduction verson which just didn't have much flavor at all. Chicken ravioli actually did have some flavor which was a shock. Steak was dry. The olive oil with spices super tasty. The portions are huge and the price is reasonable.. But seriously the food did not cut it. Sorry carrabas. The other venues outback flemings, roys all exectuted way better. I cant stand olive garden but seriously i would go there next time over carrabas if i was forced to go to either at gun point and had a choice. Casa Di Amore is best Italian in town."}
{"text":"First, please understand, I avoid chains.  Some are ok, but I like to show the love to those shining stars who are out doing this on their own.  That said - every meal I've had at Carrabba's has been very good, with great service, and nice friendly people to make the experience just right.  Love the chicken Bryan - some times it's a little \"too\" rich - but tonight was just right.  The calamari was wonderful as usual.  Fantastic service.  We were there for a friends birthday (about 10 of us!) - and we kind of messed the server up by playing musical chairs a bit so we could visit with each other.  She wasn't flustered, took it in stride, and did a wonderful job of accommodating us.  Couldn't have been a better time!  I'm a fan!  (And the take home Pasta dish as a 'bonus' was perfect the next day!)"}
{"text":"Horrible Service manager does not care about the customers waitress spilled a beer all over my pants manager came over apologize and took $2 off my bill so it came down to I don't have to pay for the beer that spilled all over me was not looking for the manager to cover my ticket but $2 is an insult"}
{"text":"The kitchen really has there act together at this East Mesa location, stellar food for a franchise.   The revolving door of inept children they hire for the hostess positions is however criminal. Hire some adults for gods sake, it's way to busy a place to be throttled by ineptness.  A nice culinary experience awaits ... if you can get past the door!"}
{"text":"Not the best experience at this location as I have had with other locations. The server was often flustered and was not well versed on the menu. The house \"bottle\" of cab was served in a pitcher. Very awkward. Marsala sauce was extremely dark and less sweet. Portion sizes have decreased as well."}
{"text":"Always good service and always good food. Since I am a food snob I can say with conviction that this chain is one chain that I will come to for an inexpensive good Italian meal."}
{"text":"Carrabba's is decent Italian for under $40 for 2 people. Wait for one of the many meal deals that they offer in the year and you are golden."}
{"text":"They take reservations so you can come in at your scheduled time to hand you a hostess wait wand.  Waiting area smells of dirty people and a spilled dip bottle.  Bar smells like old spilled drinks.  They only received 2 stars because of house made pasta, but I'm felling a bit nervous to eat here because of the smell."}
{"text":"This is a excellent choice for a great meal at short notice.My parents are in town this week end and  we decided to eat out for New Year's Eve at the very last minute....and we were seated and out the door within 1 1/2 hours. Great service and friendly staff make this a standout from other Itailian places. Food was great and not too over sauced or over salted. My parents have a new favorite place and will be visiting their local Carraba's when the get back home to California."}
{"text":"I give this restaurant a 7 out of 10The service was amazingThe waiters were very funny and niceThis restaurant is also very cleanBut this place definitely has its ups and downsLike for example, some of the food has way too much saltand when they give you your food they always ask if you want some cheese as your topping, but they give you a HUGE amountAlso I recommend the muscles as an appetizerthey are deliciousOverall, this restaurant is great unless you get unlucky and order something you don't like."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place, it is one of my favorite Italian restaurants in the Phoenix area. We went here for New Years Eve and only had to wait a 1/2 hour and received excellent service and got to choose from the full menu. They have fantastic wine here. The bread is DELICIOUS with their olive oil and herb mixture. That's a big part of an Italian restaurant experience too. I usually order the Chicken Parmesan, it is too die for, their marinara and spicy red sauces are both the bomb. Everything else I've tried here has been really tasty too. The Caesar salad is great, very fresh tasting. So family friendly, we always bring the kids. Definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good. Kind of salty in my opinion, but my boyfriend thinks it's fine. I've had quite a few items on the menu.  The chicken Caesar salad is amazing. This location in particular always has the lentil and sausage soup, which is awesome. I'll come to Carrabba's just for that. The servers have usually been a bit snotty, which took me by surprise. Yeah, it's not Olive Garden, but it's no Avanti either.  Be warned though! The order in/take out is god awful. The food is fine, but the servers have always messed up my order.  I've called in for food about 5 times and not one time did they get my order correct. Often they charged me for everything I ordered, but when I would get my bags, several items would be missing. The manager has always been accommodating after I'd call in the problem by either refunding the missing items or sending a voucher, but put simply, I just want my food! So call car-side at your own risk!"}
{"text":"i'd been here before and got fairly decent service and good food, so i went back after work for dinner.  our server, stacy k, was extremely pleasant, informative, and helpful, and made our dining experience comfortable.  from the zucchini frites, to the chicken parmesans, everything was tasty, brought out in a timely fashion, and enjoyed to a high degree.    i especially enjoyed hearing about the new happy hour that will be taking place soon.  you'll see me back in there fairly soon."}
{"text":"The bar staff was nice, and attentive. The bread dipped in the spices and olive oil is a nice start along with a glass of house Chardonnay. Caesar salad was crisp and perfectly chilled.  The Chicken Marsala was delicious - chicken cooked perfect and the wood fire grill adds flavor - and the Marsala sauce is very tasty. Broccoli cooked in garlic and with parmesan cheese is a great side. The food is always consistently good at Carrabas. But I take one star off because with my tip it was about $40 for dinner. Which, although delicious, is a little much for chicken, broccoli, salad and a glass of wine.  I will say, as a member of their email club, they sometimes send a coupon out for a free spaghetti and meatballs to go if you purchase a selected chicken dinner. In that case, it is a TREMENDOUS value because their Spaghetti and meatballs is FANTASTIC!"}
{"text":"We went to Carrabba's to celebrate my parents 40th anniversary last week. Beginning to end it was great. Charles, our server, was excellent as was all the wait staff we dealt with. The food was really good, the Chicken Parmesan especially. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"My daughter wanted to try here for her birthday. We went 12/10/14 for her 10th bday.  The staff was super friendly, and the restaurant was clean.  The chicken bryan is really good and flavorful, pastas were well cooked, and tiramisu tasted like it had been doused in Kahula.  I tried the arancinis too because I was told that everyone loves them...they were just ok.    People should be aware that they do nothing for birthdays, not even a candle.    Also, can be a little pricey."}
{"text":"I went there on news years eve. They were incredibly busy and I still got the best service. The staff was so polite and nice. And of course the food was amazing as always. Our waitress markie was so funny and attentive. I had the best experience!!!"}
{"text":"I go to Carrabba's with my family a few times a year, usually with my in-laws because they love Italian/Sicilian. I've never had to wait more than twenty minutes and they don't even take reservations, but if you have more than five people I would call ahead to get on the wait list. If you do have to wait, hit the bar for a cocktail it'll help the time fly.   At the table, you will get the traditional basket of bread (served hot) with EVOO and herbs. I always recommend starting out with a cup of Mama Dola's chicken soup. It's savory with a little kick. I've never had a bad meal there. I've been there at least a dozen times and I've only had one mediocre waiter out of all the great ones.   I've ordered everything from the lasagna to the linguine pescatore. I've stuck to the pescatore for the past couple of years though for delicious consistency. It always hits the spot. If you like muscles, shrimp, and scallops, this is your dish. The sauce has a bit of red chile peppers to kick it up a notch. My better half recently ordered the Pasta Carrabba and I was very impressed. Creamy fettuccine with sauted mushrooms, peas, and fresh-of-the-grill chicken.   I don't recall ever getting dessert because I'm usually stuffed by that time.   My four stars are based on great service, great food, and reasonable prices. I wish they'd mix it up, add some menu items. they're food is great but not exceptional. You're getting more than you pay for though, that's fact."}
{"text":"I have dined here several times since it opened and it was a family tradition that we ate here every year before thanksgiving. Family coming from Hawaii and California.  Since I end up moving to the Bay, I craved for Carrabas once in a while, or every time I'm driving on 80 I see the huge billboard but it sucks because there is non around the city.  So I finally made it back in Vegas and my family from Hawaii are also visiting. I got everyone together and suggested that we eat at Carrabas tonight. All excited! As soon as we walked in, the host greeted us with a warm welcome (check), and seated us right away.  Our waitress asked us for drinks and brought us fresh baked breads with the side of seasoned olive oil dip (check). For the starters, we ordered the Calamares. When our Calamares came to the table, it was crispy as a plastic cup. Yikes!!!  As for my entrée, shrimp scampi Damien with ceasar salad. The ceasar salad came in a tiny plate, which I remembered used to be in a large bowl. When I finally got my entrée (shrimp scampi), I remember the shrimps used to be huge like tiger shrimps!? I do not know what happened?  Even our server was moody!  The atmosphere has changed, and the food has gone from 5 stars to, I'll give them 2.  I don't think I'll ever dine in this joint again!  I do not recommend this to anyone not to family and friends at all! Horrible service, horrible food!"}
{"text":"Consistently good chain restaurant Italian food.  The kitchen staff has been able to cook my steak to my requested Medium Plus temperature repeatedly on several visits, which not every restaurant seems able to accomplish.  The wait staff is always very good.  However, the host staff at the front door always has people who seem never have to have had a job before the day we walk in.  Why tell a person who uses the call-ahead seating REPEATEDLY that their name will go on the bottom of the list?  Of course that is true, but it doesn't make the customer feel good hearing that multiple times.  Why quote someone a 15-20 minute wait time when they arrive, when the wait time is less than 5 minutes??"}
{"text":"Carrabba's Italian Grill isn't your typical chain restaurant. There is an intangible quality that is featured on every plate that the competition can't replicate. Carrabba's consistently gives you the impression that components are made from scratch, entrees are cooked to order and you are the only table in the dining room.  I've dined at their well known industry counterparts. Comparatively speaking, I've never received an entree from the Carrabba's kitchen which had over cooked pasta (leering at MG) or lasagna which was still frozen in the middle (scowling at OG).  Carrabba's also happens to be my girlfriends favorite restaurant. So without any hesitation, we planned an entire day together, capped off with dinner at Carrabba's, to celebrate Mother's Day. The rest of the day was fun and relaxing, and so was our dinner.  The wait was short, the hosts were very friendly and the service was excellent! None of this is new to us as we've dined at the Avondale Carrabba's numerous times previously.  We are known creatures of habit when it comes to their menu because there are some entrees that are simply too good to resist (Chicken Bryan). So I can appreciate that Carrabba's updates the menu regularly and introduces different proteins with familiar preparations. For example, my girlfriend ordered the Trout Nocciola, which features an excellent lemon butter sauce and is crusted with almonds. I wish I had also selected her entree!  Not that my Lobster Ravioli wasn't equally enjoyable. From the Sangria to the bread, and everything in between, this meal was one of our favorites. When you factor in all the memories from other excellent experiences enjoyed at Carrabba's over the years, there is no reason why we won't continue to patronize this restaurant. Grazi!"}
{"text":"This was the first time I visited Carrabas - was in town and having dinner with the folks  - me madre picked it.   Kinda cool atmosphere, very comforting and not too loud. We started with the caprese appetizer - very good mozzarella and the tomatoes were incredibly fresh.   I had the classic combo which is chicken parmesan, lasagna and some of their house pasta. The chicken parmesan was thinner than I thought it would be, but it was tasty. The lasagna is a fairly small serving, but very tasty as well - could be a great mea on its own if the normal serving was much bigger. The house pasta was ok - nothing to shake a stick at.  My grandmother had the salmon and seemed to enjoy it - the folks had fish as well and they had no complaints.  Service was excellent. All in all, not bad. I would say it is a bit pricey for what you get as far as serving size goes, but at least it was good."}
{"text":"Carrabba's was the beneficiary of a gift certificate I received last Christmas. So I was in a mood to try a new place this past weekend. I managed to get past the packed parking lot next door and found a parking spot between two vehicles that were ready for the monster truck competition. I'm just glad they didn't crush my car when they left the lot.  My wife had made reservations and of course they tried to seat us near the kitchen, which we kindly asked for another seat. This restaurant was hot and apparently the A/C wasn't turned on, I was about ready to leave but I decided to see this through for the sake of all the other Yelpers that may benefit from this review. Our server, which had a resemblance to Linda Barrett of \"Fast Times at Ridgemont High\" put a smile to my face. So now I was in a much better mood than a few moments ago.  The drinks started coming out along with that piping hot yummy bread with olive oil. I ordered a bowl of soup instead of a cup, but received a cup instead. Our server rectified that and brought out a bowl of minestrone soup that could of feed a family. She charged us for a cup instead of a bowl. I guess I need to stop assuming things when dining out.  I ordered a regular Chicken Paraseam which was 2 cutlets versus a lite version which was one cutlet. I loved the Chicken but the broccoli was way way (added emphasis) too garlicky for me. My wife's garlic mashed potatoes were excellent; she also ordered the Chicken Bryan which she enjoyed. I would definitely go back to Carrabbas, we spent about $37 before tip without any alcohol."}
{"text":"So I absolutely hoped for more here! 1st visit was pretty good!! With with service!! Salmon way OVER cooked and mashed potatoes were COLD?? Alfredo is awful and chicken was burnt.. The cook was amazing and took the food off my bill. I hate complaining.. Customer service was top notch!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants. The food is always good. Too many forget to write reviews when things are great. We went in last night for dinner and had a GREAT waitress, Emily S. In fact, there have been several times we've had a great server there (Melanie is another great one). The managing partner (Jesse) came over to speak to us after the meal. He was great too. Will I go back? ABSOLUTELY! Always a nice casual evening, with reasonable prices, and good food."}
{"text":"The bartender Annano is awesome, very accommodating and attentive. We had the cesar's salad. Stuffed mushrooms, yummm."}
{"text":"My wife ordered a filet with NO grill baste as she has an allergen to rosemary and time. I sat and watched the kitchen manager ask if they put my filet and my wife's filet in the same plate... they said yes and her reply was \"Not a good idea\" I'm waiting to see if she plans on delivering it to the table.. yup as I thought  this place needs management training.  We are leaving without eating dinner tonight."}
{"text":"This restaurant has become a stable for my family as we visit several times a month.  We know many of the staff members and even worked really hard to get Creme Brulee back on the menu (sorta).  I'm a big fan of the Chicken Bryan and the Lental Soup.  And if you get the chance to have the Creme Brulee, it is the best I've ever had, I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Our server Jansen was amazing! I had the Pollo Rosa Maria with a side of mezzaluna  pasta, the wife had the linguine Positano, and for our anniversary desert limoncello bread pudding. OMG first I was torn between the chicken and pasta and our server offered to put the pasta as my pasta side... yesss please! my wife's meal was enough for two people, and it was delicious. The manager offered desert on the house, and suggested the limoncello bread pudding.... hand's down one of the best deserts I have had in a very long time.   We don't get to go out much and tonight's dinning experience was such a memorable enjoyable experience it made for such a nice anniversary.   This is our first time at this location and with out a doubt this will be the location we go to in the future. A big thank you to Jansen, staff, and manager at the Glendale Carrabba's for making our anniversary a memorable special one. See you very soon!"}
{"text":"Very nice. I had the Shrimp and Scallop Linguine alla Vodka. Shrimp and scallops were nice and delicious with plenty of them throughout the plate rather than just two or three pieces thrown in like other restaurants do, and the pasta was cooked perfectly, with the sauce nice and creamy. I also had the Calamari to start, and I must say, I'm usually not fond of marinara sauce, but it was actually quite nice with the calamari. Our waiter was very sweet and attentive (I tipped him a little extra). The head chef (or maybe he was the manager, he had the name of the restaurant glittered on his apron) seemed very proud of his kitchen and the food coming out of it; he had a very big grin on his face and wished everyone a nice meal. All in all a very pleasant visit."}
{"text":"Love this place. Been going for years. Besides an annoying waitress one time , it's been consistently a great experience. The bread and oil is by far the best bread out there. We loved the zucchini fries (which they no longer serve ) and now the wings as appetizer. My favorite soup is the Sicilian chicken. Pasta Carrabba is my main dish or the chicken Caesar salad. Super cold, chicken is grilled and amazing. Love the food and service here. Will be back."}
{"text":"Carrabba's Italian Grill is one of my go to spots if I am looking for a local dinner in Henderson.  My favorite dishes here are \"The Johnny\" (consists of the chicken bryan and a steak) along with garlic mash potatoes.  The Chicken Bryan is an amazing dish with an unknown cream sauce and avocado on top.  It is probably one of the best chicken dishes I have ever had.  The steak is always cooked to perfection and they use high quality cuts of meat.    My wife got one of the best chicken caesar salads I have ever tried last night.  They are generous with the chicken portion and the salad is dressed perfectly.    I always enjoy a Peroni beer on draft (one of 5 or so draft beers that they have on top).  I love the ambience, the price is affordable, and food is amazing.  I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Wonderful meal and service. Great outdoor patio, and our waitress Kristina W was very knowledgeable and pleasant, we enjoyed our experience very much. Shrimp and scallops spiedino was amazing!"}
{"text":"I really like Carrabba's updated menu but the prices are a bit too steep. All in all a decent value but for the money, I'd rather go to a non-chain Italian spot in Little Italy.  Wine Wednesdays are a great deal, though! Try the Blackberry Sangria."}
{"text":"My girls wanted some Italian food after dance class tonight so we decided to give Carrabba's a try. When you walk into Carrabba's, you immediately feel like you have entered an Italian restaurant. The guest greeter walked us through the dining room, and each section was separated by a wine shelf. I felt like I was in a friends house, and wanted to pull a wine bottle off of the shelf to look at the maker and date. We were seated in a booth with an attractive view of more wine bottles on a shelf. The room was perfectly lit for dinner and shortly after we sat down, the lights were lowered again, setting the scene for romance. If we didn't have our 3 year old with us, it would have been a perfect occasion to get some drinks and have a date night.       We were greeted promptly by our server Cody B. and he had our drink order out in a flash. When he returned with the drinks, I asked him what his favorite red sauce dish was. He had an immediate answer, the Linguine Positano. He explained that it was made with only 5 ingredients (Chicken,  Crushed Tomatoes, Garlic, Basil and Olive oil), but the sauce gave it alot of flavor. My girlfriend got the Shrimp and Scallops in vodka sauce and our daughter got the Spaghetti and meatballs from the kids menu. Cody B. anticipated our needs and asked if we wanted our daughters food to come out first. I was impressed by that and even more impressed when her food arrived 7 minutes later. No impatient three year old to deal with tonight.       When our food arrived it looked delicious, served in red oversized pasta bowls. Cody B. checked back in with us 5 minutes later and I asked him how so much flavor was in a dish with so few ingredients. He took the time to explain how Carrabba's makes their own sauces from scratch everyday and how impressed he was with the amount of prep that goes into making each fresh ingredient available. I was really impressed that he cared enough to answer my question in the perfect way that his employer would want him to. This server is a keeper, his boss should give him a raise.       Everything went smooth at Carrabba's tonight. The food was hot, delicious and on time. The service was a 10 out of 10 and the atmosphere was first rate. We will be back as soon as we can to sample more of Carrabba's menu."}
{"text":"Always consistent, I know these chain restaurants aren't always equal in quality, but I've been eating at this location for approximately 14 years and it has always exceeded my expectations. Absolutely excellent!"}
{"text":"All I can say is Christa was one awesome waitress. She was extremely nice and was very patient with us when it came to ordering our food. I went with my boyfriend and he had never been there but he loved the plate that Christa recommended us. The food was amazingly delicious. She also recommended some dessert that was fantastic. We will definitely go back and ask for Christa. Highly recommend her."}
{"text":"Oh man, freaking awesome excellent experience tonight!!!!!  I love Carrabbas, but haven't been to one since 2010 since they don't have where I live in Seattle :(   I'm glad I saw this one and can't fit my first experience in 6 years!!!  I got the asparagus and stuffed mushrooms to start off.  I wanted to try more apps as many looked delicious, not just from they pictures on the menu, but actual dishes being delivered to patrons.  The olive oil and herbs to dip your bread in was yummy as I remembered it.    I usually get the Chicken Trio, but I didn't see it on the menu, but I had a hankering for steak anyway.  Out of the Chicken Trio, my favorite have down I'd the Chicken Bryan.  To my surprise, they had a combo called the Johnny.  Sirloin steak in marsala sauce and Chicken Bryan. :)  Generally I don't order soups because they tend to be bland saved lack flavor.  Mikey the bartender told me the sausage lentil was very good and I was hesitant, and he saw my apprehension and told me \"Hey, if you don't like it, we'll get you something else!\"  How could I refuse???  The soup was delicious!!! Oh my goodness, great flavor!  Bite after bite did not disappoint.  It was peppery, but it was just right.  Thank Mikey for recommending it to me.  The meal was good, I like a medium steak, and mine can't out a bit rare, Mikey took it back and it came back just right.  I generally don't like sending a steak back, Mikey insisted and again her called it right.  My Chicken Bryan was delicious and the goat cheese was soft, almost buttery.  Because it was sooooooooooooo tasty, I wished my chicken breast was bigger :)  For dessert I had the gelato, chocolate hazelnut and raspberry.... The raspberry was good, but the chocolate had a bit of chalky aftertaste, so a bit of a disappointment, but everything else was on par.  The atmosphere was awesome, the food was great, I seriously couldn't have asked for a better night.  And what sets this experience above most, was that I almost felt like I was over a friend's house, than at a restaurant chain.  The bartenders knew peoples names and were having conversations that you could tell were beyond one night here or there situations.  I'm telling you, I could've been at Mikey's house for dinner!!!  He was an excellent bartender and he is a model for what customer service is supposed to be like, well above and beyond what passes for customer service these days.  I look forward to coming here again if and when I'm in the Cleveland area!"}
{"text":"Weekend hours are incorrect. They open at at 11am.   They have new menu items that are awesome. The shrimp and scallop pasta and the shrimp risotto are my favorite. All their pastas are fresh. Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"They have a very nice location. Well placed. When you walk in you have 4 people standing around the person taking your name. None of them smile. None of them seem happy to see you at all. They just work there and that's it. Miserable bunch of people. Lots of people standing around doing nothing while everyone is waiting on something.   We were given the table by the bar. This was a mistake. It's loud and the server seems to forget you are there. The server seemed annoyed that I didn't know the menu front and back and had questions about some of the odd names. I speak some Italian and even the new names for pasta were not familiar to me at all. She seemed like everyone should know what \"CAVATAPPI AMATRICIANA\" is. Well we don't. When I asked what kind of pasta came with the Spaghetti and Meatballs she seems annoyed again. It was not clear on the menu so I wanted to make sure. The idea of having \"CAVATAPPI AMATRICIANA\" which is fancy for Macaroni and having to pay extra seems pointless.  There were multiple times I was asked if I needed anything and then it never showed up. That's always nice. You come to the table ask me if I need anything and then never bring it back. Then why ask?  We ran out of drinks a few times and between the meal showing up and getting her to come by with the check was a very very long time.  The owner walked by the table and made a point to talk to the table next to us, brag about his status, then speak with that table and left. There is a clear problem and it seems to be him and it goes down. The unhappy wait staff. No one smiling and general problems need to be sorted out. Won't be going back again. First time and last time.  As far as I am concerned it's a tourist trap. Not a place for locals at all as they treat everyone like they are idiots and they don't need your business. The pizza oven is still broken. I see a few people who posted this and it's going on a while now. This place should be shut down until they get it running right.  Even sadder is the bad reviews on here got back YEARS all with the same complaints and seems nothing is done about it."}
{"text":"5 Stars all the way !!  Went on a Friday night, the place was packed with a line out the door. Put in my name and accepted the 40 minute wait. Walked over to COSTCO to look around for awhile to pass the time. In about 15 minutes the call came that our table was ready. The front staff was super nice and in no time at all we had a nice booth, and a menu. Diners all around were enjoying a wide variety of great looking items. Drinks were delivered and perusal of the menus started. We both chose the Chicken Bryan with fettuccine and a salad. Salad came first along with bread and oil. Good size salad, tasty with some left to eat with the entree. Chicken arrived and it looked and smelled wonderful.....then after the first bite it was found indeed to be wonderful.  Sad thing was it could not be finished...but it is now in the frig ready to be savored again. Overall, a great dining experience for not only me but it seemed like all the other diners there. Quality place with quality food and a attentive staff at all levels.  I would return any time."}
{"text":"Place is not bad at all, very nice environment. Service was great and the food was decent. The grilled chicken was awesome!! Wife loved her Pizza. We will come back again!!"}
{"text":"02/01/2011: Well, I was right...I hadn't been back to Carrabas since my last post in 2009 until this past weekend. My husband, myself and my friend decided on a whim to eat out...and chose Carraba's as we were driving by on Bell.   Upon arriving we were told it would be about a 25 minute wait. (which is to be expected at 6:30pm, in Surprise on a Saturday night) We asked if we could sit outside (they had heat lamps) and perhaps enjoy some bread and a glass of water. The greeter said that was no problem and that she would send someone over our way. We explained that we were not wanting to eat outside; simply sit down and relax while we waited. (and its not hard to see that I am 9 months pregnant and so standing for 30 minutes wasn't about to happen!)   So we sat outside and a really nice server comes out with menu's and silverware. We explained (again) that we weren't dining outside...simply wanted some bread, water and perhaps an appetizer. She smiled said she'd get the bread/water and we never saw her again.   Well, that's not true. When the buzzer went off to alert us that a table was ready for us, she was standing at the podium SMILING and then proceeded to walk us to our table, talking to us as though she had NO CLUE who we were. Nice. Again...9 months pregnant AND hungry people...a little customer service will go a LONG way in keeping this increasingly grumpy lady happy!   Once seated, we waited about 10 minutes before our waitress appeared as she was waiting many other tables around us. She was nice enough and was very prompt in keeping our glasses full and the bread replenished.   We all enjoyed our meals: my friend and hubby started with the Mama Mendola's Spicy Chicken Soup. They both said it is the BEST soup they've ever had. I enjoyed the Caesar Salad which this time had the perfect amount of garlic, dressing and parmesan...yet it was MUCH smaller than I remember. Thankfully there was plenty of bread and oil/herb mixture they serve. One could live on that ALONE!   Our entrees came out pipping hot; lasagna for my hubby, pollo rosa maria for my friend and chicken Bryan for me. We all were in HEAVEN. Each meal was delicious in its own right.   Overall a much better experience than the last time I was there...although because of the initial lack of customer service from the server/seater gal, I left with a bad taste in my mouth. I suppose I should be happy it wasn't from the food."}
{"text":"I Always have an amazing experience ,  There bread and herbs are to die for.  Greg is an excellent server so if your at this location make sure you ask for him ( tell him I sent you I bet he treats you right)"}
{"text":"Another exceptional meal! Food is always consistent. Tonight we had stuffed mushrooms, lobster ravioli and chicken marsala. Everything was delicious, a new dish for us was the ravioli. It was stuffed with meaty pieces of lobster in a silky buttery cream sauce. Will definitely be back on our next date night!"}
{"text":"Was greeted friendly and the server was very polite. I suppose all those negative reviews got in at a bad time with a bad server. -1 star because it did take a while for the order to come in. Also the veal chop temperature wasn't really medium but medium rare. There was a promotion from American Express, but don't think I would have known about this restaurant. Definitely better than your neighborhood bar and grill, but not a steakhouse by any means."}
{"text":"Currently here and today's dinner is hit and miss.  The fettuccine was dry, chicken was moist. My husband enjoyed his spaghetti. Requested extra Alfredo sauce. It took over 5 minutes to get sauce which caused my pasta to become cold. Ordered dessert, apple crostada. It was delicious! Without requesting, the manager credited us for the  apple crostada as it took a long time as well."}
{"text":"Went to Carrabba's the third and last time EVER. The first time was ok.  Went the second time about a year ago. I ordered a bean soup and bit down on a rock. I thought I broke a tooth. The manager came over and said he was sorry.       I decided to give them another try last night, a year later. The wait was an hour. First I must say, their prices are high for an Italian restaurant, but I don't mind paying for quality. Their spaghetti with meat sauce is $14 plus dollars a plate. The caesar salad was good. When the spaghetti came out,  it was cold. The meat sauce was absent of meat, the wheat noodles were terrible, and the portion was small.      This is a so called Italian restaurant and they can't cook a decent plate of spaghetti. This is a terrible excuse for an Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"The lasagna $15 was a 6x3\" and looked like Stouffers. It came with a soup or salad. Rip off. The Caesar salad with grilled chicken however is a good entree for $13.50. It's enough for two people. The bread with herbs and olive oil is probably my favorite thing on the menu here (free). Aside from the less than professionalism of the manager, JT, I guess I am stuck coming here until we use up the $100 gift card = 6 slices of lasagna?"}
{"text":"Worst Carrabba's I've been to. Service and food are both horrible. There wasn't enough sauce in the Fettucini Carrabba and the lobster ravioli was dry; I couldn't even tell if there's lobster in there. I'm never ever coming back to this awful restaurant!"}
{"text":"We've been to Carrabba's plenty of times and the meal at this location was just as good as any other visit.  The reason I'm writing this review is because our service was so great!  Dominic was our waiter and he was AWESOME!  So friendly, attentive, gregarious, helpful ... I could keep going but you get the idea!  Thanks for a great lunch Dominic and Carrabbas's, give this man a pat on the back ... he's making you look good."}
{"text":"We always do Amore Mondays and I love it! We get so much take out for so cheap. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Service was a bit slow but it was happy hour.  Prices are good for happy hour and the food is really good. 1/2 price apps and draft beer. Waiter was a bit slow but still did a good job. The place was clean.  Will need to go and have dinner to give a better review. But happy hour was good."}
{"text":"Alas.....Carrabba's used to be one of my favorite places to eat. I'm hanging it up after this past experience. I ordered the chicken parm and lasagna. Something I never order at Italian restaurants because I can make it better at home. But I was craving it so I ordered it. Mushy lasagna, and the chicken parm was burnt. I guess the chef's were too busy trying to clean up as we got there 45 min before closing.  Service was ok. I hate it when servers allow you to finish all your food before bringing out the next course......."}
{"text":"I prefer Mondays and non race days to come here because there is usually no wait and it is very relaxed. Our waiter was prompt and neatly dressed. There was a shortage of bread but it came soon afterwards. Our apps were good. I like the lentil soup or the minestrone soup. Food wait was good no more than 15 mins. Only one star short because the portions were a little small based on some other locations and visits I've been at/to. Otherwise, will be my date destination for Italian food"}
{"text":"took my boyfriend on a great little date night here on sunday. he is a huge carrabba's fan who has corrupted me with their addictive bread they bring out. is there crack in that olive oil?? beware not to fill up on it though. i suggest their chicken marsala. the chicken was melting in my mouth. those mushrooms just topped off the flavor that was coming from that chicken. i opted to be a little healthy and got their veggie of the day that happened to be my favorite...spinach! (yes i'm popeye!) i mixed it all up and even dug the spinach with the chicken and mushrooms. Dan T. is a huge fan of their chicken parm. everytime we go that is exactly what he gets. doesn't even have to look at the menu. we shared some fettucini alfredo that wasn't too bad, but it wasn't the best i have had either. i would def come to carrabba's over olive garden any day. the service is quick and on point. the staff is always friendly. the food doesn't take forever to come out. i know it isn't a top notch italian restaurant, but they did win me over and i know i will be back. (and not just because my boyfriend is the fan. i am now one too.) now pass me over some of that bread and oil please!"}
{"text":"A LOT OF $$$ FOR LITTLE  An honest review of a family of 4.   I've been going to this Carrabba's for over 15 years! Over the years they have cut their portion sizes WAY WAY down. They have always been pricy but you usually get a good amount of food for what you pay and as far as the food, it's good. The service is usually good also. This review is based on my most recent visit which was 12/2017.   To get an idea - We ordered: Mozzarella Sticks as an appetizer.  Drinks all sodas.  Wife ordered Fettuccine Weesie I ordered a pepperoni and sausage pizza woodfired pizza Both kids got a Kids Fettuccine.   Mind you we ordered on the cheap side of the menu because we couldn't believe how much the price has gone up.   Total cost - $71.34 *plus 15% tip. Roughly $81 - $83  Since I have been going to this restaurant for so long and can compare over the years. I remember when the Mozzarella Sticks were big. Best tasting in town. Plenty for a family of 4. Sadly now they are small sticks and come in 5.  My wife's meal was the only meal that was decently portioned but mostly noodles, few shrimp. It came with a small salad but it was also the most expensive at nearly $19.  My Pizza was just smaller then the plate which was disappointing. It came to me luke warm at first. I requested them to heat it up when it was served. They did, however, when it came back the end crust was well burnt. The main middle was fine. I decided not to fuss and ate it excluding the end crust. I ordered two toppings but found they billed me for three???  The girls both got the kids Fettuccine which was also very small in size. I have photos. They were about $8 each. Defiantly NOT enough for growing children who are hungry. So much so, I gave a slice of my Pizza to one daughter and the other had extra of the bread they bring you.   Don't get me wrong. The food taste was excellent, as always. So no complaints there. Even with my pizza which had the burnt ends was still really good. Our server was okay. No complaints there.    Give this 2 stars because I remember going to this place and getting a decent amount of food for what you pay. Also disappointing because we ordered on the cheap side of the menu to try and keep the cost down but it was still quite a bit.   I hope this review is seen by management and changes are made because at least for my wife and I and our family, will have to take our business elsewhere until things have changed here. Hopefully it does."}
{"text":"When you're in Philly, driving through little Italy, the pungent aroma of garlic permeates the city streets. Think about that for a second.  Just exactly how much Italian food needs to be cooking at the same time to stink-up entire city blocks? A lot right?  Well when you walk into Carrabba's, you don't smell shit.  Not garlic. Or spaghetti sauce. Zippo.  How is it that an entire fucking neighborhood can stink like Italian food and one 'Italian' restaurant in west Phoenix has the faint smell of nada?  I ordered the Italian Chopped Salad. It was really good.  I wanted so badly to smell that aroma that used to stench-up my mom's house. It didn't happen. Disappointment on the aroma level, if that's even a category.  Food and friendly service - high marks."}
{"text":"Great experience our server had trouble getting to our table quickly and made up for it by having the owner come over to us with complimentary appetizers, very professional and hardly see ownership in facilities conducting great business so that was awesome! Was my first time here and loved the food. Will be visiting again!"}
{"text":"This was a super disappointment.   The waiter was nice but borderline useless.   Food was bland and expensive.   Do not recommend.   Makes Olive Garden seem high class.    Had to get silverware off another table, salad was sub par.   Had high hopes but it did not fit the bill."}
{"text":"Very, very disappointed. They removed my favorite appetizer (shrimp scampi) from the menu. The waiter told me they can still make it! When it arrived, it was tiny little shrimp, gummy, not seared.  They removed my husbands favorite dish (seafood cannelloni).  They raised prices & reduced sizes!  What's happening!??  I wont return."}
{"text":"My golfing foursome decided to go Italian after a day of golf.  We decided on Carrabba's.   Started off with Calamari, which is always a good choice.  It met expectations.  We ordered wine and the waitress made a mistake.  Not sure I got the wine I ordered, but it was O.K.  I have a problem every time I go to Carrabba's.  I can't seem to order anything except the Chicken Bryan.  It's grilled chicken with a tangy rich goat cheese, dried tomatoes and a lemon-butter sauce.  It's always outstanding.  The only complaint I have is that the portion is too large.  When I get it locally, I usually end up taking half of it home.  My buddies had veal marsala, the Tuscan grilled pork chop and lasagne.  Everyone enjoyed the meal.  Summary:  O.K. service, very good food, reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Service was so-so and the food came out slow. Mixed drink was very expensive. Get the wine instead. Husband had Steak Skewers and the meat was tough. Ot was okay for dinner on a week night."}
{"text":"We love Carrabas and have never gone wrong with any dish! We have had the amazing salmon (I am particular with my salmon and it is far better than any seafood restaurant). We have had the cavatappi, filet spideno, and chicken Marsala. All wonderful ! They now have dine  in rewards, which is a positive since we eat their on a monthly basis."}
{"text":"Super disappointed. I came with a party of about 20. Now I know this is a large party but I'm too a server so I also see things through a different lenses. It took out food about 30 minutes to get out... ok cool, except it took mine and another persons about 35 minutes (hers was free, mine wasn't? Yea kinda weird right?). The bar was slow. Checks took forever to get and even longer to cash them out (after mine and my partners was wrong to begin with). Tons of problems yet we never saw a manager to apologize about our wait or our awful experience.  Worst restaurant experience I've ever had."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been going here for year's, but never again! My wife and I ordered the dinner for two special. I ordered the lobster ravioli, definitely not fresh lobster, smelled like tuna casserole! I sent it back and ordered the steak marsala  (medium).....it was raw, not rare, raw!  I don't care that the food was terrible, I don't care that the manager comped my dinner.  What bothers me more than anything is that the manager snubbed us off! She stopped by to talk to people enjoying their experience, but wouldn't make eye contact with us when she walked by.   No one took the time to apologize for our crappie dining experience. No heart felt anything. Apparently you don't care enough about clients having a bad experience, thinking that comping a meal I didn't eat would make things better.  What a lazy, cowardly way to take care of an unsatisfied diner."}
{"text":"I always get great service here. Dan the manager stops by to say hi to my kids every time. The food is always tasty and properly prepared. They understand that with two small boys, we need their food quickly and we may need to make a hasty exit. I'll continue eating here regularly (at least once a month now for well over a year.)"}
{"text":"My wife and I ate dinner here this evening. We were promptly show to a table and very quickly we were offered drinks. My wife and a house wine and I had a pink lemonade. It wasn't long before our waitress came. Her name was Jennifer. She was pleasant and efficient   I think (it's been a couple of days,) a seafood cannoli.  Pretty good I thought, and commented.  The background music was Jazz.  The crowd was varied with a cross section of Phoenix's population  The ambience was pleasant, the meal was satisfying.  I would return, if ever again I find myself in Mesa, AZ. Finish your review"}
{"text":"The food was good. The service from my waiter was great, he was fabulous. But, I do not think that you should be cut off at 6 beers when I was not driving. Makes no sense. If I want 20 beers I should be able to drink them when I have a designated driver!  For that reason, my party of 14 will not go back."}
{"text":"... and I'm being generous.  Since my last experience at Fontanella sucked, I decided to give this place another chance. I had to skip both breakfast and lunch so I went ridiculously early: 6:30  and the place was packed, there was one sit left at the bar which I grabbed.   I decided to keep it modest this time and ordered the signature pasta w/ soup. Totally unlike the salad option, the Sicilian sausage and lentil soup was very tasty - it probably didn't hurt that I hadn't eaten anything at all in the past 24 hrs.   The Penne Franco was a little gimmicky but overall it was pretty good, I'm a sucker for garlic. I order the  $11,50 plain version, I'm not a fan of throwing chicken on top of pastas or salads.  I had a cup of the house Montelpucciano, which was very average but reasonable @ $5.50  A solid three stars so far.   At this point I must have been woozy because I ordered a Tiramisu. Seven dollars and change for the worst imitation of Tiramisu I've ever had. As tasteless as day-glow colored supermarket cakes. To boot it costs 70% as much as the pasta and soup dinner itself.  Second experience at this restaurant confirms it's ok for the basics but don't be suckered into paying for a fine dining experience because you won't be getting your money's worth."}
{"text":"What a disappointment. Disgusted with this location.   I called in advance to reserve a table for 7 for my grandmothers 78th bday. I arrived 15 minutes early and was given a pager by a young woman and told the tables were being put together. Fair enough. After waiting 20 minutes I decided to go to the bar and have a glass of wine. The wine glass had old lip gloss on it. :( after  another 10 minutes I asked the gentleman at the hostess stand how long it would be....he told me a booth was being cleared off. At this point I was a little irritated. I \"reserved\" (or so I thought) a table for 7. Another 15 minutes goes by, people are packed in entrance like sardines and they finally shout out our name. Guess the pager was pointless. We get to the table and it had not been wiped down nor reset.   The restaurant was clearly doing some remodeling. But that is no excuse for the staff. Orders were messed up. My daughter did not get her meal until we were halfway done with ours. (We all shared with her) my Bryan chicken was room temp. The food was NOT up to par. Lasagna and ravioli both tasted like something you would find in the freezer section at the grocery store.  The waitress cleared glasses from another table and left the tray on the floor beside me. I was astonished at the lack of management and untrained staff, the dirty bathrooms and unkempt outside waiting area....WHICH HAD A DIRTY DIAPER IN THE ASHTRAY.   Never going back to this location. Hope they can get their act together before they run everyone off. Waiting for a reserved table for over 45 minutes, poor service and poor food. Not my ideal of a \"nice dinner\" for my grandmother.   Thanks a lot."}
{"text":"Good food (as expected from the chain) and nice service.  Try the mini cannoli!  They are the perfect ending to the meal."}
{"text":"we came here for my birthday dinner last year   it was pretty dark inside but its italian so its usually like that  the greeter asked how many and then just turned around expecting us to know she wanted us to follow her. Rude.  the server came up, rushing us to sit down, didnt introduce himself and asked what we wanted to drink turned around without a word and walked away. when he came back he sat our drinks down sloshing one of them on to the table and then walked away.  we got up and left no thanks, carrabbas, you suck balls."}
{"text":"I took my wife out for her birthday here at one of her favorite places. We enjoyed the whole dinner process though I was kind of disappointed with the server. I had said a couple of times that it was my wife's birthday and they didn't even respond. The server though good seemed to have issues in her communications with us. She really didn't communicate with us though she kept up with the drinks.   I would still recommend it as the food is awesome and usually good service."}
{"text":"Me and my future wife came into enjoy the Amore mondays! It was fantastic this both our first times to Carrabbas and boy did they impress! Shelby our waitress was great she kept the drinks full and gave good advice in what was good! Each course came out perfectly timed and perfectly cooked! Ian the manager is doing a great job running the restaurant and when he found out it was our first time he made it great with the addition of some ice cream to go with our brownie and mousse dessert! The staff and management at this location are great and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Husband & I Stumbled onto Carrabba's while in the Mesa area & VERY glad we did. The manager visited our table & told us it is a franchise and part of OutBack. The service from everyone was great & all the food was outstanding.  We had friends (3 couples) in town from home & took them there & they were all pleased as well with the food....we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Service and quality continuously meet and/or expectation! My family and I have been coming to this place for years and we never had anything less than stellar love the atmosphere service and food! It's a place you can count on!"}
{"text":"We ate here as part of Restaurant Week.  $30 for two people, three courses.  The calamari was good.  Not great, but good.  They managed to avoid not making it chewy, but the marinara dip was a little weak.  Their batter-dip (the part that gets crispy when they fry it) also didn't seem to have any seasoning to it.  The lentil/sausage soup was really good.  I liked it.  The Italian chicken soup also was very good, though not as \"bold\" as the lentil.  The main courses were good.  Large portions of pasta, big chunks of scallops, or chicken (depending on the dish ordered).  I had the mezzaluna.  It was tasty, but I don't think I'd order it again.  Just personal preference.  It's a ravioli dish, and I would have liked a bolder (and redder) sauce, and more filling.  The desserts were wonderful.  I had the cannoli.  It was really very nice.  I didn't really like how it was served (the ingredients were packed into this tall thin glass).  I would have preferred the more traditional presentation.  But the flavor was really excellent.  Service was friendly, cheerful, and attentive.  Good job all around there.  I'd give 3.5 stars if I could, but I can't.  And I don't think they quite rated 4 stars.  But maybe that was my entree choice.  If I go again and feel differently I'll update this review to reflect it."}
{"text":"Had a gift card, so we decided to visit for happy hour.  The happy hour deal is 1/2 off their appetizers, plus some drink specials.  So this is really a review of their appetizers.  We didn't get an entree.  We ordered the bruscetta, the calamari, and the arranzini (I think that's the name).    The bruschetta was really good.  I liked it a lot.  If everything else was that good I'd probably go at least 4 stars.    The arranzini were sorta like meatballs but they weren't all meat.  There was other stuff in them.  Sort of reminded me of falafel.  They were pretty good.  A solid three stars there.    The calamari was a disappointment.  It was cooked well enough (usually the problem is they do it wrong and it's like chewing on a tire).  But the seasoning was waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too salty.  I mean getting-a-mouth-full-of-sea-water salty.  To their credit they took it back, but then brought out a batch with no seasoning.  Imagine calamari with no seasoning...yeah...zzzzzzzzz.  Somewhere between chewing on rock salt and no seasoning is a happy place called \"properly seasoned\".  Their chef should look into that.  I can't quite bring myself to give the calamari two stars.  Gotta go with one.  Just not good.  Only the marinara dipping sauce made it tolerable.  So, overall, three stars.  You could do better, you could do worse.  At least for appetizers.  Perhaps I'll return and do an entree.  I still have a balance on that gift card."}
{"text":"One of the better chain restaurant's even though I don't care much for chains with so many good places to eat. Service was very good. Food was ok, nothing spectacular. Was in the mood for steak and outback was too long of a wait. The steak marsala was over-priced but it's not a steak place but I thought I'd take a chance. An average rating at best."}
{"text":"I have never had a bad meal here. The food is always top notch, with the staff always going above and beyound."}
{"text":"Haven't been eating much at national chains the past 10 years but I occasionally pop in when running errands. Portion sizes have been decreased the past few years but the quality and taste have remained. Carry out service is better than the wait and they even give you a loaf of bread with the EVOO and herbs."}
{"text":"Gave this location another try. Food was on point. Service on Valentine's Day was a bit suspect as they played games w our seating at the hostess stand. The front of the house team will kill your business if you are not careful. However, our Server was great! And the food was as flavorful and fresh as I always remembered Carrabba's to be."}
{"text":"I havent been here in a year.  I have to say that it has changed alot.  Quality of food has gone down hill.  The marsala gravy on the chicken was so watered down that it didnt even have any flavor.  They brought a new side of it but actually not any better.  Today i had the minestrone soup that I brought home and again the base was very watery and no taste.  Hardly any vegetables and what was in their were big huge chunks!  For the money that they raised this meal too it certainly isnt worth the price plus they have new proprietors again...."}
{"text":"Silverware was very nasty and dirty. Lady who brought out soup and salad never returned. I put my hands up for another server to get manager. ,she said she would and never came back.  Manager came over and apologized and gave me a gift card"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner for Father's Day with my wife and her parents. Great experience. Our server, Kelly, was great and very helpful with every single recommendation for us as to what dishes were good. The calamari was the best I've had in a long time. I had the chicken trio which was great. Definitely would go back again."}
{"text":"Wow, the first time was not crowded, seemed pleasant enough for an over priced salad with shrimp. Arranged a second quiet birthday lunch again a month later. On approach, the Parking lot was packed. Walked into restaurant, and was ignored at the podium for a good 10 minutes. Large private meeting in the dining room to the North. I guess it must have been obvious  I wasn't there for the meeting, carrying a large ,colorful bag, marked \"Happy Birthday\". The bar and restaurant, to the south, were completely empty. After an employee smiled and continued on in to the kitchen area, out of sight, a gentleman at the podium with his back to me, finally turned and informed me the restaurant is closed for the private meeting. Huh? Please put a post on the entrance door, I replied. As I was Leaving, trying to text the people I was meeting not to bother arriving at this destination, another couple with their daughter walked in, received the same news, and walked back to their car also. Sad way to discriminate. Thank goodness there is a Charleston's next door. I won't bother trying again at this location, they don't seem to need business."}
{"text":"A very nice ambience with light spanish music in the back ground.  Being a vegetarian I had very limited options and I had to go with Spaghetti with pomodoro sauce. Cooked to perfection, the waitress was funny and talkative.   Nice place for a one time visit."}
{"text":"Great service and great food! It was really fast and we didn't spend all night waiting for our food like other restaurants. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and food...fun time...clean and friendly...quick seating...great birthday dessert for our birthday girl."}
{"text":"Pretty darn good Italian food. Decent dinner prices, great portions, and very attentive service. I've been to this restaurant several times now and it's always a nice treat.  I am usually way beyond full by the time we leave. Between the complimentary bread (delicious, by the way) and the soup/salad and appetizer options that are often included in their specials, it's tough actually making it to the entree. But that's no complaint for me! I've always been happy with the different food I've tried here. Their cocktails are pretty great too, super delicious but still plenty strong enough.  Overall, very nice and high quality ambiance and eats, especially for a chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Ordered twice from there recently and it's such low quality for the very expensive price tags.  We ordered lasagna and there is virtually no meat or cheese....just noodles and sauce that taste like it's out of a jar.  House salads have virtually no toppings just a bunch of lettuce.  Thumbs down....won't be eating there again.  The last time wasn't good either but we had a gift card both times so we had no choice but to try it."}
{"text":"I like this restaurant because the foods taste much more fresh and unique than other Italian food chains. I especially like their Sausage and Lentil soup, which is a good meal at the bowl size. I also like their Fettuccine Carrabba which is crisp and simple but excellent.  Personally, I do not think much of their Chicken Parmesan, because it always tastes a little dry and tough to me.   Their pre-meal tiny bread loaf and here's olive oil is excellent!"}
{"text":"Our service was very poor. The empty plates were not removed quickly and water was not Refilled promptly.  I tried a new seafood dish was still hungry when I was done very small portions"}
{"text":"I've been to this location a few times.  Ironically we stopped visiting this chain because our experience a couple of years ago was not too good.  The food seemed like it was frozen and heated in the microwave.  We were disappointed because our previous visits were acceptable, not great but OK.  We found ourselves recently looking for a quick Italian meal because we were short on time.  My daughter and grandson were with my wife and I.  There were a fairly lengthy wait so we opted to sit in the bar area at a long, high table.  Our server was very friendly and humorous.  She got our drink orders and returned for our dinner order with our drinks reasonably quickly.  Dinner was indeed served pretty fast which always concerns me because I wonder it this is still a heat and serve kind of place.  I ordered raviolis which were OK.  Nothing outrageously delicious but certainly palatable.  Their fresh, warm bread is delightful although we could have used a second dish of olive oil and herbs.  Everyone seem pretty happy with what they order.  Their servings were a decent size but not overkill.  Some of it accompanied us home.  This is definitely not a go to place for Italian food but it will do in a pinch."}
{"text":"I've been here a half a dozen times. Always a great dining experience! You don't get better than this for a mid range dining experience.  Always friendly and prompt service. The place is always clean and we enjoy the ambiance.  We've been there as a couple and with a larger group...no problems.  I'm sure I'll be visiting again."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar, the server Mike was amazing. Very pleasant, An very outgoing. The food wasn't the best, well good just not amazing. Overall I enjoy it. Thanks Mike for ur amazing service..."}
{"text":"I actually like Carrabba's considering it's a restaurant chain. It's better than say an Olive Garden or red lobster. Staff was really friendly and professional. Though my order was incorrect the manager called me back promptly and sent me a gift card. Overall great experiences here. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I'll make this short and sweet. I've only been here once. I had the parmigiana trio which was awful. The breading was mushy, the cooking oil had an off taste and the red sauce was closer to ketchup than real sauce. Everyone else at our table seemed pleased with their dinner and the service was excellent"}
{"text":"Hey all....visited this place yesterday and nothing negative to say, the service & employees was very good the atmosphere is wonderful.  I wish I would have chosen a more complex meal in order to give a detail opinion but I  just had a traditional Spaghetti and Meat Sauce nothing elaborate but it was quite tasty (average)."}
{"text":"Love Carrabba's. The food and staff are great. Our server Richard R was friendly. The Carnevale Pizza and Arancini were awesome! My wife ordered the Fettuccine Carrabba and wasn't happy with it. The new proprietor Kyle was very attentive and replaced her meal with the Chicken Bryan, which was delicious and comped us a second Arancini appetizer, which wasn't necessary but appreciated. Looking forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"I went here last week after not having been in years. I don't get it. It's over-priced and not that amazing. The bread is good but served with olive oil and bitter herbs/spices. The salad felt like a store bought salad bag. The scallop and shrimp pasta was just ok. They put beautiful scallops in a mediocre sauce. I didn't get it in 1994 and my opinion still holds today. I will not be back."}
{"text":"We were seated by the bar and our server's name was Marissa, she was outstanding. I got a ribeye and side of spinach and salad. We used the 50% off rewards from their rewards program and that went really well.  My steak was not cooked to my liking but a manager stopped by and took great care of us. We ended up also having dessert, and it was delicious. Some sort of lemon bread pudding with vanilla ice cream. We have had good experiences at this location and most certainly will be back."}
{"text":"Not bad for a franchised owned Italian restaurant (way better than Olive Garden though).  Appetizer: Shrimp Scampi - the sauce alone was really good. We even used the sauce to dip the complimentary bread. The shrimp was cooked perfectly.   Main Entree: Linguine Pescatore - it was delicious and had a good amount of scallops, mussels and shrimp in it. The sauce was okay. I've tasted something better... Somewhere close by (PASTA SHOP...Shhh)  Pollo Rosa Maria - it's good as always according to my bf.  No dessert for us since we were stuffed after all the bread and pasta we had. Maybe next time."}
{"text":"I've been to quite a few Carrabba's, and by far this location has the best service. The hostess was polite, my server was incredible and made sure that my order was right, I had no less than 4 separate people check on me through my dinning experience to insure that I was happy. Honestly I was impressed, my server (Taylor) was sat a 10-top the same time I was sat and not only did she manage my order, but the entire party as well... Wow... I ordered the Calamari and was very pleased, as some of the other reviews have already stated. For my main I had the Chicken Brian and it came out perfect. Chicken tender and moist covered in Goat cheese and sun dried tomatoes. Overall good dinner but the service made this a great experience!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at many Carrabbas before-LOVED them all!!  But, I  must say i wasnt too pleased with this one.  /this was my first visit to AZ, and i noticed they had a few carrabas here, so of course we made sure we went to one. Well they have this drink,  a peach tea alcoholic beverage that i guess hasnt made it to this region yet after 10minutes of trying to order it. I was looked at like i was insane, and i am trying to describe it to them, and when it was all said and done, it was'nt their fault at all, its just that they dont have it there. The bartender was able to call another locaton and he did get the recipe for it-which was great because that showed no, I am not crazy.  I just dont go around ordering make believe drinks. The drink wasnt the best, but i mean it was his first time making them so i cant really complain. I really like that he tried to accommodate us tho so that was great cust service..  As for the food, it was just ok.  I\"m usually VERY pleased with the food, but here it was just ok."}
{"text":"John is the best server ever!!! and the owner is always there and both are very cordial, friendly and great food. We used to take my father on Sundays to lunch, he had Alzheimer's and we wheeled him in John was as gracious 3 years ago as he was yesterday when my husband and I complete with his picture to celebrate his ( he passed in 2015) favorite place. I must not be a great connoisseur. Veal masala of which I ordered I must have been thinking of scaloppini   but no thank you highly disappointed the veal dish I ordered on recommendation of my friend John was terrible. tough, I didn't like it all, if that is \"good\" veal it is not for me. Just my opinion I will be back but no veal for me  thx Peggy"}
{"text":"Love the never-ending bread!  Love the Chicken Bryan!  Manager is friendly and comes around to the tables at times which I think is exceptional!   I tend to have left over food so the servings are pretty big.  The mashed potatoes I can't get enough of!"}
{"text":"I came here for valentine's and my anniversary and it was a great meal. I got an amazing appetizer, drink, dinner, and dessert for $60 and it was all really great. Other places of such elegance would have charged me way more. I will definitely go back again another time, it is worth it."}
{"text":"It took 10 minutes before someone attended to us and there was barely people there pasta was ok it was passable I just expected more from this place that's all. They also said that they serve food that is freshly made but it tasted like half of the things we ordered were frozen."}
{"text":"For a chain restaurant, this place is pretty good.  The menu isn't so extensive that you lose quality in food.  Actually, having a one page menu plus a one page alcohol menu is my ideal.  I got the Pollo Rosa Maria and it was actually pretty delicious.  I had spaghetti as my side and that left a bit to be desired, but still complemented my meal nicely.    The salad came quickly, as did the bread.  No complaints there.  The service was attentive and my drink never went empty.  However, when I said I had never been to a Carrabbas before the server proceeded to explain nearly every dish on the menu.  I could have lived without that, but I suppose it could be useful to have the Italian words (that are quite obvious what they mean in English) explained to some.  Overall, for a chain Italian place this is pretty good.  In my book the quality is significantly better than Olive Garden, but the range of selection is much more limited."}
{"text":"Food tastes good but beware of the take out cause stuff was missing and meat overdone so all they would offer was $10 credit for next time and after a little more complaining we got a whopping $15 total and I think our total order was over $150 plus gratuity.  For 4 meals we got two small bags of bread and it wasn't enough and we specifically wanted extra bread so imagine if we didn't ask we might have been Lucky to get 4 slices, ha!  Alfredo fettuccine was bone dry and we had to use our bread dipping sauce we paid extra for to resuscitate out pasta. But we didn't have enough bread to dip it in so I guess you could say it worked out somewhat."}
{"text":"The calamari was way overcooked. I wouldve told the server had he checked in with us.  My son really likes their pizza so we keep coming back."}
{"text":"My goodness!! Luis (the owner) rolled out the red carpet when I was here for a special event! I know, I know, it's a chain you say. Well, wipe that from your mind and give this little Italian eatery a try.   From the drink pairings to the perfectly sized portions this event was top notch start to finish. The three cheese sausage stuffed mushrooms will have your mouth watering for the next time you have a chance to get them. Of course don't forget to pair that starter with a starter drink of Blackberry Sangria or Sparkling Tuscan Lemonade. However, I may just have to drink Prickly Pear Margaritas the whole time I am here next time....caution - they're addicting.   When here you will have to be careful with what you finish, as I said your meal is going to be amazing from start to finish, and you have to leave room to be able to make it to the \"finish\"...ahem, DESSERT! Namely: bread pudding. Now, I am not normally a bread pudding type of guy (usually mushy), however, this desert was light and delicious without being soggy and heavy. A very unique trait for bread pudding. The uniqueness of this dessert alone should have you ordering it.    So many flavors, so little time. Come here again and again to taste it all. Definitely make sure to check out their wine pairing dinners they have like once a month. It would be an experience you would not soon forget as well as leave you excitedly waiting for the next."}
{"text":"We got our usual Pollo Rosso Maria and Chicken Bryan. For us the food quality has been consistent and good. We come for the food, not ambiance. We never finish the entrees, they become next day's lunch. We love the seasoned olive oil for bread dipping. The Italian chicken soup is good and was my Caesar salad (both included in the entree price) . Dessert was good as well-a banana strawberry infused most cake. Our server was very pleasant, but service was on the slow side. This was Saturday afternoon, around 1:30 pm. My rating reflects how we view the food."}
{"text":"Waited a really long time to be seated for a mediocre birthday dinner. I ordered some sort of shrimp pasta plate.  Our meal was a long time coming after being seated. My shrimp had gone bad...really bad, so I ordered something meatless. The replacement dish took so long to arrive that I ended up eating part of my wife's  I only had a limited amount of time before an event I had to be at and couldn't wait any longer for my meal. My daughter didn't finish her plate & my wife was underwhelmed by hers (same thing I had).  It just tasted bland to me.  There are too many alternatives in this town to wait 40 minutes on \"meh\" entrees that are not inexpensive! That's what makes the world go round though. Some people swear by this chain. Just not my thing."}
{"text":"Typical franchise Italian food  at slightly higher then olive garden prices. I had the chicken parm with seasonal veggies and the Sicilian chicken soup. All were decent and the service was prompt. I just kept thinking, man I could have ordered this for half price from the local pizzeria lol. Portions and large and sure to fill up 1 large guy like myself or plenty to split amongst 2 stronger disciplined individuals. Enjoy and Manga."}
{"text":"We came here for my birthday and it couldn't have been more perfect! Friday night but we were seated immediately, the staff at the front door is warm and welcoming, our waiter (Justin) was excellent, the manager (Mike) came by our table to make sure everything was ok (he was super nice too!), drinks were great, food was exceptional. I'd give this place 10 stars if I could!"}
{"text":"Good Pasta!  Great ambiance for a date night or friend get together...   I forget what I had last time here but everything is usually pretty good here. Service is good and prices are decent...   Check them out and you'll be glad you did..."}
{"text":"The food is what you would normally expect, but the dining experience was less than desired. During our entire meal the table behind us had an endless parade of people. The diners work at the restaurant so everyone and their mother had to come by for a conversation. In addition, I became privy to all the gossip at the restaurant and it got so bad that I was unable to hear what my husband was saying. You would think that since they work here they would understand discretion and how to be around customers."}
{"text":"Here's another 1 star!!  ( wish yelp would make a minus 5 star chart ) My wife and I went here this month on my birthday. ( December) She decided to get filet Marcella ( like she always does ) and I ordered the sirloin like they had advertised on tv. Everything was going great, bread, nice appetizer, salad, until her main entree showed up. She tried a piece like usual and said: this tastes like a sirloin. I also tried it and sure enough it tasted just like mine, a sirloin. Needless to say, she DIDN'T send it back but, we had the manager stop by just to let them know. She showed him and also showed that there was tendon running through it. ( see pictures ) He proceeds to say that he was definitely sure that was a filet. ( because he used to be a cook there ) Ok, but, why would you stand there and argue with a guest on what cuts of meat are what? ( like we don't know? ) Why not just say; sorry, let me prepare another one for you? Rather than stand there and say, you are so sure that was the correct cut of meat she ordered? ( your in the wrong business. I think your a meat expert! ) I don't know where you guys order your meat but, if I ran that place I sure would be looking at my distributer. We have eaten at several different steak restaurants here in town and never had a problem at ANY!! Well, just for some information I BBQ and smoke a lot of meat, chicken, etc..and, I have a personal friend that works at one of the big meat distributors here in town from which I have gotten plenty of meat and filet cuts from and not once have we EVER had any tendon running through them! What a big let down for going here on my birthday. We have been going here since it opened in 2002 or 2003 I believe and after this, we will never go here again!! We're done.  Just be careful when you order a filet And make sure it's not a sirloin. You will get charged $29. For a $8. Steak.  Buyer beware....."}
{"text":"I wanted Korean BBQ, colleagues thought otherwise.  Carraba's is actually a decent Italian chain restaurant, compared to the \"unmentionable garden.\" It was a quiet night, and service attentive. Started with a glass of Chianti, and the Antipasti plus Shrimp Scampi appetizers. The Antipasti platter included fried calamari, bruschetta andfried  Mozzarella sticks. Fried, fried and fried... The calamari & bruschetta were rather tasty. I'm still reeling from the garlic in the Scampi.  Main course was grilled shrimp with the sauce of the day, a three bell pepper sauce, plus spaghetti pomodoro. The salmon was rather tasty, but sauce was OK.  A good place of an out-of-towner looking for a convenient, consistent Italian experience. Now, how do I extinguish that garlic before my meeting in the morning?"}
{"text":"Got the chicken parmesan with pasta on their lunch menu and the chicken soup. My husband ordered the exact same thing (plus one soda). It's been quite some time since we were here last and remembered why when we got the bill. The food is good (not outstanding) but a $35.00 bill for lunch menu items (smaller portions) I felt was not worth it. I saw on Mondays they are offering pick 3 for which includes soup or salad, dessert or appetizer and an entree from a special menu for $12.99. Might go back to try this special but there are just too many other options available more reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I have never been a fan of franchise food chains but I must admit this one is pretty good.  They have an interesting seasonal drink menu that isn't super overpriced and the food is decent, not memorable but decent enough to know I would go back if it were one of few restaurants in the area. The prices are great and portions aren't overwhelming as they tend to be in chain restaurants.  Good bread and olive oil to keep you busy during the brief wait before your food arrives and if you want, they will keep it coming."}
{"text":"We all ordered our food, service at this point was good. My chk Marsalauce looked as if the Sous Chef really screwed up, slightly burnt sauce n little to no mushrooms , terrible, sent back.. My wife had meatballs, served cold with no sauce and a roll torn open! This was not a good experience and would suggest the food for a Dog ! Dinners beware ,!!!!"}
{"text":"If you like full flavored Italian food this is the place. From their wood grilled meats to home made pasta, this place has yet to disappoint."}
{"text":"Listen, I don't just fling around 5 star reviews, especially not for chains. Sorry. BUT: This place where it's at. If you want middle of the road ($-$$) italian food, PLEASE don't ever eat at Olive Garden again. Ever. Say it with me: \"I will never eat at Olive Garden again.\" Okay, good.  The food at Carraba's is tasty, it will never surprise you or floor you, but you know what to expect and it's good quality. This is a franchised restaurant, so each one will be run a bit differently, but I've had very good experiences overall. Service is good, and it's a really great place for a nice but casual date or a family dinner.  Here's the thing, and the real reason for this review: I had the most impressive management experience here. It was actually last summer, but I never reviewed it and can't handle the guilt of letting this good deed go unnoticed. My fiance and I had just finished working out and swimming laps at the swim club at Shea, and we were starving. We wanted Italian, but with options to make it somewhat healthy. At the time we'd never visited Carraba's, but had heard good things, so we went in. Quickly realizing we were underdressed in our board shorts and flip flops, me with wet hair and goggle marks still on my forehead, we just said \"oh, thanks, but never mind\" and turned to walk out.   I kid you not, the manager followed us out and invited us back in. When we said we were embarrassed about our apparel, he offered to take off his tie and button-down shirt and just wear his undershirt if we'd feel more comfortable. I thought he was kidding. He sure did untuck his shirt and unbutton his sleeves!  This spoke volumes to us about the type of restaurant this is; they truly value patrons and make sure everyone feels at home.   I love this place so much, they're catering  my wedding."}
{"text":"Fun Italian chain, we had the Flat bread chicken appetixer and drinks. Very tasty and priced right. Close to home and we're glad as we'll be back."}
{"text":"Have always been a fan of Carrabba's but had a really unfortunate experience here at lunchtime this past week. I will let the photo speak for itself...yup, that's a raw sausage. Not undercooked, or rare, or cold...completely freakin raw. Fortunately we caught it before we are it, so no one got sick. Yuck. :(   2 stars because the server was nice and nobody got E. coli or wound up in the hospital."}
{"text":"I was very pleased with this location.  Since moving to Vegas, I had been going to the Henderson location, which like most chains, was hit and miss.  I was very pleased with my first visit to this store.  The Mama Mandola's Sicilian Chicken Soup was as good as it is at the original two locations in Houston.  It was nice and spicy.  And my Chicken Bryan was perfect, with lots of sun-dried tomatoes, like I like it.  My server was attentive, friendly and outstanding.   I look forward to going back there again soon."}
{"text":"I used to go to the original ones in Houston, where Johnny Carrabba and Damian Mandola started this place.  And the two original locations are still great.  Much like most restaurants, Carrabba's portions keep getting smaller and their prices have pretty much doubled.  I used to eat at the Houston ones about once a week.  However, I can't afford to do that anymore, because of the prices.   Also, they used to have the best crab cakes and roasted red pepper sauce, but they recently redid their menu and I'm quite disappointed that they are gone.  However, the food is still some of the better chain food that is out there.  And the service is always really good.  They recently remodeled and although I didn't think it needed a facelift, I do think it looks even better in there.  A solid choice, but for the price now, there are better choices out there."}
{"text":"Strong craving for pasta led me to Carrabba's Italian Grill. With some decent options on the menu to select from I went with the RIGATONI CAMPAGNOLO. This dish was filling and slightly enjoyable. For the price I feel that there are better options for Italian. This is just a more expensive version of an Olive Garden. Probably would not be a regular spot for me."}
{"text":"We brought my step-daughter out here for her 17th birthday a few nights ago. It was fantastic. I am a little disappointed that they do not sing, but I understand the desire to keep the restaurant quiet for everyone else. :-) They did bring her a fantastic dessert, on the house, and our waitress was fantastic. I wish I remembered her name, but I was too distracted to pay much attention. The food was amazing, and my family that I dragged out who had never been to one before are now in love."}
{"text":"I think this place is over priced. I ordered the baked ziti and was a little disappointing with the quality. A baked ziti from the local NYPD pizza restaurant tastes better and is cheaper. Plus the service wasn't any better than anywhere else, so I don't see the draw.   I probably would eat here again, but it wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"Amazing food as always but the portions have seemed to have shrunk drastically. I  usually split with my daughter and that maybe why??! At $17-$20 a plate I would rather take my money to The Keg and enjoy a delicious steak. I still love this place as the food is delicious and the service is great but the cost  for what you get?? Not sure it's worth it anymore."}
{"text":"We had a reservation for nine. It took an hour to get seated and and hour and half to get our food. The restaurant was closed an we still could not get our good. The food arrived slowly but eventually showed up. At the end of the day the waitress was attentive and the food was good.  Be prepared to wait. In sure there are other restaurants in the area that would appreciate you as a customer."}
{"text":"I usually don't go out for Italian food.  Not if it's the standard fare anyway.   I cook up a mean Italian menu all on my own at home, so generally i don't see the point.  I ended up here with my boss for a quick lunch.  The food was okay & the service crap, slow & unattentive.    I never had a desire to go there & will not return."}
{"text":"I hate to give a bad review of any place, but Carrabas was a huge disappointment.  The only reason for the one star is the managers are awesome, responsive problem solvers.  I am not sure what the issue was with our server.  She brought the drink napkins balled up in her hand and did not even try to smooth them out or put one at each place setting.  She just slapped them on the table.  She did everything she was supposed to do.  She did it with the enthusiasm of someone headed to a root canal.  It took 10 minutes to get bread.  She said that she was \"waiting for it\"  I expected it to be hot from the oven.   It was out of a bag, not even warmed.   My lunch companions said they had excellent food.  I ordered chicken parmesan.  It was terrible.  Salty overdone and a very small portion.  It was partially my fault because I did not want to complain ( it was Mothers day weekend and it was pretty busy).  As I said, the managers were awesome and responsive offering a free meal, free dessert. The host staff was great too.  Unfortunately, that could not make up for the bad food and worse service."}
{"text":"The place is cozy and formal. Service is very professional. Steak is one of the best I've had. Quality of food is worth every penny. Price is very affordable. We had a very wonderful experience. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Dinner was fabulous. We had the filet Bryan which I highly recommend.  Exceptional steaks. Jaime provided great service for us."}
{"text":"A spaghetti and meatball plate that was cooked well. Noodles not overcooked and a salad that was as delicious as well presented.  But the waitress that helped my sister and me, was SUPER attentive and very patient. Her name was Linda. She had a wonderful way of being there when we needed her, and not being a pest. I wish every restaurant had Linda, she made this spot top notch."}
{"text":"First time at Carrabbas. Food was good, the service was great. Everyone enjoyed their dish and nothing disappointed. While, I don't think it matched up to our local favorite Italian restaurant it was pretty good. Here the four star was earned by the great service, friendly staff and attentive manager/supervisor who made sure to come by and check in on us. Would I go again, yes I would . We ordered Chicken Parm, spaghetti and meatballs, small cheese pizza and pan seared scallops. The winner was the scallops."}
{"text":"Joanna was my server and she was very good. She made several good food suggestions and was very polite and prompt to check on my progress throughout the meal.  The lentil soup was very tasty and the perfect temperature. It went well with the warm bread.  The main entree was one of my favorites, veal Marsala with a side of steamed broccoli. Both were excellent. The mushrooms and sauce were a perfect complement to the veal.  Wanted the bread pudding for dessert but alas, I came too late and this popular and super dessert was sold out.  As usual, a very good choice for a great evening of dining."}
{"text":"This chain was one of my favorite places when I lived in Florida, since moving to San Diego I have really missed it. On a trip to Phoenix, I was very excited to learn that there was one there. We went for dinner, and they fully lived up to, and possibly surpassed, my expectations. A lot of people dump on Carrabba's because they are a chain, but to me they embody some of the best attributes that can make a chain stand out in a crowd. My only regret is that we don't have them in California yet. C'mon, we just got a Dunkin Donuts, we need Carrabba's too."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great food, good atmosphere, and awesome service."}
{"text":"Haven't been there in years but use Dine Rewards so I thought we'd give it a try. Looked like they'd remodeled when we first walked in by the bar entrance but I'm not sure. We were seated right away and the first thing I noticed was the booth seat was old, worn out & would have snagged any knit pants or leggings.  The 'host' that seated us said our waitress Jennifer would be right with us. 3-4 mins. later the host came by to get our drink orders. No Jennifer as yet. We looked over the menu and the host again brought us bread & a small plate with herbs. Still no Jennifer.  A good 5 more mins. & Jennifer appeared. She noticed we had drinks. I asked her about the herbs. She said she would bring oil, & offered balsamic vinegar & butter that she returned with. Now we're there a good 15-20 mins and Jennifer finally came by to take our food orders. She only had a couple of tables and it was not busy at all on a Saturday afternoon, but one table seemed very demanding, I'll give her that.   Now we waited!! - we were near the service station & ended up getting more olive oil & refilling our water glasses ourselves - NO Jennifer to check on us. We did see her around the other side of the dining area but she never came past our table once to check on us at all!  Our food was fine, the service was dreadful. Another case of working for a paycheck - period. Jennifer needs to find a job she enjoys. Would NOT return again."}
{"text":"The experience I had today at Carrabas Italian Grill was worse than any other I had ever had here. First we placed our order online. We made a 20 kinute drive to the restaurant only to find out the carryout waitress had forgotten to write down our order! We then waites another 30 minutes while she tried to figure out what had happened instead of simply giving us our food so we could be on our way. Worst. Experience. Ever"}
{"text":"I sat down and some unidentified liquid came out from under the seat cushions and ran down both my legs. It kind of ruined it for me.  I had a napkin and used it on my legs, asked for another one and had to ask more than once, despite that I explained what happened."}
{"text":"I called ahead. When I got there, they still gave me a buzzer. They said because I called ahead it would be 20 minutes instead of 40 minutes. It was still 40 minutes. Aside from that, it wasn't bad. I was hungry-grumpy.   We really like the food though. We might do curbside or whatever they call it there."}
{"text":"The food is always good here, but the friendly service makes it even better! Tonight our waiter Keegan was very friendly, efficient and he had a great positive energy. This quality of service has been indicative of the wait staff and hostesses here at the Chandler location ! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We happened upon this charming restaurant while on our way to Hoover Dam. The waiter was amazing and the food was just as awesome. At the end, the waiter complemented us for being great customers and gave us two free deserts!!! Will come back!!!"}
{"text":"Some of the best Italian food I've had in a while. Everything was very good and my wife and I we're very pleased. I will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Date night! Not big on chains but everything from the apps( Calamari and risotto poppers) to entrees(seafood fett marinara and seared pork tenderloin and asparagus) was REALLY quite good! Doesn't hurt that they feature Peroni on tap!!! Left quite full and satisfied so maybe you might consider a short trek over to Tiedeman and see if I am spot on or clueless... Cheers!!!"}
{"text":"Our experience was horrible when we picked up our food!  They did not season the chicken at all and the sauce was very plain!!!  They only gave us one of our salads, our meals came with one each totaling, two!  I called the manager he lied and said he would send me a gift card to make it up to us, but it has been three and half weeks, still nothing to justify the rip off of meal we purchased!!  Safe your energy and time, eat somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Great place to go right after Church on Sunday. Nice filet, mashed garlic potatoes and great bread dip."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this location for years and by far this is the worst experiance I have ever had. We arrived and they told us it was going to he ten minutes. We were the only people waiting and when you looked at the dinning room  it was pretty empty. The food was below average and the times were horrible. With wait and after eating it took over a hour and a half. Prob won't go back."}
{"text":"Called ahead.  Lost our name.  Waited an hour.  Placed in budiest table next to kitchen.  Staff disorginized and screeming above our table.  Mix up on wine.  Took 50 minutes to receive cold food. 4 star prices at 1 star service.  Never again"}
{"text":"Last night guest and I had fabulous meals  He had the Jonny and I had scrumptious shrimp and scallops.  Gave 4 stars because the garlic mashed potatoes were bland and too loose and waitress kept forgetting to refill my guest's water."}
{"text":"Went here with the fam and service was great along with the food. Kid and I got pizza while my significant other got the spaghetti and meatballs.  Wood fired pizzas were on point, spaghetti was great, and the choice of bread beforehand is amazing. My chika wasn't the biggest fan of the meatballs, and the price is quite high but everything else was great.   Also, if you're an old fashioned fan you have to try their new fashioned. One of the better versions of the old fashioned I've had here thus far in AZ. Cheers guys!"}
{"text":"Love this place. As chains go - Carrabas is among the best.  Try the pork chops!!"}
{"text":"Food was good, service was better! Good enough to go back again with a nice warm atmosphere. To eat, had the Caesar salad and the mushroom prosciutto pizza. Salad had old lettuce but fresh slices of Parmesan cheese. Pizza was great, very lean prosciutto and the crust was nice and crispy with a great charred taste."}
{"text":"It's the only chain we ever eat at... and we always sit at the pasta bar. Love the Chicken Bryan and Chicken Rosa Maria. Deeeeeelicious!"}
{"text":"We took  my mom to Carrabba's for dinner for mother's day.  We didn't call ahead but our wait was only 20 minutes, even though it was crowded.  When we were called to be seated, the hostess asked us if we had any moms with us and when we said yes, they wished us a happy mother's day and showed us to our seat.  After she handed us our menus and told us the name of our server, she presented my mom with a little bag full of treats.  :) The food was good and the portions were actually normal sized.  Our appetizer of spinach dip with crab.  It was delicious!  For our main courses, I ordered the chicken parm with the cavatappi amatriciana.  The chicken parm was good and the pasta had just a little bit of kick to it.  My mom ordered the veal piccata with garlic mashed potatoes.  The veal was tasty and the mashed potatoes were creamy and had the right balance of garlic.  My dad ordered the Pollo Rosa maria and said it was very good.  The chicken was tender and the sauce wasn't too heavy.  My husband ordered the penne franco with chicken and he liked it a lot.   The service was really good and the staff was friendly.  When we are in that area of town and feel like Italian food, I'm sure we'll be stopping by there again."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Good specials. The sangria was delicious. It has a nice atmosphere. You can sign up for email coupons. Good location."}
{"text":"We just enjoyed another fabulous meal with a nice super Tuscan bottle of wine.  The Pollo Rosa Maria is always excellent!  Tonight was $10 off the entire wine list so we splurged in a really nice wine.  Our server was just the best and Josh, the GM made sure our meal was perfect.  The restaurant was pleasantly busy and everyone seemed to be having a good time.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Buyer beware!!!  I bought $800.00 Of gift cards for Christmas 2017 here because they were giving a $10.00 gift card for every $50..00 card purchased. We were not TOLD. THEY WERE ONLY GOOD until 02/18   When we went to use them at Bonefish tonight we were told they were expired !!!  Plus if they had been good, only 2 could be used at a time.  What a total ripe off!!  What a ripe off. Needless to say we will never spend another dime there!"}
{"text":"The hostess' were clueless.  We almost left because we waited for almost 20 minutes and she kept the front door open allowing tundra winds to blow in.  There were at least two other tables open when we got to our table.  The server and the food made up for it though, so that is why they get four stars.  I had the chicken soup with a salad.  Crisp, fresh and just the right amount of food with the bread that you can easily fill up on.  We also ordered the lasagna, which was delicious. Cheesy and generous with the meat."}
{"text":"Never left hunger or less than satisfied. Great food, great service, and the sangria is amazing! It's reasonably priced especially for the quality and consistency."}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend went there for the first time on Saturday and we very impressed. We sat at the bar and the bartender Ashley was very helpful and kind. By far one of the best waitresses I've had in a while. It made our first visit more enjoyable.  The food was really delicious and the they had everything timed perfectly for everything to come out at the right time. Absolutely loved the service and the staff! Definitely coming back to this location :)"}
{"text":"I have been employed at Carrabbas for almost 2 and a half years. As a server we are required to try everything on the the menu.  Our food is made from scratch and we don't have microwaves. I love the food there!! I probably gained 10 pounds. My husband and I go quite often there, our children love the mozzarella marinara and the calamari. My husband loves the wood grilled salmon and I love the chicken Bryan. Our happy hour is fantastic!! Our happy hour is 7 days a week. Monday- Friday it's 4PM-7PM Saturday and Sunday it's from 3PM-7PM.  All tap beers and our Cosmopolitan, Pomegranate Martini, Carrabbarita on the rocks and Razzmitini are half off.  Our house wines and homemade sangrias are on special as well.  You get a quartino for the price of a glass. A quartino is a glass and a half. Our sangrias are delicious!! We have peach, red and blackberry sangrias. Certain well drinks are also half off.  All drink specials are through out the restaurant and all our appetizers are half off in the bar only. On Monday nights we have Amore Mondays, this is a great dea,l it is a special menu where you get a great deal for your money.  This menu comes with your choice of an appetizer or a dessert, an entree and choice of soup or salad starting at $12.00. I hope you come and visit us and try us out, I guarantee you'll love it as much as I do!! Come and ask for me (Giselle)"}
{"text":"My mom has been raving about this place for 2 weeks , since she had it in Texas.  She came out last week and recommended we go try it.   The food was very very light on the sauces , but that is easily fixed .. ask for extra sauce.   The 2nd time my wife and i came for the sirloin marsala... w\ extra sauce.  They cooked the steaks PERFECT.  I havent had a steak cooked that decent in quite a while.   The bread and dipping oil\herbs is very tasty!.    The wait staff we have had both times have been excellent.     We will definintly be back."}
{"text":"I ordered take out for the family, and over an hour and 10 minutes later our order is still not ready.  I'm still not sure why it is taking so long on a take out order.  Once we received our food an hour and 20 minutes later and returned home, we found our $8 dessert was missing.  When we called to have the missing dessert removed, they tell us they don't do that.  Hmm, must be nice to not have to return money for goods not provided.  Thanks for robbing us of our time and money, even if it was $8.  We won't be back.  We suggest others don't do take out at the very least."}
{"text":"Seriously. One of the best Italian places I have been (even if it is a chain). My husband is a fanatic of Olive Garden but we came here with my family since we were visiting. I really, really liked the food. They sat us quickly as we had a party of 9. The bread was fresh and the soup was pretty good. I really loved the red sangria. I have drank many sangria's before and this is one of my favorites, not too sweet and not too alcoholy. Anyways, I ordered the Pasta Sostanza and my husband ordered the Mezzaluna. We literally inhaled it. My pasta was really good with mushrooms, spinach, and chicken. The sauce was to my liking as it was really light. My family was super stoked on how good the food was. Service was excellent as our server refilled all of our drinks and was on it with everything. The prices are reasonable and ambiance was relaxing that night."}
{"text":"Seriously the best pasta I've ever eaten. I think it was fresh not dried and I have plenty to enjoy later!! Everyone in our party of 7 LOVED their meal. The bread and oil was warm, delicious, and plentiful. Our party ordered pizza, 2 different soups, 2 different salads, chicken parm, chicken marsala, shrimp w/prosciutto, gluten free pasta pomodoro, and kids meals. Drinks were great and the service was outstanding esp for being NYE. We used the call ahead seating and were seated in less than 20 mins. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"It was my second time at this location.  The spicy sausage soup was totally delicious.  The service was excellent and quick.  Just the entree was a little plain for the price I paid.  I ordered Veal Marsala."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Carrabba's Italian Grill for ages, but over time they've fallen off.. went with my family the other day, and I can't complain about the service! Servers were responsive and helpful, but they've gotten rid of items off their menu and replaced them with items I view as less superior. Still decent food, and just a little too expensive for my taste as well!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I decided on Carrabas for our anniversary quick dinner out.  We walked in on a Friday night, told there was a 10-20 minute wait, within 3 minutes we were being seated! Server was great, knowledgable and on it!!  My husband ordered the Fillet medium, it did come rare, however I still give 5 stars because we were so impressed with the way they handled it.  They took the fillet on a separate place so he could still eat his sides while they fixed up the fillet. When it was ready, a manager brought out a whole new fresh plate fresh fillet! Very impressive while I believe most restaurants would have re heated.  The server comped us our drinks and all our food was VERY good!!  Will go back for sure."}
{"text":"Where to start? We drive 3 hours to get here to Cleveland several times a year due to lots of family in the area & we love this place... Hostess was friendly. Server was pleasant, polite & efficient. The food was excellent. The time from ordering until we received our food was short. Atmosphere was clean & pleasant. I was surprised to not see many photos of food here, so I took a lot to post..."}
{"text":"Better than Olive Garden but my waiter forgot my salad.  Pricing is reasonable and food is average-  crab cakes are bad-  pizza is ok-  lobster ravioli was good.  Hit and miss."}
{"text":"We had a really good experience here yesterday. I was wanting a steak with a little pasta and knew this was a place that did both.  We had our 2 kids with us and it was nice to see their kids menu had more than just mac and cheese. They even got some raw pizza dough to play with.  The ambience is definitely that of a chain restaurant but the food came out extremely fast and didn't overlap. Salads came out nearly instantly after we ordered, kids food shortly thereafter as requested, and after we finished our salads, mains came out promptly.  My fillet was more towards the rare side than medium rare, but flavor and texture were wonderful. Pasta had a bit too fiddly of a sauce but did the job. The butter cake dessert was devoured quickly by our quartet.   Overall, a pretty good meal!"}
{"text":"I was hoping for a great dinner but it fell short of my expectations. It started off with nice portion of bread and a good chicken soup but went down hill when I got the entree. I ordered the pork chop Marsala and my spouse ordered the chicken Marsala. Both meats were char broiled, The charcoal flavor was all I could taste.  I would have preferred sauteed or baked. There was not much sauce either. I did get two pork chops but they where a bit dry .  The chicken was tender and moist but is was a bit small and we both got the larger portion in hopes of taking some home but that did not happen. The cost per meal was $17.99  Service was good but they need to work on the main dinners."}
{"text":"Went there on a Tuesday.. My husband & I sat at the bar.  Tabatha, was tending bar.  She could not have been better !! Very sweet & knowledgeable about the menu!!! I ordered the chicken Picata & my husband ordered the chicken parm..the whole dinner experience was great!!! Can't wait to go back !!"}
{"text":"Had a nice night out with family at Carrabba's and left wondering why I don't go there more often . The atmosphere is comfortable, the service was very good, and the food was tasty. For our meal, we had the zucchini appetizer and the mozzarella sticks. The zucchini was very flavorful but the mozzarella was a little bland. For my entree I had the scallop and shrimp pasta in a vodka sauce. The shrimp and scallops were cooked well and the pasta was on point. The sauce had a hint of spice but in no way took away from the seafood. I enjoyed it a lot, but my wife felt it lacked punch. My wife's lasagna was very flavorful and provided her the pow of flavorful she was looking for.   The only negative is the price point for dishes is a little higher than expected but would not keep me from coming back.  Overall, we loved our dinner night out and will go here again."}
{"text":"Last Thursday we went to Carrabba's to celebrate that my mom had become a US citizen. Our server and manager on duty were great to us. They went out of their way to make our visit extra special. Highly recommend this location!"}
{"text":"Someone told us they have great wood fired pizza, so we really went for that over anything else. the bread was warm and fresh, and the dipping oil was flavorful. Wished our server told us the ingrediants liek the server at the next table. Pizza was good, but wouldnt drive here just for that. Salad was average, at best."}
{"text":"No wonder this restaurant does not have a crowd on a Saturday.  When we walked in, we encountered the most miserable looking, unpleasant, non-speaking hostess.  She did not mumble a word, not even \"Hello.\"  Another hostess came from the back and say us.  Then the waitress was no better.  She was very short on words and unfriendly.    The calamari was salty, my Fettuccine Weezie was like a $0.99 frozen pasta dinner, my boyfriend ordered Lasagna that smelled like mop water. We did not eat our food and she did not question it. Oh, and my food had  a big splash of marinara on the inside of my plate near the food.  I was I shock that they sat the plate in front of me like that.  First and last time for us."}
{"text":"Every time we've been here it has been a great experience. Tonight was no exception. Marsha was our server and she was awesome. Attentive, thorough and just an overall pleasure. I had the lobster ravioli and it was yummy. Came with choice of salad or soup. Food came out quickly and hot.  We always get there early around 5:30 and there is never a wait. Fills fast closer to dinner time so get there early in order to get a good seat."}
{"text":"I have been there 100 times.  Their Minestrone soup is literally delicious!!  Sometimes i Just go there for that soup.  In general, food is so worth of your visit."}
{"text":"Great meal and great service by our waiter. Brian, the manager, was very unpleasant to deal with when we entered. The restaurant was not busy as it had many open tables, yet he insisted on making us wait 15 minutes. This was uncalled for, even the hostess look confused by Brians direct order to make us wait 15 mins. Isn't the old saying \"The customer should never have to wait to give you his/her money.\" We waited, and thank goodness, the food and service by our waiter was top notch. Will return, hopefully with a better initial experience. 4/5 stars."}
{"text":"We live near this restaurant, so frequent it a lot. Each time we've been there, the service has been excellent! The mood is always friendly, upbeat, & if you have a b-day, the singing superb! Only one complaint - and it's a biggee - the food is always too salty! they need to cut back on the salt on their soups, entrees, everything!"}
{"text":"The Carrabba's happy hour has always been a favorite for me and my gf. She isn't a beer drinker, so the 9oz glass of house red or white for the price of a 6oz glass is clutch. And my $3 Peroni's and $4 well drinks keep me going as we eat a full meal from the half priced appetizers. Start off with the tomato caprese which comes with fresh burrata which is so warm when it comes out and spreads like butter on your bread! The zucchini fritte's are fantastic to have on the side and you can won't be left hungry after getting the mozzarella sticks, the seafood options and the Italian wings. Even on days when we are starving, two apps each fills us up and is still cheaper than any other sit down restaurant, with the added perk of boozin' up a bit.  Just a word to the wise, make sure you're sitting in the bar area or else they can be a little finicky about giving you the happy hour prices."}
{"text":"Wow the portion sizes have reduced drastically with the price increase!! My husband ordered the $19.99 Spiedino Di Mar and it looked like a kids meal! I'm not sure if the portion reduction is only at this specific Carrabas since he ordered the same dish in Detroit a couple months back and he had leftovers.  I noticed my spaghetti and meat sauce was smaller as well especially since my 2 year old daughter ate half of it after eating her cheese ravioli kids meal! We will most likely not be returning here."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time recently. It was a typical chain place, but very good. I had the chicken canneloni and it was excellent. We didn't have to wait long for our food, the waiter was friendly and quick. However, we were seated near the open kitchen. At first I thought this would be a good idea, because I enjoy watching people cook. Then I started listening to various conversations going on between the waitstaff. I could not help but notice one particular waiter running around asking the others if they have ever seen the movie \"Waiting\". Then he would giggle. The members of the staff clearly had a little more intelligence and either pretended not to hear this kid or just blankly stared at him and walked away. If you have seen \"Waiting\" you know that you don't want to hear a waiter talk about it. Luckily, our waiter had nothing to do with this. But overall, good place. Don't know if I will go running back right away, but we will keep in our rotation."}
{"text":"It was good, reminded me of Olive Garden. I had the Lobster Ravioli. It was delicious. Worker were nice and friendly and the service was great."}
{"text":"We recently dined here for the first time and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of food. We had just a 20 minute or so wait for a party of 7 on a Friday night at 6:30 so my hubby and I ordered drinks from the bar and sat outside to wait. The drinks were well made, the outside patio really nice with a breeze and kept clean. In less then our quoted time, we were sat at our table and though it was close to other tables and in a walkway we never did feel bothered by staff or other guests walking by. My hubby couldnt find what he wanted on the menu and our waiter suggested an off menu item that had a sampling of a few chicken dishes and my hubby absolutely LOVED it. Although, knowing it was a $25 dish beforehand would have been nice. The kids meals all came out quickly and were pretty good portion size. My pasta was perfectly cooked and had great flavor. the only downside is the appitizers seemed a bit small for the price but overall the food was excellent and our service pleasant and swift. We will absolutely be going back."}
{"text":"Great food, kid friendly!  Our server brought fresh dough for our kids to play with while our meal was being prepared:-)"}
{"text":"I decided to give this a try because it's near my home. All the food is cold and flavorless. Unfortunately, it's another terrible chain restaurant. Never again!"}
{"text":"Carrabba's has rarely disappointed me, and this visit was no different (4/1/17 ~730pm EST).  We were sat without a wait.  Natalie our server was terrific, she always checked on us, cleared any empty plates, never had to ask for a water/drink refill.  She was tipped cash, and well over 22%.    I had the Chicken Bryan - excellent.   To any servers/waiters/waitresses:  This is only my opinion, but the service I get is just as important, if not more, than the food I've ordered.  I expect to be checked on every ten minutes or so, or even just eye contact from your perch/wait station.  Personally, every time I have look up, or ask for something again when I've already asked for it - your 20% tip decreases by a point.  I always start at 20% - giving you the benefit of the doubt.  You are in the service industry - if you treat every patron/table with the same attitude and greeting you get at  Rik-Phil-A, I guarantee your tip margin will increase.  Not having to ask for something b/c you the server anticipated it - I add points to the tip, which is why Natalie got a +22% tip."}
{"text":"Went for a family supper and we all had the parmesan crusted chicken salad.  It was delicious!"}
{"text":"I love Carrabas and know some of the cheeses are salty but I do think some items are too salty. I like salt but not that much. However the food is delicious and waitstaff very attentive."}
{"text":"had a wonderful time.  Wine was good, the appetizer, grilled asparagus with prosciutto, was tender and very flavorful.  My friend had the Chicken Bryan with pasta and I had the Pollo Donna Maria with baby spinach and garlic.  It came out hot and was yummy.  Karen cleaned her plate and I couldn't finish mine.  the only draw back was our server, who's name I can't remember, had a tad too much cologne on.  He was very personable and nice but when I was tasting some wines, I couldn't smell them, all I could smell was his cologne.    Other than that, it was a wonderful evening with a great friend who was heading back home to Canada!  Much thanks to all."}
{"text":"Everything was fine, service, food and drinks. I give them three stars but thats only my opinion. If in the surprise area and you want some Italian food that's fast and decent, this is the place. I would go back again if someone in the family had a craving for Italian food."}
{"text":"I got in late from the airport and was surprised this restaurant is opened later than normal. Immediately upon walking in we were greeted at sat down. Our waiter was right there getting our drinks. My husband ordered calamari and I had some small plate mozzarella balls. We both really enjoyed them. I loved the sauce with the mozzarella balls because it has a little spice to it. My husband ordered Veal Parmesan and I had a pasta with chicken. Both were cooked well and had a lot of flavor. The thing I liked the most about this restaurant was the service. The manager came twice to make sure everything was good and we never had to wait for drink refills. We will be back!"}
{"text":"After seeing all the 2nd pasta helping commercials on TV, my boyfriend and I decided to have Italian for date night. We were seated promptly upon arrival but noticed an odd smell coming from the dining room. The wood burning grill was close to where we were seated but it smelled off. Our server was slow to arrive for drink orders and my boyfriend kept having to drink my water because our server neglected to fill water. I ordered a glass a wine, which of course was delicious. Bread came and was honestly the best thing we ate all night. I loved the olive oil and spice mixture! I ordered the pasta Carraba and a Caesar salad. The salad was really over-dressed and the dressing had quite a peppery kick. I like pepper but not overpowering. For the 2nd pasta helping, there were only 3 options and none of them resembled the pasta on the commercial. The pasta I ordered was very disappointing, very mushy. The chicken was grilled nicely but for $15.50, the pasta wasn't prepared better than what I could have made at home for a lot cheaper. We skipped dessert and took my leftover pasta home. I did like that we were given bread, olive oil and spice mixture (since that was delicious). It has been a while since I had visited Carraba's and now I know why. Everything was mediocre and for me, I don't like visiting places that are just OK."}
{"text":"The reason why I only gave two stars is because of the $16 lasagna. Lasagna is supposed to be layers of filling in-between noodles. But there was only one 5\" long strip of soggy, overcooked noodle at the bottom. On top of that was a mixed up mess of sauce, ricotta cheese, etc.  It s very salty.  Melissa, our waitress was appropriately concerned, and apologized. She said someone was checking out the lasagna back in the kitchen. But her manager was doing an interview. Why was the manager not available during lunch hours of a Saturday afternoon? We were not offered any compensation at all."}
{"text":"Our server Leslie was grumpy and rude. Bread was stale. And food was just okay. Not a fan. Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"First time for me and what a great experience! We went during happy hour and what a good one. Ryan was awesome and the food was spot on. We told him this was a gift from a friend for our anniversary and as we were leaving, he asked us to wait. He came back with a dessert on the house to celebrate. Manager Soyla made it a point to go out of her way and engage us. She spent some time getting to know us and even cleared our plates. Leadership by example. We will definitely be back and have already shouted out on Facebook. Thanks for making a few rough days for us a highlight!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I love Carrabba's.  We love the atmosphere and the food, of course.  I've had the chicken marsala, salmon and pasta dishes.  All were delicious.  We love the bread with the olive oil and herbs mixed in - so good.  On the rare occasion that I had a negative comment about the food or service, the management went overboard to make us happy. Could not be more pleased."}
{"text":"I've been to many Carabass locations and by far this location has the worst chef of them all. Everything was way too salty from Calamari to Alfredo sauce. The server was trying her best to accommodate but...  If you are on low sodium diet avoid this place."}
{"text":"We really enjoy our visits to this restaurant. The staff is great and the food gets better and better. This restaurant has hands on management. Our chef Pablo cooked my husband's sirloin perfectly to the requested medium rare. A big thick \"baseball\" type piece of meat. Their seasonal zucchini veggie side is sensational....Joining the diners reward club was one of the best moves we have made, but it is the good food that draws us back to this restaurant time after time."}
{"text":"Great food. Service is great a bit pricey but worth it. Love the bread. The chicken in all of the various forms here is great. Red sauce is good too. They have togo which is great when you want to eat a good meal in you sweat pants and watch netflix."}
{"text":"Only one star because I had to give something. I will never visit the establishment again. I have never been spoken to so rudely from the buser!!!  If you want customers you better figure out how to talk to them!!  We have visited several times and have always sat in the bar.  When we walked in tonight there was one empty booth that was dirty and all the high tops were empty.  So we sat in the booth waiting for someone to clean it. When she came over to clean it she informed me that in the future we need to check in for a table first and she doesn't appreciate us just sitting down. I politely said oh I'm sorry I thought the entire bar area was open seating.  She said very rudely well it's not.  I said that's fine I will go somewhere else where they don't speak rudely to their customers.  I got up to walk out informed the front to let their manager know they just lost a loyal/repeat customers and that we would never visit again. After leaving the same buser followed us outside yelling at me to stop and talk to her.  Needless to say I didn't and walked away."}
{"text":"Five star for the food. 4 star for the service. Our waiter was great at first. The problem is, he like to walk by and see how far along you are in the appetizer before getting the salads, then waiting the same before getting the main course. He waited to long between the appetizer and salad, The meal was awesome, after dinner coffee also very, very good.  There were a few glitches. Hostess seemed a little lost. She was cleaning off some tables and wiped all the crumbs from the table to the floor. She did however sweep up some of the mess on the floor. I have a sensitive sense of smell, not good when one of the waiters was wearing to strong of cologne. I like a short wait between foods, but he missed the mark between app and salad. I Will definitely go here again."}
{"text":"Yay for Carrabbas...after a bad experience with trying to get into The Outback next door we went to Carrabba's instead and goes we did. We got seated in about 20 min on a busy Friday night and the service was great! The food was exceptional and quick. I got a wood fired pizza and the wife got a steak. The only thing she didn't like was her salad... too much hard iceberg lettuce but the bread was hot and fresh from the oven and they serve it with delicious olive oil. Thanks Carrabbas for making our date night complete"}
{"text":"Will update when i have a better experience.  Not worth talking about. Maybe they were too busy, but not the greatest service."}
{"text":"It's been a while since we've eaten here, however like a sign of the times, carrabba's has gone downhill. They have literally shrank the size of the meals. Watered down the mashed  potatoes, and overall cut the Quality in half. Whatever you do do not order the crème brûlée."}
{"text":"I have got to say, coming in on a Sunday morning for an early lunch to this carrabbas was such a great experience. Order the MezzaLuna it was so good! Not only was every piece of food we had delicious the service was beyond amazing! Our server SAM was so upbeat, had a great attitude the entire time, and overall made our first time at Carrabbas perfect. I asked to speak to the manager, only because I had never experienced such extraordinary service. JESUS the manager was so nice, had a smile on his face the whole time, and was such a sweet guy. I will definitely be coming back to this place. And letting all my friends and family know to ask for SAM. Thanks gentlemen for making our Sunday morning an amazing one!"}
{"text":"I recently took my wife for a nice lunch at Cabbera's. We were pleased to see that they were open for lunch at this location.  The same high level of service and attention were in place. From the greeting at the door to the great service. As per normal the quality and taste of the food vas very good. The sausage and lental soup was perfact on a sunny fall day.   The spaghtetti and meatballs ordered by my wife was excellent on all levels. I had ordered pasta in a light sun dried tomato sause which was wonderful. We both enjoyed the hot fresh bread anice addition to the meal. All in all a very nice relaxed Saturday lunch."}
{"text":"Just like macaroni grill.  Not a fan of oily over-cooked pasta.  The salads are overdressed and super salty.  The serivce was terrific even though it was Mother's Day."}
{"text":"I used to love Carrabbas but this location continues to disappoint after multiple times. Service is terrible, food sub standard. For equal value, superior food and outstanding service go up the street to Antico -if you can get in."}
{"text":"I had the chicken Parmesan. It was really good. I enjoyed the bread with the oil and herbs as well. Our server was so aloof. She never brought us anything without us asking. Empty glasses on the table should signify we need more drinks but we didn't get refills until we could flag her down. I flagged her down for more bread but she didn't refill the empty oil plate. She had cheese on the tray when she brought us our food but didn't offer it to us. She just was not attentive and barely payed any attention to us."}
{"text":"The wait was a little long, and it really seemed like they went out of order when they started seating. I went up and expressed my concern, and then we were immediately seated.   The waitress was very personable and friendly. She quickly got our drinks and orders. She appreciated that we were ready to go with our orders as soon as we sat.   We were able to share a dish and salad, and we still got stuffed!   The food was better than Olive Garden, and even tasted more legit and fresh."}
{"text":"The Spaghetti Bolognese never fails - for me, this is the true test of a restaurant that claims to be Italian. I've tried most of the dishes here - from the appetizers to the main entrees - everything is just seasoned and cooked perfectly. The quality and taste of the food is the same and has not changed a bit since I first dined here. How does someone do that consistently for more than 10 years?! Truly amazing! I am really glad that I went back because tonight, Carrabbas did not disappoint! Mangiamo!"}
{"text":"First and foremost, I want to praise our waiter. I cannot remember his name for the life of me (I want to say it was Nick, but I'm probably wrong). He was a pretty mono-toned guy. Anyways...whatever his name was...HE WAS INCREDIBLE. I have been a server for a few years and I know how hard it can be to keep up on refills and table touches when a restaurant gets busy. But he was on the ball!! He was just the right amount of attentive. He made the visit that much better.  Now, onto the food. It was alright. Nothing incredibly special. The portions are tiny. And my alcoholic drink I had gotten had WAY WAY WAY too much rum in it. However, I drank it anyways because it was a Saturday night and I had a long week!  All in all, the visit was great. I'm not sure I'll go back because the food wasn't anything spectacular, but the service was top notch."}
{"text":"This restaurant cannot handle large groups for lunch. They  ran out of bread and lemonade and the pizza oven was not working. Additionally ,our group had to go to the waiters station to get our bill and pay at the station. The food was pre-ordered but still took a long time. They ran out of bread for my chicken parm but two orders in my group came out after and had the sandwich bread. Come on people, shouldn't i get bread? If you're out of food and drink, you shouldn't open for business. DON'T TAKE A LARGE GROUP TO THIS RESTURANT AT LUNCH, A HOT DOG STAND WILL HAVE BETTER SERVICE!!!"}
{"text":"We love this place because of the great customer service. The manager Giselle and our server Keegan went above and beyond to give us a good experience. Giselle gave us a free appetizer because of the birth of our son. Thank you much. There's only a few things that we don't like, iceberg lettuce in our salad, the portions could have been a little bit more considering the price and they also need to bring back the same cooks that did the Shrimp Damien because the shrimp scampi does not compare."}
{"text":"The drink presentations are not the same as another location but it still tasted great and that's all that matters. I had the stuffed pork chops with squash ravioli and it was amazing. The flavors where phenomonal. I also paired the dish with the recommended glass of wine. My daughter's thought their food was amazing. As they put it, it made them want to cry. Our waiter Jason kept our cups filled and checked on us as much as he could. He was helping with a fairly large table across from us. I don't know if the lady that stopped by was the manager, but she was friendly as well. Another bonus, we waited for all of 5 minutes before we were called to our table. I reserved our table online and it was so worth it. When we checked in the hostess advised us that we saved 10 minutes on our wait time, but it was actually more because we didn't wait long at all. I will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Not what I expected the food is pricey and I wouldn't have had a problem with that if it was seasoned however my food tasted bland and so did my 3 other friends. Maybe it was an off day? Who knows but the people there were friendly and there was a nice atmosphere :)"}
{"text":"Located on the strip. . . not THE Strip, just a long, long strip of strip malls full of chain stores endlessly repeating themselves until you start to feel more than a little insane.  This eatery appears to be one of the better options amidst the sea of Applebees, Taco Bells, and Burger Kings.  Standard American-Italian fare, is what you'll enjoy here, with lots of bread and large portions, which were quite welcome to our table of hungry hikers and climbers.  The tomato-basil soup was divine and the chicken marsala with mashed potatoes was A-ok.  My friend had some sort of lobster pasta that she was still swooning over the next day.    Service was energetic and pleasant.  Prices are higher than what you'll pay at other places on this \"strip,\" but the food is noticeably better.  This is no destination restaurant, but if I found myself driving up and down Charleston again, I'd happily eat here again.  Tip: If it's your first time here, don't try to big-time it and act like you've been here before.  If they learn you're a virgin to Carrabba's, you get free fried zucchini sticks!  (I might be a virgin every time! - Ladies, don't try that at home.)"}
{"text":"Second time eating at Carrabba's. First time was in St. Petersburgh, FL. The Carrabba's at 1740 S. Clearview, Mesa, AZ was another excellent experience. Our server, Mason, was on the spot without being obtrusive, helpful, and completed the service with nothing but pleasantry and professionalism. Food was great. Desert was decadent. Manager, Josh, was friendly, informative, and runs a damned good crew."}
{"text":"An italian chain restaurant that doesn't deluge you with pasta.  Nice selection of pizzas, pastas and chicken and beef entrees.  Good selection of salads.  Food is ok, not as fresh tasting as some.  Portion size is appropriate for price.  Service is good.  Ok place to stop for some Italian food."}
{"text":"Love this place, hands down! Great location, I think best sangria ever, if you know another place please let me know .  Because red sauce kills me I'm all about the pasta wessie.  Great Cesar salad.  Must try"}
{"text":"Always a great experience at Carrabbas. We love to come during happy hour and sit in the bar for cheap drinks and half off appetizers. Happy hour is during the week from 4-6:30pm. Drinks are half out in entire restaurant but the half price apps are in the bar area only. Food and service is always consistently good. Our server during this visit on a Friday night was Mike and he was fantastic!! So down to earth, friendly, and provided excellent service.   We started with appetizers of Wings and Burrata. The wings are baked and then tossed in butter and spices and served on a cast iron skillet so they are crisp and delicious. The burrata caprese is our favorite!! It's the best I have had and it's so refreshing when added to their fresh hot complimentary bread.    Normally I get the chicken Bryan which is to die for!!! But tonight we tried the lamb chops that were on the seasonal menu. We had never had lamb before and wanted to try it. It was served with grilled veggies and a salad that were both good. The cook was perfect and had good flavor. Honestly I don't think I'm a big lamb person but if you are, I'm sure you would love these! It was great to try.  There is so many great items on the menu and the portions are good size. The meat is always so juicy and cooked to perfection. You can tell the fresh ingredients they use on everything. It's a little more pricey then most places but for the quality I think it's fair. That's why we try to go during happy hour because you can't beat half price appetizers.  Great service and excellent food always! Highly recommend! They always do a wine and food pairing menu once a month which is fun to attend. I have been once and it was a great time. Hoping to come back and try it again. It's about $40-$50 a persdepending on menu but you get a 5 course meal and 5 wine pairings. Sign up for their emails to learn more."}
{"text":"Came in for dinner tonight and sat in the bar. They have happy hour in the bar from 4-6:30pm. Cheap drinks and half price appetizers. Service was great and the restaurant is huge and beautiful. Blackberry sangria is great!  For appetizer we got the tomato caprese burrata which was only $4.50 on happy hour and they give you a large portion. It was delicious! The tomatoes were crisp and the burrata was great. We made our own bruschetta with the free sourdough bread they serve to start.  The bread was served soft and hot so it was delicious. You also get a salad before your meal which was just ehhh boring for me. I would switch it and try the soups next time.   For the entree I got the Chicken Bryan with side pasta. It's was INCREDIBLE! I have never had that juicy of chicken in my life!! It is covered with a lemon butter sauce, red peppers, and goat cheese. The goat cheese makes it so good and elevated. The pasta was also super good. Their marinara is tasty and you can taste the freshness. My husband got the Pollo Rosa Maria and he enjoyed it. Again the chicken was so tender and juicy. His was served with garlic mash potatoes that were smooth and creamy.   Overall everything was super good and looking forward to coming back. The prices are higher then most Italian restaurants but I feel the quality of the food was worth it. Great place for happy hour and special occasions."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this place.  Generally I am not a fan of chain Italian.  Tried  not to overindulge in the warm bread and oil/spice combination without much success.  Had the crab cakes for appetizers and the chicken trio for my main meal.  For my my side I chose pasta.   Everything was really good.  Very generous portions, enough for lunch the next day.  I will come back.  The service was excellent.."}
{"text":"Food was great! Our server was so rude though! He was very demanding, pulled the menus out of our hands. Wanted to do everything his way. Not good costumer service!"}
{"text":"The food is good, but how hard it is to make good Italian food - after all, even the O Garden can get that right. But this place believes itself to be \"exceptional Italian food\" (which is obvious from the exorbitant prices they charge) and it is not even close. No originality, just another offering of the same tired old foods that every other place is making.   This is a prime example of what has become a scourge in Vegas eateries of late - high cost, low atmosphere, mediocre cuisine offerings - where people with more money that taste go because they know nothing more about food except the belief that \"the more it costs, the better it must be\".  Oh and then there was the WORST greeting any bartender could EVER utter:   \"I'll be with you in a minute!\"   Could I mean any less to them? If I wasn't meeting somebody, I would have walked out."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this Carrabba's for a few years, and I've only ever had one lackluster meal. The spot in Mesa isn't great, but this location is the most consistently spectacular eatery I've ever been to.  The Chicken Bryan (grilled chicken with lemon butter) is as good as food gets. I always get it with a side of cavatappi, also covered in lemon butter, and a bowl of chicken soup. As far as appetizers go, I love the meatball ricotta flatbread, and the basket of bread they give you at the start of the meal is always appreciated.  If you feel like quality Italian food, this place can't be beat. The food, service, and ambiance are second to none."}
{"text":"Was a bit bummed with this Carrabba's. Maybe they've changed a lot over the past few months I haven't gone here or maybe it's this location.  Let me preface this with how much I love their appetizer bread and that little herb/spice mix that you dump the olive oil on...It is FABULOUS. I could seriously eat that all day if I let myself.  Appetizer was fried zucchini. I was a bit startled with it. For a moment I thought our server was bringing us fries! Batter was a bit too salty for my taste and the zucchini itself wasn't so bad.  I ordered a chicken Caesar salad...The chicken was massively salty. I'm still drinking tons of water to flush that stuff out of my system! Dressing was fine, but I dislike it when my salads drown in it and I forgot to ask for the dressing on the side. My fault!  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good, either. Service was wonderful, but the food itself...*sigh* not that great.  I remember the other Carrabba's being a bit salty as well, but I enjoyed my food. I'll have to give this location another shot because it's so close to me."}
{"text":"Carrabba's is a treat for me. I know it's a chain. Believe me, I know.  But usually most restaurants that are chains are chains for a reason - they're good enough and consistent enough with enough appeal to many eaters.  This is the case with Carrabba's.  My friend Cathy ordered the Mezza Luna - ravioli that was stuffed with some yummy ingredients and a tomato cream sauce. She let me have a couple of pieces and I let her have some of mine. I ordered the Rigatoni Martino - chicken, sun dried tomatoes, mushrooms and a creamy tomato sauce.  It was lovely. Really lovely.  However, an hour after dinner, I was developing this unholy thirst. Like, I needed water, NOW. I guzzled a lot of water after - about 3 liters, but I was *still* thirsty. I noticed my rings were a bit tight on my fingers.  Uggh...it was too salty. Mercifully they didn't use MSG, but I hope they will cut back on the salt. Even as I write this almost 24 hours later my fingers are still swollen. :(  Service was A+, food was good, company was good. All in all, a great dinner with good food."}
{"text":"Did not have a good time here.  My husband's food was cold in the center (on an eggplant/ lasagna dish), and the service was nothing to write home about.  I thought it would be a great date night, but it turned out to be fright night, instead. Skip."}
{"text":"I was a long client when it came to Italian food a few bad experiences and we stop coming. Recently we decided to try again. Unfortunately it was not to our liking. The Tuscan Chicken was burnt, lobster ravioli sauce was water and not \"creamy\" we did have excellent service and everyone was very kind. I don't recommend coming here."}
{"text":"Place is a Joke! First, forgot one of the entrees in our To-Go order. Then they say that they cannot credit the credit card back for the forgotten item. Obviously untrained, as it can and has been done anywhere and everywhere. Was told they would credit my account for the next order. LMFAO! Save It, as we will NEVER order from here again!"}
{"text":"Carrabba's is a solid chain restaurant. Pleasant American-italian atmosphere with Rat Pack era crooners in the background providing the soundtrack to your evening. Friendly and prompt service. The fresh bread with herbs and EVOO is dangerous. My husband and I both ordered from the \"Amore Mondays\" night special: three courses starting at $12.99 which consisted of a choice of appetizer or dessert, soup or salad and an entree.   We both selected the prosciutto wrapped pork tenderloin entree which was cooked well. Still moist with an excellent grilled flavor. I ordered the calamari appetizer which was lightly fried to a prefect level of crispness. It had a pleasant tangy flavor with the lemon and marinara sauce. Definitely plenty for two to share. My husband had a Caesar salad and I enjoyed the house salad with the dressing on the side. For dessert, my husband ordered  the John Cole for us to share. Two scoops of lusciously creamy vanilla ice cream topped with Cinnamon rum candied pecans and caramel sauce. Yum!  My only complaint is that, as with many chain restaurants is the case, the kitchen is heavy-handed with the salt and the preparation of the dishes adds more calories than are necessary. That being said, I absolutely believe Carrabba's is worth a visit. If you're more happy with the consistency chain restaurants provide, this is an outstanding choice."}
{"text":"Okay so the truth is they have some really good things and some bad. I don't understand why the steak is so hard to eat. Cooked good, good flavor but full of grizzle. This will be last time i buy a steak here!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Italian restaurant. Started the meal with dipping bread and a creamy garlic salad. The rigatoni was excellent but you must like spicy food! With a cold brew it was perfect."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner and was very disappointed. Server was polite, no complaint on service. Ordered the  Fettucine Carraba with gluten free pasta. Pasta was undercooked and the sauce was extremely bland. Chicken was okay but kind of dry even with the light, bland sauce. Caesar salad with the meal seemed like t was out of the bag and had too much dressing. Would not recommend. 2 out of 5 because wine was good and server was polite."}
{"text":"I sat down to eat my \"to go\" dinner and had to stop just so I can leave this review...  Please, see photo. I am utterly shocked that this meal cost me $28. Look at my sorry spread. Look.at.it.   This is by far the SMALLEST portion of spaghetti I have ever seen come out of an Italian restaurant kitchen. Are you kidding? Also, had I not asked for extra meat sauce I would have gotten semi dry spaghetti with a sprinkle of sauce, in a pool of water. Water, you ask? Yes, water, because the sauce it was not cooked long enough -- a rookie move. If the \"chef\" needs a cooking lesson, I can stop by and show him how to make a real meat sauce he can actually be proud of.  This mess was $15. If I were a cat I'd HISS right in his face.   I was DYING for a minestrone soup tonight. This one had a very lovely abundance of veggies, especially napa cabbage, which I love, but it had very little flavor. $8 for a soup that I had to finish at home with more seasoning and spice. I ordered OUT because I didn't want to cook or modify anything or drive more than 4 minutes.   I feel like this was a robbery of my craving. Absolutely tasteless. ALTHOUGH, the Caesar dressing was very good. This I loved.   This meal left me dissatisfied and wishing that I would find $28 on the street somewhere tomorrow so that I at least would get something out of this.   *** The to-go server, Scott, was a doll. Thanks for the extra bread!! I give you 5 stars. ***  Managers, you get a zero for not following up on negative reviews. Your job is to manage the reputation and keep customers happy."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch with my daughter. We were seated right away the waitress was very nice and checked on us a couple of times. I ordered the house salad that was really good and the alfredo that was tasteful. A little on the costly side but the food was good."}
{"text":"I come to carrabba's a lot and I know it's Father's Day. But, when we arrived they told us it was a 30 min wait.  We waited and waited , then we asked after 45 min and they said 30 more min.  If they would have said 1 1/2 hours to eat, we would have went elsewhere.  With 4 kids waiting this long is crazy.  If your hungry go elsewhere. Food is good but service is just poor."}
{"text":"CARRABBA'S ITALIAN GRILL A 9.5 DINING EXPERIENCE  On a trip from Southern California, my wife and I (retired seniors, 74 and 70) decided to go to Carrabba's Italian Grill, at 5646 Bell Road in Glendale, Arizona. Thursday evening, about 8:00 pm we pulled into an uncrowded parking lot, expecting another 9.5-on a scale of ten-dining experience like the one we enjoyed at the Scottsdale location, months earlier.   The restaurant interiors are dimly lighted, modern and comfortable. The restaurant was about 60 percent full, and we were quickly seated and greeted by personable waiter. After a discussion with the informative waiter, we ordered our favorite dishes: The signature combination called the Chicken Trio (three half chicken breasts cooked to perfection each served with special sauces, Bryan, Marsala and Rosa Marie) with a side of Fettuccine Alfredo and two (large) glasses of Pinot Grigio house wine . The Chicken Trio is more than one reasonable person can eat, so we choose to split the meal. The delightful Caesar salad arrived quickly, following later by freshly baked bread and a packet of spices, which we dipped into the extra virgin olive oil from Spain. The Chicken Marsala was wood-grilled and topped with mushrooms, prosciutto ham and Lombardo Marsala wine sauce. The Chicken Bryan was topped with goat cheese, sundried tomatoes, basil, and lemon butter sauce. The Pollo (Chicken) Rosa Maria was stuffed with Fontina cheese, mushrooms and basil lemon butter sauce.   While it was not old school Italian cooking, as a retired veteran of the Newport Beach restaurant scene (courtesy of corporate expense accounts), I can state that the food and wine was superbly delicious. The split Chicken Trio, side of pasta, two salads and two glasses of wine along with tip and tax, cost us $48. It was another 9.5-on a scale of ten-dining experience. The taste of the food lingers in your mouth for hours. As my son would say, it was pan-licking good. Check out the menu at: http://www.carrabbas.com/Content/menu-signature-combinations"}
{"text":"I just posted 9 photos. Looks 5like there has not been a review for a while on this restaurant. We went 5-15-16. My birthday- we are regular travels to Italy- and cook this type of food often. After looking at our choices we chose here. Rodney our server was fantastic. He offered a variety of  choices to taste  for our first time. He knew details and ingredients of everything we asked. He was quick on his toes and stopped by often to make sure we were happy. I described each dish in the photos- over all we would go back. I would have given a 5 star- but it real need to be more for a 5."}
{"text":"everything was really delicious. Mussels were cooked right, not rubbery.  And the linguine pascatori was cooked to perfection as well. Wine was good service was great."}
{"text":"As a post-Valentine's Day date for me and my favorite valentine, we chose this Brooklyn location (first time for both of us).  I tried making reservations over the phone, assuming it would be a busy weekend for romance.  I was told they don't take reservations, but they do have a \"call ahead\" system that will let them know we're coming.  I have no idea how that helped them or us, as we still ended up waiting half an hour (in a very (!) crowded lobby area) to be seated.    How can that be safe or sanitary with servers and restaurant staff weaving in and out of standing-room-only patrons?     Leah, our server, made it all better.  After our wait, we were sat in her section.  What a delight!  Not only was she super nice, but she did her job well.  We came two hours before closing and it was packed; and yet, Leah was smiling and pleasant and made us feel right at home the entire time.  We knew what we wanted to order right away, so she got us started on our glasses of wine (prosecco and blackberry sangria - yum!), warmed bread and garlic oil (double yum!), and the to-die-for bowl (get the large!) of Cozze in Bianco.  We completed our meal with an order of the Chicken Bryan and Sirloin Marsala.  With as busy as the restaurant was, I had a few fleeting images of the show, \"Hell's Kitchen.\"  You know, when the cooks fall apart in the kitchen because of the demanding crowds, the food suffers, and Gordon Ramsay's head starts spinning? Thankfully, that was not the case for us - with our perfectly prepared chicken breast and steak medium-rare.  Everything was spot on!  Leah kept our bread basket filled and treated us like friends.  Once we made it through the crazy lobby situation, the rest of our experience was worth repeating."}
{"text":"No joke, Carrabba's is the best Italian food my husband and I have eaten in a restaurant since our trip to Italy five years ago.  After a full day at Cedar Point last summer, our friends took us here for dinner.  Had I not been told, I never would've guessed this was a chain.  The way they took care of us (free slice of pizza while we waited for our table), the romantic lighting, the engaging (not over-the-top) way our waiter served us, and how special the food tasted (clearly, prepared with love), was a step up from other places we've tried in the area.    I highly recommend the Cozze in Bianco (mussels swimming in a garlic-butter broth), Sicilian Chicken Soup (better than mom makes, unless your mom is Italian), the Pollo Rosa Maria, and the Spiedino Di Mare.   All four of us left with gluttonous grins on our faces and enough garlic on our breath to stop a horse.  Make that a stampede of horses."}
{"text":"I had the pasta weezie which has tons of shrimp and mushrooms with their signature lemon sauce. It was a large satisfying portion. The new decor is also a nice touch. We on a Wednesday night and to our surprise the place was completely pack."}
{"text":"We went with the family last night to this location, knowing they offer the smaller meals now that we all seem to be watching our portions.  We were met at the door with a wine sample, of which we ended up ordering a bottle with dinner. I ordered some ministrone soup, which was filled with veggies, and was pretty good.  I also ordered the create your own pasta with tagliaroni and garlic and oil.  It was SO salty, I couldn't finish it.   The rest of the family had spaghetti and meatballs (that was good), lobster ravioli (it was ok), veal marsala (mom said it was really good) and chicken marsala (dad said it was really good). I think I will stick with the spaghetti and meatballs next time."}
{"text":"It was clear they were having a personnel issue the night. We could sense something was off but but cool headed management prevailed and salvaged the night. Food and service were great. Our waitress, Arteshia, was exceptional."}
{"text":"Meet up with some girlfriends on sat night at Carrabba's before we headed off to go play some bad bingo up the road. My best friend and I were not that hungry so a meal wasn't something we wanted, we decided to split some appetizers and desert haha, the best of both worlds don't you think?  For the appetizers, we went with the Bruschette and Tomato Caprese. The Brushette had caramelized onions & crispy bacon in melted mozzarella, and that was perfect! The onions were sweet from being in the pan caramelizing, and the bacon had that crispy salty taste, salty/sweet combo is one of my favorite things. It was so good!  The Tomato Caprese, oh I can't even describe in words the taste, it fresh, clean, summery, just perfect. The mozzarella was creamy; this was a great lil dish! So perfect!   Then we ordered the Tiramisu and the Dessert Rosa to split. The Tiramisu, was very eye pleasing when the plate was presented to us, but it was just too much for me, it tasted like a very drunk tiramisu, the lady fingers were very soaked in the espresso liqueur, or it could have been the rum in the cake, either way, it was too strong for me, which bummed me out because Tiramisu is one of my favorite desserts.   The Dessert Rosa, which just by reading it, I wasn't very thrilled about it, but my best friend swore it was good when we ordered it. When it came to our table, it looked very plan next to the pretty tiramisu, but let me tell you I missed judged this little dessert, it's a butter cake that has this sweet cream, fresh slices of bananas, strawberries, and pineapples and whipped cream. I swear it's like this ice cream free banana split, dang so delish!!  I'll never underestimate this dessert again!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Carrabba's and it was a go-to spot for us at lunch. Now they are only open Fri-Sunday for lunch which was a HUGE bummer. So we decided this would be our Friday special BUT they don't have a lunch special now... Overall we are very disappointed. I understand money controls when you are open and what not but this will definitely hinder us coming in now.   :("}
{"text":"I was getting my tires fixed over at discount tire and the wait time was an hour and a half. I took a walk outside to find a place I could spend my time in and I found this Place. It's hidden so you have to stumble across it. Ashley, the bar tender was a professional in every manner. While being enjoyable to talk to she made drink and food Suggestions that included house made recipes and even served small samples to taste. Everything was very good and I will definitely be visiting again."}
{"text":"I am surprised I have not checked in or reviewed this place.  My inlaws LOVES this place.  We meet up with the inlaws for Sunday dinner.  The staff is always friend, helpful, and attentive.    My chicken soup was salty.  I order the Pasta Carrabba (Fettuccine alfredo with grilled chicken, sautéed mushrooms and peas).  It was basically noodles with olive oil & a few sliced grilled chicken with no alfredo sauce.  Bummer!"}
{"text":"This place had wonderfully prepared fish that melted in your mouth!  The portions are fairly large so I had a difficult time finishing my meal.  The wine selection was fairly nice as well.  The servers were spectacular , bursting with personality.  It is a little louder than some places, but as long as a little noise doesn't bother you, you're sure to have a wonderful time with a delicious meal to boot!  I'll definitely go again!  Yvette L. Brownstone from Ventura, CA"}
{"text":"This restaurant is one of my preferred chain Italian restaurants. The food quality has always been good. The bread with oil is good, like the house dressing and the Chicken masala, veal masala, chicken parm, lobster ravioli are my preferences. Obviously not your mom and pop Italian restaurants but is one of the better chains."}
{"text":"This place is a must-dine every time I'm in the valley for a couple of reasons. I really enjoy the fried calamari, which includes rings and tentacles (some places don't) and it's a major step up from the Olive Garden, another Italian chain which is right down the road.  I am giving the place five stars for a combination of excellent food and really outstanding service. Our waiter did a great job and had the timing down real well. At this place there are bartenders, waiters and food runners so you have to keep that in mind when it's time to tip. Generally all three have a hand in what arrives at the table. That being said, it's a challenge to keep them all in order and this Carrabba's has it down to a science.  I had the Lobster Ravioli entree which was extremely rich, made with a buttery white sauce. The ravioli were not scant. For apps we enjoyed the calamari and mussels in garlic white wine sauce. Bread pudding was the dessert.  This place is a solid bet for a great family meal on the weekend."}
{"text":"Let me start with service it sucked they didnt even check on use the food was bland and ravioli was sour the mussels had a lemon taste and that isn't a good flavor and the waiter was to busy on his phone and seating down instead of attending his tables this was my first and last experience there and I will never go again"}
{"text":"Love the warm homemade bread and the fresh house salad with the house dressing. Nice portions and great service. The Alfredo sauce is so delicious. Asked for my pasta al dente and it was perfect. Thank you for such a memorable evening"}
{"text":"We have eaten at Carrabba's so many times they know our names when we come in, so I guess it's about time I review them :) Great location and rarely a long wait, the service is consistently very friendly and attentive! I can honestly say that I've never had anything less than perfect here! Favorite is the Chicken Parm which is made very well for a \"chain\" restaurant I'm from the East Coast very Italian area and eating from a Chain restaurant is almost against my religion!!! Carrabba's does have a Mom and Pop feel to it though we have talked with the owner on occasion and the managers consistently check it with diners and you have the feeling that they genuinely care about your experience...in these tough times seeing so many places close down I think it's very important to know that you will get good service and a value for your dollar!  Recently tried the Sicilian Skirt Steak with Bruschetta Salad and it was melt in your mouth delicious! I recommend the Desert Rosa for dessert it is very light and fresh and a perfect ending to a perfect meal. I think that anything on the menu will be great!  I really can't say enough about Carrabba's except Mangia! Mangia!"}
{"text":"First time here and sorry to say it will be our last. Only reason for 2 stars was because of our server Wallace J. He was very good and very nice. Otherwise it woukd have been 1star.  The new parm chicken arugula is a precooked frozen chicken patty.  The broccoli i ordered with it was pre-frozen not fresh and mushy. 15$ for frozen food  My husband ordered sirloin and wanted it med-rare and was given well done. Ordered mashed potatoes as his side with fettuccine Alfredo. Didn't get the mashed potatoes and Alfredo was not fresh either 19$ but only because they took off the 3.50 they were going to charge for the mashed he didnt get it.  To much money to be getting packaged frozen broccoli, chicken and noodles."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me last week for dinner, because I love seafood, the food was awesome, everyone was nice and it was super clean! The only downside it was a bit pricey so we might just make this a fancy date night instead of an ordinary day place for us. I would come back and I would recommend"}
{"text":"Portion sizes keep getting smaller and smaller prices keep getting higher and higher, Service is always great though"}
{"text":"Awesome food and service Also not a loud place...thats a big plus for me."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat.  I always take the family on Mondays.  Great service great food and great people"}
{"text":"We realize that if we want some good Italian food, our hands are pretty much tied. For my wife's birthday, we wanted something a little more than Oregano's and a little less pricey than Tutti Santi. Let's face it, Carrabba's is just that middle man and their recent advertising spree had our mouths watering with images of plates filled with authentic looking Italian delights!  What we received however was a cross between what I would expect Astronaut food and Jail food to taste like.   Before I unleash my furor, I would like to say that there were a few positives regarding our experience.   1. The kids loved the mozzarella sticks. 2. The bread was piping hot. 3. The water and the drinks were cold.  4. The pasta portion of my wife's dinner was hot. 5. The waitstaff and manager were \"nice\".  Starting with our server, she was nice enough but I am certain that she had neither washed her uniform or her hair in the past two week and on a 4-top, was handing us our drinks rather than placing them on the table. Who cares right? Terrible service is the norm here in Gilbert. At least she was nice.  When our appetizer arrived, the calamari was literally inedible. It wasn't burned either, it was a light golden brown in color. Of course it is frozen calamari, of course it comes in a bag... We aren't sitting on a pier in San Francisco, I get it but I swear, this bag had been sitting open at the back of the freezer collecting every bit of flavor the other foods had to offer while simultaneously losing every molecule of moisture. This stuff tasted like cardboard... origami calamari anyone?    The manager graciously took the calamari away from us and gave us more mozzarella sticks... deep fried luxury right there. Sadly, he had the nerve to offer us more calamari.  I could go on and on but the bottom line is that the food was sub-par. Worse than my already low expectations could handle. Now, I fully understand that managers and cooks are people too but the managers really need to step their game up at that location.  1. Make sure your staff look professional. Not disheveled, greasy and dirty. 2. Look at the food you are serving. My calamari was paper thin. My chicken Marsala came with 2 half full scoops of (instant?) mashed potatoes and a double (not cut in half) chicken breast covered in overly salty, non-cooked off raw wine tasting \"mushroom\" sauce. 3. Cover the salad in the walk in... the grated carrots tasted like EVERYTHING in the walk in.  I doubt that anyone deliberately did anything to sabotage our meals just the same as I doubt anyone thought they were doing anything wrong... which is the most frightening part."}
{"text":"I usually LOVE Carrabas, but this location won't be seeing me again anytime soon.   They were out of crayons and had a cocktail menu that was only 3 drinks deep. Sound like a good combo to you?  No crayons? No drinks? Don't they know what a mom needs?! :) I asked for a drink list. They stared at me confused and pointed to the 3 drinks.   Our server was most likely new. We were at a round table, yet he leaned over the entire front of me and my full plate to fill my husband's tea, placing his armpit neatly over my face. He didn't bring bread or silver wear until we asked. But he was nice, which IS important.   It's been about a year since I've been to a Carrabas. Not only have the names of some entrees changed, but so have the portion sizes. Down with size, up with price. Nice. My husband always enjoys paying $16 for a handful of pasta and pasty sauce.   I got the Caesar salad. Limp, room temperature, gross. Not typical of what I'm use to from this chain . Also, the spices they put on the plate with olive oil for the bread was super salty.   My youngest was offered broccoli but they came back to say they were out. It happens. The kids pizza was bordering burnt - 0.5/4 slices were eaten.   We ALWAYS get calamari. This time it was fried too long. I think we got the bottom of the bag because the pieces were tiny and extremely greasy. Shiny greasy. Grease.   You know that awesome lemon butter and pepper sauce they serve with the calamari? It was unrecognizable. Like a small bowl of yellowish brownish oil. Kinda looked like Papa John's new garlic crud (not the nice creamy one from the 90's), but still tasted ok.  More grease.   Anyway, when I am spending money that took me more than a day to earn, I really want my money's worth. Didn't happen. Won't give them another chance. I worked hard for that bill!   As always the bread was good. My Coke was good.   The tiramisu was super good. 2 stars good. I really want another piece."}
{"text":"Super excited to bring our boys last night to celebrate end of season game & band performance & try Carabas for the first time.   Walked in we were the only ones there. Thought there would be no wait.  A party of 7 came in after us then a party of 3. Everyone was seated, except us. After a long wait we finally get a table.. we noticed that almost half the restaurant was empty.. the food was ok nothing worth coming back for.. soo disappointed, we were really excited to try this place."}
{"text":"As always Carrabba's was good last night.  I got my sirloin steak with the blue cheese sauce (it could have used more sauce but that's my personal preference).  When we first started we sat at the bar and the bartender was excellent. I sure wish I got his name because he certainly deserves a complement. The food was great, the service was great, one small problem I had was with the hostess.  I had asked her if I could purchase a gift card and I was told I needed to purchase it at the bar.  I explained to her that my father-in-law was sitting at the bar and I was purchasing it as a gift and I didn't want him to see it. She then told me, well wait until you get seated and then you can go to the bar purchase it.  She then proceeded to do nothing.  There was another hostess next to her so I don't think it would've been a big deal if she had left her station for only a few minutes to help me out.  What I didn't care for  was how she talked to me, teenage like but authoritative like I was a child.  That is why I deducted a star. I sure wish I got that bartenders name though he was friendly informative and you could tell he really loves his job! Oh and the steak was good!"}
{"text":"Great reliable Italian food!  I have been to a few Carrabba's now and though I prefer to eat local and not a chain - this place is great if you have picky dinner companions.  I had the Chicken Serrantino (the small order was about $13 dollars) and it was one piece of chicken with eggplant on top and cheese and delish sauce (tasted like the marsala sauce to my buds) - YUM!  I picked the mashed potato side - it was a large helping and I couldnt even finish it!  I have also had other chicken dishes here and all are wonderful.  The waitress provided dough for our 6-yr-old dinner companion to play with and eat while we were waiting.  Very nice!  They brought her food out first which was awesome.  The entire meal was so quick and efficient it is the perfect place for kids!  Love it!"}
{"text":"NEVER AGAIN! This is the second time in the 20 years since I moved to NC that I've ventured to this location. Unbelievably the same thing happened tonight. My family and I were seated right away. And then sat for nearly 15 minutes looking at menus without so much as nod in our direction. The restaurant was not busy and there was plenty of staff congregated around the kitchen. Tables in our area were attended to while we sat without even a drink order being taken. I even told my family about the last time my husband and I went to this Carrabba's and were seated but never served. Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me. There won't be a third time. DON'T GO TO THIS LOCATION!!  I've visited the Concord location with coworkers and didn't have a problem. Just like the last time we got up and walked out. I told the TWO hosts at the host station that our menus were still on the table since no one came to see us. All I got was a \"Really?\" No attempt at service recovery. I left AGAIN feeling disappointed and disrespected. I'm done with Carrabba's."}
{"text":"Had lunch today. Great staff, great food, great service. Manager Lindsay always greets us with a smile. Would recommend this restaurant to friends and family."}
{"text":"Great service! Spencer was amazing!!! That being said, if you like Marsala, don't eat here! If you like straight pepper, this is your place!!! If you like cold penne, this your place! Bad food, great service! Thank you Spencer, for being the only positive experience!"}
{"text":"Had dinner tonight and the service was great but the food wasn't worth the money. I had lobster ravioli and I think they were frozen from the local grocery store. Very very little lobster and really no lobster flavor. My wife had scrimp and scallops which was better than my meal. Next time we're in the area we're going to OG."}
{"text":"I used to love going to carrabba's but not anymore.. Food is overpriced with small portion taste is not great , salad is small bread is good but everything else is mediocre ."}
{"text":"I was really impressed. Atmosphere is nice and the service was great. I ordered the norwegian salmon and it is the best salmon i've ever had."}
{"text":"Dont go to this place. All assholes working here. Food and service both not good. Its worth to go to Concord location."}
{"text":"Last night is the last night I will be dining at Carrabas. I like the food but the service is terrible. every time we've gone lately ( and I mean EVERY time), we don't get our wine until a very lengthy time after we order, after we are done with our salads and our main meal is coming. Last night we saw our wine just sitting at the bar forever, and eventually when I got my wine it was wrong . A few visits ago, we had to show the server how to open a wine bottle. Are you kidding me?!? Last night the hostess was taking in front of a lobby full of customers how overwhelmed she was and how a server wasn't cooperating with her. We Almost left right then and there, and I wish we would have. We go out to relax and enjoy a beverage, which is very hard to do when the staff is complaining, visibly stressed, and it is near impossible to get said beverage."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant on Saturday night and found that they do not take reservations but were told that you can call ahead to put your name on a list. We waited for 45 minutes as people who were aware of this came in after us and were seated right away. When we finally were seated in a cramped booth no one came to the table for 20 minutes with even a water. We asked several times for a server until we were fed up got up and left. The manager was not very helpful and does not seem to have a handle on what is happening at this restaurant. Will never go back or recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Seriously - I love their daily specials that I'm willing to drive 20 minutes to Westlake for this stuff. Happy hour specials are great. Tuesday small plate special (3 for $12). Pollo Ross is amazing. Wednesday is pizza night! And the calamari is some of the best around. If you're getting a soup, spicy sausage lentil is amazing!"}
{"text":"Don't bother using their call ahead service apparently that doesn't mean you've made a reservation. Was told by the manager that it isn't a service that the restaurant actually uses--despite that it's on their menus and displayed in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Not too crazy about Carrabba's. There's nothing especially bad about it, but nothing especially good either. One thing I like though is that you get a soup or salad, plus bread, with your meal. You definitely get full here. However, the flavors weren't developed, and overall everything we ordered was pretty bland (except for the veal Marsala). Also, it's kinda pricey. To be honest, I could make better Italian food at home."}
{"text":"Won a gift card from my work to go here so decided to try it. First time customer. Food was over priced for the portions and quality. Our waitress decided we were no longer important once a party of 20 came in. Extremely disappointed overall. Thank God our food was free with the gift card. I would recommend going half mile down the street to Olive Garden."}
{"text":"I'm over this place. The last two - yes TWO - times I've been here our food has been served cold.  First time is a mistake. Second time is a habit. I really wanted this place to continue to be our Italian joint, but that is not to be. So sorry, Carrabbas, it was nice knowing you."}
{"text":"Carrabbas has great food but even greater customer service.  I recently used the Mesa location for a catering order for 60 people. There was an item missing that the restaurant manager noticed before I did. She left me a voice mail offering to deliver it to the party but I didn't check my phone until it was too late. A few days later the general manager Chris called me and went far behind all expectations in making up for the mistake.  His understanding and commitment to customer satisfaction ensured a return customer for life."}
{"text":"We have eaten at this restaurant many times  Our favorite is Chicken Bryan.  This visit was extremely disappointing  Our Chicken Bryan was horrible  Chicken was dry almost no lemon caper sauce at all  When we sent it back we decided to switch to Lasagne. It was brought out by a lady and not our server. We tried it and it was cold. Like frozen and microwaved but not long enough. So the lady took it back and they apparently nuked it longer and our original server brought it back.  We decided to just eat it anyhow since we had by that time drank most of the 53.00 bottle of wine.  When I was leaving I saw the same lady and asked her if the manager had been notified of our returned entrees. She told me she was the manager. I was disappointed  they did nothing for our poor experience even though they could have easily done so. We were a profitable table since we had a bottle of wine, an appetizer, desert and coffee. All of the high profit items for a dining establishment. She only promised me it would never happen again. I can also promise that since I will now find a new favorite Italian restaurant since there are quite a few to choose from. I would recommend anyone reading this review do the same."}
{"text":"Sry food. Sry service. Broccli taste like sardines and the ceasar salad like raw fish."}
{"text":"A family meal was nice and enjoyable for four of us. The family reported the place slipped a bit in menu quality a couple of years ago, but now seemed to be up to par. We all enjoyed our martinis, wine, food and desserts."}
{"text":"Went out to dinner here with a few of my girlfriends and it was an overall positive experience. Our waitress was nice but she went MIA for a little while. My ice water was always full which is something I would expect when going out to somewhere like here. I had the baked ravioli which was delicious! I would recommend stopping here if you want a delicious meal but don't expect real authentic Italian food. Great service most of the time and nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Went in w/ a coupon + a takeout order & was still treated very well. The ravioli was good, but the bread & salad is among the best I've had in a while. I'll be back, the coupon worked."}
{"text":"I'm a So Cal girl.  We don't have Carrabba's in my state.   If they did they would put Romano's Macaroni Grill out of business.  We had the Shrimp Scampi & Asparagus wrapped in Prosciutto appetizers. They were amazing.  The Lobster Ravioli is good as well as the Shrimp & Scallop ala vodka was yummy. Ken our server wonderful and took great care of us.  Thanks Ken for making our first visit such a pleasure."}
{"text":"The one star is for the buser that offered comp desserts; after not being aware of the experience we had.   All our drinks were watered down with ice. The server had no interaction besides \"are you ready to order?\"   Our apps, salads and entrees had failed to fall on a course line with the food all pouring out of the kitchen at the same time; to make things worse my entree was cold. I would have sent it back but the server failed to appear to check the status of over priced meal.  Apparently stacking app plates, salad bowl and empty martini glasses on the ledge behind us wasn't hint enough.   Thank goodness she was timely with the bill; don't think we will be back. My words to the management are to promote the buser and host!"}
{"text":"I ate here a few months ago and the food was good so I decided to place an online order since I was in the area. When I got home, which is no where near the establishment, I found that they didn't give any bread even though on the receipt it clearly said yes. When I got to eating the chicken it was very dry and tough, so tough my steak knife didn't budge that well. Very disappointing so I called the place and asked for a manager. After being on hold several minutes a guy answers and asks how he can help me. I tell him why I'm calling and he asks my name then says I never did an order there. With only 2 in town I'm 1,000% sure I know where the food came from. Then he says \"oh let me get you the manager.\" Isn't that who I asked for in the first place? Yes it is. Then a guy gets on the phone and I have to repeat the entire thing over to him and he acts like I'm making it up... Very unprofessionally handled and he should not be a manager. My relationship is over with carrabbas."}
{"text":"Great food and service for a reasonable price. The atmosphere is nice too. You will leave here satisfied."}
{"text":"Just enjoyed the Monday night special, which was a ridiculous amount of food (so lunch tomorrow is going to be awesome!) All the staff at this location are really friendly and our server...Patrick I believe...was just great. He was attentive and very efficient without being over the top. Great guy! Thanks making our Monday better!"}
{"text":"Contemplated for a while whether or not we wanted to try this restaurant so we decided to finally try the place.   The staff could not be anymore friendly! But the food was not good at all. We ordered $10 crab cakes which looked like they were microwaved from a box. They had minimal taste and were not easy on the eyes.   Our food came shortly after and looked very pleasing. Surprisingly our meals were displeasing with tasting almost too dry. The pasta wasn't completely cooked thoroughly but it wasn't that big of a deal.   Overall, I gave two stars because the staff there were very accommodating. The choices from the menu were also pretty general."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere, clean, restrooms are clean and don't smell like piss. Menu is confusing to some but to me it's a culinary delight. The Alfredo with anything in it really, is terrific, the pizzas are like slices of heaven. Soups are excellent. Salads meh, could be better. Sauces are fresh and tasty. Staff bends over backwards to be nice an accommodate you. My wife loves it, my kids love it and I love it. Ate here dozens of times and never a bad meal. Just please bring back the giant stuffed meatball! Hahaha"}
{"text":"We went to this place 2 weeks ago. The one in Avondale is really nice, the food is fantastic and the ambiance is great. The Surprise location??? Complete Garbage. It was comical. The waitstaff is a mess, atmosphere is gross, and the food meh. The beer wasn't even cold. If you go to Carrabba's SKIP THE SURPRISE LOCATION go to Avondale. We have gone to the Avondale location a few times and each time it was sooooo good. Never again will go to the Surprise location."}
{"text":"Warning:  You are NOT Safe Here Let's start with a lovely dinner with fine food and great service.  HOWEVER, this is where it goes completely wrong from this point forward.  We were sitting at one of the bar booths with the side door behind me, and as I was eating my salad, a disheveled, unkempt man staggered into the bar area.  The door was not locked, so all he had to do was wander in.  He proceeded to sit at the bar and LOUDLY yells out a Happy Mother's Day wish the bartender.. this is December 3rd... the Manager came over and repeatedly asked  the man if he was going to eat, harassed him about what he was going to eat and how he was going to pay for it.  The vagrant becomes irritated and mumbles constantly.  Pay attention now everyone.  The Manager LEAVES and there is no one left but the vagrant and customers.  The man proceeds to try and sit down at our booth and eat my food off my plate.. we didn't invite him.. we didn't even make eye contact.  I was scared and thought maybe he was going to get violent since he was already agitated.  My husband yells NO, and I yell NO as well from sheer fright.  At this point, NO ONE else came to investigate the yelling.  Instead, The Manager comes to show his cell phone saying he is going to call the police, but never ACTUALLY CALLS. The vagrant then left the bar, but it was some time before anyone, except the server, came to check up on us or to make sure the vagrant actually LEFT.  We stayed in the restaurant another half hour just because we weren't sure and no one said anything to us. I wanted to enjoy a nice dinner with my husband, and I ended up in a situation where no one protected me but my husband.  The manager never came back.. he sent the server to see if \"we were OK.\" well after the vagrant left the restaurant.   We put up a brave face and just wanted to leave at this point.  However, we were given cheesecake instead and the bill. OK.. I get it.. things are sometimes weird.  HOWEVER, these are food service professionals in a somewhat high-end restaurant.  I should be concerned about food, not my personal safety.  They didn't a) call the police, b) lock or secure the side door,  and c) address the situation with everyone in the immediate area in case anyone else was feeling frightened. Does Carrabbas really care if we were alright or are they more concerned about keeping up appearances then the safety of the patrons.  Is this policy for all Carrabbas?"}
{"text":"This was the most delicious chicken Parmesan I've ever had! The accompanying pasta was done to perfection! Service was fast and courteous! I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Typical busy Friday night. Foodies won't appreciate a predictable classic meal from a chain but we sure did. Mmmmmm bread pudding.  That is all ;). Good stuff  Dean was great, and the wine list was too. See you next time."}
{"text":"Service was TERRIBLE!  The waitress' name was Jessica and she ignored our table after dropping off the food. She had NO manners. Other waitresses picked up the slack, but still not good enough. Waitress looked like it was miserable to work here."}
{"text":"great food, great service. Recommend you sit at bar or at the kitchen bar. Steaks are great. You have to try the shrimp scampi. best most consistent I have ever tasted. nothing has ever come close, not even mine when trying to recreate from web recipe. I ate at a Carrabbas about 4 times a week for a year back in 2000 and always was satisfied. If ever their was a problem it was taken care or immediately."}
{"text":"great Italian food that is cheaper then other places. the free bread came with oil and herbs dipping sauce. Loved the bread and the mozzarella sticks for appetizer is delicious. For dinner i got the chicken Parmesan with fettuccine Alfredo pasta. It was on the chef special so i got a Cesar salad, onion and bacon flat bread and the chicken parm. Loved the choices they gave me and it was cheaper then most places for a 3 course meal. the place wasn't very busy and the manager came by twice to see how we were doing. Our waitress was nice. I'm sure we will be back again but i rather go to olive garden, maggianos for the chicken parm."}
{"text":"I've lived 5 minutes from this place like my whole life and I finally made it a point to go! I ordered the pollo Rosa María and it was quite delicious very tasty and the chicken was cooked to perfection. My boyfriend ordered the lasagna and said it was very tasty as well. The service wasn't very good though she was very short and didn't check up on us at all. Nonetheless I would totally keep coming back to try out all the other different plates!"}
{"text":"Nice family style atmosphere. Our server was very attentive and helpful. They provide bread to start with olive oil and dried oregano/herb mix which was nice. For my entree I got the sirloin steak cooked to my preference perfectly with a spicy butter sauce and a side of mashed potatoes so not a standard Italian dish but still a decent meal. I also had the spicy chicken soup to start which was good but not actually very spicy. For dessert we got the apple crostata with vanilla ice cream on top which was really good! Was glad we finally tried this place but not sure I'd go out of my way to come again but there wasn't anything negative about our visit!"}
{"text":"The food was fine but the service was awful. We waited over 20 minutes for the server just to run our cards. The place was empty and we waited for water, bread, even to pay for our food! We will not be going back."}
{"text":"The worst restaurant we have been to in Charlotte. We should have just walked out when we saw that the floor had not been vacuumed in quite some time. We were seated by the window, at a dirty table. When the server arrived we ordered our drinks and our entrees that came with a soup. The drinks and soup came along with the bread. But, the hostess and server both did not give us silverware, and we had to ask. The oil for the bread came later, and not with the bread. Then within minutes of getting our soup our entree arrived. I had the chicken Marsala which tasted terrible, and my husband had the Fettuccine Alfredo which he said was ok. The only good thing about this place was the soup. Will never go here again."}
{"text":"can't believe i didn't come here sooner! it definitely gets crowded on the weekends, but we didn't wait any longer then 10 minutes if that. prices were very reasonable. service was FANTASTIC, our server Jessica was AMAZING. she was a little intense at first, probably because she was throwing a lot of information about the menu at us and very quickly. but man, she's good. we would literally take a last sip from our drinks and she would be right there with another one. it was like there were video-cameras at the table or something. food was good...i ordered the chicken dish that was stuffed with fontana cheese and proscuitto (forgot what the name was). it was really tasty. the mixed veggies that came with it were a little sad and shriveled though. definitely come check this place out especially if you're in the area. =)"}
{"text":"I was skeptical about Carrabba's at first thinking that their food would taste like Olive Garden (Mike don't kill me for saying that haha)    Ohhh man I was wrong, the food was great! One of the best chicken marsala I've ever had and the mash that comes along with it was perfect! The meatballs and lasagna were on point!  Mike is awesome! He is very welcoming and genuinely nice. I'm sure his staff appreciates him.  Great service and very good Italian food!"}
{"text":"Very good Italian food  Good place to celebrate with friends and family a birthday work function or whatever ! I recommend highly !!"}
{"text":"Great service but food quality and quantity has slowly gone down over the last year. Seems like they are really trying to cut back on costs which you can see. Used to be one of my favorites..."}
{"text":"Excellent service and food! Bree at the bar was awesome!  Try the pomegranate martini! Magnifico."}
{"text":"To be honest it was my first time at a Carraba's but it was pretty good.  I shared a (free) appetizer, some red wine and had the Veal Picatta.  The veal was good, the wine so-so and the appetizer passable.  Service was pretty good but rushed.  I really got the feeling that this place aims to feed you and get you out, rather tahn letting you enjoy a night out with friends.  I really objected to the waiter trying to charge me for the \"free\" appetizer (see their special) and making me ask 3 times and wait 30 minutes to get my bill corrected.  Lesson buddy - it cost you $10 in tip!  3 stars without the waiter's BS"}
{"text":"We love this place, good food and drinks. If you love something like the Pork Chop Marsala, you can count on it being good every time which I like a lot.  While it is a chain, they treat you very well. Staff is nice and knowledgeable. One server is a little over the top named Adam so we try to NOT get him but outside of that, we love the place. Another we ask not to have is Karine or Corine, nice enough but reeks of smoke or breath freshener and is very abrupt. Appetizers are great and pricing is reasonable.  Booths are large in some areas so a group of 6 can have a quaint dinner and hear each other. All in all great place."}
{"text":"Always very good, I would appreciate a little bigger portions, sausage and lentil soup a winner as is the Johnny. Wife likes the Rosa Maria."}
{"text":"Several notches above Olive Garden! Food and wine could not have been any better. Waiter was very personable and helpful! When he asked how the food was, I replied \"it's all so good, I didn't know I could feel this happy\" to which my boyfriend said \"oh thanks!\" All in all, a very fun, memorable night."}
{"text":"We go there primarily for the mussels ..... awesome!   The bread is absolutely the best.   The servers are charming and friendly."}
{"text":"Shout out to our server, Amanda.  We stopped in 30 mins prior to closing on Sunday night.   She was very welcoming & didn't rush us.  The meal was tasty but the service was outstanding.  Thanks Amanda!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice. The first time was about 9 years ago and I was about 6 months pregnant with my son. I ordered some type of pasta with shrimp. It was a large portion of naked pasta with maybe 6-8 shrimp and had NO FLAVOR AT ALL.  I sent it back and ordered the chicken Alfredo which had the same issue. I ended up sending that back and not eating at all. The customer service was great. The waitress was very polite, apologetic and offered free dessert. So the food was  not great but it had a nice atmosphere, it was clean and had great customer service.....  My second time here was last night. My family decided to have dinner here for my aunts 55th birthday. I remembered going there years ago and not liking the food. But I was a VERY picky eater when I was pregnant with my son so I figured if they've been around this long, my prior experience had to be due to my own issues and it was a clean and the costumer was awesome so I agree to go. The first thing I noticed was the prices were way higher then they where 9 years ago, doubled if not tripled. Service was pretty good. We had a group of about 20 people and had 2 servers. Some of our group was late (me being one) and they were very patient with us. A bit unorganized but still very polite and attentive to us. The food on the other hand, not so great and definitely not worth the price. I ordered the lobster ravioli which came with a choice of soup or salad. The soup was amazing the ravioli, not so much. I received a plate with about 8 quarter sized ravioli and a drizzle of of Alfredo sauce. So my first thought is wow this is the portion for $18.99. So I eat one and again  there is no flavor at all. Then I eat a second one and realize I didn't even taste any lobster in them, no meat chunks of lister flavor. My son ordered shrimp and scallop with mashed potatoes and hated it! And this is a kid who loves seafood how ever it's prepared. The only he ate was the mashed potatoes. I taste his food and scallops were over done but seasoned pretty good and the same for the shrimp. Around the table, my family is asking for more sauce for their pasta, asking if their food can be reheated and even if they could try something else. Our servers were still awesome considering we were a large group full of complaints. Never did they seem annoyed of frustrated. They took care of us in a timely manner and we didn't have to asked for anything more then once. But for a $70.00 bill for food that I didn't eat and a pitcher of sangria punch that just tasted like juice (I mean really there was no alcohol in it al all) I wont be going back. The only reason I'll give it two stars is because the customer service is really good but not $70 good."}
{"text":"Hubby and I have been frequent diners here since we first stepped foot about a month ago.  We even brought his parents in on their trip last week.  I am a Dine Rewards member, so I racked up the 3 visits rather quickly and was able to qualify for 2 50% off dinners already in this 1 month...which leads to say we've had 6 visits at least here in the past month.  Love their Italian wood-fired wings and we always get a meal to share with soup on the side for him and a salad for me....it's perfect.  Their sausage n lentil soup is yummy and they never have a problem with our customized dinner meal with angel hair pasta and alfredo sauce with either meatballs or parmesan crusted chicken. We've ordered the margherita pizza w/ sausage too and I loved it even though hubby was not a fan.  Safe to say we love this place!"}
{"text":"First time coming to Carrabas with the family, we were greeted at the door by a waiter and waitress (holding the doors open), we were seated immediately - given that it's Mother's Day and all!  Upon deciding our food, our waitress was really sweet and very helpful in explaining how Carrabas' menu was setup! After getting the Calamari and the Mozzarella sticks for our appetizers, we were blown away with how delicately the Calamari was seasoned and fried, and how the Mozzarella stickers were seasoned and in rectangles - different than your usual cylinder shaped sticks. Our food came hot and ready, I ordered the Seafood Cannelloni - hot and sooo delicious; worth the $13 I paid for it!  They also had a nifty give-away for Mother's Day - you received a $10 Gift Card (free after your meal) to use on your next visit because of the holiday! It was really sweet and nice of them to do this! My mother was really happy in the end and we will defiantly be coming back!!"}
{"text":"i haven't been to Carrabba's in years and i've missed it so much!  we went the other night and everything was fantastic!  there were a couple of hiccups early on, but nothing at all major.  the calamari was nice and crispy, but not overly-breaded.  i ordered the linguini pescatore (minus scallops) and while the sauce wasn't as spicy as i recalled, the shrimp was FANTASTIC!  normally i take the shrimp out of my dishes and donate them to the rest of the table but not this time.  succulent meaty delicious.   and the service was pretty fabulous, too!  i felt bad for our server because my uncle had her box EVERYTHING and the wee one kept trying to talk to her.  she handled everything graciously and never missed a beat.   we will definitely be back.  definitely the best italian restaurant at their price-point."}
{"text":"I love italian food and was pretty psyched to check out Carrabba's bc  my cousin raved about it..  Unfortunately, I am unable to rave. The food was decent but just that, no more, no less.  I've had better dishes at Olive Garden which isn't an insult in any way  but why deviate from OG's if I dont have too?? My food was warm, not hot and was very minimal on the sauce.  It was ok..."}
{"text":"Had a complaint about how the chicken was cooked. They could re cook it but it would take 40 minutes. Apparently you go to the back of the line if you need your food fixed. Or they could over cook the current chicken to burn off the seasoning that my wife didn't want. Well I wasn't going to wait 40 minutes. That is some BS. So we had them wash the current chicken. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Very good food and great service. Was nice atmosphere for a date night."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 1 star for one reason.. We did NOT get good food.. Picked it for Mother's Day because I wanted a step up from Olive Garden but I wish we would have just gone to Olive Garden.. The salad had so much white lettuce and all the soups had bones in it... This restaurant is too expensive to put up with that"}
{"text":"I just returned from a fabulous dinner at Carrabba's!  I had had a frustrating experience another night, where we arrived thinking we had a \"reservation\".*  I used the email form on their site, and described the situation.  A few days later, I got a call from the manager, who sounded genuinely concerned that a customer was upset, and invited me back for another visit.  As I mentioned to him, I believe that you can tell more about how a business handles a misstep than you could if you just had a good experience in the first place.  I can't imagine a better second impression than the one I had tonight, unless it included a new pair of fuzzy jammies and tuck-in service!  When we arrived, we were seated quickly tonight, and had excellent service throughout the evening.  Our drinks were rarely empty for a moment, and I observed the same manager stopping at tables throughout the evening (including ours) to make sure the patrons were enjoying their food and their evening.  This wasn't the abrupt \"everything ok?\" followed by a disappearing act  usually displayed by restaurant managers, but I saw him spending time and  actually adding to the dining experience.  Impressive!  I'll give a short description of each menu item I tasted (yes, I'm one of THOSE that has to try something from everyone that ordered something that looks good to me, AND isn't actively threatening to stab me with their fork), although NONE rated below yummy.  Bread-Crusty outside, soft inside, served with a fruity olive oil with herbs.    Mozzarella Marinara-Great!  Garlicky, Crunchy, and the sauce was chunky and very fresh-tasting.  NOT your standard dipping marinara (in a good way).  Caesar salad-Really enjoyed it.  Dressing was well-balanced, and I appreciated the salt and pepper grinders on the table, so I didn't end up with \"Salad Au Poivre\" as sometimes happens when the server has the piano leg-sized pepper grinder.  Seafood Chowder-My husband ordered this. Flavorful, not overly fishy-tasting.  I expected something creamier, and more like a clam chowder, but this was fairly pureed, and darker.  Seafood canneloni-This was a special, so may not always be available.  Chunks of lobster, shrimp, and scallop in a tomato cream sauce.  This was pretty good, although probably my least favorite of the night.  Spiedino Di Mare-Breaded scallops and shrimp in lemon butter sauce.  WH!  I am not usually a fan of scallops, because I have had them masquerade as either \"salty hockey puck\" or \"fish jello\".  This, however, was tender and tasty.  Chicken Bryan-Chicken breast topped with goat cheese and sun-dried tomatoes, in a lemon butter sauce.  WHO invented this?  I need to send them a gift basket or name a child after them or something.  This was SO good!  I guess you can get a filet prepared this way as well.  Filet-WOW!  I never would have guessed that I would find such a flavorful, tender, succulent steak in a place like this!  The manager said it was a well-kept secret, and I agree.  Did I mention succulent?  I may or may not need a bib to catch the drool while I write this.  Garlicky mashed potatoes-Perfect.  Not overly garlicky, chunky enough to prove they are real potatoes, and not too salty.  Sogno Di Cioccolata-MUCH better than the chokingly dense brownie/coagulated chocolate goo that you typically find.  This had various layers of chocolate brownie, mousse, cream, sauce, and had a nice balance between sweet and a little bitter.  Limoncello Bread Pudding-I am NOT typically a fan of bread pudding.  I have found it to be soggy, tasting mostly of alcohol, and generally order anything BUT this.  I'm so glad I gave this the chance, though!  It was the slightest bit caramelized, which gave it a great texture.  I loved the hint of lemon, and the vanilla bean ice cream served on top.  I know that this is a chain, but if the food and service are this good on future occasions, this restaurant will definitely remain a favorite.  Thanks, Mike!  *For future reference, their call ahead seating is NOT the same as a reservation, and merely shortens your wait time upon reaching the restaurant.  If there is one downside to this place, it is that it (and its parking lot) needs to be about 1/3 larger, to accommodate the number of people who want to dine here.  The tables are closer than I'd prefer, and there is not enough space to really wait comfortably.  Once you survive that gauntlet though, you're in for a good meal."}
{"text":"First time eating at Carrabbas. I like to eat pasta so I'm always looking for a really good Italian restaurant. First impression is that it's a nice place. I usually always get the chicken alfredo fettuccini. I thought it was just average. Service here is really good. Prices are about the same as other Italian restaurants."}
{"text":"Came here tonight with my family. The food was good, nothing exceptional. But the service... Was AMAZING! Stanley was our server and he did a phenomenal job. Our glasses were always full and he easily accommodated our very varied and particular food tastes with a smile! He was friendly, attentive and helpful! He deserves a raise and/or a promotion!"}
{"text":"Carrabba's is absolutely wonderful.  It's my favorite Italian restaurant in the area so far.  The place is well lit, the music is nice and the noise level is just right.  Every single server we have had has been absolutely amazing.  Polite, well groomed and always on top of everything, but not too pushy.  The food here is amazing and the three item deal they have on Mondays is the absolute best.  I always get the Lobster macaroni and my fiancé tries something new every time, everything just as good as the last.  The soups are wonderful and the desserts and absolutely delicious.  We've been here about four times now and will more than likely come back every month here after."}
{"text":"Never a bad meal at any Carrabba's I've ever been too.  That says a lot about a company that is pretty wide spread and I've tried at least 4 locations that I know of.  I'm partial to the chicken parm but there are several other selections that appeal to me as well.  They seem to staff there restaurant with knowledgeable wait staff at all their locations as well.  The bread is always fresh and hot to the table and they are very kind and kid friendly, offering to bring out the kids' meals first (always a good idea!)  Maybe not the most authentic Italian places to eat but always the most consistent food for the money.  Dinner sizes are ample and normally turn into lunch for the next day :)"}
{"text":"Once again a great experience at Carrabba's.  This time I tried the Chicken Marsala and was impressed.  It's a great low calorie option vs. most of the menu.  My girlfriend and I were here with the kids so there was 5 of us and while the service was prompt I still got the feelling we were getting in the way.  Hard to describe but our waiter wasn't exactly Mr. Personality.  I'll just scratch it up to maybe he had some bad news or something....it happens.  Carraba's is just a good and consistent choice when looking for a quick family dining option."}
{"text":"Love this place best Italian food, even if it is a chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Came in on a Sunday night and sat at the bar. The bartender was amazing! We told her a little bit about our wine choices and she came up with some great wine suggestions that were right on par. Additionally she told us about a wine paring dinner that they hold every 3rd Tuesday of the month, which sounds amazing. Food was delicious as usual... all in all a great evening!"}
{"text":"Food was great service was even better!!! The chicken trio was very very good!! Our server Robbie was a sweet heart and one day I plan on leaving him a $47000 tip"}
{"text":"Ate here while I was in town for a business trip. The waitress was very tentative and took my order immediately. Food was excellent as always. Good location - close to other restaurants and hotels in the area."}
{"text":"Excellent food and superb service.  It was our first time here, and we were celebrating purchasing our new home.  They brought us champagne, a congratulations card, and a $25 gift card.  Just so kind.  We then had exceptional food.  Chicken park, shrimp and scallop vodka pasta, and sausage campiniola. Soooo good! We will be back."}
{"text":"We have not been here for a few years and the last time it was quite good...things have definitely changed!  Overall the dining room was dirty, way too bright, just too many senior citizens (sorry)!  Then came the food...small portions, very salty, very prepackaged feeling, not good!  The server was overbearing and the overall value was poor."}
{"text":"It's been a couple of years since we've been here and decided it was time to go back.  I love the spice mixture and ground salt they have with olive oil for dipping the bread pieces.  It's very tasty and I end up eat too many pieces of bread.  Maybe that's why we come infrequently.  We each had a cup of soup for our start.  I had the Italian noodle soup and my wife had the lentil with sausage soup.  Both were good and different from soups we normally are offered.   For the main course, I chose the Chicken Bryan, a grilled chicken breast with goat cheese, sun dried tomatoes, and a lemon basin sauce.  My wife had Chicken Marsala.  Both were very good and I have some Chicken Marsala for lunch tomorrow. For our sides, I took the garlic mashed potatoes and my wife had asparagus.  Good accompaniments.  We chose to share a dessert--the chocolate dream.  It's a double fudge brownie with chocolate mousse, chocolate sauce, some Kahlua on the brownie, and whipped cream.  It was superb!  I'd go back just for that.    Service was excellent.  Our server was attentive, prompt, and very personable.  We will be returning sooner than the years that passed since our last visit."}
{"text":"My family and I have had several lunches at this location and we have never been sat in the amount of time quoted. Once we waited with 3 small children for over an hour after being told 30 min.   The food is ok but don't go when it's busy!"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful time with our friends. We shared a bottle wine, enjoyed the calamari, and demolished the food! I felt the price was very acceptable for the food. 4 Stars only because the service was slightly slow. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Carrabba's generally is my favorite place to eat that rarely disappoints but this visit had a lot of be desired.  First I arrived on a Saturday night 03/10 and was told there would be an hour wait while there were only a few guests waiting.  My guess not enough servers at 5:00 pm dinner time because there were plenty of tables.  To my surprise after waiting 15 minutes we were buzzed back for a table, but that's where it went down hill from there on the experience.  Our waitress took 15 minutes to acknowledge and come around to take our drink orders.  Our drinks finally arrived after another ten minutes and we were able to finally place our order.  The salads were quick to come out from the kitchen.  The waitress didn't come back out to check and see if we needed more bread or ask us how the salads were.  Having three small kids with me who needed drink refills and more bread to eat.  Our food finally arrived to the table after a 30 minute wait.  The manager came around to our table and said sorry for the wait there was a backup in the kitchen.  When the food arrived the chicken tenders that my son ordered was not.  The waitress entered in a chicken breast instead so we had to wait another 20 minutes to receive the correct food for him.  To finally top it off it took forever to get our bill to pay for our meal.  Overall I know it was a Saturday night and the restaurant was getting busier as time went on, but two hours to eat a meal is way to long if you are wanting to get people in and out for a restaurant.  Overall the issues were with the waitress and how the kitchen was being managed that night with orders.  I heard several other people complain about there food near me that night as well."}
{"text":"This Americanized Italian chain won't totally knock your socks off, but I do think it's a tick above the two stars everyone else gives. It was my father's choice as a congratulations dinner to him after a crazy heroic act that may or may not have been plastered all over the local news this past week.   I love that they have a variety of choices for small starter salads - Caesar, garden (creamy parm dressing) and Mediterranean. The salads were fresh, tasty, and not overly sodden with dressing. The standard bread comes out wrapped in paper, which I think is kind of cheesy, but it's hot, soft yet hearty, with a perfectly crunchy crust. My blackberry sangria was OK - I prefer the standard sangria I typically get - it was just a little too sweet.  My dad snarfed his chicken parm down like he hadn't eaten in weeks, and my SO appeared to enjoy his fettucini alfredo just fine and dandy. My white pizza had the makings of all things good - sun-dried tomatoes and goat cheese - but ended up being kind of greasy.  The desserts were DELISH. They have those cute shot-glass sized ones, which I think are perfect. The tiramisu had a nice boozy bite and a nice filling. My SO got this obscene double-decker chocolate cake-filled-with-mousse-and-whipped-cream extravaganza, topped with ice cream and caramel sauce to ensure his first heart attack will happen long before the age of 50. Holy shit, it was incredible! The chocolate flavors were rich and multifaceted, the cake dense and moist, and the whipped cream fresh. I mean DELICIOUS. Our server, who was super cool, slipped us one of the key lime shots for no reason. Totally nice.  My main issues are that the place has tables packed in TIGHT so you're practically positioned up the ass of a tableful of strangers who, I am willing to speculate, might not want to hear my drunken daddy wax poetic about the bloody events of the week. On top of that, there seemed to be more than a handful of screaming babies - not pleasant when they are across the room, much less eight feet from you. Also, the location blows. That whole intersection, and, frankly, part of town, is just a massive pain in the ass to navigate.  So is it a place you'll crave? Not necessarily, but it's predictable and reliable, which makes it onto the second tier of our regular restaurant rotations."}
{"text":"I dunno what to say, I like the food but not in love with it. I did enjoy their mussels. The service was also great. But I think I will stick to Brio near South Park for chain style Italian food."}
{"text":"First time here and it was delicious . I had the chicken parmesean and I was full I couldn't even finish it .  They give u good size portions and the service is great .  Waiting time , 20 min on a sat. Night"}
{"text":"I have to give it one star, because Yelp will not let me give it no stars.  This was worse than chef boyardee.  They burnt Veal Parm., badly, and still served it to my aunt."}
{"text":"WOW! May I just say \"great service\"?! Everything was fantastic. Our server, Alexis, was just as cute as she was efficient. My husband and I were joking that we wanted to adopt her LOL!! I almost always get the Margherita pizza and it's never soggy!! My husband orders the Chicken Marsala and we are never disappointed. We come at least one a month and we will be back soon. Make sure Alexis is working!!"}
{"text":"First time eating here and we were not disappointed. Food was delicious. Service was phenomenal. Jaime provided excellent service to our family of 6. We will be back for sure. Thanks Jaime!"}
{"text":"On May 16th my daughter and her new husband decided they wanted to celebrate with their wedding dinner being at Carrabas.   I called the morning of the wedding to ask if they could accommodate our party of 22. The opening manager explained that they don't take reservations but that he would pencil us in as a call ahead.  When we got there the tables were all set up with table linens and also a separate table for the cake/gifts .  They sat us promptly. I am sorry that I don't remember the names of our servers but they were EXCELLENT.. a man and a young woman. Our food was ordered and came out all at one time and it was delicious! They brought my daughter and her hubby a complimentary Bellini to toast too! At the end the server offered to take a group photo.  It was such a great experience! Thank you Carrabas for making a simple wedding day a VERY special occasion."}
{"text":"Very good food, service outstanding. The lasagna and the chicken parmigiana was just perfect. Then, what can zi say about Mama Mandola's Chicken Soup? Everything just perfect."}
{"text":"American Italian. Food ok. Bread and oil are ok, not great. We ordered the fish and pasta, food is ok. price is higher than quality. Waiting for the movie having a lunch is ok though."}
{"text":"This is our favorite Cheers bar. Bartenders and staff are always friendly, love the Johhny Rocco salad with grilled shrimp and scallops. Pasta of course, but the Mama Mandola Sicilian Chicken soup is our favorite. We visit almost once a week."}
{"text":"I've been going to carrabas since they first opened.  I have steady watched there quality go down down down .  I went to dinner there Feb 6th2018 and was so disappointed.  The quality had be diminishing in grads of meats, pre made sauces instead of homemade etc.  My food was big edible that night, even the waiter agreed the sauce on my pasta dish which was an Alfredo was like water, would even hold in the pasta.  Today March 13th I decided to give it another try. Once again it was terrible, the once fresh made bread was like a sponge, I had the chicken trio which is one of its more expensive meals which used to be made with three chicken breast made three different ways. Instead of chicken breast it was small round chicken patties like the frozen bagged ones you buy in bulk, evenly 1/4 \" patty all uniformly machine cut. The salad was not fresh the side pasta was not good either.  Everything seemed to be watered down.  This is a restaurant that isn't cheap and I used to frequent sometimes a couple times a week.  It's so sad !!! I had heard how downhill it had gotten, and noticed customer flow had lessened.  I had seen and heard other poor comments but out of loyalty kept giving the benefit of the doubt with extra chances.  I won't return now. This was the one on west charleston"}
{"text":"8-31-17 visited from Michigan and the food was great. My favorite is the chicken Parmesan. My family had shrimp Alfredo and shrimp spedino that they enjoyed!"}
{"text":"Haven't been here to dine for years because my family had a terrible experience here. Today my mom and I decided to give it another try. We ordered the stuffed mushrooms as a starter, and boy they were delicious!!!! My mom loved it! She stated that this is her new place for Italian food. She ordered the Fettuccine Weesie, which was scrumptious!! She had an amazing time.   I on the other had was let down with the linguine pescatore. The pasta was over cooked and didn't have any texture. It was mushy and bland. The mussels inside were also atrocious. I took one bite into a mussel and almost puked. I removed them all immediately from my plate. I ended up just eating my mom's pasta with her because it tasted so much better.   The service was good and the food was delicious for the most part. I think I may have had bad luck with the pasta dish that I ordered. I want to come back and have a better experience, especially because I love pasta."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying John S. Is an absolute gem at this location. You will be lucky to have him as your server.  I have had their linguine and creamy clam sauce and enjoyed it. Last night, we enjoyed their happy hour specials which included perfectly fried calamari, shrimp scampi and chicken wings. 1/2 price liquor as well. Hats off to this location for their great service and equally great food."}
{"text":"Ate here with friend, while in Arizona to judge horse show.  Noticed that many exhibitors were also here.  Smelled great--waiter very attentive-wait maybe 10 minutes, on a Friday night. Good bread and olive oil escarpeta-parmesan.  I had lemonade, she had iced tea-OK.  Had whitefish that was really good.  She had chicken w/proscutto & cheese-center was a bit raw--was taken away and re-cooked.  Chef came out and was polite, but dancing--- Had it not been for that, would be  4 stars--would go there again"}
{"text":"First time in this popular Italian restaurant. Welcoming decor, quiet surrounds, a strong, very positive and helpful staff - what's not to like? We stuffed ourselves on the Tuesday taste dishes, the many many mussels order, the minestrone and the veal Parmesan. An excellent meal! The check was a bit high for the area, but the overall experience was worth it."}
{"text":"Once was my favorite place to eat, but now the food is just sad, hardley even any on the plate and its also has become very overpriced. For 50-60 bucks I'll go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Hands down best lasagne I've ever had at a chain restuarant. I also tried the fried calamari it's was very tasty although a little uncooked but again very tasty. The bread has an old world look and taste I especially loved the olive oil and cheese butter. Yummy. The drinks are a little expensive but other than that go for this place!"}
{"text":"Consistently good I've been eating here for years it's the best Italian food in Charlotte"}
{"text":"Very good! Food is so good and good size portions. I had to take my entree home because of all the food. The calamari is absolutely delicious. The chicken soup is good also. The restaurant is very clean.   The only thing that doesn't make it for stars is the service. Our waiter was very slow, which I am not understanding why. The restaurant wasn't crowded at all. The table in front of us had a different server and she seemed good. This will not stop me from going back though."}
{"text":"the only reason I gave this place 2 stars is because the service is very slow. we got in fast for a Saturday lunch but every time we asked our waitress for anything she would come back 15 minutes later? the food is good and comes in large portions but really? 17 dollars for a chicken Parmesan? everything here is expensive. I order the lasagna and was very disappointed, it was COVERED in sauce with barely any cheese or meat. I most likely will not return here. the only thing that was good was dessert, which is wonderful."}
{"text":"I have been to Carrabba's at least 4 times and have taken food out two or three times. I normally will not eat at a chain. This place is just too good to be a chain. Good food, great service, clean, reasonably priced large portions - what not to like."}
{"text":"Christina did an awesome job of making sure everything was set at a good pace. We didn't have to worry about refills on drinks or bread, she was always there to make sure we had everything we needed. We love Carrabas for the food but I am glad to say that the service is always right up there."}
{"text":"Driving around and found this place for dinner. The place had that old Italian smell from all the cheese or something. The place was very large but yet it felt cozy and comfortable and relaxing.  Our server was very nice and attended to details. She bought us warm fresh bread with an herb olive oil for dipping the bread. Very tasty and we had a second helping of warm bread.  I ordered the linguini with white clam sauce. It was full of a lot of chopped claims and a number of whole claims. The sauce was excellent in flavor with garlic and parsley or chives. The linguini was prepared perfectly.  The portions were perfect. The meal included a Caesar salad. Very well prepared with fresh romain lettuce.  No room for desert. But a definite return if we are in this area again."}
{"text":"The food is consistently good here.   I almost always get the same thing which is the Chicken Bryan served with garlic mashed potatoes.   My husband usually gets the Fettucine Weesie which, according to him, has a great flavor of sauce with plenty of shrimp.   Bread with olive oil and spices are top notch.   I look forward to eating it.   The only strange thing I have run into on my last two visits involve a cocktail.   I have been ordering the Razzamatini Martini.  They bring it to your table in a shaker and pour the drink in front of you.   I don't like my whole drink poured in to my glass at one time.   I asked the server on two separate occasions to leave the shaker at the table and they would not.   They told me people steal them so they are not allowed to leave them with the guest.  Strange."}
{"text":"The server and our waitress were both fantastic, the drinks were never empty, and the food was good enough to take home and it to go box. Caitlin was an amazing waitress who tended to our every request and made the other guess just as pleasantly surprised. Thank you so much"}
{"text":"Awesome, so much better than Olive Garden.  The taste is new and refreshing,  a bit pricey compared to their competitors. I wish they were open for lunch more often!"}
{"text":"Went last week with sister visiting from CA. It was outstanding again! Carrabas slipped a bit couple yrs ago, but I see all new cooks and manager now. They pulled it back together and we enjoyed every bite. Will return again!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Fresh food from a scratch kitchen?? Um yes please.. the Linguine Positano is my favorite! Service is amazing and the managers are always around the restaurant talking to the guests. The cheesecake is delish! Totally recommend Carrabba's!"}
{"text":"My wife and I are snowbirds from Vancouver, Wa. and have been going to this restaurants for years and have always enjoyed the food and the service. Recently we were in for dinner and found the menu had been changed AGAIN and some of our preferred dinner selections had been eliminated. This was disappointing. We also noticed that the cocktail prices have become excessively high. I ordered a top shelf Bourbon Manhattan and was charged $ 16 for the drink. How can you charge sixteen dollars for a drink when my entree was only fifteen dollars. I have never paid that much for a Manhattan not even in fine dining restaurants in downtown Portland..Had I noticed this charge on my check before I left I would have had a discussion with the manager. So if your stopping here for dinner make sure you enjoy the food but watch out for the cocktail prices. We won't be going back there anytime soon. There are so many other restaurants in the area with more reasonable prices......Tom & Myrt"}
{"text":"Carrabba's has been one of our favorites for years and we were so happy to find one here in Las Vegas when we relocated here last year.  When we are in the mood for Italian, this is our go to place.  Excellent meals with lots of flavor."}
{"text":"I dined here yesterday for the first time in years and while the food and the service were both good, the manager wanted to charge me an extra $5.00 to get a small side of alfredo sauce to put on my broccoli. I thought that was outrageous, as did my waitress. So yeah, it's that kind of place now."}
{"text":"My mom really likes this place, so whenever we make dinner plans this i the first place she suggests and I usually let her when since she's paying.  I really, really, really hate the atmosphere. It's too dark and too loud as if it is a bar trying to pass itself off as a family restaurant during the day. During our last visit they sat is in the back (eastern part of the building) which wasn't as dark and gloomy only to have a birthday party of 25 people right behind start sitting down as our food comes. The most frustrating part is that the restaurant wasn't even fill and it looked like they knew the party had reservations.  I do have to admit the food is good here. Not great, but good. Their marinara sauce is very fresh, but a little too intense (garlic) for my taste when just served on plain noodles.  My wife really likes their lasagna, which doesn't suffer the wet-noodle plague (when you go to cut in and it becomes a soggy mess).  I ordered the chicken parm with a side of veggies on previous visits only to find it so-so. Last time I went back I decided to give it one last try, but as a sandwich and I was pleasantly surprised. It seems they cut the chicken thinner for the sandwiches so I had a nice crunchy sandwich.  I would eat here again, just not during a dinner rush and definitely not on a weekend night."}
{"text":"Estevan was our takeout server and he was absolutely wonderful from the phone call to bringing us our food. He was so sweet, friendly and worked hard to answer all my questions."}
{"text":"I've ate here 3-4 times and I'm never impressed.  Chicken Marsala is too salty.  Service is usually slow.  I ordered the caprese/burrata appetizer at my last visit and it was covered in onions *gross*"}
{"text":"Five stars for food and 5 stars for our server Garrett. He was very attentive and constantly making sure we were okay which is impressive for a busy Saturday night. The calamari is to die for as well as the lobster ravioli! We will definitely be dining here again."}
{"text":"Came for dinner tonight and what a pleasant experience we had. Cody was our server and his service and professionalism was outstanding. I ordered the fettuccine weesy and my boyfriend got the lobster ravioli, both of which were delicious. My only complaint is our drink being mostly filled with ice, but honestly with how good the food is and how great our service was that is the least of our concerns. I will definitely be returning to this specific location!!"}
{"text":"Went to Carrabba's last week for dinner (had not gone there in years, mostly due to newer management and inferior food).  I ordered lasagne and could barely cut through it with the fork.  It was tasteless and gummy.  My daughter ordered Fettuccine Carrabba with chicken sans mushrooms and peas.  She stated that the chicken was rubbery.  We have given Carrabba's many chances over the years and unfortunately, continue to be disappointed.  Back in the day, Carrabba's was a treat for us, not the case anymore."}
{"text":"We dine here almost every week. Food is always delicious. Service is friendly and FAST. Not sure the exact happy hour times but I think the apps are half off. I recommend the Fettuccine Carraba and calamari."}
{"text":"I like this place.  The décor is nice, the staff is friendly and the menu has a great offering.  I have tried numerous items on the menu from pastas to the fantastic pork chop marsala (which you must try) and have never been disappointed.  In addition, the FREE bread and the olive oil spice mix you dip it in is the best bread offering of all the chain restaurants I have been in.  That mix of spices is tasty!  One other thing you must try if you like soups is the lentil with sausage soup.  It is fantastic.  Oh, I don't know if they still do this for the kids, but they used to hand out dough for the kids to mold and shape (and I think bake for them) which was fun for our kids.  That was kind of a neat twist to keep the kids entertained.  It's a little farther from the house than other popular chain Italian places, but it's the best of the chain restaurants in my opinion."}
{"text":"We went here for a friends birthday only because Outback wasnt open yet. I wish we'd have stayed.  The bartender was attentive and nice. The food was great, and the prices were surprisingly reasonable."}
{"text":"Great service, and the food was excellent, I had pasta with shrimp and meat sauce and really enjoyed it.  Everyone was friendly, and even more important, competent."}
{"text":"Great place to eat and come and relax great food the best Italian food and great customer services they cater to every person great hospitality"}
{"text":"Ok so we ordered carry out on Valentines Day, I expect it to be busy. But to wait fir a half hour for an incorrect and inadequate meal is annoying. Attached are 2 pictures, 1 is supposed to be Spaghetti Bolognese, looks like Spaghetti and meatballs with no sauce right? The other is supposed to be Fettuccini With Alfredo sauce, but there was maybe 2 tablespoons of sauce in the dish. Disappointed doesn't cover it. Thanks for a disappointing Valentines Day dinner chefs and staff of Carrabba's"}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed Carrabba's.  Nothing extravagant but good food, good service.  It's kind of my go to place if I am in the mood for pasta."}
{"text":"Service is always great, our waters are always full along with the bread.  Only once did I have overcooked Salmon but they promptly took it away and made me another one, it was wonderful.  This is my go to place after work when I don't want to cook! Great happy hour deals in bar area from 3-6:30 daily Our favorite place!"}
{"text":"FANTASTIC FOOD!  Prices can be a bit high for a chain restaurant but you are at least assured delicious, consistent food a nice atmosphere and great service.  This is the place to go when you want to be sure your meal will be good.  Menu is limited though.  No other complaints!"}
{"text":"This is an excellent place to eat. Great service, food, and atmosphere. I've never had one bad experience here and I go at least once a wk. It's wonderful and the chicken bryan pizza is the best pizza in the universe! :-)"}
{"text":"This was my first time here trying this chain restaurant.   The food was very good and the service was excellent.  They opened at 12noon on Sunday whereas Yelp says 11am.  A waiter apologized to me once at 11:30am and again once I came back for lunch.  The complimentary bread was fresh and hot and came with a side of ground spices to mix with EVOO and a side of balsamic vinegar.  My portion was very filling.  They even had whole wheat spaghetti which is rare to find in a restaurant.  Upscale decor and ambiance...but not stuffy.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Ok place to grab a good meal.  The place was packed on a Monday night with a short wait.  The salad was ok and the bread, oil, and spices were great.  My meal didn't come out so good.  I ordered the Penne Franco with whole wheat pasta.  The menu said any pasta can be whole wheat...such a deal!!  I was excited.  When my meal came out it was regular pasta.  I asked about it and they said they could remake it, make it to go, or ask to speak to a manager.  I spoke to the manager and she agreed to comp the meal.  I can't believe you can't get what you order here.  She said they only have spaghetti in whole wheat...I don't care!  What a mess."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in forever but we will be coming back ALOT! An amazing manager here named Lindsey came and asked My 4 year old son If he wanted to go pick his own dessert so she took him back to the kitchen and let him pick then he asked if he could get some dessert for mommy and nana so not only did she bring back ice cream for Him but also for us! What an AMAZING experience!"}
{"text":"2/25/2018 WORST SERVICE EVER!!!! We arrived at 6:30p and asked for a table, not a booth. We were told the wait was 15-20min. Ok. We noticed the Pizza/Dessert Bar was open and went there. We sat down and waited for a server to show up. They NEVER DID!!! After 15min we got a text that the table was ready. So we went to the table. We sat there another 10min before our waitress (who had been flitting between the table on both sides of us) finally decides to stop and take our drink order. We completed our entire order then as we had plenty of time to know our order. We ordered unsweet tea and were told they were brewing it, I know it takes time, but 20 min? and at least give me a glass of water if your are going to bring bread!!! We had to get up and go to the PIZZA/Dessert Bar to get creamy parmesan for bread we asked for. We had to get our own sweetener from the drink station area. Now the tables around us that sat after us got their appetizer before us, salad before us, food before us and were gone before we had a check! As 4 adults we ordered 2 meals to split between the couples. The other tables had 6 people with 6 different meals and still got theirs before us. Worst service ever we have had at this location. I swear we were treated not nice because I complained to the manager about the wait at the Pizza/Dessert Bar with no service. We come here at least once a month if not more and I felt like this was the worst service that was targeted to our table that I have ever experience. It took us 2 hours to complete out meal!!! While we saw other tables come and go!!!  I feel the server quality has gone down.  I tried to find the Manager on my exit and she was no where to be found.  We ordered Chicken Parmesan and Lasagna. Not anything crazy and it took forever to get cold food!  Not a happy customer!!!"}
{"text":"Parents, aunt and cousin came in here this past Sunday. The food was amazing, service was good \"spotty here and there\" but overall was good. My cousin's is a picky eater and hates spicy food, Hayes garlic and he loved the chicken soup the restaurant was serving that day, it was a bit spicy but he said he could handle it.   I ordered the johnny Rocco salad with double shrimp and opted out of the scallop, and it was tasty, very little shrimp though. Mom had the chicken spaghetti con pesto and she loved it, I took the leftovers to lunch the next day and it still tasted amazing.   Dad ordered the short rib pappardelle and he also loved it, and I took the leftovers to lunch 2 days later and it was also still delicious. Will definitely come back and try other things."}
{"text":"Service was not very good took to long to get our meals about 45 minutes and the dessert we ordered never came just promises that it would, we finally got tired of waiting after an additional 45 minutes of promises, we will not be going back."}
{"text":"Don't let my three stars fool you into thinking I don't think much of Carrabba's, because I do. I really enjoy it here, I almost always have terrific service, the food is consistently good, I love the overall atmosphere of the place, and sitting at the pasta bar to watch them cook everyones food is mighty fun, it's just that the prices have gotten out of control. I've been coming to this location for quite a few years now and have watched the prices climb higher and higher to the point that I rarely visit anymore... I still enjoy it when I do, but there are way too many fantastic places nowadays where I get a lot more bang for my buck. I am not a huge chain eating kind of guy but this Carrabba's has a special little place in my heart... I'll be back now and again, but if they don't calm it down a bit they'll end up losing me."}
{"text":"I think as with most chains... They get old. And also the quality tends to go down  I was really not happy with the service... With management... Or the overseas and food.  It was just not the same level of quality as I have eaten at this chain in other states  And the manager just seem to not care when I pointed out some obvious things about the quality of food and the poorly seasoning or I should say extremely over-seasoned... food so salty I could barely eat it...  But actually I did not eat it. And I called the manager over  Also noticed that when it's time to close... They forget about you and push you out the door  So overall not a great experience"}
{"text":"This is my second visits to Carrabbas.  No reason I am mainly giving them three stars is because management seem to be uninterested and complacent about my comments in regards to the over-seasoned  and food.  1) Ordered the crab-cakes as the appetizer. The plate was very unappealing and not presented well.  The crabcakes themselves had a good taste of crab. However they were very overseas and far too much salt and pepper. You could only eat half of one before it left an unpleasant taste in your mouth. How to keep drinking water  2) Ordered The lentil soup with the meal. The soup had a great flavor with the Italian sausage. However they did not let the sausage and other ingredients flavor the soup. They added copious amounts of seasoning. Probably MSG. And the soup after 4-5 bites began to burn the mouth.  Needless to say we were unable to finish the soup as the seasoning overpowered the pallet.  3) on a positive note. That 9 ounce sirloin was cooked very well. Had great flavor and was quite pleasing to eat.  4) The sautéed spinach with garlic was also cook very well. Not over seasoned... just the right amount of oil and the perfect amount of fresh garlic.  5) also ordered the tilapia... The hazelnut crust is great. And the fish was well cooked. The big problem was that because of the hazelnut crossed the fish was very dry. The sauce was not enough and was heavily acidic with the lemon. While the fish itself was not over season. The lemon sauce was heavily over seasoned and not very tasty.  What was really disappointing to me is that the manager came by and after telling her about the over seasoning problems she said that she would talk to her cooks but in the end it was not genuine. She continued about the restaurant and spoke to no one in the kitchen.   The manager also did not offer to re-cook any of our food and season it appropriately.  All in all it was a hit or miss. About 50% of our food was good and the other 50% was highly overseas and and really not edible."}
{"text":"The kitchen disappoints.  Not very good. They try but the food was not appetizing or cooked correctly."}
{"text":"What's with Carraba's promotion? Pay for $50.00 \"gift\" card and receive $50.00 bonus, @ $10.00 per visit per consecutive months. The food and service is usually very good, and they always appear to have a house full. In my judgment, this is a scam."}
{"text":"This particular Carrabba's is in a great location and has very friendly staff.  The interior is beautiful and has a good Italian restaurant vibe.  We sat outside and enjoyed a mild Vegas night.  We showed up about an hour before they closed but felt very welcome.  It was a Monday night and they had a very good deal for a 3 course meal for $12-$16 that includes an app, entre and soup or desert.  We had a ton of good food and drinks for under $40!    During the dinner the obvious debate ensued of Carrabba's Versus Olive Garden.  I prefer the atmosphere of Carrabba's because it feels a bit more classy and updated.  My girlfriend is more \"stuck in her ways\" with OG.  The food is a bit of a toss up and needs to be broken down to the two things that matter in an Italian Restaurant.  Bread: Carrabba's has a warm loaf of hard-crust with soft-inside bread sliced and fresh from the oven, with olive oil and herbs to dip.  The breadsticks at Olive Garden are world famous, but I tire of them.  My gf prefers the OG breadsticks but I pointed out to her that night that she sucked down the Carrabba bread like Kobyashi on the Fourth of July.  Sauce: The last few times at OG I felt like the sauce was more underwhelming than I remembered.  Like it was more watered down and bland.  Carrabba's sauce seems a little thicker and sweeter, a little less mass produced and a little more home-made than OG.  I asked the waiters at both OG and Carrabba's if the pasta is made fresh in store.  OG replied no, but Carrabba's does make two of it's pasta's fresh in-store.  Either place is okay in my book.  But I think I lean towards Carrabba's"}
{"text":"Amazing!!!! Let me start by saying the food is extremely good. I am a steak guy, you need to try the filet with their spicy Sicilian butter.    Thank you! to Lindsey and Matt their customer service was one of the best I've ever had. I definitely recommend stopping by and having a meal and maybe a few drinks, you won't regret it!  Thank you to Carrabba's and their whole team.  Sincerely Angel Colon"}
{"text":"Today, Sunday, June 17 was by far my worst restaurant experience in a long time. This restaurant used to be my go to Italian food. Arrived and was told a 25 to 35 minute wait- no problem had drinks at the bar. After we were seated we were informed by our stressed out waitress that approximately 1/3 of the menu items were no longer available for tonight because of kitchen issues. And that our wait time for entrées would be 35 to 45 minutes wait time. After two hours and 10 minutes our food arrived and was by far the worst Italian food I've had in quite a while. Cold pasta, burnt chicken over cooked steaks. Will not return and can no longer recommend this restaurant. Suggestions to management -Inform the gas at check-in and that there is issues and wait time for food would be greatly extended. By informing your gas of issues I guess us the option of leaving   On Monday, June 18, the new manager/owner, Nick Z called to apologize for the poor experience. He reassured me that they were working on restoring service and the food quality in the near future. Suggested he will have things back to normal six months and to return"}
{"text":"Been here a couple times- the bread with dipping oil is good enough. The Mezzaluna ravioli is super yummy! Both times the service was sooo slow which usually drives me up a wall but it was driving my mom up a wall so I actually found it entertaining.  Good enough to return for sure."}
{"text":"Great spot for a date night!  We always get seated right a way and the staff is super helpful and friendly.  They are professionals here.  I usually get something with seafood and pasta and have never been disappointed.  The wait times are never long when I have gone, usually on the weekends in the evenings.  Good Italian food with very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Maybe prices alone shouldn't be a reviewers biggest consideration, but long-term, long-time customers KNOW how we got here, how a dish that used to be $X.00 is now $Y.00.  Carrabba's has always had good flavor, good taste and began, really, as a viable chain alternative to Olive Garden.  But the value just isn't there anymore.  Used to be, not now.  I imagine every Carrabba CEO has hired in the last 10 years has raised prices...and not to just to keep up with groceries but to fast-pace improve the bottom line. Improve this, Mr. Pace: I won't be back.  Case in point: Fettuccine Wesie.  Costs?  (How long's has this item been on the menu?  Longer than you've been with Carrabba, President & Cr-Info???-Pacey-boy, I'd bet.  Want that bet?)  Fettuccine Wesie starts out as a basic Fettuccine Alfredo, so, maybe, 10 oz pasta.  That's not expensive...$1?    Served with \"sautéed shrimp\", but my whole order only had three ship.  Three. Wait. A whole abondanza !!! 3 (!) (Cost: $3.00, tops?);  Add scallions+basil+garlic and mushrooms white + wine lemon butter sauce. $1.00?).   Good dish for a long time. Just that now, much smaller portion (after a while, 15 years ago, it all began: they started faking it by giving extra Alfredo, like a base-extender, cutting the shrimp from 7 to 5, even less mushrooms...  If you add that up, that's a total of $5.00, and I thought it generous.  No, I didn't list \"mushrooms\", but there's room here.  $5 is plenty.  Divide the sale price of $18.45 by $5 in cost: 27.1% food cost.  That's reasonable, most restaurants, in reality, shoot for 30 and under.  The problem is, I ate this dish in a much larger version...look: it's just not worth it.    But let's say I'm wrong. Let's say the cost of those ingredients isn't $5 dollars but was $4.00. The 3 shrimp is $2, TOPS. That now brings the food cost under 21. 21.6 to be precise. That's promotable number, baby.  And why there's no value left for the customer.   So now, it's still a good dish, FLAVOR-WISE,  for $13.95 or $14.95, but now it's all stripped down...now it's $18.45 and it's just not worth it. Not even close.   Service?  What service?  Self-entitled little d-bags.  Somebody better check Johnny Carrabba's no-compete; might be time to get back in the business.  They are ruining your namesake."}
{"text":"The service was good. The restaurant was clean and the atmosphere was appealing. However, I wasn't at all impressed by the food. Sadly, I've had better Italian dishes from pizza shops in the area."}
{"text":"Ate here Saturday evening I didn't make reservations so they sat us in the bar area we froze our ass off.  There is no heat in the bar area.  I don't think we're coming back to Carrabba's to eat till it warms up in the spring."}
{"text":"This is a great place.  I'm not usually a big fan of chains but this is my favorite Italian restaurant in Surprise.  We've had several items off the menu now and almost all have been great.  There is 1 exception.  The 20 Clove Chicken.  The waitress warned us that it was \"highly\" seasoned with salt and pepper.  My friend decided to order it anyway since she tends to like salty things.   It was HORRIBLE and we ended up throwing half of it away.  As good as most food is at Carrabbas, they should be embarrassed by this one."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this location for a very long time. I don't like chain restaurants all that well but these guys have it down.   Food: daily app specials is usually what I start with. They always have a bruschetta of the day or the mussels are amazing! They serve them in a garlic butter that doubles as bread dip if you don't like the 9 herbs they hand cut daily w/ EVOO  Salad: all of their dressing are made from scratch. The house dressing is creamy Parmesan and it is amazing!   Soup: also, made from scratch daily. The cicilian chicken soup is loaded with black pepper and the sausage and lentil is just a little spicy with added fennel.   Main dish: I went with the chicken trio off of the wood fired grill because it had all three of their signature chicken dishes on one plate. Bryan, Marsala, and Pollo Rosa Maria. Side of garlic Mashed potatoes because they are the best Mashed money can buy.   Sogna di chocolata(probably butchered that) is layered with chocolate brownie, chocolate mousse and whipped creamed as a closer... Don't miss out!  Service: shout out to Kevin & Mike at the bar who have been there forever taking top notch care of every single guest. Try the red or white sangria they also make that there from scratch. This place is overall amazing every time. I get something different every time and it never disappoints. I know they're operated by Outback Steak House and maybe this is why they are so consistent. Carrabba's gets my vote as best chain."}
{"text":"There was a good atmosphere, I'll give them that and the mozzarella. But the MARGARITA PIZZA was actual shit. I believe that they used cardboard 1/2 a cup of oil, tomato, and mozzarella, put it in the pizza oven for two seconds cut it, like my two year old sister trying her best to make a intricate paper snowflake and threw it on a plate and called it good. Our server was a little on the creepy side. While me and my wife were talking he would loom near us and he made some comments that made my wife uncomfortable. Right when we sat down we knew we had made a mistake. I don't know who thinks that this place is the best. Lake, have you guys tried Olive Garden? They give me the shits but their food is 80x better. And on top of that we had problems with parking. If you are still considering going I would prescribe two anti diarrheal and some Pepto-Bismol, have fun and may the odds be ever in your favor."}
{"text":"We did curb side take out.  The food was hot. ..I had chicken Bryan. .hubby had seafood. . Came with house salad.. Note to carrabas. . Ditch the iceberg lettuce... but other than that. .. great experience. .. will visit again for sure!!! Bread. With olive oil dip comes with. . Even on takeout."}
{"text":"Great food had the Tag Pic Pac with shrimp. Very good and reminds me of what real Italian pasta is. Light sauce with lots of flavor."}
{"text":"Dined here on 4/2/17. Service was fast despite the crowd. Kassidi was our waitress, and did an amazing job! She was informative and helpful with our menu related questions, and we never had an empty drink! Our food was served promptly, and the orders were accurate. Generous portions, great food! Kassidi went above and beyond with her service and friendliness! Strongly recommend this location!"}
{"text":"It was my first time here and it was a pleasant experience. Now I'm not sure if we beat the dinner rush or they have really fast service here! We got seated without a long wait. It was almost instant. The menu had some pretty tasty sounding dishes so it was kind of hard to pick. There was also a Monday special where I can get a 3-course meal for only 12.99!  But I just settled for the Baked Ravioli Parmesan.   The service was very friendly and fast. It was almost surprising that we got our salad and a few minutes later we got our entree.   This was my first time here and I enjoyed it very well! I'm sure I'll be back again and try their Chicken Bryan! I heard good things about that and in excited to try that next time."}
{"text":"We came here to celebrate a family birthday at 5pm and it was good to beat the dinner rush. I'd been here once before and wanted to come back and try some different menu items.  I enjoyed their starter of bread and olive oil mixed with herbs, bread is always a great way to begin a meal. I decided to order a pizza and I created my own by adding kalamata olives, which I love. The pizza was fine, nothing spectacular but it filled me up. My family ordered minestrone and the spicy chicken soups, which wasn't spicy. We got a variety of entrees and I liked the Tuscan grilled chicken, it had great flavor to it. For dessert, I chose the apple crostada and I liked it, it had a good balance of pastry, fruit and ice cream.     The service was friendly and the atmosphere was welcoming to families and all alike. Italian food isn't my favorite type of food, but I do think this restaurant offers some great dish options."}
{"text":"Ate dinner on Christmas Eve with another couple.  This was not our first dining experience here, but by far the most disappointing.  Four of the five dinners were not up to our expectations from our previous experiences.  Specifically, the baked ravioli was so hard and crusty that it was difficult to cut, the noodles in the lasagne were so overlooked they were mushy and the Parmesan dressing on the salads and dipping oil was tasteless.  The service was exceptional, with bread and dipping oil, cocktails and meals served in a timely fashion.  The bill, however, was inaccurate in that the first order of five cocktails was ordered during happy hour and the second round was not but the bill of the party of two had all cocktails at happy hour prices and the party of three had one drink at happy hour price and the others at full price.   Very disappointing Christmas Eve dinner for our group.  We will not eat at this location again."}
{"text":"Don't order the cavatappi amatriciana it came with only noodles and they were dried out.  I asked for sauce and they said that was the way it came that it is absorbed.  They did bring out more sauce which was nice but I look at the photo in the picture as there is sauce all over it.  The mussels were either out of season they usually are so wonderful but they were super super small never seen mussels so small but the butter sauce was still wonderful to dip the bread in."}
{"text":"Service was sooooo terrible. Waitress was nice but we had already gotten and finished our appetizer before she ever came back to take our order. I had to ask the Manager to take it.  The food took forever, but that wasn't her fault.  I asked for butter, never got it, I asked for the check she then went and took another table's order, went and got food, etc.... I finally went and found her and handed her my card.    The manager was so busy apologizing to everyone that he was no help.   Probably lost my business as there are so many other places to eat and much cheaper. Food was so expensive. I had probably what was about a cup of nooodles, 4 shrimp and 3 scallops for $22.  We had 1 appetizer, 2 entrees and 1 extra side salad. $65.  CRAZY! !"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at a Carrabba's and it's not that I had high hopes, but this restaurant was horrendous and completely killed my desire to ever eat at a Carrabba's again. It was one of the most uncomfortable situations I have ever experienced at a restaurant. Happy hour was going on and me and my boyfriend were eyeing some blackberry lemonade, seems innocent right? I ordered one, thinking it was just lemonade with blackberry syrup in it. The waiter never asked for my ID nor mentioned anything of this blackberry lemonade being alcoholic. I received the drink and noticed it was in a fancy glass, not one that I could hurriedly drink due to being parched. My boyfriend then asked a waiter passing by if the drink was alcoholic and she had no idea. A couple of minutes pass, and then BAM! The bartender comes out of nowhere demanding to see my ID to see if I was older than 21, which luckily I was, but who knows what would have happened if I wasn't. She then walks off as if it's okay to bombard a table for something that they had no idea about nor did anything wrong. Our waiter then shows up out of  nowhere, just says my mistake, doesn't offer me anything else to drink or even if I want to keep the alcoholic drink. I refused to drink it and got an ice tea instead. And for the rest of my meal I was treated like an outcast. My server refused to look me in the eye and no longer directed questions towards me or cared to see if I was doing okay. ONE OF THE MOST UNCOMFORTABLE AND AWKWARD SITUATIONS I HAVE EVER HAD AT A RESTAURANT. It was like I was in time out until I left the restaurant and that I was the criminal. I am NEVER going back to Carrabba's, and besides, Olive Garden's food is way better than the tasteless crap they serve here. Needless to say we still left 20% because I use to work as a server, but I did not leave a tip based on service or performance it was out of sheer generosity."}
{"text":"I had the privilege of bring invited to attend Carrabba's attempt at the world's largest wine dinner/pairing event last night (March 21st, 2017) that was held simultaneously at 244 locations across the nation. They served up a four-course meal with wines paired with each.  The location that I attended was packed, leaving room for error when it comes to getting the food out for that many people, yet they were able to deliver despite this challenge.  The atmosphere of the restaurant and the quality of service provided by the staff were extraordinary variables in the experience as they catered to the smallest needs for every guest. Their personalities and professionalism was perfect, which added to the experience so well.  The menu itself was filled with a selection of great course and you even had the opportunity to customize your entree.  They started everyone off with a salad mixed (Insalata Fiorucci) with roasted red bell peppers, artichoke hearts, romano cheese, eggplant and topped it with a warm patty-shaped portion of goat cheese, crusted with hazelnut. Everything combined well together, allowing you to truly enjoy the salad. Originally, I thought a warm portion of cheese atop of a cold salad may be a little clashing, but surprisingly it blended right in. The hazelnut crust however took this slightly away for me (it should be noted, that I am not really a fan of including any form of nuts on other foods, which creates a biased opinion for this).  The salad was paired with a Chloe Pinot Grigio that combined quite well together. It had a little bite to it with a cooling flavor of fruits.  The second course (Calabrian Cavatappi) featured a cavatappi pasta that was both favorable and had a slight spicy kick to it that really allowed it to pop. The portion wasn't too much, allowing room for the upcoming courses, while still providing plenty to satisfy your stomach and tastebuds with.  This was paired with a Pieropan Soave. Another white wine with a fruity profile but a lighter body to it than the Pinot Grigio. It also paired quite well with the pasta.  The third course was a selection of either veal marsala or tuscan-grilled sirloin. As a steak lover myself, I chose to go with the sirloin. It was topped with mushrooms and their Lombardo Marsala wine sauce with grilled asparagus sat to the side. Not a big fan of mushrooms myself, I scooted by then quite a bit. However, I found myself to quite enjoy the sirloin. It was thick and plentiful, as well as, tender and flavorful. In order to cater to such a large crowd of people, every steak was cooked to medium, although it came out slightly more towards medium rare, which was perfect. I am a firm believer that anyone who prefers a steak anywhere close to well or well done, should order from the kids menu. A steak truly shines when it is pink in the middle, and shine it did.  It was paired with a Sequoia Grove cab. I was worried slightly about this as it takes a lot at times for me to enjoy a cab, as I find most of them to be a little too dry for my tastes. This leads me to rely on certain merlots or sangiovese wines as an alternative when it comes to pairing. However, this one paired very well to the steak and I even found myself craving more. The juggling of flavors between the meat and wine were fantastic. The fact that my palate was softened up slightly by the previous two lighter wines may have also had an effect.  Speaking of fantastic, the final course was dessert (Sogno Di Cioccolata). This featured a brownie with chocolate mousse, whipped cream, chocolate flakes and sauce. The dessert by itself was absolutely fantastic. The flavor was perfect for ending the dinner with you couldn't leave without finishing the final bite.  The paired wine was a Joel Gott Zinfandel. This was the only wine that didn't seem to pair well with its course. The wine itself was good, but it clashed when combined with the course, which seems to have been caused either by the mousse or the cream (we leaned more towards the mousse). If you scraped everything from atop and went for just the bare brownie, it then paired nicely with the wine.  All-in-all, it proved to be a great experience. The food was terrific, the wine was great and the service was to brag about. If the service and experience was equal across the 244 restaurant locations, I would say that Carrabba's has succeeded at creating a wonderful wine dinner event worthy of calling the world's largest.  If you find yourself interested in attending one of these dinners, Carrabba's has another pairing planned next month."}
{"text":"We've never had a bad meal here and it's always fun.  Food was better on opening but it's still good.  The place could use professional or interested management to solve long weight time long food times and improve food quality but those improvement wold make it better,"}
{"text":"Had a great time with the sibling and nieces, we went to Carrabbas today for a post monkey Joe's food fest and were not disappointed.  The waiter was great, very attentive and real engaging with the kids.  I also had a good deal of bread, so carb loaders hit this place first on your rampage.  Everything is cooked fresh... I know this because they have no microwaves according to the kitchen, as we asked to nuke some milk for one of the kids and they had to do it on the stove.  By far a great restaurant to go to, chain or not!  For my actual meal, I ate something I can't pronounce, but it was great!  Noodles, Tomato, Garlic and some other stuff, it was yummy yum yum!  The sis had lasagna and was Delicious according to her and My 2 yr old niece enjoyed her raviolis!  She also carb loaded as well!  So... nap time for us :)"}
{"text":"I will start by writing that the quality of the food is excellent, well it was.  They really skimp on the salad dressing.  It was better than other places and up until tonight we loved it. Carabas sends a clear message about which patrons they value most, the bar patrons.  Unfortunately for us we have nobody to watch our youngest so she goes everywhere with us.  Carabas has only one table in the bar area where a highchair can be used and it was taken. I understand the safety issue involved in this limitation of not using high chairs in the bar area,  that isn't my issue.  My issue is that only bar patrons can take advantage of the half price appetizers. Long time customer status doesnt matter to this manager that we spoke with and neither does the fact that even though we didn't sit in the bar,  both adults did order an alcoholic beverage (which is the money maker)   So,  for those people who don't have a sitter or who prefer to not sit in a bar,  you pay full price...  because you sit on the other side of the dividing half-wall.   The bigger disappointment is that when we expressed our concerns to the manager,  he tried to argue the reasoning for not having children in the bar.  Completely ignoring my concerns about why a few square feet in seating location meant we couldn't take advantage of the better price.  Once he addressed it,  it was still no.  No offer to grant this one time the lower price.  We received better customer service and problem resolution at AppleBees. Our visit was on Tuesday the 14th of April at about 5:00 at the 0043 location. Our waitress Brittany on the other hand was excellent and apologized for a circumstance she had no control of."}
{"text":"Sundown got our cocktail yummy sangria sever was very pleasant appetizers came on fast and dinner was very good"}
{"text":"So... Aside from our sweetheart waiter, this was not good. The food had no flavor. We got the Lobster Ravioli,  Seafood Pescadora , and the Fettuccini Carabba... I put this on the same level as Olive Garden but a little more expensive. It's Thursday night... and kinda empty. That says something, unfortunately."}
{"text":"My wife is half way through a  MDS chemo treatment schedule and I wanted to take her out for a special dinner.I picked Carrabba's because it is less than a mile from our house and we have had some good meals there. I ordered her a glass of the new Summer Sangria and suggested she try the soup of the day and the Prosciutto-Wrapped shrimp with fresh spinach. I order a salad and the Sirloin Skewers with a house salad and asparagus. She didn't care for oil-spices to go with the bread so they brought her butter. I order a Happy Hour Miller Lite. Her soup was delicious and we shared my salad that was cold, fresh and perfect. Our entrees came and we were blown away with the shrimp. The grilled lemon juice on the spinach with the prosciutto-wrapped shrimp & orzo was absolutely perfect. My sirloin-onion-tomato skewers were very good but not as good as her shrimp. The service was spot on. This is the type of meal and restaurant you can't wait to tell your friends about. Best we have had since we moved to Mesa in 2011. I can't wait to take our winter visitors to Carrabba's. Great job guys, we will be back!"}
{"text":"I rate things for what they are. The guy who said if you give this place 5 stars you don't know Italian?, I AM ITALIAN and from BROOKLYN. I agree this is NOT authentic Italiano, but they don't claim to be. I love Carrabba's for what it is - A great chain restaurant, it's that simple! This place has outstanding service, great food, and it's very kid friendly. There is a reason why this place has a wait every night. It's good all the way around, and it's not exactly for the cheap prices either!"}
{"text":"Being from houston, I have been to both originals.  This location compares. As a bonus, there is blue bell ice cream to be had."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of Italian food...I know, how is that even possible, but I'm not. Even so my son wanted to eat here after his graduation. We  made a reservation for 7 ppl and were quickly seated when we arrived. The service was slow but good. The bread is amazing and everyone seemed to enjoy what they ordered. My food was good for me too not be a fan of if. But overall it was a good experience"}
{"text":"Great dining experience here tonight! The food was great and the staff was exceptional. Especially the manager \"G\" who made sure we were taken very good care of. I would definitely be returning to this Carabbas location in the near future."}
{"text":"My first time visiting Carrabbas, but my lady has eaten at Carrabbas in Tampa Florida in the past.  At her suggestion, we had the Mussels in white wine sauce, which was so spectacular that we mopped up all of the sauce with our bread, the Veal Marsala, which was the best I've ever had and the Chicken Parm, which was equally superb.  I need to return to Carrabbas again.  I found a new favorite Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"Tried to avoid chains last year but people invite us to them , and, well we can't be dicks all the time. The last experience I had at a Carrabba's in Scottsdale was pretty good so  let's try the one in Glendale,  Quickly seated,  drinks, and appetizer  were great. The soup, Spicy sausage and lentil  was so good I looked up a copycat recipe for it . The goat cheese and pomodoro sauce brushcetta  had us feeling all happy and relaxed.   then   main meal arrived. Wife's meat was not medium, not even close you could get red out of it.   Neither myself of the kid had cutlery so  it took a while to get a waiter to stop to remedy this. This interval turned my veal marsala into a gelatinous mess  when cold. It tasted of flour and barely of marsala which I can make about 23 times better at home.   Wife's dish was re heated it  well done with black hightlights .Not a new meal. Now it's heavy on the grill flavor.   Spoke to manager Heather , she came to us, but I can't ask for more ( actually I told them to leave it on the check )  than they drop it.   The kids meal  was great!  but they ruined the evening , seriously a dessert ain't going to count two messed up entrees    2.5 rounded down."}
{"text":"Maybe our experience here was a little skewed since my husband's step-mom knew the head chef (he also works for her at her restaurant of employment). It just so happened that we were celebrating her birthday and we tried going to Ventano's, which was closed for a special event. We had a huge order of calamari (I don't think the normal/regular size is that big). I don't remember what I had but my husband had the lobster mac and cheese- he expected it to be bigger, but said it was good. I also remembered that my husband's step-mom had the steak- well done. Everything was very good (remembered that much). The service was very good. I think all of us were pretty full and satisfied. I'd heard about this Italian restaurant for years and it was nice to finally try it. We'd definitely go back. The prices were about right for entrees.   There was a large wedding reception held in the next room (they do catering). We were seated near the semi-open kitchen. It was particularly crowded, because we had to wait with the rest of the other people on multiple benches. The wait was about fifteen minutes."}
{"text":"Carrabba's is in this weird position of being somewhat yuppie acceptable, yet is still a chain.  I think most people go here just so they put themselves over for not going to Olive Garden.  I'm not an Olive Garden fan by any stretch of the imagination, but I much rather go there than here.  The service is fine.  It doesn't get too crowded here.  The atmosphere is alright.  It's dim without being dark.  Really I just choose Olive Garden over this is because of price.  Carraba's wants to charge everyone just a little bit extra so that you'll feel fancy.  I've had other things, but a good and fresh example in my mind is the Caesar salad I had last night.  Switching from chicken to shrimp was in the neighborhood of 4 dollars.  The salad had exactly 4 pieces of shrimp.  $1 per shrimp is a bit ridiculous.  But in general the food tastes fine.  No complaints about the taste.  It's just the price that bothers me."}
{"text":"We dined here to celebrate my mom's birthday. It was our 1st time and we will be back again. We came in time for Happy Hour. However, my mom recently had knee replacement surgery and all of the booths in the bar were taken. They allowed us to sit in the main dining area and still have happy hour pricing. This made our night start off wonderfully. I was impressed that they were so willing to accommodate my mom. Our server, Danielle, was attentive right from the beginning. She was very knowledgable on the menu, offering suggestions. She never let our water glasses run dry! My mom had the Seafood Spiedino: lightly breaded grilled scallops and shrimp with a side of fettuccine alfredo. I had something off the seasonal menu: Mahi Wulfe with Sauteed Shrimp along with a side of fettuccine alfredo. My dad had pasta: Fettuccine Weesie. We all enjoyed our entrees. In particular, the grilled seafood was cooked perfectly. I can say from my entree, the fish was flaky and delicious. Here is the description from the menu: Lightly breaded, wood-grilled, topped with artichokes, sun-dried tomatoes, basil, lemon butter sauce and sautéed shrimp. Yummy, right? We all had HH drinks as well: Tuscan Lemonade (quite refreshing), $3 Blue Moon for my dad, and Peach Sangria for my mom. For an appetizer, we had 1/2 off mussels, which was perfect to dunk their hot bread into. At the end of they meal, they sung \"happy birthday\" to my mom in Italian and presented her with a mini cannoli with a lit candle on top. What a sweet way to end the night! We saw this place as a step above Olive Garden and the prices do reflect that. However, we do feel that it is worth it. We will be back in soon. It is good to note that they do have specials on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays that we will have to check out."}
{"text":"Everything about this restaurant is average, from the food to the service. If you're looking for good Italian food, this is not necessarily the place, it really is just average. I can think of a lot better restaurants in town."}
{"text":"honestly, the portions are very small for the price. calamari is so so. buca di peppo is far better."}
{"text":"Perfect lunch! Jennifer was our server and she was fast, curtious and professional. What more can you ask for!! I had spaghetti along with soup and appetizer. Everyone was polite and very attentive. Much better than the one off of Eastern in Henderson. For sure we will be back."}
{"text":"It would be great (and easier for everyone) if they had an allergen or vegan menu, but luckily this location has a vegan sympathizer and he was able to list all options without dairy or egg:  Bread, most of the noodles (only 2 contain egg), pomodoro and pic pac sauces. Steamed veggies.   Everything was good. Service was good for a busy night.  Only 4 stars because without the vegan sympathizer I think it would have been tough to order."}
{"text":"Love this place! At first I thought it was a chain so I wasn't expecting much, it sure did exceed my expectation. I love the tilapia and the wine selection is amazing"}
{"text":"Typical chain restaurant environment.  The food was timely and good.  Nothing spectacular but if you want to grab a quick bite of Italian, it'll fill your tummy."}
{"text":"Sad to give this rating.  I usually love Carrabas but they just couldn't get it together on our last visit.  Our waitress was sweet and trying her hardest but seemed overwhelmed.  We both ordered spaghetti with red sauce type dishes.  Flavor was good BUT sauce was thin and there was maybe 1/2 the sauce there should have been.  Our waitress made it right but we had to ask.    We'll go back because I like Carrabbas in general but I probably will stay away from the red sauces & hope the last visit was a fluke."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner Wednesday night. Started off with bread and salad. The bread was warm and delicious, but the dipping oil was sour and horrible. The lettuce in both of our salads was old and tasted like fish. The tomatoes were also old and mushy. Both the balsamic and creamy parmesan dressings were disgusting. There were not many meatless options on the menu, so I was stuck with the fried ravioli in marinara sauce, which I was not really in the mood for, but ended up being not too bad. My first impression was that the marinara tasted like jarred sauce, but it wasn't inedible. The side of garlic mashed potatoes was extremely bland and dry. My date enjoyed his seafood linguine in vodka sauce. We each got a glass of the red sangria, which really just tasted like a sweet red wine with a slice of orange and lime thrown in. We ended with mini cannolis, which were okay. Overall not a very good dining experience, and I would never come back."}
{"text":"The Carrabba's on Eastern is way better than the one in Summerlin on Charleston Blvd. Do to the poor service and food quality at the Charleston location from now on I will only go to the Carrabba's on Eastern."}
{"text":"Eh....Way overpriced for what you get! The prices have skyrocketed in the past 2-3 years and the portion sizes have gone down by 50%. $17 for a salad, small herb chicken breast, and some broccoli. I could make it all for under $4. Food is ok, but I think this is on par with Olive Garden, which is cheaper and you get more for your money.  It seems like this restaurant has a lot of new inexperienced servers. We asked for balsamic vinegar for our bread...never received it. We had to get up and find another server for it. Same goes for another order of bread...never got it. Waiter wasn't good at remembering and following through. Water glasses were constantly empty. Recently, they sent out an email ad saying portion sizes are bigger on pasta...nope. I got raviolis and it was the same portion sizes as it was 6 months ago. If you want a better meal, make it at home or take your money to a better value place like a family run restaurant where you get better portions and better service."}
{"text":"Had dinner here the day after Thanksgiving. Surprisingly at 7:00p it wasn't crowded at all. No wait necessary. We arrived 8 minutes before Happy Hour ended, and we were able to get an order in. Be careful though, only a few wines are on HH. Our server decided not to mention this to us, so my wife's glass of wine cost almost $12.00! Ouch. I ordered the giant meatball special. It was way over cooked. Super dry and the panko coating was almost burnt. Don't get your hopes up on the cheese filling either. It looks nothing like the picture. Haha. I was lucky to get a nibble of cheese in it. Also, don't order pasta as a side dish since pasta already comes with it. Once again it would have been nice if our server had maybe mentioned that fact. My daughter order the lasagna, once again we were left in a bewildered state of shock. It looked more like an appatizer then an entree. It came out in a dish that was maybe 4x8 and half an inch tall. I'm not italian, but isn't lasagna several layers of pasta, sauce and cheese? This looked more like something you would dip your bread in! We would go back, but definetly avoid the above mentioned disasters."}
{"text":"I have to say the service was excellent Madison was great!!! Our food was fresh and delicious and didn't even take that long. Which was a surprise because they were busy. Overall this location was great my group still talks about it 3 days later and we are planning to go back."}
{"text":"Sad to give this place a 1 star cause I love the food, and every time I have been to any Carrabba's it has been amazing (food wise) but this specific one gets a ONE STAR FOR POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE.    We got to the place and they said about 5 min wait, and since we have kids, that was perfect - if it was longer we would have went somewhere else....so we wait and wait and wait ... I go ask and they say they are working on getting our table.  Long story short they forgot about us and we ended up waiting almost 45 min before we got seated....we decided to stay so long because we thought it was \"almost ready\" and did not expect it to turn out the way it did.  Then the waiter got our food messed up - good thing everything on the menu is good because my wife got half of mine, and I got half of hers and then the waiter goes nuts trying to blame everyone else  Very unprofessional!  Horrible service and will probably not go back to this one again unless they convince me otherwise!"}
{"text":"I usually only use Yelp to find places to eat. But my experience at Carraba's was terrible that I had to make a Yelp account to write a bad review. I don't and wouldn't recommend this place. If I can give no stars, I would. Came here for dinner with my family last week. It was our first time coming here and it will definitely be our last. The service was slow and very inattentive. When we were ordering our food, our server didn't tell us that pasta doesn't come with non-pasta dishes, only sides like mashed potatoes or spinach. When we received our food we were all surprised to see how small our \"regular\" entrées were. For the price we were paying we thought our food would be a lot bigger portions. The food was mediocre and cold, like it's been sitting at the window for awhile. Overall for the price it's worth it's definitely not worth paying. I even spoke to a manager regarding my concerns about our dinner and he didn't really seem to care. We won't be coming back here anyway, I'd rather go to Olive Garden!"}
{"text":"Came in here on a Friday night around 6pm, just barely missing dinner rush. We were seated promptly, the waitress (sorry I forgot her name) was very attentive and catered to our needs. Started with Caesar salads that came out very promptly.   The salads were great, not over dressed and had fresh grated cheese on top. One of the better Caesar salads I've had. (Best one so far for me is the one at Ventano with anchovies added)  I got the linguine and clams, wife got lobster ravioli and got some plain cheese ravioli for the kid. My pasta dish was awesome, I thoroughly enjoyed every last bit of it. My wife's lobster ravioli was also tasty as well. My kid's ravioli was very small, 5-6 pieces and included a drink - this was not a good value at all. This was probably the worst part of the whole meal.   We ended with a tiramisu that was a little bit heavy on the booze side compared to other joints but was good nonetheless.  All in all, it was a good meal - just that the kids menu is not a good value.  By the way the restaurant is really really dark. I almost had to use my flashlight to see the menu."}
{"text":"I love the Carraba's in Chandler, but this one on Bell Road was awful. It felt more like a sports bar than a restuarant and the food wasn't fresh. I won't come back to this location - It was very depressing."}
{"text":"Honestly disappointed with our food and service. I  wrote to corporate about my thoughts and concerns and they never even acknowledged my email. So I figured I would save another family from wasting their money. The wait was extremely long the night we stopped in, the waitress was unfriendly, we had to ask her to bring us out the hot bread more than once, left us with no refills on our drinks. Once our food came out It was cold and had no sauce. I was looking at a plate of \"naked noodles\" at an Italian Restaurant. The waitress took my plate back and re-tossed it for me. But when we told her my son's was the same she decided to bring us out a bowl of cold sauce to put on our fettuccine. I guess to shut us up.  I don't know about you but Italians pride themselves on their sauce and making sure family and friends leave full. This was not the case in this restaurant. Left feeling hungry and cheated out of my money. $70.00 for 3 of us that night. No alcoholic drinks, No appetizers, just 1 Chicken Marsala and 2 fettuccine alfredo  with 2 soda's and one ice water. I have had better service, sauce, and fettuccine alfredo at a smaller family restaurant like George's Kitchen. Save your money and time and go someplace else."}
{"text":"We've had very good experiences in the past but we were a bit disappointed with last night's visit. Upon arriving we'll noticed the bar area was quite busy. We asked the hostess if happy hour prices were available in the dining room as well and we were informed they were. They sat us at a table and we ordered food and drinks. I had the lasagna with meat sauce, my wife had the mussels with a cup of minestrone soup and our friend had the chicken wings. All meals tasted great but when the final bill came we were charged full price for the mussels and chicken wings even though they were considered appetizers. When we questioned the waiter he informed us that drinks only in the dining were on happy hour not food items. Shame on the hostess because we could have saved $15 on our overall bill. There needs to be some better training with their staff."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I thought it was ok.  I had the Chicken Bryan and prosciutto-wrapped pork tenderloin with a side Caesar salad.  To be honest, there wasn't anything about my meal that was worth talking about.  Everything was meh for me although the servers were really friendly and attentive to our needs, considering we had a party of 15.    The atmosphere was laid back, casual attire ok.  They take reservations and can accommodate bigger parties if needed.  Overall, I would probably not return to this place because I feel you can find a better Italian restaurant elsewhere for the same price."}
{"text":"I had the Pasta Sostanza but instead of Tagliarini I had it with whole wheat spaghetti.  I was pleasantly surprised at how DELICIOUS their whole wheat pasta is!  I'm so glad I found a spot with a great whole wheat pasta in Charlotte.  The rest of the dish was great as well, right down to the artichokes.    And if you're in the mood for Sangria - the waitress recommended the Blackberry Sangria and I'm glad she did!"}
{"text":"This place has grown on us since we started coming here.  The bread dipped with olive oil and  Spaghetti and meatballs are always a hit for my kids  The main entree comes with a choice of soup or salad and from what I have ordered it is always good.  The portions are big enough for two with pkenty to spare - at least for me.  Service is top notch and they check how you're doing regularly.  Tiramisu is amazing here. Two please! One now and the other for later.  Don't forget to sign up for the dine rewards program as well."}
{"text":"Took my 4 kids and wife out to dinner and we sat at the pizza bar adjacent to the wood burning oven.  Great customer service, especially by the chef who made all the pizza's. Food was hot and very good. No issues or problems. Their menu has a good variety that appeals to both kids and adults. Highly recommend, especially for families!"}
{"text":"I really like this location. I've never had to wait very long no matter what time I've showed up. The staff is so friendly;  walking to our table we are greeted with \"how are you?\" \"Enjoy your meal\" I really appreciate that. The servers are usually enthusiastic, prompt, amd professional. I've never had a problem with the food. My favorite dish here is the Mezzaluna...so delicious.  The chicken parm with the garlic potatoes also always hits the spot. If there is room, I love to end my meal with the chocolate dream cake...never had anything so \"dreamy.\" And of course on the way out we are wished a good night from the staff we pass. I always have an enjoyable experience here."}
{"text":"Such a great place to eat. As a regular, the staff really takes their time to get to know you and really want to do all they can to ensure you come back. They acknowledge their mistakes (which are few and far between) and the cooks you can tell are very well experienced. Just for an example of great service, they comped my meal when my steak came back WAY over cooked and another time when my salmon was raw, and offered free dessert when the food took longer than usual to come out. They would have done that for anybody."}
{"text":"Great food and beautiful restaurant. It is clean, servers are mature, you can tell management expects a lot from the staff, and the food is delivered to order. If you have a problem with your food, management almost always comps desserts or even the meal if it was a major issue. Their goal is to get you to come back and enjoy being there, and you can feel it. Most people that have problems I find fail to bring them up with management while they are there. It is totally worth it, people, management has really made me feel like a welcomed and appreciated customer. Just don't be one of those pricks that feels entitled to everything lol...you won't enjoy going anywhere."}
{"text":"My family dined here last night. The food was good and the portion sizes were worth the price. The only complaint that I could say we have was with the seating. When we arrived we told them we needed a table for 6. The only thing they could offer was a half booth/half table combo. 4 members of our party were physically challenged and we told them we really needed a table. We were informed that there was only 1 table on the restaurant that would seat 6 & it was occupied. The restaurant was practically empty so we asked if we could put 2 tables together and were told they would need to ask the waitress in that section if they would be willing to do that. We ended up taking the booth/table combo and made the best of it."}
{"text":"Bad, bad, bad!  Food was bad, waiter was bad.  My waiter was slow and preoccupied with a lady at the bar.  The manager actually had to get onto him about spending too much time with her.  Two waiters met in front of my table, hugged, kissed, and parted ways.  I really don't car but I have never scene this kind of behavior in a busy restaurant before.  I was very disappointed with this Saturday night dining experience, especially when it cost me $200 dollars.  Damn!  I report, you decide."}
{"text":"Walked in.... told hostess going to bar..... sat......waited.....sat.... waited.... not real long but long enough to have been greeted or recognized by the manager, the waiter wiping glasses the entire time I was there never moved to find the bartender to say he had a customer or the manager who was looking but not seeing. It was 430 and they open at 400 but I guess they don't start waiting and serving until later....I don't know. I left.  Update:  Say what you will but...... this family of restaurants doesn't like losing customers. Even though I was disappointed on my last visit.... I am assured the issues are being addressed. So, if you are visiting this location communicate with the management if there is an issue. I believe issues will be resolved. You know the quality will be top notch."}
{"text":"Had the lasagna and it was really tasty. Also, the bacon and onion flat bread was great too. Service was awesome. Never had an empty glass."}
{"text":"Bland tasting food and poor service.  I came here with my boyfriend a few months ago and it left a bad taste in my mouth.  My food was very bland, my boyfriend said his was okay but I don't know if he was just trying to be nice or not.    There was nobody at the host stand when we came in, then we see a guy approaching the host stand but when he gets to the host stand he turns his back to us and starts wiping a menu or something.  He doesn't greet us or acknowledge that we are standing there.  He finally turns around and seats us and that's where the other issues come up.    We get seated and we see a female server talking to a table next to us and she leaves and walks by our table again  without so much as a hello.  The restaurant was not busy, they had like a handful of tables.  I suspected it was shift change and she didn't want to take us.  I am getting irritated and we were about to leave when another server comes to our table, probably the dinner shift.  She was pleasant but it didn't make up for the terrible first impression and lackluster food."}
{"text":"Honestly probably wouldn't have eaten here if I had read the yelp reviews first, but we ended up having a really great meal. Other than a pizza that we ordered only off of the appetizer and small plates menu, which ended up being a fun way to get a variety of food and due to happy hour was also a decent deal too. We ordered the lettuce wrap (had a kind of sweet olive flavoring), 3 cheese and sausage stuffed mushrooms and grilled asparagus with prosciutto and the wood fired wings. Everything was really good and everyone ended up happy!  Not sure if we just go the luck of the draw, but we did not experience any issues as other reviewers have stated. Worth a try."}
{"text":"Writing this from the perspective of a vegan: This was my fourth visit to this location and it was a fourth struggle to get my food done right.  Carrabba's has limited vegetarian options (their soups are made with chicken stock) and problem is they are also loaded with cheese and dairy.  Knew this was going to be a challenging visit when after telling our waiter we were vegetarian he kept recommending chicken and seafood dishes.  Sure enough, our order came back wrong and cooking staff had to re-do. Even in the re-do the food was so oily and salty it was tough to enjoy.  As good as the bread is, it may not be enough reason to keep returning for this much aggravation."}
{"text":"Drove the40 minutes here for lunch as my daughter & I were both craving Chicken Bryan. Were seated at 1pm & when we went to order was informed they were OUT of mashed potatoes. I was beyond disappointed. I've tried pasta dudes with the entree before & for me. It's just not the same with out the accompanying mashed potatoes. Daughter ordered hers with pasta, I decided to try the chicken Bryan sandwich with a side of marinated cucumber & tomato salad.  Calamari was SPOT on as always, but there is never enough of that fantastic marinara! Entrees come, I taste her pasta. It's ok, wasn't fond of the pancetta in it (or what looked like a pea or maybe a caper? In it).  Now if you LOVE chicken Bryan- the sandwich doesn't even come close. It's a tasty sandwich, and very enjoyable. But doesn't have the same taste as the original fish. Very very THIN piece of chicken too! The cucumber tomato salad is a nice light side dish & not heavily coated with dressing.  Nice gentleman comes by to check on us (of course while I have food in my mouth, lol). I try to clear my mouth & swallow in order to say how disappointed I was that my original choice of fish wasn't available. He quickly remedied that as they finally had potatoes ready. And brought my my favorite chicken Bryan with mashed potatoes. I left very very happy & satisfied!  Craving fulfilled!   Our server was very patient & helpful as well. Thanks for everything!"}
{"text":"Had dinner there last night small beer ,cup of soup and Johnny Rocco salad $40.00 including tip  food was okay but very pricey!"}
{"text":"The Spiedino Di Mare-Shrimp is fabulous!! Also tried the lobster ravioli, pollo rosa maria (stuffed chicken- deliciously yummy), pasta carrabba's (fettuccine alfredo), deep fried calamari & cheese pizza. This place is usually packed so expect to wait. We've always received good service which is why we don't mind returning. We'll definitely be having our italian fix here!!"}
{"text":"It is a okay place to eat but for the price I think better food can be had.  I did like that they had a small portion option.  They also had enough on the menu to make both my girls happy.  Desert was very expensive and so I recommend skipping it and hitting up the French Bakery in the same parking lot."}
{"text":"Let me say up front that I do not like chain restaurants, but Carraba's is my all time favorite restaurant.  Its our go-to place for special occasions.  I always start off with their amazing bread with herbs in olive oil and the house chicken soup.  Then either chicken or pork chop marsala with a side of sauteed spinach, which is to die for. The lasagna is also the best I've had anywhere."}
{"text":"We had dinner this evening on Christmas eve.  The food was excellent and the service as well! With no reservations we were in and out with no wait."}
{"text":"Just ate here for the first time. After seeing the commercials many times we decided to give it a try.  I had the prosciutto wrapped pork medallions with garlic mashed potatoes and it was delicious.  All the food we ordered was great and the service was excellent. Prices are reasonable too. We will go there again for sure."}
{"text":"Dinner on Valentines day. I can say that we waited an awful long time for a table even after we did call ahead. When we finally were seated i was surprised that our tablecoth was full of crumbs from the last people. How romantic.  Waiter was somewhat pompous and was not friendly.  We had to ask him for the complimentary bread.  Food was alright And mashed potatos were worth the upcharge."}
{"text":"Foodies everywhere are cringing, but I really like Carrabas. It's a chain and typically my preference is to go to locally owned spots, but there are exceptions.   Every time I'm here the food is really good, it's consistent and I have always had great service. This is true for all locations but I typically go to the one on Frank Lloyd Write and Scottsdale road.   My last visit I sat at the bar and the bartender was really friendly and the  food was served fast and it was really good. My only complaint is that the bartender didn't give me her name, that happens to be a huge pet peeve of mine. But non the less, I enjoyed the experience and will go back.   I had a pepperoni pizza but I almost always order a fillet Marsala. Pizza was good"}
{"text":"This place was right next to the hotel we were staying at, so it made sense to pop in to get dinner. There was also a TexMex in the lot, but I ry and avoid them if possible. We have done Carrabba's before, so you all know the chain I'm sure! Food is good, selection of beer and wine minimal, but still satisfactory.  We shared several of the appetizers and got a salad each. Salad was pretty meh - small plate, boring taste, lack of presentation and had no variety - was all lettuce, drowned in dressing. No diced onion, tomato, peppers - even a radish would liven this poor thing up! And cheese - please ensure that there is some on the salad! The rest of the food was not bad - arancini, tomato caprese with fresh burrata, stuffed mushrooms, meatballs - all were nice. Small servings but hey, they're appetizers right!   The bread basket was very nice - freshly baked, soft and hot - we actually asked for a second as it was so good. The dipping oil was nice too - so thumbs up here..  We didn't have dessert, even though our waiter offered us some nice desserts - was overall a simple meal but was ok."}
{"text":"We frequent Carrabbas since it close to our house. I have never had to wait for a table more then about 15 minutes and that was on a busy Friday night. Everyone is always very polite. I always get the Veal Piccatta because.. well I love it. It comes with garlic mashed potatoes that are soooo good. Their bread and oil for dipping are also splendid! MMM - They also have a very good Parmesean dressing for salads that my daughter puts away by the handful (she is 2 haha!) All in all it is a moderately priced, delicious, quick meal which is very important when you have a 2 year old :)"}
{"text":"All the food is great except the mashed potatoes have way too much garlic!!  Fried mozzarella is fantastic!!"}
{"text":"For the price, I was expecting something amazing like Maggiano's. I'm not going to say the food wasn't great, because it was. I just felt like I was at Olive Garden or the Macaroni Grill. It was nothing special. The only thing special, was the wine special that they had going on. We got $10 off a bottle of wine that brought it down to $24. That was nice. I wish I remembered our server's name, he was really nice. He brought out the food for my two toddlers first, to keep them calm during dinner. That was a nice touch. My reviews are usually long, but I really don't have anything too special to say about Carrabba's."}
{"text":"Each time I go to this Carrabba's, I know I'll get two things: great service and good food. Tonight we had especially good service! Our servers name was Samantha O., and she was not only really nice, but super attentive! Our drinks never got empty, because she always kept an eye on our table to ensure we wouldn't have to try to find her for refills. This considering that the restaurant was busy made us more appreciative! I ordered the chicken parmigiana, and as always it was delicious, and there was plenty to take home for leftovers!"}
{"text":"Firs time here To be honest i wasn't expecting that much But it was really good They have a nice customer service And food its so delicious  Definitive I'm coming back"}
{"text":"Over all had a great time. Our server was amazing she was very attentive and very nice. She got us everything we asked for & was nice about it all. When we got to the main dish it was a great till I noticed my chicken was a little cold. But over all was a great place to eat."}
{"text":"This USED to be our favorite restaurant  the food is SALTY, the chicken was dry..the steak was tough..the lettuce in the salad was watery(and of all days- it was our anniversary)...plus my amex number was stolen within 20 minutes after paying the bill at Carrabba's(I called and someone did apologize...said they would send a gift card...and that never came)  If you go there...pay in CASH!"}
{"text":"Very nice place with fantastic food. Ask for Peter as your server. He is so polite, friendly and knowledgeable. Thank you for your service Peter! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Kudos to Carrabbas for a real gluten free menu that wasn't filled with dairy ladden options.  We use to be regulars till I was diagnosed with celiacs.  There staff is knowledgeable about gluten and even delivered my salad by saying \"we have a gluten free salad\".  Usually they show up with croutons.  Thanks Carrabbas."}
{"text":"Though I am not a huge Italian food person, it's okay.  With that said, the food here was good and the service was excellent.  So, despite me not loving Italian food, they get a 5 star from me for food presentation, maybe a 4 1/2 star for the food, and 5 star for service.  There were several big parties at the time we were there.  Each table seemed to be serviced well.  We had a big party of 13 people.    My husband got some Pork Tenderloin thing wrapped in Proscuitto and Garlic Mashed Potatoes.  He said the pork was delish.  He also got the Caesar Salad as it came with his dish and he totally LOVED the Caesar Salad.  My husband does not care for salads, but he raved about this salad and asked if I could make it for him at home.  Anyway, he is a meat man, so him wanting salad is pretty much a miracle.  I was able to find the recipe for this Caesar dressing online and when I made it, my husband ate 3 huge servings of it for dinner last night.  I got the Chicken Parmesan with Fettucine Alfredo.  That was okay.  The chicken parmesan was a bit dry and it's not their fault I'm not a huge Italian noodle fan.  My son had Mezzaluna, which is like chicken raviolis.  He said it was okay.  My daughter had Fettucine Weesie, which is Fettucine with Shrimp & Scallops in a lemon butter sauce.  I can't remember what everyone else ordered, but my mom wasn't happy with the original thing, so they remade it for her and it was done to her satisfaction.   Our 2 servers constantly refilled our drinks and water.  Everything was good, so no issues.  Thank you for a good dinner with my family!!!"}
{"text":"Used to be our family favorite. Last visit changed that. Portions smaller, prices higher and beer in very small glasses with a high price tag. Altogether disappointing."}
{"text":"The service was slow and the food was mediocre....I won't go back. For what you pay for a dinner out these days it should be worth it!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! They have these wine pairing dinners that are so much fun. We try to attend one every month. The food is great and you get to try different wines."}
{"text":"Just had dinner here. Our food was great. From the hot bread, crisp salad, then to my chicken entree which was served hot, it was so good. My husband and I were saying that we've never had a bad meal there. Never a problem which considering some of the restaurants around here is rare. Also had a fabulous waiter Jovancho who was really outstanding. Good job Carrabbas!"}
{"text":"Gluten Free Review... We have been going to this Carrabba's for the last year or so. I am a celiac and after some research felt comfortable enough with the food handling practices to give it a go. I have never been ill after eating at this Carrabba's. The wait staff and management always make me feel comfortable with the how my food is prepared and handled. The one time an error was made with my steak (server entered it as well done not medium well) they not only fixed the problem quickly but they removed the meal from the check (I insisted they put it back and they wouldn't) and brought a free desert. I am glad this is a great gluten free option for us and they service is over the top great!"}
{"text":"I am always treated very well at Carraba's.  The service is quick, friendly and on point.  As we were seated, our waiter was in the middle of taking an order at another table so a different waiter, I want to say his name is Bryan......he kindly came over to fill our drink orders since our waiter was busy.  I thought that was a nice touch to step in.  Not that I was in a hurry, just that it was good team work on his part and showed excellent customer service.  After our waiter finished up at the other table he came over and introduced to himself.  I find that the Carraba staff are always very friendly and professional.    My daughter ordered the Chicken Bryan. $15.99.   Topped with goat cheese, sun-dried tomatoes, basil and lemon butter sauce.  Scrumptious!  I had the Fettuccine Weezy, $16.59.  My favorite.   Fettuccine Alfredo with sauteed shrimp, garlic and mushrooms in our white wine lemon butter sauce.  Sometimes the flavor of Alfredo can be strong but this tones down the flavor with the wine lemon butter sauce.  All the flavors meld together so nicely and bring extra dimension of flavors.  Highly recommend giving this a try.   Another one to try is the Chicken Trio.$22.79. If you want to sample a couple different chicken dishes this is the one for you.  Or if you just can't make up or you mind. This Trio comes with: Bryan, Marsala and Rosa Maria"}
{"text":"Lackluster food: dry bread, bland sauces, boring steak. While my wife enjoyed her Lobster Ravioli, I was dissatisfied with my meal in general. Atmosphere was nice for a chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Hubby and I enjoyed our meals which were tasty and fresh.  We were seated promptly, had an attentive waitress and liked what we'd ordered.  There was a little confusion about which sides and salad came with my husband's entree but it was handled efficiently  and to our satisfaction."}
{"text":"Nice place for chain style Italian food. Large portions and excellent service from our waitress. Loaded up on the warm bread and oil dip when you know you'll be stuffed by the time the entree comes around. I had the grilled chicken w/raviolis in Alfredo sauce and for appetizers we had the calamari and the Italian Sausage and Lentils soup."}
{"text":"It was ok. Nothing to brag about. Maybe next time ill have a better experience. No wow factor to bring me back again. Bartender was friendly but not as good as other bartenders at nearby bars that i visit often."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying the employees were very nice. I was able to get seated right away as well and I enjoyed my ice tea, but that is where the positive experience ended. I took my mom to have dinner and we both ordered the Pollo Rosa Maria with grilled asparagus which costs an additional  $1.50 and that is fine, however when I tried to cut it in half it was like cutting into hard straw. Then I tried to put a piece in my mouth and I had to spit it out as it was like chewing into hard straw... these were even skinny stalks. So the $17.00 cost for the chicken was just that.. just the chicken. No sides accompany this unless you want  to pay more. The chicken itself was terrible tasting and super salty. I only ended up taking a small bite and was done.  I had ordered us Ceasars salad and a shrimp appetizer. The lettuce was completely white and came drenched in dressing. Simply could not force myself to put any of that into my mouth. And the appetizer never came. I asked my waiter for the manager letting the waiter know that nothing he did was wrong well accept never bringing us the appetizer.  Manager came and I delicately explained everything to him. He was nice and said they would take care of the bill asking us if we wanted to order something else. I just couldn't do it. I was already passed being hungry and did not want to risk waiting another 30 minutes or so for another meal. I definitely do not recommend spending hard earned money here. It was very disappointing."}
{"text":"We pulled up to the pickup area and ordered a berry dessert. The guy helping was training someone else. He described the desserts well and brought back the good and even offered to put them in the backseat for us. Thanks!!!"}
{"text":"I have always loved Carrabba's, but tonight was especially great. My fiancé and I were sat immediately and even though the food was delicious as always, our server was our favorite! Andy was über patient with us and knew the menu very well. He called me \"sir\" by accident, but he was so friendly and genuine we all laughed it off, (by the way I really don't even look like a dude I promise). He seemed to really care about how we were doing and made our night even better! I will definitely be coming back to say hi to our new friend. :) thanks Andy!"}
{"text":"I was with a party of 6. Our waitress was snotty, rude and classless. When we got our food after 10 years, it was cold. For something that took so long you would assume it would be warm. Then one of our younger diners was cutting open her meatball and found A HUGE PIECE OF GLASS!!!! It possibly was a piece of plastic but no one could confirm what it was, it could have really hurt someone had they not cut the meatball first. The manager was amazing, he comped out meal, but it was because we had terrible service, terrible food and a stressful time. Something that should be effortless was beyond unsatisfactory. I love this restaurant and Have dined many times but I would NEVER return to this location."}
{"text":"Not sure what's up with all the hate for this place here on Yelp. If you show up any weekend you will find many fans of this place. I come here for the veal Marsala, bread, creamy Italian, atmosphere & service.  I love the olive oil and spices they put together for the warm bread, the creamy Italian dressing mixed salad is so flavorful, my Veal Marsala is so creamy and a little sweet just like i like it with the mushrooms mixed in.  This place is always busy and has a nice warm date night atmosphere with great booths and nice furniture.  The service has been always consistently good and I have been to a few locations over the years and everything is always consistent."}
{"text":"Veal Marsala + warm bread + great service = Carraba's"}
{"text":"No complaint the food was excellent, the waitress Zach R. Great person and his service the Best."}
{"text":"Carabba's saved us after we missed a reservation at Crocker Park on my boyfriend's birthday. We got a table after a short wait, the service was friendly and the food good. The atmosphere was calm and private with great low lighting. We enjoyed the visit."}
{"text":"Great place for Italian food. Very family friendly. Mellow atmosphere with friendly and knowledgeable staff. Never had a bad meal. My favorite is Sirloin Marsala and you can choose any pasta they have to go with it at no charge. Recommend to anyone who enjoys quality Italian for a good price."}
{"text":"So I decided to visit here because the last time I visited was in KY and had see. How nice the CEO seemed when on 'NEXT BEST BAKER'... and also because they had done increases in portion sizes ... however I was disappointed greatly.  I first came in and was handed a menu and my daughters and I scanned and sat in the waiting area. ...I saw that the prices were outrageous... but figured must come with the portion increase .... Sono turn to order and the girl who first greeted us was gone and a guy stood there ... I say hi I'm ready to order and this guy looks at me like I just interrupted a conversation he was having with the president !.... however he was standing there alone. ... and he stares at me and finally says 'did u not speak with our Carry-out host'... I had to catch myself not to say something snide... so i said she went in back ... so he says he will go get here ... he stands there for a good five minutes gossiping with another host that came up before he leaves and she then asks the same question .... BELLS going off... so I then I finally get to order and once ordered for carry out the price for pasta primavera and a dessert is $31.00... $9.00 for there lemoncello bread pudding dessert and it tastes like yeast bread with a lemon simple syrup poured over it ... and the past primavera for which was $20 for the dish... barely had any vegetables or meat in it for which I substituted the chicken for shrimp ... to only get 5 shrimp and a mess of boiled angel hair pasta was about a table spoon of peas... 3 bell peppers... 2 scrapes of zucchini... and 4 mushrooms ... and about 3 cups of Angie hair ... and the sauce was limited to a corner of the dish and no where else on the pasta... so ultimately the portion was bigger but the portion of what !... not the pasta in its fullness with the meat and the vegetables!... so I gotta day now I remember why I favor Olive Garden and Bucca De Bepo... because price if spent high should be spent well De Beppos!...and if at a decent price Olive Garden !"}
{"text":"Very good been going here for years since my mom was around used to come here for family get togethers . Unusually slow for a Friday night.   Need a simple menu for simple items like spaghetti or ziti or shells.   Manicotti things like that."}
{"text":"A large group (about 12) and I recently had a graduation celebration dinner here. Let me just preface this by saying that I had a TON of requests for the staff to accommodate before I even stepped into the restaurant. As the girlfriend of the graduate, I had brought a cake from home that unfortunately was falling apart on my way over the restaurant. I called in, a little frantically, and the staff was very helpful in agreeing to take the cake from me, making sure it stayed together, placing it in the freezer briefly, then the fridge, putting on the candles I had also brought from home, and then bringing out a small team of servers to present the cake to my very ecstatic boyfriend. When I arrived, the hostess still opened the door for me, even with my very heavy cake in one hand. Love love love it.  Our group had called in to make a reservation for 20, but 7 or 8 didn't show. The restaurant was very forgiving of this and made sure to bring our food quickly once we told them we were ready to order. The bread and olive oil dip was DELICIOUS. I had to stop myself to save room for my salad and main dish. I had the Pasta Carraba, which was not the absolute best fettucini alfredo I've ever had, but it was good. I will say that some of the other dishes seemed a bit pricey, but I had leftovers, so I would say my dish was priced about right. The atmosphere was also lovely, with great music choice playing in the background.  Overall, it is truly the service here that earns this Carraba's its stars. Thanks to the wonderful staff at this location, my evening went smoothly and the entire group had a fantastic time."}
{"text":"Great service, food and bottled. Ask for the best waiter, Cody! He's knows he's menu to the T! We will be back and request you! The wine special was awesome! The shrimp and scallop alla vodka was to die for!"}
{"text":"This is my second visit to this particular Carrabas and I did not have a good experience.  First we were treated badly, then they tried to change that, but the damage was done.  First let me say I do not send food back in a restaurant.  I can count on one hand the number of times I received a restaurant meal that I couldn't eat, however.  This was one of them.  I had the sirloin skewers with onions and tomatoes.  The plate was hot, but the food was ice cold.  The meat was cooked, but cold inside.  My side of fettuccini was hot around the edges and cold in the center.  The pasta was gummy, not \"al dente\".    When I told the waitress my meal was cold, she practically yelled at me that I was not in my seat when she served it.  I had sat down as she walked away because I went to wash my hands.  I felt like a child being scolded.  She said she would get the manager as there were similar problems with other meals at our table.  She made it clear that we had our meals, however, and that was that!  No one was going to do anything more!  A little while later she returned in a more conciliatory attitude, offered my table mate a chance to order another meal, but frankly, we didn't know what someone might do to our meal since we complained.    I just decided to take my meal home and heat it.  My friend ate nothing.  We were charged a reduced rate for the meals, but the experience means we won't go back there.    I will forget the cold meal, but I will never forget how I was made to feel."}
{"text":"They make Olive Garden look good."}
{"text":"Freezing in the bar, where the appetizers are  half off. Bring a sweater and coat. You'll need  it. Great  food and  prices,  but the temperature won't  let you  stay  too long. Bummer,  would be great otherwise."}
{"text":"Haven't had a bad experience yet. So satisfied. I always order curbside pickup, the ladies are so friendly! Thanks!"}
{"text":"Blooming brand had lost their mind! Who in the right mind is going to pay $18.92 for chicken bryan???? I have loved this place for years and more than doubling the price for an item is ridiculous. They have definitely lost a good customer over this rise in prices."}
{"text":"Here's the deal. The food is actually really really good. Surprisingly so actually. The cost is expensive, but give the food quality I'd say it's nearly warranted.   So why two star?   -1 for food cost.  -2 for horrible interior   The interior of this place looks like an Olive Garden from the 90s. Literally looks like it hasn't been updated in 20 years. It's depressing even being in there. We do to go, but refuse to eat in. Just too outdated.   Surprised they can stay in business with such a poor atmosphere."}
{"text":"The new \"cost cutting\"  at Carrabba's may cost them some customers.   I haven't been here in a while,  but changes have definitely taken place.  I first noticed on the salad.  Its HALF the size it used to be.  As a \"scratch Kitchen\"  you used to be able to put any \"side dish\" with your entree.  Now there's an up charge for Alfredo side, due to the \"cost of dairy\" our waiter said.  The entree portion was also smaller and I'm pretty sure I got one less shrimp and one less scallop.   Its not like we went away starving, but when you're used to generous portions and generous service,  Tight ass is not so appealing .  The peach sangria was yummy."}
{"text":"The food is decent, although not the best Italian food I've eaten. Very commercialized and not very authentic. I can live with food in a pinch, but the service is just plain terrible. Dine in or take out, it's the same disorganized, slow, and sometimes rude treatment on each of the 6-7 times I've been to the Carrabba's  in Henderson. If your stuck and are dying for Italian food and every place else is closed, then go, otherwise look around a bit. There's bound to be better authentic Italian with a whole lot better service."}
{"text":"Food is good. Service is good. The smell emanating from the bathrooms is beyond gross. Makes eating so unappetizing. It's been this way for at least six months. This isn't a fast food joint. Fix your bathrooms!  Edited to add:  The bathroom smell has been fixed!   Now they need to get a new bartender. He's awful.  Waiters and waitresses are great."}
{"text":"There is sparse choice in dining options in Malvern...we find ourselves at Carrabbas because of convenience, not any overwhelming desire to eat there.  Good news first: the blackberry sangria is excellent.  I do prefer my drinks on the sweet side, and it tasted like candy.    However, the rest of the food was very blah.  We ordered the bruschetta to share, but I'm not sure what we really got.  Cheese (I'm guessing a goat cheese ricotta) balls sitting in warm marinara sauce with sliced garlic bread on the side...since when is this bruschetta?  It wasn't bad, per se, but my tablemates and I were quite confused, to say the least.  Entrees were uneventful.  Lobster pasta special was bland, Pasta Weesie was greasy, etc etc.  Service was fairly laughable, though at least we got an apology when our ticket was \"lost\" in the kitchen and that was why we had to wait 20  minutes for our food."}
{"text":"I recently stopped by this location for a late lunch with my parents after some furniture browsing at Boca park. The restaurant was pretty empty so we were quickly seated by the host who also ended up being our server. He was super friendly and accommodating throughout the entire meal.   Food wise I had the Parmesan Crusted Chicken Arugula along with a side of Cavatappi and a Cesar salad. The salad was tasty and pretty standard of most Caesar salads. The chicken was very good and HUGE. The lunch portion came with two large slices of chicken and a hefty helping of the cavatappi. I had enough for dinner leftovers as well.   Overall I was a fan of this place even though it's a chain and nothing super unqiue or exciting. Good food, huge portions and decent prices."}
{"text":"I had the Lamb.  It was excellent.  It was not a petite cut it was three carnivore man cuts.  My wife had the lasagna and my three year old daughter had the spaghetti and meatballs.  Both their entrees we're excellent as well."}
{"text":"Went there last night for a quiet belated anniversary dinner. Seated immediately and we were greeted by our server Justin promptly. Returned with our drinks quickly and took our appetizer order. We ordered the Calamari and it was a large portion and cooked perfectly and accompanied by a loaf of bread with dipping oil. Everybody has their own style of Calamari and Carrabba`s is very good. Next was the large dinner salad which was very good and bigger than most places. I ordered the Pollo Rosa Maria and the wife had Parmesan Encrusted Chicken. Gotta say that when I bit into mine, I did a double take thinking there was steak smothered under there. Excellent dish with a side of spaghetti. My wife enjoyed hers also but we had quite a bit left to take home. Great ambience and service."}
{"text":"Went in to relax and have some fish for dinner. The food was good but I felt rushed. As soon as at down I asked for a menu and was asked in return what I wanted to drink. Not uncommon but then I was asked if I was going to want bread. What? I just sat down!"}
{"text":"As far as chain Italian joints are concerned, this is one of the top ones out there.  About the only other one I like is Bravo, and there aren't many of those out there.  Everything I have had here is good to great.  My favorite dish is the Linguini Pescatori (without Mussels) and i also know the Chicken Parm is very good."}
{"text":"Ive been going here for years and I love it.  They have great food and pretty decent prices.    The wait is usually not bad if you go before the dinner rush.  They can usually seat you right away.  You get bread  with a nice olive oil herb dip to eat before dinner.  (Make sure you ask for fresh bread... if you go too early, they give you the lunch bread).  My favorite to eat there is the Pollo Rosa Maria.. two pieces of chicken breast stuffed with cheese, covered with mushrooms and with a nice side of fettuccine Alfredo.  Delicious.  My favorite thing of all here is their iced tea..  just plain iced tea.  Im not a fan of passion fruit or weird fruity mango teas, so this place fits it perfect.  The staff is friendly and the smells coming out are great!"}
{"text":"Like Red Robin, Carraba's is my go-to Italian joint that I know I wont be disappointed in.    I love their bread and the yummy oil/herbs that go with it.  I do ask for butter as well, but they always seem to bring out this frozen ball of butter.  I don't get that.  The best dish they have is their Pollo Rosa Maria.  It consists of two chicken breasts, stuff with fontina cheese and covered with a huge helping of sauteed mushrooms.  Make sure to get it with fettuccine alfredo.  It's a must!... if you don't like pasta, I dont know what to tel ya.  The combo of the two is a match made in heaven.  They have great salads and their own special house dressing.  Heads up on your ranch lovers.  they do not have ranch dressing.  As for their deserts, Im not much of a fan until they have their quarterly creme brulet.  Good food!"}
{"text":"A few weeks ago, we had come here after a long time.  We decided to go again tonight, to see if the last time was a fluke, or they had really gotten that much better.  Well, the answer was...they really have gotten better!  Tonight our server was Joel, who was friendly, attentive and quick to refill our ice teas.    For our appetizer, we got the zucchini fritte.  It was scrumptious!  The zucchini were cut in small strips, lightly breaded and seasoned, with an amazing garlic aioli dipping sauce.  We ate them like fries, they were so good!  Our caesar salads were actually much better.  The last time, mine was underdressed and undercroutoned (if that isn't a word, it should be).  This time, it tasted like it should, and the parmesan on top was really wonderful.  My hubby got the same thing he ordered last time (combo of chicken parmesan and fried ravioli), but instead of garlic mashed as his side, he went with fettucini alfredo.  He told me that it was even better than the last time he had it.  I decided to go a little lighter and ordered the wood-grilled chicken.  It was perfectly cooked, nicely seasoned and juicy.  My side was sauteed green beans, which were really flavorful.  I decided to add the 5th star this time, since they outdid themselves with everything."}
{"text":"Carrabba's is a very good Italian restaurant. The last time we wanted to go though, we ended up leaving.  It was really busy for a Monday night surprisingly, and the wait time was like 40 minutes for a party of 2. Next time we want to come, we'll make a reservation.  The food is good though, and so is the waiter service. The hostess was rude the last time we came in. I would go back."}
{"text":"Enjoy Carrabbas very much. Excellent Sangria (Blackberry a favorite) We have had nearly 100% superb waitstaff, friendly and accomodating. It can get confusing because as the food is ready, other waitstaff may bring to the table...so you often see multiple people in a short time. Love the lasagna, very generous portions, And the House salad is always fresh and the Parmesan dressing wonderful. Chicken Bryan, Lobster MacNCheese, and a seasonal pork medallions with a fig sauce all excellent. Wish they had  Apple Crostada year round---kind of like a free form apple pie but so much more...And please keep the mini desserts on the menu year round. they are perfect size!"}
{"text":"Great time and delicious food every time. Faith was our server and she was amazing, such a sweetheart. We got almost all of the small plates to start with and they were fantastic. The soups are awesome and so tasty. I'll be back real soon :)"}
{"text":"My wife and I will not go back to this unit.  So inconsistent....service, food, etc.....  The unit in Mesa is much more consistent.  4 more miles to drive but I am tired of being disappointed."}
{"text":"#Sorrynotsorry, but I like this place.   If you turn your nose at chains that's your prerogative, but I think this place is really good. I've been coming here awhile for both my sister & mother's birthdays & we're big fans of the food and service.  I don't like to get \"traditional\" Italian food when I come here, because in the back of my mind I know I'll compare it to homemade stuff, and that's why I get the chicken o'brien. It's yummy! They've had this promotion going on at Carrabba's the past couple months where they've been pairing two different entrees, so I've been getting the o'brien w/the pork tenderloin which is also yummy. I usually get it w/either mashed potatoes or green beans, both of which are delicious.   I also LOVE the salads that come w/entrees at Carrabba's. I always get the creamy parmesan, and I love that they throw in a few greek olives and the fact that the salad is super cold (and comes on a cold plate). I like when restaurants do that w/salad. The pre-meal bread is soft, warm, and delicious as well.   I've had a few different appetizers here, which have all been good, but I LOVE the bruschetta! I like that it's \"build you're own,\" and I like that there's a few different varieties.   Granted, I've always came here late afternoon on the weekend when this place isn't very crowded, but I've always had really good service at this Carrabba's. Like, REALLY good & attentive. The servers are always on top of drink refills.    For this food, price and service I love Carrabba's (well, at least this one), and I'll continue to come here."}
{"text":"I love, love, love this place my family and I are here on a weekly basis. We know a lot of the staff and they feel like family. My favorite is the chicken marsala and chicken bryant with a side of Mezzaluna I get it all the time. My daughter has eaten her way through the menu. For this to be a chain it is authentically delicious. We have eaten and carrabbas in other states and still the quality of food didn't change that is a true sign of quality control. My other daughter loves the veal."}
{"text":"I love this place we eat there 3 to 4 times a mouth. I love the service and when there is a complaint management is quick to address it. Often we see the results and our bill. We have been going there since the end of the 90s . my daughter had tired just about everything on the menu."}
{"text":"The waiter was amazing. The salad and bread was amazing. However, the entrees were AWFUL. The pasta was so over cooked, it all stuck together in a pile of goop. Never again."}
{"text":"Service was terrible. Waitress was not  enthusiastic at all. Didn't even check back to see how meal was. Had chicken marsala and the mushroom sauce tasted burnt and the pasta was cold. I had a Margharita pizza and all ingredients just slid off the pizza. Bread was not given until 3/4's of the way through the meal. This place has no idea of how to cook Italian food. They need a REAL chef! Will not be returning."}
{"text":"My wife and hi we ben going to vito s for the past 10 years steel same people same smile same great food give vito s try you woul love"}
{"text":"Great bartenders and waiters and manager, which make the place even more attractive.   The lentil soup is the best I've ever had in any chain restaurant. Spicy but addictive.  Their ribeye, when available, is out of this world too. Especially with the savory butter that it comes topped with."}
{"text":"It's been forever since we stepped into a Carrabba's! We came here for dinner on Saturday night. I called ahead and while they do not accept reservations they can put your name on their list before you head out to shorten any waiting times. At around 5:15 it was moderately busy and by the time we left it was pretty packed with patrons.  We started with the arancini. These little fried rice balls were perfectly cooked with a crispy outer coating, tender rice, and sausage. The marinara sauce with them was robust and went well with them.  The other entrees were nicely presented and for the most part everyone was happy with them. The fish dishes (Salmon and mahi mahi) had a smoky flavor to them from the use of cherry and oak wood on the grill. The only slight negative for my mahi mahi dish was that the artichokes in the sauce were cold compared to the temperature of the fish.  Dessert was a hefty portion of tiramisu. Creamy, chocolate deliciousness!  Service was excellent. Our waitress was cheerful, friendly, and had good knowledge of the menu. Drinks were filled as needed, and were plates taken away in good time.  If you are like smoky flavored foods cooked on a grill, this is a great choice for service and food quality."}
{"text":"This place has a very nice atmosphere. The restaurant is nice and clean. The servers aren't overly friendly, at least not the ones I have come into contact with. The bread is very good especially with olive oil. The food was good but here is where this place falters. The food is expensive for the small portion they give you. I don't mind paying money if I get a good portion. I didn't even leave full. Needless to say that was enough to make me not want to come back."}
{"text":"This restaurant is expensive for the little amount of food you receive. The food is good.  I don't mind paying top dollar, but I want to get my moneys worth if I do.  The environment is quaint and the service was good. The bread is the star here. They have the best complimentary bread over any other restaurant."}
{"text":"Pros:  -Clean -Nice ambience -Good size booths   Cons:  -Can't think of any right now"}
{"text":"Last time we came service wasn't great. But that was a bit ago so we came again and I must say for a Franchise, the prices are way too high.  The service isn't can't fantastic and the bread they offer, smelled like play-do. I didn't even bother tasting it. Won't be back. I just get the feeling it's frozen good that's thawed- not saying that it is! Just felt the prices are really high and I'm not too impressed."}
{"text":"This was one of the worst meals ever.   We went because my wife received some giftcards from a patients family at the hospital she works at.   The service was lousy but the food was worse. Bland, uninspired and came cold to boot. They don't have garlic bread? I got a lame excuse for why. I grew up in NY. This is not italian food. A manger stopped by and asked how everything was and we said ok. All she had to do was look at our uneaten plates to know. I really didn't want to complain because I didn't want anything else from them. I just wanted to leave.   When we got home I realized that the nice people who had gone out of their way to give my wife a $100 gift card were just ripped off. I wrote to the company to let them know of my experience and have never heard back.    I have managed and worked at restaurants for over 25 years. I understand it's a tough job. Mistakes happen, but you should address them.   I usually don't complain, I just never go back. This was well beyond bad and the lack of follow up on a guests lousy experience speaks volumes. I will never darken the door of any of the OSI Restaurant Partners establishments (Outback, Fleming's, Roy's, Bonefish) if that's how they treat their guests.  Caveat emptor."}
{"text":"Service was meh, the server lacked any enthusiasm and for a Tuesday night after 7 I would think things would move along a little quicker.  They forgot the bread , and the kitchen messed up the sides. They played my side on my wife's plate and hers on mine.  Rather than offering to fix  they let us eat off each other's plate.  I'm cool with that, but at hey at least offer to fix it. To boot the grilled veggie was over cooked and way too much pepper. Portions were average to small for the price. My wife liked the sangria but we agreed the food was so-so and three stars is probably generous."}
{"text":"Amazing how much this place has fallen off....\"Host\" need a refresher course on seating patrons, overall cleanliness of the dining area needs to be improved, we shouldn't have sit in everyone's else's crimps.  My wife said the bathrooms need immediate and thorough cleaning and restocking of supplies.  The only positive was our waitress, Winter."}
{"text":"Ordered the salmon and they gave me chicken. Like I can't tell the difference?  But they were nice about it and offered to replace it."}
{"text":"We loave carrabbas, the food is always great and the service friendly."}
{"text":"Way over priced at $17 for a a steak the size of a plum. So tough I couldn't cut it. Service wasn't bad but the food is not that great. I wouldn't go back. Waitress mumbled when I asked for two checks. Even happy hour prices were high for the quality and portion size. I used to love the one in Oklahoma but no longer a fan."}
{"text":"I live for the bread and dipping oil. Very nice place. Would be excellent for a date night. Good ambience and delicious food."}
{"text":"Ate at the bar. the bartender seems to know some of the regulars there at the bar and spends most of time catering to them and not those who visit occasionally. The food was average and is starting to get more like cafeteria food than home cooked Italian. The bartender certainly made the experience less appealing. Very distracted and forgot many things."}
{"text":"After reading the various reviews we were a little skeptical. It was Friday evening at 5:30 when we arrived. The restaurant was crowded but we were seated immediately. Our server, Daniel, arrived soon after we were seated. He took our order for both our drinks and food. Our drinks arrived promptly followed by our salads and then our main course dishes. Our food was delicious and it was a very enjoyable experience. We love Carrabba's and will be back!"}
{"text":"I've been to Carabbas many times before in other cities but this one left me really dissapointed. I took a first date there recently and the place left the both of us really unhappy.   The food we ordered was sloshed in sauce to the point where you had to pick out the actual pasta and food. It was also congealing and looked like it was sitting for awhile. I'd compare it to something you buy at the supermarket and put in the microwave for too long.   We picked at our food and decided we were better off getting Indian next door."}
{"text":"five out of six times, the food is good.  that sixth time, not so much.  I'll give them four stars for the effort."}
{"text":"My husband ordered \"The Johnny\", he said it was some of the best steak he's had. I ordered the fettuccine weesie, it was so goooood. The service was so good, they were on top of clearing the plates so quickly. The whole meal was amazing. I enjoyed sitting at the pasta counter. It is so fun to watch the cooks hopping to make everything."}
{"text":"We've eaten at this restaurant a few times.  Nowhere serves fabulous sweet carrots like Carrabba's.  Besides that just about anything on their menu is delicious.    The only complaint I have this time is I had to ask four times to get extra ketchup.  Four times!  Thus, the four stars instead of five stars.  However, that's normally not the case.  Service is usually really good.  This time I ordered the catfish.  I love catfish and this is  a great place to get a huge plate full of it.  There were no complaints on the food from the 8 people at our table.  The amount of food served is huge.  You can figure whatever you order you can walk away with enough for the next day's meal.  It definitely is a top winner in the Chandler location."}
{"text":"Best resturant expierence we have had in a long time. Our server, Jorge, was polite and effecient. He was quick to pick up dishes when we were done, brought out new drinks before our glasses were empty, and boxed up our leftover food for us before we left. The food was beyond delicious! The management was supurb and there was always someone there in case it was needed. We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"For whatever reason, I don't actually get to Carrabba's often.  I think that it is because we had a really bad experience at the Olive Garden once, and Carrabba's is just guilty by association.  In any case, we stopped in for a celebration of some sort (birthday I think) and had a decent time overall.  The staff was very friendly, service was fast and the food was solid.  While there is still a part of me that associates most Italian chain restaurants with Olive Garden, Carrabba's does a good job in this regard - they treat you well and make for a decent night out.  It's not unique, but it's definitely not Olive Garden either."}
{"text":"The meal is excellent!  but we did find bones in the soup! Not too cool! That salad was great! Just take care and enjoy it!!!"}
{"text":"I had the shrimp alla vodka! It was delicious. They have really good service, feels like you're at a family restaurant, but with impeccable service.   I'd go back to Carraba's for lunch or dinner . It's a great place, and he  wait staff is very nice!"}
{"text":"I just love this place. The waiters are so friendly and really seem to care about whether you're happy. And we always are. :) I especially like that there are always some great veggies to choose, rather than a salad and potato. I had the garlic spinach and zucchini last night with Chicken Bryan.... YUM!"}
{"text":"I went to the Surprise, AZ location and ordered a steak well done which came out burnt and the manager came over asking me if I would like it replaced said it would just take a few minutes which it took over 10 minutes by the time I got my meal my party was done eating really poor service I didn't get to enjoy my meal with my family."}
{"text":"Always great service. I'm a waiter and I usually order togo. Always friendly curbside assistance, even if I'm running late. Chicken Trio and Lentil soup, you will not be dissapointed."}
{"text":"Carrabba's is good, just a little on the pricier side. I love the atmosphere when dining in because it makes you feel relaxed while you eat. Lobster ravioli and most of the chicken dishes I like getting. The calamari is really good, the pieces are nice sized and not overly chewy like other places.  Overall it's a good place to come when feeling a little Italian."}
{"text":"I love Carrabba's and have been eating there since they opened. I have been to many different locations in FL and AZ so I feel like I am a good judge of their consistency. I often order the same appetizer and entree most visits. The mussels (cozze bianco) and the Chicken Bryan.  Occasionally I stray and order a special or the veal. At any rate, this location prepared the mussels incorrectly.  They weren't bad, just not as good. The Chicken Bryan was perfect. Not the best location as far as performance and but definitely worthy. Loved the garden roof, not all locations them so that earned them extra credit!"}
{"text":"Back again! I veered off course and ordered the shrimp scampi appetizer instead of the mussels. What a pleasant surprise!  I feel like it was the best shrimp scampi I have ever had! We always sit at the pasta bar where we are treated like kings. The portion sizes are larger and I am grateful! I have been a fan of this chain for at least 20 years. I almost always order the Chicken Bryan and I did again this time.  It was perfect! The chef gave us a free snack too! The rice balls with marinara and they were amazing as well. It was Happy Hour so I also ordered a quartino of peach sangria - my favorite drink they serve. I didn't get carded lol I dont hate em though. Maybe its because they know me lol? At any rate my date had the Veal Marsala and it was great too. I ALWAYS order the lentil soup instead of the salad. That on on point as well.  Thank you for being consistent! Loved the 20% coupon offered that Yelp links too as well!"}
{"text":"For years, this was my favorite, go-to Italian restaurant, especially in the Henderson/Anthem area.  I went back tonight for the first time in quite a few months. And boy, was I disappointed. Within minutes of being sat down, I was informed that my favorite dish (which I've been getting at Carrabba's since at least 2006) has been removed. (WHY?!?!?!) If it ain't broke, DON'T fix it!!! Their cavatappi amatriciana was the BEST. There was a reason I constantly ordered it for more than 10 years. It was an out-of-this-world pasta. I was honestly heartbroken when they told they removed it from their menu.  I ended up getting their penne with marinara. It was completely bland and flavorless. I'll be honest, I'm only giving it two stars because the meatballs are still amazing, and the bread with the olive oil is still awesome. The waiters are consistently really friendly and likable. It's just such a shame they got rid of their best thing on the menu.  In the end, I don't see myself coming back here. Ever again."}
{"text":"We've been coming to this yummy place for the last 10 years and they never disappoint. Fresh plates, never reheated unlike other \"Italian\" restaurants. The staff is always friendly and prices are great for the quantity of food you are served. 100% Satisfied!!!"}
{"text":"Last weekend I was traveling in Phoenix with a camera crew. By the time we had completed some filming, every restaurant where we were was closed. We called the manager at Carrabba's and she agreed to keep the kitchen open long enough for us to get there. We ordered salad with spaghetti and meatballs ahead for the group. We got there 20 minutes after they technically closed, but they had the food hot and waiting. The food was excellent and we REALLY appreciate the service."}
{"text":"I've eaten at this particular Carrabba's probably 25 times, and at numerous other locations over the years, including the one off of FLW up in Scottsdale. It's usually in my top 3 whenever anyone offers to take me out for a meal (truth be told, it ain't cheap...but it's well worth it).  The bread they bring out for starters is great, but it's the herb mix that they mix with the oil that really makes it fantastic. Sooo good. I usually order the chicken noodle soup, which certainly ain't no Campbell's. It's got a nice, spicy kick to it, unlike any other chicken noodle soup I've ever had before, and it has HUGE chunks of soft, white meat chicken.  For the main course, I usually stick with the chicken parmesan. Two healthy sized chicken breasts flattened out, breaded, and cooked to perfection. Just the right amount of cheese and traditional red marinara to top it off. For my pasta I go with their fettucini alfredo, I'm sure it isn't the healthy option, but it's a great compliment to the chicken. The portions are so big (on top of being half full on bread and soup already) that I always end up taking half of it home with me.   I've sampled their lasagne (usually my Dad's choice), and it's quite delicious...my mom and my sister usually opt for the filet with a side of marsala sauce, and 9 times out of 10 it's amazing. From time to time, the chef undercooks it, but everyone's idea of \"medium-well\" is (somewhat) subjective, and they're always happy to throw it on the grill for a few more minutes if necessary. Another item that I've enjoyed is the garlic mashed potatoes, and that says a lot because I'm not usually a big fan of 'em elsewhere.  I think I've had dessert here maybe twice, because by that point in the dining experience I am usually so stuffed that I can't even fathom cramming any more food into my face. Regardless, the chocolate cake/ice cream thing we got was also top notch.  The service is usually great, the establishment is always clean and proper, the atmosphere is pretty cool, a bit loud at times when the place is busy, but that doesn't really bother me. I didn't come here to have an in-depth discussion of politics, I came to get my grub on! There's an older Italian guy at the Scottsdale location that never fails to remind me that my hat is on wrong...which just furthers his old school italian credibility.   5 stars, no question about it. LOVE this place!"}
{"text":"Not until they put zucchini frites back on the menu."}
{"text":"Per the attached article I am so disappointed in myself for eating here. Management should be ashamed of and should be held accountable!!!  NEVER eating at any of your locations. Bye bye chicken noodle soup   http://www.charlottestories.com/10-worst-charlotte-restaurant-health-scores-july/"}
{"text":"I ate here years ago on a date and it was quite unmemorable.  My fiancee convinced me to go back, and I must say, it was worth the second chance.  Our server was excellent. We started with their featured app and it was absolutely amazing!  Salads were okay, but the entrees were absolutely awesome.  Hot, fresh, clearly made to order.  They now know what their doing at this place!  The manager stopped by our table to make sure everything was as ordered.  Overall amazing experience.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"The calamari was very good and my veel Marsalis was extremity good.  It pays to call ahead.  They don't take reservations, so calling ahead is the next best option."}
{"text":"Chain Italian isn't high on our list but we had a gift certificate so why not....  I was pleasantly surprised!  Complimentary bread (soft, crusty, warm, yumm-o!) and olive oil/spices to dip in got us started in the right direction.  We ordered spiedino di mare (grilled shrimp w/ some kind of breadcrumb topping & cream sauce) and broccoli from the regular menu and espresso rubbed ribeye w/ garlic mashed potatoes off the specials.  Salads with both entrees.  We were both delighted with our choices.  The steak was cooked as ordered and enough for 2 meals.  It was all I could do to stop myself from licking the shrimp cream sauce off my plate.    Did I mention I was surprised?  Yes, well it was a very enjoyable meal.  Service was basically good, we were in and out within 1 hour.    Total for our meals w/ 1 soda came to $45.  Not open for lunch during the week.  Too bad!"}
{"text":"I had the good fortune of eating here on a special tasting event for their frequent diners. No, I do not dine there often, but a friend of a friend brought me along and boy was I happy to attend!!!  The manager of the restaurant, known as 'Big Dave' (you'll see why once you meet him) is a really earnest and amicable guy. He took care of us and made sure my Arnold Palmer was just right.   On to the tastings: I would strongly recommend the beef skewers, the lobster mac n' cheese, and the potato-crusted haddock. The haddock was juicy, covered in a hash-brown material, and topped with a delicious white glaze. Give it a shot!  Altogether, the restaurant experience was delightful, and they really worked on their ambiance since the last time I dined there."}
{"text":"Seems the quality and service is back to what I remember it being.  So glad.  I was sad when I thought they were going downhill after a few bad incidents.  Maybe they changed the kitchen staff.  Well whatever they did.  I'm glad it back to normal.  Because I like their food better then Olive Garden.  Thanks to the manager for listening and addressing my concerns.  Now that's impressive service!!!"}
{"text":"The Sicilian chicken soup is a must have. It's a bit spicy, also fresh and delicious. The homemade bread with dipping spices are excellent. The fettuccine pasta tastes like fresh egg pasta, it's superb. For a restaurant chain, they really do well with authentic Italian flavors."}
{"text":"Another great meal at Carrabba's's Italian grill! I came in here for lunch on a Saturday. First off, you have to love the freshly baked bread that is served warm to your table. This is served with olive oil with an array of Italian spices added. I had the Sicilian chicken soup as a starter, and it was delicious. They somehow were able to serve a hot soup and have the pasta in it be perfectly al dente. I got the fettuccine alfredo and I would recommend this to everyone! The fettuccine noodles are phenomenal, they have to be fresh pasta. The fettuccine sauce is silky and cheesy. The waitress was very friendly and attentive. We never had to wait for drink refills."}
{"text":"Always been a fan of this franchise and this particular iteration of the great Italian chain is no exception.  Even on the busiest evenings (there is a STRONG elderly early dinner crowd on the weekends!) I have found service to be efficient and friendly.  A very spacious bar area lends itself to the lone diner/drinker, with ample seating and nice TV's.  A great spot for happy hour or perhaps a libation before a movie (Harkins is literally a stone's throw away), this location always brings good food to the table while keeping prices reasonable.    4.2 stars!"}
{"text":"It didn't start out so well. They lost our call ahead seating but it wasn't very busy and they seated us in about five minutes. Nobody came to serve us. After 7-10 minutes of waiting, a waiter finally stopped over to see if we had been greeted. This is where it gets better.   Tony quickly took our drink orders, asked if wanted appetizers and offered to take our entree orders if we were ready. He said he would straighten everything out. The manager quickly came over and apologized. She offered to buy us two free appetizers. Before she could walk away, we were served complimentary meatballs. Free asparagus, chicken lettuce wraps, and two orders of mozzarella quickly followed.   Although Tony was rushed by adding an extra table, he gave us all the attention we needed and never missed a thing. Both managers stopped by and made sure things were great. I've never been so well attended to in my life, and I've been to some incredibly nice steakhouses. Kudos to the staff and management for completely turning around a bad experience.  The pollo Rosa Maria and Chicken Brian were both very good, as usual. Service saved the day. Mistakes happen, but it's how you respond that dictates how the evening goes."}
{"text":"Thank you Carrabba's for your Berry Sangria.. Tom was very helpful and recommended a new dish and turned out ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL. Thank you again"}
{"text":"We have been to these restaurants through out Arizona  seem to be good better then olive garden. But nothing to exciting.  But this time we went to the Ray /i10 location and WOW!!!!! THE FLAVOR WAS WAY BEYOND OUR EXPECTATION  I mean every dish on the table of 6 I tasted and blown away on the flavor, the cooks have been there for over 10 years each and the passion shows Great job!  The waitress was great The evening manager was awesome Mr Jaime from PV.... Thank you for the hospitality and amazing desserts  we will be back and very soon SO IF YOU WANT AMAZING DISHES WITH AMAZING FLAVOR GO TO RAY AND I 10 LET JAIME KNOW JOHN FROM PV sent you You might get a free dessert... Might  lol"}
{"text":"So, like, this was freakin' fantastic. We came here for a friend's birthday on a weeknight, and I don't know if it was because it was slower or the server was just this good, but he gave some of the best service I've ever had.  The food was so.delicious.  We had appetizers, a main course and the adorable little dessert shooters that are absolutely perfect for the person who doesn't want a full dessert, but still wants a little somethin' somethin'.  Love, love, love."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in awhile, but I did like what I consumed!  It was a crowded night full of people!  That's always a good sign to me!  The service we received really was great - quick and attentive.  My water was refilled frequently, which is always a nice thing.  Especially in this hot summer heat!  You do get a basket of sliced bread wrapped in a napkin.  Their bread was fresh and warm and was really tasty with the oil and balsamic vinegarette.  I ordered the lobster ravioli.   The chunks of lobster really impressed me because I could actually taste the lobster!  It balanced really nicely with the cheese and pasta and sauce.  The sauce was delicious and flavorful.   Portion size was good enough for me.  Our other pasta dish was a little on the smaller portion size (especially for a man), which was surprising to me for an Italian type of place.  But I guess you don't want to be rolling out of a restaurant regretting all the carbs you packed on that belly!"}
{"text":"This is basically for Happy Hour. Be careful. Asked for Scotch \"on the rocks\". Was charged more money. Was told to ask for scotch on ice. I Guess rocks cost more than ice. The world is changing."}
{"text":"YUMMY! The pasta was very well done. The shrimp were larger than I expected and blended well with the cheese sauce. Definitely better than Olive Garden any day of the year."}
{"text":"Cody did an excellent job of taking great care of us!  He was very attentive and checked on us often. The food was made to perfection. We love coming here!"}
{"text":"My husband had brought us here last week Friday but, it was a mad house. 45 minutes to wait for a table, hungry child, & still jet lag from the night before. We tried to order take out but, even that we couldn't get through. So we opt out of dinner and left. Today, however we came in early before the mad rush was seated promptly, they had some specials running which made it even more reasonable to dine in. Our server was on it, very alert, attended our needs even without asking, and he was soo polite. We eventually saw how the restaurant started picking up and getting busy. We were very happy to know we got in early, had great customer service, and the food was very very tasty!"}
{"text":"Some family members were in AZ for the week and on their last night we had a large group meet for dinner at this Carraba's. My boyfriend, Sister, and myself were the first to arrive and told the hostess we would have a group of 8 and she sat us at a large table in the bar section. We had a lot of room because the area was pretty empty, but the table was very high and the chairs we so awkward to move because they were all squeezed in next to the others, plus no space at all for purses so I had to put mine on the ground under my feet, sad face!   I was smiling when I saw it was still happy hour and all drinks were half off. After a vodka cran with lime I was ready to check out the menu. There were a few apps also half off so we ordered some bacon onion flatbread to munch on while we waited for the rest of our party. Time passed and everyone arrived, but not our flatbread. Our friends and family ordered some calamari, and another flatbread. A few minutes later their calamari came out, still no flatbread! I asked and finally another waitress came out carrying it. It was decent, nothing amazing. I ate more of the calamari.   After looking through the menu I decided on some type of chicken spinach stuffed pasta. Our waiter brought out some very heavy bread to dip in olive oil and herbs. I was eagerly waiting the main courses to come out, and about fifteen minutes later a woman came out calling my dishes name, I was ready for a plate to be placed on the table but instead I saw her empty handed.   She informed me they were out of my dishes ingredients and they would not have another delivery of them for some time. This tells me two things, one they probably order this dish frozen and reheat it in the kitchen because how can a restaurant not have pasta shells, chicken, and spinach to throw together? Those are total staples. And two, our waiter was not on his A-game because it had been over FIFTEEN minutes since we ordered and he couldn't come out sooner to let me know?   So then I had to quickly scan the menu and to be honest nothing else sounded even close to what I felt like eating so I just went with some combo of lasagna and chicken parm. Not only would I be waiting longer but I filled up on breads and drinks. When my dish finally did come out I tried two bites, the lasagna was overpowered with ricotta and totally turned me off. The chicken parm was alright, the breading was burnt black in some parts and the chicken was bland.   The next time I saw our waiter I asked for a box and one of their after dinner boozy coffee drinks and asked him to not charge it to the bill in return for them not having what I originally ordered. He looked surprised and said he had heard about someone not getting what they ordered but didn't know it was me and apologized and said he would see what he could do about comping my drink. I don't know if that ended up happening because I wasn't the one paying the bill, but I was disappointed in their confusion.  The coffee drink helped me leave in a better mood but not enough to make me want to return."}
{"text":"I came in only because I receieved a gift card. Boy was I pleasantly surprised!    Food was delish as was my sparkling wine. Server was nice.  Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"An old favorite   I haven't been in a couple years I was happy to be greeted and seated quickly  The menu had some old favorites and some new items The drinks were quickly served and so were the apps. The shrimp scampi was delicious and with plenty of bread Salads fresh and cold The porkchops are still good and big enough to share  My meatball app was small but tasty. I didn't want to share  The pasta was cooked just right  Pizza for the kids Overall it was a good experience. We will put it back on our list of go to places"}
{"text":"Very poor service. One meal was brought out ~20 min before the other two. The manager explained that there was a medical emergency on the other side of the restaurant, which we sympathized with. But her explanation was lackluster, overly defensive, and did not explain why the medical issue affected the kitchen and our waitress. We weren't impressed."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this location for years and always considered it 4 to 5 stars. The last several times have not been up to their normal standard. The last time I ordered spaghetti with meat sauce which has been an all time favorite. It was served with absolutely no meat sauce. When I brought this to the attention of the server he brought me a small serving dish that could not have been more than four tablespoons about ten minutes later. VERY DISAPPOINTING!!!"}
{"text":"I go here three times a week.   The service is airways excellent and the proprietor Serik really cares about his patrons.   The food is good Italian,  much better than u have found at the Olive Garden.   The bartenders are all incredibly friendly and they have a fantastic happy hour."}
{"text":"I am usually not a fan of chain restaurants, but Carrabba's is pretty good. I went here with a group of about 18 people for a birthday celebration. Italian restaurants are usually pretty good with large groups, so I am glad we went here. They start off the meal with some complimentary bread, which was piping hot, and some olive oil with spices to dip in. I had the calamari for an appetizer, and it was quite delicious... just the right amount of crunch! For my main meal, I had the manicotti. I thought it had a little too much cheese in it, but my cheese loving boyfriend thought it was perfect. I also had a couple of glasses of their house cabernet sauvignon, which was surprisingly delicious. All in all, I had a good experience here and the food was good. I will go back again if someone else picks it for a group gathering, but I wouldn't pick it for date night."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I just moved to NC and we ordered here 2 times already. We ordered the Rotini Pasta and onion and bacon flatbread and a sausage and lentil soup. The pasta was amazing and the best part they delivered and it was affordable. The pizza beacon onion flatbread thing was pretty good too. My bf and puppy loved it. I don't really eat onions but I tried a small bite and it was very very good. And the soup was also really really cute."}
{"text":"Marissa was our server and she was very good. We had a small issue with a steak but it was handled flawlessly by management. They have affordable happy hour specials. Overall very good experience. We will be back"}
{"text":"Always have a great time here. Service is great and attentive. The food is delicious and delivered promptly. I love the appetizer of the shrimp scampi and the pollo rosa Maria for the entre. I recently tried their limoncello bread pudding and it was wonderful."}
{"text":"We have been steady customers here for 2 decades or so, since the 1990's.  Carrabba's has excellent tasting food, but their portions have really shrunk over the years, and they have raised their prices a good amount.  Especially lately.  My lobster ravioli was not filling, and I noticed that the plate and portions have been reduced.  Ditto my daughter's chicken and cavatappi.  In months and especially years past, I would feel full, and have some food leftover to box and take home.  Not anymore.  I just don't feel this place offers good value as of late.  This is becoming endemic across the chain food industry in general.  They're also getting real cheap when it comes to 'conveniently' leaving out olives in my salad, which has happened twice in a row!  It was laughable and bad enough when over the years, they went from putting lots of olives in my salad to providing exactly 2!  And their $10.49 and $11.99 prices for sangria is beyond ridiculous!  I'll be taking my business elsewhere more often than not."}
{"text":"We frequent Carrabbas's Often. Never had a bad meal. The service is always fast, the entree always moist and perfectly cooked. The entire staff always welcoming. We enjoy the Restaurant and even when they change up the menu! Keep up the excellent work!"}
{"text":"Food is sooo good, service is friendly, portions are a little small. Desserts are huge...Edward was one of the best servers I've ever had."}
{"text":"Consistenly great food."}
{"text":"I had such an amazing experience here last night! Ashley C. was our server. She went above and beyond to accommodate our every need! I was blown away, she deserves a raise to say the least! We ordered two bruschetta appetizers to start off with, then we had the vinaigrette salad and fettuccine Alfredo pasta. It was great Italian food, nothing too spicy and everything cooked to perfection. We will definitely be coming back and requesting Ashley!"}
{"text":"We have been going here for several years now. They go above and beyond to make dishes no longer on the menu, and make every customer feel valued. I ordered my dish wrong and the owner insisted on remaking the dish even though it was my mistake. Always fresh ingredients and minestrone consistently divine! Definitely a regular for our family! Thank you Carrabas!"}
{"text":"Busy Friday night, but seated quickly. Beverage choice was brought out speedily and my server, Jorge, was fast, efficient and friendly. I had the Caramelized onion and bacon flatbread as my appetizer. Very nice combination of sweet and savory. Minestrone soup was well seasoned and full of vegetables. Chicken  picatta was wonderfully cooked and seasoned perfectly. Sautéed vegetables were spot on. I had to take the Cherry Cheesecake to go, but later that same night it was a perfect ending to a truly great meal! I am a BIG fan and will definitely become a regular here."}
{"text":"I was always a fan of Carrabba's, but lately the food is so disappointing.  Much much to salty, and I love salt.  The food has been over cooked and not properly cooked either.  The wait staff has been great, too bad the kitchen cannot keep up."}
{"text":"Came here with a couple of friends while in Vegas. A bit far away from the strip, but well worth the drive. Great Italian food for a decent price. One of the best things here is their bread and the olive oil herb dip. The portions are large and tasty."}
{"text":"the last two recent visits to this restaurant has been very poor in service,,the servers we had were not motivated we didn't tip them that's how bad they were,,servers always complain about not making tips,,you have to earn them,,,as far as the food it was very good.."}
{"text":"The restaurant has a nice atmosphere and the service is good.  I had the Chicken Marsala.  I would really suggest not grilling the chicken breast for this dish, since the grilled flavor of the chicken competes with the sauce.  I notice the grilled chicken breast was a bit tough on the outside of it.  The breast needed to be cut thinner and pan-cooked.  I would have liked the sauce to taste more 'Marsala' than it was.  My husband had the lasagna.  It was  very good.  The Minestrone soup was also good.  Will visit again for special occasion and would try something else."}
{"text":"Reviews should start SERVICE.  As a bartender, I hate bad service.  Never got his name.  Reading the drink menu he ripped it out of my hands, \"you don't need that!\"  What I can't afford your cocktails?  Almost left.  Gave me a dinner menu and ignored me for 10 mins. (Still ordered cause I have never been.)  runner brought salad, manager brought dinner, and he said not one word to me except \"dessert\" before slamming the check.  He talked to the other two couples at the bar-guess a guy in a hoodie isn't worth his \"time.\"   Food was GREAT.. like GREAT : Scallops/shrimp/salad/bread -- unfortunately this establishment lost a 2 times/month guest for life."}
{"text":"Popular place among locals. Chain restaurant, but I like it better than the olive garden"}
{"text":"Everything was delicious,  bruschett, regular and Ceasars salad, warm bread, spaghetti  and meatballs,  plus grilled chicken. More than we could possibly eat. Our server, John, was excellent.  Can hardly wait to go again to try something new. Going to sign up for a dine rewards card."}
{"text":"We were in late last week with 4 adults and 5 children. Michael R. took excellent care of us. He was attentive without being intrusive and did a great job getting our order correct (we had a few special requests). Even as we were one of the last tables to leave,  he never made us feel rushed and was very welcoming. The food is always consistently good! That paired with excellent service and a sparkling apple sangria made it a perfect dinner! Thank you for the hospitality"}
{"text":"Four of us came here for dinner. We started with the mussels in some tasty garlic sauce. I really don't like mussels but these were tasty enough for even me.  I ordered the salmon on the regular menu. It was delicious with a nice dill taste. It was definitely a win! I split my plate with John B. who ordered the Chicken Bryan. I LOVE the Chicken Bryan with the goat cheese on top. Yummm. So good! I've had the Chicken Bryan before, and it just melts in your mouth! Of course, I love the cheese melted into the top, leaving the chicken moist and tender underneath. I typically won't order chicken in a restaurant and rarely cook it at home, but this entree, I would order in a heartbeat! Yes, I ordered the salmon this trip, but only on condition that I was getting half of the chicken from the hubby!   Our waiter was excellent and even left us the garlic sauce from our appetizer, so we could dip more bread into it (long after the mussels were gone).  A great place for dinner! Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"So happy we stumbled upon this place! Our server, Bruce was extremely friendly and welcoming. He gave us the rundown and introduced us to the very extensive menu.   I had the Chicken Marsala - SUPER juicy and tender meat, I was not expecting that. Mom had the Clam Linguine - Super generous amounts of seafood. Tons of muscles and scallops! Boyfriend had the spaghetti and meatballs - you can pay an additional fee for an italian sausage. We opted not to get it, but they threw it in accidentally!   When Bruce saw the sausage that was thrown in, he immediately looked at our order that he initially wrote down and apologized for the extra, why apologize! I was very pleased to see that he was willing to owe up to a mistake if he did make one.  Overall, it was an extremely extremely pleasant experience and I will definitely return. The only downside to this place, they haven't extended to California yet!!"}
{"text":"Do not go to this specific location !!! We went hear for a birthday, had a party of 9 and were stuck there for hours because we has an old waiter that Totally had no business being a waiter ! Took him an hour to just get us drinks !! Then another hour to order our food. We could not find him half the time !! We were calling other waiters to tell them that he has not returned to our table for at least 30 mins !!!! The kids were so hungry by this point we had to order their food first and tell him to put that order in then come back to refill drinks and order the rest of our food !! Finally after 3 1/2 hours we got our food and had to call him back at least 5 times to get us items we ordered like salad and appetizers that he forgot to bring us. No manager around . We left without even get 2 appetizers ! He had so much fun cracking jokes he forgot what he was even doing there . And my daughters fettuccine had a long grey hair in it !! Do not eat here if you want good service and dinner in less then 3 1/2 hours !"}
{"text":"Oh no,,never again.  W Charleston Las Vegas location SUCKS.  Poor quality, disinterested employees obnoxious management. The eggplant Parmesan is always like SOUP..portions are fairly small but with that kind of worthless food, who needs a larger portion?  I never had a decent dinner there and I've tried..I live across the street so it would be nice to have a nice Italian restaurant nearby but they aren't WORTH a dime."}
{"text":"#1 rated italian chain restaurant in consumer reports, so had to give it a try.  appetizers were good, though a little on the salty side.  nice crisp cold italian salad.  my entree was the pasta wessie, which is \"shrimp sauteed in a garlic, lemon butter, white wine sauce with sauteed mushrooms and scallions, served over fettucini alfredo\".  was pretty good, but could only finish 3/4's of it.  any time i have fettucini alfredo, it gets too rich for me.  good prices too."}
{"text":"First time trying out  Carrabba's. Very pleasant environment everyone was very friendly. The food was delicious. I have to say that Justin the waitress was pretty awesome, he took care of all our needs. I have to say I was very impressed on how my daughters kids meal pizza came out first. Never fun having a hungry/inpatient kid in the table. The manger on shift took his time to acknowledge our first time visit. Everyone made us feel welcome. Thank you for everyone that took their time to do so. Definitely will be coming back and spreading the word about the experience we had dinning in. Keep up the awesome work, definitely doesn't go unnoticed."}
{"text":"This was a family favorite of ours for years. Now, we will not be visiting the huntersville location again. Higher prices, smaller portions, horrible service, and the food.. well not what it used to be. Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"While visiting family out here in Henderson, NV. I had a chance to sample some of the local chains. Now I know Carrabba's is nation wide, and one of my favorite places to go in Tampa, but this one was a bit ... different.   The service we had, provided by Kaitlyn, was -amazing-! She was more than attentive, made sure that we were all having a good time and went that extra mile to make sure that everyone's food was perfect, to make sure that everyone was satisfied. I'm used to waiters being blase about their jobs, but she certainly was very content and happy with what she was doing,  Beyond that, the food was standard fare for the place, everything was fresh, everything was served quickly and there were no gaffes.  If I were here frequently, I would be a regular!"}
{"text":"I've had mixed experiences here. I ordered take-out for dinner at 6:00 and was told they were out of mussels. At 6:00? They open at 4:00. Lame. So I ordered the antipasti plate. Meh. Not really what I wanted. Very salty. I also ordered two entree caesar salads with salmon. The salmon was cooked nicely-not dry at all. But the amount of lettuce they gave me was ridiculous. I came home and dumped the lettuce from my salad into a small cereal bowl. It just barely filled it--a small cereal bowl. Lettuce is cheap--why so stingy? I think they gave me the same size lettuce container they give as a side salad for meals. Seriously? I could have ordered a full meal and gotten the same size salad to go with it for barely more money. I do really like their caesar dressing, though. So, yeah, mixed feelings. Don't know if I'll be back."}
{"text":"This place, hands down, beats Olive Garden by a long shot. Great food and great atmosphere. It's always a gamble whether you get a good server or not when eating at places. So if you eat here, ASK FOR LEONARD! He was very friendly, our drinks were never empty, and he will do his best to make your experience a great one. He's a guarantee to make sure you have a great experience. So with great food, a great server, and a great atmosphere, this place deserves the 5 stars."}
{"text":"I am giving one star for Zach the waiter and one star for Heather the Manager..... I eat gluten free due to my health issues.  I went here specifically because they cater to the GF crowd.  That being said after the time I had I am rather worried because if they are as GF cautious as they are about HOW they cook: Meh, not so confident!!!  I started out with a side salad with their house Creamy Parmesan dressing.  The dressing was quite tasty but the salad was less than fresh.  It was plentiful with carrots, thinly sliced celery and some other items but the romaine lettuce was extremely brown and had that taste which told me:  I AM NOT FRESH!  Honestly, it was so brown I just told him to take it away.  He suggested I try soup instead so I had him bring me some lentil soup which was really very good.  It made up for the salad.  My Iced Tea was good as well.   The hubs got a Magharita Pizza which he said was very good.  The basil and tomato were very fresh and good but there was not much mozz on it at all.  The dough was perfectly done.  This restaurant prides itself on being a \"from scratch kitchen\" and they encourage changes to menu items if needed.  That being the case, I ordered the Pollo Rosa Maria, which is grilled chicken breast stuffed with Fontina and Prosciutto, with mushrooms in a lemon butter sauce.  I didn't want the lemon butter sauce so they were going to replace it with the Marsala wine sauce...this was Zach's suggestion, by the way!  Upon getting my entree, which was two very small breasts, it was in the butter lemon and not marsala sauce.  I sent it back............and what came back?  My same chicken breast, which now tasted like a very lemony chicken breast which also had marsala on it.  If you've had either of these versions the one thing you would note is:  They taste horrible together!  It sucked.  So I told Zach that they had just given me back the original breast with new sauce and he said:  Well, it would take too long to remake the whole thing so he just put it back on the grill to grill off the lemon sauce and then replaced it with the Marsala.  WHAT???  Really??  Um, I just said FINE. and told the hubs we will NEVER be back.  The next thing I know, Heather, a manager is stopping by the table.  She says, \"I hear things aren't going well today....\" and I then told her our story.  She then states that not only has she taken my entree off the bill but she is making me the corrected version to go and giving us a gift certificate to come back and give them another try.  Well, I am impressed a bit by this.  Taking it off the bill was nice but adding the additional two \"gives\" made it almost okay.  It's too bad they just couldn't have made it a five star experience the first time....but given that they were so generous, I'll at least give them the chance to do it right.  To be continued.............."}
{"text":"Ahwatukee and Chandler can not have enough Italian restaurants.  That was sarcasm.  So when this one gets four stars its the sign of a good thing.  Items I really like: Appetizers: (my favorite part to any meal) Fried zucchini - thinly sliced and lightly friend with a great dipping sauce. Fried calamari - fresh and again lightly breaded and fried. Must have the spicy pepper and lemon butter sauce.  Must.  Entree's Spiedino Di Mare: Scallops and shrimp are perfectly cooked. Chicken Marsala - wonderful mushrooms and sauce.  I enjoy both their vinegrette and creamy Italian for the salad starter.  I recommend the lenti and sausage soup should you feel like something warm andn spicy.  Very yummy in your tummy.  They are a \"scratch\" kitchen as they call it, which means they can accommodate any food dislikes or allergies.  It's kind of dark in the dinning area but comfortable."}
{"text":"A mid-priced really good pasta joint would make a fortune in this neighborhood.  We decided to go out for dinner.  The fam wanted pasta.  OK, Tutti Santi and Nick's are good but too pricey, and I've been afraid of whatever they're calling Pasta Pomodoro these days since they changed hands.  Guiseppe's still doesn't get it that people with kids never, ever have cash on them.  Lots of pizza places, but we don't want pizza.  Someone reminded me about Carrabba's, so off we went.  For a weekday night it was busy, but they found a table big enough for the 5 of us.  It was super noisy.  Had to yell to be heard.  How can one eat a decent meal while yelling and being yelled at?  Service was alright, though a bit slow.  I'm pretty sure the waitress was sick because she was doing the sniffling thing and I overheard her co-workers asking if she was ok.  Not cool.    The wine by the glass list had some good choices.  They give you the option of a glass or glass and 1/2, so of course we did the 1 1/2, and were happy with what we ordered.  Entrees come with soup or salad, and both were very good.  My sister got the lentil with sausage soup, which reignited some serious sibling rivalry after I tasted it.  There was a shortage of simple pasta dishes for me - just too many ingredients trying too hard.  The pasta and sauces all tasted fresh, and were well made.  However, some of the overthought sauces were over seasoned and so were left half-eaten.   I'd pick Carrabba's over Olive Garden any day, but still have my fingers crossed some smart local chef opens up a simple but good pasta joint in the area."}
{"text":"First visit. Bad first impression. Wood fire grill gives off a nice dust like layer of soot you can just barely feel on too of your table when you first sit down.  So onto the food. Had the chicken bacon flatbread for an app. It was a little over cooked a burned on the edges but was actually still pretty good. Jen loves balsamic glaze which was drizzled on top. She ordered for an entree the pork tenderloin with a prosciutto wrap and a side of cork screw pasta. I tasted it and it was good but it didn't blow me away. Jen likes it but also didn't blow her away. I had the chicken trio which was three probably 3oz chicken breasts; one Marsala, one chicken Bryan, and chicken Maria rosa (which was awesome next time I will order it as an entree).  Service was really good. Drinks never hit bottom but for maybe a second before the waiter swapped our glass out for a fresh one. Appetizer to salads to entree were times almost perfectly. Not so Americanized like OG. WE WILL BE BACK."}
{"text":"As an updated review after 3 years, I would like to say my experience at Carrabba's was fantastic when we dined in tonight. Cody was our server and he took such good care of us. We had paper stuck in our prosciutto wrapped asparagus and after we let him know just for future precaution to maybe let the kitchen know, he went ahead and took full responsibility and took the food right off the bill for us! He constantly checked up on us with water, food, and bread, never having to look or wait for him. We had a couple of separate requests asking for balsamic vinegar, extra plates, parmesan cheese and he did it with no hesitation. As a restaurant worker myself, I know how frustrating it gets but he did a phenomenal job, and I'm glad I was able to bring my family who's visiting out of the country for the holidays! They had a great time. Although my previous experiences weren't so bright, I am glad to say I will be back again after tonight, and will be asking for Cody!"}
{"text":"For a chain/box restaurant this place is way over priced.  Second, I had the minestrone soup and it tasted like it was a second rate canned soup, I sent it back and was still charged for it.  Third, they ran out of children's menu's?????  Fourth since they had no children's menus we asked \"do you have a kids Alfredo noodle plate?\"  We were told yes and ordered it plain for our child.  They charged $10 for a kids plate.  The service was decent but the staff seemed to do a lot of standing around and the table seemed to always be dirty.  It was over all not a pleasant experience and we will not be revisiting them."}
{"text":"Very good service, great food reasonable prices, yummy!!! Cooked to perfection. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"My husband and children have been coming here for years. We even ate here tonight for a triple date we went on. We've always loved the atmosphere and the food is always amazing. Their deserts are the best! The chicken Marsala is one of our favorites and I like their sangria a lot!"}
{"text":"The chicken Marsala and Tag Pic Pac are so delicious I find myself craving yet another visit to Carrabbas. The shot glasses with the deserts are small and just the right size to not feel guilty for cheating on your diet!"}
{"text":"After having been told by my cousin and neighbors how good this place was, I finally visited with my family last Saturday night.  It was delicious.  The bread is to die for along with the pasta side that comes with the meat meals.  Very good.  I will never go to Olive Garden again."}
{"text":"We used to love Carrabba's.  We used to come to this location once a week.  Last time we were here, we were served raw chicken.  After waiting a year we decided to try again. Horrible.  We were sat in a pretty empty restaurant at 2:00 on a Sunday.  They sat a table beside us and took their order before us after waiting for at least 10 minutes.  Finally they took our order.  The people beside us got their food and left before we even were served our food.  When our food was served, it was cold. My husband ordered his without mushrooms and they said would he be able to just pick them out!  We sent back our food to get new hot food.  The food was just reheated. The plate was to hot to touch. I asked about them reheating it, they said they don't have microwaves.  Obviously it was heated with the plate IN something.  Manager came over to deliver the sauce and she was so fake and did not even apologize.  The service was way below par.  She acted like we were an inconvenience to be sitting in her section. Not one apology from anyone in this restaurant.  We were offered a dessert for our troubles, still with no apology.  We stated that we were full and didn't want dessert and could they just please take some money off the bill.  The took $6 off our bill.  The desserts range $6-$9.  What a freaking insult.   The server Mallory was rude and not friendly at all.  I do not recommend this restaurant to anyone.  I hope upper management sees this and sees what is becoming of their restaurant."}
{"text":"I love Italian food, and this was my first time at a Carrabbas.  I came here with a friend of mine after shopping at Ikea, and I really enjoyed my experience here.  I really liked my experience here. The staff was friendly throughout, from the hostess, to the waiter, and everyone else we interacted here.  Menu had a lot of different options, with a full wine and alcohol menu to a variety of different dishes.  The server told us about the different things on the menu, as we both had a few questions about different dishes that we both saw.  We were also informed that they make their pasta fresh daily, which I thought was awesome.  The bread plate with the oil was Delicious.  We ate 2 baskets worth!  I went with the spaghetti with meat sauce, and a sprite.  I wasn't drinking since I had to drive home, but my friend did get 2 beers while we were there.  My friend went with the meatless spaghetti, and both our dishes were awesome.  We passed on desert since we were both so full afterwards.  I would gladly return in the future, as I had a really good time here."}
{"text":"It was good but nothing great. One of my daughters really likes this place so I took her for her birthday and it was good but there are better choices for the same or less money. I just wasn't wowed or impressed. I will have to try more dishes. My daughter likes the shrimp and scallop linguine. The sauce was good but the shrimp were overcooked. The atmosphere is nice and the service was very good. Bread was also good."}
{"text":"This review is long over due. My wife and I have been eating at this Carrabba's for at least 12 years and have never had a meal that was anything but excellent! The same goes for the service! We have always received excellent service and tonight was no exception. Our server tonight was Alexander, and he clearly has had good training and has top notch customer service skills.   If you have never tried the chicken trio, I highly recommend it! This is my \"go to\" dish on the menu. You can't go wrong with pretty much anything though. I've tried quite a few things on the menu and never been disappointed."}
{"text":"wow! i can't believe i've passed this place so many times without trying it. a friend brought me here a couple days ago and i definitely will return!   we started off with their bread and olive oil with herbs. i couldnt stop eating it until we got our appetizer.. we started off with the crab cakes. packed with actual crab chunkies that made me go mmmmm the entire time i had these babies in my mouth.   next.. i had the caeser salad. it wasnt spectaular but it was fresh and the dressing wasnt overly tangy.. yanno what i mean! i   had the mezzaluna pasta. ravioli stuffed with chickena nd ricotta cheese in a tomato cream sauce. great portion! i couldnt even finish half. maybe cuz i stuff myself with their bread. i dont think i ever stopped eating the bread.lol.. my friend had the pollo rosa maria. chicken breasts stuffed with cheese in a lemon butter sauce. i didnt try but she comes here so often she knows whats good.   finished off with a john cole.blue bell vanilla ice cream with caramel sauce with roasted cinnamon rum pecans. now..i normally dont like pecans.. like.. at all. but these were tasty!   our server was very professional and always had our drinks full. he even noticed my friend putting her lemon slice from her iced tea to the side from the first refills so the 3rd one came and.. no lemon slice! usually they dont notice and she ends up having almost a whole lemon on the table..lol.   so... if you're craving italian... skip olive garden and come to carrabba's! they put their breadsticks to shame!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite Italian food in town. We eat here ALL the time, it is amazing, never had a bad dish, amazing bread and good service."}
{"text":"I've been a huge fan of Carrabba's since my first visit over 10 years ago. I moved to the Bay Area of California over a year ago and we do not have Carrabba's. So I decided to take a \"quick\" 8 hour drive to visit Las Vegas and finally eat at Carrabba's again.  I have to say this location is one of the best. Faith, the general manager is incredible. She went above and beyond to make us feel right at home. Danielle, our waitress, was very polite, happy and never once seemed bothered by my special requests. I'm very picky how my food is prepared. :) Vegas has some great places to eat and this is one of them."}
{"text":"Bread is the corner stone of this place. Amazing!!! We love the lintle and minestrone soup with the chicken Cesar salad. The chicken tastes amazing. Great place and atmosphere for the price. Expect to wait 30 -40 mins on fri and sat night."}
{"text":"We had a fantastic experience! I booked a call ahead for +15 people for my husbands birthday and the service was impeccable. The staff was fast and friendly. The food was fantastic as always and we had a great time. Thank you so much for a great experience"}
{"text":"Delicious on our last visit, again.  Chicken Parmesan is my favorite here along with the best blackberry sangria in town. Large enough to share with my daughter or son.  Shrimp scampi appettizer scrumptious blend of buttery garlic sauce with toasted bread.  Italian food here has more seasoning than traditional Italian making it better choice for us.  Mamas Sicilian chicken soup is perfect with lots of chicken meat in it, great for the chilly weather."}
{"text":"For an Italian chain restaurant, this place is wonderful!  (Or maybe, I'm just not that high-brow)  I love Carrabba's food and this location is very nice.  I have never had any problems when dining here and I do love to come here fairly regularly.  This place kills Olive Garden for both being chains restaurants.  Yes, it is a fair bit more expensive though.  I love love the bread with the herbs and olive oil they serve here.  And my number one entree that literally beckons me back is the Spiedino Di Mare.  The way they cook the scallops is superb and the size of the scallops is very impressive for a place like this.  Just thinking of this dish makes my mouth water.   They have good drinks too and the salads are fresh and crisp with interesting variations on dressings compared to other places I have eaten.    Is this a mom and pop, hole in the wall Italian place?  No, but it is definitely one of my favorite chain restaurants and close to home."}
{"text":"The best mussel appetizer I have ever eaten. We make a point of going to Carrabba's every time we visit Sun City."}
{"text":"This was my second time at this Carrabba's location & just like the first time, I had a great night enjoying delicious dinner! My faves are the wood-fired Italian wings (not spicy at all but the flavor is YUMMY), the tomato caprese (decent serving size and a great appetizer) and the Chicken Bryan (comes with a side and a soup or salad; the chicken is tender, juicy and sooo flavorful). We also ordered the wood grilled tilapia with a side of brocolli, and the Sicilian chicken soup. The tilapia was good and the soup was a great way to start my entree.   The only reason I deducted a star was for the service. For a Friday night, they didn't seem busy at all. But it still took our server 10 mins to greet ya and take our drinks. By that point, we were ready to order our food. The rest of the night went smoothly tho, and our server was attentive to us.   Overall, I'd come back here again!"}
{"text":"Went for a friends birthday and had an unpleasant experience overall. One of the members of the party asked to have the birthday girls entree put on her check at the very beginning of the meal and that did not happen despite the staff telling her it would be taken care of. The entree I ordered arrived lukewarm as did my friends who sat across from me. We asked for checks for the table and it took about 10-15 minutes to get the checks out only to find out all the bills were missing drinks and all the checks had to be taken back so they could be calculated properly. Another 15 minutes went by and we had to ask twice to get the checks sent over to our table only to find out that the checks were wrong again with an additional drink on the check. We sent the checks back and got them third time after another 10 minutes only to have the same errors on the check again. The fourth check I got was handed to me and the waiter walked off without taking my card so I walked it up to the staff myself. I have never had a restaurant take over half an hour and four separate attempts to get a check correct. This took over half an hour at this point and one of parties had not even received their check while another had given their card with their check to the staff only to have it returned with the card not run for the charge. My friend sitting next to me had her drink and her entree on two separate checks. There were children falling asleep at the table at this point as it was past closing time and some of the party members had already left due to this taking so long only to discover that their checks they had paid for were still not correct. Several items were still not included on the correct checks and multiple members ended up paying for other peoples food just so we could just get out of there. The manager at no point came over to apologize or do anything to try and rectify the situation which I found highly unprofessional. I understand that things can get hectic and I do not expect staff to be at my beck and call, but to have this ordeal taking up the better part of an hour and have the manager walk around us multiple times serving other tables with absolutely no attempt to address the situation at hand, let alone do anything about it, was astoundingly incompetent and frankly just rude.   Would not recommend going if you have more than 3 people in your party as it doesn't seem like the management is capable of directing their staff to handle more than that."}
{"text":"Chicken marsala and pomegranate martini was amazing! The bread and olive oil with herbs is amazing as well! The staff is so friendly and the food is amazing!"}
{"text":"I have lived in Henderson for the past 5 years and drove by Carrabbas a number of times without ever thinking of going in.  We don't really hit up the Italian very much as it's pretty filling and we try to keep it pretty healthy.  My in-laws were in town for my daughter's 1st birthday and for some reason we decided to go here.    I was very impressed by how good it was.  I was expecting Olive Garden type food (which is fine if you're from a small town and are looking for a place to take a Prom date) but got something much better!  First off, the bread they serve was very delicious and they set down some olive oil with garlic chunks in it.  Who doesn't love some garlic??  The server was on top of it, very polite, and did a great job of checking on us before we ordered.  I'm not a fan of the places that leave you stting there.  My wife and I shared a Spaghetti dish and then I proceeded to eat off of everyone else's plates (after they offered, of course).  Everything I had was made very well.  My mother-in-law's Lasagna, sister-in-law's steak, and father-in-laws fettucine.  All very simple dishes but all done nicely.  This is a great place to take casual Italian food eaters, like ourselves.  They also threw in some free mac n' cheese for my daughter!"}
{"text":"Been going there over25 years. Still my favorite. Have never been disappointed. (Huntersville)"}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday lunch celebration and reserved a table for a big group of people. Great atmosphere, lots of space, and very good service from the staff! The prices were decent as well.   So, I gotta say- the food was fantastic! Even the table bread with the olive oil dipping stuff was great lol I ended up ordering the chicken Bryan and it was so delicious! Covered in melted goat cheese and sun dried tomatoes with a lemon sauce. I never finish my entire dish but I ate every last bite of this! I couldn't stop haha Also a side of green beans with some cooked onions on top.   Had zero complaints about this place and I highly recommend stopping in here to eat!"}
{"text":"I am very impressed with the selection on the menu for dinner at Carrabba's 's Italian Grill in Surprise Arizona.  I have gone back twice now and I'm always pleased with the service. The food is to my liking and the temperature of the food is always perfect.  The restaurant is clean and the aesthetic's are comfortable. It is nice to sit in a restaurant where even when it is full of people you're not having to scream across the table for your family or companions to hear you.  I have asked for a few changes to my orders and pleasantly I was accommodated. Service is quick, but NOT so fast that before you are half way done the check is set down at your table. I am in love with the bread basket and the delicious oil and herb dipping plate."}
{"text":"My 14 year old daughter had never eaten at Carrabba's so we went to this location in Huntersville. I know Carrabba's is a chain but you would never know that stepping inside. It is warm and welcoming like a good neighbor. Our server was wonderful and Greg the proprietor/ manger checked on us often and even sent us dessert since it was our first time there. My daughter had the steak and grilled asparagus and she cleaned her plate it was delish!!  I had the stuffed mushrooms and they were wonderful.  We will be back. Great job guys"}
{"text":"Eaten here twice, most recently this past weekend. They are consistently average. Be warned, the linguini with white clam sauce is made with heavy cream. This is NOT New York style, in fact it's not even Italian. Using cream in Linguini alla Vognole is an Americanized version of this dish, mainly in the midwest, but something our young waiter tried to pass off as \"pure Italian\" and it took the chef coming out front to confirm he was wrong. Lesson learned, do not order this dish anymore. Overall the pasta each time was overcooked (it was mushy, not al dente). The sauces were just OK, not that flavorful. My wife had lobster ravioli was was also \"just ok\". It's a safe place to eat with predictable, mediocre quality; nothing to knock your socks off. Avoid the Linguini with white clams if you're looking for Italian food."}
{"text":"I used too come here all the time..but it has since lost it's appeal. After trying it tonight I am a little disappointed. The prices are really high now! $18 just for a pasta dish seems a little steep and it's nothing special.  The Lentil soup is great!! I could just eat that for dinner, I wouldn't pay for the pasta again and the portion was small. That's saying alot from me, I get full pretty quick. I don't think I would go back anytime soon."}
{"text":"This is an excellent restaurant. The food is freshly prepared and made to order so whoever said it tasted prepackaged is incorrect- sorry! I ordered a cup of Mama Mandola's Sicilian Chicken Soup, a side of Caesar salad and a side of garlic mashed potatoes. Super fresh and the bread and service was phenomenal! You could just taste the fresh veggies and seasonings aldente pasta and tender chicken in the soup it was absolutely amazing."}
{"text":"Excellent food, great wait service in the restaurant BUT need a new bartender - man around mid 50s no eye contact a sangria was 90% ice filled only 1/2 small wine glass.  Lazy dog gives you a large glass same price that lasts mor then the 3 sips you get here.  My suggestion don't order anything from the bar if you are waiting for a table"}
{"text":"Use this restaurant for business meetings.  Great food & friendly staff!  Every week the food is delicious, especially the chicken marsala with mushrooms.  YUM"}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of the Carrabba's since watching them (Johnny & Uncle Damian) on their PBS cooking show so when we finally got one in Concord...I've been hooked since then.  I've honestly never had a bad experience, meal or dessert at Carrabba's. If you like flavorful food at a pretty reasonable price, try Carrabba's. I love their Chicken Bryon that is topped with goat cheese and sun dried tomatoes and the lemon butter sauce is spot on."}
{"text":"I don't know what I expected. I went against my better judgement.  I let my guard down and said, hey, let's go to carrabbas. Sure it's a chain restaurant but what the worst that can happen? Service? Very attentive. I asked the server what was good. Chicken Brian she said. Bring it on I said. The results? The chicken  with Plops of the goat chees to mask the otherwise bland chicken and cold chewy pasta. My wife tried the shrimp and rassoto. 5 lonely shrimp stuck in a quicksand rassoto. Just not good.  I was hoping for the best and got the worst."}
{"text":"New updates done to the restaurant, beautiful.   New menu, sucks! Took away on of the very best appetizers EVER!  Linguini and clam sauce during Lent was awesome, it was TERRIBLE last night. So fishy.  Bring back the shrimp app!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The kids really loved the spaghetti from the kid menu. I had the half moon ravioli stuffed with chicken n spinach topped with tomato cream paste. It was pretty good it didn't have an authentic taste or any bang to it but still good. My boyfriend had the grilled chicken and that's pretty much all it was grilled chicken nothing special. Service was good."}
{"text":"Worst run restaurant I've seen in a very long time! Was a Sunday evening and we opted for a Sunday meal out. Carrabba's has been our go to for delicious chicken soup, so we were excited to go. However, it didn't take long for our excitement to fizzle and quite frankly burn OUT. At 5:30 pm, there was a pretty hefty wait. The hostess claimed the computer system was down so she couldn't confirm how long the wait was - but it turned into over an hour. Why, you ask??? Not because it was truly a big crowd - we watched as tables sat dirty. (We counted more than 12 empty at any given point in time). When we sat down there were more people waiting AND there was over 10 tables cleared and ready but the hostess wouldn't seat them. There were many moments that people were gathered by the expo area doing nothing while tables sat. They were just chatting & having a good ol' time. The manager came to our table after we expressed concern to our waiter and we were met with defense - \"quality of service is more important\" and I'll be honest, our waiter was very kind and very apologetic, our service was hardly wow-worthy. The food was mediocre at best and it was a huge let down. We can say for certain that we will choose ANY OTHER Carrabba's over this one if we choose to go to this brand again. We watched so many people get angry and frustrated and many of us talked about the poor operations as we waited for our turn to be sat. Get it together folks - too many choices exist today. Choice is in the power of the customer these days -- mediocre simply wont do."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. And even though we had a very long wait, the manager came by and apologized as well as gave us free desert and an appetizer coupon. You can't change the fact that things go wrong sometimes but you can make up for it in a very gracious and professional way. This is exactly what they did tonight. We were very pleased and taken care of."}
{"text":"I got the vodka sauce shrimp and scallops dish. It was ok I guess. I wouldn't order it again honestly it wasn't my cup of tea or taste. I like the waiter he was nice just a little slow on my drinks and getting my billing. Nice birthday to have there. It's family friendly and the good is a bit pricey but I enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Great place to eat.  Service is wonderful . Went here. For anniversary and manager paid for our desert"}
{"text":"Worst branch. Food cold, serve unattentive, and bathrooms were unclean.  The steak is not good quality comes out tough and stringy.  Would recommend going somewhere else."}
{"text":"This place is just OK.  Heavy flavors, etc.  There is pork in the meatballs, which is not mentioned on the menu.  We have been there twice for happy hour.  It's only worth it because you get appetizers for 1/2 off, drinks/beer are 1/2 off, and house wines are 33% off.  The 1/2-priced appetizers are only available in the bar area.  I wouldn't go there for the full-price menu."}
{"text":"Horribly rude hostess to begin with..... We went to seat ourselves at the bar, and she came up raised her voice saying she can only sit us and to go back in front and wait.  There was not a crowd or wait, the place was over half empty!!!! Then our waiter who was CLUELESS brought our drinks, the overly-salted shrimp diablo and the fishy smelling mussels. Totally forgot our soups, he never apologized either so we paid our bill and went to BRIO where the service and food blows this shameful place away!"}
{"text":"Gluten-Free/Allergy sensitive  This is one of my faves! Great menu with lots of GF choices and dessert too! They do not balk at any allergy requests and seem happy to do so.  I always get the mussels appetizer, the soup (no pasta), and the chicken marsala.It is so big I always have lunch for the next day."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge chain restaurant fan. I avoid them like the plague, but I bit the bullet and went to Carraba's and was pleasantly surprised. We had the 3 course feast thing. It was a great value and very tasty, but the best thing about the meal was Jordan our waiter. He was so friendly am extremely knowledgable. All in all, a nice experience."}
{"text":"Caraba's grill was excellent experience the  pork-chos were cooked to perfection and the service was great."}
{"text":"Fast service, lentil and spicy italian sausage soup was yummy. Main course was Salmon , scallops and shrimp \"The Damian\", sauces were great not heavy and seafood cooked just right ."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here tonight for a belated Valentines day dinner. It's in a nice location. We were seated at a booth. You can see the kitchen preparing the food. We ordered the shortrib flatbread as an appetizer. It came out and it was a nice crusty piece of flatbread with lil bits of meat and carmelized onions on it, very tasty. The server also brought out a basket of warm bread with a side of oil and herbs. That was good as well. My boyfriend ordered a large 9 ounce blackberry sangria. I didn't think it was that large when it came out especially for the price of $12, however it tasted really good and sweet. More like juice than sangria though. After we ate our appetizer we ordered our meals. I ordered the Seafood Cannelloni with a chicken soup. My boyfriend ordered Lobster ravioli with a ceasar salad. When the soup came out I realized I wasn't in the mood for soup so I swapped with my boyfriend. My boyfriend thought the soup was a little too salty. The caesar salad was delicious although I personally think iceberg lettuce should be banned in restaraunt salads. It is nutritionally void. our entrees came out after we finished our soup and salad. The server added lots of cheese on top, Yum. My dish was delicious with good chunks of seafood in it and I tasted my boyfriends lobster ravioli and that was good too. We ate half our food and took the rest in a to go box. I enjoyed my meal at Carrabbas."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  I can't believe I haven't written a review for Carrabba's yet.  Yes, we live nearby, so they are convenient option for a weeknight dinner.  I really like their order-ahead option, but when we eat inside, we prefer to sit at the pasta bar.  I think the main dining room is a bit dark, and I really like the liveliness of the pasta bar.  Our service has always been great, no matter where we've sat.   They change their menu frequently, so unfortunately, some of my favorites (like their fabulous clam and linguini) have disappeared.  But there's always something good to replace my prior favorite.  I generally go with a creamy seafood pasta dish.  The fettuccini weesie is also very good, and I've noticed their shrimp are larger now, too.  My husband's go-to dish, spaghetti bolognese with meatballs, is always available, and very good.  It's nice to start your meal with their bread and salad.  I love their Caesar salad (you can taste the anchovy paste!), while my husband usually goes for one of the vinaigrette varieties.  And their bread is always served piping hot, with a delicious garlic dipping sauce.    With their Dine Rewards program, you get credit each time you dine at Carrabba's, with discounts on future visits.  I'm on their email list, and their specials always bring us back in.  While it's a chain, they are (in my opinion) much better than their next door sister chain, Outback."}
{"text":"Been going to this location for years with my wife for dinners with family and special occasions (anniverary/birthday etc.). Always enjoy it and have menu faves that are tasty, well prepared and reasonable for good quality food. Love the bread dip! They always accommodate my low salt request and servers are well trained and personable."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Carrabba's in both the Huntersville and Concord dozens of times.  I gave them 3 stars for a specific experience at the Huntersville location on 04/19/15.  Carrabba's would have got a 5 based on all my visits if not for a snotty host on that particular night.  I called ahead for a party of 8 with two highchairs for 6 pm for a birthday celebration at 5 pm.  We arrived right on time and informed the host that our party was actually just 6 with two highchairs.  After twenty minutes of waiting, my sister went to the podium and asked how much longer the wait would be.  The nasty host said well you're party of 8 requires a special table and we only have two.  We can't ask them to leave even though they are done.  My sister reminded him that our party number had changed.  He said well I don't know.  15 more minutes with an attitude.  Forty minutes later, I went up to the host to find out why we were waiting for a table when we called ahead an hour ago.  Again he tried to say something about needing one of those two tables.  I informed him AGAIN of the changed party size.  He was clearly agitated with all of the guests who kept questioning their wait times.  He actually shook his head, wiped his brow, squeezed his temples and sighed we are short staffed tonight and heaved his breath at me.  I asked if we could be seated in a smaller table.  Thank goodness the manager on duty happened to be coming by the host stand for the first time in the hour we were waiting and I asked him about the smaller table.  We waited for about five more minutes and finally got a seat.  He did offer us two appetizers on the house for our wait time.  Our waiter, Taylor, was EXCELLENT.  He was 5 stars all the way.  The host, which I don't know his name, but could pick him out from a line up for his crappy attitude was a NEGATIVE 5.  Luckily we have had good experiences in the past so we will give Carrabba's another shot.  However, we'll stick to the Concord location!"}
{"text":"I generally try to avoid chain restaurants, but every once in a while you have a friend that wants to go out to eat, suggests a chain, and you don't have the heart to turn them down, or negate their selection. Sigh.   That being said, Carrabas in Chandler wasn't half bad. The service was stellar from the moment we walked in the door. EVERYONE greeted us, inquired about our experience, and saluted us on the way out. I don't know if it is like this at all locations, but I was impressed. Moreover, our server had great timing, was very friendly and helpful, and kept my iced tea filled.   The food is still chain food. It was pretty good, but chain food all the same. I ordered the Rustica pizza (if you read my post on LGO, you'll know how much I adore pizza). It had a lovely presentation, with large slices of eggplant and colorful peppers. It had a slight spicy kick to it, which I enjoyed, but was underwhelming on the whole.  The pizza was a bit oily, the crust did not have personality (I'm sure you know what I mean by that), and neither the cheese nor the sausage were particularly special. It was an average pizza. My date, who has dined here frequently, really enjoys the fillet with asparagus and it seemed to be cooked to order.   One thing that really bothers me about many chain restaurants is the recent trend to serve desserts in shot glasses. You pick your favorite flavor from a selection of 8 or 10. Three bites later, dessert is done. Excuse me, but custard covered with a little Ready Whip does not count as dessert! It is the same at every restaurant, and I find it very unimaginative and unappealing. Call me a snob, but if I'm going to order dessert at a restaurant, I want it to be a true dessert.   Overall, if being strong-armed into a chain restaurant, Carrabas is a good choice with decent food and an excellent staff."}
{"text":"We sit at the bar when we come here and always get treated like royalty!   The Managers always greet us and give us a free treat. Love this place."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my experience here.  The server Holly was very friendly and enthusiastic about the menu and how good it was and I totally agree with her.  We started with the sampler appetizer (calamari, bruchetta, and mozz sticks)  VERY yummy.  We had the salad with creamy parmesean dressing which was nice and light. I had the sausage and lentil soup which was a bigger portion then I had anticipated and very very good (I would definitely order it again).    We had the cheese filled mezzaluna and I had the seafood cannaloni.  Both were great dishes and lots of seafood filled in mine.  We finished with home made tiramisu which was a nice large piece, well worth the money.  We had a great evening, very nice menu selection. Prices were fair for the most part (maybe slightly high but who isn't now a days)    I would DEFINITELY go back very soon."}
{"text":"Carrabbas is our families favorite restaurant.   The food is amazing and the staff is even better!  They are friendly, on the ball and courteous.     We do dine in, but we use carside pick up more often due to our busy schedules.   They are awesome!  They know us, they know our orders, on the rare occasion there has been a problem with the order (due to the website order not going through) they always take care of us!"}
{"text":"I've been to this Carraba's at least 4 times. I took my Mother to it back in 1998 and the food was great. The calamari appetizer is the best I've ever eaten. I've had calamari at about 15 different restaurants and Carraba's is still the best. The warm bread with olive oil and spices is also very tasty. I usually get Chicken Carbonaro. with pasta. The food is usually excellent. I don't think I've ever had a bad meal there. I haven't been back to this restaurant in about 5 years, so I don't know if the quality is still the same. I see a lot of people complaining. Due to the recession, it's possible that the food may not be as good today. It was still great 5 years ago however. I would definitely go back and eat there again. I had proposed to my wife at Carraba's in Scottsdale and the food was great there as well."}
{"text":"Extremely oily and heavy. This food will make you want to curl up on a ball and go to sleep though it is rather tastey. Just don't go on a first date and certainly avoid this place if you plan on doing anything except hitting the couch hard."}
{"text":"Carrabba's has been my favorite restaurant in Huntersville for many years, however I am not able to say that anymore. It seems that each time my husband and I go there lately it is getting more weird and the service is getting worse. It was so bad tonight that the manager offered and paid for our entire meal which is the reason I am not giving a one star rating. The food was good, however not fabulous like it used to be. The restaurant was practically empty at 9:20pm when we arrived, yet they had so much staff that was just standing around doing absolutely nothing other than talking to each other and playing on their cell phones. A very friendly waitress came over to our table, she was smiling and ask us what we wanted to drink. A few minutes later this older waitress comes over and tells us that she will be taking care of us. My husband told her that we needed a few more minutes. She said okay and she would return soon. Well.... we never saw her again. After about 15 min. we still didn't have our bread. Finally the first girl that greeted us came back over. I told her that we still didn't have our bread because she didn't notice. She said, \"I don't know what is going on tonight.\" I really believe that she was trying to provide good service but something just felt really strange there tonight. It is not the Carrabba's that it once was that is for sure. She then said that she would get the manager. He came over to our table and said that the entire check is on him. He didn't have to do that but it was definitely appreciated. The manager was fine and tried to make things better, as did the waitress and this was so appreciated. What I noticed and what is disturbing is the fact that these two bus boys kept using the sweeper right by us without apology and it was annoying when me and my husband were trying to have an enjoyable dinner. As they kept cleaning  one was telling the other why he was fired from his last job. As I looked around so many staff members were playing on their smart phones. I am saddened because I expected the Carrabba's experience to be special like it was years ago."}
{"text":"This is the dirtiest Carrabba's I've ever seen! Absolutely unacceptable...garbage on the floor, hand prints all over the glass...I walked in and felt like I was as Denny's on the wrong side of the tracks! Needless to say we left immediately! Shame on this location for bringing down the quality of such a fantastic restaurant!"}
{"text":"My husband and I absolutely love this place. We always have great service and delicious food. I tried a couple new things tonight. One was the pomegranate martini which was absolutely delicious (I had to order another ) and second was the Italian chicken lettuce wraps. Both were so amazing I would order them every time I come here.  Ashlee A was our server and she was perfect. We always had full drinks including our kids and she made our experience so easy! When you have two kids under 3 all you want is easy! She was on top of everything never had to ask anthing! She anticipates needs better then I have ever seen and my husband and I eat out at least 5 times a week! Thank you Ashlee for being so amazing and great at what you do!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour menu + prices.  Good fare,  friendly service, casual atmosphere.  That all adds up to a pretty decent place to come and have dinner."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this carrabas location. Not only is it close to where I live but the service here almost every time is just wonderful (with the exception of one time). Anyways, the main reason I'm writing this review is because our waiter was just absolutely incredible and he deserves recognition even though it's past over due. The first time I had ever gone was a few months ago. My boyfriend brought me and although I don't remember our waiters name, I won't forget the service he provided for us. We first got there and when we decided to skip on the soup or salad before our main course he made it a point to push our order ahead so we wouldn't have to wait too long. He kept checking back on us and had such a vibrant and upbeat personality. So warm and not forced at all. Not even a full 20 minutes after taking our order our food was already coming out fresh and super hot! And I mean SUPER!!!! HOT!!!! Like steaming and the plates were still very hot to the touch. Anyone who knows me knows this is exactly how I like my food to be when I go out to eat. That's just my personal preference but again it shows he really cared about getting us served in a timely manner with the food still being fresh and hot. After we boxed up what we didn't finish (btw the portions here are very generous so that offsets the price for the food. It's A LOT!) he told us he had a surprise for us. When he came back, he had a free dessert on the house because he heard it was our anniversary date night. He said they had to sing happy birthday for us so that we could get a free dessert. I was a little bit embarrassed when they started singing but it was all worth it because their chocolate dream cake is just to die for. So delicious. Our waiter never made us feel rushed and always made sure we were okay. I definitely would recommend this Carrabas."}
{"text":"Three point six seven nine stars.  I have some gift cards from Carrabba's and I must say that even though I am fairly anti-chain and pro-independent...Carrabba's ain't half bad.  As a matter of fact it's better than half good.  The service here was outstanding and the food was well beyond just ok - better than I was expecting from a chain.  We ordered several things to share amongst the family - spaghetti with meatballs, chicken caeser salad, mozzarella sticks.  I particularly enjoyed the chicken caesar salad.  I still prefer independents but Carrabba's is a safe chain apparently.  I think."}
{"text":"Very good food, AMAZING bread herbs. Service was phenomenal and very friendly. Great restaurant."}
{"text":"My wife begged me to give this place a second try. Unfortunately, it was a worse experience than the first time we had gone. They basically charge high-end prices for Olive Garden-like food (and the portions are way smaller than those of the Olive Garden.) I am in no way pushing the Olive Garden - I'm just trying to find a restaurant with equivalent food to compare this place to. I give them a star for atmosphere, and a star for presentation, but their \"taste vs. cost\" is a little insulting. Sorry.  I would go back if they had 2 for 1 dinners."}
{"text":"Nice little spot. We've been here a few times. They have a new special which is amazing. One plate served my son and I . We orders the new trio and it was very good. Pretty quiet"}
{"text":"From a chain Italian restaurant you can't usually expect much, but Carrabba's does very well.  Some of the friendliest service we have experienced at a chain restaurant. Very accommodating with special requests, and with the staff that we have had on our visits we can tell that they enjoy having people in their restaurant.  The oil olive served with the bread is amazing with the cracked spices (you can buy the spice mix to take home!). I remember the calamari being nice and crisp but not too greasy, and the other items in the appetizer combo were very tasty (I enjoyed the Bruschetta quite a bit). One of the entrees we ordered was a chicken dinner and it was cooked very well.  I do remember one thing on our visit very well; the Tiramisu. Although initially I was not hit with the boldness of liquor, after dinner I felt the alcohol more than any other Tiramisu I have had. I love a strong Tiramisu, and this one met that in addition to being rich, creamy, and sized just right for two people to share.  Lots to try on the menu, very friendly staff, super accommodating with regards to dietary needs, and fair priced food make Carrabba's a good choice for a reliable Italian restaurant in a casual setting."}
{"text":"Mediocre...quite disappointing. We typically do get take out for dinner but it's a Friday night and I don't like the long waits for a table. I may reconsider and wait next time. Obviously by the lasagna photos it wasn't looking like a good start. One was actual lasagna the other was the remainder of the bottom of the pan. My husband said it was like mush. He let me have the \"good\" one. My daughter had the wood grilled chicken she said it was good. The dessert was chocolate dream but was a nightmare... It was hard and tasted stale. Which is odd because I thought they made them daily? We eat at Carrabbas four times a month at least and this was probably the most disappointing... I hope that this was not the norm for getting take out because it leaves a bad impression about the restaurant which I know is better than what I experienced tonight."}
{"text":"Another great meal at Carrabba's. You have to try the Chicken Bryan....it's delicious! Ashley is a wonderful part of the Carrabba team!"}
{"text":"The food is rich and delicious; the servers are kind and attentive; and management concerns themselves with even the most tenuous details, ensuring a great dining experience.    I was greeted by a manager after my meal and received an invitation to attend a wine tasting as they saw I was enjoying my Cabernet (my 3rd glass). She was welcoming and hospitable, not surprising given how much our waiter John was as well.   Given how exquisite my experience was, I will be back. Maybe I'm snobby, idk, but honestly I've never been to a place like it before. If I had to be critical about anything... I heard the same song played twice?"}
{"text":"Portions keep getting smaller... menu keeps changing... go-to meals no longer on the menu... have to ask for bread... oil no longer on tables for dipping. I've been a loyal customer for over ten years and will never go back. Corporate changes will be the downfall of this restaurant/chain.   Two chicken breasts (Marsala entrée) are now the same size as one breast before portion sizes got smaller. By the way, the price didn't go down. Mozzarella marinara no longer on the menu!!! What?!?!? Replaced with a mozzarella/ricotta fried ball that is not very appetizing.   Your changes have driven this loyal customer away."}
{"text":"Carrabba's is one of the better franchise Italian restaurants.  Yea it's a chain, but it kicks the crap out of Olive Garden. Obviously, that's not really saying much. The food is pretty good and I'm a guinea from New York so thats saying something. The service is good too. It's not the best Italian in town, doesn't scream authentic Italian. It's Americanized Italian, just like 90 percent of the country is used to. But for being convenient and cheap it's a good package. The service is always great as well."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for, simply put.  This place is excellent with the service, food, cleanliness & timing.  We ordered a lot of different items (steak, pasta etc) but the best thing we had was the steamed mussels in garlic sauce - it was to die for!  They were so tender they practically melted in my mouth - next time I think I will order 2 bowls of mussels and nothing else!"}
{"text":"The food was just okay some of it was better than others. My problem is it looks like he's hiring his family that really don't know anything about the food service business. I seen one waiter bringing some food put it on some else's table first because he couldn't hold all the plates, then he moved it to the other person's table. This is because the seating Is so close together I can hear the people next to me you chew their food not to mention every conversation they're having. He tried to liven up the place by having a live steel drummer playing which would be nice if he wasn't sitting right on top of me also. If you going to have people sit this close together dim the lights put some candles on the table or remove some of the tables and give me some space!!"}
{"text":"Carrabba's is a restaurant I love for a girls' night out or a family dinner. They have fun drinks and good food. My favorite is the Pollo Rosa Maria. The chicken is stuffed with fontina cheese and covered with mushrooms and a lemon butter sauce. During this visit we tried the small plate special where you had 3 appetizers for $12. The stuffed mushrooms were delicious but looked minuscule in comparison to the menu photograph. To finish off the meal we shared a piece of tiramisu which was huge but was sub par in comparison to competitors. The best part of the evening was our server, Reta. She was prompt, efficient and was kind to my father who talks too much. I had a great experience at Carrabbas!"}
{"text":"We haven't been here in a bit because we moved, but sitting at the bar is always a good experience. The bartenders are always really nice and have all been there for quite some time. The salad with shrimp and scallops is my favorite!"}
{"text":"I will NEVER visit the Concord Mills Carrabba's location ever again! First, the bathroom was filthy with a stench that was unbearable!! The light fixture above our booth was covered with cobwebs and our server was extremely NASTY, rude and unfriendly!!!! The receipt lists the server's name as Bobby P. He was the most unpleasant server I've ever experienced in my life!! He made us feel so uncomfortable. Do not bother patronizing this establishment."}
{"text":"Ok updating my previous review since we were disappointed on the last couple of visits but maybe they have new management because today was great service and I had the Pollo Rosa Maria and it was like it used to be, butterflied open with prosciutto and cheese in the middle -last time it wasn't opened just cheese in sauce on top - and the wine/mushroom sauce.  Server was very nice.  Still not quite 5 stars because a little stingy with the mushrooms compared to the original plate and no olive oil on the table for the bread but the server would go get more when we asked."}
{"text":"Nice change of pace for me, as I usually do Italian somewhere else. We had a wonderful meal...Filet, Green Beans, Mashed Potatoes, Salad, and Super Yummy Bread & Oil. Love those Carbs! Our Medium Filets were done just right. Everything was very nice. The service was good. The only complaint I had was that our mashed potatoes were not very hot. We told our server and she quickly replaced (nuked?) our spuds."}
{"text":"I came here for a large birthday party on a Sunday afternoon.  There were about 20 of us.  When we arrived they already he the table set up nicely.  There were two servers working with our group and they were very nice and accommodative. They were prompt with orders and getting food out, as well as checking up with us.  The food was very tasty.  I ordered linguini with white clam sauce and was happy with my portion and the flavorful.  The clams were tiny, but good.  The price was more than it should've been in my opinion, however. The bread and EVOO and balsamic was delightful.    Overall. Good experience, clean restaurant, nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"The wait staff loves to get Personal with you it's nice that they treat you like family! The food was delicious and the management is awesome :) it was my first time ever going to Carrabba's and it's hands down one of the best Italian restaurants I've been to!"}
{"text":"I had a strange experience on my recent visit. I think they were a little busy at the time. I explained it the manager whom did a superb job at assisting us. I'll be back with my family. This is totally my favorite restaurant. I love the chicken trio!"}
{"text":"Loved the red cinnamon sangria and the mussels! Wait staff were friendly and knowledgeable when asked for suggestions."}
{"text":"I received a gift card so we tried it out for the first time. The call ahead waiting list is a bad idea. It's not a reservation so I couldn't see what good it did to eliminate or shorten our wait. I ordered a steak medium rare and got raw meat. I really don't like eating the sides before the main item and then eating the meat when everyone else is finished. Decided to give it another try tonight. Ordered salmon with lump crab. The salmon was raw and cold in the middle. Again I had to eat the mashed potatoes alone and the salmon didn't come back until we prodded the waiter. No manager visit to the table, no comp, no good. Unfortunately I can't give a good rating and we won't eat here again."}
{"text":"The chicken Bryan is one of my favorite dishes in the whole city. I think it is absolutely incredible. The food servers are always amazing there  with a great attitude and friendly. I can't give them a 5 star because their red sauce is definitely lacking."}
{"text":"The good, the bad, and maybe the ugly. Food and service was very good   .China, our server  did a fine job of serving,  etc.  the taste of the food was up to  good standards. Now the bad, it is 50 degrees outside, and in the restaurant it was no more than 65 degrees. Not comfortable even with a jacket.  My hands usually are warm, but they were cold throughout the meal.  I spoke to staff about it. Nothing much was done.  At the end the manager said they could not raise the temperature.  That seems like a bunch of  nonsense..  I may have stayed for dessert, but it was  just too chilly."}
{"text":"The place is nice and has a busy live kitchen, the service was really good, and the food was delicious.  We'll return next time we're in West Phoenix, and wish they had one here in California.  CRUSTY BREAD and HERB-OLIVE OIL DIPPING SAUCE Yum.  ITALIAN LETTUCE WRAPS (chicken, veggies, lemon vinaigrette, romaine lettuce)  were good, but you only get three.  BRUSCHETTE SICILIANI was good.  Loved the red onion.  Not a fan of the olives, but they were big enough to pick out.  Appetizers were lowered priced before 7pm (Saturday).  TUSCAN STRAWBERRY SALAD (chicken, mixed greens, strawberries, pine nuts, red onion, tomatoes and crumbled gorgonzola) was good, even though it's girly, and eating it made me get my period."}
{"text":"The food is delicious. We had a very nice waiter, Justin. He totally forgot the appetizer we ordered! We didn't mention it as we had plenty of the delicious bread. Our first visit was a small disaster so we wanted to try again. Not sure we will return soon as we love to eat out and write reviews, and you have to stand out. Eating outside this time of year was superb! Give it a try, write a review!"}
{"text":"I really can't say too many things other than it's not a bad place for a quick bite. The food for me was not overly impressive and was a bit bland. I got the chicken alfredo never had it with peas in it and I am not a fan of peas. There were a lot of peas. I am not one for sending food back so I dealt with it. We got cocktails before hand and bar service was good. Table service however was a bit slow and we had to wait on drink refills. (y'all know i don't like this). I will say stuffed mushrooms were pretty good. Doubt we will return. It is an average spot at best."}
{"text":"I have a professor that raves about Carrabba's every chance she gets, so I decided to give it a try. My husband and I had a great time! We had the calamari which was delicious and we loved the bread with the dipping oil. This place is just up the street from us, so we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Full plate full of Rigatoni Campagnola topped with a goat cheese that I mixed into the sauce. Very rich flavor and very tasty."}
{"text":"First time visiting a Carraba's and I am sad it has taken me so long to stop in! The food was very flavorful,  loved the stuffed mushroom app and chicken marsala. We had a chocolate  dream dessert that was ahhmazing!! Our server, Ron, couldn't have been better. Thank you for making our visit a great one!"}
{"text":"Got takeout for lunch. The new online ordering app worked seamlessly. I ordered Chicken Marsala with cavatappi ameritriciana, which was delicious. The lunch portion cost less than dinner, but doesn't include soup or salad. You can add those for $2. The waiter came out as soon as I pulled up. He was very friendly. My food was ready. This was a good experience. No complaints."}
{"text":"On Valentines day I put my PICK UP order in at 7:30 pm. I was told it was a 40 minute wait. Knowing it's a busy holiday I gave them and extra 20 minutes. All I got was 2 spaghetti dinners and a pizza. Instead of having common courtesy and calling me to tell me my food wouldn't be ready at that time I go there and was told my food isn't ready and they won't know how much longer it's going to be. So 2 hours later a get a burnt pepperoni  pizza, chicken fetacchini that was SUPPOSE to have mushrooms and peas with 2 slices of chicken and pasta with a plum tomato sauce covered in pepper. It was barely enough food to feed my 3 year old daughter.  They did give me my meal for free because if I had to pay $60 for that I would've refused it. Very disappointed in service food and simpler consideration of not picking up a phone to make me aware of the situation!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here twice. Both times, the restaurant looked pretty worn out and aged, but we didn't mind. From the midwest, and everything is old as hell there. However, both times after being sat, we got up and left: the reason being cleanliness. Spaghetti noodles and penne everywhere on the old carpet, chairs strewn about and blocking aisles. It kind of looked like a Chuck E Cheese. Once was bad, but twice? Pass.  Wouldn't have been a big deal, but I work in the restaurant business. If you have a dirty front of house, the back is usually much worse. Hard to recommend trying Carrabba's with prices similar to Maggiano's, which is 10x nicer, right across Bell."}
{"text":"We went in with a party of 12.  When we called the day before we were told they don't accept reservations, but they would make an exception for us.  This is not a good policy for a large group like this, but they did have a large long table set aside for us and we had two servers to wait on us. The service was great.   Everyone was very happy with the food.  We requested separate checks and our request was handled efficiently, including asking for coupons and if anyone was sharing the bill.  Most of us took home leftovers. We would go back if we could be sure we can get reservations in advance for large groups"}
{"text":"I didn't have any trouble here with the food.  The food was good.  Staff was friendly.  Didn't have to wait to be seated.  Easy parking.  The only issue was the bathroom.  I went into one of the stalls and the locking mechanism was broken and the door would not shut at all.  I think the restaurant should have this fixed."}
{"text":"Good food and deserts. Incredibly friendly an upbeat staff. Our first visit the owner dropped by our table to chat. Definitely recommend this place. Have a glass of sambucca."}
{"text":"This place has good food and the service is fast. What else would expect from a Carrabas? So I would definitely recommend it to anyone nearby."}
{"text":"We made a dinner reservation for this restaurant for a birthday and were accomodated on the phone.  When we arrived, we were told our table would be ready shortly.  However, we spent the next 50 minutes waiting for our table, which was completely unacceptable.  We talked to the manager, who stated at that point that they did not take reservations!  There must be a lack of communication between the manager and whoever is answering the phone.  In addition, they were pretty dishonest about how long it would be for us to get seated.  If they had simply told us when we arrived that the wait was going to be an hour, I wouldn't have been as upset.  The fact that they kept dangling the carrot that our table would be \"ready shortly\" for most of an hour was just incredibly frustrating.  We eventually left for better prospects, what a terrible way to start off the evening..."}
{"text":"I brought in a coupon and they refused to accept it, they said it was fake.  I even showed the Manager I printed it off from their corporate website.  He still ignored me.  What a jerk.  The portion sizes for lunch are far too small and overpriced. This place needs work when it comes to the whole customer experience.  The decor is nice, but looks only go so far."}
{"text":"the best the best the best  love eating here  not only for Italian but its my favorite for steak!!  get the sirloin or fillet marsella  the best as well as the pollo rosa marie (chicken) to die for  everything is good here and great service!!!  I go at least once a month...."}
{"text":"Can't say the food is good or bad. The service was so terrible, I waited and didn't even get to eat. Gave up and went to another nearby establishment."}
{"text":"So much hating on Carrabbas - I don't get it ! I guess I should start with the fact that I don't come here for \"Italian\" food (or what I consider Italian anyways). The pastas are disappointing - they are clearly processed chain garbage. I'm all about the wood grill plates! This place gets major points in my book for all the degrees of customization offered. Small or large sized? 4 choices of salad? 3 choices of side!? I'm in heaven.   The chicken bryan (grilled chicken topped with goat cheese & sundried tomatoes in a lemon garlic butter sauce) is a MUST for me ! Their caesar salad is awesome, but honestly all 4 of their salad offerings are great. I love that you can choose veggies, potatoes, OR any pasta as a side. Last night's veggie was a delicious sauteed spinach with beautiful fresh cloves of garlic. YUM.  So yeah, I wouldn't pit this against any actual Italian places in town - but for grilled chicken dressed up and done right it's my staple!"}
{"text":"I went here on Sunday (8/3), and I've forgotten the waitress's name, but she was a young blonde girl. Anyway, I had a fantastic time at this restaurant.  Waitress - I think she was the best waitress I've ever had, so I really wish I remembered her name! Incredibly polite, really funny and charming, returned to check on us multiple times, brought out new waters without having to be asked, etc.  Anyway, on to the food. The bread and olive oil she brought out at the beginning was good. Nothing spectacular, but certainly good. I ordered a caprese appetizer, and while it was smaller than I was anticipating, it was delicious, delicious, delicious. They used some of the best basil I've ever tasted. For my salad I chose the \"creamy parmasan\" dressing, which was really disappointing. It had an almost fishy aftertaste, which I wasn't expecting, so next time I would choose something different. And then for dinner I ordered the \"tag pic pac.\" It was also really good. The portions were really generous for that, and I had some leftovers to take home.  Five stars for service, four stars for food. I'm rounding down to 4 stars, rather than up to 5 stars, however, because our table was kind of dirty when we were seated."}
{"text":"Food and service was really awesome! Our server, Kathia was friendly and very courteous. Definitely someplace to visit again!"}
{"text":"Yum...just yum.  The service is good and the food is awesome.  I have been to many locations around the country but only into this location twice.  What that means is that I can say that they are meeting those high expectations at this location.  We came here for a surprise birthday and the staff was very helpful with that.  Oh, and the food is yum."}
{"text":"Tried it twice, not a fan.  Wanted to like it?  I know Olive Garden is down the street and can produce a quailty product.  If I compared the two I have to go with Olive Garden, quality salad, bread, service.  Stiff competition around here, if the service was there and the food quality was better it could maybe be as good as the Olive Garden."}
{"text":"Food typically very good.   Sometimes have to wait a while but employees do well keeping crowds moving.  Monday night to-go deals sometimes a nice change to home cooking."}
{"text":"My hubby & I love Carrabba's. This is probably our favorite Italian restaurant. We went on a Sunday around 430 & we were seated right away without any wait. I don't remember our servers name but he rocked!! He was on it, let me tell you. I never had to ask for a refill on my drink, he was bringing us fresh drinks before we even finished the first one. He brought us bread & olive oil over as soon as we were seated & replenished our basket when it was empty. Our meals were delicious as always. Restaurant was super clean. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I took my teen daughter out for a late dinner to spoil her a little bit. She had fettuccine Alfredo with sautéed mushrooms, I had chicken Parmesan. Both were fantastic! Best chicken I've had at an Italian restaurant in quite a while. Minestrone was delicious, the salad that came with my daughter's meal was very nice. I loved that it wasn't just iceberg lettuce with a few tomatoes. It was a little heavy on the onions though. My daughter also ordered the \"Chocolate Dream\". My one bite, turned into four lol! It was amazing and not too sweet. Restaurant and restroom were clean, staff was very friendly and helpful. A little on the pricey side, but worth it in my opinion. We had a great time. Michael was our server. I'll be asking to sit in his section next time we go back. :)"}
{"text":"I haven't been to this location before but I love the food so I decided to treat myself for Mother's Day lunch.  I'm so glad I did. I was greeted by the most amazing waiter.  He was so attentive and believe me next time I go here I'll ask for him. Thanks Robbie. Now to the food and drinks. I ordered a glass of strawberry sangria. This was new on the menu and was suggested by my fabulous waiter.  Delicious!!! I'd been craving lasagna and I'm a huge fan of Carrabas lasagna.  It too was so very good. On a whim decided to have dessert too. Ordered the mini cannoli's. They were delicious. What a great lunch I had and even though I dined alone Robbie made sure to make me feel I wasn't alone. A+ on food and service."}
{"text":"Great food, great staff, very nice atmosphere, and reasonably priced. This place has been consistently pleasant. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Went last night for my birthday.  Has a wonderful meal as always.  The service was great and they gave me a free appetizer.   Will be going back soon."}
{"text":"Very Good. My Husband had the ravioli stuffed with chicken the other night and it was fantastic. Being Italian myself, I am picky about restaurants that sell Italian food. This dough was delicious, very light and tender not \"doughy\" at all. I had chicken breast stuffed with prosciutto, mushrooms, fontina. It was very good, the prosciutto was a little skimpy but other than that excellent. The server was very friendly and knew her stuff. She knew all the ingredients that went into the dishes I asked about and made recommendations, which I liked. We will be going back for sure. I also loved the smell of the wood burning in the oven!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came tonight to have dinner for our anniversary. There was apparently a chef who was in training who messed up my husband's steak twice! The manager quickly came to us comped our bill and gave us free desserts. As we were finishing up the manager gave us a card  wishing us a happy Anniversary from the staff and had 3 gift cards in the card, one for a meal, one for a free appetizer and a 25 dollar gift certificate. If that is not great customer service I don't know what is. They were great!"}
{"text":"Great food! (The pork chop was awesome!!! And the Bryan chicken is also really really good!) we sat at the bar the food came out really quick.  Over all I am very happy and will return."}
{"text":"I get great service here! I'm staying next door at the Marriott and have been lucky enough to have the same server who helped me order to my tastes. Steak cooked the way I wanted and the sides are delicious.  Carabba's is on my travel radar!"}
{"text":"I like to eat soup whenever I have sinus congestion and Carrabba's Mama Mandola's Sicilian Chicken Soup is one of my favorites. I really love their bread too, though I prefer to use butter with the spices instead of olive oil. To make curbside pickup worthwhile, I also get a pasta dish to eat over the next couple days. Instead of spaghetti, I decided to try the Chicken Positano. It was flippin' delicious! Great meal."}
{"text":"Come here on special occasions and we always have an amazing experience. Wonderful service and great food, with good prices and specials offered. The Chicken Bryan is a firm favorite of ours."}
{"text":"The night was started off on the wrong foot by being told the wait would be between 15-25 minutes then waiting for 57 minutes to be sat. The hostess took us to a table between 2 large prom groups, I asked if we could be moved and a rude hostess told us that we would have to go back into the waiting cue to move even though there was an open booth that was not sat for 10 more minutes. The server Samuel J was wonderful. Between him and the wonderful food it was not a completely horrible experience although I don't belive I will be returning to this location again."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. We arrived around 6:30pm on a Friday. They told the 2 of us it would be a 10 minute wait. So we waited and watched everybody else get seated. After 20 minutes another family of 3 walked in, they asked them if they wanted a table or booth, and then sat them immediately. When I asked what was going on, they said they didn't have anyone on the list. We were the only people sitting in the waiting area. What did they think we were there for?! They claimed they had had some problems with confusing pagers and just must've missed us.   So they say they're sorry and seat us at a small booth in the bar. The table was small and leaning. No asking what preference of table. As we sat there another 5 minutes with no one saying another word to us, we decided to leave. As we walked out, we said we decided to just leave, they simply said \"ok\".   I don't understand that kind of customer service in a restaurant like that. So incredibly disappointed. Writing this review from Outback down the"}
{"text":"Such a great experience from start to finish. Our server Christian was so pleasant, if only all our experiences could be the same. We ordered the fettuccine carraba and rigatoni campagnolo. Large portions and very delicious. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Every time I come to this location, the service is always wonderful and the staff is super friendly!  As a previous server/bartender, it's nice to see people who know how to use their customer service skills to the best of their abilities!  The food of course Is always fantastic, and the managers stop by to check on everything at least once or twice during the meal.  Super professional and will be returning there/telling all of my friends about it!"}
{"text":"One star for the horrible service. I have never had a waitress so neglectful. When she gave use our soups she slamed them down onto the table top and walked away befor we could even ask the graded cheese. I had to stop another employee to help us. Our drinks were pretty much empty the whole time we were their. When ever we asked for lil things like A1 sasue or balsamic vinegar she had attitude. Not onces did she ask if we needed anything or of we liked our food. My boyfriend eat his whole dish and enjoyed it alot. Me on the other had I was so upset I only took one bite of my food. The waitress didint notice. I love carrabbas I come here alot and have never been treated like this. I will never come back to this location agen. I will happily drive and extra 25+ to another location."}
{"text":"Came here with my family for my bf birthday. For our appetizers we got the muscles which were amazing. I ordered their combination meal with Tuscan marsala and the chicken Bryan. I asked for my stake to me cooked Medium but when I got it it was well done. I also got the cavatappi amatriciana as a side and there was berly any sause on it had to ask for more. My server forgot it so when what I assume was a Manger came over I had to ask him. When they brought my stake back it was still over cooked but bye this time I had already lost my appetite so I told him that it was okay. My bf got the tucan filet with spindini. His stake was bloody looked like medium Rare. He also sent his stake back to me cooked more. When the finely brought it back he wasint even hungry any more. Was really disappointing that we wornt able to enjoy our meal together as a family. My mom got the chicken parmesan and she really enjoyed it. Not sure what my mom's bf got but he liked his as well. I ordered there pomegranate Marti and when I finished it my sever never asked if I wanted another one she was really not a atentive to your drinks. My bf asked for water and never got one. The food that was actually cooked right was good. Over all I was disappointed. I expected more from carrabas."}
{"text":"Earlier this evening my boyfriend and his friends came here for an early dinner everything they ordered was good. My boyfriend got my order to go I got the veal chop with marsala sauce in the cavatappi amatriciana. Unfortunately my boyfriend get it look in the to go container and before he left but whatever they put in there was not the real pork chop. I was really looking forward to eating that really disappointed that my order got messed up."}
{"text":"Yes, it's a chain restaurant, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing.  I personally chose this location because I had arrived in Concord late in the day and knew Carrabba's was nearby and offered a gluten free menu.  Knowing that they always have things safe for me to eat is one of the reasons I choose them when traveling.  When I asked for a gluten free menu, the waitress even asked me more about what a gluten free diet is like and why it's sometimes necessary.  I thought it was great that she took the time to ask.  I would up trying the sangria on special (a little sweet, but still good) and chicken Brian.  Everything was cooked perfectly and arrived quickly.  I'd definitely return if in the area."}
{"text":"Tonight, we took the in-laws to Carrabba's for dinner.  My mother-in-law loves this place!  There were 10 of us, but we were seated quickly because it was Monday night and the place was next to empty.    I ordered the Chicken Trio and a Caesar Salad.  The lemon chicken was just so-so, the goat cheese chicken was just okay, but the Chicken Marsala was outstanding, yet again.  While I appreciate that they use organic chicken breasts, I miss the large breasts that I am used to at other venues.  No, not strip clubs!  Get your mind back on the menu!  My daughter ordered Lasagna and she ate it slowly, which means she didn't like it very much.  Her slow eating came to a grinding halt, so I tasted her Lasagna.  It really wasn't that good.  Actually, my wife bakes better Lasagna than this.  I noticed several of those at the table did not eat their garlic mashed potatoes and I wondered why.  How can you screw mashed potatoes up?  Or was it that my in-laws just aren't used to eating them in their native Puerto Rico.  So I grabbed a fork full from an abandoned plate and tasted them.  They were overpoweringly seasoned with black pepper and way too much raw garlic.  Wow.  They were bad.  No wonder there were heaps remaining.  Then I looked at my sister-in-law and niece's plates...they too were half full of uneaten alfredo pasta.  By this time, I was so full that I didn't have room to taste their pasta.  But I was tempted nonetheless.  I asked them how their pasta was, thinking they were simply overcome by a large portion.  Nope!  They both said it tasted bad.  Finally, my mother-in-law said her Beef Brasato dish (you know, the one they're advertising on TV right now) was too heavily seasoned and she didn't finish it.  Since she is getting on a plane to San Juan in the morning, she said I could have her leftovers for lunch.  Not sure if that is a good thing considering the not-so-great-tasting-meal that we just ate.  This is my first disappointing visit to Carrabba's and I must remove one star for the overbearing taste.  Gah!  I also must remove it from my favorite restaurants list too!  This is getting to be a lot of work!  Maybe they were training a new chef?  Nope!  I watched them cook the meal and they all seemed perfectly at ease.  Maybe because it was Monday it was an off night.  I don't know.  My water didn't get refilled until I begged a second time either.  Whatever.  I'll reconsider visiting Carrabba's at this location on a Monday, to be sure."}
{"text":"We had the special which was a new concept and an original since it was my wife and Is first time here.  The pork came out rare and had to send it back after being told by the waiter \"that's how it's prepared\"  under the light it was purple rare.  We got ten dollars off our pitcher of sangria.  At the end of the day the meal was good after it was prepared correctly but also priced very high for what it was.  Cost was around 100 dollars at the restaurant and I made the same meal we had at home, for four, at the cost of 30 bucks"}
{"text":"No.......just no.  Let's cover what was good here, that's quicker.  The caesar salad, and the bread.  That's about it.  Overpriced, nasty marsala sauce covering entire plate.  Kids portions consisting of about 3 oz. of mush noodles.  Did I mention overpriced.  Seated at a table right up near the kitchen line as well, so got to hear all the servers pissing and complaining about their manger, each other, gossip, etc."}
{"text":"Some of my favorites are the chicken parmesan, the chicken Bryan and the five cheese ravioli.  Also, I like that they have small and big portions.  My only complaint is that the tables in the booth are slanted.   Other than that, Carraba's is a good place for good food."}
{"text":"Sure, it is a chain, but I have never had a bad experience here.   The lentil and sausage soup is fantastic, and the pollo rosa maria comes with enough to have leftovers for lunch the next day. Don't forget the fresh bread and olive oil with herbs.  Just be careful not to fill up on it... unless you want extra leftovers the next day  :)"}
{"text":"Saturday night was a not so great birthday for me and my family we had a party of 8  The food wasn't that great and not worth $200 meal we all had the only thing was great was the cheese cake my steak had a sour taste to be a 9 oz Marsala I experienced stomach cramps and many trips to the bathroom after Just making it home to Use the restroom needless to Say we want be having any more Celebrations at this chain"}
{"text":"Traveling in Scottsdale and excited to see a Carrabba's as we frequent the location in Las Vegas.  Greeted and seated immediately...good so far.  Drink order taken while I was away from the table....brought as I was sitting down and wanted to order an appetizer.  The drinks were placed on the table and our server (Lindsey P) started to walk away.  I had to stop her to ask her to put in the appetizer order.   Found out there is a \"new\" menu and when we placed our order......from that new menu, she questioned if what we were ordering was on the menu........turned the menu around so she could see it in writing......I realize it's a \"new\" menu, but it is her job to know it!  One order of chicken marsala with broccoli and one grilled chicken with a side of pasta.....Order is brought out by a manager and it's two marsala.  The manager was great, left the second order so we could start on the pasta side and put in a special order for the grilled chicken.  Server comes by and asks if all is ok.....I tell her that my order was wrong but the manager was taking care of it....she said it was wrong....like I didn't know what I ordered......Chicken comes and is good.  We get the bill and we notice that the appetizer is over-charged by $1.00 and we are still charged for two marsala ($3.50 more).....had to ask her to re-check the bill and all the time got the feeling that WE were being difficult......SURPRISE, she came back and we were given a new total that was $4.50 less......and a sorry about that.....might have well said \"whatever\"......If it weren't for the manager I don't know how that dinner may have turned out.    It's too bad because it was 5:00 pm, and the restaurant was still empty.....no reason for attitude or so many errors.  Can't wait to get back to my Las Vegas location where the customer is treated well!!!"}
{"text":"Updating my review.....if I could give this location and server, Mario more stars I would.  Last year while traveling we saw a Carrabba's and decided we'd eat there.  I was actually embarrassed because I had no idea how to order my dinner.  Our server, Mario at the Las Vegas location knows exactly how I like my salad....old school with vinegrette, so I never have to remember.  I'm sure the server at the Colorado location thought I was some crazy old lady...until I explained how little effort I have to put in when I go to Carrabba's in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"It was pretty busy for a Monday night. However loved the service our waiter was very respectful and had tons of suggestions. The food was fresh no complaints there. Would i come here again? absolutely."}
{"text":"Well, as always, this is through the lens of having to eat gluten free.   I decided to try them as it appeared there were more options on the gf menu than had been there last time I looked.   I called the order in and said I wanted to order from the gf menu. The guy I talked to said there wasn't a gf menu (but there is online) and that most things could be made gf.   I placed my order for 2 pasta dishes which came with salads. I specifically requested no croutons and said I didn't need any bread. Since this is not my first gf rodeo order placement, I wanted to reiterate that I needed it gluten free. And he said, \"Oh, do you want the gf pasta?\"   Sigh.  So, one of the salads had croutons on it and the to go bag had bread in it. Which instantly made me very worried that the pasta was not gf. Since it was a weird shape of pasta I decided to risk it.   Frankly, I was completely underwhelmed. Perhaps the gf pasta sucks up the sauce but for both dishes their was way too little sauce and the sauce for both was quite bland.   I won't go back unless absolutely forced to. I do appreciate the curb side service. I do appreciate that they have they have a gf menu. They definitely need to train their curbside folks to understand the gf menu better."}
{"text":"Good food ,very busy place hard to get a table not a good ambiance"}
{"text":"Most of their food is very good. Great for groups and having a nice dinner. Great ambiance and good seating. They actually have a very good happy hour in the bar area. They have great Marsala and seafood items."}
{"text":"So we ordered on the website and set a timer. We timed me departure perfect and timer went off as I pulled in. Literally waited 4 minutes and got a guest server walk up and ask my name back in he goes and comes back to say they checked all online orders AND FOUND NOTHING! SO THEY rushed my order and would include the 15% off then rushed back in. Only asking if I wanted a free soda. I was not impressed as the manager twirled a gift card in his hand. Odd? Food done and was perfect. SO MUCH Tech to fail at one of our favorite restaurants. Just sad"}
{"text":"We eat here fairly regularly and have never been disappointed. The Chicken Bryan is very good especially with spinach as the veggie. Their steak is tasty and the pasta dishes are done very well. A great place for a nice meal."}
{"text":"My honey and I like Carrabbas alot.  We call ahead and hardly wait, even when the line is out the door.  The food is good, and the service is excellent.  I normally order the soup (chicken noodle or minestrone) and he orders the seafood with angel hair.  For dessert we get in the little glass to keep the calories down.  ;)  I am a people watcher and the staff are dialed in.  They help each other, it is a team environment and it shows.  If you go you will see the manager checking the food in the open kitchen before it goes out and checking in with visitors.  I am always impressed with the service and it keeps us coming back."}
{"text":"Mmmmmmmmmmmmm!  One word says it all. (Supercalifragilisticexpiallidocious)  Seriously, this place is awesome. The food, the drinks and the service are all outstanding.   They have a good-sized parking lot so you should be able to find a spot close to the entrance.  We decided to eat here before going to watch Blade Runner. As we were 30 minutes away, we told them we were coming and then headed up the 51 hoping that we would not run into too much traffic. We arrived at 5:14 for a 5:15 eat time and we were seated immediately.   It's Happy Hour! We lucked out. We wanted wine with our meal and Happy Hour prices gave us $10 off any bottle.  We shared an appetizer, mussels in garlic. Absolutely splendid. The sauce was so good, it needed bread so it could be used as a dipping sauce.  For our entrees we ordered the Chicken Bryan, the Salmon Cetriolini and the Fettuccine Weesie. All were delightfully delicious. With my Chicken Bryan I had the garlic mashed potatoes. Another perfect choice.  By the time we had devoured our food, we wanted dessert but our stomachs were overly satisfied and we decided to save dessert for another day.  You will not be unhappy if you decide to eat here."}
{"text":"Years ago I used to love Carrabba's. Even though it's a chain it was actually pretty damn good and was my go-to spot for Italian. Then something changed with them and no matter which location I go to, I'm disappointed. Went into this one the other night for dinner and ordered the same thing I've always ordered. The bread and soup were both pretty bad, especially the soup (minestrone) which one upon a time was amazing. Now it's watery and has almost no flavor. It's basically a bean and cabbage water soup now. The entree wasn't bad though the portions have shrunk greatly. It was also seemingly impossible to get a clean glass. Our waitress was very nice and tried very hard to replace our consistently gross drinks with fresh ones but apparently it just wasn't happening. It's a shame that a place I once loved is now not even a consideration to me when choosing where to go to dinner."}
{"text":"I have eaten here dozens of times. Only once was the food ever bad and they made it right in a hurry. Service is always excellent and this is really the only place I go for Italian food. I've eaten at a few of the other locations but this one is my favorite. I generally don't review big chains, but I'm happy to make an exception for Carrabbas."}
{"text":"If you have ever been to a Carrabbas then you know that it is pretty consistent. A good place to go with family with a variety from pasta to chicken to steak.   On this visit I had chicken with sundried tomatos spinach and goat cheese. It was tasty but I feel like the piece of chicken was on the smaller side. Added on a Cesar salad that was half brown and half green. Making half of it un able to be eaten.  The reason for the three stars is as far as Italian food goes there are many options and many I prefer more. It was not a bad visit but also wasn't a wow visit."}
{"text":"Very cute space - decor reminded me of Carino's in Fremont, portions are equal to that of Macaroni grill and waiters very friendly!  Bread - fresh baked & came w/ a oil/spice mixture for dipping  Soup/salad - bland, some lettuce & carrots were all we got  Spaghetti w/meatballs - hit the spot esp. when I'm craving comfort foods  Rigatoni Martino - tasty  I love that our meal was not overly salted!  Dessert -rich, decadent (Sogno di Cioccolata) and on the house thanks to the very sweet manager & JT's love of Football :)"}
{"text":"My last visit to Carrabas. First we were greeted by the most unhappy hostess. Next, we asked the bartender if there were any happy hour specials and all he said was they has no good specials. He never told us what they were.  My friend ordered spaghetti with meat sauce and I ordered manicotti. To say his spaghetti needed more sauce was an understatement. We literally counted about four pieces of meat in the entire dish. He had to ask three different people for extra sauce before he actually got any. For $13, I got two tubes of manicotti. I honestly mean this and I'm not trying to disparage the place but I could've bought frozen manicotti and dumped ragu on it and it would have tasted just as good. And $5.35 for a draft Peroni is too much. I think boxed spaghetti with Ragu would've been better than what my friend had. It's a shame because I used to really like this place.  But that will be my last visit. We overheard the waitress at the table next to us tell them they could not order pizza because it was only able to be taken out not eaten in. And if they wanted to order pizza it would take an hour and a half!  They got up and left. I wish we would've also."}
{"text":"So this was my second go-round at Carrabba's by Concord Mills.  I must say that the service was much better than the first time.  Here's to hoping that last time was an isolated incident and won't be a problem in the future.  Once again, they did a top notch job cooking the food.  If I can get over how they look, muscles may be a new favorite!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were given two $25 gift cards for Carrabba's at Christmas, so we finally decided to use them on 3/28/15. It had been awhile since we had visited a Carrabba's, and this visit reminded us why we hadn't made it a priority to return.  This was a moderately busy Saturday night, and we were seated relatively quickly. Our dinner out deteriorated rapidly from that moment. We had already perused the menu in the waiting area, so my wife and I were ready to order right away. When she asked to make a wine taste comparison (common), she was advised that she would have to wait a short while, as they were out of clean wine glasses. I guess Saturday night kinda snuck up on them...took them by surprise.  We both ordered a side salad with our dinners, and these arrived in a timely manner...all good. But, we were not even half-finished with our salads before the entrees arrived. My plate had the wrong order, so it was quickly returned. My wife ordered a chicken breast dish, and her portion was...oh my... miniscule. She's not a large person, so heavy portions are not typically something she demands, but the portion size she received was really ridiculous. The manager would later say to her, \"you must purchase chicken breasts from a different supplier than we do.\" (duh?)  My plate arrived back with the correct order aboard, but the garlic mashed potato serving was barely larger than a tablespoon size portion. When the manager was called to the table by our server, he first wanted to make certain I hadn't eaten any of my potatoes. I assured him I hadn't, and I thought it more than obvious that nothing on the plate had even been touched. He apologized, explaining that they had actually run out of this side dish (so why send it out at all?). He offered to replace the potatoes with another side. I made my selection directly to him, but the replacement side never came. As I finished my meal, he finally returned to the table and offered to comp my meal. Apparently, they had run out of the replacement side dish I chose as well. Again, it seemed like Saturday night just caught this restaurant by surprise, and they were certainly not overrun with customers.  My wife decided to order a dessert to go, as I walked to the men's room. Perhaps it isn't fair to criticize the layout of the restaurant (not the fault of local staff), but my walk to the men's room was like running a gauntlet. I found myself weaving, dodging and stopping abruptly several times, and it was always for restaurant staff crossing my path. None of these staff people would yield to a customer. I really have to question the customer service training at this restaurant.  When I returned to the table, I found my wife chuckling at the miniature dessert serving she had received. All I wanted at that point was one last drink of water, but I had to use my wife's water glass since our water glasses had never been refilled, not even once. As we gathered our things to leave, we realized that the staff had removed the two slices of bread my wife had set aside to take home. They did bring her more, but we couldn't figure out why they would remove food from the table without asking first.  As we left, the young lady at the front spoke her exit script without ever looking at us or changing the dull expression on her face. We just felt so warmed by this...not. Again, this demonstrated a lack of training. The staff at this restaurant is just not well-focused on serving customers as their primary task.  Adding final insult to our evening out was the obvious craving for water we both experienced later. This was not because of salty food, but was due to the obvious use (overuse) of MSG flavor enhancer in Carrabba's food. I'm writing this review the morning after, and I'm still downing water like crazy. They should know that many customers react badly to MSG in their food.  Finally, we left with one remaining gift card in hand, given the fact that the manager covered my meal. Do we plan to use this card? No."}
{"text":"So clearly we have all been to carrabba's before but for my family and I it's been a while so we said what the heck lets grab some Italian. The reason why this visit was different was the level of customer service. The food is always great first off. My step dad loves his steak medium rare and the kitchen cooked it pretty well. Our waiter Johnny and a man with gray hair to I'm guessing was the manger went over the top for us. Had a brand new steak for us with in a few minutes and it was perfect. Gave him a soup while he had to wait and to top it off gave us a dessert after our great meal. If you are in south east Gilbert would highly recommend this location. Ps great new improvements to the menu!"}
{"text":"My family and I went to Carrabba's for dinner last night. Not only was the food excellent but our waiter, Alex was wonderful! We never had to ask for a refill on our drinks or anything else. He was great! Definitely recommend this place and the great service they provide."}
{"text":"We haven't been here in years and were having one of those rare nights where we had a sitter, couldn't decide where we wanted to go and all we could agree on was wanting a sit down dinner in a hurry to make a movie... so, we wound up at Carraba's.  The same man who greets guests was still sitting at the door greeting people (very sweet guy, makes the atmosphere, totally). Frank, our server, did a great job, he had a lot of personality and we enjoyed him. Everything else was good, its just always the food that seems to just. be. 95%. I had a bowl of the lentil soup which is awesomeness in a bowl, but got rainbow trout encrusted with hazelnuts. It sounded amazing, and mostly was, but it was drenched in a butter sauce. blegh. The side of broccoli was also cold. Other than that, the price was decent, service was quick and attentive."}
{"text":"Holy WOWEE!! It is rare that I post a review immediately after a meal, BUT I can't wait to post this review:  What an amazing meal AND EXPERIENCE!! We really, really enjoyed, not only our food, but the ENTIRE EXPERIENCE!! Mike, our server, was AMAZING and an asset to Carrabba's!! It was our first time, and his sincere patience and informative information was just beyond expectation!!!  The food...the soup...the salad...and EVERYTHING was super delicious!!! We were informed that the super delicious soup is available by the 1/2 gallon and, yes siree, we will be ordering it up in quantity, and often!! I could go on and on about the food and our experience dining while sitting at a traditional booth setting BUT it didn't end there!!!  Our amazing server, Mike, suggested we take our 7 year old kid to the \"cooking bar\" for lack of a better term (I don't recall what Mike called it). Our kid was super tired after stuffing his face to the point of comatose. He didn't react much at the time........UNTIL we arrived at the kid friendly \"bar\" where you can watch the entire chef line IN ACTION!!  The chefs put on a SHOW that not only impresses, it ENTERTAINS and it makes you appreciate the LOVE and EFFORT the chefs put into their creations!! After paying the bill, my hubby joined us at the \"cooking bar\" and we were all just BLOWN AWAY!!! We were still on cloud 9 from our food, our outstanding service and our entire experience, we were now BLOWN AWAY by the SHOW put on by the entire staff of chefs!!! Yes, you might have seen it on TV, but this is the REAL DEAL FOLKS!!!!   The employees, including the head chef Juan (as we sat full frontal to the entire cooking line at the cooking bar), who instructed the chefs to create a fire for my kid to see as they cooked away, just were amazing and outstanding!! We have been to those places where chefs perform at your table, but it was NOTHING compared to watching a FULL KITCHEN rocking and rolling BEFORE YOUR VERY EYES!!   The \"managing partner\" was at our table several times to make certain we were satisfied. Sometimes this can be awkward or invasive, but not this guy!!! We welcomed his sincere desire to make certain we were having a good experience!! Sorry, this review has to end here as I'm headed to bed because my tummy is just happy and my body is shutting down!! We will be sure to return soon, and you can look forward to my updated reviews AND pictures!!"}
{"text":"After our really bad dining experience  on my birthday,Dec 31st. But with an intervention of manager Ashley she saved the expierence. So for our 39th anniversary  decided to give it another try. I spoke to Ashley let her know we were coming, She said no problem. I'll take care of you. We arrived and was immediately escorted to our table. Hostess said we have you covered. Dinner was great, our server fabulous. Little did I know when Ashley said well take care of you..The who expierence was compted. Thank you Carrabas."}
{"text":"I am so pleased at the improvement in food and service at the Carrabba's restaurant on Bell.  My husband and I split the surf & turf at the suggestion of our waiter, Sam.  It was just right and the accompanying broccoli was delicious.  We also took advantage of the $10 off a bottle of wine.  Much to choose from and we were able to have a couple of tastings to help make the decision. The folks here made an impression.  Very, very friendly and gracious.  So happy to meet Sam.  We'll be returning soon."}
{"text":"Wow.. This place has the best food.  Why pay more at those high dollar gourmet restaurants.   This place is just as good as those restaurants and half the price. Excellent food and service from the appetizer too the dessert. Everything was perfect and the manager,blond tall, forgot her name was very friendly. Thanks! We will be back."}
{"text":"Once I tried their steak, I knew I'd be going against the old adage: Don't go to an Italian restaurant for a steak.  Went on a Friday night.  Ordered a modified antipasti appetizer.  Was kind of surprised at the skimpy portions, for a $12 appetizer.  Good taste though.  Love the fried zucchini, as they were cut like french fries and battered.  The sirloin was tasty, although the Marsala was a bit scanty.  My daughter loved her Pollo Rosa Maria, but found the baked veggies to appear less than appetizing (although she appreciated the healthy cooking method).  My salmon had a great consistency and was flavorful, but had a smidge of a fishy taste.  The tiramisu had a strong rum flavor, and did not rank well against others I've had from different eateries.  Without alcohol, dinner, beverages and 1 dessert for 3 was close to $100 with tip."}
{"text":"Love it here. Food made to order, except for soup. Accommodating to special requests. Been here many times and never had a bad experience. Sit at the grill side and you may get some free samples :-)"}
{"text":"Came in for a Mother's day dinner on Saturday and it was just okay...   I ordered the Sicilian Chicken soup which was actually pretty delish... I got a salad first that I didn't order... lol  It was all good, though... The server was incredibly sweet about it and hustled to get my soup there as soon as possible...  I loved the flavors... It had a nice spoonful of peppery taste, but the pasta inside was different... It wasn't really good or bad, but it was definitely different...   The salmon had a nice char and the tomato topping added a nice flavor... The broccoli was okay, but it seemed like there was a huge amount of oil used in the preparation, so it just slid all over the plate and collected in pools... It didn't taste badly, but it didn't look the best... I did like the seasonings on top, though, so there's that...   We didn't order dessert, so I can't speak to that... Overall, the service was good and the food wasn't exactly bad, but if I'm looking to get my Italian fix, I have a couple other places in mind first..."}
{"text":"The worst veal Marsala sauce ever. There was a black burnt sludge on top of my veal. Discussing.... they took it off the bill, but how could you possibly serve something like this...,,I don't think a real chef would make something like this.....shame on you.... we haven't been there for a long time....now I know why.... we will never go back... if you want a veal Marsala made fresh go to Bon Gusto.... Erik Lindqwister"}
{"text":"One of Brad T. & I's go to italian restaurants when we want to some take-out.  I have ordered more take-out here than actually dining in the restaurant itself. So, here is a break down of the difference of ordering online and picking it up & actually dining in.  Ordering on-line (4.5 out of 5) Easiness of ordering online (5):  It is very self-explanatory and very easy to navigate through the menu online.  Service while waiting at the take-out parking spot (4):   Some of them are a little snobby, but most of them are rather sweet and greets your with a smile.  Wait-time at the take-out (4):   I would have given it a 5, but there was a time where I waited for 30minutes to get my order.  Overall, there were very fast and efficient.  Food (5) We always order calamari ricardo:  If you like calamari, then you would definitely enjoy this calamari.  It has some spices and herbs that you can dip in a buttery sauce.  I am usually not into spices that much, but this just has a perfect pinch of spice to it.   I always order the spaghetti with meatballs and I love it.   It is never to oily and the meatball is wonderfully made.    Dining-In (3.5 out of 5): Service (4.5):  The service here is very glamours and attentive.   Food: (2.5):  Like I stated earlier, I would always order the spaghetti, but then when I dined in I ordered the lasagna and it tasted like vomit.  I only had three bites into it and I decided I couldnt eat any more of it.   Atmosphere (4):  It is very casual and darker than I expected, but it feels very comfortable.    Overall, I would come back to carrabbas but I would stick to my normal orders and probably would never order the lasagna ever again."}
{"text":"So it was my first time at Carrabba's, Doug has been wanting to try it for a while and he finally go this wish. I feel it's pretty much on par with Olive Garden. If I could give a half star, Carrabba's would've gotten 3 1/2 stars as opposed to the 3 stars I gave OG.  Our waitress was awesome. Let me sample a couple of their sangria flavors before ordering one. The Blackberry Sangria was good. Peach would be perfect in the summer. So I love the bread. I ate way too much bread. Our waitress recommended the Parmesan Salad, I didn't think it was great (OG's salad is better). Doug got the Pasta Sostanza with Chicken, the tagliarini pasta was perfect, it was so light. But the rest of the food in the dish I didn't care for, but Doug liked it, so that's what counts. I got the Chicken Parmesan with cavatappi amatriciana. The chicken had good flavor but was a bit dry, and the cavatappi was cooked perfect but the sauce was tasteless. The servings are big so we left with full bellies and my cavatappi doggie bag so I can eat later after dressing it up a bit. I would go back and give it another try. I would definitely order something else to get a real feel for the restaurant."}
{"text":"I brought one of my dear friends to this place tonight.  We went after a fun filled day at Red Rock Canyon.  The server was great, bread and drinks came out in a timely manner.  No delay in any parts of the meal, salad and soup came out and the main dish right after.    I wanted to advise that the Pasta Rambo is wonderful for those who enjoy seafood dishes.  I recommend to get it with a choice of crab it brings out the flavor of the lemon butter sauce.  There were mushrooms, tomatoes, and spinach.  I would recommend this place.  I didn't have any problems with the service and the food."}
{"text":"In terms of italian-restuarant chains, this is near the bottom of the list for me.  Mainly due to it's prices and menu selection.  The ambiance is great, but that can only make up for so much.    The menu is limited, the most appealing things on it are within the appetizers.  The entree's are steep in price and are limited to a certain pallette.  Also, the prices are not directly correlated to portions, for what you pay for I would expect much larger portions.    Overall, if you're looking for appetizers and a drink, this may be a good spot, but if you're looking for bang-for-your-buck portions, this is not the place for you.  Choose Olive Garden or Buca di Bepo instead."}
{"text":"Its been 45 minutes and still no food...55 minutes. Plates not cleared. Drinks not refilled. Good food, horrible service. Just had to edit my review to 1 star. Our server forgot to put in the to go order I asked for 25 minutes ago, then lied about it."}
{"text":"Servers and staff are friendly and efficient, the food was good and their Monday Amore special was a very good value.  I especially liked the Sicilian  Chicken Soup, which was rich, spicy and flavorful.  My wife had the shrimp and scallops linguine and I had the wood grilled chicken linguine.  Portions were ample enough that we each had a small \"doggie bag\" leftover.  My special came with a dessert and I opted to pay an extra $2 for the cheesecake, which was big enough to share and delicious.  We didn't have any alcohol this evening so our bill was only $33 including tax.  We would return gladly.  Wed. is $10 for any wood fired pizza, so we might even be back this week!"}
{"text":"We had an excellent time at this location. The restaurant was very clean and the staff was great. My fiancé was having trouble deciding on an entrée and our server was able to recommend an \"off menu\" version of the 2 things we were trying to pick between. A+ service.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is the second time my wife and I dined at Carrabus Italian Grill.  Both experiences are worth noting, but Saturday night was extremely satisfying. Never in a huge hurry, we find ourselves in the bar to wait for a table. The polite young lady hostesses told us it would be 30 to 40 minutes.  We do not mind waiting as this does prove that more than most like the establishment and therefore worth the wait. Both visits found us at a very romantic booth well within 20 minutes, barely enough time to finish our drinks. Better under than over the time limit! For both occasions we found the food to be well above average for a \"Chain\" restaurant.  We both had Filet Mignon and fettuccini alfredo with a salad to start.  Salads were wonderful. The Steaks were perfect. The fettuccini was a little over cooked for me, but the wife loves it this way.   The service was impeccable. A very savvy gentleman with a well-rounded knowledge of the menu and food in general served us, kept the water flowing (a must!) and displayed the perfect kind of humor necessary to carry the evening.  Under-rated but not to be ignored was the Sogno Di Cioccolata! What a decadent end to a great meal! One suggestion would be to cook a medium rare steak a wee bit more. Just a thought from my wife. Mine was perfectly rare!! We will be back."}
{"text":"I ordered the Cioppino and I was really disappointed it was the weakest Cioppino in the history of world!  The portion was a joke, it had four baby clams, six very small muscles, one small scalp  and two tinny pieces of white  fish in a bowl with 3 tablespoons of broth. The taste was good, the size of the order was a crime,  a child would have a hard time getting filled up on this order!  The manager and the chef should be ashamed of the self serving this dish and charging $15.00.  Don't order the Cioppino it's not worth the price and you will let down.  Order the pork chop it's worth!"}
{"text":"After reading some of the reviews I would think twice about this place, but I did have a good experience. My family met here on Tuesday night so there was no wait.  We we're served promptly and the female server was great. I ordered a parmigiana salad that was okay but not fabulous. It was a little too salty (as previous reviews will state). It just had too much dressing and I will agree that it was lettuce with carrots with too much salty dressing. However I was hungry and ate it all. Bread and oil were good, but nothing spectacular. I ordered filet mignonette medium rare. I said pink, not raw. It was raw and it had to be returned to the kitchen. When it returned it was perfect and delicious. This is a nice restaurant for the price. Good service and nice atmosphere, nice price, but moderate food, but I still rate it a 4."}
{"text":"I would give this place 0 stars if I could. The best part of the entire meal was the complimentary bread they give. There wasn't much to choose from on the menus and was very pricy!! To start we had the mushrooms as an app, awful don't recommend, comes 4 in an order, stuffed with sausage and blah blah they were hardly stuffed and the Panko on top tasted burnt and the tomato cream sauce was luke warm and tasted like tomato sauce from the can. Then I had the \"fettuccine carrabba\" it was awful. It was greasy and tasteless! Chicken was burnt and the peas inside were still frozen !!! Wtf don't recommend coming here !"}
{"text":"I guess it is everything that you would expect from a chain restaurant.  Normally, I would give this place 4 stars for the great food, good service, and excellent menu, but it is just so vanilla.  There are a million places just like this.  To be a little more specific and helpful, the mussels are the best thing on the menu.  Save some bread (and room) for this treat.  The best entree is the Pollo Rosa Maria.  Chicken stuffed with cheese and topped with an excellent gravy mushroom sauce.   At the very least, you know you are going to a good restaurant.  We are stuffed and you will be too.  Best advice, pace yourself but crush the bread.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Im Italian and this is not Italian food. Carrabba's is a glorified Olive Garden - at best.  I should have known better than to eat somewhere like this, but I was hungry, it was last minute and it happen to be close by. First, the service was... nervous? Our poor girl kept checking on us repeatedly, did that weird thing where they stand at the table too long and asked us some strange questions. I actually felt bad for her. You could see she was trying, but it was just a bit too much.  The food... well, it was sad. My Italian father and I sat there looking at each other in silence as we tried to swallow the next bite. He was looking at me like, \"Why did you make me come here and eat this food that is a mockery of our heritage?\" Im sorry, Dad.   I ordered a special, lobster linguine, and he ordered something that was so forgettable I cant even remember it. Some chicken pasta business. When I ordered my dish my Dad actually said, \"Are you sure? That combination of ingredients doesnt seem right.\" He was right. The ingredients were all off. Also, the whole dish was nearly inedible due to the large slices of garlic that were completely burned, making the whole dish taste like charcoal.   If you are looking for good Italian save your $ for a non-chain place where they actually serve Italian food and have some sort of pride in their food."}
{"text":"While in town I stopped here for a Sunday lunch.  This is a newer design for Carrabba's.  Decor is more streamlined with photographic prints instead of the typical \"Italian\" theme.  Service was on point on this day.  Everything happened in an efficent manner - the server taking my order, salad and bread delivered to the table, entree, and beverage refills.  I had the chicken parmigiana.  Liked the flavor of the chicken.  Very filling portion.  I was impressed."}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend had our first date here two years ago. Cannot remember if the food was good or if the service was amazing but all I know is me and my girlfriend are still together. Thanks carrabbas for not letting me ruin my shot with the perfect girl"}
{"text":"No complaints here! Came on my lunch break and it was a bit empty so we were hoping the food would come out quick. We were in and out within an hour so I was happy.   The food was delicious but nothing out of this world. I ordered a mezzaluna (ravioli) and my coworker's got lasagne and fettuccine. There was free, warm bread and olive oil and herbs.   Service was okay; our server checked on us once while we were eating our free bread the one more time when we asked for a box and our check.   Idk if I'll be back out of choice. Maybe only if the people I'm with really want to go."}
{"text":"I only have been here when others I am out with pick it.  If it was my choice,  I would steer clear.  The prices are higher for mediocre food.  The lighting is too dark for my preference.  The place has many Sun City residents visiting/long waits to get a table.  No point doing a call ahead,  you still wait (we called ahead but waited 45 minutes after our time slot). And the staff rush you through so that they can get the next group through."}
{"text":"I always get two seats I've wanted I get served quickly and easily I love the many different waiters and waitresses they always are so nice and friendly they serve me fabulously I've never had a bad meal out of this Carrabba's especially their steak marsala is to die for I have come here now for almost 5 years you want a good steak this is where to come you will not be disappointed"}
{"text":"Craving a little Italian and this place is always good.  Tonight I had the Seafood Cannelloni with lobster, shrimp and scallops, blended with roasted garlic and chives, topped with a light tomato cream sauce and crabmeat.  This was great choice.    For desert, we split the Sogno Di Cioccolata \"Chocolate Dream\" which is a very  rich fudge brownie brushed with Kahlua, add in a little chocolate mousse, fresh whipped cream  and it's a beautiful end to a good meal.  I have been here several times and haven't every been disappointed, the prices are little higher, but the service is excellent.  So it's nice to spend a little, enjoy the meal, and leave feeling very satisfied."}
{"text":"Our server Anthony was amazing and wonderfully friendly.  A little disappointing on the food for $20 per entree. I had the salmon cetriolini, very skimpy on the cucumber dill topping and the sauce.  The 2 bites I had with veg and sauce were delicious though. The salmon was almost overcooked,  they got it off the fire just in time but was still on there about 30 seconds too long. Fresh veg sides need work. Zucchini tastes like spaghetti (so if you try to avoid pasta but are hungry for spaghetti get that!) And the sauteed spinach and garlic was swimming in  oil, garlic had no flavor and they were pretty big slices.   My husband had the wood grilled steak with bacon wrapped shrimp. The steak was cold and the spicy butter didn't melt so it wasn't very appetizing.  They wrap an extremely thin slice of bacon around all 4 shrimp before grilling so you get very little bacon flavor.  All in all I think it will be a long time before we eat there again."}
{"text":"4 out of 5 times we went here the service has been simply awful, or more accurately completely lacking.  Last night it took them over 30 minutes to finally serve our meal.  People around us came in after and were already eating dessert when we haven't even been served our salads.  Our server, Samantha, disappeared somewhere in the back where bored servers hang together (there are a lot of them) and it took us twice to find someone to find her.  We went in for my husband's birthday and their steak \"wasn't available\".   We get served leftover bread from lunch that is hard as rocks.  Our food is most often cold (room temp) when it is finally served and salmon is HORRIBLE  cold.  We are dine rewards members so we always try to go there or Outback or Bonefish but, really, what happened to customer service???  Are we all so used to bad service that we think it's ok and live with it?  Well, we haven't been back to Bonefish in months and this is the last straw for Carrabba's.  Too bad for us."}
{"text":"Came in for dinner one night and sat at the bar. The bartender was very friendly and was quick on the draw to tend to me. I ordered the Chicken Parm/Lasagna combo with a glass of Cabernet Sauvignon."}
{"text":"These guys make the best Chicken Marsala on the planet!! Well done!"}
{"text":"We went here with our friends a few weeks ago and had a great time. Delilah, our server, was fantastic. I had to send my salad back because it was drenched in dressing and they took care of it super quick. All of the food was perfect, hot, and delicious. The only knock was that the tables are so crammed together that we could have reached over an taken our neighbor's spoon. Probably the best food/service combo we've had in 2014... so far :)"}
{"text":"So yummy!! We haven't eaten here in a long time and I was so happy we decided to! We had linguini with clam $13 that came with a salad or soup.....so tasty!! The pasta was sauced perfectly! Bread was soft and warm! We wanted dessert but were too full to have some.  We will def be back! Service was also very good. This place is way better than Olive Garden or macaroni grill!!!!!"}
{"text":"Food was yummy! Service good. Atmosphere is dated, and lacking warmth. Clean though. The soup and salads were delicious."}
{"text":"Had my favorite, the filet marsala, and it was excellent! Cooked slightly to rare, excellent quality meat, and smothered in mushrooms and the best marsala wine sauce ever! The asparagus was good along with the garlic mashed but nothing out of this world."}
{"text":"I've been going to Carrabba's for a long time. This location's service and food quality has been declining for several years now.  We went for dinner the other night and came away pretty disappointed in our experience. Our waitress was barely present, the other servers were joking and screwing around in the dining room, our food was OK but nothing great and the calamari was way over done!  I doubt we'll be returning to this location in the future."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, but we had a 3pm reservation and we had to wait nearly one hour to be seated. It seems like they need to improve their seating practices."}
{"text":"Delightful server Desiree answered our questions, kept the bread coming beverages full and recommended her favorites. I enjoyed a shrimp and scallop pasta, red sangria, and an Italian salad. No complaints. Loved every bite."}
{"text":"I found my salad to be a little fishy. The waitress took it off our bill and was very apologetic. I have been eating the same salad for ten years so the taste was totally different than normal. She had no issues taking care of the problem and was very sweet!"}
{"text":"Today was first time here and my experience was amazing. It's hard to find places that really know how to cook a steak and they did an amazing job. Also their sea scallops were amazing. I will definitely be coming back!!"}
{"text":"Actually had really good service here, I think our waiters name was Mario or something and he was all over us.  I got baked scallops and a salad, hard to mess that up, and it was very good. I did wish; however, that our waiter would've mentioned their special 3 courses for $15 b/c we probably all would've done that. Either way I was happy enough.  This is definitely not authentic Italian food it's a chain restaurant for crying out loud, but it's affordable, fast, and will leave you full!"}
{"text":"If your anything like me, you HATE ordering the same thing over & over again(even of it's your fav & you know it's delicious).   I first went here with an ex-boyfriend, I had ordered one of the specials that day. Our server comes out with our food, everything was delicious..halfway through our meal the manager came over & said our server had given me the veal version of my meal instead of chicken. No biggie, It was still good. The manager then boxed up my right meal, a full salad, and desert to take home. They were sooooooooo apologetic, which makes me happy to know they have incredible customer service!"}
{"text":"Been a regular since they opened never been disappointed. From the staff (that has changed in last 16 years) to the food always good time. My wife and i always sit at the bar  We avoid some long lines in peak season this way."}
{"text":"Honestly it's always a different experience everytime I go. Happy hour pricing is in the entire bar area. Seat your self. Then oh no happy hour is in just the high tops you must be seated on the booths. Then oh no sit anywhere in the bar.  Regardless. Once we get seated, service is good. Food is tasty. Apps are good that's about it. Everything else is overpriced."}
{"text":"First timerrrrrrr. Whooooo. I like it here. We sat at the bar area, where FOOTBALL was on. Pizza, beer and football? Two thumbs up. I ordered the Margherita pizza with mushrooms. It was ehhh. It was way too much cheese. I didn't like the after taste either. I was so looking forward to the fried zucchini, but ahhhhh. It was too soft and salty, I was so disappointed. My best friend on the other hand devoured the muscles and calamari. Haha. So over all. It was a decent dinner."}
{"text":"My salmon was nearly raw when it arrived at the table.  The waitress quickly sent it back to have it fixed. When I received my food I found they had just reheated my salmon and then reserved it. I have never been to a restaurant where they just recook your food is they mess it up. When I question the manager about it he advised this was their practice for 20+ years and that even Outback does it. He tone was very condescending. Being in the service industry I was blown away with how he handled it. He did offer to make a new one but by then I had to leave because my lunch break was over. Overall just a really bad experience."}
{"text":"My husband and I wanted someone else to cook tonight. We decided to go here on Market St. in GILBERT. Mike, who is probably the owner, greeted us with a smiling face and vibrant welcome at the door. Mike told me about the Frose', an Icy Italian drink that helps beats the summer heat. I was reluctant, but decided to try it.  I'm so happy I did!  It was a cocktail with a hint of strawberry that chills your body temperature immediately. For the entree, I ordered linguine with Pomodoro Sauce, and my husband had the spaghetti and meatballs. Everything was well prepared and tasted amazing. The bread and oil is unlike other breads, and the entire place had an Italian aroma coming from the kitchen. We lingered a little longer than usual, because of the relaxing vibe of the place. John, our server, couldn't have been more attentive!  We were impressed, and glad we came here to avoid the 115 degree heat."}
{"text":"The food is good for the most part. I've had a few meals in the past that were so-so and a few that were really good.   I was making a stab at eating semi-healthy. I ordered the hazelnut grilled fish - which was very good, served hot - the portion was bigger than I should have eaten, but . . . The pasta side was good . . . cheat on the diet.   The chicken soup was quite hot and good but would have been better for my health and tastier if less salt was used.   The bread comes to the table HOT with olive oil and blend of spices - too good. Ate WAY too much.   My meal was $16 plus tax and tip . . . Service was friendly and attentive. It is one of the better chains in the Bell Road row. If I could I'd rate it about 3.8 - not really a four, but enough better than a 3  . . ."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery and was very impressed by the service. Tedarian took my order and was extremely helpful for me finding a vegan option :). It is great to be waited on by someone who doesn't seem annoyed by my questions and dietary restrictions."}
{"text":"Worst carrabas I've ever been to. Not busy at all and waiters standing around while no one takes orders or gives a crap. Food sub par in comparison to other carrabas. I know what you're thinking...\"you asked for it\" by coning to a corporate restaurant but i swear I've had good experiences in other carrabas. But now im forever afraid...."}
{"text":"This is a great location we tried while on vacation here.  We enjoy the Aurora, CO location frequently and we were looking for a good standby while traveling.  The Lasagna was excellent and very generous.  Service was top drawer and the place was hopping.  It is easy to find and they are always great!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I came to eat on a Saturday night at 7:30. We were seated right away next to the open kitchen where we were able to watch the cooks hard at work. Our waiter was very friendly and had a smile on his face our entire visit. The food was phenomenal and cooked in a timely manner. The price was right. I cant wait to bring my daughter, or anyone special, there again soon. Thank you Carrabbas for contributing to a fantastic evening with my daughter. I LOOOOOVVVVEEEE a crumble."}
{"text":"Always enjoy Carrabba's food and atmosphere.  This time different.  Food was ok although calamari was over-cooked and rubbery.  What was irritating was the pace of service.  Waitress was wonderful but food was coming out at alarming rate. Ordered calamari and we weren't halfway through when soup and salad came out.  Now sitting there with soup, salad and appetizer, and entree comes out! I understand the concept of turning over tables, but come on!  It was curbside with a table.  So much for a relaxed romantic dinner. We were barely able to finish the one drink we had because we were so rushed."}
{"text":"I ordered some take out from here last week. Prompt service, and excellent customer service. My order was pretty simple; pasta with tomato sauce and a salad.   The salad was good, and I enjoyed the dressing. They also gave me bread and olive oil with a packet of seasoning. Also good. The pasta was nice and it was a good sized portion.   I should start this on my lunch rotation at work. Overall, it was good!"}
{"text":"Went there last night for take-out and had a glass of wine at the bar while we waited for our food. The lady who did carry out (Vanessa) I think was super nice and efficient. The bartender was equally nice and efficient. The food was great and well priced. This was my first time here and I will for sure be back since it is so close to our house."}
{"text":"I came here with a couple of friends. The lights were low and the wood fire oven was going, creating a nice atmosphere. I have to say I got \"chain restaurant\" feel from the decor, as it it were a cookie-cutter design, but it wasn't an unpleasant environment.   I was sad that no eggplant parmigiana appeared on the menu, so after I shared an appetizer whose name I cannot recall, I chose the spaghetti with meatballs.     The appetizer had crab, cheese and spinach in it, among other things. It had a nice flavor, but I got the impression it was whipped, which gave it an airy texture that I do not like. It comes with toasted bread triangles that are crisp on the outside and soft on the inside.  My spaghetti was fine.  So...  I have no real complaints and would certainly come again if friends wanted to, but if I were asked to recommend an Italian restaurant, this one wouldn't be the first on my list only because it's pretty average."}
{"text":"Carrabba's has been a common casual dining spot for my mother and I since I was young. We have been going to the chain restaurant for almost nine years now, and about seven years at this location which is six miles away from where we live. However, we have always enjoyed the food and service enough to continuously return. In particular, there is a host - an Asian gentleman with glasses - who has consistently welcomed us and provided impeccable service.  This was the first time my mother and I had arrived a little after three o'clock in the afternoon for a late lunch, we usually either come in during the early lunch or dinner hour. The host that usually greets us (mentioned above) was occupied, but we noticed there was a change in a handful of waitresses. We were served by Brianna (on the receipt: Brianna P) who was quite friendly but displayed the worst service that I have ever experienced at Carrabba's and maybe at any restaurant, ever.  Of course, realizing that there were new servers my mother and I attempted to be patient but found that the poor service only continued to escalate our frustration. We ordered calamari as an appetizer, the soup and salad combo, along with the prosciutto wrapped pork tenderloins. The food was delicious, and we had absolutely no complaints about the food. Though, we found the fact that we were served our salads before the appetizer was already strange (typically, the appetizer comes first). Not a big deal though, until the dirty dishes began piling up on our table. Brianna had crossed multiple times and I realized that she also had not picked up any of the dishes on the OTHER tables. There were empty glasses, dirty plates, and left over utensils taking up room on all tables that she was serving. It was NOT busy at all in the restaurant.   After our food was all served, Brianna - while walking - had asked if we were doing okay while she was attempting to serve another table. Although we were entirely fine, I found that this was not the proper manners of a Carrabba's waiter, let alone ANY waiter. Brianna was at the table beside us, cleaning up the dirty plates after a party of about five or six had left. We had to shout \"excuse me\" multiple times before we caught her attention and managed to let her know that our water glasses were completely empty and had been the entire time she was wandering around the restaurant.  There was a bit of leftover food and we were looking to have it packed so we requested a box and the check. Brianna volunteered to pack the leftovers and I sincerely wish she hadn't since when she packed the food, she put it in the bag sideways. I have never been to a restaurant where the waiter would pack the food and put the container on its side where the food was not only laying along the opening, but also having the contents dripping onto the bag. It's entirely unappetizing, honestly.  The bill ended up totaling to $39.55 and we put down $50 and immediately handed our bill back, being asked if we wanted change for the leftover. I suppose there were no coins in the register and our server decided to round up, but she returned a ten dollar bill and a one dollar bill. Mind you, my mother and I have both work in the service industry and understand that MOST of us live off tips. But a ten dollar tip for a forty dollar bill, where the service was subpar? That is absolutely out of the question. At this point, my mother and I were absolutely speechless. And of course, she was nowhere to be found when we wanted to break the bill down.   Honestly, we should have left only the dollar she returned because this was the worst service we have ever experienced here at Carrabba's during all nine years that we have been coming here. I'm not sure if we will be coming back."}
{"text":"Last night we went to Carrabas for dinner. I got served a salad with a wood chip in it. The manager came over to give me a new salad (which I really couldn't eat because I was freaked out about what other inedible objects might be lurking) and simply says \"Oh it was probably a wood chip from our pizza oven.\" Never said, \"Let me take that off your bill or dessert is on me!\" NOTHING!!!! I then realized that my tongue was scraped from the wood chip but the manager would never know that because he never came back to check how the meal was. I could barely eat my pasta because again I was freaked out about what other inedible objects might I find and all I got was \"it's a wood chip from our pizza oven!\" Really???? That's great customer service! It'll be a looooong while before I go back there, if at all!!!!"}
{"text":"Over priced!!!! Not very big portions, the food just isn't justified with the high prices. This place is always crowded I just don't get it. The only thing I enjoy are the herbs to dip the bread in."}
{"text":"So much freakin food!!  My advice to you would be to enjoy the wonderful bread and oil they serve, just order the entree and you'd be full enough.  We for some reason opted for an appetizer along with soup (soup was the killer!) we were SOOOO full by the time the entrees came we just boxed it up and ate it the next day.  Still good though.  Definitely the best Italian chain restaurant I've ever been to."}
{"text":"It was not horrible but it wasn't the best. Overpriced, wish there was a good Italian restaurant in Vegas reasonably priced, pasta is one of the cheapest things to cook.  My husband and daughter were sick later in the night, they ordered the shrimp and scallop dish."}
{"text":"I took my son's girlfriend here on a Monday night. They had Monday night specials which gives you a appetizer or desert, an entree and soup or salad and bread. Our food and service was great and I had enough to even take 1/2 home for later."}
{"text":"It's just average food, not that amazing. The server was ok, I didn't think she was that warm. I would give it another chance again, but for a sit down restaurant I rather go somewhere else."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in the area! However I was slightly disappointed today. I went in with my daughter, her friend and my friend for a quick late lunch. It was busy but not overwhelming. We were seated right away when we walked in but it took over 10 minutes wait to even get our drink order.   When our server greeted us it was a very rushed greeting. Which I completely understand when you are running more than one table to be a bit hurried. However, when u work in the restaurant industry, customer service is a must! Having experience in the serving life, I never cheat a server out of their tip unless the service was un-salvageable. With that being said, I can attest she was efficient in serving us and having our food delivered promptly and still hot, as well we never had to ask for refills which is always great!   I order my fav appetizer, Calamari. I love Carraba's calamari but today I think they undercooked the seafood. It was chewy and \"juicy\". Not oily but like the calamari wasn't properly dried before coating it with the breading and frying it. I tried to pick at the more cooked calamari but soon gave up.   My lentil and sausage soup was delicious and spicy which uplifted my spirits from the calamari ordeal.   My entree was too very tasty and filling. I am a slow eater and I love to enjoy my food. Towards the end of our meal I was the only one left with a plate in front of her but soon felt rushed once again to pack what I was still eating and pay my bill.   Overall I enjoyed most of the meal but the customer service can step it up a bit. I don't care for too much interaction but I definitely don't like to feel rushed to eat a meal I'm trying to enjoy."}
{"text":"Without question one of the worst meals I've had in recently history.  I left feeling physically ill.  No way would I have ever tried this place if I didn't have a gift card to use.  But free wasn't good enough.  I should have been paid to eat this garbage.  How this restaurant stays in business with all of the far better restaurants nearby is beyond me.  Oh wait, no it's not, stupid people still exist."}
{"text":"Saturday night, 8pm. There were 4 of us, C, K, Grandma C and me and we got seated right away. Right away I'm suspect as to why this place is not bustling. The O.G. would have a wait for sure. As we sat down at our table we discussed as to why we hadn't been back to Carrabba's in a long time, well over 2 years. We concluded that none of us remembered why. We came here tonight because K wanted to try Carrabba's again and Grandma C had a 15% off coupon. Our server was Sarah. K felt like she really didn't want to be at work tonight. I think it was just her normal persona. Can't fault her for being her. Sarah took our drink order and an order for Calamari ($10.29) and off she went. I perused the menu and one thing stood out right away. The prices. Holly @#$%. Are you serious? Now I know why there weren't a lot of people here. Well, after we ate I found the other reasons but at this moment I told Grandma C I was glad she brought a coupon because at this rate there wasn't going to be much inheritance left for C. She laughed. Sarah brought our drinks ($2.95) and the Calamari and took our dinner order. So the drinks are almost 3 bones and honestly, that's ridiculous. The restaurant industry in general needs to get a grip on the price of a soda or iced tea. Because if the prices are going to continue in the skyward direction, I'm going to bring a powdered drink mix and order water. The portion size of the Calamari was on the smaller size and it was overcooked. BINGO. K blurted it out. \"I remember now why we haven't been back here. The last time we came we got into an argument with the manager about the overcooked Calamari\". We all agreed and remembered that wonderful experience. NOT! Well here we were again and the Calamari was overcooked, just a tad, and really to me, it was acceptable. K and Grandma C however thought it also had a bit of a fishy taste as well. Hmmm. That means it's old. And judging by the lack of a crowd, it's possible that the kitchen can't move through enough product to keep it uber fresh. Bummer. The other negative was that the Calamari rings were really small, some of them the size of pencil erasers. That's tiny in the Calamari world and when an order is $10.29, you should expect nice, large, plump, FRESH rings. So all of our entree's came with soup or salad. C got Minestrone soup, Grandma C got the Mama Mandolas Sicilian Chicken soup, K got a Caesar salad and I got the house salad. C loves the Minestrone at O.G., not so much here. He took a bit and said it tasted like chicken broth and celery. Grandma C said her soup was o.k., K liked her Caesar salad. Now I asked for my salad with blue cheese dressing. They don't have blue cheese dressing so Sarah suggested that I get the house dressing, a creamy parmesan and add blue cheese crumbles to it. Hmmm, that sounded awesome. The creamy parmesan was really good and Sarah brought a nice little ramekin of Gorgonzola chunks, not blue cheese. Hey, totally fine with me. What wasn't fine was the $2.00 add on for the cheese chunks that Sarah never mentioned. News flash to servers. ANYTHING that is an add on MUST BE disclosed to the customer. All of our entree's were not hot, just warm. Grandma C felt her's was moving towards the cooler than warmer side. Bummer. C got the Rigatoni Al Forno ($9.99). I think this was the best value on the menu.  Rigatoni pasta oven-baked with marinara sauce, romano and mozzarella cheeses, topped with Italian sausage, mozzarella and ricotta cheese. $10 bones. This was tasty and C loved it. Grandma C got the Pollo Sorrento ($18.29). Grilled chicken breasts topped with sauteed eggplant, prosciutto, fontina cheese and a port wine fig sauce. She got it with a side of Cavatappi and marinara instead of veggies. Grandma C commented that it was just o.k., nothing special, no real WOW flavors. Bummer, because we both thought that the Port wine and fig sauce sounded Yummy. They just didn't deliver. K got the Cavatappi Martino ($15.29). Grilled chicken, sautéed mushrooms, sun-dried tomatoes and cavatappi pasta tossed in a tomato cream sauce. K said the food was fine, nothing special, no real outstanding flavors either. I ordered Lasagne. ($15.49). Right off the bat I felt the portion was small for the price. The flavors were o.k. but the center was cool. I think it would have been better had they poured a little more marinara over the top. All in all we realized why we had not been back. There's just too many better italian type restaurants out there with better food and prices.  + Drink refills without asking, attentive service - prices about $2 more than they should be, portion size on Lasagne small, web prices wrong, non disclosed add on, luke warm food, fishy Calamari, no manager interaction. 1 Star."}
{"text":"I always order the spiedeno di mare (sp?) which is scallops and shrimp....and even though they say there is consistency among these chain restaurants - there is always a slight variation. However, the chef here knows how to do it JUST RIGHT ! The scallops and shrimp were cooked perfectly; the coating was perfect also. I wish the Carrabba's in Toledo could learn from this cook!!"}
{"text":"We went to carraba's and we all ordered the same meal, the turf and surf special.  I ordered mine medium while most of the rest of the table ordered theirs medium rare.  They all came out a different shade of pink. Mine was more like medium rare,  two others were barely medium rare and less than medium rare.  But my wife's was was rare,  bleeding rare.  She returned it to get it cooked more.  The waiter took the whole Plate while my wife was in the middle of eating the other items on her plate.   The manager came over and apologized for the meat and taking the whole plate.  When the beef came back the steak was now well-done.  The waiter explained that he is not the cook and he has no control over the kitchen.  We did get the meal comped but how can one restaurant have three different ideas for a steak temp."}
{"text":"I was really surprised; I didn't think we would like this place so much; being from NY we have had some really great Italian meals. First of all, the service is very good, we have been back a few times now and the staff is knowledgable and friendly. They really make you feel at home. The food is good, entrees of chicken, pasta, steak, have never been disappointed. The bread/w olive oil, soup and appetizers are filling and plentiful, you will be taking food home with you. And, try the desert. Overall a very pleasant dining experience that won't break the bank!"}
{"text":"Tonight was my parents 50th anniversary, and although the night started a little rough it ended great...why? Manager Josh. We were served our six dinners, but then my mom and I's fried ravioli's came and they were quite hard and cold. We told Spencer, our great waiter, and he asked if we wanted a desert to make up for it. I was actually hungry for my ravioli dinner. So I was super surprised and happy when the manager Josh brought over freshly cooked, steaming hot ravioli's to our table. They were great. But then he went one step further and brought THREE different desert samples to our table without charge. THEN he took off the bad ravioli's from our bill. Josh turned what started to be a not-so-great dinner into a GREAT dining experience. Thank you Josh and Spencer, my family and I will be back...SOON!"}
{"text":"Let me tell you folks. AMAZING service, felt like I was on top of the world with our server Paige. She was prompt with our food and she has an awesome personality that made the experience with my family 10x better !   On top of the great service the food was impeccable. They have VODKA SAUCE! Extremely delicious and I definitely will be back because of the food and Paige !"}
{"text":"The Italian food here was alright. We had to wait about 20 minutes on a Saturday night to eat. I ordered a seafood trio platter that consisted of salmon, breaded scallops, and lobster ravioli, and cost $18 for like 3 pieces of each. I ate bread to appease myself (which was some sort of salty, herb mix drenched in olive oil. NO balsamic vinegar! =/). My sister ordered a seafood pasta, which had mussels and shrimp in marinara sauce. She said it was \"alright\" also. Other than that, this place cannot top Macaroni Grill and of course....BUCA di Beppo! Probably would not go here again..."}
{"text":"Had not been here in awhile and so glad I rediscovered this place. This used to be one of my favorite chain Italian restaurants. I had the Spiedino Di Mare (shrimp and scallops). Whenever I moan during a meal, it's good. Embarrassing, but good...I had it with the Cavatappi Amatriciana. Could not have been more of a perfect meal. Well, it could have been with just a scoop of Bluebell Ice Cream, but hey I'm in Vegas and we don't have that. But WAIT...I\"m at Carrabba's and GUESS WHAT? YES!!!!Blue Bell Ice Cream. I thought that I was in heaven. Perfect meal. PERFECT!"}
{"text":"Very good food but the glasses where dirty multiple times. The server wasn't very attentive either seemed too busy for us. Besides all those the food was Really Good"}
{"text":"We heard theor radio ads and got suckered!  True part: 3 courses for $12.99. False part: includes spaghetti to take home for tomorrow.  We used to go there often.  Sorry, there are other more honest choices."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Excellent food, service and atmosphere. We have been here a few times and have yet to be disappointed. The Tuscan chicken is wonderful, flavorful and moist. The waiters are friendly and on top of their game, our drinks are never empty."}
{"text":"Just okay.  I ate here with a couple of coworkers for lunch. Big mistake for the setting. Their lunch menu is not that great. They have some small plate selections but it's pricey for the portion. A coworker ordered the small plate of meatballs and it was literally 2 meatballs. I ordered the shrimp scampi and it was just okay. For a chain, I was expecting better specials and lunch plates.   Service was awesome though. One of the biggest issues was that our table wanted calamari. Apparently, the fire marshal was coming and the restaurant couldn't fry any foods until they came. It was just awkward because that was the main item that was wanted.   The setting/ambiance is great and there is plenty parking in the deck behind the restaurant."}
{"text":"It's not our first rodeo at Carabbas so we thought! We like both their happy hour and regular dinner menu.  We were going to have happy hour and walked towards the bar area to sit down at a booth but the host stopped us and directed us to the main dining room even though we said we want to do happy hour.  Ok.  We ordered two round of drinks, two happy hour appetizers and one main entree.  At this point, Sam our waiter told us that the happy hour appetizers served in the main dining room will be at regular prices (chicken wings and mussels). Sam said happy hour only applies toward drinks in the main dining room.   We told him that we were sent to the dining room per our host insistence.  Ok Sam, we dropped the issue and had dinner feeling a bit upset by their misleading policies among their own staff. I've never had any  complaints about my experience at Carrabas however l want to voice my dissatisfaction and warn my readers. Having said this, l like their food very much, comfy environment and l will return.  But they won't pull the same trick on me again. Today 'll giving them only 3 stars because they treated us 3 star customers."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here on Christmas Eve.  I called ahead and told them we would be there at 6 PM.  We arrived at 5:55 and were told it would be about 15 minutes...After 8 min we were seated in the requested booth.  Our waitress was Sonamita...She is amazing...  We were going to order two appetizers...She suggested we order the trio for less money and it had the two we were going to order anyway.  After asking several questions about the menu we placed our order.   The appetizers were delivered and were wonderful.  As we were enjoying them, Sonamita came over and said she would put the order in when we were almost done with the first round.  We really appreciated that.  Our food was excellent.  The food was hot and flavorful...Sonamita checked on us often and packaged up the left overs promptly.    We are planning on returning on New Year's Eve for an early dinner with friends.  They allowed us to be put on the call ahead list.  We asked for a booth and Sonamita.   In looking around at the staff it appeared that everyone was friendly and happy.  I expected to see some sad faces because they were working on Christmas Eve but that did not happen."}
{"text":"I continue to enjoy Carrabba's as much as someone like me would. I went back last night, and tried the prosciutto-wrapped shrimp. I would definitely recommend. Another at my table had the prosciutto-wrapped pork tenderloin and also had great things to say.   My only complaint would be the tables/chairs are really close to each other. The restaurant was fairly busy when I got there, and there were several times people were backing chairs into others and having a difficult time getting out of their chairs and through the aisles.   I requested Sabrina as my server (always), and she did not disappoint. She's friendly, attentive and timely. Go and ask for her.  I've heard this is the best location around. I don't have the experience to back that up, but they do a really good job here."}
{"text":"My first experience at Carraba's was pretty great! I have Celiac, so everything I eat has to be completely gluten free. This seemed like a great option since they have a ton of gluten free dishes.  It's good to know that almost everything here is gluten friendly, and Celiac safe. There are a lot of places that have gluten friendly options, but are bad about cross contamination. This restaurant not only has gluten free pasta, but all of their dressings are gluten free, and they thicken their alfredo sauce with rice flour instead of wheat flour.  I had a side caesar salad, hold the crutons, and it was yummy! The pasta dish I had had chicken, tomatoes, GF pasta, and garlic. It was decent. Not the best I've ever had. The noodles were a little mushy, but it's probably just me getting used to GF noodles. I'll definitely try an alfredo dish next time.  The server we had was awesome. She was very knowledgeable about gluten and Celiac, which is hard to come by. Hopefully the Carraba's closer to my house will be as good as this one was!"}
{"text":"We went for happy hour and was very satisfied. Great food and value. Service was very friendly and nice location"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great food. My server Allyson is awesome. She totally makes you feel welcomed. This is my favorite Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"After looking at the reviews and because it was close to my hotel I decided to give it a try.  I had a very nice meal.  The chicken parmesan. Very tasty and portions were very good. Had a nice spicy kick to it. The price was reasonable. A very good chance I'll visit again before I leave town."}
{"text":"So, I ordered delivery again. And, again, everything had to be reheated. Needless to say there is a $4.00 delivery charge, has anyone everyone heard of that??? I asked the delivery man about that and he said that was not his tip, so in addition I had to tip. I completed the survey I received with the meal and made a note about this. I have never seen a delivery charge, rather a minimum order for delivery. I think if they want to keep a delivery option they should think about mirroring every other restaurant in the area... Just my thought. For now, I'll pass on delivery as it doesn't seem to be worth it."}
{"text":"Mama Mandola's Sicilian chicken soup alone is worth a trip. Get a huge bowl for $6. Had the lasagna for the first time today and it was good. Nicely portioned. The wine is way overpriced so skip it."}
{"text":"Great place to eat! Make a reservation on the weekend or you will have to wait!"}
{"text":"I had the ribs which may be a poor choice for an Italian restaurant and my wife had shrimp also probably a bad choice.   The service was good and the place is nice.  Unfortunately I was starving and I left that way.  The food on that night was not very tasty.  I couldn't make it past the second rib it had some thick nasty sauce and a sliver of meat.  My wife offered me her shrimp and that was worse she couldn't eat it and neither could I.  We ordered a desert to try and get full and wow was that tasteless.  Maybe they got a new cook who can't.  I wish we had went to Olive Garden or even McDonalds instead because I felt robbed.  I went home and ate a sandwich and chips to fill up.  Sorry for the review but it was just that bad."}
{"text":"Way better then Olive Garden. All the food is freshly made. I had the shrimp and scallops in vodka sauce. The seafood was cooked really we'll. I had a great Cesar salad and for dessert we had the trio of cakes. Soo good!! I will come back"}
{"text":"Food was ok don't know what happen to the quality. Paid 98.00 for two Adults and two children. What is with vegas is it me or does the food over time just get shitter. Never again just asking for fair price for what is served thsts all nothing more."}
{"text":"Good service and food. Pretty good for a chain. This location was very busy but servers and staff remained attentive and responded quickly to drinks and requests."}
{"text":"This is one of the better Carrabbas I've been to. I usually sit at the bar to dine in and tonight I was craving lasagna told the bartender so the owner and chef made it personally for me to enjoy! Pretty sweet."}
{"text":"Got a gift card. I tried the calamari. Lightly fried in an almost tempura cloud of breading. Very delicate and let the flavor shine through more than the average deep fried squid. Problem: almost all tentacles. I normally steer clear of those, but I didn't want to waste ten bucks, so I ate them all. I prefer the not dangly parts. The lasagna was a total waste. Small, acidic, no real taste to the meat or ricotta. With minimal drinks and other items among three diners, the bill was astoundingly high. Like cable bill high. Very bad value for your lira. Never going back."}
{"text":"The chicken Trio is the bomb, Shrimp and Scallop Spedinio yummy, fire grilled chicken and asparagus yum?Do not forget to get the Blackberry Sangria addicting! Happy hour is great half price drinks and appetizers Love this place Brianna got a free dessert for her birthday?"}
{"text":"Went early on a Thursday and was very disappointed. Our food sat up on the line for 6-8 minutes and three different people walked by and looked right at it. My potatoes were cold.  We love Carrabba's just have to stop going to this location."}
{"text":"This was the first time in about 8 years that we'd eaten at Carrabba's, and boy has it changed!  The prices are much higher ($20 for pasta at a chain restaurant?!?!?), and the portions were about half of what they used to be.  I ordered the pork chop Marsala, which used to come with a nice thick juicy chop.  The chop was much thinner, and it was over cooked to the point that it was leathery. With all of the good restaurants in the Ahwatukee area, I'm shocked that this place is still in business."}
{"text":"My hubby and I tried this place for the first time and were very impressed. The waiter had asked if we had been there before, when we said no, he spent extra time with us letting us know about all the different specials they offered.   The food was awesome! We barely made it thru the bread, dip, and salad. We ended upmtaking half of our food home and it was even better the next day.   We will be back there for sure! Yumm-O!!!"}
{"text":"I finally made my first visit to Carrabba's.  We did the Amore Monday special.  It was a lot of food for a good price (twelve ninety nine).  I had the linguine positano with chicken.  Very tasty & some of it came home since it was a good sized portion.  Next time I had the chicken marsala - another good meal.  They had a free order of meatballs to go this day so I had the meatballs the next day.  I didn't care for them that much - too much garlic & seasoning.   If you want good meatballs, go to Enzo's on Stallings down the road.    We had good service both times we went."}
{"text":"Overpriced! Split plastic on seats. Salad consisted of romaine lettuce with shredded carrots thrown on top and two tiny olives. I'm not kidding! This was called a salad. I got the $12.00 small chicken with pasta. And it was small, very small. Should have been about $7.00 at the most. My husband got the pasta Carrara, full size for $14.50. The entrees had good flavor but seemed very salty and garlicky. The service was quick and efficient but not particularly friendly. Overall I was not impressed and won't be back."}
{"text":"First time for me and my wife and we love it. . Me in particular I'm tired of olive garden and this place is awesome.  Food , environment , staff is great definitely will back. ."}
{"text":"The food is OK. The service is also average.  I would never eat here again but only because I enjoy good food and good service.  Now if you like drinking, the happy hour goes until seven and the appetizers are also half price during this time. So for you folks get here early.  I think it starts at three."}
{"text":"As chain restaurants go, Carraba's is pretty dang good.  Good menu choices with some innovative choices, nice atmosphere, consistently good wait staff in my experience, and fair prices.  MUCH better than Olive Garden IMHO, in all respects.  When it comes to Italian, I prefer the mom & pop joints with red & white checked tablecloths, 50-yr old Olympia beer signs covered in dust, and Grandpa sitting over in the corner at \"his\" table all night, monitoring the goings-on.. but when one of those joints isn't available, Carraba's isn't a bad choice at all."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in a while so I brought my sister today and everything came out perfect and the service was above and beyond. Normally it's hard to find a place that not only cooks the food with just the right taste but presentation is on cue as well. The staff was great from the very second we entered and at the end when we walked out. One thing that I really enjoyed is they wait on you when to bring the next course out for example our appetizers were first than they checked on when to bring out our soups and lastly when to bring out the main dish. Can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"Our favorite local Italian restaurant! The bread and the dipping oil with herbs is just amazing. Hubby and I had about three of their little loaves, thank you very much. Started out with the chicken zucchini flatbread appetizer. It was fresh and delicious. Wouldn't have minded if it was a smidge larger, though. Our beverages were a raspberry Italian soda and some Italian beer on tap - both were great tasting!  I ordered the tilapia for my entrée, and the piece of fish I received was massive. Also I upgraded my side to the fettuccine Alfredo. I was not disappointed. My husband opted for the linguine Pescatore. After placing our order, our super nice waitress, Alli, returned to our table to report that the kitchen did not have mussels for my husband's linguine dish. To compensate for the missing item, he was given extra amounts of shrimp & scallops - score! Since this was a complete splurge meal, we finished off with their Chocolate Dream dessert. Ummm...yum! Great atmosphere, great food, great staff, decent prices. Will definitely be returning. (Just not right away - I'm still trying to burn off these calories....)"}
{"text":"To be honest I wasn't excepting much out of this trip since I am not big on chains. I went with a large group from work and I think most people were satisfied with their meals. I will say they did do a good job serving our large group. I ordered the Caesar salad with salmon since I felt that was a pretty safe think but I couldn't believe for the $5 extra to add the salmon (which made the salad $15!) the piece was so small and pretty dry! Their lunch deals they had were a lot of food and great deal so I would stick with those!"}
{"text":"I will never return service sucked thirty minutes for a drink and the bartender cleaned the bar in my lap.smh"}
{"text":"this place reminded me of a little upper scale macaroni grill.  there's not a whole lot to say about carrabba's.    the oil dipper for the bread was awesome.  the calamari was great.  the salad was good as was the pasta.  i forgot what the noodle was called, but it had chicken, artichoke hearts (which tasted as if from the jar), mushrooms, spinach, and garlic.  i liked it, but i didn't love it.  if i ever end up there again, maybe i'll try something else.    idk what was going on with our server, but if your answer to \"what's the difference between the small and the large pizza?\" is...\"the size,\" you better go re-study the menu or something.  our server reminded me a little of daria.  all i could hear was \"la-la-la-la-laaaaa.\"  i should've known right away when i saw her eric cartman (south park) tie [-____-]"}
{"text":"Took my wife to celebrate her birthday  Despite being crowded, it was worth the wait ! Good food, generous portions and she LOVED the birthday desert!"}
{"text":"My favorite chain restaurant.  It's a little pricier than most chain food, but the quality makes it worthwhile.  The food is consistently excellent.  My favorite dish is the Spiedino Di Mare - shrimp and/or sea scallops coated with Italian breadcrumbs, grilled and topped with lemon butter sauce.  It's consistently delicious.  I have also tried their combination chicken platter (3 chicken breasts prepared with three unique recipes), the roasted chicken (sounds boring, but it's very good), and the lobster ravioli, and all the dishes are very good.  The salads and bread are also very good.  One word of warning - I have heard a complaint that the serving sizes are not very big.  Personally, I do not agree, and I have never left hungry even though I usually do not order a dessert.   Also, I have always found the service to be friendly and attentive.  If you have not tried Carrabba's, give it a shot."}
{"text":"I came to get a quick dinner with a friend and catch up. I have been to Carrabba's (Savannah, GA) once before, but I don't remember it being this terrible.   The service was your standard big box restaurants...not much to write home about. What got me was the actual food, it was too salt to eat... The spinach sauteed in olive oil was too salt to eat! The night's special, Chicken Sorrentino was somewhat hard to eat. It was roasted chicken with what seemed to be microwave heated prosciutto (!!!) with American cheese melted on top...it was unappetizing to say the least. I was really trying to look at the good of this dish, but it was a no go...  I will never eat here again."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful experience! FANTASTIC service by Casey, she was on top of everything during our meal. Great food, I would recommend."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my lunch at Carrabas today. The ambiance, food, and service here is excellent. We had a side salad and turkey sandwich with garlic mashed potatoes. I especially loved the wonderful croissant with honey butter that came with the salad. You will not be disappointed with your visit to Carrabas."}
{"text":"Wonderful soup and pasta!  I was thrilled to try their Spicy Sausage and Lentil soup.  It was so yummy and so healthy too.  The warm sliced bread was plentiful and Melanie, my waitress, brought Italian dipping sauce with it.  She met my every need and my iced tea was never empty. The seasonal entree was Cavatappi Franco (spiral pasta).  Ingredients off the menu:  Cavatappi pasta with wood - grilled chicken, mushrooms, sun-dried tomatoes, broccoli and Kalamata olives in garlic and olive oil topped with ricotta salt cheese $12.99 I can't say enough good things about the entree.  If you're a Kalamata olive fan then you'll like how they blend in with the mushrooms but when you bite one you get that wonderful burst of flavor. I wanted to try desert but had no room.  I have enough leftover for lunch. I'm coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"I have to say, this Carrabba's is the BEST!!  My husband and I would never have thought that Carrabba's would be one of our very favorite restaurants, but it is!!!  Since it has been remodeled, we've really enjoyed the ambiance!  The menu is great and food is consistent!!  We love consistency!!  No egocentric chef trying a new twist to outdo himself!  We go out to eat quite a lot.  We have favorite restaurants, but they are sometimes inconsistent.  If we like a dish, then we want it the same way each time!  We recently tried a new upscale Italian restaurant in Uptown Charlotte.  The decor was nice, but the food was horrible!!  My husband and I said we would have had a much better meal if we were at Carrabba's! . No kidding!!  We like sitting at the bar at Carrabba's.  Great bar, great lighting, great staff, great music!!  Frank Sinatra, Tony Bennett...great music!!  We're from CA and this bar reminds us of one of our favorite restaurants in Santa Monica, CA!  Who knew??!! If you can't decide where to eat, give this Carrabba's a try!  We really enjoy it!!"}
{"text":"We eat out a lot as a family.  This location has always delivered excellent meals with exceptional service.  Choose this group as you won't be disappointed in the service or food."}
{"text":"The only reason I can't give this place 5 stars is because a few visits ago we had a really bizarre experience with the waiters. Our waiter was training a new waitress but the only time he came to our table  was in the middle of our meal when leaned a little too far over the table to say \"oh by the way she is in training\" before walking away... He did not ask how we were doing, if we were enjoying our food or how we felt the new waitress was doing. (she was great by the way). We did not go back for a while after this.   The last time we went back was phenomenal, I don't remember the woman who waited on us but she was so great we called the manager over to compliment her. The dining area was very busy and she stayed very calm and was on top of her tables the entire night.   We even told her, we were not in a rush and would take our time with the menu do she didn't have to wait on us beck and call. We like to longer a little a little bit when dining out. Especially at a place like carrabas which is usually out of our price range. She still refilled our drinks in a timely matter and made sure we were comfortable.   We really like the food, usually we always get the steak and chicken combo and order a side of ceasar salad. (love ceasar salad!)   The last time we called ahead they said they  do not offer reservations, but they have a call ahead list which puts you ahead of those who are walking in. Just call to let then know you are on your way. This comes in handy when they get busy and you do not want to wait 40 minutes to be seated."}
{"text":"We love Carrabba's and eat here at least once every few weeks. Way better than any of the other local Italian restaurants. The zucchini fritti is a must as a starter. The garlic aioli they serve it with is delicious, and you might find yourself dipping your bread in it too. Their soups are also great. Their fillet Marsala is one of the best steaks I've ever eaten. I don't think we've ever had a bad meal here. Make sure you save room for the chocolate Sonjo (spell check). One of the best desserts we've ever had."}
{"text":"I thought I was treating my son to an upscale restaurant for his 20th Birthday so I chose Carrabba's because of the Yelp recommendations I had read.  I have NEVER been so disappointed, insulted and humiliated!!!  Instead of treating him like a king on his birthday we were insulted with stingy portions of mediocre food at extreme prices. Now all my son will remember from turning 20 is the awful pitiful meal he had and how upset I was that we were ripped off.     I counted SEVEN lobster raviolis on my son's plate. The Ravioli was priced at $17!!!  He's over 6 feet!   augh! I could see his face drop when they placed it in front of him and I knew he would be mortified if I said anything.  The birthday treat was LITERALLY in a shot glass.  We've gotten birthday treats over the years on our special out to eat days and NEVER have I been so insulted to see such a miniscule offering.  I ordered Caesar Chicken Salad and got about 7 pieces of chicken on top of a head of lettuce.  I could not believe how STINGY the portion sizes were especially since I had ordered the same thing the day before at Native New Yorker and was stuffed to the gills and so delighted with the variety of lettuce and veggies along with the chicken.  When I called the manager after I got home, she balked at refunding my money because I had only written a comment on the receipt instead of confronting them there then even though I told them I didn't want to upset my son.  She also defended the portion size saying that people complained about too much food.  Then why not reduce the price too if you serve petite portions?    I have NEVER written a food review before.  I probably never will again.  I can't tell you how hurtful a dining experience this turned out to be.  Thanks for nothing Carraba's."}
{"text":"Came here with my mom for last minute dinner and drinks. We had a short wait as we didn't have a res. we were immediately brought dipping oil and bread, which was delicious, and Ice water. Soup was a lil on the salty side but still good. Penne Franco was pretty good but I could easily make at home, and sangria was my fave part. Server was very nice and friendly, let me do linguine instead of penne, and took dish back for more garlic oil when it was a lil too dry. Can't remember what my mom had but we were sharing for awhile and hers was pretty yummy too, with the chicken a lil on the over cooked side. In the end we had an amazing time (server had fun with us) and we would come again, but not for authentic or unique food."}
{"text":"Service was good. Very expensive though food was a little dry and portions were small. Probably won't be going back there."}
{"text":"I highly encourage everyone to give Carrabba's a try!  Yes, it is a chain and you can find one in every major city, but if it's good food what does it matter?!?!  This isn't your local Olive Garden by any means.  I'm a big fan of the Chicken Bryan!  I've always had great service at this location and the seasonal specials add a pretty good mix to the menu.  I recently tried a seasonal cedar plank salmon that made me wanna order a second round!    I do not recommend the curb side to go ordering here.  They seem to be in a bit of a hurry and on more than one occasion I've gotten my go to Bryan to go on my lunch break only to tear into undercooked chicken.  No bueno.  Eat in or move on."}
{"text":"Well, we had to go here eventually, but we weren't planning on going last night. It was a Monday and we had a shiny BOGO coupon for Brixx and I was looking forward to getting my pizza on. Unfortunately Brixx has been closed down for the past week for renovations and failed to mention it on their website. So the miss' quickly looked through her collection of coupons/Groupons and realized we still had a gift card for Carrabbas. Since it's less than a minute drive from our apartment, we figured we would go there and get it over with.  It was quite dead when we arrived, and we were greeted and seated in no time at all. Our waitress was very friendly and constantly checked on how we were doing. She took our drink orders (house wines at $5.50 each) and returned with them and bread. The bread was hot and fresh out of the oven...in fact it was so hot you couldn't touch it initially! I did love that they bring over a plate of herbs and olive oil for the bread as opposed to lame ol' butter...I LOVE an oil/herb mixture with my bread!  We decided to split two different meals for dinner, so that we could have a full-on taste of each. We ordered the lasagna ($14.00) and the linguine pescatore ($16.70.) The lasagna was surprisingly good, for a chain restaurant that is. It was extremely cheesy and made for quite a filling meal on it's own. It's a good thing we split it with the pescatore which was a lot lighter. It consisted of linguine pasta with shrimp, scallops and mussels. We each had two scallops and three shrimp and my wife noshed up all mussels, so you got a decent amount of seafood with the pasta. I wasn't all that crazy about the sauce though, as I was hoping for something a bit more spicy.   The great service and decent food means that I wouldn't dread returning here. Then again, the decent food means I'm in no rush to come back. It's not a horrible chain restaurant, but it's still a chain at heart."}
{"text":"For those familiar know it's a chain restaurant's the great part is it doesn't have that cookie cutter feeling of mediocrity from most other chain establishments. This is the second Carrabba's I have been to  and have to say you get the feeling you r patronage counts. This is what usually separates smaller owner operated establishment .   As from atmosphere it's warm and comfortable, the the staff are accommodating .   As usual I take my position at of near the bar, get a feel of the area especially when in a new city.The bartender was both knowledgeable and helpful with the menu and local questions , including local brews.   Over all food price and portion size more than win , and should be a lesson to other chain restaurants that a good night out and good service are far better advertising that corny ads and jingles on TV and radio"}
{"text":"Once again I am impressed with the food! Went to dinner last night and sat in my favorite booth in the cozy bar area, never liked sitting in the main dining room as it can get a bit noisy. I always order the same thing and I'm never disappointed. The breaded scallops are large and in Charge! Haha! For 20$ they serve 8 large scallops with a side and soup/salad and warm fuzzy bread! Simply stuffed and wanted to lay down after the meal...comfort food is relaxing and my belly was happy. I would suggest to go during a weekday as the weekends sometimes there's a wait. Me? Oh Yea I'm always going back for the scallops!"}
{"text":"We walked in for lunch today because everything is closed on Mondays. Our server was friendly and attentive, I think everyone giving 1 star reviews are coming in at dinner and getting crappy service/food. Maybe wiser to come in for lunch.   We both ordered the half sandwich and soup/salad lunch combo. We both ordered the spicy Sicilian chicken soup.. I got the Chicken Bryan sandwich while the the bf ordered the chicken parm sandwich. I docked a star because it took an insane amount of time for the food to come out. But, we were extremely happy when it did. The half sandwiches were both delicious(and on the smaller side) and the soup was out of this world good. I took the sandwich home and devoured the crap out of that soup. Had a great kick and was very hearty. Good amount of veggies and chicken. I didn't feel guilty eating it either since it wasn't cream based.   Spicy Sicilian Chicken Soup, I'm coming back for you but, only at lunch and dinner takeout tho."}
{"text":"Wonderful Pre Mothers Day dinner wife my lovely wife and two daughters. Our waiter Dominic was friendly and helpful recommending the delicious Sangrias and attending to details that kept us all smiling. The Chicken trio special I ordered was delicious and included chicken Marsala, chicken Bryan, and my favorite chicken Santa Maria-Wow. My daughters are vegetarian and vegan and really enjoyed their pasta dishes as well as soup and salad. No complaints here as we were all very happy with our dining experience."}
{"text":"Took my mama here for her birthday dinner last Saturday evening.  They don't take reservations, but they have this call ahead system, so once you arrive you don't have to wait long.  I definitely recommend doing this, as it seemed like the wait could take a while.  We waited about 10 minutes to be seated.  Our server was fantastic and very attentive.  I always had a new diet coke before my other one was empty.  My mama's water glass was always topped off.  The server also brought out a complimentary dessert with a candle and sang happy birthday with me!  The food was just okay to me.  It wasn't stellar, but wasn't bad.  The bread came out hot and fresh and the dipping spices with EVOO was great.  I ordered a pizza from their wood-fired oven and while the crust was great, the middle of the pizza was kind of soggy.  It wasn't bad, just not great.  I would definitely try something different in the future.  My mom ordered the chicken parmigiana.  It comes with a side and my mom chose mashed potatoes.  We both expected that the chicken would sit atop a bed of noodles, but apparently that has to be your side for it to be so?  I'm not sure, but it just looked silly on the plate like that.  I tried a bite and the chicken was really good.  What really stood out, though, was the dessert.  The complimentary dessert we received was two scoops of vanilla Bluebell ice cream (which our server claims you can only find in Texas and Carrabba's restaurants, but I think I've seen it in grocery stores before..) with candied pecans and a caramel-y kind of sauce.  It was outstanding!  Perfect for my mom too, since she loves pecans.  Overall, I'd rate the service a 5, dessert a 5, and the food a 3.  There's definitely better Italian food at non-chains, but it's still not a terrible option."}
{"text":"I've given this Carraba's 2 tries!!  Food is not standard quality and service is awful."}
{"text":"Had dinner delivered via Postmates. Ordered the chicken fettuccine Alfredo and mozzarella sticks as an appetizer. The food was good, not great but good, a bit cold but otherwise OK. First time trying this establishment will definitely give it a second chance"}
{"text":"Horrible food, great service!  I love a good salad, but this one was not the quality I was expecting from a restaurant.  Rather, it tasted like a salad from the bag you can buy at the grocery store.  Which is fine, but I could have saved myself time and money if I wanted to eat a bagged salad.  The main dish was horrible.  It tasted frozen and the marinara tasted like the kind you buy from the grocery store.  Which jar marinara is good, but once again, if I wanted this quality of food, I would have gone to the grocery store and made dinner myself.  I have had better Italian food from a microwave dinner.  This was very disappointing, because this was my husband's and I first date night since having our baby.  Don't waste your time and money coming here."}
{"text":"We had  dinner here this evening and it was great. The service was awesome our server Chelsea was the best! She offered great advice on drinks as well as dinner choices and they were good all excellent choices.We have never been disappointed when we have came here."}
{"text":"Ate here with my family. The prices are a bit high in my opinion. For being a chain restaurant it's on the higher quality of restaurants. The dining area is very modern and cool looking. The waitress was friendly. I enjoyed my meal here."}
{"text":"This place used to be sooooo good.. !! the chicken still is for the most part. but i am VERY Disappointed  in the dinner salad ( the one that comes with ur entrée . a few years ago that was main reason i came here. It was wonderful and so were your croutons, now the dinner salad is a pile of shitty chopped scatter . No croutons anymore =(  It just kind of sucks..  One more thing i CANT STAND it when i am sharing a salad with my friend and you guys bring it out divided into two plates.. please dont do that unless i ask you.. thanks =)  pollo maria is the best!"}
{"text":"The staff was very friendly here but I'm not real fond of the food. My spaghetti was a bit bland. Some of the other the food choices were ok but not very creative. I went for my birthday so they did give me a yummy dessert.  It's an ok place but just not my favorite."}
{"text":"+This experience wasn't great. The waiter forgot the oil for the bread for the first half of the night. We were served a white and brown/red salad. Seriously, not a single green leaf and several were already old and had gone bad. I was surprised the waiter even served it to us as it was obviously not acceptable. We had to ask to get a new one. When we got our food I was disappointed again because my food was only slightly warmer than room temperature."}
{"text":"Always loved Carraba's! Most chains don't do consistency this well. We went on Saturday night for a late Valentine's day follow-up. The food was great. The service was also speedy and friendly. I LOVE their chocolate layer mousse thing. Just do it! Overall great experience."}
{"text":"Awesome spaghetti and calamari! Zack was very helpful.  Awesome service very attentive to details."}
{"text":"We eat here several times a year, it's one on my wife's favorite places to eat. The starter of bread and oil is very good, the food is above average, however,the price is high for what you get. The environment is very nice and always pleasant. The staff has always been very helpful and willing to assist."}
{"text":"Went for a late dinner.  I've been a fan of this chain for years. I was surprised it was still so busy at almost 8pm (I know, 8pm isn't late, but it is when you're used to eating with your kids at 6) ! We were seated right away even though it was busy, but the service was a little on the slow side after that.  That usually doesn't bother me though, I see it's busy and we weren't in a hurry. We split one meal, and they were kind enough to bring it out on separate plates. LOVE the Chicken Bryan, it's the only thing I've ever had to eat there besides the Lobster Ravioli, which is also excellent."}
{"text":"Oh man, Carrabba's isn't as great as I remembered.  I've been eating at Carrabba's for the past twenty years (at the locations in Houston).  This was my first time trying the Carrabba's in Chandler and it was a letdown.  First of all, they don't have the seafood pasta that used to be my favorite dish (scallops, shrimp and mussles in a spicy marinara sauce).  Secondly, when I got my salad it was TOO COLD.  This sounds like a weird complaint, but it was so cold that it was unappetizing.  Some pieces of the lettuce were actually frozen!  It was also DRENCHED in Caesar dressing.  Third, portion sizes left a bit to be desired.   The best parts about the meal was the bread with olive oil dipping sauce and the Shrimp/scallop linguine entree was pretty tasty but nothing spectacular.  The scallops were actually pretty tiny...  Not sure why this location isn't as good as the restaurants in Houston, but I probably wouldn't be back here.  Immediately after I left I thought, Oregano's would've been better!"}
{"text":"I just love this Carraba's on South Blvd. This is by far my favorite location. There is almost never a wait for a table. This also makes for great service. My favorite meal is the calamari, salmon with lemon butter sauce, side cesar salad, and most of all the blackberry sangria."}
{"text":"My first time here I came for an elite Yelp event. Never really consider this a restaurant I would patronize. But it's actually good for a corporate restaurant. Has an excellent daily happy hour from 4 to 6:30. Drink specials and half price appetizers. All the food came out fresh and hot and prepared to order. The wait staff is attentive friendly and nice and there to help and assist in any way. We'll be coming back to try other items."}
{"text":"First time going last night, and I enjoyed it.  Our server was knowledgeable, they had a great wine selection and the food, for the price, was great.  NEED ONE IN CALIFORNIA!! :)"}
{"text":"We love Carrabbas.  This is our staple go to at least once every few months.  The food is always fresh and cooked to order.  It always tastes great.  For the price, the amount of food you get is great.  The ambiance is perfect, and our three year old loves it too."}
{"text":"I've heard such amazing things about Carrabba's, so I expected the dinner to be fabulous.  Unfortunately, the food was only so-so.  The server was great and very attentive.  There was only a minute wait at 9 pm on a Saturday night, which was awesome!  Overall, it was okay.  But, I doubt we will be back... I can make dinner at least as good at home for a whole lot cheaper."}
{"text":"I have been to other Carrabba's before so I am familiar with their food.  Although the prices are on the upper end of my scale, the food is delicious.  The service at this Carrabba's was great.  My wife and I got the house margaritas for happy hour and they were fantastic.  A dinner of calamari, chicken parmigiana and prosciutto-wrapped pork tenderloin made for a wonderfully tasty meal.  I also enjoyed that each salad was custom made to match the dressing you chose.  My wife's Italian dressed salad had different ingredients than my house Parmesan dressed salad.  Despite the high prices, I am giving them five stars because I am never disappointed by the food or service at this chain.  Bon appetit!"}
{"text":"Order Fettuccine Carabba with no peas.  Fresh bread is always yum with your pasta. First time having lunch here. It is perfect as it is not as busy and easy to chat and relax without the noise"}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars, I would. The waiters were great, which I guess deserves a star, but there was one manager, Lindsay, and she was so rude to everyone on the staff. She obviously doesn't care for her employees, which is upsetting to see, because I used to have a job where the manager was very rude to everyone working there, even though we all worked as hard as we could, and seeing the manager act the same way here left a bad taste in my mouth. And it's so hot in there, they don't turn on the AC, which is just not going to work for me with our summer heat."}
{"text":"One word: Cockroach  My last visit to Carrabba's was for dinner. To be fair, this was five months ago. While eating appetizers/salads, I noticed a cockroach on the wall behind me and I killed it with my dinner napkin. When I (naturally) brought this to the manager's attention, I was astonished to behold a rather cavalier attitude about it. Mind you, this was during peak dinner hours and the restaurant was packed. Cockroaches are somewhat elusive creatures so I can only infer that there is quite an issue with them here. I didn't want to disturb other diners or cause a spectacle at all but it is constructive to bring such a thing to a manager's attention. I think we can all agree on that.  I was respectful and discreet. The manager stated he was going to call the exterminator and requested my phone number and address. We never heard back. Crickets.   We left and didn't bother with our entrees that just showed up. The manager didn't charge us for the salads/appetizers that were half-eaten given the irrefutable proof of the dead cockroach in my napkin. We went next door to Charleston's and had a good meal. I tipped the waiter at Carrabba's 20% of the (anticipated) bill because he handled the situation with class but I can't say the same for the manager.    This was my third trip to Carrabba's and I thought the food is pretty good for a chain restaurant but I haven't been back since, obviously. I don't relish Cockroach as an ingredient in my food."}
{"text":"It's like the minor league version of good steakhouses. Let's get serious...we all go there for the free bread.   The service here is solid, though."}
{"text":"Maybe it's been a while since I last stepped foot into a Carrabba's or something but this place makes me, a 5'0\" gal, feel like a giant.    After being given our beeper/pager/thingie for our table [10-15min wait at 7PM on a busy Saturday night], I managed to get the top of my riding boot caught in the stupid bench twice and bump my head on the trim of the window.  Is this how you normal height people feel?  Anyways, more boot-catching-on-seats-action followed as we were seated in the tiniest booth ever.  I was sitting on one side with my gal friend, who's about the same height and weight as me, while my brother had the other side for himself.  During the whole meal, we were bumping into each other and it's hard to imagine how two people can sit on one side of a booth comfortably.  It's a surprise how I even ate when I was curled up against her the whole time!  Anyways, while I seldom review bigger chain restaurants, I really just wanted to say that Carrabba's has delicious food but I think their portions shrank... A LOT.  I had my fill of warm toasty bread with herbs and olive oil, a nice steamy bowl of sausage and lentils soup, and then had the tiniest plate of shrimp and scallops linguine alla vodka.  I'm not a big eater by any means but I somehow found myself in front of an empty plate with a hungry tummy.    It tasted amazing, so much more than my brother's lobster mac and cheese and my friend's champagne shrimp and scallop linguine, but it was ridiculously small.  I know I look pretty young but seriously, it was like a kid's sized meal and considering that I was carded when I ordered my Limoncello and Prosecco drink, which tasted more like cranberry juice than anything, I'm definitely an adult.  $23/pp including tip for three entrees, one alcoholic beverage, and a lemonade.  Not sure I'd be back even though they have decent flavor.  Pity... I do love their sausage and lentil soup!"}
{"text":"I went Sept 25 for their Monday night $12.99+ specials, with a MeetUp group of 20 people turnout in their party room.. Everyone said they really liked their food. I got the veal marsala for $18.99, with half order of calamari and soup. The pasta sauce (creamy tomato) was really tasty, recommended by Julian, my server who remembered me from the Yelp event and even told me where I sat on a Yelp Elite day, about three weeks before, which is how I came to know this restaurant. Julian was such a terrific server! Like I was the last person to leave, I sat there alone still eating the bread and very garlicky olive oil, which I told Julian was soooo good, I didn't want to leave it behind to be thrown away. In 10 seconds, Julian plopped another basket of paper wrapped bread and another plate of olive oil for me to enjoy. I took it home and had it for dinner to night. Sooooo good!  In the near future, am going to host a Carrabbas Monday night event for my other MeetUp called Wild Dining, that now has 3600 members."}
{"text":"I initially came here for a Yelp Elite event and HAD to bring my husband back to try the food at Carrabba's (which I continue to fail to pronounce correctly - Carrabarras isn't right, huh?).  This time around, we got a bottle of red wine and started with a crock of mussels, which were cooked in a buttery sauce that coincidentally tasted great when soaked in the provided fresh-baked bread.  I probably could have stopped after that, but I then proceeded to devour a gigantic and delicious Caesar salad (that side salad could have been a meal on its own) and the Chicken Bryan, which I had sampled before and was just as good the second time around.  If you've never had Chicken Bryan before, it's a perfectly-cooked chicken breast with goat cheese and awesome toppings.  Sounds weird, tastes great.  I also tried a bite or two of the salmon (killer) and my husband's seafood noodle dish, which was also very tasty.  Our kind waiters pretty much had to roll me out the door, I was so stuffed.   Can't wait to come back again!"}
{"text":"It's taken me a week to write this review due to a hectic schedule. Haylee, our hostess, Jada B, our server, and the manager Rhonda made our 7th Anniversary extra special. My hubby suggested Carrabba's for dinner. The evening surpassed our expectations. The service was outstanding. The food was delicious and so filling. We will definitely be back. I gave 5 stars because there was nothing off with our experience. I forgot about our amazing complimentary dessert until I looked at the pictures."}
{"text":"Stephanie at the bar is an amazing bar tender. She's so friendly. Plus, you can always count on great food here. She knew the wine and recommended the perfect bottle."}
{"text":"This is a neighborhood restaurant and while it is a chain we enjoyed it immensely. Great specials and great and friendly service We will be back"}
{"text":"We love this place. Definitely something for everyone!  Our son enjoys the calamari.  Our daughter fills her appetite with penne.  My husband likes their cesaer salad and chicken bryan.  I divulge in their tiramisu.    Although it was a rough start, they staff and exceptional food makes up for it. The Manager is top notch, and our waiter, Spencer went above and beyond to make sure we were taken care of.   We definitely will be back. So should you..."}
{"text":"Slightly hidden by the car dealerships but has been a great casual Italian dining choice for years. The service has always been consistent whether sitting at the bar or at a table. Happy hour prices are great on appetizers. The bartender didn't mention it and I didn't ask but it was half off so I had no complaints with my bill. I really like the antipasti plate(calamari was blah but marinara made up for it) . The steak flatbread was kinda blah. This last time I didnt have any entrees but you cant go wrong with any of the signature chicken dishes."}
{"text":"Gluten free,YES.The most extensive gluten free menu I have ever seen. Boots of choices including 2 kinds of soup,lettuce wraps,pasta,shrimp scampi and many chicken dishes. Dinner was excellent. The manager Kyle came over to check with us even though they were very busy. He ordered me a sample dish of gluten free pasta to try. It was quinoa based a very very good. Our waiter was excellent in his service. We will for sure  be eating there again, highly recommend."}
{"text":"I'm really disappointed. The experience was really bad. The food was under-seasoned. I prefer Olive Garden over Carrabba for sure.  I don't think I will come back to this chain."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if it was because it was an unusually slow friday (july 4th weekend) or that they had an off day.  Our food was just alright, it was hot and cooked properly, but nothing was really that great that we wanted to ever go back.  We got the chicken marsala and the prosciutto wrapped shrimp and they were both  underwhelming.  The bruschetta we got was also just okay and nothing that I will ever crave to go back to.  The service was fine, not terrible, not amazing.  All in all this place was just very \"meh\", we probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Tonight's service was amazing! Ron, our server, did everything possible to accommodate us. We ordered our favorite lobster ravioli and calamari. In addition we tried several different things, such as their shrimp appetizer, lobster mac and cheese, and two types of sirloin. We all enjoyed our meals but, found the shrimp a little heavy on the salt. The peppercorn butter that accompanied my steak tasted similar to franks hot sauce but, had an added layer of flavor. My grandmother ordered the lobster mac and cheese and said it was delicious kept raving about the taste. While my brother didn't stick to the adult menu, he ordered chicken fingers and pasta with marinara sauce. All in all, the service and food were both amazing. The restaurant has really improved in the last year. It's much cleaner, the food is better and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"I ordered take out, my pasta had no sauce.  The salad was good.  My friend ordered the same thing, hers had some sauce.  She also got a surprise in her pasta, a hard pea sized something. Not sure what it could have been.  Again her salad was good."}
{"text":"Went there friday night  it was really poor service rissoto wasn't fully cooked. My wife likes the chicken bryan there but caesar salad was old. Just don't recommend it"}
{"text":"We had a group of five and called ahead to let them know. When we got there they said it would twenty minutes or so. We waited and had drink at the bar, which cost more than at the table. after an hour I ask to speak to the manager who told us they don't have tables for five and were waiting for a larger table to open up. She found a table and seated us and gave us a complementary appetiser.  All this and we still like the food but I also advised her that their Yelp page says they do take reservations."}
{"text":"Carrabba's was nice enough to provide catering at an AAWL (Arizona Animal Welfare League, a no kill animal shelter) volunteer dinner. That gets them an extra star! :)  I'd like to try out one of their restaurants based on their food.  Food was pretty good too given the volume of people served. The  chicken marsala was flavorful, a bit dry, but it is difficult to keep it moist at catering events. The cream mushroom sauce was very tasty also, and helped cover up the minor chicken dryness. Pasta was somewhat overcooked too, probably for the same reason of having to be out so long. Bread to go with the pasta was very good, desserts (cake) were soft with plenty of icing. Overall, pretty good!"}
{"text":"Ok I'm glad I try this place one more time now 5  + we sat at the bar the bartender was super nice we only order the pizza and some wine it was on Wednesday night great deals on that the pizza was delicious and the prosecco perfect I even got mine red chilled yeap now we know is safe to go back thanks mr bartender..."}
{"text":"Be careful if you tip with credit card  waitress stealing money and put more with hope you won't put attention-it's disgusting !!!"}
{"text":"This location in Henderson is my favorite. It's great for a family dinner. Food was very tasty and service was super friendly.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Came in for dinner from out of town in California we have a lot of Olive Garden restaurant comparing the food from both Carrabba's gets four stars the Olive Garden only two tried several dishes here and the flavors is very good enjoyed my dinner the service is top notch !"}
{"text":"Pumpkin & Squash raviolis were lukewarm to cool, and I doubt they were supposed to be.  Hate it when that happens, especially when the first half are really warm, then suddenly some cold ones.  Kinda hard to return it then.  Good bread.  Service was fairly good, with polite & better trained servers than most places.  Prices reasonable too.  Not a long wait.  Decent parking.  Would be nice if Minestrone wasn't chicken based too."}
{"text":"The service here was very bad the waitress didn't know what she was doing I ordered da steak which was very very bad I couldn't chew it da owner came by and ask if everything was alright no it wasn't first off da steak was terrible drinks took forever I had to get da drink myself I will never come back to this place as I walk out da cook called me a asshole customers I wasn't da only one complaining there were a lot of people doing d a same I guess carabas means bad service I'd give it no stars"}
{"text":"Carrabba's is our go to chain Italian restaurant.  Food and service is consistently good.   We like it much better than Olive Garden or Romano's.  Some of my favorites are the sirloin steak, pork chops and the Johnny Rocco salad.  I think it is the wood-fire grill that really makes the steak and chops so tasty.  The salad is loaded with shrimp and scallops and a tasty  Italian vinaigrette dressing.  The crusty warm bread served with entrees is very tasty with the olive oil and spices served with it.  We belong to the dine rewards program.  When you dine at either Carrabba's, Outback or Bonefish grill you get credited for a visit.  Every 4th visit you get 50% off your bill up to $20 maximum.  You even get credit for to go orders.  Great deal."}
{"text":"My review for this restaurant is 3 stars. Why? we had dinner on dec.9 2015 around 5pm party of 6. The food is great but my dish was a bit salty. Also we felt like we were being rushed. Our salads and soups came and half way through our side dishes our entrees came. Then our server had asked us if we wanted desserts half way through our meal. Then suddenly our bill came right after. There were 3 of us still eating at this time. Didn't give us a chance to decide if we really wanted dessert and coffee. Yes we did say we were fine on dessert but didn't mean we wouldn't change our mind on having dessert and coffee or tea. So on this note we felt like we were definitely being rushed so she may turn her tables. Being in the service industry for over 15 years you should never rush your guest/ customers when eating. I recommended this place to my God father do to a wedding celebration and the quality of the food. We felt so rushed that we were on a time frame to eat and go. I personally when I go out to dinner in any restaurant in town or anywhere in general, I like to take my time, enjoy my meal and the company of others with out being rushed. I'm sure not every server in this restaurant rush there guest so the table can be turned. I understand you need to turn the table but don't make your guest feel rushed instead they should feel they are welcomed. I believe our servers name was Heather P. I'm writing this review not to get some one in trouble but to make them realize that rushing your guest is more likely not to come back sooner than expected and or recommend the place to their friends family also tip would be lower. I would of gave them a 5star if we were not rushed if we were on a time frame We would of just ordered the food to go.. Over all food is as good as I remember years ago but our service just lacked a bit on paying attention to their guest."}
{"text":"My stepdad and I ate here a few weeks ago, and I've been meaning to give a 5- star. Our server Brittany was awesome. She gave us great service and  was great to talk to. The food was also excellent. Pasta done perfectly, even in the soup. The staff who brought the soup and salad were very warm as well. We will be back and will definitely ask for Brittany. Thank you!"}
{"text":"When it comes to food, generally I try and go down the path unknown and try something new when dining at a restaurant I have been to a few times. When it comes to Carrabba's through, I stick to my personal favorites:   -Calamari Ricardo (think calamari with herbs and spices and an  amazing garlic/butter dipping sauce) -Spendino di Mare: a lightly breaded and fried combination of scallops and shrimp.   Plus the bread they serve the table is awesome when you dip it in the oil/pesto mix they set on the table for you."}
{"text":"I ordered take out the other night through the online ordering. The ordering system was seamless and user friendly. When i came in the staff was extremely accommodating and they wanted to ensure my order was precise before leaving. I ordered the Chicken Bryan which was perfectly cooked even after the 20 minute commute home.  My meal was delish, then again anything with Goat Cheese is a hit in my book. I also ordered a shrimp special that was served in parchment paper. The paper kept flaking on to the food, but the taste was good , but it was a pain to eat around. I do plan to try other things here."}
{"text":"Ate here a week ago and it was great!  Service was quick and friendly, no issues about not putting cheese on my food/in my food.  I had the chicken Bryan without goat cheese and cavatappi in plain marinara.  Both were good.  My daughter had spaghetti and meatballs and loved it.  My father had the sausage and cheese stuffed mushrooms, and enjoyed it.  Love coming here when I'm home!"}
{"text":"It was my first time here, I just wish that there were more options for lunch. I loved how they bring you bread and oil with herbs, it was a great atmosphere and our server was great."}
{"text":"Went to a tasting of new menu items for their club members. I hadn't been here before, and the first thing I noticed was how dark it was inside.  Strike 1.  But the free tasting overrides the strike.  They had 2 long tables set up right up front for the tasting. I didn't know what to expect, this being my first tasting. I did bring a guest and we were both impressed that they were serving wine. Red wine only, but still. Our first course was risotto balls with marinara sauce which were very good. Then we had a large, yummy Caesar salad that was one of the best I've had in a while. There was plenty of wine going around too. We sampled 2 entrees- Mahi Wulfe and Pollo Caprino. Both were very good, and the standout was the goat cheese in the chicken dish. We both enjoyed both entrees, and they gave us generous portions. For dessert, we had their signature brownie with whipped cream.  I'm not a chocolate fan, but this was a good brownie. We asked for coffee with dessert, and they have excellent coffee! Color me impressed! Try the new menu items with a Caesar salad."}
{"text":"There is a Carrabba's in Matthew's that is always packed.... this one on South didn't seem the same (maybe cause it was a Sunday night) but the food was good.  Service was a little slow, but our server said it was his 5th day there - he did a good job.  I had the small chicken marsala with green beans (the vegetable of the day).  it was just the right size and it also came with a side salad (or soup).  I over indulged on the bread and olive oil though... good thing we walked here so we walked some of it off after eating."}
{"text":"Haven't eaten yet. Wait times and waiting area are terrible.  Called in and was on hold for 10 minutes after getting bounced around back and forth.  AMENDED  Wait time ended up being 25 minutes.  All nine Entrees were all good.  Service was also very good once we were seated, even though they were busy and crowded."}
{"text":"I definitely love this place, I haven't been here for awhile. Saturday was super busy but since we did the online reservation we didn't have to wait to long. The waiter was very courteous and he to our drink order. As we were waiting for our main waiter to take our order, the same waiter brought our drinks and an order of zucchini fritti. That had to be the best zucchini fritti  I ever tasted in my life, it was so light and airy with the perfect crisp and just plain out delicious.  I found a new favorite appetizer. Now onto the entrees- I ordered the lobster ravioli and absolutely loved the flavor. The sauce was perfect and the ratio was perfect lobster/cheese.  I will definitely order this again.  The atmosphere was very inviting and the servers were very knowledgeable and courtesy. They definitely know how to treat there guest. The prices were decent considering the amount of food they serve and the quality.  The endless bread adds a perfect touch to every dish served"}
{"text":"WTF is a reservation for or calling ahead to hold seating if you have to wait 45 min.?  Just simply state \"we dont take reservations\". Don't set false expectation.  Horrible customer service!!!!!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to this location and honestly haven't been here literally in years, not because I don't like the food just had a bad experience a few years ago. But I have been seriously craving some lasagna so we went. They had there special going on, appetizer or dessert entree and salad or soup. I had the meatball app and honestly I'm not really a fan of meatballs but they were delicious! Salad I forgot the name but it was the Italian dressing  one and it was so good, I loved the little yellow tomatoes and I usually skip tomatoes but decided to try them. Lasagna was so yummy but I literally was so full from everything cause of course I was devouring the bread! This location is clean, bathroom is nice. My waitress I can't remember her name was so awesome, friendly kept our drinks full and made sure we were happy. Definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I have always liked Carrabba's and really have never had a bad meal or service. Went last night after receiving a \"Amore Monday\" email advertising 3 courses for $12.   Arrived around 5:00 and was seated immediately. The Amore Monday menu is a soup or salad, an entree and either an app or dessert for each person (some other places make you share the app or dessert). The 3 courses are $12, $15 or $18 depending on your entree. Of course their wonderful bread and olive oil are included as well.   Our server Eric was great. Very friendly and always checking on us making sure we had full drinks and were enjoying our food.  I ended up ordering the calamari for my app. It said \"small\" portion on the menu but it was not small at all. It was a full dinner plate served with marinara. I also got the Caesar which was very good. Cold and lots of fresh cheese on top.   For the entree I chose the Mahi Wulfe which is Mahi topped with artichokes, sun dried tomato and their lemon butter sauce. This was excellent, bordering on outstanding. It was cooked perfectly, crispy on the outside and moist inside. It is cooked on the oak grill which gave it great flavor. My plate was clean, I was very happy.   I have been going to Carrabbas for years both here and while living in Florida and always enjoy it. It will continue to be one our favorites."}
{"text":"Our visit was right before the dinner crowd rush. It was quite upon arrival and we were quickly seated.   We went with a special that they had for the appetizers (3 for $12) and ordered - stuffed mushrooms, asparagus and lettuce wraps. Those stuffed mushrooms were insanely good.  The mushrooms were not soggy and the sausage on the inside was juicy. The asparagus had a nice crunch and it was prosciutto wrapped so I mean c'mon. The lettuce wraps I would never order again. The meat was cold and I just did not enjoy the flavor at all. They had an oil - I can't remember the name that they gave us to drizzle over the lettuce wraps. The oil itself was good, had a nice kick to it. The server told us it was very spicy and to use it with caution. If you don't eat spicy food I would understand.   My salad was simply and delicious. The veggies were crisp and very fresh. The man had sausage and lentil soup which was also tasty. I almost wish I had gotten soup over my salad. He killed his bowl too - for a man that doesn't care for lentils. He really enjoyed it.   Our food arrived and my pasta was delicious. The man ordered grilled chicken - I can't remember the exact name of what he got but it was really good as well. Just a small portion of chicken breast.  We don't do these kind of chains often but it was nice to know that we could go and get solid eats. Our staff was attentive without being overbearing. They treated my kid like a normal patron and didn't \"kid him down\". So that is always a plus for me. And we all left happy and satisfied. This pushes it to 4 stars for me."}
{"text":"Came here tonight for my Dad's 85th birthday and they treated us like royalty. The food was delicious and the service was outstanding. They gave us a private table in the back room and we had a beautiful evening. Thank you, Carrabba's!"}
{"text":"By far, my most favorite Italian restaurant. Service is awesome.  Bread and dipping oil - yum.  The proscutto wrapped pork tenderloins were scrumptious."}
{"text":"First - Brian is an EXCELLENT Waiter! Wifey & I had a cup of Minestrone soup, the best around. Wifey had Veal Marsala with corkscrew pasta VERY Good and nice portions and I had lasagna which I usually finish but took half home, Excellent.  one Lager and iced tea $45.00. WE WILL RETURN! Right Bernadette Connus!!!"}
{"text":"Robbie was the best server ever, besides the wonderful food Robbie will be the other reason we will return. Thank you Robbie your service was awesome. Johnny & Bryan with a Y."}
{"text":"Two words: Chicken Bryan. You have the key to my heart if you set that plate down in front of me. Chicken Bryan with the sauteed spinach 'n' garlic, and a Caesar salad -- that's weapons-grade awesome right there.   Yes, I've had other dishes here: the rigatoni martino was my favorite for a long time; the mezzaluna is yummy; so is the chicken marsala. I've never had anything bad here.   It's almost worth it to visit for the bread they bring you first. Paired with olive oil and those seasonings, and that's all the tasty appetizer you need.   They have sangria, though I'm always driving and so have never had it (don't drink and drive!). They also have desserts but I'm always too stuffed.   This Carrabba's is one of only a bare few in the Valley - this one is in north Scottsdale at Scottsdale Rd and Frank Lloyd Wright/Bell. Plenty of parking, and outside seating when it isn't too hot."}
{"text":"Our server was not the best.  He did not provide any silverware and we had to ask another server to help.  He did not understand the menu or the wine choices.  He never refilled our water.  He took our bread away prematurely and kept asking my wife if she needed a to go box while she was still eating.  Food was good."}
{"text":"Love this place went trite Friday night with my family. Walk in they were slow so we got right in. Then we sat. 14 min to get a drink another 14 to take the order. The food came some was clod but could we find the server no. Never got a refill on water ice tea and ask for bread that never came.  Sure do not know where the manager was but they might lose a customer.  The best part it took another 10 min plus to get the check once we asked for it.   Hate to see what it will be like in season."}
{"text":"I don't expect a lot from chain Italian restaurants (which begs the question why did I go here...because the place I wanted to go to is closed on Monday) but surprisingly it wasn't horrible.  The wife had Pasta Weesie.  Except for the name, it was actually pretty good although when I tasted it I found the mushrooms in it to be a bit salty.  I had Chicken & Spinach Cannelloni not bad.  As an aside, Cannelloni, normal name for an italian dish as opposed to Pasta Weesie...see was that hard?  For reasons I'm still trying to figure out we ordered Italian Sangria.  First, Weesie pasta and now Italian Sangria.  What's that all about?    But aside from my cognitive dissonance with their naming convention for things on the menu the only thing they should really rethink is the whole Italian Sangria.  Way to sweet and had a weird cinnamon after taste.  Granted cinnamon was one of the ingredients in the drink but between the sweetness and the cinnamon I'll be real happy if I don't end up gacking the stuff back up.  So to summarize, food not bad.  Sangria, something to take a pass on."}
{"text":"I used to go to this restaurant in Florida and loved it, it is also a very popular place there. So I decided to give it a try here in Las Vegas. I ordered fried calamari and my boyfriend ordered spicy chicken wings which were great. My calamari were a little bit dry. I had the same dish at other location and it was dry as well. Probably it has something to do with the recipe. I probably should order something else next time. Everything was reasonably priced and the service was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"I love this place and used to go there when I was in Florida. We went there for their happy hour a couple of weeks ago. My bf's shrimp scampi was delicious. We also got an espresso with whipped cream and it was freshly home made whipped cream. You don't see it too often at the restaurants. The prices are ok too. Excellent service, we were sitting at the bar and our server was super accommodating, friendly and did a great job. The only thing I didn't like is their calamari. They were so much overcooked. Probably the worst I have ever tried. We will definitely come back. Maybe I just will order something else."}
{"text":"Everything was so ON POINT at this restaurant. It reminds me of an 12x upgrade of the Olive Garden. We were at first debating if I wanted to eat at the pizza place across the parking lot but last minute decided to come here. Best decision! I'm quite the critic when it comes to food, service , cleanliness, quality and appearance. We were greeted as we walked in, our waitress was Linda, she is such a sweet lady. I was debating between the lobster ravioli and the tenderloin Marsala, Linda our waitress told me I can get a side of lobster ravioli for couple more dollars to get best of both. They were both so good! The tenderloin was really tender and it just melted in your mouth & very flavorful. Linda came back frequently to check up on us. I was definitely come back if and when I come back to Arizona. (From California)   To all the bad reviews I have written for bad service, they need to get customer service Lessons from Linda. Linda deserves a raise!!   Rating:  Cleanliness 5/5 Customer service 6/5 Food appearance 5/5 Quality 5/5 (way to go cooks)"}
{"text":"We met my son, granddaughter & 2 family friends this evening for my husband's birthday.  The waiter was very good - repeated choices to those who didn't listen :-)  .  However, he served by reaching across each of us - instead of walking behind us to serve each dish.  The fresh herbs in olive oil - yummy.  The calamari was very good.  It felt unsafe that my tilapia was lukewarm ...and my husband's filet looked like a sirloin.  we did appreciate the waiter's attentiveness...even though no staff member ever acknowledged my dear hubby's birthday."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with this place. I had never been so I was excited to try it out.  We made reservations for 6 at 6:30 by phone. Around 3:30 that same afternoon. We arrived by 6:20 to a very crowded place which I took as a good sign meaning people liked the food.  We gave our name and watched the hostess flip through her reservation list only to hear that we were not on their list.  What we were given was a 45 minute wait time.  So not happy that we went elsewhere."}
{"text":"Not bad for what it is. Reasonably priced ok Italian food. Better than olive garden but not a place to go to for really good italian."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place. I usually always get the SIRLOIN MARSALA so we only come here on occasions since it's a little pricier than just a standard night out (but still a good price for steak). But the food is amazing, the bread and dip are delicious, and the atmosphere is not flashy and perfect for dates. I have had the CHICKEN PARMESAN which was tasty too, but I just can't get enough of the marsala sauce. Never have been disappointed here, or any other Carrabbas in fact. A co-worker of mine brings leftovers in to work every so often and it makes my mouth water, even though I would never have thought of that dish as good (egg plant gross). The seasonings make anything seem appetizing. More than enough food at one time so I rarely get dessert, although I never mind that since I am left completely satisfied."}
{"text":"Here with family for New Year's Eve dinner! Ordered the chicken trio, my favorite! Never been disappointed. Also, angel hair pasta in lemon butter it was so good! Enjoyed the Blackberry Sangria the bomb!       Here we are again! One of many! Mother's Day!"}
{"text":"First time ever at Carrabba's & was pretty impressed with this place. The service was great. Very knowledgeable staff  [Alex was very good]. Food was good. I had Chicken Parm & it was extremely tender & good. My wife had the Shrimp & Scallops with Ala Vodka sauce & demolished it. If you have pasta included make sure you ask for extra sauce. The only problem was the linguini was a bit dry. Should've asked for more sauce. The house salad wasn't great. But my wife liked the Caesar. The best part was that we were NEVER RUSHED at all, Sat nite arrived at approx. 5;15. When we left we noticed lobby had about 10 + people, yet they never seemed to push or rush us. Mini Cannolis for dessert were very mini but good.   Also a friendly greeting at door when arriving & leaving. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Love love love this restaurant.  NEVER had a bad meal there. The chicken trio is my favorite. The new trout meal is also delicious. Service is excellent."}
{"text":"Why do I keep allowing myself to be suckered in?  Is it cause I'm lazy some Friday nights?  Tired after a long work week and too over it to get dressed up for an Italian sit down at a decent place or even to walk in somewhere and pick up a to go order?  Fact is, it's all of these things.  Sometimes I just want to order online, pull into the drive up to go slot and have someone bring a bag of Italian food to my window.  Problem is though, every single time I get it home, I start to eat and just go, meh...  Meh-minus most of the time really.  Carrabba's is just not that good and I never, ever learn.    The future will be different though.  There will be no next time.  Yelpers, if you ever see me checked in here after July 1, 2011, please shame me in public.  Make a Yelp list titled biggest dumb asses and post my picture in the #1 slot.  Un-friend me.  Please, do whatever it takes to make me STOP!  Thanks in advance for your caring and concern..."}
{"text":"Carrabba's is my favorite chain restaurant business - PERIOD.  This review is for this location, specifically because I think that the food prepared in this location is better than in other locations.  I eat out a lot and because I love local-fare, chain restaurants are definitely not on my to-eat-lists.   However, this Carrabba's is frequently in my rotation for 2 reasons - #1 I really love a few of their menu items and #2 the service.  So, the food is always good here.  I've never had a bad meal and from my experiences with other Carrabba's across the country, I think this one prepares their food the best.  Now, on to the meat of my review - the service in this establishment is impeccable.  I've gone in here on more than one occasion and ordered things that were not on the menu - if they have the ingredients in house and can make it - its a done deal.  You know how you DVR a show and watch it 3 months later and see a commercial for something \"new\" Carrabba's is serving and get there and it is no longer on the menu?  I can't tell you how often that has happened and how often I was able to get the item prepared for me.  I've been there and had the manager offer to make a shrimp item with the shrimp prepared 3 different ways.  WHO DOES THAT?  I was there for lunch recently with a friend and I overheard a manager telling a customer that this restaurant never had a particular item on the menu, but they have all the ingredients.  He informed her that the dish takes a while to prepare, so if she would call him an hour in advance, he could have it ready for her when they got there.  Uhm... Yeah.  That's  why this Carrabba's gets a 5 star from me.    There are only a select few National Chain restaurants I would choose, this Carrabba's is one of those when I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Tonight was the first time I've ever had Carrabba's. I ordered takeout and ordered the large shrimp Caesar salad and the linguine pescatore . For a large shrimp Caesar salad that cost about $15, I was extremely disappointed in the size. I basically got a small tin full of lettuce, a couple croutons, and 5 very small shrimp - for $15. What a joke! The croutons were chewy - not in a good way, and the size and quality left be desiring more. For the price, I would expect at least 7 jumbo shrimp, higher quality croutons, and a larger size. The linguine pescatore was just as bad. The side Caesar was skimpy, even for side salad standards, The pasta itself seemed like a half order, and it barely had any sauce on it. It LOOKED disgusting...thrown together without any care. Also, my husband said the scallops tasted bad. How this place has any good reviews I do not know. Between the quality and portions, I want to give 0 stars. The ONLY reason I gave it 1 start is because I had to and because the service was fast. However, I wouldn't mind if the service took a little longer if more care went into my food for the price. I honestly think Applebees (a place I don't care for) could do way better. What's going on? New cook? New management? How did this place get 4 and 5 stars by anyone? I'm sorry to say that I will not be returning if this is how it is. I can't believe I'm still as hungry as I am! Well, guess I should start thinking about where I'll be ordering my second dinner from tonight..."}
{"text":"Tremendous service by server Keith and welcoming staff complemented the excellent food we had for an early happy hour meal. Tried the newest dessert item, Apple Crostata tart, to finish it all off. Excellent fall dessert. We love the Tomato Caprese with Fresh Buratta, a generous portion that serves 2-3 persons. Happy hour here 4 to 6:30 is a great value for the best in served foods."}
{"text":"We had 3 appetizers and they were the bomb. Our server was incredibly knowledgeable in how to assist us and gave us great recommendations! We will be back when we have more of an appetite to eat the entrees."}
