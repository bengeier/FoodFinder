{"text":"All I kept hearing from the guests......\"This is the best Funnel Cake I have ever had!!!\"  The fried Twinkies were amazing also.  Joe really made the carnival memorable for everyone.  Very prompt and customer service was amazing.  Thanks again Joe for all your hard work."}
{"text":"Oh, I love me some funnel cake! Both the smell and taste evoke warm memories of my trips to amusement parks, carnivals, and haunted houses during the Halloween season. These guys make regular appearances at Food Truck Friday West, so I decided it was time to get my much-needed fried dough fix.  Sadly, the funnel cake I received was undercooked (or under-fried). The texture was very crumbly and not at all crispy like a well-made funnel cake should be. I'm not sure if this was intentional or if it was just an off night, but it definitely wasn't worth the seven dollar asking price. They offer corn dogs and fried Twinkies here as well, but I'm not sure if those are any better.   Based on my one and only experience, I wouldn't recommend."}
