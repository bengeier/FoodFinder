{"text":"The ambiance is great. They have cool decorations, which are apparently authentic, straight from Morocco. The food taste is not bad - especially the appies are good. The veggies dishes are a bit bland. But the most disappointing part was the prices - it is pretty overpriced. Plus to get customers to come back, they should make the bread free and include the Moroccan tea or coffee as a part of their \"Tour of Casbah\" meal. And, the server just bashed Sultan's Tent completely, which I felt was a bit unprofessional (albeit his passion for Morocco was palpable)."}
{"text":"Zero stars. Booked my brithday here. The waiter (probably the manger also) was so rude!!! Wanted to charge us extra money because we had a big group of people. Which was odd since the place was very slow for a saturday. Don't go here. My birthday was ruined due to this arrogant waiter!!!! I'm so sad  and feel so bad for my friends"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. Once you get down the stairs and through those doors, you're in a whole new world. The decor is grand and beautiful right down to the curtains hanging around each table for extra privacy. The food is amazing! Amazing! If you're ever trying to impress a date I promise this place will do it. Just don't let her order a martini (they don't have a proper bartender...yet)"}
{"text":"This place is so awesome! The atmosphere and food is so authentic (as far as I can tell, I've never been to Morocco so I dont really know). It's so cozy and beautiful as well as romantic as each table has a lot more privacy than regular restaurants. We went for a birthday dinner and they didn't really have a great setup for larger parties but they made it work and for groups of four or smaller would fit perfect. In our group we had a celiac (can't have gluten) and they were super awesome about ensuring that she was taken care of and their menu showed gluten free and vegetarian options with symbols beside the dish. And the food! Oh it was amazing. We all had the tour of morocco (a five course menu) and each course was delicious. I would definitely go back there again and again."}
{"text":"The place has great potential, but currently needs a lot of improvement.  Their food looks good, however the taste is laking in flavor.  The service leaves something to be desired.  Improve your phone and table side service manners and you will go a long way.  Explain your menu to people and you may sell more.  Try not to argue when they wish to sit at a certain table.  Do not give people attitude when they don't have a reservation  on a night when the restaurant is empty.   Will not return, but hope they listen to their customers."}
{"text":"The food is really amazing here and the atmosphere is gorgeous as well. The dishes without the meat are a good size for someone with a smaller appetite. The main dishes are amazing, the meat add ons aren't as good as the main dishes but generally still well done (the chicken is the best!) I would definitely come back to try more of their dishes."}
{"text":"I  have been there before and wanted to make a reservation for 11people for a graduation party, the owner calls me back to tell me he will CHARGE 250$ deposit!! What if our bill is 200$? People are paying for their bills so why charge me??? its not a party of 100! it is sooo ridiculous!! Even high end restaurants do not ask for this stupidity!!! DO NOT GO THERE!!!!!"}
{"text":"The only time I had been in Casbah was years ago watching those braver than I take down flaming shots of liquor.  Now returning about three years later, the Casbah has closed and reopened under much publicized new management.  

Arriving this time for a late dinner we found the place almost entirely empty but still serving food till 10, this gave us the luxury to simply walk around and see all the beautiful designs on each floor.  Along each of the diverse floor settings you can accommodate yourself to your preference.  The main floor has the Moroccan bazaar feeling, with tile tables and a nicely woven-in bar.  The top floor consists of a large dining room prepared more elegantly full ensemble of white napkins.  Finally, the fairly small basement level has several private and romantic booths with raised floors beneath the tables as a gesture to the custom of sitting cross-legged on the floor.  Having done this tradition before, I enjoy the median the Casbah has provided, the sensation of sitting on the floor but having a bottom cushion, more pillows, and easier access to a solid table in front of you.  Often meals from this region are lengthy multiple courses that involve desserts and then coffee so sitting without much support can become uncomfortable or distracting from the food and the experience which is meant to be drawn out and savored.  

Not only is the atmosphere amazing, the food is delightful.  My dish, whose real name I admittedly cannot recall, was lamb with prunes served over rice.  I substituted rice for couscous which I always find rather mundane.  The lamb was very tender and juicy and the combination of that at the prunes was surprisingly delicious.  My partner got a b'stilla, I remember that one, which is a very unique creation.  It's a flakey pie stuffed with shredded meat and vegetables with the outer layer being sprinkled with brown sugar and cinnamon, amazing flavor combination.  The meal also came with a nice soup, a lentil and a chicken and beans both of which were also quite nice.  

Overall, my experience at the Casbah was well-rounded and solid.  With gorgeous dcor and really fresh flavors in exotic dishes.  The service was also quite courteous from host, waitress, manager, even the cook from the behind the bar waived to us.  It was one of the few times I've felt like I was actually being treated, in every sense of the word, to a exquisite meal, as if I was a foreign dignitary.  This brought the whole evening together making the Casbah a truly enjoyable and complete experience.

UPDATE:  I went back to eat here about a year after the above and the food wasn't as fantastical.  Still good but not amazing.   5 to 4 it must go."}
{"text":"Very bad service ,slow and the taste of the food not worst your money. Ripped off. Never go back there again. Only one star for the decoration of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Exteremely over priced food..and AWFUL service..the owner/waiter was rude and extremely full of himself..I only asked him a specific question regarding the sort of juices and his response  was totally inappropriate..horrible experience..needless to say..I'm NEVER going back..there's much better restaurants out there with owners who actually know a thing or two about customer service and aren't complete douche bags."}
{"text":"I made the mistake of sitting in the lower level -- affectionately called \"King Tut's\" on their website.  It's made out to be an intimate place to eat, but really it's a llot like eating in your mom's musty basement.  I kept expecting some creepy crawly thing to scutter out from somewhere.  The whole place just felt damp and icky..

The food was just there.... nothing really too exciting -- and I like Mediterranean food!  I'd much rather go to Kabul over on State or any number of places before heading here again."}
{"text":"Authentic Morrocan flavors, and charming intimate setting.  It is on the pricey side, like most North African restaurants I've been to, but it's a great experience to share with a group of people. This is not the kind of place you go for a quick bite, but rather you make an evening of it, with the rose water hand washing at the table, and the mint tea service to cap off the meal.  Both the tagines and couscouses were well prepared, with the classic mix of sweet spices, and available with a variety of meats. This kind of restaurant is ideal for a group that includes both vegetarians and meat eaters.

Tip: this restaurant has a 2-for-1 Entertainment Guide coupon."}
{"text":"Amazing ambiance and food, one the best restaurants I've ever been to all over the world."}
{"text":"As a huge fan of Mediterranean food, I am disappointed that I will not be going back to the Casbah. This is even more disappointing since this is the only Mediterranean restaurant in a reasonable walking distance from my office for lunch.
 
I have given the Casbah three opportunities to make me a devoted fan. Every time I have placed a to-go order, it has either been the wrong order or on two occasions the chicken was raw."}
{"text":"The ambience is really nice, but service is awful, and food is mediocre. I don't recommend it."}
{"text":"We just ate here last night.  They seemed to be pretty busy - there was a party they were preparing for upstairs.  We were seated in the bar/dining area.  I loved the traditional middle eastern music playing in the background.  The food was good.  The Lamb Kebab was very tender however it didn't seem to be seasoned very much.  I still liked it though and we ate it all along with the rice, vegetables and hummus it came with.  We also had the spinach/lentil soup which was very tangy and reminded me of Gujarati Dal.  The Date Salad was really good too - tangy and sweet.  I also tried one of their red wines from turkey and it went perfectly with our meal.  I'd love to go back and try more food and even catch a belly dance performance!"}
{"text":"Lovely atmosphere, service and the food..... WAY yummmy!!!!!  Mint tea is like manna..... Love this place.... will come again

We did the Tour of morrocco and it was LOVELY!"}
{"text":"Went to Casbah on a recent Saturday night- we were seated upstairs which is a very pretty, well-lit casual space.  My friend and I ordered the vegetarian platter for two- but they were out of tabouli and substituted (something).  The hummus and baba ghanouj were very good, pitas were plentiful, the falafel-pucks were interesting, but overall the quality of the food was mediocre.  Not awful, but not memorable.  Service, though- was memorable and not in a good way.  I get that the building is multi-storied, and maybe that's why it takes so long to get your drinks or more pita, or your check.  

I won't say we'll never be back, I'm just not in a hurry."}
{"text":"Dealfind Voucher Holders BEWARE!

Purchased a Dealfind voucher in 2011.  Ok, granted, I didn't think to use it until now (2014), but the offer stated \"does not expire\", so we called and got reservations.  

We arrive at the restaurant and see a note on the door that the dealfind voucher (that was for a 5 course meal for 2 valued at $114) was only valid for $55 (which is what we paid for the voucher) off our meal.  I said to our server that I was disappointed since it stated that the voucher did not expire.  She wasn't sure about it and went to ask.  

She came back to us with new menus and told us that it was valid, but only for this certain meal.  It was pretty close to what we wanted and since they were honouring the full amount I even ordered an extra glass of wine ($11) and some bread ($5).  When the bill came it was $81.50!  

When we asked why only the $55 was taken off the bill and not the full amount; we were told that you could only use the dealfind voucher for that particular meal and it was still only worth $55 off the bill.  

I have no idea why I keep buying these \"vouchers\" when the business either goes under or doesn't honour it anyway.

I paid the bill and learned a hard lesson.  Go to Sultan's Tent.  Don't even bother with these guys.  They sold us a coupon and what we really got was an expensive meal."}
{"text":"I no longer drink so I can't review the bar area of this establishment but I can certainly say that their food is mediocre and over-priced, the service generally sucks and they seem to run out of food all the time.  On New Years I went with a group and we were seated down below when their heater was broken and it was freezing and they had a special prepared menu and yet several items on there were not available.  And paying for refills on soda is pretty lame.  It's not the worst food I've had in Madison but it's not a place I'd recommend when there are so many outstanding choices in this town that get both the food and the service right."}
{"text":"Tråkigt att ge ett sådant dåligt betyg när alla odds var på Casbahs sida. Lokalen är otrolig, väldigt estetisk och passade temat mycket bra.

Dessvärre kan inte samma sak sägas för maten. Torr och inte speciellt välsmakande. Jag hade höga förhoppningar och de levdes inte upp över huvud taget. 

Servicen var inte heller något att tala om, sällan man fick uppmärksamhet från servitrisen."}
{"text":"Located downstairs.  Heavily decorated with Moroccan curtains, pillows and decor.  Has semi private nooks throughout.  Is a cosy place but elegant.  Great for a date.  It is expensive.  They do have coupons.  The waiters were attentive and polite.  I had the lamb tajine 5 course which was great.  You can order the 5 course set plates which are $50, but it may be better value to order individual plates as the Moroccan couple adjacent us did.  The food was quite good and with foreign flavours and blends of food so be ready for that.  Some servings were mixed with figs others with dates.  We parked on the street.  Server will have you wash your hands at the table.  I love the way they pour the tea!"}
{"text":"I was not familiar with the former incarnation of this place, but it's current rebirth left me unthrilled. I suppose they are still training staff and maybe even short-handed, and it shows. The service was over-burdened. When they flubbed my order -- I said lamb, but chicken showed up -- my dinner companions and I had to wait about 10 minutes until we could tell our server about the mistake. They fixed it quick though -- they just scooped the chicken out and plopped some lamb on top and brought it right back -- easy to tell that when you find some of the chicken you tried to return still sitting in the middle of your couscous! 

The food is average quality, but the presentation is nice, so you may be fooled. My meat was tough, vegetables seemed an after-thought.  This place ain't cheap, so you'd expect a bit more, overall.

This is Madison. There are options, and I' for one would take the dining room of King of Falafel over Casbah any night of the week."}
{"text":"Went to the Casbah tonight with 5 friends and it was simply spectacular.

tried a wide variety of dishes, including Lamb, Beef & Chicken Kabob's which were amazing.

The Pastry rolls, sorry I cannot remember the Moroccan name for them were heavenly and the atmosphere is one of a kind.

I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Yes, the decor was pretty. I think I stated \"It's the perfect temperature in here\" once sitting down. Nice low lighting (everyone looks better in low lighting) and some beautiful music. Menu was nicely planned and was very encouraging. I think I did the Casbah tour?
Upon closer inspection, if you are going to have that many trinkets adorning your walls, please dust them. Eventually my \"perfect temperature\" almost put me to sleep...it took almost an hour for our appetizers to come out, no refill on the water, no offer of another beverage at all. It appeared that there was only one waiter for the entire restaurant, so I give him credit. 
I had high hopes, but once again, blah."}
{"text":"27/30

The shareef may not like it, but I do. Who wouldn't like sitting on fancy silk couches surrounded by golden tapestries, while a waiter comes and washes your hands with rosewater? He'll tell you stories of Morocco, you'll sip on mint tea with a cinnamon stick and orange slices and discover eating with your hand is a breeze. That's one hand (and make sure it's your right), not plural; it's a Tajine, not a trough ;). Also, don't use your entire hand. Your pointer, middle finger and thumb are all you need.

You almost want to use both hands or just bury your face in the Tajine, though. That's how good it was. And the owner was so friendly and accommodating to my veg needs, I didn't even mind when I was brought a mint tea when I ordered... I don't even remember what I ordered originally! Who cares? The mint tea was so tasty. 

This would be a lovely place for birthdays (which was why I was there the first time), for a romantic date where you can lovingly hand feed each other... away from all your friends who would otherwise start muttering that you guys are being gross and need to get a room, or even a fancy Ladies night :) *hint hint, cough, WENDY, cough cough*

Try the couscous with the Jilbana Tajine. It's the business."}
{"text":"Hands down our favorite place in all of Calgary. Be prepared for a journey to Marrakesh, however leave your travel guide at home because the owner and his wife will take care of all. When we sat down for dinner we told them to take of all our selections, suffice to say they know a thing or two about hosting a party, entertaining, as well as educating their guests! Part living room, part museum, part dining room - The Casbah offers so much more than a truly authentic dining experience. It is a journey!"}
{"text":"I had diner and it was very delicious! The couscous is excellent. Also, the decoration is outstanding and the service perfect. Moroccan hospitality is the best!"}
{"text":"I didn't know it would ever come to this, but - it was the Casbah who rocked me!

From beginning to end, The Casbah was so much more than a meal, it was a full-on experience.

This place is gorgeous. Covered wall to wall in authentic Moroccan decor, you could have a great night wandering around in awe without even purchasing a meal. But don't do that, you'd be missing out. The food is another wonderful experience all on its own.

Go to spend some time here. Enjoy it. Relax. Each table and booth is unique, cozy, and intimate. Find a spot that calls out to you and set up camp for the evening and let them look. SPOILER ALERT - The meal started with a rose pedal hand wash. This combined with some delicious fragrant Moroccan Tea, I sunk into the soft, authentic furniture,  and I never wanted to leave. I asked one of the owners if they allowed slumber parties, and she laughed. *Sigh* I guess she thought I was joking, and I guess I'll take that as a 'no'.

The food was fantastic. I had the Chermoula Tajine (Stew) with the Kefta (Moroccan Meatballs) as recommended by one of the owners, and I loved it. The meatballs were so tender and broke apart with a soft touch. They were filled with seasoning that while strong, complimented the beef without overpowering it.

I'm going to end this description for fear of drooling on my keyboard.

Conclusion - Go to Casbah for an intimate experiential meal, and take your time with it."}
{"text":"Sadly enough, this once hookah bar is now only a restaurant/bar due to Madison's smoking ban.  One of Casbah's best kept secrets is the fact that they have half-price appetizers during happy hour (until 6:00) M-F.  My girlfriends and I just ate here Friday night, sneaking in at 5:45 and eating at the bar because the only two tables downstairs were full.  The food was delicious and because it was so cheap, we ordered 5 appetizers...for a total of $16.50!!!!!!  Everything was served with warm pitas and I would highly recommend the Dolmadakia Yalantzi, which is grape leaves rolled with a filling of seasoned rice, chopped fresh tomatoes, and spices.  Delicious!  Also, if you are in them mood for a real meal...the prices range from $12-20 with good vegetarian options."}
{"text":"When you walk into Casbah Restaurant, you are welcomed by a warm, intricately decorated environment full of rich fragrant smells. The restaurant is great for date-night dining, as the tables are small and fairly private, tucked around various corners of the restaurant. 

If you want to try a variety of dishes on the menu, I recommend getting the \"Tour of Morocco\", a 4/5 course meal. Both me and my date opted for this option. Where there were options, we chose different dishes and shared so that we could each try as much as possible. I say 4/5 course because the menu advertises this as 5 courses, but 2 of them are served together so it's really 4. We had:

Harirra Soup: a simple soup including chickpeas and lentils in a saffron tomato broth. The soup was flavourful and comforting if maybe a but thin

Khoudra Salad and an appetizer of Merguez: The Merguez is a spiced beef sausage wrapped in phylo pastry and fried. The beef was lightly spiced and the phyllo was perfectly flaky. The salad is a mix of carrots, corn and beets with vinaigrette. Being light and crunchy, this salad was a great accompaniment to the fried Merguez.

For a main, we tried both Tagines. The sweet one included chickpeas, dates, sweet potato, carrot, pecans and pears and we paired this one with lamb. For the savory tagine, which includes peas, potatoes anad olives, we ordered the cornish hen. The sweet tagine was quite sweet, I don't think I would want to eat on on its own. But, when alternated with tastes from the savory tagine, it was delightful. The meats were both cooked beautifully with the lamb being fork tender and the hen was \"fall off the bone\".

The dessert comes with coffee or tea and seems to vary. On this visit, the dessert was a scoop of vanilla ice cream served over strawberry oreserves, topped with chocolate sauce, crushed toffee and a piece of balklava. The ice cream and toppings were average. The highlight of this was the flaky, syrupy baklava.

Service was prompt and friendly. Before food service, you get to wash your hands with rose water, which is a Moroccan tradition. I found the portions to be on the small side, but given we were eating four courses, I appreciated this as I didn't leave feeling overly full. I will note that the restaurant seems to be very accommodating to dietary restrictions as the menu highlights which dishes are vegetarian and/or gluten free."}
{"text":"The Casbah is expensive, but for the most part you get what you pay for.  The decor upstairs is lovely; everything is all twinkly and seems to get twinklier as your senses are enhanced by the richly spiced food and darn good cocktails.  Vegetarian entrees are in a separate section of the menu.  My favorites are the lentil soup, the m'hamra, the vegetarian platter, and the spinach pie.  I also love a cocktail called the Gypsy--it is lemon and orange juice with vodka and Benedictine, and it's always made just tart enough.

My only gripe is that their website says they're open on Sundays, but one Sunday evening I walked all the way out there in the snow to find they were closed."}
{"text":"Gorgeous decor! Great for a special event or date.
It's something new and different and is an entire experience far beyond only the food.
The food is incredibly delicious!"}
{"text":"A-List. Highly Recommended. Superb Food. Excellent Morrocan mint tea. Interesting wine list. The restaurant is below street level, very funky and seating is couch relaxed. The decor alone is worth the visit. They will even bring a impressive wash basin to your table and have you wash your hands before the meal. This place is a winner. One of the best kept secrets in Calgary. Unusual, very cool and exceptional food. Expen$$ive."}
{"text":"I love the mix of 1-2 star and 5 star reviews The Casbah has.  I'm going to put my vote for smackdab in the middle, with a solid 3 star review.

Don't get me wrong.  For fancy drinking, I adore this bar.  The decor and the low-lit prettiness is very sexy.  The drinks are overpriced, but well worth it.  I had some seasonal cocktail once that had blackberry brandy, sherry, cream (and possibly other things), and two ripe blackberries floating on top, served in a martini glass.  Since it's been 4+ years and that drink is still distinguishable from all other fancy drinks in my mind, you know it was a well spent $8.  I have come to drink here many times and have enjoyed it thoroughly each and every time.

The eating, though?  Not so much.  The food was average at best, but very overpriced.  I remember the restaurant being mostly dead, but service being slow.  My overall opinion of The Casbah (which had been so high) dropped a lot that night.

So, go late for some nummy drinks.  Skip dinner."}
{"text":"2/13/10 UPDATE:  Maintaining a 3-star rating, but related to their generally not very good service, warning vegans and allergy-sufferers to STAY AWAY.  We ate there a couple of weeks ago with a friend who is vegan, and therefore made very sure to let the waiter know that she did not want a particular side that included yogurt.  When they brought up the plates, hers had the yogurt dish on it.  She very pleasantly explained the problem to the waiter, who took her plate away and returned about 10 minutes later... with visible traces of the yogurt still on the plate, around the side with which they had replaced it.  She did eventually get a plate that had not been contaminated (as far as we know), but if you had, say, a serious food allergy I would NOT trust the Casbah waitstaff not to kill you.

The food is excellent--well-seasoned and the meat is always succulent, and their rice and couscous have lovely flavor.  I love the lentil soup and always order it with dinners.  (UPDATE: Had the balaklavah recently with a special and it was INCREDIBLY dry.  Avoid.)

The $$ price category fits, but just barely--I find that a dinner for two, with one of us drinking, generally runs us about $65 once you add on the tip.  The food is good, but I find the waitstaff are often awkward in various ways.  This last time that we went, the waitress told us we could sit upstairs or downstairs, which I assumed was the ground level but apparently was the basement.  I still don't know why she wouldn't just seat us on the ground floor, which was completely empty.  The upper story is nicely decorated but I always feel like I've been stashed in someone's attic.

Also, although I like their wine selection, I had to give up on their cocktails after having several that were just not to my taste.  They're a bit on the expensive side, although I will say they are pretty strong--sometimes TOO strong, which might contribute to the taste issue (and it's not that I don't like strong drinks, but it gets to the point that it overwhelms all other flavors)."}
{"text":"REALLY wanted to love this place. The food was amazing. Every dish was incredible. But. The service was very disappointing. We waited way too long between courses, and weren't even offered a third drink."}
{"text":"Boy oh boy! Whatever you do, DON'T ORDER THE LAMB!!! Unless you want to puke your guts out for 24 hours non-stop! The so called lamb kebab is hard as rock and their lamb medallions are just simply disgusting.

They charge you $18 for a plate of couscous! Seriously?! 

The place is fancy and exotic so if you're into that kinda stuff and you don't mind burning some cash, give it a try!"}
{"text":"The place and decoration are very beautiful and authentic but food is average and it's not special. We were served by the owner himself but he was quite intolerant  and rude with us questioning about the food. The service unfortunately is the main reason I am giving 2 stars."}
{"text":"I was a bit leary of going here after reading the review but LOVED it!   Yes the basement has a bit of a musty smell but it a very cute and fun environment sitting down there.  I have been back there 3 times now and have sat downstairs twice and upstairs once.  The food is authentic and amazing!!!!  The price is very reasonable!  I feel bad for the wait staff having to run up and down the stairs for everything.  The service is a bit slow but it is probably because the place is not set up geographically nice for the wait staff.  I will go back (as I already have a couple times)."}
{"text":"Amazing food. This was our first time here, and without a doubt we will be back.
The Tajine and couscous dishes were unreal. Don't forget the mint tea and coffee with the cream on top.

The last time I tried Morroccan was 2 years ago in London, and the Casbah kept my belief alive that Morroccan is the best food on the planet!"}
{"text":"We arrived in Madison on Christmas and needed a place to have dinner - Denny's just wasn't going to cut it.  So we called The Casbah, which happened to be open, and were completely delighted with what we found.  Highlights:

-  Three stories - a basement with a cloth-shrouded den for each table, where you sit, surrounded by pillows and cross-legged like a sultan, a main story with club-style lighting adorning the walls and a very hip looking bar, and an upper level with your traditional fine-dining setup, white table cloths and a rustic feel.

- The fare - excellently done, but a little expensive.  We had \"The Ultimate Grill\" for two, in which everything was cooked to perfection, including the veggies!  We also had falafel & tahini, which my Israeli accompaniment agreed was some of the finest we've tried in the States, tabouli, and a vegan lemon/lentil soup.  All were divine.

- Service - our waiter was friendly and earnest, and this was his first time out of the kitchen.  He was eager to share about the restaurant - the owner is a Palestinean and has been in Madison running the restaurant for over 30 years.

Definitely two thumbs up from us.  And thanks for being open on Christmas!  Love, the Jews"}
{"text":"This place is SO cool.
If you want an intimate setting to dine with your main squeeze or a large group of people, this place has little nooks for every party size. 
And the décor is spot-on - take a look at the pics!
We had a group of 10 people, and from our little booth you couldn't even see another soul. 
The best part was the meu - attention Gluten-intolerant people! You have access to 2/3 of their menu, as most of their Moroccan cuisine is gluten free!  We even had a celiac at our table and she had no problems ordering at all. They even had a coconut based dessert that she could have, and apparently it was delicious!
I had a tajine, as I've never had Moroccan food and asked for help from our super friendly waiter. (seriously, he was amazing!). I selected a sweet stew, and it was very sweet, though it grew on me as I continued eating.  Everyone else selected more savory dishes, and everyone cleaned their plates, so I'm guessing it was good!
Next time I'll select one of their Set Menu dinners - for $39 or $50 you get 3/5 courses with choices at each course."}
{"text":"Went to the ground level part of the restaurant on a Tuesday afternoon.  The place was DEAD.  We weren't even greeted until 3-4 minutes after walking in to the restaurant, and by then we awkwardly found a place to sit.  We had a toddler and a baby with us, and the seating on this level, the cafe level, I guess is NOT good for a family.  I wish we knew that there were two other levels with better seating, but we were just not told ANYTHING.

Good news  is the food is actually REALLY good.  We ordered the red pepper puree with crushed walnuts, garlic, and olive oil.  Very tasty and the pita bread was nicely cooked--grilled if I remember.  We also ordered a lamb shish kabob and falafel sandwich.  The lamb was cooked to order, a nicely done medium.  The sandwich was full of flavor.  Same could be said for the falafel sandwich--falafel was crispy on the outside and soft and flavorful on the inside.  Pita for both sandwiches again cooked well.  Side salad leaves a bit to be desired.

Food was great but with the lack of service and atmosphere (again, this is just based on the only level we knew of) and slightly expensive prices we weren't completely blown away.  We'd come here again if Mediterranean Cafe was closed for the day and we had a falafel hankering."}
{"text":"I've never eaten here, but I will say hands-down Casbah has the BEST mojitos in Madison.  They're tart and they actually muddle with sugar so it's a little gritty as they should be. They are also gigantic."}
{"text":"The overall vibe of the restaurant with the placement of tables and decorations are very nice. 

The food was good, although somewhat pricey. 

The service was lacking. I came here with a group of about 10, and since my friend and I weren't that hungry, we decided to share an entree and appetizer. Once we were ordering, the server didn't let us share our food and basically forced us to order our own meals, saying the minimum purchase per person was $30. I've never been to a restaurant where they didn't let me order what I wanted or set a price for me to pay. It seemed weird."}
{"text":"I got one of the couscous plates with lamb medallions and was not disappointed. The plate was very hot which was appreciated on a cold winter night. 

The service was good although our party of 3 made up 60% of the attendance that night so I'm not sure that's saying much. 

Atmosphere was also comfortable and fun - a nice divergence from local restaurants. 

The only reason I don't want to give a 5 is that I haven't had the chance to explore their menu more and visit on different nights. I can say that Casbah is at least a 4 though!"}
{"text":"I would probably push this rating to 4.5 if that was possible. I admit it. I was impressed. The entrance is downstairs and the environment warm but somewhat dated - an abundance of fake candles and pretend plants is not usually one I would say is also romantic or intimate. It was. The colours are sensual and the way the tables are separated helps give you a feeling of being somewhere more private. The deep set bench like cushions encouraged us to relax and the staff were, dare I say, proud of their establishment and were amazingly adept at understanding what customers really want. We had decided on two dishes but had completely missed that one of them contained an allergen that would have made me very sick! Besides the education about the food he was also patient and asked us if we want d time between courses. Is that even a consideration in most restaurants that serve every course on top of the other and think Macdonaldization was the best influence on restaurants since plastic utensils. I haven't even started in about the food! Authentic Moroccan. Again sensual comes to mind. Exotic mixes of fruit and chickpeas along side perfectly marinated meat such as lamb and Home made sausage. The scents of the entrees are only matched by the fresh mint tea that served as reminder to let your food digest before having dessert or there may not be enough room."}
{"text":"This was a last minute decision to go out for dinner and wow what a great idea! My friend and I had never had Moroccan and we were thoroughly impressed. To start the ambiance is amazing, beautiful decorations, cozy semi private nooks, excellent service.

Because we had never tried Moroccan before, we asked our server to pick an appetizer, a couscous, and a tajine. We had bastella as our appetizer, it was moist and the phyllo was crisp. Couscous chermoula with beef sausage (merguez) was simply amazing, and the Khoudra tajine with lamb had the most amazing squash. This was such a good meal, I foresee a few foodie dreams of the meal in my future. 

Apparently they are slower in the summer months, but always busy in the winter- I would suggest trying it this summer because you can sit a bit longer and really soak in the ambiance."}
{"text":"The ambiance is great but service mediocre and food ok at best. You walk  downstairs and there are colorful cozy booth all around. It seems as though there are nooks and crannies and comfy little spots but you can hear the next table pretty well. Somehow the chairs and \"cozy\" booths aren't as comfortable as they look. If your neighbors are extra chatty or extra loud that will affect your experience, because you'll hear everything.

There is a Yelp offer with this one, & our server discouraged us from using it and it didn't seem worth it anyways. We would've spent much more money had we used it. 

It's nice that you can share the food, but in my opinion it was forgettable. Nothing spectacular. Yes, they used Moroccan spices. Some of the dishes were cooked in a tagine. 

The server was extra chatty. Not sure if that's the best thing for your romantic date, if you're on one."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this place did not accomplish my expectations...

The service was not good, it was slow and the waiter was not very nice.. I told him that I had high expectations with the place, because I had been in a moroccan restaurant in Ottawa which was delicious. And his answer was \"this place is much better\" with such an attitude. That I chose do not say anything else... Unfortunately the place was not better than the one I went in Ottawa the lamb was very dry and the food was nothing special. The only one thing that was really good was the mint tea.. But the rest of food was just ok for me... I do not think I will go back there again and I cannot recommend this place..."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, beautiful decor. I went with a small group and we were seated at a round table in the corner which was very private and gave us a chance to have a great conversation among all of us rather than the long type of tables where you only end up talking to the people seated near you. The service was friendly and attentive, and the food was absolutely delicious. Would definitely return - it would be a great spot for a date night as well."}
{"text":"Be adventurous. Get comfortable. Take your shoes off and relax. Delicious food. Ordered the Taste of Morocco' and it was worth the price."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this one, but I was disappointed. Looking at the ambiance reviews online, I decided to go for a dinner on my birthday here.We were greeted by the hostess and guided to our table. She asked what occasion are we celebrating, one of my friend's said it was my birthday. The hostess leaves saying \"oh okay!!! \" WOW you cannot even say \"Happy Birthday??\" there are restaurants who give out one free dessert if you say that. I mean no courtesy whatsoever.

When the server asked us if we needed any help with the menu ,we said since we were first time eating Moroccan food, if he could suggest some specialties. He said the menu was pretty straightforward and didn't suggest anything. Hence we ended up ordering something which we felt would be good. The food didn't take long to come, although we were sitting unattended for the longest of times! It was over half hour we sat there with nothing on our table, we were not asked if we wanted to try out any dessert. We had to ask them for the menu again, and later ask them for the bill. It was horrible service. 

I cannot comment on the food as I haven't tried original Moroccan food, but I would surely say it was bland and mediocre as opposed what I thought it would be. I don't want to go this restaurant again. Huge disappointment and really bad service."}
{"text":"Ok, so after all the ooooh's and aaaaahhhh's about this place, I finally decided to give it a go on Thursday, I had to see what all the fuss was about.

First of all, you can not complain about the decor.  It is stunning and if you haven't been to Morocco, this place will give you a little taste of what it is like.  Opulent fabrics, crafts, vases and art work cover almost every inch of this place creating a cozy and romantic ambiance.  From the vibe, it is fantastic for a group as well as one on one with a honey.  Drapery delicately hangs from the ceiling and elegantly cascades around your cushioned booths which are very comfortable and relaxed.  A nice array of Arabic music plays in the background to complete the setting.  A perfect environment to casually enjoy our Caesars which by the way, they add their own special harissa seasoning to.

Before the food arrives, they bring you a lovely brass kettle and basin to wash your hands with, it is not a full blown soap and lather thing, just a kettle that is gently poured over your hands and a little basin to catch the water.  I wish the water was a bit warmer but it was still a nice little thing that you don't usually see at your run of the mill restaurant.

To start, we ordered an appetizer platter with a trio of phyllo pastries which are stuffed with your choice of three fillings.  We chose the spinach/cheese, shrimp, and eggplant.  The eggplant was divine, but my hubby hated the spinach one because the cheese was quite strong if you are not a fan of goat cheese. It is a huge a platter (6 large pieces) and I wish I knew that before we ordered it because by the time the main came I was stuffed!  

Our mains were also quite delicious with exception to the optional bread that we ordered for the chicken and veg tagine.  I found the bread too dense and fell apart very quickly and for $4 it is essentially a big heavy bun cut into quarters, next time we will order the rice.  I ordered a veg and chicken couscous tagine and thought it needed a little more sauce for the couscous as it was just a tad too dry for my liking but the flavours were hands down delicious and very thoughtfully prepared.

I would definitely come back!  The menu has many options and all of them sound more delicious than the next, just make sure you leave your house hungry, the servings are generous and will please a rumbly tummy!  

Our tab came out to about $85, and we didn't have coffee or dessert, but I would think that with those two extras you will be looking at a c note for a romantic dinner for two.

Two enthusiastic thumbs up!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for a \"nice\" dinner.  We were very disappointed.  The food was BLAND, the service terrible.  I'd say don't bother."}
