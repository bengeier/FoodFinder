{"text":"I didn't want to come here considering the dismal reviews. However I was pleasantly surprised as I expected the worst. It was standard ayce menu. I found the food was fresh and tasted good. Server was a younger guy and was helpful. Service was on slower side but it was very busy night with line ups at the door. A few items ordered never arrived but we had to go so didn't want to wait. Based on the experience, I would consider returning if I was in the area."}
{"text":"I was at Memories of Japan with a large group this weekend, hoping to enjoy the all-you-can-eat dinner option. Given the size of our party, we had the foresight to order in advance (2-3 hours before our scheduled reservation) ... but were incredibly disappointed that quite a few of the dishes came out of order - and some dishes never came out at all, even after we reminded a number of servers over and over again. To their credit, the servers were pleasant and had a good sense of humour but we probably won't bother going back."}
{"text":"There are other teppanyaki restaurants that are better in service and provides the same quality of food as memories of Japan. I have always been a fan eating here for their teppanyaki dinner, however their service quality has declined over the year not only for dine in but also for delivery, having to wait 1-1/2 hr for your delivery food is not a joke even if they're busy. Should let us know they're crazy busy not some excuse where they put out when we call to inquire for our food. Dine in at teppanyaki is also always a crazy wait time for them to fill up the table before serving customers."}
{"text":"Poor service with a dated check in system that looks like a page out of the Flintstones error. Usually reservations are as such, not here. Reserved a table for two which should be the easiest turn around since its Valentines night, but that turned out to be a disaster that turned into 30 minutes, then 45, then an hour and so its an hour and a half later. Remember it's my first time here and we haven't had an offer of getting a drink or pre screening the menu. I am looking forward to see if their food is a saving grace or ammunition for another novel.. P.s, it was fun watching the comedy show as the man at the front desk navigate seating with his pen, paper and pins while brushing everyone who approached him asking about the wait time and why they even bothered to reserve a table. Wish me luck."}
{"text":"Issues with Service: This is my second time visiting this place and it is shocking how bad the service has gotten. I'm not sure if it's because it's a slow night or we weren't part of the all you can eat crowd. It took forever to get a server. When they did come, it was to bring us someone else's food.    If you are coming here, don't get a private room and expect a wait for a refill of tea.  Issues with Food The food was good but the presentation was poor. We ordered the salmon boat (30 pieces) and got it in a small white plate. This is not a place to go for a date, it's the place you come to when you don't care about impressing anyone."}
{"text":"A little overpriced, but when you get the food, you realize everything is way overpriced for the quantity and quality of the food. Very poor quality control in what leaves the kitchen and is delivered to the table. Even before our sushi and maki rolls made it to our table, the maki rolls were coming apart, rice was falling off of the sushi when I picked it up by hand! And I want to emphasize, I eat sushi with my hands because it gives me more control and holds sushi together better, but the sushi was so poorly put together, the rice was not properly made, that it fell apart as I brought to my mouth...  I was not expecting good food at this place as I have been here numerous times since I was a child, and the only memorable experience I have ever had at memories of Japan was my first time here eating at the teppenyaki table when I was a child, and the Cook giving us an amazing show of flipping salt and pepper shakers, telling jokes, and cooking spectacularly. Since then, it has always been uneventful and unmemorable."}
{"text":"The teppanyaki is a great deal and a great show,  very nice with a large group. Recently the have added an all you can eat option - and at lunchtime it is the deal of deals. Fish is fresh but on some orders the slices are slight. Great place with great food."}
{"text":"PLEASE DO NOT GO HERE. The setting was nice. However, the service was extremely bad. I came here on a Saturday night and I'd just like to say that the hostess and our waiter lacked basic customer service skills. I've been to Memories of Japan a few times and they've all been bad experiences. However, my parents and I decided to give it another try and later on regretted that decision. Back to the employees, they didn't even bother smiling or greeting us. I went up to the hostess and asked a table for three people. After that, she didn't say anything to me at all, complete silent, and she walked away. When she comes back, she proceeded to help other customers without even acknowledging me. I went up to her again to ask about our table and she just goes okay, follow me. She didn't bother apologizing for walking out on me. It was rude enough that she walked away and she made it worse by not saying sorry. Anyways, we got sit down, the waitress took our order. Few minutes later our miso soup arrived along with the salad that came with my order. Then it was followed by my order. 15-20 minutes passed after getting my food, my mom hasn't gotten her order. I talked to the waitress who took our order and asked what happened to it and she told me that my mom's order was forgotten/ or was not mentioned to the cook, I don't know. What I didn't like about the waitress is that she didn't even let us know what's been happening with my mom's order.  After I talked to the waitress, again, we patiently waited for our food. 8 minutes passed by and we decided to cancel it. Now the waitress had the audacity to apologize. I know it's a Saturday night and all, but I still don't recommend anyone to go here."}
{"text":"The standards have really fallen in the past year because the quality of the food itself is not as good.  I haven't tried the cooking tables but was very disappointed with the bento boxes on the last 3 visits."}
{"text":"Food: great 5 Service: excellent 5 Price: a bit expensive 3 ( im from Montreal and we have the same kind of meal for 2/3 of the price )"}
{"text":"Went for the all you can eat deal they have here and it was great!  I've been coming here for years because of the Teppanyaki, where they cook right in front of you and sometimes put on a show, which was always fun. About a year ago they added the option of AYCE since a new restaurant that was doing that opened up a few blocks south of here. But Memories of Japan is way better value.  I had the miso soup, salmon rose, white tuna sushi, salmon belly, beef rib, chicken teriyaki, salmon teriyaki, beef teriyaki, enoki beef roll, pork cutlet, chicken cutlet, deep fried scallops and green tea ice cream. All of the food was good. They usually have more dessert options but seemed to be out today, but that didn't bother me since I was absolutely stuffed. As long has they have green tea ice cream I'm happy :)  All that for $13.95 + tax and tip was well worth it, I will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Fun, nice staff, nice decor. It was a very pleasant teppanyaki meal with some fun surprises!   Our chef was a little quiet compared to the others, but still entertaining and friendly. I could really tell he loves what he does! Like another poster said, I would have rather had a more entertaining chef though.  Food was yummy, but the fried rice was plain. It was ok though, since the meats had good flavour to compliment it.  It was a little awkward having to sit with another group since they wanted to fill up the table of 8, but it didn't take away from the overall experience. I would come here again!"}
{"text":"I had the lunch teppanyaki recently, the price is pretty good for the lunch menu ($10-$13), the food was pretty good.  The reason I am giving it a two stars rating due to the horrible service by the teppanyaki cook.  The waiter was ok, not super service but no complain.   So, when the cook came to our table, he repeats each of our orders to us with rambling very quickly with his poor English.  I understand English is not his first language but he still speak in a slow and clear tone so the customers can understand.  After, he quickly repeated our orders, me and friends was like, what? Can you repeat that again? (there were 5 of us, and none of us can catch anything he said), he replied, \"that's okay\" What the?!?!?! anyways, we figure it's fine, since we could see what kind of food he is cooking in front of us.  We just leave it. 2 of us had ordered the salmon, and we saw there were two pieces of salmon on the cooking table, figure out those were for us.  When the fishes were done, he gave one piece to another gentleman from another group that sat on the table with us. another one to one of my friends...we then exchanged eye contact wondering where is our second piece of salmon.  After awhile, I asked the cook, (pointing at my friend) he also ordered the salmon then he replied, yes, one more is coming.  Maybe I am too strict but I think he should have told us that \"sorry, we missed your other salmon, we will get another cooked right away.\" not wait until the customer asks you. The last incident in this experience was I ordered a steak and so does my friend, I ordered \"medium rare\" and my friend ordered \"medium well\", we saw the steaks were cooked together, I thought he might just take away my portion from the cooking table earlier and cook the rest until it's reach medium well.  without surprise, he overcooked mine together with the medium well.  It could be another error due to language barrier but I still think he should have reconfirmed with us if he doesn't understand unlike making our orders wrong.   Further to all of the above unprofessional manner, we all found that he was in a grumpy mood which I don't think it's acceptable when you are in a customer service business.  I wouldn't go to this restaurant again, or at least not the teppanyaki table."}
{"text":"Simply the worst customer service of all time! Stay far, far away! I'm still shaking my head of how much a total failure that experience was. For the money there are so many better options."}
{"text":"Excellent service! Very quick delivery and the driver was very pleasant and helpful. Or office was very happy with the food and the attention to detail for each order."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this place for many, many years. My wife has been coming here since she was 16 (She is now 36).  The place has undergone some changes over the years, most recently adding the \"All you can eat\" option to the menu. I am a purist, so i stick to the traditional a la carte menu, so i can not comment on the AYCE.   The menu is classic with all the standard offerings. Teriaki meats & tempura are good, but the best thing here is the RICE; yes thats hard to believe, but their rice cooking is just incredible. Its difficult to cook rice to perfection, but they do it on the steamed rice consistently.  The other stuff is good too.   Overall its a reliable high quality place.  (Also, i did a yelp check in, and got a free soda!)"}
{"text":"service and quality has gotten worse over the past five years I've been dining here. sloooow to get items, even when a la carte, no refills on water glasses, wrong order after wrong order."}
{"text":"I have been going to this restaurant for years and I was totally disappointed with their treatment at our last visit. They have a photo wall on the outside with their prices, I ordered what I saw out there and they charged more. They said their prices changed. So the better question is: why didn't they update the pics on the wall outside? Such an unethical practice and when I asked to speak to the manager the waitress said he wouldn't come over. The restaurant is in need of an upgrade and it's and not drawing the crowd it once was and I think it's because they need to have a better focus on the customer experience. There are so many restaurants in that areas now it's time to wake up."}
{"text":"This is the worst sushi place ever! It is just a rip off place. For fish eggs they use food colouring and the rolls are pathetic! Just horrible!"}
{"text":"Great entertainment for the kids or someone who is unfamiliar with authentic Japanese food (and even those who are). However the quality and flavour of the food is only average. We had the chicken, steak and scallop meals. All were perfectly edible, but you shouldn't go here expecting the most delicious food ever. The Benihana-style chef show is good fun."}
{"text":"This was one of the worse dinners I ever had at a sushi restaurant.  I know it's not like this during the day.  Stay away during the evening slow hours - horrible horrible service - never again.  2 pieces of the sushi were even spoiled - Go to Tako Sushi down the street (Don Mills)"}
{"text":"The host was extremely rude on Mother's Day. We made a reservation days ahead and still had to wait an hour. The host told our mom that everyday is Mother's Day and to calm down. Terrible experience. Overbooked multiple parties. I've been coming here for years and was never treated like this until today. Not coming back for sure."}
{"text":"I would give this place zero stars if possible. Terrible food, terrible service. And the worst of all, the \"chef\" placed raw chicken right next to cooked fish on the grill, handling with same spatula. Disgusting."}
{"text":"This place has a la carte, teppanyaki and \"all you can eat\". I have tried them all. I think this restaurant gives good quality food for what we pay. For $25 at dinner, we can have sushi, sashimi, teriyaki etc in the \"all you can eat\" option.. They only cook the food when ordered, therefore, it is tasty and fresh. I personally did not taste much MSG in the food. Service may be slightly slow when they are busy. I am OK with it because food quality is more important to me than service. Hope this review helps."}
{"text":"I wish I could leave zero stars for this restaurant. They brought cold and old dragon rolls California rolls were old staff was super rude and Bill was astronomical. Do yourself a favour avoid this place."}
{"text":"Its been 1hr since I ordered make rolls and they are still making it as per the waitress.  If you are here for sashimi and cooked food it will come faster.  Make rolls don't bother.  Don't bother coming here.  The food 2.5 star. Finally the seemed to have forgotten our order.  Tsk tsk"}
{"text":"Service: Horrible. We've waited an hour and a half for our food to come, and still have to wait longer for the chef to cook our food. We were all falling asleep and wanted to leave. The chef attempted to entertain us with jokes, but it an epic failed. Jokes were out of the planet racist.  Food: Bad. The fish was not fresh. The fried rice was simply soya sauce mixed with rice.   Conclusion: Highly not recommended. All tappanyaki restaurants that I've been to was way better."}
{"text":"I'm amazed this place is still in business and that it is getting good ratings. This place was awesome over 8 years ago when there weren't many good sushi choices uptown but they haven't renovated or done anything different since then.  Their teppanyaki is ok if you want to leave smelling like you came out of a deep fryer - their ventilation leaves something to be desired. Their sushi is passable, but not very friesh. The decor is old, the fabric on their seats shows its age in wear and tear and the tables are always a bit sticky.\"  The waitresses wear tacky \"Asian-inspired\" outfits but have absolutely no concept of good customer service. Once my family and I were in one of the private dining rooms for 4 and I could hear them complaining about their customers in Mandarin outside of our cubicle (assuming (wrongly) that we wouldn't understand them).  There are SO many better (and cheaper!) sushi options in Toronto. Don't waste your time with Memories."}
{"text":"DONT GO- BAD FOOD!!!  The food was absolutely horrible. Literally go to any sushi/Japanese restaurant in Toronto and you will find something better.  Ordered a buffet for me and my husband... had 3 dishes and realized that   1) it has no flavour 2) the portions are smaller that any Japanese place would ever do them (ex. Ordered sushi pizza and got 1 slice.....)  3) Teriyaki chicken was just chicken with Teriyaki sauce on top. 4) Mango salad was with lettuce and 3 mango slices and this Big Mac sauce.. BAD... not an actual mango salad...  Lazy food that a college student could muster up for the first time making Japanese food.  Spoke to the manager- BAD TEMPER- told us that his food is not bad and for us to \"stick to where we eat and not change it\" = We ended up paying $70 for food that was not only absolute garbage but for a bad attitude manager who was stuck in his ways + only ate 4 dishes/spoons of food.   Recommend trying Niji in Scarborough or the one across Pacific mall. BOTH better and HALF THE PRICE + DOUBLE THE FOOD"}
{"text":"I just came back from an amazing night at Memories of Japan for my dad's birthday. From coordinating the surprise birthday cake to accommodating me with my allergies, the service was exceptional. I have several allergies and brought my own \"soy sauce.\" Without me even asking, the server noticed and asked if I had any allergies and then got a chef to cook with separate ingredients on another iron griddle! Very thoughtful. The teppenyaki chef \"Yakkimoto\" was hilarious. He kept us entertained and served us delicious food. The portions were generous and we were all very full and satisfied (we ordered the set dinner menu for parties). Thank you Memories of Japan, we'll be back again!"}
{"text":"I usually go here for some company event.  The last  time I went for lunch they were skimping out!  The wasabi was the size of a pea and the salmon (as thin as a piece of paper) in my bento box.  I was not happy!   Some of my coworkers noticed the quality wasn't there either in their sushi rolls.  I have had the teppanyaki there once but I think it is just for show.  Nothing special unless you want to impress out of town guests or something."}
{"text":"The good:  - Nice decor, cool seating where you likely have to sit with other parties around the cooking station.  - Good sushi, overall the teppanyaki was pretty good, esp. the steak.  The bad:  - The teppanyaki chicken was a bit undercooked;  - They charge for pop refills; - They twice forgot to bring out an appetizer our party had ordered (and the place wasn't even that busy) - Our cook told really bad misogynistic jokes. I'm actually quite surprised they let him get away with it. Everyone laughed, but dude was offensive. And not even in an amusing way.  I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Even though the management and menu has changed, the reasons why I avoided going to this establishment became evident today. Their lack of planning has ruined the Anniversary Dinner for my parents. It took less than 5 minutes to regret the decision to go here. We are going to try and make it through dinner. The manager even checked up and told him that we are not happy, and their response was that they had a lot of people order a particular item all afternoon and don't have any left for the dinner crowd. Avoid this place, cause I will from now on..."}
{"text":"For the last three times I've been here, I've had what look like three completely different meals, even though I ordered the same thing each time. Needless to say, this place has gotten pretty inconsistent. One of the three times they gave us large, reasonable portions like they used to consistently do, but two of the three times they flaked and gave us the smallest maki roll pieces I've ever had. They also changed the recipe of a few of their maki rolls this last time that I went, from what I can tell.  Their sashimi is always good but they keep altering and screwing with sizes of their maki rolls, so I can't trust this place to be filling or reliably good, even if I order the same thing every time.  Disappointing, but at least their sashimi is good."}
{"text":"I'm sad there is no stars available to select. We have been here in the past, with ok results, but this was brutal. We sat for more than an hour, then when we asked to see the waiter, he was unavailable. Then we spoke to the manager. The manager told us that it was the waiters fault and there was nothing he could do about it. He then said our only option was not to tip. Not a great option because our chef was great once he showed, he told great jokes and said the manager was an asshole who couldn't run a gas station.   So the end of the meal comes, and we want to split the $ 240 bill in half. No problem sir. They bill me half, then pass the machine to our friends. The waiter enters the full $240 amount on the their bill.  It wasn't noticed until we had already paid. We went to the counter to say they made an error, they said they couldn't refund the money because the take out guy had left with the machine and they had no way to return the money. So, 20 minutes later, they guy comes back and reluctantly returns the funds on visa. Don't go!  Food was crap, and staff was worse!  If you do go, grab a tea and drop an upper Decker! Couldn't happen to nicer folks.  By the way, as we leave, the manager yells at and says we aren't welcome back. Not a problem asshole."}
{"text":"Over the years, I've visited Memories of Japan quite frequently. What I've notice recently is that their quality of food has gone down since they decided to serve AYCE.  During my last visit, I ordered a vegetarian roll combo. As I was eating, I noticed a few fish eggs in my rolls. I told the waitress and requested a new one. However, instead of fixing the problem, they repeated the same thing. I found fish eggs in my new plate. I decided not to complain about it again and just not eat the sushi, which was pretty disappointing. Not only that, my father has noticed that the quality and quantity of his sashimi drastically changed over time.   Memories of Japan used to be a nice place to eat dinner but, with the way it's going now, I would rather just go to another restaurant."}
{"text":"I'd honestly give a 0 if I could. My sushi was falling apart and the food wasn't all that great. Or fresh. They have the rudest and most disrespectful staff I have ever experienced in a restaurant. They really need to take some lessons on communication and people skills. I will definitely NOT come here again and I suggest that you don't waste your money. They are pretty pricey."}
{"text":"I have to quantify my review by saying that my visit was on Mother's Day, however, it seems the wait times with a reservation are poorly managed. We made a reservation for 10 people and it was over an hour to even be seated. The manager was disinterested and I have to say my dining experience from here was nothing more than fine. For teppenyaki they cooked the food with little interaction or conversation. While I've been to many teppenyaki restaurants I would have to say this is my worst experience. Overall I think \"meh\" says it best. If you don't mind waiting ridiculous amounts of time, even when you've made a reservation, while an unapologetic host ignores you then this is the place to go."}
{"text":"We went here for Mother's Day today with a large group of 12. It was very busy and we had to wait 45 minutes for our table but we expected this and we knew we had to be a bit patient on such a busy day. Our server Emily was very friendly, quick and efficient and our cook was fun and entertaining. We had such a great time!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place, but not any more. I ordered delivery from them today.  The sushi combo I ordered was supposed to have 3x tuna rolls.  They provided 3x salmon instead.  I feel cheated, what a rip-off. I won't be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"MOJ is middle of the road Japanese cooking. The teppanyaki grill is decent, but I agree with previous critics about the dated and dark interior and the stuffy air quality.   Food (Grill): The grill course is rather filling which is good actually, but do prepare for a sodium and oil bomb - skip the bacon breakfast if you are there for the grill. Make sure to drink plenty of water avoiding dehydration headaches. The meat comes pre-seasoned and and the vegetables are drenched in soy sauce and salted garlic butter. Besides, the choices of meals are too similar to be considered exciting, and the menu has not changed in ages \"yawn\". However, it does deliver consistent quality, and in its predictability establishes trust.   Food (Lunch): Besides the cooking table I have been for lunch service and ate the chicken-bento-box with soup, small salad, 4 sushi rolls, rice and tofu. As well as different types of sushi rolls. Chicken cooked fine in the usual tangy sauce. Soup was small portion, not as salty as in other places, tofu watery and surprisingly forgettable, a single big broccoli, nothing wowing there. There are no real lunch specials on the menu, nothing thrilling or exciting for a special deal. Rather boring.  Service:  Service is attentive and quite ok. We usually enjoy ourselves here and I have seen far worse service. Japanese culture is unobtrusive and conservative when serving guests, I find that refreshing and it beats the fake-friendly \"how are you guys doing tonight with a big stupid grin\" routine of other joints. So thats a plus.  Overall: Not bad but quite dark and stuffy. Worth going and pretty good for the buck. Beware if you have high blood pressure or heart disease b/c of very high sodium grill, instead go for lighter options or fish. Three and a quarter stars."}
{"text":"I came here as my friend recommended it for us to all go to. The one thing that I noticed is that every single waiter was extremely rude. They had no sense of how to talk to a costumer politely or what tone to use. I was appalled. Absolutely no respect!  There was only one waiter who was very nice so I'm basically dedicating the one star to him and the food.   I don't recommend."}
{"text":"This place is mediocre at best. We came for the lunch buffet. The fish wasn't fresh. The spicy salmon sushi is just leftover trimmings of the salmon nigiri that get put on a roll of rice with some spicy mayo tossed in there, which would be fine if the fish was at least fresh. The \"tiramisu\" is a 2 inch tiny cup with a piece of vanilla cake, with sugar syrup and cream on top. And fyi, the yelp deal is only valid for dinner. I'd MUCH rather go to the Mongolian BBQ buffet next door, which is a million times better."}
{"text":"Super small portions for their orders. We would order 3-4 portions and then still get the same amount as 1 portion. So many items never made it to our table. We had to call the manager over and he said they do that so people don't waste and he said from now on if we order multiple he will ensure we get it. Well they didn't happen. We ordered 4 orders of squid and got a tiny plate with a small lump of it.   Staff look unhappy and not welcoming at all. Out of all the all you can eat sushi places this is the worst one. Go to Tenichi or Maison du Japan or anywhere else."}
{"text":"Been here several times over the years. before. Excellent cooking table and sushi meals off the menu.  Tried the ayce menu. The quality was not nearly as good as the a la carte and other ayce sushi restaurants.  Service was terribly slow I thought I was in a fine dining restaurant!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday evening for the AYCE. I have to say the service is really slow and the waitresses aren't very attentive. The food also came out really slowly, and a lot of items on their menu they actually did not have (this happened for about 5 of the items we asked for - mostly the desserts). But with that said the quality of food was above par in terms of taste and quality. I'd come again but it wouldn't be my top choice."}
{"text":"No complaints about the food but our waitress Jenny didn't hide the fact that she didn't want to help us. Monotone, impatient, and forgetting our drinks, she did warm up to us closer to when it came time for the cheque.  There were 12 of us and it wasn't busy on a weekend lunch. We all ordered a teppanyaki lunch combo and the chefs were friendly, did some tricky, and prepared our meals in an expected amount of time - I mean, they were cooking righting front of you!  I enjoyed my food and others did the same. The shrimp was really juicy and much larger than I expected. For the experience it's worth it, but at $17 for a lunch combo it's not somewhere I would go to every week."}
{"text":"We had our families Christmas dinner here tonight. We are surprised to have lobster added to the Tepanyaki dinner. We always come here for treats. Best food reasonable price."}
{"text":"I've been coming here on several occasions now starting from years ago.  The food has gotten better along with the staff as the place has grown over the years.  The place looks essentially the same as it did over 10 years ago, but it's not a bad thing as it has a kind of peaceful and quiet decor.  I prefer their private rooms as they are nice and quiet for a group gathering our just a couples dinner.  The regular seating is not bad as well.  One thing to note is their washrooms are way too small for the size of this place!  The food is standard and comes out fairly quickly.  It is nothing special, but it's always cooked well and I have never had a problem with my food.  They do offer sea urchin on rare occasions and it's a delicious option to have.  I do suggest going with any bento box combo they offer as they come with a lot of choices of food and will fill you up.  Overall a nice place to take friends or family and the prices are not bad at all for what you get.  I'll come back here again when I'm around the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Every time I come back here, I'm not disappointed. The tappanyaki is AMAZING and the food is delicious. Sure, service is slow, but I think the food quality makes up for it."}
{"text":"Best place on earth to bring a large group or people of different ages. I'm not giving this place 4 stars just for the food. The last star is for the entertainment value and fun factor. Food gets about a 3. The chefs are always funny--- there was one who was singing \"Like A Virgin\", which we thought was hilarious.   Sushi was good-- the fish was quite fresh. Definitely not the best I've had but certainly not the worst. Red Dragon Roll was tasty, but not rolled tightly enough. Tempura was light and the Gyoza were nice and crisp. Nothing about the meal was award winning, but what I like about this place is that I feel I could bring any member of my family here, no matter how old, and they'd have a blast. There aren't a lot of places like this and if there are, it's usually a place I can't stand like Kelsey's or something.   MOJ is a good solid place for a fun afternoon/evening out with people you like. In fact, even if there were people I didn't like, I bet I'd be having enough fun to get over it for a little while. I'm a firm believer that the experience of dining out should never just be about the food. Things like atmosphere,value, service, and the general buzz of a place can make or break a good time.   I have yet to have a bad time here."}
{"text":"I've tried many sushi locations and this one I would not recommend. Quality is basic AYCE (low quality) and the service was quite terrible. I came with a group of 5 for a birthday dinner and they seemed annoyed and rushed us to pay. The website states that the closing time is 11pm however they rushed us to pay and began cleaning up everything at 10:30. I do not recommend and will not go back."}
{"text":"Awful food and terrible service. I ordered the salmon teriyaki bento box for lunch, cost $14.95. I expected a decent piece of fish, but got a thin, dry, small (two bites) salmon slice that had was too salty and lacked teriyaki. Check out the picture I posted to see for yourself. Tofu pieces were grease logged and inedible.  Ice berg lettuce with thousand island dressing was OK, broccoli and rice was waaaay too much. Probably trying to make up for the chintzy fish, but I was still disappointed because the menu pictures were false representations.  Grumpy waitstaff who did not bring the ginger I asked for. They treat customers as an interruption to their loud Chinese yap fest. Well, sorry ladies, I would never go back, so yap away."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch AYCE on a weekday.  Their menu doesn't have anything unique or special, pretty typical selection for AYCE sushi restaurant. Their nigiri were very fragile, with the rice part broke into two almost immediately after being picked up by chopstick. Their spicy salmon and salmon rose were much better and consistently made.  The service is very slow. I arrived before noon before lunch crowd came and it still took more than 70 mins in total. You'd better order everything in one order or else you have to be ready for extended lunch break. The waiters are generally friendly, but amount of sushi delivered were often less than what was ordered.  Overall, it's an okay AYCE sushi restaurant, one of many."}
{"text":"Came here for a family birthday celebration mid December for teppanyaki.  We used to come here a lot years ago.  The chef was really entertaining but the food was so so.  I ordered black cod and it was over cooked and no flavor."}
{"text":"The AYCE was fair.  What I did notice is that the soy sauce was watered down.  I have NEVER seen that before.  That diminished my meal experience."}
{"text":"We came for sushi we did not have teppanyaki.  Great service. Food needs to be kicked up a few notches. Decor is also dated."}
{"text":"Though this place has been a long-lasting restaurant Toronto, the service has certainly gone downhill. We waited for close to an hour for their teppanyaki chef to come to our table. If expecting more groups, they should make sure they have enough chefs to accommodate the groups. We saw one group across from us just get fed up and left. Thought their teppanyaki lunches are affordable and good for special occasions, not sure I will be back."}
{"text":"Memories of Japan feels dated, but it's still a decent place for lunch. The at-table cooking has a certain charm, although sometimes you have to wait for a table to fill up for longer than I'd like. Other times I've been later to the table and the lunch has been very speedy.  The lunch options are neither extremely expensive nor very inexpensive, and there's a wide variety of options for pricing.  I'd neither go out of my way to recommend it nor suggest that you go elsewhere.  It's decent without earning a strong recommendation in any way."}
{"text":"A Chinese \"Japanese\" restaurant. This was an okay place to go to years ago when their food quality was better, and competition was less stiff. Given all the choices Toronto has to offer -- better Japanese food, or equal-quality food for less money -- I am surprised this place is still in business today."}
{"text":"Have been going here for so long and i have nothing to complain about. Great food and i love the red bean ice cream!"}
{"text":"Not sure why this place has low reviews. I used to eat here every Sunday but I've been busy with work. I usually eat in the dining room. Tried the Teppenyaki a few times but the dining room a la cartel menu is better than the AYCE."}
{"text":"The teppanyaki creates a great atmosphere. The filet mignon set teppanyaki dinner and the Don Mills rolls are really good. I have gone here for years and even though its popularity has fallen off, the quality is still very good.  The only issue I have with it is the long wait-times for a chef to come to your teppanyaki table."}
{"text":"We were a party of 7 and we sat at the cooking section tables when I noticed that they had buffet. I inquired into it and one waitress said yes while another one said no because its not enough time. Spoke to the elderly manager that kept eating his food and ignored me. I left and announced I am going next door to Mongolian grill. Very, Very rude. I will never step foot at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Don't just got here for sushi!!!  Always do the cooking table!  That is the best one in GTA. In fact, forget the sushi, just get cooking table.  The sushi here is not that great at all.  I am a sushi lover but I never ordered sushi here, if it came with my set meal at the cooking table, then I would eat it, but I am not exactly amused by it. Some of the chefs are fun, some are really boring, no tricks at all.  So I guess that is a chance you have to take.  Other than that, the food is great at the cooking table and every chef serves the same quality of food."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and ordered AYCE. I found lunch to be quite good. Food came out at a good pace and all the cooked dishes were hot. Everything was good, except the pad thai. It was a bit dry.   After enjoying the lunch service, I came back for dinner couple of days later. The dinner was awful. Dishes came out painfully slow. Several dishes got lost each time we ordered. Manager apologized to few tables regarding the slow speed. He didnt come to my table but he did to the tables left and right of me, only to leave my table out. The cooked food that came out were room temperature and wasn't as good. Flavour wasn't there. Some foods were greasy.   Service was fine. Interior dated.  Sushi was good (within ayce standard). They do have tuna, tako (octopus), and eel as part of their ayce selection which is a plus. However I won't be returning."}
{"text":"I came for the teppanyaki and the \"show\" however it's luck of the draw with cooks. Our cook was fairly quiet while we could over hear other cooks entertaining their guests.   The food was good except they over cooked my shrimp and another guests lobster.  Beef was done well however. Washrooms were clean. Service was good, friendly staff.   Fair prices. Would com again but just hope I get a more entertaining chef."}
{"text":"In the 90's this place used to be the best teppanyaki restaurant in toronto. Once it was bought by the new owner, the quality steadily declined. It's such a shame. Back then you really felt like you got bang for your buck. Steak with more fat on it and cooked with garlic and herb butter. Huge, huge chicken portions and very generous amount of bean sprouts and mixed veggies. I visited with my mom recently for teppanyaki and was ultra surprised with how poor the quality had gotten. The portion sizes were so small. The chicken. Oh dear, where do I begin. This place prided itself on using homemade teriyaki sauce for its chicken back in the day. Teriyaki sauce should be sweet, sticky and savoury. I swear the chef used soy sauce instead of teriyaki sauce because the chicken was super salty.  Don't get me started on the ayce. When they started doing it, my fam came to try and it was terrible. It's true what the other reviewers have said about serving time. The food takes forever to arrive and another review mentioned that they were out of  a third of the menu items. This was true when we went.  I'll still come back with my fam from time to time for nostalgia's sake but I'm just sad with how this establishment has gone downhill over the years. My fave chef, Yamaha doesn't seem to be working there anymore either.   If you decide to come, go for the teppanyaki. Avoid the AYCE at all costs."}
{"text":"Went for AYCE sushi and did not have a pleasant experience: -Beef short ribs weren't fresh -All the rolls were falling apart  -Chicken udon hardly had any chicken in it -Hand rolls were disappointing - waaay too much rice   Staff decided that we ordered way too much food and kept telling us that we wouldn't be able to finish it. Quantity was not the issue - it was the taste. It's a shame because I used to love coming here all the time."}
{"text":"I dislike making negative reviews, but we came here for a special occasion and were very disappointed. The teppan table experience tonight was nothing more than watching him cook our fish and some veggies. Nothing more. No flaming volcano of onion rings, no flame at all (like we saw at some other tables), no flash or panache whatsoever. Portions were less than satisfying.   I will not be surprised to learn that this place is closed next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Went there for Valentines Day (still bitter 2 months later). We waited over 1.5 hours for our food, understood it was a busy night so when we politely asked about our order we found out they had lost it... So we ordered again and waited another 30 mins... And nothing. They had the nerve to charge us the full all- you-can eat price for a freaking salad and 2 spring rolls!! Completely ruined our night...whats worst is that we didn't even get an apology..."}
{"text":"This is the worst restaurant for delivery I've ever experienced.  I've tried them at least 10 times for delivery and they are awful! The food always arrive stone cold and when you complain by phone,  they couldn't care less.  They hardly give you any sauce for the tempura and also the beef and/or chicken. The salad you get has been cut in half, they might as well not give you any. To eat in the restaurant is not much better.  They rush you through your meal so fast you can't even joy it. I certainly understand why it is half empty when you go there.  DON'T GO THERE, YOU ARE WASTING YOUR MONEY!!!!"}
{"text":"I wait forever.  Seriously.... can you guys be any slower? I waited 1.5 hour for the chief to come and cook my food."}
{"text":"My three siblings and I went to this restaurant to experience the teppanyaki(cooking table) to catch up and hang out just the kids of the family. To make this review as helpful as possible, It is divided into a short and long review. The Short Review: Pros: -very good food (Cooking table) -Great entertainment value -Clean restaurant -family and kid friendly  Cons: -terrible service -takes long time to get your food (took my entire section 2 hours) -loud environment -Unfriendly and unhelpful staff -expensive  The Long Review: I used to come here with my entire family when I was 8 or 9. We went to this place a lot but after I turned 12, my parents stopped taking us here and I never understood why. Fast forward 10 years later now that I'm I'm my early 20's. When I called in to make a reservation, I had no problem setting my reservation for 7. I showed up to the restaurant about 10 minutes later than my reservation which meant that the table should have been ready. Not only did they not have a table ready for us but there was a huge lineup of people who still have not yet been seated. From the 6:00 seating. This should have been my first red flag but I didn't take the hint.  Fast forward an hour later and we finally get called in to seat. My brother who is currently 10 was starving so we all knew what we wanted to order. What happened next was a 10 minute wait to order drinks (we each ordered water) which took another 10 minutes to get to our table.  After 30 minutes, we had finally ordered our food and were starving. The chef took over an hour to get to our table which caused us to order appetizers as we were so hungry. They didn't list the prices of the appetizers which cost a lot more than it should have and we didn't know till the end of the meal.  While I was waiting for the chef to come to our table and start our meal, I saw the family at the table across from us. They had 3 little kids who were very restless and hungry. I felt bad since all the kids looked like they were under the age of 7. They also ordered appetizers (tempura) since they were so hungry. after a minutes of the kids beginning to snack, the waitress frantically grabs the plate and tells them she made a mistake with the order and angrily storms off with the plate and food that the kids touched. this crossed a line for me. There was no reason for her to take that food back after the family has touched it. She either brought it to the proper table which would have been unhygienic and unethical or, she threw it out which is equally unacceptable since these kids and their family has been waiting for longer than we have and are hungry. Plus the waitress would just be throwing it out (hopefully)  When the chef finally came, he gave an entertaining but short show. We finally were able to eat our food at 10:00. We could only eat a small amount though since we were so tired from waiting so long. We asked to get the bill, some dessert (a scoop of ice cream comes with the meal), and take out containers.  The bill for 4 people cost us $180 which is way more than expected all because of the appetizers that we needed (my brother was not feeling well and needed to eat something)  Overall the meal took about 2.5 hours of disappointment and the waiting before took an additional 1.5 hours. The end of the night we spent 4 hours and $180 on the worst restaurant experiences in canada.  I ended up speaking to the manager who just explained how bad business has been going over the last few months. I felt bat but the service didn't reflect them trying to make a change.   I ended the evening by tipping twenty five cents. (More than the amount that makes me look cheep but high enough to show them that they deserved every penny. I can promise you that we will not be eating here again"}
{"text":"Simply amazing fun with fast delicious food cooked right in front of you!!   Cirque de soleil first, this for second part of double date!   This is great spot for conversation an memories!  Kudos!"}
{"text":"The cooking table is good, really good.  BUT the dining room is pathetic.   The very worst service I have ever had.  The staff doesn't listen, it is not a language issue, it is that they just don't care about their customers.  They change their set menu and don't bother to let you know.  Meal should have come with mixed vegetables and replaced with chicken bites instead.  They said they ran out of vegetables and offered steamed broccoli ... isn't that a vegetable, but only after meal was put down and we questioned it.  Didn't get order correct.  Didn't clear off dirty dishes before serving dessert.  Asked 3 times for cutlery with the response each time 'I know'.  Food was not enjoyable.  Ruined a special family event.  NOT COOL!"}
{"text":"Ahhh...the memories at Memories.  I'm not sure what to say.  I used to go here many years ago - it was always packed and the food was good (not great, but good).  Having a craving for teppanyaki and not wanting to drive far, my friend and I decided to hit this place up for lunch.  well it was pretty empty for a Saturday afternoon.  That should have been my first clue.  Hardly anyone at the teppanyaki table.  We both ordered the salmon/shrimp/chicken meal.  I actually did like the salmon, but i found the shrimp to taste gritty.  The chicken was a bit bland.   Nothing really else on the plate besides a wack load of bean sprouts.  The chef did his job with minimum flair...maybe my expectations were too high and I was expecting some big razz-ma-dazz show.  I got a whimper of razz-i-ness.  Sigh.    I am grateful however we decided to go for lunch and pay the cheaper price (compared to dinner prices)."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. Although I haven't been here in 2 or so years, everytime I have gone I have loved it! MAKE SURE to make a reservation and for the seats where they chef cooks in front of you!  You sit around a cooking table and a chef comes in introduces himself, and starts cooking with FLARE! It's almost a show in itself! Juggling around the salt and pepper shakers, lighting fireballs of random things, breaking eggs in a really cool way, it's all really fun and the chefs look like they are having a good time as well. They cook for each person, serve them their food, bid farewell and leave and you can enjoy your tasty meal that was cooked fresh right in front of your eyes!  I wouldn't come here for the sushi but I remember the salmon steak being really good and actually on second thought, everything I had was really really good! It is a bit more of an upscale or business type place but you won't look out of place if you go casual. But go with at least 3 or 4 people, it's really fun!"}
{"text":"Being close to the hotel I stayed at, I drove by the restaurant a few times before I decided to stop in. Normally I'm not a fan of buffets, but it was late and I didn't know the area very well.  The food was surprisingly good. It's not a standard buffet, where everything is cooked at once and left sitting there under heat lamps for a few hours. The server hands you a few order sheets, and you mark down the quantity of each item desired, whether it's sushi, appetizers, soups, noodles, hot dishes, etc., and they make everything to order.  That's correct. Everything was made to order.  This was nice as it let me try a variety of different dishes and appetizers. The sushi was also good, and tasted fresh. The waitstaff was prompt and friendly. I saw that they also offer hibachi, but I didn't try that, as I was dining alone   Definitely worth a try if you're staying. In the area."}
{"text":"Teppanyaki Ume (see picture) is a very good full lunch which includes soup, salad, shrimp appetizer, rice, veggies, chicken and steak. A bit of fun entertainment along the way, too!  For takeout, I like the Katsura Bento (chicken teriyaki).  Really tough to get parking some days."}
{"text":"Ordered the pork Katsu arrived with hard pork  no rice or salad.  I will not be ordering from this place again. We ordered $70.00 worth of food. This is absolutely unacceptable. There was no quality control."}
{"text":"The place is usually packed on weekends.  Make a reservation.  The restaurant has been renovated so it's a lot nicer than before.  You would come here for their teppanyaki show.  The chef stands in front of you and give you a really good show with onion volcano and juggling with salt and pepper.  They also have another section of the restaurant for normal dinning like bento boxes.  They are great for lunch time since they are really fast and cheap.  They have a good Japanese dinning show for a really cheap and reasonable price like around $15 per person and you get alot of food."}
{"text":"food is actually not that bad.  the shrimp tempura was excellent.  the waiting staff was atrocious.  super slow and just brain dead.  the only person who cleaned our table was the manager!  the desert menu is very small.  the also did not have a lot of the stuff that was advertised on the menu.  i did like how they made the maki rolls with real japanese rice.  we paid about $71 for two adults and a 4 year old, tips not included.   the decor is pretty awful.  the chairs were very ugly.  it was very dark inside.  we sat near the windows so that helped a bit in terms of lighting.  i will never come here again.  sorry!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I have enjoyed ordering take out from Memories of Japan. We decided to dine-in for dinner today. I have to say the experience started off decent as it wasn't busy. However, as the evening went on the service continued to go downhill.  The wait between dishes took quite a bit longer than most AYCE buffets I've been to. For most of the evening the server didn't check on us. Seems like the restaurant staff cannot handle the traffic during dinner.   Food isn't much different than any other AYCE, sashimi was good but nothing exciting. Nothing bad about it either.  What really made the night frustrating is towards the end of our meal we wanted to order dessert. My girlfriend continuously tried to flag servers who wouldn't come to our table, then one who appeared to be a manager still with no response.  I don't think we'll be coming back here for dine-in. Just wanted to see what it was like as I always see  it when I pick up our take out."}
{"text":"What happened now than before? I've been there few times since I live near by.  plates are becoming smaller size with same prices. literally...why? absurd prices with tasteless and less ingredients.  i ordered udon soup, it came only udon and soup on hot pot. my grandmother ordered benti box and she wasn't impressed and it tastes bland."}
{"text":"I can't speak for the customer service - because I ordered take-out. I took the sushi order home immediately (less than 10 minute drive) and ate it right away. The sushi had a weird smell to it that I noticed after eating two pieces. Then I noticed a weird taste. I was really sick the next day. Maybe unrelated, but maybe not."}
{"text":"This place used to be our family favourite place for celebrations. It is no longer because of the really slow service. Our reservation wasn't honoured we had to wait over half an hour for teppemyaki table. Then from time we sat took chef 45 minutes to arrive to cook our dinner. Been coming here over 20 years.... they used to do an amazing job getting you in and out in an hour. Management didn't offer us anything :((((((.     I forgot that I promised never to return. We went back tonight and it was just awful.  The chef didn't talk, tell jokes do the egg trick or volcano. The portions small. Quantity small and prices are very expensive.  I PROMISE never never ever to go back to memories of Japan."}
{"text":"Japanese Fried Rice - Excellent Yam Tempura - Great  Avocado Rolls- meh - 8 pieces 6$ or so Yam Avocado Rolls - just okay Service - not the best We did take out, no one looked at us even though we were right in front of the cash register, she was taking more time stapling my receipt than serving me- just bad service for take out in general. I had to reach over the counter and just take it because she was taking too long to serve me.  Would i go back? - only if i was DESPERATE."}
{"text":"In general, this is a very mediocre Japanese all you can eat restaurant. With all the competitions around town, they really need to do better. The sushi wasn't fresh, the waiters showed no interest. One of them was so uninterested she would bypass you when you tried to get her attention, even though she was right by your table. The owner was the only slightly friendly person. Food quality is definitely very poor. Compare to Genghis Khan Mongolian Grill next door, with the same price you get much more, plus fresh food and better service. I wouldn't recommend Memories of Japan to anyone and I would never return."}
{"text":"Service has gotten bad and last time we were there another table complained about it as well.  Enough.  No more."}
{"text":"I have not been to a restaurant with food and service this terrible ever. I cannot figure out how this place has stayed in business for so many years.  Our server could not be bothered to bring our party a dining plate, even after asking multiple times.  The sashimi and sushi tasted like it's been sitting out on the counter for hours. Grilled fish was more like a piece of grilled fat. Grilled chicken was dry, and served cold."}
{"text":"I love there sushi and over all the other food is great. I brought my parents there yrs ago and now that eat there at least once a month. I also used to dine there on a regular basis but I would say the last 4 times that I went there with my husband the service was complete trash.  It's actually sad because I love the food but I've stopped going because the experience just straight up sucks.  It's kinda funny because when I go with my parents the service is fine.  I personally feel like they discriminate against my husband and I probably because we are both young and both dress in \"urban\" attire.  Maybe the assumption is that we won't tip?   Ironically both my husband and I work and are very busy so at minimum half of our meals are eaten outside and we tip every time. I might give them another chance but if the service is bad I will not dine there again.  Oh and ps. The bathroom is often dirty...not the worse I've seen but they could improve on it"}
{"text":"Disappointing.  We came here for a family birthday dinner. As our party of eight included two children, we thought it'd be a fun experience for them. As luck would have it, eight seems to be the ideal number to sit around the teppanyaki grill. Any more and it'd be tight (or you'd be staring at the back of the chef).  Because of the way the tables are designed there are (ideally) two chefs standing back-to-back, each facing their teppanyaki grills, surrounding by a C-shaped arrangement of chairs. I say ideally, as since there are at least a dozen tables going at once, there are more tables than there are available chefs. This means that we sat there staring at the back of one chef as he started cooking for the opposite table. A bit awkward. As I sat there watching from behind, I noticed there was very little interaction between the chef and the patrons, as if he were just performing a bored, stolid rehearsed act. At other teppanyaki places, the interaction and dialogue are a huge part of the experience, equal if not more important than the food. This guy gave a few knife flips, and a bit of fire, and not much else.  Our own chef finally showed up, and I was hoping for better. Instead, we got much less. I might have as well been getting take-out from Terriyaki Experience. He barely spoke a lick of English (this place is run by Chinese), barely had any tricks, and worst of all - WORST OF ALL - his onion volcano, the one that normally shoots out a lovely  plume of fire, was shit. I've jimmied lighters that produce a more impressive flame.  The food itself tasted fine, but even the order in which he cooked it was weird. We got the steak first, with a side of bean sprouts. No rice or anything. So we nibbled on that. About ten minutes later, we finally got fried rice and chicken and veggies. Table opposite received the fried rice first, which makes a helluva lot more sense.  The red bean ice cream was pretty decent, at least.  Stay away."}
{"text":"I rarely give one star reviews, but our food was so bad that I had to grab a veggie burger at near-by Harveys because I was starving and didn't want to pay more to feed myself.  Yes, this review is shorter than most but I'm trying hard not to say any more negative things.  Don't eat here."}
{"text":"I don't normally write reviews, but yesterday's experience was enough to compel me to write this mini novel of a review.  The thing was, it wasn't even anything specifically horrific or out of the ordinary.  It just left a bad taste in my mouth and I'm sick of it.  I used to believe in the old saying \"mom says if you have nothing to say, best not say anything at all\", but then I realized I would not be doing justice to those around me.  This place used to be a local favourite of not just mine, but my whole family.  Growing up we would frequent this establishment because the Teppanyaki experience was just so fun.  I always looked forward to coming here and to us it was just a real treat.  As I grew up and I started working, I didn't have as much time to come as frequently as I used to, but it always held a special place for me.  To me, the memories there were priceless.  When my office relocated to Don Mills and Eglinton/Lawrence area, I was happy that I was able to once again enjoy the food a little bit more frequently, visiting often to pick up food for lunch, or ordering for delivery when I could not leave the office.  However, I started to notice sadly that every experience just deteriorated with every consecutive visit.    Yesterday my team was unpredictably short-staffed and so I needed something quick, so I placed an order to pick up food.  I still like the food there, but the experience was unacceptable.  To be honest it was mainly the attitude that reshaped my good mood walking in, to a pretty unpleasant one.    When I walked in, there was an older lady with short hair standing by the cash.  She was just plain rude; no greeting, and very short with me.  When I received the food, I noticed on the bill that the price was not the same as the website, and when I mentioned this, all she said was \"yeah I know\".  I asked if they were going to update the website and it was just a \"yeah yeah yeah\" to shut me up.  I realized right there that she may have been the one to have taken my call too, and after she had taken my order, there was no mention of the total cost, or any website price adjustments.  On top of that, there were no explanations or apologies for the unexpected price increase.  I honestly was not looking for any freebies, just a simple acknowledgement would have been better than making me feel like it was my fault for not knowing this fact.    Despite being obvious I wasn't quite happy with this surprise or experience from this visit, there wasn't even a thank you or have a nice day.  It was odd that I (as the customer) was the one thanking the establishment - out of habit.  This of course resulted in some slight regret for even thanking them for a sub-par experience.  In the end, I left the place not necessarily angry, but just sad at how far it had fallen from the good times I always remembered this place for.  I'd come here with my friends and have an awesome time.  We would often order delivery when friends were over.  Now I don't even want to call the place.  The only reason I gave it a 2-star instead of 1 was because the food is still good and I can't knock that, no matter how much the lady pissed me off."}
{"text":"Just paid $56 for a so so meal with my wife.  The service was ok....food was another story.  The dynamite roll was the only highlight.  Nice and fresh and no sauce added on top of it.  The stir fried vegetables consisted mainly of mushroom and zuchinni.  The worst part was when we ordered the japanese beef rice.  My wife took a few spoonfuls and on the 3rd spoon, she bit down on something.  Upon further inspection, we discovered it was a full 1 cm sliver of metal (not foil).  It looked like it was a shard from a can that was opened.  We told the wait staff immediately and they just said, \"oh...sorry\".  Based on our experience, we are never going to return.  It was our first time going there."}
{"text":"This is the chef who cooked our meal...no eye contact or spoke to us (other than to ask how we liked our steak).  I brought my kids here for teppanyaki expecting a good show instead they were so disappointed.  The only way I would ever come back again is for lunch and a different chef...dinner is almost twice the price as lunch...each dinner was approximately $30 dollars and with tax I paid $141 + tips.  Disappointing"}
{"text":"What a joke, waiting and waiting for a menu which they finally bring, take forever to take the order, 10 min goes by not even an app! Why???? She forgot to take the order slips out of her pouch and put them in!! Lol pathetic"}
{"text":"Well, I was walking through the parking lot, when I noticed two of the chefs out front having a cigarette break. One was staring at me and hollering at me to get my attention, when he got my attention, the other chef farted as loud as humanly possible. I can't comment on the food because that was enough to make me never want to eat here. I went next door instead. And no chefs farted at me."}
{"text":"Would you take your family out for dinner where you place order foods for 4 people, wait 45min. and it never did show up on your table?    Especially we've already noticed the delay and have escalated the concern to waitress at 30 min. point, to her supervisor 10 min after and still no resolution?  We finally went to the restaurant manager who offered no apology nor compensation. We left the restaurant and will not likely come back."}
{"text":"Probably not a good day to make a review, but I've been here before on other occasions and service has never been this bad.  Today is Father's day. I get it, it's going to be busy. So if we make a reservation at 7:30, please let us know that the time is not doable rather than making us wait over an hour before seating. Not only that, they were short staffed tonight so wait times for teppanyaki chefs were upwards of half an hour after you were seated. So be prepared for a two hour wait minimum even with reservations.  Sometimes this does happen, and it's not in the management's control, but please let us know upon checking in at the host stand. That way we can decide if we want to go elsewhere instead of waiting without any answers. Every time we asked a staff member, they'd throw out a different answer which didn't help us. The other people who were seated at the same grill area as us were getting impatient as well.  Other times we've been here were ok but it seems like the last few occasions we've been here, the wait times have been getting longer as they seem to be losing their chefs too quickly.  So be aware! Make your reservation at 5pm and you'll get to eat after 7pm."}
{"text":"This place has some really good teppanyaki for the price you pay.  I always find the chefs and servers to be very friendly as well.  Always recommend the chicken and steak teppan combo."}
{"text":"Went there as we were invited there for someone's birthday party. The preparation of food (show) is the big draw here.  Having said that, steak, chicken and shrimps were adequately prepared but I won't be running back.  Also, too much hustle and bustle with cooking staff running back and forth excuse me excuse me trying to get past you, etc.  The maki they served before the meal started were absolutely gross.  Hot sitting near the teppan, (ladies forget about wearing makeup), my clothes smelled like oil after I left and a generally unrelaxing dining experience.  Not my kind of place at all.  This is a \"family restaurant\", so for people with young children this is perfect - no one will be upset if your kids get noisy.  Personally, they won't be seeing me there again - not impressed.  Two stars is too generous for this place but I did not know how to give them 1.5.  That's all they deserve.  This is a \"family restaurant\" for people who want to FEEL as though they're eating Japanese and (with all due respect) who don't know any better."}
{"text":"Was previously here about 5 yrs ago, and things appear to have quietened down from then and from the line-ups a decade ago, though we were there at the odd hour of 4pm. Very quite at that time with a resulting slow down in service as well, as it seemed the chef may have been on a break. Once he came though, things started speeding up. Food was very good, nothing exceptional mind you, however for the price it was good value and it was fresh. The chef was funny, bordering on offensive for some people I am sure, however, we enjoyed it as it was all good natured. I would recommend the teppanyaki experience as its certainly better value/price than similar restaurants such as Benihana at the Royal York Hotel and Hibbachi at The Thompson Hotel (a regular Japanese menu is also available). I would not make this a destination for a romantic night out as its very practical in its appearance, décor needs to be modernized, and the location is at a strip mall, so if trying to impress a girlfriend would choose Hibbachi as an alternative. All in all would visit again if in the neighborhood, and in the mood for teppanyaki as I have not tried their other menu."}
{"text":"Awful awful awful. Definitely the worst AYCE sushi experience I've had so far in Toronto and I've been to about 50 different places here and 100 worldwide.   Soft shell crab was soggy and the makis tasted/felt like they were made hours before we ordered them. It was obvious everything had come out of the fridge because the tempura was cold, the crab shell crab was not crunchy, and all the makis were stuck to the plate from the rice having sat there for hours/days so everything fell apart.   The sashimi (salmon and red snapper) wasn't bad. The red & white tuna sashimi was far worse than what I've had at other places.   The seaweed salads are bad even though I've always liked this at every other sushi place.   Orders lost multiple times. 2 hours spent here and we received less than half of what we ordered, plus multiple things we didn't order. They lost out first order and then after a discussion, the waitress brought out our sheet and together we figured out what was missing. Then we filled out another sheet and waited an hour with no food, then the waitress came and brought the bill. We ended up leaving hungry and angry. It was an awful experience and VERY expensive $35/person but there are many AYCE sushi places of higher quality for $25-$30."}
{"text":"Came here last night for dinner and was surprised at how quiet it was. Then I looked at the prices for teppanyaki dinner and realized that might have something to do with it. Dinner ranges from $23 and upwards.  You get miso soup, salad, salmon and cucumber maki, vegetables, fried rice, ice cream and then the price varies depending on the meat you select. I got the chicken and salmon. For five dinners (my daughters shared), and two juice, it came to around $150.   With that being said, however, I can say that dinner experience was enjoyable. Service was efficient and courteous and our chef was funny and entertaining - my daughter was thoroughly impressed! The food itself was good too.    I'd go back, but for lunch, as the price seems a bit more reasonable."}
{"text":"It's pretty good...staff is usually very nice and the food is definitely consistent. I like sitting at the cooking tables but not every item on the menu I enjoy. Teriyaki chicken is always great here."}
{"text":"I fully agree withJason M below. This restaurant has become slow , prices very high and the portions way too small . I received the steak and shrimp and it was dry and had about 10 pieces as another at my table had the same steak but a bigger number of pieces. I think prices and portions are losing customers.  This will be my last visit here , it's value has been removed for my wife and I."}
{"text":"I've dined here a couple of times.. The most recent time was by far the worst experience yet. There was only three of us, and we had dinner AYCE. Our first set of order which was hardly even six choices from the menu took atleast an hour to be served. I am not over exaggerating when I say that.. I live about 5 minutes away from the restaurant, and I've been wearing my contacts all day so because the food took so long to come already being 40 minutes into the wait I left and drove home to get my glasses- drove back and STILL the food wasn't there.   Finally after the blue moon the food was served... Oh, but wait? Only 2/5 things came out so we waited.... and waited.... I asked the server to check on our order because by now we had already put in our second set of order. She told us they were making it but even when the second set of orders came out our FIRST order never did. So basically they forgot. I was pissed off. However the food was decent. The service was horrible, and the waiters weren't helpful at all.   We would ask for water, napkins etc.. Never came unless we reminded them at least 3 times.   Concluding my review. It will be my last time dining there, I do NOT recommend this restaurant. There are other reviews here that make this restaurant look so good. That's just too bad my experience there was the opposite."}
{"text":"I've ate here on 3 different occasions. A week ago, a year ago, and 3/4 years ago.  First time I came here, it was very busy during dinner hours. The decor looks the same now as it did then. The main thing I remember was having lobster sashimi for the first time and it was amazing. I love lobster and was worried about it tasting bad being uncooked, but i was quite impressed.  Second time I came, my friend was working there as a server. It wasn't very busy. He got us the chef who he said was the best chef working there. He was an older man who spoke mandarin. He did do a few tricks, but I guess it's usually the younger guys who like to show off, entertain, and impress. However, his cooking was great. Delicious food. Even complimented me saying how I knew how to eat my steaks; Rare, as oppose to the rest of the table whom ordered medium and medium rare.  Third and most recent time I was there, we requested the Filipino chef. I apologize ahead of time for not remembering his name, but when we requested the Filipino chef they knew who we were talking about. He was very involved with our group and you could tell he enjoyed doing his job. Put on a great show and cooked us an even greater meal. My nephew who is almost 6 said it was his new favourite place to eat. The chef knew how to entertain the 6 year old and even my 85 year old grandpa who is not easily impressed.  Our group got a combo dinner. It was a special that requires a group of 8, everyone got a few maki/sushi rolls, a bowl of salad, miso soup, fried rice, a shrimp, a scallop, chicken, mixed veggies, salmon and steak.  There were a few hiccups though. The servers, although really don't have to do much because the chef does everything, needed to come by more frequently to top of our tea cups, water, and other beverages. For dessert, I got the mango pudding, and noticed it tasted funny. A tad sour, the milk they used may have gone bad. My uncle agreed and we asked for ice cream instead and they were very compliant about it.  Overall, I guess if you know what you want. You'll have a good experience there. I plan on bringing my friend there for his birthday. He has never gone to a teppanyaki place and I think he'd enjoy it. Needless to say, I will be requesting for the Filipino chef again."}
{"text":"Been here for their teppanyaki lunch few times. Love their fried rice and cuttlefish.  Not too salty. Just perfect and tasty."}
{"text":"We ate here today at ( memories of japan ). I say it will be our last! The serving is not overwhelmed due to small portion of the food. Then we order this salmon belly and the lemon still have that sticker from where it  came from. I think for $26 per head is not worth it."}
{"text":"Located on a Don Mills in an area that features a collection of restaurants Memories of Japan doesn't look like much from the outside. Attached to a large strip mall the place is a large corner restaurant divided into three separate areas. A dining area out front devoted to all things sushi, another dining area in back with six large teppanyaki grills for eating and a large sushi bar that runs along one side of the restaurant with a pond on the opposite wall. The decor was heavy on dark wood giving the place the feel of a traditional Japanese ryokan. Each teppanyaki grill had eight seats and we were seated at a table with another family. Teppanyaki is not only about the food but the performance of the teppanyaki chef. Our chef was a young Malaysian guy who knew how to make his audience comfortable drawing us out so that we enjoyed not only his mastery of the grill but also his entertaining patter. The food was delicious and every thing was served up with a sense of professionalism and humour."}
{"text":"Been here twice in the last few months both times for AYCE.  First time service was good and food was fine.  Staff could put more effort into explaining how the AYCE process works.  Last visit knocked two stars off their rating in my view.  Service was slow and rude.  They forgot a couple of our items and when we inquired as to the whereabouts you'd think it was a huge imposition.  For a place not very busy on a Friday night I give this place under six months.  Sorry Memories of Japan I used to be a fan but not anymore."}
{"text":"This place wasn't the best, but it was still okay!   The concept of Teppanyaki is pretty amazing though they underdelivered at this point.   There were two chefs, the first chef did tricks and was a great host! However, when we got the second chef, he did the bare minimum. There was nothing truly exciting about his lack lustre performance.  I ordered number '51' which was a basic lunch at $11. It included, Salad, Miso Soup, Cuttlefish, Chicken, Rice and Ice Cream at the end.   It was great and all, but the service was slow and not really worth the wait."}
{"text":"I will not be back for AYCE.  The menu is very regular and has nothing special.  its competitive nowadays,  the worse was... they did not have a quarter of the things they even list on their already limited menu.  Heres the breakdown:  The staff attending to us was not friendly, anything we ordered he would be rude and tell us they dont have anymore.   for example... soup of the day? no... hamachi neck?  no... hot and sour soup?  no.... beef skewer? ... no...  mango yogurt for dessert? no.... ALL of these things were listed on the menu... they also seem very stinge with everything.    servings are small...which could be a good thing... i ordered beef sashimi.. that must be the most horrifying color i have ever seen... it looked like rotting corpse from the walking dead color.   just looked wrong.. please see pics.     ordered the beef ribs... it came out jet black burnt... see pic.  why would you bother serving it?  it makes no sense.   the dude left a paper on our table and did not take the order, so i brought it to the front since i was going to the washroom...  he then gives me a lecture saying dont give orders to the front desk.   i wouldnt have to if your service was better.  water was never filled once.  the only reason this place gets 2 star is because they had red tuna as a sashimi choice.  which btw came out two different colors.. one time it was red.. the second time i ordered it was light pink... i suspect they gave me F grade fish the second time around.  Oh yea they aint cheap either..  24 dollars weekday dinner.. and heres to top it off.. they only got a \"conditional pass\""}
{"text":"Horrible service and wait times, if you want your food to ever come make sure to remind them every 10 min because the order is more likely to be lost than served. Abnoxious loud waitress too, went there 2 years ago decided to give it a 2nd shot, what a mistake it was."}
{"text":"Great Value for Teppanyaki! ?  We have been to many of the Teppanyaki places in the GTA and have always enjoyed the meals at the Teppanyaki tables at this restaurant.  The prices are great, especially for the service and fun of watching someone fry up your steak and shrimp.  Teppanyaki meals include a few extra things (salmon or kappa maki rolls appetizers, ice cream desert and miso)  that make it a great value.    We have never ordered off the sushi menu,  but the Teppanyaki has always been good."}
