{"text":"I made an 8pm reservation for myself and my special lady friend to take advantage of the 2 for $40 Wednesday night deal (shared appetizer, two entrees and a bottle of wine for $40). We were able to get a seat outside on the patio, which was perfect for the evening. The food was great (even better based on the price of the deal). I enjoyed the pot roast, which I highly recommend. Michael, our server, was attentive and responsive. Overall a great evening!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is lovely and nested away in an adorable part of Cleveland. I've always wanted to try it as it's very close to my work, so when my husband suggested it I was stoked. Our server was Momo. She relayed the special, which was salmon with wild mushroom risotto and asparagus. Sounded great, so I ordered it. Salmon was cold and medium rare (I like medium well, but wasn't asked tho I didn't specify), and the risotto had goat cheese in it. Granted I didn't pry for details but all I ate was the asparagus until our server finally came back around. I asked for a box so I could cook the salmon more at home, and I also asked if the risotto had goat cheese in it and she said she didn't think so. I told her to not box the risotto since I can't eat goat cheese and I definitely could taste it. She came back with our bill, salmon in a box, and apologized but yes the risotto had goat cheese in it. Thanks for confirming, but no offer to send me home with like, more asparagus or orzo instead? $26 for asparagus. Meh. My husbands french fries, though: those were amazing. I'm sure the food would have been great had I known what I was ordering..."}
{"text":"Love the trio option from the menu- since everything that I read sounded so good and the portions were just right so as not to be overstuffed. Thank goodness I was wearing a tie though there was a definite gentile air about the place. I would recommend at least decent slacks and or the proper female equivalent. But all in all neat little gem of the beaten franchise path."}
{"text":"I made a reservation on Friday morning for Saturday night with a preference for sitting outside.  At the time I made the reservation, the forecast was sketchy at best. Saturday night turned out to be beautiful.  I called on our way down to let them know we may be a few minutes late.  To my surprise, our reservation was gone and they did nothing to try to accommodate us.  I suspect they had a rush given the nicer than expected weather.  Unfortunately, they have lost our business for good."}
{"text":"I suggested this place for a family brunch before a trip to the Cleveland Orchestra as I wanted to see the renovations and test out some of the food (after admittedly not being the biggest fan of either when this place was Baricelli Inn). The renovations truly are a big improvement to this place -- the bar at the front entrance is inviting and the various dining spaces (we were tucked into a small side room) are clean and modern. The food was great -- we started with a sampling of the Monkey Bread and Apple Beignets -- the former was loved by my teenage siblings, but I thought the beignets were a little slice of heaven, just the right amount of sweetness. From the main dishes, I had the pot roast hash, and sampled the eggs benny -- both were delicious. The portion sizes were definitely more conservative than your average local breakfast/brunch establishments, but I enjoyed that as it was possible to sample and share more that way. Definitely want to come back for dinner."}
{"text":"Decent food. Poor bartender service, very arrogant and obnoxious. Said we couldn't sit at a table because we were a two top (sat 4) then let a couple sit there 5 min later. It was at bar during HH. I'd come back if he was gone."}
{"text":"On a corner in Little Italy we found this lovely restaurant. Excellently prepared and presented dishes, followed by great service makes this a must stop when in Cleveland. Reasonable pricing, fair wine selection, good beer list and a few craft soda's a little odd but worth a try. We had 3 main dishes, 2 appetizers and deserts all done very well. The duck confit  risotto was my favorite. With the salted Carmel ice cream made the meal."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner last Sunday with a good friend for a belated birthday celebration. (I've been here before previously for lunch and highly enjoyed that experience. 5/5 for lunch)

There is free valet parking behind the restaurant for dinner (but not lunch), which is convenient. When we entered the restaurant, the overall atmosphere was really nice. There is a small lobby/reception area, which is separated from the dining area by a long hallway. We were surprised that there was no one present to greet and seat us, and it took more than a minute before a server passing across the hallway in the dining area noticed us. This normally wouldn't be an issue, but given the set-up of the reception area, there was no employee around at all, nor was there a bell, so it felt mildly awkward.

I ordered the steak frites (hanger steak and fries). I got the steak medium rare, as recommended by the menu and server. The meat was very tender and overall good texture, but I realized shortly into the meal that I'm more of a \"medium\" steak girl. This is to no fault of the restaurant, just personal preference. The seasoned fries are amazing, however! They reminded me of the rosemary fries at B-Spot, but are more delicious and generous in quantity.  The price was a bit steep considering what I got, which is why I'm docking a star. The entree cost $30 by the time tax/tip were factored in. (I didn't order anything else.)

Overall:
Pros: Atmosphere, good service, good flavor & texture of food
Cons: Poor welcome at reception, price (a bit hefty for a student's budget and for so-so portion size)"}
{"text":"The first time we eat here was for dinner after a 6 hr. bike ride and we were hungry.. I ordered the strip steak and it was seasoned and cooked to perfection I was very happy with my meal. My husbands was just ok... we have already forgotten what it was. 
The seconded time was for Sunday brunch we sat down and Amanda our server brought us monkey bead, this was a gooey bit of perfection. Not being able to ever forget that steak, My husband ordered the steak and eggs..... It was amazing cooked to perfection then topped with scallions, parsley, and garlic combined in a amazingly light refreshing sauce..Loved it . I ordered the pot roast hash with a poached egg. The sauce was a bit heavy for my taste and the egg over cooked.
My recommendation for this is always get the steak!"}
{"text":"The ambience is great, the service terrific and knowledgeable, the food and menu was perfect and the price very reasonable - between casual and expensive.  We would not hesitate to go back and will be back soon."}
{"text":"We had a living social deal for brunch and I am sure glad we did!  The brunch started with a mimosa and a Bloody Mary, both were fantastic. The drinks were good, but couldn't compare to the Monkey Bread. The trip was worth the Monkey Bread, but the brunch and service was also excellent."}
{"text":"Fantastic service! Delicious food and a lovely atmosphere. Blew my boyfriend and I away!"}
{"text":"Nice renovation of a classic Cleveland spot! Will be back. The Wednesday $40 menu is hard to beat."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. Both times I have had consistently decent food. The desserts have always been good. Either sorbets or the ice cream trio ( my favorite). The wp burger i adore. the cheese plate is always a safe thing although the gorgonzola might have been a little too sharp for my taste. 

service is impeccable. drinks are well made."}
{"text":"We came for dinner with high expectations after hearing great reviews and watching the video clip on the web. I can say the dinner did not come close to any of our expectation. The scallops over lentils were  overcooked and under sauced making them difficult to eat. The lentils were undercooked and were so heavily peppered they couldn't be eaten. Two of our group had this dish and both made the same comments. The pork belly over Asian noodles was absolutely tasteless and the server only brought us one order when we had ordered two of these appetizers. The duck confit was marginal. The duck was too dry. 
I will definitely state the Mac & Cheese dish is worth every penny, it was not disappointing in any way. The short ribs and pot roast dish also were also both very good. It seems as if you stay with the comfort foods and away from anything that takes too much effort from the kitchen you will be OK."}
{"text":"Went for the first time on a Wednesday and was thrilled with the 2-for-$40 special...not to mention the food was delish. I got the beef (I think it's pot roast?) and DH got chicken. We came back on a Saturday night, ordered the same thing and we were both a little thrown by the difference. We'll give it one more try because it's close to everything we do, they have a well appointed bar, a decent wine list and a great atmosphere. I hope whoever was cooking last Saturday has been demoted to valet."}
{"text":"Location _ little Italy in Cleveland. easy to find. Complementary valet (valet guy was very nice and professional). on site parking and big.
Interior _contemporary. Modern light colors. everything had a certain flow of subtle and unimposing colors. Even menu covers were designed to match the flow and feel of the restaurant. Decent size bar with nice wine selection. Just from observing this placer offered some what  diverse wine and beer options. Dining room is cozy and welcoming, however, tables set up a bit too close to each other. Wonderful enclosed patio with a view onto the garden. Very comfortable chairs. lighting was perfect. Open kitchen. 
Food _ yummy. seven peppers soup was delicious. A bit spicy but not overbearing. Duck was ok. Flavorful but felt like left overs pieces were served. Tough time cutting through the meat. Shrimp and grit was amazing. Perfectly cooked and  full of amazing flavors. Three ice cream desert was perfect way to end the meal (Guinness ice cream...need I say  more)
Service _ Perfect. Bar tender seemed a little uncertain opening a bottle of wine but courteous . Our server was perfect. She made perfect recommendations and spend just enough time at our table. 
Price - a $30 dollar bottle, two soups, two entries, and one desert - $95. Very reasonable.
If not for the duck would have been 5 stars. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Monkey Bread Monkey Bread Monkey Bread
Brunch here is awesome for aforementioned reasons. I usually get the steak and eggs which is great. The mussels appetizer is pretty big and really great for sharing with a group. 
ALSO, love the $5 burger and fries. Simple, well done, flavorful and cheap! Their drink specials change all the time and they're always great. 
The service is always top notch from the hostess to the server to the valet guys. 
I loooovve the patio in the summer!! 
Their donut bread pudding from Presti's, I have never had it at Presti's but it is foodgasmic. 
Summary: MONKEY BREAD, DONUT BREAD PUDDING, BURGER NIGHT"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and everything was excellent. The fries are especially good.The food, the wine, the service = A+."}
{"text":"We sat in the lounge and the atmosphere was fantastic. As was the service. The mushroom risotto took the whole experience to a new level previously occupied by their garlic aoli topped frites!"}
{"text":"Two words: Icewine Martini!!!

ok so i'll add a few more. I've been to Washington Place twice now.  The first time with two friends and the second with a very large group (with reservation). The place looks great and feels cozy. There are several dining rooms which make the experience more intimate. The staff was attentive and helpful, providing descriptions and suggestions. They handled our massive group really well, even accomodating latecomers. 

The food is impressive and refined and rich. I would describe it as classy comfort food. The prices are upscale, but not outrageous. They give you breads to start with, both types are heavy and delicious. I can vouch for the Spiced Apple martini and the icewine martini (to those who denounce mixing wine and liquor, you're missing out!!!) both being pretty fabulous. Appetizers aren't immense in quantity for sharing, however the oxtail pierogies were quite tasty. At my first meal, I had the pork. Gahhh, it was amazing. Well brined, cooked perfectly and a very large portion. At the recommendation of the server, for my second meal, I tried the Hanger Steak. They don't cook to order, and it comes medium rare (quite pink aka perfect). So if you are someone who has the desire to chew on some leathery overdone meat don't come here asking for it. The thinly sliced beef has a sauce of blue cheese which is phenomenal. Opposing it on the plate is a canister of fancy fench fries drizzled with a malt vinegar aoli which is ridiculously good. In addition, my friend had nothing but praises for the pot roast. This restaruant has great sauces and really takes care to cook each and every item to perfection. 

As for the desserts, the warm bread pudding was super but, quite possibly outshined by the melty vanilla ice cream plated with it, mmm.The pumpkin cheesecake was very cute and wasn't bad, but it was sort of weird, and a bit of a letdown in comparison to everything else.  

So much more on the menu I want to try. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant. Very pleasant out door patio. Some of the menu can be pricey but there are a lot of reasonable options. The burger is great. My girlfriend always gets the fries and Mac and cheese. They have a different drink special every day. Today was a delicious citrus gin and tonic. Highly recommend this place to eat. I've never been to the hotel. They have free valet parking too."}
{"text":"I've been to Washington place for brunch and dinner, and the food is always top quality, and great service!  They do have great happy hour deals as well."}
{"text":"We are in Cleveland twice a year for medical appointments. We have tried several wonderful restaurants over the tears. Johnny's Downtown is wonderful always, but a long drive or taxi from the University Circle areas. We love the Glidden House and neighbor restaurant Sergio's . But we discovered The Washington Place Inn and Bistro. The Inn is exceptional. The Bistro is fab. We dined there tonight. We both had a house salad. Wonderful Bibb or Boston lettuce and trimmings plus excellent lite dressing. My husband had the short ribs. I had shrimp and grits. Both dishes were fabulous ! As a Southerner and frequent visitor to Charleston, I know my shrimp and grits. This dish was wonderful and would rival Slightly North of Board Restaurant in Charleston,S.C. Our waitress was excellent and was covering all the tables on the porch. The service was excellent. PS    We love staying here in this wonderful Inn."}
{"text":"best shrimp in grits youll find in cleveland. Period. The end. So good. Oh and everything else is great. The  mussels are delicious, the burgers are mouthwatering. Great date spot."}
{"text":"Wonderful boutique hotel. The food is fairly priced and out of site. Openly viewable kitchen. Best shrimp and grits I've ever had. Great cocktails and good wine selection. An absolutely wonderful place to stay when you're in university circle/little Italy."}
{"text":"This place is awesome !! I went in here the other day because I live in Little Italy. But it is worth the drive even if you live far way. I ordered the Ohio Mule and it was served in a copper cup like it should be.  The bartender told me about the hamburger special. It was 5 dollars when ordered with a beverage. This was hands down the best burger I have EVER eaten. I then got a Beer and my bill was only 18 dollars. They also have very high end food at a great price. Everyone who served me treated me with respect and seemed happy to be working there. I'm definitely gonna be going here regularly. If you are coming to Little Italy you should make this place your first stop."}
{"text":"Got the Thursday/Friday $5 burger special.... Honestly it was okay. The meat had no flavor, lack of spice, and was nothing special. The meat tasted like a big nothing. It wasn't bad but it wasn't the best.. The bun was amazing. It tasted like it came right out the bakery and the fries are amazing. In conclusion, don't get this if u want quality food. It was pretty normal with some good parts."}
{"text":"Great place for a nice dinner in Cleveland.  Lots of atmosphere and superb menu. We always return."}
{"text":"We had a terrible male server who had no idea what he was doing. We waited 15 minutes without seeing him. When the hostess came to bus the next table, we had to ask her for water and to send our server over. Before he came to us, he went to the table next to us. They complained that they never received their second drinks, needed a carry out box, and never got their bill. They were going to be late for a show at Severance. He showed no compunction, did not apologize. When he finally came to our table, again, nothing about the wait. No, \"how are you tonight?\" Just, \"are you ready to order?\" Seriously. When he took food orders for a newly-sat table of 5 before he took ours, we left."}
{"text":"Establishment is solid, with an environment that expertly blends both classic tastes in a modern setting. Favorites here include the burger (well put together) as well as the shrimp and grits. The 2 for 40 special they run on Wednesdays is a fantastic value."}
{"text":"Great place for Happy Hour!! The $5 Happy Hour is wonderful. Their appetizers are amazing and the drinks are great. They also have free valet. My favorite appetizer is the calamari.

Never come for dinner but I hear it is great!"}
{"text":"Shrimp and Grits were excellent. Service was real slow. 40 mins after we ordered we received out meals. Also took a long time to get our drinks.  The others in our group agreed that the food was good but service was lackluster. Food was good enough to 
warrant another try"}
{"text":"Have been here several times now. Walked in tonight and was greeted by two servers who never bothered to get me a menu. Stood up and got my own. Waited for 25 minutes for a drink. My order was taken twice, but no one ever brought me my drink. Finally left after half an hour without being given a glass of water."}
{"text":"Five of us were there at 6 to enjoy the happy hour and sit on the patio, lovely.  Unfortunately those on the patio  are not eligible for happy hour unless you are there before 5.  You could enjoy the specials in the bar which seats about 20 and had no available seating.  The regular menu was unimaginative and disappointing.  Won't be back - too many rules."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Food was delicious. Will be back soon. Would recommend this place to friends."}
{"text":"My husband and I stayed at the Inn and ate at the Bistro, so this is my collective review for both.

The food at the Bistro was pretty good, and we would both eat there again. We ordered brunch - he got chicken and waffles, I got eggs in a basket with chorizo sausage and potato hash. We also received complimentary monkey bread, which was delicious. His waffle was thick and fluffy and the chicken was fried to perfection. My eggs were done perfectly, although the toast was burnt black in a few spots. 

The room (as well as the rest of the hotel) looked nice and was decorated well. The glass shower gave it a nice luxurious feel, and it had some nice amenities (fresh baked cookies, K-cups for the Kurig, nice toiletries). The reason for the star rating is because the bed was not comfortable and the walls were paper thin. Being able to sleep and be comfortable at a place you're paying to sleep and be comfortable is a pretty big part of the experience. We both woke up no less than ten times during the night. I wouldn't consider myself to be a light sleeper, and I was able to fall asleep quickly even though I could still hear the music from the restaurant inside our room (as the first floor rooms are directly above the kitchen and restaurant). It was the loud crashing coming from the kitchen after 11 P.M. that first woke me. After that, it was multiple police sirens outside, our neighboors (even though they weren't even loud - like I said, the walls are extremely thin), anytime someone was in the hallway/opened the door to our floor, etc. Aside from that, the mattress was a bit saggy and the feather pillows, although usually a nice touch, have fallen completely flat.

In summary, I would recommend eating here, but it's not the place to stay if you require quiet or comfort in order to sleep."}
{"text":"Celebrating with my son on a Sunday, and he recommended this lovely place! A bit worried since his taste tends toward pizza and beer, but he was spot-on here. The ambiance was perfect for quiet brunch conversation on a beautiful sunny day. The food was very tasty and presented beautifully, but perhaps best of all was the service which was attentive, friendly but not intrusive. Just need to go back soon and try the monkey bread!!"}
{"text":"History: 
Washington Place Bistro & Inn is a surprisingly sturdy replacement to the historic Baricelli Inn, which was a Cleveland landmark for over 25 years. And though Baricelli Inn closed up shop in July 2010, the Barcelli name lives on at Washington Place - the new restaurant features Baricelli cheese (winner!)  Washington Place Bistro & Inn still operates the \"Inn\" portion, with 7 rooms available for an overnight getaway. I didn't check the rooms out but their website lists rack rate at $139 / night.

Service:
The quickest way to win my heart at a new restaurant is prompt and attentive service. Washington Place knocked it out of the park! I arrived about 20 minutes before my dining companion (which literally never happens) and the server immediately offered a cocktail list and recommended a few personal favorites. Throughout dinner service (we had 3-courses), flatware was refreshed, drinks refilled, courses recommended. The manager came out to say hello to dinners in our space. 

Food: 
1st Course: 
Roasted Cauliflower Bisque: [ crumbled blue cheese , balsamic gastrique]
:: 3.5 out of 5 :: 
The soup had good texture but I was expecting a stronger flavor. The bleu cheese added some saltiness and depth. Balsamic did not do much. 


2nd Course: 
Mack & Cheese [ mackenzie and baricelli cheeses, local chorizo, goat cheese strudel, micro greens ]
::4.5 out of 5 ::
Get this. Noodle used is pasta al ceppo, a personal favorite.  Cheese blend, perfectly salty and creamy. Chorizo, pieces were sized to stand up next to noodles, flavor was spicy with sweet cinnamon flavor at the end. Goat cheese strudel was a placed atop and I wish I dug into this first. YUM.  An ounce more of greens to cleanse your palate a bit from all the richness would make it perfect. 


Dessert:
Presti's Glazed Donut Bread Pudding with Jeni's Ugandan Vanilla Bean Ice Cream.
:: 5 out of 5 ::
If this isn't a staple dessert, it needs to be immediately. The dessert is made to order so it came out warm and smelling to heaven of glazed, cinnamon. The Jeni's vanilla has enough flavor compliment the sugary dough (boring vanilla makes me sad). 


I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Solid four star. 
Really should have been a five.
My waiter had a sweaty lip and that was kind of yuck.
A bit pricy but they spent a good amount of time on the food - price justified.
Staff all friendly. 
No other sweaty lips I could see so perhaps I should have gotten up and dabbed off my waiter's... done him a little lip service.

Had great squash soup (light, no cream)
Roasted Beet Salad (so good)
Some vegetable entree
No desert

Wine - beer looked great but went with wine."}
{"text":"I would eat every single thing on the menu it's that delicious. I don't like salmon and would even try it here because the food is that kind of good. The Mac and cheese is the best I've ever had and I've never scraped the bottom of a plate of Mac and cheese before! The cheese board was outstanding. The honey paired with the cheeses was even better than what gets served at Mario Battali's Eataly! Everything was so good we came back for brunch - it wasn't as spectacular as dinner but still yummy. Highly recommend this place and so surprised that it's never packed."}
{"text":"My last visit to Washington Place was a 4, however I have to give it a 3 this time due to food and service. Our party of 6 was there for over 3 hours which is a bit much even for this group of chatty folks. 

The food was good, not great. One couple started with the potato \"skins\" which were inedible even after sending them back. The potatoes were hard. We had the oxtail pierogies which were ok. Nice flavor, but hardly any meat. One person had the squash bisque which she really liked. 

On to mains, the fish and chips was good. Nothing to write home about though. The duck was lacking a crispy skin and it was somewhat tough. Apparently the pot roast was quite good, as was the veal. 

We all seemed to enjoy the Presti's donut bread pudding for dessert. 

So all in all, I'd go back if someone wanted to go, but it wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"Washington Place has worked its way into my favorites. The happy hour specials are great and the drinks and food are always on point. The mussels here are the best and during happy hour, they're even better! ;)

We chose to stay here after our wedding for a little stay-cation and everything was perfect. I couldn't have asked for a better Inn for this special time of our lives. (Despite the rickety heating system...minor detail, though, if you ask me.) The staff was great and we even befriended a bartender, who my husband has a bit of a beer bromance with now. When we stayed, we had brunch, which was awesome. The chicken and waffles were so peppery and delicious! 

Recently, we went for the $6 burger deal on Thursday and it was SO tasty. One of the best burgers I've ever had and cooked perfectly--for $6? You can't say no. Just be careful, as the burger nights get a little crazy.  

Definitely a must try for anyone in the area--whether you're brunching, happy hour-ing, or vacationing, Washington Place knows how to do things right."}
{"text":"From the positive reviews of Washington Place I began seeing/hearing a few weeks back I knew that it wouldn't take much coaxing to get the fiance to take me there for a lil date.

While I never made it to Baricelli (which seems to ignite rage within the hearts of my foodie friends - hey, I lived out of town for a decade!) and have no point for comparison, I can say that I really loved what was done with the space.  This mansion has been modernized in a tasteful, stylish way.  It's on trend but certainly not trendy.  You walk in and immediately feel like you're in a carefree luxury space.  The complimentary parking wasn't a bad touch either.

Many of the cheese ingredients included in dishes still come from the Baricelli producers.  For those foodies out there still wanting to experience a taste of what was.

The cocktails at this place are outstanding and reasonably priced.  I ordered the Ginger Sidecar and the fiance had a Dark and Stormy.  

As for the food, we ordered several smaller plates to share, as we are want to do:

1)  Roasted Beet & Goat Cheese Salad
2)  Oxtail Pierogies
3)  Mack and Cheese (named for the Mackenzie Creamery)
4)  Steamed Asparagus
5)  Presti's Glazed Donut Bread Pudding

It was a lovely meal - in fact one that ranked with some of the best that the we had experienced together.  All ingredients were expertly selected and for the most part impeccably prepared.  The pierogies + mack were incredibly full-flavored and carefully balanced.  Both dishes ran the risk of being too rich, but we opted for the smaller size of both (*some dishes do come in half + full sizes) which allowed us to experience just enough of each dish while still leaving us satisfied.

We were told that the guest rooms in the Inn portion will be available to book sometime in January.  If they're as well-appointed and comfortable as the rest of the space is, I could see this making for a great getaway within walking distance of Little Italy + University Circle."}
{"text":"Watch out for the worst service on earth by Lisa. Food is 3-4 stars but the waitress just helped dock off 2."}
{"text":"I've usually been here for brunch, and boy do they let the B team handle that. Service is inattentive but not terrible. Monkey bread is nice. Brunch entrees are hit or miss. The Crab Benedict, for example, had the least fresh crab I've ever tasted. 

Otherwise the drinks are strong, so that's a plus."}
{"text":"Appetizer and meals were well prepared. The jam was exquisite.  

Vegetables were fresh, meals hit when served. Server was attentive and polite. 

On a side note, their Martinis are quite good as well! Easy parking, full bar, good atmosphere, and excellent food. What more could I want?"}
{"text":"Have tried this place now three times so I can say this is probably a pretty accurate review.. in my opinion anyways. Went the first time on a Wednesday when we went for the 2 for $40 deal [bottle of wine, appetizer, two entrees=$40] we didn't end up ordering off this menu because it was too limited but it's still a great deal. Ended up with the risotto and a salad and a bottle of wine, delicious. Tables are a bit close together for busy nights like this; I think I overheard a business deal going on behind me, but all the same it was a good experience. 
Second time I went was with my husband on a Saturday night; decently busy, we made reservations just to be on the safe side. Dinner as delicious and we both appreciated the local products. Only minus was they had no non-alcoholic beers but our server quickly returned to the table to let us know they would have them by our next visit. Snaps to her.
Last time we went was just this past Sunday for brunch; quiet enough but perfectly homey all the same. Portions were small yet filling which we appreciated as we didn't get the \"denny's\" sized plates of food. Hot coffee and delicious mimosas/bloody mary's tied everything together.
In a nutshell this place is great. Perfect way to update the overpriced Baricelli...... now we can go back within the month and still pay our bills!"}
{"text":"We went for the brunch on a Saturday without making a reservation, and were seated in a few minutes by a hostess who was friendly but unfortunately not impressively dressed for such an establishment. I am of the opinion that any hostess at a restaurant should never turn up for work in casual footwear, i.e. sandals or flip flops.
Having said that, I must state that the overall service is very friendly and efficient.
We were served a complimentary dish of monkey bread - one of the best we have ever tasted! My husband ordered the salmon BLT - he said it was good. The accompanying fries were limp - yes, we know they are fresh fries but limp fries are not very appealing even though they came with a great aioli. I ordered the fried chicken and waffle. When you see \"fried chicken\" , don't you visualize crispy juicy chicken? Yes, the chicken was very crispy. No, it was not juicy. If I had known that it would ALL be strips of fried chicken breast meat I would not have asked for that dish. The waffle was nothing to rave about. I'll definitely try something else the next time."}
{"text":"It's taken me nearly a week to write this review because I'm so torn.

The experience was great.  The food was great.  But I don't feel compelled to go back.  And I'm not sure why.

The BF and I started with happy hour at the bar:

Pork Belly: 4/5.  While delicious, it was missing something to make it 5-star excellence.

French Fries: 3/5.  I was underwhelmed by these, but I'm also a french fry snob.  However, the dipping sauce that they come with is really good.  The BF gives the sauce alone a 5.

Vietnamese Calamari: 5/5.  Definitely the happy hour star.  Cooked perfectly and seasoned perfectly.  Best calamari I have ever, ever had.

Cheese Puffs: 3/5.  These underwhelmed me.  Throw some melted cheese in the center of these babies, and you'll have a 5-star app.

Drinks: 3.5/5.  We sampled 5 different martinis (lavender, lemon drop, sparkling cosmo, cherry cheesecake, icewine martini).  The BF loved the lavender and lemon drop, but I wasn't terribly impressed with the three I had.  Although, they did get me pretty drunk.

Overall, I think happy hour is worth trying out.  They have some solid drink options and really good food options.  Not the best happy hour in the city, but it's definitely on the top of the list.

We were seated for dinner at 5:30, and the restaurant is beautiful; one of the most romantic restaurants I've been to in the area.  It was the perfect place to celebrate Valentine's Day.  Our waitress was very friendly, too.

Oxtail Pierogies: 5/5.  SO SO SO SO GOOD.  This dish was the overall star of the evening.  The oxtail is served over the pierogie instead of inside, which I think made the dish perfect.  It metled in my mouth.

Shrimp & Grits: 5/5.  The third star of the evening.  I don't even like  grits (hate the texture) but I wanted to lick the plate clean.  Smooth and cheesy and yummy.

Veal Meatloaf: 4/5.  This was the BF's main course.  He said it's the best meatloaf he has ever had...but it's still meatloaf.  The white cheddar mashers weren't memorable.  While this plate was delicious, nothing took it over the top.

Mack and Cheese: 4/5.  Really frickin' good.  Very rich and creamy, as to be expected.  The flavors worked really well together.  However, I've had better macaroni and cheese elsewhere, so I can't give it the full 5-stars.

Jeni's Ice Cream Trio 4/5- The homemade cones were really, really salty.  While I usually like the salty/sweet combo, I felt it interfered with the Jeni's.  Also, I wish they had used Jeni's creative flavors instead of chocolate, vanilla, and pear.

So, while everything was really, really good, there's nothing that really makes me want to come back.  I feel like we've tried most of the exciting things on the menu, and none of it was enticing enough to make me want to come back again.  However, there isa good chance that in a couple of months I'll get a hankering for some good calamari and find myself at the happy hour once more!"}
{"text":"Ambiance:  4.  Let me start by saying I never frequented the old Barcelli Inn at this location. That said, loved the modern but cozy plantation-like feel.  Open air kitchen you walk by on the way to tables is a nice touch, especially reassuring for those of us that have seen the movie Waiting.  One note -- there's various rooms so if you like a certain dining experience  you need to call ahead and ask for that (quiet, outside, larger room, etc.).  However, the distance from main drag of Little Italy and area surrounding it leaves something to be desired, and would be the likely reason I don't return on a regular basis.

Cost:  4. Most appetizers were slightly pricey in my opinion, BUT portions were generous.  As far as meals go typical mid to high end restaurant with ~$20 meals but a little higher after including sides  and/or salad.

Food Quality: 5. Local sourcing, good variety but not too many items that you think they're just using a all encompassing cookbook.  Appetizers outshined the main meal slightly (calamari featured very light and fluffy breading, while the shrimp and grits was also something special), but still I enjoyed the perch & lobster cake special I had.  Another in our party commented the Mahi Mahi was outstanding.

Service: 5. Waitress was great, bus staff excellent as well -- constant water refills (a key myself) and did not rush to take our plates away.  Oh, and the waitress actually knew something about menu when we asked questions.

When to return:  Any and all. Great for happy hour, summer time (great patio), special occasions (secluded rooms) and dates."}
{"text":"I've always wanted to try the food at Washington Place Bistro but I've never been inside until recently because I wasn't sure if I could afford it. But little did I know, this place has fantastic happy hour deals everyday of the week and a sweet 40 dollars for 2 deal on Wednesdays. If I had known this, I would have come as soon I started living in Cleveland. 

I came for the $6 burger night with a group of friends and we all ordered the same thing. A HUGE burger came out. I thought a six dollar burger might be a smaller version of their usual burger, but the waiter promised we were getting the real deal (on the menu, this is their $13 dollar burger). It was super juicy, full of flavor. I polished off that bad boy in no time and then proceeded to devour my fries. Really, you could not be getting a better deal with this burger combo. 

I'm definitely down to come and try the food again any time. YUM. BTW, if you bring your Case/UH ID, you can get an extra discount!"}
{"text":"We went there for wifey's birthday and ordered ny strip steak and seafood risotto. Risotto was awesome and very flavorful but the steak was somewhat disappointing considering its price. The steak cost $38 and didn't come with any side; you had to pay $15 extra to get sides and I believe it was not worth it. I would try risotto again though."}
{"text":"Had a group of friends here the other day... The decor is part of the charm - set in an classic home/inn, you're eating in a re-purposed dining room, now parcelled out to multiple tables. 

The menu is short, but selected to showcase what the team wants to highlight.  If you need a certain type of food every where you go- you might not have that option here.

I did enjoy the Oxtail Ragu and risotto.

The balance of seasonings are a tad salty for my taste - which isn't a killer, but, if you happen to like things to be a little more bland, be prepared for it.

Wine list is limited, but charming."}
{"text":"Several great veg options (vegan less so) but you need to ask ahead since on the menu most of them come with meat.

Excellent: the fries, the blue cheese mashed potatoes, the greens, the cauliflower gratin.

Very good: the vegetable napoleon, the brownie sundae.

The place has been completely remodeled from the very dated Baricelli In.. We got a chance to see some of the rooms and they are very nice."}
{"text":"Washington Place Bistro lives up to the hype! I was very excited to come and eat here finally with my wonderful bf. It was a beautiful, breezy Cleveland summer day and we sat outside for the happy hour. It was pretty empty when we came in (at 4:30pm, haha).

We tried a few things:

FAV: Pork Belly Sandwich -- wow, so delicious and tender! It almost literally melts in your mouth. The manchengo fondue and truffle sauce were SO tasty. 

GOOD: Braised pot roast -- again, the meat almost fell apart when you put your fork in it. The garden carrots were also unique and fresh! Who doesn't love gravy on mashed potatoes.

The $5 happy hour goat cheese and chorizo strudel, based on the Mack and Cheese. We are pretty sold on getting the Mack and Cheese in the future.

Heirloom tomato salad - very refreshing. Love the Mackenzie goat cheese! (local)

I've also tried the asparagus bisque before--very, very good!

I'd definitely go back to try more!"}
{"text":"Best service and food I've experienced since moving to Cleveland. Charming atmosphere and amazing experience. 10/10."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time on 2/2!  Great service, food was very good but not so over the top good that I can give the fifth star. One steak was cooked correctly, one was over cooked. Shrimp and grits were tasty..chicken Marsala was good but luke warm. Restaurant was attentive but will absolutely return and look to give the 5 Star!!"}
{"text":"Two words: HAPPY HOUR!! 

Their happy hour menu is out of this world, with different offers every weekday! My favorite is the $6 burger and fries deal on Thursdays and Fridays from 7-10pm. I got my burger medium rare, which is what the waiter suggested. The burger was so juicy and scrumptious!! It comes with onions and mushrooms, which made the burger that much better! It also comes with a side of two sauces, one of which was garlic and the other some type of BBQ. YUM! I slathered both sauces on my burger and dipped my fries in them religiously. 

In order to redeem the $6 deal, you have to purchase a drink. Any drink will do! I ordered the lavender peach soda ($3.5) because that just sounded delicious. But it tasted like sparkling water with a tiny hint of lavender. No bueno! I suggest just order a fountain drink if you want to save money. 

Keep in mind that you cannot make reservations if you're planning to get the burger deal! Seating is only available in the bar area, first come first serve! But, the bar area is pretty decent in size, with 4-5 tables that can fit up to 20 people :) Also keep in mind that the service is a tad bit slow. We waited about 30 minutes for a table and then another 20 minutes for the burgers. To be fair, we had a party of 9 and we went on a Friday night.

I'm definitely coming back to try more of their happy hour items!"}

{"text":"The seating outside is dreamy. The mack and cheese I will be back for again! But, it was pretty pricey and I left still hungry. That's after having bread, two appetizers (between five people) and a meal."}
{"text":"Totally enjoyed my experience . The atmosphere was relaxing, the service was excellent and the food delicious . Will definitely return and recommend to family and friends. I also loved having valet parking. The young men were very polite and quick."}
{"text":"BEST pot roast, ever.  I am not a \"gourmet\" and never will be, but I do appreciate when food is cooked well, and this pot roast was so tender it literally melted in my mouth.  The presentation was great, the waiter for our table of 10 was on top of everything, very personable.

As other reviewers have mentioned, we went with the \"2 meals for $40\" special, there was plenty of food.   I will be back!"}
{"text":"I don't know why I've never been to Washington Place before, but I am about to make up for lost time and come back again and again!  

A pretty big group of us went straight after clinic today (a Tuesday) so we were the only ones in the whole place right at 5.  That worked out great for us since we were able to take up a big portion of the bar area and take advantage of the drink specials and small plates.  Every Tuesday has half off any bottle of wine under $75 which is a great deal!  They also had specialty drinks and happy hour prices for certain glasses of wine and beer.  

As far as the food goes, oh my goodness was it delicious!  One of the small plates specials was pot roast Mac and cheese so I shared that with a friend in addition to our meals \"just to taste it.\"  Well let me tell you, I was *this* close to ordering another serving to go because I could not get enough!  Something about the amazing, succulent meat with the very doughy noodles (they HAVE to be homemade) was to die for. I also had the burger which was perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned, and just all around perfect.  I could have drank the aoli that came with the fries... Absolutely amazing.  

Our server was incredibly attentive and no one had to ask twice for anything (and most of the time we didn't even have to ask once!). 

I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Expensive but the fries were so delicious...and everything was made great! Would to again for a nice dinner or date. They were pretty busy when we were there but they stopped by other tables more than ours."}
{"text":"Let's start with brunch. I've been here multiple times for the pot roast hash. The pot roast is perfect- tender and flavorful, with root veggies. It's the ideal brunch comfort food.
Their dinner menu is fantastic. I love the salmon. They cook it perfectly. Roasted crispness on the outside and then melts in your mouth when you take a bite. I die. They have a great special on Wednesdays - $40 for two people to split an appetizer and a bottle of wine and then two entrees. My only complaint is they could stand to switch out the 2 for $40 menu every so often - or maybe they do; I've only had it twice but it was the same with a long time in between visits.
Add on to their delish food the great atmosphere. Love the inn-style interior. Homey, but not too homey. The outdoor patio looks super cute and romantic, but I have yet to sit out there because I've only been there when the weather is a bit chilly. Gotta get there again soon!"}
{"text":"Great find in Little Italy!  Loved the atmosphere at the bar, staff were all very attentive and pleasant.  And dinner was amazing - calamari starter and meatloaf yum!  Dining room has intimate feel but isn't stuck up - lots of happy customers just enjoying a leisurely meal. Can't wait to go back and try something else."}
{"text":"After multiple visits and many different meals we continually return to this place. Chief among favorites is the Shrimp&grits and Meatloaf. Pleasant surroundings, nice staff and perhaps the most beautiful building in Little Italy. Go! We know you'll love it!"}
{"text":"Perfect location for an after work happy hour, or a weekday date night! Sitting outside in the sun, in the summer, surrounded by trees, was my favorite bit. The food was definitely above average."}
{"text":"I love this place more and more each time that I go.   My husband and I had dinner at Washington Place Bistro on a Wednesday night, which is 2 for $40 night.  1 starter, 2 entrees and a bottle of wine for $40..  What a deal!  We once again sat on the enclosed patio, which I love.   We started with a bottle of the house Pinot Grigio whcih was pretty tasty.   There are 2 whites and 2 red offered as part of the special. We ordered the Asian confit chicken wings from the specials menu and I ordered the wedge salad from the regular menu.   My husband loved the wings, nicely cooked and well seasoned, portion was a bit small especially for sharing which is why I'm glad that I ordered a salad for myself.  The wedge salad was just ok.   Wedge of iceberg lettuce, bleu cheese dressing, balsalmic tomatoes (nice touch), few bacon bits and croutons(confused....didn't need the croutons).  I would have liked some hardboiled eggs perhaps and some minced red onion.  I ordered the wild mushroom meatloaf, and my husband had the braised pot roast, both entrees were accompanied by garlic mashed potates and baby heirloom carrots.   My meatloaf was TO DIE FOR!!!!   Great texture, generous portion, wild mushrooms mixed with pork and veal, with a bit of a smoky tomato sauce on the side.   The potatoes were homemade, nicely seasoned and pretty tasty, as well.  The heirloom carrots were a nice addition.  My husband enjoyed his pot roast, as well.  I couldn't resist dessert, everything on the menu looked SO good.  I opted for the bread pudding which was made using nearby Presti's donuts.....yum!   I ordered coffee to accompany dessert and we left full and happy.   I also would be remiss if I didn't mention that service here was outstanding from the valet service, our host and our server Michael.   We will definitely return!!!!"}
{"text":"In regards to the Bistro:

Portions were small but the dining area is very nice (i really like the enclosed porch) and the food quality is high. They had a really good selection of beers which makes me think this place lights up at night. We hit it during lunch and both had a good time. 

Off street parking is always nice, esp in little Italy and they really went out of their way to give a quality product and experience.

The hotel looks really nice too."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. There were 4 of us in our party and everyone raved about there food. We will be back."}
{"text":"Went here as part of a medium sized group for a friend's birthday party. This place has a great location, and is readily accessible in Little Italy. Also the valet parking is much appreciated especially since parking can be difficult to find in this neighborhood around dinner time.  First of all I have to say that I love the ambiance of this place, which is slightly upscale, yet retains a very cozy feel. I have to agree with the other reviews that talk about this being a good spot for a romantic date night. Our group received great service, and frankly I would try any of the dishes that I saw ordered. I had the duck pot pie which was surprisingly light, yet delicious. 
My only real reservation about this place was that I was a little surprised and a bit disappointed with the construction of the meal. I was hoping for something richer with the pot pie, and a more traditional pie crust rather than a puff pastry."}
{"text":"Great!! Menu not as exotic as Barichelli inn. Great service. Decor big improvement.  Rooms fabulous. Go for it!!"}
{"text":"last week i came here with my girl friend for their wednesday night special. i'm glad i paid a visit. in general, i don't really understand fancy american restaurants in general and tend to avoid them. i think they're silly and overpriced. but since this place is just down the street from the hospital where we work, we decided to pop in after work.
my friend, thinking ahead, had brought a change of clothes. she looked so nice in her fancy dress and heels. me, on the other hand, walked right in with my scrubs on. that's right, no shame here. i was tired, hungry, and wanted that bottle of wine.
we had the merlot and pierogies to start. the pierogies weren't really pierogies. they were more like ravioli. really good butternut squash ravioli. the filling was really filling. i think i'd go for a salad next time tho to lighten things up because our main dishes were pretty heavy. we shared the veggie risotto and the mac and cheese. both very delicious. creamy and delicious, as expected. the risotto actually had a lot of vegetables, almost fooled me into thinking i was eating something healthy. the mac and cheese we got without the chorizo because i'm vegetarian and my friend doesn't like chorizo anyway, so it did taste like it was kind of missing something. but it was still good anyway.
the best part tho, which we paid extra for of course, in addition to the 2 for 40 thing, was the bread pudding. with vanilla ice cream. oh it was heavenly. even at the end of the meal when we were both pretty full, it was still delicious. that's a good indicator.
the bill came out to a little more than i normally like to pay for a meal but less than if we had just gone on any other day.
anyway, so i'm not sure that i'd be back during regular nights,, but i'll surely be back on wednesdays again and to try the brunch which i've heard is yummy as well. the place itself is really cute, with different rooms which creates sort of a cozy feeling."}
{"text":"Been here, done this and will be here and do it again and again !

Kristin is a breath of fresh air server. She attended to every need and has a charming personality as well. 

We came for Happy Hour and got happy of several items. The sweet potato butternut squash pureed soup was hot and creamy.

The poached pear salad is a perfect portion,  and we split it for our daily veggie take. 

The pierogies were crispy on outside and creamy on the inside, tossed with pickled onions and diced apples, topped with fresh sour cream.

Everything was simply delicious!"}
{"text":"My trip to Washington Place was bitter-sweet.  I was happy to try the new place, but it made me miss the Baricelli Inn, which was a classic in my book.  Overall the Washington Place produced really great food in a really great setting.  I still can't get over the feeling that they might have missed when they decided to go with modern American fare, but like I said, they do it well.

I started with the Roasted Cauliflower Bisque which was amazingly tasty. There were a few bleu cheese crumbles across the top which infused it with flavor.

Next, I tried the Oxtail Pierogies which were also very good.  The pierogies didn't actually have the oxtail in them. The pierogi was normalish and the sauce and oxtail on top provided all the flavor.  There was just enough horseradish on the plate to give it a kick.

For my entree, I decided to try the veal meatloaf.  Great tasting meatloaf on a bed of mashed potatoes with carrots on the side.  The sauce was a tomato base and not overwhelming on the plate.  Another course very well done. 

Finally, I had a really great glazed donut bread pudding.  I probably don't need to tell you how good that was.

What does that mean for the place overall?

That means the food is great, the decor was redone nicely, the service was nearly impeccable and friendly.  So, what's wrong with the place?

Nothing really. I just somehow still left feeling strange about it.  It occurred to me a day later.  Why would I go to Little Italy to eat Modern American food?

Then again, I was a pretty big Baricelli fan, so maybe I am jaded."}
{"text":"I love Happy Hour at this place - it's the best in Little Italy! Even though the burgers are $6 instead of the previous $5, they're still more than worth it. I also love the three-dip special they have going on right now.

Minus one star for serving condiments in plastic containers, or, if you ask for ceramic, they bring you a mug of ketchup and stick a plastic spoon in it (we don't bother with the ketchup because we love the malt sauce but the table next to us did). Adding plastic is not only bad for the environment but super tacky."}
{"text":"I admit, the food was very good. There was a loud table near us, but that's not the restaurant's fault. However, my primary complaint is with regard to the price. The prices were not ridiculous, and based on the atmosphere, which is very nice and high-end looking, I thought the prices might be reasonable. The problem is that, based on the prices, they would have to either 1) have amazingly good food, or 2) have bigger portions.

Again, the food was good, but the servings are quite small, so you have to be content going home to have dinner #2 or you have to get additional courses, which makes it even more expensive. Great place, just not sure the pricing is quite reasonable.

Haven't stayed there, but the inn looks beautiful, and the service and atmosphere were quite nice."}
{"text":"Dine 2/9/13 with TravelZoo deal. Included house wine which was a $4 bottle of Vista Point Merlot.  Server (Alex) did not provide any of the specials or details of any of the dishes since this was our first visit.  Portions were very small (5 pcs of shrimp with shrimp & grits) 1 pc of veal short rib. Was supposed to be $73 value but I would say the cost of the deal ($39) was even stretching it."}
{"text":"This is an excellent place for date/dinner in the Little Italy neighborhood. It's situated off Cornell and Murray Hill road with free valet parking (please do tip them). It's my favorite place to eat in Little Italy.
 
I'm usually here Wednesday evenings for their 2 for $40 special. This special includes an appetizer, two entrees and a bottle of wine. I would say this is the best deal in the neighborhood, not only in value but in taste and quality. 

The appetizers are usually chef's choice of flat bread, soup of the day or salads. I usually op for their soup, but that's sometimes a hit or miss depending on what they have that day. 

The main entrees which you can choose includes grilled salmon, shrimp & grits, pot roast, mac and cheese and a few others. So far, I've had the salmon, shrimp & grits, pot roast and the mack and cheese with this special. I have to say I'm blown away with the quality of the food for the money. The salmon comes out crispy on the outside, but cooked perfectly on the inside. Their pot roast is flavorful and the meat is tender. The mac and cheese is excellent when you want some comfort food. Although I still think Presti's seafood mac and cheese is the best. Speaking of Presti's, the restaurant serves bread from Presti's (as do many of the restaurants in Little Italy), and its pretty good. Their dinner portions are generous as well. 

The bottle of wine you get is basically a bonus, don't expect a bottle of Dom Perignon though. It's your typical $6-8 wine you find at markets, but they are not too bad. You get a choice of whites such as chardonnay or pinot grigio and reds such as merlot or cabernet. Oh if you get too tipsy after the bottle of wine, you can book one of the rooms upstairs ;)

TIP: If the weather is permitting, take the patio option. The patio is quite nice and well maintained."}
{"text":"I'm a fancy-schmancy New Yorker (by way of San Francisco) so I can be a leee-tle bit snobby when it comes to food.  I just moved to Cleveland and I had been on the phone with NYC friends bemoaning, \"oh my goodness, I'm going to STARVE here.\"  Well, I'm happy to report that I won't be starving with Washington Bistro being walking distance to my house. 

I love the original decor of the place.  Unlike many good restaurants where you still feel like a pig at the trough with dozens of other pigs, just shoving food through your snout, the separate rooms of the restaurant allows for a more intimate and elegant dining experience.  Elegance aside, I love the crunchy-granola soul of the place.  The food is locally sourced and the lamb I ate was grass-fed.  And it tasted accordingly.  it was scrumptious.  And then there was dessert...om nom nom nom!

In brief, take it from this former New Yorker, Washington Bistro puts a lot of NYC restaurants to shame.  Cleveland does indeed rock!

Psst!  I also hear they have this Wednesday night thing where you get good food for two and a bottle of wine for...wait for it, $40.  Guys, here is a date that won't break the bank but still have the lady thinking you're a classy guy.  Ooooh, yeah."}
{"text":"Went in for my pre-graduation dinner. Service was wonderful, as well as the food. Had the restaurant burger which was slightly cooked more done than I preferred, but the flavors were there. My sister had the lobster risotto and it was really delicious."}
{"text":"Made a trip to Little Italy on a whim to try this place out, and I'm super glad we did. The old Baricelli Inn has been completely remodeled, and the surroundings are beautiful. The drink/wine list is great...and the food was delicious.

We started with the oxtail pierogi. I have to be honest, I would never have ordered something with the word \"oxtail\" in it, but I'm so very glad we tried them. The horseradish creme fraiche added a wonderful little something to the oxtail and mushroom ragout. 

Next up was a seasonal offering - a twist on a caprese salad with local heirloom tomatoes and a white balsamic vinagrette. The server had the kitchen split it on two plates after we were discussing sharing it...a good move as it would have been quite large on its own. It drew some attention as several incoming diners stopped at our table to comment on how lovely the salad looked, and I must say that I could have eaten three more plates of it! :)

For an entree, I chose the pot roast and my partner in crime picked the strip steak. Both were perfectly cooked...the strip was seasoned just right and the pot roast was fall-apart tender. We were both very happy with our selections.

While the glazed donut bread pudding (made with donuts from the local Presti's bakery) sounded so amazing - and has had rave reviews - we opted to skip dessert and stop by Presti's for a cannoli instead. 

I'm kind of sad that I don't live closer, or this would become a regular spot for me...but we definitely plan to go there again!"}
{"text":"Even lunch? Yes, Washington Place is even delicious for a perfect, romantic lunch. 

And let me tell you, more people need to go on romantic lunch dates. After today, I think I might make my beau take me out for these more often. It's a great, easier solution to the romantic meal out and it's something different, fun... and a hella-lot cheaper!

Anyways, back to the utter gloriousness that is Washington Place. First of all, I love the views from the back dinning room. It's a beautiful mixture of urban and gardens--and so romantic! Secondly, the service is always, *always* impeccable and today was no exception.

Lastly, and most importantly, the food. (Queue drool rag...) I cannot, and I repeat, cannot avoid getting the pot roast. Good god, man--I don't know what they do to make this so damn delicious, but please don't stop. A big piece of tender beef placed on a mound of fluffy, fantastic mashed potatoes with root veggies. Yes, yes and more yes. And what about those oxtails pierogies? I want these every day, all day. 

The man loved his \"Kinda Buttermilk Fried Chicken\" (read: his plate was left clean) and the ending to our meal was perfection. Yes, fresh strawberry sorbet with fresh berries. I'd like to know where they found ripe berries in the middle of winter, but they were awesome. 

Seriously, you cannot go wrong whether you come here for lunch, dinner --or hell, even if you stay overnight at the inn. They have amazing chefs, staff and it shows. If you haven't visited yet, make it on your top 5 in CLE to try, ASAP!!

Oh, and again, how can you beat free valet?! Answer: you can't."}
{"text":"This place has been on my list for quite some time. They advertise a very worth- while happy hour that simply could not be passed up.

We showed up on a Friday night around 6:30 (happy hour goes until 7pm). It was jam packed because the bar space is very small and offers limited seating. We weren't waiting too long when the host offered us a cozy space with a couch and chairs on the opposite end of the bar. However, a lonely frat boy was occupying one end of the couch and waiting for his friends to arrive. 

There was confusion on our drink order - because the host took it initially, but the bartender asked for it again when he greeted the crowd of college kids that had arrived.

This place was frat-central and every kid looked like he or she was studying pre-law. The frat-crew in our section had risen to nine. They were stuffy, pretentious, and seemed completely out of sorts. God for bid half of them had to stand while they waited for a table to open that might grant them all enough room to sit.

We waited an obscene amount of time for that drink order - which was only two glasses of wine. (Wine, that just needs poured. You know, from a bottle to a glass? No shaking/stirring required here, folks.) 

However, negatives aside - my boyfriend really enjoyed his burger. (Every Friday evening is burger night and that's for the entire evening, not just happy hour.) I mean, he enjoyed it so much that despite the wait and the confusion he said he'd absolutely come back. 

And so, I'm going to give this experience three stars because I'd like to come back. Then, I'd like to upgrade this review and say that going earlier improved our overall experience. I'm hopeful that we can grab some seats at the bar and get ideal service. 

Stay tuned..."}
{"text":"I haven't actually eaten here, so my review is slightly skewed. I am reviewing this place solely on their bar. We came in late one night (after dinner elsewhere) to have some drinks. We were the only ones there (2 of us) and we did not realize they closed at 11. Around 11:45 or so, we asked when they closed and were informed of this. Both myself and my friend I was with have worked in restaurants and in catering, so you can imagine our horror when we were told they had been closed for a while. If the staff were upset, not a single one showed it. They just said, \"we have to be here anyway to clean and pick up! You might as well stay!\" 

 I am very impressed with how every one of the staff members conducted themselves. I've since been back (earlier in the night) a few times. One of these days I will try brunch and update this review."}
{"text":"Such good food. Was taken here by the sister in law, who's a regular. It was late, so no trouble getting a table, although it took a sec to get service. Good selection of wines by the glass and some interesting sounding cocktails. Holy moly is the food good. We split salmon pate on crostini, mussels served the traditional French style, sea scallops, fried calamari, and shrimp and grits. I left full and very happy."}
{"text":"Hostess was pretty rude. He acted as if he owned the place... arrogant to say the least. The burger was pretty good. The bread they use its amazing. The fries and aioli sauce compliment it really well."}
{"text":"WP contributes to Cleveland's growing reputation as a great food town, first by focusing on locally sourced ingredients, and second by cooking great cuisine with them. 

This is a charming restaurant attached to an inn and bar in Little Italy, so points for the location and decor. 

The menu features locally produced and sourced pastas, veggies, cheeses, and the like. I had a wonderful pasta with oxtail ragu, mushrooms, and vegetables. Delicious although a little too salty. 

My sister had scallops and risotto. The mollusks were cooked perfectly, seared on each side. 

Even the dessert was locally fresh; we had a bread pudding made with a Presti's donut. 

Our server was extremely kind and jovial and made us all feel right at home. He knew the menu and the story of the food like the back of his hand."}

Their fries are so good and burgers are also tasty compared to how much you pay for the whole package."}
{"text":"I feel like we got cheated somehow. I've been reading such great reviews of this place and been waiting to come here forever, but it was a real let down.  Don't get me wrong, the place is beautiful and I just love the fact that you are in small dining rooms of the inn. Its cozy and sweet. The food really fell short though.

We started with the poached pear salad, which could have been great but was SO SALTY. I literally could not choke down more than a bite or two.  I thought maybe some rookie in the kitchen accidentally dropped the entire sea salt shake on our salad before bringing it out, but the BF didn't mind it, so I guess maybe its more of a preference thing than a real mess up. I honestly found it completely inedible though. 
For entrees, we ordered the Mack and cheese and the Veal Shortribs.  Both were pretty plain and I am sure I have made similar things at home.

Nothing on their menu screams creativity, they are all solid classics, which is not a bad thing but then I do expect them to be done really well.  It just wasn't the case though, and so if I come back in the future it will likely only be for their $40 date deal (which sounds great btw) or happy hour."}
{"text":"Had about an hour to kill while I waited on the lady so I decided to pop up Yelp as usual and locate a good grub spot that also had a bar and bam found Washington Place Bistro.

I drove by and it looked cool and had a sweet feel to the outside with lighting and free valet parking so that worked out perfectly. Walked in and pulled up a seat at the bar, the bartender was real cool, and told him I'm not from around here and he took care of me with a menu and what I should get. Also told him about Gluten Allergies and he was well compsoed in his knowledge of the menu so I chose the chicken with risotto which was amazing, tasty, rich, and the chicken was moist and perfect compliments to the risotto. 

For drinks I first got the whiskey flight which showcased different whiskeys and it came with a dish of 4 different compliments to each whiskey which was pretty elite if you ask me. They were mouth wash strong but tasty, had to switch it up so I got a Moscow mule which was perfectly balanced and had great ginger beer. Great service, great food, I'd come back for the chicken dish alone."}
{"text":"This is an interesting place, on the fringes of the CWRU campus and little Italy.  It has an inn that has won awards.  We did not stay overnight, but came here for dinner.  The ambiance is cozy and somewhat romantic.  The service has always been friendly.  The menu has a nice selection of items, nothing very esoteric or unusual.  There is a nice wine list and drink menu - warm cider with rum on a cold evening does hit the spot.  The best part of dining here is execution - the food is served warm, cooked to perfection.  Leave room for dessert.  They have a very nice selection of season sweet items.  I highly recommend this place for its consistently good food and service."}
{"text":"We liked everything about this place, EXCEPT of the FOOD which was at best mediocre in some of the dishes (Pirogies, Ahi tuna stack, Vegetarian Wellington) and at worst inedible in others (Chicken dish). The highlights of the evening were Yummy cocktails and sangria and very cozy ambiance."}
{"text":"I went to Washington Place Bistro and Inn with my Mom, Aunt, and Cousin on a Thursday night.  We made reservations.  When we arrived we waiting at the hostess stand for a bit before we were greeted.  We were given the choice of inside or outside.  We picked inside.  This place has nice decor and I love how it has an open kitchen.  All the food was amazing including the bread and roasted garlic butter.  My only complaint is the service.  Our server was not very attentive.  The guy who refilled our water and took our dishes was way more friendly and attentive.  We all got a starter, two of us got the corn bisque and two of us got a salad.  Then we split an entree 2 ways.  We got the hanger steak and the mac and cheese.  We also had bread with our meal, a herbed bread and a baguette which were served with a roasted garlic.  Both the restaurant and bathroom was very clean.  Definitely will revisit again!"}
{"text":"I've never given 5 stars to anywhere but I think this really deserves it. We went for the 2 for $40 and it was all that. The ambiance is sophisticated but casual at the same time. The service is excellent, knowledgeable, and friendly, and the food is excellent, using first class ingredients, skillful preparation, resulting in a delicious meal. Go here, you will not regret it."}
{"text":"I adore this place.  Ive been here several times and never had a bad meal.  Wednesdays they have a special with a bottle of wine 2 entrees and appetizer for 40$.  The food and service quality as well as the atmosphere is excellent. Brunch is wonderful here also.  They had these incredible sweet rolls on Sunday mornings.  I could dine here happily every week."}
{"text":"Washington Place is another one of those gems in Little Italy.  I loved the full dinner here almost as much as I enjoyed getting cocktails at the bar.  The bar is well lit, lovely, and the drinks are sublime.  Really sublime.  After sampling 2 manhattans we decided to go for Makers Mark on the smoky ice cube.  THAT was a delicious concoction and one that I would enjoy immensely at any time of night-or day for that matter.  Definitely come by and if you're like me-dine at the bar!"}
{"text":"A great place for a Friday night meal. Happy hour is till seven and it has a great beer special that is four dollars!! I got the five dollar burger which includes garlic fries that are amazing. I would recommend this place only downfall is to get these bar specials you need to sit in bar seating which can be crowded, first come first serve !!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere and service are 5 star worthy and the food is only shy because I desired a touch more seasoning on more than one dish. We had the calamari, cheese slate, bbq pork shank, shrimp and grits, and meatloaf. We sampled the desserts: donut bread pudding, creme brulee and ice cream sundae. You can never go wrong with Mitchell's ice cream on the menu! The pork was melt in your mouth tender, presentation on all the plates was great, and portions were more than plenty.  The menu highlights local ingredients and companies even the tea! There were five of us tonight but it is definately good for an intimate meal out. Call ahead and reserve a table on the cornell road side! Will be adding Washington to my go to places!"}
{"text":"What an amazing place.   This was one of my favorite meals I've had in Cleveland in a really reallly long time.  Everything, from the ambiance to the wine, was perfect.  My dining companion and I arrived without a reservation on a Saturday night and were seated right away.  The  place was so unique and beautiful that I immediately wanted to make a reservation to stay the night.  Room after room with lit tables, each one spaced just enough so you're not crowded.  There was enough of a crowd so it wasn't awkwardly empty, but not enough so that you felt rushed.  
I had a glass of malbec that was smooth and just right (seeing as most of my wine is bought from walmart it doesn't really take much to top it)  
We shared the pork belly and saurkraut.  While the saurkraut was a bit too acidic, it was still amazing but the pork belly was the best I've had from any restaurant.   It was tender but still crispy and had tons of flavor.  I had the duck which was cooked perfectly but my friend had the scallops which were my favorite of the night.  They were huge, sauteed so that they were crisp outside, but tender inside and full of flavor.  I like how they don't cake on the sauces so you can taste everything that you're eating.  Also, the price point was spot on for what you're getting.  I cannot wait to come back."}
{"text":"I would rather eat at Applebee's than ever go back to this restaurant again. The service was lackluster, and the food quality was far from what I was expecting. 

Upon entering, the bar area is cool with onyx bar. There are several other smaller rooms for the dining areas. We got shafted the enclosed porch. The seating was cramped, the lighting didn't set the right atmosphere, and there was no ambient music in the background. 

The menu looks mouthwatering, but that's about where it ends. I salivated over the menu that was posted online all day and couldn't decide what I wanted because it all looked so good. In the end though, it doesn't matter what you order because it's all very poor quality. It's a shame all their premium ingredients are wasted in subpar meals. The ox tail pierogis were dry with bad presentation, the mac & cheese noodles had the texture of play-doh, the salmon was well done and not medium rare as we were told it would be (though it did have a nice crust), and the     vegetables that accompanied the salmon had raw potatoes in them!

The manager did replace the mac & cheese dish, but the replacement was just as bad and inedible. He gave the impression that somehow there was nothing wrong with their mac & cheese recipe and that somehow we were the ones in error. They were kind enough to take it off the bill (after initially having the nerve to present us a bill not only before out meal was complete - how trashy - but also still with this dish on it!).

Needless to say, this is the worst \"nice\" restaurant that I've ever eaten at in Cleveland (or all of Ohio for that matter). I'm sure a chef put a lot of effort into the development of the dishes, but unfortunately it's the execution of the meals and the experience the Washington Place failed at accomplishing."}
{"text":"Pretty good but not great. The food was well prepared and for the most part quite good. The lovely Mrs truly enjoyed her salmon. I liked the beef cheek pierogis and the meatloaf. Two things that should be addressed foodwise: 1) the fries were flat out mushy, never a good thing, and 2) if you show a menu item as a beet and goat cheese salad you should be able to find some goat cheese in it. We were told that it was mixed in the dressing. Seriously? One other negative: our server either was very new, very untrained or just poor. She knew very little about the dishes and didn't really seem to care much one way or the other. However, all in all it was good and we would return."}
{"text":"What's it's like: Gourmet food for reasonable prices, including awesome happy hour specials! Great atmosphere with lots of natural light. There was a nice after-work crowd there for a Wednesday. Friendly staff. Private parking lot (parking near little Italy can be a challenge sometimes) 

Food & Happy Hour deals: Don't miss the 2 for $40 deal on Wednesday's that includes a bottle of wine, appetizer, & two entrees. We had the yummy cheese plate, delicious burger ($13.50) and from the specials menu the BBQ pork flatbread ($6) & chorizo fries ($6) which did not disappoint!"}
{"text":"After another Wednesday night, 2 for $40 deal, I still only have amazing things to say about this place. The location is prime and they offer free valet - have you ever heard of that?!

The food NEVER disappoints. This time is was a mushroom cream soup and a short rib entree with whipped potatoes and carrots. I don't think I can find the words to describe the succulence of that meal! 

The staff is always super friendly. Our waiter was so funny and knowledgable. It has a cozy, old home aesthetic since it is also an inn. We'll definitely be coming back on Wednesdays in the future!"}
{"text":"This place was ok.  Some good/some it so good.  I might go back to try their happy hour as everyone raves about that.  

We made reservations on a Friday evening. Not sure if we needed too, but just to make sure.  When we got there, u Pretty much HAVE to valet.  Unless u get lucky and find a spot on the street.  The 2 hosts were very pleasant.  They took us to a room with our table waiting.  From where we walked in a. I could see was a couple of tables right in the beginning.   Then there were enough table/chairs to seat about 12-15 people in the room we were in.  But I didn't get to see how big/or small this place really is, it's an old building and all the rooms were separated.  Our group of 5 sat and ate by ourselves for the 1st hour until two more couples were sat in our room.   

The servers were nice.  And they keep your water filled and keep asking if u want more bread.   Which, btw, was very good.   

We shared 2apps at our table as we only wanted a couple bites of something w/o filling up.  We got the calamari which was ok and the pierogi(you get 2) which were phenomenal!!!!!

I had the braised pot roast, and after trying a little of everyone else's dish at our table, this was by far the best.  It was very good and I did enjoy it.   The Mac and cheese was ok. The airline chicken was a little bland, the burger was just a burger and my husbands steak, which he ordered medium rare was well done.  This was the one time the server sort of failed us, because she did not check back for awhile.  We tried to get her attention a couple times, but she was busy with the other couples in the room.  We were on a strict time schedule and had enough time to eat before our other appointment.  So by the time she knew about the steak, my husband had to just return it and could not wait for them to make another.   So he ended up not eating except for a couple bites of the apps we shared and some bread.   All the manager did was take ONE of his drinks off!  I thought that was a little light on her part considering he was leaving w/o eating a dinner because of their faults!   

Like I said, I may b back to try happy hour..."}
{"text":"I went to Washington Place for Sunday brunch and really enjoyed it! A bit too pricey for the simple meal I ordered, but food was certainly high quality. The brunch comes with monkey bread and I really enjoyed that complimentary treat! For my entree, I ordered the vegetable omelet. The omelet included asparagus, leeks, roasted red peppers, and feta cheese. The vegetables were seasoned really well and the leeks added a surprising crunch to the dish! I enjoyed the choice of vegetables very much. I love feta cheese, but I don't think feta cheese is the right cheese for an omelet because it does not melt very much. So, the omelet was a tad dry. The potato hash was amazing, though, and the potatoes were pefectly crispy. I absolutely loved that addition to my dish. Overall, the food was quite good! I do wish there were most options for vegetarians though, because that would have made the price of my meal more worth it."}
{"text":"I have only gone there for Happy Hour at the bar, never eaten in the actual restaurant part.  Location is easy to get to with free valet parking which is definitely a bonus in the Little Italy area of the city.  Bartenders range from mediocre to great, depending on who just happens to be there.  I've had experiences where the drink I ordered on the menu is definitely not the drink I'm handed, but I've also had very very tasty sangrias and drinks.  Their burgers are delicious and if you catch it on burger night when it's $5 is a great deal.  It's not worth the $13 they usually charge on the other nights of the week.  Their fries are delicious and the little creamy dipping sauce they serve with them is very tasty.  Most of the food is pretty good and I've rarely been disappointed.  The only items that did disappoint me were the desserts.  Very uninspired, not well prepared, and at times seemed to be a reach at being \"foodie\" with poor results."}
{"text":"Washington Place is just down the street form Case Western, so it's convenient for students/professors/hospital employees to walk over and grab a bite to eat. I came here for the first time with a friend for \"happy hour.\" I've heard great things about the food here, so I thought they would have some good plates to choose from for a quick bite and drink. Honestly, I was pretty disappointed. There were barely a handful of options to choose from, and the portions were extremely small. I understand that happy hours normally have smaller plates, but this was pretty sad. From the few options they had (which included popcorn?) we ordered the meatballs and fries with aioli sauce. Apparently the happy hour used to be better at Washington Place, so I guess they have downsized? I don't think I would go back for happy hour here sadly, unless of course they made drastic changes. I might think about coming back to try their dinner menu, but for my first visit I must honestly say I was not impressed. Let's hope you grow on me Washington Place!"}
{"text":"I've been here for Thursday happy hour ($6 burger and fries with the purchase of a full-priced drink), Sunday brunch, and their $40 for 2 Wednesday deal. Really great value for their specials. Their burgers are juicy and well-cooked, with a nice toasted bun and crispy fries. Shrimp and grits and their pot roast mash for Sunday brunch is very tasty (and a little on the heavier side). Complimentary monkey bread, which was also sweet, warm, gooey, and delicious. The $40 for 2 Wednesday deal is an unbeatable value. Two entrees (from a limited menu), one appetizer, AND a bottle of wine. Awesome date night idea, especially outside on the patio during the summer. 

My only minor complaint is their limited menu. What they do, they do well, but it would be nice to change it up once in a while. Also a smaller venue, which is quieter and intimate, but less able to accommodate larger parties at certain times."}
{"text":"Washington Place is hidden in the corner of Murray Hill and Cornell, but it won't be hidden again after you try it. Outstanding service, delicious food, great wine selection. It's great in every season, but particularly charming when weather gets better, with the nice tables outside. One of the best places around town."}
{"text":"Amazing meal.  Great building.  Wine list is great.  Food was impeccable.  Beautiful property and very clean.  Would come back anytime, possibly even stay in a guest room!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has easily become a wonderful go to for absolute quality, a rare find in the Cleveland area.

Brunch is an absolute delight (Saturdays & Sundays 10am-2pm). No wait on a Saturday morning, accompanied by a quieter and homey atmosphere.

Complimentary monkey bread is served as a starter for your meal. We had the Maine lobster & manchego omelette and lemon mascarpone pancakes. 
-- MAIN LOBSTER & MANCHEGO OMELETTE: The attention to detail with the omelette is notable; there is well prepared garnish, the eggs were well prepared and not too greasy, and the filling was well seasoned. Manchego served as a great complement, and something quite unique to more normal omelette offerings. The potatoes were prepped with just the right amount of crisp around all edges- not too under nor overcooked. Ingredients were all notably fresh and stood out well individually.
-- LEMON MASCARPONE PANCAKES: These came with a sweet sausage which was well prepared- not overcooked, and packed with flavor. Pancakes were slightly soggy at the bottom as the pancakes by nature are infused with lemon, making the texture difficult to get right. They are not the typical fluffy pancakes with a rise that folks may be used to, but crispier in flavor and thinner. Despite the soggy bottom, the flavor overall, and top of the pancake was well prepared- notably one of the top pancakes we've had in Cleveland, and certainly better than other places that offer the infused lemon mascarpone. A worthwhile try for those seeking something different.

I've also had the WP Burger for dinner here one other time. Similar level of quality and preparation. Absolutely wonderful flavors in their fries, which were well fried with a thin and crisp texture.

Service my first visit for dinner was great with an attentive waiter. My waitress for my second visit during brunch had opportunities for improvement; she was not as thorough with explaining available offerings and our coffee cups were small and often empty, though my +1 and I do tend to be aggressive coffee drinkers. 

Beyond the service in the restaurant, I was visiting a friend from out of town who was staying at the inn, and their service offerings, even when we were just in the lounge, was nothing short of remarkable. They will offer serving additional drinks for you while you are even in the lounge area, something I have not seen at other locations before.

Some of their dishes are on the pricier end, but the quality and atmosphere is well worth the price. It is apparent that there is attentiveness to the dishes, from their ingredients, to their careful preparation. There are unique flavors in every bite, that will please those seeking a quality meal.

I haven't been yet when the restaurant has a wait, which is a surprise given the quality of their dishes. There also is a bonus of a back parking lot (with complimentary valet during dinner for patrons).

All around, such aspects make the restaurant a win for those seeking convenience and a memorable dining experience. We will be back!"}
{"text":"What a great restaurant!

I stopped in on their inaugural vegan night and had an excellent meal.  (every Thursday there is a vegan menu in addition to the regular menu)  

I started off with a Moscow mule, my drink of choice these days.  And hot damn, the bartenders at Washington Place make a great mule.  (perhaps one of the best in town?)

My server was very attentive but not in an overbearing way.  He wasn't familiar with all of the components of the vegan dishes available, but he was willing to ask the chef about them for me without batting an eye.  He also cautioned me that some of the complimentary bread wasn't vegan and brought olive oil in addition to butter.  That was a nice touch, I thought.

I started off with a creamy onion soup.  It was really good.  It's rare to find vegetarian soup in restaurants let alone vegan soup, and this soup, despite not having real cream in it, was creamy and delicious.  For my meal, I had a tomato cous cous dish with the most amazing morsels of tofu.  I know how hard it can be to cook tofu, but it was absolutely perfect in this dish.

I was too stuffed for dessert, but there were sweet treats from Vegan Sweet Tooth in Eton available.  

I'd definitely go back for vegan night at Washington Place Bistro.  The menu changes weekly, and I'm sure there are amazing options each time."}
{"text":"Awesome brunch! Steak Benny is the bomb."}
{"text":"aye carumba! this place is crazy good! i went for lunch, and the prices are really reasonable, for a super high quality delicious meal. i got the salmon blt, which was perfectly made! i ate it openfaced, the salmon was perfectly cooked, and had delicious crispy bacon, lettuce, and tomato. divine! and the french fries were sooo good, and they give you enough to share. the space is lovely, and i like how its sort of split up into different rooms, which really cuts back on the sound level.  i can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Okay.  So I was there on July 1st for Breakfast. We ordered several items so don't judge me. We were given monkey bread to start.  I didn't love the bread but the sauce was amazing.  So lets continue. 1. The Lobster Bisque has nice large pieces of lobster swimming in a pink sea of cream topped with shaved scallions.  It was soooo good. 2. The pear salad.  This dish is leaving the menu to make room for seasonal tomato salad so get this while you can.  The combination of toasted salted walnuts, bleu cheese, radicchio, golden raisins and of course the poached pears were indescribable.  Devine. 3. Lemon Mascarpone pancakes with Blueberry compote. COME ON.  So light and fluffy and fabulous. 4. Shrimp and Grits with Beer Blanc sauce.  I swear I think my heart stopped when these arrived to greet my taste buds.  The grits were so creamy and cheesy with a little bite left to them topped with that amazing sauce with small grape tomatoes scattered about.  Three LARGE shrimp perfectly cooked.  This was my favorite thing I ate all weekend in Cleveland.  So after all this we kept talking about it the rest of the day.  Went to see U2.  Woke up and decided we couldn't leave without a revisit. 1. Eggs Benedict Oscar with asparagus.  This was wonderful, but its hard to beat the Shrimp and grits so I can't even put it close to the running of Best.  2. The Bananas Foster French toast.  I can say this without a doubt was the most gorgeous and spectacular sweetness on a plate.  I wanted to tell every table to order it. The caramel sauce was so fabulous. 3. The potatoes with Malt Vinegar aoli.  Why did I not think of this recipe myself.  I could go on and on, but you will have to wait until I return to hear me roar once again."}
{"text":"meh. merely an okay restaurant. this is my second time. i came for brunch with a friend and they quickly seated us at the very back of the restaurant which had beautiful glass windows where you could see beautiful trees that surround the place and separates the restaurant from the more 'ghetto' scenery of little italy. so that was nice. the server was very kind and honest, telling us what she would and wouldnt recommend.  they served us free monkey bread and though the caramel sauce was good(not too sweet but also warmed up), the bread was kinda hard.  we got the pot roast with the meat in medium rare and the hash and eggs. the portions were a bit smaller, but i would understand if the quality of the food was very good.  however it filled us up because of all the sauce that they drenched the eggs and hash in...first off let me say that ive never had such mediocre tasting hash at a fancy restaurant.  they were soggy and i kinda wish i would just spent like 1/16th of the price eating potatoes from like kfc or something.  also, the meat was definitely not the medium rare that im usually served(and i order steak a LOT and ALWAYS in medium rare); it was leaning more towards rare. also it just wasnt as tender as the steaks im used to. all in all i dont think i will be coming back."}
{"text":"A great place for brunch, especially if you're trying to impress out-of-town family and friends! Simple, well-prepared brunch menu and a relaxed, yet refined dining experience. A little on the pricier side, but worth it if you're okay with spending a couple dollars more for good service and tasty food. I'm definitely coming back to try the dinner and happy hour menu.

Patio seating is worth it on a sunny day! If you're seated at the round table in the back corner of the patio, the service seems a bit slow. The upside is added privacy/intimacy, which is perfect for when grandma makes that racist joke you want no one to hear.

Heads Up: 
Lot parking is valet only and street parking is difficult to find on weekends and during the day."}
{"text":"I've been to Washington Place for brunch a few times and the food as always been okay especially for the price that you are paying. However, they do serve unlimited monkey bread for brunch which is a huge plus! However, happy hour at Washington Place are the best! They have tacos on Thursdays and burgers on Fridays! I would definitely suggest to come early because tables fill up with college kids very quickly!"}
{"text":"Never again. Our group of twelve was sorely disappointed by frozen potatoes, overcooked eggs and chicken, hollandaise that tasted like bottled gravy(bottled gravy might be better)---have I made my point? I am responsible for scheduling this for my cousins, and expect to be relieved of brunch scheduling duty. The respected Baricelli Inn deserves better than this failing destination."}
{"text":"I've been to Washington Place several times for their 2 for $40 deal on Wednesdays, and I've always had an enjoyable experience! This deal is honestly a really great value - you get an appetizer, 2 entrees, and a bottle of wine for $20 per person. Their food is always beautifully plated, flavorful, and satisfying! For entrees, I've tried their steak and seafood risotto, both dishes which I would recommend! The servers I've encountered have also been friendly and attentive. 

Overall, the upscale environment at Washington Place makes it a great place for a date, girls' night out, or just for a nice meal. I've also been here for brunch and had an equally pleasant experience. I would like to come back for happy hour sometime!"}
{"text":"My best advice for this place: get the cheese slate! The cheeses were fabulous, but the real stand-out was the house-made strawberry jam. I am still thinking about that jam...I wish they sold jars of it!
I had an orange-arugula salad that was fresh and came with a great dressing.
My fiance tried the seared scallops which were cooked perfectly.
The only downside was the glazed doughnut bread pudding. I might be picky here, but there was nothing about that bread pudding that called to mind the words glazed or doughnut. Just bread...and pudding.
All in all we had a great time. We walked here from Glidden House. The atmosphere was classy and the service was prompt, I would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I first came with a group of friends under the impression that if you wear your scrubs, you can receive an insanely large burger and fries for $6 when you order a drink. Well please do NOT wear filthy scrubs here (that's just disgusting), you will get that deal on Thursday evening wearing anything you want (even scrubs I suppose lol). Whether or not the scrubs wearing deal actually existed, I have no idea, but it doesn't matter. The Thursday special is out of this world! My entire group ordered the burgers and they were mind-numbingly delicious. I had mine done medium rare and it came out heavy, juicy, and sizzling :) The two sauces that come on the side are so tangy and flavorful, I savored huge dollops of the stuff on my fingers (meanwhile ignoring looks of disgust from my dining partners...they were just jealous they had too much shame to do the same). 

The brunch here is equally delicious. Please order the pot roast hash, you will NOT be disappointed. Think large portion size, scrumptious chunks of meat, and beautiful challah bread. Mazeltov to myself for sharing that meal!! The waitress also suggested a cinnamon roll like desert dripping with sweet saucy goodness...it was heavenly (I think I had a heart attack, died, and went to heaven during that meal)! Please go there now!"}
{"text":"Pricey but classy with some delicious brunch options.  Hope to return for happy hour."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is more austere than when it was Baricelli but very nice. The food was good, dessert menu lacking. The experience overall was a good one and I would recommend!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday for their special... Which is a great deal!...2 entrees, app and bottle of wine for $40. The food was delicious...we split the lamb and the salmon--both very well cooked. The wine was standard (but worth the price). 
When the season allows the patio is adorable. Great date night! 
If you come for the Weds deal make sure to make a reservation!"}
{"text":"What a delightful and delicious restaurant. It is located in Little Italy, and has a chic entrance with a spacious and modern foyer. The restaurant has a modern but classic vibe, and the hostess and waitress were funny, prompt and gracious. The restaurant is high-quality, and good for special events. 

We had delightful prosecco to start and shared what is their take on the caprese salad - - the hot house tomato salad: fresh tomatoes, a generous slice of hard cheese, drizzled with olive oil. They also served fresh bread and delicious garlic butter. Portions were reasonable. 

For dinner I had the pot roast, it was a generous serving of beef. It was melt in your mouth with delicious sauce and mashed potatoes. The malbec was the red wine I chose to accompany my meal, and was a generous pour. I've never had a more delicious pot roast. Well worth the money. 

My dining partner had the scallops, which the hostess told us was her favorite meal of the house. They were perfectly seared over risotto, with summer squash. 

We shared the espresso brownie topped with salted caramel ice cream - - it was delicious. I have also heard good things about the doughnut bread pudding - - the table near us had it and raved about it. Overall a spectacular dining experience, delicious food, and will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Amazing property. Was like a trip to Europe. Wonderful getaway a must when in Cleveland!  Lots of awards but the most friendly folks on the planet. Can't wait to go again. Watch for summer bargains in the bar and on the patio!  No disappointments here!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal. Braised pot roast and shrimp and grits were both incredible dishes. I would eat here very often if we lived close.."}
{"text":"Came with a friend for brunch. We got the pot roast hash and steak and eggs. And complimentary monkey bread! The salted caramel sauce for the monkey bread was amazing, the monkey bread itself was a little dense, I was expecting it to be a little fluffier, but I've had monkey bread before maybe once or twice so maybe that's how it's supposed to be. The pot roast hash was slightly on the salty side, but still good. The poached egg and Bearnaise sauce on the pot roast hash was great. I asked for the steak medium rare, and it came out medium rare/rare, which was great because I like it that way. The potato hash it came with was kind of soft, I was expecting it to be at least a little more crispy. The steak and eggs seemed like not a lot of food, but I guess we were pretty full anyways because of the monkey bread and had leftover. There were only a few other tables, we were seated at the indoor porch area. Service was pretty good, the waitress was very attentive and checked on us/refilled water etc pretty often. 

TLDR: pretty good food, free monkey bread, nice atmosphere, very good service."}
{"text":"I was delighted with my dinner at the Washington Place Bistro & Inn.  I had not been to this location since it was the Baricelli Inn. I was very happy.   Upon arrival the first pleasure was the on site Valet Parking which was free.  So I gave a nice tip.  The entrance is wonderful up a nice set of steps into an entry hall and to a reception desk that feels more like a hotel than a restaurant with an open lobby that flows into the Bar area which also has tables.   My friend had not arrived so I sat at a table and explored the wine list and spoke to one of the very friendly bartenders about the list.  The interior is totally new from what I had remembered of the Baricelli,  The interior is light modern nice colors fresh comfortable yet very elegant.  Both totally casual clothes and dress clothes feel appropriate here.  A table in the garden was open so under the watchful eye of a Saint statute back there dinner was had.  The food was excellent with nice interesting choices.  The service was good.  The prices were fair.  The garden has those nice bare bulbs above for that New York kinda feeling and its really comfortable yet elegant too.  

Really a very nice experience and I would definitely return here. 

As we ate slowly and talked the place was mostly vacant.  The valet had brought the cars around already.  

Just effortless enjoyable dining experience.  So it gets 5 stars."}
{"text":"A few weeks prior to my visit, my sister had booked this place for a small wedding reception of 22 quest & had been calling me all week to fill me in on the details. Just from the conversations we had , I would've taken my business elsewhere! They required her to spend a minimum of $800.00 even though each quest was paying for their own meal. They refused to allow 4 of the guest to order off of their regular menu & required her to pick only 1 entree & 3 main dishes. Most caterers will at least offer you 2 to 3 entrees and 3 to 4 main dishes for the same price! Then when she met their requirements, they still argued with her until she explained that 3 of the guest have food allergies & that I'm ungodly picky. She said they were kind of rude and not very accommodating. 
My fiance & I were first to arrive but they wouldn't let use sit in the reserved room, instead we were shoved up against the wall directly next to the bars entrance. I felt like I was sitting on top of the table behind me. We both ordered the \"dark fig\", it was so strong I didn't get past a second sip & had pushed it far away from me. But the waitress didn't even bother to ask why I wasn't drinking it, she saw it sitting there & just kept going. Now, common sense tells you, if someone leaves a meal untouched or a drink full to the rim that somethings wrong- like its made wrong or its not what they ordered, but again; she never asked. The drinks were way over priced by the way! The selection of wines that you could order by the glass was beyond sparse, seemed like you could only order a bottle that was $25.00 & up.
 
When we were finally seated, there were two separate tables shoved into a tiny back room. If you got stuck sitting up against the wall there was no way out because there was only one opening. So if you had all 8 people sitting in the booth & you needed the bathroom, all 7 would have to get up & walk out into the hallway just to make enough room for you to pass :( Then our server hadn't even been informed about the 4 menus set aside for the 4 allergy crippled guest I had to ask for mine & he was uninformed & caught off guard. But his name was Matt & at the end of the night, proved to not only have a great sense of humor but also seemed to be the only one working. Our waitress, McKenzie (& her \"helper\") were really rude and unaccommodating! They asked everyone to my left if they needed a drink & refills but they never once asked me. So I was stuck with water all night because every time I tried to get their attention they ignored me. In fact, McKenzie disappeared & only Matt & her helper were available, then the helper disappeared & dumped everything on Matt. 
I felt really bad for him, again he was great! But they also screwed up the menu & put vegetable tamales on there instead of crappy a** vegetable risotto for $17.00! Seriously, $17 for rice! I got stuck ordering their cheese slate, which they dont let you pick the cheese you just get stuck with whatever they feel like giving you. So, of course they gave me a mustard cheese that was like eating a bottle of stadium mustard straight up. It was horrible! & they didn't give me enough baguette to enjoy my other cheeses or fruit spread. You got a measly 10 pieces, maybe. I also got their french fries but felt they weren't of any better quality than that of Wendy's. 
The worst part was the wait, it took them a 1/2 after we ate to offer any drinks or desert. Then when they finally did it took another hour just to get our check! Even though our waitress asked if all of us were in pairs & I saw her making who got what for some reason they couldn't figure out whos bill belonged to who. My fiance & I just wanted to get the heck out of there! Its not hard to go around & ask who ordered what & pass them the check . Seriously, an hour! 

I'll admit the place is cute and clean but I'd never return!"}
{"text":"Very nice early dinner with delicious meatballs and steak frites."}
{"text":"Wow, blown away and surprised by this cute inn.

My cool foodie friend mentioned to me that he had read a great review of Washington Place Bistro (which I was like, huh? where's that?) and suggested to try it. As I'm always up for eating, I was eager to try a new place where there was no hype at all....because I had never heard of it.

Located inside Little Italy, I'm so surprised I had never heard of this place before. It's an actual modern day inn- there's rooms off to the right, and when you walk in, you're led to the back, past a kitchen, to a nice, small, cozy spot in the back, with tall windows and a cozy setting. Way cute. Nice place to bring family or a date.

Food was great. For appetizers, we got the roasted cauliflower bisque (bleu cheese with balsamic vinegar laced on top) and the oxtail pierogies. Oh man, the oxtail was so tender and flavorful, and it was really good with the pierogies. The bisque was good- definitely a comfort food. 

For entrees, we got the chicken thigh confit and mack n cheese. The waiter warned us that the chicken thigh confit was a tad salty...and it was, but it wasn't too salty- it came with a bread pudding and some type of kale on top. My friend got the mack n cheese- and it was so good. Had some jalapeno mixed in there, with a pastry something on top of it...but man oh man, that cheese. It was some cheese (I think from McKenzie Creamery?) that locally made, and it was soooooo good. If I wasn't lactose intolerant, I would have ordered one as well. haha.

I couldn't resist for dessert. We were both stuffed...but they had jenni's ice cream on the menu. My co-workers rave about this ice cream...so I just had to try it. We ordered the trio- it came out in small cute little cones, with dark choc, raspberry sorbet...and I forget what type the other one was. Butter pecan, maybe? Nonetheless, it was good. 

Service was great too. Our waiter explained the menu when we first got there, kept everything coming out at a steady pace, and was even concerned about our slow eating. As we were both slow eaters, the waiter kept coming out and asking us if we had wanted our bisque to be re-heated, etcera. Very attentive. Good job.

I'm surprised I haven't heard of this place. If you're looking for a nice place to go to, I highly highly recommend this place. One of my faves of Cleveland."}
{"text":"4 stars for brunch, 3 for happy hour. 3.5 and then bumped it down to 3 since there were so many people from both med schools, that it's hard to get away from medicine for an hour or two!

We came here for brunch the other day. Had a travelzoo coupon that let us have 2 mimosas, 2 entrees, and 1 appetizer for just $29. Great deal. Loved the complimentary monkey bread - tastes almost exactly like the sticky buns at Fire, except this is not $8, but free! Appetizer, we ordered the oxtail perogies that everyone raves about. The meat was tender, but was not too crazy with the load of horseradish that was piled on it. I thought everyone loves the pot roast hash, so both my bf and I ordered the pot roast hash. Was tasty, but could have done with ketchup. We took the leftovers home, microwaved it the next day, and added ketchup - yum. 4 stars for brunch; service was attentive, but not overbearing. A little slow, but hey, we're here for brunch. Did not enjoy hearing two other tables talk about residency applications though, but that's not the restaurant's fault.

Happy hour: was really really hyped up for it, and was sorely disappointed. When they said BOGO small plates, I thought they meant the mussels and other stuff listed under \"Plates\" on their online menu in the Happy Hour tab. Sadly, when we went, small plates = Devil's Eggs + Duck flatbread. Devil's egg dish was 1.5 eggs (3 pieces). Duck flatbread was a small rectangle with 6 pieces. Good, nothing to write home about. The burger deal was amazing though. $5 for burger and fries. Nicely cooked burger, tasty garlic aioli and balsamic mayonnaise. Fries were crispy. Nothing out of the ordinary, just nice and hearty. Did not like their beer special. No choice, just whatever the bartender had - a can of some random brand I've never heard of. 

Overall verdict... bf wants to come here again for the monkey bread. I'll give it one more chance for the 3 for $40 special on Wednesdays."}
{"text":"I went there for happy hour. Supposedly small dish buy one get one free and some wine/beer selection is only 5 or 6 bucks. I sat at the bartender table. He seemed a little confused with our order. We wanted two mussels for just one mussel's price because it's a small dish. He only gave us one mussel. Then we asked for another serving of mussels and our bill was charged for two orders. I thought it was buy one get one free! That was kinda stupid. So make sure you clarify with them before you order.

Food wise, the mussels were good, the burger was Ok. I wanted medium and it was cooked medium, so that was good. No technical error but the flavor was a little on the bland side. The fries were good. Esp. the sauce that it came with.

Overall, not a bad place to go for happy hour, although they don't have much on the menu to select from for happy hour. always make sure you clarify the happy hour pricing, in case your server gets confused and double charge you and you ended paying the same amount for regular dining."}
{"text":"Maybe I can write two reviews to give this place 10 stars?
There is nothing about Washington Place Bistro and Inn that doesn't WOW me.

The atmosphere is bright and inviting, but still romantic, if that makes sense?  It's charming and the patio is so adorable I want to hug it. 

I love to come on Wednesdays when they have their $40 special. Bottle of wine, appetizer to share and two entrees.  I almost always get the Mac and Cheese or Shrimp and Grits because I crave them. Seriously salivate over these dishes.
I have ventured off and tried some other dishes- none of which disappointed.
The wine was excellent, appetizers are always a fun tease of what's to come and you can't beat that special! Their regular prices are on par as well.

The service is shiny and friendly. This is truly an exceptional gem in Cleveland and you are missing out if you don't come in!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't written this review yet!  If I ever hit the lottery, I would make it my mission to own this Inn.  Love the stonework and the patio.

Washington Place is one my favorite places.  On the weekends, their lunch can't be beat.  Day drinking with some delicious brunch.  Yes, please!  I always go for the steak and eggs - hanger steaks with chimichurri sauce, eggs, and breakfast potatoes. 

On Wednesdays, they do a 2 for $40 deal which includes an appetizer, two entrees and a bottle of wine.  This might be one of the best deals in town.  You can make a reservation and enjoy a fancy evening for cheap.  

They also have a fantastic happy hour and bar specials every night. Whether you go for dinner, happy hour or lunch, the service is always perfect. I think they've realized that the valet parking and the look of the restaurant can be a little stuffy, so they do as much as they can to make it inviting and non-pretentious.  I appreciate that."}
{"text":"We are so happy with Washington Place Bistro!  We went there tonight for our 11th anniversary.  (Our 10th was spent at Michaelangelos and it was, by far our worst anniversary dinner ever... I will be reviewing it after this).  We always go somewhere new for our anniversaries and this year we randomly picked Washington Place.  
     This place got such great reviews that we decided to take a chance and made last minute reservations for a Saturday evening.  We were seated immediately, given water within  a minute or so and our server, Alex took our drink order within about 5 minutes.  We ordered the Oxtail Pierogies which were delicious.  My hubby had the \"Mack and cheese\" which he said was the best he had ever had in his life!  I had the Rib Eye steak special and it was the best steak I have had in Cleveland so far.  For dessert we had the bread pudding (made with doughnuts!!!) and it was absolutely amazing!  We also had the espresso brownie topped with caramel ice cream.  Yum Yum!  With dinner I ordered a side of risotto because i was just in the mood.  It was cooked perfectly, but it was flavored with saffron and I don't think I\"m a big fan of saffron, so it wasn't my cup of tea.  
     The service was great.  Alex, our server, was exactly what we want in a server.  He was knowledgeable, respectful, timely and unobtrusive.  He did everything right.  He also answered all of our questions without being condescending.  I hate a server with that kind of attitude!  Everyone who helped us was wonderful...I wish I knew all of their names to give them props!  Anyway, we will definitely be going back and will recommend to all of our friends.  Thanks for a great night!!"}
{"text":"I care a tremendous amount about food and the renewed Cleveland food scene.  But, let me express how bummed I am.  I've been thinking about going to Washington Place since I moved back to Cleveland over a year ago, and I've been genuinely excited about my ordering dinner for over a week.  I'm going to provide a synopsis of my experience below.

I made a reservation for 2 - to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday - earlier in the week.  I talked and debated while consulting with friends and family about what to order when we finally sat down to dinner on Friday.

So, we arrive at Washington Place Bistro and Inn right on time on Friday at 7:58.  Upon exiting my car for the complimentary valet service, I asked the valet attendant how his night was before he could ask me.  He replied, \"Well, I'm here.\"  I should have taken that negative comment as foreshadowing, but I brushed it off and continued to be excited about my food.

The ladies at the front desk appeared happy and genuinely eager to take us to our table.  The table was situated on the glassed in front porch - which was chilly.  With no background music at all, we were in a cold glass box forced to listen to a near screaming party of cliche \"businessmen\" discuss just how awful Obama supporters are and how democrats stole the election - not to mention the strategy of the defeated Republican Party for the next election. 

I absorbed all of this while waiting for our waitress to arrive with water.  I asked about which wine option she might recommend, and upon to receiving one, I said, \"How about the Malbec, \" to which she replied, \"Yea, that's good.\"  Not exactly a resounding review, but fine, nonetheless.  At this point, nothing was going to get me down, even after a rude valet, old screaming republicans, and late-arriving waitress.

We ordered Oxtail Perogies - we had to, they've been raved about - the \"Mack and Cheese\" - also, raved about on national television, and salmon for a lighter dish.

The perogies were our starter - they were the first food disappointment of evening.  Dried out around the edges and covered in fatty oxtail and watery horseradish sauce, we ate them and expressed slight dissatisfaction - perhaps we were just expecting too much.

Our main courses arrived next.  We tasted the salmon first.  We were told the salmon would be prepared medium rare, but instead we got something that was WELL, and I mean WELL DONE.  Still, it's flavors were nuanced and tasty and it's crust was crunchy.  The potato and fennel hash that accompanied it was amateur at best.  Some of the hashbrown-style potatoes were literally COLD and RAW.  At this point, I was in disbelief.

Next - and the real issue of the evening - was the Mack and Cheese.  The dish was cold, as well.  I thought maybe it was the temperature, but it seemed a bit chewy.  As we continued to eat, the noodles seemed chewier and chewier.  A few bites in, the waitress inquired about our meal.  I told her that I had never, ever sent a dish back at a restaurant, but that this dish wasn't eatable.  She took the dish back and the manager came out to apologize, but also explain that if they re-prepared the dish, it wouldn't be any different.

I told him that we were really looking forward to eating this and were sure the first version was just a fluke.  We anxiously awaited the arrival of the re-do.  The next dish had even more play-doughy noodles.  We both couldn't even get the food down our throats.  We're both Italian and have never meet a noodle we didn't like until now.  The conversation we had was mostly trying to reassure ourselves that we weren't crazy- that is to say that our food was really this bad.

Our waitress took this plate away, too and explained it would be removed from our bill.  I then ordered the glazed donut bread pudding, because I had heard so many good things about it.  It arrived quickly, and we ate it.  It was okay, disappointing to go along with the theme of the evening.

Here is the kicker: Our waitress brought me the check BEFORE we were done with our dessert.  Is this Waffle House?  Are you kidding?  At this point I felt like the staff just wanted us to leave, so we devoured the last bit of our pudding and I opened the bill.  To my surprise, the Mack and Cheese was still on the bill.

Our waitress approached us and asked if we were ready to pay.  I explained the error.  She replied \"I assumed it was wrong by the way you looked at me.\"   Again.  Really!?!?

I'm one of the easiest customers a restaurant can ever get.  I usually love whatever food I'm eating, I love talking to restaurant staff, I love celebrating a good meal, and I love to tell my friends about where to eat.  

Everyone should have the opportunity to experience an awesome meal and feel good about spending their hard-earned money.  This is not the place to do it."}
{"text":"I really love this place any day of the week, but Wednesdays are the best deal: $40 gets 2 people an appetizer to share, an entrée each, a dessert to share and a bottle of wine. If you don't like the wine options included in the deal you can take $10 off a bottle of your choice.

While in the past a reservation never seemed necessary here, the place seems to be heating up. It appears we snagged the last two top table at around 6:45p on Wednesday. Make a reservation on the Reso app. 

Our server was really pleasant and attentive. 

For a starter as part of the 2 for $40 deal we got the flatbread of the day. The crust was wonderful - thin, dusted with flour and of the perfect texture and consistency. This particular night then flatbread was topped with chicken pieces and capers. Then off the regular menu we ordered the cheese slate as a second appetizer which went great with the wine. The cheese course was large with Gouda, Moody Blue, St. Angel (my fav), Aged Manchego and Gruyere cheese. A wonderful fig jam came with the slate and went perfectly with the St. Angel. There was also baguette and Marcona almonds.

For dinner I got the salmon. It was perfectly cooked on top of orzo and served with a mix of fennel, bok choy and asparagus.

For dessert the Glazed Donut Bread Pudding is always a good idea. It's served with Mitchell's vanilla bean ice cream."}
{"text":"I've been here for dinner twice.  The first time, we came without reservations and the dining room was packed... so we sat at the bar and ordered off the happy hour menu.  Great price and good food.  The second time we came with reservations and at in the dining room.  I had the burger and it was just ok.  You can also get it for MUCH cheaper on the happy hour menu.  The bf was happy with his food.  But the service was surprisingly better at the bar during happy hour than in the dining room when we paid more than double the price.

Food is 3*, but they're open late, and they don't care that I come after work in hospital scrubs.  I would give 3.5 if I could for the convenience of late hours and free valet in Little Italy, but no halfies on yelp...

-----------------------------------
Explanation of my rating system -
5*: Epitome of something, the best I've had, would LOVE to go back
4*: Great food and happy to go back regularly, but not the best of the category
3*: Food is fine.  I may spontaneously decide to go there based on convenience.  But no need to go back either.
2*: If you insist, I guess I'll come along. I'll find something to eat. But I wouldn't have picked it.
1*: No plans to come back.  I'll try to talk companions out of going. If they insist, I may come and not eat, or may just see them some other time."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere! We ended up coming on a Wednesday which was a great night to be eating at Washington Place. The special was one appetizer, 2 entrees and a bottle of wine for $40. Vegetable flatbread was excellent, loved the shrimp and grits--awesome! The salmon and potatoes and vegetables was simple, fresh and healthy. Our server gave us an unopened bottle of merlot to take with us since we didn't want to drink alcohol. Was hoping we'd get a dessert, but no substitutes. The restaurant was packed for a Wednesday night and we can understand why after having a great meal! Definitely a place to return to time and again!"}
{"text":"How can I give this place anything less than 5 stars? Answer: I can't!
The service, food, quality and ambiance has always been amazing, but when I recently went for my birthday it was just over the top. I literally can't think of anything bad to say.

Aside from gracious and prompt service, the food, whether it's dinner or brunch is amazing. And I have to say, the brunch is very reasonably priced for what you get, especially because they bring you complimentary monkey bread to start... sorry, my eyes were glazing over and I was dreaming for a second just thinking about it's ooey gooey goodness.

Another perk- parking. Little Italy is a mess and I hate going down there because parking is a nightmare. Washington Place has their own lot and they also have complimentary valet. The tip I give the valet man is well worth not having to drive around Mayfield and Murray Hill looking for a spot that isn't just permit parking. 

If you get a chance, go, and if you live a little farther away, it's worth the drive!"}
{"text":"Good food love ....

Like shrimp and Beef

........................

Come back again love"}
{"text":"Consistently excellent. Have been coming here for several years and have always had excellent service and food. The bartenders always make great drinks and you can always rely on the quality of the food. The pot roast, Mac and cheese, and shrimp and grits stand out. They have a great patio in the warmer months and during the winter the inside has a great cozy atmosphere. One of the best!"}
{"text":"5 stars for sure! So good! Beautiful atmosphere! Great food! And not overpriced. We got the beet salad, mussels without the the chorizo, and the shrimp scampi as the dish for me! Would come here again and try other things for sure."}
