{"text":"Love this place, since they opened last week I've been back 2 times!  Loved the Brisket!!  Great selection of wine and cocktails!  Cant wait to go try some of the other options!"}
{"text":"Came by for the first time 
The food was just average BBQ 
I've tried Boobys Q's, Joes BBQ , Famous Dave's are all better in my opinion. Sorry I thought I would be better"}
{"text":"Delicious!!!! Must try the fried green tomatoes and fall apart brisket!  Wonderful atmosphere with whimsy and excellent service! I waddled away with sauce all over my shirt and could have cared less, it was sooooo good!!! Do it!!"}
{"text":"From all the barbecue places I've tried in Phoenix, this is the best so far. The vibe is both upscale and laid back. We started with the grilled cauliflower for the appetizer which was perfectly cooked and delicious. Then we followed with the spinach salad which had the most amazing smoked mushrooms and dressing on it.It is already a favorite of ours. then we ordered the brontosaurus rib. The thing was huge. We shared it and it ended up being the perfect amount of food. It was the best beef short rib we've ever had. Plus the name was pretty hilarious to order. We finished up with the apple pie and it was the perfect end to our meal. It was perfectly balanced and delicious. We will definitely be back to Starlite."}
{"text":"Visited this establishment last night with a friend. The wings are good. The bartender suggested the homemade sauces on the side and I will give him props, that was a great suggestion. 
Staff is super friendly and attentive. And the place offers a cool ambience with great cocktails. I'm excited to go back to this place.

Good luck to you guys!"}
{"text":"Awesome place. The whiskey selection is awesome. Try the beef ribs not fatty at all. The sides are also a little different. Check it"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped in to grab dinner quickly and to say the least I was very pleased. This place is small quaint and has great food. We ordered the smoked bbq pork sandwich and it was amazing with the Mac and cheese and braised greens. The service was great and the bartender was sweet and comped my boyfriends beer because of the crack in the glass. Overall I will be referring friends and coming back to this place very soon!"}
{"text":"Found this on yelp and tried it for Sunday late brunch.  The server was very personable and knowledgeable A+.  The portions are large and the meats have good smoke. A small rustic space with an interesting menu."}
{"text":"The fried mac and cheese is amazing! They have a great drink menu and the waitress had wonderful suggestions. She was also very good and knowledgeable for a place that just opened. The weather is amazing so the outdoor seating made the atmosphere that much better. We wanted to continue drinking, luckily Fry's was right next door so we bought some more alcohol to keep the buzz rollin. My boyfriend had the chicken sandwich which he claimed to be \"money in his mouth.\" Since my bf lives so close, I'll most likely be a regular at this joint. Definitely recommend for anybody wanting a new place for dinner. It's cute, well decorated, borderline romantic."}
{"text":"The best bbq I've had ever! The best eggs Benedict I've had ever! Great atmosphere! Great drinks! And I'm picky!!! Their fried chicken sandwich is out of this  world and I don't do fried! But would order it again! So happy to have a great place that's convenient and close to old town! Don't miss it!!!"}
{"text":"This place reminds me of one of those unique places that people will forever talk about..the dishes they provide, you will never get anywhere else! Yummmm!  The ambience of the place and staff were great. 
Overall, an awesome experience!"}
{"text":"Great place, comfortable lauded back bar. Food is great, the Mac& cheese was great, the complimentary corn bread comes out in a small cast iron skillet topped with a hunk of melting butter, it's lite and delicious  . The fried green tomato sandwich is great. The brisket my friend got was melt in your mouth delicious, so he said. 
We sat at the bar and Chris couldn't have been nicer. The only issue I can see is the place is small. They do have out side area which in summer is tough. But if you go with a large group I would make reservations.  The price point is perfect.  A must go to."}
{"text":"Amazing bbq ribs, cauliflower, brisket, and not to mention good bbq sauces.  Scottsdale needed a good bbq place and finally it's here.  Can't wait to come back and try other things on the menu, brunch looks amaze balls."}
{"text":"We rolled in about 9pm on a recent Saturday night and two huge parties had just cleared out luckily because the place is as small as a postage stamp. The outside (where we sat) is actually bigger than the inside at this new BBQ joint in what was once a sleepy strip mall up the street from my house. So here we go.
Baby Back Ribs - Great ribs, lightly sauced, fall off the bone, good flavor. This costs $18 for 1/2 rack, but no side dish included.

All these other dishes were ordered and people said the meatloaf and fried chicken were good, but the Turkey was a bit weird and actually tasted like ham. The chef also seems to be obsessed with mustard as they serve it on the side and it is also used to rub some meats.

The standout side dish was clearly the mac n cheese which is included with the sandwiches, but not the mains...strange. The cole slaw was not very good with too much vinegar, but the free cornbread was a nice start.
Would definetly return for the ribs, but not so sure this is a destination place, but locals should be happy."}
{"text":"Ribs were tough and average.  Macaroni/cheese and corn bread was great.  Hit chicken sandwich was good and the fried chicken lacked flavor.  
Service was excellent."}
{"text":"Solid place that I would definitely go back to. Overall the food was delicious, and very plentiful. The brisket was probably my favorite of the meats. The ribs were incredibly tender but I feel like the rub could've been a little better to give them some more flavor. For me the highlight was the whisky selection. There was a broad variety of whisky and a lot of good ones, and that's coming from a whisky nerd! The cocktails varied from delicious to pretty good. Service was great, friendly and easily available. I would easily go back sometime."}
{"text":"Great bbq restaurant! We had the cauliflower as our appetizer and the brisket as our entree, both were delicious! We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I got the Hot Fried Chicken Sandwich the first time I went here and I haven't been able to try anything else because it's that good! You get a generous portion of fried chicken with a perfect amount of spice on a charred bun. This is my favorite hot chicken sandwich I've had in the Phoenix area so far! I also got the mac and cheese which was good but I think could have been better if there was something to cut through the richness of the cheese. I put some of the house hot sauce on it and made it a lot better in my opinion. I think adding some sort of spice to the mac and cheese would make it way better than it already is. I also got some fries on the side which are your standard fries and complemented the rest of the meal. I'll definitely be trying some of the bbq and apps next time I'm here!"}
{"text":"Just had brunch there. Awesome food and music. Wings are hot and a nice big piece of brisket. Try the cornbread pancake. We will be back"}
{"text":"Hands down awesome place! Brisket eggs Benedict and BBQ shrimp over cheese grits was perfect. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"There are so many vegan options at this barbecue restaurant! I couldn't believe it. The squash, cauliflower, and house pickled vegetables were some standouts. My most favorite part of the meal was the spinach salad. I loved the sesame oil, and the smoked mushrooms were awesome. All of this was vegan! I couldn't believe that I had so many options at the type of restaurant that usually does not cater to vegetarians or vegans. My friends enjoyed the cornbread a turkey stuffing, along with the brontosaurus rib.

The cocktail menu is very well curated. It stays true to its whiskey bar roots, but adds some really modern elements. The Apple a Day was wonderful, especially if you like ginger!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! I can't believe I have been going to other BBQ places all this time and Starlite has been here in Scottsdale right under my nose! The food is delicious, the service is great, and the drinks are awesome! Do yourself a favor and eat here!!"}
{"text":"Decided to stay clear of the craziness of Oldtown and try out Starlite as a recommendation from a friend. 

We came for brunch and they have your favorites and then some. Of course they have $15 bottomless mimosas (2 hour limit we learned). They also have many popular and local beers and wines. 

The service was great! So attentive and genuinely nice. 

The brunch food was not my favorite however. I ordered the Turkey Benedict and this thing is huge. I recommend splitting it with someone as I only ate half. It comes on thick bread which I think was the issue for me as it made it dry. The turkey and hollandaise sauce had a unique spicy flavor that I didn't mind. My friend ordered the brisket and wasn't completely impressed. 

I'd still like to come back and try lunch or dinner and get a real taste of their bbq."}
{"text":"I ordered a brisket sandwich with a side of fries for delivery. It came 15 minutes earlier than expected! The brisket was tender, but a little on the dry side. Good experience overall so I'll probably try this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Have hit this place up a couple of times. First time we were looking for some good BBQ, but let the staff talk me out of it in order to try the cornbread pancake with fried chicken. It was a good call. That thing was delicious.
Second trip? Had to go back, because I didn't get my BBQ. Ordered the chopped pork sammy and my better half had the hot fried chicken sammy. Wanted to say they were great, but they were just okay. Pork was a little dry and not enough slaw. The hot fried chicken sammy was wasn't hot (spicy), at all.
End on a positive. The mac and cheese is great and the drinks are solid. Staff is, too.
There will be a third trip. Still more temptations on the menu."}
{"text":"SOOOOOO Delicious!!! Chicken Wings are out of this world and the Fried Green Tomato Sandwich is BOMB!! So happy to have a cool hang out spot away from the mishmash of tourists. Service is awesome and the ambience is perfect. A+++!"}
{"text":"A fabulous BBQ right in my hood!  I am in love with their meatloaf sandwich, it is to die for!  I also had the brisket, but found it cut too thick, thinner slices stacked would have been an easier chew.  Nonetheless, it was delicious.  On one hand I love that it is tucked away in a non-descript strip mall, so it is our little secret, but on the other hand I sure want to see this place stay open for a long, long time!"}
{"text":"Gave brunch a try and it doesn't disappoint!!! Another great time at Starlite!"}
{"text":"Good spot. Nothing AMAZING but good flavor. No kids menu, portions are decent size so we just had the girls split an entree and side.
Ordered the Babyback ribs - full rack, MAC & Cheese, fried chicken, greens, street corn & tried the corn bread. Ribs were tender & the spicy sauce was flavorful. Chicken had crispy finish, wasn't a fan of the sauce in between the chicken and breading tho. I prefer to choose my sweetness/spice. Greens were different - they were a bit dry, for my preference. Possibly why they weren't as tender as they could be. Mac & cheese was good - creamy sauce didn't get dry or separate! :) the street corn was served traditional but with a sweet sauce instead of a salty spicy. The corn bread wasn't dry even though it was a little toasty on the outside. ;)
Over all a good spot to eat. Do I think the full rack was worth the $28? No. But, doesn't take away from having at least the half rack next time."}
{"text":"No sauce needed. The hip bar patio has the best BBQ west of KC. Oh yeah, no need for sauce though. Amazing liqour selection and craft beer.
Attentive servers and local feel. Waited 30 years for a spot like this in old town Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Best BBQ place in town, the staff were so friendly and making sure that we like what we already ordered.
Nice place!"}
{"text":"So many cool things about Starlite! The space is super fun and cozy too being that it is a little smaller. The food is AMAZING! I've now tried multiple dishes and each one was top notch! From the ribs, to the spicy hot links, to the mac n cheese... promise you won't be disappointed. The signature cocktails they have are awesome too! All around an awesome place!

Starlite's staff is so nice and friendly too! Bud is by far my favorite bartender!! 

Everyone go check out this place! You really won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"At the time of this review Starlite BBQ just opened a few days ago in downtown Scottsdale. This is a casual BBQ Restaurant from the Good Folks from Ocotillo (a really nice restaurant with a really nice menu). Like the sister restaurant Starlite BBQ also offers a BBQ Menu like no other. They offer many interesting appetizers like at this time like Grilled Squash with Mole, Fried Mac-N-Cheese, Grilled Cauliflower with Green Goddess and Crispy Black Eyed Peas and MORE! They also offer a variety of Sandwiches like Smoked Turkey, A Burger, Smoked Grilled Meatloaf, Fried Chicken (reg or hot) Brisket and Fried Green Tomato. Of course they also offer BBQ Plates, a Crispy Fish for Two and some of these plates are offered in two sizes. Sides as well come in two sizes. 

Atmosphere wise Starlite BBQ is a smaller restaurant. Seating is at the Three Community Tables on the Ocotillo lined patio that seats up to twelve each or at the bar or the High Tops off the side of the bar.

For me it was difficult to decide on my order because there were so many things I wanted to try. So we shared the Smaller Sized Brisket (I was told about 8 oz...it might have been bigger?), The 1/2 Hot Chicken and three full sized sides.

The Brisket WAS OUT OF THIS WORLD DELICIOUS! It was succulent with the perfect amount of fat. It had a thoughtful amount of smoke and was sauced just right. It was simply delicious and they gave us pickled onions that magically lightened up the Brisket and took it to another level. They also gave us this Whole Grain Mustard....I didn't use the mustard on the Brisket but I tasted it and now I'm sorry I didn't scrape it out of the container to bring home.

We also shared the HOT Fried Chicken (with tasty pickles). Yes it was hot(spicy)  with a nice hot CRUST. They gave a Big Breast and the Leg Quarter. It really was mighty delicious but due to an opening hiccup it wasn't served the proper temperature and was almost cold. Our server didn't check on us till we were finished with the (still delicious) chicken but we did inform her and spoke to management who thank us for informing them.

All three sides we tried were VERY GOOD. We tried the (either vegetarian or vegan) BBQ Beans that were nicely seasoned, a little spicy and also a bit sweet. The (vegetarian or vegan) Braised Greens with Tomatoes, The greens had some punch and the tomatoes were flavorful and sweet. The Macaroni and Cheese, like the middle of a American Grilled Cheese Sandwich, made with sturdy noodles and served with a crispy crust.

It's so great to go to a BBQ Place and enjoy things other than meat!

All the people working there were all friendly and welcoming to us.

Very Very Good!

4.5 Stars! Already"}
{"text":"This place was awesome.  We started with the whiskey bar and followed up with the brisket and grilled meatloaf. It was ridiculous! So good. Will be back soon and often!!!!"}
{"text":"Bomb dot com.  Nicki was a pleasant surprise and suggested the Starlite Benedict.    This was amazing.    You can't go wrong at this little sneaky gem!    Love it."}
{"text":"Great food!!! Dining experience was top notch.  Great interaction with bar tender. I had the brisket unbelievable. Mac and cheese, bring it!!!"}
{"text":"Best bbq in Scottsdale! It's salty, not Carolina sweet barbecue if you are from the south and visiting. Their rib meat falls right off the bone, and the brisket is slow cooked and then grilled over mesquite. Highly recommend their cocktails as well! I had the mule on happy hour."}
{"text":"Went back tonight, and tried the Pork Can-Can Steak, and the Turkey Stuffing! The chimichurri sauce, pickled jalapenos, and pickled onions are fantastic accompaniments for this amazing pork dish. I also tried the turkey stuffing side in a cast iron skillet. It was fantastic and it had a great texture. I tried the \"Hodad\" cocktail which rocked. Being a big fan of Bourbon and egg-white frothy cocktails it hit the spot. Cannot wait to go back! The staff is awesome too!"}
{"text":"This has the makings of the neighborhood go-to for good drinks and really solid food.  It's very small inside, but comfortable.  They were overstaffed as they should be while in the early stages and the service was efficient and friendly.  

The ribs were really good.  Great smoke and great seasoning.  The hot chicken needed acid and salt, but was amazingly crunchy and juicy.  Awesome texture and heat.  A hit of salt and some pickles on the sandwich would have taken it to the next level.  The vinegar slaw had no acidic kick and was way too sweet.  It's point is to cut through and balance the fatty meat, and it didn't satisfy.  The tap selection is very slim and beers are overpriced by at least $1.  It's tough to kick back and down a few $8 beers.   A couple small tweaks and this place will be great."}
{"text":"I'm glad that this new place is in my neighborhood.  Everyone has an opinnion on BBQ, especially if you're from Kansas City, Texas or North Carolina.  These guys just do good BBQ so get over it.

Service at the bar was friendly.  I had an IPA from Modern Times and a brisket sandwich with mac and cheese as a side.  The food portions were huge and quite tasty.

My only slight gripe is that they don't have much, if any food on happy hour prices. It would also be nice to have $2 off craft beer during happy our instead of the macro-brewery dominated HH options."}
{"text":"Awesome food and great service! My fiance and I shared a half order of the baby back ribs and the hot chicken sandwich with mac n cheese. More than enough food for two people and every bite was delicious. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is easy and very good portions ! Best BBQ around !!! Great drinks and staff"}
{"text":"Huge portions!  Really nice service.  Free cornbread.  Only rec is to get ad free music.  Mac & cheese was legit."}
{"text":"Delicious chopped pork! Loved that they paired it with pickled onions and whole-seed mustard! Good atmosphere and friendly people!!"}
{"text":"It's a very small place but nice atmosphere. Specialty drinks are good but, not a ton of beer on tap. Service was decent, not great. You gotta get the Mac N Cheese!!"}
{"text":"New neighborhood spot! Stopped in tonight to check it out for the opening. We already ate so we just had drinks. The menu looks fantastic and the cocktails were delicious. I can't wait to try the food this weekend. I'm beyond excited to have a fun place with great food and cocktails within walking distance. I'm sure going to be a regular!"}
{"text":"Super nice staff! Only 7 wks old and it's full. Watching march madness. Free cornbread  

Solid beer section. 

Amazing pulled pork!
We probably ordered too much haha. 

HUGE portions!"}
{"text":"Tonight was my second time here. 

First visit
Service: Nice staff. Very attentive and accommodating.
Food: I ordered the chicken wings. I'm not a fan of breaded chicken wings. I was expecting \"buffalo wings\" when I ordered the Hot Wings, however, the sauce is very different. I did not like the sauce. They brought out a good \"ranch\" style dressing that was good and I ate most of the wings. Final assessment: I won't order them again. The complimentary cornbread is BOMB! 

Second visit was today. There was some sort of party going on so it was very busy. The staff was still great in spite of how busy they were. I ordered beef ribs, fried Mac and cheese, and organic veggies as takeout. The ribs were tender, however, the rub they use is average. They have 3 different barbecue sauces: mustard sauce, spicy sauce, and House bbq sauce. My wife and I tried them all and decided to use the KC Masterpiece we have in fridge. The fried Mac and cheese is pretty damn good; my wife loved it. The organic veggies was interesting. It's basically an assortment of raw veggies with some dips on side for $12. I thought that was little steep for throwing raw veggies in a box. 

I'm a barbecue connoisseur. Starlite appears to be a barbecue venture for a chef as opposed to a pitmaster. The issue is that you don't get great barbecue. You get a chef-inspired barbecue experience. Which can and I'm sure will work great in this location. With that being said, the meat is cooked perfectly and the staff is great. I couldn't really taste any smoke in the ribs. I will try the brisket next and request all meat naked in the future."}
{"text":"very good service but food was under par. split a salad but portion size very small. shared an order of beef ribs which were large but tasteless. strange tasting cole slaw but fries were enjoyable and plentiful. we will not return."}
{"text":"This place gets one star, and that's for the great music. Worst bbq ever. Bland and chewy meat."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Ask for 'Bud'; his crew will go above and beyond to make your visit exceptional."}
{"text":"Finally there is a great place to get BBQ in Scottsdale. 
With all the trendy health food placed opening up, all I asked for was a hearty taste of home and Starlite brought it. 
They have the best staff with neverending smiles and energy. I have come by 3 times in the last week for a different dish and house cocktail and it never ceases to keep me happy and the manager, Brad is always present to make sure things are up to par. 

It really is a great place and if you haven't seen it yet then stop wasting time and check it out!"}
{"text":"Great new bbq spot in Scottsdale... they have great bourbon and whiskey menus.. make sure you try the whistle pig maple syrup cocktail.."}
{"text":"Amazing first time and brunch here!  Nice clean, classy atmosphere with good music and vibes.  The service was incredible, my water glass was always kept full and I never had to go out of my way to ask for anything.  The food is incredible, so many unique options and epic portions - come hungry!  The specialty cocktails are a nice touch.  I had the Pinata Punch which was very festive.  The lotus root really topped it off.  I definitely recommend this place and will be back the next time I pass through Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Okay I'm not kidding when I say huge portions. Dinner was super tasty and the sides were actually good! Most BBQ joints I've tried have mediocre sides but Starlite is the exception. They have a solid drink selection and the service is friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"I felt the Cen Pho a little bit when enjoying the food and drink in the patio on weekend early evening. The side dishes are fabulous. I love the corn bread, fried Mac and cheese, collard greens and tomatoes, and black beans. 

I wish the bbq brisket is more tender and juicier, and the bbq mesquite is cooked a little bit longer. The drinks we ordered were simply normal. 

Although the experience is ok, I am curious to try the other menu, like sandwich and desserts."}
{"text":"Excellent BBQ! There is so much to chose from and everything we saw come out of the kitchen looked incredible. We ordered the grilled cauliflower which was HUGE and amazing. We also ordered the Beef ribs and brisket. Sooo good!!!!"}
{"text":"Starlite BBQ and Whiskey Bar is a mini-restaurant/bar located off of Indiana School in South Scottsdale. The place itself is ran by the same team that's responsible for Ocotillo, a popular modern-American restaurant in Central Phoenix that was actually pretty impressive based on the one experience my girlfriend and I had dining there.

Going into Starlite, I wasn't really sure what to expect. The place is much smaller than I had imagined. If you're sitting indoors, this can either feel cozy or cramped depending on the crowds and where you're sitting. Our table didn't really have enough room to accommodate our food, so I suggest keeping long gaps between your starters and main dishes.

Much like Ocotillo, I can't speak for their craft cocktails, but only their food. For opening weekend, they were providing a complimentary plate of ribs to customers, which we were able to try out. I've never been a big rib person, but quality of the meat was good. They're using a unique sauce which tasted very similar to mole. I strongly dislike mole, while my girlfriend is a fan, but we agreed that it's probably not something we'd order for ourselves. Additionally, a cast iron skillet of cornbread was brought out, which was also complimentary. Although I've always been partial to sweet cornbread, while theirs is more traditional, it was still good. 

We also decided to sample their McLendon's Farm organic vegetable board, which came with some pimento cheese which we both felt kind of neutral about. We probably played things a bit too safe in this regard, as it's really nothing but a bunch of raw vegetables. 

Usually, when eating BBQ, my girlfriend and I prefer pulled pork. They offer chopped pork, which we assumed would be the closest thing. Quality of the meat was fine, but a bit gooier and wetter than we've become accustomed to. Whether that's good or bad is largely chalked up to personal preference. They have three different sauces that you can add. Our sides of fries and mac and cheese served in a cast iron skillet (they like their skillets here) were both done very well.

Our server checked up on us regularly, but for some reason, had the charisma of a wooden log. We decided to make an ultra-rare pass on dessert, as their options of s'mores, apple pie, and banana pudding were probably pretty similar to what we've sampled elsewhere.

Overall, I'm sure this place will do fine. It has a nice vibe and food that's above average in comparison to your usual bar/restaurant hybrid setups. But if you're going here specifically to seek out BBQ and using the other heavy-hitters in Phoenix for comparison, I feel it's a place that will ultimately end up blending in rather than standing out. As another reviewer stated, this is more of a chef-driven BBQ venture as opposed to a pitmaster serving up what most people are used to. And in the end, there's nothing wrong with that, I guess.

Recommended to check out."}
{"text":"The smoked bacon app and cornbread pancake is amazing! The sides were so-so but the service was definitely on point. It is a small place with not much seating, not good for great parties with the hotter weather, but would definitely check out if in the area!"}
{"text":"Stopped in this hideaway (in a shopping center on the NE corner of Miller & E Indian School) after the Scottsdale Public Art bike tour.  We were thirsty with an appetite!  The outdoor patio with picnic tables was just what we were looking for.  There is a nice bar and cozy dining area inside.  We shared the Fried Chicken Sandwich and veggie board along with a couple of brewskis.  Thanks to Bryce for his attentive service and food recommendations.  Everything was yum!"}
{"text":"Just finished a rather disappointing experience after having high hopes for a good meal based on the reviews.

The good, apps.  The cornbread was delicious.  The cauliflower appetizer was mostly good, minus the black eyed peas.  The black eyed peas were listed as fried, but to us they were overcooked, very grainy and chalky.  My big boy old fashioned was decent. Her unicorn tears was ok, light on flavor.

The bad, the main courses.  She ordered a half order of brisket, I ordered a half order of chopped pork and we shared baked beans.  

We're not sure the intent on the brisket, but it seemed to be precooked, sliced into 'steaks' and then grilled.  This resulted in the driest brisket we've ever eaten.  It was near jerky.  But, the pickles were good.

As I recall, the menu didn't include a description of the chopped pork... I probably should've asked for detail.  What came to the table was so over sauced I couldn't taste the pork, and I could not tell you if the meat was smoked or roasted.  There just wasn't any smoke flavor.  There were 3 sauces on the table, but I couldn't try them... the meat was already drowning in a sweet sauce.  Again, I probably should've asked, but I expected a well smoked pork that I could use their sauces on.  Especially since they had a mustard sauce which I really like on smoked pork.

The side order of baked beans... beans were cooked well.  But, there just wasn't any seasoning.  We had a few bites, and it just wasn't worth it.  There was no salt on the table, and by this point we weren't inclined to flag someone down to ask for salt.

We did inform the waiter of our disappointment, who brought the manager out.  We were offered a free dessert, which we declined.  After several disappointing dishes, dessert wouldn't have resolved the preceding experience.

We had hoped for a good bbq meal with some 'elevation' of flavors based on the menu, that's not what we were served.  Here's hoping they can improve, a good nearby bbq meal would be much appreciated."}
{"text":"I normally don't leave negative reviews. But I have to say my experience here was not good.

This place is very claustrophobic - which is more of a personal preference but still, its on the cozy side. The brisket was flavorless, chewy and full of fat. The baked Beans had no flavor and were still raw and undercooked.

The waiter brought cornbread that was overcooked and was very forgetful with our order. The staff was pleasant and happy but the kitchen needs help.

This place seems to be having and identity crisis between being a neighborhood bar and a restaurant. Needless to say I will not be returning and would not recommend to a friend.

Lastly and most importantly, it's overpriced."}
{"text":"BBQ for brunch? YES PLEASE! I was pleasantly surprised by this place. I'm pretty darn picky when it comes to BBQ, but their brunch is KILLER. The hot links are spicy and served with flavorful beans. The cornbread pancakes have a super unique flavor and tastes so delicious with the hot fried chicken. I absolutely loved this place, such great flavors and a lot of kick. I love spicy food."}
{"text":"Great Phx/Scottsdale BBQ spot. I am from Kansas City and highly critical of BBQ around the US. I spent much of my youth making Ribs, Brisket, and Burndt Ends our way. I have to say on my First Trip to Starlite the Brisket was highly impressive. Tender, Smoky and very tasty.  Our Mac & Cheese was also delicious.  Looking forward to trying some more but might end up sticking to the Brisket."}
{"text":"Thank you!  Finally a great local bbq restaurant in a great location. 
The patio is amazing!  There are a bunch of community tables and some small high tops. 
Brice was our server and was a rock star!!  He gave us some amazing food and drink recommendations. 
Couldn't have had a better meal for my first time at Starlite."}
{"text":"Starlite is a small, quaint, rustic environment with a great looking bar.  I would imagine this would be a great place to go for cocktails and hang out, but my boyfriend and I went for our weekly cheat meal.  We eat super healthy six days a week (we're dieting), then on Saturdays we splurge one meal.  So I always research the place in advance to make sure the menu and reviews look good.  Starlight had great reviews, so we decided to try it out.  We were ravenous, so we  finished our meal, because that was the only comfort food we were going to get for another week.  We ordered several items, and shared them all.
We ordered the fried mac and cheese, which was very clearly not made fresh.  It came out in a square-like brick, very dry, and it had what appeared to be freezer burn around the edges.  The flavor in the middle was good though once you got through the dryness.  I should have taken a picture... it was bad.
We also ordered the St Louis Ribs, which had nice flavor, but were EXTREMELY tough.  So tough in fact, we could not separate the ribs by tearing them; we had to use a knife, and we had to saw for about a full minute per rib.  I'm not exaggerating. They were very dry as well, but the bbq sauces were delicious, so that made it edible.
Next, we shared the chopped pork sandwich. Now this one was really good!!  The slaw and pickles were awesome, and it had lots of pork on it.  The french fries were also very good.
Last, I ordered a pineapple cocktail, which was very bitter and expensive.  Our total tab was $85 before tip; the prices definitely do not match the quality of food. 
Service was great though... I wish I could remember our server's name.  He was great!  We did not mention anything to him; we don't like sending food back, (I've been warned against that.. lol) and the server doesn't control the quality of food anyway.   Hopefully management reads this and communicates with the chef/cooks though.  We won't be back, at least not for food."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! My boyfriend and I went here for our first time tonight and everything was amazing. The atmosphere is so pretty and cozy, the waiter was incredibly attentive and helpful, the drinks were yummy, food was so tasty and everything was really fast! Also, the patio is dog friendly so that's a huge plus. This is my new go to place for a nice drink on the weekends, it's not crowded and the drinks are awesome! Definitely will be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! We just stumbled upon it after going to the grocery store quickly and fell in love with the place. The outside is really awesome with the lights and the inside is gorgeous! They have a few beers on tap and they actually comped by beer because there was a crack in the glass. My girlfriend and I ordered a pork sandwich to split and had the mac and cheese and greens. All of this was delicious!! The sandwich and all three of the sauces on the side were amazing and the mac and cheese is phenomenal. Highly recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"Love the hospitality! Love that South Scottsdale gets to have a little more sparkle! The brightest star of all, however, was Bud, warmest bar tender ever! Brad, the GM was very attentive and kind as well. Love that we can finally get an amazing Fried Green Tomato sandwich w/ Pimento Cheese in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch the other day and can i say... Oh my gosh I have met my match!  Meat overload (aka my heaven)!!  We split the brunch brisket which was on top of cheese grits with a fried egg. I was shocked at the amount of brisket we got. The entire dish was so rich and so right and made my soul happy!  The brisket was melt in your mouth juicy and delicious!  The other item was the brisket Benedict on top of homemade biscuit with hollandaise, again delish and HUGE!  I highly recommend you opt to get the Hashbrown cake, you will not regret it!"}
{"text":"This place is terrific.  Not only is the food amazing but the drinks may even be better.  Everyone was super friendly to top it off.  I definitely will go back."}
{"text":"This is delicious BBQ!
I had the brisket sandwich which was extremely tender perfectly smoked and tasty with several in house made sauces and a yummy mustard to try. I chose Mac and cheese with my sandwich... it was served in a cast iron skillet which kept all that pasta and cheese nice and hot through the meal.  It was also delicious.  The restaurant is nice, casual and small with a good vibe. The service was great! Everyone was attentive and really nice. I am already planning my next meal there !"}
{"text":"From what I understand, Starlite is fairly new in town It's hidden in an otherwise nondescript shopping mall that should not be allowed to have barbecue that's as good as it is here. Starlite is definitely a fusion of Texas and Carolina styles with some cool other influences as well.

I stopped in on a Wednesday and ordered the half brisket and sides of braised greens and coleslaw. The brisket is really unique and was super render, having been finished on a grill giving it a unique smokiness you normally don't get. There's a heavy mustard influence in the sauces, and the brisket comes a la carte with a side of whole grain mustard. The mustard is definitely homemade and then almost turns the dish into a deli favorite.

The sides were outstanding, the coleslaw having just the perfect tanginess to offset the meat, and the braised greens were a unique take on the standard collards. 

Bottom line, great service, unique barbecue (Arizona style?), and good.portions make Starlite a great reason to visit the mall."}
{"text":"Amazing chicken wings.
Awesome corn bread. 
Service and atmosphere is comfortable. Bud the bartender took really good care of me. I definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"Loved it!! We had a huge group.  Started outside then decided to take the huge booth inside.  Staff was so accommodating and we had the best waitress, wish I got her name.  The food was fabulous! Will defiantly go again!"}
{"text":"Overrated. Disappointed. Expensive. The brisket had ok flavor and was slightly tender, but DRY. There are 3 BBQ sauces which are decent. House made pickles are surprisingly good. The cheesy grits and rock shrimp are ok, but too sweet after a few bites. The corn bread was dry. Their service was lacking especially at the bar. Good selection of bourbon and liquor."}
{"text":"Exceptionally good food, very good prices and fun atmosphere. 

Tucked away in the corner of shopping plaza. The smell of the food wafting out of the place is amazing. 

I will definitely be back very soon.  

Best fry's, wings, Mac & cheese. 

Brisket & chopped salad - Yum  sorry photos got trashed- trust me good stuff."}
{"text":"My husband and I loved Starlite. The complimentary iron skillet was a great start and the hits continued. We really liked the chopped pork with the mustard seeds and pickled red onions. The St Louis ribs were also really good, they have a peppery rub. We got the roasted acorn squash with mole which was very unique. You definitely need to like smoky mole to appreciate that dish. It's a nice setting, great bar selections and cocktails. I'm excited to go back for both brunch and lunch!"}
{"text":"Maybe we caught it on a really bad day. My friend's brisket was mostly fatty pieces and this was after they had to take the plate back because she ordered chopped and it was brought out as a hunk. The Mac and Cheese was crunchy like it was not cooked properly. This was after the dish was replaced because the first one was rock hard. The hot chicken was bland and the only crowning glory was the cornbread, which was delicious. My friend said this was probably the worst BBQ that she has had here. Definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"Waitress spilled a drink on a member of our party and didn't even attempt to make the situation right. Didn't help clean, didn't offer anything but a half hearted apology. We were forced to debate whether it was intentional or not given the complete lack of care displayed. Needless to say, the rest of the nights service was poor, even after we took the initiative to try and make the situation better by attempting to soothe her unbothered self, It was so odd and uncomfortable that we felt we had to say something just to bring some type of peace and resolution to the situation. 

As for the food, if you're looking for real BBQ, this isn't the place. Uninspired, over cooked, and for the greens served in tomato soup, absolutely unworthy of being on a menu. This was a shocking display of ineptitude for a restaurant with such a high rating. Service mistakes happen, but don't compound it with poor food, and a clear lack of appreciation for customers. This would only fly in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"The food is amazing for brunch especially the cornbread pancake with spicy chicken. I also liked the smoco loco if you haven't tried it it is to die for. Best bbq place in town."}
{"text":"If you are in Scottsdale on business, pleasure or just seeking some really good BBQ look no farther !
The food was amazing as well as drinks, definitely recommend the unicorn tears cocktail. Oh and if you swing by ask for Bryce, he's the man! He was awesome but so was the whole staff. Will be back next time we are in AZ."}
{"text":"This is a great place. Excellent BBQ baby back ribs, cornbread, and baked beans. Bud the bartender knows his bar extremely well and will deliver you a fine concoction, or an ice cold beer in a frosty mug -- And his backup man, Bryant, was great as well. 

Very nice interior build out. I totally was into their music selection -- which played a lot of great stuff at just the right volume so you could still carry on a conversation.

They just opened last week and they don't even have their sign up yet, but you're definitely going to want to check this place out. I'm looking forward to returning soon."}
{"text":"Excellent BBQ, highly recommended, as well as great staff and service. The brisket was well prepared and not dry."}
{"text":"So good! I'll definitely be back. This is the best BBQ anyone could ask for. Great drinks too! I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Awesome bbq!!! Super attentive and friendly service. My husband and I moved here from Chicago, and we have been dying to find the bbq spot that blows us away, and we found it! 

Great whiskey selection. great cocktails.
menu is vast, wings are soooo crispy and every single sauce is tasty.
Some of the best Mac n cheese...no joke. 
bbq chicken  was huge and on point

The main plates are a la carte, I recommend you splurge and get a shareable side...it's worth it! 

For real, get here...this place is a hidden gem and for a small place, we were able to roll right in and sit. It's only been open for four months, I worry that once word gets out and this place blows up, our neighborhood hot spot will be packed all day. We will be back again and again!"}
