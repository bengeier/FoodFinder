{"text":"We just finished our dinner at this place.....extremely disappointed....and this restaurent is a JOKE!!

1.  This place is no longer operate by Japanese chef; this place charge you for the Japanese Chef's price, but serve you poor quality of fishes(much worst than any All You Can Eat in GTA). The chef did not seem welcoming. 
2.  Deluxe sashimi was $18 on the menu, but the server told us that they don't have the regular tuna tonight and only have \"blue fin tuna\"' and need to charge extra $2.5 and I was fine with that... However, when the that dish showed up...the so-call 'deluxe' fish were 3 pieces each of salmon, blue fin tuna ( which I don't think it is and it had the unchewable white skin ), and white fish. Totally ridiculous!! 
3. The WASABI was runny . It is definitely not real wasabi. We asked the server if this is real wasabi she said it is and their wasabi is made differently than other restaurant . Of course theirs is different because the wasabi is from 'ready to eat one' from tube mix with water!!!! Gross!! Can't believe it!
4. I saw 2 table ordering Omakas . I happened to overheard the server once again told them they only have blue fin tuna tonight so will need to charge extra $10 each person (So the course is $68 instead of $58). The worst part is I saw the chef start preparing the course from scoping some per-made minced fish from a plastic container by adding some garnish on top as the first course. Omg, really??"}
{"text":"Yummy sushi, great service, but I don't think it lives up to all the hype! 

Decided to try the place with my husband since we live north of the city after seeing it as one of the top ten places to have sushi in Toronto Life Magazine, but still ended up having to drive another 35 minutes north! It was hidden away in an unsuspecting plaza right off Davis. 

The sushi chef and his family, were good servers, willing to strike up a conversation with their patrons which made service a little slower. It seemed like they had a lot of people who frequented their restaurant, as there probably aren't too many sushi chains in Newmarket! 

We tried the chef recommended bento box. It was filled with sashimi, 6 tuna rolls, fried salmon, some type of smoked fish, and sushi. This box comprised  mostly salmon or tuna. The 3 slices of salmon sashimi and 3 slices of white tuna was fresh and thick cut. Their sushi on the other hand was strange- the wasabi was slathered all over the large ball of rice, and the sushi fell apart before even lifting them away from the box. As someone who frequently eats sushi and travels to and from Japan, the amount of wasabi was just overwhelming.. and I've frequently use freshly grated wasabi - which is much more potent than the powdered mix! 

I just wish they had a greater variety of fish, less wasabi, and things like ice cream to accompany their meals. We just didn't think for $100 meal (tax and tip not yet included), we didn't leave completely satisfied."}
{"text":"Chef has some anger management problem. He came over to take our order instead of the waitress. He took one of our items incorrectly and refused to admit he took the wrong order. At the end, he told me if I don't like it, just leave it on the table and refused to correct the order.  His manner was terrible.  The waitress came by later and apologized."}
{"text":"I have been here many times over the last 6 years. We would mostly order the Omaskase menu which is at $55 per person. I can't recall was it $50 before? Anyhow, it is still an excellent value. The sashimi is always fresh!! Yum!

Chef Jyo always recognize me and my family when I come here! What a special treat!

Too bad it is a bit far drive for me otherwise I'd be visiting more often. =)"}
{"text":"Took me about 30 mins drive from my home to this place in Newmarket last month. This was my 4th time at this Japanese restaurant having my Omakase menu $75. The place provides a cozy environment that is a perfect harmony to enjoy a meal with friends and family. The owner chef always gave me and my friend an unforgettable & amazing dining experience every time. This is one of the best places to celebrate a special occasion. Recommended this place if you want to try Omakase..."}
{"text":"I loved Sushi Ya!
From the outside, you wouldn't think much of the restaurant. Inside it's tiny, but the atmoshere is friendly.
We went for the Omakase after hearing about it through relatives who read about the place in a review. The Omakase meal was all that our relatives had told us; it was a delicious! 
The variety of the different dishes was amazing and presented in really pretty ways. After all the courses we left feeling very full. 
An overall excellent experience!"}
{"text":"If you like real sushi or real Japanese food made by a Japanese chef, go here , enough said, problem with eating here is it will ruin any other sushi you ever eat again, guy brews his own soya sauce , wow!"}
{"text":"I was brought to Solo by a trio of raging foodies who promised my new-to-fish-eating, vegetarian palate a taste of the sublime...on the relatively cheap. $55 for a quality omakaze is a hot price in this city.

Sushi chef Jyo is passionate and ready to explain his wares down to the stream them fish came from, and I appreciate that. Chatting with him feels like an integral part of the experience. Be aware, however, that the man likes to chat...like, a lot. Now, Jyo has an opinion (or two million) so he will openly try to dissuade you from whatever teriyaki business you may be eyeing. But he's right. Say it with me, \"oh-mah-kah-zay\". Six grand courses of cooked and raw dishes catered to your tastes.

The Stand-outs (Japan's food nomenclature is not my strong suit):

Oysters (possibly baked) covered in a kind of chive mayo, and the combo is maddeningly good.. This dish is seems to be a staple.

A communal sashimi plate with a whole fish (gutted, with the flesh raw and cut up) surrounded by sizable fresh cuts of salmon, tuna, shrimp (heads intact), and another two types of fish (possibly mackerel and a second type of tuna). The fish. Oh, sweet lawd, the fish. It set a benchmark for freshness for any sushi place I've been to since.

An ascending tower of sweetish sauce, panko-fried  potato croquette, spicy sauce, scallop, shrimp, shrimp's head, wasabi, and a sprinkling of dried herb flakes. Crunchy, sweet, starchy seafood. Awesome.

And just when I was about to pass out from all the eating, Jyo sends us each a plate of sushi with three pieces of nigiri, two pieces of maki, and an urchin hand roll to seal the deal. The cuts were hefty and fresh though rice tasted a little too sour for my liking.

I don't remember what happened after (the meh) dessert. I think it involved my body being rolled to someone's car.

On subsequent visits, the omakaze line up has been nicely varied. Chawanmushi has been introduced for those who crave it. I've also tried the ramen, which is traditional and good. Do call them at least a day in advance (and ask real nice) if you're looking for some noods--the broth takes hours to make. Solo isn't a fancy-lookin' place. It's tiny, simple, and worth it.  Their quality and craftsmanship are outstanding and deserving of a pilgrimage to the north."}
{"text":"As authentic as it gets for Japanese cuisine.  One of the few Japanese run Japanese restaurants and their attention to detail is obvious.  An extremely far drive to Newmarket, but it's worth it.  My previous experience with Davis drive is fighting traffic tickets at the nearby court.  My feelings of Davis is much better now after eating at Solo.

Had the Omakase which is probably the best way to go here.  It was for a friend's wedding party dinner so I'm not sure on the price (~$50 I believe) and we probably got some items everyday customers don't usually see since we had a large party that was booked in advance.

The starter was fish liver in a light broth that was delicious.  Lost track of all the courses, but the sashimi was really fresh and everything was cooked to perfection.  

The chef is very passionate about his food and he may be too opinionated for some.  But I always enjoy a chef who is overly passionate about his creations.

The place looks like a dump from the outside and I initially missed the restaurant all together.  If you see a plaza that looks abandoned you've found the right place.  That is just the outside.  Once inside, the restaurant is very clean and cozy.

Overall highly recommended.  If it wasn't all the way in Newmarket, I'm sure it would be packed every night."}
{"text":"I have not had sushi this good since I was on a business trip in Japan ion's ago. The sushi is to die for. It is authentic and fresh as it gets. This is a hidden gen in York region. You must all try it. Head Chef Jyo is a class act guy. We always get the Omakase menu definetly amazing!!! 

You must go worth every penny. Their dynamit roll is heaven!"}
{"text":"I think a lot of other review for this restaurant nailed it on the head. I was searching for a good quality sushi spot to try out an omakase menu and my search brought me way up north to New Market. They do have another location in downtown Toronto (ran by Chef Jyo's apprentice) but I read the presentation and sushi doesn't compare to the original location so hence my trip up north.

First off I agree with all other Yelpers, the fish is top notch. I haven't experienced any other fish like it in the GTA. The highlight of our meal was the sashimi platter where I swear the fresh seafood just melts in your mouth. What was a little odd when we had our sashimi was the wasabi, I don't think I ever had fresh wasabi but I think what we had was it as it didn't come in chunks like other places but more like a paste and it was potent. 

The omakase menu allows you to try a wide range of fresh seafood selections, both raw and cooked, and you will be very satisfied and full. 

My only criticism, and it's constructive, is that I only wished the chef or the waitresses spent a little more time with each table explaining what exactly they were eating. I'm not a fish connoisseur so there were times I wasn't sure what kind of fish I was eating. 

All in all it was a fantastic meal, very relaxing atmosphere in this small quaint little sushi shop up north. For all the downtown Toronto Yelpers repeat after me, \"Yes it is worth the drive.\""}
{"text":"Great quality sushi. There are lots more stuffs not found on menu. I recommend the fish liver and seafood motoyaki"}
{"text":"Nothing special, in fact, both my wife and I found the attitude of the owner/chef distasteful.  We wanted to order something on the menu, and he simply would not let us.  So we ordered what he suggested, assorted sashimi.  It was nothing special, many pieces of salmon sashimi, no tuna, no yellowtail ... very disappointing. The price was way overpriced for what we received.  Service wasn't great, food was average, price is way above average. Would not go back."}
{"text":"I love this place. My favourite sushi in Toronto and I drive from North York to come here whenever I can. My family is Japanese and we are very picky!! The soy sauce made in house is sooo good! The rice is perfect and the chef is very picky about the freshness of his fish. 
I would never eat at all you can eat or 95% of the Japanese restaurants in Toronto,  the same as a person from Italy wouldn't eat at East side marios for Italian.  
I recommend the sushi chefs recommended sushi for that day, or omakase dinner is a real delight so you can try everything.  my favourites are the uni,  hamachi Kama which is grilled fish collar, and so much more. I love this restaurant so much!!"}
{"text":"So hard to find a decent Japanese restaurant these days! So glad to stumble into Solo. Really authentic, food is so good! Their custard egg is awesome!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been wanting to visit this intimate restaurant for some time. It is located on the north side of Davis Dr in Newmarket and a little difficult to access. The owners are very nice and described the menu items to us. The sashimi was fresh and tasty. The tempura was hot, crisp and tasty as well. The sea urchin was bitter and they took it back. 
Everything was nice but we were underwhelmed with the overall experience. I realize the area has been under construction for a number of years effecting businesses in the area. We've enjoyed Japanese food in other restaurants that was as good or better."}
{"text":"Calming dining space and authentic vibes from the food, ordered a sushi set which comes readily seasoned with a little wasabi between the rice and the fish. However some of my fish pieces had better cuts than others, which could be a one-time thing."}
{"text":"I just wanted to add my 2¢ about Solo Sushi Ya....as others have already stated, the Sushi is FANTASTIC.  I've been to some of the top sushi restaurants that North America has to offer, and the quality of fish and skill of Chef Jyo ranks up there with all of them.

I'd driven by numerous times (it's a shabby little restaurant in a Newmarket), and the only time I actually tried to go there (on a Tuesday for lunch), it was closed...but I kept hearing great things about it.

Now, if you're looking for $10 all you can eat \"sushi\", there are plenty of other places to go...and you should, because this isn't one of them.  I opted for the $55 Omakase and it didn't disappoint...none of it.  The sashimi was top shelf, and every other dish that arrived was equally stellar (quality, presentation and most important, taste).

I most certainly would've given 5 stars if this restaurant was a nicer decor...but, it is what it is, the best sushi you'll find inland.  

The one thing I can't for the life of me understand is, what in the hell is this restaurant doing in Newmarket?  It must be free rent or something because, for the most part, Newmarket's other sushi restaurants are of the fast and relatively inexpensive nature.

I would most certainly recommend SSY to anyone who knows sushi.

You now officially have ONE reason to go to Newmarket!  ;-)"}
{"text":"I've been to the downtown location and first time trying this location over the weekend. I've never been disappointed!  Came in for an early dinner on the weekend because we had a party of 18.  Told the chef how many people were attending and he took care of the rest.   The food we had was similar to the omakase menu except there was a bowl of ramen at the end.  Everyone already knows how good the sashimi and sushi are, but the ramen was superb! The sound of 18 people slurping noodles was deafening!   The ramen had some bamboo shoots, some pork belly, sprouts, and half an egg.  Not cooked like a hard boiled egg though.  The yolk was kinda like a medium well poached egg consistency. Delicious! The broth was so good I chugged that faster than I could shotgun a beer! I could probably eat it every day and not get sick of it.  That's how good it is!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for a least 2 or 3 yesrs now. I always go for the Chirashi Don. And I feel the quality and the care that goes into their food are much better than other places around the area. 

I feel this place should get more recognition than it should. Perhaps, it is the location as its not as busy as it used to be before all the construction on Davis Dr.

Service is always great and the quality of the ingredients are much better than other places

However, they only open a few days out of the week so check the hours before you go."}
{"text":"This restaurant is my absolute favourite in the GTA. Please don't be mislead by the bad reviews on this site, as everyone is entitled to their own preferences. If you are not accustomed to how a traditional japanese sushi bar is run, you may not understand how things are run in this small family owned restaurant. 

Sushi chefs tend to have a stern look because they are not chefs, they are artists, and take their crafts very seriously. Many sushi chefs dedicate their whole lives to the art of making the perfect sushi rice, let alone the proper cut of fish. Jyo Gao is the main sushi chef, and he has one apprentice. Due to having two restaurants, Jyo is only at the Newmarket location on Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. The apprentice works on all other open days. I often go Fridays and can be dissapointed when Jyo is not there, as he is a great character to talk to. All employees highly respect Jyo and will not make executive decisions without himself or his wife present. This is why you may see a difference in service when he is not there.

Jyo always remembers everyone who goes to his restaurant, and enjoys conversation with customers, sharing his unique outlook on life. He is very fair and honest, which people may misunderstand as rudeness.

The quality of the sushi rice and fish are superb, and have a \"melt in your mouth\" quality exactly like those in Japan. I went to the famous tuna market in Tsukiji, and I didnt really notice a huge difference between the quality and price, maybe my expectations were too high."}
{"text":"A 45min-1hr drive depending on where you are, this little Japanese restaurant is tucked in an area not known for Japanese cuisine. I went here because of raving reviews from Joanne Kate's Top 100 in the City where this one is ranked 18, which is the highest among Japanese restaurants she's ranked. 

Well, what can I say... the entire experience was a let down. The food was unremarkable. Fish selection was horrible especially for Omakase. It seems like their best fish here is Salmon. Staff doesn't introduce the course - we had to ask what the items were. Chef Jyo Gao was at the restaurant but he wasn't even the one who did our Omakase (sushi, sashimi). He was inside the kitchen most of the time. And he wasn't even friendly to us as he should be from what I've read - didn't speak to us but spoke to other tables.

Omakase Dinner:
1. Trio appetizer of sweet squash, pickled veggie and tuna tartare -  I didn't even know this was a course already so I didn't take a picture. Portions were like side dishes that comes in any Korean Restaurant. The sweet squash was surprisingly good esp for someone who doesn't like veggies. It doesn't taste like squash at all. The tuna tartar was great - fresh and tasty.

2. Chef's Choice Sashimi - This is where the disappointment starts. I love sashimi and it's my basis for good Japanese places. The plate comes with big pieces of salmon (2), hamachi (2), tuna (2), scallop (1) and ebi (1). The scallop and ebi were great - big and fresh. The hamachi didn't have taste. Salmon and tuna were good. But seriously, Salmon and Tuna are Chef's choices?! It's bad enough that there were only 5 types here, but why were half of them basic fish selection. Oh well, maybe sushi will be better.

3. Chawanmushi - custard soup with seaweed, salmon and shrimp. For someone who's not into chawanmushi, this was very good. But sadly, there was a piece of shrimp skin on mine that they didn't peel or remove properly.

4. Miso Mackerel - this was the best for me in the dinner. Fresh and not fishy Mackerel cooked perfectly. The miso sauce was good although very sweet. 

5. Chef's Choice Sushi - This sealed my disappointment for the night. 4 pieces of Nigiri: Salmon, Tuna, Hamachi and Scallop. I heard that sizing of sushi is important. I'm used to bite -sized sushi that fits perfectly when you put it in your mouth. These ones were very big pieces that you either had to bite twice or stuff in your mouth uncomfortably. My hamachi had bone in it. What's going on here! And, Seriously?! These are the exact same selection we had in sashimi! Apparently, Salmon and Tuna are the best they got to offer. I feel sad, ripped off even. What kind of Jap restaurant offers mostly basic fish selection for Omakase. My favorite for Jap in Toronto are Japango and Zen. At Japango, although their sushi and sashimi moriawase had basic fish selection, it was not the majority and it has seasonal and high end selections.  I've been spoiled by Zen Japanese restaurant where an omakase will never have salmon or basic tuna in them. Zen always gives seasonal or higher end selections like aji, otoro, uni, amberjack.

6. Coffee Pudding - this was the cherry on top of the disappointment. Very unremarkable dessert. It didn't even taste like real coffee - more like coffee flavouring. It's like dessert you'd expect at buffets.


Verdict: Not worth the trip nor price. How this got into Joanne Kate's Top 100 (and highest ranked Jap too), I'll never know. Maybe she gets the Critic's Omakase special."}
{"text":"Newmarket/Aurora doesn't have a wealth of good-quality restaurants (and I'm not trying to be a Toronto-centric snob here). I'd rather eat a paper plate than eat at Boston Pizza so I scoured the internet looking for a good asian restaurant. I came across Solo Sushi Ya and saw that it received a lot of praise.
This restaurant looks deceiving from the outside. It's tucked away in a white, dirty-looking building. Inside though, it's a comfortable, quaint restaurant.
There was a large number of us so when it came to ordering, we went through the same conversation three times. \"No, you can't have that. That's for kids only. The kitchen's too busy\" referring to the tempura udon (even though the menu didn't state that it was for \"kids only\" and when the kids in our group ordered it, we saw that it was large enough for an adult). My dad tried to order a couple of things but got shut down. After the meal, we read about how the chef likes to do the ordering for you but it's unreasonable for a restaurant to be so snotty. I also saw his comment in the Toronto Star about how \"donburi is for field workers\". That's pretty rude and insulting to farmers.
Despite this poor approach to servicing, we all (except for one of us) enjoyed the meal. We had this delicious daikon and shiitake little appetizer (not sure what the name of it was but came free with our meals). I had the age-dashi which had a wonderful broth and tasty crispy outer layer. The miso soup was your standard miso soup. 
The vegetarian option for sushi isn't the greatest (as I'm now aware the chef probably thinks people like me who don't eat fish are scum of the earth). My vegetarian sushi consisted of the standard cucumber, avocado roll and a few inari sushi. They all tasted excellent so I was content with having the basics. I stole a noodle from the kids' udon and it was so damn good!
I would definitely come back here (though probably not with a certain member of my family who was disgruntled with the service)! Maybe next time, I can dress up like a 7 year old and try to sneak in an order of that delicious tempura udon."}
{"text":"I arrived at a half-full Solo Sushi Ya on a Sunday evening. I ordered the Omakasi menu at $58 / person. The low rating is for the poor service and dirty restaurant. I would rate the food at 3 stars.

We were seated in the corner by the back wall. The tablecloth was filthy (covered in stains) and the wall was even dirtier (food all over it). The table was set and ready but there were still pieces of old food remaining on the table. Poor first impression.

We sat there for at least fifteen minutes before anyone would come by and offer tea and take our order. The restaurant was only half full so I was baffled by this. I considered walking out. First impression is getting worse!

The pacing of the courses were all over the place. First few rushed out and then waited more than 30 minutes in some cases. Very frustrating considering it wasn't busy.  The meal took 2 hours and 45 minutes - just crazy considering the few courses served.

Nobody explained what was in each course, it was just dropped on the table - a poorly executed Omakasi.

A run down on the food:

- Three appetizers, 1) red beans, 2) veggies & fish skin and 3) spicy sashimi. Nothing special and not very creative - average at best.

- Sashimi was fresh in most cases except the BC white tuna. Really tasted fishy. Even with 90% of the fish very good, it only takes one miss to turn you off.

- Egg with salmon and various pieces of seafood and tofu. I didn't like this but I don't like egg so will not pass judgment on this dish.

- Salmon stew was OK but a little fatty for my personal taste.

- Sushi plate only had four pieces. Fish was good but the rice was a mess. Every single piece fell apart when you picked it up. 

- Dessert was good - a coffee flavoured gelatine.

After experiencing a perfect Omakasi experience at Sushi Kaji last week, this is a complete fail... even at half the price.       

Maybe this was a bad night as so much went wrong. For $60 / person, the service should be good, the restaurant clean and food fresh. I cant say any of these applied to my experience tonight.

{"text":"Quiet relaxed welcoming place with excellent food and service. Don't be discouraged by the unprepossessing exterior. These folk know how to provide a very pleasurable dining experience. The bento box is a great choice with fabulous tempura and very tasty sushi. We also love the noodles in soup."}
{"text":"Throw everything you know about restaurants out the window, this place breaks every rule and is the best sushi restaurant I've ever eaten at. This place is very small, unassuming, and barely noticeable if you drive by. But that's why I love it. Chef Jyo is an artist, and his works are the best sushi I've ever had. That is not an easy thing to say. Who would know? This place is top notch, their amazing wasabi is house made, their salad dressing is like no other, and their fish, don't get me started on it. Solo's fish is what sushi should be. The right consistency, not to warm, not to cold, it's the best in Ontario, maybe even Canada. You might shrug at the price of the Omakase, but trust me, you will love it. I agree, it is up there, but you are getting food worth twice that amount. If you don't get omakase, you will still be in heaven. I recommend the Tatoyaki, possibly my favorite food in the world. Tatoyaki is octopus fritters in a beautiful combination of sauces and mayo. Don't miss out on it! If you don't get omakase, I recommend the sashimi deluxe or Sushi university. The University has my fave hand roll, which has a tiny kick at the end. If getting sashimi deluxe, get the one with sweet shrimp, it is AMAZING! The bento boxes have an excellent seaweed salad, and also offer tempura and sushi. On top of the godlike food, Solo's service is awesome. They always greet us with a smile on their faces, and offer great suggestions based on dietary restrictions. Chef Jyo and his wife create IMO, the most authentic, tastiest, and most beautiful sushi in Ontario. Thanks for the excellent food chef!

{"text":"Probably to this day the 2nd best sushi I've had in Canada. Omakase was great, 9 courses and just a fun atmosphere. Recommended. Also price was great at only $55."}
{"text":"The never ending quest to find the best sushi in the GTA brings me to this out of the way spot time and time again.  I usually depend on a ride from my drooling omakase-crazed friend for a ride to Newmarket but this never takes longer than a few seconds of suggestion to get him to comply.  Yes, to quote the cliche - It's worth the drive to Newmarket!  
Solo Sushi Ya is in a nondescript little building way the heck out in middle of nowhere and is owned and operated by a mild 'sushi-nazi'.  Legend has it that he has chided many a folk when they unwittingly order mundane concoctions like \"sushi-pizza\" and other 'fast foody sushi\" at his establishment declaring it an insult to his fine skills.   
Master Jyo is not far off base with his chiding, I tell ya!  Once you have eaten here, you will almost never eat at another one of those mass 'sushi' houses or gasp, 'all you can eat sushi buffet' places ever again.  
At a not unreasonable $55 for omakase, every dish of prepared food and sashimi as well as sushi is expertly prepared.  It's impossible to find a weak spot here.  All the prepared food is gorgeously presented, changes often with the seasons and super tasty.   Likewise, the sashimi and sushi plates are supremely fresh and expertly cut like how the gods intended and far from hacked off pieces of raw fish that you might get at lesser establishments.  You learn quickly that sashimi is NOT merely cut up pieces of raw fish and there is a great deal of care and thought put into the selection and cut of the sashimi.
On our most recent visit, the main prepared dish found a steaming put of 'gen kani' (a bizarre hairy crab) soup/stew loaded with fresh veggies simmering in a sweet briny broth (not sweet like sugar but sweet like flavourful).  Wonderful!!  Eating the hairy crab was an usual experience but more than worth the effort for the sweet delicate flesh.
I cant say enough about Solo Sushi Ya, each visit is a whole new amazing experience and probably some of the best Japanese cuisine one can sample without flying all the way to Tokyo."}
{"text":"Small little restaurant that seats about 35 people. The owner is the chef and he has a sushi chef and a server. 

We weren't  really sure how busy it gets on a Saturday night .....glad we made a reservation. We arrived at six and all the other tables filled up shortly after we got there.  

We had heard so many good reviews about the Gyosa so we had to try them.....we ordered three orders and the plate arrived and maybe there was 10 dumplings on the plate seems like a lot for $30?

We ordered two chicken bento boxes, one salmon bento box. My dining companions said the chicken was really good as well as the salmon - some of the other items in the box there they didn't really care for. 

We had an order of shrimp and vegetable tempura, a dragon roll,  salmon sashimi and a tempura roll.  

The food was okay nothing outstanding, I don't think I'll be returning

I will make a comment with regards to the restaurant itself; I as a diner have an expectation for a restaurant to meet some basic dinning standards, if the restaurant is worn and dirty I think it is the owners responsibility to upkeep the restaurant -  if they can't afford to do so........ 

The menus when we received them were hardcover menus falling apart inside and really had seen better days. The draft of the window was so bad that my father was freezing at one end and at the other end of the table and was a space heater on the floor beside me and I was melting .......obviously they could not get the heat at their end of the table.   All of the light fixtures or paper fixtures were falling apart and the restaurant has seen better days from an aesthetic perspective."}
{"text":"We ordered the omakase and it's very overpriced for what you get. They lack variety in sashimi and craftmanship is avg at best. Friendly staff and good selection of sake though."}
{"text":"I wouldn't necessarily classify myself as a Sushi expert but I've hand my share. I've also had my fair share of food coupled with either great or horrible service. Frankly, this place is just spectacular, the service was amazing and the food was the cherry on top. I met the owners who more than most, take pride in their cuisine and making sure that the culinary experience is just that, an experience. And so it was. This is gem in Newmarket, one that needs to be exposed to the world. Put down that hamburger, just drive by that Shoeless Joe's, and yes try-it. You wont regret it."}
{"text":"I could tell from the plates going out to the other tables that the food is not like 90% of other Japanese restaurants.  Artistically arranged, enticing to see, they hint of wonderful things to come.  Not my plate.  

I ordered Sushi University, expecting to be schooled, but the lesson was lost. As a standard sushi combo, it was fine.  All of the cuts were good, except for the rather chewy clam.  For $18, it is not an unreasonable meal, but for that price, I expect the nori on the hand roll to be crisp, rather than soggy.  The Miso soup and salad were good.

For a business punished behind the construction fencing on Davis Drive, this small restaurant  was reasonably full.  I suspect many of the patrons had ordered the Omikase meal at $58, which is obviously the showcase dish(es) that I wish I had ordered.  Although the interior is worn, it has a homey feel, and with $220 Saki on the worn menus, the chef is not afraid to push the envelope.

The Sushi University was a C-.  I have had sushi combo's at restaurants all over the world, and many were better.  But the Omikase looked downright good!  I could have watched the other diners eat all night, but that would be creepy. Right?  I will try Solo Sushi Ya one more time, for the Omikase.  If my palate is not as impressed as my eyes were, I'll give it a failing grade."}
{"text":"I'm not entirely sure why the rate is so high. The place itself is cute and cozy, the service is attentive and overall good. The appetizers were tasty. Unfortunately, the sushi itself was pretty bad. The fish was fresh, I'll give them that, but no variation of it was presented in sushi sets, and the lack of skill was quite appalling: the rice parts were enormous both is nigiri and rolls and thus falling apart, the fish slices were sloppy and tiny, the rice itself was seasoned badly and was almost sour. Chef was very chatty and unfortunately not very attentive to the orders. So, maybe come back for the appetizers, but not for the main course."}
{"text":"If you are looking for authentic Japanese food, this is the place to go. It's not fancy, not luxurious or pretentious but it's well-made Japanese cuisine.  We tried omakase for two since we recently moved up here and at $65 we were full and satisfied.  Jyo-San the owner was friendly with us and told us the history of his business and he knows pretty much everyone of his customers.  The sashimi was especially tasty (I think it's the way they prepare and store the fish) and the steamed egg was impeccable.  The trio appetizers plate was delicately made, tasted authentic and delicious.  The fresh wasabi is impressive as well.  The only thing I would suggest is that the restaurant needs an update on decor and more items on menu. Would go back again for some authentic sushi, sashimi and hot plates!"}
{"text":"wonderful food and service. everything is fairly good in price as well. the ambience was wonderful. everything was in good shape and clean."}
{"text":"Freshest sushi in Newmarket and Aurora area. This is my daughter and i's go to place for sushi and Japanese food. We have had the omakase here several times and that is also quite the treat. The service is usually quite good and the food is always fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Solo Sushi-Ya is an amazingly authentic Japanese experience in a surprisingly remote location.  Jyo the owner/master chef is super friendly and takes pride in his fresh ingredients and well executed menu.  When we are there we typically go for the $50 omakase tasting menu which I think is of phenomenal value.  Here is my perspective on a few of my favorite dishes off the menu:

tempura - fluffy and light with just the right amount of batter
chirashi don - wow, jyo loads the chirashi don up with a mound of his freshest raw seafood.  I'm sometimes wary of ordering chirashi, but not at Solo sushi.  I love it when amaebi (sweet shrimp) is in season, and he throws one of those fat sweet juicy shrimp in
sushi and sashimi - this is one of the best places in the GTA for fresh sushi and sashimi.  Jyo only purchases the best and it shows.  If you're a real sushi fan you'll skip the gimmicky rolls that most korean/chinese run sushi restaurants sell and come here for the real deal.

Love authentic Japanese and find yourself North of the 401?  You'll be happy here!"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi just amazing tasting menu highly recommended  i cant believe this place is in Newmarket !!!  It's a must for any sushi lover so fresh I will post some pics .."}
{"text":"Heard about Solo Sushi Ya for the longest time... as a Japanese food fanatic, I am dying to try out this place and see if it is really worth my while to drive all the way up to Newmarket.

Solo Sushi Ya is small nice, traditional Japanese restaurant.. the way that I envision Japanese places should be... I just find the modern deco really take away the experience... and some of the places trying to be too hip and too fusion...

Udon and soup noodle only serves during lunch time.. so I decide to try out the Tempura Udon and one of the sushi set... (I wish I can try out the omakase menu one day!!)

University Sushi Set ($17.95)
- nom nom nom... all the fish here are really fresh! Salmon and Tuna are great cut.. melt in your mouth fattiness... 
- Remember not to add wasabi in your soya sauce, Chef has put in the right amount of wasabi in the sushi itself to compliment the fish!!
- Shari rice I found it a little too vinegary for my taste

Tempura Udon ($10)
- Excellent dashi soup base... the star of this dish!! Nice and complex flavour salty and sweet the same time... we both drink all the soup
- Udon is nicely cooked not too soft with a certain bite...
- Shrimp and vegetable all lightly battered... just love it!! :)

Chef really took control of the whole restaurant, giving orders to the nice server..and make sure everyone are happy... Just love how the Chef/Cook are there to have full interaction with all the patrons!!

PS I got to use REAL chopsticks!! Not one of those disposables!!

Now the question is WHEN can I come back for Omaskase ($55)?? WHEN???"}
{"text":"If you are a sushi enthusiast, you must try Solo Sushi Ya. This restaurant serves the best sushi I have had in the GTA. The restaurant is located in New Market (which I know for some Torontonians ... it is a bit of a trek), but it's totally worth it. The last time I came here, the omakase was $75/person. You have to call ahead and make a reservation for the omakase. I usually come here with my family once a year.

The restaurant is small and very cozy on the inside - it really adds to the authentic Japanese feel. The owner is very friendly and will often come up to our table to make conversation. You can tell that he is very passionate about serving good quality food. A lot of the artwork up on the walls is done by his daughter. He is also impeccably good at recognizing his customers.

The sashimi is exceptionally fresh and gives off a subtly sweet finish. My absolute favourite is the scallop sashimi, followed by the sweet shrimp and salmon sashimi. The scallop sashimi is quite sizable and is significantly better quality than what you would normally get at an ordinary restaurant. I always try to savour every bite as much as possible; the texture is divine. The wasabi and soy sauce is high-quality. Unlike the clumped wasabi that usually comes in restaurants, the wasabi served here is smooth and almost liquid; it's spicy, but not harsh. The soy sauce is sweet, instead of overly salty. Once you've had their wasabi and soy sauce, you won't want to settle with what you've had before.

Another one of my favourites from the omakase menu is the baked egg custard dish. It's unlike anything you've ever had before. The dish tastes very light, despite housing an abundance of flavours. The egg is combined with fresh chicken broth and baked together with enoki mushrooms and salmon.

I would highly recommend the omakase for anyone wanting to treat themselves to a grand Japanese food experience."}
{"text":"As I was going through writing a few generally unfavorable reviews for other restaurants (especially the Japanese ones) I was starting to miss having good Japanese food.  So in a whim I decided to take the 25 minute drive north from home to one of the better Japanese restaurants that I know of: Solo Sushi-Ya at Newmarket.

Full Disclosure: I'm a \"regular\" here for a while so the head chef/owner, Jyo-san, knows me already and has greeted me even if I hadn't been here for over a year.

So coming here I knew I wanted one dish that he specializes in: the seafood motoyaki.  The question was: should I cheap out and just get a chiraishi don for filler to splurge a bit and get the omakase (which today was a bit more expensive $65 because he had a special dish).  Well since this was a solo-run, meaning I don't really care how much I spend (most of my non-foody friends would balk at the cost).  If it were another place I would balk too, but I've been coming here enough to trust the chef on his omakase, I am rarely disappointed.

Jyo-san's omakase is generally a \"surprise\" unlike others that lists what their omakase consists of.  Jyo usually tells us what the feature dish is though, but the rest is whatever he thinks based on some personal requirements.  I had only two: I want the seafood motoyaki and there better be no uni (sea urchin).

The meal started out with three appetizers with a nice table set.  The appetizers consisted of: edamame in some sauce, some veggies and some meat in sauce.  I forgot to ask what exactly they are, but suffice to say they were all good.  The edamame in sauce was a unique take from my regular edamame which is just boiled and served and was easily my favorite over the three.

I then got served with the main entree: fish pate.  I took a small scoop of it and put it in my mouth.  As it entered my mouth, I can already smell the scent of the fish.  As I chewed it a little and settle on my mouth, it felt like a sort of pudding (only a bit tougher) and every bite was giving more of the fish scent, without the flakiness of real fish meat or the sliminess of fish belly.  The chef explained to me that this is his own style and made it himself, and since the other places where I had fish pate never tasted this good, I guess it's true.

Then I got some sashimi: tuna, tataki, salmon and a large shrimp, with the house soy sauce.  Fresh as usual.  Nothing much to say here, probably because my mood wasn't into the raw fish.  However, the large raw shrimp tasted sweet, not too many places serve it raw, most of them cook it or serve a joke-only size.  It has a refreshing feel to the mouth when you eat it raw.

Coming up was seafood steamed egg.  Although it can't match my mom's steamed egg (that's still my favorite), Sushi-ya still has one of the better and more meaty ones when it comes to seafood steamed egg.  Gives your tummy a warmed up feeling to make yourself ready for more warm dishes.  Much better than the staple: miso soup.

Now for my requested main dish: Seafood tataki.  I am not sure if it is still in the menu, but whenever I go there I almost always order this.  It is seafood with spicy sauce, baked on a half shell.  That one really hit the spot.  I can't say much about it since I just wolfed the thing down.  The dish has a bit of kick, but I was taking it and even asked for a spoon to scoop up some of the burned parts.  Mmm, nom nom.

I then got my shrimp head from before deep fried and still presented nicely to me.  That was yummy, it was crunchy so you eat the whole thing, shell and all.  You have to eat this thing in small chunks, but I did it wrong, I ate the antenna side first, I think I should've eaten the back first since it was so large.

For my filler plate, I got some nigiri sushi.  Not much to say, it's just good to have it at this point because you want to try to fill the rest of the empty space in your belly.

Last, but not least, I finish the meal off with dessert.  For dessert, he provided me with fruit and mini rice puff on coffee pudding.  The coffee taste felt cool refreshing, it didn't have cream to make it feel heavy so it finishes off my meal very nicely.  Though, I think the coffee had kept me up the rest of the night, so I guess it is made of real coffee then.

I have discovered this place over a decade ago with a couple of friends.  Overall, if I have a lot of money or if I just want to have good Japanese food, this is still the place I would go to up until now.  In general, don't let the fact that this is in Newmarket throw you off.  It may be far distance-wise, but it is not much time-wise (in comparison to suffering to look for parking in Downtown Toronto or some other places.  It's a great place to take your significant other on a food trip."}
{"text":"We came after work on a grey Friday. We were the only ones at the restaurant when we started.


We had been there before and had gotten the omakase then and based on how great it was decided to get it again.

It's pricy at $65.  Okay maybe not in Toronto but for sure in Newmarket.  

It's great Sushi. Nice and fresh.  Loved the taste of everything, you can tell that the person preparing the food is skilled and really cares about what they are doing.

We weren't rushed, in fact it was a bit slow, but I'd rather wait a bit rather than have them standing there staring at us.

The only downside, they tried to up sell us something that actually came in the regular menu. Which was weird. 

Also, the place could use a good scrub, the floors are filthy. But the food preparation parts that we could see are immaculate."}
