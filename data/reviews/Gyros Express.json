{"text":"Seems Unethical that they copied another Gyros Express nearby.  I wouldn't go near people who would do that."}
{"text":"Not only is the food amazing, but the service is incredible.   I ordered a salad, and forgot to order it without cheese (not my favorite).  without me asking, they made me a new salad at no extra cost.   Very friendly.   Love this place!"}
{"text":"Food is alright.  Nothing to be crazy about.  A little bit on the higher price.  There's a sitting area in The front which is kinda nice."}
{"text":"Such a great place!!! Great menu!!!!! Top quality Mediterranean food. Service was amazing. Glad to find this place. MUST VISIT!!!! :)."}
{"text":"Old School.  Family owned. Best Greek food anywhere.  No Kidding. Not fancy..in fact...homey. But Fantastic food."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Gyros Express.  I eat at this location often.  Their big Greek salads are to die for.  All of the ingredients are super fresh and the dressing that they use is a perfect compliment.  I usually go \"off road\" with a beef souvlaki salad.  Beef souvlaki is my favorite meat at Gyro's Express.  While beef souvlaki salad does not officially appear on their menu, they will make it for you if you ask them.  Their beef souvlaki gyros are really good too as are their regular beef gyros (number 1 on the menu).  I would highly recommend Gyro's Express for delicious fresh food that is served quickly."}
{"text":"I have lived in Chicago and have rarely found compatible gyros here in Arizona. This place delivers. Great taste and very juicy not dry. Will defenatly go back."}
{"text":"I get dinner from this restaurant at least 3 times a week on my way home from work! My favorite is their #15, Beef Souvlki with rice and a side of hummus. The food is deliciously authentic and the service super friendly. My kids love the food from here as well!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The pita I had (the firefighter) was delicious, huge, and at a great price! The inside of the restaurant is newly renovated and inviting.  The service is excellent also! Check this place out!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years, probably the best shawarma in Arizona, hand down. Very friendly staff, very clean, great menu. Will always keep coming back."}
{"text":"Delicious food, Chicken Souvlaki Pita is amazing as well as the fireman gyro! Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Yum! Stopped in here tonight with my mom for dinner. We both got the gyros salad, and enjoyed it very much. It's a LOT of food! Iceberg lettuce, black olives, really good feta, bell peppers, tomatoes, and gyro meat. It came with pita and tzatziki sauce that was genuinely tangy like it should be. Friendly, polite, and fast service.

One star taken away for the awfully loud Greek music playing inside-- it gave me a headache just from listening to it while waiting for my food and we elected to eat outside instead. There's no reason ANY music should play that loud in a restaurant."}
{"text":"I was really pleased with Gyro Express! First and foremost they have a picture menu, score! Didn't your mother tell you that a picture is worth a thousand words? I was promptly greeted and my order was taken within seconds. The prices are slightly hire than other gyro places in the area but rightfully so. This place has a very open feel to it with flat screens all around so you can stay up-to-date on the latest sports and news! The kitchen is in the open so you can see exactly what the cooks are doing. The gyro meat is cut directly from the spit when ordered (just how I like it!). I had the Gyro salad which came with a pita. The salad was fresh and well balanced. However, I can't lie the tzatziki sauce is very thick but has a great flavor so I didn't mind. Beware, this place gets super busy around lunch time but they manage to keep the tables clean. I loaded some pictures of mine and my coworkers food.  I do look very forward to returning to this place again."}
{"text":"Delicious food and amazing customer service. Well priced food and very fresh produce. Definitely a spot to come if you're craving Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"I visited Gyro Express on my 30 minute lunch, I let the young woman at the register know I'd like my food in a \"to go\" box before hand even though I didn't get to sit down and eat. She was very kind, I wish I could remember her name! Anyway the place was nice and my food was served fairly quickly. I had time to eat there, the portions are big and the chicken was delicious. I also got hummus and a salad with my order. I'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"The bad first... this place is still very new, therefore the service is a little slow and disorganized. The good, was everything else. I got the #1"}
{"text":"Was around the plaza buying bagels for the work crew, when I realized I deserved some lunch for myself as a courier. I'm always down for a good gyro, but I never got to try this place.

I opted for the gyro plate so I could try the most - gyro, drink, tomatoes/onions, salad, and my chosen side of rice. Not used to getting a drink with the plate at gyro places, so that was a nice touch - standard soda fountain with Coke products. On a semi-busy weekday work lunch,  my order came around the 10 minute mark. 

Overall is a solid plate of food. Basmati rice was a little basic but had that nice yellow color to the grain. You have a solid grilled pita to go with everything, and I liked the vinaigrette for my salad. Most importantly, the gyro meat itself was solid. Well seasoned but not too salty, definitely not too oily, and a slight crisp since I was lucky enough to get some freshly cut meat from the roasting spit.

Overall a solid plate that made for an awesome work lunch. Would definitely been down to come again and swap out my side for hummus or fries."}
{"text":"It was alright.  The gyro was not as good an I expected.  I hated the sauce they gave me on the side.  It did not compliment the meal.   The restaurant was also very small and a little cramped at lunch time.  I might go back and give them a second chance, but maybe not for a while."}
{"text":"Shame on you for stealing the name of the original gyro express in Scottsdale on east Becker lane.  Your food isn't close to being as good as theirs."}
{"text":"Was in the area and wanted some good to eat .  I stumbled upon this place driving and good thing I ate here . Awesome gyro wrap and very friendly staff ."}
{"text":"There are plenty of casual Greek restaurants around the valley but this one is one of our favorites. My boyfriend used to frequent this place before he moved farther away but that is how I found out about it. 

We've been to this place a few times before. Most of those times, we phoned in a takeout order. Last night, we needed a quick dinner since we had been out and about. Since it was on our way home, we decided we would swing by.

I can't remember his name, but the person who took our order chatted with us for a bit. He spoke Greek and my boyfriend is half Greek so we were going over words or phrases my boyfriend knew in Greek. It was fun listening on them and that gentleman was so friendly. 

I ordered the gyro salad - it's my go-to. Brian got the gyro wrap and a side of Greek fries. My salad came with a pita, which I like because I make mini gyro wraps with them. Surprisingly, I enjoyed the Greek fries more than my boyfriend. I think it was feta cheese, lemon juice and some sort of dressing. He didn't like how soggy the fries were with all the dressing but I didn't mind. My salad was plentiful and too much for me to finish so I boxed up half of it to take home. Unfortunately, I forgot to bring it to work to have for lunch. 

I have a huge sweet tooth so of course, we got baklava. But what is even better is that the gentleman working there gave it to us as a complimentary dessert. Brian's mom makes wonderful baklava and this reminded me of it. By the way, if you haven't made baklava before, you don't know how much work it is - At least for me... Man, I've made it 3 times now and working with buttering all those layer of phyllo dough is tough (and makes you not want to eat it because of all the butter you used, haha). 

All-in-all, this place is back on our radar and we will be coming more often. Thanks for a great meal!"}
{"text":"The owner of this joint, which is crammed into a Tempe strip mall, is named ED and he was nice enough to offer me compensation in the form of a free meal after an incident at his other place in Mesa. We actually talked on the phone the day before my arrival. The first thing I noticed is that whoever striped the parking lot in this mall screwed up. The spaces are so tiny that is it a guarantee your door will get dinged and there is no way a passenger can open their door all the way to get out the car. The place was packed at noon, but another thing that I didn't like was that when you get your take-out bag, the cashier says the forks are all the way back by the soda machine and the napkin dispenser is in front of you. How bout buying that cutlery in a plastic wrapper for us and throwing it in the bag?  As for the food, I got the Chicken Souvaki and it was edible, but not a very good sandwich. The Tzatziki sauce was tasteless and a watery mess because it was doused all over the sandwich (try giving to-go customers the sauce on the side). The big chunks of meat were white meat, but needed to be cut down to make it able to be eaten in a sandwich. Pita Bread was fresh, but due to how thin that sauce was you needed at least 10 napkins and it soaked through to the bread. Side salad was tasty though with peppers, onions, tomatoes, olives and crunchy lettuce and hey the dressing was on the side. Not impressed, but ED seems like a nice guy and the office workers in the area seemed desperate to eat someplace other than Subway, so he should stay busy."}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice and I just do not like it. The food is not for me at all. I feel like my jaw is going to give out from all the chewing I have to do to eat the food. It hurts right now just writing this review. The staff was always super friendly and helpful, but I won't ever be coming back."}
{"text":"Never actually been into the store but religiously order this from Uber eats and I have never been disappointed with the quality large portions and the flavor is on point."}
{"text":"I've been here for lunch/dinner takeout a few times and have never been disappointed. 

The staff are friendly. Food is tasty. Good portion for the money you paid. The place is nice and clean. Great location with plenty parking spots. 

Overall, awesome and affordable place to casually grab lunch/dinner, especially when you are in the rush back to your office. Will recommend for others."}
{"text":"Amazingly good and very authentic Greek cuisine! It is clearly a fast food place, but the quality of the meal was great (as was the size of the serving for the price. A fast food decor, but a great place to grab a quality meal on the run!"}
{"text":"This is my first time here at this location and I have to say it's awesome. I had a gyro combo which was half Kronos and half Steak Gyro with the sauce tomatoes and onions pita bread. They give you such a large portion on the sandwich!"}
{"text":"What a sweet find! Massive euros and really tasty! The staff and the owners are really friendly and they took great care of us. Will definitely be back! Try the chicken Shawama gyro with extra garlic sauce"}
{"text":"Perfect go to if you have a hankering for a good gyro sandwich. Portion size was fulfilling and impressive considering I ordered takeout. It was delicious. They also have side bar items that are super good too like a Chicago style pizza puff and jalapeño poppers. Plan on indulging here as often as I can. Convenient location and awesome customer service too!"}
{"text":"Great food, very fresh and the service is great as well.
Had a combination plate with gyros and steak shawerma, the seasoning was super tastey! 

Service was wonderful, staff very friendly."}
{"text":"Love this place!! The staff working is very friendly, and the food is great! I got the gyro plate, but I usually get a gyro pita or a greek salad! All 3 have been wonderful! Cashier was very nice even when I spilled a soda all over the table, he rushed over and told me not to worry at all and cleaned it up so fast! It was totally my fault, but he took care of it in a flash!"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place by mistake as it used to be another Greek restaurant.  No fancy setup here but the food was very delicious, very tasty and there is a wide range of dishes to choose from!  I did a take-out and they were very quick with my order.  The cashier was very knowledgeable about their menu and she was very helpful.  I had the beef souvlaki and it was nicely marinated, meat was tender and perfectly grilled!  Their pita bread was nice and soft, wonder if they make it themselves.  I will definitely be back..."}
{"text":"Good gyro, but nothing more than average. As good as any gyro in Scottsdale, overpriced at $6.75 for just a gyro sandwhich."}
{"text":"So delicious & fantastic staff!  My go-to gyro place in the valley, hands down.  Their falafel salad is great, too!  They gave us a sample of their beef shawarma - so good, my husband ordered it.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I was in the area and needed a quick bite so I checked Yelp and found Gyro Express so I decided to stop by them real quick. When they said \"Express\" they lived up to their name, the food came out very quickly which was great. 

I arrived there at around 12 and placed my order at the register. The man who took my order was very friendly. I ordered a Gyro meal (thinking I would get fries and a drink with it). I was asked if I wanted rice or salad so I decided I would go for the salad. I paid just under $10 for my meal. 

Within just about 3 min, my food was out. I got my sandwich, salad and a drink, no fries.. So I guess I didn't get this correctly. I didn't go back and ask about the fries and just decided to go ahead and eat. The salad tasted fresh but I didn't enjoy the feta cheese very much. The gyro was hot and fresh and it tasted pretty good but I wish they had a little more veggies and tzaziki. For the amount I paid, I expected to have a bigger meal. The sandwich was huge yes but I expected to have another side. 

Was the food good? Yes it was, but would I pay so much again for the meal? not sure to be honest."}
{"text":"I like the food.
I like that I get a discount because I'm a local employee.
I like the location.
But ... their registers aren't correctly coded for the correct Sales Tax ... and that's annoying.  Especially since the sales tax changes on 7/1 ... so if you are fine with pennies, keep going.  As of right now, it bothers me."}
{"text":"Wow, one of the best gyros I've ever had. The gyro sauce was great, and the lamb was very tasty. My wife had the gyro salad and they give you so much meat! I also had the pizza puff for an appetizer, it was also great. The owner was very nice and welcoming. This place is a MUST go for gyro lovers !!!!"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch and ordered the chicken gyro. It comes out to about $6 by itself, and an extra $2.50 to add on a drink and side/salad. I opted to keep my lunch cheap so the gyro with a water cup was enough... though I probably could have polished off a side dish. The chicken was quite tender, pita bread was soft and pliable, and came with an extra side of tzatziki sauce (so crucial). 

The small location is tucked away in a busy lot that shares with several very popular chain restaurants. I wouldn't be surprised if most people went there before checking out this little gyro dive. For me, it was the quick and healthy option. I noticed lots of people waiting for take-out orders, so keep that in mind if you work nearby."}
{"text":"Came here spur of the moment really friendly atmosphere and really enjoyed the Firefighter pita."}
{"text":"Wow, the food is the only thing better than the service, and the service is excellent!"}
{"text":"I am so disappointed and disgusted by the owner/manager at this restaurant. He screamed at my husband and me about an order from Uber eats and hung up on us over a charge for chicken on hummus....2 times. We only wanted an explanation of a $7+ charge for the chicken.
This company is not about the customer at all and has no regard or respect for those spending money at this place of business. He was discriminatory to me as a woman by belittling my inquiry and hanging up mid-conversation. 
As a small business owner, he should be trying to make customers happy and in return, produce return customers. He missed the management skills class apparently.
TERRIBLE CUSTOMER RELATION PRACTICES!!!!! I'LL NEVER ORDER FROM/STEP INSIDE GYROS EXPRESS AGAIN!!!!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place but it fell short! Staff was very friendly when ordering and polite.
I ordered the grilled chicken salad and it took about 15 minutes to get it which is fine since they made it fresh.
However, the chicken was so dry, I could barely wash it down. The dressing was decent and portion ample but I just couldn't get pass the chicken being so bad. Served with a pita on the side and nothing special.

Would I go back? Hmmmm, may give one more try. It's not anywhere close to Z's Greek on Indian school, think I will just make the drive to go there. Damn!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The chicken, hummus and zucchini is delicious! Great family owned restaurant. I'm there a few times a week."}
{"text":"Not the Original Gyros Express. That's off of Scottsdale and shea."}
{"text":"It was okay.  The pita was nice, soft and fluffy.  They do not have whole wheat pita, so thats a bummer.  The falafel were okay, but a little drier than I hoped.  And the falafel sandwich didn't have any pickles, so it was missing that extra zing that usually makes a falafel pita so amazing.  They gave me the tahini on the side so my sandwich didn't get soggy, and I ordered a side of hummus, so I added that to the sandwich too.  Their hummus was okay, but it was a bit more bland than I'm used to. Could definitely use another garlic clove and a little more lemon in the recipe."}
{"text":"just now trying this place for the first time and it's so good! large portions for the price and the flavors are so on point. so happy it's only a minute away from work :)"}
{"text":"The best baba ghanouj in town (eggplant, olive oil, taihini mix) and probably the freshest.

The manager is always so friendly.  Love coming here!!

The firefighter pita is another noteworthy item if you are in the mood for a spicy pita.  Don't see this option much elsewhere."}
{"text":"Had the Gyro and Shawarma - Very sauce was very SALTY!
The shawarma steak was chew and also very salty! 
Very disappointed. Maybe a visit to East Coast / West coast might help improve the recipe for the gyros and shawarma. 
Luckily there is another Gyro place not too far, which is much better! 
Kudos on the Fries tho!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Prime location on the way home from a long work day. Clean establishment with a great selection of meals. I always get the chicken plate with their tasty garlic sauce, salad & rice. Owners are friendly as well. Yum!"}
{"text":"At Gyros Express my wife and I each enjoyed delicious gyros' served in a reasonable amount of time and HOT!  In my evaluation of restaurants number one on my criteria list is that foods meant to be served temperate to hot should be delivered that way.  Number two is the food should be of good taste, and three includes the attitude of the servers.  We found Gyros Express to meet all three measures."}
{"text":"Fast food place. Pita was stale. Falafel was undercooked. Gyros were ok. Salad was just lettuce and tomatoes with weird feta. But the staff is really nice and good authentic music selection."}
{"text":"Drove past Gyros Express on the way to work one day and thought to myself I need to go try them out, so that day came and off I went.

I got there around 11:50am little before the lunch rush and I placed my order to go and waited. Behind me was a group of 6 people who all placed their order as well and was seated and they all were served before my order was up. After 15 minutes I was asked if I had placed an order yet or had a number, I just told them I have been waiting for my order.  That kind of put me off, made me think that to go service isn't as express as if it would have been had I just eaten there. 

What I ordered was the chicken souvlaki pita combo with fries and an extra thing of tzatziki sauce, I love my fries in the tzatziki sauce, soo good so I didn't mind paying extra for it.  The chicken was very flavorful, tender and juicy; the pita was fresh and perfect.  This was a delish pita and just what I was craving.

Glad I got to try another lunch spot within my work area, but didn't really like the feeling of being forgotten."}
{"text":"Just moved into the area from nyc. I walk in this place praying I'm gonna get a good gyro. And the gyro I got was so good I'm about to go back and get another one. This gyro joint is gonna pump so many gyros into my face."}
{"text":"My hunt for a good Mediterranean Restaurant in the area ends today! The hummus, falafel and pita were really tasty. And the fries!!! Yummmm!!! Loved it! The chef suggested excellent combinations from their vegetarian menu. Service was quick. Ambience is okay ... I preferred the outdoor seating. Definitely going back for more!"}
{"text":"The guy that is under this place is a literal boss. Someone just dropped their meal and he reacted so kind and is making them a new one. Totally cool. 

The food is amazing- I got mango sauce on mine and it was to die for! Loved it."}
{"text":"This place has an awesome and very friendly atmosphere with great music playing. 

Today was my first visit. I got the Falafel Pita with Mango sauce and was blown away! Service was welcoming and very prompt.

The food deserves its own line for being AWESOME!! Their Mango sauce is absolutely incredible and one of the best things I've ever tasted. I work close to here and am definitely going back! 

I got a Baklava on the way out and enjoyed it with a coffee from the nearby Starbucks. It was perfect and not too sticky or too sweet.

Thanks for making my lunch awesome! I'm visiting again many more times!"}
{"text":"By far the best Gyro place I have been to. Move here from Milwaukee and tried many Greek places trying to find a good gyro plate but nothing hit the spot till now. 

The restaurant is clean and well maintained, looks very new. Staff was very friendly and the food was perfect. 5/5 stars. 

Defiantly a place I will be returning to even though I live 30min away."}
{"text":"My wife and I just ate here and had an amazing lunch.  We rarely write reviews but felt this place was worth noting.  The portions are big and food is delicious.  We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We love gyros and I really wanted to love this place. My husband works at the hospital and it would have been an easy spot to pick up dinner on his way home. In fact one of the doctors had picked up some for lunch yesterday and my husband was so impressed that he insisted we change our plans and go there for dinner.

We ordered the falafel, zucchini and the hummas as appetizers. Then we ordered 2 gyros sandwiches with fries and a drink. 1 regular and 1 chicken. 

The falafel was delivered and it was shaped like a donut with a hole in the middle. Although the outside was cooked the inside was mushy. The flavor was good but since the inside was not cooked the texture made it not edible. 

The zucchini was good except that it was not totally hot on the inside but the outside was close to burnt. 

The hummas was ok We were surprised that they only have plain flavored hummas. It was a little bland in flavor but was not bad and the pita was excellent. 

The sandwiches and fries were delivered and the first thing I noticed was that the fries were overcooked. The sandwiches were ok but the Tzatziki sauce was very heavy on the dill and the flavor really overpowered the sandwich. 

The gentleman that was working came and asked how the food was. We told him the honest truth. The oil was too hot. It caused the Falafel to not cook inside, the zucchini not to get hot inside and it burned the fries. We had only eaten 1/3 of our food and could not eat anymore. He said he would tell the chef.

He came back and gave us 3 pieces of Baklava to go. (We don't even like Baklava) and that was the end of it. We threw the food away and left.

In all fairness we did go to the place on a Friday night at 7:30 pm and they close at 8. Maybe had it been earlier in the day they would have offered to recook the food or do something different. Of course with the oil too hot I am not sure they could have corrected that in time. By 7:50 they were removing the meat and starting to close up shop.

My husband even pointed out that he had the food earlier in the day and had a totally different experience.

It was disappointing and I don't think I can give it another try mostly because they really did not seem to care that the meal sucked and overcooked."}
{"text":"Salad was fresh and their shawarma was delish!  Loved the fast service and clean atmosphere."}
{"text":"I've only had a handful of items, so I can't comment on everything as the menu is rather extensive.  I can say the Falafel Pita, Chicken Pita, and Chicken Salad are all rather good, however I personally find all of the bread a tad overwhelming with the pitas.  

A few tips:
-The address says Priest Dr, but it actually faces Warner.  Just a couple of doors down from the Dunkin' Donuts.

-Good luck if you go during the noon lunch rush and try to dine-in.  The room is very tight with tables and you'll likely be sitting on top of another party who can hear your conversation.  On the plus side, you'll also be able to eavesdrop on theirs.  My trick is to go at 11:30 rather than 12.  If you're a late eater, maybe 1 would work better.

-If you're trying to do low-carb by ordering a salad, they'll still tempt you by providing a side of pita and tzatziki sauce.  Just one aspect I love to hate."}
{"text":"Are you kidding with me!? Where has this place been living in AZ my whole life. Hands down best Greek food I've had outside of Greece. Well done guys!!!"}
{"text":"Not sure how I haven't reviewed this place before. For the last two years I've been coming here at least once a week. #1 on my list for gyros and I've been to many of them in the valley. Plus Kal is a veteran"}
{"text":"The NEW location is alright at best,  today was the 3rd time we have been there and WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT.  The place was empty until we came in so you would think they would have time to make our order correct - The amount of gyros on the pita was very sparce along with hardly any sauce, we had to ask for more and paid extra.  We asked for fries extra crispy and they actually came undercooked (barely done at all).  Also, not even hot in temperature.  And neither was the gyros !

Oh did I mention the owner and 4 other cooks were in the kitchen along with the cashier......and again I will add NOONE was in the restaurant it was 5:30 now when we got our food.  People started coming in about 6:00 PM or so up until now \"I can't think of a reason our order didn't come right\".

There is way to many other places that serves gyros - including their other location not far from this one in chandler.  I guess that's why there were hardly any customers at prime time dinner hour???"}
{"text":"Finally found an awesome Gyros in a pita and much much more to offer. The customer service was fantastic and provided great suggestions. A 15 minute drive was worth the satisfaction and the beef sandwich was awesome! Great location ! Highly recommend !"}
{"text":"Great chicken shwarma and the hummus is just right (some places make it too salty, but not here!). Also, the baklava was heavenly! Highly recommend getting the baklava if you're here. The service was fantastic, everyone was so nice and helpful. Come check it out!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this location. I love the staff. I love the food. I LOVE LOVE the food. Coming from the east coast, we had great Greek places around every corner. Out here, not so much. 

They have so many dishes and platters to choose from. I love their chicken ones best. I haven't tried the lamb yet but it's on my list to taste next. 

Their hummus and their sauces are amazing. I can't stand when Greek places have watery sauces. Not here! The owners son who's in high school works here when he isn't in school, obviously. He has suggested something for me to try every time I have been in. Haven't been steered wrong yet! 

It's tucked in the back in the plaza which is why for so long I didn't even notice its existence. But now? I won't go anywhere else for Greek."}
{"text":"I'm a regular for take out from this place. Gyro plate, comes with gyro meat, salad, hummus, I get a side of rice. It is ALWAYS good. Well worth the money. But they often get my take out order wrong (I order extra tzatziki) so check! Well worth the money for above average simple Greek takeout"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches! I got a veggie one and it was huge and filling! I got extra garlic sauce on the side. Super tasty and price was great, especially for a Mediterranean place. You can tell the owner takes pride in his restaurants. Everything was clean and well organized. Staff was very friendly too. We will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"This was just okay. I had a gyro salad which was huge, but the gyro meat was Sliced paper thin making it dry and the dressing was like taziki sauce usually served with a gyro sandwich.  I prefer a Greek dressing with a red wine vinegar base."}
{"text":"Awesome awesome food. Probably the best gyro meat I have tried in the valley, and the firefighter pita will surely satisfy spice-o-philes such as myself...mmm. Chicken gyros are just as delicious. My coworkers and I eat here at least once a week. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Gyros were edible but not excellent. The falafel sandwich was bland. Falafel balls tasted heavy and greasy and were cooked to long. The place was clean and the service was excellent. Nice people. Avg food."}
{"text":"This place is good. It's inexpensive. The staff know their food and their food left my mouth screaming \"more!\" even when my stomach said enough. 
Worth a trip to Scottsdale for lunch!

There are two in Scottsdale. This one is the one I went to on Shea and 92nd. For some reason yelp put my review on the other one and I didn't catch it. Erg."}
{"text":"I work down the street from this place. I had a short lunch break so I figured id stop and pick something up. I am a very big fan of Greek food. I never miss the greek festival and the gyros are one of my favs. For $8 bucks you get a very generous pita, fries and a drink. My fav is the firefighter gyro. Spicy yet good.. I can eat there about 3xs a week. Small place but great flavor, prices and employees are great."}
{"text":"This smallish restaurant features a walk up ordering system similar to fast food.  It is high-quality and high-value in my opinion.  I usually get the gyro & fries and may sometimes splurge on falafel or baklava.  There are about 6 tables in the dining room and the same amount of tables outside.  The food comes out hot.  The gyro meat is rotating behind the counter.  They have many appetizers as well.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Food was Great! The best Gyro sandwich I have had since Chicago, IL. Fast, hot and fresh. The staff is friendly and the short younger female that works there is sexy with a beautiful smile. Does it get any better than a sexy female and a great Gyro?"}
{"text":"If you are American, or don't know much about Greek food then it is probably a 2-3 star rating.The restaurant is clearly middle-eastern and should not advertise itself as \"Greek\" when it isn't. On the good side, it was a lot of food, but it was barely edible in my opinion. The 3 meat combo plate: salad was ok, but feta cheese does not make a salad \"Greek.\" The gyro meat was dry but ok. The chicken souvlaki was extremely dry and had a bad flavor. The Swarma meat tasted very old and I and was even drier that the other 2 meats. All in all it was pretty bad. I will never eat there again."}
{"text":"YUM!!  I had the steak schwarma pita today and it was awesome - the steak was super flavorful and the dill sauce was great.  I would definitely give it 5 starts, but I went here months ago and it wasn't nearly as good.  I'll update this review if it stays consistent."}
{"text":"Pretty tasty fast food gyros spot.

Gyros Express is small & no frills - there are a few booths and a small counter for seating, but I'm guessing a lot of their business is take out. That said, the inside looked clean to me.

I had a gyro plate ($11) with rice instead of fries and really liked it. It's a huge amount of food - definitely enough for 2 - I was only able to eat 1/2. The gyros was not too salty or greasy and their tzatziki looked homemade. Plates come with a salad and I really appreciated that they packed the dressing separately so it didn't get all soggy.

Service was fast and pleasant - what more do you want?"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place and be able to go there once a week. Unfortunately the place is just not worth wasting money at. The easiest way to judge any gyro place it by their tzatziki sauce and it is just not done right. The chicken schwarma is the driest I have ever had before and is just made plain wrong. The gyros are ok and because of that fact I stopped in a few more times hoping that they could win me over. If you go in after 7 pm do not expect them to have enough food to get everything on the menu either.  The one thing they have going for them is the staff is extremely friendly and polite. If you are looking for food and don't care about taste then this is probably the place for you if not I would recommend you stay away."}
{"text":"My husband and I go when we work late, It is family owned business and I have seen the Father and the adult children work there, very nice people, The Atmosphere is nice and you can tell their is a regular crowd, The best Gryo's I have had in a long time, I don't like the hamburger they offer it is mixed with other ingredients, if they just salt and pepper the hamburger and leave all the other ingredients out and serve it on the pitas with the tzatziki sauce, onion and lettuce it would be awesome. All the chicken dishes are great. A must visit for authentic Greek food."}
{"text":"This is a hidden little gyro gem! By far the best gyro I've had in a 35 minute radius and I'm lucky it's so close to me.  I'd probably drive out of my way to eat here.  The traditional gyro is delicious with lots of meat.  I've also tried the gyro salad which was huge and comes with both tszaki sauce and a pita side.  They are super kid friendly and are very friendly to boot. They also serve up schwerma plays which I will also soon try."}
{"text":"Update: Went back today for dinner, and again, the flavor was excellent but the gyros were literally HALF the size as they were previously. We ordered two gyros and my mom's was about double the size of mine. Later, we ordered one to go to bring home, and it was even smaller than mine! The inconsistency of the portions is a turn-off."}
{"text":"Best gyros in town right here!  The meat is shaved from a spit and is soooo flavorful and juicy you just can't believe it!  Soft wonderful pitas, thick tzaziki, zesty Greek dressing...you can't go wrong here. I've been coming here at least 10 years and they are consistently fabulous. Great service every time, too."}
{"text":"I always get their salads and the Gyro meat is not greasy, Chicken is very good as well too. Lettuce, cukes, peppers, olives, onions. Easy location but can fill up at lunch with Honeywell folks sometimes. Pitas are great! Service is friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"After watching something on Food Channel, I got an instant craving for a gyro.  I did a search on Greek fast food near me and located Gyros Express.  My wife and I drove over to give it a try.

I give it 3 stars as there are some positives and some negatives.

Positives:  My gyro was very good and I was full after eating it and the fries.

Negatives:  (1) My wife's Greek salad was mostly lettuce,  How come no feta cheese?  (2) My gyro was mostly meat, but again, how come no feta cheese?  (3) The hand sanitizer dispenser next to the drink station was empty and appears like it's been empty for awhile.  

I may return and give it another try.  But I really do expect feta cheese with Greek food."}
{"text":"Good customer service. We were here in town for a baseball tournament and wanted to change up the food rhythm we had the last few days (hamburgers, pizza, Mexican food, etc). The chicken shawirma pita was on point. My wife and daughter shared their chicken salad and enjoyed it. Dressing a tad bit oily. But still ok. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Tried this place twice - first time I got the gyro pita and this time I tried the falafel.  Neither of them really stood out as anything special, but this falafel was just plain disappointing.  Not flavorful and didn't taste fresh either.  Overall this place is decent but I'm not impressed and won't be returning."}
{"text":"love this place! gyro pita is very good, and the tzatiki sauce is awesome. This is a hole in the wall , you will not even notice them because you have the bigger restaurant chains around them. I got tired of eating chipotle, and was in the area and stumbled into this gem of a spot! I am hooked. I recommend for sure, oh and one more thing- friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Meh first impression.

This place just opened and it is in walking distance to my office.

First impression is pretty neutral. I had high hopes seeing as you can see them making your gyros and you can see the meat spin.

Service: took a while to place the order and the cashier was very confused and couldn't answer all my questions. The preparation took a while to be ready also. Probably a common pattern for a restaurant on its second day.

Meal: I had the chicken souvlaki meal with extra tzaziki sauce, which was .50 extra. It came with fries and soda for about 10 $ but I got a 10% discount for working so close. The tzatziki sauce was a disappointment and I think it was the main reason I didn't really love the taste of my meal. It has a lot of herbs and not really even a hint of cucumber. The chicken was a little dry, and the fries were cold and unappetizing. Sodas are coca cola products with ok mix. (A little on the extra sweet side)"}
{"text":"Growing up in a middle eastern home it is very hard to go to restaurants and really appreciate their food. My first impression of this place was that it was the best looking Gyros shop I have seen. Tv's everywhere, very cool for summer, city of Chicago appreciation, and open kitchen. I have tried a few of their meals and all were very delicious. Of course some of their ingredients are not as authentic like mama's cooking but very exceptional. Their chicken or steak grinder is a must try! Delicious gyros and Greek salad. Hummus not bad at all. They have a large menu so I still have plenty to try but so far no complaints and a satisfied stomach!!

Just tried the steak calzone and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"The food is really good. The customer service is also great! This definitely a top Mediterranean spot for me."}
{"text":"There are times when a good gyro is just needed! Luckily for me after recently relocating from the Midwest I moved within a few miles of a good one! The place is clean and the staff are friendly. I never wait long for my food and it arrives hot and delicious! I have yet to be disappointed! I look forward to my next visit, but right now, I HAVE A GYRO TO EAT!"}
{"text":"550pm, tursday it's busy medium sized, order at cash register, kind of place.  No one said hello when i walked in, but it's when i give my order and how i receive it that matters most in these places and that part was good. It was an open clean place, but i took my pita gyros with fries home. Food was good, wish veggies were more evenly distributed...still tasted good.  I like it. $10.31."}
{"text":"It was close, fast and pretty good! I did not like the dressing on my salad. The atmosphere was semi-fast foodish. The bathroom situation was odd."}
{"text":"My Gyro took over 9 minutes to come & I realized I ordered the pork Gyro.... The pork meat was not tender I ended up leaving  half the pita bread, not feeling it. The fries were fresh and Gyro sauce were good. $12 for a meal plus tip? Ill give this place another try but it will be a while"}
{"text":"Small little place perfect for a casual lunch or a quick lunch break. Small patio area out front that is shaded from the afternoon sun.

Walking in the door everything smells great. I ordered a Chicken Schwarma with fries. Everything looked great, but once I dug into the meal I found the chicken to be dry and the lettuce used to not be cleaned properly. No one likes buts in their food! Fried were bland and lacked a solid crunch. If it were 40% cheaper it would be a great little place.

I wouldn't come back"}
{"text":"Very tucked away but worth the visit.  The food is great for casual dining.  Not fancy but very pleasant."}
{"text":"Excellent food excellent service and it's quick the portions are amazing and unbelievable sediment deserves five stars."}
{"text":"Great place: delicious, fantastic service and superb value. Will definitely be back and will bring my Greek wife"}
{"text":"This was a Greek Mediterranean restaurant for a while. Then they closed and this place reopened. They do an excellent job on the food preparation as well as a clean friendly establishment. Very nice sized portions and all of their sandwiches can be made into combos for an additional $2.50 which includes fries and a drink or a salad. I had the gyros combo With crinkle fries and a drink. I Will be coming back to try other stuff."}
{"text":"Delicious! The servings are plentiful. Even the kids meals are enough to feed an adult. Would highly recommend. The only reason it's four stars instead of 5 is because the prices are pretty high."}
{"text":"New business here where the less than stellar gyros place was beforehand.  Renovations were an improvement but nothing special, however the television monitor menu pictures are great.  Real disappointment with the hummus portion size because it was incredibly small for $4.25, as it was a very small side plate with a thin layer.  Something like that is more like a little \"add on\" to a gyro for something like $2.   Falafel was fairly good, but they're north of $1 per falafel croquette which is on the high side for fast food like this."}
{"text":"Oh my God, wicked good food! I wish I lived nearby so o could go again, but I'll definitely be back when I'm back in Scottsdale. The restaurant is a bit in the small side, so it's perfect if you're looking for some great take out."}
