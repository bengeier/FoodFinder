{"text":"One of the best places in Tempe to get a late-night snack that isn't horrible for you.  I'm guilty of not always (or even usually) going with the most healthy options, but the sheiftalia platter has got to be better for me than a burger and fries, right?  Their tzaziki is bomb, the sheiftalia is delicious and tender and juicy and coated in just the right amount of lemon-y-ness, and their pitas are thick and soft, the way they should be.  They're open 'til 3:30 AM, and they deliver.  If you love good food and like to eat at weird hours of the night, do it here.  You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Do not order to-go from this place. I was told it would take 35-45 minutes for delivery, but after an hour I called to check on my order and was given a \"sorry, he just headed out.\" Another half hour later I had to call and cancel my order because I could not wait anymore. I was out on hold 3 times. Poor service and it sounded as if the employees were clueless on what to do. I got no explanation as to why it took so long. Disappointed."}
{"text":"I received a flyer on my door that said they deliver. Went online at 7:20 to order for delivery and it said it wouldn't be delivered until 9:08. I thought that was completely ridiculous so I called at 7:24 for pickup instead. The assistant manager answered the phone and advised me that delivery would take about 45 minutes, not an hour and a half as suggested online. I asked how long would pickup take and was told it would be ready in 15 minutes. I didn't actually get my food until a half hour later, and by the time I got home, it had been 45 minutes and I could have just ordered delivery. When I complained to the assistant manager, he said they had new kitchen staff and I wasn't the only one who had to wait for my food. He did not offer any empathy or offer any kind of compensation. Eating here is a complete waste if time. This place used to be good, but now that don't care about their customers. Be wary, the kitchen staff is new and can't even keep up with cooking ordinary chicken gyros on time. Not the kind of place you want to eat at, unless you want to wait an unnecessarily long amount of time for an average gyro."}
{"text":"DON'T GO FOR THE FALAFEL  I got a groupon to Oliveo Grill - and I thought it would be a perfect introduction, who wouldn't want to spend $8 for $20 of food?    I ordered the falafel plate.  I was a bit disappointed at the plate as it only included hummus, rice, and falafels.  I don't know why I was, the plate description was pretty much that - but when the plate was first put in front of me, everything was a beige color.  It was boring and visually unappealing.    So when I got to the falafels, man, was I even more disappointed.  I am a bit of a falafel freak - the falafels at Oliveo are like sturdy hard bricks.  The flavor of the falafel was okay, but chewing each bite was an arduous task by itself.  Based on the opening hours, the interior and the clientele, I think Oliveo is a better fit for the post-closing time crowd who want something fairly substantial for a little money and that is not my current demographic."}
{"text":"With limited delivery options, we were very excited to try this. Sadly the food was very bland and didn't have enough sauce on our pitas. We got Greek salads too and the dressing had no flavor. Would be willing to try again but would ask for additional sauce and a different side then salad."}
{"text":"Still waiting on my food.... we ordered at 7 and they delivered an hour later with the wrong order.  I have now called 2 times and was told the driver was dispatched 18 minutes after letting them know of the mixup in the order.  Im so pissed and hungry.   I will never order from here again.  Food is good, but every single time without fail they mess up the order. It's high college kids taking your order.  This is not how you run a business.  When I complained they were not apologetic like it didn't matter to them.  Update:  food came about 10 minutes after posting this and was cold.  Clearly the driver delivered for his tips first and we were his last stop.  This was the icing on the cake.  Owner owns Salute too, wonder if customers are valued there."}
{"text":"This is a good place for basic Greek fare. It's quick and the pitas are pretty cheap and filling. However, 20 dollars for the internet special of two dinner plates and a free appetizer was a bit steep (although the dolmades with Greek salad were very tasty). Oh, and I'm pretty sure the guy taking my order was dropped on his head as a child - check your to go order to ensure they get it right."}
{"text":"I work not too far from here and the guys I work with go nuts over this place. I can't help but join the fan fair. Its hard not to when everyone you work with is ordering delicious hummus. When you resist you always regret not indulging and have to deal with the tempting Mediterranean smell. This place does great Greek food at reasonable prices AND THEY DELIVER! For 1.50 they will deliver until 3am!!!!!!!!! When I work the late shift we are still ordering!   I usually get the dio deal which is two gyro pitas for 7.99. If you order hummus it comes in a huge container and is as much if not less than you would pay at the grocer. Except you don't have to wait in the long self check out lines to not know how to scan your item and have a clerk run up and fix it for you anyway.  I used to live on campus and I don't know if this place wasn't around yet or I was just unaware. Either way I was missing out and now you are too."}
{"text":"Great food at a great price, best Greek restaurant in tempe!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was fairly busy with students and once I placed my order I understood why. I got a gyro, fries and a drink for under $8! Definitely a great value for your dollar.   The staff was friendly and the food came out rather quick even with the busy lunch crowd.  The food...hmmm...well, it tasted good but not great. The gyro meat was tender but not as flavorful as I've had in other establishments."}
{"text":"The perfect combo of tastiness and value.  Grilled lamb were tender & juicy.    High on the I'll be back list"}
{"text":"Totally solid from the standpoint of the food is predictably good, especially the fries, it's open all hours of the night, easy location, only thing that could be improved is the ambience, but then again, maybe that's part of the charm...a little rought around the edges.  Either way, I have no problem going back every so often."}
{"text":"First let me say, I'm a hard sell. I'm from Chicago where you can find great food on every block. Since I've moved here (10 years ago) I've been continuously disappointed and left feeling ripped off for over paying for bad food.   I was sceptical when I ordered, but I wanted delivery and didn't want pizza so I gave it a try.   I ordered the Chipotle Provalone Cheese Steak. OMG it was so good. I was stuffed after eating half of it and thank the Lord they had cheese wiz for the fries (hard to find in this state).   The price was very good, especially considering the quality and portion size. Definately found a new regular spot to eat"}
{"text":"\"Greekalicious\" This is the place for your greek lunch! (and it's not just a bunch of college kids either!) My whole office frequents this place - the greek fries are amazing. This isn't a fancy restaurant and you won't be wowwed by the decor, but the food is excellent and the price is awesome. They have lunch and late night specials, but they also often have great coupons through LunchClub or their website ($5 your choice pita, fries and drink). Way better than wasting my money on greasy fast food. The staff is super friendly and if you're a cute girl they're often flirty too. yum yum yum nom nom nom"}
{"text":"Sorry, but I agree with the lower reviews here.  First the good parts: the gorgeous blond behind the register was a) the order-taker; b) the cashier; c) the server all in one!  She was helpful and thankfully brought out my falafel appetizer well before the entree came out.  The next best thing was the feta on the greek fries.  The fries were hot, crispy, and nicely coated with feta, lemon, and dijon, but the feta was real imported stuff made of sheep's milk (strong and stinky!).  Nice.  Clearly, the food was served fresh with the pitas still warm, the lettuce still crisp, etc.  And the service was fast and easy.  Sadly, that's about it.  It's not that it was terrible, but I certainly would not go back and spend further coins.  The Chuck Box is just down the street for cryin' out loud!  I just had a Groupon and thought I would give it a whirl, but the souvlaki was just 4 pieces of grisly lamb chunks, I can make better tsaziki at home, and the \"classic gyro\" just did NOT meld.  Just maybe I had not had enough to drink before coming here.  And I'm a couple decades past the point of being a starving student.  There are better choices to spend a meal.  LOL.   A couple of people on here said, \"I just had to get home and see what Yelp said about this place....\"  That's how I felt!  But based on the overall (highly) positive reviews, it kinda slants my perspective on whether the reviewers can really be trusted."}
{"text":"i order from here oftem. they are always polite and the food is great, they even offer veggie patties.   i had an issue once with an order being late for delivery. i called to ask about where my order was, and they told me what happened remade my order and offered me a free meal in the future.   they are also open late which is a plus."}
{"text":"I learned about Oliveo Grill when it used to be across the street, under the name \"Cypress Grill\". I've been coming to this place for about a year and a half, 9/10 it'll be the best meal you've had for under $7. They deliver til about 3am. If it's your first time, you should try a chicken breast pita or a gyro.  The only bad thing about Oliveo is, you'll go so much they'll know you by name :). There's no getting around it. Lovely staff."}
{"text":"Its open late at night. I am a vegetarian and there are enough options available. Really economical. Love the pitas and Greek fries. Really friendly people!"}
{"text":"Tried the Greek Fries, lamb souvlaki and chicken bruchetta.. Everything was good. For next time, I'd probably ask for no Parmesan cheese on the chicken bruchetta so I can enjoy the pesto sauce even more! Definitely recommended!!"}
{"text":"To start I must give credit where its due. Oliveo's is somewhat of a pillar of the ASU community. Saying that, it is where tons of asu students have worked over the years, actually first job I held when I moved to town, not the reason I give it 5 stars so don't stop reading yet. The reason I quit was because they had a higher standard of service than I was willing to perform for them, because the money was short, but I wasn't a college kid then as I am now so I can appreciate it. The atmosphere is everything you'd expect from a college kids favorite in the middle of ASU campus, its centrally located, very affordable, open to 3:30 in the am including there delivery, decorated in asu sponsored posters and a massive collage of dollar bills designed by local frat's and sororities. The Good crowd is the most important part that makes this place a stopping ground for many always with waves of asu students coming through the door. This is the type of  place that will be there for many years to come. Try the cheesesteak on a pita if you go its all I've ordered for the past year its the bomb!"}
{"text":"I used to like their food a few years ago when the owners were @ but I went there tonight and ordered a Caesar salad with chicken and it was the worst salad I have ever ate ,the lettuce was old and saggy and the chicken tasted really bad!I will never be back"}
{"text":"I could literally swim in their hummus it is so delicious!!! All the food is home made by the most adorable Greek woman ever, everything is fresh and delicious and it takes almost no time to get your good after you order. I love eating here and it is so close to asu campus that it's hard not to come here once a week!"}
{"text":"-1 rating for the worn I found in my sandwich last night(look at the pic I posted).I was able to see it ,but some people ate it"}
{"text":"A good lunch place. Their pitas are good (except the falafel, it's very dry) and I also like the cheesesteaks. The place is clean, the service is fast, and the price is fair. Next time you're out late, keep this place in mind: it's open until 3am and there's a late night gyro special."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing and a inexpensive. We found this place through yelp, it was 9pm, we were starving, and had been studying so we wanted something quick. From the time I placed my order it took about 25 minutes for the food to be delivered. This place just became a staple for us."}
{"text":"Really liked their frys! I got the portebella cheesesteak. I added chipotle sauce to it. That was really good. Only thing I would change is the way they sliced the steak. They kinda shredded it. Would be much better if the steak was in bigger pieces"}
{"text":"Tried this place out for lunch. Ordered the chicken souvlaki plate ($12) and dined in. Within 3 minutes, the guy working the register brings out my food. Wow, that was fast. I barely sat down with my drink. The down side to this? The food was precooked and served cold.  I had the original hummus with this and it was amazing! Very flavorful. The chicken even had a great flavor, but it was room temperature, which is just asking for a food born illness. The chicken was also a little dry. The rice was cold and too dry, but it had good flavor.   I'm probably not going to eat here again because I don't want to get sick plus cold food is not appetizing when it's supposed to be hot. The second star is for the awesome hummus, I would eat that again."}
{"text":"I've only had the Philly cheesesteaks and I honestly loved it. I just tryed four fathers and it was better but this is still good!"}
{"text":"Their food is great for drunk munchies late at night! I love the greek fries, gyros, Cesar salad, and greek bruchetta. The bruchetta can be a little hit or miss, as sometimes it is way to salty, but overall I have enjoyed their food every time I order (which is quite frequently)"}
{"text":"They have a lot of different pitas and plates to choose from. If you're a vegetarian they have something for you too. If you've never tried this place I recommend asking the cashier for suggestions before you order.  They have a lunch special (11AM to 2PM) and you can get any type of pita with fries and a drink for cheap. If you're trying to eat healthy you can always swap out the fries with a nice salad for a little extra. I've been here a couple times and the place is kept very clean. Although they always run out of paper towels in the bathroom when I'm there."}
{"text":"This is by far THE BEST place to get this type of food in Tempe. The other Greek/Mediterranean places are all the same and sometimes their food is bland. Oliveo's cooks it right! The chicken bruchetta pita is amazing, and you can tell the cooks know what they're doing. They are so welcoming and even though the wait is a little, it's so worth it. It is delicious, savory and you'll be craving it every day!"}
{"text":"I like the falafel because its tasty and shaped differently than most. The hummus is good as well as the tzatziki but the tzatziki sauce was a little watery in consistency. The pita bread is more like store bought than fresh baked. The dolmades are awesome. The chipotle provolone was not good at all. But the baklava was amazing. Love the late night delivery!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery.... Gyro and chicken pita hardly had any tomatoes- \"ok\" for \"fast food\" gyros. We also ordered the Greek fries and they delivered plain fries with ketchup. They offered to bring us out the Greek fries which was nice, but they were nothing but gross, cold fries with a little feta and parm. Would have been happier with mcdonalds fries."}
{"text":"We used to love this place however the last several times the food has been sub par.  Tried to order tonight only to find out they no longer deliver and use Ubereats which never accepted the order or Amazon. Won't be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"What an AWESOME place to eat if you're craving something Greek or Mediterranean!  They have the best gyros and greek fries you'll find anywhere!  They are conveniently located close to the ASU campus and their prices are very reasonable.  The quality of their food surpasses their reasonable prices as a good reason to try this place."}
{"text":"This was the worst gyro platter I've had! The only reason to order from here is because they are open until 2am.  The gyro platter did NOT come with tomato or onion, the pita portion was 1/2 a pita cut into tiny slivers, we got 1 sauce, and the gyro was luke warm and clearly not off of a spiget (it was the frozen pre-cut kind... eww).  I typically order the gyro platter from George's Famous Gyro (Miller and McKellips) and the gyro is hot and fresh and there is enough meat, pita, sauce and sides to feed 3 people - for the same price!  Don't bother, this place is for college kids with late night munchies. period."}
{"text":"When got my food delivered to me last time I had a feel of sadness and regret after done eating. I do value my felling so I'm gonna  skip mediocrity and go somewhere else. It's jut not there taste, flavor,  hummos like sand. Oh my god how hard is it to make hummos. They do open late though and that where the xtra star comes inn."}
{"text":"Ok here's the deal from a college student who has been coming to oliveo since they have been opened and a connoisseur of Mediterranean and greek foods. This is not your typical traditional greek restaurant. It has a classic original greek style that makes every meal there awesome. Here are some of the meals i like to get that may or may not be on the meau but im sure they would be happy to make:  Chicken: Ceasar pita or/ Bruschetta pita with fries  Chicken soulvaki/breast plate greek salad with brown rice  Penne pasta half alfredo sauce half pesto sauce (add ckn and gyro)  Hummus is excellent but then again everything is great on the menu and is worth a try. Worth the money and worth the wait if you come at lunch hour i give it a 10/10."}
{"text":"This place is awesome and the employees are so friendly!  I can't say enough about them and the delicious food.  I am a regular here now along with the others in my office and we LOVE the Gyro and Greek fries!!  YUMMO!!  We love you Oliveo Grill..."}
{"text":"I couldn't finish my meal, it was awful. The meat was dry, the sauce was bitter, and the food over all was very oily. I tried the Greek fries, which was a terrible idea. Soggy, cold, and terrible. The feta cheese was even bad, which is pretty difficult to accomplish. I wouldn't recommend this place to my enemies."}
{"text":"Total college dive but really solid food. Check out the hummus for sure."}
{"text":"Flew in from Seattle, Wa got into my hotel around 11:00pm and jumped on Uber eats. Food was delivered quick and I was SO surprised!!! I was. It expecting the food to be so good! The chicken souvlaki  with the wild rice  & tiramisu is what I ordered. My friend ordered the roasted red bell pepper humans, all of it was to die for!! When I pass back threw, I will be coming to you guys!"}
{"text":"I'd be happy if pitas were a tad bit cheaper but overall great place to get a bite and they're open late too. The falafel pita is good and their fries are decent. I'll get around to trying more stuff eventually 'cause it is definitely a place to go more than once. Ample seating inside and the person running the cashier has always been friendly and fast about taking orders and giving generally fast service. The only reason I don't go here more often is 'cause Oliveo Pizza has drawn my attention. More of a pizza fan than a pita fan, what can I say?  Oh yeah, it has TV and it's close to ASU."}
{"text":"They left a flyer on my door, so I thought I would give them a try. Not that great at all, I have to wonder if these recipes are even from Greek people. I ordered the tabouleh salad which had no parsley and was nothing but cracked wheat. The pita bread was fresh and they gave us a lot of tzatziki, so that was good. The classic gyro was alright but they do skimp on the meat, and after having George's Gyros off of McKellips, there is no comparison.  I'll stay at Pita Jungle for now, like others have said on here, cheap, late night after drinking food, as a maybe, and that's a big maybe at best."}
{"text":"Currently I've been waiting for my food for 45 minutes and it's dead. This will definitely be the last time I spend my money here. Take your business elsewhere. The food and service is nothing to get excited over."}
{"text":"Sad, we frequent here at least once a week if not more. This evening we went in ordered the exact same thing we always order and after having the guy behind the counter eating his own food while taking our order, charge us $32 when our bill is normally $25.90 (we have receipts to prove). A whopping six dollar difference for the exact same food. Not sure if they have raised their prices because of the college kids getting back to school but $6.00 is a big difference. Unfortunately we won't be brining any business there again...so disappointed."}
{"text":"Great pitas and Greek fries!   They deliver!"}
{"text":"Placed late night order on 10/8 for delivery which was never received. Have gone into the location twice for help getting a refund. Only the owner can process refunds from their online ordering system. Second time in, employee gave me the cell number for the owner. As of today, the number is shut off and not taking calls. Not sure if he disconnected the number or blocked mine, but still no refund. Have now had to dispute the charge through my credit card."}
{"text":"It's either a really good or bad thing when I feel I have to turn to Yelp IMMEDIATELY after eating somewhere..... I just ate there like literally 10 minutes ago and I could see how this would appeal to the masses that have given this place a decent rating, however, this place? Typical college town business that skimps on portion size but most college students won't care because they're usual starving college students. But I can name numerous places that serve more on a plate of hummus than this hole in the wall!   Their plates are $9.75 a piece and light in weight to say the least. Both the red bell pepper hummus and jalepeno hummus were lacking flavor (and not spicy) and the meat was dry as hell. Rice was undercooked. Baklava was old and soggy and lacking that crunchiness and nuttiness that true baklava is known for.   I will not be returning here for a Greek fix. There's no point. No value. No flavor. And definitely not authentic.  If you want Greek, PITA JUNGLE, MEDITERRANEAN GRILL OR FLAMING KABOB is where its at (and cheaper).   POST 1 HOUR UPDATE: I just got home and had to yack it all. I am officially sick off of this food."}
{"text":"I went here after a long study session so I was really hungry. I ordered the gyro plate with greek fries and chipotle hummus as my sides. Also, ordered falafel as a starter. I thought the falafel was overpriced, since it cost $5+ tax for 5 little sticks. They weren't even molded like balls. The gyro meat was dry but the sides were great! It was filling so hence the 3 stars. The girl and boy who took my order were really sweet and helpful in recommending food for me. Kudos for great customer service!  Apart from the food, their music selection is amazing."}
{"text":"The only reason I keep going back is I live 5 minutes walk away and they keep on putting generous coupons in the New Times.  Pita sandwiches are ok. They skimp on the meat. I always get lamb souvlaki because they're all priced the same. Fries are lackluster.  Don't get the falafel!! I don't know what freezer bag brand this is, but it is not pleasant. Instead of balls, they're like little finger/nuggets with a really thick crust. They're really dense and really salty. The hummus that came with the falafel appetizer was disappointing also.   There are so many better options for mediterranean food in the area. Haji Baba, Pita Jungle, Munchies. But when I'm too lazy to cook, and I can get a sandwich/fries/drink combo for $5, it does get tempting."}
{"text":"Horrible service and food. Pita sauce was bland , chicken was dry and lettuce was bitter. There was also no hospitality . The cashier was monotone and not friendly."}
{"text":"I've been here for lunch twice and Oliveo lives up to its expectations as an inexpensive fast food style pita restaurant that caters to the college crowd.  I've had a greek salad with gyros that was generally flavorful, but just of average quality across the board.  On my second visit, I ordered the portobello mushroom pita with a greek side salad.  The girl behind the counter let me stand there for almost ten minutes while she took a phone order from someone who could not figure out what they wanted and then when she finally did take my order was rude and seemed put out to have to do so, typical of restaurants of this caliber located in the ASU area.   My food arrived on two separate plates which at first seemed puzzling.  After the first bite of my pita, I realized why.  The portobello mushroom was of average quality and had decent flavor as did the pesto that was included, and the wheat pita itself was fresh and of good quality.  What I wasn't expecting, though, was the absolute geyser of liquid that shot out the end of the pita that I bit into and sprayed all over my face.  Similarly, the other end of the pita (the whole thing was wrapped in foil) was gushing liquid as if someone had managed to hide a garden hose somewhere in my pita and had stealthily turned it on as a joke.  By the time I was done eating, I'd gone through an entire stack of napkins and my plate was filled to the point of nearly overflowing with liquid. I could barely manage to carry it to the bus tub where customers are supposed to place their dirty dishes without it dripping onto the floor.  I still can't explain what all that juice was.  I love portobellos and make portobello burgers at home all the time and have never experienced anything remotely like that.  Be forewarned, if you're planning to try that item, I would suggest slipping on your rain poncho first."}
{"text":"The food is awesome but I give it two stars for the nightmare delivery is. It's dumb to have a $4 delivery charge for each order even if it's being delivered to the same place at the same time. Really bogus. A few of us at work ordered food for delivery in the same order but each of us had to pay the delivery charge. Wish they wouldn't do this. But the food is pretty tasty"}
{"text":"i had a couple beers and my bike was recently stolen, so i needed delivery. i shoud have just walked somewhere. this was not good. the falafel looked like little cat turds and didn't taste much better. the fries were ok, but c'mon, they're fries! if you're going to order, have more beers than i did. it might be better that way. they also charge a delivery fee and ask you to prepay tip."}
{"text":"Food is decent. I ordered online, they said it would be 50 minutes. I waited an hour and twenty minutes before I called them just to be told my order wasn't even out yet. They said it would be right over. Took another half hour and the food wasn't even that hot."}
{"text":"We typically order Oliveo's when we are sick of the food around our office on Mill Ave.   Today, I ordered the Cyprus salad with chicken. When I picked up my order and got back to my office - no chicken on my salad. When I called, they asked me if I would like to come and pick up a side of chicken after I waited quite a long time to receive my salad.   A bad lunch is worsened by bad customer service."}
{"text":"My favorite lunch time destination is Oliveo Grill!  You can't go wrong with the lunch special (gyro, fries and a drink).  Since I CRAVE the greek fries I upgrade my fries to include the feta and lemon sauce that makes them perfect!  The staff is always very friendly and the food is amazing!  Thanks Oliveo Grill!"}
{"text":"After seeing this place advertised in a New Times email I convinced my coworker to check it out with me for lunch today. The article on the New Times website said to mention the email and you would get a lunch special including pita, fries, and a drink for 4.99. What a deal! However, when I ordered and asked for the special, the girl at the register didn't know what I was talking about. She was going to ask the owner if the special was valid but he wasn't around. So she gave me the special for 5.99 rather than 6.44. If you want to use the New Times special, be sure to print the email and bring it with you! The food was better than average but not great. The gyro meat was flavorful and moist but there weren't heaping portions of meat. The fries were good and had the right amount of seasoning but seemed like they had been sitting out for a while. My coworker had the halloumi pita and loved the goat cheese. She tried the shieftalia and said it was good but she's had better at other Greek restaurants in the area. I would definitely try this place again but next time I'll remember to print out the coupon!"}
{"text":"What a disappointment, we ordered delivery the gyro plate with rice and salad for my husband and gyro with greek fries and red pepper hummus for me... All of which bland and cold...how can greek food be bland? I don't  know but oliveos sure found a way..never again."}
{"text":"5/5 every time. The food is ALWAYS fresh. I recommend them over any other Mediterranean restaurant and I have been to A LOT. The customer service is through the roof. I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE!!!! This brothel is a poor excuse for Greek food. The cooks don't wash their hands (had a friend that worked here) and they don't cook their chicken all the way through. I complained and brought up the pink-centered chicken and the imbecile scrub working at the cash register said it looked fine to him and if I want a new chicken breast I would have to pay. The chicken tastes like gum, please don't do it. Do yourself a favor and go to McDonald's, I am quite confident their ethical standards are higher than this shit hole."}
{"text":"I found a coupon on my windshield for a free pita sandwich so I went to the restaurant and got a chicken bruschetta pita and oh man it was so delicious. It was good enough for me to come back again the next night for two more, and I recently brought my family in to try the superb food. Also, the staff are nice and the atmosphere is very mellow. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. First off they weren't delivering for some reason so my office staff had to pick up which we normally do delivery. I ordered a plate and they forgot the pita, tzatziki, and the coke was completely flat. I called back and they said they would give me a freebee the next time I came in. Well that didn't happen. I guess the girl I ordered from got fired so they could not honor that anymore. It's crazy that they lost our offices business because of a couple of dollars. Never heard of anything so absurd. Cheap AF!"}
{"text":"Great place to grab a quick bite of food! Great options to eat healthy and they are open late"}
{"text":"Fantastic find! Maybe a bit pricier than some Greek competitors in the area, but absolutely worth it.  -laid back atmosphere -open late -fresh fresh!  -try the tabbouleh - best I've ever had! -generous portions"}
{"text":"Quality of service has gone down quite a bit in recent months. I used to be a multiple visit a week costumer but the last two pickup orders have had the wrong food, and was missing items."}
{"text":"Most DISRESPECTFUL staff I have ever encountered. After \"busting their balls\" for not tipping after ordering subpar takeout, I was BERATED by the cashier for not leaving a tip. WHY WOULD I TIP A CASHIER FOR TAKEOUT?? In return for not tipping, I was told by the cashier that he deserved the last word. WHAT.....????"}
{"text":"I came in for a quick lunch on Tuesday and really enjoyed it. I had the chicken souvlaki pita with a side of chipotle hummus. It said the lunch special came with fries, but they didn't charge me to switch it out, which was nice.   The pita was great-- fresh pita, moist chicken, perfect amount of sauce. The hummus was also very good and you get a ton of it, along with pita bread. Unfortunately, although I like it, the chipotle flavor didn't go with the chicken souvlaki. I think next time I would sub a salad."}
{"text":"I had a poor experience here tonight. Outside the restaurant was clearly posted signage of the day's specials, including a $6 gyro, fries and drink combo. I walked in and ordered, verbatim, \" a gyro sandwich combo\". I was overcharged for my meal, and paid $8.68. When I questioned and asked the cashier what I was paying for he confused me further by telling me that the combo is only the sandwich and fries. He tried giving me a small water cup, but ended up giving me a drink \"on the house\". He mentioned something about the management being crazy and not including drinks with anything...which is contrary to what is on both their online menu and the sign out front. This is clearly a communication/staff issue. Once I received my sandwich I was throughly disappointed at the skimpy amount of meat, no way worth almost $9. I emailed the contact on their webpage, so we will see how their customer service pans out. Also, can we note the incorrect spelling of 'pita' on the sign? Who the heck is running this place?"}
{"text":"Greek fries are meh... is that fetta? It's so finely crumbled, hard to tell.   The Tzatziki is not good. It's like a runny ranch dressing with pureed cucumbers, maybe? Not good.  The gyro meat is good!     Uber driver delivered quickly and was awesome!"}
{"text":"With mountains of biology research in front of me, and the boyfriend busy with his own research paper, we decided to order delivery from here since neither of us was willing to abandon our work to cook for an hour. After repeating our address three separate times during the ordering process, were told that our food would be there in about 35 minutes Well, we waited an hour and a half. They had given the driver the wrong address, and when we finally got our food it was soggy and room temperature. Next time I think we'll take that hour to cook instead."}
{"text":"I ordered 2 items with fries a drink for delivery and when the guy dropped it off half of the order was missing. He went to get the rest of what I paid for, leaving the cold food that he did have with us. It has been another hour and half and he still has not come back with the rest of my food. Very disappointed, definitely will never be eating here again and I would not recommend to anyone else."}
{"text":"I had no idea that it was possible to make Greek food have absolutely no flavor, but Oliveo Grill manages to do it. We ordered gyro plates and hummus for delivery. I had rice and salad while my wife had Greek fries and salad and we ordered the red pepper hummus. It took an hour to get our food and I should have realized we were probably in for a bad meal when the delivery driver kept apologizing. Not only was the food cold (something I don't mind dealing with when we get delivery) but it had no taste. The gyro meat tasted like it came straight from the freezer. It was rubbery and had zero spice. We had to drench it in sirarcha to make it palatable. The salad had a nice assortment of veggies but the salad dressing needs be put back in the bottle it came in and thrown out. The rice was cooked well but again had no flavor and my wife's French fries clearly tasted like they were also fresh from the freezer. The hummus was ok, definitely not homemade and the pita was your run of the mill Greek place pita. I cannot see us ever eating at Oliveos again, with all of the other Greek options in Tempe, I'm surprised this place has such a high rating."}
{"text":"Oliveo was my favorite place in college, but I have to say, it has never changed. Greek fries are heaven, and every dish delivers.   YUM"}
{"text":"Easily one of my favorite places to eat in tempe, I go here at least once a week if not more.  Good prices for college kids (especially the greek special) and super awesome food."}
{"text":"I'm sad to report that this place just lost a customer. I needed a late night dinner, so hit up their website to order online.  Ordering was fairly straight forward, though had no \"special instructions\" space, so I called them when I was on the way, to ask that they leave cheese and croutons off of my salad. I intentionally ordered regular french fries, because I can't eat cheese. My Classic Gyro Plate was coming out of the kitchen as I arrived. I got home to find my fries smothered in feta and parmesan, NO RICE at all, and a side Caesar salad (I paid an extra $2.69) that consisted of under 3 oz of chopped romaine lettuce (they left the cheese & croutons off that as asked, but what a rip-off).  I had been to this place before, and the food was OK, but this was a very disappointing experience, one I won't repeat. The place is run by college students who don't seem to care about customer service or accuracy, and their prices are higher than they should be. There are 4 other restaurants in the same shopping center, and 2 or 3 others within 200 feet.  Seriously, Munchies Cafe is way better!"}
{"text":"Open and deliver late. The food was average, however, the hours and price was right :)"}
{"text":"They changed owners, do not come food Different. Placed order to go and was not informed. They had no necessary ingredients. Horrible, won't be coming back."}
{"text":"They have great food and the greek fries are amazing but for some reason their lettuce every time I go there tastes and smells weird. Also their sodas from the machine are definitely knock off cuz they taste like hell."}
{"text":"My coworkers forced me to go here for lunch with them today... and by forced I mean that they just asked and I said yes.  Not bad.  Not good.  Must have been an off day? Or maybe all the five stars are from late night, fuzzy, drunken memories?  I can see myself loving this place after 50 cent beer night at Barney's.     The pita sandwiches were small compared with every other Greek restaurant I've been to.  They tasted fine, but definitely not close to amazing.  My coworker actually called her gyro a tomato sandwich because that was all she got for the first few bites.  She likes her meat and so was highly disappointed by the lack of it.  Ladies, nothing is worse than that, right?"}
{"text":"THIS IS MY NEW FAVORITE LATE NIGHT DELIVERY!!!!   I was sooo stoked to hear they deliver...until 3am. WOW! They have a late night special for $5- it's a gyro w fries from 11pm until 3am. it was super yummy. There is a $10 minimum delivery and everything is cheap and inexpensive. (just re-reading my review and wondering what the difference between cheap and inexpensive is? hehe) cheap and delicious***   so many late night delivery places are just nasty and blech. this one was super enjoyable.    I love you, oliveo. will you be my bff4l?"}
{"text":"Starving and lost in Tempe looking for urban Cafe. Stumbled into this strip mall and said FOOD! so I ordered a chix pita on whole wheat with a side of fries and a drink ($8)?? pita was eh. and fries were good. Wouldn't return. Very ASU hangout eatery."}
{"text":"I always order a lunch special, usually a chicken gyro and fries with taziki sauce. Everytime I go the food is cooked perfectly and I'm in love with the taziki. Fries are always crispy and season well and the gyro is just filling enough to make me feel like I ate light. Good pricing too."}
{"text":"They've stepped up their game as far as order times are concerned. Online ordering and menu items make this place a huge seller."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I can't say anything very interesting about this place.  It really is just \"A-Ok.\"  However, I do think the price point is a bit too high for what you get.  All things considered, I would rather trek over to the Phoenicia Cafe.  Although, I have found Phoenicia to be inconsistent with the quality of their food, when it is good, it is better than Oliveo and you get more bang for your buck."}
{"text":"From the service to the food, my entire experience was awful. My friend and I were greeted by 3 employees talking amongst themselves, one turned and asked us if we needed anything, this set the stage for some very awkward and off-putting dialogue while ordering.  The food was terrible and the resturant dirty. This is not how Greek food is supposed to be. My falafal was dry, hard, and cold. Hummus was runny and really salty.   I recommend Princess Deli and Market.  I am troubled that places like this remain in business. Avoid at all costs"}
{"text":"I remember trying this place a while back. The food was alright but they were renovating at the time so the space was cramped. I'm open to trying this place again because some of the items on the menu stood out but if you're feeling Mediterranean you should get the gyro plate from Haji Baba or the hummus/Greek fries from Phoenicia."}
{"text":"They got my order wrong 2 times and the employee made no effort to make it right. Unprofessional and rude. Definitely wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"I really like Oliveo's, the person working the register was really nice and chatty. I had the chicken cesar pita was delicious (grilled chicken, romaine lettuce, Caesar dressing and parmesan cheese). The pita came with fries and a drink. I had some sort of fruity unsweetened iced tea. The fries were crisp and hot and tasted fresh. The pita bread itself was meltingly soft and warm, coupled with copious amounts of grilled chicken breast, it was a nice filling meal. The prices here are very reasonable too.   The second time I came here I ordered pasta and tiramisu. I was not a massive fan of the pasta, I had it with marinara sauce and grilled chicken (the dish came with pita bread). I have to say their pita bread is out of this world! I found the pasta to be overcooked and mushy and the sauce didn't have much flavor. That's the only bit of advice I would give them is to cook the pasta a little less and maybe add some salt and sugar to the sauce, and add a little more sauce. The tiramisu was delicious, however it was a little frozen in the middle, not a big deal but I'd prefer that it wasn't. Would I come back? Yes!"}
{"text":"Sorry bro' this place was just not that great, at least not when I was sober.   I had the falafel pita and my friend had a gyro, My falafel was dry, and lacked the great crunch and flavor I have had else where, there as hardly any tahini in the pita (which really was peta) and it could have used a few more options to dress it up. The only condiment they have is a franks red hot style vinegary hot sauce that does not match the food.   My friends was just \"eh\" according to him, His meal came with a side of hummus which I did try. The humus was not the smoothest or the most flavourful it was also \"eh I have had better\" much better actually.  The wall is covered in dollar bills with slogans from the fraternities on near by new row, and that is who I think this place appeals to at 1am after copious amounts of drinking."}
{"text":"This place is so good! I always get the chicken bruschetta pita with Greek fries and it is one of my favorite meals to get when I come to the valley. There's never to long of a wait and delivery is fast too! Usually within 30 minutes. I recommend this place if you're looking for yummy food that isn't unhealthy!"}
{"text":"When I first saw their hours of operation I thought it was a mistake and they meant to write p.m., instead of a.m., but now that I have eaten there twice it makes more sense. When nothing else is open, and you're wasted, I'm sure this place ROCKS!"}
{"text":"I ordered the greek salad with chicken falafel on top.  The dressing and salad was good, but the chicken was cold and dry.  It had the texture of dog food.  My roommate and all his buddies always get delivery late night from oliveo's, but after seeing my chicken falafel we are all on the edge about ever eating here again."}
{"text":"For what it is, this place is awesome. It's tasty, fast, and a super decent price. I'm basing this review off of 4 visits, every time trying something different. I have yet to be disappointed. My boyfriend lives just down the street a bit. We both love this place. It's a staple in our late-night-we're-too-tired-to-cook routine, and it's going to stay there."}
{"text":"I am totally happy this is in my neighborhood. This is now my go to place for a quick bite as everything I've had has been very tasty and fresh.   Of note is the chicken bruschetta sandwich. Misnamed in its way, the pita sandwich is loaded with pesto and veggies, really nice, hearty yet not overly heavy.   Next time I'm going to expand my ordering a bit. Very confident they won't disappoint."}
{"text":"Great place with quick service, super late delivery, and vegetarian friendly. The Halloumi goat cheese pita is awesome, so are the greek fries. A great place for carry-out or drunk munchies alike."}
{"text":"Oliveo was formally Cyprus Pita Grill, the owners relocated directly across the street under a different name. I would strongly suggest the Chicken breast plate, it comes with Rice, your choice of Greek or Ceasar salad, pita bread and tzatziki sauce to dip for $8.99. The main thing that attracts me to Oliveo is that they deliver until 3:30 am!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for a while. Better prices and sandwiches than everyone else in the plaza..great late night, fast and friendly service. This last time my fries were cold, the cook had no problem coming out to the counter and fixing it personally. Chipolte cheesesteak with Greek fries for life!"}
{"text":"Being from Chicago and also being Greek, this place did not live up to my standards.  Gyro tasted like canned meet.  Their fries were cold and mush.  I will never go back... Nor do I recommend anyone try it.  Yuck!"}
{"text":"I eat Greek food a lot. A LOT. I've eaten at places all across the valley. I had heard good things about Oliveo Grill so I decided to give it a shot tonight. I ordered online and went to pick it up within 20 minutes. Nobody greeted me when I entered, and I was ignored for a couple minutes before someone finally came up front to assist me. Then the girl seemed confused about my order.   I would have forgiven that, had the food been good. It was cold. The greek fries were meh. Edible at best. I've had better. My chicken pita was edible, but not much flavor to it. My husband had a cheesesteak sandwich, and said it was the worst he's ever had.   I can get twice as much food for around the same price at Mika's Greek. Their food is great, has never been cold, and has amazing flavor. Their staff is also super friendly and attentive. I will not ever return to Oliveo Grill."}
{"text":"I don't know how long this place has been here but I'm glad I have found it now! They do take out and delivery till 330am which is rad for the bar crowd. I have usually do delivery which is super fast. I've been inside once...its like a sauna in there! They are really well priced. Dont let the ghetto look of the plaza detour you from trying this place out"}
{"text":"This place would get five stars if I were 21 and drunk at 2:30am on a Saturday night.  Unfortunately for OG neither point factors into this review.   The food would repulse a real Greek person.  The fries were a saving grace."}
{"text":"My co-workers, friends, and I always go to Oliveo's for lunch. We love their classic gyros lunch special. My co-worker always substitutes her fries for hummus and a pita for a healthier option. It's more of a hole in a wall place, and you're not going to get an attentive waitress cause the drinks are self-serve. However,  the service is quick and the prices are reasonable. This place kicks Pita Jungles butt!"}
{"text":"We just ordered some delivery. Souvlaki chicken plate....chicken is good, but doesn't compare to the stuff from back east. Wild rice had a nice lemon flavor but was way mushy and overcooked. Falafel \"sticks,\" while novel, were really dry. Hummus was obviously homemade, but grainy. This is probably from using canned beans instead of cooking dry beans. Also too much black pepper. The tabbouleh was really bad, pale vegetables ( like zero parsley) and mostly larger bulgur grains. I'm used to parsley, tomato mint lemon and olive oil ( occasionally cucumber), this had tomato, green bell pepper and celery, and lacked acidity. I feel bad writing a bad review, but if a pregnant lady doesn't want to finish her food..... The chicken wasn't bad, so maybe sticking to the sandwiches is a better option."}
{"text":"the wooooooooooooooorst restaurant evvvvveeeeer!!!!! NASTY NASTY NASTY food. i found small bugs inside the pita for my first time i ate there and second time there was a small bug comes out between the fries. and at that time they was playing dead so they don't refund us. after complaining they just refund us 50% of what we paid. it's not even a restaurant!! no good food, rude staff and nasty food!!!! Im not going to eat there again. wooooooooorst experience!!! if there is minus 5 stars i will defiantly giving them!!!"}
{"text":"we had a change of plans that put us right by oliveo's. impressed and left feeling very full. started with the tzezeki (sp) app and greek fries, which were deliciously salty and cruchy. then i had the portobello gyro which was good. my gal had the falafel gyro which was better.   service was quick and no-nonsense and the price was oh so nice. my gal is greek and loved their shirts that said \"greekalicious\". she asked to buy one, but they didn't sell them. so the girl at the front asked her manager and he gave her one from the employee stash! how cool!"}
{"text":"Good value and friendly service.  All you can really ask for at this price point in a joint that resembles a Subway on the inside (minus the overwhelming wall paper).    Owner (or who I presumed to be the owner) was very nice and called me out for what I was...clearly not a student in a student heavy joint.  Guess ASU is teaching the kids something - like where to get decent grub at a decent price."}
{"text":"Olivios Grill doesn't really care about the quality of their ingredients however they do offer a very affordable variety of Mediterranean food.  Every time I come here I never really feel like the service cares whether or not I'm there however the consistency is decent. They could do a better job of cleaning up the dining area and also trying to act like they care that their customers want to be there."}
{"text":"I have been eating at oliveo's for the past 3 years. The quality and taste of the food has been decreasing over time. There are plenty of other places that have better gyros, steak sandwiches, and Greek fries.  Delivery is always cold and the food doesn't have flavor. I will never order from here again.."}
{"text":"I was an employee here over the summer, and there are so many issues with this place. First off, the quality of food product is very cheap and bad, and a lot of items are premade or frozen and then thrown in the microwave. The POS system is outdated and taking orders was a hassle, which obviously frustrated customers. The decor is ugly and no one gives a shit to change it. It's always way too hot inside bc the A/C doesn't work. I got the stomach flu and told my boss I would come back as soon as I felt better again, and then he goes and hires more people behind my back and won't let me come back to work. I'm almost positive I got the stomach flu from the food here too! You couldn't just get the current employees to cover a few shifts? I feel like everyone who works here has given up and is just going thru the motions. Drunk frat kids are the only reason this place is still open, and I regret ever working here. This place needs a remodel, better quality food products, better employees who actually care (which I did), and a menu overhaul bc half the items no one ever ordered! My boss never listened to any of my ideas to change the place and it won't be around much longer the way it's operating now."}
{"text":"I honestly can't say enough about Oliveo's. Whether it's the pizza place or the grill, I love their food. Friendly customer service.   Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Pro: Food is good when it's hot. Recommend dining in or pick up ONLY.  Cons: Have ordered delivery five times. Three out of five my food has arrived cold and/or late (once it was 30 mins in addition to the 45 mins that was estimated). The female manager is not professional, wish I cared to have remembered her name. Once they offered to replace my order but I had waited so long that I didn't want to wait again. Used a coupon to get a free drink and they forgot my drink. Have spoke to management several times about my issues and have never felt like my issues were resolved. Was told a manager would contact me, they never called. After having three strikes with this company I will NEVER order from them again. Not because their food is bad but because they have TERRIBLE customer service. It's a bummer because I really do enjoy their food when it's fresh and they are only two miles from my home. I much rather drive 15 mins to a competitor than give them my business."}
{"text":"Oliveo's is a good place to get decent food, whether it's late night or lunchtime. They are slightly pricey, at least to me, but it is Greek food. I have never gotten a bad dish from them. I've had the chicken souvlaki, gyros and chicken breast plates. All are great, cooked well and have lots of flavor. The bonus is that Oliveo's is open extremely late, so they are usually my go to if I want late night food that isn't McDonald's. I recommend if you want healthy in a college town!"}
{"text":"I love Oliveo Grill! I always come for lunch or very late at night. I love that they are open so late- great for students. Despite the usually rowdy crowd that dines after midnight, the employees are always friendly and composed. I always love a good chicken caesar pita and the greek fries are my favorite late night eat.  Sign up for the email list!- you get a free pita and they hardly ever send out emails anyway. I've probably gotten three emails in the past 8 months, and one of them was a free birthday pita!"}
{"text":"Food is alright for a late night place. Chicken and gyro meat was a bit on the dry side. The falafels were cleverly-designed, elongated chickpea logs. This makes them easier to eat and more whimsical than traditional falafels. The service was polite and friendly. My primary complaint is the clientele. For dine in 2 stars, carry out 3."}
{"text":"I don't know what kind of crack these reviewers must be on but let me have some. This place is so awful I came straight home just so I could yelp about it, and not in a good way. I like that it's open really late but it's like we said on the ride home, \"Hey now we know where to come and eat really crappy food late at night.\" We stumbled onto this place because Pete's was closed by the time we got down here. My falafel was dry and crumbly and the pita was like something you get out of a bag at the store.   The Greek fries were a joke, cold and soggy with not very flavorful Parmesan cheese on it. My partners Lamb Souvlaki plate came with rice that was entirely  void of flavor and didn't look that good to begin with. The waiter brought the wrong order to the table and I saw other people getting up to see where their order was. Do yourself a favor and stay away"}
{"text":"I have been coming to Oliveo Grill for about 4 years now. I love their lamb souvlaki pita. Everything tastes fresh.  Such a plus you can get it delivered late night! Beware though, if you order in the last two hours of them being open, you're going back to be waiting for a bit.   My biggest problem with Oliveo is that they don't have Mediterranean pickles :( it makes me very sad. There's just something missing from a pita without them."}
{"text":"Oliveo is really very good! I am in town on business, the hotel recommended them for delivery and I was pleasantly surprised. The chicken souvlaki was moist, well flavored and the jalapeño hummus was great! An added bonus is the price and the fact they deliver! I wish we had a similar place close to home."}
{"text":"I use to love this place!!   Unfortunately, they are in the process of shutting down and are no longer using the same ingredients. Specifically, their Greek fries have changed to a thick cut steak fry. The change affected the overall flavor.   They no longer offer delivery service.   They no longer load the pitas with cucumber and tomato.   So sad to see this place go :("}
{"text":"I love coming here after the bars. It is open late and their Greek fries are to die for!!! I've been coming here for quite sometime and every time I've been here my food has been fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"It's a lot better than your regular fast food joint like McDonald's or taco Bell,  that's for sure. If you want good food late at night,  it's a great option.  Delivery had an hour wait late Saturday night though,  but I guess that's to be expected. Had some serious indigestion the next day... Not sure if that was from the Greek fries or the mushroom pita."}
{"text":"Love this place! Whenever I'm at ASU and need my quick Greek fix, I stop in here. Love, love, love their stuffed grape leaves/dolmades! Their plate meals are pretty delish too! If you're in Greek life you also get a discount, holla!"}
{"text":"Solid three stars.  I have ordered lunch from here (take-out) several times. It's a reasonably priced lunch for the area - you're hard-pressed to find a decent $7ish lunch (pita, fries, AND drink) on or around the ASU campus, especially for a filling and balanced vegetarian meal. I really don't ever expect much for takeout, so maybe that sets the bar for Oliveo.  I always get the lunch special, which is pita, fries, and drink, and I always upgrade to Greek fries. For me, that's probably what keeps me coming back to Oliveo. These are my perfect vision of Greek fries: thin-cut, lemon tahini sauce, feta, parmesan, and oregano.   For pitas, I've had the Portobello, Haloumi, and Falafel pitas, and the only of the three I would not order again is the Falafel. Really not very good - super dry, kind of tasteless... But, doused in hot sauce, it was ok. Go next door to Tsom if you get Falafel; they make it pretty tasty and quick."}
{"text":"Generous portions for the prices! WARNING: The greek fries are mmmazing! Mozzarella and feta with splash of lime over fries, wow. It's hard to stop eating them. I resisted for a full 5 min before I gave in and started to devour them like I hadn't eaten in weeks. Diet? What diet?"}
{"text":"5 stars with service, food quality, and speedy delivery. Can't get enough of the chicken bruschetta and Greek fries, YUM!"}
{"text":"This place is    I always start with the pita chips and classic or red pepper hummus, or both. They give you a decent amount of hummus and the pita bread is really delicious and soft. It's more like pita bread.   Chipotle provolone is where it's at! I substitute steak with chicken and go light on the onions and it's perfect. It comes with green peppers that are always the perfect amount of crispy and cooked. They spread chipotle mayo on it as well. I always get extra to dip my fries in which are insanely good!   They have a fridge with az ice tea in it which is amazing. Other bottled beverages as wel and a side fountain. They til super late deliver too.   Everyone that works there are really nice and the food doesn't take long at all. It's also really cheap for how great it tastes! 5 stars all around!"}
{"text":"My basis of comparison for Greek is the quality of the gyro meat, the souvlaki, and the greek fries - and how they measure up to the other establishments that offer the same.  So, the quality of the meat is just a-ok.  Nothing to write home about, nothing to complain about.  The lamb souvlaki was a great disappointment, as the skewered meat was very dry and likened the taste of a large slab of beef that has been simmering in a slow cooker for weeks.  However, the accompanying tzaziki and pesto-esque sauces helped to revive the otherise cadaverous meat.  The gyro, and I have to assume that the meat was the usual combination of lamb and beef, was easy on the palate, just the right mixture of meat and salad, doused in tzaziki, and wedged in a pita - but meat was also dry and lackluster.  Now to the fries, the sweetest after hours indulgence when you have been swilling beers and shots all night.  This heaping plate of thin and crispy pommes frites is loaded with copious amounts of feta, lemon, and olive oil.  It's missing two key ingredients which \"My Big Fat Greek\" delivers: fresh garlic and herbs!  Well, this is not a fresh kind of place at all.  It is like most Yelpers have attested.  The kind of place that is amazing at 3a when you can't even think straight, much less discern what is good and bad with not only your taste buds, but also your judgement.  Prices are a big hit, and appeal to the college crowd, as the average bite here is $5, and there appear to be rotating specials that get you a complete meal for under $10.  Staff looks to be between high school and college age.  Not overly friendly, not overly impressed with the girl at the register showing her coworkers this cool new App she found on her iphone while we are giving her our order.  However, the restaurant is clean and inviting with its photographs of greek architecture, landscape, and people.  Overall, when compared to the slew of other greek and mediterranean restaurants in the city - and even down the street - this place surely disappoints and does not \"meat\" expectations."}
{"text":"Horrible delivery experience with this place. Don't have a car so I wanted delivery. These people left a menu on my door so I thought I'd try it. So I went on what they call their website, which is not very well put together. But what do I care? I'm just hungry. I make my order at 10:45, and I get a call after 12 about how the driver couldn't my apartment and he went back. So they remake my order so they say and deliver it at 1:30. When I got the food, it wasn't fresh at all as I expected, even though when I called back they said it would be fresh when it got here. Never ordering from there again. Horrible. The fact that they put their menu on my door just frustrates me."}
{"text":"We were running out of options for a late night dinner and we happened to find this place open till late, which is a good point. We ordered falafel for starters and lamb souvlaki plate and chicken souvlaki plate both with brown rice. Falafel was really good with hummus my one star is for the starters. I was really really disappointed with the plate of plain brown rice which was half cooked. I don't know if any one can eat undercooked brown rice which is jus so bland. Lamb and chicken was cooked to perfection and one star goes to that. I would like to make a suggestion that pls have a curry or some element in Rice, try to make it more authentic for a Mediterranean. Would love to see the change and rerate my review."}
{"text":"Ordered the pesto pasta to go & it was pretty amazing!!! It came with six slices of pita bread on top & plenty of pesto sauce... Which is important!!!! My boyfriend ordered a chicken pita & inhaled it in two breaths so I think he liked it too ;)"}
{"text":"The most filling and delicious pasta I ever get . I get the chicken penne pasta with pesto and add spinach . 9$ I eat like a king. Great establishment and nice people ."}
{"text":"Employees are horrible. Food is great.  The people that work here are the rudest of any place I have ever been. I'm not sure why or how the owner trusts these people to run their business. I always see them giving out free food/drinks to friends or fraternity brothers of other employees.   People everywhere are looking for jobs, why employ these people when you can hire hardworking, honest people for the same pay??  I'm sorry the food is great but it does not outweigh the atmosphere these employees give off at all."}
{"text":"Pita on a budget! hahah so don't expect more elaborated gyros! I tried the lamb one and taste was good, plus at ASU you can find a deal card, so fries and beverage was included in the final price. Place is ok, but not sure if I would really like to sit there, while hearing meaningless college conversations."}
{"text":"I really love this place. It's small, it's clean, and it's delicious. The prices are very reasonable and you can find their coupons EVERYWHERE (at least in all of the local coupon books) My favorite is the buffalo chicken pita or the falafel and hummus. Whatever that lemon sauce is, I could eat a bucket of it. It is SO good. Their delivery is always within a reasonable time, and they deliver very late! Love love this place. Actually, I want to go there for lunch right now!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and I love the college vibe. It's never changed and the food never fails."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years and oliveos is by far, my favorite takeout!! One night, I decided to get something different and got the chipotle provolone cheesesteak, which was just as great as their Greek options. The fries do get soggy if you don't eat them right away so I never order them if I'm getting delivery. But all in all, oliveos has great food and a great staff!"}
{"text":"Good food, overpriced, relatively consistent. Their gyro's are awesome. Nothing I'd rave about. There are better gyro's for cheaper in Tempe. Only reason I go here on occasion is because they're open late and it's better than Gus's."}
{"text":"I used to love this place! It had such a fun college feel and had great food and decent prices. Well it's safe to say that I will never be coming back here after what I experienced tonight. We called in an order after getting home late from work and decided to pick something quick and easy. Well when we got there we found out that they only accepted cash, no one bothered to tell us this on the phone and I just ran out the door with my card. So we went to the nearest ATM and had to pay a nice ATM fee. Then when we got back to oliveos we expected to just pay and pick up our order since by then it had already been thirty minutes. But OH NO they hadn't even rung it in yet, it took them an hour later to get our food to us! I asked what was taking so long and he said they had to reheat the meat(so like microwave it?! It's not fresh?!) it wasn't until and hour and a half after we called that we received our order and it was surprisingly wrong and not that great.  They also took down all the dollars that made this fee like an actual college place. Stupid."}
{"text":"They have finally gone out of business. It was a nice time Oliveos, but your time was up."}
{"text":"This place is good for the price you pay... They serve tasty greek / Mediterranean food and are open till 3 am except sundays. They deliver too!!! The chicken breast pita is good, greek fries, and hummus are among my favorites. The pasta dishes are also good, try the pesto sauce..."}
{"text":"Prices aren't bad and the lunch special was great.  Decent falafel pita with fries.  You must try the Greek dries as well, smothered in feta!  Yum!"}
{"text":"Just got some bomb.com pasta. The man that greeted us was so nice even though was the only one working. (Taking orders and cooking) I can tell he's very passionate about cooking and what he does cause he was show casing the beautifully decorated pasta! Definitely coming back for more."}
{"text":"I am writing this negative review with the hopes they will start to get back to where they were when the place opened. I used to be a regular customer, and enjoyed their food frequently. I ordered last night and the chicken souvlaki (skewer) actually had splintered wood in it. The chicken breast from another entree I ordered was so dry I couldn't even eat it (and I was starving) after drowning it in sauce. It seemed old. The rice was undercooked. The Bruchetta was so soggy it tasted like it was stored in a water tank. I don't see myself ordering from them again, and it's a shame because they used to produce good quality, healthy food...but have just gone way downhill."}
{"text":"I have been a long time costumer for both Oliveos and Salut. Taso has won my customer loyalty countless of times in the past. As of currently, I have been debating for some time whether I was finished with one of my favorite restaurants. I received an email from Taso apologizing for recent circumstances. I was excited all day to try, what I thought to be, improved standards. I was sadly mistaken from the first encounter with the woman working the register. \"Tay\" quickly began our transaction in an impatient and unwelcoming manner. After a very confusing transaction, more failure of communication on her part, we were overcharged for our meal. After the first interaction with \"Tay\", I was not driven to create another.  Once we received our food, after it was forcefully placed on the table / without acknowledging us / without saying \"you're welcome\" after we thanked her, BOTH THE PITAS WERE COLD. When I asked for our food to be heated up, she replied as if she's heard such complaint one too many times. I'm sorry, Taso but this time really did it for me :( My business will still remain at Salut but I am done with Oliveos.   A new kitchen staff, new in store management, and adequately trained employees will be a virtue to the survival of this restaurant. I know you've (Taso) changed out the register people and they are blamed more frequently. But, when my food has been cold, filled with fatty meats, and wilted condiments there are more than just the front of house to be blamed."}
{"text":"I been here a couple of times and it never disappoints. I always get the chicken buffalo chicken pita. It comes with lettuce, tomatoes, tiziki sauce with cucumbers bits, grilled chicken with buffalo sauce wrapped in a pita. Plus a side of crispy French fries. I get the lunch special when I go I think its between 11am-2pm any pita combo with fries or salad and a drink for $6.99. The place us pretty clean each time I have gone."}
{"text":"A-OK describes the gyro to a 'T'. We ordered four of their lunch specials (sandwich, fries, drink for $6.99) and had them delivered. A great deal! Delivery was reasonable. I would recommend this place for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"We love ordering delivery from Oliveo's when we're feeling a bit lazy. I'm a huge fan of the Greek salads and falafel pita, plus it's great to have a healthier delivery option."}
{"text":"Cheap, open late, and quite tasty.  Need I say more? : )"}
{"text":"The food here is so good. The only problem is that delivery takes 2 hours which seems unreasonable because they're so close."}
{"text":"I like that they are open late but I wasn't impressed with the food.  There are so many options for this kind of food that you have to stand out.  Flaming Kabob for example has much tastier plates----although I think they close at 11:30pm..."}
{"text":"It has become a tradition among my group of friends to bring the uninitiated down to Oliveo's for a gyro, and I'm not complaining at all. We typically come at lunch and we have a great selection of Greek food to try (I always opt for the falafel though). It's a pretty relaxed spot that I have never seen get very busy, and the wall of decorated dollar bills definitely reminds you that you are in a college town.   Recommendation: get the Greek fries. Always. You'll thank me later."}
{"text":"I would give the food 3 stars, but the fact that they deliver with very flexible hours they get a one star promotion.  If I am looking to dine, there are many other Greek places I will go to first.  However when I don't feel like facing the world and want to order delivery this is my place.  Plus, they will always have a special place in my heart as they provided me with many meals back in my college days."}
{"text":"This used to be my go-to late night spot back when I was in ASU, stayed up til dawn, and slept in til noon just cause I could.  College me baffles present me sometimes.  A lot.  I always get the plate cause it will fill you up - I recommend hummus as your side, and always, always switch out the rice for something else, like Greek fries.  Delicious?  Yes.  Carb overload?  Yes, though my post-college metabolism doesn't take to it so well anymore.  Lamb souvlaki, chicken souvlaki, classic gyro, you can't go wrong with any of them so go with whatever you're feeling for the day.  Sadly, I'm rounding down my 3.5 star review down to 3 because of the fruit flies.  We stopped by recently and the place was the same as it always was just with way too many fruit flies hovering as we ate.  Please leave me and my precious lamb souvlaki, bell pepper hummus, and greek fries alone, dammit, don't land on my drink either!  I wish had I got it to-go.  PS.  They're running a Groupon right now on two plates, so grab a friend, and get some Oliveo's to-go!"}
{"text":"Oliveo has made a name for itself as one of ASU's go-to fast food Greek/Mediterranean joints. Decent food, decent fries, nothing out of the ordinary. The classic gyro is good and they have a special between 11p and 3:30p for a $5 gyro pita and fries combo.  Oliveo is good for a snack or a quick meal as it is a very casually run restaurant employed by mostly frat guys and sorority chicks. Due to this, service is pretty hit or miss with the high employee turnover but I'm usually just carrying out so it's whatever. One time, I ordered delivery and the driver was spouting off about how far we were from the restaurant and how much of a pain it was to get there--I was living down the street 1 mile on University at the time...  Biggest thing that is holding me back from a better review is Oliveo charging so much for Tzatziki sauce. That is just bullshit, I understand that it costs money but you have to take a hit on some items at your restaurant like SAUCE (raise the price of your drinks from 1.85 to like 2.50 or something to make for up). Extra for the pita bread, hummus, or feta I can maybe understand but c'mon. Luckily, some of the employees agree with me on this and hook it up."}
{"text":"So this place used to be awesome! Great food late night, but last two times I went was very disappointing. Last Time I my Spartan cheesesteak wasn't nearly as good as it normally had been less meat, figured maybe they were having an off night.. went there again today and there was even less meat. now the sandwich has probably one third of the meat that it used to have and it's all chopped up and drowned in cheese and onions to make it look like there's more... For nine dollars you think you'd be full and have left over but not here anymore! Would have given them one star, but they were nice enough to give me a refund even though I didn't even eat one bite of my sandwich so they get two stars because their customer service was OK. There was no manager on duty and the kid working at the register had to text the manager to find out if it was OK... i have been a. Customer for the last 10 yr, and let's just say they lost a customer for good, I'll never go back there."}
{"text":"RUDE, RUDE, RUDE!!! ONLY GO HERE IF YOU ENJOY BEING SWEARED AT.  My review of this place is poor because this is the worst service and quite frankly, the rudest that I've ever been treated. I called to order a delivery dinner on a week night evening (and no, it wasn't super late, it was around 7pm). I spoke to someone who had a snotty attitude towards me, and told me that it would cost me a $5 delivery charge. I asked why, because according to the flyer that I received I was within the delivery area and that it was only $1.50. He refused to answer me until i asked for the third time, and then he told me that it was because they only had one driver. I asked why it would cost me extra to have something delivered when I am in the delivery area just because they only had one driver. His response was (and I quote) \"Take it or get the hell off my phone.\" I was so shocked that all I could do was hang up. I've encountered some dissatisfying service, but I have NEVER been sworn at while trying to GIVE someone my money. I will NEVER eat at this place again, and I also work at ASU and have warned all of my coworkers about this. We tend to eat out a lot around the area to support local business, but NONE of us will EVER go here again."}
{"text":"Small and clean, tasty food, close to ASU, good portion size. The 4th star is because hockey was on the tv when I ate here. Falafel shape was weird but tasted fine."}
{"text":"Came here with a lot of ppl (30+) and enough seats for everyone!! Food was fast and good. Chicken was moist and the Greek fries weren't bad. Overall pretty happy and stuffed right now."}
{"text":"Greek place near ASU prices for a greek pita sandwich are $5 including fries and a drink.. decent foor good fries.  Overall nothing incredibly special but it always hits the spot when you need a gyro on the cheap."}
{"text":"Was convinced once again by peers to try this place.  Oliveo's delivers pretty mediocre/flavorless Greek for a \"bargain\"  price. Bargain being around five dollars for anything on the menu.   The taste.... It tastes like 99¢    Recap from my visits:   Bad greasy falafel (prompted me to review the falafel was truly terrible) Tasteless Gyros Sides that stayed....well on the side  Go to Haji Baba nearby instead... or anywhere else for that matter.  I guess location keeps em in business~"}
{"text":"Ok I've been a loyal Oliveos fan since I moved to Tempe... never had an issue. But the last 2 times I ordered delivery from here I was given dry crumbly pita bread, sides of hummus that were in containers not properly closed and got on everything else, greek fries that were stale (not even exaggerating, they tasted like day-old fries from the fridge). Delivery dudes were usually cool but lately they've been so bitchy and just kind of throw the food at me and bounce. I've always tipped them well too. The only perk to this place is that whenever I order (always weekdays) they're very fast. But I'd like to have food that isn't gross??? Might as well go to Haji Baba instead. Way better service and food."}
{"text":"Oliveo is awesome! It used to be located across the street under the name Cyprus Pita Grill, and when they moved they kept most of the same food and added even more. The chicken souvlaki pita, dolmas, and greek fries are my favorites, but everything I've tried is great. They are open until 3am and they deliver, which is great for a college kid such as myself. If you're looking for some great greek food for a good price, definitely try Oliveo!!"}
{"text":"While in Greece I fell in love with Gyros and Greek food.  When I got back to the US I spent a lot of time looking for places that prepare Greek with a nod towards authenticity. Most of the places around Phoenix are great at preparing flavored cardboard, but suck at preparing Greek food. So, as you can imagine I was thrilled when I finally found Oliveos which uses real Gyro meat cooked in an authentic fashion.  Whenever I'm in Tempe for dinner Oliveos is definitely one of the first places I consider."}
{"text":"I love Oliveo's falafels and hummus and pita, but my only complaint is that I wish they would expand their salad options. I know salads arn't quite Greek but I love salads. However, their Greek Fries are amazing and the Chicken Bruchetta Pita is yummy also. If calories didnt affect the human body I would probably eat here 4 times a week. I do love that they are open till 3am though! and the guy who works there is super nice."}
{"text":"This was my first time having Greek food and it was super tasty good! :) Everything was cooked well and the tzatziki sauce was delicious too! ^..^"}
{"text":"I live close enough to Oliveo for it to be embarrassing to even consider calling for delivery and would travel miles to get a good gyro, and yet I have only been to Oliveo a few times. Why? The oomph just isn't there. While the pita and vegetables are fresh, the meat is just passable without the intensity of savory spices that should come standard. Moreover, as a person who once started a Hummus Fanciers club with my sister, I won't often be coming through the door of a place serving just average hummus.  Oliveo's late night hours and great prices will keep me coming back but only when I don't have the time or the will to go one block south to Haji Baba, Tasty Kabab or Cafe Istanbul, all better options."}
{"text":"I just recently discovered this place and I have to say, I'm in LOVE!! Their pitas are the most incredible creations. And their hummus? TO DIE FOR!!! 5 Stars, ALL DAY!!"}
{"text":"Ordered a gyro and fries. Everything tasted ok but the gyro was pretty skimpy and the fries were soggy. It's not bad for a late night gyro but I'm not sure I'd be back."}
{"text":"OMGGG the greek fries are to die for! The food and service is wonderful! I live about 40 minutes away and I find myself making the drive a few times a month."}
{"text":"Nothing to write home about.   Boyfriend and I stopped by because we had a Groupon for this place. $8 for $20 worth of food. Not bad. Our total came to $23 and change, so I suppose for $11 or so, what we got wasn't bad.   We ordered the greek bruschetta appetizer. Not worth almost $5. The pita was good, the pesto was okay, but the tomato mix seemed like diced tomatoes - no extra spices. And the parm on top definitely wasn't fresh. It tasted like it might have come from a big bottle of Kraft.   I ordered the chicken bruschetta pita, and Boyfriend got a gyro. We also got a side of greek fries and two drinks. (Noted only because a \"combo\" supposedly includes a side and a drink, for the same price as a side only. We were charged for both drinks.) The gyro didn't have enough tsatziki, in my opinion. It did have cucumber instead of onion, which I liked. My pita wasn't anything special. I might have liked it more if we hadn't ordered the greek bruschetta as an app.   The fries were barely lukewarm. The feta wasn't melted at all. Not impressive. I've had better greek fries at every other greek place I've been to.   Overall, I'd probably come back after a night on Mill for some drunk munchies. But I won't be going out of my way to visit again."}
{"text":"I hate to give such a low rating but I can't lie when i say i really have experienced better. This place almost reminds me off knock off fast food type Greek food. They messed up our to go order(first strike), the staff did not even eat their own food( i asked the opinion of one of the employees and he stated i never have/will eat this food) whaaaa??? coulda at least lied, would have sounded better geezz..  the food was just mediocre in my opinion... just a good place for convenience late at night and yes the alcohol is probably a good idea since it probably does in fact help the food taste better.   meh :/"}
{"text":"We went here with a Groupon.  Had 2 combo plates--chicken souvlaki with greek salad and classic gyro with fries.  Both came with pita bread, tzatziki sauce and delicious lemony rice.  The food was great as well as the guy that was working the order desk.  he was very polite and had our food to the table QUICK!  We will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Probably the best Greek food you can get in the Valley. Mind you now that this is not a full sit down restaurant but you will be impressed with the food. Dishes for vegetarians (Halloumi Pita), meat lovers (Lamb), and salad lovers. They always have discounts running like their lunch special for $6.55 that no place can beat for fresh ingredients. I've always enjoyed eating here and I find myself there about 2-3 times a week because it's hard to find healthy choices. Go there and try it for yourself and you'll see what I mean."}
{"text":"I've been getting Oliveo delivery for a while now, however I've noticed a change in the past few months. I'm not sure if the place is under new management or what, but the food has become hit or miss.   My absolute favorite thing to order from Oliveo was the Halloumi pita (as a matter of fact, after I tried this for the first time I drove all over town looking for Halloumi cheese!!) . The last time I ordered it, it was not so spectacular. I do love this place, but sometimes the food quality is lacking. Some things are consistently good, like the Greek fries or Chicken Bruschetta pita. All in all, I will still continue eating at this place, the people are friendly (although I miss the old man who used to take orders on the phone..what happened to him?!) lol, and I havent had so many bad experiences that I wouldnt go back. Its not my favorite Greek food but its good on a Friday night when I dont want to cook!"}
{"text":"I still like this place after 5 years of going I've really only had one bad experience where my gyro meat was a bit overcooked. But the food while cheap has been consistently good. I don't recommend the burger though the gyro is where it's at. The cashier guys are always really cool and personable. I've always liked the college feel of the place and the late night special with greek salad."}
{"text":"Oliveo Grill created an exclusive app called B.a.R. slots that gives out awesome coupons and rewards for the restaurant. Search \"barslots\" on your iOS or play store and download for free (it's a purple icon). The more you spin, the more you win! Without a doubt, it's a neat concept and nice gift for their guests."}
{"text":"This was one of my favorite  \"go-to\" take-out places when living in Tempe. I absolutely love the halloumi cheese pita with extra tzatziki sauce. I also like the greek fries and the greek bruschetta.  Great prices too!"}
{"text":"Mmm When I think of this place I think of fresh fresh fresh! I don't know about you but I love me some Greek food. I will admit that you can get a good Greek Salad from anywhere, but not an authentic one!  This Greek Salad is drizzled with the most amazing, fresh from Grandma's kitchen, dressing. It is chalk full of fresh spices and herbs, olives, diced cucumber, tomatoes, and you can even add chicken or any of the other meats traditional to Greek food. My favorite thing about the meal is the fact that it comes with FRESH homemade pita bread&more dressing to dip it in! ! Did I mention that the dressing is good enough to drink?   Anyhow my only negative take aways are that they skimp on the olives, even though I have paid for extra there weren't any extra. Also, the prices went up not to long ago so I don't go there as often."}
{"text":"Super expensive takeout for really dry food. Takeout 2x and always the same problem..Feel like I could buy all ingredients and make it better."}
{"text":"Been a regular for 6 years. Like any Business it's had its ups and downs but they are currently doing a lot of improvements and the staff is a lot better and actually seem to care. Amazing place!"}
{"text":"So I just finished eating my first order from the Oliveo Grill. It's a real mixed bag. I ordered from here because A. I've never tried it before and B. It's open late.  It gets props for being open so late in a college town where things shut down scary early. And the customer service is great. The gentleman on the phone was very nice and friendly and the deleivery driver was also super nice.  I ordered the Lamb suvlaki and the chicken bruschetta pita. The lamb suvlaki pita had only 4 pieces of meat in it and one was all gristle. The tasziki and vegetables were tasty and fresh though. And the meat that was not gristle was tasty. The bruschetta pita was odd tasting. Much too garlic (uncooked garlic) for something that isn't toasted. Both of my pitas were cold (though for these specific two that wasn't too much of a problem.  All in all, I probably will order again and give this place one more shot."}
{"text":"Used to get greek twice a week but recently changed jobs so I tried Olivio's due to the fact they deliver. I ended up paying $18 total. $10.99 for the plate, $2.50 delivery Fee and $.89 tax. So $14 plus $4 tip.  For $14 I excpect to be pretty satisfied with a meal. I did not get enough food. The side of rice was about 2 spoonfuls. salad was also about 3 bites. the $14 I paid was not worth it. Food quality was good but I feel ripped off and still hungry. George's Famous Gyros gave me way more good food for about $8.   Not going to order again, maybe it will be worth dining in but I'm pretty dissapointed and still hungry so if you have an appetite I'd recommend another spot."}
{"text":"Good greek food and very friendly staff.  Nothing fancy but good portions.  Greek fries-  mmmmmmmmmmm!"}
{"text":"When it comes to affordable greek food in a college town environment, Oliveo takes the pita. The lunch combinations are honest in price and will definitely fill you up, they always have a good game on including Soccer which some restaurants never show, and everything is made quick with a fresh taste. I'm quite fond of the Halloumi Cheese Pita with greek fries, but have heard great things about the buffalo pita as well. Worth checking out if you're in the area and craving something flavorful."}
{"text":"Tried scheduling a dinner for a group of people. James the manager said he had another call coming in an hung up on me. With this kind of service I will not bring my group!"}
{"text":"I went here the other night after a night of drinking at Superbowl party.  This is very close to Mill, and it is indeed a good place that is open until 3 am for drunk people.  I got the chicken on skewers, hummus, and the greek fries.  A few of my friends got the bruschetta chicken with a pesto sauce.  Their food looked really flavorful, and mine was okay.  I had to use hummus and tahini to add some extra flavor.  I do have to saw, the Greek fries are superb.  It is a good size portion of fries with garlic sauce and feta cheese.  I can totally see some people coming late night to munch down on these fries."}
{"text":"I couldn't tell you how the food is which is unfortunate. I placed an order for carry out on their website that told me it would take an hour. I thought it was strange, but I waited and headed out with 15min to spare. On my way I got a call from the girl working the front desk asking if I was going to be coming to pick up my order. After I explained the time frame I received from the site she then told me it was still on daylight savings. Uh.......  So I of course asked if it had been sitting out a long time and if it would be cold and soggy. \"Uh, well...let me ask my manager if we can make you a new order\". I waited 5min on hold for her to tell me her manager said no, but they strill asked if would I be coming.  To pick up my order she basically just told me was cold and disgusting? They had to be kidding.  I opted out and headed to the best fall back anyone could ask for....buffalo wild wings!"}
{"text":"Its been said before, but they deliver until 3 AM.  We were not in the state of mind to drive and have been getting a little sick of hungry howies.  It took a solid hour for our food to arrive, but that seems pretty normal for late night Tempe. Everyone raved about the food.  It was very good for late night delivery.  The chicken bruchetta pita was excellent although a little small.  I recommend 2 pitas for anyone with any kind of appetite.  You might not get through both, but the one was just a little too small to satisfy.  My only complaint, and the reason for 4 starts instead of 5 was the traditional hummus.  I didnt not think it was very good at all.  Many places in Tempe have much better."}
