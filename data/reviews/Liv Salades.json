{"text":"By far the BEST salad place in Montreal .
If you are in town you must try their delicious freshly made salads with the finest ingredients and a very generous big portion with very reasonable price ..
Very very Friendly staff and very positive vibes."}
{"text":"I had an incredible lunch here- split a huge and delicious salad (the Big C) with my friend, bought a tasty beer, great vibe, and had a great conversation with the staff and other clients here. Such a warm vibe. So glad I stumbled into Liv! A nice break, too, from really heavy dinners every night."}
{"text":"First time posting a review on Yelp. 
Thought this place deserves a few more excellent reviews. 

Passed by this place at noonish on a weekday and it was packed, saw their portions being served and looked great. So I came a few weeks later at 4:40 pm on a Saturday (they close at 5). The owner still gave us great service. Hubby and I took two lililou salads, his with added chicken. Delicious! Hubby is not one to eat these kinds of things (he's more meat and potatoes), but he liked it, so big plus there. I'm Definitely going back to try their other salads."}
{"text":"Stopped here after an exhausting morning cycling and walking round Montreal! I planned to just grab a salad to go but one bite and ended up eating the whole thing! Amazing fresh salad.. honestly one of the best I ever had.. the only thing that annoyed me for $3.50 for a water seemed a lot.. other than than that loved his place.. the seared tuna that I added to my salad was soooo good!"}
