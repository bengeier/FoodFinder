{"text":"I went in a few weeks ago after continuously seeing this on my feed. The food was good,I ordered pizza and was there on a day that offered a deal on a large, the assortment of cheeses used is really good. The crust was a tad limp or soggy but very tasty. I also ordered a chicken Philly that was very good. I will go back and try some other selections on the menu."}
{"text":"Our favorite place for take out burgers and fries!! Their cheeseburgers taste a heck of a lot better then five guys or any other of those pricey burger joints!"}
{"text":"Their pizza is very good and a great price wayy better than any pizza hut I've had also thier chicken is great well seasoned.... very friendly & great service"}
{"text":"Never had the pizza but I love the burgers , salads, and chicken.  Also like the fact that they don't serve pork so I don't have to play detective checking to see what kind of meat is in my food. Overall they serve good food for a reasonable price"}
{"text":"I got the hawaiian pizza and wings. The wings were actually pretty good but overpriced. The pizza was a huge disappointment. The cheese stuck together and the toppings almost non existent. Would have ordered dominoes or something for the price. Will not be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"I have no idea how this place has 5 stars. The prices are low but the quality is terrible. I ordered a large mushroom pizza and I ate one piece and went for my second piece 30 minutes later and the cheese became rubbery and the bread became super hard. I would recommend going to Little Caesar's  for cheap pizza over this place any day. The facility itself is very uninviting and looks dirty. The pizza was made fairly quickly but the customer service sucks... so all in all a one star rating of this place is being generous."}
{"text":"Excellent chefs salad, but extremely petty about the dressing.  Personally,  I don't like a lot of dressing,  but I bought a large for me and my mom.  They wanted an extra. 75 cents for another tiny cup of salad.  COME ON!! THEY ONLY GIVE ONE TINY CUP FOR A LARGE???"}
{"text":"Bad service at the register.  For some reason they won't make you a sandwich to eat at the restaurant while you wait for the pizza to be made.  Everything must come out at the same time."}
{"text":"Ordered some pizza for an event a few days ago. Loved the pizza, lots of spices and very cheesy! Eat it as soon as you get it though -- if you let it sit, the cheese gets congealed. Had a couple pieces of fried chicken and a potato wedge, too - amazing! I would definitely go back for the chicken and I am excited to try a calzone, too!"}
