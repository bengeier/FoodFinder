{"text":"Bright,  clean sit in or out ( terrasse ) with choice of appetizers,  pasta, pizza and of course Gelato! Service was slow considering the wood burning oven cooks a pizza in under 5 minutes but thankfully it was well worth the wait.  Prices were good and staff were very friendly.  We were a group of 4 and we all said we would be happy to become regulars for their pizza."}
{"text":"Very consistent in the quality of their food ' i love their pizza they are to die for ! There is a big selection of flavors ! Definately worth it after a walk by the water ! Great healty snack !"}
{"text":"This is a great spot for an wood brining oven pizza, nice little spot not far from the water. I would call this a perfect summer date spot. My gf and I went for lunch on nice hot day. She took the cutlet sandwich and told me it was pretty good and I took the margarita pizza.  The pizza crust was thin and a little bit chewy that's the way I love my pizza. The prices vary cheapest pizza is 8$ and the most expensive is 13$ not bad at all.  We also tried there gelato and it was also very good. Would definitely come back"}
