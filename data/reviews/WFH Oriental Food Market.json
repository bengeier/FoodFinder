{"text":"Best selection, friendly staff willing to help out the ignorant, like me. :) Yummy stuff, and this has the ingredients to make restaurant-level meals."}
{"text":"This is my new spot to hang out. Okay well not to hang out but at least you get all of my food. Their selection is top-notch in the produce always looks great. And the prices you can't beat them. I brought my mom here and she was thrilled to pick up some things that you needed for the house and for herself. She was amazed that the prices were low as they were for as much as we got that day.  The staff is always super friendly too. They were able to help me find what I needed and even offered suggestions on what to get instead. I found it to be an enjoyable experience to shop here.  I will say that I got one of my new favorite things at this place. I've been trying to find a really good curry paste and have no luck. Tucked in a corner I found a little can of curry paste as well as different flavors of curry. Since they were about a dollar so on a whim I just bought five. Flavors like regular Curry, panang curry, massaman curry, green curry, Etc. I think you get the point. They were just so cheap that I thought okay well one of these must be good.  I then went home and cooked up some chicken with the curry paste and some coconut milk with vegetables that I bought at the oriental food market. What I presented this dish for dinner it was a raving success. Everyone was talking about oh my gosh it tastes exactly like our favorite restaurant. This curry paste is top-notch. I think I will never go back to anything else other than this.  That's something that I like about exploring new food markets and picking things off the shelf to try. You never know what's going to be great and what's going to be awful, but it's fun to try. Go here to get your usual staples and to try something else. Hopefully it turns out a raving success, and if not you try again next week."}
{"text":"One of my favorite grocery shopping places. They have A LOT of fresh produces compare to other Asian stores. I go to lotus down the street very often, but WFH oriental market tend to have more fresh produce. Sometimes the price can be cheaper too. WFH also not only sell Chinese/ Taiwanese grocery, there's Korean grocery as well. People that work there sometimes don't understand what I'm saying, but this place is pretty organized. You can usually find things that you need. Price can be tricky sometimes, the price label sometimes is missing, and sometimes it labels per pound on the side. However, if you ask someone they're usually very helpful. Overall, this is a great place to shop at!"}
{"text":"Great selection. Great prices! I cook a lot of Japanese food, and this is where I buy a lot of ingredients, including fresh ramen noodles, purple yams, real bamboo shoots, and red bean buns it's worth a trip to the strip just to shop here. If you're looking for green tea Twix, this is the place!"}
