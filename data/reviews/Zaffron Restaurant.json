{"text":"Just loooove this restaurant! 
The food is very good... Persian bread and the works! 
Being a vegetarian and being able to go somewhere where they will make you a veggie kebab is just about a trigger for the word AWESOME! 

Anyway, nice atmosphere, good food and awesome staff!

Good Job!"}
{"text":"This is an amazing persian restaurant. We went for breakfast. The kale pache was amazing and in very big portions. The halim was also pretty good, be sure to ask for extra sugar. Although, the omlette was sort of flavourless, definetly not their strong point. Service was fine, we got served quickly and nothing was missing. I definitely recommend coming here!"}
{"text":"Super inconsistent. 
On the good days, food is a little dry but good. Used to be a really great restaurant but they've run down on their chicness. 

They have annoying singers on Friday nights. Come on Zaffron, you're classier than that..."}
{"text":"I ate here today with one of my friends....the food was okay nothing wrong with that. However, the servant was very rude. After I had paid, almost 6 dollars tip, approximately 7% of our total bill! I got approached on my way out by a servant asking how the food was... I answered that it was okay thank you.

Next thing, I see he is complaining that the tip is very low and that it should be at least 10%....which is redicilous....I pay according to what pleases me, there is no such mandatory tipping rule.

I suggest that they put the mandatory 10% tipping on their menu if they are so worried that people have to pay 10% tip....a very unpleasant approach and unprofessional....and shameful."}
{"text":"Very good and decent food. Large portions. On the expensive side.

It is a very good place to introduce non-persians to persian food."}
{"text":"I was literally 800m away from this resturant , so I called and asked for delivery (pizza) 
And they said it would be a $8 delivery charge !! How about that , even a cab wont charge that much for a trip from there to where I was ordering from"}
{"text":"Came with my wife and cousin because we know nothing about Persian food and wanted to sample it in a pleasant atmosphere.  The prices are high compared to the surrounding deli's but the dining room is pleasant and service fair.  Had the flat bread with different appetizer dips.  Then ordered a variety of shish kabob styled meats that were freshly cooked in an oven behind the counter:  lamb, ground beef, veal, chicken.  They were all good and went well with the rice."}
{"text":"I can only think of one word to describe our dinner at Zaffron - \"Meh\".
Somehow the place left a lot to be desired. I judge Persian restaurants by their most basic food - koobideh and barg. If your koobideh is not absolutely perfect, you are not a good Persian restaurant. Quite simple.

Zaffron is a westernized Persian place...blending authentic Iranian food with regular Italian dishes, thus ending up with a pretty extensive menu. But that's pretty much it. The barg (veal kabobs) wasn't as succulent as they should be, and the koobideh was a tad bland. The only thing that saved the place was the saffron rice, which quite easily was the best I have had.

What put me off the most was my cocktail. I ordered a Mojito, and it arrived midway into my dinner. (took them 30 minutes to get a mojito!!). For its price, it was no where close to being a decent drink.

The waiters are friendly, and ours even explained the history of koobidehs, which was quite interesting. The patio seating is good for those cool summer evenings. Overall, the place is worth a visit if you are new to Persian food and don't mind driving across all the other inexpensive(but shady) restaurants present in that region.

The only reason I'll go back to this place is to try the ghormeh sabzi (another basic persian food), so that I can add or remove another star from the review!"}
{"text":"Good food, bad service. It took 10 min for the waitress to show up at our table to take our order. After she brought our food, she did not check on us even once. It took her forever to bring the bill. Not impressed with the service."}
{"text":"Zaffron is my go to place for Persian cuisine in the GTA. For me, this is as good as it gets. Excellent quality meat kabobs such as chicken, veal, beef. Awesome fish (rainbow trout,) delicious sides, salads, yogurts, eggplant dishes, and who can forget the freshly baked bread. It can get pricey but you definitely get what you pay for. Zaffron is fantastic. Definitely the best Persian food in the GTA."}
{"text":"Phenomenal food and service. Very cordial and inviting atmosphere and wait staff. Will definitely go there again when in Toronto!!!"}
{"text":"Food was very good in my opinion -- I have a sesame allergy and they were easily able to accommodate it when I ordered bread and so on. I ordered lamb shank with dill rice and it was a very large portion -- meat was very tender and the rice was good, not too oily at all which I find is the problem with some other places I otherwise like. Yoghurt/eggplant dip is good but could use a bit more seasoning; I find it is good if you accompany it with some of the parsley/onions given with the appetizer. My father ordered a lentil stew which he said was very good. Salad shirazi is also excellent.

The atmosphere can be a bit strange though, there seems to be a very large part of the restaurant with big seating areas, I guess for big parties or something, and if you come on a slow night (I came early on a Friday evening in the middle of January, there were only two other tables at the time) it can look very dark and empty.

The waiter was a polite young guy. No complaints about him.

Overall I would recommend this place, esp for stews and so on --- the d√©cor could use a bit of an update however."}
{"text":"It was my first time ordering food and we were very satisfied with their customer service, food quality and friendly staff and their behavior."}
{"text":"I recently had dinner at Zaffron and overall it was a pleasant experience and I walked away having enjoyed my meal.  The space inside the restaurant was inviting and comfortable.  The service was excellent as it was very attentive and friendly.  Above all the food was well cooked and presented.  I'm not an expert when it comes to Persian food, but I found the food to be quite good and satisfying.  The flatbread was very good.  The kebabs were sumptuously savoury and the rice was delicious!  All in all, I'm not sure you could ask for more when going out for a nice dinner.  Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Outdated tables and chairs, very dark and unpleasant atmosphere... the food is by far the worst persian food Ive had....no taste at all. Washrooms were very dirty and smelly. Its very expensive for the food and service received. Will never return."}
{"text":"Called the restaurant to ask if it is possible to make reservation for 25 people. The person who answered asked me if this is for a \"wedding\", I said no it's just a group of friends going for dinner. He said \"it'll be cheaper if you do the dinner at home\". WOW. Did I ask how much it would cost ? This was so rude !! I just said bye and will never ever try to make a reservation there."}
{"text":"A couple years ago, I went to Zaffron and loved it. However, I took a few visitors to the city there one night (about a month ago) and was really disappointed by the service.

For every item we ordered, they tried to sell us another dish instead (or add a bunch of extras). I don't mind suggestions, but they employed really high pressure tactics.  They kept pressuring us to order this drink - then pressured us into getting not just a glass, but a pitcher (though we said we'd prefer to each order our own)... saying it's their signature drink and to die for.  Well, it wasn't our taste and the pitcher sat on the table (we ordered other drinks instead). They just wouldn't take no for an answer, causing some awkward moments through the dinner. This wasn't just for the occasional item - they did this for every course that each of us chose.  Needless to say, I was a bit embarassed I had recommended this place as being excellent and everyone had to put up with that. 

I know restaurants tend to be more aggressive in upselling when people use groupons or if it's winterlicious - but we're paying full price.  I thought it was over the top."}
{"text":"It wasn't a bad experience, but I would not return.

The food was great! My problem was with the unclear way they sell it - the set up of wrong expectations led to an overall unpleasant experience.

We had ordered - 4 skewers that our waiter suggested, the taadig appetizer, 2 vegeterian appetizers (olives, and a yogurt blend - both terrific!), 2 glasses of house wine and a beer. That was $160, for 3 people, for a large lunch. 

For the 4 \"skewers\"/kebobs, it actually was charged as 3 full dinner sized meals, which the waiter didn't make clear. If we knew that it actually was charged as 3 meals, we wouldn't have ordered as much. One of the 4 \"skewers\" was a rack of lamb, which was $28, which may be fair for a rack of lamb - but highly unexpected when you're thinking you're ordering kebabs. It was unfortunate that such a huge amount of food was suggested for lunch as well. 

While the food was delicious - fresh, great, large portions (as they should be for the price...), clearly prepared with knowledge and ability - I am still unlikely to return because of how I felt after due to my incorrect expectations of meal size/price. 

My recommendation is if you go, do not take suggestions from the waiter but order specifically off the menu as to have a clear understanding - and expectation - of what you're getting. 

It was not too loud, it was not too busy, and the house wine was A-OK."}
{"text":"Excellent best Persian food I tasted  so far.
The kabob was soft cooked well and juicy."}
{"text":"November 18th EDIT: A company employee private messaged me this: 
\"The next time you come in, appetizers on us, ask for MARIUS. Can you please change your star rating... ?\" Are you serious?!? No I won't. 

September 20th: Went here for a birthday party with a group of about 10 ppl. I had previously reserved by calling. Most of us stuck with kabob plates, but even then the prices were expensive ($22~ for lamb??). 

The server took our order and suggested us some \"complimentary\" appetizers with bread (there were olives, grilled eggplant and some others - most were really good). I thought that was a nice gesture. Anyway we got our food and it was delicious!! The meat was tender and juicy, the rice was great too. Since it was a birthday, I asked for a slice of cake to be brought out and he said what's the name I should put on it, I told him and he said great. I even asked how big the slice is since I didn't - he made a triangle with his hands and I was like great. Guess what we got?! A WHOLE CAKE! I couldn't even say no because he wrote \"HBD ____!\" on it. No one wanted the cake since we were already full from the free appetizers and entrees. We cut it and it was delicious but we didn't really need a whole cake! 

Anyway, we asked for the bill and we got one bill even though we asked mostly separates. Then the server said he cannot reprint separately, so we sat there trying to calculate who pays what. 

Wait, there's more, they charged us for the appetizers, I inquired and he said \"the bread was complimentary, not the appetizers\". He didn't say it that way when he offered! Oh, the cake was $30 by the way. 

The way they are sneakily putting in appetizers and bringing out whole cakes instead of slices - I would never return or recommend this place. The total bill ended up being about $300~ and we ended up with a cake we didn't really want. Woop."}
{"text":"Amazing kebob options here! The food was absolutely delicious and the service was great. We ordered the barley soup and shirazi salad as appetizers, and Sultani kebab as the main. The soup was full of flavour and perfect for the cold day, the salad was refreshing and I really liked the dressing on it. They also gave us complimentary bread and pickles. The bread tasted like it was baked in a wood-burning oven, so good! Then the main came: sultani is one skewer of ground beef kebob and one skewer filet mignon (comes with rice and a smokey tomato). Both kebabs were juicy and smokey and flavourful. 
Their Persian tea comes with sugar cubes and is a perfect way to end your meal on a cold winter (or spring) day. 
The portion sizes are huge here: one main, one soup and one salad was just enough to fill up two people.
Will definitely be back when I am in the area!"}
{"text":"This is my first time having Persian food so I wasn't too familiar with it.  The portion is huge and tasted good.  We ordered Kashkeh Bademjan as the appetizer, the Barg, Fesenjoon and Ghaimeh.  The restaurant is kind of upscale and the pricing reflected it.  They even dimmed the night half way through our dinner.  It was around half full on a Saturday night at 7 pm.   It was a good experience as I got to taste these unique food.  I will most likely come back next time for more Persian food. The only reason I gave it a 3 is because I do not have any other Persian places to compare it to.  It was an average Restaurant that didn't blow me away so I say 3 is a fair score."}
{"text":"It is an OK place. I don't like the ambiance. They have dimmed the light and have tried to make it look good, but there's something into it that makes the place look gloomy and old. It might be the combination of yellow walls and dimmed light, or the low ceiling, or something. I won't eat-in anymore. Their house bread is nice but expensive. We had Barg Kabob, Koobideh Kabob and Zeitoon Parvarde. The Brag was the best. It was tender and well done. The Koobideh was burnt outside and raw inside, so we didn't like it much. Zeitoonparvarde didn't look good, but tasted well. The waitress was very inexperienced, but polite. I think it is too pricey for the type of restaurant that it is. There are other Iranian restaurants close by which serve better food in a much nicer ambiance with better price. As I said, I won't eat in anymore, but if I crave for Barg Kabob, I will take it out from this place."}
{"text":"We came here for a family gathering.  The service was slow and disrespectful. When we asked the staff for help for how much food we should get, they provided us with terrible advice with proportions way off from what was realistically feasible to eat to get us to pay more money. They took food off the table before people were finished and charged us so much more than what appeared on the menu or is appropriate for the quantity of food ordered.  I highly recommend avoiding this place as the service gets an F, the price gets an F, and the quality of the food was a C."}
{"text":"Love the vaziri plate. Chicken was very tender and full of flavour. Rice and salad was wonderful. Great spot for take out as ambiance in restaurant is lacking."}
{"text":"I took 7 of  my friends and colleagues to the restaurant and all were truly impressed with very delicious food and professionalism shown by all staffs specialty Mr.Arash who is really polite with an excellent sense of duty and service. Will be back  again."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night, place had a few tables full of people. Atmosphere was good and there was a live band.

The live band was a guy singing his heart out on the piano.

Food was great, better then most Persian restaurants I have had in the Toronto area. I would definitely come back in the summer when the patio is open!"}
{"text":"Expensive, zero customer service, not clean , horrible kebob , DJ is an idiot, Save yourself pain and agony and avoid this place , I went there once and it was my last time"}
{"text":"The ppl working here know nothing about the menu or event! Our waitress took away our food when we were half done!! I made a remark that I wasn't even done with it and she gave me a dry sorry! I asked her about live music and she said she has no idea who is the singer! The owner should spend some time training their ppl so they don't look like fools when asked question! As for food nothing special!"}
{"text":"The food and service here is amazing and I keep coming back for that reason.

I've tried an assorent of the grilled meats and kebob and they are so delicious that I dream about them from time to time. 

The dips, bread, and appetizers here are jaw dropping: kashkeh bademjan,  bademjan kebob, maust borani..

Not a fan of the zeytoon parbardem."}
{"text":"This was the best meal I had in Toronto during my entire trip. 

What a great restaurant! Every single dish was excellent. There was a live music performance around 8:30. That really added to the great atmosphere. I was here with my family, 7 of us. The music being sang had quite a few oldie throwbacks, so of course, my aunts and uncles were really into it and began singing along. It was great!

The arrival time of everyone had about a 30 minute gap and the waitress was respectful, seated us, and did not pressure us to order. We waited until the last person arrived before beginning our order. We began with some dips. There was a spinach dip, two eggplant dips, a walnut dip, and a yogurt dip. The eggplant dip was so delicious. I ate so much of the bread. I added the eggplant to the rice once the rice came out. 

Then came the salad. I did not try much of that because it was just regular salad and had olives. No thanks! Then came the soup. Mmmmmmm! It had little bits of carrot, celery, and was a thick barley soup. I love the food here because everything is SO delicious and SO healthy! Wish I could've grown another stomach for this meal. 

We got a sample platter of meats so that we could try a little bit of everything. There was very soft steak, then kebab beef (soft like what you find in gyros?) and chicken. Not a huge fan of chicken here, but ya got me. This is the place to eat chicken for sure. The grilled flavor is so rich. There are many spices working together, flavors my taste buds have never experienced before. We enjoyed this meat platter with the gloriously large plate of rice. Basmati rice with some butter spread over it. The yellow from the saffron along with another dark red/brown spice that was on the table. I am not sure what it is called, but it was zesty and my uncle said it lowers cholesterol. Delicious and great for your health. Why isn't there more of this food back home?

As I was struggling to fit all this food, the most amazing piece of lamb arrived at the table. It was so nicely prepared. The meat fell right off the bones as we shared it. It came in a little heat-proof plate, the kind fancy restaurants use to serve tiny portions of pasta. This piece was not grilled nor elaborately spiced. This was simple. I have never had such a soft piece of lamb meat until this point in time. 

As the night went on, service became a lot slower. It took a long time to get napkins and tea. Tea took 15-20 minutes to make. There was only 2 other tables in the entire restaurant...and it took so long to make little tea bags. I cant take a star off for that though, the food was really phenomenal. And for those of you who like healthy things, the sodas there are served in glass bottles which means there is no high fructose corn syrup in them. 

I definitely will save this location to come back to whenever I have the opportunity to visit Toronto again. 

There is some parking out front, but it is very limited."}
{"text":"I was going to write a nasty review about how expensive this place is in comparison to other Persian restaurants around it but Trout's right. If it's your first time trying Iranian food then this place would be a good place to start. They've made this place more western rather than Persian (I'd almost classify it as a Persian/Italian place) which has pushed away a lot of their Iranian clientele however they are drawing in the foreign crowd which is a good thing in itself since everyone gets hooked on Persian food once they try it!

They have a large space as well so if you're thinking of a large group gathering this is a great place to have it at."}
{"text":"Food, price, and ambience similar to Shomal North on yonge and steeles. Some differences are that this place plays  live music and has an Italian menu where you can order wood oven pizza. I enjoyed the beef kebobs and rice a lot. The kebobs had good flavour. The egg plant dish was okay. Didnt have much taste. Bread was a bit dry.

Service could have been better. Waiter was a bit cold and wasn't attentive. I had to ask for my water to be filled instead of him checking to see if we needed more. The hostess was nice. Greeted us as we walked in ans said good bye with a smile when we left. 

There's parking in the back of the restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm Persian so I grew up with Kabobs/rice and stew all my life. 

The koobideh was super dry and by the time I ate half way it was hard. The chicken was nice and juicy. Salad Shirazi (cucumbers, tomato, onions, dry mint, S/P with lemon/olive oil dressing) please don't ruin the salad by using lemon juice from a bottle!

Not my go-to for Persian food."}
{"text":"Been here before a couple of times with my family in the past (last time was about 2 years ago), and it was great. Though, I had to bring my rating down tremendously due to my experience today.

Just a disclaimer-- not meaning to be rude, just an honest review from a Persian who knows good Persian food (which this for the most part was not). 

To start off with the positives: the restaurant is very clean, which you can notice right off the bat. The outside look of the restaurant is also very nice!

Now onto the negatives!

The service was rather on the creepy side. Our waiter was a middle-aged balding man with socially awkward skills, and an equally awkward look to him. 

He greeted us when we walked in, and asked where we wanted to sit at, to which my boyfriend said \"anywhere that is close to the t.v.\" (since the Poland vs. Senegal Fifa game was playing). The waiter with a serious face looked at him and said \"I will have to charge you extra for that\". My boyfriend laughed, but the waiter directed us to the table maintaining a serious face and tone. 

Once we had sat at the table after the awkward interaction, my fiance and I wanted to order an appetizer before our meal.
 I suggested the ghorme sabzi (herb, beef, and red kidney bean stew) over tadig (crispy bread or crispy bottom of the pot rice).  
The waiter told me the tadig was not ready, and he pushed the ghorme Sabzi over normal rice on us as the appetizer (it is usually a full meal with the rice). I was not in the mood to argue, as I was very tired and hungry, so I let him decide that for us. He also tried to decide which kabobs we should  order. I ordered the soltani kabob (one skewer ground beef, and one skewer filet mignon) to share with my fiance.

The waiter brought complimentary salad and freshly baked bread for us as starters. They were great!

The salad was fresh, with a light mayonnaise based dressing. Reminded me of thousand islands dressing, but with more notes of vinegar. 

The bread was the best part of the meal. Delicious and addictive with the butter spread. I could eat that bread every day for the rest of my life!

Unfortunately though, once the ghorme sabzi arrived  (at the same time as the kabobs), my impression of the restaurant dropped drastically.

The ghorme Sabzi was atrocious. Bland. Lacked salt. Lacked flavour. I took two bites of it and made my fiance eat the rest.

The koobideh kabob skewer (the ground beef skewer) was on the dry side, but the flavour was ok. Definately not the best kabob I've had, but slightly enjoyable.

The barg kabob (filet mignon beef skewer)  was not marinated at all, and lacked seasoning. It tasted like pure, untouched meat. Not enjoyable, but edible.

In all honesty, the food was very disappointing this time.  I could make a meal 100x better than what I had today.

The meal came to $50 dollars without any drinks. 

I left that restaurant dissatisfied and uncomfortable with the experience. It was enough to make me know for sure that we will no't be returning."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!
The house Noon was scrumptious!  The Koubideh was YUMMY as was the Barg ... BUT did I mention the Koubideh was YUMMMMMMY!!!!!!!  I also very much enjoyed and devoured the Faloodeh!!!"}
{"text":"The food is great! I love the atmosphere in the restaurant. It has a classy look to it without being pretentious. 

The kebabs are always the winner! Their stew is also better than most persian stew I ever had.

The servers are very polite and the food arrives unexpectedly quickly.

The only bone I have to pick with this restaurant is the parking lot; it has a lot of potholes. Other than that, all is well."}
{"text":"Delicious food! We ordered some kebabs and they were delicious. Came with yummy bread and rice with grilled tomato - the perfect combination. I've been to a few Persian restaurants and this one is one of the better ones for sure. We also ordered the KASHKEH BADEMJAN - would highly recommend this. It pairs nicely with the kebabs. The owner even gave us complimentary bread with the eggplant dish! 

We didn't dine in - got takeout. We would like to return to eat at the restaurant as it looked very warm and inviting."}
{"text":"Dined at zaffron on the weekend. It was very busy at lunch hour but  the service was good, fast and friendly. Ordered kebabs, comes with saffron rice and salad, and some extra garnish of veggies on the side. Delicious! The kebabs are well-cooked and flavorful. Really big portions. They also have a wood burning oven for pizza, which smelled really good. It's a Persian place, so if you go, order the kebabs. I will be back for more."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. I tried the Chicken Koobideh....chicken marinated with saffron and few other spices. It was worth the price. Also, you can try the home-made yogurt drink on hot summer day!"}
{"text":"the most low quality catering in persian catagory. we had party on persian new year and every one paid for the food to be cater through this place.
the food was not even enough for everybody and the quality was bad.
I feel so bad for this business,"}
{"text":"3.5/5 - this place is usually friend and my go to place for Persian food. We used to go quite often but lately it just hasn't been the same. 

When we arrived I thought there was a private party going on but apparently every Friday and Saturday night they have live entertainment. As per the other reviews below, yes the entertainment is super annoying. I couldn't concentrate ordering with my server because yes the singing was bad. Note to self - don't come on Fridays and Saturdays. It seemed pretty packed when we arrived and people end up clearing out by the end of our meal.

The food is decent. Usually I go for koobideh which is their ground beef with basmati rice. Today I felt like having half salad and their garden salad is typical iceberg with thousand island dressing (don't recommend it). Today it was good. I usually add butter to the rice because I find it slightly dry. We also had shirazi salad (cucumber, tomato and spices) which was nice. I enjoy their bread as well. 

Our server was super nice, my friend often sees her and she is very sweet and courteous. We finished our meals with tea and by the time we were done the restaurant was closed and they didn't rush us out which is nice. 

I wouldn't go out of my way to come here. But when I'm craving Persian and in the area I might stop in."}
{"text":"First time.
I like iranian cuisine and have had it before.
Not a cheap place like Pardis at Yonge & 16 but may be worth it because the food was very delicious. The meat seemed high quality and the rice was well cooked. The portions are also satisfying.
However, the service was slow and the waitress blamed the kitchen. Business must understand that customers do not care just get it done faster. Also, take care of your washrooms. It is important."}
{"text":"I had a party with 28 guests at Zaffron Restaurant in January of 2015. I was really impressed by the quality of food and the level of service and entertainment. I highly recommend Zaffron Restaurant to whomever is looking to throw a Persian style party of great food and fun.

My experience:
1. I am a visitor to Toronto, I had to make the reservation over the phone. I spoke with the restaurant owner/manager who offered a personalized attention to my requests.

2. The service was perfect; two very professional and friendly servers were assigned to our four tables. They went above and beyond their call of duty to make sure all of our guests were receiving the best service possible.

3. The food (both appetizers and main courses) was super tasty came in large portions.

4. The price was reasonable and fair.

5. Lady Toktam (the singer/entertainer) was absolutely stunning. Beautiful voice, great selection of songs, such graceful attitude, she is a gem! We really enjoyed listening to her and dancing to her sons."}
{"text":"Unfortunately was served by the rudest waiter in my life who thought an attire and a misplaced pride can account for a lack of discipline, manners, or even language knowledge. Served me a wrong dish, and blamed the ambiguity in the menu and implicitly my ignorance for the problem. No apology and not the slightest effort to account for the mistake. Almost ruined my night."}
{"text":"Visited Zaffron for the first time on Saturday night. There was live music and a birthday gathering when we entered. The service was good and fast and the waiter was friendly. We went there late(about 11pm) but we got served anyway. I didn't enjoy the food. The meat was not fresh and Barg Kabab was not tasting good. The live library was very loud and disturbing. If you are looking for a quiet place to eat this is not your place to go."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this restaurant. I came for lunch with a friend and there were only a few other seats taken, so we had great service. We ordered sabzi, kashkeh-boudemjan, and fessenjoun. The eggplant in the k-b was perfect which is great as I'm a big eggplant fan. The other dishes were done well too and we left pretty happy.

In addition, the price is reasonable for the portion size and the atmosphere is quite nice."}
{"text":"Food arrived fast but the server didn't hear everyone's appetizer order so I was stuck eating an appetizer alone. I ordered the egg plant one that he said was most popular and the favourite. It was ok but kind of bland. I was a bit disappointed.

The main course I ordered was the Zaffron Skewer which said \"this is show time!!!\" in the description. I was expecting to be blown away by the show of gestational delight but I wasn't. He also said regardless of the side I'd get I'd get a baked tomato but no baked tomato came with my dish! Greek salad has iceberg lettuce and garden salad comes with Thousand Island dressing FYI.

I thought it was supposed to be a nicer sit down restaurant but it was like a $5 breakfast place when pay as you have to get up to pay. That only took forever, as well as 5 people to do the bill. Really?

The service was friendly. They do not have any Persian-inspired cocktails, just daiquiris and margaritas. I was hoping for something out of the ordinary for drinks but nope.

3 stars is generous and I'd say closer to a 2.5. 

It was decent but I'm spoiled with Banu as my benchmark for Persian food. I'd definitely suggest going to Banu downtown over this one. More bang for your buck there and it's way tastier."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today. The service was so so and the food left a lot to desire. The kabob seems like it was reheated and the eggplant dip was not very hot. The tadig dish seemed very old. This place has really lost its edge  been going for a long time but when fast food kabob take out is better you have to ask what's going on."}
{"text":"My husband didn't want to get stuck going to Pickle Barrel for another birthday, so he picked this place. 

Zaffron has a full Persian menu as well as an Italian/Mediterranean menu for any Persian-aphobes in your group. We started with an order of garlic bread which was more of a flat bread. It was only OK. My mother-in-law is mostly a vegetarian (and the Persian menu is meat heavy) so she had the Risotto Primavera ($15.95) and seemed very happy with her dish.

My husband and I shared the Sultani Kabob Combo ($19.99) and Tah Dig appetizer with two stews ($8.99). Both dishes were huge and we couldn't finish them. The Sultani Kabob combo consisted of barg and koobideh. The barg was very tender and made of veal. This is the first time I've seen barg made of veal and I was surprised that many dishes on the menu were also veal. (Note: I originally typed \"made of veal nad\" instead of \"made of veal and\" before.) 

The koobideh was a ground beef kabob that was nicely spiced. The kabobs were served with saffron rice.

The Tah Dig was good, though a big too crunchy. The Ghaimeh and Ghorme Sabzi stews were both good.

The restaurant is a pretty place with yellow sponged walls. A woman tailed our server the whole time without any explanation. I'm guessing she was new to being a server?

My husband really liked this place and I foresee us coming here on his next birthday."}
{"text":"I've had a good experience the last few times I've been here.
The restaurant overall doesn't deserve more than 3 stars, but the fact that they have cooked some of the dishes with great consistency for over 10 years is appreciable.

Overall kabob dishes are the best bet at Zaffron and you can be assured of decent service. What raises the bar and makes the 4* rating for me though, are a series of appetizers. The kashke-bademjan: grilled eggplant with whipped whey dip and herbs is the best one I've had in the city and tastes great with the in-house baked flatbread. The yogurt with shallots is also very good hear. Perhaps a great place to pick up appetizers to complement a meal you're making at home.
Still a bit too pricy!!"}
{"text":"I've only tried the Persian food here, and it's always been very tasty.  The kebabs are perfectly cooked.  The lavash flat bread is amazing.  The yogurt drink (similar to a salty lassi) is addictive."}
{"text":"I've come here probably 10 times before. They have changed the interior lately and now they have live music on Saturdays. We came on a Sunday, so I cannot comment on the music, but the music they had tonight was a Persian mix and I thought how great that we came on a Sunday, cause you probably wouldn't be able to hear each other. The service is great as usual.

I always had some sort of kabab and salad, but tonight I decided to get adventurous and ordered steak and fries and it was just A-OK. I know what good steak tastes like and what I had was not quite what I had in mind. Their bread and Mirza ghasemi is excellent though, so is their kabab options. I'm most likely going back to the old kabab if I come here again. I'm curious about their pizza too."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and love the outing every time. The food is very good and delicious. The thing that surprised me is that not only does this restaurant have Persian food, it has a bit of the Arabic food touch and Italian dishes like pastas and pizzas. 

The restaurant is upscale and very nicely decorated. It is spacious so there are no waiting times...at least not whenever I have gone. 

The servers are very friendly and professional. Overall, this restaurant is delicious and has a something for everyone. To top it off...HALAL!!"}
{"text":"Zaffron is a good restaurant, been there for as long as I can remember..so that certainly tells you that they're doing something right!
parking is a little challenging, you'd have to park in the back, because parking at Yonge Street is nearly impossible!
The place is nice, but it lacks that special touch, it's very \"blah\"! although they some times have music, but still...it always feel empty and deserted for some reason.
The food is good, but certainly not my first choice when it comes to Persian restaurants. If you haven't tried it yet, it's worth a visit or two.."}
{"text":"My parents went to this restaurant tonight at 7pm, wanting to enjoy a nice Iranian dinner. They were sat at the table and had waited for 30min without anyone coming to help them. They weren't even given any water. It wasn't a very busy night with only half the restaurant seated. 4 people had entered after them, seated right beside them and they managed to order and get their food. Yet, my parents had to sit there hungry without any service. We live far away, and they had to go out of their way to come because they enjoyed this restaurant but never again. It was plain insulting how they were treated and your service staff should be ashamed."}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate Persian New Year after hearing great things about their entertainment, food quality and portions from my Persian friends! It was my first time trying Persian food...and I'm addicted! 

//THE FOOD//
My favourite dishes were...
KASHKEH BADEMJAN - eggplant garlic yogurt sauce appetizer. Such a rich combination and it's AMAZING when paired with their in-house naan bread which is topped with sesame seeds.
FESENJOON - sweet & sour stew made with pomegranate juices and chicken. My taste buds were immersed with the unique flavours, and the stew was comfortingly warm and thick. 
KOOBIDEH - It's known to smell like 'eggs' (amongst a similarly off-putting smell...haha), but it tastes WAYYY better than it smells. Koobideh is essentially juicy ground beef patty skewers. Seasoned well and I highly suggest getting the included side dish option of garden salad to go with the skewers (they can also do half basmati rice too).
AKBAR MASHTI - Persian dessert ice cream that tastes of saffron and mainly rosewater with chunks of pistachio. Hands down, this has become my new favourite ice cream flavour.

I also tried their chicken breast skewer (which was surprisingly juicy!), rice stuffed grape leaves with yogurt, and their Faloodeh Persian sorbet dessert (rose water ice with vermicelli, it's sweeter than I'd prefer but it is neat that you can top it with the lemon juice or the cherry syrup provided). All their dishes were so filling, I definitely took a ton of leftovers home!

//THE ATMOSPHERE//
I felt like I got a full cultural experience with the live instrument performance, DJ playing Persian party music, and lots of dancing! My friends and I had so much fun!

//OVERALL//
I'm so glad my first encounter with Persian food was at Zaffron. I am obsessed with their bold flavours and I can't wait to come back for more!"}
{"text":"We have always had a great experience here. The eggplant kabob appetizer with walnuts and pomegranate paste is to die for. Food is consistently excellent. Fresh baked sesame bread straight from the wood oven. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We had a pleasure to meet Mr. Eskandari the owner and his friendly and professional staff. We enjoyed the food very very much as they were very tasty and delicious. The service and environment were just great.

   I do appreciate Mr. Eskandari's support as we were traveling from US to Canada and when we landed at the airport and started to search on yelp for restaurants and found Zaffron.  I remember I called him three times and asked for the direction, reservation, and menu .. and he answered them all patiently and when we walked in I realized I was talking to the owner all three times. This nice attitude comes from his confidence and work ethic he has and the great service he offers.  We will come back soon in our next trip to Canada in July and enjoy the restaurant, food and meet him again."}
{"text":"This restaurant was very disappointing. Absolutely horrible service with our waiter who constantly gave us the excuse that the slow service was due to the restaurant being very busy even though we can physically see that there were only 3 other tables and there were 4 waiters so that made no sense at all. Waited 20 minutes for them to refill our water and almost an hour to get our food. 

I wouldve rated it 1 star if it wasn't for their passable food. The eggplant was pretty good, a bit on the sweeter side. The main meat dishes were just okay. Pretty average persian food. They have a promotion going on with Yelp so if you want to try it then I'd recommend taking advantage of the deal but I would honestly just spend my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Love the food and service. I give them an A++. Overall I would recommend the Zaffron Chicken. Impeccable food. All waiters are great also get Zaffron Bread. Homemade oven baked. Go to Zaffron or you will miss out. Ignore all bad reviews because they are lies."}
