{"text":"First he wouldn't honor my restaurant.com coupon I paid for. Says he don't use them.yet he does nothing for them to stop. Food was a bit salty and was suppose to have red palm oil in both leave dishes but seems to be alot more vegetable oil. Chicken tasted like it was rotisserie so it lacked the true seasoning from the stew. Hope I find a different african restaurant before I leave"}
{"text":"Not bad. Their menu is reminiscent of the Cheesecake Factory menu, but a little smaller. And they have Pink's hot dogs. I didn't get the hot dogs after hearing bad things about them--tough skin, hard dog. I chose a caesar salad, and it was ok. The chicken was VERY dry, so I took those out and just ate the romaine lettuce. We went around 6pm, and there was no line.
I think they're open 24hrs, if you need a fix during the wee hrs of the mornin."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Charlotte thus far. I'm Nigerian so naturally I enjoy most African cuisine but this was my first time trying Liberian food. I literally order the same thing every time: Grilled Whole Tilapia with corned beef rice and plantain. Their tilapia is HUGE and grilled to perfection and the rice and plantain is pretty perfect as well. Their spicy sauces are amazing and their cassava stew is as well. Would highly recommend. :)"}
{"text":"My low score is only because I was delivered the wrong food. What I received turned out to be very good, just not what I wanted. I finally got my food and it was good.  Worth going back, I'll just pick it up myself. So food wise, very good."}
{"text":"Great food. Lots of selection. Big Portion. A great alternative to their buffet."}
{"text":"I came here to eat Pink's hot dog and it is like the Pink's in L.A. however instead of standing in line forever and scamming for a open seat. Just a warning the jalapenos are excruciating HOT. I can eat really really spicy food like so spicy steam is blowing out of my ears, however I don't know why I couldn't stand the jalapenos on my hot dog. I'm a little ashamed. 

The rest of the menu is almost exactly like Cheesecake Factory. They do have pho here but it is $12 which is the most I've ever paid including Hawaii.  I can't complain because why would anyone go to Zanzibar for pho?"}
{"text":"I came here for the Pink's hot dog and wasn't too impressed.  It doesn't even compare to Pink's hot dogs in LA.  It just DOESN'T.  One thing familiar - the excruciatingly long line.  We ended up opting to eat in the smoking section, just to get to the front of the line.  It worked, but the dogs just weren't the same..."}
{"text":"Great customer service! Rich was at the front counter and he was very pleasant, welcoming and professional. The food was hot and fresh and the atmosphere was great! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Like many others, I came here for the Pink's hot dog. Also like many others I was disappointed that it was nothing like LA's Pink's.

There wasn't a line up getting in and normally I would be thrilled.  If only I knew it was a result of this place being pretty crummy.  The service stunk.  There was never anyone around.  Our waiter apparently went on his break without telling another waiter to tend to us.  It took forever to get the bill.

I'd avoid this place."}
{"text":"I was so not impressed with Zanzibar Cafe.   We ate here sometime around midnight on a Friday night... It's certainly not very busy.  There might be a grand total of 5 tables with seated patrons.

So I ordered some crab wontons, a grilled cheese sandwich, and a fruit smoothie.   Now granted I was pretty drunk by that point so the memories are more like mental flashes or pictures.   The fruit smoothie tasted damn good and the only recollection of why I ordered it is that I could sense that I'd deprived my body of vitamins for quite a while and I was trying to combat the evil effects of blackjack table side martinis, of which I must have had five or six.   So 4 stars or hell, even 5 stars for the smoothie!

However, the grilled cheese sandwich was pretty sad and the crab wontons were as well.   All in all, I thought the food was about the equivalent to that of Denny's.   The tab, however, was way higher than Denny's.

Since you're in Vegas and everything has become seriously overpriced in this City, you probably could do worse, but I simply cannot give more than 3 stars to an establishment that gives you Denny's size portions and quality and charges three times more for it."}
{"text":"Jollof Rice Day fell on a Monday, so I stopped in at Zanzibar when I remembered Mama Gees isn't open  on Mondays. Expecting disappointment (Ghanaiian jollof rice is supreme), I was pleasantly surprised. The spot is clean and modern though tiny, the specials are clearly listed with a good explanation for the uninitiated and the service was friendly. Food is cooked to order so expect about a 10-minute wait, but the big screen TV is always on the news so you can argue while  you wait. The jollof is plentiful, full of chicken and veggies and has that yummy home made taste and is NOT dry. Love it, and will be coming back for my fix whenever the jones hits me."}
{"text":"I chanced upon this place when I was looking for vouchers on Restaurant.com.
This place is small, and the menu is small - but bear in mind that everything on the menu is a delight to your taste buds. The food is very unique and while I've only never been to Africa mmyself, i would trust this to be authentic since the food was rich in flavor and I honestly hadn't experienced this before.
Off all of my favorites were the Rotisserie chicken, the Fish, the fried yuca (was v v good) and this other green sauce with turkey and chicken served with brown rice.

I strongly recommend this place."}
{"text":"As a Liberian and a chef, I highly recommend this restaurant. I had the torborgee on Monday and it was delicious! Keep in mind that it's SPICY and I eat ghost peppers in everything. I went back on Wednesday and got the fufu & Palm butter and beef kabobs. The Palm butter was once again great and I'd eat it again. The kabobs where nothing to remember though. I don't live in Charlotte, but I'm definitely be back the next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Sent my husband for African food off N Tryon and he past my go to and found this restaurant instead.  Cassava Leaf stew did not have the same consistency as the other restaurant and the chicken and turkey parts were far from tender.  Fish was very good."}
{"text":"Originally im from Congo - Kinshasa...and was excited to learn about Zanzibars opening...while eating a dish i felt the authenticity...Zanzibar is official..."}
