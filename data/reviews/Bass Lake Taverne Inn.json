{"text":"Stopped for blues and barbecue. Excellent event. Great food. Great staff. Loved being outside with the live music. Didn't want to leave. But eventually you have to go home."}
{"text":"Bass Lake Tavern was selected by my boyfriend, and it ended up being my favorite dining experience of the year.  I enjoyed the lodge/ cabin decor, there was not a long wait on a Friday night, and it was unique and interesting compared to predictable chain restaurants.  We had a great server, and the menu offered several things I would have liked to try.  Dinner entrees were about $18-$24.  My meal was very good; better than I expected.  They serve fresh baked bread with dinner, and that was amazing as well.   I ordered the Seared Beef Tenderloin \"Oscar\" (fresh asparagus, lump crabmeat & bearnaise sauce, cabernet demi glace & crisp potato croquette for $18.95).  I loved it!  I am looking forward to returning here again!  Update (6/23/12):  Went back again with my now fiance, and we had another 5 star experience.  We chose to sit on the patio, and had perfect weather.  It's beautiful outside and that alone would be worth coming back.  I was weak and went for the same meal which sounded soooo good again, but my fiance tried something new and that was the \"Cedar Planked Atlantic Salmon with corn, chile & fresh dill relish; roasted butternut squash with maple pecan butter 22.95.\"  He says:  \"The salmon was extremely tasty and the smokey cedar flavor permeated it nicely.\"  I tasted it as well, and decided I have never had wood smoked fish ever taste so good!  Loved it, and will be back again!"}
{"text":"Anytime of year, this is my favorite place to dine in Chardon. The homey atmosphere and welcoming wait staff make dining a wonderful experience. Owner, Eric, could not make guests feel more welcome. Seasonal items are always a treat. Only recommendation would be to keep the summertime terrace music volume lower. No amplifiers needed!"}
{"text":"We had a great romantic anniversary dinner.  It was a great atmosphere and perfect for a special occasion.  It was the most moist turkey that I have ever had!"}
{"text":"Great food and service! Salmon cake was delicious!  Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Very noisy place. Saturday night. A couple large groups.   Food was mediocre at best. Definitely overpriced."}
{"text":"After going back again and again, I have to say that every time I go to BLT I am satisfied.  Big fan and worth the update to 4 stars.  The kitchen is consistently putting out some great food now and a happy to have this place in Chardon."}
{"text":"Wow.  Thought it would be a great sweetest day dinner.  Sucked.  Raw lobster tails.  Raw steak.  Ordered medium got rare.  Sent it back still raw.  Mgr tried to patronize us and said the food was cooked properly.  Slimy mess"}
{"text":"Very good food. The patio is beautiful. Crab cakes and calamari appetizers were delicious. The beef tenderloin Oscar was delicious.  The trio of desserts were a perfect way to end the meal for the 3 of us!"}
{"text":"Recommend sticking with steak or appetizers/drinks only here. I like to order fish but even when I request the wait staff ask that my fish not be over cooked, it is served well done. New Year's Eve I took another chance and ordered the walleye.  I was disappointed it was tough and dry. My husband ordered the steak and he said it was delicious. They do make creative cocktails. They had a champagne mule which had tart cranberries and champagne mixed with ginger beer.  We enjoyed it. Service was good. It was a very busy night buwait staff was hustling.   If you are in the mood for a fish dish you may be disappointed but overall a good place to stop for a burger or steak when you are in the Chardon area. Nice patio in the summer."}
{"text":"Drove way the hell out to Chardon for no reason and remembered  Bass Lake. It's still decent- cool looking building and a pretty square no frills menu- had a filet with some weird sauce- mid rare and came out perfect- the sauce was off putting though. With 1 app 2 entrees and 1 desert it came out to $78 plus $22 for the tip. So.... Not really a deal but you should stay at home if your broke I guess. Or don't- who cares"}
{"text":"Easily the best restaurant in Geauga County. I don't give it five stars because that is reserved for places like Cut and Spago and such, but that doesn't mean I find this less enjoyable. The food is very good and the seasonal cocktails are fun (and yummy!). The atmosphere is warm and rustic with a cozy fireplace. The cedar plank salmon is muy delicioso and the butternut squash with maple syrup butter is to die for (and you will, if you try to take a bite of mine!). Prices don't seem high at all to me, but I live in LA where you can run up a tab of $300 for two people without much effort :)"}
{"text":"I think the place is a local favorite and is usually filled to capacity on weekends. I've eaten here several times and consider it hit or miss I've enjoyed some wonderful entrees and some that were surprisingly bad this was mostly regarding the fish specials so I stay away from those options. The staff has always been friendly and attentive but my most memorable visits came from simply sitting at the bar with friends and enjoying simple appetizers, drinks and good conversation. This is a excellent stop after playing a round of golf for a light snack and a refreshing drink. I would not go out of my way to travel here but if your close by it's a good choice for the area."}
{"text":"First time there for happy hour.  Half price appetizers are smaller than usual in size. At least the pulled pork nachos.  Regular portion is large but the happy hour portion was small and mainly all chips missing a lot of pulled pork and toppings.  Not a deal.  Also ordered short rib dinner which was tasty but small portion for the price.  They serve the food on smaller plates so you think you are getting more.   It's a shame because the food is pretty good, efficient and friendly service and they have a great patio.  I will try happy hour again and review."}
{"text":"Went there for NY eve dinner. Waited 20 mins for water. Our waitress then took our order (apps and entrée). The soup and salad came out in a timely fashion. Not half way through our apps the entrées were on the table. The lamb shank I ordered was dry and mildly warm. You could tell it had been sitting out. The lobster was fair. Both plates piled with potatoes.   This was not a good experience at all. Dinner was $100 that i wish i had back."}
{"text":"Definitely try to go in the summer months to take advantage of the beautiful patio.  I've only gotten the southwest chicken salad, but I love it so much I can't see myself wanting to try anythine else.  The cilantro and corn relish give this a great flavor, I get it without the cheese as I don't need the unnecessary calories when the salad has such a good flavor without it!  Servers are friendly, it can get crowded though but it's understandable.  Fast service, enough so that my co-workers and I can go for lunch and not rush.  Their portions are a good size for the price, too."}
{"text":"I stopped patronizing Bass Lake because their service lacks for the high prices they charge. They assign their bartenders tables to wait on plus the people sitting at the bar. If U luck out n get in the bartender's section, don't plan on getting very good service. They dont seem to really care if your expensive meal is not right. And if you're sitting in the bartender's section, you won't see them again to complain."}
{"text":"I saw the \"Let It Snow\" deal online and wanted to have an early anniversary surprise for my husband, so I took it.  We checked in at the restaurant and dropped off our things. We decided to get something to eat before the restaurant closed.   The restaurant has a great atmosphere and is comfortable. The fireplace is great, but we were seated by a drafty window and as people left it started to get too cold.  The food was good. We have pulled pork nachos (almost not enough toppings) the flank steak, the steak oscar, a salad (ranch dressing is great), the caramel custard (super sweet, but great), and the tollhouse cookie pie (it's massive!). I will say that the online menu is a little out of date and that made me sad that they don't have brussell sprouts. the server was really nice, but at every step (app, salad, main course, dessert) we were waiting and looking around for her. We probably would have left a good 20 minutes earlier if she would have been attentive. The prices were a little high for what we got (especially the drinks!), but with the deal, it was very reasonable. (3 stars for dinner)  Now for the room. It looked great, even if the bathroom was dated. The fireplace was nice and there was a balcony that would be great in the summer. The \"breakfast\" was some cereal and coffee in a basket. Definitely not what I was thinking. Decided to take a shower and then check out the jacuzzi, but couldn't because we ran out of hot water. The water was really hard and I didn't feel clean afterwards. We also didn't have wash clothes and that sucked. The heater in the unit couldn't decide if it was going to be on or not, so it was constantly making noise. We could hear tons of noise and just couldn't sleep. I thought the bed as super squishy and pretty comfy. My husband thought it was hard and hated it. The sheets were scratchy. After trying to sleep for a few hours, we decided to just drive home. (1 star)  Now, what makes it 1 star for the whole experience was the next morning. I emailed the address I had from the reservation that we weren't spending the night. I called them to let them know in the morning as well. I didn't go into every issue (I just stuck with the noise and that we didn't spend the night), but she didn't ask any questions. She basically just said that she'd tell the manager. It's been 5 hours with no call back or anything. I'm not looking for a refund, but something that would make me want to give them a second chance (even for the restaurant!)"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, you want to like this place - it has a good vibe on the outside. We live nearby and have been here a few times with not much luck. We were given a gift certificate for our wedding, so we decided to give it another try.   When you walk into the place it smells musty - like your Grandfather's basement. It's not a good smell and kinda makes you think if the place is clean or not. We ate on the tavern side and on a weeknight (around 6) there were three couples at the bar that were pretty liquoured up and being pretty loud.  We had the crab cakes as an appetizer since they were half price. Normally two crab cakes are $12 - seems kind of pricey. They were good... although my wife is from Maryland and said these were not \"traditional\" crab cakes. Again, they were good, but I wouldn't buy them for $12.  The corner they put us in was dark and seemed to attract flies and fruit flies. Keep in mind it's Fall here, so flies and fruit flies at this time of year are rare.  My wife said her steak was like a shoe, the vegetables were ice cold and the crab they put on her potato was still frozen. So let's face it - the cook they have there is amatuer at best.  Did I mention the musty smell?  We had two beers, a small pasta salad, the crab cakes, a steak & potato and a piece of cheesecake - $68 w/o the tip.  Save your money and don't go here - if you do, remember I told you about the smell."}
{"text":"This review is a day after eating.   Meal was so good I went right to bed afterward.   They finished me off with a dessert sampler."}
{"text":"Went here while on business trip to Cleveland. The drive over was worth it. Really quaint place with ski lodge vibe, cozy, wooded and great food. Got the catch of the day and even a lobster quesadilla. Wish the beer menu was a bit stronger, but it's probably more of a wine place anyway.  Definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our lunch today!! The Loaded Baked Potato soup was AMAZING!!  We are definitely coming back here!!"}
{"text":"Last night was our 5th visit for dinner in the last 2 years at this restaurant.  The previous four visits were all very good--both service and food quality   But not last night.  Everything was going fine until I received my entree a grilled pork chop.  I tried to cut it with a table knife to no avail.  I had to hail another server to please bring me a steak knife.  A few minutes later our server came by and asked if everything was OK.  I had just succeeded,after much effort, in cutting off an edge piece which was tough and very dry.  I told her if the inner part was as tough and dry I did not want it.  By the way, it was not cheap--I think close to $28 so I anticipated something spectacular.  The inner section was just as dry and almost as tough so I motioned our server that it was not acceptable.  She said she would sent a manager to our table.  He came a few minutes later and it seemed like he was more interested in debating the issue with me rather than apologizing. He said more than once I was the first person who ever complained about this entree. Finally, he did offer to take it off our bill, and I did order another fish entree. But I was still so upset that I hardly ate any of it.    Neither he nor our waitress ever said they were sorry. We will not be going back"}
{"text":"My husband and I stayed at Bass Lake Inn for New Year's Eve 2017. We had a great time! It was beautiful with snow everywhere and since we purchased through Groupon we had a $50 dinner voucher. Upon arrival they recommended we make a reservation for dinner (probably because it was New Year's Eve) so you may want to consider making a reservation in advance if you know you are going to eat at the Taverne. We had an AWESOME dinner and loved the fireplace in our room that turns on with just the switch of a button and the amazing jet jacuzzi tub!"}
{"text":"Ordered their fish special to be split with my mom who is 94 and eats like a bird. Two other people at the table had regular meals. The entree was brought to the table with two plates for me to split. My mom is always included in our dinners out and we always go to nice restaurants. I have never had to split the entree at the table. Fish is slippery and delicate and it was basically a mess. The grain that came with the fish was cold. If that was intentional it was not a good decision on the chef's part. Hot fish and cold accompaniment are a bad combo. On the plus side, the food was good."}
{"text":"Had lunch here on a business trip recently.  Not sure why so many mediocre reviews, the food was great!  I had a 1/2 sandwich and upgraded to the garlic fries which is a MUST.  The check was a little slow in coming, but we were a large group, so I can't blame the waitress. Everyone enjoyed their meal, would def eat here again when back in the area."}
{"text":"We stayed at the Inn and dined here. Both were great!  We had the NY Strip Steak and mashed potatoes. The steak was cooked to perfection! Service was great as well! We will return on our next trip to Chardon!"}
{"text":"It was great to get out to Chardon on a summer evening. Bass Lake Taverne's patio is a beautiful setting to eat outdoors. We shared a dinner salad that was very fresh and a good size to share, but the dressing wasn't particularly memorable. My wife had the pork tenderloin entre and I had the goat cheese and sundried tomato chicken. Both were cooked very well and well seasoned. I was very impressed with the chicken, if you have ever had grilled chicken with cheese and tomato it is usually watery and rubbery, this wasn't. The way the goat cheese melted with the seasonings made a nice, thick, rich sauce. The side of angel hair was not over cooked or overly oiled to season.    We skipped dessert but there were several options that looked great. About the only problem with the evening was the mosquitos enjoyed us about as much as we enjoyed the food."}
{"text":"The Inn Lovely quaint alternative to chains. 12 modern rooms with nice beds, fireplace, and Jacuzzi. Perfect one or two night getaway for the city life.  Taverne The food is wonderful fare and has been very consistent. Staff is very friendly and accommodating .   Great place for a weekend getaway! My guess is the best place to go in Geauga County for a lovely room and good food!"}
{"text":"It's my favorite place to go for special occcasions.  It's been there for 1000 years.   I am not a seafood fan, and they have a lot of it.  However I normally get the filet medallions.  They'll swap out whatever you want (twiced baked for mashed) and it's great food.  A little hot next to the fire though.  Drinks are spotty, depends on the bartender. Have had to send them back on more than one occasion."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Bass Lake Inn in Chardon - sister restaurant to Gamekeeper's Tavern in Chagrin Falls; a restaurant we frequent.  It was a Tuesday night on which Valentine's Day fell and the place was crowded - parking lot absolutely packed, all tables and bar occupied, and a line waiting to get in.  Good thing I made reservations about 2 weeks prior!  I enjoyed their Surf & Turf - one of their Valentine's Day dinner specials.  It was absolutely exquisite because days, even weeks later I'm still raving about it!  I've never had Surf & Turf like this - the lobster was not served whole-tail, rather already cut up into pieces.  When it arrived at the table I thought two things: \"cheapskates!\" and \"uh oh, this is gonna be dry!\"  Boy was I wrong!  The lobster was cooked perfectly - tender, juicy, and absolutely full of flavor.  I don't know what they sauteed the lobster chunks in but it was truly delicious!  Not chewy, not drenched in drippy butter... perfect!  And the beef filet was full of flavor, too!  5-stars from me!  Unfortunately, my wife didn't care too much for her walleye dinner.  She said it wasn't horrible but it didn't leave a lasting impression.  In fact she doesn't want to come back to Bass Lake Inn because of her meal which is a shame because I loved my dinner!  If I had any complaints about tonight's meal it would be that the dessert.  We had their Red Velvet Cake - one of my favorites and another Valentine's Day special - but found it dry/overbaked.  (Velvet Cake should never be crumbly!)  Also, the portions overall seem to be just a tad undersized for the money.    The decor is very country tavern themed and there is a cozy, cabin feel even though the restaurant itself is quite huge.  I loved the old timber ceiling beams, the fireplace mantle, and the warm and rustic decor.  All in all, however, I found Bass Lake Inn to be a delicious dinner experience and would give it 5-stars (even with the overdone cake and the smaller portion size for the money spent)!  Lose a star for disappointing my wife, however.  TIP: On a cold day, restaurant seems to have some hot & cold spots.  I suggest staying away from sitting next to the windows (we saw one couple complain and move).  And unless you are perpetually cold, stay away from the fireplace (all we were missing was the spit!)."}
{"text":"I want to love this place, but I can't. I have been here many times, but my recent experience was my last.... sadly. It is too expensive to roll the dice on the food and the service -- highly inconsistent.  The Positives: It is in a great setting. In the winter the dining room is cozy and comfortable. In the summer, the outdoor patio is lovely. The menu is standard fare with a lot of inviting choices.  Needs Improvement: The service is often lacking. I went with some friends last week and the place was empty. (We had even considered going somewhere else when we saw there was no one in the parking lot.)   We were one of three parties in the entire restaurant and the service was poor... at best.  Very inattentive.  On top of that, my husband's fish came out ice cold. Now, I don't know how busy the kitchen could have been!  We waited a considerable period of time and they finally did bring out a new piece with only the most perfunctory apology.  This experience was not the first. Matter of fact, I called once to complain and got a lukewarm response. I can only assume the management is not on top of their game, as it seems like no one in the restaurant is ever in charge.  There is an odd musty smell when you enter the lobby of the restaurant....extremely off putting.  To be fair, I have been here when food and service were fine.  Unfortunately, you never know and either way, you are going to spend quite a bit of money.  Not worth taking a chance.  P.S. Did I mentioned the fly that was buzzing around our heads the entire meal :( Ewww......"}
{"text":"Tiny portions of extremely average, at best, food. Nice patio. We tried the pulled pork nachos. They had about 0.5 oz of pulled pork. Plate size, 6x6. Disappointing. Spicy Chicken Bowl tasted like boiled, 3 day old chicken that had no spices added at all.  Tiny portion for $13?  No thank you. Avocado Toast was small, but tasty. Butter for the bread tasted old. Sweet potato fries portion only covered half the plate. The poor waitress!  I'm sure she was embarrassed serving it. Bottled beer with only two offerings in tap. Left hungry and unsatisfied. Tab (3 beers and four appetizers/small portion plates) $66.00.   Seriously?"}
{"text":"Dinner tonight with a few girlfriends. My first time here.  Excellent!  I ordered off the small plates menu, marinated flank steak, wasabi potatoes and asparagus.  I will be bringing my husband here in the near future.  The dining room is very cozy.  Very nice place."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful dining experience.  Exceptional service, great menu, amazing cuisine, and delicious home made desserts.    Do not miss the opportunity to dine here.  I am not easily impressed by restaurants anymore, this one is worth the check total!"}
{"text":"still great food and service, but they must loose the non-dimable cfl bulbs over the booths asap.  horrible for the atmosphere."}
{"text":"I went for early dinner with my significant other and ordered BBQ nachos and their burger of the day(hawaiin burger).  Both were fantastic and the waitress was spectacular as well.  The patio area is particularly quaint, which is not surprising considering the city it's located in."}
{"text":"Fine dining meets casual little rustic restaurant.  What an interesting place.  When my family and I got there this weekend, there were a bunch of people at the bar, decorated to the max with deer heads, but no one in the dining room.  The waitress excitedly welcomed us and told us she'd have to turn on the lights.  Sure it was early (4:30pm) but that struck me as kind of odd.  She let us pick whatever table we wanted, and casually threw a few napkin-wrapped silverware sets into the center of the table, and passed out some appetizer plates roughly where the seats were.  While she did that, I admired the fireplace in the center of the room, while frowning at the stuffed squirrels hanging out on the mantle (the squirrel is my sorority mascot).  The menu was totally drool-worthy though, and most meals were $20 or more - I felt that the menu did not match the place.  The food was absolutely awesome though.  I got a big salmon fillet atop a cedar plank (literally on a piece of cooked wood) along with some interesting corn chili relish and a giant butternut squash with pecan maple butter.  It was to die for."}
{"text":"Came for Easter lunch. Menu was cute, and had normal Easter dishes. The pork roast and mash potatoes were great. Bloody marry was not the best. Homemade bread was very good. Staff was very kind, and we got our food very quickly for the large size party we had. We would return."}
{"text":"Went for a late spring lunch with the fam. Great service and fresh, delish dishes. Patio was relaxing. Will be sure to return."}
{"text":"We met friends there last friday evening. I have never seen so many people there. The parking lot was so full we had to park on the grass next door. Just as we thought,  the patio was a 90 minute wait because it was a perfect evening to sit outdoors. We chose to go inside and wait at the bar until a table was ready.  It took less than 5 minutes and we were seated. we were amazed. Although our drinks were a little slow in coming we can't fault our waitress because the place was so busy.   We have eaten here many times and the food is consistently excellent, that is why we took the chance it may be a long wait. We were not disapointed. I had the filet mignon and I almost could cut it with a fork. Everyone else ordered the halibut special and they all raved how good it was.   This is the place in the area to go if you want to be sure that your meal  is going to be outstanding!"}
{"text":"Very good for Sunday Brunch I had Lobster hash with eggs, excellent My wife had crab pattie Benedict, also excellent drinks were. Good  Will come back"}
{"text":"Brett and I love this restaurant. Always good food, special events are the best and atmosphere is fun!"}
{"text":"A simple quaint inn, not too stylish but a nice place still. The restaurant is designed very well with large wooden pillars and a solid stone accent background on some of the walls in certain rooms. The dinner here was very amazing, the Mediterranean salad was so full of flavor and freshness with 9 different toppings so crisp and light. The dressing was great along with the lettuce that they grow hydroponically. It was topped with orzo, cucumber, squash, feta cheese and zucchini.   We went here for dinner one night and lunch the next day. Our livingsocial deal included 1 night stay for $108 and a $50 dining credit. So since we bought 2 nights we had $100 to spend on food. The prices here were decent for dinner but we had to order extra food for lunch. For dinner I ordered Mussels, a small Medi salad and the mac n cheese with a lobster cream sauce. Hubby ordered a beef tenderloin and crabcake dinner with a side of sauteed mushrooms. I'm not really into beef but the tenderloin was very mushy, is that normal? The crab cake was great with awesome seasoning. So I mentioned how great the salad was but the mac n cheese and mussels were a little short of the mark. The mussels were perfectly cooked but the wine sauce lacked that robust garlic flavor and could have used a little more salt. The mac n cheese was very upsetting because it wasn't as cheesy as I wanted to it be. I tasted too much noodle and not enough cheese. It was topped with some kind of crumbly topping that added some flavor but it didn't do enough justice. We ended up only taking a few bites and boxing the rest. I cooked it later in a kitchen we had at the next place we stayed. Made it special adding some extra milk and cheese for flavor. It was a lot better then.  Lunch on the other hand was fantastic. Big compliments to the chef. I ordered the large Mediterranean salad....again....and a BBQ pulled pork sandwich (extra BBQ) as well as a side of egg salad. The hubby ordered a balsamic salad and some seared tilapia. My sandwich was perfectly toasted on warm ciabatta bread and the pulled pork was shredded very nicely with enough sauce. The sandwich came with a side of fries which were perfectly crispy and the egg salad was creamy but not overly eggy. I loved it!! The hubby loved his balsamic salad so sweet and crispy. I loved the cherry tomatoes some of the best and freshest I've tasted. The tilapia was small but had great flavor and the rice that came with it was good but nothing amazing. Our waitress was great and the service was quick and courteous.  So the room we stayed in was a nice modern room. It came with a kitchenette, no stove, but it did have a mini fridge, microwave, sink and a coffee maker. The fridge was perfect for storing our beers and left over food. Plus we picked up a few snacks on the way down. The bathroom had a jacuzzi tub/shower and had a large mirror about 6x6 ft large. Only downside is that it only had one sink but lots of countertop space. It almost seamed a waste to have all that countertop space but most of it was not needed.  The large king size bed was very plush and soft with extra pillows. We had a large closet, long dresser, dining table with two chairs and 2 sofa chairs that sat directly in front of the fire place. It was very nice and cozy having the fireplace on while watching Tv. Only down side to this room is that it had no DVD player and the cable wasn't in HD or in too clear shape so we bought a DVD player and hooked it up. All in all our stay here was very nice. I only wish the walls between the floors was thicker because the couple above would play music extremely loud for like an hour every night and when they checked out @ 7am, it took them 40 minutes to pack up before all the noise stopped. I seem to have this problem everywhere I go. I will definitely come back here even if it's just to dine."}
{"text":"I saw lots of good reviews here on Yelp and decided to try it out for my Mom's BD party.  My first observation upon arrival was that of no other cars in the parking lot. Never a good sign. We were seated promptly and found the surroundings cozy and warm.  Waitress was ok, not overly friendly, but ok.  There were seven of us and we started out with drinks.  Seemed to take a while to get them, but that was ok as we were in no hurry.    My wife's margarita was wonderful and it seemed everyone was ok with their drink order.  We ordered two appetizers, the crab and artichoke dip and vegetable bruschetta.  Neither my wife or I could taste any flavor in the dip, and the bruschetta was pretty and had a sweet flavor.  On that one, it was just not my style. We ordered various entrees, and at prices that vary from 20 to 30 bucks one would expect outstanding food and that is not what we received.   Several of the steak dishes were tough or overcooked.  My twice baked potato with a lobster sauce was very light on flavor.  Seemed no one at our table was impressed with their dishes and mostly were disappointed, especially considering the prices. It's not a place I would return to, nor recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Bass Lake Tavern is one of my favorite restaurants.  Just went there for lunch today and had my favorite dish, horseradish crusted salmon. Yum! It is served with mashed potatoes and sautéed vegetables.  The soup of the day was ham and cabbage soup with a cream base.  It was out of this world, and the home made bread that they serve with all meals was perfect for dipping. The servers at Bass Lake have always been so friendly and helpful. Great atmosphere at this restaurant.  The food is consistently exceptional.  Perfect for a special occasion, especially when  the weather is good and you can enjoy the outdoor patio."}
{"text":"Great ambiance. Stayed at the inn and got dinner. Wish they had more vegetarian options for main courses. Food was well cooked and they had some nice happy hour specials that we took advantage of before checking in."}
{"text":"There were several pieces of RAW  bacon in my fried green tomato salad. When I sent it back, the response was that I just got a fatty piece of bacon. There was nothing wrong. Uncooked bacon is wrong in my book. Pretentious and overpriced. Bland at best."}
