{"text":"Quite by accident I stumbled upon the annual Brampton Rotary Rib N Roll while visiting te flower city for a tour of the city with other Yelepers as part of our DIscover GTA series. What better way to Discover Brampton then to attend this annual festival of Music, Ribs, Community, Ribs, food and activity vendors, MORE RIBS.... and oh ya Ribs! All tucked inside the confines of Gage Park. I'll keep my comments about how great a park I think Gage is (like a microcosm of Central Park in NYC, just much much much smaller....and in Brampton).

Upon entry there is no cover charge BUT anything you can donate as part of your entry is welcomed. A main stage has the country music (yechhh - not a fan) pumping and the pathway around the park is lined with vendors dolling everything from food, wares, drinks and services. There is a designated 19+ alcohol section which you are ID'd and tagged for at the door and the main reason we are all here -the ribbers. God bless them all. However I was present to see one Rib wonder and one rib wonder alone - Brampton's very own RD's Smokehouse. 

You can't buy rib's directly from  the vendors, you need to first line up and buy your tickets from the rotary ticket booth. $12 for a 1/2 rack and $22 for a full. I went for a 1/2 rack and it was more than suffice. 

it's another yer until the next RnR but I'll be back with hungry eyes and napkin in hand.

Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"I've been to this a couple of times. It's always a good outdoor activity, with stuff for kids to do, and bands playing, and of course, ribs! My only issue is that the ribs are served in large portions. Since it's a festival it would be good to get one- or two-rib samplers or quarter racks maybe. It's too pricey to try many varieties as it stands, and even if you want to spend the money on a big assortment you'd have too many leftovers! 

Anyhow, a fun activity for the entire family in beautiful downtown Brampton. Keep your eye out for this one!"}
{"text":"This is a fun event we go to every year. Every year they add more \"stuff\" . Things to see and to go. I think however there should be more than just The 3-5 food vendors that are there - more food trucks and other food items. Also the lineups can be ridiculously long and as the days progress the drunks get a but more obnoxious. Overall a good event but one that has much room to improve."}
