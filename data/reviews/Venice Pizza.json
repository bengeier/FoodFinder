{"text":"Best pizza, wings, and antipasto salad!! Always fresh and always polite!! Wish they stayed open later tho."}
{"text":"I used to live at arroyo apts right across the steeet I liked their food if u live I  this area its very convenient and a good change from burger king and the norm. itz not olive garden but def. good food. and quick for a last minute idea"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza! In Arizona, the land of sub par food choices, it was amazing to find a good pizza place after 10 years of looking. Normal pizza, not New York cracker crust, not Chicago soup pie, just a decent crust! Generous with the toppings,  willing to make any weird combos I come up with. Wings are fantastic as well, the hot isn't exactly hot. But it is a nice standard \"hot wing\". Surprisingly their pasta is a good choice as well, beat the usual valley chain restaurants. If your a snob, the decor and atmosphere will not please you but if you hail from.places that have real pizza parlours you will indeed find what you have been looking for!"}
{"text":"Absolutely hands down the best pizza spot . I got a calzone and realized I could feed 2 people from it. The pricing is amazing and a great value they have my business any time I'm near ."}
{"text":"the hours of business are 11am - 9pm! delivery orders wont been taken after 8:30pm also please check to see if deliver in your neighborhood!!!  ~ tips always nice   best wings ever. youre welcome."}
{"text":"This place is quite literally right around the corner from us so we decided to check it out. We got a ranch pizza, a 5 cheese pizza, and a side order of garlic cheese bread.  The ranch pizza was ok, nothing special. The cheese bread was good. The 5 cheese pizza was really good.  They were pretty busy when we went in but they were very nice. We've heard their chicken wings are amazing so we'll be trying those next."}
{"text":"Amazing food!  The have the best wings in all of Arizona!  They are a bit pricey, but their food makes up for it.  You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"You wouldn't think the pizza was good by their hole in the wall restaurant. But the pizza is amazing."}
{"text":"Really great Pizza and Wings! Don't waste your money on the trashy chains. Try these guys, their local and they use fresh and real ingredients."}
{"text":"No website link..so can't see a menu.  Called number during posted hours and no answer."}
{"text":"They left a flyer on my door, and they seemed cheap and they delivered, so I thought \"what the heck?\"...... No.  I ordered, waited an hour for my food.  When it hadn't shown up by then, I called to ask what was going on.  No answer.  I called and called and called.  No answer.  And they were still open according to this flyer.  Never got the food, never got a call, nothing.  Granted, they didn't charge me, but if they weren't going to show up they could have let me know rather than just letting me think it was on it's way.  I have no idea what happened, and I don't care to.  I will never order from this place again.  It was sad too, because the girl who took my order seemed very nice and pleasant.  But never again."}
{"text":"Seriously Great Pizza and Wings.  It is not gourmet, nor is it supposed to be.  (That is why 4 instead of 5 stars)      It is delicious, fast and the folks there are friendly.  On my way now to get me some!"}
{"text":"Venice is the best pizza in town by far the flavors of their pizza and wings Subs calzones salads anything they  are to-die-for conveniently located near 47th Avenue and Maryland ever in the mood for any of these items try Venice Pizza"}
{"text":"Best place for pizza and wings hands down!!the pizza is always perfect and the wings hot sauce is hot but not too hot and they're always very crispy!!,but it's more of a takeout place the actual restaurant is small and not a comfortable place to eat but other than that ...Perfect!!!"}
{"text":"The pizza is very good here. I love the wings and the submarine sub. It's also affordable they have many specials. Next time I wanna try the pastas"}
{"text":"We don't usually visit this side of the valley but we were in the area to watch a flick at the drive in. Found this place on Yelp they had good reviews and decided to give it a try. Not going to lie the location is a bit sketchy and from the outside would have never eaten there but so happy we did! We ordered the Coyote. It was delicious!! All ingredients were fresh, vegetables were sliced and cooked perfectly and it was not greasy at all. Sorry I forgot to take a photo we gobbled it up before I thought of doing so. The staff was friendly and had our pizza ready within the time they told us it would be ready. Prices are very reasonable. Will definitely be back next time we are in the area :)"}
{"text":"THIS IS THE BEST ITALIAN PIZZA ive had so far!! its nothing like the regular delivery.. they have many specials. you call them and ask them for their specials and ofccourse they will tell you.. you can taste the oregano  in the cheese but its not overwhelming. I highly recommend this pizza.. this is what i usually get {{LG 14\" pepperoni +12 wings + 2 sodas $14.50}}"}
{"text":"Great pizza and wings.. We always stop here before we hit the drive in movies. It was hot and ready when we came for it. It taste great like what pizza should taste like in my opinion. The wings were crispy and saucy just how I like them."}
{"text":"This place is terrible. If you're looking for good pizza don't come here. Seriously. I almost never write bad reviews. But I do take the time if a business is outstanding.   First impression was terrible. I had to wait to order because the staff were fighting with themselves. A girl was trying to take an order for delivery and one of the cooks was telling her no. Apparently that customer had complained about her last order (wonder why)so the cook didn't wanna serve her again. That should've been a sign to go somewhere else but I had just finished moving and was starving.   I'd estimate their pizza about the same quality as Red Baron? It tasted like it'd be frozen at one time for sure. The \"hot\" wings tasted more like mild and I'm not a heat freak or anything, there was no spicey flavor at all. I didn't bother wasting time calling them, they obviously don't care to make things right with unhappy customers.   If I was stranded on a desert island I'd probably eat there pizza over raw fish and coconuts. But I can't see any other way that happens."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for 18 years the food and service are top notch.  Anytime family is in town and wants pizza and wings I call Venice."}
{"text":"Really good pizza. I gotta admit it's greasy but the flavors  are extremely delicious. There's something about the cheese I don't know if it's their sauce. They really don't skip on toppings. Your wallet won't be hurting either. We get their special with pizza 24 wings and 2 cans of soda(the 2 can sodas kind of adds a signature touch as I never seen any other pizza place do this). Their wings are pretty good too. This place definitely gets my vote for \"best bang for your buck\" pizzeria award.  Try it it won't disappoint you"}
{"text":"Venice is delicious, they've always been very accommodating for my catering requests, delivery people have always been friendly. It's greasy, fabulousness but come on, we all dig that. The only complaint I have is I ordered extra toppings and am cool with paying, but I didn't get them :/ whatever on that. They're kind of my go to."}
{"text":"Great Mom and Pop spot! I would have never tried this place had my student's talked about it so much. This is a true neighborhood pizza joint. I have never had to wait more than 20 minutes for my order even on busy days. A little small inside, I would suggest ordering and taking your pizza to go. The sauce is great and has a good garlic flavor to it. The cheese is not too salty like some other places I have tried. I like the thickness of the crust and flavor. It's crust on the outside and soft on the inside. The only thing missing here is fresh basil on the Margherita pizza. I have been told the ravioli and wings are good but I have not had a chance to try them yet."}
{"text":"Tonight we order a pizza and 2 sub's for deliver.  Food arrived in no time. The pizza was very hot and fresh. The cold sub arrived cold with lots of  meat and fresh toppings. I will be ordering again. This place beats all the pizza and sub chains."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza I have ever had... Mmmm I always get the too good to be true. Its 2 medium 2 topping pizzas and wings and 2 sodas... Omg the best... And friend zucchini omg"}
{"text":"I've been ordering pizza for delivery since the first day I moved to this neighborhood. Super fresh! I always get the XL & 2 dozen wings (hot & extra saucyyy) so much food & it doesn't break my wallet! Friendly service and the drivers are super friendly!"}
{"text":"First time trying pizza from this place. It was a great deal to grab a large pizza, 24 wings, and two drinks for $22. The food was great and service was nice. The only con is the neighborhood that the restaurant is in. It was in a sketchy area with a few scary looking homeless people hanging outside the adjacent liquor store. Great product overall."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery from Venice tonight for the first time.  We were not disappointed; the pizza crust is delicious and flavorful, toppings are generous.  The wings were crispy and hot enough. I  was expecting the wings to not be hot enough given that a few reviews lamented as such, but I am a spicy food fan, and I was happy with the heat.  The order was inexpensive, and was delivered fresh well within the time frame we were told for delivery.  As my favorite local pizza delivery place stopped delivering to my address (booo)  I am happy to find Venice as a replacement.  My only complaint is that the pizza is kinda greasy."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time it was reasonably priced b.c I had a coupon. We got an xl half cheese and half pepperoni pizza with garlic herb toppings & crust. With 2 dozen wings and 2 sodas it was a good deal. The pizza was absolutely delicious not overly greasy and that garlic seasoning was really good I highly recommend that. The wings could be crispier but overall were good and the mild sauce was worth it. Definitely will order from them again."}
{"text":"This is by far the most dingy, dirty and disgusting restaurant I have stepped foot in, ever. But, the food is good, right? If you read the reviews here, you'd certainly have reason to believe that. We just got back from there and let me share my experience with you.  First, it looks like a dangerous place to be hanging out. Second, there was no air conditioning. Third, although we intended to eat there, they put our food in containers to go. While waiting 25+ minutes for our order, I saw two dining tables being used to stack empty pizza boxes and kitchen containers. It looked like they've been doing this for quite some time. I saw a bug crawling along the wall, another crawling across the floor. There are no plates, no utensils and no napkins. The walls were so dirty and dusty, they appear to be 'furry.'  The 'dining' area also contains two industrial shelving units with over-flow kitchen needs and a refrigerator with a lock on the door. IN THE DINING AREA!  Let's talk about the food. Soda is only available in cans. We ordered the deep fried mushrooms, a 5-cheese pizza with garlic crust and a dozen wings.  There is a lot of talk about things being fresh here, but the mushrooms were clearly frozen, akin to Ore-Ida available in the frozen section of any grocery store. They were luke-warm at best, while the pizza would burn the roof of your mouth off, it was so hot. The chicken wings were clearly frozen, as well. So, let's talk about the pizza...where do I start? First, the 5-cheese pizza wasn't even on the menu. I only knew about it from reading other reviews here. It was cooked well. That's the best thing I can say about it. The crust is as thick as the toppings. There was almost no tomato sauce. It tasted like a big, cheesy garlic bread. Not pizza.  The wings were slimy and under-cooked. I prefer wings to be crispy. How things can come out of a deep fryer and be limp and soggy suggests to me they were not cooked long enough. There is no MEDIUM flavor for the wings. Your choice is MILD or HOT. They mixed the mild and hot sauces together to accommodate my request for medium. The sauce wasn't bad, but there was so much of it, I wonder if they think I ordered hot sauce and asked them to throw a few chicken wings in it for flavor.  We weren't planning on taking the food to go, but since we had no other choice, we brought it home with us. In doing so, the container that held the wings leaked through bag and almost stained the seats of my car if I hadn't caught it in time. I sacrificed my pants instead.  Now I know not to trust any reviews from anyone who left a 5-star review for this place. Just wow. I think this place is badly in need of an inspection from the health department.  If you decide to eat here and you're weighing this 1 star review against all the positive reviews, just know that I did my best to warn you.  The real shame is two-thirds of the food we brought home from this place went right into the trash can. It doesn't matter how cheap it is if it's inedible.  On the plus side, the staff were all very friendly."}
{"text":"I'm giving it 5 stars because it's the best at what it is - greasy pizza at a low, low price.  I usually just get the 18 inch cheese but we've ordered subs, calzones and wings, and they were all tasty and well worth the price.  The only thing I'd steer clear of is the fried zucchini, it's a no go."}
{"text":"Pizza Venice has, hands down, the best pizza in the Valley. In my mind, they've got the best bang for your buck with the XL three-topping pizza deal. Get that with the garlic crust, and you're buying pizza nirvana. It doesn't hurt that the owners are incredibly friendly. Why would I even consider ordering terrible chain pizza when I can get a great pizza for a great price from a locally owned business?"}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza and AMAZING wings! I  ran into this place at random online by asking Siri for places nearby that deliver food. I was a bit hesitant of ordering at first because I have no idea what this place looks like on the inside but I read all the positive reviews online and decided to take a chance. I am glad I took a chance because it is now one of my favorite pizza joints. Everything was supper fresh and gone from my family's table before I had a chance to take a photo. I am happy I live close enough to them to deliver and will definitely be ordering again soon! The only reason I am not giving them the 5 stars is because I don't know what it looks like on the inside."}
{"text":"This place is small and run down...I like this place because the cheese is ample and greasy, but not too greasy where it all runs off- not offending- it just pure cheese, and I love that. I've ordered from this place for years now and will continue to do so. Order delivery instead of going in just in case your weary of a small store that needs remodeling help from fixer uppers or etc...I love this place!!"}
{"text":"New family favorite for pizza delivery.  We get the Coyote almost every time.  The veggies are fresh and they cover every inch of the pizza.  The crust is amazing. Did I mention that they use real cheese? Not the oily kind. I think I'm going to order one right now."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery. 2 extra large Pepperoni Pizzas. Was not impressed. If you like crust on your pizza, this place isn't for you. Crust was non existent at the top. It was nothing special at all. Although there was a generous amount of pepperoni, and seasonings. And they over seasoned one pizza like someone wasn't paying attention... stick to your usual place."}
{"text":"I owe this place a lot for making my high school years very memorable.  I use to skip school often and order wings from this place and on Fridays' get a pizza and wing combo to sit well with some VHS tapes rented at Focus video across the street from our apartment.  Its no longer there and I no longer reside in the area but as a long time customer or their food I'm surprised they out lasted all the changes Glendale had gone through.   I give them 4 stars because even though I really preferred just the wings, the pizza was ok and I think I grew tired of it over the years of ordering it every week, I still felt they were better than dominos or pizza hut.  The big slices they gave were filling and the ranch was perfect with the wing specials I ordered so often.  And I give them credit to not question why a 15-year old kid was making wing orders at 10am on a Tuesday rather than getting a full education is a plus in my book. I think I had the same delivery driver come up to my apartment in the morning and evening and probably got stiffed on the tip because I didn't know any better.   Yeah this place was great and I wouldn't mind having another slice right now to relive that magical time in my life where I watched Halloween H20 along side a thick slice of leftover pepperoni and sausage on a Saturday morning,  fresh and cold out the box in my boxer shorts and socks.  Thanks Venice for the good times..."}
{"text":"This place has the best pizza in town! Ordering was easy, delivery fee was cheap $2, and the food was delicious. We got two large pizzas and two dozen wings with mild sauce and both were better than any place around."}
{"text":"Great pizza, wings, and service! Fresh ingredients.  Do stay away from chains as this place is wonderful!!"}
{"text":"This is by far one of the best pizza and wings place I have been to. The wings are crispy and juicy full of flavor. Definitely would recommend. The staff there are so friendly and very funny. I like to go early because I enjoy talking to them."}
{"text":"Awesome! The Cheese was sooo fresh and the anti pasta salad Very Good! Ask about the Specials, Save$$"}
{"text":"best chicken wings ever!! mild sauce is spicy and delicious!!"}
{"text":"Went over to this place last night after checking yelp for somewhere local for good pizza..I've been in my place for 2 YEARS and this was my first time over here....and I live on the same block, talk about mad. My pizza and wings were excellent cheesy garlicky crust cooked just right, wings crispy and saucy just like I ordered. I'm so mad that pizza hut and NYPD pizza has been getting my money when I could have walked to the corner and had this instead.  I'm considering moving now but if I do this is now my go to spot."}
{"text":"My family orders the hot wings here; the pizza isn't the best but do go for the wings!"}
{"text":"If you want an authentic mom and pop shop, you are looking at the right place! This pizza is vetter than any chain, and the owners are so kind! I got an XL Pesto pizza (Pesto sauce, mozzerela, and fixed tomatoe), a Calzone with mushrooms, onions and tomatoes, and fried zuchinni. The pizza was huge, and reminded me of mellow mushroom! We had a lot left over and it still tasted great being heated up the following two days! The calzone was twice as big as expected. This thing could serve 3 people! And, it came with an amazing authentic marinera sauce on the side. The tried zuchinni was a bit disappointing, however. It was okay, but the breading was flavorless and was soggy. I probably won't order them again. This place has decent prices and multiple coupon deals that are great for parties or pasta dinners. I look forward to going back!"}
{"text":"Good for take out. Decent hot wings, nothing out of the ordinary, standard wings and sauce, similar to Palermo's."}
{"text":"I live in the far west valley and every time I come into town I stop here. Great pizza! Give them your $, not the big pizza chains!"}
{"text":"Tried this place Friday after some recommendations, delicious!  Great phone service, 25 min carry out.  Ordered a 1 lg 1 topping and 12 hot wings.  Everything was perfect.  We added mushrooms to the pizza, they were so tasty.  The pizza was crispy and oh so good!  The wings were crispy and hot.  This is our new spot!"}
{"text":"We were in the mood for calzones - so we tried somewhere new - and were very happy!  I will DEFINITELY be returning to try the pizza next.  Not very expensive, and right down the street from me.  ONE NOTE: The sauce that comes with the calzone had meat in it - wasn't expecting that.  I've only ever had a calzone served with marinara.  I liked it.  My vegetarian other half, not so much."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! Wife and I ordered pepperoni pizza and HOT wings. Pizza is incredible and the wings have the right amount of sauce and we're actually hot.  Great place buried in a little hole in the wall. Great stuff!!"}
{"text":"My family and I were going to the nearby drive in and were looking for a meal we could eat while enjoying the movie. We searched nearby pizza restaurants and this one was nearby and had great reviews and rightfully so. I'm from NJ and and particular about my pizza   I must say, it was delicious. We got the large one topping with 12 wings and 2 sodas. After tax it came to a little over $19 which is amazing. Well worth the money. Next time we visit Phoenix we will definitely be back"}
