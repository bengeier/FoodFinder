{"text":"The pastries here are so good that I'm looking for more reasons to visit Woodbine.  It's a little out of the way for me but totally worth it."}
{"text":"Ive been coming  here for a couple months now. Im pleased. No cell phones going off. Good food.  No the food is great lol. Just remember  to leave a table for me. Have you seen the strawberry rhubarb pie"}
{"text":"Stopped by your location in The Bow today in search of a chai latte - what I got was a tea latte that was better than any chai I've gotten elsewhere downtown. Thanks to Chris the barista (who's hair is not nearly as bad as he thinks today) for the suggestion. I'll be back for another soon, with a side of that very tasty cannoli!"}
{"text":"I am addicted to bakeries. I go in to any bakery I see, just because of the smell, not needing anything, and coming out with a load of things that need to be eaten within days. The best part is, I usually gift the extras to others, and they love me for it. ;) Yesterday was my first time visiting Patisserie du Soleil at the Woodbine location. There's another, that's a bakery only in Glenmore landing. Back to Woddbine's location. Decently sized, and has a large menu for breakfast lunch and dinner. Although for now, I can't comment on any of those items, the prices were fair, and the offerings varied. What I did purchase was a cake for a friend's bday, called a almond apple tart, a banana nutella croissant, and an apple strudel. Apple tart - oh my god, we could've finished the WHOLE thing in a sitting! Light, slightly cakey, moist and not very sweet at all. Banana Nutella croissant - Banana + Nutella, need I say more? Apple strudel - my mother said it was fanatastic, and not too sugary.  Definitely will be visiting again. The customer service was excellent. When the sales girl saw that we had troubles deciding on a cake, she let us try samples.  Prices are insanely cheap for cakes especially in comparison to the downtown boutique bakeries, and even some of the run of the mill ones.  Cakes ranged from $8 - $18."}
{"text":"Love it here. Great food, wonderful pastries, excellent coffee. We've been here many times for breakfast or coffee and have always had wonderful service."}
{"text":"The food and pastries look great. They really do. And I really want to support these guys as a local business. I am that kinda lady. I hate to write this review but after three times of the same experience and no interest by staff in customer service.   You gotta train your baristas if you have an espresso machine. I've come three times now and the speed of service nearly made me lose my mind in line. My coffee has been horrible every time, which is why I haven't bothered to get food. Even now that they have Phil and Sebastien's you would think it would be awesome, but no. My kid and I came in for drinks. I asked the cashier to make both drinks just warm for a child and she told me the machine couldn't do that. Lols. What?! Oh ok. She didn't know that sometimes with an espresso machine they come with a  thermometer. Not this one! The supervisor told her to estimate it by touching the container. My child's drink burned his throat even though I checked it and mine was molten. Now we have been waiting for 30 mins for it to cool like a couple of loiterers. I asked for almond milk to cool it down and the woman without saying a word to me gave me 1oz in a to go cup like I was ruining their business. I took my drink back shortly after when I realized it was not only tasteless but also completely curdled from being too hot (remember when I asked for them to be just warm?). No apology. No ask if I wanted my money back or to remake the same drink. Ugh. Sorry guys but if there was any chance to have this conversation with you in your restaurant (i.e. Have one of your staff say one word to me when I had come up to fix both my drinks) I would have."}
{"text":"This is the most dangerous patisserie in Calgary for people like me who have poor self control around sweets.   Get there early. Like any great bakery it's slim pickings by closing time."}
{"text":"I love the breakfast poutine I could eat it every day! Service is ok resturant looks good"}
{"text":"Got the savoury crepe for $14 and it was perfect for brunch, took a while though to get our meals that's why it's 4/5. Overall would recommend, safe bet for any meal of the day."}
{"text":"Just had breakfast here (poutine). Amazing service, great meal and classy place. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Meh. Not great. Not awful. Had the beef sandwich which was described on the menu as having caramelized shallots and aioli. What arrived on my table was dry beef on a single, thin slice of bread with fried shallots and a hint of aioli. Tasted good but could be improved.  Service was prompt but disorganized. One server took our order then 2 minutes later someone else asked for our order.   Food came out quickly.   Took home some cream puffs. They were ok.   I think my issue was nothing screamed fresh or amazing. Just ok. If I'm going to spend money and eat the calories I want amazing."}
{"text":"Every time I come here I feel like I am hitting my head on a brick wall. I absolutely love the food and the atmosphere...I really feel like I am in Paris again!  But then there is the horrible service if you order anything more than a latte.   Still, it doesn't keep me from visiting. If you want to try true beignets this is the place to go."}
{"text":"This place is right around the corner from where we live. It's definitely a happening place as its always busy. (But not so busy that I've ever had to wait a really long time to be seated.) I originally thought it was a breakfast place but they serve lunch menu options that boarder on dinner as well. It's all savory and delicious . You won't be dissapointed."}
{"text":"Absolutly amazing!! You must go!  Everything i have tried i have enjoyed. They Are open for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  They have a small menu but everything is fresh and reasonably priced.  Breakfast is served all day.  There are always specials at lunch.  The lamb shank is by far the best meal i have ever had in a restaurant.  The sell bread which is great and of course lots of pasteries!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant used to be a good place for breakfast but our latest visit was a disappointment.  Small , tasteless eggs with slim slices of packaged ham means they have lost us as customers."}
{"text":"Went there for breakfast recently. The wait staff is nice albeit a bit harsh but that comes with the charm of the place.   Decor is nice, tries to look like a french patisserie but could use some minor changes like cleaning up the look of the kitchen as things look VERY cluttered. They had a view of many desserts, pies, pastries etc. that all looked good. I didn't try any but i imagine they are good.   The food was Meh, i had Eggs benedict that came with a bland hollandaise that was poured too heavily on my overcooked (poached too long) eggs and soft brioche bun (that should have been toasted but was not).   The house made ham was very good but honestly it was masked by the sauce and the bland taste of the rest of the food.   My friend had waffles that came out cold and were meh at best, nothing to complain about but nothing to write home about either.   Overall a meh experience and we will not be returning."}
{"text":"This is great little place to go to for local french cuisine that wont' force you into downtown. Located in the heart of Woodbine, you'll find everything here from pastries to go to sit down food.   They have amazing food! My husband and I both love going for their Mushroom and Saffron Risotto. I'll even add in a Strawberry Lemonade or Fruit Smooth that they make fresh on the spot.   The service is pretty decent. The only downside is that you don't get a dedicated server. They sort play it out between two or three servers so the service can get a little disorganized and occasionally it takes longer for us to get our food. Other than that, I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This place has amazing food. It is above and beyond anything I could have hoped for or expected!   Their breakfast poutine is to die for, and they also serve amazing lunches and dinners.  Higjly recommended!"}
{"text":"First time having lunch at the location in Woodbine and overall quite pleased with the food and service.The fries were a little cold but other than that I loved it! I ordered the BLT on an eclair bun and it was delicious and an adequate portion. Will be returning."}
{"text":"Got a chocolate raspberry mousse cake from here, it was good. However the cake was a little too sweet, and tasted ever-so-slightly stale. This place is reasonably priced, and they have a wide selection of food items. The bakery is nice, and I will definitely come again to try their other   options!"}
{"text":"Everything is so yummy, I wish I could stay and eat all day. Homemade ice cream, cinnamon buns that are not too sweet and goopy, beautiful salads...I lament my ownership of a single stomach and inability to graze continually."}
{"text":"Patisserie is reasonably priced. I have eaten almost everything on the menu and drinks menu, and the food is very high quality. The chocolate truffle mochachino is amazing! Way better than a coffee beverage made at a chain like Starbucks!   The interior has just been revived and the staff are friendly. Service is usually pretty good, I have only had a lazy server once, and I don't think she even works there any more.   My only issue is that have had a few not so fresh baked goods from here. Otherwise I would give it a five star review. It is a great local business."}
{"text":"5 easy stars from your foodie friend! As an active Yelp user I would like to let you know that I am not an old man that only goes out once a year and I am most likely not your neighbour. I am not a \"bot\" and would like to justify my account on yelp and leave a 5 star review. French, yes(*1)... coffee, yes(*2)... dessert, yes(*3)... breakfast, yes(*4)...brunch, helyeah!(*5) 5/5 well done"}
{"text":"Fantastic find!!!! A friend suggested this place for a breakfast stop for me, my sister and her.  We all LOVED our brunch!!! I ordered the fresh pastries, my sister enjoyed the banana bread French toast and our friend absolutely enjoyed the GF waffles... along with specialty tea lattes and coffees.  Every single meal and item was fantastic!!!! I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I had a work/group meeting at this location I had never been to before. I guess the place can be rented out after hours and the one staff member stayed late and catered to us. The coffee was quite good and service with a smile was fantastic. The fellow behind the counter was polite and very engaged with our group and anything we needed. I found the pastry prices to be quite fair and everything behind the glass looked delicious. Great location at the end of a strip plaza with plenty of parking in the lot. Looks like our meeting will be held here once every month and I am quite happy about this! The bakery is tidy and well laid out - I do not think there is anything about bakeries I do not like. I always come out with little, beautiful works of art that I share/gift to others. My favourite way to pay it forward. Don't you want to be my friend?  :)  TIP - this place even serves delicous looking ice cream for those warm days!"}
{"text":"Good pastries and a great mushroom risotto! The prices are decent and its a great place for brunch. The only disappointing thing is the service. If you stay in the cafe prepare to wait forever for a server, and have different people wait on you. The owner insists that all the servers share tables, so there is always confusion as who has been helped and who has not. It took 15 minutes to get our order placed, then 5 min later we had two servers attempt to take our order. It was really annoying. Been here twice and same experience both times. Good food, but really bad service.   So I would suggest getting some pastries to go, the croissants are made fresh and some of the best in the city. I especially like the spinach and feta ones. They also have great macaroons and apple struddle."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful little bakery and restaurant. Great service, wonderful food and a family friendly atmosphere. I love it!"}
{"text":"I was happy when they offer phil and seb. coffee so i ordered  mocha and for my entrée, my all time favorite breakfast Eggs Benedict with Salmon (thought it was smoked). The presentation is cute but could've been better. For the taste, it is close to Manjari Mocha from P&S, There is a balance of the richness of the chocolate and the medium roasted coffee. To be frank, I'm not a fan of their benedict, it's just poorly done. Overall, love the mocha, Entrée needs some work."}
{"text":"Great brunch, we had the eggs Benni, cooked exactly to order and the 2+2+2, 2 eggs again done just right, 2 slices of whole grain seedy toast and 2 slices of ham with hash browns and compote  a coffee and a smoothy for $20"}
{"text":"Awesome place. Great food. Friendly staff. Reasonable prices.  My own business is adjacent to Pâtisserie Du Soleil. So as you can imagine, I eat there frequently. Probably too frequently.  In my many visits, I have never had bad service or food. Their quality control is impressive and a reflection of how much the owners care about the standards they set.  In fact, we are so impressed with the quality of Pâtisserie Du Soleil that we send our running groups next door for social time twice a week all year round. To date, we have not heard a bad word about them."}
{"text":"Team Fam came here and I ordered a Two of Everything ($12) with the sausage option. Even though the word everything is in the name, you'll choose between bacon and sausage. The eggs come the way you like it and with my plate came 4 halves of buttered toast, potatoes, and some sliced fruit. I found my sausages to be quite juicy and the potatoes to be well seasoned. Ketchup didn't hurt any cause and it went great with the potatoes. I asked for over-easy eggs and got over-easy eggs. The fruit was pretty sparse but better than nothing and the jam tasted fresh and I poured it all over my toast. All-in-all this was a pretty hearty meal if a bit on the more expensive side but everything was quite delicious.

{"text":"Amazing cakes! I've tried the tiramisu, Black Forest and cake. All 5 stars in my books. Can't wait to try dining in for brunch."}
{"text":"Originally was planning to go to the Flat Crepe which used to be next door, but is now closed, and was delighted to see this place right around the corner. My wife had the eggs florentine which she loved and I had the breakfast sandwich. I think it would be better served on a croissant but was still very tasty! Also had a cappuccino and  beignets (little french timbits covered in powered sugar that you dip in their home made jam!) Yum! A great breakfast. And the service was outstanding. Will return for sure!"}
{"text":"Great little coffee shop/bakery. Not only are their baked goods top notch, but recently they brought a gourmet feel to their location by offering french inspired breakfast, lunch, and dinner entres. Although a touch on the pricey side for a neighborhood joint, the taste and variety of food will make you come back for more."}
{"text":"In 1985, Mike & the Mechanics sang \"All I need is a miracle, all I need is you.\" In 2011, I sing \"All I need is a miracle, all I need is this pie.\"  This strawberry rhubarb pie to be exact. When I first walked through the doors of Patisserie Du Soleil, I was hit with the smell of some mouth wateringly sweet baked goods. As I scanned the room, my eyes fell on the lower shelf to my left. I thought I spied a cake. I do love my cake. But as I drew closer, I read the tag underneath my wonder cake that said \"Strawberry/Rhubarb Pie - $8.\" Strawberry-rhubarb? How did they know that strawberry-rhubarb anything is one of my favourites! Covered in almonds and extra crumbles from the crust, this pie was coming home with me.  While I waited in line at the register to pay for my new friend (who wasn't going to last long once I got home... some friend, hey?), I eyed up the rest of the menu. A full menu of breakfast and lunch items, sandwiches, soups, eggs and the likes was laid out in large print behind the counter. That's it, I'm coming back soon for breakfast... finally, a place I'd drive across the city to visit :)."}
{"text":"It is supposed be a bakery, but all the croissants we bought where frozen. So they bake them, then freeze them, not exactly fresh (pretty sure they just get everything frozen then just warm it up). Beside that they where bland tasteless. The service is incredibly slow. Omelette was no better than any greasy spoon."}
{"text":"I will begin by saying this is a hidden gem in woodbine. I still don't know how to pronounce the name when I recommend this cafe/restaurant /bakery to people which makes it difficult to explain to people exactly who you are and where you are located. This little cafe is usually packed...and for good reason....the good is unreal!! Everything is made fresh and is truly soooooo authentic and delicious . They are known for there sausage rolls ( turkey, beef, or pork) which are beyond amazing, the only problem is they are almost ALWAYS sold out. We recommend these sausage rolls to all our friends and family but anytime they go out of there way to buy them there are none. We literally stop here 5/7 days of the week to try and get our hands on these sausage rolls but never are they properly stocked for customers who are willing to spend lots of $$ on these things. This makes me not want to recommend the place anymore but we can't help but continue our daily visits hoping these \"roll\" around again.  Let me reirriderate...I rate the food 10/10 but when it comes to the customer service side of things I rate it 4/10. The staff is unapologetic and make it a mystery every time as to when they will have more stock . More staff is needed as well as more  appreciation for customers the like me who advertise your cafe when more often then not we leave empty handed and disappointed.   If you do get the chance to try this place you won't be disappointment by the flavors...addicting is the best way to describe this under stocked gem."}
{"text":"Banana bread is amazing. I love whipping over and grabbing a loaf on early mornings on the weekend."}
{"text":"If you're a mocha lover like myself, Patisserie du Soleil is worth the visit just for the $4.00 Chocolate Truffle Mochaccino.  The mug is huge and it's served very hot, which is a rare treat.  I also appreciate that they don't load it with whipped cream and other toppings.  It's just a straight up mocha, no dressing required.  You can tell it's decadent and yet I don't think it would be too sweet for most people.    I was impressed with the menu items and even though I'd consider most of them to be a bit expensive, they appear enticing enough to make the prices seem worth it.  I didn't have enough of an appetite to test this theory, so I just tried a Turkey Sausage Roll.  It was sizable and surprisingly flavorful.    It was very busy during the lunch hour.  I wasn't a fan of the extreme noise level (the acoustics are terrible) and the large tables.  These two factors combined made visiting a little strenuous.  I do love the large windows and natural light, though.  I checked out the website after I left and realized it doesn't properly reflect all that this place has to offer.  You really must stop in.  And they have a school lunch program.  Interesting.    I'd have no problem returning but would likely try to avoid peak hours."}
{"text":"Excellent food and breakfast menu all day, too. Real quality hand made product and it shows/tastes. I see it says \"no alcohol\" above but I am sure they serve beer, etc. The pastries and coffee are marvellous, as well."}
{"text":"It was our first time to this breakfast place. The food tasted fresh and homemade. They even gave homemade jam on the side that was delicious! I would recommend getting here between 8-9am to avoid the rush. Short menu but all was good. Also great place to pick up bread for Sunday dinner."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with some work colleagues.  It is a cute little French bistro near Fish Creek Park.   The service was polite and prompt, and they had some delicious open-faced sandwiches for lunch.   I liked that they had an all-day breakfast option with some breakfast poutine, and french toast on the menu.   I had a roast beef sandwich, it was very tasty.   Overall, the experience was a pleasant one."}
