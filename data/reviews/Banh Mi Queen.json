{"text":"Falafel banh mi for $5- I know it sounds strange by it was surprisingly good! Made it a combo (for around $3 extra I think) and got homemade ginger lemonade and papaya salad. The sandwich was very large and definitely a good deal, plus they had a good ratio of pickled vegetables."}
{"text":"Tried the chicken banh mi for $5. it was good with substantial pieces of chicken. Like someone else said, they do put a lot of cilantro but I like that. It's more expensive than your typical banh mi but still affordable. Although there are other more expensive types like beef or raw fish. I would come back. This place is takeout only.

{"text":"The banh mi is overpriced for what you get and is considerably worse than Hoang Oanh and Vinhs. I would go there over Vua, for sure, but for $8.50 after tax for a regular BBQ Pork sandwich, it is underwhelming. The portion is good, but its double the price of most cheaper places. The meat was alright. The pickled vegetables were lacklustre. 

I would probably not eat here again."}
{"text":"Got to try out Banh MI Queen for lunch @ Trauma Rounds. We got this clean nice looking lunch bags with carrot green papaya salad (it was a tad dry) with a peanut based olive oil dressing, 6 inch chicken Banh Mi sandwich perfectly wrapped with an elastic- good sandwich but I've had better like Tran and Vua, and a bag of chips. I was very filled by the end of my meal. Would definitely recommend this place for catering go work events!"}
{"text":"Finally a great banh mi place on St Laurent. Fresh, fast, and full of flavour! From the restauranteur best known for Big in Japan restaurant + Big in Japan bar, Andre stepped up it up with a fast casual concept where Asian meets French. I had the BBQ pork sub that comes with tasty toppings, leaving a crunch and spicy burn after every bite. Good job guys!"}
{"text":"To much cilantro... I'm not a huge fan of cilantro, but it's an essential part of a banh mi. The amount of cilantro was next level - there was more cilantro than any other ingredient (besides the roll). I pulled out a huge handful, then continued eating. Otherwise, a decent bite to eat!"}
{"text":"While I appreciate ambitious aspirations, the title \"Banh Mi Queen\" is a bit of a stretch. At most on the nobility hierarchy, we're looking at a Banh Mi Duchess. And even then, from one of the lower houses. 

There's nothing notable about the sandwiches here. The ingredients aren't particularly fresh, the flavours aren't all that bold, the price isn't competitive... the only real draw is the location. 

Bonus: there aren't any tables in the restaurant, so I asked if I could eat by the counter. They said no :("}
