{"text":"Food is edible. Drinks seem better priced that the other bars (though still at airport prices). I asked why people complain about the TV's not being changed, and the bartender said that the TV's are linked to other TV's, so to change 1, changes another TV (that someone is usually watching). I personally don't see what the big deal is. There's like a dozen TV's throughout the restaurant. Some people just don't understand that the world doesn't revolve around them."}
{"text":"Food OK and waitstaff was OK albeit a little slow.  The \"seat yourself\" thing just doesn't work. You have clueless people sitting alone at a 4-top, and three sumo wrestlers crammed at a two top. Like most airport restaurants, they seem oblivious to the fact that you might, you know, be in a hurry and that, umm... you might have some personal possessions with you."}
{"text":"Very chill spot! Good food and relaxing! Waitress was amazing! A little overprice, but what do you expect at the airport."}
{"text":"Keeping in mind that I came here strictly for a beer during my two hour lay over, I enjoyed this place. I was concerned after reading the reviews but compared to some of the airport bar and grills I've visited throughout the world, this was a solid bar and grill. The local draft beers were $7 which is a fair price in my home locale and definitely in an airport ($10 for a pint in another terminal!!). You can get domestic bottles for $5.25 and imports for $6.25. The waiter was super friendly and let me try two local beers before deciding which one to try. The space is clean and has a variety of seating options- two tops outside patio style, bar, traditional tables and leather club chairs. They also have outlets throughout and a bartender who will charge your phone behind the bar for you. A solid airport bar and grill."}
{"text":"I am giving 5 stars for the excellent and efficient service from Natasha! She is friendly, fast paced  and on top of it!  I would not recommend the nachos as they use 'fake' cheese. I would have given less stars because of that, but the service in general from all of the staff outweighs that.  It looks like their other food options would have been a better choice for me."}
{"text":"For Terminal A this is your best choice for dining.  Your other options here are Wendy's, Cinnabon and the per-packaged sandwich, salad place connected to this bar.  And basically it is a bar with hamburgers, a grilled chicken sandwich, flatbread pizza and fries and nachos.  The food is decent (they toasted the bun of my chicken sandwich which was nice) and the staff is friendly.  If you have more time you could wander the other terminals and find something with a little more variety.  But if you need to stick close to your gate but have time for a sit-down meal and want a drink this is you best and only option."}
{"text":"Food was OK. Service was great. Avoiding a cockroach under my chair almost made me barf! Watching the server try and stomp on it was comical.  Not having a manager deal with the issue is horrible. Not having anyone monitor their yelp comments is typical of horrible restaurants that don't give a shit!"}
{"text":"It surely beats eating at Burger King.  The place is pricey.  I'll give you that.  Pricey enough to make me wish I'd snuck a couple mini-bottles through security...that expensive.  The atmosphere is nice for an airport.  You can watch the game and hear your conversation amidst the bustle that continuously surounds you.  The food is not bad at all.  It will cost...about what you would expect at an airport.  Overall, when I'm down this terminal, this is where I'm going.  I'll just learn to downgrade to the cheap stuff when I'm here.  \"No sir...not that shelf...a little lower...a little lower...maybe...perhaps you have something in that drawer under the cabinet...by the floor?\""}
{"text":"The staff is pleasant, the management cordial. The nachos are a crime against humanity.  But don't believe me, I'm only on the interwebs so what do I know about such things. Allow me to take you on a trip.... Imagine if you will a plastic salad bowl from Wendy's. Piled low with small bite sized stale chips in festive reds and whites (because we all know corn tortilla chips are naturally red in color).  Dancing playfully upon this stale stage of sorrow is a 1/3 can of Hormel beanless chili. Nothing says Nachos like Hormel! Yum! Drizzle the trough with AMC Theater brand \"nacho cheese\" to make it authentic and show the whole dish three black beans and BAM! Ultimate nachos for the reasonable price of $8,75! Best.Dish.Evah! Sad when Nachos at Taco Bell are more authentic."}
{"text":"Looks cool/chic, service is great, menu is fast/bar food in disguise, and the food itself is passable. Incredibly tight seating, especially with luggage.  No, I didn't love it. Overall, there are no other full-service options, so suck it up like I did and enjoy Uptown!"}
{"text":"Usually 45 minutes to grab breakfast prior to boarding is plenty of time to grab a breakfast sandwich. Not here.  It was almost 10 minutes before I was acknowledged by the wait staff.  When I am finally acknowledged, I put in my entire pretty simple order. Orange juice, bacon, egg and cheese croissant, and a banana.  I get my banana and orange juice pretty quickly, but waited 25 minutes to receive my breakfast sandwich.  I immediately attempted to pay my bill before taking a bite, my credit card set on the table for almost another 10 minutes.  Oh and my sandwich was either heavily microwaved or sat under the heat lamp forever, the styrofoam plate was so warped it barely sat flat on the table.  Such a weird experience."}
{"text":"I've been through Douglas International several times. Normally it's the same routine for me... when I have a short layover I come in and go out. When it's a little longer, I normally have a beer and some sushi out in the open area at Hissho Sushi. This particular time I had a 2 hour layover for a early morning flight, and had to catch my plane down in the A terminal...a place that I had never been before.  As I wandered down this particular terminal, I noticed that there was little down there. It was a smaller area with a lot less to offer. The biggest place that I saw was the Uptown Bar & Lounge. They had multiple large screen televisions and a huge bar, so I decided to wait out my 2 hours here.   They had a full bar and were also offering a small breakfast menu. I decided to go that route and ordered a egg and cheese sandwich on wheat along with grits, a mimosa, and a cup of coffee.  The coffee was pretty decent. It wasn't as strong as I like, but at the same time it wasn't watery like a lot of other places. The mimosa wasn't anything special. I just watched the bartender pour some juice in some champagne. I eventually got my meal, which is served on a plastic plate along with plastic ware. The egg sandwich was something that I normally make when I'm in a rush and half awake in the mornings. Nothing special at all...actually a little below average. The plastic bowl of grits had a few lumps and no flavor at all.  The bartender was nice, not anything overwhelming, but she was nice, and polite, and gave me what I ordered. You can't ask for more than that.  If you have a flight out of A, this is a decent spot to grab a drink and watch some TV. Unless you have a flight leaving out of A, there's no reason to venture down that way. Uptown Bar & Lounge doesn't really deserve the ride down the moving sidewalk."}
{"text":"Venue: Uptown Bar & Lounge  Decor:   Nice,   Service:  Pretty good, North Carolina hospitality   Environment:   compact  Food:   Decent, nothing to have a parade over  Prices:   More than the average bar  Huge Pros:  No streets around   Debbie Downers:     Conclusion:   It is a nice venue right outside your gates in the terminal.  Nice TV's to watch the game.  Overall: Average spot to kill time before you catch a flight if you want to snack on something or catch a flight.  Grade: C"}
{"text":"I've been mistreated and even kicked out of some places. I've never experienced anything just like this. These jerks are RUDE. Not sure what I did to get my check thrown at me but i did. Then this cocky barback tender says I can't put my purse in the seat next to me. This bar is EMPTY. I  don't think I'm causing anyone to miss a spot. I mean from the time I walked into this place they have been unbelievable. Writing this post to make myself look occupied as I sit here and finish this half azz Moscow Mule."}
{"text":"Grabbed a quick breakfast before an early morning flight.  Enjoyed the scrambler (eggs, hash browns, sausage).  Service was good (and fast) and prices were very reasonable.  Would definitely recommend this vs a basic coffee shop, especially before a long flight."}
{"text":"Average airport bar food.  Staff was attentive."}
{"text":"Great food and service for an airport.  Loved the burger and beer battered cheese curds!"}
{"text":"Stopped into Uptown this past Monday after missing my flight out of Charlotte. Since I had some time to kill and was frustrated after missing my flight, I wanted a delicious beverage while I waited. Ellen was my server and she made everything better! She was warm and inviting and was always smiling. I think she could sense my frustration and immediately offered an absolut pepper Bloody Mary (which are my favorite). Since I hadn't eaten all morning, I figured I should eat a little something. I asked ellen what her favorite thing was on the menu and she suggested the veggie flatbread with a side of ranch. It was really good and was the perfect amount to tide me over until my next flight. All in all it was a great experience and if I ever get stuck in concourse A again, I will definitely stop back in!"}
{"text":"Had almost a 2-hour layover during dinner hours and saw this place near my gate. The comfortable looking lay-z-boy esque chairs drew me in. I ended up ordering the Grilled Chicken sandwich and opted to go with the House Salad instead of the Fries.  The brioche bun was nicely toasted and had great texture. The chicken was pretty good despite it's odd, circular shape. The tomato, red onions, and shredded iceberg lettuce added some freshness to the sandwich. The salad was fresh and crisp, but very average. It looked just like the sandwich toppings, but in a bowl. The service, not the food, is what really made this a 4-star worthy experience. I sat there for over an hour leisurely eating while I waited for my next flight. She was great -- friendly, attentive, and didn't appear to mind that I took my time... but it's an airport so she probably sees that all the time.  Average airport prices for food -- $10-$15 for most of the items. My sandwich and salad was $9.95 plus tip. So it's what you would normally pay for a chicken sandwich and salad at most sit-down restaurants. A nice find that I would probably return to if I have another long layover here."}
{"text":"Far better than average staff, less than average food.  Good draft beer selection.  The bar staff was friendly, efficient, and attentive.  They're the only reason I didnt give a 1-star rating.  They very happily agreed to plug in my laptop behind the bar, as the restaurant itself had no power outlets (the owners know this is an airport, right?)  I ordered the bacon cheeseburger, and specifically asked for it to be cooked rare and asked if that was something the kitchen would do, and the bartender replied \"no problem\".  The patty I was served was served well done, and was equivalent to those discount supermarket beef patties that come in boxes of 50 that emphasize quantity over quality.  There was no easy way it could have been cooked rare, as it was so thin most of my french fries were of equal/greater thickness.    I wish the staff had been more upfront that I wasn't going to get the food cooked to order, and I would have happily ordered something else.   The above said, it did appear to be the best option in Concourse A."}
{"text":"The restaurant is nice, decent food, large bar area and plenty of beer options. I received my food and drink quickly.  The flatbread pizza isn't very flat, more of a hand tossed crust but still very good.    Lastly, Amber M, my server, was attentive, nice, and went above and beyond.  I felt that she deserved a call out. As a frequent traveler who has spent many hours in airport restaurants...courteous attentive staff isn't the norm."}
{"text":"This place is NOT a good meal option.  My jaw is sore from eating the leather sandwich.  They call it a steak sandwich, but I know leather when I taste it.  Good thing it came with mushy French fries to give my over worked jaw a rest.  Why 2 stars?  First, hop drop and roll on draft!  Very good.  Secondly, good music.  Only option to sit down and eat in terminal A.  United, please fly out of another terminal!"}
{"text":"My flight was delayed Thursday afternoon so I stopped by for a drink. I sat at the bar with Ashley. She was very personable and made my wait enjoyable. Definitely coming back. Cocktails were great but Ashley made my experience even better!!"}
{"text":"Second time here, second time they messed up. To be fair, the servers are attentive and as polite as can be. I cannot hold the servers accountable, because each time they had the order correct. The food, when it is what you ordered, is tasty. The issue is the kitchen. They cannot seem to get an order right the first time. Today it took three tries to get what I had ordered. If you are patient and have time to have the order corrected, give it a try. For those with tight travel plans, save yourself the frustration."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant because I was HANGRY and it was across from my gate. This was the beginning of my birthday weekend and it was after 12pm so a mimosa was in order. It was fine; that's hard to mess up. The chicken flatbread I ordered was mediocre at best. It was served with a packet of Parmesan cheese. That's right, a packet. I suppose the need to have to get people in and out efficiently is a priority. The only reason I'm giving 2 stars is because, Melissa, my server was very kind and attentive. Otherwise, this review can be summarized by saying \"go to another concourse, the walk will be worth it.\""}
{"text":"Airport bar. Food looked good, Did not eat. One 12 year old double Scotch on rocks.... more than $35 Dang these airport prices!!! Service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Server refused to change 1 of 10 TVs to an internationally televised soccer game that my colleague wanted to watch because the \"channels were chosen for the day\". Most of the TVs had highlight reels going, talk shows, CNN etc on given it was 3 pm on a Tuesday.  Thanks for nothing!"}
{"text":"Well, its an airport restaurant expect the alcohol prices to be high. $7.50 + for draft beers, $8+ for wine. They have REALLY GOOD NACHOS for $10. It took a loooong time to come out though. Almost 40 minutes. But its a big bowl. The fresh ingredients are fresh, and the roasted fresh corn a nice touch. The seasoned beef was tasty, and the cheese sauce flavorful. Overall the best nachos I've had in a while. Pleased, but it shouldn't take 40 minutes to make nachos!"}
{"text":"Oh My Fricken GOD!  What happened to \"Southern Hospitality?\"  I'm in Charlotte for business and now at the airport on my way back home. Ok, it's very early morning and you rush to the airport mostly just to get through security. Then you have all this time before you board. How about breakfast?  In concourse A there is not much choice and I wish for a sit down breakfast with bacon and eggs. Wendy's is open at 5am but let's do something just a bit better.   There is an Uptown. It's open at 5:30. Ok I'll wait a few, and a few, and a few more. Another passenger and I are standing by the half open gate at 5:37 waiting. No one looks or even cares. One person come close as she closes off a section the quickly turns away. Then she walks back and opens the gate the rest of the way and sets a sign next to me and walks away.   The other passenger and I are asking each other \"Is that the signal to go in?\"  Again no response, then I found a table by the window and started to get settled in when the bartender proclaimed \"If you are a single, move to the smaller tables so we can use the Four top for larger parties.\"    What, no \"Good Morning\" before you chastise me for making an obvious to them offensive table selection?  I turned and she was looking at me with discuss, pointed to her left indicating the single tables. I was surprised and flabbergasted. I looked over that direction and there was another open gate, I headed for it. Then I here \"Sir, are you going to sit down?\"  I normally do cuss at stupid people because it makes me feel stupid. But some how that F-Bomb got out there.   First. If you see your customers queuing up, greet them with \"Good morning, we will be ready for you in just a few minuets.\"  Second.  When the gates open welcome your customers in.  Third. \"Hi sir, may I ask you to please sit at those tables?  We would like to use those tables for families and large parties.   But since it's only 5:42AM I SHOULD give them a brake for their very bad customer service."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a couple of times for a quick lunch before a flight and the food is pretty good. For those who like ranch dressing it's great here. Today I decided to try it for breakfast and though you're free to seat yourself, I was greeted by who would be my server. It was decent for airport pancakes, bacon, and eggs. My server was cool. Not too annoying, not to absent. The prices are reasonable. I'd eat here for breakfast again."}
{"text":"Waitress was very nice. Food was pretty terrible. Sit down restaurant with plastic dishes. No qualms about shoveling bag after bag of plastic into the earth. Nachos had ballpark style cheese. Back up soup had to be ordered. Then again the only other choice I saw was Wendy's...maybe the lesson is don't order the nachos. Or the soup."}
{"text":"Other than the prices, which are always going to be insane at an airport, this was a good location to grab a drink and a snack. I had some Sierra Nevadas and the pepperoni flatbread, which is a fancy and kind of untrue thing to call a PIZZA. But it was good. The service here was, er, serviceable. It was very busy here on a Thursday afternoon, but our server wasn't difficult to get ahold of. Nice place to relax with colleagues after a week of work before the flight."}
{"text":"Great customer service, but food was just average.  Can't expect much from an airport restaurant, but it was food in the belly before a long flight home.    The trend I saw at all the dining establishments I went to in the south were... friendly, southern hospitality service from waiters and staff and bitching and rude customers.  Apparently the people who sat down before we did at the same table were total jerks.  I guess what they say is true about the south... \"there's nothing like it\"."}
{"text":"Ok drinks. Good service. Terrible good.  The grilled chicken salad comes out in a plastic bowl and is not worth the price. The utensils are plastic. Come in for a drink, but don't waste your time with the food. Go to another terminal to eat"}
{"text":"Opens early in the morning for those if us who need to fly out early.  Service is friendly. Place is clean....  Now. This place feels like a bar and not a place the serves 'breakfast daily'. Plastic plates and plates forks and knives. And I was eating at the restaurant. The food was a minor step above hotel food. It filled a gap but not something i would like to repeat or rave about. The prices are ok, but in an airport with limited choices... there's not much you can do....  Not sure I would come again..."}
{"text":"I don't think I could ever give an airport restaurant more than 3 stars, so consider this rating middle-of-the road as far as airport restaurants go. The service is SUPER fast and friendly - I think I waited less than 5 minutes for my burger to arrive. On that note, it tasted like it took less than 5 minutes to make. My salad also tasted like the plastic bag it came from. But the ladies behind the counter were very accommodating and made sure I had everything I needed. Can't comment on the drinks (I thought 11am on a Thursday may have been pushing it). But next time I am at the airport, I will probably try a different restaurant out before resorting to this place."}
{"text":"I understand this is an airport bar. But I would've ordered food, and 3 times the drinks had my server ever said more than one word to me when she first took my order. Apparently \"would you like to order any food\" or \"would you care for another drink\" simply wasn't as important as checking her phone constantly. Oh well, my money is HAPPILY welcomed elsewhere...and from now on will be. Just \"Wow\"! Train. Your. People."}
{"text":"Waiting for my flight back to Detroit, I wanted to sit, drink a Guinness, eat and relax and my only choice in concourse A was this place. I certainly am not a sports bar guy but I was limited. Ordered a mushroom Swiss burger and onion rings. They were ok. The onion rings were a bit tough and the burger was slightly over cooked. I was excited to see they had banana pudding cake. But alas, they were out. I had the pound cake instead. Again, it was ok. Nothing great. My waitress was nice and attentive. So if you're in the CLT and have the time, walk over to concourse C to Bad Daddy's (see my previous review) to get an awesome burger."}
{"text":"Not too shabby!  That's what best describes this place.  Not having flown out of this concourse in quite some time they have upgraded a few of the places to eat while waiting on your flight.  Uptown Bar and Lounge gives the appearance of a sexy chic place but the underlying truth is there's only so much sexiness you can exude and still offer plastic utensils (yes I know it's regulated).    The use of dark woods and leather back chairs is a nice touch and the bar is nicely adourned with plenty of libations.    I had a chicken sandwhich, nothing to write home about but pretty good and a side of cole slaw (large portions).  The service was so-so but I've come to realize that all airport waiters/waitresses seem to exude their happiness and overally general likeability somewhere other than at work it seems."}
{"text":"Quality of food was not there for the price. We had mushroom burger, fries, chicken tenders, and potato soup.    The waitress was very nice, but slow on service."}
{"text":"Great pulled pork sandwich. Try to stop in every time I'm at CLT. Fast, friendly servers too. A pleasant surprise for an airport."}
{"text":"Most disgusting breakfast I've ever eaten in a US airport.  Bacon over salty.  Eggs were bland and I assume powdered.  The coffee sucked too. They could easily do better."}
{"text":"All because of my server Lindsay's very nice service, I am giving 4 stars. She was very very nice and kind. The food, BBQ pork salad was quite good but the onion rings were a bit weak."}
{"text":"As a frequent traveler, I can honestly say I was disgusted with the bar staff and their miserable attitudes today. I usually will hang around for quite a bit prior to my flight; made an exception after today. The female on the early shift (May 21 around noon) was a real gem [insert sarcasm here], especially when you asked her for something. Not even two minutes after I ordered my food, it came out. You can tell it had been sitting under a heater for quit sometime, due to its hard, crunchy taste. An elderly gentleman had closed out his check and came back shortly after. He stated to the bartender that he seemed to have misplaced his card after he left. She responds with \"well it would still be on the bar then, I don't have pockets so I didn't take it\". Umm... I don't think he was accusing you, he just stated he misplaced it. I kindly ushered him to check under his newspaper, as it may be there. He found it and you can tell he was slightly embarrassed. She rolled her eyes and kept walking. I saw her shift was ending and was excited for a fresh, new face to continue enjoying my beer and meal at the bar.   Well... The disappointment continued. This clown, at about 1PM, was even more of a jerk than the female he just replaced. The gentleman next to me asked for a Pabst beer and he replied \"sorry we serve real beer here.\" I'm sorry bartender - last time I checked, your job is to serve, not to insult your patrons. If you don't carry it, you can kindly inform him that you don't have that beer in your selection. I was surprised the gentleman stayed; however, it was the only bar in the terminal. After that comment, I was done and I grabbed my check. I am a very generous tipper and it pained me to give them 20% for their dismal service. I left half my beer and food at the bar because I couldn't stomach sitting there any longer.   To Uptown Management: I think it's time to clean house with your staff or write them up. Smiling clearly is optional here, as they didn't smile once.  Note to others: never take a layover in CLT, if you have to, don't go into Terminal A. It will make your layover feel like an eternity."}
{"text":"It is an airport bar that is pretty crowded when the evening bank of flights go out. My biggest complaint is the wine glasses smell of bleach/detergent. If I were to come back I would ask them to hand rinse the glass before pouring."}
{"text":"I've been here so many times now. It seems no matter when we fly, we always end up at this restaurant. For a generic airport restaurant l, I can't complain. They have a good selection as far as the drink menu goes and the food menu has something for everyone as well. I will say that I actually enjoy the breakfast a little more than the regular menu though. The regular menu items I've had have been just okay, very bland and pricey(which is expected for an airport I guess). But the breakfast items have always been more flavorful and the prices are more comparable to what you get.  The staff is always hit or miss. I've had really great bartenders and servers and I've also had some pretty terrible ones-not friendly and rude. Guess it depends on the day or there mood.  All in all, not a bad stop if you have some time before your flight and they're always quick too!"}
{"text":"There are not many choices in this section of the airport, though I am thinking that will change once the new A gates open. We were not interested in Wendy's and the people are always friendly here (and they serve alcohol:) There's a nice bar; seating is alittle cramped but if you like watching everyone going by, you can sit at their outside-the-bar tables. I like that they are so accommodating: I am in a no diary, no gluten phase, so I had to ask for my Bacon Burger with no cheese & no bun, and my side salad with Oil & Vinegar (The oil I got was Olive Oil). The waitress was just like 'no problem' and as sunny as can be. I received some large lettuce leaves with the burger which were big enough to make a paleo lettuce wrap out of the burger. The House Salad was fresh. My husband had the BBQ pork and was happy. Nothing outstanding but good fresh food before a long flight and no worries about feeling under par from eating the wrong things. Drinks are adequate. We have had breakfast here before and once again they are accommodating & fresh. All in all a good experience every time."}
{"text":"I've frequently stopped here on my way out of Charlotte and have always had good service. This morning was no exception.  Ordered the Southern Breakfast, which was to be 2 scrambled eggs, so I asked for 2 more. What I got appeared to be 7-8 eggs.    I be full now! #DontWasteTheProtien   Thanks for the consistent good service."}
{"text":"Probably the worst airport restaurant/bar I've ever been in. The staff was awful. I actually witnessed a bartender argue with a guest over a mistake that the bartender made. The guest was very calm. This place sucks. Go to another concourse."}
{"text":"Man oh man, what a mistake this was. I knew I was in trouble when I asked for medium rare and the guy said \"I'll put it in, but I can't guarantee it\". What does that even mean???? Well I sure figured out quick, as soon as the burger arrives. The patty is perfectly rounded, and even thickness throughout, Which tells me it was not hand made, or fresh. No juices running at allllll. No doubt this came out of the freezer. This  is happy meal quality. Oh let's not even get into the fact that they gave me the wrong burger. I honestly feel insulted. Steer clear!!"}
{"text":"It's the perfect preflight sit-down for the thirsty traveler!    In no way can I recommend this location for the hungry, but the bar menu is excellent for the preflight cocktail.  It's a great little place to burn some time preflight.  I purchased a couple vodkas on the rocks and they do provide a good pour!  Enjoy and have a safe flight!"}
{"text":"It's a bit of an oasis in tired-old Terminal A. Friendly, sit down waitress service and full Bar. But don't expect stoneware and metal flatware. It's a plastic forks, disposable plates, and flimsy paper napkins. I was actually glad I didn't order wings when I saw the cheap paper napkins. The Bacon Vodka Mary was unimpressive. The Pepperoni Flatbread was tasty and satisfying; but less light & crispy flatbread and more hand-tossed crust pizza. If I had to, I do it again."}
{"text":"Surprisingly a delicious and affordable place to get something to eat at the airport while waiting for your flight. My boyfriend and I both ordered a cheeseburger with fries ($11 a piece) and everything was tasty. The service was decent too. Glad we chose this place over the other options in the area."}
{"text":"Worst possible service. The bartenders are rude and drinks are horrible. When asked to change the channel on TV, they flatly refused without any reason. The food was just about average to bad. Ain't going back again."}
{"text":"After leaving the TSA area and heading to CLT's forelorn and neglected step-child Terminal A, Uptown Bar is the only place you can sit down and order food. Being the only restaurant, this place is obviously meant to turn tables fast to deal with the packed crowd.   The service is airport chaotic but swift. It really needs a host/hostess to seat people because the tables are every man for himself, and many 4-tops are taken by one man himself. Luckily a customer leaving asked if I wanted his seat at the bar.  The menu is pretty standard American fare: club sandwiches, BLTs, nothing fancy burgers and fries. Everything but the alcohol is served with plastic plates and utensils. My nothing fancy Mushroom & Swiss Cheeseburger was actually pretty decent and onion rings better than I expected.  My first choice of draft beer was out but good thing Uptown had Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. It would've been nice if they offered more local craft brews Charlotte is putting out.  The whole terminal, this restaurant included, is long overdue for a facelift."}
{"text":"I've been here twice when flying delta from CLT. Mainly because you options are limited on this side of the airport. But with that said The Uptown is pretty good. The service is really fast if you don't have much time to eat. We had the chicken fingers, nachos, and the steak sandwich. The nachos and chicken fingers were pretty good, but the steak sandwich was not the best."}
{"text":"The best service at any airport bar I've been to. Jessica, Amanda and Regina were so welcoming and warm at 11am on a Thursday. Really made us want to stay until our board time. You can tell they really care about their patrons. Anytime we are in clt we stop by here.  Thanks!!!!"}
{"text":"Came in for a couple of drinks while waiting on a delayed flight. Uptown manhattan. It's just okay but service was nice."}
{"text":"Uptown Bar is really your only sit-down dining option if you're in the neglected strip that is Terminal A. Service here was brusque but not bad. I ordered a turkey burger and fruit cup. The turkey burger was about as bland as I've ever had and based on the shape of the party and (lack of) flavor, I am reasonably certain that it was a frozen patty. The bun was blah but the tomato and lettuce were surprisingly tolerable. I was excited about having some fresh fruit with my meal until I spotted the long hair sticking out of the front of the fruit cup. Hard. Pass.   Also, it's rather odd that they use plasticware rather and plastic & metal trays as opposed to actual plates. They can do better. I don't write many two-star reviews, but sanitation issues are not cool."}
{"text":"This is an airport bar. It's not the classiest or the snazziest bar around, but it will get the job done. I had a while to kill after a test I had taken, not feeling great about it-so rather than wallowing in a bar in a city I wasn't familiar with alone and potentially missing my flight, I decided to come to the airport early and have a drink or two past security to decrease the possibility of doing so. '  The bartenders here are clearly used to people being down in the dumps because of people missing flights and the like because that was the first thing he asked me as I sat down. 2 glasses of wine later I felt better, especially considering I paid for one :) Not a bad place to kill an hour or five if you're in the airport and have nowhere else to go-maybe you will make a new friend."}
{"text":"Terrible food. All food was served in a plastic tub and clearly had just been sitting under a heat lamp for hours. Skip the breakfast all together. Pink berry, Jamba Juice and several other great breakfast spots near concourse C and D."}
{"text":"Food here is good pub fare, what really set it apart on my last visit through Charlotte airport was the service which was awesome. Our waitress Stephanie was very engaging with everyone in our section, ensured our food came out quickly and made sure we were comfortable. She was extremely attentive and always had a smile!! Helped with the stress of rushing through an airport."}
{"text":"There are a handful of places to hang out and have a proper sit down meal in the Charlotte airport. Uptown gets the job done if you're halfway down the A concourse and not interested in a Wendy's burger.  But they do have burgers and fries and pizza. And lots and lots of booze.  So if you're looking for a little dutch courage before you board your aluminum can, Uptown is the spot."}
{"text":"What do you expect - it's an airport bar. I ordered a chicken salad and it came in a plastic bowl with a lump of half-cooked chicken on top. My standards aren't high for airport-fare, but you can do better in this terminal ;)"}
