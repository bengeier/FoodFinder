{"text":"Awesome sno cone! The ice is so soft and fone, not chunky and hard like some places. They also have a great selection of flavors and the price is what you'd expect to pay."}
{"text":"It was my first time here and my family was so amazed of how so many flavors Pelican's has! A man that works there was friendly and playful. When my son peeked through the door from outside, he threw a snowball inside at the door. The snowball splattered on the door inside. My son laughed! And the man gave him a snowball to play with before giving him a sno cone. Our flavors were sweet and so good!"}
{"text":"Fun place on a warm summer night.

We tried the sour cherry, tiger blood and sour apple and they were great.  There are tons of flavors to try.

Lines can get long at times but it's worth it,"}
{"text":"Just moved here from NJ and since we live in the area we were looking for a place for a refreshing treat and boy we found it! I absolutely loved this place a whole lot of flavored to choose from back home I'm a big fan of Little Jimmy's rainbow Italian ice well I got a rainbow snowball and it was close but not 100% but I'll definitely take it and will be coming back again!! Great place for kids just have to keep a eye on them since it's located in a parking lot! It's worth trying folks!"}
{"text":"I arrived at this location 4/9/17 at about 5:15 pm and waited in like about 10minuets. When I arrived to the window to order one of the workers (a blonde in her mid 40's)  picked up some chocolate chips off the floor (with her gloves on) and moved some of the glass containers in which the syrup is stored to a nearby sink. She returned to her station and I requested that she changed her gloves (as she would be touching all the ice on any snow ball made) however she refused! Not only is this rude as I may also have food allergies but also VERY unsanitary."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this little place. Mainly because they keep kids occupied with certain activities offered on the premises such as bubbles and hoola hoops etc. It's all sugar and water and they don't let you sample which to me just doesn't work especially with the 100 flavors offered. So if you get something to try and hate it you're shit outta luck. I would go here again for sure but I'm more for brusters which is authentic and no artificial flavoring used ;)"}
{"text":"True New Orleans style snowballs with very fine shaved ice. Lots of traditional Nola flavors too, like wedding cake, nectar and condensed milk as an optional topping. They could use another ice machine as a few people in line can mean waiting several minutes to get the snowballs out."}
{"text":"Love it! Very addictive! Be sure to add the cream! The lines get long because it's just that good. A great evening sweet snack that's not too heavy. Music gets a little loud but it's manageable"}
{"text":"Cute little spot on the edge of Tega Cay and Fort Mill. Perfect spot for a post church treat or any hot day. Loved the shady spots under the trees and picnic tables with checkerboards, bubbles and corn hole. 

There are a million flavors and lots of suggestions. The local special like the Nations Ford High School, Panthers, Hornets and Many more are adorable, along with the treats for doggies (peanut butter and/or vanilla)."}
{"text":"I love this little shaved ice shop. It's very similar to the one's down in NoLa. It's got some great local flavors like Skittles. The kids love that. My favorite is pina colada. I would love to see Satsuma, orchid, more creams on the menu, but the service is great and I love coming here!"}
{"text":"Best \"snow cone\" I've ever had! Had flavor throughout the entire thing. I take my son here after school sometimes and we have never tried a flavor that we didn't like! Also, the doggie treat snoBalls are awesome & only $1. Our dog LOVED the peanut butter one! We will definitely keep coming here and I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Cute little local place for a snow cnocone, they have 100 different flavors. It's a great place to hangout on a hot days. Kiddie size goes a long way, because the flavors are on th sweet sides."}
{"text":"I mean honestly.. This place is so fantastic.. Cheap.. They load your cup, they are tasty, and they do not stain your clothes, and they have no high fructose corn syrup;) mad scientists I tell you.. Pelicans rocks and it is my face summer stop"}
{"text":"I lov the snow cream. My wife likes the strawberry lemonade. This place is awesome busy! Business must be good."}
{"text":"First thing I did when we moved here from NY was get snow cones, love this place.  It reminded me of growing up in the City with the people used to push the carts around on the hot summer days.  This place has a ridiculous amount of flavors to choose from and they are all delicious and they don't skimp on the ice, they are large.  Kids love it as well, you can sit outside and play with the lovely games they have."}
{"text":"I think our family has forgone ice cream in favor of snowballs.we absolutely love visiting all of their locations in Rock Hill, Fort Mill and York.we have even driven out of the way to visit the University location.the flavors are amazing and authentic, and the staff will give you suggestions as to their bestsellers. Our family's personal favorites are Creamsicle and butterscotch, but Nectar with cream is not far behind on the list.surprisingly cotton candy is also a really good flavor. The hurricane snowball is also not to be missed.plan on getting a size larger than you anticipate, because you'll definitely want more.  

Lastly, if you like to go for snoballs then you definitely want to buy pelican bucks. .for $20 you can buy $25 worth of Pelican bucks in coins.that's like a free snowball or 2."}
{"text":"One Of favorite places for a treat / desert.  Locally owned too. Bring your kids and dogs."}
{"text":"This is not your normal snow cone, this is better then ice cream.... I would not ever thought  a snow cone would be better then ice cream until I tried this... the ice is shaved extra fine, so it has an ice cream texture.   Over 100  different flavors.    Love it, love it"}
{"text":"My husband loved this place, staff is quick and friendly and we can't wait for it to open back up!"}
{"text":"There are so many flavors offered that it always takes me awhile to decide what to get. The avalanche size shaved ice is a really cool option especially in the middle of the summer when I could eat shaved ice all day. The pricing is reasonable, and my current favorite flavor is lemon (which has no artificial coloring). I've yet to try a flavor I haven't liked."}
{"text":"A true delight on a summer day or just anytime! I'm not a great traditional snow cone fan, but these are flavorful throughout with a smorgasbord of tasty flavors, sno creams and varieties of how you want your cone prepared! Try it \"stuffed\" and you'll have a scoop of vanilla ice cream in the middle of the cone. Prices are good and they are generous with the snow and syrup! They even have doggie cones and a dill pickle flavored snow cone for the truly adventurous! Love this place!"}
{"text":"We love this place. The shaved ice is just like snow. Then you get to choose from over 100 different favors. 

Kids - $1.75
Medium - $2.25
Large - $3.00
Avalanche - $4.00

All seating is outdoors. They have sidewalk caulk, hoola-hoops, cornhole, chess, checkers & bubbles for the kids. Great family atmosphere.  There is always a line but they move pretty fast. 

Opened from noon - 9pm daily. 

We strongly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Tastes like summer! Can't wait for South blvd location to open in Charlotte. Feels like a beachside snowcone stand with picnic tables and games."}
{"text":"I am a believer! All the other comments set high expectations for this location but Pelicans surely delivers! A lot of colors and fun games to do while you wait like corn hole and hula hoops! They are inexpensive, I'm talking $3.00 for a regular which is about the size of a red solo cup. They have a huge selection of flavors like one for every day of the year! All of the employees are friendly and welcome you instantly. It's kept neat, even for an outside attraction. A nice tree to keep you cool and shaded sits in the middle of the lot. A lot of options for people who are sugar free or gluten and fat free. There is something for everybody EVEN DOGS! Get your dog a treat for $1! There is a size for kids to keep them happy and toppings to perfect your snowball. This place is absolutely amazing."}
{"text":"This is a favorite hangout for my kids and I during their open season (March-October).  This summer my daughter is hoping to try all of their flavors in order to \"win\" a Pelican's t-shirt.  Yes, she has already tried the toothpaste (declared it good) and dill pickle (so-so) flavors.  The quality is outstanding - they are not like typical sno-cones that melt and have the top ice end up with no flavoring.  The flavor is just as good on bite 50 as it is on bite 1.  So great!  During the hottest part of the summer we probably go 2-3x a week...  We live close enough (just under 2 miles) that we can walk there and back and enjoy it completely guilt-free!"}
{"text":"It's shaved ice.  Hard to go wrong!  Facilities are in pretty poor shape, but I think it's that way to encourage you to not stay around the whole day"}
{"text":"I can't pass this place without my daughter begging to go! She still loves pelicans ice as a teen. We have been going here since she was ye high. Spring/summer time fun every time you step foot onto their sand. As you can see in the photos i captured here today ,you see a group of women playing giant checkers, to the little girl randomly hula hooping outside. All kids should visit here. I myself as an adult enjoy pelicans ice i swear with all the flavors i always still til this day get the red velvet cake,mixed with birthday cake flavor and marshmallow topping."}
{"text":"I love Pelicans! They have so many different flavors to choose from. They also have a very cute outdoor set up which is great for kids. I just wish they were open later then 9!"}
