{"text":"First time here, wasn't gona step in cuz reviews here are horrific lol but my boy eats here on a regular said it was good so I tried esp cuz it was his treat lol portions were hefty but food is flavorless. With sauce would be ok but they didn't give me any and I forgot to ask o_O no red sauce and no duck sauce n no soy sauce? Come on mannnn

Like it literally tasted like nothing lol which isn't baaaaaad but Def not good lol atleast it wasn't a lot of bad tasting food?

I'll go again if someone wants to go, I'd only recommend if you live in the area and are on a budget then yes."}
{"text":"Restaurant look disgusting smell weird . The food i order i did not like the quality for the money i pay . Chicken was uncooked rice was hard . For sure i did not  going back again."}
{"text":"I ordered sweet and sour chicken balls with rice for take out. The chicken balls were very stale, dry and hard. You can't even slice it with a knife nor chew it. I ended up throwing it in the trash. It was chicken balls possibly cooked the day before and just heated up for my order the next day. LEFTOVERS!!! The funny thing too was, it's an order that comes with 12 pieces of chicken balls with rice. My order was missing a chicken ball. Seriously?! I paid for old, stale left overs and a missing chicken ball! Smh!!"}
{"text":"Disgusting restaurant. Smells terrible, terrible customer service and dirty place. NEVER going back. I asked for spicy buffalo wings to go. Since I was starving and did not want to eat there, thought I would go home n eat. Guess what? I emphasized on how spicy I wanted it but when I went home and opened the box, no sauce, not Buffalo, forget spicy..it was the worst fried chicken wings I have tried. I threw it out."}
{"text":"Was hesitant at ordering at first as Yelp reviews are bad but a co-worker of mine told me that this is where they get Chinese food take out. 
So we end up ordering for our lunch at work. Ordered special chowmein, chili chicken, lemon chicken, fried wings and paid $40 plus $3 tip to the delivery guy. 

Chowmein - big container. Taste good. Co-workers love it.
Chili chicken dry- spicy and has good meat on it.
Lemon chicken- not really a fan but when i opened the styro. Its chicken pieces in thin batter and sauce is separated. Taste delish and big portions.
Fried wings- 14 pcs of good Chinese wings. 
This will be our new take out place for lunch for me and my co-worker."}
{"text":"First of all I don't know what these people are all talking shit about. The food here is great the place is always busy with people enjoying their food there. And as for the odour... it's a Chinese restaurant restaurant you're going to smell chinese-food. I suggest going in and getting a chili chicken lunch special you get two spring rolls, egg fried rice, Chilli Chicken, and a soup for 8 bucks taxes in. The service is very friendly and many people enjoy going there because of the service."}
