{"text":"For some reason, the map shows this place at Finch and Bayview, but it's actually at Bayview and Cummer, in the valu-mart Plaza.   I came here with my brother and my family and was pleasantly surprised. We ordered the dinner sushi sets while husband ordered the gamjatang and it was awesome. We each got a delicious soba starter, which my little devoured, broth and all. And then the food came.  Seriously, the gamjatang is such a good deal for 4 giant bones of pork ($9). The broth is nice, but not as spicy as I'd like. The 3 banchan dishes complemented the soup perfectly.   Our sushi sets were fantastic. At first I was skeptical since the prices were a bit higher than I was used to for a similar combo, but once it came I could definitely see why. Not only was the presentation amazing, but it also came with an amaebi! I never see those on a sushi combo meal! So I was already excited the second my plate hit the table. The rice to fish ratio was perfect, the seafood fresh, and it was filling!   The service here was also great! They had little cups and cutlery for my kiddo, and were quick with the water and tea refills. Kid friendly for sure (no boosters, only high chairs), and the booth rooms look like the perfect cozy place to hide away. I was so happy that we tried this place, and I'm definitely marking this as a go-to place in the future!"}
{"text":"Came here with the wife on date night and decided to try Kaikaki. When we stepped into the restaurant we noticed the nice decor, lots of wood used throughout the restaurant and we were seated in small but cute little nook. my wife ordered a couple of rolls and I had a teriyaki Bento box. I must say the rice used in the sushi and rolls was quite mushy. Quite disappointing. The teriyaki chicken I had was flavourful and well cooked. The tempura was crispy and generous in portions, and the sashimi was fresh. All in all, the experience was OK, hopefully they'll improve their rice game if and when I come back in the future."}
{"text":"This used to be Kori Sushi Excellent food - many Korean and Japanese dishes In particular their sushi was very enjoyable. A great experience, I'd come back to try their Korean dishes!"}
{"text":"Excellent service. The staffs are amazing. Very attentive and accommodating. There are many individual rooms even for two people. Great place for date night. I love it how they serve free appetizer the soup noodles- crunch noodle soup, noodle and crunch bits in fish broth. I really enjoyed that. The Ebi sui mai- shrimp dumpling was tasty aswell.   I've ordered the sushi dinner, beautifully presented. There were flower patels. The small sweet shrimp tasted very fresh and sweet. The fish to rice for portion for the sushi is good. The avocado in the California roll is very fresh.   Taro chips were very good and fresh. Will be back again!"}
{"text":"My favourite goto restaurant in North York! Hidden gem indeed. Perfect rolls, rice never mushy, fresh ingredients, super friendly staff and reasonably priced! Kaikaki special roll is my personal favourite."}
{"text":"Not that I'm saying that they import rare fishes off the shore or the chef brings a gazillion years of sushi mastery to the table, it's the effort you'll notice from every piece of the dishes as long as you're human. I just wish this business stays long, so I could enjoy the artwork every month :)"}
{"text":"Food was great. We had the party boat with sushi & sashimi. 66 pieces for $60. Lots for 3 people. I am tired of AYCE that are expensive and poor quality  food. Redecoration is nice. Food was quick. Only note would be serving staff was slow after dinner."}
{"text":"This place recently opened at Bayview and Cummer. After a recommendation from a family member, we decided to try it! It's easy to miss - it's in a corridor area within the plaza. The shop is quite cozy, with maybe 6 private room/booth areas (fits about groups of 4 people), and 5 tables in the open area of the restaurant. It's decorated really cute actually! You can tell that a lot of attention was paid to the little details, from little string lights in lanterns placed around the shop, decoration sake bottles in every room, to the dishes used for the food.  We came on a Sunday afternoon. While we were there, there were 2 chefs and one waitress. The restaurant wasn't very busy (probably due to it being new), so we didn't need to make any reservations for a group of 8. We were given two tables pushed together in the center of the restaurant.   They have a wide variety of lunch specials available here, and they are pretty affordable, starting at $9.99 for a sushi and maki set (8 pcs sushi, 6 pcs california roll). Their lunch sets also come with miso soup, salad, and ice cream. We even got a complimentary mini soba. The quality of the sushi was good but not amazing, but the plating is what made this place stand out. Usually lunch sets come in standard bento boxes, but they plate the sushi similarly to how a higher end sushi restaurant downtown might. It's definitely a place you want to take someone who really appreciates the ambiance of a restaurant.  I'd definitely come again!"}
{"text":"This place is cute inside, but with just one server running around between 10+ tables (and the poor thing was legitimately running every time I saw her), it's just sad. The owners need to hire more than one server for their dinner service. That being said, she was nice when we did manage to get her attention.   Overall, the food was decent, but nothing spectacular. Portions were also quite small.   At least this restaurant breathes a fresh breath of air into this otherwise dying plaza."}
