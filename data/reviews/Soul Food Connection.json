{"text":"I ate here the other day, it was delicious! I had fried chicken, collard greens mixed with cabbage ( awesome) & black eye peas. I brought a fried chicken home  for my daughter, she also loved it. The owner is very friendly & so are the customers. I would go back."}
{"text":"I love their food I get the fried chicken wings, yams & green beans!! delicious. I eat there all the time!!!!"}
{"text":"Soul Food Connection is the absolute real deal! Great food and good people in an honest independently owned location. I love the fried chicken, black eyed peas and greens. Go there! It's take out mainly but you can eat there if you like."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years, the food and service is always great. I stopped in the other day after work but I forgot to take a picture of the menu. I almost always get the smothered chicken with a side of macaroni and cheese and greens. I am never disappointed. Really good food and good people. It's definitely worth a special trip to Wilkinsburg even if your not in the area. I haven't lived in Wilkinsburg for years but whenever I have a taste for Soul food I wouldn't go anywhere else. My church has even used them for catering before and everyone loved it!"}
{"text":"I just had a hugh take home ribs, greens and Mac cheese dish. It is the first yummy god like this I have had in Pittsburgh. Very very good"}
{"text":"Stopped in yesterday for the first time and I must say I'll return before I leave Pittsburgh"}
{"text":"This place by far has some of the best soul food in Pittsburgh and many other places. I ordered fish, chicken, black eyed peas, yams. Everything was well seasoned and tasted like a true home cooked meal. The restaurant is a family oriented business and takes pride in its food. If you are looking for some soul food that is worth spending your money on, please try this resturant"}
{"text":"My favorite fried chicken in Pittsburgh. The ribs are so tender. Also don't skip the sweet potato pie!"}
{"text":"Great! I just had there food at a funeral and almost bit my fingers off. The baked chicken fell off the bone and the mac n cheese and sweet potatoes were very good. The desert was good as well. I sat at a table with various genders and ages, and there were no complaints. Even my 4 yr old inhaled the food. I'm impressed. Great service as well. Thank you black men for providing great service and great cuisine!"}
{"text":"Got a 10pc fried chicken family meal w/ collards, yams, and four rolls for about $16. Food was excellent, staff was friendly. I plan to return after realizing it's a short walk."}
{"text":"So food-wise, this place is amazing.  All of the traditional soul food classics with amazing flavor.  When I'm craving fried chicken or fish, mac and cheese and collard greens? This is the spot.  Plus the staff/owners are lovely to interact with. Slow, but lovely.  But good grief do they need to do repairs to the restaurant itself!  It's hard to ignore the peeling wall paper and crumbling ceiling, not to mention that there is an odor when you walk in the door.  Best bet is to call ahead so the food is ready to be paid for and picked up as soon as you get there."}
{"text":"If you haven't had fried chicken at the soul food connection then you haven't had fried chicken.  They cook it up like they invented it!  Expect steaming moist crispy perfectly spiced breasts and wings, tender corn bread to soak up the sauce, and gooey baked Mac and cheese to show you how it's meant to taste.  While many soul food spots are just rib shacks with a grill, a counter, and bare walls, this has plenty of seating, jazz posters, cozy wallpaper and framed newspaper articles about their well deserved success.  It's owned by a very friendly couple whose kindness and love for the customers can be tasted in every bite.  After soul food, I normally get the itis and have a coma/siesta, but after lunch here I felt awake and energized!  A clear testament to their natural ingredients and home made recipes.  Why not 5 stars?  To me, greens and bbq ribs are the pinnacle of soul food.  The collared greens didn't taste freshly made and the ribs were good, but not great.  Smokey but a little dry and the sauce was too mild and light bodied for my taste.  Still, for catering or BBQ, you can get 50 chicken pieces for under $50 and no one does fried chicken or hospitality with more soul than the soul connection!"}
