{"text":"Food was good but a tad overpriced for just good. Ordered the cocktail special which they were out if so the waiter offered an alternative which I took. Unfortunately for me they charged me full price. Won't be going back here."}
{"text":"A group of friends and I went to experience a tasting menu at Raw Bar. The restaurant manager began by telling us about the chef and how they were proud of being recently rated the second best restaurant in Calgary. The setting itself is very clean and modern. We were all really excited.  However, the meal itself was a disappointment.   Each course came with a custom cocktail. On average, our table enjoyed less than half of what was offered.  The first course was a duo of one bite offerings. Both were interesting and had great flavor.   The appetizer was solid, but seemed to have very little Asian influence.   The soup was OK, but likely more sweet than you'd hope and was served barely warm. We were not told if this was done on purpose.   The steak was chewy and not near the quality you'd expect for a small portion and high price.  The dessert was an intense, dense lemon cake that no one at our table finished.  It's possible the tasting menu was not a fair representation of the daily menu, but this experience did not make me want to go back to find out."}
{"text":"Very tasty steak! wicked apple cake with bacon for dessert."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and the service started out strong but deteriorated after the first 10 minutes.  Our party of 5 ordered several tapas and main courses. Food was good, not great. They tend to add a TON of sweetness to every dish--even the steak, which masks the true flavours of the food. No feature \"derelict\" cocktail available the night we were there, which was a disappointment and no apologies for that.  The waitress kept clearing our dishes before we were finished and basically rushed us through our meal, even though the place was half empty. We arrived at 7 and were pressured into ordering dessert by 8 pm!  Even when we asked her to delay dessert, it came right out so we were out of the restaurant by 8:30.  They could have made more money off of us with after dinner cocktails if their service staff had not been rushed to get us out.  The place was pretty slow for a Saturday night in June, and with their limited menu I can't see it surviving this economic downturn.  Would not personally return unless they change things up."}
{"text":"We went to Raw Bar on Father's Day. SLOWEST SERVICE EVER. I was first (as in not late for once in my life) and waited a half hour before the waiter even asked me if I wanted something to drink. He came by, dropped off water. It was horrible service for the price we paid, though the food was pretty good. Their portions are fairly small as well. I wouldn't go back. Both restaurants in Hotel arts have been disappointing."}
{"text":"Always fun to hit the RawBar Pool on a hot day but the service is horrible. Everyone seems miserable and the service is is extremely slow. Also why would you make your servers wear black on a hot sunny day? I would be miserable too"}
{"text":"Went here for drinks and snacks, was late on a Thursday (after 11pm) and I don't know why but I was expecting the kitchen to still be open and it wasn't.  Instead I ordered a delicious rasberry drink that had ginger beer, I think it was gone in 2 seconds. It was SO good. Normally I don't like berry juices like cranberry but this was so light. If only I could hire the bartender to make those for me all summer in my back yard? Hmm....  Delicious! After looking at the menu I have to head back for dinner some time.   The look of the place is amazing - dark, sexy, comfortable."}
{"text":"If they dropped in a live jazz band and you'd have a Calgary destination   Raw Bar is a classy restaurant in a boutique hotel near Calgary's downtown. Extremely friendly and attentive service. Excellent appetizers, terrific main courses, and some nice desert options. We thoroughly enjoyed our entire evening, and left commenting that if they had a live jazz band playing in the corner, it would truly be a Calgary destination."}
{"text":"I'm prefacing this review by saying that this 2 star rating is for the food. The service I give a solid 4. It took a while to be greeted by our server and we had multiple people help us through the night, but we later were told it was due to being short staffed. All the ladies that helped us were very nice and made sure to check in with us throughout our meal. Chose Raw Bar because I had the pleasure of drinking a fantastic cocktail created for the Yelp Engineered Eats Event.  The menus here is simple. It was recently rehauled, still having its Asian influence.  My bf and I shared the crispy sweet potato and ginger spring rolls to start. They come with a coconut soy sauce dip. They were delicious, though a bit pricy. We got 3 small rolls for 9 dollars. My Vietmodern Coffee was decent, adding some cognac to an Americano with condensed milk foam. I enjoyed how it wasn't overly sweet like traditional Vietnamese coffee but could have been a stronger flavour as far as roast goes.  My bf's Peach Old Fashioned was perfect. When your lips hit the glass, you really smell the peach flavour and expect it to taste sweet. Nope. In the mouth, it had a nice little kick to it, quickly switching to smooth once you swallow. Amazing how all these sensations hit you in a matter of seconds.  So why the 2 star review? Our main courses. I had the black bean noodles with crispy tofu and 63 degree egg, my bf the pad Thai.  My noodles were drowning in the thick brown bean sauce. It was heavy but lacked any flavour at all. I'm not sure why they mention the egg was cooked at 63 degrees. It sat prettily on top of my noodles, but also lacked that rich, fatty taste of a good quality egg. The tofu wasn't crispy , and I could only get through half the meal because of all the sauce.  My bf's pad Thai on the other hand had no sauce, or so it seemed. There were some juicy shrimp and lots is veg but the only flavour I could taste was ginger. A ridiculous amount of ginger.  We could have complained about the food sure, but our poor servers not only had to deal with being short staffed but also being bombarded by a giant number of younger people who crowded the main bar. Most weren't even drinking. The servers apologized to us for all the  noise they were making. Of course it's not their fault, but the couple beside us left due to the large group's obnoxiousness. I felt despite the steep price tag for a lacklustre meal, they had more than enough on their plate to deal with that evening.  Would I come back to Raw Bar? Definitely for a drink, but that's about it."}
{"text":"Raw Bar has undergone a physical and menu revamp recently, switching out the hot red for a powdery blue while retaining the sleek lines, and swapping out high-end stylized meat-and-potato for small-plate-focused \"Vietmodern\".  I have previously had occasion to try several of the bites and small plates, and they are pretty good. Some are refreshingly off the beaten path or presented uniquely, but to be honest though, you are paying a premium for the venue for some of the appies. I mean, your hole-in-the-wall restaurant spring rolls start at such a high deliciousness baseline that there is only so much fancification you do to try to justify a double digit price. What you DO get for the price is a hip atmosphere, excellent service, and a great selection of cocktails.  While Raw Bar has been known for its cocktails for years, the wife and I found the menu uninspired last year. Luckily they recruited Christina Mah to the restaurant and it's all on the up and up again. The thoughtful combinations of herbs, bitters, sweet components, and liquors make drinks more of a peer to the food than an accompaniment. Of course, you can come just for a drink too!  Pressed a bit for time, on our most recent visit we forwent the small plates and tried two of the half dozen or so main plates. The salmon steak was crispy and well seasoned, and the vegetables (squash, colored carrots, and green onion cores predominating) were perfectly cooked. The spicy soy sauce served on the side lets you usefully customize the salt and heat.  We used it to fix my wife's under seasoned Pad Thai (see below). Wrapped in a large leaf packet, the rice was not the best, nor the worst I've experienced in town in terms of texture or flavour. Call me a rice snob, but assuming they buy top quality rice, I wonder if the leaf packaging was put together for modern visual appeal at some cost to traditional mouth appeal. I'm sure this would be an easy thing to tweak.  Conversely, the visually appealing Pad Thai (a menu staple for some years), has been reinterpreted into a more subdued presentation. While I can appreciate chef Duncan Ly try to put a twist on the classic by employing a (really delicious) panang broth, I think a traditional noodle dish form factor would have worked better. In its current form, the broth to solids ratio leaves a lot of the noodles and plain Jane veggies high and dry. Once again, this could be fairly easily remedied by thickening the panang.  In sum, the new Vietmodern incarnation of Raw Bar has a cool atmosphere, spendy small plates including some unique and well presented choices, *great* cocktails and service, and nice mains that could use a few tweaks."}
{"text":"I'm so sorry to say, we didn't like this restaurant at all. We had a bad experience with a less-than-fresh oyster so it probably tainted (sorry) our impression, but even so, it was not a great evening out.   We decided to have lots of appetizers and then share an entree which seemed wise because all the appys looked really yummy. For the most part they were uninspiring, although to give credit where it's due, we did enjoy the calamari.  For our entree we shared the burger and fries, which was fine but nothing exciting.  My hubby, who's from the South and has a lot of experience eating oysters told the waiter how surprised he was that the oysters were served in salt and not ice, especially in a land-locked locale, but the waiter wasn't sure why that would be an issue.  To their credit, they comped us half of the oysters (because of the bad one) and were really appalled and apologetic about it. I had a Dealfind coupon so our meal was super inexpensive. I think if we hadn't had the coupon we would have been resentful of being charged for the oysters at all.  We were so turned off, we didn't stay for dessert. I'm not sure we'll go back, which is too bad, because I had more coupons!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner, got food poisoning.   Went with the girlfriend for dinner. The design and decor is very cool. It is very dark so people watching is not really an option.   Ordered the lamb chops and the gf ordered the sashimi noodle salad.   Was extremely underwhelmed with both entrees when they arrived.   The lamb chops was 3 small pieces of lamb (about 1/4 of a full ring). It came with oversauced and overcooked peas for $36.   The sashimi salad was sent back after one bite. The fish was NOT sashimi grade, it tasted very old and a poor quality cut. To top it all off, the \"sashimi\" still had the skin attached. I eat sashimi at least once a week, I can say that I have never had a piece of salmon that bad before.   The waiter came back saying that the kitchen agreed that the salmon was subpar and that it had been delivered that morning. So apparently their supplier is selling them fake sashimi grade fish and no one in the kitchen noticed. I think that says something about the calibre of the kitchen staff that they didn't catch this until it was sent back at 10pm at night.   Overall, it may be a decent place to have a drink or two but try out Taste next door if you want a decent meal."}
{"text":"If I had neverending deep pockets o cash, this is where I would choose to do my drinking.  Raw Bar is gorgeous, sexy and chill. Red, white & black decor will seduce you. Comfy sleek lounge chairs will enfold you. The dozens of suspended glass balls over the bar will impress you. And the drinks will entice every fibre of your being that salivates for something new...for something way off the beaten path.  I haven't eaten here yet (so I will someday be back to update this review) but I'm really here to lead you by the example of a single drink. It's called the Snowglobe. It is $14. Thus I can't give 5 stars cuz, well, ouch. It was something like vanilla vodka, galliano, soda, roasted lemon zest, curly cucumber strips and white carnation petals. Not only a clever take but a divine meshing of tastes. This kind of drink makes you feel really special and Raw Bar pushes the limits by combining thoughtful decadent flavours.  I've checked out their current drink menu and now that I've piqued your interest, you'll be sad to know The Snowglobe isn't there. But I can tell you that the Sabai Soul still is with its 7 year white rum, vanilla vodka, coconut milk, lemongrass ginger beer and kaffir lime leaves. It will knock your socks off too if you like any of these ingredients. It's Thailand in a glass.  Raw Bar's drink menu is EONS ahead of everywhere else. Extravagant quality. Be seduced."}
{"text":"My Husband and I, along with a couple of friends, decided to go to Raw Bar for a drink late in the evening.  I had been to Hotel Arts before when my sister stayed here, but never had gone to Raw Bar.    This place is magical.  I was taken back by the cosmopolitan decor and atmosphere.  We choose a small table in the middle with 4 large chairs.  We were greeted and menus were brought to us.  The drinks all sounded amazing.  I decided on the pineapple mojito.  It cost $15, so it had better be amazing I thought to myself.  It didn't disappoint, that drink was heaven!    We all chatted and enjoyed a second drink.  This place has money and style written all over it, but it was quiet and had a laid back feel. The service was excellent even though we didn't try any food.  I loved Raw Bar and cannot wait to return.  I'll be saving my pennies!"}
{"text":"Why is it that most things that Hotel Arts touches turns to gold? My place of employment has used their catering several time with tremendous results. So I was expecting good things from Raw Bar seeing as how they are under the HA umbrella. Floored, I was!   Dinner and dessert consisted of Haida Gwaii Halibut and Yuzu and White Chocolate Cheesecake. The golden beets and arugula complemented the tenderness of the halibut. Taste-wise the bitter/sweet/light fish flavour collage were a beautiful marriage; however, the textures of the mix were also a marvelous meld. Semi-solid beets with tender fish ... Art! The Cheesecake was ok. It felt too sour for me though.  However, what earns Raw Bar its five stars are its cocktails. The two cocktails I had were among the best in my life. The Yuzu Sunrise was so citurs fresh it made me actually enjoy my Vodka (not my spirit of choice). However, the winner of the night was Blood and Sand. Besides having the coolest name ever for a cocktail (sounds like another US-military-in-the-middle-east-Hollywood-movie). The name also made ordering my drink fun. In a deep-voice and fist clenched I dramatically ordered my drinking stating \"I want Blood and Sands.\" Always a bonus when you can do that! The surprising thing about the drink itself was that it made me finally find a Johnie Walker cocktail that I actually love. 2 for 2!  Decor-wise I love it here. The subtlety contrasting red-orange and green shades blend beautifully. The crowd is young and hip. And the DJ spinning in the background is the perfect cherry on this fine dine sundae.   It isn't cheap here though, but sometimes its nice to go somewhere that is hip, cool and makes awesome cocktails. Well done RB! 4/30"}
{"text":"Before you Raw fans get yourselves all worked up, my review is based on Breakfast alone.  I can't speak for the lunch or the dinner, so I'll go back and try those too!  Can I just talk about how sick I am of boring breakfasts?  Especially when you pay $15 for the buffet, which is really just a continental breakfast that most Best Western's offer for free.  The food was so blah.  I probably won't even think about it after this review is done.  There were the usual suspects: yogurt, bacon and of course dry scramble eggs.  Don't the chefs want to even try to make their buffets exciting?  I would much appreciate it if they did.  I also want to talk about the chairs and tables.  If you are going to have a chair, can I at least have it cover most of my back.  I get the whole modern/retro thing, really I do.  But why sacrifice comfort just to look cool.  I feel like an old man complaining about my back being sore, but if I'm going to pay $15 bucks for a boring breakfast, can't I at least be comfortable?  Raw is just another example of how Calgary is still in desperate need of a good, tasty and reasonably priced breakfast place.    We are taking offers!"}
{"text":"Over the weekend, I was deflowered by Raw Bar at Hotel Arts. Can I just say: What A Cool Place!  Not only was I feelin' the vibe, the music, the crowd, the decor, the location and the ambiance, but the prices weren't as outrageous as I had initially assumed that they would be, and the service was impeccable.  I have yet to visit Raw Bar during its evening hours, but even in the afternoon, it was the perfect place to escape the city, chill with a friend, and dapple in snacks and bevvies.  One thing's fo' sho: I'll Be BAAAACK."}
{"text":"A++++. Food, service and atmosphere is amazing. Cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"Drinks here are amazing, and if I only came for cocktails it would be a solid 5 stars. But I also ordered dinner which was a huge letdown. Our bill was over 100 dollars for food, and I've never been served such tiny portions in my life for that much money at a restaurant that's not notorious or high-rated.  We ordered a \"large plate\" that legitimately couldn't fill up a child. When we asked about the size of the plates they said \"it's all tapas style\". So why even advertise large plates if they aren't large on your menu? Kind of a rip off. I wish I took a photo of our food to show just how small everything was.   And for such expensive food, in such tiny portions, it wasn't even great food. All of it was bland except for oddly the cheapest dish we got, which was 4 pieces of cauliflower for 8 dollars.  If you're going to charge such a crazy amount for \"tapas\" style plates, at least serve worthy meals that taste good. And not call them \"large\" plates. So not worth it"}
{"text":"Was very disappointed with the service we received. Drinks took over 20 minutes to get and then the waitress described the drink wrong to me. Our waters never came and she came back to ask if we wanted another drink when our meal was half done. We ended up cancelling our other drink order and just paying and went down to Model Milk for more food and wine where the service was fantastic.   I do have to say that it was nice seating outside by the pool and the food was delicious."}
{"text":"I just wrote a negative review for another restaurant, so I thought I should write a positive review for a place that is actually good. I have eaten at Raw Bar a couple of times and have not been disappointed. Every item that we have order here has been exceptional. You can tell that the chef and kitchen really care about the quality of food that they are sending out. I have found this hard to find these days. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Have eaten here numerous times and have always enjoyed it, and last night we popped in just for drinks and dessert at around 10:30. The main dining room was empty (kind of sad to see on a Friday evening) but there was a birthday party up in the more private area at the back.  Cocktails are pricy at $12 for a 2 oz, but they're very yummy. My favourite is their signature drink, the Derelict.   They have handmade chocolate bars in rotating flavours in dark, milk and white ($4.50 each). We tried the milk which was a hazelnut and tasted like an upgraded Ferrero Rocher.  The chocolate sticky rice pudding ($8) was interesting, but not my favourite thing. The chocolate taste was muted and the texture was odd - a jelly-like feel to it. I was hoping it'd be more similar to a Thai sticky rice more so than a dense cake. It was served with 3 pieces of chocolate that was house made Crunch bars.  The star of the night was the Vietnamese iced coffee panna cotta ($8). Velvety, creamy condensed milk custard layered with a milk coffee custard and topped with a coffee gel. Omg. I couldn't get enough of this. Soooo so good. Please don't ever take it away!  The service was very friendly and our drinks were kept topped up all night. It did take a while to get our bill and then another wait for the machine to pay, but other than that, excellent visit."}
{"text":"Have you ever had a good bubble tea and thought to yourself, \"Man, this would go great with some booze?\"  At Raw Bar, this is a fantasy you can fulfill, among others. Located inside the heart of Hotel Arts, this restaurant is a great place to listen to some weird-ass music with your homies, drink fermented pineapple foam and dare someone to drink Vietnamese spicy pickle juice for a Loonie. Not that you need to dare anyone to drink it. It's tasty. I'd totally put it in my water bottle for the gym.  Service is excellent, the adorable servers really know the menu well and have no problem offering genuine sounding suggestions. You never have to wait too long for a water refill, or feel like someone is hovering over your every move.   I love that they have vegan and gluten-free options that everyone can appreciate, and taste amazing. As well, the cocktails aren't the same pretentiously snoozy cocktails you see everywhere else.  Prices are pretty much on par with most places downtown. Definitely not inexpensive, but a nice place to celebrate with pals without feeling like you're breaking the bank.  Bonus: You can park in Hotel Arts' garage, and bring your receipt in to Raw Bar. They will validate your parking!"}
{"text":"It has been a while since I had been to Raw. A group of us were out for a friends birthday and were looking for a place enjoy. This review is can be broken down into three components: Food, Service and Vibe. The dishes that we had were all quite good and none of us had any complaints. I'm a raving fan regarding the Salmon Tataki. The service was really good. Our waiting was right on top of things. What put us off and held us from staying for entrees was the vibe. I did like the audible level of the music, great for conversation, but the restaurant looks run down and dated. We were amused at what appeared to be a few tables on their first dates and the mood was brought down by the guy sitting in the corner with his computer watching everyone. It was then determined that Raw has the vibe for a place to bring someone you would not normally take anywhere else you would be seen in public with. Just my thoughts."}
{"text":"Great vibe at the raw bar... The food is great and they also have DJ spinning some sexy chill tune on Friday and Saturday.  Unique place in Calgary."}
{"text":"This trip was fabulous! I took some of the summer off, so my girlfriend said let's go sit by the pool at raw bar for an afternoon. OMG YES!  Again super slow, and again not busy. But we weren't in a rush so it was ok, once we had our first drink, which I went preseco (love!).   They only had one big lounger by the pool, the rest was chairs and tables to sit at. We didn't feel comfertable sitting in our bikinis while people were eating lunch, So we decided to eat, then we'd set up camp, as there was a couple guys still in the area packing up to leave.   My girlfriend had the shrimp and avacado salad, which she said was super good. I went the Artisan greens, which was really good to. The weather was a little off that day, so it was sunny, cloudy, sunny...etc. Once we were done, another person had taken the lounger, so we just left. Still good though."}
{"text":"I decided I had to at least try one night of \"Yelp Eats!\" and found Saturday night a convenient night to drop and to say hello to my Yelp-pals. Props to Sabz for representing for Saturday!  I had the lobster thai bisque and the angus burger. The bisque was good and it was interesting to taste a bisque that used coconut milk as an alternative to cream. But in honesty I think they should've stuck with cream. The broth tasted like a Filipino seafood stew I couldn't quite get my finger on.The angus burger was delicious and meaty but I was really impressed with their fries, which was simply garnished with parmesan cheese and rosemary. We had a lengthy discussion about fries and agreed that the best pieces are the tiny crispy kernels that always fall to the bottom of the basket, where it acquires a high density of seasoning.  The atmosphere of the lounge was great. I enjoyed the music which wasn't loud enough that we had to yell at each other. and the room wasn't too crowded with people. We definitely stayed around for a long time and enjoyed the conversation.  I'm not sure how much our bill came to exactly, but Wendy figured that we bought 80 lunches with the meal our group had alone (as every dollar donated to Yelp eats goes towards a children's lunch). There is going to be one FAT kid walking around this city!"}
{"text":"I love Raw Bar. Where else can you get a family sharing platter (with 7-9 dishes) for $35?   The food is Asian inspired and always pretty to look at and even better to taste. On top of that, you can get deliciously cold beers (Chambly/Sapporo, etc.) for only $5.00 on Fridays (until 8pm).   Two new dishes I sampled was the Deep-Fried Chicken Thighs (juicy, crunchy with a sweet glaze) and an incredible Grilled Prawn Salad w/ noodles in a peanut satay sauce. Great place for date night or a girls night. You get value at Raw Bar, particularly if you take advantage of their drink specials. I heard that Duncan Ly is moving on from Hotel Arts :-( I'll follow Duncan anywhere... I hope he stays in Calgary. We need him!"}
{"text":"Don't miss out on this awesome happy hour where all the appetizers are half off, cocktails are $5, and oysters are a buck a shuck!!! I really enjoyed their take on asian dishes. We tried quite a few small plates but my favourite were the spring rolls - they were quite heavy/meaty but sooo flavorful! We also loved the beef tar tar and lobster avocado rolls! Our server was very friendly and helpful. This place is a little gem tucked away in Hotel Arts."}
{"text":"A - List. Recommended. One of the more interesting places to visit in Calgary. Inside the Arts Hotel downtown. Interesting club like atmosphere. Good service. The food is excellent. In general, very small, high quality and creative portions. This is a B-Back."}
{"text":"My first weekend as an Elite, and I dropped the ball. I really should have taken a few notes about all the spectacular food I had here, but we were celebrating my friend's birthday. There were new friends to make, and old ones to catch up with, you know how it is, right? The drinks came quick and went down quicker. I'll do the best I can to tell you about all the flavors. It's hard to concentrate and be mindful of descriptions when you're eating art.  The menu is small, but it's still really hard to decide. It all sounds so good! Luckily, in the corner of the menu we found one of those deals where for $35 per person, you could have an assortment of menu items, served family style and it would include a dessert for all to share. All ten of us agreed.  The first bites were beautiful salads with julienned vegetables and grapefruit segments that splash the palate with citrus fireworks. Tomatos and crispy noodles added dimension and texture. The albacore tuna with pear was incredible. I don't like fruit with my meat, but this dish sang to me. The pancake? Divine.  Main courses included a nice medium rare sliced steak in herb pesto with mustard dressed salad. The salad included snap peas and that cute lettuce that looks like green coral. There was also a tender barbecue squid dish that was obviously the servers favorite. He gave us a lovely speech testifying to it's freshness and perfect tender mouth feel. He was not wrong. I should point out that almost all the dishes involved some kind of salad, but they were all different and all tasty. Come to think of it, I didn't taste anything that night that I didn't like.  Dessert was obviously excellent. Lets see...Coconut tapioca pudding topped with roasted puffed wheat, mango mousse,  espresso chocolate mousse tarts, handmade artistic truffles that boggled the tastebuds, and a dark chocolate 'Happy Birthday' sign.  I wish the tarts and truffles were easier to share, but they made us smack our gobs. The pudding was the biggest hit. It was light, not too sweet and the roasted puffed wheat shreds on top added a texture and flavor I'll remember for a long time.  They added an 18% gratuity, and I feel it was well earned. We all had a fantastic time."}
{"text":"The decor is dark and dim which to be honest is how I like it but may be too dark for most. The service was pretty good and my glass was always full with ice tea before I could run out. The food was mediocre for the price. I'll probably go again to try a few more items on the menu and see if I went on an off night."}
{"text":"The food was Awsome highly recommend the Mushroom Rice and the Fried Chicken.  The staff were very friendly and the abiaunce was very nice.  you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend went a year or so ago. Raw bar had a really nice atmosphere. And the food was great. I thought it was a bit on the pricey side, but taking into consideration that it is located in the downtown area and it is really trend.  I cannot say anything about the atmosphere in the evening, since we went in the mid-afternoon and it was really nice. The waiters were super nice to us and knew when to give us a little bit of space to breath and enjoy the food."}
{"text":"I am a very new yelper and let me just say how much I love you Yelp.  I wanted to go for an unforgettable meal with my partner to celebrate simply how amazing we are together.  And I researched the highest rated restaurants in the city.  I wanted something funky, avant garde and breathtaking and thanks to the Yelp crew I found it.  Raw Bar at Hotel Arts has to be one of the best dining experiences I have had in my life.  And I have travelled the world folks so this statement says a lot.  From the moment you enter the doors until you leave you are transported into a culinary journey.    The foyer of this hotel is so well decorated with modern art and welcoming staff.  It is like visiting a very posh, stylish and hip place in New York City, yet it is not pretentious and is most affordable.    We were led past corridors of abstract art and furniture to the alcove entrance of the Raw Bar; we were immediately seated in this moody, red lit, modern restaurant, with the most impressive layout.    The waitress was delightful and quirky, water with cranberries and lemon were brought to the table.  And we splashed our palates with: for my sweetie a canton swizzle (whole lychees and fresh grapes that are pulverised with fresh lime and ginger ale) and I a lemon tree (a flute of sparkling plum wine blitzed with a fresh lemon sorbet).  My drink had a good amount of alcohol in it, Raw Bar is very generous when pouring drinks.  We started the evening with delightful salad of beets, pear, pine nuts and camembert cheese. My partner had the Pad Thai and I had the Brazened Rib with an artistic rouse of creamed potatoes and scallops.  We then rounded off the meal with coffee and a pumpkin, white chocolate cheesecake with dribbled caramel sauce.  All this in total came to under 100 dollars; which was unheard of, I nabbed 5 business cards to hand out to friends.  By the time it was 10 the place was full with bling and fashion.   Everyone there was in the high spirits and we realised that we were amidst Gemini award celebrations which gave the evening an even more Celebrity tone.  I will return many times to this establishment.  It is truly one of the finest hotspots in Calgary, thanks so much fellow yelpers you are doing a truly amazing job of highlighting the best we have to offer here."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great music, great food, great service. Great great. Don't know if the server wanted to laugh at all my jokes but she did! It's a really special place. Especially, live music Thursday's"}
{"text":"I've had a couple of cocktails and the odd appy at Raw Bar, but last night was my first full dinner. I was surprised it wasn't a little busier. Maybe everyone else was enjoying their cocktails poolside. What, wait? Poolside? Yes, one of the charms of Raw Bar! You don't need to be a hotel guest to lounge by the table with one of their summer cocktails when the weather's warm. If you're there for a cocktail, I've had the Tea Jito and the Maple Colada. The Tea Jito is well worth trying, while the Maple Colada is an interesting take on a Pina Colada. I'm not usually a fan of Pina Coladas, they're just too coconut-y, but the Maple Colada cut down on the coconut, though I don't think the maple flavour was all that evident. Maybe the pineapple overpowered it? Not sure.  Anyway, dinner during Yelp Eats was inside and it was great. I was tempted by the $45 Chef's Tasting Menu, but opted for a couple of items from the regular menu.  To start, we ordered the Dungeness Crab and mango roll. Lovely presentation, it was sliced into 8 pieces and made for a nice appy for a few of us to share. This is the kind of sushi I first started eating back when I didn't know any better and didn't really like sushi. It's a pretty safe appy for all. It also came with a bit of calamari on the side. That I loved! Another of our party ordered the BC Spot Prawn and papaya salad roll. Also not a bad starter in my mind, though if you've got guests with you that get weird about food texture, they may not enjoy the \"roll\" part of this appy.  Next course for me was the Heirloom tomato salad. It came with soft goat cheese (have you ever seen hard goat cheese?), forest mushrooms and aged balsamic. I liked that the aged balsamic came in a little Chinese spoon at the edge of my plate so I could decide how much or how little of it to drizzle on. The server bringing me my salad told me the tomatoes came from Lethbridge and were grown on vines more than 100 years old. Really? 100 year old vine? That didn't seem possible to me. And yet, a brief internet search brought up a few results saying this very same thing! Either way, the salad gets a 3.5 star rating. I think it could've used a few more pieces of goat cheese. Also, I'm no tomato expert, but I do like my tomatoes sweet (the Roma tomatoes I ate in Italy spoiled most tomatoes for me, except for grape tomatoes, I could eat bucket loads of those, popping them in my mouth like candy). These were not all that sweet, but they were firm and a lovely shade of red. Definitely on par with a good ol' Alberta right off the vine.  For my main course, I ordered the Pad Thai. It was incredibly plentiful! Which is great if your walking in famished from a day of exploring Calgary. Don't get your hopes up on authentic Thai food though, Raw Bar is not the place for that. I didn't think it had quite enough spice in the sauce and it was more a bowl full of noodles and I don't think they were stir fried. Don't get me wrong, I still ate about half my order and brought the rest home for later.  I wish I had room for dessert! Instead I opted to finish off with a cappuccino, which came with rock candy to sweeten it. Tasted a-ok to me!   If you're having trouble finding a spot to park, the website mentions surface and underground parking at Hotel Arts. So check with the boys at the front door.   In retrospect, part of me is happy the resto wasn't busier last night. By about 830 it had filled up to about 2/3 capacity, but the noise level remained low and the DJ kept the tunes to a nice background beat (Sabz & Angelo, I was right! That piano bit I was trying to figure out IS from American Beauty http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=al21Vtlsg4A). Our party trickled in between 7 and 8 and we stayed until nearly midnight chatting.  What would I improve about Raw Bar? A couple of things in the decor. Raw Bar feels like a theatre set to me, which also means it feels a bit unfinished. Sabahat N noted the curtains along the walls and felt like something was missing at the bottom of them. And though the red chairs look cool, they're hard when you sit down in them and complete that feeling of a theatre set. But maybe that's the point? It is Hotel Arts after all...."}
{"text":"We had the set menu last night (NYE 2014) and it was magnificent. I am chagrined to say that this was my first time at Raw Bar- even for drinks- but won't be my last. Of course, the regular menu wouldn't include the same things as the NYE one but I'd love to have something like the lobster-crab thermidor or the sea bream roulade in red curry that I had in the context of a multicourse menu last night but as a larger plate with some nice Jasmine rice- the kitchen was consistently amazing, every course. The space is gorgeous and very open, good space between tables, not at all what I expected. Class act, great choice for NYE and I can only imagine how beautiful the experience is in warm weather with the poolside patio."}
{"text":"Came here for a yelp charity event and it was fun! The food was quite good but perhaps because I had heard from a couple of my friends that raw bar was \"AMAZING!!\" or \"\"the best\" my expectations were not fully satisfied.     To be honest the thing I liked least about this place was the vibe. Weird lighting, strange music, that didn't quite fit the mood, it just felt off a little or incomplete or something. It just had a slight identity crisis. BUT it was still cool and I did enjoy the experience.  The food was all good, well prepared though not super memorable, I would go back here again though and hope to come again spring time. I would say its definetly worth a try! And some cool food and drinks that they are known for . RAW"}
{"text":"We were staying in the Arts hotel and this seemed to be a good food option. They had a nice selection of Craft cocktails to start off with. The bartender seemed to be legit and knowledgeable. My fiancée started out with the happy hour raw oysters for 99 cents each. The were great according to her and they looked very fresh. The presentation was great also.  We are both gluten free and they had some good choices. I got the bahn xeo which was excellent. Light and fresh with a great dipping sauce. Serving was ample too. My fiancé had the STIR-FRIED BEEF & PRAWN RICE NOODLES which were also great. Over all the food was fresh, interesting, and well prepared. Staff was great. Highly recomended"}
{"text":"We've been here previously when Duncan Ly was the head chef, and the food was amazing! So my girlfriend and i decided to go here once again to find out that the menu was changed and no longer viet fusion themed. We ordered some appetizer which were sub par, and tried two large entrees which we couldn't finish due to the dishes being too salty and flavours were not appealing for taste buds. However, the staff was great and very accommodating with our dissatisfaction, that being the only reason for the 1 star."}
{"text":"The moment I walked into Raw Bar, I immediately fell in love with the set up of the place. Very chic, hip, modern. Our hostess/waitress was very kind throughout the whole night and extremely helpful, especially with ordering drinks and entrees. She recommended the Dungeness Crab & Mango roll for myself and my goodness was it delicious. My boyfriend and I also started off with the beef tacos for appies and I was surprised with the way they arrived - fresh, crisp chip like tacos with sliced steak topped off with onions and tomatoes. Very unique, I was impressed over all with the quality of these simple dishes.  After a few martinis, definitely try their Derelict martini if you like lychee soho, and their mouth watering vanilla bean cheesecake I was quite the happy camper. I would come here with friends just to hang and have a few drinks every weekend!"}
{"text":"It was very good... They have a good deal for oysters in the afternoon!.. Which I really enjoyed!!... The spring rolls were delicious!... The pad Thai was very good too.. Not the best in town, but not bad... The cocktails are just awesome!!.. I think they have Very nice options for cocktails, and the service is very very friendly!.. I definitely would go back there, only for the oysters and cocktails. The food was good as well... But the cocktails were just outstanding!..."}
{"text":"Fantastic, happy hour. They could expand the selection, but the 3 food items and wine choices for $6 each is pretty reasonable.  The food is full of flavor, fresh ingredients & friendly service."}
{"text":"I really liked the food and drinks at Raw Bar. I expected it to be a sushi bar, but it's more of an Asian fusion restaurant. The duck was delicious and so were the drinks. Service was great with music and tvs showing sports in the background. This restaurant is great for hotel guests and locals alike."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here twice. 1st time during our honeymoon and 2nd this past weekend.   We chose a different appetizer, meal and dessert from what we had the first time and honestly everything is just simply amazing.  You cant go wrong with Raw Bar and any time we come to Calgary we will make sure to stop here.  Side note: On our first visit, we were given a plate with strawberries dipped in chocolate with the word \" Congratulations\" written on the plate. Very sweet of them."}
{"text":"The decor is very chic, the staff so well-intentioned, friendly and helpful, and the presentation of the food was so beautiful.   However, the food leaves a lot to be desired.  Me and a couple of friends went here in the evening, and ordered a bunch of appetizers :  Trio of House Marinated Satays: the meat did not seem marinated nor satayed.  There were some good dips, but the meat (chicken, beef, and lamb) was a tad dry.   Halibut fish tacos: the fish was extremely bland and the most flavour in this came from the tortilla wrap!   Not what you want!   Dungeness crab roll: this was good, I was curious as to what was on the outside (not seaweed!)   Braised beef poutine: a tad salty, and cheese curds were not quite melted.  But kudos to them for actually using cheese curds all the way out in Alberta! Charcuterie Board: Pretty good.  Liked the venison sausage, and the incorporation of pickled schmidji (spelling?) mushrooms.   Artisan Greens: pretty good, liked their in-house pickled carrots.    Dinner and drinks for each of us came out to about $35 each.    This would be a good place to impress a date, provided that your taste buds are slightly muted."}
