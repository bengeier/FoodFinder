{"text":"I am a regular for friday work lunches. Item of choice: Special Rice Noodles!"}
{"text":"I order based on what I saw on Yelp, thanks everyone!  Love Curry Laksa (love the spicy kick) and Pad Thai!  Gotta try the other dishes next time."}
{"text":"Food seeker beware:  The food at this Thai location utterly left my mouth in disgust. We ordered several items on the menu and each one was a disappoint one after another (maybe it had something to do with the containers of premade sauce and the use of a microwave). The kitchen was visible from the outside; not a single stove top was used. Despite a fully functional kitchen, the chef believes that a microwave will deliver a better flavor. Please, avoid yourself from this dissatisfaction.   P.S. if you decide to not heed this warning, please bring exact change and your own utensils. The cashier tried to pass off a $100 bill as $50 and did not apologize when giving me the wrong change. She also did not provide utensils."}
{"text":"The best Thai food out there I would try gulai if you want something very spicy or curry laka if you want noodle soup best noodle soup ever."}
{"text":"I frequent FMP at least once a month and will almost always (99% of the time) order up my favorite dishes at Malay Thai. Just a heads up that I am from Singapore and I know the difference b/t the wannabes and the authentic hawkers.   Malay Thai is authentic. I meant to pick up a menu and list the items that I usually order but forgot to do so. I will next month.   So for now, I will discuss their  1) Wat Tan Hor Fun - my fav dish. Seriously!!! Best in GTA. They stir fry their noodles first so it has their pan-fried taste and texture. And they use the RIGHT kind of flat broad rice noodles (thank you!). Their sauce is amazing and true to the  core. And the ingredients are plentiful (pork / shrimp / choy sum). Finally, this is not too spicy for the HK folks. Though as you can tell from my pictures, I like my chilli. And yes, green chilli goes with this dish. Please don't use belachan.  2) Belachan Chicken - first time ordering this and loved it! I hate deep frying anything at home so I welcomed this dish. You can totally taste the shrimp paste in the chicken (which was fried perfectly crisp yet tender). The  belachan (minus shrimp paste)  goes with this dish perfectly. Would reorder. Only caveat: could totally feel my arteries popping as the oil oozed down my fingers. I am soooo gonna pay for this.  Note: you get a cup of barley drink with this. Ahhh ... childhood memories ... . It is sweet, healthy, and a perfect complement to the spicy food I was digesting.   For the record, the price is very reasonable for this sort of cuisine (hard to find) and the service is great (very friendly).  My only caution: I have been disappointed with their Hokkien Mee and Johore Mee. So you might want to skip that."}
{"text":"Cost: Very affordable, food court Quality: 80% Decor: Food court itself is reasonable, clean and sometimes get to enjoy special events Value: 90%  In terms of Malaysian foods, some of the items are really is as good as it gets. My friends and I are regulars and we always order Curry Laksa (Singapore Laksa), Wat Dan Hor (may seem a little bland to some) and Nasi Lemak though the curry chicken that comes with it could be better if not overcooked (either overcooked or too much potatoes that somehow thickens the curry."}
{"text":"Price are reasonable and food is ok. Wan tan hor, Malay fried rice, roti with curry chicken and Malay fried chicken was good. But prawn noodle was tasteless, I would try again prawn noodle. Btw, I like balacan source they made."}
{"text":"This restaurant provides decent tasting dishes at reasonable prices. I personally try out only the Singaporean and Malaysian dishes as they are harder to find around the GTA compared to Thai dishes. The dishes I have tried along with their ratings are listed below:   Malay Style Seafood Salad: Terrible. Consists of a few mussels, shrimps, chunks of imitation crab meat, and tomatoes garnished in vinegar and crushed peanuts. Texture of mussels and crab meat was firm--almost as if it was undercooked or prepared the previous night and refrigerated. Not recommended. Score: 1/5  Malay Fried Chicken: Decent, especially when consumed with the included hot sauce. Texture and aroma vaguely resembles that of a Chicken McNugget made with real chicken, which is actually tastier than it sounds! Score: 3/5  Curry Chicken with Roti Prata: Curry chicken tasted ok. Roti tasted great, especially after being dipped in the curry. Score: 3/5  Fried Chicken in Spicy Milk Sauce: Consists of chicken chunks fried in some kind of spicy, milky batter. One reviewer mentioned that this dish was \"to die for\", but I disagree--while this dish may indeed kill someone considering the enormous fat content, I found the taste to become progressively more bland with each chunk of chicken consumed. Thus, I'd recommend eating morsels of the included rice between each chunk consumed to \"freshen\" the palate before the next chunk is eaten. Score: 3/5, with caveats  Curry Lakhsa: Likely the most delicious and expertly prepared item on the menu. As other reviewers have implied, curry lakhsa is this place's specialty and the quality can easily compete with the lakhsas of Restoran Malaysia. If you're only going to buy one dish from this place, get this one. Score: 5/5  Kuala Lumpur Mamak Mee Goreng: Pretty decent spicy noodle dish with shrimp that vaguely resembles Shanghai Fried noodles. Score: 3.5/5  Nasi Goreng: Decent, though spice factor is lacking a bit. Perhaps ask for  \"extra spicy\" to increase the flavor level a bit. Score: 3/5  Nonya Fried Rice: A spicy fried rice dish that contains mostly the same ingredients as Nasi Goreng and also includes tiny strips of cuttlefish. Meat pieces were pretty sparse. If you're looking for a filling meal and are forced to choose between this and Nasi Goreng, choose the Nasi Goreng. Score: 3/5  Hainan Chicken Rice: Decent rice + free range chicken dish. Unlike the chicken used in the other dishes, the chicken in this one tasted pretty fresh. Score: 3/5  Recommended dish combo: Curry Lakhsa + Roti Prata   Overall Score: 3.5/5 (rounds up to 4/5 for Yelp's star rating system)"}
{"text":"Went today and got the Curry Laksa that everyone is raving about. Did we miss something? It was \"ok.\" Not sure if I will return.  Also, crappy disposable plastic bowls and spoons too small to be useful. They should take a note from the pho place two stands down and give reusable dishes."}
{"text":"Had the Laksa here for lunch today.   The first couple of bites were okay, but as soon as I bit into the egg noodles, something did not taste right. I had a perfumey/soap taste in my mouth every time I had a bite of the egg noodles. I think they must have ran cold water and soap to cool down the noodles or something. Or something had a soapy residue. YUCK.   Did not even attempt to eat the rest. If you want laksa, avoid this place and go to one2snacks in Scarborough."}
{"text":"My favorite place in the food court. Five stars all day. There's lots of bbq places in Markham. This place is different and makes really good food"}
{"text":"Good price, good portion, good taste. I love their self serve homemade chili sauce, fresh chilies and tomatoes, very refreshing!"}
{"text":"Ordered a curry laksa and LOVED it.  I haven't much experience with laksa (I've ordered it perhaps two or three times), but Malay Thai's version was the best thus far. It was super flavourful, very creamy, and very rich. There was also a variety of toppings - though the chicken was cut into super small and broken pieces. There was the wonderful aroma of coconut milk and lemon grass!  One thing I found slightly peculiar was that my laksa noodles had a mix of egg noodles, as well as thin rice noodles. I personally preferred the thin rice noodles, but it was an interesting mix of textures!  I will definitely come again next time, to try their nasi lemak!"}
{"text":"What a find this place is. All this time I've been trying to fill a SG/Malaysian food void that is inexpensive,I would never have guessed that a small counter in a chinese food court could do just that.  While we've only tasted one dish, the hokkien mee, my wife's immediate reaction is, \"I can't believe we've been going to Restoran Malaysia just to have these stuff\". Obviously the food here isn't as good, and the serving isn't as large, but at half the price minus the tip, the food is decent enough for me to opt for this place 9 times out of 10 if i needed a fix.  I'd be surprised if I find anything similar and cheaper. While I say that I'm thinking to myself that nasi lemak here is $6.25 and this is one of the cheapest meals you can get in Singapore at maybe $2 average but I'm gladly gonna let this one slide.  Some items listed in the Menu: Hainanese chicken rice, kway teow, laksa, hokkien mee, hot and sour soup, Nasi Lemak... I can't believe a menu in a food court of all places has gotten me so excited to come back.  food - 3, prices - 5 = rating 4"}
{"text":"Went here again... not for their vermecelli, but for the curry laksa everyone was raving about. It was so good. Very spicy and bursting with flavour- I don't have anything bad to say about it. I also tried their roti, which was pretty good too. I would definitely go back for the laksa. Yum!  And yes, it's freshly prepared so there is a bit of waiting, but I call it a good thing.  Again, the service was good, and I like how the meal came with the barley drink- goes well with spicy food."}
{"text":"I came here today Nov.12.2014,   The food wasn't that great, I pref one2snacks ~ It was lacking coconut flavour in the soup..  didn't really like the fish cakes, or chicken that much either  And service on the other hand was meh.. they didn't really give me any choices like how i like the noodles/soup (aka. spicy or mild) or.. my tea..   Plus i forgot to ask them to change my noodles.. and when i asked they didn't seem too happy about it .   overall 3-star. Maybe will be back if I am craving Laksa when ONE2SNACKS is not open~"}
{"text":"Remember the fake org**m (bleeped out to escape Yelps filters :) ) scene in When Harry Met Sally --- well I almost recreated that scene the first time I tried the Curry Laksa from MTFC. By the way, I am not a Malaysian food neophyte. I am ex-Malaysian. I have visited Malaysian restaurants from California, New York City and up to Toronto. This Laksa is one of the best. So deep and rich, so flavorful, so yummy, my mouth is watering as I am writing this review.   I strongly recommend you try it."}
{"text":"Better food than Restoran Malaysia. Their Curry Laksa is awesome, so many flavours, so tasty, just thinking of it makes me drool. The wait time can be a little long-ish, but there is a reason because every dish is made fresh from scratch.   My wish list - if they can add a few good Penang dishes to the menu like asam laksa. I am allowed to be greedy, no?"}
{"text":"So 2 years later, I finally came back to give this place a second chance. I would bump the rating up half a star, but since Yelp doesn't allow half stars, I will leave the rating unchanged.   I had the Curry Laksa $7.50. It had fried tofu (which I gave away to my dining companions who ate at different vendors in the food court), fried fish paste slices (which tasted mostly like flour) and chicken (small broken up pieces). It didn't have any shrimp :( It had egg noodles and vermicelli. There were also a lot of bean sprouts. The broth smelled and tasted strongly of coconut milk, lemongrass and curry. The broth was too rich and creamy for my taste though.   Service was nice and quick. You get free hot tea with your meal. The tea was not bitter this time. I didn't have the choice of barley water this time :(  Overall, the food was ok. I think the Laksa was better than the Pad Thai I had last time, but I didn't feel like it was anything special."}
{"text":"Saw the Yelp...had to help my self!!!  Item Ordered: Fried chicken with Spicy Milk Sauce and rice.  I am not going to review how good this item is, since there are countless confessions on  how this is an amazingly battered fried chicken (popcorn style almost) coated in a savoury spicy sauce full of flavour for only $6.50  Only thing I have to say from my first experience is that even though it seemed like the place was not busy at all. The regulars place their order and hold their seating and wait for their order to be ready.   Me on the other hand - stood in front of the counter for about 12 minutes, watching items being put on a tray and very small asian ladies appearing from nowhere grabbing them and disappearing back to sea of trays and bowed heads chewing down on all the different kinds of Asian cuisine's served in this food court . David Blaine shhhh..... So I am guessing that the norm is to expect a wait time. Take a seat and have your eye on the counter.  Overall- Bang for you buck, and a treat for your taste buds!  I'll be back *arnold voice*"}
{"text":"This is located in the back corner of an open food court - very easy to find. There are plenty of seats for everyone to share too.  I heard about their curry laksa and had to come try. The portion is pretty generous for about $7 to $8 and the cashier has always been very friendly. The dish is also very good, though I haven't had many curry laksas before. They offer other dishes too, but this is the only thing I've tried."}
{"text":"Was looking for a place for pad thai and came across the decent reviews for this place.  Ordered the pad thai as well as the laksa to try.  Laksa got good amount and combination of ingredients and a good spicy kick to it. Hadn't had much experience with laksa and the only other one I've ever tried was from the chain Malay eatery called Toast Box in HK. This place is good but I prefer laksa from Toast Box more.  I do like the pad thai here. In fact, it's a really great find for food court. Like the taste of the tamarind, lime, peanuts, fish sauce, and whatever else they put in it :) Also love the barley drink that comes free with the meal. Light, refreshing, feels healthy drinking it.  Price was definitely very fair for this quality in a food court.   Will definitely come back for the pad thai, and maybe even try some other dishes when I'm ever back in First Markham Place."}
{"text":"This place is one of the best in Markham to have laksa with the right amount of spicy kick ( very hot hot ) and in that plastic bowl that it comes in, it is surprisingly very hot and stays warm until the end. I love the soup because it's full of good flavors and the tofu squares totally soak up all that nice soup flavor. The noodles are great too because not too soggy. They often give alot and I usually can't finish it to the end, although I really try hard because it tastes so good.   Price point is good because it is also located in the food court of fmp. It is tucked away in the corner and usually there is not a long wait for the food!!   I am very satisfied with my order every time.  Highly recommend and I keep going back!"}
{"text":"No one ever told me being a Yelper requires immunity to EXTREME chili-spices.  When I met with a few best-of-the-best Yelpers at Malay Thai, intuition told me to begin sweating and blowing smoke out my ears in preparation.   3.5'd  These Yelpers are serious with their scoville spice intake as they snort peppers inbetween their exponential reviews.  If you guys told me earlier, I would prepare by eating spicier chilis, coat my tongue in oil, and bring some milk.  My status is spice-sniffer in-training...  Curry Laksa EXTRA Spicy($6.25)  I tasted the thick rich curry with coconut milk hint and was flavourful until tongue starts tingling.  Ingredients top the plastic bowl and I was surprised that the bowl didn't begin to melt.  Again the dreaded yellow noodle is not one of my preferential variety(personal taste) and the spice level prevents me from chugging the liquid gold ramen-style.  Penang EXTRA Spicy Gulai Sauce($7.48)  Looks like Malaysia version of Gumbo.  Chicken, Okra served with plain white rice.  Another deadly dish and from the looks of the rice, it could have been warming for awhile which for some reason I always prefer it when it's for soaking up liquid material.  Fresh solid granules don't have that same absorbancy.  I wish I had some bread, naan, or a choice of noodles that can soak up the sauces.  Nothing wrong with Malay Thai at all, simply just not my cup of curry."}
{"text":"You don't see too many fast food thai places! They are just recently starting to pop up in fast food places in the GTA.  This Malay Thai place is in the First Markham Place food court. It's one of a kind goodness.  Some of the dishes I recommend are the Tom Yum soup - you get a super big bowl, the roti with curry sauce - loves it, and the coconut rice - which I eat plain! I love coconut rice!   As far as fast food is concerned, this place is pretty darn good! It beats Spring Rolls any day of the week!"}
{"text":"Came because of the Yelp reviews. Really wanted to try the fried chicken in spicy milk sauce? Was totally let down.  For reasons completely unbeknownst to me, they were only serving like 7 dishes today. They had a single 8 1/2 x 11 sheet of white paper with handwritten writing saying \"today only serving: ...\" and no prices. Okay. Fine. Since we made the trek up to Markham, I might as well order something. Ordered the Malaysian fried chicken. $5. Getting nervous. When our order was handed to us, the box was really light. Like 2 pieces (think drumstick and thigh) of chicken light. Turns out it was more like 10 chicken chunks between the size of a quarter and a loonie. They weren't particularly flavorful. They were also very dry (and tough to chew). What was Malaysian about it? It came with a small container of hot sauce that tasted slightly of fish sauce. Yep. $5. Not expensive, but definitely not worth it.   Will I come again? Highly doubt it."}
{"text":"I've never tried curry laksa before but I read recently that Penang Assam Laksa is ranked 7th out of the 50 most delicious foods in the world. I figured I had to give it a try.   The word around town is that Malay Thai has the most delicious and authentic curry laksa around. That was good enough for me to head down alone on a quiet Monday evening. It wasn't very busy so my food was out within 7 minutes.  Well. Let's just say I've discovered my new favourite dish. It was delicious! The curry soup and coconut milk blended fantastically with the dried tofu, fish cake and shredded chicken. The flavour was rich and the spice factor was nearly perfect, not too liberal and not too conservative.   The portion was large and I felt very satisfied when I was finished.   I should note that as I have never had laksa before I am not a good judge of whether the dish served here is truly outstanding relative to other places."}
{"text":"The curry here is excellent and is way above par for food court fare!!  You pay a fraction of what you would at a sit-down restaurant.  I highly recommend the laksa, which will make you sweat."}
{"text":"I had to hunt for the restaurant and found it in the back of food court in the mall.  I was disappointed in the food.  I got the nasi goreng and it was just greasy fried rice with a fried egg on top and some shrimp.  I know that's what nasi goreng is, but I expected more flavor from spices and there wasn't any."}
{"text":"i thought i wrote a review but i added a tip. Well the fried chicken with spicy milk sauce is to die for!!!!! i heard people come and order that specifically.  If you haven't tried it out then what are you waiting for???? indulge in the best fried chicken, Asian style."}
{"text":"Ordered the basil fried rice today and it was mediocre but the mee goreng is really worth a try!   Tough to find this place while it's surrounded by similar stores in a food court but glad I checked it out!"}
{"text":"I've only tried the hainanese chicken with rice here, and I've definitely had better. The chicken was pretty good. It was juicy for the most part, but some of the pieces did taste a little dry to me. The sauce that came with the chicken was alright. It had a good level of spiciness, but I wasn't really a fan of the strong chili flavor.. I found it a bit overpowering. The chicken oil rice was a little disappointing. The chicken oil flavor was too subtle for my taste, and the rice was too dry. I couldn't help but feel like their ratio was off (too much rice compared to other ingredients), but this may be a matter of personal preference. There was also a thin layer of rice at the bottom that was soaked in soy sauce, but there wasn't enough of it for the large portion of rice they gave me. I wish I ordered the curry laksa instead because I saw pictures of that afterwards on Yelp and started salivating.. I'm definitely going to order that next time instead."}
{"text":"Just found this place on a desperate search of yelp on a Saturday night and it was so good we decided to come back the next day. Food is unique-- not a lot of Malaysian food in the GTA and it's flavourful and satisfying. The ingredients are good quality and the prices are right. Found a new go to restaurant!"}
{"text":"Eh,I admitted that their food was ok and not pricy at all compared to other Malaysian food in GTA but not reached 4 stars. Some yelpers reviewed it as the best south-asian food, thus I expected too much about this restaurant. I ordered the Laksa, which added lots of coconut milk into curry soup. It should be more flavourful and the two kinds of noodle in the soup were just so-so, not very authentic. This place deserved one try but not good enough."}
{"text":"Second visit today. Ordered the Fried chicken in spicy milk sauce the first time. So-so.  Today we got the Laksa and mamak mee goreng. Laksa: lots of meat, strong coconut taste on the soup and less spicy than other places. Normal amount of food for $6.99 Mamak mee goreng: Lots of meat again. And not that spicy. A lot of food for $6.5 though."}
{"text":"This place is located in the food court of First Markham Place  mall. Used come here often for their Thai mango chicken. Haven't been here for a while and was in the area and decided to drop by to get some food. Was disappointed they removed the mango chicken along a lot of other items. I ordered minced chicken with basil on rice. It was good."}
{"text":"I came here after reading a lot of good reviews about this place. Unfortunately, the food did not live up to all the hype.   I was very interested in trying out the laksa since I haven't had one after my visit to Malaysia many years ago. The service was fast, efficient and friendly. My order came out relatively quickly and I was quite excited to try the steaming hot bowl of curry laksa. The portion was quite generous too.  My craving for a good traditional laksa was left unsatisfied after having the first bite. Maybe my expectations were too high? I am not sure but even if I wouldn't have know what authentic laksa tasted like I wouldn't have liked this dish. The noodles were quite thin and I wasn't a fan of them. The chicken and tofu were ok. At that price point it wasn't a bad deal. They only accept cash."}
{"text":"I've never noticed this in FMP foodcourt until a friend bought some takeout from here yesterday. It's definitely a good quick Malay/Thai fix!  Not sure the exact name but we had:   - Laksa - soup was good! came with chicken and dried tofu - Green Beans - good flavor, texture and not too oily - Pad Thai type noodle - Pineapple Fried Rice - could use more pineapple   Also the combo meal came with barley water - much better than soy milk!"}
{"text":"Food here is fantastic!!! Prices definitely reasonable. Their Malay coffee is just flat out excellent.   Suggest coming early as it can get full pretty quickly!"}
{"text":"I saw the CBC report about this place having amazing laksa and happened to be at FMP a few days after so I tried it.  I was SOOOOO hopeful that it would be as good as everyone says it is and maybe this was an off day.  However, I found it just okay and not even like a close second to South Asian Malaysian in Scarborough.  The broth was really thin, bland and lacking in the really creamy rich flavour and texture that you expect from a laska.  The noodles were nice, two different types.  I always love the fried tofu sponges.  The level of spiciness was just right.  Enough to tingle but not enough to make you cry.  I think I'll try one more time just to be sure.  No, I'm not a laksa expert but I know what appeals to my taste buds and this one doesn't."}
{"text":"If you like Malaysian food at a good price this is the place for you. Located in the food court of a popular Chinese mall in Markham, First Markham Place, this little food stall is incredibly busy on the weekends.  Such is a testament to their authentic Malaysian food, economy prices and consistent quality.  This is some of the best south-east Asian food you can find in the GTA served in a Styrofoam container.  Try the curry laksa noodles that's positively brimming with two types of noodles (egg - yellow thick and rice - white thin), chicken, fish slices, veggies and bean curd. All swimming in a beautiful curry and coconut milk spicy soup that literally makes my mouth water thinking about it.  Several true Malaysians have commented to me that this particular dish is very authentic.  The curry and rice dishes are incredible as well.  Try the yellow curry chicken with rice that also features the smooth and creamy flavour of coconut milk.  Feel more like a noodle dish?  Try the \"chow kwai teow\", which features sliced beef and veggies mixed with the broad flat rice noodles and stir-fried to perfection in a dark egg-y sauce.  There are many items on the menu that are worth trying like the Penang \"Ha Mein\" (shrimp noodle soup) and their variety of other curries.  All items are well under $10 and party sized trays are available, simply ask.  I am in total agreement of Lynda W., the quality (if not presentation) of these dishes far exceed the faux-Asian counterparts such as Spring Rolls.  A more appropriate authenticity comparison would be with the superb sit-down restaurant, Restauran Malaysia, with which Malay Thai stacks up nicely without even considering the significant difference in price.  Give it a try, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Malay Thai changed its menu.  I like the old selection better.  The food now is still good.  I just don't like the minimized selection.    Highly recommend Malay Thai for down to earth Southeast Asian food.  Tastes from Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thai are available here.  My favourite is Indonesian fried rice.  It is bold, rich and spicy.  My breath smells bad after lunch.  So good!"}
{"text":"$6.99 Curry laksa noodle soup. I thought the soup was a bit on the salty side. There was some chicken chunks, fish cakes and tofu. I thought the meat was a bit lacking. Could have maybe used some shrimps. Noodles had good bite to it.  Not bad for the price."}
{"text":"I usually get the pad thai here and it definitely is on par with the pad thai in Thailand. The staff are from Thailand and speak Thai + english. Once they hire someone to speak canto and mandarin for them, this place will flourish as they serve a reasonably priced authentic Thai experience."}
{"text":"I can't believe people think this place is better than Restoran Malaysia. It's simply not even close. Granted I might have ordered the wrong thing, but seeing the reviews for this place clearly I expected consistency throughout the front.  Mind you, the pad thai I had was not bad. It's simply seeing all the reviews for this place that made me upped my standards, and it greatly disappointed me. I guess I shouldn't complain much since it was only $6, so I'll give it a 3-star.  PS: Green and red peppers do NOT go with pad thai."}
{"text":"Very good Malay food. I had the Nasi Goreng and it was spicy and delicious. The price and the portions are very reasonable. In retrospect, I would defiantly visit and order something else on the menu again."}
{"text":"Rubbish lack of flavor food. I was not at all impressed. It is located in the food court of the mall."}
{"text":"Been a regular customer to Malay Thai for the past few years. Malay Thai is located in the First Markham Place Food Court. I always get the Hainanese Chicken Rice here because they make it pretty good for the price. The owners here are really nice and they are pretty efficient. If you want a quick fix for Hainanese Chicken Rice, I would recommend eating here."}
{"text":"After reading all these glowing reviews, my husband and i decided to order take out tonight.  Ordered the laksa (not bad for the value, it came with lots of shredded chicken, few slices of fish cakes and fried tofu...I still prefer the laksa at Kiko) green bean stir-fry with rice (no complaints, portion was huge and costs $6.50), chicken with roti, and Tom Yum.  We were really disappointed with the chicken roti-portion was tiny to begin with, and the few pieces of chicken we got (3 to be exact) also came with huge pieces of bones attached to them. Roti was extremely oily.  The Tom Yum was the worst- it gave us both instantaneous headaches. All ths only cost us $25 including tax, but its not worth the beating our bodies took today."}
{"text":"Whenever I ask my Malaysian friends where they go for good cheap Malaysian food the answer invariable comes down to 2 choices, One2 in Scarborough and this place Malay Thai.    Being a Malaysian newbie decided to try 3 of the more popular dishes: Laksa Noodles, Char Kway Teow and Hainanese Chicken and Rice.  The food was good especially the Hainanese Chicken and Rice which to me is more of a comfort food as it reminds me of the food that I ate growing up... Personally I would have liked more of a spicy kick to the Laksa and Char Kway Teow but then again I'm a chilli head so I can see why the spice factor is kept in check:)  Service was quick and friendly and the food was packed well for a drive home take out.   A good option in the food court."}
{"text":"OK, I will weigh in my vote on the great Curry Laksa debate.  I think the Curry Laksa is better here than Restoran Malaysia.  Both are great restaurants and Restoran Malaysia has several great dishes.  But this place is tops in my book for Curry Laksa.  My wife and I only order Laksa when we come here so I can't comment on the other dishes.  I can say, having been to Singapore and Malaysia, that this place makes an authentic curry laksa.  And by the way, some of the best restaurants in Singapore are food court style restaurants just like this one.  That's the other thing, it's a food court!  Value wise, it's a great deal.  The fact that this restaurant is going head to head with Restoran Malaysia tells you something about the food quality.  And check out the Yelp reviews from Malaysians who have eaten here.  If you want authentic, restaurant Curry Laksa at food court prices, then you can't go wrong with Malay Thai."}
{"text":"Who would have thought a little food stall inside First Markham Place would have serve such tasty food??!! Thanks for fellow yelpers! If not, I would not have know what I been missing...   The prices here are so reasonable. Most of them comes with a free drink.   I was there on a weekday! Yes this place is just as busy on a weekday lunch hour. I order the Curry Laksa extra spicy ($6.25). I have to tell you I waited over 15 minutes for my order. There were all these people that placed their food order before me.   The kitchen prepared everything fresh. Nothing are pre made under heated lamps. And the wait is so worth it!  The soup based has the perfect spiciness, the flavour so rich, so intense.. so much flavour! Ok the coconut milk is fattening but it is calories/fat that worth it!   The free drink  is a cold sweetened barley drink. OK, it sounded little weird but trust me it tasted good! Really light and a good compliment to spicy food! And it suppose to be healthy...   And I know it is not lady like to stuff your face in a soup bowl in a busy food court in a popular Chinese mall where you might bump into old flames, but the food makes it all worthwhile!  I can't wait to go back to try other things on the menu.. The Penang Pawn noodles extra spicy looks interesting!!  They accepts Cash only!"}
{"text":"I came here based on reviews but the curry laksa was mediocre and disappointing. Broth was simple curry with no dimension. First time actually trying laksa so I may not have a good rule of thumb. However, it's not as good as other asian curry dishes I've tried. The broth was just missing that depth. The meats are cheap fried tofu, fish paste and bits of chicken. The noodles are just vermicelli. I'm assuming if you want the yellow noodles like the picture, you'll have to ask. The quality and taste isn't there. Although it's cheap, it's not the cheapest in the food court ($7.9 including tax and self serve hot tea)."}
{"text":"Saw someone mention this place from blogTO long time ago.  Finally came and tried their Mamak Nasi goreng with egg. Asked for mild. Decent food court portion.  Fried rice is hot.  Taste good. Want to try their boneless Hainanese chicken rice next time."}
{"text":"I have to disagree with a few Yelpers who said Malay Thai is better than Restoran Malaysia. Although I prefer the latter, Malay Thai would probably be my \"go to place\" for a quick Malaysian fix.  For a tiny corner in a food court, the number of selections are not bad at all. I ordered their nasi lemak and char kuey teow and they were decently good. However, they lack a certain depth of flavor or \"oomph\" factor that I was looking for. Beware that their portions are huge and you will get more than what you paid for.   Will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"The food quality is good for foodcourt standard. We had the curry laska and chili chicken on steamed rice. Both were delicious and under $8 each (with taxes in). Pretty decent price.  I would like to try the pad Thai and basil fried rice next time I am here"}
