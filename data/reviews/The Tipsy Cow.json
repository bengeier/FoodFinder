{"text":"A friend and I stopped here for a late night snack and beer. There were so many options that we were a little overwhelmed at first. We ended up getting the portobello mushroom sandwich. It was extremely savory and the perfect amount of food! I would definitely recommend coming here if you are with a large group full of different taste buds. Seating is available inside and out."}
{"text":"Until recently I thought I had found the best cheese curds in town--now that I've tried Tipsy Cow's, I know I have found them! Decent to above average beer selection and friendly staff make this a great place to check out on The Square."}
{"text":"I am a frequent visitor during lunch time on the weekends. Sometimes after work for a beer and burger. TP has an excellent selection of local and national craft beer. Bartenders have always been knowledgeable and willing to provide samples of beer. The food is exceptional. From burgers, sandwiches, to salads, the food is consistently above average. Tipsy Cow is one of my \"go to\" places to eat on the weekend afternoon after a nice bike ride. Great location off the square."}
{"text":"Cheese curds are a favorite of mine and these rank up there as one of the best. Good food, very creative selections on hand. I also tried the Tipsy Punch specialty drink; wasn't a huge fan of that but wouldn't oppose to trying it again. The bar area was smaller/more cramped than I expected and I didn't go into the actual dining area as there were a few scattered seats at the bar (was there on a Wed night about 7)."}
{"text":"Great food, great prices! The guacamole bacon burger is my default (favorite burger in Madison), but I have friends who swear by the tipsy burger. Some of the best cheese curds and fries in town. Good beer selection too. This is the only review I've ever written, but Tipsy Cow is worth it.  Definitely go and enjoy."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here after work one day to try their truffle fries. We had heard lots of rave reviews and just had to give it a shot. The verdict? Good, but not great. I much prefer the Parmesan truffle cream fries over at DLUX.   That said, the prices were good - we went during happy hour. Service was subpar. The restaurant was pretty empty, but our server spent most of her time reading the paper and chatting with other staff.  I might go back to try other food, but if I'm craving truffle fries, you can find me at DLUX!"}
{"text":"Best burger I have ever had in my life. We were visiting for our business trip and enjoyed their burger with 3 year aged cheese. Not too greasy but just right on the moisture. The cheese melts in your mouth and your just along for the ride. Wish I could have this everyday!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy The Tipsy Cow. Their food is consistently good and they have a good selection of beers. You can't beat their deal on Mondays with half-off wings and half-off fries. The Korean BBQ fries are outstanding!"}
{"text":"The place was very busy but we were seated quickly.  It is in the heart of Madison's theater district so parking was difficult.  I went for the fish fry.  For $10 (refreshing as opposed to $9.99) you get a three piece Spotted Cow battered cod, slaw, battered fries and rye bread (I always prefer marble rye but that's me.).  Also refreshing was that the portion size was very decent and not gut busting.  This place is a definite keeper.  Many raved about the cheese curds and they didn't disappoint.  You must try.  They also had goat cheese curds which I am now dying to try.    The beer selection won't disappoint.  Be sure to check out the chalk board for the specials.  For dessert we had the Pumking (8 1/2% alcohol).  OH my gosh.  I am not a pumpkin pie connoisseur but I wanted a slice while drinking the Pumking.    Service was excellent despite it being crowded and the tables too close together.  Definitely give it a try."}
{"text":"Service was OK. The waitress super nice. The starters and sides phenomenal however the burger was sub par. The restaurant allows families with children however I would not recommend it and smaller parties are probably best. My hubby loved the spotted cow beer, we were from out of town. All in all the place is good stop for lunch."}
{"text":"A fine, no-nonsense spot offering solid pub fare with friendly and efficient service. Not noteworthy in any real sense, but there is nothing wrong with that at all."}
{"text":"this place can't accommodate more than a 3 person party, so don't think you will enjoy trivia night with a group of friends. We had a rude chubby waitress who seemed too stressed out to be a waitress and literally bumped into me to get past me with a word! ick"}
{"text":"Fantastic. Good service. Sitting outside was nice and the setting next to the capitol was amazing. Cheese curds were phenomenal. The burger and the bun were soft and delectable"}
{"text":"One of the places in Madison where one can try locally grown food. Their chicken, either it's in the salad or chicken tenders, is the best I have ever had in USA. The fries are the best in Madison. I think they fry them differently, but I might be wrong. Their pickles tastes like something my Russian grandma would make. For those who did not like them, this is how real pickles with dill should taste like. Would go again and again and again"}
{"text":"My favorite go-to for Madison food! The goat-cheese curds are to die for and the best in the city. They are always fast and allow you to order entrees and sides separately."}
{"text":"Formerly King and Mane, this restaurant (run by the same folk as at Lombardino's) ditched their former Tex-Mex tapas/small plates menu and name and rebranded themselves as The Tipsy Cow with an emphasis on Wisconsin comfort food and craft beer.  The interior has been updated a bit too, and it's hard to miss the Holstein-esque paint job at the front door on the corner.  Their menu is an 8.5 by 11 page with food on one side and drinks on the other.  As I mentioned, the food portion is Wisconsin comfort food.    Appetizers/Sides consist of things like cheese curds, cheese sticks, pretzels, Spotted Cow battered onion rings, all sorts of fries (blue cheese & bacon, truffle, chili cheese, and beer battered).    They have a couple options of soup and salad, and the entrees are all sandwiches of some kind, like burgers, sausages, turkey, grilled cheese, chicken, BLT, with the exception of a Friday fish fry.  There's also a few dessert choices.  The Tipsy Cow's menu puts some emphasis on local and Wisconsin-based ingredients, which I always consider a good thing.  Regardless of where I'm eating, the more local and fresh you can get the ingredients, the better.  The flip side of the menu is devoted to drinks, with craft/micro brews taking center stage.  Lots of locals like Ale Asylum, Lake Louie, New Glarus, Furthermore, Potosi and Oskar Blues, but also a decent selection of other U.S. beers.  There's also macros, imports, mixed drinks and wine.  They seem to have daily tap specials on the beer.  Stopped by around 2pm on a Thursday.  Not very busy at all, so I grabbed a table overlooking King St.  Looked like a decent selection of 6-8 taps, and Lake Louie's Warped Speed was on special for $3.50 a pint.  Wish I could have taken advantage of it.  Since it was kind of dead, service wasn't an issue at all.  I ordered a water, the Kielbasa sandwich, and a small order of the beer battered french fries.    The Kielbasa was Usinger's on a Clasen's sausage roll, with a whole grain mustard and bavarian sauerkraut.  Great synergy between the different flavors and textures, and the roll was a perfect match for the fillings.  As someone who cooks similarly on a regular basis, it was nice to find an alternative if I don't feel like cooking =)  The beer-battered fries' batter was very good as well, and the fries were cooked right on target.  I should have asked if they were using a Spotted Cow batter like they do for their onion rings.  Portions were good too, I still had a bit left on my plate.  Not bad for a $10 meal.  The typical American-sized potions are way too big for me, so this was a nice change from meals where I sometimes leave more than half of it for a to-go box.  With the popularity of the Old Fashioned nearby, I can see this place taking a similar route, as they share many of the same qualities.  We'll see if the service can keep up when it gets busy, but as this is a rebranding and not an entirely new restaurant I would assume that all the staff would need to do would be to adjust to the new menu.  5 stars for quality flavor of food, beer selection, price, and service.  Your mileage may vary on the service aspect though, as it wasn't busy at all when I was there."}
{"text":"I've gone to Tipsy Cow three times now & have always been impressed with the food however not by the waitstaff.  The waitresses I've had have all been attentive at the start of the meal however half away through they seem to disappear.  I waited 20-30 minutes during one visit to pay my bill & I seriously could not find my waitress..... Also the knowledge of the menu from waitstaff is poor.  They have a fun selection of beers but one waitresses could not tell me about a handful of them & instead of saying \"Let me ask the bartender or Would you like a sample because I'm not familiar with that beer\", she repeated \"I really have no idea what that tastes like\" & \"Ya I'm not sure\".   When it's my first visit to a new restaurant I like to hear the opinions from the staff on their favorite dishes & drinks, not lack of interest or knowledge in the menu. I think once the waitstaff here is up to par with the food there won't be much of anything to complain about!"}
{"text":"Service was challenged on a crazy busy Friday night, but they delivered. Highlights:  Friday fish fry was great. Great, flaky fish and texture  and flavor on the fries. Pinto beans and sausage, with the taco plate, were excellent. Richest tomato soup we have had in a long time and the white curds were perfect with it."}
{"text":"Came here late night and they had $6 drafts of Apocalypse Cow. Awesome."}
{"text":"Lord help you if Don is your server. Only table he had, couldn't pull it off.  Food was still good, but service sucked balls."}
{"text":"Our experience with The Tipsy Cow would have been better had my wife and I not felt ill (nauseous) after our meal here. The service was slow; our food took seemingly forever to appear. Our appetizers and salad arrived with our entrees and my drink was forgotten.  Our server did eventually remember the ice tea and brought it out gratis.  Once the food did arrive, it was very tasty. The basket of onion rings we split were awesome and better than any we'd had before.  My wife ordered the grilled cheese with Nueske's bacon and 3yr cheddar. I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich with bacon and 3yr cheddar as well. Both were excellent. The salad with mixed greens was fairly dull and drowned in dressing. No tomatoes or other garnishes were added.  I would not return. Between the slow (though cheery) service, the after-effects of the meal, and the availability of better pub food closer to our home, this is one to move on from."}
{"text":"The cheese curds are some of the best I've had whenever I travel all across Wisconsin. The tipsy burger is also massive and delicious. Fast service too"}
{"text":"One of the great places in Madison where one can try locally grown food. Their chicken, either it's in the salad or chicken tenders, is the best I have ever had in USA. The fries are the best in Madison. I think they fry them differently, but I might be wrong. Their pickles tastes like something my Russian grandma would make. For those who did not like them, this is how real pickles with dill should taste like. Would go again and again and again!"}
{"text":"Love love Truffle Fries!! I can't enough of them. Drinks are great, food is great, friendly servers."}
{"text":"The server double charged my debit card with my ticket and another table's ticket. The server said it wouldn't go through. One week later, 8 different phone calls and even talked to the owner who was going to take care of it - the charge is still on my account. Bad business practice."}
{"text":"This was formerly Buggy's Diner, they opened in January 2016. Same layout and decor but they amped up on TVs as it's now a sports bar. There's also a large projector screen. By the front, there are 2 dart boards.   Coming here for dinner on a Tuesday night, it was quiet with several men having a drink at the bar and one at a booth. We were greeted by a friendly lone waitress.  Menu is the standard appetizers, wings, burgers, sandwiches and pub favourites. They have 3 South Asian curries that adds a twist! We ordered a buffalo chicken appetizer (deep-fried boneless chicken pieces) in honey garlic sauce ($9), and a beef and Guinness pie (beef stew topped with a flaky pastry, $12). The buffalo chicken was alright, can't go wrong with deep-fried breaded chicken pieces, and the cook served it on a bed of potato wedges by mistake :) The beef pie was a little disappointing. A peppery stew with a hint of Guinness and small pieces of beef, it could be better.   I imagine this place will be popular on a game day or to have a drink with a buddy. The light is too dim for me, my eyes were tired at the end of the meal, but it's good for watching the screens.   2.5 stars for the meal and the friendly server."}
{"text":"I love this place. They are always friendly, the cheese curds are the best as well as the chicken tenders.  This is one of my favorite restaurants in Madison."}
{"text":"Tipsy Cow was delish!  I went there with my husband and my parents for my birthday. The food was great the service was excellent.  We got a variety of items on the menu and loved them all. The coslaw that came with the fish was okay though.   I got the lamb burger, no egg add taziki sauce. It was amazing.   My dad got the Tipsy Burger, he said it was an excellent burger. And coming from a burger eater, that says alot.   Fish Fry, my mom and husband got. And they were both super happy about the fish. Not a fan of the coslaw, but it was OK.   Gator Bites, were awesome. Has a great spice to them. One of the better gator bites in Madison.   Onion Rings, large and tasty! The sauce it came with jived well together.   Gyro Fries, were a big hit with us too! Gotta try them.  So many things to try off there menu. Everything we had was great so I'm sure whatever you'll get will be tasty."}
{"text":"Went here a couple weeks ago and really enjoyed it. We had a good lunch at a reasonable price. The beer selection is olid (gotta love gumball head) and the truffle fries/tipsy burger combo is bomb. Unfortunately my second outing was bad. My friend wanted to grab a quick burger and my girlfriend and I figured we would join him for a beer. We got in there from the 90 degree heat outside only to realize it was almost a hundred degrees inside! You are new and its the beginning of summer! Get the a/c workin! We were promptly sat by the hostess and looked over the menu for 5 to 10 mins until we found what we wanted. 5 more mins passed and we watched the same three servers walk by our table maybe six times without looking at us. This is a like 10x10ft room with four tables. It wasn't busy. We decided to wait 5 more mins. The guy server looked at us and smiled, giving us hope. He then continued to pull out his phone and text in the corner. Bye bye. We left and opted for the great dane. Tipsy cow, get your act together. You could be successful with your good food and beer, but aweful service will put you under in this competative town."}
{"text":"I hate doing this....but it was so expensive. We waited for someone to come to the table for 10 min, ordered, & then waited another 25 for our food, on a Tuesday. Drink specials didn't go into effect until 8pm apparently, didn't say anything about it on the menu. I got a chicken sandwich and the bun was toasted, but too toasted, so the bottom was hard and just tasted like burnt toast. The chicken sandwich sounded good but it didn't have any flavor :( it was a normal sized sandwich and my boyfriend's burger was very small. Both cost $8 I believe, and didn't come with anything, which I thought was weird. So we got the $12 spinach & artichoke dip which was alright. My mule was $8 and was about a small 8-10 oz mug. For not so good food and drinks we spent $45. Too much for a joint like this in my eyes."}
{"text":"Great food, but horrible service! Previous to this most recent experience, I had eaten several times at Tipsy Cow. I decided to bring some friends that never experienced the food. The service had been tolerable; however, this time it was a new low. The hostess told us the wait would be 25 minutes and recommend Great Dane as a better place to eat. She was very persistent for the group of six of us to leave. Also, we arrived at 2:30 PM on a Saturday, which was slow during this time. The food is not worth the lack of service. I would recommend a different place to enjoy a meal. Maybe Great Dane as the hostess stated;-)"}
{"text":"In my opinion, some of the best burgers in town. They have a burger with bacon and avocado that I dream about. Also, their truffle fries are very popular and crave worthy for many Madisonians.  The beer selection is on point and the service is attentive but not over bearing. Overall, I prefer this to the old fashioned for burgers and beer. Especially on a Tuesday (2X2 if you know what I mean)"}
{"text":"The cheeseburger I had was juicy and delicious and made from quality ingredients. The cheddar was aged and sooooo good! Homemade pickles. Cheap too - $5, and a side of crispy fries was a buck extra. Service was fast during the busy Saturday night and the staff was really friendly. Great drink specials. Their menu mainly consists of bar food and Wisconsin comfort food, which is fine in my book. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"The best Friday Night Fish Fry I have ever had! Friendly staff and great craft beer selection!"}
{"text":"Everything too greasy. We had Tipsy Burger, \"Portobello\" Mushroom burger (which came as regular mushrooms) and onion rings and all were swimming I'm grease, just not appetising. I also posted a photo of the pool of fat left in the dish even from the mushroom burger."}
{"text":"After sifting through all of the yelp reviews, my partner and I were a little hesitant to try The Tipsy Cow. While the food seemed to be received well, there were quite a few poor service reviews that almost put us off.   We walked in at about 8 PM on a Saturday night, ready for the worst. While it was quite loud and packed, we were expecting that for a Saturday night. Miraculously, the hostess said the wait was only 25 minutes and our table opened up within 15 minutes of putting our name on the list. We had no problem getting the bartender's attention to get a beer while we waited.   The service continued to be spot on as we moved to our table. Our waitress was patient and friendly, even when I had to ask her to repeat herself 3 times because the place was so loud. We went all out with cheese curds, beer battered french fries, mike's pickles, and the Tipsy Burger. We were blown away! Everything was far better than even our highest expectations. The cheese curds were on par with The Old Fashioned's, widely believed to be the best in town. The french fries had a deliciously crispy exterior while maintaining the fluffy potato-y interior. I honestly thought that the \"beer battered\" part wouldn't make a difference but those are some of the best fries ever I've had. The pickles were fresh, crispy, and sweet, a perfect complement to all of the greasy food we were hoovering up.  Now for the Tipsy Burger. My god, that thing was greasy, messy, and everything I could ever want in a burger. You could tell from the first bite that the quality of the beef itself was a step up from most burgers I've had in Madison. The bacon was thick and cooked to the right level of crispiness. The cheese was smooth, melty, and in abundance. Finally, the special sauce added a creamy, zesty flair that really pulled the whole burger together. We also chose to throw on some of our pickles from our appetizer and, wow! The burger as a whole was even tastier than the summation of its parts. I can't wait to dig into my leftovers today!  I would highly recommend The Tipsy Cow to any burger, cheese curd, or french fry enthusiast in Madison. I think it rates up there with the other Madison burger champs such as The Old Fashioned, Cooper's Tavern, Dotty Dumplings, and Brasserie V."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Wednesday.  Did not have to wait for a table.  The dining room was small, very small.  There were also tables in the bar area and outside.  They were out of goat cheese curds BOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  but the regular ones were pretty deelish.  My salad (pineapple, cilantro, nuts, avacado) was fabulous as was my husband's sausage sandwich with coleslaw on it.  Our server was nice.  Paid 44 dollars for 4 lunches plus tip (we all drank water though). I'd go back for sure.   PS.  Brought my baby and they did have a high chair for him."}
{"text":"Fries: some of the best I have ever, ever come across. Burger: juicy and delicious, a little greasy but in kind of a good way. But two gripes - the cheese curds were great but there was a super small portion for the $7 price tag. Second gripe was the \"house salad\". Comes with a \"buttermilk raspberry viniagrette\".The dressing was way too tangy for me but whaddyagonnado; and it didn't have \"stuff\" in it, it was just lettuce.  But I can't wait to go back and try the other sandwiches, they looked amazing. UPDATE - 1/4/12 - since then, I have had the warm mushroom and goat cheese salad which was fabulous, and today I had the most amazing hot ham n cheese ever. The bread was generously buttered and toasted so it was a delicious, crisp, buttery delight, with extremely flavorful aged cheddar cheese, melted in with the very thinly sliced ham - SO GOOD. Paired with a cup of their amazing chili (I consider mine award-winning, but theirs is equally as good, with a completely different flavor) made for an awesome lunch. One suggestion would be to have a cup of chili and half sandwich option - It would make the lunch less pricy and would then be the perfect amount of food for lunch. I mean, I ate all mine, but I certianly didn't NEED all that food. :) Simply lovely."}
{"text":"This place is. The. Worst.  First of all, I walk in and take my seat. Who  has assigned seating anymore? 5 min l8tr I'm told I can't sit there anymore! WTF!?! Then, I take a seat at the bar. Bartender is awful. Slicked back hair, too defined of a part. Someone is elitist. Can't a girl order a whiskey and close out her tab? Is that too much to ask? $10 min? Why the drinks so cheap? Dat whiskey diet doe... Did the trick.  Sincerely,  Basic white b*tches."}
{"text":"This was my first bar I ever went to in Madison and even though there are so many great places, I still keep coming back to here. Though the food is a bit greasy, the staff is excellent (4 of the 5 bartenders I've had have been outright hilarious and lots of fun) and the smell of chocolate chip cookies wafts over the bar area... what's not to like? My boyfriend likes their beer list, I like their wine list, and thus we will keep coming back on quiet Sundays for day drinks and football watching."}
{"text":"Really loved the atmosphere here and they have a great drink selection! The food was great too if you are looking for a good casual dinner.. The truffle fries are soooo good and I would recommend getting those, everything was really good and I would go back for drinks or food again!"}
{"text":"I stop in for lunch occasionally on a week day.   I'm usually in a hurry and the staff serves me quickly and efficiently.    Today I ordered the chili and it was probably the best I have ever eaten.    I'm sure it would be a nicer place for a more leisurely meal or happy hour."}
{"text":"OMG!  This place is awesome!  Mike's pickles and the fried cheese curds are fabulous!  The Tipsy Burger is, without a doubt, the best burger I've ever had.  Truffle fries are to die for!  Even the grilled cheese was spectacular.  My only problem was I couldn't eat enough to satisfy my curiosity.  Would love to try the Spicy Slaw Dog.  A nearby table ordered one, it looked very appetizing, I was stuffed.  Our server, Laura, was very friendly and attentive.  The restaurant was very clean and inviting.  Everything arrived just as quickly as you would expect.  No complaints!  Next time we're in Madison, The Tipsy Cow will definitely be on our list."}
{"text":"We sat out on the patio on a great summer day.   The beer selection is very good with many microbrews that are local and delicious.   I had the signature Tipsy Cow burger, and it was cooked perfectly and was one of the best burgers in Madison that I have tried.  The toppings were fresh and the service was prompt and friendly.  The truffle fries were decent but not extremely special.  I would definitely recommend The Tipsy Cow."}
{"text":"$3 PBR fish tacos were delicious!   Nice twist on the usual fish tacos because the fish is actually beer battered fried fish.  We also ordered a side of onion rings and fries, both were good but put us over the top for grease.  Next time, I'd order a couple of fish tacos, and maybe a salad instead.  Service was good but also a little a slow considering there were only two other tables of customers at the time."}
{"text":"I have loved this place for a long time! Everytime I go I walk away satisfied - that's not easy for me!  They keep the menu fresh and new. This time I ordered the guacamole burger (on toast -instead of the bun). They accommodated me with no problems.  The burger was the best I've had in a very long time. Then I had the goat cheese curds - just amazing! I try to eat here as often as I can and would recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Busy and cozy! We sat by the window, good view! We took alligator bites and cheese curds. Only one bathroom, single person at a time."}
{"text":"Our experience to the Tipsy Cow was reason enough not to go back.  We were seated behind the main door, next to the bar and bathroom.  This shouldn't even be a seat.  Too cramped and  we kept getting bumped into.  The bathroom door doesn't close softly - extremely loud.  Just a really uncomfortable spot removed from the rest of the seats inside and outside.  Our waitress was not kind or polite.  We ordered.  She forgot our order of fries.  When our burgers came she put onions on the burger when I asked for none.  We felt like she wasn't even listening to us or interested in her role at all.  The cheese curds were decent, but the rest of the food was soggy in grease and was not appetizing."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to get a burger in Wisconsin and Illinois. Whenever we come back to visit family we always make sure we eat here."}
{"text":"I wish I could review the food at this place but my two attempts to eat here over one weekend failed miserably.  First time: about 10:30 pm on a Friday night. No hostess to be found so we wandered around until a server stopped to give us a dirty look and ask if we needed something. She took no small pleasure in telling us they only served drinks after 10 pm.Rude! Went to Brocach down the street and had excellent beer and snacks.  Second time: about 6 pm on a Sunday. Closed. Went back to Old Fashioned for cheesy treats.  Menu looked very good, so I'm disappointed I didn't get to try it...oh well, though."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere, we went on a trivia night (yelp starz killed it). Kinda noisy but easy to talk amongst yourselves. We ordered a fruitsman beer, and a oskars saison with alligator bites marky Mark style (that means buffalo sauce for non foodiez). Beer was great with reasonable prices. Alligator bites were overwhelmed by the buffalo sauce so the true taste profile is unknown. Also, the sauce that came with bites may have added relief or more heat to bites. Crowded but easy to navigate bar, super slow service, and not really attentive.   For this food starz has given tipsy cow a solid 3 (not a 3+, or the less desired 3-. Moderate at best)."}
{"text":"This was our first time and it was a busy Friday night. We sat in the bar area which was fine. It was a rainy night so outside was not an option. Food was great, we had wings, sour cream and onion fries, buffalo chicken sandwich and a cheeseburger. My only complaint is that the waitress did not write down our order and we did not get what we ordered. It was corrected but could  of had been avoided. Great beer and food."}
{"text":"Some friends and I came to try out The Tipsy Cow, but I can't comment on it because nobody ever talked to us. We walked in, there was a sign that said, \"Please wait to be seated\". We stood there for about 10 minutes without being helped. It was a little busy, but we would've liked to be acknowledged. We wound up leaving and walking to a different restaurant without any employee saying anything to us. Strange."}
{"text":"We stopped in here for an hour while waiting for our table to open up at Old Fashioned up the street.  I'd have liked another day to come back to eat here too, because the food I saw being served to the bar patrons looked pretty good.  There was a good selection of beers on tap, and my only negative was that I'd have liked their beer selection to be more Wisconsin centric.  That being said, the regular customers are locals, and having some out of state brews is a good idea.  It's definitely the sort of place I like to find myself, and would go back in a heartbeat if I find myself back in Madison."}
{"text":"My BF and I stopped for a drink this evening on our way to another restaurant for dinner.  The bartender could not have been more indifferent.  We won't be going back to eat there no matter how many good food reviews I read."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with my dad and we each ordered a cup of the tomato soup, which was to die for.  It had a little bit of sweetness and smokiness to it and was topped with fresh cheese curds.  We split the 1 x1 made into a tipsy burger.  The cheese on was delicious and the homemade pickles were crisp and sweet, also very good.  We also each ordered a fish taco (thursday special).  It came with hefty piece of fried fish with a chipotle sauce, slaw and pico de gallo.  I will definitely go back for all of it.  The only problem is you leave smelling of grease."}
{"text":"The tipsy burger was one of the best burgers I've ever had. Very good beer selection and my server, \"Claire\" well she was great as well. When I come back through Madison I will definately be stopping back here."}
{"text":"I love the tipsy cow.  The food is consistent.  It is usually less busy than other capital restaurants.  My husband has crowned the tipsy burger his favorite in Madison.  The cheese curds are fabulous. What more could you want?"}
{"text":"Blows the Old Fashioned out of the water.  My office is less than a block away, and I have gained probably 5 pounds from the beer-battered fries alone. Not to mention the PBR-battered fish tacos, the satisfying and well-crafted Tipsy Burger, or any other sumptuous morsel off their menu. Hell-o, weekly specials.  The place is cozy, the bartenders are friendly, and the place is always bustling. It does get very busy very suddenly and wait times tend to be long, what with the no reservation policy. But hey, you've got some nice Wisconsin beers to sip while you wait for the servers to finish hyperventilating in the back."}
{"text":"Fish fry was not good. With such a thick beer batter (which I generally enjoy), you better not overcook the fish. Unfortunately, the fish was left in the fryer too long. This, combined with the fact that the fish itself was below average, resulted in a pretty disappointing meal. Luckily, the fish fry was only $9 (at lunch) which is very reasonable for a good size portion.   I had high hopes for this place. Next time, I'll have to try the burger."}
{"text":"Great food when they have it. They seem to run out of goat cheese curds a lot.  Don't go on trivia night or you won't get good service. They act like you're an inconvenience when you want to eat before trivia starts."}
{"text":"Not always easy to get a table but we'll worth the wait. Everything I've ever eaten has been phenomenal. After having a tipsy cow burger, All other burgers pale in comparison. The beer selection is great too!"}
{"text":"Not a bad option for a bit of bar food! Very busy on a Saturday night, at least until about 9 or so. Nice variety of sandwiches, and a lot of different fry options to try- we enjoyed the sour cream and chive fries quite a bit. Also, the pretzel appetizer beats Coopers Tavern's by a mile."}
{"text":"We had a great time here. It was fun, laid back, and good food. We were seated on the patio and a thunderstorm rolled in but were able to grab seats at the bar. Definitely would go back."}
{"text":"Very flavorful. Good quality food and good service. I can't wait to go back and check out other items on the menu. There was 4 of us and we all had something different. Flavor and quality was how we all described our experience at The Tipsy Cow."}
{"text":"Would've given it four stars except the service is a little iffy. Tipsy burger and the alligator bites were both on point, though the bites were a little small for the price. That burger though. I can't tell if it was cause I was starving and cold but that sure hit the spot. The house made pickles are pretty killer too. No sides come with the burgers just fyi"}
{"text":"I have now found THE #1 BEST CHEESECURDS in Madison - no small feat, given the competition.  Batter is light, cheese is yummy fresh - perfect!   Tipsy Cow also has one of the very best burgers in town.  Eager to return!"}
{"text":"I have never gone to Tipsy and been disappointed, let me just say that. Highlights are as follows:  *Pickles. They come with your basket (BASKET BONUS) or you can get them as an appetizer. If you get them as an app, make sure you have a decent size group with you. Or make sure you really like pickles. If you really like pickles, you'll really really like their pickles. Paragraph on pickles complete.  *Truffle fries. Melt in your goddamn mouth.  *Green goddess dressing. I'd bathe in it if it weren't so humid right now.  *Specials. They circulate through some pretty creative, limited-time items on a fairly regular basis and I usually order off that menu. The last couple of munchies I tried on special were Goat Cheese Curds and a Caprese Sandwich. Both were way good and I actually think those Goat Cheese Curds were better than their regular ones. Make 'em permanent, make me happy."}
{"text":"Their fries are awesome. So many combinations. I recommend going in on mondays to get their fries half off. Also try getting their fries with buffalo and ranch , instead of buffalo and blue cheese. Worth a try!"}
{"text":"I've been a few times now, and I feel like it's time to review.  Good things first: 1) Great beer list  2) Weeknight specials are steals  3) Bacon blue cheese fries 4) Pretty solid commitment to using local products  The not so good: 1) Most tap beers are $6 2) Service ranges from frantic, overbearing, adderall'd frat boy to absent.  (read: I've never had good service here) 3) It gets LOUD  For the most part, Tipsy Cow does an OK job but the service needs some improvement.  All the taps are usually great selections, but $6 is kiiiiiiiiind of ridiculous.  They have a tap of the day (or week or month or something) that's usually $3.50, but it tends to be the least desirable on the list.  The food is nothing to rave about, but it's a step above similar places.  I'll definitely be back - I'm a sucker for 1/2 price wings and fries - but Tipsy Cow still needs a lil' tweaking."}
{"text":"Awesome wings, had the tipsy bbq ones and some regular fries - I lucked out and it was half off of wings and fries night (Monday's) and I paid $12 for 2 beers, wings and French fries - no complaints whatsoever!"}
{"text":"Good food and good fun. I enjoyed their patio seating and incredibly large craft brew selection. The food was also very good. I recommend the fried curds. It can get quite busy but the staff handles that in a pretty timely fashion."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place based off a news article naming the Tipsy Burger as the best burger in Wisconsin.  Hmm, I think the person who wrote the article missed Dotty's.  Anyhow, went here with my husband and son.  Husband and I each had a Tipsy Burger per the article's recommendation and our son had the kid's burger.  We also ordered onion rings and fries.  Burgers were okay, but were swimming in grease.  Onion rings were drowning in batter.  Fries were nondescript.  The biggest issue we had was the service.  The waitress dropped off our food and disappeared for the entirety of the meal.  She didn't check back on us once and we needed drink refills, etc.  We timed it and she didn't come back to our table for 30 minutes after dropping our food off...  After we were finally able to pay our check we found out why the lack of service - all staff were up front watching Badger Basketball."}
{"text":"Tried to \"stop in\" here on a Saturday around 6:30, but should have known it would have a long wait like every other restaurant right around the capital. We out our names in and got a drink elsewhere, as the bar was packed, and were texted to come back in 45 minutes.  We were seated at a bar table next to the window and began to peruse the drinks section. Unfortunately the drafts are only listed on the board behind the bar and I had to rather awkwardly scurry over/get in the waitresses way to look at it. I ended up getting a madtown nutbrown (bottled) and my boyfriend got a crown and Sprite. They were very generous with the spirits!  We started with the pretzels app because we were craving them, and they were as good as pretzels can be for not being house made.  As we continued on to ordering food go dinner we were both struck by the enormity of it. Being on one page and in tiny font, it was hard to focus our eyes on any one thing. With about 6+ kinds of fries, all that sound delicious, it seems as though different menu items could be better grouped. On a side note, sandwiches also do not include a side.  We ended up ordering a grilled cheese, chicken fritters, and sour cream and onion fries to split. Again, everything was yummy but not anything I'll remember forever. The grilled cheese had garlic aioli on it, which I love and discovered recently, but it was overflowing. The boyfriend really enjoyed the sour cream and onion fries, and we took them home to reheat.  Overall, good and unpretentious food. I plan to come back eventually and try out something else, probably on a weeknight."}
{"text":"Yum! Great beer list. Definitely get the cheese curds! Had both the grilled cheese and the gauc bacon grilled cheese. Both were excellent cheese explosions. Worth the visit for sure."}
{"text":"It's good for what it is and they have a couple of vegetarian options. The bread they use for the sandwiches is pretty good. I tried their portabella sandwich and the aioli sauce was perfect for it. They also have a grilled cheese for about $6.50. Part of the chalked in decorative message refer to Monty Python's Holy Grail in combination with cow-related humor in honor to the restaurant's name. They have several beers on tap. Right by Capitol Square and a hop from Colectivo."}
{"text":"This place has the potential of being good but it's a hit and miss place for me.  Last time I ate here my burger tasted and smelled like seafood. Which is not a good thing when you are eating beef.  Keep trying tipsy."}
{"text":"This should not be taken as a definitive review of the Tipsy Cow as I was in for one beer in the middle of a music festival. The Tipsy Cow is about the fifth attempt at a bar in this location with little changing in between. The staff were great on a very busy night. The decor is bar like, nothing spectacular. Lots of beer on tap but I did not have a chance to sample widely. I'd try it again before drawing a final conclusion."}
{"text":"This is a fun place for a bite to eat and some beers.    Food: A nice mixture of pub grub with sandwiches, tacos and appetizers. If you are looking for a full on entree, this isn't the spot. Everything I've had there has been well executed.  Beer: 99% craft beer, fresh, poured in proper glassware and reasonably priced.  Ambiance: Just a fun pub. Not divey but not uppity."}
{"text":"This review is only for the bar. They have a great selection of beers on tap. The spotted cow is a MUST try. Its smooth and light similar to Blue Moon, but without the citrus, similar to pale ale. Service was quick. Crowded at the bar, but eventually you'll get a seat if you scout who's leaving."}
{"text":"Have you ever eaten somewhere and ordered something so good that you re-order it every single time you revisit?? This is my place. And the Tipsy Burger is my 'usual'. I might as well tell the waitstaff that I don't need a menu! When you find something this good, what's the point in even being tempted by anything else? I think it's the local beef from Knoche's that makes it. My sister swears it's the brick cheese. Whatever it is, I've sworn my love and allegiance to this burger for all eternity.  Since the burgers are served a la carte, I have branched out and tried some of the different sides. Onion rings are good. Buffalo bleu cheese fries are GREAT! Also, although small, the tap beer selection here is pretty stellar. They usually have one or two things on tap that you'd be hard-pressed to find anywhere else."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong eating at the Tipsy Cow, we had the Friday night Fish Fry. While most of their menu items have sides separate this dish does come with sides. Had we realized that it is likely we would not have ordered a side of fries. Great beer selection, friendly waitstaff - I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"It was nice & good, but I wasn't blown away. Everyone liked what they ordered. The cheeseburger was very good. I'd go back, but it wouldn't be on the top of my list."}
{"text":"My favorite burger in Madison. Tipsy cow is a restaurant on the square with both a seating area and bar. The service is timely and courteous, drinks are high quality and of wide variety,  and food is definitiely better than those around the square.   A couple of highlights to emphasize here. One is obviously the tipsy burger, it has been recognized at the national level as one of the best cheeseburgers in the United States. The other is the truffle fries, which have an addicting/cant put it down flavor. Finally the cheese curds, ask for them to be tossed in buffalo sauce.   There are nightly specials on the menu, where you can get a popular food item at discount and a speciality menu for those who dont like monotony in their food options. Also a trivia night.    I always leave feeling like Tipsy Cow hit the spot."}
{"text":"We dashed over to Tipsy Cow after the Badger game, because we didn't want to wait an hour for a table at Old Fashioned. We got a table right away, and the service was in point! It's not 4/5 in terms of all restaurants ever, but it's 4/5 for being quick, fancy bar food.   My friends from Chicago and New York insist that the prices are super reasonable for the quality. My veg friend got an asparagus-egg sandwich and was really impressed! I ordered a small gyro fry, and it was a generous portion. The gyro was a little skimpy, but you'll enjoy it if you want a salty side.   We all agreed that the curds were to die. On par with Old Fashioned. If you're planning a curd crawl soon, put this place on the list."}
{"text":"Went here for trivia night on a Monday.  It was surprisingly busy and we had to wait a good 30 minutes for a table for 7.  We sat at the bar while we waited and the bartender indulged us by letting us sample some beers before making a decision.  When we were finally seated, our waitress was quick to take our orders.  I got the carnitas fries (on Mondays, all fries are $5!!) and devoured as much as I good as quickly as I could.  They were very tasty, but I would prefer the meat to be in smaller chunks and more pico/queso/other toppings.  I tried my friends truffle fries and while they do have a distinct taste to them, but I thought they were good. I also wish they listed beer prices.  I inadvertently ordered a $7 beer and I wouldn't have ordered it if I had known how much it was. It was hard to hear the trivia guy at times.  Most people in the dining area were there for trivia and would quiet down, but the tables that weren't continued chatting (as was their right) and the mic wasn't loud enough to carry over their conversations at times. I'd be back again; I've had their PBR fish tacos and they are to DIE for!"}
{"text":"Best place I visited in Madison, hands down, and I went to a lot of places. Unpretentious, fun, casual local bar with intriguing microbrew choices on tap. Bonus points for cute cow decor!"}
{"text":"The service was fast and friendly and the food was typical madison pub food: Burgers and fried things.  Since I wasnt in a burger mood I got the chicken tenders and they were surprisingly flavorful and juicy.  Other than that the Tipsy Cow is nothing to really gawk over."}
{"text":"This was a bit of a hole in the wall but was a nice surprise.  After a long day of training, I wanted something quick and easy, this was perfect.  The truffle fries were great. Rich, like you expect from truffle oil. The pickles, yummy. The tomato soup was spicey and sort of smokey at the same time. My friend had the goat cheese curds and they were an excellent surprise.  Also, my friends each had the kielbasa which was the special for 1/2 off. This was a huge amount of food for under ten dollars. A great discovery, I highly recommend.  Oh, and a great beer selection with samples from the tap. Get the truffle fries!"}
{"text":"Farm to Table High End Well Lit Dive  So my wife and I are trying to squeeze in as much as we can during our 6 day stay. We walk by the Tipsy Cow and stop. After a brief discussion. we go in. Nothing really fancy to this joint and I would considering it a high end dive. We sit at the bar and get a couple of drinks. We look at the menu and my wife zooms in on the Blue Cheese and Bacon fries. We order that. As a continue to read the menu it becomes clear of the Farm to Table vibe this place has. From the special bacon, to ham to cheese this theme runs true here. I love that concept and we really don't have a lot that in a South Florida.   The Food  The fries come and they are pretty good, but nothing special. I then order the Ham and cheese sandwich and my wife gets the Kabasa which comes in a roll.  All the entrees do NOT come with sides, that's where the high end dive comes into play. Everything is ala carte. Our food comes out and it's looks damn good, I know what you are thinking, WTF is a hot ham and cheese sandwich. Dude this was some good eats. Some pickle slices came on the side and I decided to add them on my sandwich. Great move. The pickles, which the bartender said was homemade, had a sweet bite to them which added a great contrast to the melted sharp cheddar. mustard, and ham.  I had a bite of the kabasa and it had a good snap to it. I wish my wife got the Sauerkraut on it because it would have been a prefect couple.   Ambiance  Looks like a working persons pub. Watching the employees walk up and down a flight of stairs to go to and from the kitchen made me think of a working persons pub. Good solid menu and a decent beer selection makes this place hum. Our bartender was very nice as I pestered him to turn up the jukebox. Jukebox junkie here:)   Verdict   Not to shabby. If I have time I'd love to come back and try the burgers.  No reason to tell them I sent you since I'm visiting your town so Stay Hungry!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and great service. The carnitas fries are a must. Definitely worth the long drive."}
{"text":"MLK Day, 2018. Despite the fact that there were already three inches of snow on the ground and more snow was steadily falling, my friend and I were determined to go to happy hour after work. So we took an Uber to Tavernakaya, which had a happy hour we had previously really enjoyed. After a near hazardous Uber ride in snowy conditions, we got out of the car and trudged through thick snow on the sidewalk, eager to warm ourselves up with some sake and pork buns. To our utter dismay, Tavernakaya was closed. Our fault for not checking before since it was a holiday but we were still distraught.   \"There's a bar,\" I said, pointing straight to the Tipsy Cow. I'd been there once before for fries and beer and liked it enough that I started trudging toward it right away. My co-worker and I settled in at the bar and both ordered a bourbon peach mule. It was happy hour so specialty cocktails were $2 off, beer was $1 off, and wine was $5 a glass. We were safe. We had made it. The bourbon peach mule was delicious -- the peach adding just the right note of freshness and the bourbon was strong enough that you could taste but not so strong that it overpowered the delicate peach and ginger beer flavors. It was, in short, just what we needed on a Monday where it seemed nothing was going our way. We were a bit hungry so we decided to order some wings and fries - both half off during happy hour, making an order of 6 wings only $3 and a large order of fries only $2. I ordered the honey harissa wings and my coworker had the parmesan peppercorn. Both were great -- lots of meat, my wings had a smokey yet sweet flavor, and the parmesan peppercorn ones were crispy and flavorful. The fries were crunchy, and the cheese sauce that accompanied them was dairy perfection. Our bartender was friendly and attentive, serving us waters before we asked, refilling waters before we asked, and being prompt with splitting checks and making change.   Thank God we live in Madison, home of so many bars that even if one is closed, there's another one right down the street. And thank God for the Tipsy Cow for strong drinks, good wings, and a cozy bar to hole up in during a snow storm."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner last night and we were pretty impressed. So many items off their menu sound so delicious but there's no way we could order and eat all of them at once without being wheeled out in a wagon. We started out with some cheese curds. Our waitress was nice enough to let us do a half order of the original cheese curds and half of the goat cheese. I would totally skip the original all-together. Not that I don't love cheddar/mozz blend but the goat cheese ones are packed with SO much flavor. It would be a missed opportunity. We also ordered the gyro fries and burgers. The Gyro fries are so filling and its all my \"drunk food\" dreams come true. The burger I ordered was one of their specials, it was the goat cheese & 3 year cheddar burger (yes more goat cheese). I will say even though it was good, I was expecting the burger to be thicker (more meat pleeeease). Over all though, I'm excited to return for more apps and sammys."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times now and never been disappointed. It's hard for me to stay away from burgers, and the \"Tipsy Burger\" was fantastic, as are their cheese curds.  They have good nightly drink specials, especially for Fridays ($2.50 shots of Jameson and $3 Ale Asylum pints? Come on!)  The ambiance is good, the wait staff is above average, and the layout of the bar/restaurant is fun.   Overall, I definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"The Tipsy Cow was my first downtown dining experience when I moved to Madison. I was looking forward to fun local meal. I must say that it was a bit of a let down. The Cheese Curds were amazing, and I would definitely recommend them. However, my meal, a lime chicken sandwich was not very good at all. I'm willing to try it again, because it is a fun place - I'd definitely just want to try something different on the menu.  On a side note, I had an amazing waitress! Her name was Jill and she was the most delightful person I've met in a long time. She worked very hard to help my Mom pick out a local beer that she would like, and was overall super friendly and attentive. If you go there, definitely sit in her section!"}
{"text":"I feel like The Tipsy Cow is the forgotten family member to The Old Fashioned.   They have phenomenal food- the cheese curds and fried pickles are a must every time I go. The beer selection isn't as lengthy as you'd expect, but the options are nothing short of delectable. The Tipsy Cow is a pretty representation of a Wisconsin bar scene.  I've ordered a hamburger from here and was surprised it didn't come with fries (that's where the curds and pickles come into play). Prices are a bit higher than you'd expect, but the quality outdoes itself. Being a New Yorker, I'd say overall fair.  They don't have many specials from what I've seen, but they do have a happy hour."}
{"text":"Great bar!!  Best cheese curds in the state!!! I'm a fried cheese curd connoisseur and I'm calling it like I see it."}
{"text":"This place told us we had a 45 minute wait, but then promptly ran after us when we left the restaurant telling us we had a spot. Nice surprise, but don't know what would've happened.  Cheese curds are alright. I got the fish (cod) and it was only alright. Pretty greasy and I picked it apart. Comes with a side of slaw and fries.   Service was good! Food was okay. Definitely going to try other things if I come again.  Can be relatively loud/obnoxious because of the bar."}
{"text":"stopped by in madison on my way back to chicago from baraboo. 1st time went to tipsy cow. I ordered buffalo chicken burger, it was okay, nothing so special. the price is pretty reasonable. i gave 3 stars because the serving was pretty slow, we had to ask for water everytime, i think they were under-staff. That was pretty annoying for me."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in Madison for casual dining. Living within walking distance of the Capitol for many years, dinner at tipsy followed by a cigar at Maduros is pretty much my happy place.   The burger has made Madison Magazine's best burger list I believe, and for good reason. The chicken sandwich is also outstanding. Their wings are sneaky among the best in Madison (accompanying bleu cheese dressing is awesome). For any of you that dig goat cheese (who doesn't?), they have goat cheese curds. Get them.   If you haven't yet been, go here for lunch or dinner sometime. You will not regret it."}
{"text":"Stopped by The Tipsy Cow when we were told The Old Fashioned would be an hour wait. We were not disappointed. Had the Mediterranean sandwich and side salad. Both were fantastic. The sandwich had a very tasty pesto and the vegetables were cooked perfectly. It was topped off with the creamiest goat cheese...delicious. Salad was fresh, fresh , fresh and their house dressing was lite and creamy. My daughter and husband shared a basket of fries and there were plenty for me to steal one or two without them feeling like they were being cheated. My daughter had the chicken wings while my husband had the BLT. He indicated the thick cut bacon was cooked perfectly. Total bill was around $40."}
{"text":"My girls and i wanted to eat like drunk man so we made a reservation for this place for happy food, ex; fried food... We each order 2 appetizers and beer, you should of see our face when all the food arrived, i mean we started eating with our hand and everything.  Now going back to the review, the place is pretty chill, nice music, the food was delicious and the service was fast. The waitress was very kind and quick. The food was so good I forgot to take picture, if you go definitely order the cheese curds, the onion rings and the wings."}
{"text":"Tipsy Cow is bomb. Super friendly, attentive wait staff, DELICIOUS food across the board and very reasonable prices. I came here with a large group and everything we ordered was amazing. The cheese curds are a must. We also really enjoyed the truffle fries, Tipsy Chicken Salad (love radishes!) the portabello sandwich and of course, the Captial Brewery beers. Thanks for an absolutely wonderful meal. Tipsy Cow is reason enough to come to Madison. Take a lovely walk around the capitol building after dinner to burn off some calories."}
{"text":"My husband and I recently visited Madison from KCMO and this bar/restaurant was recommended as a good place to meet up for dinner and drinks with friends. We went in at 4:30pm on a Tuesday to see if they would be able to accommodate 6 or so people at 5:30pm. They said they don't take reservations but would see what they could do, and they did set aside a table for us. I really appreciated their accomodating us. I ordered the grilled ham and cheese. It was really thick with ham, and really greasy. There was a unique flavor I couldn't identify and the server told me it was a gourmet mustard. It was smoky/bitter. We had also ordered fried cheese curds for the table, and they are also pretty greasy (I guess what should you expect from \"fried\", right?) Husband had the fish tacos and they were delicious. I enjoyed my first taste of Spotted Cow beer. I would recommend the Tipsy Cow as a go to place for anyone visiting Madison."}
{"text":"while in town for a conference, we were wandering around state street and the Capitol for our last night in Madison. my buddies and i have some interesting culinary allegiances: i'm an omnivore who was desperate for some vegetables at the end of an indulgent (cheese-curd-overdose) trip, my friend is la staunch carnivore who strictly does not eat any vegetables or healthy foods whatsoever, and our other buddy is a vegetarian.   we walked into this place because we couldn't resist its name, and we ended up being so happy that we did. among the three of us, we ordered the spring green salad (a special), the asparagus and egg open-faced sandwich, a side green salad, the tipsy chicken sandwich (crispy), and the tipsy burger. all of us were incredibly satisfied with our meals; the food was excellent and spoke exactly to each of our specific needs. we particularly liked how you can get half-orders of the apps or the salads, since the sandwiches don't come with sides.   the best part of the meal, however, was our amazing waitress, Katherine. she was incredibly friendly, attentive, and made us feel like she was genuinely happy to make sure we had a positive experience. towards the end of our meal, two other buddies showed up and wanted to join us; when they found an outside table and we thought we'd have to cash out and start a new tab, she just let us migrate out to the patio and continued to serve us. she really was a gem and made sure our last night in Madison was a great one.  wish we could be back to frequent this place, and over-tip Katherine!!!, all the time."}
{"text":"So rating this place on the food and overall atmosphere, not just our experience because our table was horrible right next to the hostess stand and people were all up in our personal space by the bar, stairs, and hostess. The food was really good! We had a few appetizers, cheese curds were amazing, probably the best yet in Madison. We had the special kielbasa corn dogs with Cajun sauce which were amazing, way over priced @ $8 for 5 small pieces, but tasty! Finally we had an half order of fried zucchini which was petty good. For meals I got the tipsy burger with fried onions which was great, and my wife got a ham and cheese sandwich special called the he jimmy I think. Overall great food but avoid the table right behind the hostess stand, almost made me snap on some people and i am a very easy going guy."}
{"text":"Average Wisconsin bar food.  If you're looking for a good micro-brew selection and greasy eats, it's a good bet.  The hour wait was not quite worth it, but I'd go back..."}
{"text":"Nice selection of tap beers and the fries with truffle oil and a dipping sauce were awesome. Other menu items looked great, but we had another destination in mind for dinner.  Would go again next time I am around the capital."}
{"text":"We stopped in on a Friday night about 8pm, were told it would be about an hour wait.  Ended up being only about 20 minutes.  Ordered the BLT and the cod fish fry.  Food arrived very quickly and was a great meal.  Would definitely stop in again when in the area.  Enjoyed the intimate atmosphere in the dining area."}
{"text":"Great food and fast friendly service.  Would go there again the next time I'm in town.  Only went because of the good reviews on here and is worth the time and money. Parking can be a challenge but there is a parking ramp near by that we used."}
{"text":"I've been to Tipsy Cow a few times, but it had been a while since I've been there last.  So this weekend when it was suggested for some post-brunch drinks, I said, \"why not?\"  Their beer list is fairly extensive and varied.  I like that it is Wisconsin beer driven.  What could go wrong?   The bartender.  I don't know if the guy was new or just clueless, but I do know that he was awful and mopey.  His tap list, which is written on a chalk board, was grossly out of date.  He stated two beers were no longer available.  Upon inspection over half of the board was wrong.  He also poured what seemed to be 1/2 a keg down the drain while trying to pour my pint.  Adding to my ire, after my friend asked a legitimate question about a beer he proceeded to mansplain to her what an IPA was.  Not cool bartender, not cool. So why do I give Tipsy 3 stars?  Well, after his shift ended the new bartender was much much better.  He explained that they were switching from winter to spring menu so that is why some things were out of date.  Noticed that the tap list was wrong, but knew exactly what he had in stock.  He was much more lighthearted and knew how to pour a beer.  Needless to say we stuck around for one more drink instead of slinking out as we were again having fun.  This experience just goes to show that good hires can make or break a place.  I will be giving this place another chance, just not with bartender #1."}
{"text":"Every time I've been to the tipsy cow I've enjoyed it, and I've been there... roughly 8-10 times. Why I keep going back: The food!!!!!  I initially went for it's decently priced fish fry which I think is the best in town, perhaps some of the best I've EVER had, and I've had many a fish fry over the years. Also... their curds are... oh.my. GOD. soooo good.   The truffle fries are unique and also good but I do somewhat feel like I gain a food baby after eating them - definitely a great thing to share!  The service is somewhat hit-or-miss, but it's never been terrible. It's always a place I suggest, oh and if you do go to the fish fry, prepare to wait awhile. but its worth it."}
{"text":"Okay concept, poorly executed.  Visited on a Thursday night around 8 p.m. My biggest grief with this place is that they served me a warm beer. A warm beer! When I called the waitress out on it, she said, \"Well I don't know how that could have happened.\" She was nice enough to replace it at no cost but seriously.   The table next to us was full of tourists who all ordered Spotted Cows and the waitress said they were out. Really? You're a pub in downtown Madison called the Tipsy Cow and you're out of Madison's favorite beer?   My fiance liked his burger, I ordered a BLT which I figured would be hard to mess up. It wasn't spectacular. We also ordered the truffle fries, which were good, but it doesn't take a genius to serve French fries covered in truffle oil with a side of garlic aoli. Of course it's going to be good.  I expected a lot more out of the place and was disappointed. It will be awhile before we give it another try."}
{"text":"So very sad to say that after living in Madison for more than a few years that this was my first visit to The Tipsy Cow. I came here with my mom at about 1 PM on a Saturday and we were seated right away. I ordered a Bloody Mary which was really strong (in a good way) and I also appreciated that they asked me which vodka I would like in the drink. You don't always get that.   We had just left Fromagination and were already almost full so we decided to go with a few appetizers. We had the zucchini chips which came out piping hot and very crispy on the outside. I was seriously astonished that the zucchini stayed hot the entire time it was sitting at our table. We also got a special they had that day which was smoked salmon on top of 3 potato pancakes and topped with sour cream and chives. It was so freakin good. I will definitely be back to try some more of the food, and maybe some Monday night trivia!"}
{"text":"Some of the best bar food in Madison. If you're looking for a place for drinks on a Friday or Saturday night , as well as some bar food, this is the place I would recommend you go. There are cheese curds are some of the best in Madison and the staff is very friendly!"}
{"text":"Bartender on verge of being rude.  Very crowded.  Good beer selection and cozy environment but am not dying to go back."}
{"text":"Yum! Service was phenomenal.   We got the salmon grilled cheese special, which was delicious.   They didn't have the portobello sandwich, but we'll come back later to try that. I got the roasted veggie salad instead, which was much nicer than most places.   Overall, really yummy! Sandwiches were slightly greasy, but it was nice!"}
{"text":"Not a lot of vegetarian options, and the service is pretty awkward, but the truffle fries are so worth it."}
{"text":"Been here several times now, food and service always great, and the selection of beers always interesting. A short walk from the Madison Concourse Hotel and a visit. Try the chili, i has a nice kick."}
{"text":"First impression was horrible. Sat down and had others sat after our party served with drinks and food before our order was even taken."}
{"text":"Four of us ate a late lunch at the Tipsy Cow after reading Yelp reviews, very disappointed.  Maybe you need to order specific food items but I cannot recommend eating here with so many other options in Madison.  We ordered the BBQ fries, BBQ sandwich, fish&chips, lamb burger.  I couldn't even eat the coleslaw that came with the fish chips, either it was spoiled or just old.   Everything we ordered was around $10 which I don't consider cheap for lunch but it's across the street from the capital so that must drive up prices.   If your looking for a beer this might be a good spot but for food there are other alternatives to check out."}
{"text":"Tipsy never disappoints. Good to great service.  Very friendly.  Excellent food - especially the burgers. (Harissa-feta, lamb)  And they allow dogs outside.    Thanks Tipsy."}
{"text":"Addicted to their apps! (Appdicted!?!?)  I love munching on their alligator bites and truffle fries *drool*...and the best part is that you can do full or half orders to mix and match. Their outside seating is the perfect chill spot to grab a drink with friends and enjoy the limited nice days in WI."}
{"text":"Great food! I loved the fried cheese curds and the wings! Everything was so delicious they also had a large selection of great beer. Would for sure go back."}
{"text":"Had a great experience there on a Saturday night. After putting our names on the wait list, my party of three walked up to the bar intending to get our drinks and stand. I don't know if it was just good karma, but the three seats that we were standing behind opened up before we had even ordered our drinks. After being told \"cash or tab only\" by the bartender we readily opened tabs, only to have the bartender immediately close them and bring the checks. That turned out okay though. We were quoted an hour, but hadn't finished our first drinks before we were texted that our table was ready.  We were led to a table in the bar just feet away from where we had been sitting previously. Our waiter was friendly, but didn't tell us his name. I ordered the Carnitas Fries appetizer for my meal and enjoyed it immensely. The pork was delicious and the spice level was just perfect. We did have to wait a bit for our waiter to come around with the checks, but I think we may have been the only table ordering food in the bar."}
{"text":"My family came here for dinner on a Thursday night.  Was a little surprised when we arrived about 6:30pm, not many people were in the place. It's a small place, so I thought that it would fill up quickly.  All I have to say is PBR battered  FISH TACOS!  They are AMAZING, it's one of their specials for Thursday night - you won't be disappointed. We also ordered several appetizers Goat Cheese Curds aka best thing you could ever fry, the alligator bites (meh),and  blue cheese and bacon fries (yummy!). My brother in law ordered the Tipsy burger, said that it was good but felt that the burgers from the Old Fashioned or Dotty's are better. Will definitely dine here again."}
{"text":"Came here for the wing special on Monday! Super good deal, half off of their normal wing price, so $6 for 12 or $12 for 24.  I went for the honey Harissa and the Parmesan peppercorn, two of my favorites. The honey harissa is super flavorful with a little bit of a kick, and I like to have a dry rub to mix things up.  Definitely fun to do this once every couple of weeks, can't wait to try out their other menu items as well! Oh, they also have trivia on Monday's it looks like. I ordered for take out but it seemed pretty packed"}
{"text":"If I could put my review in a single sentence, I would have to say Tipsy Cow is good, but with reservations. Even at 1 pm in the middle of the week, TC was hopping. There is a strong smell of truffle oil in the air, so if you are not crazy about the pungent smell of truffle oil, you best avoid this place. Since I love truffle oil and use it in my own cooking, I was not put off by this. Most of the crowd at that time of day were co-workers having a late lunch out.  Tipsy has a bunch of daily specials that don't appear on the regular menu. I was intrigued by the chicken sandwich marinated in Moroccan spices. The sandwich was great, but it was very messy to eat with two hands. I must have run through about five napkins to wipe the sauce off my fingers. in hindsight, I should have given up and handled it with a knife and fork. Going back to the office lunch out folks, if the sandwich is that messy and sloppy , do you really want to eat it in front of your supervisor?  I didn't miss out on ordering a half order of truffle fries, which came with a mild mayo dipping sauce. Good thing I only ordered the half, as it was more than enough and I ended up taking most of my fries home with me.  Tipsy Cow has a great tap beer menu sketched out on the chalk board in each of the 'rooms' that make up the restaurant. Again, this is a place where you go with your office or get a beer or two at the bar by yourself.  One thing: If your good friends have told you or you yourself have discovered that you have a voice that can really carry in a small space, you may wish to tone it down, least you talk about something personal where every single word can be heard two or three tables away. Tipsy Cow was by no means quiet on the day I was there, but one person unwittingly made sure that everyone could hear every bit of her side of the conversation she was having.  The only door for entering and exiting is where the smokers like to congregate for a smoke and a chat. If you are sensitive to smoke, you might want to keep that in mind."}
{"text":"Tipsy cow has a chill city patio, nice staff and a solid vibe, however, the food was far less than impressive. Cheese curds were solid if you need a safe bet. For the main entree I went for the signature tipsy burger. I understand burgers are supposed to be hearty, but it was over the top greasy. Ended up to being a major gut bomb. My partner got the tequila chicken sandwich and the chicken was rubbery, an apparent clue that the meat being far from fresh. I ordered a simple drink and it was not on par. When something has two ingredients, it should be simple and balanced. I'd say Tipsy Cow is a great place to catch a good craft beer and chill out on the patio, and would limit it to that."}
{"text":"So the chalkboard in front of the tipsy cow said all New Glarus beer products three dollars. So I bought two spotted cows and the bill came to nine dollars. I said to the bartender hey what's up. He said those prices go into effect after 8 PM. But nowhere did it say that on the chalkboard. Talk about misleading.   Food was average..."}
{"text":"Went back a second time...much better.  I also went back when it wasn't so busy (Saturday ~11:30).  I got the Grilled Chicken Sandwich.  It was cooked just right and the Zucchini Chips were really good (nice breading and crispy - tasty dipping sauce)."}
{"text":"6/26/13 Stopped at the Tipsy Cow.  They always have a great tap beer selection.  It was 2 for 1 burgers.  I don't typically eat 2 burgers, but they were that good!  If you want fries you'll have to add them.  I enjoyed a nitro pour of the Left Hand Milk Stout."}
{"text":"A pretty good selection of beer, and I really like the atmosphere of this place. Clean, simple, and comfortable. I'm a huge fan of the outdoor patio on summer nights. The Tipsy Cow seems to specialize in classic American food; burgers, fries, beer and the like. It's not too bad for a drink on the weekend, but isn't worth your time if you can't get a table.   Above all else, come here for a burger. The thing that truly makes the Tipsy Burger stand out is the use of a Wisconsin 3-year cheddar in place of a standard slice of cheese. The sharpness is unmistakable. Coupled with a pretty excellent hunk of soft and juicy kobe-esque ground beef, this makes for one of the better and more memorable burgers that I have ever had. The special sauce certainly isn't bad either."}
{"text":"First time here, the food is really good. Busy with holiday shopping all evening, wanted a quick meal but not fast food. I love the aligator bites and you can never go wrong with the cheese curds. The burger was a lil on the greasy side but it was still delish. Was seated and served very quickly. Will definitely come again."}
{"text":"We tried The Tipsy Cow for lunch. It's a small place and the tables are pretty tightly put together. My knees were constantly hitting the chair near me and it was tight getting in and out. It's also very crowded. There was a line most of the time we were there.  The other slightly downside was that while I was at first impressed with the prices or the burgers and sandwiches, I was much less impressed when I realized that didn't include fries or chips. However, I was impressed with their appetizer and sides offerings.  I ended up ordering the Tipsy Burger and the cheese curds and I was very pleased. The burger is messy but delicious with two patties, bacon, and a \"tipsy\" sauce. I devoured it. The cheese curds were light and crispy tempura batter with gooey cheesy insides. Some of the best cheese curds I've had.   I'm looking forward to going back and trying more!"}
{"text":"I chose the Tips for my birthday dinner. They have the best buffalo chicken sandwich in all of Madison. We had 7 people - got there at about 630 Saturday night. They told us 90 min but it was more like 60. But they took our # and we went down the street for a drink. I really liked that system. The hostess was very nice and had cool blue hair. Zucchini, French fry, and cheese curd apps were fantastic. I don't get excited over your average fried curds but there's are special. And the sandwich.... ugh I love that sandwich. I'd love to have a pretzel bun for an option. Nice tap list too, but no nitros. Our server was fantastic and even said someone dropped off like 30 cupcakes. She offered some to us and we had two. She remembered everybody's drinks from the first round - she was very impressive. It was a great time and I'll keep coming back for more! The only negatives are no nitros and the bathrooms are small and tend to have lines."}
{"text":"Very fitting name, as I've only ever been here tipsy.  It's right by the Capitol, so you know you're in a prime people-watching location. There's also a good chance that some kind of concert is happening right on King Street, so make sure to stop here and get your drink on before some tunes.  They have decent prices, a nice selection of beer (keep in mind my \"nice\" is different from everyone else's) and quick service.   I think I might make this my go-to get tipsy spot.   PS: I'm not an alcoholic; I just have a low tolerance for sobriety."}
{"text":"Went here when my girlfriend from Tucson came to visit. It was really good! We ate all of our food in 10 minutes (big portions, but it was so delicious!).  Best part: after all of our enjoyment, the check was not expensive at all! Definitely going back again and again!"}
{"text":"I stopped in with a friend on Friday afternoon. The place has a nice atmosphere, but was a bit loud as the dining area was full.  A window view provided some people and surroundings viewing.   I had that Truffled Portabella Mushroom sandwich. It was very good. The bread was fried in butter which added flavor, but didn't take away from the mushrooms themselves. They have quiet the beer selection, of which I availed myself.   Overall a nice downtown dining experience."}
{"text":"Exactly what I expected from the name: a fun college town bar/restaurant. Friendly staff, good music, and good food. Unlike other establishments of this type, this place feels really clean with no musty holdovers of late drunken nights."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar, super-friendly bartenders.  Huge selection of beers and cocktails.  Food was amazing!  My recommendation is the tipsy burger.  Huge, fulfilling, delicious tipsy sauce and ooey-gooey!  French fries were crisp and delicious!  Tons of seating and the place was packed...no secret how great this place is!"}
{"text":"Nice mellow atmosphere, laid back decor, and of course the chalk drawings from Monty Python and the Holy Grail.   Food is awesome (recommend the blue cheese and bacon fries) and haven't had a bad thing yet.   Good beer and food selection."}
{"text":"We came in with a Birthday Party.  Patrick, the Bartender couldn't be more rude.  Doubtful we'll go back.  Too bad such a great property couldn't offer more."}
{"text":"I had lunch here with my husband.  I'm a big fan on the re-branding.  Unlike another yelper, I LOVE the name.  But more importantly, great burger!  I got their simple cheeseburger - you can choose 1x1 up to 4x4, meaning the number of 1/4 lb patties and slices of cheese. I got 1x1 and especially loved the cheese - a nice aged cheddar.  Husband got the day's special - guac, bacon, pepper jack and jalapenos, and he loved his too.  We also split a basket of beer battered fries because they were half off.  Normally they'd be $8 which is a lot for fries, but they are a huge portion - so $4 for that many fries seemed like a fine deal.  They were a great texture, perfectly cooked. Next time I'll try the truffle/garcli aioli fries though.  And lastly, great service! Plenty of water refills, timely service and just the right amount of attention.  And with fans and high ceilings, the climate was comfortable - so apparently they fixed whatever temperature problems was happening earlier in the summer."}
{"text":"Stopped by this past Monday to get an order of the carnita fries, yet again, and they were even more amazing than last time. The pork carnitas were so juicy and tender. They reminded me of pork carnitas from authentic mexican restaurants back home in Chicago. Tipsy is definitely doing something right!"}
{"text":"Fun spot in Madison! Great location, good specials (even on a Saturday night!), friendly staff, and GOAT cheese curds!!! Get them. You're welcome."}
{"text":"The Tipsy Cow is all and more that a Wisconsin-influenced Madison bar can be.  They make sure that all the staples of a Wisconsin bar are at par excellence.  The place has limited seating, but does have a fairly large bar.  As with all great institutions, it is generally quite busy.  But I assure you that the wait is worth it.     When I last went I had the pleasure of eating the Tipsy Burger.  It has to be the best burger I've had in the midwest.  The tipsy sauce and the cheeses pair together so well with the light grease on the burger and onions.  The cheese curds are also some of my favorite in Madison.  They definitely make the top three out of all the cheese curds I've had in Madison (well over 15 variations of curds).  The fish fry is also one of the best, having won best fish fry in Wisconsin before.  The fish is of some of the highest quality, and the breading is second to few.    The bar has quite a few beers on tap, it's no hopcat, but the food is actually good here.  The bartenders seem to be very knowledgeable, and the brandy old-fashioned sweets hit the nail on the head.  The bartenders and servers were altogether hospitable and ready to please.    Overall you cannot go wrong with The Tipsy Cow.  It's a Madison institution that does everything to perfection."}
{"text":"Something different!  The menu is not large but is creative.  Many of the items are fresh and in season, with a focus on traditional items made with local, artisan products. This means GOOD Wisconsin cheese, tasty Wisco meats and fresh local veggies.  I have had the truffle fries, the grilled cheese, the cheeseburger and a special sandwich that had a kimchi-esque veggie topping.  The servers is decent, casual and not pushy.  The space is cute, open with lots of windows. Great location right on the square. The bar area is large and welcoming.  I love to visit this place when back in Madison."}
{"text":"Not impressed.  Service was slow. Food was boring bar food.  Decent beer selection."}
{"text":"To be honest, I stopped by this place to grab a beer and cheese curds while I waited for a table at Graze. Although the Tipsy Cow was very crowded, we were still able to get a seat at a corner table for two. We were expecting a 45 minute wait to be seated at Graze, but we were called back within 20 minutes. Lucky for us, we had our beer, cheese curds and salad served about 10 minutes after we placed our order! Our server was amazing! It probably took an additional 10 minutes to eat our food and receive our check. Talk about a dine-n-dash!"}
{"text":"Nice staff. Kinda boring atmosphere. We didn't stay long. Food was good."}
{"text":"I rounded up from a 3.5, very good bar food, great beer selection and a knowledgeable bartending crew.  Had two things off the special menu, though it seems the pork shoulder sandwich with Tipsy Q sauce is on there a lot, pretty awesome with the slaw on top.  Big portions, very tasty, cheap.  I didn't miss the fries on the side, but the one thing we didn't realize was that everything is a la carte, no sides.  No big deal, but for first timers, if you're feeling like some deep fried yumminess on the side, order it from their very extensive and creative starters menu.  Expect a lengthy wait on a weekend night, but that's just Madison.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place.   Not only are the drinks cheap, they're good and the vibes are even better. Granted the hostess might be a little off in her time estimates (she quoted a 90 minute wait and then called us back in 15) but who cares! Grab your friends order the Tipsy burger with a beer and some cheese curds and you are set!   1. The burger-- juicy Cheesy melty goodness with fried onions. Please... just say yum   2. Cheese curds-- arguably the best in Madison and I will have to agree. My dilemma is between here, the old fashion, and graze...but the ranch is so great here... just yum   $3 jamo shots on fridays ... nuff said. You're good to go   Happy eating!"}
{"text":"It's really loud in there but for goat cheese curds, I will do almost anything.  Cheap drinks, cheap food, great time. Coming from Chicago, you'd be hard pressed to spend less than $10 on a great meal, which is what happened here. I split the goat cheese curds with a friend, and ordered 6 wings, and it was the perfect amount of food.  The honey harissa sauce for the wings gets a special shoutout because it was amazing. If you want spicy, savory, and a hint of sweet, go for this sauce. I was full by the 5th wing but just *had* to eat that 6th one for the sauce.  Bonus that they were playing the Cubs game on all of the TVs!"}
{"text":"We stopped in on a whim and ate outside on a beautiful Friday night.  The wait staff was friendly and attentive.  I had the Spicy Steak Sandwich and my 13 year old had the Lamb Burger-both were excellent!  We shared an order of Sour Cream and Onion fries which were addicting.  Didn't even step inside, so I can't attest to that, but food was excellent and beverage choices were plentiful."}
{"text":"Good bar service but their food is very greasy and the place is too crowded for my taste. I would not go there again."}
{"text":"I'm visiting from out of town but you can't go wrong with their cheese curds and tipsy burgers."}
{"text":"Very average. A bit disappointed since it was reviewed so high. Tipsy Burger was way too sloppy. Good outdoor eating area."}
{"text":"Soggy greasy meh fish fry. Cole slaw was good. Fries were pretty blah too. Over all disappointed with service and food. Atmosphere is beautiful and they have an amazing beer selection. I was surprised by how nasty the fish was."}
{"text":"Bar food? Nah, much more upscale and delicious than that! Husband had the asparagus and egg sandwich. Yep, sounded gross to me too. He said it was fantastic. I had to take a bite and indeed, it was! I had the ham and cheese sandwich. Very light, not greasy and delicious. Apps were fried cheese curds ( need I say more on this?) and carnitas fries. Heaven on a platter!  Service was great and prompt, location was fantastic too! A must for a casual lunch in Madison!"}
{"text":"I ate here last Wednesday, and it was as good as always. I had the House Roasted Turkey sandwich. It was great, and had a spicy mustard kick to it. The time prior, I had the Tipsy Burger, which was really good. I've eaten here a handful of times and have always liked the food.  They also have plenty of beer, and the bartenders/servers are always really good at what they do. I feel like the prices are decent for the quality of food you get.  A great choice if you are hanging out downtown."}
{"text":"We stopped in twice this week (once for a drink and once for food). This review is for the full dining experience.  Atmosphere is great. Inside was packed and we ended up being sat on the patio on a perfect fall evening.   Service was slowww. I mean the actual server took forever to stop by, beer rounds were hard to come by, etc. Food also took forever. Don't come here if you are in any sort of rush or if you just dislike slow service in general.  Food was okay but nothing great. I'd be okay eating here again but it would t be my first choice.   Overall just a meh place. Don't love it, don't hate it, just average."}
{"text":"Stopped here because it looked inviting with outside tables even tho we ate inside. Glacamole, bacon burger was great along with the generous serving of truffle fries and fried cheese curds. The sides were half orders. Service was excellent. A little on the noisy side even late Sat. afternoon when it wasnt real busy  Would definitely return."}
{"text":"The Tipsy Cow is a restaurant with a packed bar in Madison serving up traditional Wisconsin pub fare, and offers a few vegetarian items on their menu. It was quite busy for a gloomy, rainy Friday night. My close friend and I were up in Madison visiting another friend, and ended up getting dinner with a few of his friends. I was enroute to a wedding in Wisconsin Dells, but figured I could spend the night hanging out in Madison.  The wait was about 30 minutes, and once we ordered, it took about 40 minutes to get our food. I ordered the tomato soup, the house salad, and the portobello sandwich.  The soup was a thicker bisque that comes with cheese curds floating around inside. The cheese curds were a fun addition, but the soup tasted a bit Chef Boyardee like to me. And it was a very intense taste, more like a sauce than a soup. I ate it all, of course, fueled by the desire to consume as much delicious cheese in Wisconsin as possible. The house salad was kind of odd: the greens were super chopped up, as if the greens were meant to be a topping for something else. The salad was also topped with radishes and chunks of tomato. One of my friends ended up eating most of the salad. The sandwich was small, but it had a good combination of cheese, vegetables, and portobello on it.  My friend ordered a grilled cheese, which came with some ridiculous sauce between the layers of cheese. It was quite surprising to take a bite and see the sauce squirt out. She ended up letting me eat it with my tomato soup, which was kind of her.  Overall, the visit to The Tipsy Cow was fun, but as a restaurant, it is not on the same level as The Great Dane, and not even close to The Old Fashioned."}
{"text":"On a busy Wednesday evening.  We watched as our drinks sat at the bar with our server clearly overwhelmed and often nowhere to be found. After waiting for our appetizers for over 20 minutes,  we asked another server where they might be. She apologized and informed us that our server was \"new\". Suddenly our appetizers appeared. The truffle fries were tasty, but clearly had been sitting for awhile before making their way to our table. When our entrees arrived,  I realized that the salad  I received, albeit tasty,  was not the salad I ordered.  Our server was apologetic and we asked for a to go box and the bill and waited another 10+ minutes before we saw her again.   The food was good and service, while friendly, was lacking."}
{"text":"Goat cheese curds- 4 out of 5 moos Cheese curds were tasty. Didn't really notice a difference with the goat cheese, but they seemed less squeaky.   Alligator bites- 3 out of 5 moos First time trying alligator!  Tasted just like chicken. I think the buffalo and breaking took away from the alligator meat.   Guacamole bacon burger- 3 out of 5 moos Delicious guac, thick bacon, delicious burger. Wish there was more meat. I was able to substitute for goat cheese, definitely would recommend this cheese swap!  Only thing that is tipping this review from a 5 to a 4 is the service. Wait times to be seated and receive water were super slow. The waitstaff seemed very flustered."}
{"text":"$3 craft beer specials - what planet am I on?! I'm coming in from Chicago, where a craft beer STARTS at $6, and if you really want a $20 beer there is probably one on the menu.  So yeah, I'm really pleased with the Madison restaurant scene :D Tipsy Cow is no exception. I had the fried walleye sandwhich, and it was done up perfectly. There was some kind of spicy mayo and slaw on it, so there was some tanginess to balance out the savory fish fry flavor.  I had a hot pretzel as my side (?!) and it was great, would be the perfect compliment to a beer and burger combo.  Onion rings were a bit much for me, they are huge and hugely breaded. But whiffing on one side is no big deal, the pretzels were great :)"}
{"text":"Great cheese curds. Definitely recommend the goat cheese curds. They are super creamy with a sweet flavor and not an intense breading. Also super great tap lineup. Nice patio view of the city as well, weather permitting."}
{"text":"Spring in madison means outdoor seating at tipsy cow! I stopped by for a snack and beer. They have a great selection of beer, and their CHEESE CURDS YESSSS! Don't know what they do with their batter for their curds, but definitely one of my faves in madison! I'll definitely need to be back to have a full meal!"}
{"text":"AMAZING! We stopped here passing through town as tourists, not expecting such an incredible meal. The entire restaurant has a great vibe, delicious food, tasty drinks, and wonderful service. We will definitely stop by again next time we're in Madison!"}
{"text":"Like i said before which was removed ,sadly.   If you enjoy a good bar fight with a bunch of drunk roofers then The Tipsy Cow should be your destination of choice !! The owners have no control over their patrons which usually end up yelling, screaming and fighting every Friday and Saturday night up and down Main Street !!.....What Else Can I Say \"Flies Are Attracted To Shit\" !!"}
{"text":"\"The Tipsy Burger\"--tastiest burger in Town.   The only burger that ever made me pause to take the Lord's name in vain and exclaim, \"God %#@, that's a tasty burger!\"  Since then--over 7 years ago--I have been on a fruitless (but fun) quest to find one I like better.  I've had them in bowling alleys, bars (ie, Oakcrest, Blue Moon), chains (Five Guys, Fuddruckers, etc), and higher end (ie, Graze). None have dethroned The TB.  My quest continues.  Suggestions?  Ps--along with a Tipsy Burger, I strongly recommend a side order of their truffle fries and housemade pickles.     Pps--2nd place so far?  The brat/burger at Country Corners Bar out past Yahara Golf Course.  Greasy guilty burger brat heaven with hot salty fries (and fermented malt beverages on tap!) in a friendly spacious and accessible country bar."}
{"text":"Decent beer and food...rude indifferent staff. When the wait staff decides that THEY are more important than the patrons it is time to clean house.  If you can get a seat in the tipsy (which is rare) be prepared to be the object of disdain from the wait staff that has decided that their tips are more important than their service.  We all have been in crowded bars before, but when the staff decides that saying \"excuse me\" is no longer necessary it is time to send them packing to Buffalo Wild Wings or Quaker Steak & Lube where they undoubtably came from.  I was bumped repeatedly by the staff as I tried to drink a beer - twice hard enough to cause me to spill my drink... With not as much as a \"I'm sorry\".  The bartenders are nice however.  They do need to figure out that overly hopped beers are not necessarily good beers."}
{"text":"We been here three times over the last year, bringing family or friends who are visiting. The food is good and the location and restaurant is cool.  The downside is that each time we've been there we've noticed that service has been consistently slow.  The last visit my husband had to get up and corner our waiter to see the bill and hand him our card.    It's probably not our last time there as a couple but we probably will choose other places to take guests."}
{"text":"I was a little disappointed with the Tipsy Cow, The food left me saying meh and not wow! Although the cheese curds are at a very high bar, That couldn't convince me to add a fourth star, Overall a great place for beer and bar chow!"}
{"text":"Seven out of ten stars. I go here a lot to be outside on the deck, and there is often open seats (that should tell you something). I struggle with a large menu of things I don't want to order, and watch a lot of folks getting a burger in desperation. Great draft beer selection if you love hops, otherwise many bottles. Good staple on the square."}
{"text":"Solid place for a burger and a beer. Since I'm a Chicagoan, Spotted Cow on tap for $4 gives it an automatic 4 stars for me.   Cheese Curds: Less greasy than Old Fashioned's curds.  Solid, not memorable.  Burger $6: Quarter pound (\"1x1\") was well done and juicy. Comes with fried onions and cheddar. I had had cheese curds so a 1x1 was enough for me.  I would go back."}
{"text":"Great scratch made food.. awesome beer selection as well. Visiting the area and came here after the first place we tried was very limited menu. Tipsy cow has great selection. Order onion rings and that was meal by itself super fresh and huge.. then I did the tipsy burger is sooo good.. large and great flavor. The pickle were the key. Pickles are house made and by far the best ever!! Highly recommend this place.."}
{"text":"We came here because my husband saw a review on a burger blog about their burger. We were visiting friends in Madison and came for lunch.  It was definitely not too crowded on a Friday afternoon which was nice. We were able to hang out and catch up without feeling rushed. I can't speak to weekends or dinner time.  We both ordered the tipsy burger. It was juicy, cooked as asked (medium) and also HUGE. It was a double and I'm not used to eating that much so it was definitely filling. But we got it cuz that's what the burger blog said was great and it wasn't lying! It came with a side of our choice so we naturally got the fried cheese curds. The curds were perfectly fried with not too much batter and thus preserving the squeakiness of the cheese. Yum. The curds did not disappoint. I have to say they were the highlight but the burger was also really good.  There was a good selection of beers on tap. The servers were friendly and the place was chill. A great lunch spot with super yummy cheese curds and good burgers!"}
{"text":"Monty Python chalk drawings won me over right away!  The beer was great and the sever seemed to be knowledgable in the different beverages available.  We ordered the curds since we heard they were delicious, and they were impressive.  Maybe not the best in Madison but in the top 5.    The burger was delightfully greasy and the fries were yummy as well.  Definitely a fun place to hang out!"}
{"text":"I would consider myself a regular at the Tipsy Cow, both as a restaurant and a bar. Their beer list is out of this world. Their food list is consistently great - I have tried over half the menu and have yet to be disappointed. The waitstaff can be great, mediocre, or terrible - I've had all three types - but at least they're usually friendly. The bartenders are always phenomenal as humans as well as with recommendations. They really seem like the kind of guys who bond with their customers, reward their regulars by remembering their drinks, and are just overall nice people. Only negative? PLEASE fix the A/C! It's so hot I think I'm going to pass out sometimes."}
{"text":"Interesting menu and always a good atmosphere with plenty of energy.  You may experience some confusion at the hostess stand which is no big deal if you expect it. Good beer list while you wait and the ala carte sandwiches are good."}
{"text":"I had a smoked salmon grilled cheese and my boyfriend had the tipsy burger. The salmon must have not been handled properly. I ended up throwing up everything on the way back, almost fainted cause I was so sick! My boyfriend who only had a couple bite also got sick later that night. We were both in and out of bathroom all night. Very disappointed! NOT going back."}
{"text":"Went back to TC before dinner at Bellini and ordered a Tipsy Rita and Spotted Cow along with the Spinach and Artichoke Dip and tortilla chips. Drinks were good, holy moly the dip had a real kick to it. Place was half full and bartender kept us in good shape while we were there. Wanted to order cheese curds as they're awesome here but my better half wanted the dip.   Next time I'm getting cheese curds."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Had the sour cream and onion fries that the bartender recommended and they were great! Also had an order of the onion rings which were beer battered and thick. Also very good. Would definitely go back for dinner.sometime soon."}
{"text":"Food was good.  Waitress was maybe busy?  She wasn't around our table much.  One of the kids ordered a grilled cheese with bacon, but the bacon was missing.  Everyone else was pretty happy with their food.  Normally we have a really good experience here, but tonight was definitely off.  I can't even compose a proper review, so I'll just stop here."}
{"text":"I thought it is an excellent location at the capitol. And such a catchy name, always worths a shot to try.   I had a lamb burger with onion rings. I thought, oh my? How could my burger be so wet and drippy ? It was to the point of disgusting me especially towards the end of me biting on it. Onion rings, was massive, and they came out great though. The price was really a bargain, but do I want another soaked burger ? I don't think so unfortunately."}
{"text":"This place gets 4 stars as one of the best cheese curd places in Madison. Try the goat cheese especially!  The Tipsy Burger and Truffle Fries were incredibly underwelming, however. I was told that this was the best burger place in Madison and it couldn't hold a candle to numerous other Madison burger establishments.  Think I'll stick with the cheese curds."}
{"text":"Service was great, we got seated quickly despite the crowd. Beer selection is pretty good. Naturally, we ordered Spotted Cow. Also got a mixed drink, which was made well. Started off with Korean beef fries - 4 stars. Really good. Would've been 5 stars if there was more beef on the fries. For entree my fiancée and I both ordered chicken sandwiches and this is where the 2 stars come in. I would bet good money that our chicken patties were frozen. And if they're not frozen, then they should consider new cooks because it's not difficult whatsoever to cook chicken. Not to mention the chicken was a proper serving size for a child, not an adult. Maybe 2.5oz. It was rubbery and thin. Just like the frozen patties you can get at the store! I paid $9 for $3.50 sandwich. Overall, I wouldn't return."}
{"text":"I think this place is great. Good beer specials, comfortable place to lounge near other bars and the square, and most importantly--great junk food. Seriously, the cheese fries here are the best cheese fries (cheese sauce, not melted cheddar) I've ever had. At $7 for a medium-small serving they'd better be, but they were. Burgers are your run-of-the-mill good burgers, thin and greasy, and you order them stacked. $5 for one patty is far too expensive, but $11 for a quadruple burger seems about right since it's about 300 grams of delicious fat in one serving. This place isn't as nice as the Old Fashioned or Graze, but if you're just looking for some real Wisconsin grub and a beer, The Cow is more casual and just as good if not better.  PS -- I've heard complaints about their lack of vegetarian options. They should totally just add a texas toast grilled cheese to the menu or something."}
{"text":"Stopped here after checking into my hotel for a quick bite and a beer. Service was super fast, food was good and prices very reasonable. Check out the New Glarus Spotted Cow."}
{"text":"Greasy Spoon!  Based on Yelp reviews we went for lunch.  We had the grilled chicken sandwich, a bacon cheeseburger and onion rings.  All of it was waaaay greasy.  The onion rings were the worst for grease.  There were extra napkins at the table.  It was good, because they were needed to wipe away the grease.  The buns on both the burger and the chicken sandwich were soggy.  We don't drink beer.  Maybe that's the attraction here.  For food...not a good choice."}
{"text":"My husband and I really did not enjoy this restaurant and it takes a lot for us to not enjoy food as we are not picky. I think my biggest complaint about the restaurant is how close they put the 2 seat tables together. There was maybe half a foot between each so you couldn't have a conversation with the person you were with as everyone around you could easily hear your conversation. Our server took a while to bring us the food and then disappeared for a while and all those around us who came later received their checks and left before we did (they all had different servers). We also both ordered items with buffalo and both were so hot we couldn't even eat them. We normally like buffalo food but this was so hot that we could barely take a bite without having to take a drink of water. I will say that the drink selection was good and they had some good beers on tap. Other than that we were not too impressed."}
{"text":"Both the goat cheese and regular curds were good. Service is really slow. I had the green salad and it made me sick. It was not cold at all, I think the lettuce had been out all day. Went on 7/16/16"}
{"text":"Cheap prices for high quality food and cocktails!! truffle fries were on point and the goat cheese curds are worth the up grade. Asparagus and egg sandwich was really good and the I like how the artichoke dip came with veggies to dip. Cool open atmosphere right on the street. I would definitely recommend and go back."}
{"text":"I like going to the Tipsy Cow on occasion, and it's for a few reasons:  1. The appetizer selection is deep-fried delicious in my tummy. They serve a lot of the standard fare (onion rings, fries, etc.), but they also offer a few unique items. Some of these include the Zucchini Chips, and the Goat Cheese curds, both of which I thought tasted great. On top of that, you can order numerous variations of the french fries, as you can get a lot of different sauce/topping combinations like buffalo/blue cheese, bbq/ranch, sour cream/onion, and garlic aioli.  2. Despite the name, it manages to be vegetarian friendly. It's not as good as say The Green Owl or Ha Long Bay, but there's a few vegetarian sandwiches, and a couple good salads to select from.  3. The tap selection rotates frequently, and is usually a stellar ensemble cast. It's mostly Wisconsin brews, but it adds in a few welcome guests as well.  4. The avocado tacos on Thursdays are to die for! They're easy to eat, packed with flavor, and filling.  All of this makes the Tipsy Cow a good place to spend an evening, but it could use a couple tune ups to be really great. Some of the sandwiches I have had could have tasted better, the appetizer selection could use 1 or 2 healthier choices, and the taps could have a bit of a larger selection (although the tap selection changing a lot does help make up for this). Maybe i'm just being picky though. I do know however that the Tipsy does some things really well, so sticking to those is a sure bet when you visit."}
{"text":"We went to the Tipsy Cow last night and got there at about 6:15. Had to wait about 15 minutes for a table which was fine. About 15 minutes after we were seated we looked up and the place was packed.   I was hungry so I ordered the Tipsy Burger and the bacon and blue cheese fries.  The burger was juicy and delicious. The fries were also very tasty. We also ordered the Tipsy chicken sandwich which was a bit  dry. I wouldn't order that again.   I like this restaurant and will go back. The food is good and they have a nice beer selection."}
{"text":"Came in on a Friday night around 6:30pm on the recommendation of someone I got to chatting to while bottling wine the other week.  I was told that they had 18 beers on tap, and full pints (20oz, not the reduced size they're pushing downtown these days) were always on for $6, so I was sold!  The place was close to half full already - a good sign that early in the night, though a Raptors game was coming on later.  The staff were great, and I was pleasantly surprised to see one of my fav (but hard to find) drafts on tap - Kronenbourg Blanc!    Food-wise, I had the nachos and they were quite nice - and probably one of the best layered I've ever had (chips underneath weren't bare).  Price/value-wise, definitely a good deal.  Only exception - $3 for fruit juice - that seemed steep.  They also don't have a kids' menu but were able to strip down the chicken poutine to just a standard poutine (and charged less), which was quite nice.  They also apparently plan on having a kids' menu at some point.  The guy who chatted with us (dang, forget his name - he's a songwriter that's all I remember) was awesome - giving us some background on the place and about future plans.  Apparently the owner also owns pubs (Firkins) in Toronto as well, and it shows in the high quality of the setup and food here.  Only other negative - the tables are new but don't really match the other bar decor - wooden pub-style ones would match better and feel more appropriate than the current light-coloured tables.  See the pictures someone else uploaded to see what I'm talking about.  They told us they've had the same thoughts and are still thinking about these as well.  OK that all said, this place has definitely 5 star potential - minor hiccups in the decor and pricing notwithstanding, I'm going to be back here soon and hope to upgrade this to a 5 star.  Even in its current state though, best pub in town!"}
{"text":"So, came to the Tipsy Cow at about 1:30 ish pm. Restaurant looked full, but we were sat within 5 minutes. Waiter came and took our food order, and that was it. Didn't see him again for another 30 minutes. No check in or telling us our food was delayed. We had to flag down a different waitress to see what the hold up was. Our original Waiter came back and offered some lame excuse, and said our food was \"coming right out\". Waited another 5-10 minites before it finally came.  We waited 45 minutes total for our food. People who were sat AFTER us got their food before we did. That seems to be a bit ridiculous considering we were a party of three, and we were ordering bar food.   When the food finally arrived, it was decent. Beer battered fries were good. Chicken sandwich was kinda meh. I had ordered it crispy, but it came grilled. Kinda dry and flavorless. Still ate it though because I was so effin' hungry from waiting so damn long.   Either there were issues in the kitchen or our waiter just completely forgot about us. It didn't seem like they were short staffed because there was plenty of wait staff around. Either way, they did comp half our meal so that was nice. Honestly I would be more forgiving and probably wouldn't be writing a review had the waiter checked in with us on a regular basis."}
{"text":"we had a big group in for a wedding brunch a couple of weeks ago the wait staff are awesome super friendly and accommodating the food is good I would recommend to anyone"}
{"text":"Was recommended by an Epic training instructor. We went there to try the cheese curds. It was excellent."}
{"text":"i Basked in the flavors of the Tipsy burger. Filled my craving to the max for a burger. The bloody was bland and watery. But the bartender was attentive and friendly to all the customers. Great tap list too. Will sure be back to try some fries that looked awesome but too big of a serving for this girl by her self this time."}
{"text":"Fun place! And good, cheap menu."}
{"text":"Mostly the experience ruined this place for us. Got seated just inside on the left next to the women's bathroom door. The door SLAMMED constantly through the entire meal. This area is also right next to the bar where the bartenders are clanking glasses and doing dishes. Had a raging headache by the time I left. As for the food, I'd give it a 3/5. Cheese curds 5/5, terrific! Bacon/avocado burger was good, but bacon tasted like pre cooked Oscar Meyer bacon and the fries resembled the deep-fried, belly burners I used to get at the Iowa state fair. Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"The Tipsy is not generally a bad bar; in fact usually it's great. However, there have been some serious problems when they run Trivia on Mondays, that may reveal bigger problems with their hosting practices. Simply put, they cannot manage table allocation when they're busy, and they do not put fairness or efficiency high on their list for seating.  Our team went every Monday night for months, becoming familiar faces in the process. But as trivia became more popular, we had to show up earlier and earlier to ensure we'd get a table. This is in part due to Tipsy's policy that at least half of a party must be present to be seated -- and worse, that they can't even put their names on a list until that point.  Pretty soon we were coming close to an hour ahead of time, and we'd often wait most or all of it. We were usually a big party, and as such we tried to be predictable, patient and compliant, but too often we were told tables couldn't be put together, or were forgotten about, or we watched as multiple smaller parties would be ushered in ahead of us, all with curt, inattentive service from the hosts.  Finally, on a particular night when the whole gang was there a full hour ahead of time, we immediately indicated we wanted a table. We waited for 45 minutes as we occasionally checked in with half-aware staff distributing long-empty tables, then were told there was a table opening up that we could get in 5-10 minutes. Scouting revealed the party in question had finished their food and signed their check some time ago, and were just sitting chatting. After 15 minutes had gone by, we asked whether the hostess might politely mention to them that others were waiting to be seated, but she laughingly informed us that wasn't possible. 10 minutes after that, we asked again what the status was, and the hostess blithely informed us that we'd actually been second on the list, and that OUR table would be opening up shortly -- it would probably be another 5-10 minutes.  We left, and have not gone back for trivia. However, even without considering that we were regular customers, their behavior seemed so rude and cavalier that many of us have developed pretty negative feelings about them. After all, it was really the culmination of a string of problems, not an isolated incident; and we felt they could have managed not just more efficiently, but more sympathetically.  To some this might sound whiny, but as a former server myself at a similar establishment, I just couldn't believe how little weight they seemed to be giving customer experience. Maybe they thought as long as they were busy, they didn't have to care."}
{"text":"Had lunch here with some friends a few weeks ago. The food was excellent, service was decent, prices are okay. I had a burger and our group shared the Korean BBQ fries and alligator bites. Korean BBQ fries were okay; just fries with spicy mayo and some bulgogi, probably won't order that again. But the alligator bites! The alligator bites were SO good and I wish I could eat those every day! The burger I had was also excellent. I got the lamb burger topped with a fried egg and it was just perfect!  We sat outside because it was such a nice day, but I feel like because we were outside our server didn't come to check on us very often. We all ran out of water and had to flag down another server after waiting for quite a while. Aside from that, service was friendly and quick so I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Traveling through looking for authentic WI cheese curds and read a couple of reviews on this place. We were not disappointed with the cheese curds, they were great! The place was packed for happy hour we are assuming. They had a variety of beers and on Thursdays you get $1 off tap beers! We had the grilled ham and cheese, BLT, fries, tomato soup, and tequila chicken salad. The grilled ham and cheese was cheesy, but maybe too cheesy for my taste(right! In WI something was too cheesy!). It had good flavor, but it was overwhelming. I didn't care for the tomato soup. It was very sweet and thick, and left a strange aftertaste in my mouth. BLT was tasty, great bacon! The fries were incredible. The salad was decent, but the chipotle dressing wasn't my favorite."}
{"text":"Great butter chicken and naan. Even better with pint of Muskoka Detour. Service is excellent."}
{"text":"Last night was my first time at the Tipsy Cow. We went for my boyfriend's birthday. We had a very enjoyable time. The food was great. I had a traditional cheeseburger and a half order of truffle fries. For an appetizer we shared the cheese curds. I think they were the best cheese curds I ever had. They melted in my mouth.   I gave the business 4 out of 5 stars for two reasons. First, I informed the staff that it was my boyfriend's birthday and they didn't do anything for it. No dessert or free beer. I wish they would have made it more special for him. Second, the server did not clear the cheese curd basket away until after we finished eating our main meal. The table was super small and it would have been nice to have the extra space but that wasn't a major deal.   I would go back but not to celebrate a birthday."}
{"text":"Oh Tipsy Cow.  I love you.  I have eaten here several times and I have never been disappointed.  It is a comfortable restaurant with decently priced food.  They have simple burgers and more dressed up burgers.  I have been a fan of their beer-battered fries and cheese curds for quite some time.  Then, my world changed.  I tried their truffle fries.  Yes, you just read that.  TRUFFLE tries.  Wow.  $8 you say?  Well worth it.  Share with a friend.  You get what you pay for and that is amazingness.    They have great service.  I went to their booth at the Taste of Madison and the line moved fast.  They were so friendly even though they were slammed.  They are always friendly.  Oh Tipsy Cow, I love you.  My only Tipsy complaint?  I hate sharp cheddar and that is their standard cheese.  I know there are a few others but I am not a big fan of their cheese assortment.  Please add mild cheddar for people out there like me."}
{"text":"This is my all time favorite place to get Cheese curds! So amazing as it's tender, cheesy, and crispy and they provide some delicious ranch to go with them. The service was fair as I knew they were busy  but their other foods are delicious. We got some alligator bites too which is unique to get here in Madison"}
{"text":"On a whim I decided to stop in because if the name. \"The Tipsy Cow\" in Madison Wisconsin is a classic name. It is a great little place to stop for a beer with their large selection of bottles and daily draught specials and an incredible menu of burgers, sandwiches and appetizers. The service was pretty good too which made this an excellent experience."}
{"text":"Yum! I happened to stop here before doing some pre-great taste drinking and I am so glad. The burger was fantastic! I can't remember the name of it, but the combination of cheeses and sauce and bacon and beef was something bordering on magical. I also highly recommend the cheese curds. It was my top choice for them for sure! Wish I could have stayed longer to sample a few more beers and bites!"}
{"text":"Best burger EVER! Super juicy but not greasy, thick cut bacon that was actually not flabby, and the Tipsy sauce! Only issue was the waitress... She actually admitted that she forgot about us. It was a Monday, so the C team must have been in play."}
{"text":"The Truffled Portabella Mushroom Sandwich totally blew me away! We walked into this place because we couldn't get a seat in another restaurant. Once we got our food we're glad we came here instead."}
{"text":"I stopped here for lunch by myself on a Friday afternoon, at about 11:45. It's pretty small inside - I was seated right away, but it looked as though there were several groups waiting to be seated as I neared the end of my visit at 12:15.  Service was fine, not outstanding but not terrible. Again, I was seated by myself so others may have had a different experience.   The food itself was average. I had the fish fry - the fish was great, but it was a smaller portion than I expected for the price. The bread and coleslaw tasted as expected, and the fries were good (although under the fish, so some pieces got soggy).   My overall experience was good. I'd come back again, perhaps with a group of friend to see if the dining experience changes. It looks like a great place to grab a drink!"}
{"text":"This review is mainly for the Trivia on Monday night. We arrived around 7:30 for 8 trivia, and luckily were able to get 3 seats at the bar, since the place was packed otherwise. The trivia was a lot of fun, spanned a lot of categories, and gave us all good conversation starters.   We shared the spinach and artichoke dip, which was below average. There wasn't really any artichoke in it, and it was just overpoweringly cheesy and creamy (which doesn't sound bad, but it really wasn't a good dip). It came with an abundance of veggies and chips to dip in it though, which was nice that they didn't limit that.   Would definitely return and order a different appetizer, or order a full meal."}
{"text":"Highlight: If you're like me and you're a lactose intolerant cheese lover, then head on down to the Tipsy Cow and order the goat cheese curds! You can enjoy Cheese Curds without the dreadful after effects.   Overall, I'm ALWAYS satisfied at the TC. I was weary of their shrimp salad (coz true bar food can be suspect, sometimes) and it exceeded my expectations. Also, they've got homemade cookies that are novel and irresistible. :D   Trivia night is SUCH FUN. Definitely would recommend trying it out. I suck at trivia, and still had a blast, haha"}
{"text":"The Good: Ate at Tipsy Cow with some out of town guests. We were all very happy with our meal. I ordered a salad to balance the cheese curds-the meal was delicious and the service was efficient.   The Not So Good: Unfortunately, we had a very long wait for our table. This would not have been the end of the world but there was nowhere really to stand and wait. I alternated between being shoved around for a bit and standing by the cold door.   Highlight: The regular cheese curds. The best I have had in Madison!"}
{"text":"Super cute place in Mad-town.  We were bar hopping and came across this place and decided to stop in for some drinks and appetizer before going to dinner at The Old Fashioned.   We were fairly early, before 6pm, so it was pretty empty.  Plus, school was out so the whole town was rather quiet.  It worked out well though because we were able to get seats right at the bar, no problem.  Okay, so this was my first time getting Alligator Bites.  Yes, I ate alligator.  And strangely, it tasted like chicken.  It was actually really good!  The bartender recommended it so we went for it.  Delicious!  And of course, Cheese Curds.  Yes, more cheese curds.  I liked the curds here.  Not sure I would say they were the best ever, but it was good!"}
{"text":"I came here based on the glowing reviews. But really, it's was quite the disappointment.  We were seated instantly, but our server took forever to greet us, let alone, give us water or the drinks we ordered.  The burgers we received were below average. Thinking that it would be wise to get the burger named after the restaurant (tipsy burger) upon its arrival the bread was soft and soggy. Overall not very well together. I would say that this was a mess of a \"restaurant\". It should just be called a bar & charge bar prices for these burgers because I do not feel this was more than a three dollar burger."}
{"text":"Just another fantastic meal at Tipsy. This time it is the wings with Spicy Asian sauce.  Delicious.  Service is great as always.  Nice tap selection. James for $3....very nice."}
{"text":"Great! I have sat down to eat at Tipsy Cow multiple times now. Always very pleased with the food and service. I have ordered everything from their original Tipsy burger to fish tacos. The food is always presented ina fashionable manner. They make everything look good enough to eat! All I can say is truffle fries!!!!!! In the mood for cheese curds, well i have found the place for you to get them!!!!! The cheese selection for their burgers was untouchable by other food joints around the capital. Tipsy cow is great! Enough said."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and didn't have high expectations because it just seemed like a typical bar restaurant.  But, the grilled cheese with bacon was AMAZING.  OMG, it was perfectly tangy, generous cheddar cheese, and they slabbed some creamy sauce on it that melted into the perfect consistency- melty, gooey, and delicious on a crispy thick multigrain bread.  We also got their fried cheese curds which were good too, they tasted like little pieces of fried mozzarella sticks but more chewier and fresh.    I wish I could come back to eat the grilled cheese...for dinner, lunch, breakfast, again and again!"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch and almost left. It took 10 minutes to get drink orders in, than 10 more to get the drinks! Finally got our food order in and waited 20 more minutes. As I was about to arrupt the food showed up. Unbelievable food! I was super pleased. If they could resolve the terrible service this would be a great place with a great menu."}
{"text":"The Tipsy Cow gets five stars for their name. As for their food and drink, they also get five stars.  I've been here a few times now and my go-to is a Bloody Mary with a chaser of Spotted Cow (they don't do chasers outside of Wisco and it's a horribly sad thing). As for the food, well I always go with the Cheese Curds, because these are some of the most amazing Cheese Curds you could have. The bloody is a perfect mix, not too horseradishy and just spicy enough, of course you have some garnishes or snacks as I call them on top. If you're visiting Madison, make this a place to visit as it's worth your time and money!"}
{"text":"Order the cheese curds and a tipsy burger. It's a small place that gets crowded on the weekends but it's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"So after reading lots of positive reviews on this place we decided to come here on a thursday night with another couple. I was throughly not impressed, it was quite packed for a thursday evening but we only had to wait a couple mins for seating. After getting seated we waited atleast 15 mins just for a waitress to notice us, just for her to comeover and tell us that we would be receiving the \"trainee\" and she'd be right with us........ another 15 mins go by, no server. If it were just us we would've left but we were with other people. Once the original waitress came to check if the trainee came by and we said no, she took the order. (Mind you this was our drink and meal order) We all ordered drinks me and 2 other got tap beer.. not hard to screw up but my bf got a moscow mull, was made incredibly wrong to where he couldn't even finish it. The food on the other hand definitely not impressed, didn't like either of my things, tomato soup which wasn't even hot, and salmon potato cakes, the salmon was inedible. Our friends got salads (kinda hard to screw up) nothing too exciting and my bf got the tilapia sandwich which was soggy Yuck!! All in all we'd only be back for some of their drink specials, but doubtful.   + server was a sweetheart (short blonde haired girl)  +atmosphere was cool"}
{"text":"Great burger.  The appetizers are great and the beer selection is as well.  The only issue is the place is so busy since switching over to Tipsy Cow its hard to get a spot outside."}
{"text":"A great place to get American fried food and craft beer.  I like Tipsy Cow for 3 reasons:  1) They may not have the most incredible, knock your socks off food in the world, but their menu is so fun. They have so many different burgers, sandwiches, and fries. Just a great variety of bar food that gets interesting with influence from all over the world.  2) Their grilled cheese is probably my favorite grilled cheese ever. It's brutally cheesy. I swear theres more cheese than bread on that monster. I think they said they use six different cheeses. That thing will just drip cheese down your arm like a juicy peach (except cheese instead of peach juice).  3) Tipsy Cow always has a solid beer selection with one or two standouts. This weekend, they had Waldo's Special Ale by Lagunitas which had sold out at Trixie's Liquor in one day. This isn't a beer review, but it's a good beer if you ever see it around."}
{"text":"Very friendly bartender and delicious cocktails! Chocolate cookie was also awesome Thanks!"}
{"text":"I stopped in while on my road trip.  Street park your car, the meters will take credit cards :)  Inside was smaller then I expected, but they do have outdoor seating, but when it's 90+ outside, I prefer the inside where the AC is running and it's cool :)  I came here because of one thing - fried cheese curd!  Long before my trip started, I spent a lot of time looking places to eat, while I'm sure there are other restaurants that offer fried cheese curds, I bookmarked this place and had to swing by.  So, yeah... ordered the fried cheese curd and the tipsy burger... of course, got a beer as well.  I'm giving 4 stars because of the fried cheese curd!  It was fried perfectly, the cheese was not to overly salty and I ate it like it as popcorn!  I could have consumed this for hours (not recommend for health reasons)!!!    As for their burger, it was juicy, but the meat patties unfortunately lacked flavors... the patties were bland and unfortunately other items in the burger did not bring the seasoning together.  Bit more of seasoned salt on the patties would been awesome!  But definitely recommend the cheese curds!!!"}
{"text":"We stopped here on a quick visit to see our daughter, and it was a great little place!  We sat in a booth/table in the back area and it was a warm and cozy place for lunch and a visit.  The service was attentive and friendly, and it had a relaxed atmosphere.  There is some metered parking on the street, but also a ramp across the street (although it's pricey....we paid $12 for about 90 minutes because we didn't see any metered parking available at the time!).  The menu was interesting with something for everyone.  They have about 8 different kinds of topped fries in their appetizer section.  We had the Korean fries which had nice, crunchy fries, Korean BBQ beef, onions and some chopped veggies, and a sriracha mayo.  It was a hit, and lasted about 5 minutes even though it was a decent portion. You just couldn't get enough.  Because the fries were so good, my daughter and I both ordered the Korean BBQ sandwich.  You can get a half order of any appetizer to have as a side to the sandwich so that was really cool!  She ordered a small house salad and that was made with really nice ingredients as well.  The sandwich was good, but not as good as the fries.  It would have been better with just a touch more beef on it since that kind of got lost in the bread and veggies.  My husband had a bowl of their chili and said that was pretty good as well.    This is a fun place with lots of options including many unique choices you don't see everywhere else.  The prices are reasonable with nice sized portions, and the service was great!"}
{"text":"After walking around Cows on the Concourse we decided to finally check out The Tipsy Cow (how appropriate, after all).  As we walked up to the door we got to admire all of the delicious food people were eating at the outdoor seating, and it was 2pm already so I was ready for a large meal and a beer. We enter the doors and we're immediately greeted by cow decor everywhere, love it. The whole thing just screamed \"THIS IS WISCONSIN.\"  We were seated shortly with only a brief wait and dropped off at the general seating area of the restaurant (away from the bar) by the hostess. I began to peruse the tap list, and I was immediately disappointed. All of the buzz that I had heard about the tap-list at Tipsy Cow had generally been praise worthy. Unfortunately, the list I was seeing was targeted at burnt hops IPA drinkers. The only malty delicious beer on beverage was a Left-Hand Stout (which I love but have had many times). I ended up settling on a bottle due to the lack of diversity on tap.  Our party put in an order of cheese curds, which arrived with our drinks. The cheese curds were heavily breaded and luke-warm. Overall, they were fairly average. I just wasn't impressed, as I prefer a lighter breading, gooey cheese, and a warmer curd inside. Fortunately, the curds were not greasy at all!  For the main course I ordered a grilled turkey and Havarti sandwich. The sandwich was okay, but it was nothing stellar. It definitely had too much meat on it and not enough cheese/other dressings. It looked like there was about an inch worth of packaged lunch meat on it.  I ordered a side of zucchini chips with the sandwich, and I enjoyed them quite a bit. The chips were cut a little thicker and the breading wasn't too heavy. I appreciate that the chips were not soggy and overcooked. They actually tasted like zucchini, I would recommend them over the cheese curds for a side here.  My friend ended up order alligator bites. I can't speak much for the quality of the bites, as I only have had alligator one other time. I appreciate that Tipsy Cow has an interesting menu item to choose, but I would not recommend it unless you know what to expect. Alligator tends to be a very tough meat, and that quality really came through in the bites. My friend couldn't finish the side, even with the help of my wife and me.  Despite the average food, I think we will return to Tipsy Cow on occasion. I just do not feel blown away by anything specific on the menu. The food is just what I would expect from an average bar in Madison."}
{"text":"WOW - Tipsy Cow delivered on our first visit.  Alex (with an X) took wonderful care of us, introducing us to the Tipsy Cow menu and many options for adult beverages.  We started with Alligator bites, yum and a dark beer and a spiced cider - all excellent.  I tried the Tipsy Cow Burger Saturday special - a couple Knoche Burgers, truffled mushrooms covered with a sunny side egg - WOW! One of the best burgers I've had in years.  She tried the griddled turkey and havarti - loved it.  A real treat on the side was the \"Mike's Pickles\" - just like Mom used to make - we even took a couple of orders home with us!  If you are visiting the Capitol or Downtown in Madison - stop by the Tipsy Cow - I know you'll enjoy your visit."}
{"text":"We ate dinner here last night after curds and drinks at The Old Fashioned (see prior review).  It was my first time eating at Tipsy and I wanted to try the fish (cod) after the rave reviews on yelp.  My girlfriend had a beer and I had a mojito.  My mojito was lacking sugar...it was heavy on soda taste.  My fish was a mahogany color and delicious but my coleslaw was not as creamy as I like and it was pink.  Don't get me wrong...I'm all for breast cancer awareness....but the pink slaw threw me.  One of Marcia's pieces of fish, about half of it, was like rubber.  She was wondering what was wrong with it so I said give it here....I honestly couldn't bite through it!  I liked this restaurant but if we go back Marcia said she will not order the fish again....that means we will never eat here on a Friday since that's her fish day.    As a side note (don't judge me) I ordered carry out -the taco carnitas platter- for breakfast today.  It was yummy as was Marcia's other piece of fish at 10:30 last night. *wink*  haha good eating everyone!!"}
{"text":"My friend and I went in for lunch today.  We've ordered: PBR Battered Fish Tacos, Fried Cheese Curds and Tipsy Burger. We REALLY enjoyed fish tacos and cheese curds. This was our first time trying fish tacos and we both fell in love. Tipsy Burger on the other hand fell flat or should I say fat. It was really greasy.  I would give this place a 5 stars if not for the burger."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in Madison to grab a burger, some curds and a beer. They have a wide variety of burgers as well as a bunch of options for baskets of fries with extra things on top (I tried Korean BBQ last time and it was pretty solid). Good beers on tap and a good vibe."}
{"text":"Went to this place with my three kids only because Yelp rated it good for kids.  Wrong!  This is a bar first and they do not even have a kids menu.  We did not realize there was not a kids menu until after waiting 20 minutes for our table.  At that point we decided to stick it out and split a chicken fritters appetizer with the kids.  Then the lady who brought the water dumped her tray on me and my son.  She said she was sorry, but the waitress and the manager treated us like it was our fault.  Pretty sure they thought one of our kids knocked something over.  I don't even think the manager believed us when we said did not make the mess.  My shirt and pants were completely soaked and I had to walk around the farmers market in the cold and wind with wet clothes.  Not fun!  Do not go here with your children!"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff and a wide assortment of gastropub food. What more could you want.  We stopped at the Tipsy Cow for an early Friday afternoon lunch while in Madison for a conference. Although it was early (1130 am), the staff went out of their way to make certain we had a lunch table set-up outside and felt welcome.  The burgers are awesome. They tend to run a bit on the greasy side for me - but the flavors were really nice. I especially liked the truffle fires. Although I wish they had been a bit \"crisper.\"  There is a wide assortment of libations on the menu. However, we did not partake - given the early hour of our lunch and the need for further \"work focused\" concentration for the rest of the afternoon. I would suggest - a great Friday Happy Hour includes a visit to the Tipsy Cow for a cold beer, truffle fries, burger and salad. That would be a great way to start a weekend.  The restaurant/bars location, in close proximity to the Capitol, means there is never a shortage of people watching and interesting street-happenings. Especially in the summer months when the city of Madison seems to come alive with the warm sunshine and pleasant afternoons."}
{"text":"The Tipsy Burger is awesome. I never eat chili fries, except here. And the beer menu is excellent. I regard Tipsy Cow as an upscale tavern. One downside: the air conditioner can't keep up when it's crowded."}
{"text":"Exactly what I was looking forward to during a trip to the cold north. Delicious fried cheese curds, awesome kielbasa n kraut, huge (!) salads, and just-creative enough drinks.  Not too hard on the wallet, either. Give it a shot if you're in the mood for pub eating."}
{"text":"I love the tipsy cow! This place has great burgers and crazy amazing French fry appetizers! They also have a stellar tap beer selection, though I tend to always get the Crispin Cider Beer. Great place to come, just as good as the Old Fashion but with less of a wait for a table. Oh and AMAZING CHEESE CURDS"}
{"text":"When I am downtown Madison I always think about Tipsy Cow. I am a sucker for a good beer, tasty fries, and the perfect chicken wing. They have a great craft beer menu that is always rotating. The menu isn't overwhelming but they have plenty of options for everyone. They also have outdoor seating when the weather is perfect in Wisconsin!   If you like toppings on your fries this is the place to go. I believe they have 7 or 8 different types of loaded fries. The size is enough to share, or to have as a meal. Korean BBQ, Gyro, or Carnitas fries.... need I say more??   The chicken wings are big, non breaded, and perfectly done (in my eyes). I prefer an extra crispy wing, and these are exactly that. I am also a sucker for a dry rub which is exactly what the parmesan peppercorn is. Although I am not a fan of blue cheese dressing they are able to change that to ranch upon request.    Oh and the specials are great!! You can't go wrong with 1/2 priced wings on Monday, and I highly recommend the PBR battered fish taco(s) for $3 on Thursdays!"}
{"text":"I played trivia here on a Monday night. They were packed, so much so that we had to grab chairs from outside for everyone to sit around the small table we snagged. As busy as the place was, I was quite impressed with the service; our water was always full and drinks kept getting refilled. This was good because it was sweltering inside. I don't know if it was too many people or a problem with the AC, but it was hot.   The fries were good and the cheese curds looked good. Ill have to come back and get some real food."}
{"text":"When you picture a Wisconsin bar, The Tipsy Cow is exactly what you'd picture. Everything down to the music and the decor adds to the quaint pub feel.   The hamburgers are really good and juicy with a nice burger to bun ratio. The only downside is that there are no fries included. The beer menu is also amazing.  Our waitress was very attentive and the food came and quickly even though it was a busy Friday night. I would definitely go again."}
{"text":"I enjoy the Tipsy Cow food and ambiance and it would be one of my favorite lunch spots but it's near impossible to get in and out of the restaurant in under 90 minutes. 90 minutes isn't a feasible lunch option for most working professionals. They need to get more servers or speed up their kitchen or their lunch crowds will continue to dwindle."}
{"text":"Such a cute place. I love that there's outdoor seating and the adorable cow decor. I tried their fries, aioli sauce, and tipsy burger, which was delish!   They also have a sizeable beer selection which was really great.I read on Yelp that the tipsy cows Bloody Mary was to die for, but when I tried it it seemed to be a generic bloody mix (but you get a spotted cow chaser!)   It was really nice to sit at the bar, read some stuff, and chat with other people at the bar. A lot of the patrons there are very friendly.  Overall, this is a great casual place to get a burger and fries (although the fries don't come w the burger which is a bummer) and some beer during the summer and spring time."}
{"text":"Stopped here for brunch..Service was quick and food was great as well, esp fish and chips & cheese curds. Burger was just average.  Overall, a good place to grab a quick bite or hang out."}
{"text":"That was the best burger I have ever had. The Tipsy Burger uses the best local melt in your mouth ground beef , sharp and delicious aged brick and cheddar cheese, applewood smoked bacon. Lastly, they top it off with a tangy Tipsy sauce that brings out everything else the burger has to offer. Otherwise, great service and good beer selection -like any other popular well managed bar in Wisconsin."}
{"text":"It's been 3 years since my original review and Tipsy continues to be my go-to burger/beer spot.  They recently updated their menu and I am glad to see the lamb burger (often a special) now has a permanent home.  It's one of my all time faves-local lamb, Roth Kase Gruyère , Nueske bacon and a sunny-side egg.  Tipsy has a rotating menu of beers (with spotted cow always holding a spot).  As a man who likes to try any/everything, I appreciate that I can come in and try 1 (or 2 or 3) beers I've never experienced before."}
{"text":"It's doubtful we'll be back to the Cow. Stopped here with my spouse on a beautiful Saturday night about 10pm. The streets were buzzing, with activity all over downtown, and we thought we'd enjoy the lovely evening outside at the sidewalk tables.  We noticed that it said to check with wait staff if we wanted to sit outside, so I asked one of the servers walking by if it was ok. He said, \"Sure.\" That was the last we saw of a server. Well, at our table. We had four different servers walk by us, serve other tables, bring checks, bus tables over ten minute time frame...but not one made eye contact with us or took our order.   The only thing I can figure is that they wanted to close up outside seating, and therefore intentionally ignored us. That's okay: we just will find other places to take our business."}
{"text":"Great Burgers. Great Appetizers. Great beers. Fast Service.  It's the perfect combination for a bar.   They also open some exclusive beers on occasion.  Recently had Dog Fish Head 120 Min IPA.   It's a great combination, I've been here for lunch, and for dinner, and all of the above were true.   Most of the times I've noticed the same bar tender, and give props to the guy.  He runs a good ship, and kept our drinks at the ready, and food handy when we sat at the bar.  Often at lunch they have the Burger with Guac and bacon on the menu.   Not something I'd normally order.  On an adventurous day I ordered it.... and am now in a rut because that's all I want to order."}
{"text":"We ordered lunch to go for a picnic and everything was accurate.  Found tasted great. Loved the variety."}
{"text":"I was in town for business.  I did my Yelp research, and my Beer Advocate research before getting into town.  The Tipsy Cow kept showing up high on every list.  Had to make it one of my limited stops while in town.    From all I had heard about their beer selection, honestly I was a bit disappointed.  There are a number of other spots within a very short walk with a much deeper selection.    The Tipsy Cow was also the youngest / college crowd / hipster type places of all I had stopped.  Not that there is anything wrong with that....  all depends on what you are looking for.  Monday night trivia - this i the place.  Great location, nice outdoor seating option, good beer selection, delicious curds."}
{"text":"The Tipsy Cow is a good bar with good bar food. I don't usually make this my destination but if I'm hopping around by the Capital it's in my Top 10.   +Good beer list, nice variety +Goat Cheese Curds, Alligator Bites, Juicy Burgers, Truffle Fries +Right next to like 6 other bars in case you are hopping around.  -They get busy sometimes and it gets packed -The food isn't free -I'm sad because I'm not there right now"}
{"text":"We had really high hopes for this joint- and the atmosphere/beer/service was good but the food we got was dripping. My husbands burger was swimming in a pool of grease an my smoked salmon grilled cheese was smothered in that fake butter flavored oily yuck. Went at 2pm on a Saturday after a big lunch rush so maybe we just times it poorly? We wanted to love it. Maybe next time"}
{"text":"Had the corn and avocado salad with crispy chicken and the pork sandwich.  Both were amazing. The service was very good and the outdoor tables perfect for a summer day."}
{"text":"I've only been here for a beer, so I can't speak to the quality of the food. The beer selection is good, with craft choices from Wisconsin and elsewhere. I had a Three Floyd's IPA from Illinois while killing sometime at the bar. Weekday happy hour offers $1.00 off draft beers. What I like best is the feng shui or feel of the place. The long classy old wooden bar reaches across the diagonal streets right across from the Capitol, and the restaurant is a cozy pie-shaped affair with street views. I have a thing for pie-shaped rooms.   Perusing the menu, one finds an extensive array of the \"usual suspect\" starters(chips, fries, dips, wings and curds), a few salads and soups, and a pretty extensive sandwich board. Items which caught my eye under starters: Truffle Fries and Korean BBQ fries, and sandwiches: Grilled Turkey and Havarti, Truffled Portabella Mushroom. The Housemade Pork Carnita Tacos are something I will need to come back for. There are also other Taco specials on Wednesdays and Thursdays, and of course the requisite Wisconsin Friday Fish Fry.  The Tipsy Cow is a great casual downtown pub with a cozy atmosphere and standard pub fare with a few unexpected items. A place to pop in for lunch or dinner when you're near the Capitol. Very friendly staff, too. Prices are just what you'd expect for this casual fare."}
{"text":"The path from the Local Tavern to King and Mane to now the Tipsy Cow has been worth the wait. Matthew, Sue, Michael, Patrick, Carl etc. and the rest are working hard to make this place great. Kudos to all the \"Tipsy Cow Crew\".  Great service,cold beer, well-made cocktails, well-prepared, tastefully executed dishes in a busy environment while recognizing regulars and new patrons is nothing short of amazing in this new concept. I will enjoy enjoy watching the success that is meant for this place that will always be my \"Local Tavern\". Thank you for all the work you do to make this local tavern named the Tipsy Cow a success at  King and Main!"}
{"text":"Very good food and drink. I was able to order a delicious gluten free beer, and also sit outside with my dog."}
{"text":"Stopped here for drinks one night!!! Great little place with an excellent drink menu and atmosphere.  We didn't have any food (probably should have)  but what we saw looked really great!  I will be goin back to try the food!!"}
{"text":"Greasy af burgers bruh  Onion rings are pretty darn good, as are the bartenders  Word to the wise: \"steak tacos\" are ground beef tacos  All in all a good burger and beer joint but not worth a detour"}
{"text":"Great beer selection,  and typical bar food. The only thing that was a not good was the seating outside we had a group of 6 but they sat us around a table for three."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner while I was in town for a basketball game.  This is a great place to grab a casual bite to eat.  It was totally packed when we were there and we had a bit of a wait, but the bar is easily accessible, and there are quite a few beer options to enjoy while you wait.  We chose the garlic fries and goat cheese curds as appetizers for the table.  Both were incredible.  The goat cheese curds are kind of rich so unless you are totally in love with goat cheese you are going to probably want to split these with someone.  I got a salad for dinner that I very much enjoyed.  The ingredients seemed super fresh, well above expectations for a burger joint.  My friends all enjoyed burgers, that they said were also delicious.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped by the Tipsy for some al fresco dining the other night and it was lovely. Last fall (or maybe two?) their tomato soup hooked me and I've stayed for their house turkey sandwich.   First, the soup: velvety, spicy, and served with a cheese curd. A lot of tomato soups seem to border on tomato juice, but this definitely doesn't taste like it came out of a can.   Second, the sandwich: tasty turkey, crisp greens, crispier bacon, and a delicious kick from the whole grain mustard. That spice is extra nice, especially because I upgrade my sandwich to include creamy avocado as well. I've got myself half ready to drive over right now just writing about this. I love a good sandwich.   Third, the curve ball: on this trip, my friends and I split the Korean BBQ fries that were featured as a special. The beef was incredibly tender, the fries themselves at once crispy and creamy, and the sauce just really pulled it together. I'll have to keep an eye out for them on the menu again because it was a nice out of the box treat I normally wouldn't think to order for myself."}
{"text":"There was a short wait and they take your cell phone to message you when your table is ready.  We waited outside for a little bit to get away from the crowd at the bar as it was cool outside but got pretty warm quickly inside.  The bar area is quite loud not necessarily from people talking but the surroundings and ceiling which echo the noise easily.  We were told we would be seated in one of the best places which ended up by the back window in the bar area.  It was just too loud for us as it was really hard for us to converse normally.  The cheese curds were ok as there were a couple of large pieces but most of them were very small.  The tipsy cow burger was good.  The buns couldn't hold up the burger patties or bacon but the taste was good.  My wife's salad was also good.  I was a little disappointed at the beer selection as there were so many IPAs with only 1 porter, 1 fruit beer, although there were nearly all local selections from Wisconsin, Minnesota, or Illinois.  Overall, a good place to hang out for a beer but maybe not if you are here for the gastropub portion."}
{"text":"I've been to the Tipsy Cow three times and every time the food has been great. The cheese curds are some of the best I've ever had, with a light breading and gooey cheese on the inside. They also have a variety of different specialty fries. My family and I got the garlic truffle fries and they were delicious. The Tipsy chicken sandwich is also delicious, with a surprisingly strong mustard that goes really well on the sandwich."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite summer places in Madison. Great outdoor seating for people watching and excellent greasefood. I'm finicky with my non-meat burgers--they're never done quite right--but TC does a wonderful job with their portabella mushroom burger. They actually do everything quite well, and I haven't heard of a lackluster option on their menu. Friends from out-of-state usually want to go to the Old Fashioned when in town, but I'm going to steer them here from now on."}
{"text":"Can I do 0 stars? Server didn't seem like he wanted to be here didn't know specials could barely coax a word out of him, and it was a ghost town. Reviews tell all, probably not worth ur hardearned  dollars. Granted his saving grace was he didn't charge us for the pops we ordered before we decided to leave. They were flat and terrible but good on him for doing the right thing."}
{"text":"I inadvertently came here on trivia night just before it started but was able to find a seat at the bar to grab a beer and some bar food.  Previous Yelp reviews raved about the gyro fries which I found to just be OK.  The cheese curds, however, were fantastic.  I had a great beer and would have liked to sit on the patio had it not been sprinkling.  The trivia looked like it would be fun if I was with a group next time!  I had to pay for my food with a credit card and my beer with cash and the bartender was not annoyed at all by my request which was a relief since it was so busy.  Overall this was a great bar experience and I'd definitely return for cheese curds and a beer (or two)."}
{"text":"Returned to Madison and hit Tipsy Cow and of course ordered the cheese curds again and they were terrific yet again.  Hubby and I shared some other stuff, too. He got wings in garlic parmesan and honey harissa flavors. The harissa was strong and distinctly flavored in a North African kind of way--an acquired taste but super good with blue cheese dressing (if you're wary). He also got the Korean beef fries and he was super happy. We split the walleye sandwich and the slaw on it (while heavy) was a great complement.  Tipsy Cow is a fantastic stop in Madison and I still recommend it wholeheartedly."}
{"text":"I'm torn on this one- the food was good, but the atmosphere/clientele/service, not so much. i'll say four stars for the food, two for the everything else.  three of us had dinner here last night. we put our names in for a table, were told the wait would be 30 minutes (not bad for a saturday), and were seated shortly at a table near the bar... right on top of not one, but two groups of completely wasted, obnoxious kids. hooray, maybe we'll get puked on!  so on top of the place being uncomfortably packed, it was hot and loud as hell. LOUD, like my throat hurts today from having to scream over the (mostly) shitty music they were blaring in order to have a conversation loud. this annoys me to no end. does anyone honestly enjoy that? is there a logical reason why establishments do this? ugh. I digress.  our waitress came immediately, which is cool, but she was pushy. she acted annoyed that we'd had a whole 5 seconds to peruse the menu and didn't know what we wanted to order. she gave us a minute and when she came back, we ordered our beers, sour cream fries and chili cheese fries. these came out quickly, but they were literally shoved onto our table by our rude ass waitress. (both kinds of fries were delicious, however.)   i ordered a tipsy burger for my meal, the bf had a 2x2, and our friend had the portabella sandwich. we were all happy with our food. my burger was a tad on the greasy side, but that didn't stop me from being a fatty and eating the whole thing.   overall, I wish that I could take the atmosphere/clientele/service from the local tavern and the food from the tipsy cow and bring the local tavern back from the dead. the food was decent, but I don't see myself hanging out here very often."}
{"text":"Delicious sweet-meets-sour old fashioned. Don Draper would be proud.  Also snagged the Friday night deal on $3 Hoppalicious. Any place where the Ale Asylum is flowing freely is the place for me."}
{"text":"Do not visit downtown Madison without eating at Tipsy Cow! Blue Cheese Bacon Fries are Devine! Good food and great service"}
{"text":"While the competition for newest and most trendy cuisine rages in various downtown Madison, several restaurants prefer to languish in the baser menu options that give Wisconsin it's identity.  One of these is The Tipsy Cow, which features burgers using the local Knoche's ground beef for a signature local taste that is getting wider recognition.  On my last outing, I tried the Tilapia sandwich, which at $7 turned out to be an outstanding value.  The fillet size was much larger and more flavorful than the last attempt I made at a different venue.  Sadly, the waitress forgot about my onion rings until the sandwich was consumed.  Under normal circumstances, I may have asked to waive the charge, but the sandwich was so good that I didn't care.  FYI- the onion rings practically have the thickness and fat content of donuts, so if you are watching your intake, consider yourself warned.  UPDATE-On a recent Friday night return visit, the place was packed, but I took a chance on the Fish Fry. One hour later, no food and I was outta there."}
{"text":"It was very empty during the day (it's a sports bar, so this is expected). We were warmly greeted by a friendly waitress as soon as we walked in. The menu has pretty limited selection, but they have curry and breakfast foods, along with the regular pub foods. Even though there were only two other tables, it took pretty long to get our food (about 30 minutes?). The appetizers came with our entrees at the same time too. Food was meh... I got the Sheppard's Pie. They drowned the pie in gravy, and the beef underneath was very salty. Expected for a sports bar I guess! Won't be coming back for their non-pub food."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite bar in Madison. Cozy atmosphere filled with some amazing souls and delicious food. Food is decently priced- $5-$15 as well as daily specials that can knock off a few bucks."}
{"text":"I stopped for a late lunch on a beautiful summer day and sat outside. The turkey sandwich with avocado was tasty, the fries were great and the service excellent. The price was decent as well."}
{"text":"Saw they had Alligator on the online menu and absolutely HAD to have it for a fried birthday treat. So I drove to Madison and walked 6 blocks during rush hour to get it. No regrets, it was delicious. The spiciness was perfect (any more and it would be painful), the sauce was delicious, and so crispy. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!  Came here with my family while visiting Madison and boy was it delicious. The restaurant itself is located beautifully in the heart of Madtown and parking is very convenient either in a nearby lot or on the street. It has a bar and tables and is an excellent places to chill with friends, grab some drinks, or get lunch with the family.   We got a lot of things off the menu. The cheese curds are comparable to AJ Bomber's, the gyro fries are really really good, and the fish taco was excellent. Our main entrees including a grilled cheese with bacon, chicken burger, and other burgers were all top-notch, had amazing flavor, and the quality was above and beyond. I highly recommend anything mentioned above. They also have an extensive menu of local, domestic, and import beers so that's awesome too!  Our waitress was also super sweet and kind and we felt at home and very comfortable during our meal. Props to them. Overall, 10/10 would recommend. Great food, great vibes."}
{"text":"I took the better half for lunch and really enjoyed it.  I started off with the three bean beef chili which was incredible. A very hearty soup full of meat. For my meal I had the turkey sandwich. It was absolutely delicious. The sandwich comes with freshly roasted turkey, nueske's bacon, and a spicy mustard sauce. The girlfriend had a slightly different turkey sandwich with soft cheese on it. This place is a must try for lunch."}
{"text":"Someone I know was hungover and all they wanted was a grilled cheese. This place is the spot! Best grilled cheese I have ever had, hands down. It is easy to make simple items good. It is harder to make simple items excellent. The buffalo wings are exceptional as well. It was less expensive than I remember too. Still really loud in the bar area."}
{"text":"The thing about this place is my friends always want to go here, and I'm not sure why other than location. Service tends to be sub par at times. Beer was warm for my liking yet good selection."}
{"text":"They have the most amazing goat cheese curds. Great beer selection that changes frequently. Wait staff was very attentive even though they were extremely busy. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Delicious, flavorful, and creative (for the type of place this is... this is a beer and burger type joint) food that uses a lot of local products, such as Usinger's sausages, Knoche's Market beef, Clasen's bread, etc. I have never been disappointed with any of the dishes we've had here.   We are fried food afficionados, and Tipsy Cow has some of the best fried stuff in town. The cheese curds were large and just had a little more character than your usual cheese curd from its Spotted Cow beer batter and seasoning. The various types of fries--we go for either the regular, truffle, or chili cheese--are delicious, too, though they can be a bit on the greasy side. I also don't mind when my kids don't finish their meals: it means I can finish off their crispy chicken fritters, again with a delicious batter and real moist chicken (at one point they had corn dogs, which blew out of the water any other corn dog I had ever had).    And then, of course, their burgers are great. At first glance, you might think that you're getting ripped off from the size of the burgers, but they have so much flavor (and, admittedly, grease) from the local ingredients that we often found ourselves satiated after scarfing our food down. The Tipsy Burger is good, but we much prefer the Bacon Guacamole Cheeseburger, which I don't believe is on the menu but is a regular special (I think?)  It's a delicious combination of different textures and flavors. I also highly recommend the grilled cheese if you want something \"lighter\".  I've tried Tipsy Cow several times and though the service isn't mind-blowingly amazing, I never really had any major qualms with my servers. The noise level can be a little overbearing, too, but the food is so good AND they pay homage to Monty Python and the Holy Grail with a chalk panorama of the cow scene. Bonus."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch in a party of 4, and had a Cobb salad and a soft drink. Our food was out quickly and the salad was a good size and exactly what I ordered (nothing too exciting). Our waitress was polite and refilled drinks as needed. Oh -- and outdoor seating, which is nice."}
{"text":"If you're looking for amazing bar food with a Wisconsin flair but don't want to wait in line at the Old Fashioned, look no further!  Their cheese curds are all delicious (regular, goat cheese or buffalo). Their burger is AMAZING - probably the best I've tried in Madison. Overall a great place to grab a quick bite of awesome food or drink some Wisconsin beer without the hassle of the other Capitol square spots."}
{"text":"Service: Spot on for how busy it was-my glass was never empty and we were seated IMMEDIATELY which we did not expect based on the line out the door. Our food came fast at a lunch rush and our waitress was very helpful explaining what was popular on the menu.   Atmosphere: Weird little layout, but very homey, a place you want to keep drinking and eating for an extended period of time; you will want to come back.  Food: THE BEST CHEESECURDS EVERRRR. EVER. I am a cheese curd fanatic (who isn't from the state of WI), and I have never wanted to shove cheese into my mouth as quickly as I did last summer with my boyfriend when we stopped in here. The breading is so light, you really get to appreciate the flavor and texture of the cheese. We ordered both kinds, the goat cheese and the regular. I would order those goat cheese curds every day and dedicate my waistband size to sweatpants if I lived in Madison. The bloody mary was spot on-I could eat a whole jar of their homemade pickles. The grilled cheese with bacon was crispy on the outside and ooey-gooey on the inside, just like I like it.  Whenever I find out a friend or relative is heading in this direction I always recommend this fantastic establishment. I should have wrote this review sooner to give my praises."}
{"text":"Some carb loading before the Ironman 70.3 on June 11. Walking distance from the Hilton Madison. Very pleased - had read other Yelp reviews.  Comfortable seating at a high top by the bar. When you put bread/cheese/egg/asparagus all together, you're going to get a clean plate. Fortunately, I snapped a pic of this excellent lunch before I devoured all of it.   Seriously  and only $7 or $9 I think. In DC where I live, that would have been priced at $15...really.   YUM!"}
{"text":"COST: $3 (Jamison Shot) $5-10 (Variety of beer)  I was going to say it was pretty non descript but with the name like that, fancy neon light and how it's dead smack in one of the Capitol Square's corner, it hits you in the face and for good reason.  Pretty nice bar, obviously poppin on a Friday night. I didn't get to try their food but for the service and the decor, they get four stars."}
{"text":"A friend recommended coming here for dinner, and I agreed. This isn't too bad of a joint. It's homey with a friendly waitress. We went on a Tuesday, and there was trivia going on. We didn't stay too late and left before trivia really began, so I did not really get to hear the kinds of questions being asked. We sat at a side table against the wall but across from the bar - a good people watching spot.  Frankly it's hard to mess up a grilled cheese and fries, but they were pretty good. I love the use of local cheese! My friend ordered the cheese curds for us, and they were pretty good. They were salty enough but didn't make your teeth squeak. I still think the Old Fashioned has the best cheese curds because they're crunchier but lighter there. This is a reason why I gave this place three stars. I would return again though!  Grilled cheese with bacon $6.50 Large fry $2.00 Tax $0.56"}
{"text":"Truffle fries and cheese curds are enough delicious oily food to make your heart stop. Round it out with a beer and a guacamole bacon burger (or whatever burger you have on special) and spend your afternoon half way between blissful food coma and full on heartburn!   The kielbasa is not bad either. Overall, I would come back a few times!!"}
{"text":"Tipsy Cow offers a great bar environment to enjoy beers and food while having a great conversations with friends. Not sure if the winter day plays a big role, but I went with a couple of friends and was able to listen to each other's stories. I feel such place is difficult to find in bars near the area.  Pro: - Great place to hangout with friends and actually have a conversation - Decent selection of beers - Amazing cheese curds and onion rings  Con: - N/A  Their cheese curds might be one of the unsung dairy delights in Madison. The batter is crispy, while the cheese is gooey enough to not be messy. The curd itself is not too overwhelming, and does not always need the dipping sauce to make it taste amazing.   They also have one of the best onion rings in town. The batter is crispy and flavorful, and the onion maintains its integrity throughout. When was the last time you are able to cut through an onion ring and manage to have a clean cut? We ordered a half-size and got 3 jumbo-sized rings. Definitely something worth wondering if you want to have a taste without worrying of getting too full.  I ordered Tequila Chicken Sandwich for my entree. They are tasty and have decent flavor. It is something I would eat again next time I return. The beer selections are quite extensive to make  me come back and explore more."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place more but with so many good burger/sandwich/beer options in the area it's hard. Service is spotty-some times it's great, sometimes the bartenders treat you as though they are doing you a favor by pouring you a beer."}
{"text":"When I first read the reviews to this place, what I understood was: excellent food, terrible service.  I took the advice of ordering the Tispy burger and cheese curds and I was NOT disappointed! This is the best burger I've ever had (although I have yet to try out the other popular burger joints in Madison). The cheese curds too - the breading is soft and light - more cheese than breading which is always a plus.  I don't know if the reviews about bad service were just out of date - but I've never had a bad experience at the Tipsy Cow. The servers are very attentive and I've never had to wait more than 10 minutes for my food. The only time this doesn't apply is if you're sitting outside. If you're on the patio, expect more of a wait.  Overall, one of my favorite places to grab a burger and beer. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for dinner after Concerts on the Square on Wednesday night. Ran into some good friends who had just eaten there and they assured us that it was very good.  The extensive menu sounded very promising... Many different appetizers, including Cajun alligator bites. We ordered the cheese curds, which a friend has since told me are actually goat cheese curds. They were very good, and probably my favorite part of the meal.   So... I ordered off the specials menu, a Cuban sandwich. My first warning sign should have been that they serve it on honey wheat bread. An odd choice for such a traditional sandwich. Our very pleasant and efficient waitress was happy to oblige with the more traditional grilled bun. When it arrived it looked very good.  Unfortunately, looks are where the goodness ended. It was filled with very dry and odd tasting and weirdly textured shaved pork. I love pork and this did not taste like pork, hard to say exactly what it tasted like but it wasn't good. I tried to salvage the meal by taking that off the sandwich. The shaved ham was fine, very tasty, the Havarti cheese was also fine, as well as the yellow mustard and grilled bun.  The death knell for this sandwich was the unfortunate addition of sweet pickles. On a Cuban sandwich? Whaaaaa....? The menu proudly calls them Mike's pickles, and apparently they are a feature here in many dishes. Even the deep fried battered pickles are apparently made from these sweet pickles according to the menu, so be warned. Some things are just wrong. So, so wrong.  The turkey avocado sandwich was pretty stellar, a fellow diner said. The beer list, ambience, location and service are all impeccable. So they get three stars for now, pending future visits.  But please, no more Mike's pickles. (Sorry, Mike. Let's just be friends.)"}
{"text":"The Cheese curds!   The Blue Cheese and Bacon Fries!!   The Korean BBQ Fries!! The BEET SALAD!  Amazing little place near the Capital.  The place is a little snug, but the food is exceptionally worth it!!  I love sitting at the bar and taking a gander at all the brews they offer and snacking on some good eats.  If you're looking for something with a little twist on Wisconsin eats, this is your place.  Reasonable prices, fast service, cold beer, good burgers!"}
{"text":"Expect to wait if you go during a busy time. Their outdoor seating practically doubles their available tables, so try to go on a nicer day and you'll probably increase your chances of getting a table quicker. Then again, it'd probably be busier as well, so good luck!  That said, wait for a table. This is one of those restaurants where if the host says it will be a 45 minute wait you should gladly do so!  Tip: Sandwiches come a la carte. Sides can be ordered (such as their delicious Ale Asylum cheese curds or their sour cream and chive fries) in a 'family size' or individual. Smart money is on the family size for about $2-3 more to get a bigger portion and share with the table.  Everyone I was with absolutely loved their sandwiches. Fresh ingredients, amazing seasoning on everything, delicious appetizers, and best of all this place has drink specials on the weekend if you're going for a later dinner. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Best cheese curds. Love the spotted cow beer! My husband ordered the Bloody Mary with a spotted cow chaser. Delicious.  My brother and his wife had the burgers- good as always. I tried the asparagus and egg sandwich. It come open faces with melted asiago cheese. I got the aioli on the side and the egg over medium. Delicious !  Next time I would ask for no parmesan. Will be back!  Great variety of beer."}
{"text":"Tipsy Cow is frequent choice of mine for delicious food and great beer. The Korean beef fries and juicy burgers will not disappoint! The beer selection varies, but there's always a few IPAs to choose from which is always a plus. The salmon grilled cheese is often on special and I cannot get enough of it.   Last night we received text alerts for a table, which I believe is newer and quite helpful. We were quickly offered a table by the restrooms, but opted to sit at the bar instead.   The wait staff is not always on their game, but they also seem to change quite a bit so it's often newer employees. The bartenders are attentive and friendly, and we've noticed the food tends to come faster. Last night we received a few tastes of new drafts which is always a plus. Unfortunately their specific brew \"Fugly Duckling\" was a little too pungent for us - but to each their own.  While the wait staff performance depends on the day and time, we've never had too much trouble. If you're happy to sit at the bar, it's my favorite part of the restaurant by far. And the food cannot be beat."}
{"text":"It is overused on Yelp!  We have all said it, and today I am going to say it again....  The Tipsy Burger may be the\" best burger I have ever eaten\".  Buy this time I mean it!    The Tipsy burger is a classic double, with 2 strips of top notch bacon, 2 different types of cheese (including 3 year old Wisconsin Cheddar!) along with \"Tipsy Sauce\" which I believe is souped up thousand island dressing.    My mouth is still watering thinking about how good this burger is!  You have to try it.  We also ordered a 1/2 side of Onion Rings and a 1/2 side of Goat Cheese Curds.  I liked the Goat Curds a lot.  (Another must try!) the onion rings where good, but were very bready.  Some people might love their rings like this, I tend to like the thinner variety.  I was also please with the prices.  The Tipsy Burger was $8 and I really like that you could order 1/2 sides for half price.    Oh yeah..  also tried the Kentucky Pumpkin Beer.  I thought it sucked!  But I hate almost all craft beers so please don't put much into my review of any beer!        To be completely honest I really should have taken a point off for the service.  We ate outside and it took forever to get refills and our bill.  BUT the food was so good it was worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Bar food al fresco  Returning home from vacation to an empty refrigerator, we decided to journey downtown to enjoy the some al fresco dining.  After finding several kid-friendly options on the menu, the Tipsy Cow became our dining destination.    Things I liked: * Gotta start with those cheese curds.  They came out piping hot, lightly breaded and not overly greasy.  I only wish there was another option rather than the very pedestrian ranch dressing that accompanied them.  They deserve better. * The chicken salad really exceeded expectations.  The chicken was plentiful, moist and well-seasoned.  Crunchy tortilla strips added texture and strips of orange added a little brightness to the dish.  The cilantro-based dressing complemented the dish well and became the preferred landing spot for the cheese curds as the meal progressed. * The grilled cheese on the kid's menu was a step above average based on a small nibble my daughter let me have.  The way my daughter defended the sandwich from my repeated attempts to sample it tells me she enjoyed it as well.   * The outdoor seating area is outstanding.  The tables are densely packed, but view of the square on a warm summer evening can't be beat.  Things I didn't: * I wasn't blown away by the Tipsy burger.  It came out a little dry and the tipsy sauce caused the bottom half of the bun to turn to goo.  I appreciated that I could get fried onions on the burgers, but they were not cooked long enough to get any good caramelization.  While I enjoyed the Neuske's bacon, I needed to tear the two pieces in half so they would fit inside the bun. * We had to wait inside the bar while an outdoor table opened up and it was LOUD, even at 7pm.  I'm so glad we were able to get a table outside. * I probably had a better chance of seeing the Loch Ness Monster in Lake Monona than my server once I received the food.  My plans for getting more of the cilantro dressing for the cheese curds were foiled by a wait staff that could not keep up with a Tuesday night crowd.  I shudder to think what things are like on a busy Friday night.  Despite the service issues, I plan to return during the months where I can enjoy the outdoors seating area.  The Thursday special of PBR battered fish tacos looks especially enticing."}
{"text":"Definitely coming back to The Tipsy Cow.  Service  was slow but the food made up for it. We went on a Tuesday so it was a buy one get one half off for the 1x1 cheeseburgers. Finding out from Yelp that you can order half an appetizer was a godsend, allowing us to try both the alligator and the cheese curds for a total of $20 for a dinner, including tip.  The burgers are a little greasy but still good. The cheese curds are good and the ranch that accompanies it is even better.   AND THE ALLIGATOR. My friend and I were super stoked to try alligator and we weren't disappointed. The texture was kind of like chicken but with a slightly flakier texture, which I was not expecting since I had heard alligator to be kind of tough.  The outer breading of the alligator was this perfectly crunchy coating, similar to what you would find on really great fried chicken. The sauce was delicious as well.  I honestly can't wait to check out this place soon for trivia and try some more of their appetizers with friends just because there are so many enticing things on there. GO GO GO GO GO TO THE TIPSY COW!!"}
{"text":"Good food. Nice place. Good beer. Goat cheese curds. Spotted cow. Lots of cows, everywhere. More cows than people. Cows in the corner, on the wall... always watching, always knowing..."}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend and a friend from college I haven't seen in years. It was a great place to grab a few drinks and dinner. Better yet we were able to sit outside. We got the goat cheese cheese curds, I got the special of the day which were Korean beef tacos, boyfriend got the tipsy burger, and my friend got the lox sandwich. Everything was delicious! Great beer selection. This is a great stop. Coming again for sure!"}
{"text":"Where do I even begin?! After waiting almost an hour to be seated, we were told by the bartender who said he was manager named Patrick that we would then have to wait for our drinks because he was just too busy to help us and on top of  that didn't bother to ask the other 2 bartenders tbat were standing around on their phones. Once we finally did get seated and since we couldnt even get drinks while waiting for a table.....3 different severs that we tried stopping for service of any sorta and they all kept telling us that sorry but they aren't out servers....not \"oh I'm sorry do you know who your sever is or what she looks like so I can maybe get her attention, or Maybe I could help you....we just kept being pawned off to other employees.... finally we said enough is enough and we told the bartender we have been waiting such and such time, and he said and I quote \" what would you like me to do about?\" Me and my family turned around and will never be back! Worst service iv ever had!"}
{"text":"This place is so good I ended up going twice in one day.  For lunch I had the thin and crispy burger.  Very flavorful and so delicous.  For dinner I tried their fried walleye sandwich and a half order of onion rings.  Amazing. The onion rings are probably the best I've ever had easily.  The walleye was perfect.  Can't go wrong with either choice."}
{"text":"Last minute decision to check this place out for a lunch spot and it.was.perfect. Great atmosphere and delish food options and lots of great beer choices for the hubs. The waitress told us they do outdoor seating in the summer, which must be awesome because of the corner they are on!  I can highly recommend the items below that our table tried: Cheese curds Korean BBQ fries * amazing flavor, so much food Steak sandwich (special of the day) Steak tacos Tipsy burger * I wish I had gotten this!   This will be a repeat on our next visit to Madison!"}
{"text":"Came for an early evening appetizer and a drink with friends.  Easily accommodated a party of 10 in the outside patio area.  Great server.  Fun atmosphere.  Great location actually."}
{"text":"We sat outside on a Sat. afternoon. Service was pretty mediocre. (Slow, had to ask for what we needed including waters, and milk/cream for the coffee)  Food was fine, nothing special. Loved the pickles on the plate, though!"}
{"text":"Used to love going here for lunch as it was close to work and had a good selection. The last time we were there 2 co-workers and I sat at the bar, and during the course of lunch had not one, but two cockroaches crawl across the bar in front of us. Not only will we never be back, we also made sure to let the rest of our co-workers know about our experience. Sad, as it was a really convenient location for us."}
{"text":"Waited 50 mins for a table... Several parties we're taken before us, the host was very rude and switched seat order  several times. My name was on the top of the list and then moves down a few minutes later. Walked out and then received a text our table was ready. Went down the street to another restaurant which accommodated us very quickly."}
{"text":"Went to satisfy a burger craving that I hadn't been able to shake with your typical fast food variety. The tipsy burger was just what I needed and I could tell that the ingredients that went into this meat sandwich were top notch and well thought out (loved the cheese). Being able to pick from any of their expansive variety of side options (half order) put this meal over the top for me (truffle fries for me and sour cream and onion for the wife) both great. Definitely want to try more from this establishment."}
{"text":"This review is for Tierney.  (I hope that's right. It's what my receipt says.) I don't usually single out servers, but she was so incredible (as was the awesome hostess on Monday night) that I feel like I need to mention her by name.   Our group of yelpy trivia players this past Monday grew from 4 to 5 to 7 to 9 to 12 over the course of an hour or so, and each time we needed to add more seats and swap people about, she knew exactly where people were and what they ordered. With each arrival she brought a menu, ran through the food specials time and time again (poor thing... it's fries and wings y'all... half off... every Monday... now you know) and made sure that pints were full of Yelp's Bursting Red Ale and that we felt tended to.   Tipsy Trivia is one of my favorites in town, simply because almost everyone who's there on Monday plays. I have to imagine the servers aren't as excited about it as I am. Cheap fries, cheap wings, growing party sizes... it's probably a server nightmare. But ours was a breath of fresh air and for pub grub and beer, it was probably some of the best service I've received in Madison.   As for the food, it's what you'd expect. I've always felt the burgers are a little over cooked, but you can stack 'em high, so that's a plus. Parmesan wings were a touch overwhelming, but the standard and the Asian glazed made mouths happy. And rotating taps keep things interesting, and it was exciting to see some \"locals\" (midwest but not Madison) that I had never heard of."}
{"text":"Spotted cow on tap which was great and the cheese curds were tasty, although I've had better. Service sucked. 5pm happy hour on a weekday and 1 guy tending bar. Very slow service."}
{"text":"Basic pub fare. Good service with warm and friendly waitstaff. Had the beet salad, tasty. Burgers looked good. My friend ordered it rare but it came medium, still juicy.  No wait on a Saturday 7 pm.  Good beer selection."}
{"text":"This is a classic Wisconsin restaurant with some great alternative options for those looking to try something new (aka the alligator bites). The staff was a bit reserved but were always helpful when needed. The cheese curds hit the spot and made the trip worth it. We paired our dinner with a couple beers that truly hit the spot. This restaurant also offers great lunch specials."}
{"text":"Good drinks and good bar food! Nothing is gonna blow you away but you'll never be disappointed! The PBR fish tacos on Thursday are very good tho"}
{"text":"My friends and I ended up here after checking another nearby restaurant which had a long wait (not surprising on a Saturday night).  Added to that the other restaurant was too loud for extended conversation.  Despite the heat we took the risk of sitting outside at the Tipsy Cow as the bar area where they had seating was also noisy.  It worked out well as it was starting to cool and there was a nice breeze.   We had a very friendly server who gave us space to chat and consider our orders.  He was also very attentive to our water glass levels throughout our stay which was essential on a hot evening.  They had a lot of different food and drink specials which all sounded good.  There were three of us and we  decided to each get a different taco dish which we then shared so that we each had one of each kind.  They were all delicious and we were happy with our sharing idea.  We would have lingered except that dark clouds were rolling in and rain seemed imminent.  I will be back should I find myself downtown hungry and/or thirsty!"}
{"text":"First off, this isn't a restaurant it's a pub. This is not a sit-down place. It's not for families or conversation as it was screaming loud there as well.   The majority of it is a high top bar that stretches through the center. It smells weird af in there and I assume it's cigarette smoke on the clothes and people smoke right outside the door. Ok cool... But shouldn't it smell like food? No? Ok my bad.  Swear to god I thought host was on coke. He was bug-eyed, talked fast without a purpose and really jumpy. I could see why you'd want to be on it in that place though. I had questions about the menu, none of which he could answer like... idk prices and portion size. The burgers don't come with fries. Everything is separate. EVERYTHING.   I asked the host what their fries looked like \"steak, crinkle-cut, or shoe string\". He just stared at me and danced around all jittery said he didn't know. I said \"you know like fast food style or what?\" He said \"like normal fries\" and explained they looked like \"pens\". Ooookay... So shoestring. Fast food style. Got it. And he didn't know how much they were - like he had never been asked that...  Needless to say, I left.  No thank you."}
{"text":"I had one of the best beers ever! And they let you taste a sample. My wife and I were in search of something quick, yet good. We were visiting Madison to celebrate her birthday. Someone from our hotel recommended this place.   I have to say that the burgers we ordered were off the chain! I had the lamb burger with a order of cheese curds. My wife had the chicken sandwich with truffle fries. Delicious!   For the price and atmosphere, I would say it is well worth the visit. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Find me a burger that tops the Tipsy Burger. Jk - you can't.   Not a light meal at all, but if you're looking for a burger to end all burgers (complete with grease running down to your elbows), you've found the place. A good quality patty, topped with some stellar cheese, onions, bacon and the special tipsy sauce...you've got it made.   Had several entrees here besides the Tipsy Burger - all of which have been great. The sides come separate, but are equally delicious. Truffles fries, bacon and blue cheese fries or cheese curds are a few of my favorites.   Definitely worth a stop on your next visit to downtown Madison."}
{"text":"The hostess was rude. I waited for over 5 mins for a drink. I don't get the hype about this place."}
{"text":"I haven't really had a chance to try their food, but the few items I have tried are great. I really adore their French fries, cheese curds, and onion rings.   But The Tipsy Cow is where my friends and I like to go on a Friday or Saturday nights for our first few rounds of drinks. With $3 Jameson shots, $3 Bacardi mixers, and $3 captain Morgan mixers, it's a great way to get buzzed without breaking the bank!   The bartenders are great and attentive. They know how to make the drinks strong enough to taste the alcohol but being still able to enjoy the drinks.   The Tipsy cow is also just a cute, little dark restaurant and bar with a nice, underground feel to it. It's one of those places that gets you hooked after one time being there."}
{"text":"Great place and atmosphere.  Fries were awesome, wish the chicken sandwich was better and bigger."}
{"text":"I love this place. For someone who strongly dislikes busy, overcrowded, loud restaurants... I don't mind it here at all.  For some reason, the hectic atmosphere just doesn't bother me. It's fun and the interior is so cool. The food is amazing and the service is always great. I love taking people here from out of town. It's not a typical \"go to\" for tourists and for out of town guests but it should be!  No matter how busy it's been, we always get great service and amazing food. If you want some greasy bar food that's actually delicious and made well - this is the place to go. It's also just super fun and the location is SO convenient for lots of different activities you could be doing downtown.  Come here! Bring your friends! Order food and drinks! Stay and have a great time. I've never been disappointed after hanging out here whether it be for a meal with family or getting questionably inebriated with my friends. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This really should get a higher rating because the food here is really good and beer is always fresh, cold and good but the bartenders are atrocious! I have never had  such bad service from a bartender in my life. Come here for the good food and better beer but be ready to be treated with indifference and inattentiveness."}
{"text":"We ate here for the first time today and loved it! Great atmosphere (though today was pretty crowded due to Crazylegs and the Farmer's Market) and great food! We tried the fried goat cheese curds (yes, GOAT cheese curds!) and they were every bit as delicious as they sound.  Maybe more. I had the portabella mushroom sandwich (which was delicious) and my husband had a burger with guacamole and jalepenos which he said was awesome, and an order of fries (decent, but nothing special). The food prices were very reasonable, too. We left feeling very full.  Probably too full for our own good, but it was totally worth it. I'd do it again. Eventually.  Maybe in a week or so when I'm finally hungry again after today....  We were seated by the window and with everything going on today, the people watching was AMAZING!  I would love to go back in the evening for drinks and hang out for a bit.   The only issue I had is that their restrooms are just single stall. So on a day like today when it was really crowded, there was a long line to use the restroom.  Middle of the day, everyone was fairly patient and all, but I could see how at night when lots of people are drinking, this could be an issue."}
{"text":"Great food, unique combinations & based on the location, you would expect higher prices!"}
{"text":"Nice little bar that keeps a simple menu of burgers and basic apps turned up with a little Wisconsin flare (spotted cow beer battered fries and cheese curds). This place keeps a younger to middle aged crowd that is comfortable and fun. Wednesday was $3 New Glarus products which paired well with my \"Tipsy Burger\". For such a small place the food had good presentation and flavor. What I like most about this location is they know who they are, they own it and they don't try to be something they aren't."}
{"text":"Cute corner spot, we came here on a Friday night for some dinner.  We picked a table for 4, and we're told that the wait was about 45 minutes. They ended up calling us 5 minutes later saying our table was ready. I decided to order an average burger, everything was decent but the cheese curds were super crispy on the outside and gooey on the inside, definitely my favorite ones of all the cheese curds we had over our weekend in Madison!"}
{"text":"3.5 -  I came to the Tipsy Cow for trivia! Our group shared some buffalo wings, which were deliciously hot. We also had several pitchers of Spotted Cow, which were $10 - That made me very happy! It was a great spot for a medium-large group, and the trivia was really fun.  The service was a bit slow, but it was also packed AND trivia was going on at the same time. Considering all that, I think the servers did a great job. There wasn't really a point we had to flag down our server. The women's restroom was out of service, causing some confusion at the men's single-stall, with men and women in line - Hopefully that will be fixed next time!  I want to try a burger here and explore more of their draft beer options.  I'd also be interested to see the atmosphere on a non-trivia night. Nice first experience!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice and am still very impressed by this place. The menu has a great variety and everything I've tried is very tasty. Some of the best cheese curds around. I've also heard great things about the Korean fries. They have both indoor and outdoor seating which is a plus and the prices are reasonable.   My only complaint is the service. Both times they have been very sub-par. When it's 80 degrees and I'm sitting outside, I should not have to ask for a refill on water, especially when the server has been out to us once or twice already. Very slow, very unhelpful, and overall awkward service. Maybe she was new?   Despite that, I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great cheese curds and great service! They have a good selection of beers as well. The other food is pretty good, but not the best in the area."}
{"text":"My husband and I brought some friends from out of town for Trivia Night and fried cheese curds! The fried cheese curds delivered....they are small bites of heaven.  However, it was a little annoying because they advertised trivia on the website and had a huge sign by their front door that said trivia tonight! but when we arrived the hostess said there wasn't any because of the Packers game.  It's a pretty good excuse isn't it?  Other than the cheese curds, my meal was pretty horrible.  I ordered a salad with chicken and it was something I could have made at home for 49 cents....and the chicken was what I call \"Subway chicken\" and was the equivalent of what you get on a Subway sandwich, which is basically \"meat product.\" My friends seemed overall pleased with their meals but I couldn't eat mine."}
{"text":"I have been here twice for lunch. Both times the service was extremely slow. There was no way that you could eat here if you just have an hour for lunch. On both occasions my food arrived and was not that hot. I ordered the Guinness pot pie the first time and the chicken club the second time.  I would say both of these meals were OK. I have not been here in the evening so perhaps it is different?"}
{"text":"Has a great selection of beers on tap. We sat outside which was really nice. They have a good amount of seating outside.   Great, extensive beer menus with lots of craft, good beer."}
{"text":"After my previous visit at Tipsy Cow some time ago the owner Michael was kind enough to reach out with his apologies for my poor experience and offered me a $30 gift certificate.  I accepted and shared my thoughts with him regarding the experience, etc. I had the gift certificate in my possession shortly after.  I didn't however have a place to venture back until this past week; interesting considering I live 2 blocks away.  We were seated immediately although it was a busy time of day.  My friend and I each had 2 beers and split the zucchini coins with Tipsy sauce.  I had the reuben and she had the buffalo chicken sandwich.  I'd like to add that this is a different friend then the original experience and she has a higher tolerance for spice.  As usual the food was fine.  It met the need of greasy food and a beer to wash it down.  Our server was much better but moderate energy.  The service, etc certainly redeemed itself in comparison to last time  but I am still on the fence regarding any sort of regular patronage.  I do greatly appreciate being reached out to and being made to feel like my experience is important and valued.  Thank you Michael"}
{"text":"I really love the Tipsy Cow!  It is the best place to get a bloody mary after visiting the farmers market on a Saturday morning.  Make sure to have bartender Ben make it for you! Their menu is great and they always have some intriguing appetizers.   Last time out we enjoyed the bacon & bleu cheese fries with our bloodies.  The Tipsy Cow is alwasys a treat!"}
{"text":"Had a very tasty lunch here.  Top notch pork sandwich on delicious high quality bread with crispy bacon.  Enjoyed a very good order of cheese curds for an appetizer.  Companion had a chicken salad with avocados which was reported to be good.  Would definetly return."}
{"text":"No halves about it--solid four stars. Lengthy tap list. Host was a bit short but perhaps just not a Midwesterner!  Service in outside patio was swift and attentive. The pork tacos--good quality meat and flour tortillas. Truffle fries were well spiced but a bit too oily. Tipsy marg was refreshingly limey and tall. Condiments on table stored in well-worn, grungy cardboard 6-pack cartons. Nothing jumped out for dessert so a search elsewhere ensued..."}
{"text":"Lots of artery clogging food (which can be a good thing or a bad thing depending on how you're feeling that day) and beer!  In my experience, the food is good but not remarkable, and centered on fried stuff (cheese curds, fries) and burgers.  One thing to keep in mind when looking at prices is that the sandwiches don't include sides.   Daily food and drink specials are also listed on the menu.  The ambiance includes 2 separate areas--an area that is all tables and another area which is more bar-like with seating at hte bar and some high tops.    My most recent visit was marred by a curdled drink.  A friend ordered a Bailey's with coffee.  Three of us tasted the drink and it was clearly off, perhaps curdled or otherwise spoiled.  For about 15 or so minutes we desperately tried to catch the eye of our server but failed. Friend returned drink to the bar and they re-made it and it was fine.  In short, Tipsy Cow works but I don't feel a pressing need to go out of my way to return."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places for fatty delicious bar food, so if that's what you're looking for, this is the spot! I have been about five times. The truffle fries and the goat cheese curds are must-have appetizers. I don't know of another place that offers goat cheese curds, which are a nice change from your usual (also delicious) curds. They always have some good beers on tap, too. This most recent time, I ordered a cheeseburger, and it was so good I had to write a review. Juicy patty clearly made by hand with cheddar cheese instead of American, grilled onions and some great pickle slices (thick, not too sweet or sour) for $6. It was the best burger I've had in Madison or in recent memory. The service is fine, usually not memorable. My most recent batch of truffle fries was not very truffle-y, so I asked the server about it and she took them back to have more truffle oil added, and then they were perfect."}
{"text":"Very good food. Sandwiches and accompaniments were great, cheese curds are some of the best in town. Staff could be a bit friendlier but otherwise service was good."}
{"text":"Trivia is an absolute blast here on Monday evenings.   They also have a super awesome cheese burger. The cheddar on it is to die for.   It's a great place to go with friends."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch and was a little disappointed (but let me preface by saying that I probably should have just gone to a restaurant and not a bar). I ordered the cheese curds and the salmon grilled cheese, and neither were as tasty as I was hoping.   The cheese curds were more breading than cheese, which was a let down since I'm visiting Wisconsin and therefore want the best cheese curds I've ever had. I went to the Old Fashioned last night and much prefer their cheese curds.   The salmon grilled cheese was just kind of meh - greasy and the flavor was a little harsh.   Service was fine and the vibe was cool. Don't get me wrong, nothing was actually bad about the food - I think my expectations were just high for a place that is clearly a bar first. I'd likely return for a beer or two."}
{"text":"I want to like Tipsy Cow more.  The location is great.  The few times I've been in, the crowd seems fun and the taplist is usuall solid.    But... well, this past Saturday afternoon, I stop in and ask the barkeep for a beer that's on the chalkboard tap list. The following conversation ensued...  barkeep: \"Oh, we're out of that.\"  OK, I order a different beer.  barkeep: \"Oh, that's gone, too.\"  So... what else is out of date on the tap list?  barkeep: \"Oh, everything else is up to date.\"  OK, and what do you have on tap that isn't on the list?  barkeep: *blank stare* ... OK, I don't see Three Floyd's on the chalkboard, but there's a three floyd's tap. what 3F are you serving?  barkeep: \"Uh it's an IPA\"   ... I wait, since 3F has a bunch of different IPA/IIPA/DIPAs... barkeep:  \"IPA means India Pale Ale\" Thanks for mansplaining IPA to me in a completely non-helpful way. (If I didn't know what an IPA was, why would india pale ale help? come on.) And thanks for refusing to check the keg when I asked.    I usually try to visit a place a few times, and try to not let a single experience sour me, but it was a Saturday afternoon with very few customers. The bartender should know what beers are available, and telling me he didn't need to check the keg because it's an IPA is not helpful.  Having an out of date tap list is worse than not having a list at all, and the combination of the two was very frustrating.    I won't be going back to Tipsy Cow for a while, but hopefully they can work on improving the mediocre service."}
{"text":"Delicious burger and great beer selection! Visiting Madison from AZ and were glad we stopped in for a bite!"}
{"text":"I can dig it.  We ended up coming here after waiting several minutes for a table at Graze that never came and seeing plenty of open booths and tables from the host table. Not about that waiting life. A quick yelp search and we found The Tipsy Cow as an alternative. Upon entering, we were seated promptly at a high top table near the bar. Outside patio was open when we had visited, but we were looking to cool down and catch some AC.  Pretty lively but not over crowded bar for a Saturday. Service was great and our waitress was prompt. Their draft beer selection consisted of maybe 10 or so options with maybe half local option (spotted cow, etc.) and some from as far as CA. Beers ran us $5.50 & $6.50 per pint and were so refreshing to have on a hot day.  For food... I did their smoked salmon grilled cheese ~ generous portions of smoked salmon stuffed between two slices of bread with gruyere cheese, traditional red onions, & lathered with lemon-caper aioli. Tasty and unique twist on a grilled cheese & lox and not bad for $9. And of course when in Wisconsin, an order of fried cheese curds to share. Perfectly cooked, crispy on the outside and a tad gooey on the inside and served with ranch for dipping.  Anyways, if you're looking for a casual spot to grab a bite or drinks near the Capital building, I'd definitely give this one a try.  'Til next time, cheers!   161/365"}
{"text":"Underwhelming food, underwhelming bar, good location, good trivia night.... that being said, for any given item at any given price better can be found elsewhere in Madison."}
{"text":"Stopped at the Tipsy Cow by default, to escape from the rain, and impending storm. We had never eaten at this restaurant before, and I was actually pleasantly surprised. We were seated by the window in the bar room. We were able to watch the storm with relief as we enjoyed the delicious food and upbeat atmosphere. Our friendly waitress informed us that we could order half a salad as well as half an order of appetizers, which is just what we did. So glad she mentioned that option, because I was able to order the beet salad that I really wanted, as well as the truffle fries from the menu that were calling out to me. Both were absolutely delicious, and both half orders were plentiful! The beet salad consisted of chopped roasted beets mixed among a chopped lettuce mix, toasted pistachios (yum!), blue cheese and sliced red onions. Served on the side was a beet vinaigrette which I really didn't need as the salad was already tossed with a nice light dressing. I only have one tiny complaint. I would have preferred to have less red onion vs. as much as was included on the salad. A little onion overkill for me, but otherwise it really was wonderful. Now, on to the truffle fries.... absolutely fantastic! They were crunchy and delicious, tossed in truffle oil. Really heavenly, dipped in the garlic aioli that was served on the side. Very addicting! I'm very glad we were kind of forced to test this restaurant/bar out, and I plan to stop by again sometime. There are plenty more items on the menu I'd love to try."}
{"text":"This place is great! One of the best burgers in Madison. They keep it simple with the burgers, but totally deliver on taste. The also have really good cheese curds. Perfectly breaded on the outside and the cheese is melted all the way through in the inside. Definitely worth a try.   They have a good beer list that usually has options you can't normally find at bars."}
{"text":"I just moved to town and my sister came to visit so we went down to the square and ended up in the Tipsy Cow during the dinner rush. We got seated immediately, and got drinks and food quickly. My burger was fantastic. We had a great time!"}
{"text":"Nice quiet small place. Close to the Capital. Service was good. Had the alligator bites, and the Walleye fish sandwich along with bacon and blue cheese fries.  The sandwiches are sold separately from the fries.  The serving size was a good portion   As you can see from the picture, the fish was bigger then the bun  Ordered only one fry basket and that was enough for our table.  The alligator bites had a great flavor Enjoyed the bourbon peach mule. I would drop in again"}
{"text":"WOW!  We wandered in on a whim and were blown any by the food.  They definitely have the best burgers around!!  The onion rings were super sized and delicious!  The service was fast, but they could improve their dress code.   Try them out and enjoy!!  July 2017 - Update!  Still the best burgers in town!!!  I also really enjoyed the outdoor seating."}
{"text":"You guys...so good. Started off our dinner with goat cheese curds. They were exactly as amazing as you think they would be. Beautifully melty inside, great flavor, not too much breading. Then we shared a half order of carnitas fries, and I had a Tipsy-Q. The fries were awesome. Perfect amount of everything in every bite. The Tipsy-Q? I wasn't a huge fan. I'm not sure if it was the slaw or the sauce, but some component was sweet--but it was an odd sweet. Not the typical bbq sauce sweetness.   But the dranks. I looooooved the dranks. One in particular--I think It was called the bourbon peach mule? It. Was. Amazing. So perfect in every way that I racked up a $30ish bar tab drinking them. Slightly peach, slightly lime, slightly fizzy.   And the service was fantastic. I love places that get that right balance of stopping by the table often enough but not being too intrusive. Our server was amazing.  I will definitely be coming back to try the Korean bbq fries. And more dranks!"}
{"text":"Accessibility - 3 Atmosphere - 4 Taste - 4 Customer Service - 4 Value - 4 Average - 3.8 (4 stars)  I found this tiny Capitol-side restaurant charming. The food is well worth the price and I've made it a point to visit again."}
{"text":"Tried this place 6 months ago when new to Madison area. I really wanted cheese curds but hubby was overloaded with cheese. Haha.   Service: Host was fine. Male waiter was fine. No one was that friendly & inviting but then again they weren't rude either. Like I said, fine.   Food: I ordered a fish taco and the Korean BBQ fries. Fries were not bad. Too much sauce though. A bit salty. While the fish taco did lack taste. I'm coming from CA, of course I've had better. Lol.   Ambiance: Not a place I would bring my kids to. Maybe some friends or relatives visiting to have some food to share and have a drink.   I would come back again eventually and try something else."}
{"text":"Always a great atmosphere at the Tipsy Cow.  They have delicious burgers (their famous tipsy burger) and great appetizers. Try their goat cheese curds if you want to be a little adventurous.  There's great outdoor seating with a nice view of the Capitol."}
{"text":"Best cheese curds in Wisconsin. Reasonable prices, friendly, quality beef, generous with crispy bacon. Definitely recommend the Tipsy Burger. Service can be a little slow but usually just because they are very busy not because they aren't working hard. Clean and friendly. Love this local place."}
{"text":"Stopped by here today for lunch for my first ever fried cheese curds!! I just had to see what all the hubbub was about. And I have to say that fried cheese curds are like better mozzarella sticks, since it's 90% cheese! Especially since Wisconsin has the best and freshest cheeses...  Fried cheese curds were delicious. And my sister loved her local lamb burger. My tipsy burger was also delicious and very filling. The meat was cooked perfectly but there was a lot of excess liquid in my burger, compared to my sister who had an egg in hers. But it was good regardless. We also shared a basket of fries and those were good as well.  Service was a little slow but they were pretty busy and also I know our waitress was slammed with tables. She did the best that she could. Overall I had a very pleasant experience and glad that I chose tipsy cow for my first fried cheese curd experience!"}
{"text":"I had the Famous Onion Rings.  It is like eating a doughnut with a sliver of onion in it.  Not for me, maybe others, but not me.  Nothing really wows here, basically still the Local Tavern."}
{"text":"I have been to the Tipsy Cow twice, the first time was a few years ago. At the time we got cheese curds, which I thought were on par with some of the best in town-fresh and delicious. I also had a warm sandwich with Turkey and Havarti on it, also delicious! Now that was some time ago and I have always held the restaurant in high regard even though I hadn't made my way back.... until recently. I don't know if their food has gone downhill or if these particular items I  had this time were always lame. We stopped in for a beer and a couple appetizers to get out of the cold,  we ordered pretzels w/ cheese and a basket of buffalo french fries. Expecting some homemade pretzel and cheese dip,  we were presented with 4 store-bought, frozen pretzels. We paid $9 for 4 of the exact pretzels I could have bought at Woodman's for $2.29. The fries were OK, they were generic waffles fries you can get at most bars- very tasty for sure but nothing special. Good fries that were drenched in Frank's Red Hot and a blue cheese salad dressing. They were fine, I guess, but I expected and hoped for something a little more thoughtful in the menu and food. Good beer selection though!"}
{"text":"When you're on a pup crawl this place it a definite place to crawl through.  Love the name, the vibe, the drinks and the food here.  Second visit was as much fun as the first!  Sat at the bar with my friends and ordered a Grey Goose on ice.  Holy crap, talk about liberal pours and cool pricing.  Guess I've lived in Hawaii so long I expect a skimpy 1.5 ounce top shelf drink to cost a minimum $16.  This was a liberal 3 ounce at $8.  The Peach Mule, menu drink, was awesome.  Any beer on tap can be tasted before you buy which is a fantastic offer for serious beer drinkers.  A lot of old favorites on the food menu with new twists, prepared well and served by happy-to-be-there servers.  The Tipsy Cow Burger is off the charts good.  The Fried Curds, tasty.  The Beer Battered Onion Rings were thick and probably the best I've ever consumed.  Beautiful, thick, crisp....I'm drooling just writing this.  My favorite thing served (next to those awesome Onion Rings) was Mike's Pickles.  A menu item that had me begging for a jar, gallon please, to take home to Hawaii.  Unfortunately the pickles are a secret recipe and the not sold in any jar containers.  Tried to get the recipe but that was not to be bought or given.  I will return next trip to Madison.  Definitely a fantastic place to have a couple of drinks and have a great meal too."}
{"text":"This is an update to my original review.  First of all I was very impressed when the owner, Michael Banas, offered me a $20 gift certificate to come back since in the first review I complained about our service.  I was finally able to get back there yesterday and things have improved.  This time around I had the Griddled Turkey and Havarti on sour dough and my dining companion had the Tipsy Chicken - crispy.  Both sandwiches were excellent, mine had a huge stack of turkey and the bread was excellent and grilled nicely.  The Tipsy Chicken also received rave reviews, no skimping on the chicken patty and sandwich was like it just came out of the pan.  Sandwiches are ala carte, so we ordered a large order of beer battered fries on the recommendation of our server.  She said the large would be better for sharing.  Unfortunately, neither of us cared for the fries, so the small would have been a better choice.  Our main complaint is they were cold when they arrived.  Service was definitely better than our first visit, our waitress checked back with us, refilled water and was for the most part attentive.  However, after we were finished and she cleared our table it was at least 10 minutes until she returned with the bill.  Even with this small glitch, she was head and shoulders above the server from my first visit.  My one other small complaint is the lack of ice in the water...it is just my preference, and there was plenty of ice in the soda, so I am not sure why there isn't more in the water.  But again, that is just my personal preference.  Thanks, Michael, for buying me lunch and keeping your word of making some service changes.  Griddled Turkey and Havarti is a solid choice if you are looking for a yummy sandwich."}
{"text":"Fried cheese curds were some of the best I have ever had. Beer menu was a little limited and could have had more local and regional brews."}
{"text":"Occassion: Dinner with friends Food: tipsy cheeseburger, cheese curds, truffle fries Thoughts: Friendly service, food was good. Came on trivia night (8-10pm) - wasn't planned, but the trivia headmaster got us into it. It was $10 pitchers when we went."}
{"text":"What an awesome spot on the square!  We visited tonight and will definitely be going back soon.  We had the blue cheese and bacon fries as an appetizer...insane...the bacon was perfectly crispy and the fries were super crisp.  I had the guacamole burger which was the perfect blend of grilled burger, avocado, and zesty spice with pepper jack cheese on a grilled bun.  My husband had the kielbasa with zingy kraut and mustard...also amazing.  Great selection of tap and bottled beer...reasonably priced...one of our new favorite spots!!!"}
{"text":"Great no-frills burger here. The goat cheese curds are a great dish which I had not seen before. Loaded fries are a nice choice here as well. Beer selection is plentiful. Difficult to get a table at times, not a big surprise in this location."}
{"text":"5-star review for a not 5-star restaurant...Nor should it be. Tipsy is my favorite downtown Madison pub for a greasy delicious 'Merican meal. They excel at their staple burger...The Tipsy burger and my newly found favorite Korean Beef sandwich.    But in my humble eyes, I think they're sweetspot is their appetizer menu. The best option, though it may sound boring, is the French fries. They have bacon and bleu (our favorite), Korean BBQ fries, and barbeque ranch just to name a few. And they come smothered in whatever toppings you choose with enough to feed a table. Second to that, I'd try the cheese curds and if you're feeling crazy try the alligator bites.   Then of course, this is a true Wisconwin tavern, so you've got a full selection of craft beers at your disposal. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Very tasty.  Had the St. Germain & gin specialty cocktail--delicious and refreshing.  Truffle fries we shared - very tasty.  My friend commented that they are big on aioli here--true.    I had the creamy tomato soup and was delighted with the promised \"smoky and spicy\" flavors, along with the squeaky cheese curds garnishing the soup.  My grilled tilapia sandwich was generously portioned and cooked nicely, and the roll it was served on was pleasantly soft and chewy (Clasen's bread I believe?).    The service was prompt, attentive, and friendly.  The prices were right.  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Best onion rings and and cheese curds!! Burgers were amazing too!! Great service and staff were all very nice!"}
{"text":"On Saturday mornings during the Farmer's Market we usually stop to have Bloody Mary's and have some lunch. On last day of the Market, we tried something new and went to the Tipsy Cow. As the unfriendly bartender greeted us without eye contact, he asked my group \"What can I get you?\" he scooped the glass of ice out of the ice bin with the glass he was mixing the drink in, I pointed out a crack in the glass. This must have annoyed him and her threw the galss in the trash without simply replying \"Hey thanks for pointing that out to me.\"  We were greeted at our table by our server after a 5 minute wait. No smile, no welcome, nothing - \"What can I get you?\" The water glasses were brought over, another chip in the glass. Again no comment, she just whisked it away as if we were inconveniencing her. However, the food was hot and delicious and served in a timely manner. Next timw I will come to enjoy my food but only order bottled beverages. The ice bin could be full of glass from scraping the glass through the bin. Big no-no in the food/beverage industry. By the way, I am calling the Health Department and reporting this incident."}
