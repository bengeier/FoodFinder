{"text":"Came here for lunch today with my parents. I ordered a beef noodle soup noodle and a ja jiang mein.   Beef Noodle Soup The soup base was alright and so were the noodles itself but the meat was in huge chunks. It was also pretty dry and tough so that made it hard to eat. I wish they could have made it more tender and served it as smaller pieces instead. Since the meat was like that, I assume they probably boiled the meat.  Ja Jiang Mein Don't do it folks, don't order it. Traditional ja jiang mein is sweet. What I was given here was spicy and didn't taste like ja jiang mein at all. Ordering this would be something like walking into a Greek restaurant to order Chinese food. What you get will not be like the real thing."}
{"text":"The BF heard about this place off of redflagdeals.com and conveniently I had a dentist appointment in the area. We decided to drop by for dinner after since I'm a huge fan of noodles and stinky tofu.  It's a food court, so not very high expectations for service and atmosphere, but everything was clean and it was pretty quiet at 8pm on a Monday night. The Moo Beef booth is decorated really nicely with wooden plaques listing menu items, but only in Chinese. We were able to order in English but it would've been easier in Chinese for sure. The owner didn't seem to be overly fluent but the other girl (daughter?) was helpful.  We ordered two bowls of the classic Beef Noodles and a stinky tofu. I wanted to try their original broth before going for the spicy options, which would normally be my choice. Each bowl came topped with cilantro, bok choy, pickled cabbage and green onions. The noodles were thick and chewy, a good texture. The broth was salty but flavourful. There could have been a few more pieces of beef, but I did like the tendon and each piece was soft and tender. I was impressed with the stinky tofu, they were crispy and tasted great. Authentically stinky."}
{"text":"Moo Moo!  Moo Beef Noodles is a brand new beef noodle joint located inside the food court of Silver Star Blvd ??????. This is not the same Moo Moo that used to be in the same plaza..  What caught my eyes were their offerings of House Extra Spicy Noodles with 3 different levels! My weakness for spicy food especially for a cold winter afternoon!   Homicide Spicy Beef Noodle Soup ($6.99) was quite spicy according to my Yelp Friend. But it is basically their Beef Noodle Soup made spicy by adding bottled diced red chili, ended up I cannot taste their soup based much! The beef though was really tender and of good grade! Noodle though is really standard.  My suggestion would be just order the plain one and just add chili oil yourself, at least you can adjust your level. I saved my friend by eating the whole order....   I can smell stinky tofu... Yes if you are into stinky tofu! If you don't want to smell, you might want to stay far away from this stall....  I will be back to try some stinky tofu!"}
{"text":"I ordered a 3-cup chicken on rice for lunch ($4.99).  The portion was insane (see picture).  The chicken tasted homey with strong flavour of ginger and a hint of garlic.  Wait, there were garlic pieces in the mix; I ate them anyway.  So authentic.  I tasted the soy sauce and dark soy sauce, but can't find the sesame oil aroma.    This dish was okay though I wish the sesame aroma was stronger.  The price vs portion ratio was very good though."}
{"text":"i am on the edge with this one.. i want to give it only a 2.5  the food took forever to come out.. but it seemed like they were understaffed.  the portion of the food is hit and miss.... i ordered a noodle dish that had such poor portions... i had to order another dish because i was not even full.. turned out the 3.99 (*cheapest on their menu) noodle in a box i ordered was even bigger than the expensive noodle.  Their prices arent that great... nothing i would say is special about this place other than the nice fancy boxes some of the dishes come out in..  the lady hand makes the boxes which are also take out containers...   i hereby upgrade the rating of this review to 3 ... only because of the nice cool take out container box"}
