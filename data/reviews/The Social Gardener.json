{"text":"I usually spend my afternoon doing work at the cafe while enjoying a great cup of coffee.  The atmosphere here is great and the barista is super friendly.

Have tried several baked goods here. So far the cashew cookies are my favorite. :)"}
{"text":"Beautiful decor, amazing service. The women working there were unbelievably nice. I felt welcomed as soon as I stepped in. They've got the best vegan baked goods too. I'm definitely becoming a new regular at this place, thanks :)"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my boyfriend. Decor was nice, but the service was bad! The server just stared at us awkwardly when I said hello and seemed to have difficulty communicating or creating a welcoming environment. The two salads we ordered were soggy and plain (Rea Salad). The server also forgot our coffee and tea so we had to get them \"to go\" after our meal was done. The place was empty. No excuse for poor service. Wouldn't recommend, there are plenty of other great vegan places in the area."}
