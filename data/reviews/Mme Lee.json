{"text":"Nice place ! I've been to Mme Lee once on a Friday and I liked it. Prices are pretty normal for the kind of bar/location. $7 for a beer and $10-$13 for a drink. They have a food menu as well but I did not see it. 

The location is nice and spacious. I like the open windows.. I think the place turns to a sort of club after a certain hour since I saw a lineup.. Interesting. Check it out"}
{"text":"Too crowded, too noisy, long line to get in, the regular public seems to be drunk loud kids looking for trouble (saw some of them picked up by the police outside on several occasions).
Went there with friends a few times because it was located conveniently for us, but then we decided we should look for another place to hang out.
There are definitely better places to go to in Downtown Montreal."}
{"text":"Best bar/club in the area! It's been around for years and still going strong!"}
{"text":"Saw this discrete place with a long line after a night out in the Latin quarter and had to check it out the next night. Came on a Saturday , 1000 no line no hassle , place is a nice lounge vibe. By 11 the place was packed and converted to a club. Really cool open space with high ceilings. Unique cocktails, prices for drinks average for the area but were strong. Young crowd, lots of mgill students and offered bottle service if you're  into that. The highlight was definitely the dj and music which were both on point. As an American was surprised to hear banger after banger of throwback hip hop ( as well as a healthy Amt of drizzy) this in it self made it a great non pretentious place to drink and dance without going through the ordeal of going to an actual club. Made my trip to Montreal memorable highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Went here to celebrate my birthday with friends. Had a great time -- good music, drinks, atmosphere.

Would have given it 4 stars, but the service was not the greatest. 
Made a reservation for 930 pm for a table for 15 people 2 weeks in advance and called up the day before to confirm that it was still in their books for the right time & number of people. It was, but when I got there the next night, the hostess had it written down for 10 pm instead. Not a big deal. When my friends had all arrived, we were a group of 30 people, so some were sitting, some were standing. Slowly but surely, the staff started to take away our tables -- without even telling us -- and we had to stop them to ask what was going on. We were told that another reservation was coming in at 11:30 so they needed to maximize the space. Friends of mine were literally asked to get out of the chairs they were sitting in for the people that would be arriving in 30 minutes. Not only did they not explain over the phone that the tables would only be ours for about an hour, they were prioritizing people that were not even there yet over those that were sitting in their lounge, buying their drinks. After someone pointed out to this staff member that she should probably do something to compensate for their poor service, she agreed to a free drink for the birthday girl...which never came.

I'd go back again, but definitely not with a large group."}
{"text":"Ma place préférée pour un 5 a 7 au centre-ville. La carte de drinks offre plusieurs options qui changent au fil du temps. La bouffe est correcte, n'allez pas la pour un bon repas. La deco est sublime, ça me rappelle quelques endroits de NYC. Plusieurs événements y sont organisés les jeudis et même parfois des marchés de petits designers ou vide-dressing le jour le weekend. Je n'y suis jamais allée pour sortir mais on m'a dit que la crowd est plus jeune et le bar se remplit vite. Excellent spot pour des gros 5 à 7, ils peuvent réserver une section au fond du bar."}
{"text":"Mme lee est un tres belle decouverte ! Caché près du cegep du vieux montreal ce petit club est parfait pour les gens qui chercher un endroit ou vous ne serai pas coincé sur 25 autres personne tellement le bar est plein ! De plus, tu peux avoir une table sans reservation et il ya un petit spot pour danser ! Les verres ne sont pas si chere non plus (7$ la biere ) 

Pour votre info la musique est a 95% du rap, moi ca ma encore faite plus tripper !"}
{"text":"This bar is the manifestation of bigotry and homophobism. There is currently (1/17/16 2:30 AM) a bouncer working at Bar Madame Lee who was so disgusted by my appearance with my partner that he came up to us, asked me if I was bothering anyone (which I was not), which obviously made my drunk self angry. You may argue that I was drunk that's why this event occurred, but this bouncer hired to be ready for this type of behavior. I proceeded to tell him to mind his own business. After this, he took offense from my ridiculously \"gay\" behavior and put me in a headlock, dragged me out the door, and threw me into the middle of the street. I did not fight back. After I began to get up, this homophobic bouncer took me by the head, and threw me back onto the ground. He left me alone after this. Madame Lee, if you keep this bouncer hired after this repulsive night, I will make sure that not only does your club suffer legal action, but furthermore it will enjoy no more visitors. This bouncer was of a brown complexion, probably around 5' 11\", and had a beard."}
{"text":"Belle ambiance. Le staff est très sympathique. Bonne ambiance et bonne musique. Idéal pour les fêtards qui ont plus que 21 ans!!! Je suis aller pour veiller tard et pour un drink un soir de semaine...je vous le recommande."}
{"text":"We came here based on a recommendation from a couple of girls we met from Toronto the night before.  We were looking for a place to dance with good music and this was probably one of the better places I've been to in a while.  Biggest pro for me was the old-school hip hop and R&B -- they played What's Luv...c'mon WHAT'S. LUV.  Took it all the way back to high school for me.  And atmosphere and crowd were cool.  Despite the awesome music selection, Mme Lee loses one star from me for the mediocre song transitions, left me a bit disappointed.  But this doesn't take away from the fact that my friends and I really enjoyed ourselves and won't stop me from recommending this place to anyone in the area."}
{"text":"I was here very early (like when it opened) so there was no line and no happening crowd - but they were setting up ropes and there were some bouncers in preparation. I hear it gets very packed and fun. Bathrooms are unisex, so don't be alarmed if you see some hunks peeing. I was just here to use the bathroom but plan on coming back to check it out properly. First impressions are lasting, and this place impressed me, even in its non-crowded, day-light-hour state."}
{"text":"We got bottle service.

At the end of the night as the bills are being paid, I asked Dana the bartender for water. I was told no. Seeing this, my boyfriend asks her for water, she gives it to him. I look at her in disbelief and I ask again, she still says no.

Not sure whats up with you bartender but that's not how you treat customers."}
{"text":"Went there about three years ago, very nice and fun. 
Went there again this week, the crowd is very young. The bouncers and the coatcheck girls were rude and very disrespectful even though we didn't do anything to upset them. They seemed to be angry at everybody. After waiting for my coat to leave, the zipper was stuck in the retractable belt post and one of the 6 bouncers in the entry area screamed repeatedly to never touch that retractable belt as if it was the worst thing i could've done to offend them. Also, the coatcheck girls repeated themselves 3 times that the coats were paid by only tips with a very nonchalant attitude and tone and didn't even say hello or good evening ... i mean , isn't tips supposed to be given when you have a good service and are satisfied ? Not just because someone asks you for tip... 
Other events by the entry door that led to a very unpleasant end of evening. Very disappointed wouldn't recommend because of the staff."}
{"text":"There are several candles placed in dangerous areas, right behind people's heads. I leaned too far back and MY HAIR CAUGHT ON FIRE. Also the location of the candles could be dangerous with the various alcoholic drinks being spilled by drunk people."}
{"text":"Easily one of the coolest addresses in Montreal. It was home to Jello Bar for many years and now to this super badass spot. It's all things cool: hip decor, specially the lighting. Strong drinks, hip-hop, ultra friendly staff.. loved it. 

I definitely have to go back for food. Spotted the waiter carrying this delish-looking tartare.... oh la!"}
{"text":"Super endroit, super musique. Que ce soit pour boire un verre jusqu'au bout de la nuit ou encore pour dîner. On y mange très bien!"}
{"text":"Ça faisait un bout que j'attendais de voir ce qui remplacerait le Jello Bar. Malheureusement, j'ai été déçue. L'endroit en tant que tel est vraiment beau. Les luminaires, les bars, la déco... mais c'est beaucoup plus jeune que ce à quoi je m'attendais et vraiment bondé de monde les soirs de fin de semaine (juste pour dire, l'attente de la file s'élevait à 45 minutes). 

Le bar était tellement rempli, que ça prennait un bon quart d'heure se faufiler à travers la foule pour pouvoir faire le tour de la place et l'attente au bar était phénoménale. Je ne sais pas pour toi, mais quand je sors, j'aime croire que je suis capable de commander un verre avant d'avoir le temps de me désaouler...  Mais bon. Pour ceux et celles qui sont dans leur vingtaine et qui aiment les clubs, vous serez bien servi. Ça danse en masse (et vraiment très collé), ça \"cruise\" à la tonne et on ne s'entend pas vraiment parler. 

Ça pourrait être tout simplement la follie du nouveau, faut croire. Alors, je vais probablement leur donner une deuxième chance. Je vous reviens là-dessus."}
{"text":"A group of friends and I went there recently for dinner, and we were told that they no longer served food! They only serve tapas such as olives, nuts, marinated vegetables, meat balls and Mac n'cheese. The overall set up is really nice, there are tables all over the place. The music is really cool, hip, relax, remixes, jazz, rap. The crowd seemed between the ages of 20-24. I recommend that you show up before 11pm because it gets pretty packed inside, and the line up to get it in, is quite long. I don't think I would go there again."}
{"text":"Un très beau bar qu'on entend pas assez parler! Les prix sont corrects, les choix de bières sont super et le service est bon ! La musique (quand nous y sommes allés, ça change peut-être) était vraiment bonne, c'était du vieux rap (et nouveau). L'endroit n'est pas trop plein, mais tu te sens pas tout seul non plus!! Les gens ont de la classe, mais t'as pas besoin de te mettre sur ton 31 non plus!

Bref, un très beau bar !"}
{"text":"Good place for a date on weekdays. Didnt stick around long enough so 3 stars for now"}
{"text":"Bar design dans le Quartier des Spectacles/Quartier Latin ! Y étant aller par le passé déjà quelques fois, j'avais l'impression d'être trop vieux pour la place, étant entouré de jeunes début vingtaine et je mettais fait une idée de ne plus revenir ici. Mais, un samedi soir avec ma copine, nous sommes arrivés vers les 21h30/22h, presque personne, calme, parfait pour siroter un de leurs cocktails. Avons adorés le côté design de la place. Une belle soirée et surtout pas de line-up comme le bar à cocktails non loin de là.

4/5 visité en mai 2016."}
{"text":"Went to Mme Lee for the first time on a Friday night, I love the visual design of the space. A huge mixture of age groups, literally. On a Friday night, you'll find 18-35 year old. 

Music was good but didn't hear any classic hip hop as I was told by many.

Staff at the bar are ok. The girl knew her stuff. At coat check, its another story. The girls were kind of rude. And if you plan on arriving after midnight, you might not be able to check your coat.

Cocktails $12. Beers and whisky/7up decent price.

Nice place for drinks and friendly gatherings. Dancing not much space for that especially on weekends."}
{"text":"I went to Mme Lee a couple of weeks ago for the first time. I didn't actually make it into the bar because of the woman working coat check. 

That night cover was $5--I paid the money, was stamped and handed the woman my coat. I realized I hadn't paid the $3 coat check fee, so I handed her the additional $3. She subsequently asked me for the $5 for cover. I tried to explain to her that I had already paid and showed her that she had stamped my arm. She refused to listen and repeatedly told me I had to pay $5 to go inside. (I feel like I should also mention the place was empty when I got there, with no line behind me). 

By the end of the encounter she had pushed my friend who was with me and I lost $8. We left and I won't be returning."}
{"text":"J'ai juste arreté un peu ici pour me desalterer tres tot dans la soiree avec un jus canneberge et j'ai trouvé la place jolie avec sa grande fenestration et ses chandelles."}
