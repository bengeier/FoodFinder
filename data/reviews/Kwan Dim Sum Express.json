{"text":"I am giving the stars only for the food and service.  But no stars for the price.  You can get the same quality of dimsum for half the price at another nearby place with the tea for free (they charged $3 for a pot). Almost every dimsum dish is $5 and a plate of flat noodles with beef is $17 which is not worth it.  We paid $80.00 (w/tax) for three of us (7 dimsum dish, noodles and tea)"}
{"text":"The pieces (har gow and siu mai) are smaller than the average dim sum restaurant. They advertise $3 but there's only two items in the menu that are $3.  And if you don't drink tea, they will charge you $2 for hot water and won't tell you.  If you're in Scarborough, you might as head into a real dim sum restaurant because there's so many good ones around the area!"}
{"text":"Went on opening day, they have a lot of work to do. First thing, when my mom and I got a table, the host informed us that there was no dim sum available because of a problem in the kitchen. Understandable, first day, there are issues even if you are calling yourself Kwan \"Dim Sum\". So we ordered a French Style Seafood Roll ($8), Canton Chow Mein ($15) and Sweet & Sour Pork ($16!). Tea also costs $2/p.   So now our food is ordered and we notice literally everyone seems to be ordering dim sum?? The table right next to us got sticky rice in bamboo leaf and some other dim sum items. I want to ask what's going on at this point but I figured I'd come back for Dim sum if this food was good.   The pork arrives first, an over-battered soggy chewy mess. For $16 this is pretty much a rip off considering what you can get at pretty much any other Chinese restaurant for half the price. It did look pretty though.   Next came the noodles. Actually not bad which is why they don't have 1 star. Nice crispiness in the noodle, sauce was good, lots of different ingredients like scallop, green bean, beef, pork, etc.   The seafood roll arrives and it's that thing you can get at a dimsum place for around $3... Except it's $8! Does it taste $5 better? No, it tastes $3 worse since I wouldn't pay a dollar for flavourless, pathetic-looking rolls with two rubbery shrimp sandwiched in otherwise empty pockets of nothingness.   I had high hopes because I was looking forward to a dim sum place close to home. But Kwan has a lot of work to do (for starters, serving their namesake to all customers...)"}
{"text":"Decent chinese restaurant. Very pretty and the service and fairly good. Nice place to hang out, has a classy aura. Needs a washroom tho, it is a hassle to go outside. Food is outstanding"}
{"text":"I had the Dinner For Two for $36. I can't believe I paid that much for what tasted like food court Chinese food (like manchu wok).  2-star for the beautiful ambiance and good service."}
{"text":"This was my first time here at Kwan for dim sum,I have to say there shrimp rolls and the chicken feet and the spareribs in blackbean sauce was suburb and delicious,And excellent taste,A lot better then some other dim sum places I have been to. The old saying is you pay for what you get."}
{"text":"I didn't think this restaurant would have good and authentic dim sum given that it is in the Scarborough Town Centre. However, I was pleasantly surprised. The dim sum is good not great. We ordered standard dishes such as  har gow, siu mai, turnip cake, fried rice. All were good. The best dish was the fried octopus - one of the best I have had. Service was good too."}
{"text":"Went in the restaurant super excited - left disappointed?. The food is okay, you can definitely? find better dim sum around the area. The prices are decent if you are looking for something relative to food court prices. The staff and service were terrible, the food came slow and staff explicitly asked out loud why I did not tip (because nothing was worth tipping tbh)"}
{"text":"This review is relative to the selection in the mall. While certainly not the best dim sum or par with their main location at Yonge/St.Clair, Kwan's 3rd location at STC certainly does the job while shopping at the mall. The location is on the second floor, across from Indigo (near Disney store and the movie theater)  You have two options when looking for a quick bite at Scarborough Town. You can go to the food court and get a combo which nowadays costs around $10-13 per person, or you can spend relatively the same amount with a few friends and come here. To me it's a no brainer. The food is definitely better quality than the food court and you get to sit down, relax and enjoy table service!  The renovations and decor are very classy.  We had dim sum here and the menu is pretty much the same as other Kwan locations. It is was quite busy on the weekend, so get there earlier if you are in a larger group. They do have some interesting bar set up seating which I must say is a neat way to serve dimsum.  They also have their standard Cantonese dinner menu.   Note the service here is better than most Chinese restaurants as they also cater to the non-Asian crowd (though pretty much everyone eating here was Chinese!)  Seriously, skip Manchu Wok or Shanghai 360 in the food court and come here instead!"}
{"text":"Food is okay, nothing special. But the nice part is that this is cheaper than the food court and you get a seat.  We had their bean curd veggie roll, cheung fun w/ fried dough stick, and mango pudding. Don't get the pudding, but the other two were alright.  Service is slow, but nothing unbearable. Again, price is higher than other dim sum places, but this is in a mall where food court food costs just the same."}
{"text":"This place is terrible compared to their original location at yonge and stclair. They keep people waiting where there's plenty of seats inside. The server and food runner don't even know the table number and was wondering around looking for the table. We ordered 8 plates and service was so slow to a point they are serving to us one by one and it was COLD!!! Not even a hot dim sum. Seating was terrible and does not seems like is a handicap friendly restaurant. Is just lack of space and tooooo many bar table. Very uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Have visited three times and found the price is reasonable and the food good for the price.  The service however was extremely slow, there wasn't anything \"express\" about it. Two of our items came out quickly while the rest arrived 30-40 min after. The location was not busy enough to explain the slow service."}
{"text":"A standard mall grade restaurant. It was nothing special and the pricing reflected that. Overall a decent priced menu, with decent food - the only reason I would come again is for the seating. It's definitely comfier than the food court downstairs.   We ordered the lunch special for $13.00, served until 3:30PM. This included a spring roll, some rice and your choice of sweet and sour pork/chicken or tofu. We also got the deedee noodles, har gaw and soup dumplings from the dim sum menu. The shrimp dumplings tasted fine - exactly as expected. The soup dumplings were a little disappointing though, they tasted much more doughy than soupy. Overall the meal was okay, thank god i was in good company hahah.   Also note that hot water is a $2.00 charge."}
{"text":"Very surprised at the low rating! Definitely one of the best dumpling and hargo places in Scarborough. My wife and I were shocked that a place inside a mall can be this good."}
{"text":"Their dim sum prices are overpriced ($3-$5/ item) if you order from their main menu. I only saw one item that was priced $3.   The only menu course that is great for it's value is their weekday lunch dim sum set where you can try their most popular items for only $13. I really enjoyed all of the items from that set which includes a salty egg bun, siu mai, har gow, pork meat bun, leaf sticky rice, and a mango pudding dessert. It even includes a pot of green tea, which is nice because they usually charge an extra $2/ guest for tea/ hot water. All the items were pipping hot, fresh and made very well. The restaurant is nicely decorated and has a good atmosphere to it.   We were impressed by their lunch, so we gave their dinner a try. Unfortunately the dishes on their dinner menu was way too salty for us."}
{"text":"This was my first dim sum experience. My friends and I tried several of their dishes, including their dumplings, sticky rice in a lotus leaf and some small buns. It was all delicious! I liked the fact that each plate contains a few small portions that allow for easy sharing. Prices for the dim sum were very cheap, even for the \"XL\" plates. They also have a separate menu for other non-dim sum Chinese dishes. Service was quick as well, only had to wait 5-10 minutes for each dish. Lastly, their mango pudding dessert was great. I also tried their \"coffee cake\" dessert which was kind of disappointing because it's really more like coffee Jello. All in all, this is a great new spot if you're in the mood for dim sum."}
{"text":"Decent, though somewhat overpriced dim sum in a beautiful space on the upper food court of STC. Good siu mai and har gow, but when it comes to the deep fried turnip patties we ordered, I've had better. We also had the mango pudding with condensed milk for dessert -- that was excellent. Service was not bad; they did forget about the tea we ordered but we didn't bother following up either.  There are too many alternatives for better, more authentic, and cheaper dim sum in Scarborough for me to go here, but not bad as an option if you're already at STC and craving dim sum."}
{"text":"It was overpriced, I was underwhelmed. That's really the truth of it. Dim sum wasn't anything exceptional, though priced as it should be better than it actually was. Service was terrible. Food was just average. The truffle fried rice certainly smelled delicious, as most truffled things do, though it tasted... just like any fried rice you'd get anywhere else.  Their honey glazed ribs are 2 pieces of kalbi, cut up into pieces and, again, just okay. Don't waste your money here, folks. There's way better dim sum, for half the price, at so many other places."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place out for a while. I've walked by it easily a hundred times since it opened as I live close to Scarborough Town Center. I bit the curiosity bullet today and went there in a group. Can't say it lived up to my expectations.  First, let's start with the food. It was overall okay. There wasn't anything particularly special about it and I probably could have got better stuff from the take-away places downstairs. One of the dishes had bell peppers that were practically raw. Ordered a Chiuchow style dish and it didn't really taste anything like standard Chiuchow fare.  The price is where this place goes from being \"okay\" to \"never going back again\". It's absurd the amount they charge for dishes with the core price being $16 for a meat main and $4-5 per dim sum basket. You'll walk out of here paying $25 before tax and tip per person if you want a relatively full meal. That price is only a problem when you consider how little and low-quality food you're getting.  My final bone to pick was this place committing a cardinal sin for Chinese restaurants. They charged $2 a person for tea. A Chinese restaurant charging for tea?  I wouldn't recommend coming here unless you're looking to dump a ton of money for subpar food. If you're craving Chinese food, the Agincourt area is just one block north."}
{"text":"I don't frequent STC much but I'm glad to see that they've added lots of variety in terms of food to this mall including Kwan. We grabbed some late lunch on the weekend and it wasn't bad. It's a tad pricier than Chinatown but I guess the convenience of it being in a mall justifies it slightly, and that it looks nice enough that you don't feel like you're inside a mall (if you're seated in the back). The best item we ordered was the squid tentacles, it was done very nicely. The worst item we ordered was scallop rice roll, barely any scallop with a vegetable filler (not listed on the menu), and basically not worth the price. The rice rolls in general aren't the best in texture (very firm and slightly dry) but passable. Overall, it's better than food court dim sum."}
{"text":"First off the food wasn't bad but I thought it was way overpriced the beef balls were good the harrow shrimp dumpling was amazing but I thought the protons were too small and way overpriced if you want good domain go to perfect Chinese restaurant  I know they are trying to upscale stc I think this definitely will run for a while in stc it gives customers definitely something new to try but I tried so many dinsums now and this place doesn't even compare to the dim sum places I tried"}
{"text":"As honest as I could be, I don't think the dim sum here was worth the price. Their dim sum ranged between $3-$5 for one bowl (which I personally think is overpriced for 3 pieces of siu bao). And their platters such as their beef chow mein was $16 and conpoy fried rice $18. Elsewhere, dim sum (and even chow mein) wouldn't cost that much. My friends and I also had to ask three times to three different servers for plain rice and we weren't there during peak hours so we didn't understand why it had taken so long. On a brighter note, siu mai was probably my favourite dish and each order that came out was hot and fresh. The ambiance and decor was also very pleasant."}
{"text":"The food was alright and nothing special but it was nice to have a sit down restaurant in the food court. The atmosphere was very inviting and service was quick. We tried many items off the menu and the mango shrimp rolls wrapped with rice paper and the steamed shrimp dumplings were the best in my opinion. The dim sum is pricey compared to most other places but nice to drop in while shopping at the mall."}
{"text":"I wanted to check this place, since it was just opened, new guy in Scarborough Town Centre. This is my experience. It is not express as they claim, waited for the seat, nice dining area and severs running around. I expected food quality should be higher, sadly, it wasn't. Forgetting the service since it was confusing, I don't know where to put it as food court or dine in restaurant, somewhere in between. I ordered Chiu Chow chicken and Hargow, you can see the photos I attached. Food quality was just like other food court, for a much more expensive price. You pay for the place, not the food. It even tasted like well cooked in any Chinese supermarket. This is definitely not worth it. BEWARE: the dishes don't come with rice, you have to order separately which add up more to the bill. I asked one lady at the cashier place whether it comes with rice or not, she said yes, and later, I didn't see any rice, so I asked the guy who seemed like the manager, he said no, that I had to order it. Very disappointed, I must say. Bottom line, one try only, never gonna return to this place, definitely not recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Typical dim sum fare but amazing service and atmosphere!   FOOD: They had a good variety of dim sum dishes and tasted authentic, but I found that it was a little on the pricier side. Most dishes (4pc siu mai or har gow) were categorized as size \"large\", which were priced at $5 each.   SERVICE: All the servers were very polite and gave us space to eat without rushing us, and they did a great job topping off our teacups and refilling the teapot when empty. They made sure to check on you every once in awhile to see how you were enjoying the food. They were also very friendly when seating us and explaining the logistics of ordering.   ATMOSPHERE: We went at 1pm on a Sunday and the restaurant was 3/4 full, but each table had enough space around them to not feel crowded. The decor reminded me more of an upscale japanese restaurant more than anything! There was a good ambient noise level as well (not too loud, not too quiet).   Overall, I would say this is an above average dim sum restaurant and I will definitely be choosing this place over traditional, loud and crowded dim sum spots for my next dim sum craving!"}
{"text":"I came here once. The food was not worth the price, service was so so. Won't come again."}
{"text":"On this particular Saturday afternoon I found myself in Scarborough, a place that I called Home for 30 years. It was that time of day when we needed a bite to eat and wanted to try something a bit different from the regular Scarborough eats.  Venturing into Scarborough Town Centre always makes me nostalgic. I grew up in this mall in the late 70's. The mall has drastically changed over the years, but coming back here always brings a smile to my face.  This place is situated in the renovated food court, it's on the upper level which also hosts other speciality stores. I was glad to see it wasn't in the traditional food court setting.  First impression. It's very stylish and sleek, the servers were very friendly and we promptly got a seat.  Having eaten dim sum and other Chinese foods I had big expectations for this place. Fellow yelpers had given it 5 stars, so I couldn't miss right!?!...Guess what.... I wasn't disappointed.   We settled on ordering the following: Steamed Veggie Dumplings (5/5), Shanghai Style Pork Dumplings (5/5), Honey Glazed Beef Ribs (5/5), Veggie Congee w/Pork Bone (4/5), Bok Chou w/ Goji & Enoki (5/5).   As my rating indicates the food was excellent!  If your ever in the area, try this place out you will truly be glad you came."}
{"text":"They raised the price of all their dim sum and now charge $7 for mediocre har gow, for instance. Who in the world charges that much for dim sum in Scarborough?   Don't fall for this tourist trap of a restaurant."}
{"text":"We had lunch today in this restaurant. The decor and ambiance is really nice.  But the food was unimpressive, almost like just any other dim sum place in scarborough.  Tab for two adults and three kids was about $130. A little pricy for dim sum in my opinion. I guess we were paying for the nice deco."}
{"text":"Isn't Chinese Tea the free drink every Chinese dim sum place offers? Besides water, tea is a given! I've been to countless Dim Sum places my whole life and tea is always included in the meal. It's pretty much the first thing servers ask you. And thats what happened here. Server asked tea or water, we chose tea. Tea came, and we got menus to look for what we want.  We chose the $30-$40 ish Dinner set for 2 they have, and the set includes drinks for two, and an option was pop. We ordered, and the server asked what drink we want, we chose our choice of pop, and she saw our tea pot, and took it away! Like what? Not even a single word of why, till she came back, and asked. She said since we chose pop, we don't get tea. Tea isn't something we ordered off the menu! We were shocked to see that we're not allowed to have tea because we chose pop in the Dinner for Two! ALL other tables had complementary tea but not us. My friend and I were def not pleased. We ordered the tea before we even got to look at the menus; what if we didn't get the Dinner set, and got regular dishes that didn't include any drinks? We ate dinner seeing all surrounding tables getting refills on their tea, while we were refused the one drink everyone expects when coming to a Chinese restaurant.  I know I'm making a big deal of it, but as someone who has Chinese background, I've went to chinese reataurants all my life, and this is the first place that would strip it away from me.   Otherwise, food was average, service tended to avoid eye contact rather than to look out for any customers with a request. I can't see myself coming again."}
{"text":"I enjoyed coming here, as it was new when it had opened.   We had the Szechuan fried rice and a couple other standard dim sum items. They were made well. The decor is modern Chinese, the ambiance is nice. I think the prices are reasonable for the setting.  Service could be quicker, I hope the owners message me about suggestions on how to improve as service did not seem very quick even though there were very few customers."}
{"text":"There are nothing really Express about Kwan Dim Sum Express. By the name and located in Scarborough Town Centre, I thought it is like a food court setting with no table service.  I was surprise to find out how spacious and roomy it is. Here you can enjoy a authentic dim sum yum cha experience. Their dim sum is decent  and reasonably priced. I just love the idea of able to get some \"real\" Chinese food in STC. If you don't like dim sum, they also have a full menu of other Cantonese items!  The set up is also a little different than traditional dim sum joint as there are high tops and even communal like table setting for single patrons.  I will be back next time when I am shopping at STC and it is a nice option to go before catching a movie for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Service is very bad, not professional at all. Food is like from food court, better to eat at manchu wok. Very pricey and bad service."}
{"text":"Food is okay. The service is nice but a bit rushed. As soon as I finish a dish the immediately grab the empty dish. The food is a bit bland compared to other dim sum places and it is a bit more expensive for the same items. The food does come out fairly quickly and some of the items are still really hot which is a good thing."}
{"text":"Came here with my family for lunch and knew that it was going to be expensive. I often go dimsum in Scarborough, but to the authentic restaurants owned by Chinese people because Scarborough is known for its Chinese food due to the population. The setting is quite nice and comfortable, and service is quick. We were able to get a high chair and booster seat as well.  First, I was surprised that tea was charged per person and hot water was also a charge. It was the first time I had heard that hot water was a charge! So we opted for cold water. As well, the pricing per dimsum is double the cost of usually dimsum at local places. Most dimsum are around $2-3 per dish but they charge $5 for a small dish. However, the dishes were piping hot when they came out, the ingredients were pretty good quality. We ordered the shrimp rice noodle, lotus leaves rice, shrimp hargow and Siumai.  The siumai was a bit on the smaller size but everything else was not bad."}
