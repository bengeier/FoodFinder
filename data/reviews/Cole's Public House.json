{"text":"Wow, really great service and amazing food. 

We went in expecting bar food comparable to the former tenant, Stubby's, but what we got instead was a very upscale very refined (French inspired?) menu with items at an extremely reasonable price. 

Between the two of us, we got four items

-A cup Butternut Squash Bisque (which was delicious and had perfectly balanced flavors) - $3

-A bowl of the Three Cheese Mac & Cheese (the sauce for which was a brilliant combination of Swiss, Gouda, Cheddar and an outstanding Truffle Mouse) - $8

- A Sweet Potato Ravioli that came with a side of your choice (the pasta I believe was homemade and the sauce, which contained black truffle, was easily the best thing I've eaten so far this year. It also had these little nuts in it that added great texture to each bite. The side I selected was lyonnaise potatoes) - $15

-a Chocolate Cake with Vanilla Ice Cream (a classic combination) - $5

All were excellent and really impressive. 

With all that, I only have a three qualifiers/criticisms. 

1. Portions are smaller than at most restaurants in the area but this is typical of most fine dining restaurants I've been to. They aren't tiny, mind you, it's just not the mound of food you get at most other restaurants in the area. You're paying for quality not the quantity here and I honestly feel as though, considering that quality, they should cost more for what you get. 

2. It's a little confusing that Burgers (which are $8) don't come with a side of French fries while the same fries would come free with any of the entrees. If the Burgers were $10 and included Fries but the Ravioli I got was $13 and didn't include a side I just feel it would make more sense. This might be done because of food costs though and it definitely doesn't take away from the taste of anything for it to be done this way.

3. With the cake and ice cream, I feel as though if the cake were warmer it would be a really nice temperature contrast with the ice cream.

We're definitely going back soon."}
{"text":"Plain and simple I cannot recommend this place enough. Food is fantastic, drinks are prepared by mixologist. Wine selection is fantastic"}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time today and we were absolutely blown away. The atmosphere is hip, yet relaxed. The hand crafted cocktails are unique and delicious, but not over done. And I can't say enough about how amazing the menu is. We started with the goat cheese dip as an appetizer and it was so good we seriously considered ordering another one as our meal. But I am so glad we tried other offerings. I had the cheddar and apple burger, which not only tasted great with Brie cheese oozing out of it, but it looked like a piece of art. We took an order of mac and cheese to go bc we couldn't bear the thought of leaving without trying it. And that was the best decision ever. I can't wait to go back and try more items on the menu and delve into their extensive beer list. Truly a must visit and my new favorite watering hole/restaurant."}
{"text":"When I first arrived at Cole's I was impressed with the architecture and beautiful decor, however the menu seemed to turn me off. After ordering the Apple Brie Burger, based off of my waitress' recommendation I was so impressed! My fiancé and I decided to make this place a weekly visit. The place is beautiful and although if you are a simple girl like me and the menu seems to turn you away at first, TRUST ME when I say the food is so phenomenal! Impressed with the chef and homemade menu as well as the amazing staff! Highly recommend stopping here and grabbing a bite to eat."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today with my coworkers.  All three of us enjoyed our meals and the waiter was just super. This will definitely be on our must stop list the next time we're traveling through!   Great food and excellent service - definitely worth stopping at!!!"}
{"text":"We found this pub during our return journey from Lake Huron to Pittsburgh because the Moosehead was closed. The food was great, the atmosphere is nice (but loud), and the beer and wine list extensive. I wish I could give them five stars, but the service wasn't very good as our server was too preoccupied with her end of shift cleanup to pay attention to us - her only table. Michael had the wild mushrooms chicken and the lyonnaise potatoes and it was phenomenal. I had the pasta carbonara with the spring pea purée and it was spectacular. I asked the chef to add some grilled chicken to the dish and he did without a problem. My issue was with the fact that we never received our French Onion soup and it took 10 minutes to get a refill on my water and wine. The manager was apologetic and offered to pack the soup for us to take, but with three more hours to travel, it wasn't a good suggestion - plus, microwaved French onion soup? No thanks. What made it particularly egregious was the fact that I mentioned the Yelp reviews about the soup when I ordered it. D'oh! 

Overall, this is a very good place to eat. You should go. I'd say that you should try the French onion soup... but, alas...."}
{"text":"Delicious! This was my first visit and won't be my last. The server was very friendly and knowledgeable .  I split the goat cheese appetizer and it was amazing. I then ordered the special burger of the day which was the cowboy burger. This burger was a monster! Someone I was with ordered a regular cheeseburger and it is just as big. . We agreed they were juicy and delicious. I was happy I didn't order a side because I could only manage half of it. I gave  the other half to someone in my party and they agreed it was amazing. Others with me ordered a burger, a chicken panini w/fries, chicken and biscuit with a side salad. Everyone agreed that everything was DELICIOUS! I can't wait to go back and try something else on the menu."}
{"text":"$4 craft beers and awesome cheap lunch specials! Awesome service and even better food. Sat outside on the patio and besides the loud cars it was the perfect environment. Get the Apple bacon burger! Did not expect to see something like this in Amherst Ohio."}
{"text":"First of all, I was extremely annoyed at how good everything sounded on the menu. It was terribly difficult to choose something. Good beer list, their cocktails were creative. 

We started with the baked goat cheese and sausage with mustard. Both were lovely. The cheese was perfectly toasted and the tomato sauce was a great accompaniment. The sausage was definitely made in house, both mustards complimented it well. 

I had the red dragon burger, my wife had the croque madam, and my mother the house burger. We all enjoyed our entrees. The fries were really well seasoned and came with a delicious aioli. The burger was perfectly cooked and the meat blend was great, not overly greasy. 

The madame was giant, and the mornay was well done, velvety and smooth. No complaints about the food at all. Overall, the portion sizes were large for the price. A great value, will definitely come back when I'm in town. 

Service was also good. Our waiter was Spencer who was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Guys, let's get serious for a second. Do you like goat cheese? Yes? They have this baked goat cheese appetizer at Cole's that comes served atop this delicious tomato marmalade, and they give you these perfectly toasted slices of homemade bread to slather it all upon. They serve this whole deal really beautifully on a piece of slate and I think the price is SIX DOLLARS. My 6'4\" working-man type husband and I shared this appetizer and it was enough food that we were both wondering how much dinner we should really order. You should have started driving over when I said baked goat cheese. If you weren't swayed even further when I said six dollars, well, I don't know what to tell you.

There is a really decent draft beer selection, maybe a little bit pricier than you're used to for the area, but please allow me to continue about the food. After said goat cheese magnificence, my husband ordered the burger that comes with fresh apple slices and brie on top of it. I don't remember what it was called because I lost all focus at apple slices and brie. On a burger. Oh did I mention there's also bacon on this thing? I ordered the chicken and biscuit because that is a combination that just makes your soul smile. Let me tell you about this thing. Have you ever tried to perfectly bread and fry a boneless, skinless chicken breast? I feel like boneless, skinless chicken breasts are written off as being boring and elementary, but that is a cut of meat that's pretty difficult to get right. When I think of dry and disappointing dinners, the star of the show typically is a boneless, skinless chicken breast. They have perfected this thing at Cole's. It's this crispy, delicious, seasoned, tender, juicy chicken breast that -- instead of being sandwiched between two pieces of dry biscuit -- is sprinkled with the most delectable and succulent chunks of biscuit (definitely a knife & fork kind of situation), BACON PIECES, and this wonderful and somehow not overly sweet maple syrup. Are you going to order this? Someone in your group needs to order this. Everyone is going to want a bite and I will absolutely not judge you for not wanting to share. 

I wish that I could give you a robust description of the burger, but my loving and wonderful husband who typically shares EVERYTHING went full Gollum with this burger. I swear it was gone before I even thought of asking for a bite. I did manage to get a forkful of melted brie that had been abandoned at the bottom of his plate along with a bit of the burger juice and it tasted amazing. If the afterthought of the burger is amazing, I can only imagine how good the actuality of it is. I can't fathom being disappointed by anything on this menu. I kind of feel like Gordon Ramsey has donned an alternate persona in order to escape his celebrity and is in the kitchen at Cole's. You pretty much just need to go there. Tonight."}
{"text":"Stopped in last night and had dinner with my parents and their friends while I was in town visiting.  What a great new spot for Amherst! First off, the beer selection is top notch.  They had drafts from many of Ohio's great microbreweries as well as several out of town seasonals.  The bartenders we're pretty knowledgeable about the various brands they had in the cooler too, good on you guys!  The cocktail list is pretty classy and well put together if you're a liquor person.  I watched them make a bourbon concoction with egg whites and was tempted to give that a go, maybe next time.  On to the food! I ordered the potato bombs and the Buffalo wing things for my appetizer and the chef's special Salmon Steak with linguine as my entree.  All I can say is wow! The potato bombs are a mashup between a hush puppy and garlic mashed potatoes deep fried and slathered in a garlic aoli sauce. The wings didn't taste like any chicken wing I've ever had. They were dark meat pieces I almost thought were duck, the sauce and the glaze were awesome. The salmon was flaky and perfectly cooked and sat on a bed of linguine with capers and lemon/tomato sauce.  Overall, I was with a group of 8 and nobody had any complaints and everyone truly enjoyed their meal.  Kudos to Cole's for bringing an upscale dining experience to downtown Amherst, we'll definately be back!"}
{"text":"Went on a whim as we were huge fans of the previous restaurant located here. The menu is not very extensive. To be honest there were only maybe three entrees I would try. However, the meal I did have, the Flat Iron Steak, was amazing! The steak was so tender and seasoned perfectly. Had the chocolate cake for dessert. Have to say that we will most certainly be going back."}
{"text":"First time eating here. The seasonal salad has fresh cranberries but they were sour and didn't pair well with the salad. The meatloaf and mash was very good but it was a small portion but cost equaled portion.  Plenty for me but may not for most.  Th burger was the best at our table.  The french fries are potato sticks but I liked them. The 3 small trio of cupcakes was $7 and they were not good very dense and dry.  Service was very good.  Not sure we will come back. 50/50."}
{"text":"The quality of the food was phenomenal, the service was great, and the atmosphere was very comfortable. This is definitely a new favorite restaurant of mine."}
{"text":"The menu looked very good with several unique options. 
For a drink I ordered a Buffalo Bourbon Sour...Very good. 
If the dining experience would had ended there it would had a good rating.
The server told us about a 22oz Porterhouse Steak as a chefs special. My son and myself decided to split it.
Both my Mom and Daughter ordered short rib pierogies. Two others had a flat iron steak.

Seven of the nine meals came out in a timely manner.

After several more minutes the Porterhouse Steak which we ordered came out well done so I asked for one that was medium as I ordered.

The pierogies were best described as rubbery.

When my second Steak came out after everyone had finished their meal it was more rare than medium. And was best described as \"OK\" and nothing special.
I do want to say our server was very good and efficient.
I was excited initially because of the reviews I saw on Yelp to go here for my birthday dinner but I'm thinking this was my last visit."}
{"text":"What a find! We were traveling from Detroit to Cleveland and yelp steered us here!  It was amazing! We took recommendations on the goat cheese and the apple Brie burger. Everything was fabulous. And so reasonable. Worth a trip."}
{"text":"WooHoo for Cole's service.  I was just able to order a gift card and have it  sent!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time. Seeing 4.9 stars recommended isn't common. So me and my husband went... 

The words I would use to explain this place is strange and unique.

We were told to seat our selves, but weren't given a menu. Our server was great, Attentive, and informative.

I ordered a soup of the day... it was a Vietnamese Carrot soup... worth a try... spicy purée of carrot with pine nuts and sour cream ..... I ate some... had a grilled cheese (Brie *very fancy*) burger with. Bacon *the cheese was gooey, the burger was grilled but black on top* I ate 96 percent of it picking off the \"burnt\"... the fries hard and stiff*didnt touch them* hubby had the meatloaf and mash (no complaints)

Oh and the take out boxes are Chinese food carriers...

Like I said strange but unique.

Not my particular style. But may be yours."}
{"text":"The food was good and the wait staff was very nice. The restaurant was clean and in order which is what I  like to see. I will definitely be going back here to dine."}
{"text":"Amazing food and atmosphere, service is wondering and they have a wide range of beers and cocktails."}
{"text":"Another awesome place to eat in Amherst! My wife and I have been here a few times now and each has been a great experience. The staff is very friendly and helpful with suggestions. Prime rib is amazing! 

I actually met the owner by chance while he was at my neighbors. Great guy and you can tell he loves his work."}
{"text":"WOW! I'm glad we stumbled onto this gem. Fried goat cheese with tomato marmalade and beet chips can't get any better. Stuffed mushrooms were top notch. Spicy chicken with wasabi coleslaw was our favorite. Mac and cheese was good as was the meat loaf. We will certainly return. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"Super good, service very good,we will be back, try the meat loaf and chicken and waffles, outstanding"}
{"text":"One of my favorite new restaurants! The hubby and I saw this place just opened so we thought we would give it a try. We were quickly seated and greeted by our server. She was excited to work there and with her recommendations we had great drinks and food! The atmosphere is just right to sit back and relax and enjoy the time. I had the salmon and he had the pork belly (he stills talks about it over a month later) Two weeks later our friends tried the place And were also impressed with their meals. The prices are appropriate as well. I hope this place continues to be successful as I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"All I can say wow. A must do when you feel like popping over to Amherst. Wow wow! Roger is talented and passionate at making very uniquely created drinks that you typically only see in the big city. Also, everyone was very friend. The food was impeccable. Can't wait to return many many times over!!!!"}
{"text":"I had a Culinary Erection Thursday evening while at Cole's Public House. 
I had a Fabulous Entree that evening what I had real craving for.
It Was Fettuccini, Sausage, & Peppers & Onions this Fresh, Flavorful, Chunky Red Sauce.
The pasta, which is ALWAYS made fresh daily, was done PERFECTLY al dente.
The sausage, again house made fresh, very well seasoned & cooked beautifully. 
The peppers & onions still had a little crunch to them which is the way it should be. I almost got caught licking my bowl it was that Damn Good.
I travel 32 miles one way for a 
Fantastic Meal at Cole's Public House. 
It's ALWAYS WORTH IT  !!!
A Tip of the Torque to Chef Robbie & 
His OUTSTANDING Staff."}
{"text":"Good food. Good drink selection. Food is a little pricey for the atmosphere but it is good food. I hope that this place stays around as this location in downtown Amherst struggles sometimes.   I would also say that this restaurant is also very clean and everyone is very friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"Really impressed. Very sophisticated food. Great atmosphere. Very clean. Great service. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"This is my 3rd time coming here in 2 weeks. I absolutely love this place.  The food is great, service is excellent, and the prices are reasonably low for the high quality food you receive.  I have zero complaints.  I would definitely recommend this place for a nice evening out, or a casual dining experience."}
{"text":"This is a regular hangout for me now. The food is good. Salmon is delicious every time. The Bacon apple brie burger is scrumptious only thing that could make it better would be a fried egg. The brew selection is amazing... eat, drink and be merry!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Food was delicious - highly recommend the flank steak and salmon - cooked to perfection! Service was good and we'll be back next time we are in area!"}
{"text":"Great food, great drinks, and great people that work here. Never disappointed every time I come here. Menu changes seasonally. By far the best food in Amherst. I've heard people say it's pricey. You get what you pay for. If you want cheap go to Applebee's and get terrible food and terrible service. If you want actual food that isn't shipped in a plastic bag and packed with sodium to preserve then go here."}
{"text":"Food was amazing!!  I got the grilled cheese apple burger and fries that were delicious!  My husband had the onion soup and said it is one of the best he has ever had!  The beer selection is amazing as well. Great experience :)"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant!! Food is very good. The first time I was there, I ordered the salmon, which was served over steamed veggies with the most amazing sauce. Last night, I ordered the pasta carbonara and was delighted at the crispy tender pancetta. The service is friendly and prompt. Last night was my husband's first time there, and he was disappointed in the portion sizes. They are on the small side, but if you pair it with a good soup or salad, the portions are just right."}
{"text":"Delicious from scratch menu. Thoughtful and sustainable sourcing is a plus for our family! Most places have a menu of junk for kids; their kid's menu has hand breaded chicken tenders.... not the pressed frozen nuggets, for example. Salads are great, my husband loves the burgers."}
{"text":"Awesome apple brie burger with lyonnaise potatoes! New go to lunch, cool laidback atmosphere! Dig it"}
{"text":"The server was phenomenal and made our time at the restaurant enjoyable. The lunch selection was minimal and the kitchen did not have two of our desired dishes. The food was slow to come out and to make it worse, it was served at different times. The last dishes to come out - 15 minutes after the first was served - were salads."}
{"text":"1-14-17 so we tried Coles for the second time tonight and I was impressed. We sat at the bar and both bartenders were very helpful and friendly.  I had the special which was a strip steak with mushrooms, bacon and spinach and it was very tasty.  My girlfriend had a few starters (steak skewers and fries) and they were good too. She ordered a desert as well, some mini cupcakes from a bakery in Lorain, and they were delish. The first time we tried Coles I was not that impressed but tonight changed my mind."}
{"text":"1st time here and won't be the last. Food was amazing and service couldn't be better."}
