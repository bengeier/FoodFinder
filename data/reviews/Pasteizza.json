{"text":"I love coming to this little gem for a casual dinner out. I've had some of the best service of my life from the friendly staff, and I have never ordered a meal I didn't like. My husband and I often order the special, which comes with a glass of wine and a soup or salad starter. We are ways leave full and happy."}
{"text":"Not a terrible experience but I do have a list of things I'm not entirely happy with.  On the plus side, friendly staff, hot buns served promptly.    This place looks more like a resto-bar than a restaurant.  No table cloths, bare decor, big tv screens on sports channels, very prominent bar in the middle of the room, lamps with large coil CFL bullbs giving a very harsh lighting.  Not really anything to associate with Italy at all. And Pasteizza sounds more German than Italian - is it pronounced \"pash-TIE-tza\"?  I usually order seafood pasta when I'm at an Italian restaurant because it's something I don't often cook at home.  Normally it's a thin white sauce with clams, mussels, calamari over a linguini. The sauce is light and buttery so as not to overpower the delicate seafood flavours.  What I got tonight, instead, was a very sweet cloying strange kind of rosee sauce over some shrimp (with tails still in the shell), and three crab claw tips which I could barely get the meat out of, lacking any kind of crab implement in which to pick at them with.  This was over fettucini, instead of linguini. My fork was ineffective.  Aside from the sweet flavour, I got very little flavour from the sauce but it was enough to drown whatever seafood I got.     I chose the house white (since everyone but me ordered a special which came with a glass of wine), which ended up being again too sweet and didn't match the dish.  This is a restaurant that West Montrealers would probably flock to as it's close to them, but not a place I'd go out of my way to return to."}
{"text":"This is a cozy neighborhood spot full of locals. I happened to find it as I was invited by a local to dine here. The place is smallish and fills up to a comfortable level, it seems that they have a lot of repeat business which says a lot about the place. I loved their french fries!! Hubs loved his pizza! The house salad was good but nothing spectacular. The food here had a real home made feel to it.   If you're in the area, check it out for sure!"}
{"text":"Funny, I'm the 2nd review, and I'm also Californian!  My mother lives nearby, and we passed it, and decided to give it a try because it looks popular.    It's not much to look at.  Pretty down-scale decor, with big oversized signs in the window. But the fact that it appears busy regularly with locals confirms my own taste, too. It was exceptionally good, and extremely reasonably priced.    I had the pasta/ pizza combo, go about $14.  A small simple-ish pizza, with fairly limited ingredients, and fairly simple marinara pasta (as part of the combo deal).  Yet, it was really good delicious pizza, thin crust, excellent crust, actually.  And the pasta was above average.  Not as good as the arrabiatta pasta my mother ordered, which was superb.     So, the fee of us ate for $27 before (exorbitant Quebec) taxes.    Recommended.  Don't let the functional decor dissuade you.  Oh, and the server!  I LOVE her. She's young, thoughtful, very competent.  I wish I knew her name.  What a lovely lady.  She had long hair.  Now it's so short, she couldn't be more gracious."}
{"text":"I bring my kids here often. Good local restaurant. In terms of food, they haven't reinvented the wheel. Pizza good, wings great, hamburgers fresh, Greek ok! It's a versatile place. Probably not the place you bring someone on a first date though."}
{"text":"My husband & I were regular customers, but not anymore.  Prices not so reasonable contrary to my initial review, Management increased the prices over the board for everything. They also recently started to charge .50 cents for extra dinner rolls. HUGE TURN OFF.   I agree with Sun b. For the new prices, the decor & food is not good enough for what they charge. We won't go back again."}
