{"text":"We heard about Amano on Nextdoor and decided to give it a try. The staff was very friendly and welcoming as well as the restaurant was clean and nicely decorated. We ordered 2 pizzas and both were delicious. We can't wait to dine in and order one of the other items on the menu. This place is a must eat. You will not regret it!!"}
{"text":"Good: - take out desserts - Maple braised rabbit gnocchi  Bad - not child friendly (no booster seats, plastic plates/cups) - server was slow & almost non-existent until others kicked in - take out items can be pricey"}
{"text":"Best Italian food I've ever ate.Highly recommend eating there the food is all fresh and cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"The service was outstanding and the food quality was like  an Italian Mom made it. Food was delicious and the atmosphere was intimate. Perfect for family or a date night.  The prices were very reasonable too. I highly suggest this place!"}
{"text":"Was planning on dining in but we didn't have reservations so we opted for take out. Ordered the New Yorker pizza, Risotto balls and garlic knots. All were tasty! I thought the pizza size was on the small size for the price.  If you go on Sat night make reservations!"}
{"text":"Delicious and cozy Italian deli/restaurant.  Everything made \"in-house\" and you can really taste the freshness.  Friendly staff, great neighborhood restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm usually a 5 Star or a 1 Star rater .. however I have high hopes for this pizzeria to be my new delivery go to.   The \"regular\" cheese pizza was very good. Very close to a New York pie. However, the white pizza lacked a little pizzazz. It was a little bland, too little if not any garlic. Will try again and request basil instead of arugula. I say give this place a try if you're shopping for your new regular pizza delivery joint."}
{"text":"I was very unimpressed with this place.   I didn't feel the food was restaurant quality.  The salad was full of spinach (I love spinach) with the stems still attached and the dressing that comes with it is in a small candle holder."}
{"text":"Great pizza. Sauce is really nice. It was herby but still tasted like fresh tomatoes. Crust is not as thick as I like, but it was still delicious. Found my new local pizza spot."}
{"text":"Ambient little place that you wouldn't know by looking from the outside signage! Very romantic, ambient, and yet very family friendly atmosphere. I enjoyed all of it - great customer service, attentive, fun, and personality plus! We ordered the charcuterie tray, the Cindy pizza, and a side of meatballs, and all of it was insanely delicious! This is a true Italian restaurant, cozy and delicious. The dessert was amazing, my husband ordered the lemon mascarpone cheesecake and I ordered the Italian Rainbow cake. It did not disappoint. Las Vegas, you have an amazing hidden Italian restaurant right under your nose. :-)"}
{"text":"I am so grateful for this place. This is the kind of restaurant I've been looking for in Vegas. I love the menu's uniqueness and variety. The food was on point. The pizza was amazing. You can tell they enjoy what they do and put care into it by their attention to detail."}
{"text":"Pizza was beyond good the crust alone was heaven  the pineapples were really sweet and the pizza was very flavorful will be ordering from here again nice to bite into anpiecenofnpie and not get a mouth full of grease like at Pizza hut and and other pizza places this is my families new delivery spot"}
{"text":"Rustic | Cafe | Pasta | Wine | Union Station | Casual | Fresh pasta  Review based on a Saturday visit.  Casual Italian restaurant offering fresh pasta and cafe options inside Union Station.   Store front offers Italian sandwiches and cafe options. Deeper inside the restaurant is a sit down restaurant offering Italian meals.  House Wine $8 Red Nice blend of Cabernet and Shiraz. A good pick me up and not a bad house wine.  Fat Tube (Rigatoni) $18 Nice and hot. Good portion. Pasta made al dente. Not an overwhelming amount of meat.  Black Trumpet (Campanella) $24  Came hot to the taste. Crunchy texture by bread crumbs. Topped with finely chopped chives. Supposed to be dungeness crab but don't really see or taste it. I do taste the fishyness in the pasta though.  Environment: Clean single stall unisex bathrooms.  Soothing casual music."}
{"text":"Great Italian food. Always ordered delivery need to stop in and check out the ambiance"}
{"text":"As much as I don't want to tell anyone how good this place is, they more than earned a review plus I need to be sure that they get enough business so they don't have problems!  We went there last Friday night early, and the place was quiet.. but I saw a bunch of delivery orders heading out and more people came streaming in before long. The dining room isn't  huge but it's clean and nicely decorated. It was nice to see a small restaurant that didn't look like the owner's toddlers painted the place.  Staff was very friendly and attentive, and our waitress (Shannon) was a treat. We ordered and were served bread and butter for our wait.  Hubby ordered their Rosemary-infused lemonade and absolutely loved it. It was too tart for my tastes, but he was in heaven.  Hubby's entree was a special, black squid ink risotto with shrimp & crawfish, I think. He ate all he could and finished up the rest for a midnight snack. It was tasty, and the $16.99 price was surprisingly low. I'm more used to specials being sold for monster amounts but this was in line with the rest of their menu.  He also got a house salad with Shannon's homemade dressing and it was really good.  Additionally, he got a serving of Tiramisu that he ate later... and said that it was the best he'd ever had.  I absolutely had to try the stromboli! I used to get one at a place that dropped it when new owners took over and I've been searching for a worthy replacement. Too many places think it's okay to fill a stromboli with pizza toppings but Amano got it right and it was excellent! I got the small and couldn't even eat half, the leftovers were lunch for both of us the next day. It was overfilled with mozzarella, totally epic. Plus, the marinara sauce was thick and yummy with the right balance of acidity.  We loved this restaurant enough that we ordered subs for pick up two days later. Hubby got the Spicy Italian and I got the Italian Combo. He didn't think his sub was particularly spicy but it was still rather tasty.   Mine was excellent, and those subs are a ridiculous size! I could only eat 1/4 of my sub, and then another 1/4 the next day.  I particularly enjoyed the toasted baguette, it was just the right amount of crunch while leaving the bulk of it soft.  Hubby also just HAD to get another serving of Tiramisu and managed to eat it without losing his smile.  Yelpers can get a free cannoli for checking in here. I'm not a dessert person nor a fan of cannoli  (I know, heretic!) but I'm willing to bet that it's an excellent cannoli.  They also sell bulk meats, cheeses, salads, cookies, etc from a display by the door.   The restaurant is located in the inside corner of a small L shaped strip mall at the NW corner of Tenaya and Ann Road (access on Tenaya). Trust me, their quality belongs in a nicer location than a strip mall but you won't be thinking of that once you're inside.   I overheard the parties from 2 other tables talking about how awesome their pizza is so I think I might order that for delivery tonight. After all, it's been a week and I'm starting to have withdrawal symptoms!"}
{"text":"Figured we try it after looking at the yelp reviews. I had the Pumpkin Parmesan and my husband had the chicken cacciatore. Both were very good. We also had the Rosemary Garlic knots which are tasty.  Nice option for some good Italian food in the NW"}
{"text":"Arrived for a late lunch.  Ordered the Cindy pizza and it was a delicious combination of flavors.  Hubby loved the rice balls and the meatballs.  Glass of wine would have been nice but alcohol is not available so we ordered the rosemary infused lemonade and it was  refreshing.  For Dessert the lemon marscapone cheesecake.... so good.  Friendly staff.  Deli items looked amazing.  Look forward to returning and trying out more of the menu."}
{"text":"Amano is amazing! Shout out to David V and Suki K for introducing me to this spot. They planned a group dinner here where we were able to meet with Chef Jay and try several of their best dishes. When you first come in, the space looks like a takeout joint, but hang a right and there's the dining room.   The dish that most piqued my interest is the Pumpkin Parmigiana, featuring layers of lightly-fried pumpkin in place of the usual eggplant, layered with mozzarella and marinara. It is crispy, gooey perfection, and Chef Jay must be my spirit animal because his namesake sandwich on the lunch menu also features the fried gourd that I love so much!  Other dishes we tried were the arancini (rice balls), Braciole (rolled flank steak), and one of their pizzas- the Cindy, which riffs on the bacon wrapped date app that so many people love. Add in caramelized onion and a bit of pesto to add flavor and cut the sweetness, throw it all on a fresh, chewy pie, and there you go. It's dreamy, and the fact that it's named after a customer is a cool touch, too!.  Come hungry, because they also have some stellar desserts- you can get a cannoli (with both chocolate and pistachio!) free with Yelp check in, or try their Rainbow Cake (based on the famous cookie). Or, if you're too full, just get your sugar fix from their awesome house rosemary lemonade- I didn't initially think this would go with an Italian dinner, but I couldn't stop sipping!  Looking forward to coming back soon to try the Chef Jay sando and the Chef's Favorite Pizza (white pie with mushrooms and truffle oil, yes please)."}
{"text":"Fantastic!!!! My wife and I went in yesterday afternoon. Enjoyed how small the dining room was, although they will probably be expanding very soon because the food was that good. Service was excellent Everything is made in house, and the pride shows! The chicken parm was great. Love the pizza crust. And you have to try the rosemary lemonade!!! We have found our new Italian restaurant. I waited to write this until today because I wanted to do the \"cold pizza for breakfast\" test..... EXCELLENT"}
{"text":"Very good restaurant with reasonable prices. There was something different about the dough and sauce that really set this place apart from your average Italian place. The menu had some creative options, and the service was top notch."}
{"text":"Let's be real for a second..Truly good pizza is not the easiest to find, but Amano will stop the search for your new go to pizza joint. They also have a pretty extensive menu of pasta dishes and dinner dishes, though I did not try them when I was there. My family and I walked in on a Saturday night looking for a table for 5. We were immediately greeted and seated by a gentleman working behind the counter. Their dining space is small and intimate, but still a good space for a large group. Shannon was our waitress and she was honestly great. She made suggestions when we asked about different foods and wasn't that over the top, annoying, wannabe nice waitress that I seem to find too often in Vegas. Moving on. We ordered the Chef's Special Pizza, garlic knots, and goat cheese and beet salad. ALL OF IT WAS GOOD. The salad ingredients were fresh, the chef's special pizza had a perfect crust and delicious truffle oil on it, and the garlic knots were straight out of the oven. For dessert, my husband ordered the Cannoli. They come in a set of three and had this yummy, light filling. I usually refuse to eat cannolis because they're too heavy, but these were great.   P.S. they do currently deliver, though they will only go within a 5 mile radius. Just something to keep in mind if you're hoping for delivery.    See you all soon!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is in a funky/convenient location and had a really welcoming/comfortable atmosphere. The pasta lacked a bit of seasoning but the desserts were fantastic, try the cheesecake! The waitress was lovely and very helpful. The chef also checked up on us to see how we enjoyed the meal."}
{"text":"Very impressed! In the underground path of Toronto's Union Station sits an adorable fresh pasta place that is worth the visit. Food was delicious, service fantastic and prices all reasonable. They also have an amazing grab and go counter for take out orders and various other Italian fare.   Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Sunday Gravy.  Dinner after 4pm.  Great portions, great value, great taste!    You have two choices: $29 or $39.  The latter includes a shared appetizer board and cannolis for dessert.    Board:  Broccoli and cheese: Delicious.  Arancini stuffed with cheese and pear: Good but maybe a tad under-seasoned.  Burrata: Very Good. Potatoes and mushrooms: Delicious.   Fried Smelts: Delicious.    Salad: Good. Pasta: Delicious.   Meatballs: Very Good. Ribs: Very Good. Osso buco: Good but maybe a tad tougher than I'd prefer.   Extra sauce: Delicious.   Bone Marrow: Delicious.    Cannoli: Delicious. Assorted Chocolates: Delicious.    Look at that list!  I was quite surprised the restaurant wasn't busier because of this fantastic menu and variety of offerings!    If you're in the downtown area on a Sunday, I would definitely recommend this place for dinner!    Last thing: Half-priced bottles of wine!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were here a few weeks ago for dinner.  We enjoyed our dinner.  The couple near us, not so much.  The waitress screwed up their order and just didn't get anything right.  They did try to fix it and offer free dessert.  We would go back based on our food and experience.  That is why it is not 5 stars since we experienced the drama behind us."}
{"text":"The owner actually called me and called me a \"PIece of S***\"and told me to go \"F***myself\". That was because his driver was already 45 minutes late and I didn't want to accept COLD FOOD. I never even got to taste the food but I bet it tastes like crap considering how the owner treats his customers!!!  I love that you are lying about what happened now. Mary you were not even involved!!! Delivery time I was told was 30 minutes!!! I have that email if you'd like to see it, after an hour and a half, still no food, so how was that in your delivery time you gave?? Your OWNER called me and harassed me, I would love to provide the recording I have!!!! All of my information was provided, I have never had an issue with food getting delivered to me, maybe it's just that you are all to incompetent!! My apartment complex doesn't even have 1,000 units, just another lie of yours!!! I also have a screenshot of the 3 times your owner called me to threaten me and harass me to go with the recording I have!!!! Thanks for at least not making up a lie about your owner not calling me and saying all those kind things!!! I am completely at peace because I know I am telling the COMPLETE TRUTH AND HAVE EVIDENCE TO BACK IT UP, you and your owner can keep telling LIES because he doesn't know what he is doing or how to run a business. I'm sorry you work for someone so incompetent, but don't lower yourself to his standards. Have a great weekend!!!"}
{"text":"This is an amazing restaurant. The pasta is fresh and the pizza is great. I ate here 2 nights in a row and both meals made me feel like I was living overseas again. I recommend the Cindy pizza and baked ziti."}
{"text":"For some fabulous old school Italian food this tiny  Italian restaurant is a  hidden gem!!!! The sweetest wait staff, the food absolutely amazing and the atmosphere very charming. I could swear I was at my Grandmothers eating her lasagna and meatballs! A-Mano is a must! Remember to eat slow to savor every bite! You truly will not be disappointed at all!!!"}
{"text":"I had a favorite neighborhood Italian restaurant, but then Amano moved in about a half mile closer to my house with a great menu and more vegetarian options. The chef-owner trained at the Culinary Institute of America and has an impressive resume.   I've eaten the pumpkin parmigiana and eggplant rollatini, so I can thoroughly recommend both dishes with a side of pasta and delicious bread to soak up any extra tomato sauce. A simple cheese pizza ordered for my daughter was also very good, so I wouldn't hesitate to order one of the more creative options.  I haven't tried any of the house made desserts, so I feel like I should order the whole dessert menu to make up for that."}
{"text":"Eggplant parm Meatball sub 6 cookies 1 Slice pizza 1 Ceaser salad = $30 Great price we thought!  Everything including service excelled! Such a cute classy little place to dine in for a romantic dinner or to-go or delivery.   Im from Seattle just visiting, discovered this place on Instagram!"}
{"text":"Favorite Italian place! A hidden gem! We randomly found while waiting for my car to get fixed. Their house dressing on their salad is so flavorful. The 2 slice and soda combo for $5.95 come with huge slices. My husband got the small calzone which was more than enough for 2 people. You could tell everything was made fresh right when we ordered it. I wish we lived on this side of town so we could visit more often, but worth the trip trust me."}
{"text":"This was hands down the best pasta and pizza, my wife and I have indulged in. Everything is made fresh from the penne pasta, sauce to the the dough of the pizza. It's a hole in the wall where it is filled with amazing flavors."}
{"text":"I want here with a party of six. We had excellent service. The food was amazing. The rosemary garlic knots are absolutely to die for. The venison was very tender and fresh. The pizza crust literally melts in your mouth. I'm really happy to a found this place -- more exciting is that it's locally owned! The decor for dining in is clean and modern."}
{"text":"Delicious food and fresh pasta.  Had the salami starter and stracietella app.  Inventive and flavourful.  Exciting to be at the bar to see all the action.  Had the pesto bow tie and Dungeness crab pasta.  So good and fresh.  Even put dabs of bomba sauce for a kick!  And the cannoli was out of this world as they made the pastry in house.  Will be back here again with besties for a delicious bowl of pasta!"}
{"text":"The BF passed by this place after they had recently opened and brought home a pizza for dinner. It was good, but the highlight was the fried mozzarella. Usually you get sticks or triangles when you order these delightful little treats but what a surprise to see that Amano slices fresh mozzarella, breads them and fries them! OMG! The homemade creamy pesto that comes with it is great and honestly I was using the leftover amount for dipping my pizza crust. Great little new gem and hoping we can visit for dinner soon!"}
{"text":"First time to Amano and loved it!  Shannon, our waitress, was lovely and very friendly.  The pizza crust was perfect and all the ingredients were so fresh especially the sauce.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"I will start off saying that I would rate btwn 3-4.  We enjoyed dinner of a Saturday night Atmosphere: this is a lovely little place in Union Station, and I love the fact toronto is making this a destination! It lighting and decor were comfortable and light  Service: I regret forgetting the name of the our server, but she was great! She good genuine interest in the food, and clearly explained dishes and specials.  Recommended great apps and mains .  food:  if your hungry, the portion sizes are on the smaller size. Good enough to finish and not take home, but room for more perhaps.  We stared with arincini balls a serving of 3. These were 3 little gooey cheese delights! You have to try them with their hot sauce! We also tried the melon and prosciutto. This was also a nice fresh app, light on the melon though.  For mains , we got the \"fat tubes\" and the tagliatelle with the 24hour cooked beef shoulder ragu. Both pastas were cooked el denté and both felt light , given it's fresh on site creating. The fat tubes with Bolognese sauce was delicious! Meaty and flavourful (sometimes I struggle with bologene because some are way too tomatoey), this was very tasty The tagliatelle pasta was very light flavour- a little underwhelming for the $22 price  Decent house wine for $8 for 5oz glass Over all, would hope for very slightly larger portion for dinner , and maybe a little more .. something. But overall an enjoyable eve"}
{"text":"\"By hand\", literally is what Amano translates to, and you would be hard pressed to find anything remotely close to the quality of taste and freshness this restaurant offers.    We ordered the Cindy, the fennel wings and the rice balls, which were all outstanding!!  Allen, whom I believe is the manager, consistently checked us and answered any and all questions we had.  He made our experience ever the much better, and made us feel as if we were family.    The only one thing that I don't like about this place is how far it is from where I live (California).  I guess I may have to consider a move to LV."}
{"text":"Was visiting friends in Vegas and I am from New York and know good pizza and Italian food!. The pizza was delicious with a good crust and the braciole was amazing! A very cute spot for a date night and the service and ambiance were excellent and the grandmas chocolate cake was the best I ever had!  Will definitely be back when I am in Vegas next."}
{"text":"Conveniently situated inside union station. The ambiance was warm and comfortable. Service was good and attentive.  Appetizer (under the \"Shoot first Ask Questions Later\" section) Snapper Crudo was not bad with the pickled mussels and yoghurt dill, the small pickled mussels were nice addition to the dish, at least it's different from the good old boring smoked salmon.   I've ordered the Black Trumpets (under the \"Not your Nona's pasta\" section) the pancetta were a bit over powering and maybe more crab will help. It was way too salty at first but the waitress was helpful and provided me with a new dish that is less salty.    I've also tried the fat tube rigatoni (under the Pasta staples section), with Ontario beef bolognese. Not bad. The beef was nicely done. In comparison, the ragotoni tasted much better than the Black Trumpets.  Happy Endings:   Stuffed Pastry (Canoli) mascarpone, white chocolate, candied citrus. I usually don't like desserts because my mentality is that any extra calories I can take in, I rather save my quota for savoury food or more seafood. I was never a huge fan of canoli. But this one was beautifully done. ($4) The mascarpone tasted very fresh, almost felt like ice cream inside. The pastry texture was good, not too soft, nicely done and tasty!"}
{"text":"I had the New Yorker pizza and it was outstanding. Really one of the best pizzas I have had.  Can't quite rate it 5 stars because the price was a little on the high end. But the large was filling enough for my wife and I to have for dinner and lunch the next day.  I will definitely be back and am really glad I tried this place. Some of the other pizzas on the menu seemed a little too bizarre for me to try the first time around but I will be more adventurous next time."}
{"text":"Good homemade pasta in the Union Station. Went on a Thursday at 4 pm and ordered the papardelle with house wine and a cannoli. House wine was really good, light and refreshing wine for a mid weekday lunch. Papardelle was a really smooth but perfectly achieved taste. Did not like the cannoli, the filling was to salty and not creamy as a normal cannoli. I think they did it with just plain ricotta, I don't even think it had sugar on it. 4 stars because dessert was not worth it."}
{"text":"I went to Amano about a month ago and have been meaning to write a message of praise ever since! My family ended up there one night while we were out shopping in the area and needed someplace to grab a bite. We found Amano and thought \"Hey, let's give something new a try\". Upon entering, we passed through a small deli and desserts counter and were walked to our table in a dim but warmly lit dining space. I think it's worth mentioning here that the room is tastefully decorated with simple gold accented pieces and very simply elegant. The menu featured a selection of items that are relatively modestly priced and all sound very tempting. We ended up getting the Cindy pizza, the beet and goat cheese salad, and some carbonara pasta. I was really pleasantly surprised by the presentation of the dishes. Even the side salad that came with my pasta was very thoughtfully dished, I was impressed. All this to say that the food itself was excellent and really hit the spot. We've ordered takeout from Amano a handful of times since our visit, and i've been itching to go back!"}
{"text":"Wonder staff, great food, and an owner who truly appreciates his customers is what you will find at Amano! We decided to try it tonight and it was the best meal we have had in recent memory. We had the rosemary lemonade which was amazing and we also had the bacon and egg pizza. The egg was so good it's all my 21 month old wanted so the owner made him a bowl of scrambled eggs. We cannot wait to return and enjoy another meal at Amano!!!!"}
{"text":"This place was ok. A few friends & I stopped to have dinner and ordered pizza & apps. The server was too much...kept coming back to the table too many times and overly trying to please us but we were trying to visit & enjoy our time with our friends. Pizza was ehh...asked for extra cheese light sauce. No extra cheese. Dough was good. Then, after our meal we tried to get the free canoli by checking in & 2 out of 4 of us did & we got 1 baby canoli. Ok! Wonder why the dining room was empty! Best part is we were asked to leave because they were closed now. Which I honestly get but the way this server was just like I said. Too much."}
{"text":"I was introduced to Amano by fellow Yelpers right after they opened and I have been back a few times since.  They are located off of Ann, Teneya, near the 95 in a very small shopping center. It's a very small place- feels crowded and not romantic at all.  I think in the future take out or delivery would be the way I order from Amano. One thing that throws my senses off is the music. In the entrance/kitchen there is one type of music playing, then in the dining area there is another type playing and they are both really loud so my ears don't know what to do with battle of boomboxes. I ordered the Cindy once which has some many flavors, I think it is meant to be shared, because after one piece I was overwhelmed and had to take the rest home. I will stick to plain pepperoni next time. The crust and sauce are very flavorful- adding a pow! to the pizza. When you go, make sure to order the lemonade with rosemary, again something that should be shared. I finished the entire carafe and I felt a sugar rush afterwards. I do wonder why Amano serves their beverages in plastic cups? On my first visit I sampled the pumpkin parmigiana and it was so good. It made my belly happy. I would recommend it. Give Amano a try and see for yourself what they have to offer."}
{"text":"I was very impressed by their menu, mostly because they seem to actually know what Italian food is. I was excited to read the description for their Italian grinder thinking this will be my new place, but was disappointed at the meat selection, or lack of (why ham and not prosciutto??).  Luckily they have all the meats to make a good grinder, but I quickly realized an authentic Italian was going to cost close to a thousand dollars.   Anyway, the slices we did get were alright - a little greasy but not bad, the crust was good but alone it has a weird flavor of flour maybe, the sauce was good.  Unfortunately they got our toppings wrong.  Neither of us finished our second slice (which is so weird, especially for the pizza lover in the group). I wanted dessert but was hesitant because I'm often disappointed in Italian sweets, I thought about the chocolate cake but for $7 it wasn't worth the risk.  As it was 4 slices and a cesar salad somehow came to $25? That's only slightly less than a whole pie at most places."}
{"text":"Just found this adorable neighborhood gem. Tried their meatball and Italian combo sandwiches and neither disappoint. The bread is phenomenal just what you'd want at an Italian Deli. Do yourself a favor and sit inside. It is quaint and lovely. Our server Michael was awesome and is one of the many reasons we'll be back."}
{"text":"We got takeout from her last night and I am pretty impressed! You can tell the ingredients are quality and the taste was outstanding, which made the slightly high price worth it to me.  I tried the Cindy...WOW... even with takeout the bacon was crispy, crust cooked to perfection... all the flavors blended perfectly. Tasted exactly how I imagined based on the menu description. I also tried the fresh fried cheese, which was unique take on fried cheese sticks. They were good, but at $10 for 4 pieces, I would not get again. The sauces they came with were absolutely delicious. My husband had a cheese and sausage pizza which he also liked a lot. You can taste the love in their cooking and we will definitely be back to try some more menu items!"}
{"text":"Holy cow! I went to this place very hopeful!  The positive reviews are initially what brought me and someone at work actually recommended this place as one of the best pizza places that they've ever been to in Las Vegas. I am currently rethinking my friendship with this person.  Disclaimer: I absolutely love pizza.   \"What does that even mean Dee? Everybody loves pizza.\"   No, people like pizza, they may even enjoy pizza.   But Pizza is my desert island food.   I would even go so far as to consider myself a pizza connoisseur. I have recently come back from a trip to New York where I literally walked from the bottom of the city towards the top for hours trying different slices of pizza.  Every meal I had during a 3 day trip consisted of pizza. That's true commitment.   Anyway, I had just had a long day snowboarding and was craving some of that New York style pizza so I went to Amano's.  Anyone who says that this pizza tastes like New York pizza is one of two things:  A filthy liar or someone who is never actually been to New York or even been in the same room as an NY slice.   To keep it simple, this pizza tasted like cafeteria pizza. It reminded me of that square cut of pizza you got in elementary school but you have now finally graduated to having a crust with it.   The cheese was so rubbery and had that \"fake cheese\" taste. (You know what I'm talking about.)  This place single-handedly made me create a \"try a slice first and then go for another\" rule for myself because now I am stuck with two slices of cafeteria pizza. Bleh. Pass."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The staff are very friendly and the food is terrific. We couldn't decide what to order, so we just ordered everything. Veal Parmesano was tender and delicious. The egg plant Parmesano was cooked perfectly. The calamari is seasoned well and crisp, the meat and cheese board was off the hook, and the New Yorker pizza was outstanding. Definitely a new favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"Great new pizza place in the NW. We wanted to try a new place. Yelp helped us out! It's actually an Italian restaurant and deli but we just did take out that day. We'll be back to try out the rest of their dishes soon and based on my mother in laws review the eggplant parm sandwich will be one of the things I order next."}
{"text":"Found this little treasure of a restaurant through Yelp and what a find. First order was for a pizza called the Cindy; what a delicious pie. Next we did a dine in with close friends and all of us were pleased with everything. I now officially have a little romance with this little joint and I'm a bit hesitant to share because I want to keep it to myself."}
{"text":"Back again baby, within 2 weeks. It's going to suck going to the gym tomorrow. Anyway,  this place is good. Crust, good flavor, cheese on point and the service is excellent. I recommend the Super Cheesy, and the Rice Balls (Risotto rolled in herb cheese stuffing) served with marinara. Delish!"}
{"text":"This place doesn't seem like anything special from outside but inside it's a quaint nicely decorated warm and inviting joint. You can take out or dine in. There is even a little Italian deli. Everything is made in house even the desserts. The food was delicious and reasonable priced. I would definitely recommend this place and I will definitely be going there again and again."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Great and fast service. Very fresh handmade pasta. It is right inside Union Square near CN Tower and Air Canada center. I would recommend for anyone visiting toronto to check out this place."}
{"text":"My family and I won't eat any other pizza, now that we have tasted the New Yorker.  It was so delicious from the very first bite.  I had commented on how good the crust was and our waitress told us it takes 3 days to make it.  We also had the stuffed mushrooms which were fantastic!  I will always order lemonade and cannoli everytime I go.  Look forward to trying other dishes.  Thank you Chef Jay and staff for your friendly service."}
{"text":"Lovely new restaurant in Union Station.  Finally the construction in Union finished something.   Cozy environment and food is nice. Some seating can be really dimly lighted.  Overall we enjoyed our night."}
{"text":"Thought the food was A-OK for its price. We didn't realize the restaurant was located just inside union station. We tried using Google Maps and of course had trouble looking for it. A good place to go if you're planning on watching on concert at the ACC before hand. Reservations were made so we had a table ready for us in the evening. The green shell pasta tasted better than all of the other pastas I've tried from my friends which includes maple braised rabbit gnocci. Thought the portions were relatively small so I def had to fill up on dessert. The panna cotta was a bit sour but it was enough to fill up my appetite that evening."}
{"text":"Our third time here and it gets better every time! Ordered pizza, Stromboli, meatballs, garlic knots, housemade rosemary lemonade, lasagna, spag and meatballs, meatball sub... never disappointed! Check in on yelp and get a free cannoli!   The pics are from our first visit and we ate our food so quickly the other times that I didn't get take a pics!   PS - I just ordered the lemon mascarpone cheesecake to go"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Las Vegas and the owners are very very nice,this is my new favorite spot in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Great pizza! I loved the Carnivore and the Marianna. Sharing it with friends was the icing on the cake."}
{"text":"Walked in and we were greeted by the chef/owner. They obviously love food and take so much care creating a unique menu. So many delicious choices. My daughter and I started with the fresh out of the oven bread and whipped butter and Rosemary Lemonade. You must order this! We ordered the Rice Balls-risotto fried and presented in marinara and topped with cheese. It was so creamy and rich. I will go back to have another more \"exotic\" pizza (truffle oil OR clam next time???) but with my 10 year old we stuck with the white pizza. Alfredo sauce and cheese and cheese and cheese was so yummy. We got the chocolate cake to go because we wanted it so bad, but couldn't take another bite. The Chef came out to our table and told us about using his mother's recipe and how delicious it is. Definitely a winner! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"They have good food, and the place is close to where i work. When im hungry, i just go there and buy food."}
{"text":"The restaurant is located by the York street entrances to Union station, in the underground, just outside (north) of the GO train concourse. There is a decent amount of seating but I wouldn't say that it is good for large groups. Renovation was tastefully done and there's a good bit of charm despite the place being surrounded by construction and the remnants of the grimy Union station.  On to the food, the pasta is cooked perfectly and quite flavourful. I've a number of dishes. I wouldn't really endorse the lasagna; while it is unique with many thin layers of nicely cooked noodles, I found the flavour a bit one dimensional and lacking. Would have benefited from some veggies, or maybe even just some basil. Other than that though, every other entree was excellent. Appetizers are also pretty good. As for dessert, I've only tried the cannoli and can't say I found it to be anything special."}
{"text":"I saw the co-owner posted about their opening on The Next door app and thought I'd give it a try! It's a beautiful and quaint little place with about 8 tables. Our server Michael was fantastic. I saw the person next to me eating the Italian sub and I wanted a light(er) lunch so I decided to go with that. My husband had the 2 slices of pizza lunch combo. My 18 month old had the meatballs. The BEST thing was the bread, hands down. The sub roll and the pizza crust was amazing!!!! The pizza had a really good taste. I personally prefer my pizza crisper and ask for it \"well done\". I'll probably do this next time. The pepperoni on the pizza had a really good flavor and you could tell all the ingredients were high quality. The Italian sub definitely is a true grinder. Not sure why another review thought it wasn't. Again, it was very tasty and I could tell the cheese and meats were high quality. My son ate the meatballs and I tried one. They were delicious and we also ate the sauce with a spoon, it was so tasty! We also tried the cannolis. I do agree that $7 for two small cannolis is much even though they were very tasty. I didn't feel the other prices were unreasonable at all. I'm always willing to pay a little more for good quality food and to support local small businesses. Lastly, we brought out 18 month old who normally is really great in restaurants but today not so much. We didn't realize he was that tired. I REALLY appreciate Michael the waiter be so nice, patient and calm about my little one crying and wanting to walk around. We definitely would have left if the place was full, but we were the only ones there at the time. It means a lot to new parents that they don't feel shamed or unwanted when they have a crying baby. We'll definitely be back. I'm looking forward to trying the Stromboli, eggplant parm, eggplant rolitini and the pumpkin parm!!"}
{"text":"First  before I say what was wrong I do want to say the food is tasty. I ordered the braciole with spagetti and my husband ordered the veal marsala with spagetti. We also both ordered the calamari as appetizer. The calamari was perfect. Good thing we ordered two as usually we share an appetizer. The portions were too small in my opinion and we would not have been able to share one. The meals came and instead of spagetti we both got linguine. There is a difference between the two and we wanted spagetti not linguine. We didn't send it back because we did not want to wait. My husband's veal marsala was very tender but again a small portion about one and a half pieces of veal and too much marsala. His linguine came out in small salad bowl and really wasn't enough. Then came my braciole which I had been excited for. After my first taste I realized this was not made with flank steak as this is what it normally is made with. It just tasted like a slice of pot roast to me. My linguine was on my plate and it was triple the amount then my husband got with his meal. When ordering meals you would expect the same amount of pasta to come with each meal. Unfortunately it is a bit pricey for all of this to be wrong. I doubt I will go back."}
{"text":"Amazing! Try the pumpkin parm! So tasty!  Chef and waitress both so nice.  Can't wait to bring my folks here"}
{"text":"What an awesome new addition to the north side of town!  First thing you notice when walking up are the amazing smells coming from the kitchen!  When you walk in the vibe of this place really is mom and pop you hear wonderful music playing i had a wonderful welcome from shannon working the front, you can tell the owner really cares about what he does and loves to cook and bake.  The dine in area is super cute and  inviting, very clean and open with cute original decorations you dont see at every other italian restaurant.  We ordered the speacialty pizza called bianca and it was amazing! Perfect amount of cheese with sauce and the crust is REAL pizza crust im so sick of going to pizza places and not getting PIZZA crust. Anyways lol the owner was sweet enough to come out and let us know when the pizza was almost done and asked if we wanted the arugala on the side instead of on the pizza and that in itsself really tells you he cares because he also knew we ordered it togo and unless we ate the pizza right there it wouldnt be good and to me thats also how you spot an amazing chef most places wouldnt have thought of things like that unless you asked.  If youve been craving REAL pizza and pasta home made from scratch come to this place you can def taste the love! They also make hot and cold subs as well as many deserts and cookies to choose from.  They even had a SHRIMP parmisan on the menu and thats something you dont see now a days!    Come check this place out wonderful place for cute date nights and for the family!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for THE pizza place, this is it!  Best pizza I have ever had.  We ordered the Bianca, New Yorker, and the puttanesca! Yes, I was starving.  can't wait to try everything else. Do yourself a favor and go!"}
{"text":"Found this gem on uber eats! Holy cow was I impressed. Simple true Italian food. Couldn't be more happier with this find! Get the herbed ricotta salad and rice balls to start. The pizzas and handmade pastas are all great! Brava!"}
{"text":"Very quaint. My son was here visiting, and we thought we would try Amani's tonight. I ordered the chicken piccata with pasta. It was very good! Hubby had the braciole and my son ate a chicken Parmesan sandwich. Everyone liked their meal. We will definitely go back again. If I had to say one thing negative, it would be that my food was not hot enough. But it didn't stop me from eating the entire plate!"}
{"text":"Amano came across my Yelp feed and I knew I had to add this to the top of my list. I'm glad I did because both the food and service were excellent.   The restaurant is in an unassuming shopping center, but the inside of the restaurant is nicely decorated and clean. We were greeted and seated right away. Our waiter continued to be attentive and accommodating throughout our entire meal.  We started with a Large Caesar Salad which was excellent. The dressing was delicious and the lemon in the dressing really set off the flavor. The waiter even offered to bring extra anchovies since my friend loves them. The bread brought out before the meal was delicious as well. It looked simple, but was crusty and well flavored.  For our main meal we shared the New Yorker. I loved the crust on the pizza, specifically the flavor of the crust. I could tell the crust was fresh and homemade by the flavor. The entire pizza was delicious.  Dessert was Tiramisu and we both enjoyed this as well. The flavor and texture were great. Since there were so many good desserts to choose from I selected Rainbow Cake to go as well. I love rainbow cookies and this cake really captured the great flavors in the cookie. My cake was a little on the dry side, but the flavor made up for it.  If I find myself in this part of town again I'll definitely visit Amano again!"}
{"text":"Welll my family and I ordered from here twice.  Both times have been absolutely yummy!!!  The first time we got delivery I ordered the bolognese, my husband got the meatball sandwich and my son the chicken Cesar salad.  The bolognese was very flavorful.  The meatball sandwich.  HOLY COW!!! The best meatball sandwich I've had in a long time!!! The homemade fresh bread , the meatballs! So, so good!! Even the Cesar chicken salad was good.   Tonight my husband and I got delivery again.  I got the spaghetti and meatballs (ohh the meatballs).  The marinara sauce was very good. Great flavor! My husband got the lasagne which was good.  No meat in the lasagne but it was still good. If the delivery was this good even after the food had time to cool we can't wait to eat there and enjoy their food hot!!"}
{"text":"They have the best fried mozzarella. Their calzones are huge. Pizza is great also. I highly recommend this place. Everything I have tried here has been great"}
{"text":"Though this place didn't get some of our order right for delivery..... the pizza was AMAZING! I miss authentic Italian pizza so much, and this place definitely came through satisfying my craving! I can't wait to try it again. Definitely recommend. Try try try!!!"}
{"text":"I am so happy to have this addition to the Centennial area. There is such a limited food selection for this side of town.  We ate in (they deliver via a few delivery services) It is a small dining room and I felt as though they were not very organized with who was supposed to be taking care of which table. We had different people coming over multiple times asking if we had placed our order, or if we had got our entrees?!? However the food was spectacular! Calamari was really good.  Veal Parmesan and Spaghetti and Meatballs were both delicious! The pasta was a tad over cooked, but I think the disorder in the dining room caused a delay in the food getting to us. They are very new and a few kinks need to be worked out but this is top notch food. I am anticipating the next dinner! Pizza for sure!"}
{"text":"I had about a 45min wait before the Jays game and decided to try something new. Located inside Union Station, right by the Go Transit waiting area.   The decor was sleek and modern, with an open kitchen and marble bar. The lighting was a bit dim, but still enough light that I wasn't squinting. Note: the entrance for the sit down area is harder to find, so pay attention to the signage. I accidentally went through their take away area, which was quite quaint and had a small seating area.   I ordered the Fat Tubes aka rigatoni, which featured Ontario beef Bolognese. From the time that I ordered and the time that my dish arrived, it was about 10 minutes, which is pretty quick. The pasta was cooked al dente, and the beef was quite tasty. The only downside was that the sauce was too thin for my liking. However, it somehow managed to thicken up the longer it sat in the bowl. Also, the service was a tad lack luster at the beginning, especially since the restaurant wasn't terribly busy, but they became more attentive as the night went on.   For downtown Toronto, the pricing of the menu is reasonable. I would go back again if I was in the area to try the rest of their menu, but perhaps I would do take away instead of dining in."}
{"text":"The Cindy - probably the best pizza I've ever eaten. Ordered take out a few times now as well as dined in - they are consistently awesome!! Menu items are unique & perfectly executed. Service has been spot-on."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery thru Grubhub tonight. I am SO happy to have found Amano! I love delicious REAL pizza and this is it! I ordered a small Cindy (which is more like a medium/large). The dough is so delicious, perfect amount of high  quality toppings. Also ordered meatballs which are super delicious and moist! Thank you guys for the great dinner! I so plan on ordering more !!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit here and can confidently say we won't be back. We were greeted by a very nice young lady who's service lacked nothing (she's the reason they get two stars instead of just one).  We ordered two entrees, a salad, and a dessert to go. After about 50 mins, she brought out two small (school lunch size) brown paper bags. I even made the comment, \"Everything's in these two bags?\" Which she confirmed. Our order came to over $60.  When we got home and opened the bags, the salad had no dressing and the dressing we ordered was not in either bag. The dessert was so small, it could be gone in two small bites (just enough to piss you off). The entrees were no better: very small and so under seasoned making them extremely bland. Certainly not worth the wait and definitely not worth the cost.  I should've known better than to believe this to be an authentic Italian experience when they can't even spell \"marscapone\" right on their menus. It's \"mascarpone.\"  If you want GREAT Italian, I recommend Lino's on Tropical and Azure. They're 10x better in every aspect."}
{"text":"First let me preface this review as a person that grew up in an Italian culinary family here in Las Vegas, my father was the executive chef of a very successful Italian restaurant in the late sixties, seventies and most of the eighties. I'm a true foodie. I would have liked to give this new Italian restaurant a better score and I have to say that they did deserve at least one star, mainly for the decor and cleanliness of this small space, maybe a capacity of 25. It was clean and pretty and the unisex restroom was clean, modern and functional. That's a big accomplishment since so many restaurants get this wrong. I felt comfortable right away and was very excited about trying this new culinary experience. Then it all went downhill from there. I'll try to explain without to many derogatory remarks. I was greeted as soon as I walked in the door by the waitress whom I'm assuming might have been a family member, and was promptly seated. I was the only one in the restaurant as they just opened, I usually have a nice lunch after my haircut and love trying new restaurants in the neighborhood. She was pleasant and friendly as she took my order, spaghetti with meatballs and a Diet Coke. She told me she would bring a salad which was included with the entree and some hot bread. She delivered the bread and it had a small container of butter, the bread was warm and toasty but the butter was super cold and what I could put on the bread tasted old and stale...yuck. Suddenly after about 15 minutes the chef brought out my entree, no salad. I was so hungry I dove into the pasta dish and much to my surprise it was only barely serving temperature which most people describe as being cold, yes it was cold. I couldn't believe it, really? cold? Then a few minutes later she brought what looked like a nice side salad and apologized for it being late, then left it on the table after I told her I wouldn't eat it, I was thoroughly perturbed by now. I will give the dish a shout out in that the spaghetti had a nice texture and was seemingly homemade. The sauce was bland and too thick, the meatballs were to soft and also bland. No garlic, no basil, no wine, no flavor. Very disappointing. Why didn't I say something to them at the time you ask? It was lunch, I just wanted a quick delicious meal without drama, didn't get it. Oh and chef, please don't call your customers \"boss\", that's so old and informal, I didn't appreciate it at all. Good luck in the future but I won't be coming back to your restaurant."}
{"text":"First time visiting with my family. As soon as walked into the dining room, I was so shocked how beautiful it was. Never expected from small strip mall restaurant. Dining room looks like something you see in magazines. Everything was so beautiful and I can tell owners really care about their business. We ordered a large size New York Style Pizza, Garlic bread, Pumpkin Parmesan with pasta, Goat cheese and beets salad. First of all, house bread was very fresh and warm. We really liked the pizza. My vegetarian daughter enjoyed her Pumpkin Parmesan pasta and salad. Garlic bread got a lots of flavor too. We will definitely go back to this little neighborhood charm. Highly recommend Amano for your date night or family gathering. Intimate and casual. You will love it!"}
{"text":"My husband told me about this place so I had to try it! Food was incredible and the service was fantastic!! We had the antipasto and the stromboli and they were both to die for. We also had the rosemary lemonade which was perfect! We can't wait to come back to try something new!"}
{"text":"we tried it out for italian dinner. The soup, eggplant parm and pasta bolognese were good but too salty and the portions are small. The meatballs on the side were good as was the tiramisu. We will be back to try the pizza. Chef Jay spoke with us for a while explaining many foods and his resume."}
{"text":"We stopped here after doing a quick search or food nearby. The meatball parm sub caught our attention and it was absolutely AMAZING!!! Our 1.5 year old son killed the meatballs too lol. We also tried the fettuccine Alfredo which was really good as well. The Alfredo came with either a salad or an extra side of pasta, we got pasta with their red sauce added which wasn't the best. Next time I'll just add a different sauce. The atmosphere was very cozy and inviting. We'll definitely be back to try the pizza and some more dishes. Oh and I can't forget the rosemary lemonade!! The rosemary was a bit strong but it was pretty good!"}
{"text":"Came for the first time last night and I was pleasantly satisfied with the whole experience...the people were really friendly and attentive, the food was phenomenal, and the environment was beautiful and inviting. Highly recommend this place and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great place.  Love the menu and the atmosphere.  Pizza was real good. You can tell this Chef knows his stuff!  Uses real quality ingredients. The pizza crust was one of the best I've ever tasted. Can't wait to go back and try one of the sandwiches. Pasta and weeding soup was great too.  My wife loved her puttanesca.  Definitely a little gem in northwest Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Tried this place out. Tried a few pastas: the black trumpets, pope's hat and arancini. The pastas were very fresh and al dente. I liked the pope's hat a bit more as the lamb was very nice and melty. The portion sizes were small though. The arancini was delicious. The space isn't that big, and their dessert menu was not that impressive."}
{"text":"YUM!   I was hungry. Hubby was gone. Tired of cooking. Wanted spaghetti, meatballs and marinara. So? Treat yo self!  I ordered delivery. And wow, am I impressed!   The garlic knots are so... Perfectly doughy on the inside and the marinara is perfectly sweet. (Not too sweet)  The spaghetti and meatballs is fantastic as well!  So happy to find great Italian delivery. Can't wait to try more, as the pics look delicious!"}
{"text":"The absolute best Italian food delivery. Sometimes it reminds me of my nana's cooking. I've ordered the chicken piccata a couple of times (delicious) but we usually get pizza. We've had the Marianna, Primavera, Super Cheesy & Chefs Favorite- you cant go wrong with any of these but let me just say, the Marianna & Primavera are the absolute best! I wasn't really sure if I would like the pumpkin but my husband convinced me and I'm so glad he did, such a different flavor. And the rainbow cake...dangerous! This is our go-to place when we don't feel like cooking."}
{"text":"Union / York Concourse is turning up to be pretty trendy with these cute restaurants and coffee shops/ pastries place inside the station.  I came to Amano to get a drink. I ordered the hot chocolate which was pretty bland and had a hint of coffee maybe the filter was not changed? Not that great. My friend had a latte. The dulce de leche donut and Nutella donut however was pricey at $2.50 for a tiny donut. Not worth it. But it was tasty that's why I gave it a 3 star. I would try their pasta but I heard it's not great."}
{"text":"First time here.  Found it on Yelp and we're very pleased with the service and the food. I had Chicken Picatta . It was Prepared differently and bet good.  At first I thought it was only. Pick up and delivery butThey have a nice dining room."}
{"text":"If you or your family has any food allergies, I wouldn't even think of eating here! My daughter ordered a caesar salad, the waiter asked if she wanted anchovies and she said no. After she finished the salad he told us it had anchovies in it already but he didn't want her to know until she ate it. Thankfully she isn't allergic to fish!! Very scary to think that would have happened if she was. I will never go back, who do they think they are trying get my daughter to try something, that's my job. Your the waiter, not her parent. I was there on March 30, the waiter was an older gentleman, he had on a flatcap type hat"}
{"text":"Back here for the second time for a work lunch. Ordered the Pope's Hat (Tortellini) stuffed with cottage cheese with braised lamb ragù and fried rosemary. I felt the pasta was a little undercooked, buts thats just how most authentic Italian places does their pasta to avoid overcooking and losing its texture. You can specify if you want to have it cooked a little longer when you order if you like your pasta fully cooked. I paired the Pope's Hat with a glass of red at the server's suggestion - a delicious 2014 California Cabernet Sauvignon from the Silvia Cellar estates. It was a sweet fruit forward Cabernet Sauvignon with a spicy oak finish and it paired very well with the ragù. The servers were friendly and efficient and we got in and out within an hour. Four star for a quick work lunch."}
{"text":"Thank you again Amano and Chef Jay for a delicious dinner! Super Cheesy pizza and Fettuccine Alfredo. Awesome So delish!!  Nothing is better than fresh Italian food. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"A neighborhood gem! The stuffed portabella mushroom, rich with red pepper sauce was an excellent start. My husband ordered the Braciole which was not only tender but rich with layers of flavor.  The house salad ingredients were crisp and icy cold with a, get every drop  homemade dressing. The fresh baked bread is sourced from a local  French bakery was yeasty with just the right crisp. They use the same source for subs and sandwiches.  I ordered the seared tuna , Atlantic, not farm raised which clearly was the case after the first bite.  Perfect sear and flavor.  Don't miss the infused lemonade which was the perfect compliment to the meal.   We don't usually order dessert but after reading the reviews on the chocolate cake we ordered it to go.  Had we eaten it there, we probably would have ordered another to bring home! Love to see a local business take off and I believe it is only a matter of time before we are waiting for a table."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate at Amano for the first time this evening.  We had a very enjoyable experience.  The food was delicious and we got the pleasure of being able to visit with the Chef.  We will recommend this restaurant to all of our friends and be back to try more of the dishes we saw on the menu."}
{"text":"tldr: Tasteful execution of Italian cuisine. Simple dishes, correct portions, high quality ingredients, and clean presentation. Friendly staff. Trendy ambiance.  This restaurant just opened in Union Station. It is the sister restaurant of the Union Chicken shop across the way. The restaurant serves tactfully executes Italian cuisine. The pastas are all homemade. The portions are just right and so is the price. The prosciutto plate (w/ thin sliced melon, mint leaves, and peppers) is the perfect blend of tastes. The red spicy sauce on the side would be perfect with bread, or any of the homemade pasta dishes. I didn't have the desserts, but I would extrapolate that they are well executed dishes as well. I highly recommend this restaurant for your Italian food needs."}
{"text":"Three stars mainly for the food. Let me explain, I went with a friend on Thursday evening around 8:30. The restaurant was dead except for a table of three ladies. The waitress seated us in a corner against a wall which we found odd given the empty space. During our meal there was a spider above my head which freaked us out a bit cause that's gross.   We order the arancini to start, this was quite good actually and the roasted honey paired well. For my main, I got the radiators (spirally pasta with shrimp) this was yummy however I was a little upset cause it was mostly cold. Also we weren't offered cheese, and by the time the waitress came back to check on us I was about half way done (I even ate slower because I wanted cheese)   The price point is a little high but I guess there aren't many options inside union station so people waiting for trains are limited."}
{"text":"Great place, family friendly and super fresh ingredients. Everything is made there, pasta, dressings & desserts. Take out and delivery."}
{"text":"Great Pizza!  Crust is perfectly cooked with just the right crispness and the toppings are delicious; same with the sauce and cheese.  Nice folks, fair price, quality ingredients and close by. You can't ask for much more from a neighborhood pizza restaurant."}
