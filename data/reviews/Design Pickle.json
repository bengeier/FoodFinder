{"text":"Overall I like Design Pickle's concept. When you sign up they pair you with a designer and the more you work with that person the better results you get. My only advice would be not to expect designs to come through immediately especially if you have a large volume of designs that need to be done. If you're on a tight schedule and have a lot of work I'd suggest going with a free-lance designer or an agency that can devote more than one person to your project."}
{"text":"Having just cancelled another design subscription service due to a terrible experience, I was expecting mediocre, to do a bit more work, to fix the source files myself to make them presentable like before...But I was surprised. The process was very easy. They have two short videos to aid in the set up, they assign a designer in a day, and requests are SO easy to set up. I go into the system, input the info, add any samples and I get an email confirmation. From there, I can work off email for revisions. Each task comes with all links, fonts and source files. They are updated if revisions are requested. My professional life? It just got waaay easier. The old company we used, I had to literally type in the time I was submitting a task on a clunky system that had no notifications, I was asked to download and then UPLOAD their source files for them, they had a 3 business day turnaround. I had to wait for task closure..before I could submit another. It was a nightmare. I have a feeling Design Pickle is a good example of what a graphic design subscription service should be. And....that a lot of these negative reviews are from competitors and graphic designers. The quality is industry standard +, the onboarding is simple, the designer has a wonderful personality and the price is phenomenal. As a Director of Operations, I've been through over 6 designers in a year and another subscription service--with that experience in selection, I highly recommend this service."}
{"text":"Great design work for Amazon Merch T-Shirts.  My designer Hazel is doing an outstanding job in producing merch ready, current, fun graphics that are exactly what was ordered  I would highly recommend this service to anyone who requires professional design work.  Easy process, takes a little time to get started but once the requests are in and flowing, you can expect high quality results on a daily basis.  Don't contract anywhere else until you have tried the Pickle!"}
{"text":"Great Investment-Great Product! The team at Design Pickle does amazing work with very little edits needing to be done. They pay attention to detail and have knocked it out of the park for each request I've made. The turn around time is super fast, but the quality is top notch!! I'd recommend them to anyone who needs quality design work. Stephanie D is awesome!!"}
{"text":"I started using them about two weeks ago. I do my own design work for they company I own, plus several others. After spending all day making postcards that I felt were mediocre, I signed up for Design Pickle and figured I had 14 days to see if I liked it. I wasn't expecting much. They were SUPER friendly and easy to work with. They listen fairly well and I have been happy with the results so far. And now I can get back to working on other projects or maybe I can actually get a hobby! LOL."}
{"text":"Great product. Good people. Strange obsession with pickle puns. I love the work I've had completed."}
{"text":"If you have a business, a passion, or just a great idea that needs marketing help to get launched, you're going to LOVE Design Pickle!! Coming from 10 years in Marketing, I can appreciate the flat rate fee for whatever it takes to get the job done. Even better is that my designer is super friendly with a great personality and never requires follow-up, he just gets the job done, period. The quality is exceptional - it's like he can read my mind since I never had to change a whole lot from his design ideas. You'll be asked some questions so they can match you with the right designer and boy did they do a great job for me. Give them a try since you get 14 day trial. I really don't think you'll be disappointed. I'm a sole proprietor but I sure feel like I've hired a graphic designer on my team!"}
{"text":"Design Pickle is the BEST at helping me design everything I need for marketing! I've created posters, social media graphics, web banners, t-shirt designs... literally everything that I need designed, they can help with a simple email. I love the work my designer has created! #ObeyThePickle"}
{"text":"Awesome company, wonderful service, amazing designer! I love using Design Pickle to help with all my graphics and images for my website. I love having one dedicated designer, I enjoy building a relationship and only having to be in contact with one person. Two thumbs up for Design Pickle!"}
