{"text":"I have eaten here several times before, and today I took seventeen family members for brunch to celebrate my daughter's first communion.  There were 12 adults and 5 kids between the ages of 1 and 8.

Our server was truly wonderful.  Kind, patient, energetic, organized and generally just incredibly good at her job.  So good that I feel terrible giving one star, however...

The place was incredibly unfriendly to children.  My one year old was pretty fussy, and I did my absolute best to keep him quiet and out of everyone's way, but it was really difficult.  If we were sitting he was fussy, so we were up and about, being extremely careful not to be in anyone's way. The man who appeared to be the manager was so mean and condescending that he had me and my incredibly well-behaved 8 year old daughter near tears in separate incidents.  He seemed totally annoyed by our presence, and so did some the other patrons.

The food was mediocre.  I had a crabcake benedict that was incredibly bland.  The crabcakes tasted like saw dust and the hollandaise tasted like nothing at all.  The people who had burgers were happy.  My kids had the fish and chips and it was so-so.

I left a generous tip but I won't ever go back."}
{"text":"Great upstairs patio. Reasonable prices. Average food but good beer selection. 

Burger was done medium rare which was a nice change to the chewy overcooked rubber that often happens. However, the beef didn't have much taste. Good selection of salads - smoked salmon salad was of good serving size and quite tasty.
Server was a bit stressed - and there were only 10 people on the patio, 5 of whom had finished their meals ..."}
{"text":"A favorite local spot for brunch right through to after dinner snacks. Inside tip: get a side of their homemade scotch bonnet sauce. Goes with everything!"}
{"text":"Who do you have to know to get good service around here ?

Made reservations for 5:30 for what we thought would be an early holiday dinner with the family.
Were seated, specials listed, orders taken  
Food arrived: one soup - in retrospect a smart order - because everyone else's mains came almost an hour later.
It's busy, it's a holiday. Understood.

An aside: the holiday meal looked like a Swanson TV dinner.  I hear it tasted a bit better than that.  But Harbord House has a reputation for good food.  Maybe just not tonight.

Everything all right ? Want a top up on your coffee ? Need more water ? 
Good questions. 
We were not asked.
But the person looking after our table made sure those bar glasses were polished to within an inch of their lives.
Hmmm.  How about: guests first, goblets later.

Another aside: when the specials were listed at the top of the meal, no mention was made of pumpkin pie.  Maybe we would have liked some.  We'll never know.  It was sold out by the time we were thinking of dessert.

What a disappointment."}
{"text":"This place is great and I enjoy my brunch very much. I ordered a Canadian Breakfast and a 20 oz Blonde Lager. It's about $20 in total. 

The home fries is a bit too deep fried for me but everything else is great. I'm not a expert on beer so I randomly pick one from the list. Really like the choice. I enjoy their buttery toast with strawberry jam very much. I would like to come back and try other food!"}
{"text":"Very good pub with a nice beer selection. Burger was great and cooked medium just as ordered. Seemed like a popular place."}
{"text":"Two of us ate here the other night. We had pints (excellent), fish and chips on one side (good), mac n cheese on the other (good), and apple crisp for dessert (not so hot).

The place and the service were friendly and comfortable, no problem there. The cask ale on offer was awesome and all the beers we tried were fresh and quality. The beer prices were about 20% more than the average bar in the west end/annex, which I guess is reasonable for a restaurant.

The fish and chips seemed totally legit, but I only sampled them. The mac n cheese was good but in my mind could clearly have been better. It had a little crumb crust on top, and although it was nicely browned around the inside edges, the top was not. It was in a deep, almost cube-shaped dish, which I think led to a shortchange in crispy edges, compared to a broader, flatter dish. The salad that came on the side was OK: the kind of thing I would be happy to be served by a friend, but that i would be disappointed with if I made myself. The greens were a little past fresh, and the whole effect was not the kind of salad to eat out for. The portions were good all around. We came in very hungry and left full.
I had high hopes for the apple crisp, and it was a letdown. The dish was again a tall, cubical one, which meant that there was too much apple and not enough crisp. The top should have been thick and crunchy and nicely browned, but it was none of these. The apples were way too heavy on the cinnamon, which might well have been the only spice they used. We weren't jockeying over the last few bites, which is a very bad sign in a dessert.
I don't regret going, but I would only go back under special circumstances..."}
{"text":"Harbord House is my go-to spot for lunch or dinner. The staff are always very friendly (and accommodating when we bring the kids ). I think I've tried almost everything on the menu and have enjoyed it all. My husband and I especially enjoy the french onion soup, fish and chips and coffee :)"}
{"text":"In need of a basic pub-type restaurant for my dad, I remembered a friend had once recommended Harbord House. 

Upon arrival, there was no wait staff to be found, so we grabbed the only available table, half wiped with the cloth still sitting on the table.

Not picky about such matters, we grabbed some menus off a neighboring table while waiting for wait staff to swing by. After 5 minutes or so, a waitress did swing by to get us cutlery and take our drinks orders. 

Thus far, a very suspect experience, though with quick drinks delivery and quick ordering, the place started to redeem itself. 

I ordered the calamari to start. Arriving about 5 minutes later was a plate with a very small portion of tiny rings. I was upset initially, as for $10 I expect a healthy serving. Luckily, the rings were cooked to perfection, which can be a challenge with calamari. I figured the quality-over-quantity here justified the $10. 

For my main, I chose the pulled pork sandwich ($12). Served with hot, crisp yukon gold fries, the perfect side, the pork was cooked in a tasty barbecue sauce with a hint of pepper and other spices which added a hint of heat. Extremely tender meat on a fluffy sesame bun is just what's required for a pulled pork sandwich, and though a bit smaller in size compared to my preferred food truck-style sandwiches, it got the job done.

Wait staff did not inquire as to whether we wanted our drinks re-filled, or if additional water was necessary, which is a big no-no for me.

At the end of the day, this was pub fare, and I've learned that at pubs, unless you're paying exorbitant prices, the food is always going to be just that - pub fare. Keeping in mind that chain restaurants offering similar food are now priced slightly higher than Harbord House, overall I'd give this place a solid 7/10 and would definitely return. 

Service be damned, these days, it is nice to pay $12 and get some home cut fries and a fresh pulled pork sandwich."}
{"text":"Warm cozy atmosphere, especially for those cold fall or winter evening.  They do hardy right, like a thick beef stew or lamb sausages.  And their delicate is wonderful as well. One of the best calamari fritti I've enjoyed was at harbord house. Hot, soft, melt in your mouth goodness. . . And not oily. So perfect. Their salmon is moist and their vegetarian chili is more than satisfying. 

Lovely!"}
{"text":"Favourite place for a bite and a craft beer after the a scuba night in the pool. They always have a great selection of local craft beers, and some great Gastro pub food. 

Pulled pork sandwich (with sweet potato fries) is a favourite, and if the Lobster Club is on the specials menu, it shouldn't be missed"}
{"text":"Been here twice and would go again.

Service is very friendly and quick. Middle aged servers and typically middle aged crowd. 

Late night for drinks, around the bar and the staff get quite loud but its a friendly vibe.

Drinks are average - high priced. 
Atmosphere - heritage house, comfortable, limited patio seating
Crowd - 25 - 60 typically couples and small groups of friends

Menu has awesome ingredients. Took quite a while to decide what to order. Went for the Burger with Peameal and Cheddar. Burger was juicy with herbs. Everything was tasty. Bun was a little dry. Burger was hard to eat, stacked to tall. Bun should be wider and patty flatter. I actually had to fork and knife it. Boyfriend didn't enjoy the mess his burger made. Coleslaw is very good, and the home cut fries are really good. They don't have pickles or relish in house though... kind of important when you got a few burgers on your menu no?? You can ask for mayo and dijon mustard. Quite a bit of food but not over whelming. Tasty and decent priced, I think it was $13 per plate.

I would give this place 4 stars if music over compensated for the loud voices and if there were drink specials. Bills ended up to be pricy both times we came here. I will go again and try more food, that might also move it up to 4 stars.

Place is not suitable if you need wheelchair access or have any issues with walking. The front stairs are narrow, high and steep. There are lots of stairs down to the bathroom and lots of stairs to the upstairs seating / small patio. I probably can't go here for a month or so because of recent surgery, just too many steep stairs."}
{"text":"Was very disapointed with the service here. Felt like the server was put out. not friendly at all. Even overheard staff talking about patrons in a negative manner."}
{"text":"I stopped into the Harbord House during a recent trip and was welcomed warmly by the staff and enjoyed a great meal of lamb and rosemary sausages and a local beer. I came back the following night to enjoy the fig and goat cheese salad with chicken  which was fantastic also. Great food and great people!"}
{"text":"Harbord House really surprised me.

From the outside I thought it was just another grungy UofT pub with nothing special to offer. In fact, it's got a little of something for everyone.

Time to make a list!
- Quiet corner tables or a large upstairs for groups
- Sports on the TV behind the bar
- Small patios on both levels
- Surprisingly excellent food (try the $6 poutine and you'll never want to order anything else)
- Craft Ontario beers including Neustadt Springs DW30, Junction Conductor Ale, and Beau's Lager

I really don't have anything bad to say about this place. 5 stars it is!"}
{"text":"John Oakes is what you want in a gastropub owner. Honest food, specials that draw from local suppliers, a friendly set of servers and a great tap list have been assembled under his watchful eye. He recognizes regulars and often manages to make them feel appreciated.

I wish I lived nearby, as I could see treating John's place as my \"local\"."}
{"text":"I love Harbord House. I'm gluten intolerant and a fairly picky eater, so I'm super thankful to have this nice pub in the neighbourhood. 

It has two floors with nice patios on each floor. The interior of the bar is clean and doesn't have a 'bar odor' of spilled beer and old oil. The staff is really nice, in particular the owner. This place is great for bringing your family, young and old. 

Some of my menu favourites are their soups, which are made in-house, so all of the ingredients are known. I also love the rosemary and lamb sausages. (I had never eaten lamb before coming here, and now I order it all the time.) Their brunch items are also delicious. I love when servers know about food sensitivities and the ingredients in the food they serve. In addition, they always make substitutions for me. I've never been sick from eating there. My boyfriend, who doesn't have food intolerances, loves the chicken wings, the hoser burger, and the eggs in purgatory from the brunch menu. We go there all the time. 

Can you tell I like this place?! Take friends and family. Gluten-free people - eat without worry. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Very unimpressed with this place and not sure how it got such high reviews. I had one of the specials (jambalaya) which had no taste, little meat/sausage or fish. While the burgers were supposed my friend who had one said it was just ok."}
{"text":"I came here with a big group for dinner and they were very accommodating. I ordered one of their daily specials - the winter squash bowl. This was a vegetarian dish with roasted brussel sprouts, pumpkin seeds, and other vegetables on spaghetti squash. The first few bites were good - the brussel sprouts were roasted well and fragrant - but I found the spaghetti squash to be slightly too oily/soggy after while and it became slightly sickening. They did bring a free dessert to our table for my friend's birthday which was nice. Overall, it was okay. Nothing about it really makes me want to go back again."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday. I was really excited. I have no issues about the food or the quality of the food but I ordered the gourmet Mac n Cheese and the blue cheese taste over powered the whole dish. My friend could smell it from the other side of the table. I have no complaints otherwise and maybe it was just a wrong choice of dish but I was no satisfied as I was there to eat. But I will give this place another chance as my friend ordered the breaded chicken dinner special and that looked delicious."}
{"text":"Before anything else, I have to say: get the sticky toffee pudding!! 
I initially thought it sounded strange, never having heard of it before, but it was so worth it! (I've even gone just for that) 
Their food comes in big portions and everything I've had is delicious (if you're a cornbread fan, try it at $2/slice!). 
I was initially a bit disappointed by the prices but the sizes make it worth it, and it's really only expensive if you're a broke student like me. 
Their brunch menu is great and their specials are expensive but to die for! 
I highly recommend this place- nice staff, pretty restaurant, great food! Even a whole selection of beer! 
They also have board games if you're interested."}
{"text":"Great comfortable vibe/setting with excellent/jazzed up versions of classic Canadian fare. Everything is always taken up a couple notches from 'standard.'

Blackened salmon tacos are tasty, beef ribs are super-tender, mac and cheese is very good. DEFINITELY save room for the sticky toffee pudding desert. 

Solid craft beer selection too, including 12 taps plus a cask."}
{"text":"To be incorrect is forgivable. To be incorrect and arrogant about it is something else.
(That's called a teaser)

I was responsible for planning a small bachelor party for a good buddy. We had daytime drinks at a nearby bar, so for convenience, Harbord House seemed a reasonable nearby dining option. I called ahead to see if they could accommodate a vegan diner, and they said they could, listing the veggie chili as a vegan menu option.

We got there, were promptly seated, and began ordering our mains. I notified the waiter that I was looking for something sans dairy and egg ingredients, and asked about the chili. He said the corn bread that it came with had yogourt in it, which could not be removed.
\"That's fine,\" I said, \"I'll just have the chili with a side of regular bread.\"
I turn and proceed talking to my friend next to me, when the waiter interrupts: \"You want bread without dairy and egg ingredients in it?\"
There is a momentary pause as I affirm with myself that, yes, that was essentially what I was saying. \"Yes.\"
\"Think about that,\" he says, quite rudely.
I think about it.
Yes, that is what I want. I do not see a problem. Does... does this full-grown man believe that bread always, or even often, contains dairy or egg? I'm reminded of the Aziz Ansari comedy bit about 50 Cent learning that grapefruits exist. I understand that *some* bread contains egg, fewer dairy, but, man, I eat bread all the time. I read bread ingredients all the time. \"Think about that\" implies that my request for bread without dairy or egg was ridiculous.

\"Does your bread have dairy or egg in it?\" is all I can come up with as a response.
He doesn't respond with \"yes,\" which to me is telling about what he knows about how their kitchen prepares bread, but with this instead: \"Bread has egg in it.\"
I looked around momentarily at my friends, who are non-vegan, and were giving me a \"who is this guy?\" look. I don't want to get into an argument about bread. The tension here is already absurd for a simple request such as this.
EVEN IF ALL BREAD CONTAINED EGG AND MY QUESTION WAS ABSURD (which it wasn't), \"think about that\" is an entirely inappropriate response to a request like mine. It was not said jovially, or in good fun.

There is a pause as I again process how to deal with this fellow while diffusing the situation. \"If your bread has egg in it, I'll pass on the bread.\"

He attempts to compromise, \"We have pita bread in our kitchen. We don't make it in house, so I don't know what's in it.\"

\"Pita bread,\" I say, \"usually has no egg in it. I'll get the pita bread, please.\"

He leaves with our orders, and I ask my friends if I'm nuts here, or what? They take my side, saying that that was weird and tense, and that the waiter was just wrong - egg in bread is not so common as to warrant incredulity and rudeness at my mere suggestion that I get some without.

The rest of the food and experience was three-star worthy. A mediocre vegetarian chili I wouldn't go back for.

I called and spoke to the manager a few days later. He agreed that it was inappropriate for the waiter to give me a \"Think about that\", and apologized. I regret not asking, for the record, whether or not their bread actually contained egg. The waiter was too indignant, when I asked, to give me so much as a \"Let me ask the kitchen for you.\""}
{"text":"Just stopped in for dessert and drinks. Sticky toffee pudding was the best I've had in a long time and beer selection was great."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise! 

We were going to another restaurant and found out it wasn't open on a Monday night, fully disappointed and starving, we walked by this place and just decided to have a random meal to end off the night. 

What did we get ourselves into??!!

We walked in and it was empty. We were greeted by a nice lady that offered us a seat on the small patio up front. 

Drinks: I got a light ale beer, delicious. 

Apps: 
crab cake - sauce could've had more kick to it. otherwise it was well done. but nothing spectacular.
buffalo shrimp - this on the other hand, was delicious! I ordered it because someone suggested it here! OMG it was so good I'm getting hungry just thinking about it. It was crispy, hot and fresh at the same time. Prob one of my fav apps of all time. 

Mains:
we both got the specials
seafood and mushroom linguini - my friend's dish. it was with a white wine cream sauce. not so heavy but with lots of flavour. I personally enjoyed it. My friend did as well.
lamb shank - i got the lamb shank. braised for hours, comes with mash potatoes and veggies. It falls off the bone and melts in your mouth. the piece was giant too, i struggled to finish. YUM!

Desserts: too full for it! 

Overall, great great restaurant. Never would've walked in if it weren't for the change of event, but I am so glad that I did. Will find time to go back and try their mac and cheese!"}
{"text":"This is a wonderful restaurant shaped like a house.  I tried one if the day's specials - jerk pork sausages with mango salsa and potato salad.  The sausages were well spiced and mildly spicy, well-complimented by the sweet mango salsa.  The potato salad was that great kind with dill flavouring. How did they know I love that kind?

Charming layout, an atmosphere well suited to pleasant conversation.  I recommend it for anyone living downtown!"}
{"text":"I'm beginning to think Harbord St - more specifically, Harbord House - is becoming my go-to place for friends' birthday group gatherings. I ate here last weekend, and and was reminded of why I LOVE it.

The dining room - specifically, the upper level - is a decent space. The staff is fine, too. Had no problems with them.

And the food is what you'd call \"comfort food\". I'm now a fan of their Mac N' Cheese. It's so rich and tangy, you need the greens to help you digest.

I'm probably biased, but having been here probably half a dozen times, I've yet to leave disappointed."}
{"text":"Good food (incl brunch and Sunday roast)
Great selection of Ontario beer
Rotating cask ale
Not overpriced

Four points, four stars"}
{"text":"Food here seems to have dropped off in quality (last two visits were noticeably worse than prior visits).  Still a nice place, but it seems like they changed something about the food preparation."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and had the fisherman's pie.  My coworkers all had burgers and fries (some regular potato, some sweet).  Apparently the sweet potatoes are a bit more expensive than the regular ones.  The food was really tasty and arrived quickly.  Our waiter was friendly.  I would strongly recommend people check it out.  It's a bit pricey but well worth it."}
{"text":"I was here for new years eve with friends. I had a brisket beef sandwich with sweet potato fries. the problem was i found out a LONG HAIR in my sandwich :S! i was disgusted and sent it back. they gave me a new one but i completely lost my appetite. i hope this doesnt happen to everyone else"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch and had a much better experience than the last time I was here a few years ago.  I ordered the country fried beef benedict. the two beef pieces were fried well and were tender on the inside. They were served under two poached eggs with hollandaise sauce on the top.  It was a nice combination. However, the size of the meal was puny, especially for brunch, and I use the word beef 'pieces' literally."}
{"text":"A just fine, albeit expensive pub. It reminds me of a tourist trap in Cape Cod but without a seaside view. That being said, good hearty food and quick service makes this a safe bet if you are trying to figure out a place for a meal that spans generations."}
{"text":"The vibe and atmosphere isn't what it once was.   Got here at 930 for a late dinner one night and there were plenty of tables to choose.  The house burger is decent, the bun is crisp and large and the patty was a good size.  The taste was good...just not $14 good.  If you only want a burger, you can get a much better one from Burgers Priests.   The fries though were amazing, moist, yet crisp, chunky and seasoned very well.  My date had the goat cheese salad and said it was good.  My sample of it confirmed this, with their dates and glazed pecans being the star of the salad."}
{"text":"Overall I wasn't TOO impressed with Harbord House. Even with a reservation for a party that was made far in advance, we had to wait for quite awhile, and then were forced to sit at two separate tables.

The staff was friendly but didn't knock themselves out, and again, the food was fairly good, but nothing too spectacular. It's a cool place, casual vibe, slight twist on some pub fare classics, but not the place if you're looking for something special.

We also found the drinks slightly more expensive than expected, and they didn't have many draught beers to choose from."}
{"text":"Bar de quartier très cosy, idéal pour manger un bon burger et une bière locale ontarienne."}
{"text":"I HEART Poutine (as I am sure you can guess from some of my previous posts) and the Harbord House is one of the greatest places in Toronto to take advantage of this delcious appetizer. 

Real cheese curds and the option of regular fries or sweet potato fries, you cannot go wrong! 

The atmosphere is cozy and casual and a great place in the winter months to meet up with friends for a pint and a poutine! 

I am definitely a fan."}
{"text":"The meal I had here, burger and salad, was deeeeelicious! Burger was very juicy and full of flavour. Beers on tap was an amazing deal! Only 4.50-6  dollars max! What? Unheard of! Bar scene kinda feels like an \"older\" crowd scene. However, we were there at early bird time so scene could change later at night. Our server was very friendly and I really liked how the owner is there to greet you! Great location it fits perfectly into harbord village and it's vibe."}
{"text":"On a fast decline, just slid past mediocrity on it's way to \"never going back\".

Here's my major issue: you are going to be ignored.  This is almost inevitable, whether busy (\"Oh, it's too busy, that's why they're ignoring us!\") or empty (\"Oh, it's so empty, they're doing other things...\").  I hate that they never refill your coffee (better coffee service at Fran's, quite frankly) and I hate that whenever you ask for anything, it's like a giant disservice.  

Worst part was a member of our party got the tuna nicoise salad without the tuna (vegetarian) so it was essentially a few pieces of greens with an egg and they charged her the full amount ($18).  The actual tuna nicoise comes with a huge tuna steak...."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints with the food quality and quantity. Nice atmosphere for a company function and a 2nd level for large loud groups."}
{"text":"Harbord House is misleading on at least two fronts.

1) Because there was some gross pub there before you may think it's a gross pub. It's not. The food is definitely above pub level quality and creativity.

2) You may be under the impression that because they say they have a terrace, they do. They do not. They have some kind of balcony set-up that has you very close to other diners and isn't particularly picturesque or comfortable. Or you can sit on the first level patio and enjoy exhaust with your meal.

So, with those two things clarified, I can tell you that I think Harbord House is worth checking out, especially if you are going for an early dinner (before the rush). My friend's fish tacos were a generous serving of fresh yummy flavour and my burger with sweet potato fries was ...sweet. The menu is varied and interesting. Service was pleasant - I did not experience any of  what others found so disagreeable. 

A shame that the terrace is so disappointing because the indoors appears to be pretty grim. Dark, crowded, and shadowy (in a way that always make me suspicious of the cleanliness of the place), but probably okay.

I would consider Harbord House one of the more casual and accessible dining establishments on Harbord and this is worth noting because that street is increasingly taken over by snooty joints. But I don't think I would go out of my way to eat there again."}
{"text":"Came across this restaurant because the place we were headed was closed.  Went to lunch after going to the ROM.  Was excellent.  I had the ham and cheese lunch special and my friend had the catfish.  Nice selection of craft beers.  We are upstairs right by the patio.  Would love to come back and spend some time there.  Will return."}
{"text":"A cute little Victorian house transformed into a \"pubby\" atmosphere - with great food and nice service. 

If you're a VEGETARIAN, try the veggie chili. It's spicier than you'd expect, but definitely worth the heat.

The service was personable and down to earth. No wows, but not bad. 

Try it!"}
{"text":"After doing weights, I was so hungry and wanted something like homestyle cooking and decided to come to the Harbord House. This place was cute and has a fair amount of seating outside and inside. I was surprised how busy this place was, and walked to the top floor and got seated from a sweet lady. As soon as I was settled in, I started off with the crab cakes, it was delicious. Everything looked so good, I couldn't make up my mind what to get and needed a couple minutes to decide what I wanted for my main. I realize this place was busy but there was only one waitress there and she didn't return back for awhile. When she finally returned I ordered the meatloaf with portobello mushroom gravy and green beans, and once I got my entrée, it was flavourful and moist, I love anything with gravy so it was a hit with me! At this point I was so full I didn't have room for dessert but I will definitely come back to try out the rest of the items on the menu."}
{"text":"I was there with a large group of friends for a meet up. I had a watermelon-lemonade vodka drink.. YUM! I also ordered the Pulled Pork sandwich entree.. it was very delicious and hot in temperature, a little too much black pepper for my liking. The fries and coleslaw was great as well. My friend had 2 micro brews and the total was about $35 for the entire bill. The prices are mid-range so somewhat reasonable."}
{"text":"So we began our journey into the Harbord House by complete accident as I was looking for another restaurant on the same streetcar. However we reviewed the menu and it looked quite appealing. The price was adequate and the menu tasteful. When walking in we were warmly greeted right away and asked where we would like to sit. I always find that to make the dinning experience just a bit more pleasant. Drinks were offered within minutes of sitting down with a menu catering local craft beer, wine and spirits. I would recommend the junction conductor  for a great tasting beer that would pair well with the lamb and meatloaf. With drinks in hand we chose our starters as the French onion soup, crab cakes and the Caesar salad. Let me tell you that all three were very good, however the French onion soup stood out to me the most. A flavorful taste with a smooth cheesy top and three pieces of freshly baked buns within the soup itself. Onto the mains we were told the specials which all sounded appetizing and after a minute or two of heavy decision making we decided to go with the lamb special served with mashes potatoes and the meatloaf also served with mashes potatoes and green beans. The lamb was quite good, but was ordered as medium rare and came as bit more on the rare side. The meatloaf was soft and succulent. Probably the best meatloaf I have since you don't find them on menus regularly. (my mother's was always a bit dry, but don't tell her I sad that). The mashed potatoes were delicious. For desert I had the apple crumble. Just like grandma's it was sweet and fresh, still warm like fresh from the oven. Overall this was a pleasant and tasteful experience. I would highly recommend stopping by for a meal and a pint. Cheers"}
{"text":"I love love love this place.  It's small enough for it to be intimate and big enough to celebrate with a group of friends.  So nice that I almost don't want anybody to know about it = )"}
{"text":"My friends likes to meet there, because they have a huge bookshelf, free books provided by BookCrossing (see BookCrossing.com), so we bookworms can always browse a bit and pick something to take home with.  The manager is also very nice and take good care of us.

They have a good selection of craft beer, all local from Ontario,and available in 12 oz and 20 oz, which is great for small drinkers like me. Their food menu has many interesting items, but I would say that they sound better than they taste.  The French onion soup was salty, and the poutine was soggy fries swimming in an ocean of watery gravy.  My Canadian friends had to assure me that this is not a good example of the Canadian national dish.  This place is known for the sticky toffee pudding; personally I find it too sweet, it's delicious, but definitely can be shared.  

So, food alone, 3 stars. 0.5 star for the beer selection, and 0.5 star for the BookCrossing shelf."}
{"text":"Went for brunch! Wholesome and well flavoured food. Solid cup of coffee too! Great service as well!"}
{"text":"This felt like a grown up version of the Victory Cafe. Excellent selection of reasonably priced micro brewery beers. Food was delicious and also reasonable. Loved the shrimp as well as the french onion soup that was delicious! Friends tried the \"hoser burger\" and loved it as well as the pulled pork sandwich (which looked small but she said it was filling). Overall, it was a good spot. We sat on the main floor and i never even ventured upstairs but will definitely come back to check it out. THe washrooms were downstairs and could use an update. Overall, I liked it here and will be back!"}
{"text":"Oh! Here comes my shrimp curry special! I'll have to edit this later, if I don't have too many pints of Durham's Red Dragon cask ale."}
{"text":"Get to know John. He owns the place, is there most days, and wants you to have a good time.

The menu leans heavily on local and seasonal, though not dogmatically, and keeps the list short enough that the kitchen can actually get basically everything right. This has become something of a running joke with our group, since the excellent and ever-changing specials make it hard to return to the standards very often.

The vegetarian chili is a favourite of mine, especially on cold days - very chunky with beans and veg, not just tomato-sauce-without-meat. I'm also a big fan of the pulled pork sandwich with fries, if you run meatward. For apps, try the buffalo shrimp, and wonder why more pubs don't carry them - delicious.

Save room for the sticky toffee pudding. Don't make that face, I'm serious. I don't care that you don't normally eat dessert, or that sticky toffee pudding sounds too rich. It'll split up to 4 ways happily, so you can cop out that way if you want, but you really do have to order it. I kind of insist.

Tap list is all Canadian, again leaning on the local, and the guest tap changes monthly. John's got your hookup there, too."}
{"text":"Way too bougie for this bo-bo.  

I really liked Rowers and it's laid back vibe.  This place is just too pricey and for what?  The atmosphere lacks compared to Rowers... if I want to watch fire on a display screen I can do that at home, thank you very much.  

The food is okay, just too sleek for what should be Rower's.  Um... I'll just leave it at that."}
{"text":"Standard pub with decent beer selection and a bit of extra charm because its in an old house. The servers are not happy. Otherwise, good for what it is."}
{"text":"First time @ the harbord house and I've lived in the area for 6 years.  Not sure why I've never been but couldn't decide where to eat today and finally took the plunge

FOOD:

went with my gf, and we ordered
Calamari
Lamb & Rosemary sausage
Pulled pork sandwich

I personally disliked the calamari because it had a very starchy taste to it, also looked very unimpressive.  my GF however enjoyed it.

The Lamb sausage had good flavor, but a bit dry.  The accompanying sides mash potato and vegetables were good.

The Pull-pork sandwich itself was good, however the fries were to salty and the colsaw was tasteless


Service:

Service was ok, however one thing did annoy me.  Our server did not mention to us the daily specials or w/e they are called.  The only reason i knew they even existed was cause i over heard him telling another table about them



For the price I felt the harbord house was decent, its probably not someplace i would go back to.  personally I was leaning more towards 2.5/5, but my GF enjoyed it so i rounded up.

PS:  Maybe it was just this one time experience that wasn't so great but i certainly wouldn't give it an average rating of 4."}
{"text":"My visit here has become a blur, a faint memory without specifics.  I remember going there for lunch with a friend, sitting on the patio, eating my meal in about 3 minutes because it was so good, and thinking to myself I need to go back again!

I do remember the pulled pork sandwich, the best I've ever had (don't tell my girlfriend that it was the best I ever had!).  I also remember delicious french fries, again nothing specific, just that I ate them all, even the tiny burnt ends.  And yes, the fresh watermelon lemonade.  What!?!?  Yelp, it was fantastic.

Since I've only been to this place once, I'm giving it a tentative 4 stars.  However, a couple more visits and it may gain another star.  Judging by other reviews here, this place definitely is a hit."}
{"text":"Endroit très sympa si vous souhaitez boire un verre dans un endroit excentré de downtown et son hyperactivité! 

on est dans une vraie maison et c'est très agréable!

A essayer ++++"}
{"text":"Had a lovely time here. Quietly decorated, warm staff, good draft beer selection. Be aware that the mint pea falafel sandwich has patties made of mint and pea, NOT chickpea/adzuki beans. I thought that it would have peas and mint in addition to typical falafel patties. Still really tasty though."}
{"text":"Sure, they have microbrews, but the bartender was really bitchy.  She wouldn't even list them for us.

Honestly, if you're not going to give us hospitality, why should we bother tipping you well?"}
{"text":"Amazing outdoor patio space along with well designed street signage and curb appeal, experience was off to a great start until we encountered a less than friendly hostess/server who did very little to accommodate us; in doing so with what felt like a mix of discontent and a touch of sarcasm.

We ordered a Niçoise salad and a salmon tacos dish, and were thoroughly disappointed. Both the presentation and flavouring would be something you would expect to be served at a low brow joint rather than a place like this with an ambiance which reeks of good taste: sadly the food didn't follow suit."}
{"text":"Great food, affordable dining, great service. 

This little Harbord Hideaway is great for a warm winter meal, or a summer patio evening 110-in-the-shade with a cold, frosty beer.

The chef's specials are excellent and one simply feels welcome when you walk in the front doors. 

Check it out!"}
{"text":"For those UofT folks at St George Campus or anyone looking to find a quiet, cozy place for great drinks and food, Harbord House a great choice.  Highly recommended by Ilona G. Im glad she was right..................as usual. ...most of the time Actually...... as much as I hate to admit. 
This place literally feels like an old house; old wooden floors, chairs, tables, bookshelf, comfy booths and decor truly feels like you're at home.  The service was great, and the overall mood of this places exhibits a chillaxed environment. 
They have a range of comfort foods and the beer and wine lists are exceptionally good.
My buddy order a domestic brew while she and I had their Argentine Malbec.
For food their calamari 3.5/5 not greasy which is plus! Presentation was satisfactory and taste was not bad... However the batter needs a but more flavour.
Sweet Potato fries with maple Dijon dip 4/5 fresh cut sweet fries, again, not greasy...served with a dip. Only recommendation sauce should be a bit more thick so at least the sauce could stick to the fries lol.. 
Dessert...ooh lordy!!! Wow speaking of sugar kick and diabetes sticky toffee pudding..@&!&#*$ so gooooood!!!! Lots of syrup sauce, soft...melt in your mouth goodness..I highly recommend & give it a perfect 5/5

Now among my list of chill out places.....gracias hermosa ;-)"}
{"text":"Went there with a few friends and thought the ambiance was great and the food was pretty good.  Probably the best fish tacos I've had in a while.  The crab cakes were okay and the spicy shrimp appetizer was fantastic...  I really like the sticky toffee pudding too.  I would definitely go again.  Cheers..."}
{"text":"I agree with Connie, this seems like the perfect \"hang-out\" for the over 30 type. We had a big group and it's a rather small space so they weren't too happy when we showed up. We got attitude from the waiter the whole time which made us a bit uncomfortable but I generally liked the place was set up, ambiance, food, etc. They don't have any dishes I'd go out of my way to have but it was good, affordable and a good place to grab a couple drinks after as well.

Their portions aren't HUGE... they just serve them in REALLY big plates :) Mains range from 12-22, most around 12-13"}
{"text":"I find Harbord House too small and too hot in the summer. The bar features no light beer on tap, sadly, for us watching our girth. The staff is good and the appetizers are decent, but I much prefer other pubs in the neighbourhood such as the Madison."}
{"text":"We enjoyed their variety of taps, closeness to the university and funky neighbourhood vibe. They have a cosy patio and really great service. I guess they must get noise complaints because we had to move inside after 9:00 and that kind of killed the party. Food was great. It's really one of the better gastropub places to go in the area that has a real academic/university feel. You could tell that it was a mix o factulty, students and parents (we were dropping off daughter) and they clearly got that we were enjoying ourselves and wanted to take our time and chat."}
{"text":"This place has the best sticky toffee pudding I have ever had!! It's even available for takeout!"}
{"text":"I thought the first time I went to the Harbord House was for a Yelp event, but I was wrong. I had actually been a year prior for a Flickr Meetup. I need to improve my memory. Anyway, I was at the Harbord House again recently for another Flickr Meetup. The bar is two floors, and the top floor makes a good place to have a large gathering. The bar looks really nice and cozy. It's very beige, but in a good way. The drink selection is great, and prices are reasonable. The food is shockingly good for a bar."}
{"text":"This is the place in Toronto for mimosas. You get a bottle of Henkell sparkling wine and a jug of orange juice.  Mix and match to your hearts content.

I ordered the country fried beef eggs Benedict and they were great. My buddies ordered omelettes and they looked great on too. The fish and chips piece of fish was huge, like almost a pound.

In summary: come for the mimosas, stay for the food!"}
{"text":"Thank god there's good pub food in Toronto.  And that slightly upscale (but not upscale-price) fare it to be found at Harbord House.

My neighbor (do I have to spell it neighbour in Canada?) took me here shortly after arriving in Toronto.  I've had two rather solid meals here now without breaking the bank.  Their daily specials seem to be the star of the show.  On my last visit, I had an outstanding pork chop, really as expertly cooked as they come.  I was delighted to see some rapini on the plate as well that was also well-cooked.  I like my slightly bitter greens to be blanched or modestly cooked.  Plenty of pubs cook their greens to an inch of their lives.  Harbord house seems to have consistently solid execution in their plating.  They also do a nice poutine, with some very fresh cheese curds.

This pub has a good selection of the standard Toronto microbrews.   Basically that means they don't have the amazing selection you might find at C'est What, but that thankfully no keg space is wasted on Labatt's, Molson's, or Sleemans.  They also seem to often have a unique cask offering on tap, which is a pleasant surprise.  Service is generally quite friendly, although it can be just a bit harried when they get busy, which they do.  Very pleasant atmosphere in the dining room...what I might call \"casual class.\"

I think this place may be on the regular rotation."}
{"text":"This place is a gem. John's interpretation of an Ontario gastro-pub is spot on. I like how the food changes with the seasons. Highlights are the BBQ in the summertime, the simple grilled local fish...and of course, the sticky toffee pudding - it's off-the-rails. 

And of course, the beer. The rotating selection of Ontario micro-brews is perfect. The eclectic collection of previous guest taps on the wall above the bar is a nice touch, as are the bucolic pictures of Ontario cottage country, in frames. It's one of the only places I know with confidence that I'll be able to find my favorite stout ( Durham's Black Katt ). A less pretentious offering on the foodie-friendly Harbord strip. 

Good place to take the family, in other words it's kid friendly. Had a burger and a Black Katt with my son, who had the mac and cheese, on the porch this summer."}
{"text":"I have nothing negative to say about this restaurant. We went here because the place to which we originally planned to go for dinner was full! Good food, good service, nice atmosphere, some original beers, I would go again next time I'm in the neighbourhood.

Last 3 words: STICKY TOFFEE PUDDING! Oh ma gawd... I can still taste it...mmmm...."}
{"text":"Went to Harbord House pretty much by accident. It's located down the street from another sought after patio restaurant but it was jammed packed and I'm so glad it was!

There are two patios, one upstairs and one on street level as well as two levels of indoor seating. This place has a quiet and quaint atmosphere with an incredible menu including angus burgers, a variety of salads & yummy breakfasts (especially eggs benedict). 

Everything is reasonably priced ($12-25) and the service was pleasant. 

Try to sit on the patio upstairs! The hanging baskets are lovely."}
{"text":"Pretty good, by no means great. The menu has lots of options (veggie included) and drinks are reasonably priced. The crab cakes were burnt on the outside but fine on the inside, the goat cheese and fig salad was SWIMMING in dressing (I asked for it on the side but it came dressed) but interesting, and the fries hit the spot. It's not a destination dining spot, but if you're in the neighbourhood it's worth a try."}
{"text":"Walked by this place and had to take a peak. It has a very homey and friendly feeling to it. The server was delightful and the food was amazing. I got the salmon tacos( as suggested by the server) and my friend got the potato salmon. Both were very good. I personally wasn't a fan of the potato salmon but my friend thoroughly enjoyed it. I had never had salmon tacos but they are a now a new favorite of mine, very good mix of flavors with a light house vinaigrette salad on the side. Going to visit this place again soon."}
{"text":"I've passed by this pub umpteen times over the years and never bothered to give it a try. From its exterior (surf-house/cabin?) and location (stone's throw from U of T), I always thought it was a frat-house type of bar.

Happily, I was mistaken. The beer selection is fuckin' TOP notch, with unique taps like Neustadt Springs 10W30, Junction's Conductor's Craft Ale, and Beau's Lug Tread available (okay, this last one's everywhere these days - still a plus).

The food also doesn't disappoint. They label themselves a gastro pub (ugh...?), and that does come through a bit in the food. I haven't been disappointed yet. 

Seating is a bit tough - there are fewer seats than you would expect given the appearance of this 'house', but the servers are pretty accommodating. We've crammed more people than reasonable at a table and no cut-eye or snarkiness was perceived."}
{"text":"I had always wanted to go here because I bike past it a lot.

I brought my family, a party of 6. The food was entirely MEDIOCRE. So for the price, it was disappointing. I got the fish n' chips- nothing special. My boyfriend got the lamb- it was ok, with poorly cooked potatoes on the side. The side salads included veg where everything was cut too big, just very unrefined. 

The ambiance was sort of weird upstairs too, as there was a huge tv with sports. I don't think I'll ever go here again."}
{"text":"This was my first foray into the handful of intriguing restaurants and bars on Harbord. I've always wanted to explore the street and what it has to offer, but never had the chance.

Love the patio both downstairs and upstairs at this place, but it is tight and hard to grab a good spot. 

Service was satisfactory. 

We ordered a bunch of dishes and shared instead of ordering full meals for ourselves. Their chicken wings are alright, nothing special. Calamari was good. Regular pub fare that you can't really mess up. 

We were a party of three and shared the Hozer burger and club sandwich which were both a good portion and tasty. Yukon fries are a must. 

Be prepared to order beers you may not have heard of, or acquired a taste for. If you're looking for something light to start off with, I suggest ordering the Grasshopper."}
{"text":"I can't imagine having coworkers in town without bringing them to Harbord House. The food is fantastic, the beers are real and local, and the ambiance is very cozy and relaxing. (Fun note: the pictures on the wall were all taken by John, the proprietor!)

I've been here so often that I don't think I've neglected anything on the menu. Best bets include:
- for appetizers, the dip trio and buffalo shrimp;
- for mains, the Hoser Burger (includes peameal bacon!), Cobb salad, Cottage Pie, or Pulled pork sandwich (though it's hard to go wrong with anything on the menu);
- and a must have is the Sticky Toffee Pudding. You don't need one each; one for four people will do. It's that rich, and that delicious. I have never known a person to regret the decision to have sticky toffee pudding, even those on very strict diets.

There are a lot of fancier, more upscale restaurants along this stretch of Harbord, but I would always rather go to Harbord House. Especially when I can sit around for an hour or two, drinking Durham Hop Addict, talking about all manner of everything with my fantastic coworkers - which Harbord House is all too happy to oblige."}
{"text":"i really liked this place. truthfully, not enough to write a review, but now that i read all the negative reviews, i feel like they need some balance. i came here for a few work-related lunches and each time i've been *very* pleasantly surprised with the food. not being a huge fan of pubs and greasy food, that's saying a lot! check out this place and find out for yourself;-)"}
{"text":"We stumbled into this place because it was close to where we were staying, we were tired, and they were still open at 11:00. It was mostly empty but still serving food until midnight. The menu isn't really my type of food, but we just needed to eat so we sat down.

We started out with the fig and goat cheese salad, which was excellent. Definitely the best part of the meal. I was pretty hopeful for the rest.

We ordered the fish and chips and the blackened fish tacos. Perhaps a bad choice, but nothign else really inspired me. Anyway, the chips were nice, but the fish was nothing to write home about. It could have come out of a bag. The blackened fish tacos were also rather unmemorable. 

Service was friendly, without being particularly attentive."}
{"text":"Food is great here and service is excellent however the last 2 times I ordered a burger it was rare with blood pooling on my plate and soaked the bun once biting into it. It was delicious however food safety must be in order when it comes to ground meat. The server apologized and quickly replaced it with a burger cooked medium and juicy."}
{"text":"While I have had both good and bad experiences at this restaurant, the good overshadow the bad. Plus, how can you not love a restaurant in a house? 

Service has always been fantastic. The atmosphere is great. I've gone just with my husband on some occasions and with larger groups on others and every time I have thoroughly enjoyed the experience. 

If you're going to try some of their appetizers I highly recommend their calamari. The calamari is dipped in a cornmeal breading which is nice and light and the lemon saffron aioli dipping sauce is absolutely amazing. I also recommend the buffalo shrimp. I don't normally like a blue cheese dip, but the one that is paired with this shrimp is pretty good! The Ale, bacon and cheese dip is also quite delicious, and of course the sweet potato fries. 

The first time I was ever there I had one of their feature items which was a steak and it was cooked to my liking. I have also enjoyed their burgers, though the last time I was there my burger was a little overdone for my liking. 

Finally, I can't forget to mention their beer selection. While it is not super extensive, it does provide you with a variety of different kinds that you won't find in your average pub/restaurant. I recommend the Durham Hop Addict IPA. 

I will definitely go back and I recommend you give it a try if you're in the area and looking for a great place to eat. Call ahead to make reservations though, because I'm not the only one who has such a high opinion of this place!"}
{"text":"I've walked past this place many times and never stepped foot inside. We decided to venture inside and give it a shot, and guess what?

I honestly wish we'd come here sooner because the food is divine.

The restaurant is very homey and reminded me of a ski lodge both inside and outside.

We ordered the wild mushroom & goat cheese mac and cheese, chicken pot pie, and sticky toffee pudding. If I'm being totally honest, the food here is the epitome of comfort food.

Our main dishes were pretty heavy and fatty so the accompanying salad provided a nice balance to it. I also liked how they gave us freshly ground pepper for the salad.

Sticky toffee pudding is moist and oh-so-caramelly.

Be sure to stop by if you're in Harbord village!"}
{"text":"Have been several times and it is always outstanding.  Service attentive and friendly and food is fresh and delicious..love the fact it's like a home cooked meal.  Different but comforting food!  A must visit!"}
{"text":"Cozy spot. Everything about it - staff to music to menu - Reminds you of a friendly neighbourhood pub. Which is Exactly what it is. Had the hoser burger and it was as comforting as the Canadiana art and warm wooden floors. Good spot for a brunch, a beer and a book."}
{"text":"This is a great spot that does lunch and dinner equally well. I feel it has a cottage-y kind of atmosphere. It is cozy in the winter and in the summer they have the A/C pumping inside but also have adequate patio seating for smaller groups.
I think the pulled pork sandwich remains my favourite permanent menu item, but they always have a number of really good specials as well. 
TIP: If you're aiming for something on the lighter/healthier side, don't go for the salads. Granted, they aren't large portions, but are heavy on cheese and creamy dressings for the most part. DO try the veggie chili though. Delish.
My rating is missing a fifth star because I think prices are a bit steep for what you get, but otherwise this place is great and I'll definitely keep going back."}
{"text":"Came here for a lunch date in early spring and we were both really pleasantly surprised!

As it was still unseasonably cold in March, we were really happy to be welcomed into this little cozy cottage. It was a weekday so it wasn't too busy and we were seated quickly. We got to choose a nice big booth but were told that we would have to vacate before 4 pm as another party had reserved that specific table, but we had plenty of time and plenty of space to move if we wanted to stay a little longer. My date got he rosemary lamb sausages and I got the smoked salmon salad. Both were so great, and so filling, and so comforting on a chilly, grey afternoon. We were pretty surprised that such a modest place could produce such beautiful and tasty plates. 

We sat for a good few hours enjoying our meal and a couple of beers on tap. The menu is pretty lengthy so I'd love to come back and try something else. If everything else is as good as our meal that day, I've gotta try it all. And this sticky toffee pudding I keep hearing about...sounds pretty tempting!

Service was nice, nothing to complain about. We were a little puzzled, however, that when 4pm rolled around, the other party who had reserved our table hadn't shown up yet! We even switched tables preemptively. We were kind of curious to see who would show up for their specific table! No matter, a super great meal helped make a super great date :) Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Love that Harbord House is situated in an actual house. Serves great brunch food. My favorite is the Canadian Breakfast, but the other brunch dishes look tasty as well. The best part is the strawberry jam that comes with the toast. Not usually a fan of jam, but this one tastes amazing! They're fairly accommodating with substitutions, which is an added bonus. Another huge plus is that you can reserve the top floor of the restaurant for group events at no charge. I have done this a couple of times and it has always been a hit. Haven't tried the non-brunch menu yet."}
{"text":"The wait for a table at Harbord House on a Friday night at 6pm was roughly 45 min. without reservations.  I waited it out, expecting it to end badly but was pleasantly surprised by the service.

I took a seat at the bar on the second floor and grabbed a drink while I waited for the rest of my party of five to arrive.  The waitress on the ground floor had taken my name and assured me that she would let me know once a table was ready.  

Lots of local beers on tap at the bar including one of my new favourites, the Conductor's Craft Ale ($6.05/pint).

Around the 45 min. mark, I was about to check my spot on the waiting list when another waiter said that our table was ready.  They remembered me, more importantly, they remembered that I had been waiting patiently for a table!

We placed our orders for mains - Cobb Salad ($15), Fish and Chips ($14), Blackened Salmon Tacos ($16) and the special of the day, pork schnitzel ($18).  Food came quickly even though the restaurant was packed.  Decent pub food, nothing outstanding.  Was it worth the wait?  Not particularly.

When we left around 8pm, there was still a line up at the door.  I don't think I'd come back if I had to wait again."}
{"text":"The Harbord House is solid especially for brunch and a beer on a lazy Sunday.  The eggs benedict dishes are excellent."}
{"text":"I remember first trying this place with great trepidation a few years ago when it switched over from being Rowers (a place of great nostalgia - it was there, at the first frosh pubnight that us roommates discovered that we had all answered fave music with \"anything but country\"  in our dorm placement questionnaire).  Anyhow, Harbord House is a graduation of sorts and the timing of it coincided happily with my own elevation of tastes from chicken fingers and sugary plum sauce.

Harbord House offers great food, an ample selection of interesting beers with a focus on local fare.  The portion sizes are generous but try to leave enough room for the sinful sticky toffee pudding dessert.  Over the years I've tried quite a few things on the menu including the pulled pork, braised ribs, the salads, fish and chips and the burger.  I have yet to be disappointed.  They offer a tasty watermelon lemonade in the warmer months which goes perfectly with your sunglasses, sandals and a seat on the patio/porch.

They are kid friendly and have at least one high chair. It gets busy at lunch time and the stairs at the entrance are narrow and steep so you might want to leave the stroller at home."}
{"text":"I went for a Tuesday lunch date with my boyfriend and ordered the day's special- seafood pasta with a cream sauce. The food was decent, but right after i ate, I noticed a strange aftertaste. i thought nothing of it, until I immediately felt sick after i finished and had to spend some time in the bathroom as a result. I was perfectly fine before i went to the restaurant.  

Later, my boyfriend ordered coffee and noticed a strange spoiled smell in the creamer-.  I felt nauseous all day.  I'm pretty sure they served both of us expired milk.

I've come here previously and was underwhelmed with the food then too- though it did not cause me a sickness. I don't think ill go back again after this experience.The food is overpriced, bland and not worth your coin"}
{"text":"Harbord is a pub with a nice homey restaurant upstairs. We came for food and left satisfied. I can heartily recommend the fried chicken sandwich (hmm spicy) or the meatloaf. They also had the best side dish of all: a super nice and pleasant server who made the whole experience a joy."}
{"text":"Comfortable Canadiana in dimly lit and wood filled space with notes of that British pub styling. 

Solid good local draught list, not over-done. 

If a burger is what you desire, go for the one with canadian bacon. This time, I got the regular burger and opted to treat myself to cheese. The cheese was minimal on burger and an extra two fifty... sigh. But their food generally seems good. 

I would recommend."}
{"text":"Just want to reiterate my rating. I've been here twice since my last review and the service has been nothing short of stellar. I've come here for brunch on weekends and the staff are extremely helpful."}
{"text":"After a game, our team went here for a beer and something to eat. The atmosphere was cozy and conducive to chatting. We were a walk-in with about 10 people on a Monday night and they were able to accommodate us no problem. The server was friendly and efficient and brought us our drinks quickly. Food also came out reasonably quickly and all at once. 

Unfortunately, my meal was disappointing. I ordered the pea and mint falafel pita with fries - one of two vegetarian options. The server recommended the meal and said she ate it all the time. It was so incredibly dry I literally couldn't swallow it. The pita had been toasted, which took all the moisture out the bread. There was a bit of hummus on the pita but not nearly enough sauce. I brought this up with the server and she brought me a side of white bean spread, which was yummy but still didn't really help the dryness of the sandwich overall. I also noticed that lettuce had been used in the sandwich, rather than the promised tabouleh. The fries were delicious, hot and salty, so I ate all of those, but only a few bites of my pita. 

My recommendations for improving this dish:
1. Don't toast the pita sandwich.
2. Use tabouleh, not lettuce. And more.
3. Add more sauce, but something lighter than hummus/bean spread. Tzatziki, tahini, garlic sauce or hot sauce would work.

Everyone else in my group was satisfied with their meals, but not blown away."}
{"text":"I've been there twice.  Enjoyed it both times.

Goat Cheese & Fig Salad: delicious.  Fresh figs?  Candied nuts?  Count me in!  A light yet filling salad.

Mac N' Cheese: Hot hot hot!  There was some sauce inconsistency & penne isn't my preferred Mac noodle, but it was still pretty good.  A little salty (maybe the Parmesan?) but the side salad helped mix up my taste buds a bit.

Interesting micro-brews are a foot!  Our server seemed quite knowledgeable & everyone was satisfied with their choice.

No room for dessert...next time!"}
{"text":"the burger was delicous! it was so juicy and perfectly cooked.

Came here with a friend today and it was lovely, the service was good and they had my favourite cider on tap. We ordered the calamari to start and everything came out timely and the atmosphere was lovely. Will definitely be coming again."}
{"text":"Expensive. Food is okay but not worth the price. Went for brunch, and it cost $12 + tax and tip for 2 poached eggs, a toast, and some greens."}
{"text":"I was thoroughly surprised to find that their kitchen makes a long list of restaurant-style dinner entres:
- a salad menu!
- chicken pot pie $15
- vegetarian chilli $14
- potato crusted salmon $19

I had the Blackened Salmon Tacos $16 which is a generous dish of 3 large tacos, very liquidy (almost drinkable) chipole mayo, and just a tad off-perfect (maybe A-, almost B+) blackened salmon. 

Their list of Ontario craft beers is great. And it's 12 oz. $4.30 and 20 oz. $6.50 which is such a steal. 

Tiniest restaurant/bar I've ever seen. The stairs make the space tiny. The ground floor seats 12 people (2 tables for four, 2 tables for two) plus maybe 4-5 people at the bar. I would definitely call this a restaurant, not a pub. It's a place for an intimate pub-date, filling food, quiet and we can hear each other. Small tables. omg the table -wow what is that table. It's so small but it works out! I've never sat so close face-to-face at dinner before."}
