{"text":"Ordered delivery chicken egg foo young and crab Rangoon it was cold and the crab Rangoon was over cooked. The chicken foo young was disgusting there was some kinda canned chicken that taste like tuna it was dark colored and very very soft. My meal was completely ruined. The worst Chinese food I've ever had. Only positive is that the delivery guy was expedite and the sprite washed down the nasty meat."}
{"text":"Ming Home has been in Mapletown for many, many years and the food was great back in the 90's. I remember looking forward to getting Chinese food @ Ming Home back then. Now, there food is bland and they are skimpy with the food. I don't know if new management took over or what, but I will never eat there again."}
{"text":"I frequent this place often let's just say I did, please make sure you add up your bill according to the menu I was over charged 7$ last time I was there, it could have been a mistake maybe maybe Not! I wonder how many other times I was over charged.. So pay attention to your bill if you go to this place."}
{"text":"Love the shrimp lo mien.  Great portion sizes. I also like the their egg rolls Which are delicious. A great choice for Chinese food."}
{"text":"Nothing to write home about, nor is there anything to complain about. Everything at Ming Home is consistently average, but sometimes that can be a blessing -- because you know what you're going to get each and every time."}
{"text":"Recently started trying this place. It's the go to place for Chinese food now. Staff is great and it's always fresh hot food. You can even watch them cooking it in front of you."}
