{"text":"Wow, terrible.  My mexican husband and I are from California with a taquiria on each block.  My order was wrong and scary greasy, could only eat the rice.  The salsa was literally soup, just weird, and the beans and chips were def not made in house.  Our meal at home would be about $15, this was $34.  This food just made me sad."}
{"text":"I always root for Cocina Mendoza because of two reasons:  first they are family owned and second, because they are simply such genuine, friendly people.   Those opinions aside, here is a candid review of the restaurant.  Cocina Mendoza is classified, in my mind, as a middling authentic restaurant with standard fare which takes liberties with the mid-Atlantic, or Pittsburgh, palate. Upon entering into the restaurant which has a fairly large sign outside its strip-mall location (free open lot parking) and legit clever decor inside (with music playing and big t.v.'s) you will seat yourself more often than not.  This is traditional.    You will be greeted by one of several friendly, bi-lingual Spanish and English speaking employees who will bring you a basket of corn tortilla chips and red salsa.  The chips are from a bag.  I've had three of their salsas, the standard, the tomatillo, and the chile de arbol.  The standard, house salsa they bring free to your table may or may not be made in house but it is not made with fresh tomatoes or other fresh ingredients.  It is also somewhat sweeter than I prefer though that may be a product of covering up the use of canned tomatoes or perhaps their regional Acapulco recipe is just sweet.  I am not nearly as familiar with Acapulco as I am with many other regions of Mexico. The tomatillo sauce was warmed and has a consistency that reminded me of bottled salsas using corn syrup.  I did not like it either.  The chile de arbol was EXCELLENT the four or five times I've had it.  It tastes delicious, authentic, and spicy in every way.   After trying the salsas, I could tell they are cutting corners in certain ways to make fiscal ends meet.  I totally understand these decisions however if I could make a recommendation to them:  start making 100% fresh, spicy authentic salsas and tortilla chips your family would eat. In this area, salsas set the table for what is to come.  I am confident Cocina Mendoza KNOWS this. As a customer, it is tough to change an opinion after a rough opening act. They will definitely bring in more customers if they properly set the table with an excellent salsa.  After all, they could always hide pre-made ingredients and cut corners with other less obvious dishes and unsuspecting palates.  Despite two of the three failed salsas, I've had between 12 and 15 meals in the restaurant or used their take-out option.  I can easily attest to the fact that their CARNITAS tacos with fresh cut WHITE onion, FRESH cilantro, FRESH cut radish, and fresh lime wedges are truly mouthwatering, moist and delicious.  I believe they'd be proud to serve these tacos, which are on a double soft corn shell, to anyone in the Hispanic community.  Again, I rave about them because they are very, very, very good.  I've had other dishes from bistec to pollo to asada dishes which were  authentic and very well done!  I've also had popular dishes that were pre-made and Americanized (even if they shouldn't be) ... they weren't good and could potentially drive customers away with bad word of mouth experiences. I don't order food I know to be Americanized Mexican.  If I wanted that kind of food I'd just go to Mad Mex or another box restaurant.  Cocina Mendoza makes good food when staying true to their roots. However, they \"Americanize\"  many things, put items like extra big ground beef burritos on the menu, cut corners with obviously pre-made sauces (like enchilada ranchero sauce) or smother dishes with cheese masking depth of flavor leading many to question their overall authenticity and consistency.   In a smart, necessary business decision, Cocina Mendoza caters to all clientele. So, if you are going to go to Cocina Mendoza and order a true Mexican staple and you will almost certainly like your food.  If you order something that is not a traditional staple or you order an authentic something which has a suspect description, or order Tex-Mex you should expect the food to be average at best, watered down, prepared for a dull palate.   Overall, in my opinion, Cocina Mendoza needs to stop trying to straddle the middle ground by being authentic with some things and cutting Americanized corners with others. Or, perhaps, they need to use fresher ingredients and make better Americanized food to cater to the masses.  Hence, the mixed reviews are accurate depending on the customer's palate, the cook of the day, the quality of  ingredients, and which dish was ordered.  Comparison:  Cozumel.  My take:  Your mileage may vary so I have no recommendation."}
{"text":"UPDATE:  I was not able to log into my YELP account so I created a new one, copied and pasted my old review.  I also provided some brief updates.

{"text":"Having moved here from Southern California, I was skeptical that I would be able to find delicious, authentic Mexican food. This place delivers. Sells great michiladas, asada tacos with two corn tortillas (those are my markers for authentic Mexican food).  Bachata and salsa music make me feel right at home.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"A typical average Mexican restaurant. Chips from a bag tasteless tomato soup like salsa. I had a lunch combination with a chile relleno and a steak fajita. The steak was a little chewy and the chile relleno had no bite to it. Rice was the typical Mexican style instant. Service was fine."}
{"text":"When in Pittsburgh I should of had a burger and fries with Heinz ketchup.  Salsa was bland and tacos were nondescript."}
{"text":"The overpriced food here is so-so, the staff is what makes the experience here horrible! The \"owner\" came out to help us resolve the issue, and she was equally horrible and rude!!! I will never eat here again, I would not bring my worst enemy to this restaurant.....avoid at all costs!!!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this restaurant.  I had heard great reviews and there seems to be such a lack of good Mexican food in Pittsburgh.  We arrived on a Sunday evening around 7:30; the Pens game was playing at the bar. All was good. Noticing that the restaurant closes at 9, we quickly ordered and out came the salsa, chips and a few beers. The salsa tasted as if they added plain tomato sauce and the chips were cold and had a stale texture.  We decided to give the guacamole a try (with a fresh, warm basket of chips). It was delicious and the highlight of our meal!  Our Chili Rellenos meals soon arrived and were so disappointing.  Too much breading on the CR and hardly any fillings in the enchilada/taco that accompanied.  The beans and rice were tasty, but dry.  Our waitress was apathetic . We still chalked this up to \"well... it IS a Sunday evening\"   This may sound like an oxymoron, but what really disgusted us was the cleaning. While I am finishing up a meal in a restaurant, the last thing I want to see is a wet, soggy mop (gag) or a staff member standing nearby waiting for me to finish my meal so that she/he can sweep under my table. We saw both right under our noses. At this point it was maybe 8:15. The Pens were still playing, but they shut off the game and started turning chairs upside down (on the tables)  As I stated before, the restaurant was open till 9 o'clock.   We had leftovers. On our way to the car we tossed them in the garbage can. I'm only giving this place 2 stars because of the guacamole."}
{"text":"During my one and only visit to Cocina Mendoza, I had perhaps one of the most disappointing meals I've ever eaten in a Mexican restaurant, and because of this I will never return. It wasn't so much the bland flavor of the food or the crappy salsa. It was the deception, which is why I will not give the place a second chance. I ordered the Carnitas Burrito. Instead of tender,braised pork shoulder, this burrito was stuffed with tiny cubes of tough, dry, lean pork-chop meat, or something like that. Cutting corners in this manner and attempting to fool me is not a good idea if you want my business. Additionally, the guacamole was dark and industrial looking, as if it came from a factory. Exactly what happened to the \"authentic\" Mexican recipes at Cocina Mendoza on their journey from Mexico to Castle Shannon is a mystery. And I'm not sure I want to know the real answer. The only reason this gets two stars is that the guy who waited on me, though inattentive, was nevertheless friendly. Avoid this restaurant."}
{"text":"I lived in Los Angeles for 22 years and Dallas for 20 years and have traveled extensively in Mexico, so I consider myself a good judge of GOOD Mexican food. Well, Unfortunately I didn't find it at Concina Mendoza. In fact, it serves the worst Mexican food I've ever had. I started out with a beef chile relleno  and it was awful. The breading on the chile was soggy and bathed in some sort of soupy sauce. The waitress took it back and I was hesitant to order a replacement but went with the simple ground beef burrito thinking how could they mess up a burrito. Well, they did. I don't know what the meat was inside but it sure didn't taste like beef. I had 2 bites and asked for the check. And by the way, they have a huge sign on the window offering Margaritas for $3.25. When my bill came, they were $5.99. When I questioned why $5.99? the waitress said the $3.25 price was Mon-Thu. Upon leaving I did check the sign and in very small print it does say Mon-Thu but you need a magnifying glass to read it. Taco Bell has far superior food to this place. Don't waste your money here. I spent $22.00 with tip for a margarita, some chips & salsa and 2 bites of a burrito. I'll never eat here again and will make sure my friends & family don't either."}
{"text":"Have been going to Cocina Mendoza since its opening several years back and have never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"I've been to several wanna be authentic Mexican  restaurants here in Pittsburgh.  So my husband and I were kinda hesitant to stop at Cocina Mendoza, but it was a really nice surprise! !  Cocina Mendoza has really good Mexican beer    ( micheladas), and real Mexican food !! My husband had the carnitas plate & he was very happy.  We really enjoyed the food & the service.  Very nice, humble,  attentive and CLEAN!  we will be back soon!!"}
{"text":"Pretty solid Mexican fare. It was a pleasant surprise to discover this place considering Pittsburgh isn't exactly a hotspot for Mexican food.The restaurant is sort of in the middle of nowhere but it's worth the journey.  The tortilla chips to munch on were fresh and good. The enchiladas which I ordered for my entree were excellent."}
{"text":"Today we went to this restaurant for lunch and I feel compelled to write this review. The food was extremely disappointing and the service even more so. We ordered lunch from the menu , which came with refried beans; however, the waitress didn't tell us since it was a special, it didn't come with the refried beans. When questioned, she said she forgot. My husband ordered a steak quesadilla; however, he was served a steak salad. He was told he ordered the salad, which he did        not. He decided to keep it and what a mistake that was. The salad was waterlogged and very limp and soggy. Additionally, the waitress said she checked and he did order the steak quesadilla and it was their mistake. They didn't offer to take it off of our bill. Worst food I have ever been served.  Now for the service. The fajitas came without a spoon to gather and fill the tortillas. They did not come with sour cream and when asked for it, we were charged $.99 for a small serving. I don't know when I have had such poor service and such a lack of concern for a customer's satisfaction. We were never asked if everything was ok or if we needed anything further, including drinks.  She deserved no tip, but we did leave her a 10 percent tip, not our usual 25-30 percent.  I wish I could give them less than one star.   Unless you are starving to death and it is the only place that has food, I would never eat there. So many other good Mexican restaurants to choose from."}
{"text":"I have been there many times. It is a low-key place and very hospitable. At times I have been surprised by the quality of food, but other times food can be below  average. They have a nice menu and I like their enchilada. Their beans are good as well as the salsa. You have to ask for spicy salsa otherwise you will get pretty bland. I think they now have a new server and he is trying to pay more attention tot he customers. Not sure whether he is owner or not."}
{"text":"Good specials, friendly staff, fantastic food.  Salsa was a little runny for my taste. But we have made this a regular stop on Friday nights, especially with  soccer on the tv. See you next week."}
{"text":"The restaurant and the food is good. Nothing spectacular or entirely different or new, but that is okay with me. (Also,  this could be due to the dishes that I order, as they have things on their menu I have yet to see at other Mexican restaurants).   I ate here about 5 times now over about 3 years. The quality of the food has never changed. I usually order the enchiladas Aztecas which is 3 enchiladas with 3 different sauces. This also come with a plate of re fried beans and rice. Priced at about $10.75 - $11.99 (can't remember, but not $12). There is nothing that I don't like and always leave full and satisfied.   The atmosphere is calm and average, and I never felt like the place was unclean. The bar tender has always been friendly to everyone walking in and out of their door.   On Mondays and Wednesdays during happy hour they serve $3.75 margaritas, which to me is a deal! During this time they also have food deals.   Concina Mendoza is usually not my first choice of where to eat, but once I am there I am pleased with the service, the food, and I always leave wanting to try more."}
{"text":"The staff at Cocina Mendoza are so kind and efficient. I love the Mexican dinner offerings. The atmosphere is calming and serene. It's a neighborhood restaurant that deserves to be noticed! The guacamole is fantastic. The drink specials are incredibly inexpensive and delicious. What a find!"}
{"text":"Over ten years in PGH, the only real Mexican food outside of Texas, or the southwest I've had are the Las Palmas street tacos. My daughter was in the mood for a meat dish so we agreed on Cocina Mendoza. (This was my first trip to a Mexican restaurant in sw PA).      We picked a booth with two very cool, and familiar pictures of Pancho Villa staring at us. The chips, and salsa were good, not pico de gallo salsa, but a nice tomato saucy blend of cilantro, maybe a splash of lime, and very little seasoning. The chips were warm, unsalted, and nicely crunchy. I honestly would've been happy eating chips, and salsa while my daughter ate her beef fajitas.       I ordered Combination plate 11, cheese chile relleno, one chicken enchilada, and one beef enchilada with rice, and refried beans. It's been a few years since I've had a good chile relleno, and Mendozas was okay. The charred poblano pepper was about the size of my hand, (5 inches long), and filled with queso fresco, dipped in egg white, and fried. My first time having a chile like this. The shredded chicken enchilada, and the ground beef enchiladas were good enough to stifle my cravings until our summer trip south. The Mexican rice, and refried beans were comfort food on their own level. My daughter picked Mendozas fajitas over Emilianos since she's had both to compare.      Some might describe the food being bland, but I would guess a lot of ethnic food establishments are trying to not scare off those with sensitive taste buds. Fortunately, Cocina Mendoza provides salt, pepper, and Tapatio hot sauce at the table, don't hesitate to use them!      The decor was inviting, very traditional Mexican restaurant style, and our server was friendly, maybe shy. I'd go back to Cocina Mendoza, it hit the right spot, and was worth braving a gray, cold January day."}
{"text":"Have been to Cocina Mendoza many times.  Food is always consistent: decent Mexican food close to home - this is not a destination restaurant.  Service is the real downfall here.  Service has always been slow, as there is usually only one server (sometimes two) for the whole place.  On the most recent visit: I was never asked if I needed a refill/needed anything, no one cleared our plates, I waited about 20 mins for the check & had to go to the bar to ask for carry-out containers.  The food & atmosphere aren't good enough to make poor service tolerable."}
{"text":"Okay, I know Pittsburgh isn't exactly a hotbed of amazing Mexican food.  But holy cow was this bad.   Caveat: nice staff, friendly ambiance. I'd go back for the bar. Just not for the food.   Everything was tepid when it arrived. The beans were congealed. The chicken tasted like it came out of a can. No dressing on the salad.   I'm the worst cook in the world and my burritos are better than that. Yikes.   I don't have especially high standards, which makes it all the more amazing that I thought this was awful.  Sorry guys. I wanted to like your food!"}
{"text":"Solid authentic Mexican food. Close knit Mexican family. Servers are a little unfriendly, but who cares when you're digging into endless chips and 4 kinds of salsa. We were seated at the bar, which was uncomfortable because of a large edge. Great food, Coronas a plenty, and Spanish tv."}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican food. Everything tastes fresh and healthy. No like other places where they over salt the food."}
{"text":"We frequently visit this establishment and enjoy it every time.  Stick to the classics - tacos, burritos, etc and you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Great place of you want to have a lot of Mexican food. Portions were generous for the dinners. Some of the components were in the bland side but overall everything tasted like any other Mexican place. Margaritas were disappointing as they were mostly ice. Service was kind of slow too. I would go back if I am craving Mexican food and don't want to drive very far to get it."}
{"text":"Really solid Mexican restaurant. Been here twice and each time it was a good experience. I plan on going back many more  times. Staff is really friendly. I would rate their food 4 stars since it's nothing extraordinary, just the basic Mexican food we all love. Since their staff is so friendly I am giving them 5 stars."}
{"text":"Good, reasonably priced Mexican food without all the \"bling\" that was Chi Chi's.  We have eaten at Cocina Mendoza since it was located in South Park, and like it even better at it's location in Lebo. The menu has lots of combo platters that allow you try a little bit of everything."}
{"text":"Not fantastic, but not bad.  Salsa was good but needed a little more heat - we added a few drops of the hot sauce on the table, which helped.  I had 2 cheese chile rellenos, which most restaurants cover with red enchilada sauce.  Here, they were covered with diced tomatoes, pineapple, and something else - green olives, maybe.  The breading was a little thick and tended to overpower the flavor of the chile.  The chiles could have used a bit more cheese.  On the side, instead of rice and beans, these come with rice and steamed baby carrots and broccoli.  I thought the veggies could have used a little more time in the steamer.  Overall, I felt like they were trying to make a healthier twist on chiles rellenos, which is nice, but I kind of like them covered in sauce and oozing cheese.  Other minor gripes: they were out of plain Pepsi - only diet and Mountain Dew.  They only take Visa, not Mastercard.  The atmosphere was a little quiet and subdued.  I think this place is ok but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here again.  Coupons available on their website."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place, really I did. I lived most of my life in the Southwest with a lot of time spent in Mexico. The menu looks nice, the decor is nice, it smells pretty good. The reality is less than great. Stale tasting chips. A bland salsa verde tasting mainly of canned tomatoes. I'm willing to give it another try if only to get a margarita which frankly looked pretty good."}
{"text":"Have been eating at Mendoza's for the last 10 years.  Initially, we had to drive to Noblestown road, then Bethel Park and finally, they moved to Mt. Lebanon.  Mendoza's is delicious, authentic Acapulco type food.  I look at some of the posts on this site and realize that most Americans do not recognize authenticity.  Fish tacos and a variety of shrimp dishes is a dead giveaway.  Pricing is good and alcohol is typical prices.  I've taken my family of 5 for dinner, no alcohol and the bill is always under $50-60.  Abraham the owner and Fernando the head waiter are great.  Very accomodating.  Lastly, there used to be a Taco Bell one block away from Mendoza's.  After a year, the Taco Bell's business had dropped off so far that they closed.  If this is not a testament to the quality and affordability of this restaurant, nothing else will convince you to give them a try."}
{"text":"I've heard good things so my husband and I stopped in here one night when he had a hankering for Mexican. Honestly, I feel a 3.5 rating would be appropriate but rounding up to 4.   The restaurant is really clean and decently sized. As soon as you are seated, a server will place chips and salsa at your table, which is nice since some places charge for chips and salsa. The menu is a little overwhelming with a ton of combination plates, which can be cumbersome to read through each description to figure which combination you're most interested in. I can get over this, though, since combination platters give you a taste of different items and I'm all about sampling. In terms of taste, I thought the flavors were rather mild in comparison to some other Mexican restaurants I've been to. If you're looking for Mexican that's not too spicy, consider giving Cocina Mendoza a try. While the food tasted okay, it didn't quite stand out to me. What did have wow factor was the price of drinks! The drink menu was very reasonably priced compared to what other restaurants typically charge.   I'll probably be back. If not to try other items from the menu, then definitely for the drinks!"}
{"text":"This place has not only the worst Mexican food that I have ever had, but quite possibly the worst food that I have ever been served in a restaurant!! We could tell immediately that our lunch was going to be terrible. The salsa that accompanied the chips was more like marinara sauce. We had to season it ourselves with salt, pepper and whatever hot sauce was available on the table. The entrees were not any better. I'm not sure if they don't have salt, pepper or any other seasonings in the kitchen, but it didn't seem like any made it's way into our dishes. The refried beans were burned and tasteless as well. Avoid at all costs, unless you've never left Pittsburgh and have no idea what authentic Mexican tastes like."}
{"text":"Great service and authentic food! I highly recommend this restaurant and encourage others to give it a shot!"}
{"text":"This is a nice, small friendly Mexican restaurant in the Lebanon Shops strip mall on Mt Lebanon Blvd.   The interior has some booths along the walls and tables in the middle. There is a bar with some stools. I sat at the bar.   They have a full bar, but no draft beer, only bottled beer with a selection of about 10 or so beers, mainly Mexican and a few American beers like Budweiser and Yuengling.   The menu is very large with a lot of choices. Prices are about average. They have daily specials that are posted on the window of the restaurant. When I went, the special was chimichangas for $9.99. I decided to get this. It was pretty good with a nice sauce but I didn't care for the ground beef filling. The dish comes with either rice or beans. I got the beans, which were standard refrigerator beans.   They give you complimentary chips and salsa, which were ok, and I was glad they didn't give you too many chips like some restaurants do, since I don't want to overindulge.   This is a nice place to stop by if you're in the neighborhood and want some Mexican food."}
{"text":"I really don't enjoy giving bad reviews but I have to be honest and try to dissuade you guys from throwing your money away here!  Right out of the gate, the tortillas had no flavor and the salsa was so bland, even my iced tea was so strong I couldn't enjoy it.   Our meals came out and the presentation wasn't bad but the filling in my taco tasted like a sloppy joe, the sauce on my enchilada was so sour, my boyfriend said maybe it's lime, I said \"I taste no lime\" when he tasted his, he couldn't believe how sour the sauce was, being a chef he immediately thought it may have been fermented but hopefully it was lime zest??? Lol. That's the first time my boyfriend didn't finish a meal  32.00 bucks down the drain!"}
{"text":"Second time here. We sat at the bar and got the same bar tender, who we liked a lot the first time. everyone is friendly. The margaritas were just as good as we remembered, the perfect combo of sweet and sour. We got a \"meal for 2\". Everything was great, including the price!"}
{"text":"It's good. It's what I would call a traditional Mexican restaurant. They have appetizers (cheese dip, guacamole, etc.), they have specialties, and they have combos and sides.   The chips are very good, warm, thin, and crisp. The salsa is very good but not spicy.   Service is friendly and quick. The only negative is the pricing, which is a bit high for what it is. Dinner combos are $12-$15. You'll leave well fed; portions are pretty large, but at this price-point, they are competing with more upscale restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Great food and service I have been here multiple times and it is my go to mexican place."}
{"text":"We have never actually ate in the restaurant but have gotten take out a few times. My latest decision, the meal for two number 1. Wow! That's a lot of food for $26 dollars. There were apps. Cheese quesadillas and chicken taquitos. There was an entree. Huge shrimp, chicken, steak, peppers, onions with cheese melted on top. Flour tortillas on the side. Speaking of sides. Everything you could ask for. A quart of rice! A quart of refried beans! Yikes. I wouldn't want to be around the person who ate those beans. Guacamole, salsa and sour cream. This was quite the Mexican feast! And the flavors were fantastic. My only criticism is that the entree consisted of mostly shrimp and was short on the steak. Overall, CM has great, authentic food for very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"A very cute little restaurant tucked away in Castle Shannon. Family owned and super friendly staff. Food was okay... not the worst, not the best. I enjoyed the steak enchilada that was part of my combo but the steak taco was dry. They do give you chips and salsa as soon as you sit down but the salsa was bland. Overall, a decent place, nothing outstanding."}
{"text":"Working close by, I get takeout from here a lot. So, while I can't claim to know what their table service is like, their takeout always takes just about 15 minutes. Their tacos are amazing - I love the sauce that comes with the carnitas tacos. Anything else I've ordered has always been tasty, mostly enchiladas and their giant chimichangas. And as an extra plus, it usually lasts me for two days of lunches.  I walked down to the store and forgot my wallet once. The owner told me to come back later and pay for my check instead of rushing back and forth. He wanted me to eat my food while it was hot. You definitely don't see that level of trust and friendliness from most restaurants."}
{"text":"This place is ok.  It's not great, but it's solidly ok.  I was there with my father, sister, and brother in law.  Our dinner came to $110.00.  We had ordered 6 margaritas (between four of us) and the drinks were $45.00.  Given this was a strip mall mexican place, we were not expecting this so I want to mention this as a word of caution.  I dont think it's over priced, but we just weren't expecting it to be over $100.  I hate when people complain that local mexican restaurants dont serve authentic food.  We live in Pittsburgh, not El Paso.  This was pretty good!  All the cheesy beefy spicy goodness I crave in Mexican food was present.  I ahd dinner #2.  It was one fajita, one taco, one burrito, and one quesadllla.  Needless to say, I brought most of it home.  The quesadilla was just meh, but a quesadilla is just cheese on a tortilla.  The taco was good but very salty.  If I got back, I'll try the fish tacos.  The service was good but disorganized.  My father had the sapapillas for dessert and was expecting little pillows of fried dough--chi chi's restaurant style.  We got fried tortillas w sugar and ice cream on them.  He wasn't very impressed.  My brother in law had the flan and said it was great.  The margaritas were excellent!  Certainly worth $45.  Very strong, we were all feeling a little bubbly when we left dinner!  I tried the frozen mango margarita, and I loved it.  It was like alcoholic candy.  Highly recommend.  I'd go back, and I'd recommend it if you're hungry in the South Hills.  It's not a fancy restaurant; but its a simple Mexican joint with pretty alright food."}
{"text":"We recently tried Cocina Mendoza, mostly because it was close and I had a hankering for fake Mexican.  (Hello, Pittsburgh -- these places are NOT authentic... Mexicans don't use flour tortillas for starters nor do they cheese the hell out of everything.  I'm guessing the people who would call these sorts of places authentic also think Olive Garden and Benihana are authentic.... But I digress.)  Anyhow, I was expecting an el camps level experience.  But it wasn't even that good.  (Side note: why is the el camp's on McKnight so vastly superior to the other locations?) It was just bland as heck and the service, while pleasant, was really slow.  Despite the place being empty.  Prices were what you'd expect.  On the upside, portions were huge if you're into that type of thing.  Of the three of us who went together, the best thing had was a chicken quesadilla... not a good sign.  For this type of a joint, I definitely prefer El Paso over in Bridgeville.  If you want something resembling real Tex Mex/Mexican, it's worth the drive to Los Chiludos (which wins hands down).  Honestly, I'd pick a Moe's over this one.... We won't be back."}
{"text":"Chips and salsa were not good - salsa tasted like pasta sauce. Husband liked his chorizo potato tacos, but this place didn't have great options for vegetarians. I had to ask if I could make my own vegetarian combo. I got a combo with a cheese quesadilla, bean enchilada, & chile rellano - didn't enjoy it at all. The black beans on the side were good. Needless to say, we won't be back. There are other places in this area that cost the same and have better food. Service was also underwhelming."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem in the South Hills with great authentic Mexican food and drinks.  It is a typical Mexican restaurant atmosphere inside and is a little small.  However, they make up for that with their great food and great service.  All of the workers I have dealt with have been very friendly and helpful.  The food usually comes out pretty fast as well.  Until my recent trip to Contado, this place was my favorite queso in Pittsburgh.  It has so much flavor and is the perfect consistency.  For my meal I usually go with the cheesesteak burrito which is delicious.  You can tell everything is freshly made.  I have also had several of the combo platters and always been satisfied."}
{"text":"This is the only Mexican restaurant my boyfriend and I will ever go to. We've tried something different each time and haven't been disappointed yet! I also love their hot salsa that they have with their chips. I actually get it on the side and have it with all my tacos too!"}
{"text":"We love it here. The margaritas are literally the best I've ever tried. The various salsas offered on weekends are great. We love Abraham and the staff is friendly. I enjoy the enchiladas. Overall, we go here when we want a better version of the other Mexican restaurants around."}
{"text":"I came here as a lone diner. I asked to sit at the bar, and the waiter obliged. The bartender was friendly and I got a Mango Margarita. At first, I wasn't a huge fan of the sugar around the glass rim, but with the Mango, it really worked instead of salt. Well made, tasty. The bartender was attentive and I got a Corona and shot of Malibu coconut rum to pour in once drinking the neck (highly recommend). He had no issue with my customer bartender shenanigan.  Warm tortilla chips and three different salsas kept me company while I made up my mind on what to order (plenty of selections here!) and waited for my food to arrive.  I got the Mexican Plate #3 for dinner. I opted for Sour Cream instead of Guacamole, as it was a ton of food and I wasn't going to need (read: probably couldn't handle) the increased depth that guac adds to a meal. This meal was huge. A relleno, a steak burrito, a chicken fajita, a beef taco, all with a side of refried beans and Mexican rice.   The relleno was done well, with the cheese inside being a great consistency. Adding some of the beans and rice to a forkful, and this thing was fantastic. The steak burrito was sizeable, and filled with a decent amount of steak, rice, and other fixings. Sour cream worked really well with it. The chicken fajita was great, with the chicken being seasoned well and the onions and peppers adding a perfect mix of flavor. The beef taco was the only lackluster-y part of the meal, but how do you really compare a hard-shell taco to the rest of the above? The beef was seasoned well and the cheese on top was good. Beware if you go this route; This is a TON of food. and it's all delicious and you're not going to want to stop.  I'll definitely come back here whenever I want a good Mexican experience. I am very happy and full, hours later."}
{"text":"Really didn't live up to my expectations - salsa is bland and gross.  The food was also bland and gave me terrible heartburn.  I am an avid Mexican food lover and rarely get heartburn in general.  I had the cheese enchiladas, my husband and friends liked their food but they also said it was somewhat bland.  My friend who ordered plate #2 had to ask for jalapeños on the side to add some spice.  I don't think I'll be going here again, which is a shame since I live less than a mile away."}
{"text":"Great food and margaritas!  Food was, in my opinion, authentic. Margaritas were perfect. No sours mix, just tequila and lime. Just the way they should be. Awesome rice and beans too!"}
{"text":"We loved this place. The staff here was so nice and attentive, our waitress was the sweetest and always smiling. Their salsa trio they bring was so good, and all of their food from the tamales to the fajitas were delicious. It's definitely better than your average run of the mill Mexican restaurant. We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I had to tell you all about one of the BEST MARGARITA I EVER had , (ok , so I had 3 ) DAMN They were good !   Not the chemical taste of the one that I had at another place . I don't like to mention names (Mad Mex)  I ordered the special of the day ( Mexican number 2 Dinner ) Little taste of everything , and everything was delicious. If your Hungry and really enjoy Mexican food , you should order this plate.  The staff all spoke broken English , ( True Mexicans ! ) Very Authentic.  The salsa was bland , could have used a little more spice , but I fixed that problem with a plentiful application of the hot sauce supplied on the table.  over all , a very good diner decision"}
{"text":"I have eaten at Cocina Mendoza on many occasions, but none recently (they close at 9pm & my schedule didn't allow me to get there).  The Mendoza family are very nice & cordial. The food is awesome. I ordered the Dinner Plate Acapulco Style, which has a crab cake, 4 shrimp, a cheese chile relleno, veges & rice. Awesome as usual.  One tip: don't order anything with chicken. The chicken is pre-cooked & can get overcooked when prepared for you."}
{"text":"The older man (not sure if he's the owner or the manager) has the strangest sense of humor. But funny nonetheless. He took our order, a table of 6, and told us that they were out of rice. We all believed him until he brought our orders back with rice as the side.  He brought this container with three different salsas, one red, one green and one cheesy yellow that was on FIRE! Don't get me wrong, I love spicy foods but this one had no flavor, or it killed our taste buds, we will never know. The waiter/owner/manager got the birthday girl the wrong meat on her quesadillas but he did surprise her with a tostadas and ice-cream with a candle on top. My fish tacos had only one corn tortilla per taco so I had to eat them with a fork, even though they were very tasty and flavorful.   The place was pack on that particular saturday night and all the servers were running around that it took a while to find us a table. We sat at the bar for a few beers until they were able to clean up a table for us.  Even thought we were here a few years ago, and weren't too impressed by it (the decor was average -and still is- and so was the food) we may come back to an earlier time if we're in the area.  Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Second time here and the food is fine. I got a pork burrito, my husband got the carnitas, which is the pulled pork. Mine was definitely lacking in flavor, but the carnitas was better and I would probably order it again. The rice in the burritos tasted similar to rice-a-roni, which was a bit disappointing. Refried beans were good.  Complimentary tortilla chips are served fresh and warm with salsa, which was soupy & enjoyable. A tiny kick of spice but definitely tolerable and enjoyable for a spice avoider like me.   Service is fast, servers are friendly. Wish their hours were later for some weekend margaritas, but what can you do."}
{"text":"It was ok.the chips and salsa are always the first impression and they were preety lame.chips not fresh and salsa too tomatoee.portion were good food had reasonable flavor,staff was nice.i would go back if was in the area and wanted mexican."}
{"text":"This is our goto Mexican restaurant in the Mt Lebo area.  The food is good, service is fast & friendly and the margaritas are always delicious.  I get the Rebozo or chorizo tacos and can't seem to talk myself into trying anything else because they're so good."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants. Being from south Florida, I love Mexican/Latin American foods. That being said. They are a family owned business. The servers and staff are very friendly and welcoming. The wait on a busy night is never very long.   My favorite meal to get here is the Mexican plate #3. All of their plates are very filling and enough to take some home for a second meal. Tonight I tried the vegetarian plate #1. It had a chile relleno( my love), a vegi fajita, a cheese quesadilla, a cheese enchilada, and a side of rice and refried beans. All for $12.99!   The prices are great! The service is good on regular night. The margaritas are yum! I love their fried ice cream. They accommodate children and larger parties. I will always recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great family owned business in the heart of the Mt. Lebanon shops. Excellent service and good quality food."}
{"text":"We tried this place twice.  The first time, they had only been open a few days.  So it was a disaster (super busy night, people waiting even outside, general mayhem).  The food was mediocre at best, so we thought maybe we'd wait a bit before returning to let them \"get the kinks out\".    We waited a year and returned.  The food was once again bland and the service left a lot to be desired.  Also, way overpriced for what you actually get.  I wouldn't even care if it was bland and you had the option of different sauces to liven things up, but that is not the case.  Additionally, they definitely use jarred salsa.  It was not fresh.  Disappointing and will not return."}
{"text":"I love that this is a family owned business. Everyone working is extremely kind and quick. I have never waited over 10ish minutes for my meal.   When you sit down you get chips & salsa which I always enjoy. You have to get the queso, some of the best around. The salsa is a bit tomatoey for me.  There are a TON of options, which is a bit overwhelming, but you should have no problem finding something you like. The rice is yummy and the enchiladas have the perfect spice. The portions are LARGE. My husband and I typically split a meal.  Margaritas on a normal day are $6. Meals are around an average of $11.   All around a fun atmosphere and a good place to check out!"}
{"text":"I can see that the this place got mixed reviews and I understand why. My meal was good (I had the vegetarian platter #2). You do get free tortilla chips as you do at most Mexican restaurants but the salsa was runny and just okay in my opinion. Also, our margarita was disappointingly small and was 75% ice.   The service was very friendly but it seemed unorganized because we were waited on several people who kept coming up to us asking if we had been helped yet. It was busier when we were there though so that was probably contributory. I would describe the decor as cheesy. Meals possibly overpriced.   Overall, I rate this place as average. Fine if you are craving Mexican but wouldn't go out of my way to go here."}
{"text":"Food was okay...service was TERRIBLE!!! It took 25 minutes for someone to take our order.  After that the waitress didn't return to bring our food (a runner did), didn't check on us throughout the whole meal, and then didn't bring us our check for over 15 minutes after we were finished!  Because of the terrible service I would never go back.  Also the strawberry margarita was the worst margarita I have ever had! It was pure sugar syrup.  Get the lime if you want one."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located in s very small strip mall in Castle Shannon. By the look of the strip mall you would not have high hopes for a restaurant. However when you walk you see that it is the real deal-real Mexican food. Mendoza's is owned by a Hispanic family. They are very kind and give great customer service.  I ordered a Taco Salad with Chicken. The taco bowl was very light, thin, and crispy. It had crisp lettuce, shredded chicken, sour cream, pico, and guacamole. I'm a huge guacamole and theirs is very good. It had small chunks of Avacado instead of being pureed like a lot of guacamole is.  The pico also had a great flavor. The chicken was so good that you didn't need all of the extras.  My hubby ordered steak tacos. You could choose from hard shell or the authentic soft. We chose soft. The steak was cut into small cubes. It had a lot of onion-a little more than I would Iike, but my husband liked all of the onions. The tacos had fresh cilantro and they came with a lime wedge to squeeze over them. The icing on the cake was the spicy sauce that came with them. .  They have a full bar and a big menu. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm a little stingy on 5's or they would totally get one!  Authentic food, great salsa verde (get it on anything), great tamales and everything was solid to say the least. Margaritas were very good with homemade simple syrup and fresh lime juice for only $4.25. Sat at the bar and had great service. My girlfriend and I will be there most Wednesday nights at the bar if you want to drop in(kids eat 1/2 off Wed or we would hit a table sometimes)."}
{"text":"Eaten here several times. The fish tacos were not crisp, rather, soggy, with no sauce. Refried beans ok, guacamole just ok. Not many mexican options nearby."}
{"text":"Now, I'm from Arizona so this review may seem a bit unfair. I compare all Mexican food, especially when claiming to be authentic, to the food I grew up with.  Cocina Mendoza is not even close to authentic. Extremely bland, corn and carrots in the rice, chicken tasted like it came out of a can, soggy taquitos, the list goes on. I didn't expect to find great Mexican in Pittsburgh, but this place is just awful.   I'll be nice and rate it one star higher than it deserves."}
{"text":"Celebrating Cinco de Mayo with my girlfriend. Service was great and we didn't mind waiting for the food given that there was a 45 minute wait for a table. Our waitress was constantly checking to get us drinks, food recommendations, etc. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"What the *bleep* is wrong (and by wrong I mean AWESOMELY RIGHT) with you, Pittsburgh?!  It is a well-known fact that Mexican restaurants all across the nation have a tendency to stuff you with food, enticing you to eat a veritable smorgasbord of cheesy, meaty, spicy goodness piled high on plates the size of hubcaps until you surrender to the inevitable food coma and wake up two days later STILL REALLY FULL.  I figured that Cocina Mendoza would be similar in this respect.  Except that I'd forgotten that THIS!  IS!  PITTSBURGH!  ... which means that their \"Meal for Two\" specials are completely misleading, unless by \"two\" you mean \"two veteran champions of the International Federation of Competitive Eating\".  For the rest of us mere mortals, it's more like a meal for 4 ... or 6.  And how tasty the food is!  Crunchy, meaty, dreamy taquitos.  Lovely fajitas with tender chicken and succulent marinated steak.  Quesadillas that must have been half an inch thick at the very least, oozing with lovely queso.  And refried beans and Spanish rice so tightly packed into their to-go containers that you swear that the wonders of modern compression technology (here's looking at you, Lempel-Ziv-Markov) must have been involved somehow.  Glorious!  My wife -- who is herself an accomplished Mexican cook -- comments that the food is very \"homemade\" in nature, prepared with love by people who obviously care a lot about food.  She likes one of the salsas in particular so much that she wants to go with me to see if she can get the recipe from the cooks there.  That's high praise coming from someone who was taught by a Mexican housewife whose food was the envy of the entire neighborhood.  And now, as I sink further and further into my food coma, I repeat: what the *bleep* is wrong (and by wrong I mean AWESOMELY RIGHT) with you, Pittsburgh?!"}
{"text":"I thought it was fresh, delicious and \"authentic\" (as far as i understand the word in relation to Mexican food).  The Mendoza Dinner Enchildas were three corn tortillas stuffed with spiced shredded chicken and topped with a tangy tomatillo sauce and diced tomatoes and lettuce.  I'm a fan!  gimme more!  next time, will go for dinner so i can thoroughly pig-out.  weird location in a suburban strip mall."}
{"text":"Authentic mexican food. Between my husband and I we have tried several items on the menu and everything was good. My favorite is the carnitas dinner. Service is slow and a little unfriendly but worth the food. Id rank it higher than most other mexican restaurants in the south hills area."}
{"text":"It was Mum's birthday, and she wanted Mexican food, but ever since Chi Chi's went bust, our options were limited, until now.   Cocina Mendoza is what I would describe as a Mexican diner. There are tables, chairs, a counter. Mexican music flirts shamelessly with your ears. They even serve breakfast on weekends: Mexican and \"traditional.\"   I ordered the Mexican Plate #2 which gets you a taco, a burrito,  a fajita, and a cheese quesadilla with Mexican rice, and refried beans. You can choose between chicken or beef (I went with beef), sour cream or guacamole (I went with guac, Jacques.).  I am a ground beef junkie, and man, was it as fresh as it was savory with none of the crackermeal filler you find at other Mexican restaurants. The tortilla that comprised the taco was crisp, crunchy, and sinfully deep fried. The burrito was my favorite of all the things that I tried, the beef mixed with the cheese and rice making for a thick and filling feast in itself. The terrific guacamole pleased this avocado fan.   I had to try the sopapilla since it's not often I get to have them, and it was as flaky, crunchy, and richly sweet as a turnover or croissant.  Mine was served with some Neopolitan ice cream.   The Pico de Gallo sauce was NUCLEAR! And that's how my dad likes it. I had a few tastes of it. WOOOHOOO!!! It almost put me through the roof and into orbit! Man alive!  We all liked the Ranchero Salsa as well, which was soupy, sweet, and refreshing.   The service was fast and friendly to boot.   So if you're in the South Hills and hankering for good Mexican food, here you are. I hope they stay around for a spell. Excelente!"}
{"text":"Good mexican food.  Was talking with the bar tender cuz we had 4 and he suggested \"A meal for Two #1 or #2.  We took that recommendation and order #1.  Really good meal and plenty for 4.  A large plate with a combination of shrimp, chicken and charbroiled steak with onions, tomatoes, red and green peppers, cilantro and more.  Served with rice and refried beans, guac, sals, tow small cheese quesadillas and four totillas.  Yum!  The food came out nice and hot, not to spicy but very flavorful, veggies were not overcooked (which seems to happen at many other restaurants), and the shrimp, chicken and steak were good.   Nice meal and good recommendation!"}
{"text":"Not authentic Mexican food. It barely comes across as food in general. The chips were stale and the salsa was offensively bad. You can tell canned tomatoes were used as it tasted of metal. The fish tacos were on store bought tortillas and had no flavor or seasoning. The rice tasted as if it had gone off. My fiancées lackluster breakfast burrito was served with a hunk of iceberg lettuce and a dash of tomatoes. I wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy. I'd go so far as to say that this imposter Mexican restaurant won't be open for long. I'm hoping I don't get sick today."}
{"text":"This restaurant does a very good job. The portions are generous so much so that I had to take some of mine home. I had a taco, tostada, enchilada and fajita. The fajita was the only thing I didn't like. The other three were very good and tasty. The server was very friendly and the place is very clean. I'll go again."}
{"text":"We were so excited to have stumbled across a great little Mexican place in the South Hills that we dashed in with a party of 4 on a Saturday night without a second thought. Very soon after our hopes were dashed and or appetite was answered with a heaping spoon of disappointment.    INITIAL IMPRESSIONS  - When our waitress came over to take our drink orders, she had no clue what variety of margaritas they offered.  She was unsure of the difference between salt and sugar.  Both she, and the bartender, needed clarification on what a \"Captain and Diet\" was.   -Margaritas were fine once the order was corrected, but the aforementioned Captain and Diet was a watery mess. Either they aren't using top shelf as advertised (and paid for) or they are watering down their liquor.  As a Pittsburgh-dwelling, borderline alcoholic the one thing I know with absolute certainty is how my rum is supposed to taste.  SERVICE AND ORDERING  - One line will sum this up, NICKEL AND DIME.  With your entree its not rice AND beans, rather it's \"Rice OR Beans?\".  God forbid you want both, like at any other Mexican restaurant in the world,  Your sin is punished with a $5 up-charge.  -Similarly, you are given a choice of sour cream OR guacamole with your entree.  You guessed it, $5 more.  - Overall the service was a disaster. Between the waitress, owner and bartender there was a total failure to launch.  Repeated requests for extra napkins, more chips, a glass of water, or even the rest of our order were put off for an embarrassingly long time, some never answered at all.  FOOD  - Don't come here looking for great salsa.  Their recipe is no more than pureed tomatoes, cilantro and a dash of vinegar.  No heat and no flavor.  - The food served to us was average in terms of Mexican cuisine.  Nothing mind blowing but not quite dog food either.  Think, better than Taco Bell but falling far short of Emiliano's or even Mad Mex.  Really, the bottom line to this review is that this place has so-so food at an over-market price and terrifyingly subpar service.  Honestly, this was a very disappointing experience for us, as we wanted so much to love Cocina Mendoza.  Maybe we can chalk this up to growing pains. I would be willing to give them a second chance in a year or so, if they make it that long."}
