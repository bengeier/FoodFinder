{"text":"Stopped by on a recommendation from a friend.  Had the shredded beef brisket.  Absolutely loved it.  They did not add sauce to it, but had three sauces in a warmer so you can add our own.  This was perfect for me so not too much or to little.  Had the Mac and Cheese for a side.  It must be loaded with calories since it was super yummy.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The staff didn't know the pricing, the menu didn't have prices for some items and they didn't have much left of meats.  When I was getting ready to pay for the food I waited at the register to pay for a little to long with the staff standing there doing nothing.  The pulled chicken and leg quarter were dry and flavor less, the ribs didn't have much flavor so we had to smoother it with bbq sauce, the sides of green beans with bacon had no bacon or flavor, the side of mac and cheese didn't have flavor, the corn bread was overly dry and the portions were not worth the price. With all that has been said I'm sorry to say it but I will not be going back"}
{"text":"I drove by this place a few days and the smell of BBQ pulled me in.  I was not disappointed - very good food, friendly staff.  Had mac & cheese and some brisket. Both were very tasty.  I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Fantastasic! Burnt tips and mac n cheese were delish. Cornbread, too. Def going back."}
{"text":"My mom had a moist and meaty brisket sandwich with a really crisp vinegar-based cole slaw. I enjoyed the dry rub ribs and BBQ beans. We also tried the G-Mac pasta salad with pasta shells, crunchy veggies and a light dressing which was so yummy. What a great start for a new place. We'll be back for the stuffed potato! Atmosphere is casual with picnic tables inside and out."}
{"text":"Great BBQ, Mac and cheese and 3 different sauces to choose from. Staff was so friendly and food was really good and well prices! Would go back in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"First time here and will definitely be back.  The meats were so tender and delicious that they didn't even need the bbq sauce.  The brisket was out of this world!  You can tell the sides are homemade.  Way better than Lucille's and Rollin Smoke.  Portions were good and prices were very resonable for the quality of food. Can't wait to come back to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"I can count on one hand \"good\" BBQ in Henderson/Las Vegas. Tucky's blows them all away. THE. BEST. BBQ in the valley! Yeah, they have BBQ sauce, but you won't need it.  Faves = tri-tip, brisket, slaw, potato salad."}
{"text":"Very disappointed! Brisket was good; however all sides dishes were not even average. This was our first time but definitely our last! We had mac & cheese, beans, potato salad. don't recommend wasting your money and time."}
{"text":"Probably the worst meal I ever ate. Meat was full of tiny bones and cartelage, slaw was very salty and mac and cheese was over cooked. Would rate less than one star but wasnt an option."}
{"text":"Great food. Reasonable prices. The staff was friendly and welcoming. Definitely will recommend to my friends."}
{"text":"Ok bbq. Went for lunch today. It was good, but not great. I had the burnt ends, very good, with mac & cheese and baked beans. The sides were very basic, no tender love and care. The restaurant was very nice, western style inside, soft music, 3 huge tv's with the menu on them at the order line. I'd go back, but wont make a special trip to go. Its worth a try."}
{"text":"This is my favorite BBQ place in town.  The brisket is my main choice and is unbelievable.   Had wings once and the were also great.  Highly suggest you give it a try."}
{"text":"They got rid of the machine tea! Bumped up the rating."}
{"text":"The best bbq in town. I have had bbq from most of the local places but a friend told me to try  this place. I'm glad I did and will be a regular customer."}
{"text":"I found this place on yelp i said why not try a new and inviting place.  I walked in and was greeted by the workers and management and felt right at home . There place was clean so i knew there food had to be good . I didn't know what i wanted until i saw the beef  tips and they was cooked to perfection burnt on the ends the sauce was glazed over given the  flavor  of the slow and low cooked tips Additional flavor and the homemade dipping sauce all three of them was on point.  Mac and cheese yes please.  Everything is home made not out of a can like most places.  This place is the spot for inviting food and hospitality. Check em out . They really know there BBQ!!!"}
{"text":"What a hidden gem! Passed by this Bbq house while running errands and so glad I eentvin to give it a try. The local gas station/oil change place next to it said it was really good and so are the pit fries. They open at 11 a.m. and are open until they sell out of goodies. The outside looks ok, but the signage is clear. The inside was really clean and welcoming. They had wooden picnic style tables with paper towels for the napkins-like a decent bbq joint should. We were welcomed right a way and they have an assortment of sandwiches, sides, and just meats if you want. I ordered the mac and cheese, pulled pork sandwich, peach cobbler, and the pit fries ( pulled pork, fries, cheese, and green onions ). Food came out hot and fresh. Everything was so tasty and not too sweet or salty. This place is makes legit bbq and the people that work there are sweet. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Good stuff. Mac n chz was a lil over cooked and mushy but the flavor was good and that's my only complaint. Me and the wife had pulled pork sammy, brisket, bologna, pot salad, mac n chz, corn bread, and baked beans. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Do not eat here! Their portions are super small! We ordered a bbq for 2 and we got 4 tiny ribs!!! And little bit of brisket. The cornbread tasted strange. The ribs weren't that great.  We got 2 small sides.  The same day we went to Famous Daves BBQ. We ordered a slab of ribs and 2 sides with cornbread for 4 dollars less.  WE GOT A WHOLE SLAB!   And of course it was more delicious than Tuckys! I feel very ripped off from buying at Tuckys.  I will never buy there again.  Please if you go there ask them to see the portions. That you are buying.  Trust me when I say.  Save yourself some time and just go to Famous Daves!!!!"}
{"text":"I wish this place was better.  The biggest problem is that it's a BBQ restaurant and you never smell smoke when driving by (which I do a lot) or when inside, so it leaves me to question how the food is actually being prepared.  The only thing on the menu I find somewhat enjoyable are the burnt ends.  The brisket and ribs are mush.  The sides are average at best.  The service is not good.  It always takes much longer than it should when placing an order and it's never been crowded when I've been in there so it's not the crowds.  I've placed a few orders online and not once has it been smooth and have been double billed more than once with online orders.  Again, I'm rooting for this place.  It would be awesome to have great food on this side of town.  Maybe they should cut the menu down and focus on daily, fresh smoked specials each day.  It would be nice to see or smell smoke at some point!"}
{"text":"Great smoked meats, ribs, chicken, and wings.  Excellent fried okra, sweet tea, mac and cheese made from scratch and with sharp cheddar.  Service is exceptional.  GREAT JOB AND EVEN BETTER FOOD!!!"}
{"text":"I had Tucky's cater a holiday party and it was great! They worked with me on the phone in advance helping select the right portion sizes and food choices for my group. We ended up with whole smoked turkey, pulled pork, mashed potatoes, sweet potatoes, green beans, mac and cheese, and corn muffin tops. We opted to pick it up. It was ready on time, hot, and delicious. The food got raving reviews at the party. All the meat was excellent, with the pulled pork especially standing out. The sweet potatoes have a delicious crumb pecan topping and the mac n' cheese seemed to be a crowd favorite.  Their provided estimates in terms of how many people we could serve was spot on.  Definitely coming back on my own to try some of their other menu options!"}
{"text":"It is hard to see from Boulder Highway and doesn't look like much from the outside. The staff is incredible, the food is great, the place inside is very clean and a fun Gathering Spot. We will continue to go back and Order and visit the staff."}
{"text":"Truly the best BBQ and service we've had in our lives. My family and I ordered the \"5th wheel\" thanks to the kind helpful words of wisdom from Shiela (Best server ever). It comes with a full slab of ribs and 1 1/2 pounds of your choice of meat. We chose spare ribs, pulled pork, brisket, and burnt ends. I wish I could say one of them was my favorite but I can't. They were all so incredibly good that it was impossible to pick a favorite. This is where we will go for BBQ every time we are hankering for some fantastic grub!!!!!  Thanks Tucky's and Shelia for a wonderful meal!"}
{"text":"Absolute crap, I do NOT recommend. Overpriced and ridiculous portions."}
{"text":"This is excellent food. Friendly staff, great atmosphere and even better food and it's appropriately priced."}
{"text":"Warm welcome and excellent customer service! Large serving sizes so you will definitely have enough for left overs. The food is delicious! We tried the pulled pork, rib tips, Mac n cheese, potato salad & corn muffin tops. All of it is excellent but the mac n cheese is our favorite! You get to choose/self serve your own sauce. Choose between sweet/zesty, original or spicy. The dining attire really set the whole ambience of homemade & family BBQ. Happy, full customers. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Not bad bbq but does not make my top three in town. I was expecting more quality for my money"}
{"text":"Great BBQ food. Good house-made sauces. Loved the smoked potato!"}
{"text":"Went after work to pickup a family special dinner deal.... worst $30 I ever spent. The food was terrible.  It was as if the meat had been sitting around in its own grease all day uncovered, you know that hard, clearish crap at the bottom.  The brisket, pulled pork and chicken all tasted the same. The chicken was dry. The side were terrible as well. I don't know how this restaurant is still around. Backyard amatuer barbecuers, like myself can make better tasting lumps of meat, a common additive called Seasoning usually does the trick."}
{"text":"Very impressed all I can say is Wow!! Awesome customer service and amazing BBQ! We tried the sampler 4x4 perfect for the first time customer, extremely happy the cashier (young kid) suggested and and helped us by giving recommendations he was very excited and enthusiastic really made our experience a great one! Will definitely be coming back here again"}
{"text":"Meat was dry, Mac & cheese was OK, I'm from TX. So I'm very picky, won't return, plus the meat didn't have a smoked taste!!!"}
{"text":"Four stars for the food. Chopped brisket and sauces were spot on. Comparable if not better (flavor wise) than local competitors. A great relief from the garbage national chains.  Would recommend the brisket (I prefer it chopped) and Mac and cheese. Corn bread was also legit which is a staple of any establishment calling itself a \"bbq\" joint.  Sauces weren't served on the meat; they're heated next to the utensils so don't miss them.  Staff is still working on the system so be patient and support the best damn bbq on Boulder and the greater Henderson area."}
{"text":"The last stop on our bbq journy.  Tuckys is just average bbq.  Well executed, doesn't stand out to much.  Not bad, but not great."}
{"text":"If I could take stars away they would be minus 10. Food was salty beans from a can slaw... well it just wasn't worth the $50.00 plus we spent.  I really wanted to support a local business but, this was bad would not recommend to my worst enemy."}
{"text":"Crave it!! Come from across town almost every week. Just gets better and better. Brisket so good there's no need for sauce. Mac and Cheese like homemade, greens soft and tastily seasoned. Corn bread just right.  My picky family even loved everything ordered. Staff remembers you and owner present. Great mom and pop place."}
{"text":"we recently ordered the 5th wheel (chicken, brisket & ribs with side of mac & cheese, green beans and bacon, 6 pieces of bread). All of it was good. No complaints. We also ordered and paid through yelp with no issues. When we went to pick-up our order we only waited about 7 min for all our order to be ready and there was no fuss. Easiest order and pick-up I've experienced at any location"}
{"text":"I waited 45 minutes for my order. No back ribs. Only had 1/2 of pound of pull pork he said. Said he would make it up with tips he never added to my order. Then I get home and my order is incomplete and missing the pull pork and no added tips. I called and the guys says to come down because he didn't have a driver. When I get there he has two driver's gives me some pull pork in an aluminum foil that looked like someones left overs or doggy bag. But he gave me two coblers for my troubles. I even tipped this guy $5.00. got me ones shame on you. You won't get me twice. Shame on you. $75.00 dollars of bad Services."}
{"text":"Finally a good BBQ joint out here in Henderson, located on Lake Mead and Boulder in I believe the old Pizza Hut. This is the real deal BBQ, everything from their loaded mashed potatoes with burnt ends to the brisket and pulled pork, they sure know how to work that smoker. What I like about here is that the meats are not over powered by smoke, the ribs were so tender and juicy they just fell off the bone. This place is definitely worth the drive for some championship style BBQ. I will most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Tucky's was some of the best BBQ I have ever had! The smell from the smoker hits you before you even hit the door. The brisket was juicy and flavorful. The burnt ends and rib tips are perfection. Everything just melted. As for the sides, it is all personal preference. The coleslaw was vingager based. My husband loved that. The beans were sweet, which I like. Potato salad is red potatoes and it was good. The service was great. Since it was our first time they helped us make selections and told us their personal favorites.  We have not been able to stop talking about Tucky's. We have told everyone how great our experience was. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Food was fantastic!!! Would have given 5 stars but service was a bit slow... Otherwise perfect!"}
{"text":"Seeing the building made is question the choice, but this place was amazing. Service was friendly and helpful, made excellent recommendations, and was fast. The food (we had PBLT & the Pit Fries as our two meals) was delicious (juicy pork, crispy perfect fries)! Loved it!"}
{"text":"I ordered from Tucky's using Yelp's online ordering app and had no problems picking it up. I got the pulled pork, baby back ribs, and the brisket. And I got the beans, corn, and mac and cheese as sides. The meat tasted better than they looked, but since I had take out, the presentation wasn't a priority. The ribs were smoky with tender meat that slid off the bone. The beans and mac and cheese were okay, nothing too special, I wasn't impressed with how the mac and cheese looked. It looked like the cheese was curdling a little bit, probably from sitting in the take out container for awhile, again not an issue because of the take out presentation. The corn bread that it comes with was okay too, usually I expect corn bread to look and taste a certain way (I'm not a fan of corn bread btw), and this bread was no different.  Overall, there were no hiccups in using the Yelp order online app and in picking up the meal, the portions were large enough for leftovers to be eaten another time. And although there are a lot of barbecue places to choose from in Henderson, Tucky's happens to be one of the closer ones so I'll probably come back when I'm craving barbecue in the future.  It's worth checking out Tucky's for some decent barbecue, but if you have to have the best in Vegas, you might find better driving out of Henderson for it."}
{"text":"We live nearby and I'm a huge BBQ lover! My wife and I had been wanting to try this for awhile but are very busy. We finally had a chance recently and here's how it went. We ordered the \"Fifth Wheel\" which was a choice of either a rack of baby back or spare ribs, a pound and a half of meat,2 sides and 6 muffin tops. We selected a rack of baby backs,a pound and a half of brisket , and for sides,mac & cheese and slaw. The ribs were cooked perfectly! Nice smoke ring,just the right amount of tug on the bite! The problem was the ribs were so salty that they were unedible! I'm not exaggerating ! I have NEVER had any ribs this salty! I'm assuming someone made a mistake with the brine or injection and I mean they were so salty my wife could only eat 2 ribs and I ate 3!!!! I really wanted to like this local BBQ spot! I'm willing to accept it was just a bad mistake , but when you spend money on BBQ which isn't cheap anywhere,simple mistakes make or break the experience."}
{"text":"Tucky's was just an average barbecue place. The food was memorable. I got the two meat plate with brisket and pulled pork. They were both lukewarm and didn't have much flavor. The cornbread tops were dry, but I did like the mac & cheese. The service wasn't overly friendly and the place was a bit dirty. Enough to not make me to return."}
{"text":"Stopped in here on a recent Sunday morning. My friends and I had planned to go to Omelet House which is really good breakfast food but after waiting 15 minutes for eggs we changed tacks and decided on lunch. I had noticed the sign for the BBQ place as we turned into the shopping center so that was a new destination.   The service is polite and fast. I like having the two choices of extra sauce and paper towels on the picnic tables. Our table ordered pulled pork sandwiches, pulled chicken sandwiches, the brisket and sides of Mac and cheese, green beans, and baked potato. All were very fresh and tasty. The Mac and cheese I particularly liked. My friend really liked the pulled chicken. The brisket was sliced a little thick for my other friend but he flavor was good. The sandwiches were on great rolls.   Ultimately I would not say this is the best southern BBQ in the world but it was a great find in the Vegas area.  Thanks for being here!"}
{"text":"I would have to say it the best bbq I have had in town , the brisquit is amazing , potato salad is awesome , just all around good food we are regulars at tuckys .everytime we go in to eat we are welcomed as soon as we open the door . Great customer service even at 10 min to close ,"}
{"text":"I grew up in Kansas City eating barbecue from Bryant's and Gates. We recently went on a trip to Texas and drove 100 miles out of the way because we heard about a great barbecue place in another little town. The brisket at Tucky's was as good as I've had anywhere.  Overall a good meal."}
{"text":"I've been twice once for a catering order and the other for lunch, both time I had good service and the food is pretty good"}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service supplemented with food that borders on great. Really, the only bad thing I have to say is that the pork, which was really good was served differently than what I expected. I expected like a pulled pork and got something I can only describe as reminiscent of ox tail. But, still very good. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Poor greeting upon entry. Waited a couple minutes for them to finish their conversation and then was told we ll be right with you. Have you ever been scared to order because you might get yelled at?   There was only two tables sat when someone brought our order and they yelled our name. Awkward. Then the next people's order came out and they yelled our name again and brought us their food. We are talking about a 2 minute interval between orders and only 2 tables in the place. She was visually and audibly frustrated with her employee the \"mad order taker\"  On to the food. Mediocre. Cooked well but flavor was off.  Brisket was decent but the rib tips and pulled pork were to salty. Sides were okay. Unfortunately I've been to franchise BBQ that was better."}
{"text":"Good food...when they have it! I have been there 5-6 times but the last two times their cookers were down, and all they had was chicken or sausage! the time before they they had no beef. I quit going after that."}
{"text":"We stop be here for lunch from time to time. Always delicious! We get the smoked chicken & brisket combo. Their fried okra is a must try.  This Thanksgiving we ordered their Turkey Dinner! WOW!!! The turkey was incredible! And with all the side dishes we fed 6 with leftovers! Highly recommend!  Service is good!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Heard about it last night and liked it so much decided to have them cater my daughter's wedding reception.  The pulled pork sandwich is loaded with meat and their sauces are delicious! Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Great food. Terrible service. Rude people behind the counter. There are other good barbeeque spots around. Glad to see I was't the only person that felt this way."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal. The burnt ends really tender melt in your mouth good. The brisket was also great not chewy smoked perfectly.  The Andouille sausage was out standing. A bit pricey but what good smoke bbq isn't? Well worth the money, portion also good size."}
{"text":"Needs a new staff... this place could be amazing if the owner hired some staff that give a damn. I called for pick up and the girl one the phone was just blah. Kind rude... told me the food would be ready in 15-20 and I got there in exactly 15 the food was ready. When I got home the food was cold. The ribs were AMAZINGLY tender. So good. Especially if they were hot!!! The brisket was ok. Probably better hot.. the macaroni was cold so that made it suck. And potato salad was good. The corn bread was good. All in all this place could be so so so good if the staff cared to at least warm the food and smile.   P.S I have NEVER given such a negative review and work in the food industry so I am super understanding."}
{"text":"The BBQ was very good and being originally from Texas, I know BBQ. It was very good. The price was a little high, however."}
{"text":"Great BBQ, fair prices!! This place is so good though unfortunately the last time my husband and I went, we both got very sick from their food (this was all we ate all day). I am not sure if we will be back."}
{"text":"Great alternative from traditional fast food. The bbq sauces leave a little to be desired but otherwise the good it's good the staff is friendly and the experience was perfect."}
{"text":"Having a southern father-in-law that cooks brisket as an art, this place is actually pretty good, and felt a little guilty loving this place. We had the 4×4 came with back ribs, brisket, pulled pork, and andouille. Ribs and brisket are my fave (sorry pops). Pulled pork will be better as a sandwich but either way it's good. Mac&cheese and greens I liked, muffin tops were a little disappointing it's a bit dry and I like it moist but I guess that's just my personal preference.  Service was great and ambiance was good with the brick walls. We will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Really good BBQ. Easy to spend money here, but you leave satisfied which doesn't happen often eating out!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food! I stopped in for a quick bite and had brisket with a smoked spud! Delicious."}
{"text":"OMG!!! Delicious! Ono! BF wanted bbq and I yelped it... What a hit :) But the big miss? I forgot to order the dang RIBS lol, I was mesmerized by the decor on the inside.  2 meats- brisket and burnt ends  I wish I ordered more of the brisket!!!! Note to self I will with more mac n chz! sides- mac n cheese and collard greens= deliciousness!!! pulled pork sand- very flavorful the crunch with the pickles  Definitely will be back here very, very soon.  *The dude that took and prepared my order was awesome."}
{"text":"In case you don't feel like reading this entire review, I'll sum it up by saying we wished we would've just went to Wendy's. Before I continue let me state that I have roots stemming from North Carolina, Virginia, Memphis and Texas and I've lived in all of them so I KNOW what GOOD barbeque is. So my Lady and I were coming from Lake Las Vegas and spotted this place. I was a little skeptical because for it being a barbeque spot there wasn't that pungent barbeque smoke aroma lingering in the air. Usually we go to John Mull's Road Kill for barbeque, which is some of the best in the country and was features on The Food Channels \"Diners, Drive-Ins and Dive\", but decided there must be a place in Vegas that can give the Food Channel famous John Mull a run for his money... WRONG. When I first walked in there seem to be a lot of activity going on behind the counter with several workers moving around busily, which is to be expected. But the fact that no one greeted me when I walked through the door was awkward. You're pretty much just left to find your way around the menu and restaurant. They have the menu displayed on big fancy flat screen televisions, which made me think even if the customer service is terrible, the fact that they put so much effort into the menu must mean the food has to be great. I already knew what we wanted because we had previously viewed the menu online. As I looked around I found where I was to place my order at, without the help of the ten people behind the counter, but because I saw a register and assumed this is where I order. As I waited at the register to be greeted I was approached by a young woman who simply said \"what are you having?\". No hello, no good evening, no how are you doing or how may I help. Her personality was as pleasant as a funeral service. The two young girls behind the counter both looked like they weren't getting paid to work there. Once again I figured instead of putting focus on customer service and social skills they put the focus into the food. I ordered the brisket sandwich and Texas Filly which was also a brisket sandwich, online it stated the Texas Filly came with fries but she told me I would have to get the combo and if I removed the drinks it would only take off 10 cents. Some how I was conned into getting two combos, so my expected $20 meals turned into $30. I thought no problem you get what you pay for. She gave me two cups(one of them had hair in it). I looked for the drink machine only to discover it's behind the counter. I asked her am I allowed to get my drink and she nodded yes. You would think this was something she would've told me at first. I waited around ten minutes for my food and the excitement was growing for fact that I might've found another great barbeque spot! An older woman came from behind the counter to give me our food and she seemed to rather pleasant. Usually my Lady and I wait until we get home to eat but we live in Summerlin so we had about a 25-30 minute drive ahead of us and decided to eat in the car. The moment we opened our container I knew we were in for a $30 disappointment. The fries were okay the first two bites, after that all I tasted was heavy amounts of seasoning salt. By the way, who in the hell minces brisket for a sandwich?! My \"Texas Filly was nothing more than a brick of bread with minced meat and a piece of cheese on top. The website stated this sandwich was nominated for top 10 sandwiches in America, by who I ask?! Lol My lady's brisket sandwich was minced meat on a hamburger roll with pickles and shreds of cabbage which I think was supposed to be coleslaw. We literally drenched our sandwiches in barbeque sauce until we realized we didn't want them anymore and gave the rest to our dog. To add insult to injury the lemonade and sweet tea were both watered down. It's sad because Vegas is not a barbeque city so you can pass this stuff off as good barbeque and get away with it. If you want good barbeque go to Rollin' Smoke, but if you want REALLY GREAT authentic barbeque, go to John Mulls Road Kill and save yourself the disappoint of this Tucky's."}
{"text":"Loved everything. Smoked baloney, fried okra, and mac n cheese. Took me right back to my childhood. Brisket had so much flavor no sauce was needed. The potato salad was perfect. I will definitely be back. Nothing better than sitting around a picnic table sharing BBQ with friends and family."}
{"text":"This was our fist time at Tucky's and it won't be our last!  We ordered the full rack platter, and chose the rubbed spareribs, baked beans, green beans, and a corn muffin top.  We shared that and had enough left over for my grandson at home.  Service was great, and fast.  Can't wait to try some of their other foods!!!"}
{"text":"I was hungry for some BBQ.  It was time to try Tucky's in hopes for a good neighborhood place. Walking into what was once a Pizza Hut (you could tell by the building), we were greeted with friendly smiles.  Once we knew what we wanted, I placed my order and took a seat at one of the picnic benches inside.  I opted for the Loaded spud with brisket, baked beans and corn muffin tops.   The service was very friendly and quick.  Our meals were out to us in no time. On the side counter is their sauces in a warmer.  I tried all three but didn't find one with a little zing.  She forgot my beans and corn muffin tops when she brought the spud.  It wasn't a big deal and she brought them out immediately.  The baked beans were not great.  I guess I was expecting BBQ beans since we were in a BBQ joint.  A little bland so I left it.  Muffin tops weren't really what I expected according to pictures.  Almost like a round slice of cornbread. I did however like the loaded spud - brisket inside of the potato with cheese melted on top and sour cream on the side.  The meat was tender and really complimented all of the combined flavors.  I would order this again.  It was indeed a good place and wouldn't mind stopping back to try a different menu item.  I just hope they will change the corn muffin tops back to what some of the pictures appeared to be."}
{"text":"Another stellar order tonight guys!! We've eaten here about 4 or 5 times, and have ordered a cook at home roast, and it's all truly so amazing. The last take home order was not the best, but tonight's totally made up for it!! Ribs were falling off the bone once again, brisket was tender, and a great amount of chicken. Seriously, go get some Tucky's! And call ahead. They run out of different things sometimes. When it's gone for the day it's gone! One thing though Tucky's staff, please: don't forget the sauce with the home deliveries!"}
{"text":"$35 for my wife and I. It took a very long time to get our food. Lots of people behind the counter doing nothing. The sliced brisket taste like it was cooked in the oven, not a smoker. It was about 50% fat. My mac and cheese had no taste and was not even warm, polish sausage was cold. My wife had a stuffed potato with pork which was cold as well."}
{"text":"Ribs, pulled pork, and brisket combo was our go-to to order from here.  Our visits though have become less these past couple of months.  With meals being luke warm, ribs being dry, latest the brisket tasting a little too salty. 70% of it ended up being tossed on \"clear out the fridge night\". That rarely happens. Mr B noted the staff hasn't been the same ones we use to see, even pitmaster has been MIA the times we stopped by. When these guys are there BBQ was great! Glad they do offer more menu items, so gonna switch it up go for pulled pork items for now."}
{"text":"I usually get a sampler to try everything but they had a special beef rib plate. It was great and I have a BBQ catering business. I am also a certified KCBS master judge. I am going back to try it all. No complaints in this meal and the sauce is on the side, 3 types so you can taste the meat. Had a chance to speak with the pitmaster and GM. Real nice people. I would recommend giving them a try. They were kind enough to give me a sample of  their potato skin, yummmy.Also great music inside :) Las Vegas has some serious BBQ in town"}
{"text":"We ordered the rib tips and Burnt ends Brisket and the meat melts in your mouth! One of the most tender and soft bbq I've ever eaten.  The flavor is on point and the side orders of Fried Okra, Coleslaw and Potato salad are all very delicious and flavorful.  They have an array of dishes to choose from that fits for one person to a party of 5 or more.  Customer service could be better, though.  Will come back to this place again."}
{"text":"The meat....spectacular.  I had the pulled pork and the brisket.  While the brisket was slightly salty to me I'm sure it is normal for folks who use salt(i never really do).  The sauce was just the right amount of heat, if not a little a little runny. The sides however were very lackluster. The mac and cheese was sub par and the baked beans were plain.  The corn bread was dry. The pickles were nice however, light, crisp, and not overwhelming.   I'd come back but probably just for meat."}
{"text":"diarrhea and food poisoning.  they do get a star for good service and that the pulled pork sandwich that provided the diarrhea and food poisoning tasted good, but... never again."}
{"text":"It's about time Henderson got a BBQ place that is authentic and almost tastes like you are from back in TX/OK. Love Tuckys. My family does as well. They are a little pricey but well worth it."}
{"text":"Best pulled pork EVER!  Super helpful staff and chef Tony came out to chat about my food allergies and offer recommendations."}
{"text":"A lot of effort was put into making Tucky's a great, family-oriented spot! The decor is homey Western with kitchen tables, and it feels like a place that has been there for decades. The condiment area features three sauces, kept in warmers for diners and available for purchase by the pint. Add in the warm service, and I had high hopes that I'd found a new favorite barbecue joint. Unfortunately, that doesn't seem to quite be the case.  My guy and I got a two-meat platter to share, advertised as 2/3lb meat with two sides, plus corn bread- we got the \"no pig\" combo of brisket and smoked chicken with macaroni and beans. I was truly surprised to prefer the dishes I typically like least, the chicken (which was seasoned and sauced to the point that it initially appeared burned) and beans (which were seasoned with bits of brisket). As a Texan, I have high brisket expectations and the sliced version was very lean and cut thinner than I'd prefer. It didn't have a smoke ring or much seasoning and seemed like a small portion. The macaroni side seemed to be a baked version and the cheese itself was clumpy rather than saucy.   Maybe my dislikes are due to mere preference, but the portions were also on a bit smaller than I'd anticipated- a fellow diner's Pit Fries was incongruous with the $10+ price. I found the sauces to be solid, and wouldn't mind trying this place again. Perhaps the specific things I tried just aren't their best. Would love to see this place succeed."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat in Henderson no doubt. I'm not big on going out myself but this lil spot is so good I'm always down to show ppl this killer place, and everyone I take say they love it too, so give it a shot if you would like a real BBQ house."}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place after dog sitting in the area. This place is in BFE aka Hendertucky. It's a good 25 miles from my house in Summerlin, so I knew I had to try it when I was close by.  My boyfriend, myself, and a friend of ours stopped in around 7pm, and the owner greeted us cheerily. FYI they do close at 8. The menu is awkwardly placed on a low wall, so we stood around for some time trying to read it before the owner told us there were menus on each table. We sat down and he came around the counter and sat with us. He asked us what we liked, and gave us his recommendations. I thought that was super cool.  Boyfriend ordered a full rack of baby back ribs, with mac and cheese and beans as his sides. Our friend ordered the St. Louis spare ribs, with potato salad and mac and cheese as his sides. I went with the 2 meat platter, and chose pulled pork and burnt ends, and mac and cheese and slaw as my sides. All the meals came with a cornbread muffin and butter. Also note the meals do not come with drinks.   *Things I loved* 1.The pulled pork was outstanding. I loved the smoky flavor, and the pork was really juicy.  2.Coleslaw was on point. It's vinegar based and it packs a tangy, yet flavorful punch. I would get this over and over again. 3.Housemade bbq sauces in warmers, the sweet and sassy was my fav  4. Friendly service  *Just Ok* 1. The beans tasted canned. We all agreed that we would skip these next time.  2. The burnt ends were tasty, but I prefer my ends to be more burnt and crispy.   So after we ate, (we had plenty of leftovers) and it was just about closing time, one of our other friends called to see if we could get him something to go. I guess he got jealous from all the pictures we sent him of the delicious food. So we ask if we can get a togo order and of course they said yes. I thought that was really the icing on the cake of great customer service. When I am in Hendertucky next time and craving bbq, I will for sure be back."}
{"text":"Food was really good I thought however, employees need to care about customers more. I was in there on St. Patricks day with my family for lunch. I ordered my food went to my table and went to sit down as I was holding my 2 year old daughter when the chair broke and we fell on the ground. Thankfully my daughter and I were completely fine just embarrassed. My husband took the chair to the front and told the employees that I fell holding my daughter due to the chair breaking and none of them cared or even asked if I was ok. All the other customers who witnessed me fall asked if I was ok but none of the employees seemed to care if I was ok or not. I think they need to pay more attention they could have had a law suit on their hands."}
{"text":"Been here twice. Had the \"one meat\" with 1/2 lb of brisket, 2 sides, corn bread and butter. Brisket is very tender and excellent flavor, best I've ever had. Lots of food comes with this order. They have refill yourself soft drinks, plenty of huge picnic tables and some tables with paper towels on each.  Mac and cheese and potato salad are very good choices. Order at the counter and they bring it out to you."}
{"text":"The Meat was 5 stars! I would go back for that!  The sides were not flavorful. Bland Mac & Cheese, and cornbread.   I didn't think the cashier girl was very nice. The young guys in the back were very friendly.   I really wanted this to be my new spot, since I am new to Henderson."}
{"text":"This was our first time eating at Tucky's and we were a little skeptical based on some of the reviews.  Overall the food was really good. We tried the Brisket, the chicken, rib tips, and beef and each of them was delicious and they weren't dry.  We will definitely be back and would recommend trying this spot!"}
{"text":"Food was tasty but service was so slow! BBQ and sides are pre-made they  had 5 employees but every order took 15 minutes and when our 15 minutes was up they only brought my husbands food my baked potato took another several minutes!, and when it came for $10.95 it was small and barely had any meat or cheese on it, for which they charge about $5 extra over a regular baked potato. Again the flavor was good but for $17.95 the amount of brisket and sausage was very paultey! I would not return based on service and value."}
{"text":"If the delivery truck flipped in the interstate, I'd eat my meal right off the pavement, in traffic. It's that good. The burnt ends are amazing. The hamburger is made of God cows."}
{"text":"1st time visitor to this restaurant. There were about 4-5 cars in the parking lot. The menu was pretty standard for BBQ.  My GF and I had the BBQ for 2 platter. It came with a choice of 3 meats, 3 sides and 2 corn muffins. We chose burnt ends, chopped brisket and ribs (2 bones). For sides....Cole slaw, beans, and Mac and Cheese. Total of $29 with 2 drinks (self serve).  Sides: I'm not a fan of vinegar based Cole Slaw. It was OK, I don't think I'd get it again. Beans were fair too. Not too much BBQ flavor in there. More of cowboy beans. The Mac and Cheese was realllly good. I'd get it again. The lady serving us mentioned they had collard greens available that weren't on the menu. I'm not sure if that's a regular item or not.   Meats: The Star of the show!!! Burnt ends, brisket and ribs cooked to perfection. A smoky taste to all of it that wasn't overpowering at all. They have sauces available, but I didn't need any for the meat, I only added some to the beans.   I'll go back. Probably just to get some meats to go and make my own sides at home.   Well done Tuckys BBQ!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm not a huge bar bq connoisseur but I've had a few places to compare with. I would say this place is average. Was hoping to find a hidden gem but wasn't really anything out of the ordinary. The platter was huge with lots of sides but the meat was kind of dry. Yes, I know that's what bar bq sauce is for but I do like when the meat is already kind of moist. I mean, that's what these meals were invented from but we are not in times when it's an eat to survive only type of living. As I mentioned, I want to find something special but was kind of let down when it was just very average. The portions were good size and I couldn't even finish which is rare because I hardly ever let food go to waste but I just couldn't finish. Corn bread with two sides which I opted for macaroni and baked beans. I read somewhere that the macaroni was amazing but found it to be just different texture, nothing really different in flavor. The lady who seemed to be the owner or in the family was friendly but at the same time she was just a little overbearing for my taste. I was the only customer when I arrived. It was like she was being pressured to make a good impression. I understood this so I suggested that maybe if they had an eating contest as a menu item that they could advertise and bring more customers in but they kind of cut me off while I was mentioning it and when I finally got it out, they just looked at me like I was crazy. I could see this place getting better if it was busier but the location added the area was tough. Like I said, if they had something to draw people in it could be a real gem with the added attention to hone off those little problems which usually results from becoming busier. But, until then, 20 bucks for a platter will have to wait. ( this was also another indication that they were struggling. Owners tend to freak out and drive prices up instead of spending on advertising which will make costs irrelevant when there's a higher customer turnover )"}
{"text":"This little place has been here almost a year apparently. I tried it for the first time with a co-worker when we were just looking for any where to sit, eat, and decompress after a rough morning. We were pleasantly surprised. First the staff we all very friendly. A couple younger ones that were a bit goofy, but in a good way - nice, funny, and enjoying working together like teens should. The food was excellent. I had the Texas Philly which is like a Philly sandwich, but with brisket. Also a side of fried okra. Yum. And my friend had brisket, kielbasa sausage, with collards and green beans. The collards were some of the best I've had. We'll be back and hopefully so will others."}
{"text":"Cool little environment , it's got everything you need. Everything was great, but they need work on their cornbread or if they could serve regular bread that'd fine as well. Other than that 4 stars potentially 5."}
{"text":"Decent place for meat. The brisket was excellent. Pulled chicken and pork also very good. Dry rub ribs fell right off the bone. Sides were not good. corn bread was super dry and the mac and cheese tasted like it came right out of a bag. The portions were very small compared to a lot of BBQ places around town and the prices are pretty high for the amount you get. Probably just stick to my normal BBQ spots unless I'm craving expensive good brisket."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice and enjoyed it both times. I had the pulled chicken plate the first time with Mac & cheese and green beans, it was awesome. The next time I had The Original Texas Filly- when they brought it out the brisket was so over cooked that it was literally the consistency of beef jerky! But- as much as I hate to do this, I brought it to the counter and let them know. They made me a fresh sandwich with freshly cooked brisket and it was awesome! The mash potatoes are great and I love they BBQ sauces. It's small and homey here, kind of a no frills place but better than a hole in the wall type of establishment. I will keep this at the top of my list for places to grab a quick bite!"}
{"text":"Great barbecue selection had the Brisket and Pulled Pork both were very good. Great sauces that finish off the meat."}
{"text":"Best bbq i have ever had:)  mac n cheese, brisket and corn muffins are all outrageously tasty!!"}
{"text":"VERY happy to have found some REAL barbecue in this town.  Been missing the stuff since I left Kansas City almost 4 years ago.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"The owner and son are very nice and hands on. Very clean restaurant and great service.  We ordered the carload which came with 1/2 rack of ribs, 1 1/2 lbs of meat, 2 sides, 4 corn muffin tops, pickles and sauce for $47.95 which feeds 3-4.  We chose the back ribs, brisket, burnt ends, Mac and cheese, mashed potatoes w/gravy, and small collard green.  The ribs were fall off the bone delicious, paired with the sweet and zesty sauce. Burnt ends were tender and tasty. But the brisket, AMAZING! I'm talking cut it with a plastic fork tender.  This place is definitely a gem! I give them two thumbs up."}
{"text":"Not bad. Ribs were great, chicken was good and pulled pork was not bad. The sides were a little average. Mac n cheese was ok, but other sides lacked seasoning. Still pretty decent meal.   Small place and service was polite and accommodating.   We will most likely go back but I'm in no rush."}
{"text":"I had the St. Louis Spareribs that were dry rubbed with their secret blend and they were perfect. I didn't have to add any bbq sauce. The cornbread was delicious and the beans were delicious. My husband had the B.E. Sammie which is brisket burnt ends on a toasted roll and he loved it. I can't wait to go back to Tucky's. If they deliver to Lake Mead, I will definitely have them cater my parties on my houseboat. My only regret was not knowing about them prior. We drive from California on the weekends. Thanks to the kind and friendly staff; they know their bbq."}
{"text":"Great BBQ!  Andouille sausage, tri-tip (when they have it) and brisket are fabulous. Everything is good and the staff are friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Smokin' is right!!  GREEEEAAT Barbeque!!   Henderson needed a new good place, located in the old Pizza Hut building on Boulder Hwy...great food, reasonable prices and service was quick.   Very casual place with picnic benches as the tables, really cute.  We had Brisket and Pulled pork with all the fixins', cant say a bad word about it -  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I Absolutely Love Tuckys BBQ. Tried Dickey\"s, Big B's Texas BBQ and Lucilles to name a few and none of them come even close to Tuckys. Their Burnt Ends are so divine. You can't stop eating them. So moist and flavorful. Mac n cheese is some down south home cookin Mac n cheese. Cole slaw is different and so Awesome. Got a bit of spice and pickling to it. Such a nice twist. Corn muffin tops are THE BEST!!!! Their 3 different sauces are an aphrodisiac to the meat. Had the ribs and pulled pork as well  and they are amazing too. My women had the green beans and devoured them. U have got to go to Tucky's. Your taste buds and tummy will thank you. Every time I go in i get meat drunk. Keep it up!!!!!"}
{"text":"Brisket is tasty, though very fatty. Side dishes are unusual. Cole slaw does not taste at all like coke slaw. Baked beans taste like out of a can. Won't go back."}
{"text":"The brisket burnt ends were very good. It had a good BBQ atmosphere and was very clean. The rib tips were OK, mac was not memorable and baked beans taste like they are basically poured out of a can and heated up. The cornbread although very tasty was very dry. Overall decent. I would give them another shot...."}
{"text":"Solid BBQ spot in Old Henderson.  Meats and sides are good.  We've tried the brisket, ribs, rib tips and links.  Our experience is they tend to run out of meats, so have a backup in mind.  We usually share a combo.  It is enough for 2 but the portions do seem smaller than other spots.  Both times we went they give us inaccurate wait times.  Like way off.  To the point I left hubby there to wait, went to pick up the kids and came back, food still wasn't ready.  Not the place to go if you have any sort of time constraint.  Service is very friendly.  I like mom & pop spots and wish them luck."}
{"text":"Mixed thoughts on this BBQ. As mentioned by a few brothers yelpers, I too am a tough judge of BBQ. Lifetime in Texas, along with travels thru S. Carolina & Kansas I'm lucky to have had some of the best BBQ in the country. Cooper's pork chops like you've never tasted & best burnt ends in the world (Llano TX), Sonny Bryans sliced brisket sandwich with onion rings, Mishacks hot links (both Dallas TX) are my top 3.   So....having said that, sides & corn bread were good. To go was packaged well & condiments, napkins, etc. included. Brisket & rib tips not bad. These items 3 1/2.   But.... if you use the word \"burnt\" in the description of the meat, there is a requirement that it be somewhat burnt. There is no such thing as fatty burnt ends. The fat is gone from being charred. The fat creates the burnIng. Tucky's burnt ends were half fat. The meat part was tasty but they weren't truly burnt ends.  I will try them again, definitely worthy of a repeat. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Ribs and pulled pork - Fabulous! Very juicy and full of good meat flavor. The seasonings don't overpower the food but properly enhance the essence of the pork.  We found the sides didn't live up to the meats, but they had only been open three days. I'm giving them another shot for sure. At the least, getting ribs by the rack and pulled pork by the pound is a great meal starter."}
{"text":"The place has an old family restaurant look from the outside, and the inside tables they've gone with the out side picnic tables to keep with the whole BBQ experience, so don't be to alarmed by this. Now the food...OMG! It is very tasty! They've got the BBQ at home experience and taste down!!! It is seriously great food! I had the single plate of meat (burnt ends) with the two sides, Delicious!! We are for sure gonna be back!  B- for decor A+ on the food"}
{"text":"looking for a new place on a Friday night.  Being new to this side of the valley I had NO IDEA what was good and what was not.  I am so glad we found Tucky's!  It had good review on yelp, was close by and NOT a chain.  My friend and I headed out on an adventure - and we were NOT disappointed!  Scurrying to make it before 8 PM (really????) closing,  Platter for 2  - Brisket, Pulled Pork (last serving) and Burnt Ends.  Slaw, mac n cheese and greenbeans & bacon rounded out the dish.  Deliciousness!  A bar of sauces rounded out the meal. I will say the sweet bbq sauce was too molasses-y for me - combining the original and spicy made a perfect sauce for my taste buds.  The Burnt Ends were NOT burnt but oh so delicious - pork moist and flavorful.  Brisket - meh it was brisket.  The sauce made it really good.  Mac n Cheese so cheesy I couldnt finish the \"small\" side. Slaw was perfection - vinegary and cabbage pieces not too small . Absolutely will be back for to try other dishes.  Oh, the bus boy told us he's only been there 2 days - he was awesome, too!"}
{"text":"It was great BBQ with good sides but portion where small for a 2 people not sure it was because  we took it Togo"}
{"text":"I just stopped by there to get a to go.  We love barbeque and are always looking for a new great place.  I ordered four spareribs and a brisket platter.  Everything was amazing!  The ribs were fall off the bone, tender and delicious.  The brisket was melt in your mouth awesome.  Oh, and we ordered the apple cobbler and it was great too!  What a great first experience.  We just went to another barbeque place that was voted \"Best in Vegas,\" and this place was better hands down.  The service was great too, they were all kind and helpful with smiles on their faces.  Please give this place a try, you will be happy!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Best barbecue I have found in Henderson and Las Vegas.  Love love love the burnt ends!  The slaw is a vinegar base and is tangy.  The other sides I have had are the fried okra and green beans. The okra was really good and crispy. The green beans were home style. I have had the brisket and sausage as well and both are very good. But i love the burnt ends. The people that work here are always so friendly and genuine. The atmosphere is very family oriented and comfortable.   I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Love this place. The food is delicious!! People are very friendly. We had a little bit of everything. The mac n cheese is pretty good. I'm always a little skeptical cause I have very high standards when it comes to Mac n cheese. It was pretty good. All the sides were delicious! Bbq sauce is amazing its kept warm which is a nice. My son loved the Brisket sandwich. I enjoyed the smoked chicken with was delicious as well. I have heard great things about there fruit cobblers. We actually got to enjoy all three flavors. Peach, Apple and Cherry they were all delicious! We will definitely be back again!!"}
{"text":"This place is so amazing. The brisket is to die for. So much good food. And the staff is way friendly. We love going here."}
{"text":"We waited in line for 20 minutes and was not told by the cashier that they were out of almost everything until we got up to order. (She obviously was miserable and hated her job and took it out on the customers.) It would have been nice to be told this beforehand so we wouldn't have to wait in line for 20 minutes, so  unprofessional. The 1st time we went there we ate there and if 2 people sat on one side of the bench on 1 of their tables the table collapses we almost fell and ate sh*t. The ribs were mediocre and bland, we tried both the dry rubbed ones and the sauce covered ones. YOU'VE BEEN WARNED!"}
{"text":"Simple, humble, family owned place in Henderson. It was an easy access and had plenty of parking. BBQs are awesome! I like it, soft moist and delicious. Sauces are home made recipes. We have the BBQ42 for 3person. It was a perfect serving for us.   Service is friendly and efficient. I highly recommend the place. It's always nice to support our local joints they are one of them!"}
{"text":"Really friendly countergirl and staff. I wanted the no pig but they were out of beef. I got chicken and sausage with greens and baked beans. The greens were so good you may want to get 2 as both your sides. The baked beans were really good with a unique flavor. The chicken was killer and the sausage just ok. The unsweet tea was weak. I liked the snappy BBQ sauce"}
{"text":"In one word- AMAZING!  Like so, so, so freaking good!  Blows Memphis B-B-Que and Famous Dave's out of the water!  Came here with my sisters, mom and nieces on a Saturday night. We were greeted right away by some very friendly and helpful employees. After sitting down and looking over the menu the cashier came over and gave us some info on the specials and answered our questions.   The food...the star of the show!  I got the 2 meat platter with pulled pork and burnt ends. For my sides I chose mac and cheese and fried pickles. It comes with a big cornbread muffin with butter. I can't describe how good it was. No words will do it justice. The pulled pork was moist and juicy, not dry at all. The burnt ends were perfect with not too much fat. The mac and cheese was the best I've ever had. Ever. Anywhere. Ever. Cheesy and buttery and soft and warm. Fried pickles were out of this world with a slightly spicy ranch dipping sauce. Cornbread is your run of the mill cornbread muffin but after buttering it up it was awesome (butter makes everything better!) The portions are massive-I couldn't finish it all myself by a long shot.   The restaurant itself is clean and roomy, with large picnic tables and a few round tables. It looks more like a huge dining room than a restaurant and it makes it more homey feeling. There's a serve yourself area that has 3 different types of b-b-que sauce, hot sauce, honey and other sauces and condiments.   The prices aren't super cheap-I paid around $20 for my meal and a drink but you really get what you pay for. My meal was so big I could have easily shared it with someone. The quality of the food is worth the price, in my opinion.   There was only 1 or 2 other parties here but by the time we left they were filled up. I'm hoping this place stays in business and have told all my friends, family, co-workers, EVERYONE about it! Check it out- you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Walked in, walked out. $7 bologna sandwich with no sides is their advertised $6 lunch. (All others $8+ and No one else was in there for lunch at 12- all I need to know. )"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised with Tucky's. I went in with no expectations other than reading a few Yelp reviews. I left full and happy. Actually, my FIRST Tucky's experience was a day old leftovers, and it was great. So I had to come try the real thing in person, especially that it's in Henderson!  I had the ribs and mac & cheese when I tried it at home so I wanted to try something else. I went with the polish sausage, sliced brisket, baked beans, and coleslaw. The beans were my favorite, and I also enjoyed the vinegar based slaw. The brisket was melt in your mouth great. It paired perfectly with the spicy bbq sauce. The only thing I didn't like was the sweet tea. I prefer real sugar, and it tasted like an artificial sweetener. The service was good. The prices were a little high, but I don't mind supporting a mom and pop place if the food is worth it.  Also, I have to point out I really enjoyed the polish. If you are in the area, I highly recommend making a stop at Tucky's, you won't leave hungry, or disappointed!"}
{"text":"Is very rare I give a place 5 stars. Whether the food is phenomenal, or the service, or the cleanliness and atmosphere of the place, there's usually something that's off. Not the case here at Tucky's BBQ. Great atmosphere, very clean, service with a smile, and some of the best barbecue I've had in my 10 years here in Vegas. If you come for anything, come for the St Louis style dry rub ribs. This is like meat crack. The most tender meatiest juiciest ribs I've had probably in my lifetime. We ordered four different Meats to include BBQ chicken, burnt ends, pulled pork, and sliced brisket. Everything was very good but the ribs really really took first place. To the owner of Tucky's ribs, you should be very proud of your business. We will definitely return to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"Best bbq I have had in a very long time. Staff was super friendly. Made ya feel like you were eating at home."}
{"text":"The guy running the kitchen might be the coolest guy I've met! The line staff is fast, friendly and polite. And do you want to have some of the best brisket or ribs you've had in your life??? THEN GET DOWN TO TUCKYS!!!!!! The slaw, ribs, Mac and burnt ends will make you want to punch your mother. Super easy to get to off boulder highway and I've never waited longer than a few minutes for my food.    TUCKYS RULZ!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great service, friendly attitudes, tasty food and sweet tea with just the right amount of diabetes! I'll be going back again."}
{"text":"Perfect \"hole-in-the-Wall\" BBQ!   Small, no-frills restaurant. Having said that, it's clean and well-maintained.   The food was fall off the bone tender and the sauces offer are some of the best I've ever tasted. Food was served quickly and with a smile."}
{"text":"Good place. No waiters or waitresses so no sit down ordering. Pork ribs were fall off bone good. I'm more of a beef rib person tho. Burnt ends and brisket were good but not great. Green beans were awesome. Corn read was dry and much to be desired. Prefer other places but if you like pork ribs it's top."}
{"text":"Let me fist start with...I really wanted to like this place but....the staff was so friendly and the service was really fast. However the  food wasn't all that great. My husband who is normally not a picky eater or one to turn down food ended up throwing most of it away. We really enjoyed the meat (mostly just the brisket) and the cherry cobbler. The green beans literally had no flavor at all, the macaroni and cheese was ehhhhh...edible I guess, and the cornbread was just awful. Probably won't be returning unless we stop for a slice of pie!"}
{"text":"Yup 5 big smackers for Hendertucky's new prized pig Tucky's. It was finger lickin delicious no doubt!  First off if you are an uptight food snob and take yourself too seriously please don't come here. They are brand new so they are still working on the flow of things. Also if you've been to any popular BBQ place across the country you know you have to come and get it before it sells out. They are bbqing the brisket slow and low for 18 hours and it's so popular it does run out along with the ribs! Get there early! You have been warned son!  They make the BBQ sauce in house and keep it in warmers. What a concept? It's sooooo good and soooo smooth. Original is sweet, yet balanced and Zesty has hints of pepper. My two friends and I devoured the 4x4 ($24.94) which is four meats and I think three sides. We all agreed the pulled pork was where the party was at as well as the spare ribs! We looked like the wild pigs from Hannibal getting down on this food. Yes, it was that good. Other highlights for me were the Mac n cheese and the sweet cornbread muffin. I asked about the cobbler and they said they haven't perfected the recipe yet so they are not serving it. I like that answer.   Overall really good people serving really good food. I can't wait to go back fifty more times!"}
{"text":"fries were amazing!!! macaroni and cheese  was disgusting. they were just a big blob had no flavor to it just tasted like old noodles that have been cooking for days. the chicken was ok ribs good. tri-tip was delicious along with the brisket. the corn bread was dry. I won't be coming here again. the smell of the place just gave me a headache."}
{"text":"Yall need to drop in.  Great brisket, ribs, pulled pork, simple and delicious sides.  Cant believe i never dropped in before.  Perfect place to drop and have amazing grub with family and friends."}
{"text":"Co-worker told me about this place.  My husband loves barbecue, so we decided to give Tucky's a try.  Delicious food - especially the mac and cheese.  It's super cheesy & practically swimming in the oil from the cheese (that's how you know it's good)!  Food is great & so is the service!"}
{"text":"First two times awesome.  Third time yuk!   For almost $40  I expect a meal I can eat.  We asked for sliced brisket but got chopped.  The two hot sides were cold. The corn muffins cold.   The burnt ends were were salty and cold.  They finally delivered the sliced brisket and it was over salted.  I'm so sad.  I thought we had finally found a quality bbq place."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about Tucky's BBQ. I've only had them once, but I love BBQ. Tucky's does BBQ alright. The building, the design inside, the scent of smoked meat... It seems like you're about to get the best BBQ you've had since forever. And then I noticed how little ribs was in my to go box.  Tucky's advertises a 4×4 combo for $34 or $35 bucks. My co worker Julie and I were like, \"Hell yea\"! 4 meats, 4 sides. Some cornbread muffins. I ordered ribs. I got 2 baby back ribs. I ordered links. I got 1.5 links. I ordered brisket. Half of it was fat. And the pulled pork was ehhh... The mac and cheese wasnt horrible, it was ok. And I've had better BBQ beans from a can. Thank God its nearly impossible to ruin fries!  Long story short, I was disappointed. Not because of the taste, but rather the lack of ribs and links received. Opening the 4×4 to see 2 baby back ribs and 1.5 links pissed us off. I didn't expect a half rack, but I expected 2 more baby backs. Stingy asses couldnt even give us 2 links.... As a Vegas native, I was excited to try Tucky's. Tucky's is short for Hendertucky. And now that I think of it, Hendertucky's never been too fond of me. And vice versa. Oh well."}
{"text":"My wife and I have stopped here a couple time after moving recently. We have tried the loaded spuds (Brisket) , Salads, Burnt Ends and brisket sand-which with potato salad. The service is excellent and restaurant very clean from my experience. We really like the food I am a big fan of the brisket  and will definitely keep coming back and trying new items!!"}
{"text":"Have driven by this place several times and always wanted to try it since I love BBQ. Finally stopped and wow, were we glad. It was lunch so I had the pulled pork sandwich (piled high, tender smokey meat, buttered toasted bun that was the best bun I've ever had in a bbq place). I ordered the slaw on the side. (Slaw was just \"okay.\") Hubby had the brisket platter. Generous slices of tender, juicy brisket. Out of this world. Good fries, beans and a corn muffin. The only negative I would mention is that it took quite a while to get our food, which is not usually the case in a place where everything is already cooked and just needs to be assembled. The owner came over to check on us and let us know he appreciated us being there. That was a nice touch. Oh, also they have GREAT home brewed iced tea, which is something that is getting harder and harder to find."}
{"text":"Tried this new barbecue spot it was super yummy I was on the other side of town decided to use my Yelp to find a new place to eat and I found this barbecue spot with super delicious BBQ service was great the only thing I didn't really care for was the corn bread other than that the okra was bomb"}
{"text":"I have been to Tucky's all summer and took my best friend there last night....We heard the cook come from out of the back saying not enough of something...and the girl who took our order say \"They all ready paid\"...we got our food and it was a very small portion (we ordered two meats)...This was not the size of what I was use to getting.  My friend had to stop and get some more food from somewhere else to feed her family...Check your food before you leave...you know what you should get....we didn 't get it last night..."}
{"text":"Took the family to Tucky's BBQ after running errands and decided we wanted some good barbeque. We saw Tucky's had opened and wanted to give them a try. WOW so glad we did!!! My son had the ribs, I had the chopped brisket sandwich, and hubby had the pulled pork sandwich. Also had some apple cobbler desert thing. The food was so delicious! We picked up our dinner to go, and when we got to eating our food at home we were so thrilled and so delighted to know we now had great bbq here in Henderson. This place seems to be family owned. Sure hope they are successful and are around for a good while! We will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"I stopped in for a carry out order today, and I was not disappointed! I got the 4x4 which was 4 kinds of meat, 4 sides, and 2 cornbread tops. All of the meat I ordered (pulled pork, double backribs, & andouille sausage) and was delicious! The cornbread tops were excellent too! It wasn't the best mac and cheese I've ever had (but I am a mac and cheese fanatic) but it was still very good, so much so I'd double up on it next time.  The green beans with bacon were also good, and while I'm not a fan of fried okra, my husband said it was even good cold. Service was quick too! My only issue was the self serve sauce, which I only realized because I sat down to wait. If I had just walked in to pick up the order, I wouldn't have known it wasn't included in the bag. Their sweet and sassy (or something like that) was good, and I only tasted the hot version (which had a smoky heat at the end of it). I'd also say the 4x4 feeds 3 heartily."}
{"text":"This place is 5 star and it is not easy getting a 5 from me.  Burnt ends are best.  Pulled pork is close followed by andouille sausage.  All homemade including desert."}
{"text":"Three stars cause the food and service was AMAZING! Not a full 5 cause sitting in here and looking around I finally get that country feel - but the techno/upbeat music.. Is the ONLY reason it's not a full 5. Highly recommend this place if y'all want good food and friendly people!"}
{"text":"Wow Rule number one in barbecue is to remove the membrane on the bottom of ribs!!!! I have no idea what type of food they gave us but it was NOT BBQ.  We had the que for 2 with burnt ends and back ribs.  The burnt ends had no char to it and was all fat.  I asked if this was a mistake and he said he would get us a new order.  Still no char but at least there was a little over cooked meat that taste like a dry pot roast.  Ribs were so over cooked it wasn't even funny.  I didn't see a smoker anywhere or smell that wonderful BBQ smoke smell that u get from authentic bbq places.  Slaw just as bad with an over baring taste of red peppers not slaw.  On a positive note and the reason they got one star is the fountain soda was good.  Picked up Panda Express on the way home as we couldn't stomach anything we had.  Real disappointment"}
{"text":"We ordered for our Halloween party over a week in advance. Food was delivered on time however we got no BBQ Sauce and one cup of gravy to feed 40 people. My parents went to the location and was told they were out of gravy. They were given BBQ SAUCE AND A SORRY. ONLY reason they get a star is the food is amazing."}
{"text":"My family and I had lunch today and really enjoyed our meal! We had the loaded BBQ potato (really good), pulled pork sandwich, and the two meat combo. Our group loved the baked beans and potato salad! They didn't care for the slaw. For dessert we tried the bread pudding and apple cobbler! Yum! Their BBQ sauce was great. Enjoyed the food and service!"}
{"text":"Delicious only their web site menu is much more inexpensive then their real prices. Bait and switch"}
{"text":"Wow...wow wow wow (again..in the words of Mr. Ramsay.) Really great bbq guys. We were super impressed with this spot. The service was awesome and quick and the meats were authentically bbq and slow cooked as bbq should be. Sides tasted homemade and authentic as well. I know...I used authentic twice but this place deserves that word!!! Bomb a$$ bbq!! Looking forward to catering this for the family get together in the future."}
{"text":"What a disappointment. We arrived at 7:45 and when we entered the place, the gal behind the counter, was organizing stuff and said she would be with us.  We were the only ones standing there and about 5 minutes later, she asked if she could help us.  They were out of spuds and pulled pork.  We placed our order and said we would be eating there, and she informed us that they close in 15 minutes.  We chose to leave as we felt unwanted here."}
{"text":"This place has got it down! So far we've tried the following (and EACH has been FANTASTIC): Rib tips, brisket, pulled pork, pulled chicken, burnt ends.   The rib tips and burnt ends were succulent, perfectly charred, expertly sauced and full of flavor without being too fatty. The brisket had a fantastic bark and goes GREAT with their \"Snappy\" homemade BBQ sauce. The pulled pork was surprisingly and nicely peppery and pairs well with their \"Sweet & Zesty\" sauce. Finally, their pulled smoked chicken was juicy and smothered in their signature sauce (DO NOT MISS THEIR CHICKEN!).  Of their sides, my favorites were the fried okra (crispy pillows of yum), their potato salad (after the first bite, I had to take a breath and moan with pleasure) and their green beans (fresh, smoky and hearty). My husband really liked their collard greens (smoked, with a hint of apple cider vinegar) and baked beans (bits of andouille sausage, onion and bacon). We weren't thrilled with their mac & cheese (it tasted kinda velveeta-y).  Their meals are more than enough to eat: you WILL have leftovers, and are cheap (considering the amount of food you'll get)! They also have meat by-the-pound, so you can swing by after work and pick up your main protein for din-din. They're open until 8PM, every day.  Inside is adorable (cozy, clean, cute and good for small parties or larger groups). The staff is FRIENDLY and super-knowledgeable about ingredients, how everything is prepared/cooked, and dietary restrictions/recommendations. They were a young crew of good peeps!  We will definitely be returning OFTEN... I'm curious about their loaded baked potatoes and homemade smoked bologna.  Good eats, yelpers! Get in here!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in today for some lunch.  They have 3 different types of iced tea and 3 types of bbq sauce.  My friend had the brisket philly steak and he said it was very good.  I enjoyed the burnt rib tips.  They actually could have been burnt a little more for me but it was good.  I added 2 of their homemade BBQ sauces to it.  The collard greens had little pieces of bacon and was just as good as their macncheese.  The only reason I gave 4stars is that the company apparently only has wifi that can be used by 5 people at one time which is pathetic in 2016.  They had 5 employees so only employees can use the wifi and the guests who pay money can't use it.  The nice lady at the counter told me about the 5 people limit.  Both of us tried to get on wifi and we couldn't even when all the other guests were gone??  Makes no sense to me."}
{"text":"Overall the items I had were ok.  The ribs were tender, the potato salad and Mac and cheese was great.  The baked beans tasted ok, but the texture was kinda strange.  Like it was maybe undercooked.  The muffin tops were also a little dry.  My biggest issue was the burnt ends and brisket.  I was disappointed to find chuck steak used instead of brisket meat.  Also no smoke ring to be found and the meat was dry.  Since they used chuck the burnt ends were basically just big chunks of chuck and not really burnt and not smoked.  I'm gonna hope that they ran out of brisket and baked or grilled a chuck roast in a pinch.  I'll give it another shot cause the ribs and sauces were good.  Ask before you order brisket!"}
{"text":"My wife and I are not fans of this place, mainly due to the prices.  Looking through the online menu we wanted to try a lot of things and ordered the 4x4 sampler platter.  We are not big eaters, but the amount of food we got with respect to what we paid was not appropriate.  Looking at their platter meals you can opt for 1, 2, 3, or 4 meats.  These come with 2, 2, 3, and 4 sides as well as 1, 1, 2, and 2 corn muffin tops, respectively.  When you get 1 meat you get 1/2 lb of meat, but 2 meats you get 2/3 lb.  They don't list how much meat you get with the 3 or 4 meat platters, but it's not enough for what you pay.  We got sausage, brisket, burnt ends, and pulled pork.  Everything felt a little small, especially the brisket in which we only got TWO slices and the burnt ends of which we got maybe 6 small pieces.  I weighed it and it came in at just over 1 lb of food.  Why is this $35 -- $23 more expensive than 1 meat, when it only has double the food?  Usually you give a discount when ordering more, not less!  In terms of the taste, everything was good, but not amazing.  In terms of sides we got mashed potatoes & gravy, mac & cheese, green beans & bacon, and baked beans.  Size on these was fine, but the taste was hit and miss.  Baked beans were pretty normal, mac & cheese was good, green beans & bacon were strange -- like the bacon was just thrown on top at the last minute.  The mashed potatoes & gravy, as others have mentioned, taste like they are from a box; very thin and salty -- a slightly better version of KFC mashed potatoes & gravy.   The sauce selection was a bit lacking.  Although neither me nor my wife enjoy vinegar or mustard based sauces, all three sauces they have are tomato based.  This may be a turn-off for some.  Additionally, the pickles that are touted for each platter?  Two or three thin slices and that's it.  Additionally, there is a huge disconnect with respect to online ordering.  The menu on the website shows that the 4x4 Sampler is $33.95, but when you go to order it online it's $34.95.  Additionally they give out coupons on the back of the nearby Albertson's receipts and have a sign inside the restaurant that you get $5 off your first online order.  Unfortunately the receipt has no codes to enter online and the $5 off the first online order would have been useful if we had known about it!  Nothing appears on the website about this at all.  We didn't like all the food, but we liked enough that we'd probably get it again, but not at the price we paid.  Either the price of the sampler needs to go down by $10 or the amount of meat in the sampler needs to go up by 50%.  Would normally give 3 stars for this, but giving a 2 due to the online, sauce, and pickle issues.."}
{"text":"Grabbed some take out as it was our first time. Got the 3 meat combo. Pulled pork was dry. Brisket tasted as if it was grandmas stew meat. No smoke whatsoever. I'm sorry this brisket was not even treated properly. You could see the collagen still and no smoke ring. And this is called BBQ? Please Burnt ends were soft and wet....this was no burnt ends I have ever had.  Sides for this dish seemed like a deli tray add. BBQ beans were still crunchy (obviously under cooked) , slaw was watery and bland. Seems like they just added vinegar and that is it. Mac and cheese...kraft makes better. With this mess there is no way I will give this a second try as this was in no way BBQ"}
{"text":"Finally some good BBQ in Henderson. There are not many tables inside since most are the oversize picnic tables so get there early. There are many meats to choose from as well as all the delicious sides a BBQ normally offers. They have sauces on a station near the register so its best to fill up some cups and grab utensils before sitting down. - I though the burnt ends were on point as well as the brisket. I would definitely get both of these when I visit again Pulled pork was average so I wouldn't get that again with the other options that I enjoyed plus the ones I have yet to try. -The sides. The mac n cheese was top notch. May favorite side at any BBQ place and would recommend it here as well. I was not a fan of the cole slaw or the collard greens. Cole slaw lacked flavor and the collard greens were drowning in the vinegar."}
{"text":"Great food, decent lunch specials.   Good portion sizes and the French fries are ridiculous.  Three sauces to choose from."}
{"text":"My family and I ordered our food for take out.  We had the pork ribs, brisket, pulled pork, mac n cheese, fries, corn muffin tops and collard greens.  We thought everything thus far was very good.  My husband's favorite was the brisket, while mine was the pulled pork.  The ribs were fall-off-the-bone tender and not overly seasoned.  Our meal should have included the pickles and sauce, which, unfortunately, were not packed in our order.  I was quite looking forward to the peach cobbler but that was what limited this review to 4 stars.  It wasn't completely cooked as my first bite still had a raw dough taste.  Also, there was a very strong metallic aftertaste which made the whole serving inedible.  I love cobbler...just not this one.  Will this keep us from coming back?  No, not at all.  The restaurant was clean and the staff was friendly.  Glad to see a good BBQ place on this side of town that is reasonably priced."}
{"text":"This place is really go authentic bbq... Burnt tip sandwich is really good. They have some awesome brands of root beer from across the country. Had a root beer float."}
{"text":"Loved this place, very low key and friendly and it is what it is. If your looking for a five star Gordon Ramsey like restaurant, this is not the place for you. It's a good barbecue joint that just got started, and for the most part the food was good. It would get 5 stars if it had plates, but the kinks will get worked out, I'd recommend for un fussy people that just want to visit and have good home style barbecue."}
{"text":"This was very good.  I usually don't give 5 stars out without the exception of a true five star, but for bbq this is a one excellent place.   I had the Mac & Cheese and the Andouille Po-Boy and they were amazing! I tried the brisket and I haven't had briskett that good out here in Las Vegas. While the ambiance may not be the best in the world it works well for here.   I will be back as soon as I get the chance but I am not down this way that much."}
{"text":"Over priced and i would not recommend this place. I would rather go to miller's ale house or famous dave's. You can probably make better bbq at home."}
{"text":"Ok so here it goes... I'm a true fan of some good ol BBQ so I'm constantly looking for a great BBQ joint. I was super excited to see this place open in my area but was a little apprehensive at first to try it because they have had some really bad reviews in the past. However up until recently their stats have been better so I decided to try it for the 1st time with my family  The service was extremely lacking though the woman taking my order was very kind, she had no real suggestions to give me when i asked her. Your employees when asked, should know exactly what are your \"must try, items\" and make it sound Good! I'm extremely indecisive unfortunately and if I could try everything in 1 sitting I would lol....Service was extremely slow for a place that was empty...which was another one of my concerns as I sat there waiting for my food...i was thinking damn is their good not Good? Little advertising? Idk  Now on to the Food....i judge every BBQ place by how good their corn bread is for some reason, i love hommade Cornbread but theirs was little off...they need a New recipe ASAP, it was super dry and had no flavor...Chicken was dry too, brisket was Good, I make better collard greens, their mac n cheese was mediocre, they need a New recipe for that too! Perhaps Serve a macaroni pie instead...i went from being excited to see fried okra on the menu to being dissapointed, tasted generic.  Now the only reason why I gave this place 3 stars is because their Burnt Ends were the Bomb! I will be coming back just for their Burnt Ends for sure!"}
{"text":"Pulled pork was watery. Like a goulash, was not pulled pork chucks like i am used too, more like shredded meat soaked in a vinegar based BBQ sauce and cooked in a crock pot.  The pictures show a true pulled pork, my order was very wet and mushy. Staff seemed friendly enough. Had to squeeze past the order taking area to get to drink machines and hard to get a refill on drinks if there are a lot of customers ordering food.. Brisket was tender but a bit salty and fatty and we did not order the fatty brisket either.  BBQ sauces were very good.  Corn bread topper was extremely dry, could not eat it..  A bit pricey for what you get. Fly's were every where. More than likely will not go back for a while. Will follow the reviews to see if there is improvement."}
{"text":"I heard about this place through word of mouth.  Since it was in Henderson, it was quite a drive; but, I thought I would try it out anyway.  I ordered a pulled pork sandwich (comes with slaw and pickles) and a brisket platter with mac and cheese and beans.  The sandwich was pretty good once I add some of their snappy sauce to it.  By the way, the sauces are get warmed in containers you have to ladle out into small cups.  The brisket was decent, not exceptionally flavorful. There wasn't a great smoke ring on it and the pull was pretty easy.  The  Mac and cheese was basically nothing great and the beans were somewhat bland.  All in all, in a pinch I would come here for a sandwich.  If I want great BBQ, I'm going to continue down the road about another 15 minutes to Boulder City. That is the hime of the best BBQ in Southern Nevada.  I will let you look it up. If you go there get the beans.  You can thank me later."}
{"text":"Customer service is not good. We called over half a dozen times in a row and got put on hold for 10 minutes, hung up on, blotchy service, and it was difficult to hear the person on the other line as it was really loud.  Finally placed an order to go. Went down there and the place was EMPTY around 1pm!  I got beef tips, brisket, and cobbler. Also got the burger and onion rings. Burger was so so. Onion rings weren't fresh. Brisket was good, a bit too salty, and NOT HOT. Beef brisket wasn't even warm. The tips were really good. Fat melted in your mouth and wasn't chewy. The sauce was seasoned well and didn't over power the meat. Loved the tips but everything else was eh and forgettable.   Oh, the cherry cobbler was the worst thing I've ever seen. The crumb topping was yellow. It tasted like a stick of butter mixed with a punch of flower over canned cherries that expired last year.   The 1 and half star was for everything but the BEEF TIPS, as I do recommend them and would go back just for them. However, I am only 5 minutes away. If I was any further I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"First time trying this spot in Henderson. The decor is cute, we had take out. We were greeted promptly and decided to try a lil of everything. I really enjoyed the ribs, my wife loved the sausage and the brisket was pretty good too. I loved the muffin tops, so delicious. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Drove by on Boulder Hwy and this joint caught my eye. Looks like a converted defunk chain from the outside. Pleasant and clean on the inside with huge pine picnic tables. The menu is posted and polished, which makes me wonder if this is a chain too. Cashier lady was super friendly and patient with people who stand in line for a long time and can't decide what to order when they get to the window.  Had the chopped brisket sandwich with side of collard greens, both of which were still available at 7 pm on a Saturday night. Food takes awhile to be delivered which is OK but curious for a place where everything is pretty much pre-made. Topped with pickles and slaw. 3 different BBQ sauces available self-serve, all good, but I liked the \"snappy\" one. Served on a nice butter- topped bun.  The meal was delicious and no reason to deduct any stars, so 5 it is.  Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Henderson is short on great food places. In a town packed with generic chain restaurants, this little place was a dream come true. The mac and cheese is classic and the smoked brisket is exactly what I was looking for. When you don't want to fight the crowds in green valley, stop by and meet the owner and really feel welcome."}
{"text":"Food was good, not great.   But we were I. Mood for BBQ.     Mac and cheese was pretty bland and the slaw wasn't worth the calories.   Potato salad was good (fill based) and beans were plain, not very saucy.   Brisket was good, pulled pork was good ."}
{"text":"Came with two coworkers, walked right in at doors open. First off we got blasted with warnings they were out of pulled pork and some other items. First thought in my head was, BBQ usually cooked nightly, you open at 11, why wouldn't I be served fresh BBQ? I got the excuse that they got hammered due to the holiday, again, if you cook at night that shouldn't matter. That was my cue to walk out.   I ordered a three meat platter and so did my coworkers. Got the smoked chicken, two bone baby-backs, and brisket, with slaw and potato salad (greens were cooking :-/ )  Ribs were off tasting, don't know why, good meat but just didn't have a smokey flavor.. Brisket was chopped and w bits of fat, it was ok. Smoked chicken was good, but cold on 2 plates, I.e. Not right out of the smoker. Potato salad was super creamy, not bad but not good. Slaw was really off putting, tasted super vinegary and had peppers in it... Had fried okra, that was good, and finally the corn bread tops which are just corn bread molded to look like tops, mega mega dry and grainy, tasted like cheap of cheap mix. Even the iced tea was boring, try Luizanne or Lipton orange pekoe, everything else is just weak.  Sauces, meh... At least they were warm. The staff was humming around, again nice, but food, not for me. Even ordering the food seemed novice and taker seemed discombobulated, I asked the gentleman if he was ok, as he was cursing and upset about something... (Not at me though thankfully)   Las Vegas needs a Rudy's like Phoenix and Goodyear recently obtained."}
{"text":"I'm very picky about my BBQ and Tucky's delivered in spades!  I got the brisket and pulled pork to try no sides cause this was about the meat.   The pulled pork has to be some of the best I have ever had. Flavor and seasoning throughout and not just from the bark. This alone made me a fan.   The brisket was delicious, moist, and tender. Next time I visit which will be soon I'll be trying a platter."}
{"text":"I love brisket and theirs is great. You can order it chopped or sliced and fatty or lean. The best I found is fatty and chopped for the sandwich. As well as the pulled pork and pulled chicken sandwiches. The potato salad is seasoned well. I suggest the sweet BBQ dipping sauce for the sandwiches. Friendly service and clean restaurant."}
{"text":"Pulled pork was very tasty.. would return again. My brother had beef sliders are recommended."}
{"text":"Always pass this place on my way to and from work and finally made the stop the other night, I'm glad I did. Ordered the 2 meat combo. The spare ribs were delicious and so was the 1/4 chicken. You get to choose from 3 different bbq sauces that is hot from the burners that you serve yourself from, a first for me when eating at bbq joint. I liked it! The Mac and cheese and baked beans were both very good. Service was excellent, the lady was very kind and welcoming. I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Best BBQ I've had... and I'm a BIG guy who loves BBQ! We got the 4X4 platter. You get 4 meats and 4 sides. Believe it or not it's pretty good size sides. The sauce they have is the bomb! You can put that on my shoe and I'd eat it! The place is clean and cool to eat inside. I've been to places where it's dirty and dingy yet the food is ok. This is awesome I would highly recommend!!! 10 stars!"}
{"text":"SOOOOOO GOOD!! The mac and cheese is off the charts good. The portions are a good size and reasonably priced. The brisket makes me happy happy happy!"}
{"text":"We had lunch here yesterday.  The food was soooo salty that my tongue is still in pain.  The coleslaw was as salty as the meat. And it was super expensive.  We will never go back. I usually don't write reviews but I want to let everyone else know so they don't waste their hard earned money and time.  I'm hoping my tongue heals soon.  :/"}
{"text":"This is seriously some of the best bbq in Las vegas/Henderson. Burnt ends are lip smacking."}
{"text":"Great food and environment. The slaw has a very vinegary taste almost to strong.  Service is a little slow and it was not very busy. Only issue we had was there was a dog in the restaurant. It was a little dog and it kept barking when new people came in. The owner of the dog kept telling it to be quiet but still a dog inside the restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"I'm a BBQ guy and have tried places all over the country. This is my favorite kind of place. Low-key and all about the food. I got the rib tips and brisket ends, with collard greens and slaw. This also came with cornbread, which was crumbly but delicious. If I lived closer I would be a regular."}
{"text":"For a brand new business, Tucky's BBQ is solid: The vibe is chill. The service is friendly. And the bbq is bomb. I'd love to give Tucky's more stars but they aren't there yet... My first visit was within a week or so of opening, and it was clear there were a lot of kinks to work out.. A month later, much better but  they still have some room to improve.   Tucky's is not a spot to go if you are in a hurry. It is casual, order at the counter service. Each time I have been in there has been a line to do so and the person taking the orders has been friendly but lacked a little pep in their step.    Pricing for BBQ is right where I expect it to be, as compared to both national chains and other locally owned BBQ joints. Platters like the 4x4 or the Carload are a great deal if you have a group of 2-4.    On my first visit, quite a few items were sold out, this is understandable at a newer restaurant and especially at a BBQ spot.... On my more recent visit there was a noticeable improvement, the only item that was sold out was the spare ribs.   I am not really a fan of the sides. The mac and cheese is decent enough I suppose, I prefer it to be a bit creamier than how Tucky's does it.  Cornbread is hit or miss, it was a bit stale on my most recent visit. But the meat...  Oh that smoky, sweet delicious meat. I am a rib girl, and Tucky's ribs are meaty and tender and so yummy. My husband enjoyed the brisket which is what he judges all BBQ spots on. The pulled pork is always on point.   As others have pointed out, Tucky's epitomizes old Henderson, aka Hendertucky. It's not going to be a spot for everyone. This is not a hifalutin eatery, just some delish bbq served in a very laid back environment."}
{"text":"Tucky's Smokin BBQ - Henderson, NV  I remember trying Tucky's Smokin BBQ back when they first opened in 2015. I was impressed with my entire experience. The BBQ was quality, the prices were better than most, and the portions were stacked. Back in 2015, we got the 4x4 Sampler, which is 4 meats and 4 sides, for $24.95. I remember leaving full, satisfied, and if I reviewed them then, they would have been given at least 4.75 stars. What a difference two years make. The portions are a lot smaller and the price for the 4x4 Sampler is about $10 more. The burnt ends are pretty good and the brisket is okay. Skip the corn bread if you have a choice. I recently came here looking forward to leaving stuffed and satisfied. I left wondering \"where's the beef?\" I will probably be back one day, but I'm in no rush. There are just too many other BBQ joints out here that kept their portions big and prices the same. The good news is that this place was busy by the time we left. Business still looks good. Good for them."}
{"text":"Loved the ribs and mac and cheese. Corn bread unfortunately was dry. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"When the opportunity arose to have dinner with some friends that I've known to enjoy good smoked meat, I decided to continue my foray into the burgeoning barbecue businesses of the Las Vegas area.  Inspired by what they call the \"best of the best\" barbecue to create their own \"Nevada smoking style,\" the folks behind Tucky's Smokin BBQ have injected life into a previously boring stretch of Boulder Highway in Henderson. With their standalone restaurant situated between a McDonald's and Chevron, you might not expect much, but that's sometimes where the magic happens.  After seeing what my friends wanted, and doing some quick math, I decided to go with their \"Carload\" super pack ($39.95) for simplicity and for modest savings over ordering the individual items. The super pack comes with a half rack of ribs, mix-and-match 1.5 lbs of other meats, 2 pint-size sides, 4 corn muffin tops, pickles, peppers, and sauce. Don't expect your order to come out instantly even though they've been smoked already, but do expect care, even cuts, and good portions.  For the ribs, we had their saucy back ribs, which are glazed with their original BBQ sauce. The ribs don't have that spicy kick that I've found elsewhere, but they were smoked, consistently tender, and pretty flavorful regardless.  As for the rest of the meats, I went with half a pound each of sliced brisket, rib tips, and burnt ends, the latter of which are coated with sauce. The brisket was surprisingly tender and definitely among the better executed versions that I've had so far. The rib tips were even more remarkable. They tasted the best out of all the cuts, and they too were surprisingly tender. The burnt ends, on the other hand, were on the dry and chewy side and didn't compare to their brisket. I would recommend against the burnt ends.  Sadly, I found nothing special about their sauces. They could well be store-bought or from some chain as far as I can tell. The snappy sauce didn't taste that spicy, the sweet & zesty was not memorable, and the original just seems like an average BBQ sauce.  Their sides were pretty good though. The potato salad seems pretty straightforward but temper some bites. The slaw is somewhat acidic more than sweet and creamy (to be clear, it's not creamy), so it's also a great complement. The corn muffin tops are as good as any flavor-wise, and any possible dryness is covered by the accompanying butter.  I don't think that they're doing the best barbecue in town, but Tucky's Smokin BBQ definitely has some good food that exceeds run-of-the-mill chains, and Henderson needs businesses like them. I'd come back for their brisket and rib tips, and I certainly want to try their other meats for a more well-rounded opinion."}
{"text":"It's about time Henderson got a true blue BBQ place! We've been here twice now and both times the food was consistent (important to me). We've had the chopped brisket, front and back ribs, burnt ends, potato salad, Cole slaw, mac and cheese, and baked beans. The meat is fantastic! I've never been asked front or back ribs before. The back ribs have a dry rub and I felt like they were meatier and less fatty. The back ribs were very tasty and had sauce. The burnt ends were good, but when given the choice I'll eat the ribs and brisket over them any day. I think the chopped brisket is the best thing there! We also enjoyed the mac and cheese, baked beans and potato salad. Unless you REALLY REALLY like vinegar, the Cole slaw isn't for everyone. The muffin tops are a great idea but I prefer cornbread with creamed corn in them. They could be more moist and would taste better with some corn kernals. Overall I give this place 5 stars based on the food and prices. Service was fine, but there's not much interaction so that's hard to rate and consider. We'll be regulars for sure!"}
{"text":"I ordered the \"One Meat\" platter which came with 2 sides. Mac and Cheese and Potato Salad, they were both awesome! I opted for the Brisket sliced which the whole meal is a lot for one sitting! Had to ask for a to go box! Save a little room for the peach cobbler!!!"}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal! My only complaint is they tend to run out of certain dishes early. Clearly, this is due to those dishes being absolutely incredible. Feeling hungry? Get the 6 bone. Want something to start with? Get the fried okra. Really, you can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"I was trying to think of something for lunch today and thought \"hey, I've never tried Tucky's.\" Well, I like BBQ and Tucky's is close by so the choice seemed the logical one. I ordered online for a pick-up and was shown a 45-60 minute window. This gave me some time to do some quick shopping before headed to the restaurant. I was actually there within about 15 minutes so I sat in the parking lot for a few minutes. Out of curiosity of the status I checked my email confirmation and it said there was only a 20 minute pick-up window. That was, like, now. So in I went and got my meal right away. I was also given three cups for their three sauces. Soon enough I was on my way home with drool dripping down my chin.  Today I ordered a two meat platter with chopped brisket and andouille sausage. For my sides I got green beans with bacon and potato salad. And the meals come with corn bread and pickles too.  Starting with the brisket, it tastes like BBQ. There was a small pink smoke ring and some of the chunks. And a decent bark. But it seemed a little on the dry side. I tried each of the three BBQ sauces to moisten the meat. I don't know which sauce was which but I like the one with a little more spice (zippy sauce?).  Next was the sausage. Sweet and smokey with a crisp casing. Delicious. A good sausage to be sure. I would have liked a hot link instead but that is by no means a dig on the andouille. I used some of the sauce on the sausage too. The sauce that was a blend of sweet and spicy was good for this purpose. The sweeter of the sauces was my least favorite over all though all were good in their own right.  I ate the pickles and corn bread next. The pickles are thin sliced and quite briney. A nice few bites to wake up the taste buds. As for the corn bread, it was corn bread. A little dense. A bit dry. A hint of corny sweetness. Not much more to be said about that.  The green beans and bacon were fine. The beans were crisp which leads me to believe they are fresh as opposed to frozen which tend to be mushy. These beans could have been cooked less (a quick blanch) to retain more crispiness but they weren't bad. I had hoped the bacon would add more to them. Maybe fry them in bacon grease. Now that would be awesome!  The potato salad was a classic preparation of red potato with onion and celery. It was creamy and tangy as a good potato salad should be. And there was a hint of dill which I am a sucker for. A classic preparation done right.  I did not get to fully experience Tucky's having taken my food to go but I did see that it has a good country kitchen atmosphere that compliments the food it serves. The smell of a smoke pit was not as prevelant as I had hoped but it does smell like a BBQ restaurant. There is no mistaking it. I didn't deal much with the staff as I just picked up and left but that aspect was simple and friendly enough. Tucky's doesn't have my favorite or even the best BBQ but its a good local joint for some solid BBQ. I can see coming back again."}
{"text":"Pretty good brisket and mac and cheese."}
{"text":"yummmmmmmmmy! This place is Amazing the brisket ,the mac and cheese to the greens. peach cobler was the best ive had in my life.  Prices are unbeatable."}
{"text":"Love this place! Whenever I'm in this part of town I make sure to stop in for lunch. Love the ribs!"}
{"text":"Honestly, not worth the price at all. We got the 3 meat combo platter and got chicken (pieces), ribs, and brisket. Even after talking to the person on the phone about what whole chicken pieces come with it, they gave me the pulled chicken instead. Food was cold. Portions were TINY! You can get more bang for your buck at Lucilles. I will say though, the mac n cheese was really good, and their bbq sauce is really tasty."}
{"text":"Having spent several years in Memphis I have at least a passing idea of what rib place should be. This one stacks up pretty well. While it lacks an obvious smoker outside attended by sweating barbecue experts, it offers dry rub ribs.  That suggests that they are willing to let you sample their smoked product before it gets slathered with sauce.  I had a half rack of dry ribs and they were excellent. There was plenty of meat and it was well cooked with lots of juice.  My wife had the loaded spud which was a potato with meat and cheese and some other stuff it was really good.  The number of customers both inside and for takeout indicates that the place is well respected. Recommend you give it a try."}
{"text":"As a Georgia transplant I was missing that down home, porch sittin, sweet tea sippin, bbq sauce spillin back yard bbq atmosphere.  I found it at Tuckys.  It's a ways off the beaten path but well worth the trek.  Melt in your mouth brisket, southern style Mac and cheese.  Gather your friends, skip the Texas Roadhouse joints around town and have a seat at Tucky's picnic tables.  You'll love it."}
{"text":"A BBQ joint on Boulder Hwy? Sounds a little if-y, but I promise it was GOOD (and safe!)  The restaurant is open all day- none of that only open until we run out aka 10AM like they have at other BBQ joints. It's clean, friendly and a great place to go with family.  The best deal is the 2 meat, 2 side platter. Obviously choose pulled pork, then decide between baby back ribs and the brisket. The meat was amazing, a great portion and I was 100 percent satisfied. The sides however, not so much. The battered fries were crispy and a must order. The potato salad was okay. The mac and cheese, corn bread and beans were all disappointing. I'm pretty sure I've made boxed corn bread at home better than their stuff!  Everyone is extremely friendly and helpful. You can order online on Yelp and you'll order will quickly be ready for pick up. The BBQ sauces are on the side- don't forget to pick some up if you're ordering to go! The sweet sauce is so so good. Make sure you get extra of that one over the original and spicy one!"}
{"text":"Great tasting St Louis ribs.  Wooden parkbench decor."}
{"text":"I ordered the \"Fifth wheel\" pack, in my opinion I felt it was too pricey for what I got. Anyways, their Mac and cheese and  ribs were amazing!!! Wasn't a big fan of the potato salad and their corn bread."}
{"text":"This place is OMG good.  We got the 4 x4 to split and try almost everything.  I think the best are the brisket chopped and slices (gonna get 5 pounds for Passover!!), the polish sausage and Andouille Sausage, baby back ribs, collar greens, mac n cheese, the sauces and the peach cobbler!!!  If any improvements or changes could be made I would the baked beans are too mild for our taste, would like fresh green beans but know they are pricey and the corn bread could be stepped up with perhaps more flavor - sugar? some creamed corn?  But in any event, don't change a hair for me because I am a new regular, just moved into Cadence down the road.  I am gonna say it takes no teeth to eat their beef!!! and ribs and ..."}
{"text":"Fire food, best smoked bar b q I've ever had. The even remembered my family fr.a few weeks earlier."}
{"text":"45 minutes to closing time, I'm the only one in here on a Tuesday night and 15 minutes later my salad still hasn't arrived. WTH? A simple smokehouse salad. Chicken was dry and the brisket was pretty fatty. Some of the employees seemed more interested in their phones then providing good customer service."}
{"text":"Tucky's  makes one of the best BBQ Briskets in the Las Vegas area. Quick service and friendly employees."}
{"text":"First visit. They serve a great brisket, we think better than Lucille's and Famous Dave.  Pleasant family atmosphere with nice, not too loud music - helps for conversation :-) Will definitely come back - final answer!"}
{"text":"This is good BBQ.   Consider myself somewhat of a BBQ freak, and have had good, bad, and ugly BBQ all across the country. A friend told me about this place, and it took less than 24 hours for me to get over there and try it. Quite frankly, getting good BBQ in Las Vegas is tough.   Ordered the 4x4, a 2 bone sauced baby back rib moppet meal, and 1/2 lb of burnt ends. Sides were watermelon, green beans w/bacon, and baked beans. And of course cornbread muffin tops. The meats in the 4x4 were the dry rubbed spareribs (St. Louis), pulled pork, brisket, and andouille sausage.  The sauced baby backs, pulled pork, burnt ends, and andouille stole the show. The ribs were cooked perfectly, with a little tug, not fall off the bone which is exactly how I prefer them. Great sweet and smoke flavor. Andouille sausage was very tasty, and the pulled pork that I got was well cooked, nice smoke flavor, and a good amount of bark in the mix. Couldn't do much better. Burnt ends were very good. Nice bark, and well cooked, fall apart/melt in your mouth.  They have 3 sauces, and all of them were quite good. Probably preferred the spicy and sweet and zesty the most, however the original was tasty as well. Would recommend the sweet and zesty on the pork, and the spicy for your beef.  The service was great, friendly and engaging. Restaurant was clean. The only thing that kept this from being a 5-star review was the brisket. The brisket I was served was \"kind of\" sliced and \"kind of\" chopped. Kind of a mix of the two, which didn't really matter to me. The flavor was pretty solid, but it was a bit over cooked in my opinion. A little too fall apart tender. Most people would probably love that, but like with ribs, would like a little tension/tug. Just my preferred texture.  Kudos to Tucky's, hope they prosper for a long time!"}
{"text":"Tried the newest spot in Hendertucky and was pleasantly surprised! Awesome customer service, great food and portion sizes. My only complaint is they were out of peach cobbler, which must mean it's popular! All in all great experience and we will be back!"}
{"text":"Thank you Yelp for helping me find this place! I have been addicted since I found it!! Their loaded spuds are incredibly good and their ribs are just as amazing! I could eat this everyday for a year and still not get tired of it!!"}
{"text":"My first time into Tucky's was not bad. The location is decent not difficult to find, and once you open the doors you see the immediate signage of the menus. The decor was nice and very well fitting with the country style. The restaurant was very clean and I absolutley loved the picnic table setup. I wasn't a fan though of how the menus were listed when you first walked in, but were not posted where you order so I forgot half the food I decided on (ordered the bbq for two) The food itself was delicious, just the pulled pork was a bit dry. The rib tips were the absolutely best and I will be back for plenty more. Great food, and highly recommendable establishment! Thanks guys for filing my belly right! :)"}
{"text":"First time here but I would say this is one of the best BBQ places in all of the city. Great food great portions comma collard greens baked beans macaroni and cheese all homemade from scratch."}
{"text":"We had Tuckys cater our wedding last weekend. Everything was beyond amazing. They showed up on time, set up was super easy, we had enough food for our 70ish guests to enjoy seconds and thirds, and still had a bunch of leftovers to take home. All our guests raved about the food - they literally couldn't get enough of it. We had two meats, three sides, rolls, and even mini pies as dessert. The price was so reasonable, it blew all of the other quotes we received out of the water. I'm actually writing this as we're sitting inside waiting for our order.. We had to come back a week later just to eat it again. Like what is there to think about, it's just bomb bbq."}
{"text":"Sheesh I am super dissapointed. I have passed by this place everyday since moving down here to Henderson and read so many great reviews I thought it was a must stop in. So today I popped by for lunch and I have to say this was is no way what I expected. The brisket (chopped) was decent not great has a buttery flavor. But the pork ends were just awful honestly I couldn't even finish them. The cornbread was dense and dry again only managed a few bites didn't care for it at all. Green beans taste like a frozen product really rubbery and water based. Mac and cheese was OK I guess not really anything to speak about honestly. I tried all three sauces and again from the reviews I was just super let down it didn't do anything for me I'd rather just use sweet baby rays."}
{"text":"Great BBQ!!  I have been all over the country and Tucky's is better than most. I had the pork and brisket. I'm not a huge brisket fan, but this was good!"}
{"text":"Very friendly.  Prices not bad.  Brisket was fabulous, however, the pulled pork and spare ribs were very dry.  Green beans were frozen and bland."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Would have given 5 stars if I would have known they had fried green tomatoes before I paid for my order. Of course that didn't stop me from ordering them though. Wish I would have tried them sooner!"}
{"text":"The food and service were good. We tried the BBQ42 and were happy with the choice. It comes with 3 meats and three sides. All of the meats were tender and tasty, but be aware the brisket seemed to be very salty."}
{"text":"The best bbq out there. Mac and cheese was awesome. Good service and awesome food.  Our new bbq place to eat. So go try it out folks. You won't regret it!!!!!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food here. We have been here twice dined in once and took togo order the second time.  Both times were good . We tried the pulled chicken pulled pork rib tips ribs baked potato the corn muffins potato salad and side of pickles. Loved it all . Just wish the corn muffins were warm and are kind of dry. Good to have some good bbq up in this part of henderson."}
{"text":"Wow what a hidden gem. This has to be some of the best BBQ I've ever had and for certain some of the best VEGAS has to offer. We did a tasting of ribs, pork and brisket with a bunch of sides, Mac and cheese green beans and Bbq beans. We will be back often now that we know about it."}
{"text":"I would not recommend this place to anyone bad customer service, the owner was smoking inside the restaurant and my meat was so salty you could barely eat and my bacon was so over cooked it was black and just crumbled into pieces it way over priced for the quality of the food. I've had authentic smokehouse barbecue and this is not it !"}
{"text":"I am from Birmingham, Alabama so I love BBQ. This is not good BBQ at all. The mac n cheese is average. Cole slaw is alright. It's vinegar based and not mayo based so beware!  Baked beans are dreadful. And now on to the meats. I tried the chicken, the brisket, and the pork. Normally I would write a single synopsis of each meat, but in their case, sadly I don't have to. They looked different but all tasted the same! Smokey flavor is missing! The meat tastes like it was marinated in salt for years. We did carry-out so I can't comment on customer service or anything like that. I will say they would have to treat me like a Greek god if I ever went back, cause I definitely wouldn't go back for BBQ!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Love the BBQ pulled pork. I'm from the south where the BBQ and smoked meat is always great. It's so hard finding a good BBQ place. Tuckys reminds me of home!"}
{"text":"Ok so I am biased because I've have GREAT BBQ from Lynchburg, Memphis, St. Louis, Texas (Coopers in Llano, TX and Mason, TX) so its a bit hard for me to say this was great BBQ...it was ok, just ok. The problem is that people who have never had great BBQ will think this is great stuff and if this is all you can get then its ok every now and then. So again this was not the worst we've had in Las Vegas, in fact it was one of the better places but still its just ok. My order was wrong, the brisket did not have much flavor and it tasted like it had been sitting all day, the mac n cheese was very soggy, the baked beans had no flavor (you would think they would add some BBQ meat or something...worst beans we've had) the potato salad was just not good. The best thing was the andouille sausage and the fries.  No jalapenos, pickles or bread...the corn bread was ok to dry and crumbly. I did like that the sauces were kept in a warmer and the zesty one was the best but they too tasted generic. We wont be back, we are in the hunt for a better place in Vegas but I would recommend this place over any other except John Mull's Road Kill Grill."}
{"text":"The brisket melts in your mouth and is so flavorful on its own, you wont want to add any sauce! I'll be back again very soon!"}
{"text":"All of the sauces taste basically the same. I'm from the south and this wouldn't qualify as BBQ in Tennessee. Very nice people, but the service is slow."}
{"text":"Ahhh-mazing BBQ!! My 2 kids and I headed over from our hotel by Lake Las Vegas. The atmosphere is casual, a good menu, reasonable prices. We tried a little of everything. The pork was incredible and the sides were real down south style and GREAT flavor. Six thumbs up from us!!"}
{"text":"So...couldn't wait to try this new place out. We DEFINITELY need more restaurants out on the east side of Henderson. All the reviews were good too. So today I sent my teen son in to place a to-go order. We ordered the \"Carload\". Because we love leftovers...and let's face it, I'm raising a teenager!   The super pack is $39.95 and comes w/ a half rack of ribs + 1 1/2 lbs of other meats. 2 pint size sides, 4 corn muffin tops w/honey butter. Sweet pickles, peppers, and sauce.   We chose 1 lb of pulled pork, 1/2 lb rib tips, Mac & Cheese & a baked potato. The food smelled incredible when my 15 yr old brought it out. I asked him how much he tipped & it wasn't enough (imo) so I sent him back in a 2nd time w/more money.  Once we got home we began unpacking. The corn muffin tops were a nice surprise w/honey butter. Sweet pickles while not my fav, were still crisp & good. My son is somewhat of a Mac & Cheese expert and he wasn't impressed enough to wolf it down like he normally does. He'd wanted me to get both sides as Mac & Cheese, but after he tasted it he said \"I'm glad we only got one\". The rib tips were very good. But we didn't have any bbq sauce! It's called Tucky's Smokin BBQ...and other than the rib tips...we had NO SAUCE! I double checked the menu to make sure it said it \"came with sauce\" and it did. I was even aggravated @ my kid! How are we supposed to eat bbq w/no bbq sauce?! He said the 2 girls @ the register didn't ask him if he wanted any sauce...so he thought they would just pack it.   Later that night I decided to call Tucky's I was so annoyed. The gentleman I spoke to said the cashier was supposed to tell my son about the bbq being in the dining room. That its homemade & one of their signatures. He apologized for the lapse. He also promised that next time we come in we'd get a big container of sauce. All nice stuff. But that doesn't help me w/the meat I have in our fridge! And I'm still annoyed that I sent my son in w/more money to tip the cashiers and they didn't do their job correctly.   The meat...that we nibbled on was tender and good though. Will stop for bbq sauce at the store on the way home tonight."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!! Just simply amazing ....must try...well worth the drive The ribs are right on ....the chicken was perfect and my favorite was the rib tips"}
{"text":"Everything thing was good. The meats were super tender and tasty. Nice serving sizes."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Tuckys BBQ. They had a nice little dining room with picnic tables, it was very clean and comfortable.  We placed our order with cashier she was very friendly and walked me through the family meal with three choices of meat. We got baby back ribs, shredded pork, andouille sausage, and brisket along with mac and cheese, loaded baked potato, and pot salad which we ordered to go. All the meats had fantastic flavor the ribs were my favorite they were super tender and flavorful best I've tasted hands down!  Sides were also really good. I could of done without the cornbread muffins which were a bit dry. The best touch was the three BBQ sauces which were self serve and served hot, they must of been homemade??  I'll be back with my family for sure nice job!!!"}
{"text":"Order Tucky's via DoorDash. Food was delicious. Nice size portions, good flavor and perfect temp for delivery. Had the chopped brisket, rib tips, Mac n cheese, mashed potatoes, one St. Louis rib and one baby back rib. Everything was great. All the meat was tender and flavorful. The sides are a nice size and also had great flavor. This is a nice little bbq joint in Hendo and you should definitely give them a taste. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Great food, great service! As you walk in you feel as if you are at your grandmothers house, the decor is really nice. As you walk in the restaurant, there is this really nice, delicious smell that penetrates your nose. We went there at about 3:30pm on a Tuesday, nobody was in the restaurant at this time, I started to wonder how good this food is, but I'm glad I took the chances and ordered. As we approached the register we were treated by this wonderful young lady (I forgot to get her name) but she made us feel welcomed, she explained to us what dishes they had, always smiling also. We ordered a rack of ribs, the rib tips, and the pit fries. Rack of ribs were perfectly smoked, I've been to many places were they sell \"smoked\" ribs and believe me, it's not a pleasant taste. However the flavor of these ribs were delicious! The rib tips were also just as great. The pit fries...... order them!!!!! Delicious combination of brisket, cheese and BBQ. We will go back to try the rest of the menu!!!!!"}
{"text":"Sooo tender. Melts in your mouth.  Be sure to order the brisket.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I am definitely coming back to Tucky's!  I am not quite sure yet, but this could be one of my favorite BBQ places.  Not being much a fan of BBQ, my first foray to BBQ was of course Lucille's and Famous Dave's  As I started to learn more and to really enjoy this cuisine, I ventured out to Rolling Smoking BBQ, Bell's and Big B's.    Today I wanted to try Tucky's and it hit the spot for sure.  Brisket - they don't have a choice of moist cut or regular cut, just their cut. It was very moist and just right.  Pulled Pork- Normally a bit dry at best, I found this to be pleasantly moist and with a bit of sauce just right.  I did not have bread to put this in, just the cornbread topping.  I enjoyed it, just would not normally order it.  Saucy Baby Back ribs - very, very tender smoked ribs.  Each piece was just right and nearly fall off the bone.  For the sides, we had the collard greens, beans and potato salad.  All were fine, but I was here for the meats.  Next time, i am going for the brisket, the sausage and the chicken. I definitely like bbq chicken so I cannot wait.  The wife and I shared the bbq for two which includes three meats. They also sell by the pound and do catering / delivery as well.  The prices seem reasonable and you get a sense they really care about their food.    The restaurant itself odd both in location and also style.  Seems to be a refurbished fast food place on a slip road just north of Lake Mead and Boulder.  I will be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"We got Baby Back ribs which were excellent, fall off the bone. Fries excellent, corn bread excellent and baked beans and Mac and cheese were good. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Food is great  , portion size not so much I paid about 20 dollars for me and my 7 year old to go , got home and it was the bare minimum amount of food. I stretched it out for us, needless to say. However , I won't be dining here again unless I am solo."}
{"text":"So happy to have found a great place to eat in the neighborhood.  Tucked away away from the busy street.  This BBQ place will hit the spot.  Comfort food for the soul.  Their homemade bbq sauces are great!  Three chiices: a great original sauce, a slightly spicy sauce, and a bbq sauce with a little bit of a sweeter side.    We ordered the 4x4 to get a taste for the bbq.  The Bones Back rib that day was more tender than the Baby Back ribs.  The brisket was so tender (would definitely order this and the bones back ribs again).    Fruit cobblers are different daily.  Ive been able to try the apple, cherry, and peach.  So good. The crumble topping is my favorite!  Some of my favorite cobbler.    Good news for on the go people.  You can call an order in and pick it up.  I also saw that eat24 and bitesquad can deliver from here as well.  They will also deliver for large party orders."}
{"text":"A new bbq spot in Henderson! Sweet! Not to mention right by my house. On a Sunday night my husband and myself met our friends Carrie and Mike for dinner here at Tucky's Smokehouse Bbq.   Joel and I had used my trusty Yelp app to check out the menu beforehand. I'm glad we did because we would have totally been in the way of the crowd of people trying to read the menu too. It's just an awkward setup. It was confusing trying to figure out who was looking at the menu and who was standing in line and who thought they were standing in line. They did have paper menus at the tables which was helpful to look at while you were waiting in the line.   The decor is simplistic which is cool with me. I do wish the seating was s little more comfy. The tables are a mix and match set up. Some are dining room tables while others are large picnic benches. Each table is equipped with your very own roll of paper towels and you'll need it! I loved that they had three heated bbq sauces thy you could serve yourself along with forks and knives.   On to the most important part the food. Joel and I shared the two meat platter that comes with two small sides and cornbread. For our meat we got chopped brisket and polish sausage and for our sides mac and cheese and bbq baked beans. The polish sausage was awesome, but I found the brisket fatty. The mac and cheese rocked and the baked beans were full of flavor. I also enjoyed their sweet and zesty bbq sauce. Great kick and not overly sweet. Carrie and Mike had the ribs which I found to be dry. Carrie also got a s'mores dessert that they were featuring. I was surprised when she took a bite and had a terrible look on her face! She said it tasted like chemicals and had to spit it out. They were nice enough to refund her money, but as Carrie was getting her money we overheard the owner yelling at staff members. That was very off putting.   I realize that Tucky's Smokehouse Bbq is new and is still working out some kinks. I'll be back to try some other items on their menu and hopefully I can bump up their rating from 3 stars to 5. Fingers crossed for this Henderson bbq joint."}
{"text":"We ordered the brisket and burnt end for two meat combo platter,  potato salad and baked beans for the 2 sides that comes with it. We can't resist ordering the rib tips and additional mac and cheese, everything was good, love the bbq sauce! maybe except for the brisket which I find a little bit dry for my liking, but still we will definitely come back for more"}
{"text":"BBQ was on the money delicious fall off the bone ribs and ends. Sides were tasty and service was excellent. A local secret place that serves it up right. Find your way over I was pleasantly surprised. I will be visiting whenever I'm in Henderson."}
{"text":"Always good and at a great price. My favorite is the brisket my son loves the sausage and Mac n cheese"}
{"text":"Hmmmmmm i think this place has potential.  It was ok. My husband and i stopped in here about 7 on a Friday evening for a take home dinner.  We got the 4x4 for 24.95. We got the pulled pork, brisket, bologna and sausage.  We didn't receive any sauce so we had to use our own. The sides were definitely small as they say on the menu. The brisket was dry and hard to chew. The sausage was ok the pork was still moist and ok. The bologna was just chunks of well, bologna. Nothing really stood out here and the portions were pretty small for the price. I think if we do decide to give it another go it will be in about a year or so to give them time to settle in.  Right now i definitely wouldn't really recommend giving it a go unless you've got some time and money to blow."}
{"text":"This place is great, I tried the pit fries. It's a small mountain of crispy crunchy fries smothered in cheese and smiley pulled pork, BBQ sauce, green onions, and their rib dust seasoning. It was delicious!"}
{"text":"I saw this on Eater and Yelp and had to try it. We live in Henderson so a new food option is nice. Its in the old Pizza hut on Boulder highway and Lake Mead. You can smell the smoke as you park and walk in. I went for lunch. The spouse decided that I should venture this one on my own since I am more of the new food person in our small family. I did the Platter 2 pulled pork and Brisket with slaw and baked beans. Also came with Corn muffin tops. They have a good reputation as pitmasters and a Member of the National BBQ assoc. Brisket was pull apart tender with a great smoke ring. Their sauces are kept by the front on warm sauce pans. I like how this is done way better than squirt bottles with sauce in them. Pulled pork was tender full of flavor and juicy. I really liked the baked beans, they had excellent flavor and a small bite to them. The slaw was just okay. Little too much vinegar for me. Did not care for the corn bread. very dry. I will go back and take Josie, see how she likes it. I want to try a few other things on menu. Cobbler looked enticing.  If you are in Henderson or driving through give it a try."}
{"text":"Great food and service. The brisket had a nice smoke ring. It was tender and moist. The burnt ends were the bomb! I had the mac and cheese & the collared greens for sides. Both were top notch! Only con was no beer!"}
{"text":"Tried Tuckys today and probably won't be a return customer.  It's a very clean place and the employees were nice enough. However, for the price, the food itself just managed to achieve Low expectations.  Had the baby back ribs which were overcooked and dry. Also, I know it's barbeque, and you're trying to showcase the taste of the meat but it really could use a little more sauce.  The sides I ordered were pretty bland.  The mashed potatoes had no flavor and the baked beans weren't even a little sweet.  I had to salt Everything which is a real shame.  I wish this place the best of luck but I don't like suffering buyers remorse for lunch.  I'll continue to look for a local bbq joint I can call my go to."}
{"text":"The BEST BBQ place I have been to since moving here in 1996! The atmosphere is welcoming and friendly, the music is terrific, air is on high blast and so you never get too warm. Staff is very nice and knowledgeable about the many different food options. Service is fresh and fast! Love the 3 different kinds of sauces! The brisket melts in your mouth, the rib tips are very good, macaroni and cheese is delicious! Corn bread muffins taste like they are from the deep South! Very highly recommended and we can't wait to go again! Large size portions every time and drinks are ice cold ! Much variety in the menu! We just love this place!  5 out of 5 stars!"}
{"text":"This was my meal. The 2 meat combo. I got brisket and andouille sausage with fries, cornbread and slaw.   Pros: The brisket was moist and tender.  The fries had a nice crunch to them.  The inside of the restaurant was nothing fancy as you would expect from a BBQ place, like a cafeteria, but with kitchen tables and chairs. There are picnic tables also.  Our service was friendly.   Cons: The brisket had little to no smoke flavor.  The slaw was lacking in flavor for me, as I like a sweeter slaw to go with my BBQ.  Some people in our party had stale dense cornbread while others had light and moist cornbread.  The andouille sausage tasted like it was from Hillshire Farms. I'm not saying it was, but it had that Hillshire Farm consistency, look and feel.   If you know your BBQ you might be disappointed.   I hate to give low marks as people are influenced by reviews. This place, in my opinion, should rework some of the menu recipes. If the restaurant is not reading the reviews than how would you expect them to improve?"}
{"text":"I didn't allow myself to eat any salt for the next two days just to average out the amount of salt Tucky's put into their pulled pork.  When I wrote the owner about it, I got no response.  I am not a fan of plastic knives and forks.  They were OK when I was 12 but I really didn't like them even then.  As an adult, I just don't want them at all."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall Gem! That location has seen restaurants come and go since it was a Taco Bell about 15-18 years ago!  The place was clean and neat. The meat was all tender and almost fell off the bone!  Mac and Cheese and variety of sauces were excellent too."}
{"text":"Yesterday while driving around, my family and I noticed this little place. We decided to stop in and see what it was about. As soon as we walked in the door we where greeted by the staff. They informed us of how to order and that we could sit anywhere. Which was unusual but kinda nice since we could sit anywhere. Sadly this place is the same building as the old Pizza Hu, so it's a little cramped if you're 6'4\" like I am. After looking over their shockingly small menu I finally ordered. Settling on a pulled pork sandwich with a side of baked beans. (Can't go wrong with pulled pork.) or so I thought. I asked for no slaw on it, which sadly they still put on the sandwich. No big deal to me though I ate it anyways.  The slaw tasted of straight vinegar. Completely killing all taste in my mouth. The would normally upset me but what really upset me though. was the fact the pulled pork was not only dry and chewy like rubber but cold to the touch. It tasted kinda fresh. I say kinda because the bread was nice and fluffy but the meat was blah. Almost as if the sandwich was made a long while before I had ordered it. I'm unsure if they serve all pulled pork cold but I prefer my BBQ to me moist from the marinade and warm from being slowly smoked. So sadly I won't be returning for another try anytime soon. They get two stars because they where clean, organized and their staff was friendly."}
{"text":"We were so excited to have this place open close by, so there was a lot of expectation when we finally made it yesterday. They definitely are still working out the logistics of being a business, so be aware. This is \"order at the counter\" style service, so if you are looking for a place where someone will wait on you go elsewhere. The food is served in tin foil, no plates and the napkins are a roll of brown paper towel on the table. The lights were not on in the dining room at 4:30 in the afternoon, probably trying to keep it cool but it gave the impression that they were not open or too cheap to turn them on. A LONG LONG wait for food when you order, and they didn't give you a number or take your name when you order so they were wandering around the restaurant calling out the food item, which more than one person had ordered. Chaotic, to say the least.   That said, the food WAS good. I got Brisket and Burnt Ends, the green beans with bacon, cole slaw and corn bread. The Burnt Ends were delicious, however the Brisket was almost too fatty to eat. I had to pick the meat out of the fat. But that yielded tasty results. My son had the kids meal with spare ribs, and ate them and asked for more. Their homemade bbq sauce, fantastic!  All in all, I would like to go back in a few months to see how things are coming along with them. I really hope they can work out the kinks and make it, since their food is very good. I am giving 3 stars with the hope of upgrading them when things get more organized over there."}
{"text":"Clean, fast friendly service, yummy ribs, green beans w/bacon, fries, the cherry cobbler was good (but not true southern cobbler).  A  large menu - a little pricey but we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to stop in for lunch, and I'm glad I finally did today. This place is AMAZING! The best BBQ I have had in town. I ordered the brisket, mac n cheese, and potato salad. Th brisket fell apart! Everything was homemade and fresh. I will be returning."}
{"text":"We had pulled pork and pulled chicken sandwiches with potato salad and green beens and it was awesome. It's more or less a self service place but we had a friendly talk with the owner, very nice guy. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"We just arrived from the Bay Area, CA and after resting a couple hours at the hotel we decided to go out to eat.  Husband was in the mood for some BBQ and decided to try Tucky's BBQ out and we were not disappointed.  They know their BBQ - pulled pork was great, chicken and ribs were great.  Potato salad and baked beans were really good too.  We left there full and satisfied.  Would definitely recommend Tucky's to our friends if they are heading out to Las Vegas or Henderson to try them out.  Thank you for the food and good service!"}
{"text":"My wife and I just ate some carry out for the first. We were greeted in the parking lot by one if the owners as we pulled up 5 minutes after hours.  We were offered the option to have an order to go. We took them up on the offer of course and we weren't disappointed. The food is great! Compared to the other local options, this place is now on top.   Tuckys is my new, go to BBQ place! The food is priced very reasonably compared to other choices in the area.   I feel it's important to mention this family owned, local business deserves your business at least once. You won't be disappointed!  Great people and even better food!!!"}
{"text":"I'm not a big reviewer, but I did have to make this one. New to the area and have been craving some bbq. Unfortunately I was disappointed. I ordered the 4 x 4. Spending $36 I expected to have a big meal to share with my co workers. It was a personal plate. The taste is decent but the quality was terrible. We had brisket, Burnt ends, rib tips and hot links. The brisket was very dry and brittle. No snap and crumbled as you tried to pick it up. That tells me that it was probably from yesterday and they reheated over cooked meat. The sausage are store bought. Taste like evergood links from Costco. Rib tips were ok and the best thing was the burnt ends. Good texture and taste. I think they season the meat well. The execution was bad. Mac and cheese was dry. Similar to kraft from the box. Potato salad was decent. The bbq beans were sweet and tangy. Unfortunately I don't like overly sweet bbq beans. With the other selections available in Vegas I will not becoming back."}
{"text":"Service: As stated in another review, there's an employee here that hates her job at the register. Not a 'smile,' a 'hello,' a 'what the hell is your order?' She wasn't mean, but wasn't nice either. After we received our food, not one person came to the table to ask if we needed anything or if we were enjoying our food. Note: I actually like this at restaurants, cuz I like to eat in peace, without harassment from waitresses..Some might have been annoyed, though.  Food: Ordered their 4X4 Platter for 2-3 people. The brisket and sausage was perfectly smoked. The burnt ends were fattier than most I've had, but still VERY yummy nonetheless. Fries were... Fries. Mac & Cheese was pretty decent, above average. Mashed potatoes had to be from a box. Very non-homemade tasting. Muffin tops (made famous on Seinfeld) were dry, overrated, and didn't taste as I hoped. The whole purpose of muffin tops, is to eat the harder part of the muffin that has more flavor. These were soft and not much flavor.   BBQ sauce was in these hot(very unique idea) kettle thingys. You pour your own into cups. Very tasty, but 'too hot' and 'too cold,' can change the flavor consistency of condiments. The sauce here tasted a little ketchupy. I think if it was cooler, it would've been more on point.  Overall, I'll be back. I'd recommend buying some of the meat by the lb, and supplying your own sides at home."}
{"text":"Great hidden gem in Henderson near Water Street and Boulder Hwy. This company knows it's meat and proves it. The employees are well educated on the varieties and treat you well. I would rather eat here then Famous Dave's. Only thing missing is beer, but they have an awesome assortment of sodas in the bottle. Will keep going back and recommend."}
{"text":"Stopped by here while visiting family nearby. We ordered brisket and pulled pork. The food was amazing, and the service was  solid."}
{"text":"Best BBQ I've had in years.  So much delicious food for the money.  Friendly staff and clean. Don't pass this one up!  We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"First off, they lack personality.  When you have a restaurant the face of the establishment is one greeting/taking orders!! I know it's Saturday but let's be friendly!!  The food isnt the greatest, the mac n cheese was awful and dry. The pulled chicken wasn't that great either, both chicken and brisket just super salty.    We came here from the yelp reviews and I was hoping that it was going to be fantastic but I was let down. The buns they use were awesome and the slaw was bad.   The employees smoking outside look like loiters. I wasn't sure who they were at first until another man showed up wearing a shirt. To be honest the one guy was out there the whole time chain smoking. Maybe he's just a friend or a worker. I hope they all washed their hands after their smoky treats!!"}
{"text":"This is definitely a welcome addition to the neighborhood.  It's a cute little place and it definitely has a country vibe to it. I dined here for lunch on a recent Wednesday. They open at 11AM and we got there just about 5 minutes after that, but the door was still locked. They apologized and let us in and a small crowd showed up after us as well.  The staff is friendly and helpful, which is always good. I ordered the loaded smoked spud with brisket and it has to be one of my new favorite things. Seriously, so delicious! Although the brisket was a tad dry and there was nowhere near enough sour cream.....I devoured that thing! My BF ordered the salad, also with brisket. He liked it, although the corn salsa that was served on it was still frozen when they brought it out. No bueno.   I believe it was around $10 for my tater and a soda, which is reasonable. I will definitely go back and try some other items. Make sure you get there EARLY, because when it's gone, it's gone."}
{"text":"Tuckys went above and beyond for our MCJROTC warrior night!!!  90+ turkey legs!!!  It was an amazing!!  We thank you so much for your efforts in locating the size we needed!!!  We will definately keep you in mind for future events!!"}
{"text":"Delicious. I had mango habanero smoked wings. And my wife had the brisket sandwich with Mac and cheese. Hit the spot."}
{"text":"I've had their BBQ before and it is usually really good.  I was so disappointed with what they served up to accompany a celebratory day, I felt the need to provide this review.  I ordered their Brisket by the Pound on Mother's Day.  It was extremely fatty and salty.  I had to throw away half of it away because it was inedible.  In addition to the Brisket I ordered their dry rub and saucy racks.  Again...salty and underdone/tough.  The only thing that was really good was their smoked chicken, and surprisingly their smoked bologna.  My family had never had it before, or even heard of such a dish.  They said it was really nice.  Everything else was not.  Here's hoping their regular chef was off that day to celebrate Mother's Day and that he/she will be back to work to continue to provide good 'que."}
{"text":"Some of the best BBQ in Vegas!  All around good food. my kids love the smoked Mac and Cheese. The brisket and burnt ends are wonderful the smoked sausage very good. The baked beans are excellent. The in's are meaty and very tasty.  They the have quick service but their portions are kind of small. This coming from my kids who always seem to fight over the ribs, the corn brea and the Mac and cheese. So be ready to order extra."}
{"text":"OH. MY. GOODNESS. This place is amazing! Their menu is STACKED! I ordered the brisket, pulled pork, Mac & cheese, potato salad and cornbread. It's great because they give you the meat with out bbq sauce so you can try multiple sauces and choose which one you want to smother your choice of meat. I chose the zappy, it was delicious!! The service was great, so friendly and a warm welcome and a, how was it, on your way out. All in all a great place to go. I don't think it's pricey at all! The servings are massive! The seating/dining area is so cute and the music is old school and the just the whole vibe was awesome. Doesn't feel like you're in Vegas! You get what you pay for and this place is EVERYTHING."}
{"text":"The BBQ is delicious and tender. You get a lot of food for a low price. Love their corn bread muffin tops. Always greeted with a smile every time I come here."}
{"text":"Ive been stationed in all over the country and have tried alot of different bbq places. This by far is one of the best bbq places i have had in a while besides home cooked of course. Food was delicious, flavorful, and juicy. The staff was very friendly"}
{"text":"Just updating after another visit, this time with a friend who being from Texas is (in his mind) a BBQ expert.  We both went with the combo platters, brisket, rib tips, pulled pork. He said his was great and thanked me profusely for showing him this place (I know he's been back 3 times since).  Being a bit disorganized on my initial visit, they have improved greatly. Everyone was friendly and organized...the whole process is smoother. The BBQ itself is getting better...the brisket tasted a lot better this time around. They serve it chopped up, so its not easy to see the smoke ring, but the flavor is right up there.   Only room for improvement would be the sides. I had the BBQ beans and coleslaw. For me...the slaw is all vinegar and not creamy like I like it. Not my style. The beans have a heavy smoke flavor and a bit of spice, while I like them a bit sweeter or with a hint of maple. Just my opinion, doesn't detract from the fact this is a pretty good BBQ spot.   They do take out, and sell by the pound. Catering also. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Terrific BBQ in Henderson!  I had the pork sandwich -- generous, juicy and very satisfying.  Joe had the andouille sausage sandwich.  Also generous and delicious.  I wish there was an outlet closer to us -- we'd be regulars.  Clean, friendly and welcoming.  Good stuff."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's quaint and there is not one thing wrong with the food. You definitely get your monies worth. Only little issue is no way wipes but plenty of paper towels in the table. The food is so tasty and scrummy."}
{"text":"Sweet tea is perfect! I also had the big hungry with brisket and pulled pork so full of flavor! Baked beans perfectly made. Great music, clean dining area and temperature was perfect inside!"}
{"text":"Very cute little place, very comfortable seating inside. Nice and cozy.  Menu is large, but not too large. The people were friendly.  The food came out pretty quickly, we got the BBQ for 2 with brisket, pulled pork, and rib tips. The meat was nice and tender, very smokey. Everything tastes homemade. I did get a mouthful of fat that was kind of gross with the pulled pork, but that's kind of unavoidable.  The fries were battered, which I love. Greens were good, potato salad was good. I am picky with potato salad, but this was a nice, mild, savory type. The only reason it lost full 5 stars is that mouthful of fat was unappetiZing, there were a TON OF FLIES that keep landing on me and my food incessantly, and they had a \"don't tread on me sign,\" so that was uncomfortable :/"}
{"text":"so i came and got the BBQ for 2 meal. First off, there was not nearly enough food for 2 people. Not sure how they came up with their portion sizes but theyre too small. We got brisket that had no flavor, chicken that was over-cooked,and rib tips that were actually really good, so ill give them that. The mac and cheese was bland and tasted like it had been sitting out for a day, not fresh at all. The baked beans were good and the green beans were meh. The cornbread was just dry and awful. For $33, i expected more and i regret even going there. Save your money and just go somewhere else, not even worth trying."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! They are a tad pricey, but it is definitely worth it! The employees are really nice, and the food is to die for! Love everything about it!"}
{"text":"Great food :) I had the Texas Filly Sandwich and a side of collard greens. Always Freshly cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"I think this place has potential. This side of Henderson needs a LOCAL BBQ place.  1- the service was prompt and polite. They explained the daily special and how to order. It was a little off putting to see a coworker smoking by the door. (Outback would be better)  2- the prices were average. It wasn't extremely cheap and not overpriced.  3- NOW the food. We had the brisket which was good. It had a little fat in it which I prefer! It was moist and a good bbq bark. The smoked chicken was just ok. It's chopped chicken?? No bone in.  The sides are a good portion. However, the beans taste from a can with sauce mixed in. No brown sugar and other goodies. The Mac n cheese has potential but it was reheated to long and the cheese had curdled. The cobbler was AMAZING! Simple, good cobbler.  Overall~I think we will give it another shot. Maybe just get a pound of meat to go. Make our own sides and of course, grab some cobbler. I hope they read the reviews and are open to make changes. I love to support local places."}
{"text":"We soooo wanted to like this place!  We ordered the Mac daddy with pulled chicken but no chicken.....maybe some pork or brisket....couldn't really tell. Tasted ok but was cold. Husband got the 2 meat platter to share with fries and cole slaw. The brisket was good but the pulled pork was way too salty.  The cole slaw was unusual...limp with a strange spice.  My cole slaw loving daughter didn't like it. The fries were hot and crispy!  Fries and brisket were good and the reason for 2 stars.  Don't do the cornbread....feels like you took a bite of sand."}
{"text":"Oh HELL Yeah! Sometimes you just have to venture off the narrow path to find something amazeballs right next to a Chevron.   LOVE the St. Louis style ribs.  Homemade pickles and a tangy slaw that actually made me believe that BBQ is downright healthy."}
{"text":"We've been wanting to try Tucky's for awhile, but it's a little pricey. We decided to give it a try tonight and got take out! All of the meats were amazing! Chicken, brisket, ribs, and burnt ends all were tender and flavorful!Beans were good. Cornbread is good. My mac n cheese is better than theirs. I'd order again, but probably just meats!"}
{"text":"Was skeptical going in.  The wife ordered a pulled pork sandwich & I got the brisket sandwich.  My biggest turnoff is fatty meat so I was on the lookout.  Very pleased to say no fat at all.  The baked beans were hot and delicious and the Mac and Cheese was on point.  Peach cobbler was just ok but am very pleased and will be back."}
{"text":"Good food, not good service. I don't know why I called in my order an hour before I needed it. I got here and it still wasn't ready. It just defeats the purpose of timely pick up. At least offer a drink or something. Like I said good is pretty good, a little overpriced but hey"}
{"text":"First time.  Pull pork sandwich was great. Enough meet to fit on a bun. Zesty sweet sauce home made. Delicious.  Just sent sweetness and spicy. Very satisfied for my fisrt time here."}
{"text":"WOW!! Just got the Fifth Wheel with an extra rack of st. Louis ribs to mix with baby backs. Also the brisket was AWESOME!! Everything was awesome, the potato salad and beans were awesome. We are all stuffed like the pigs we are...lol. Thank you Tucky's for a great meal and satisfying our BBQ craving. The guy who took my order over the phone was super nice, very helpful and knows how to talk to customers. Thanks again guys..."}
