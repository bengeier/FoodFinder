{"text":"We live in the neighbourhood and have been to this place a few times and it has never disappointed. It gets busy fast nowadays so make sure you book in advance, especially on the weekend.  On our most recent visit my wife and I brought our son (he's 6) on a Friday night. We sat by the large windows at the front and had a great view of Yonge Street. Our server was fantastic, she was great with our son, and really attentive. At the end of the meal I ordered a specialty coffee that she wasn't familiar with, so she googled it and totally nailed it - some of the best service we've had in a while.  My son had the fungi pizza and he loved it. I had the pappardelle with duck ragu and it was spectacular, the duck was so rich and flavourful. The desserts are very rich and are served in small mason jars. My wife had a pumpkin panna cotta, my son had a chocolate mud pie, and I had an apple crumble. All three were stellar. The wine selection was great. I already mentioned my specialty coffee but have to mention again that it was spot on!  We all strongly recommend Lil Baci!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were searching for a nice cozy place to eat on a Friday night. Lil Baci taverna , which was close to his house seemed like a great option. The restaurant was empty, it took forever to get the menus and food and the food was ok but not excellent. Pretty small portions. The costumer is really not the priority here."}
{"text":"No stars. Just spreading the word that the basic steps of service is non existent here. The food is tasteless except if you are getting a samdwich or pizza I have only heard good things from people I dined with about the pizza and sandwiches I have gone twice and after my lost experience I will never go again. Cause truely there is nothing bringing me back which is disappointing considering I live in the area. Also the response I got in email form from the manager was really not what I expected after the long extensive email I gave I work as a restaurant and if someone ever emailed the owner like that they would do a lot more then just hoping for me to come back. So yeah just spreading the word don't bother wasting your time here unless you enjoy tasteless food with crap service! Only receiving a star because you have to in order to post a review :p"}
{"text":"Went to Lil Baci for Summerlicious - it was not a good experience. Everything from service to presentation and quality of the food was sloppy and disorganized.   - Service was very slow and there seemed to be general confusion amongst the wait staff. We saw two orders being delivered to the wrong tables, while we sat ~15-20 minutes before a server even came to our table to take an order or even say hello. They were kind enough to bring us a bread basket....but not until after we had already finished our appetizers.   - The entree (steak and risotto) was terrible. They didn't ask me how I would like my steak cooked and it came out like strips of leather. The risotto was undercooked and the whole presentation incredibly unappetizing. I barely touched it.   - Dessert was served in water glasses with giant spoons too big for the cups. The kiwi sorbet was tasteless and the worst \"fresh fruit\" sorbet we'd ever had.   - All the food was dripping in oil and very over salted.   The evening was not a total loss. The patio is very nice and the coconut ice cream was very good! Not worth it though. Will not return."}
{"text":"Downtown cool at Yonge and Davisville, nice wine selection, all menu items sound great. Lamb sausage pizza was sweet & spicy, a touch on the sweeter side, crust was excellent. Service was superb."}
{"text":"Definetly too pricey for what it is. Menu has limited choices and lots of items were out of stock when I went. The pizza would have been decent if it wasn't served (and probably coooked) on an alluminium plate, which gave the food a 'metallic' taste. This is also not healthy. Pizza should be served on a regular plate or wooden board. Definitely not Italian style!"}
{"text":"Used to be my go to place for pizza and pasta.  Loved it.  But sadly it all recently slid badly when they changed the menu, reduced the portions and pulled back on the ingredients.  Their generous, cheese oozing mushroom pizza has been reduced to a dry flat-bread.  Heaping helpings of pasta are now stingy little plates designed to open your wallet wider to multi-course meals that fail to satisfy.  Hope they go back to their winning formula before it's too late."}
{"text":"Dined here tonight with a friend. The food was fantastic! There is certainly no lack of italian fare in the area, but Lil Baci is one where I would return after tonight.  Our waiter was personable and friendly, and gave us the time and space that we wanted. We both had pasta dishes (the duck pappardelle is highly recommended) and while what I would consider smaller portions by north american standards, every bite was packed with flavour and was just the perfect size to be enjoyed with an ap.  Great patio.  This restaurant seemed to accomodate many families with small children but that did not hamper our experience.  Il Sogno down Yonge St is where we will continue to visit for a more 'adult' atmosphere."}
{"text":"Oh damn. The memories! I went here ONCE with my sister when she lived near the Mt. Pleasant & Eglinton area. It was too expensive to make this a regular jaunt (although their super delicious fresh pasta entrée I ordered would definitely prove to be habit-forming had I the money or didn't live so damn far away). We had a two-hour walk after this meal to alleviate the calorific carbicidal guilt. Thank God.   First off, their Ricotta Cavatelli with Brussels sprouts, roasted cherry tomatoes & grated Pecorino cheese was DIVINE! I usually hate Brussels sprouts or any other vegetable but I guess Pecorino & Ricotta cheeses would make shoe leather taste awesome. I would return with a dinner date or some friends JUST for this pasta dish.  Secondly, the Pizza Margherita my sister ordered was pretty good but I was left hankering for more fresh Basil & a less thicker/less dense crust. I think they also overdid it a bit with the cheese but I don't like lots of cheese on my pizza in spite of being able to annihilate bricks of cheese in its unadorned perfectly-aged state without crackers, deli meat or crudités. I enjoyed the crunchy charring & air bubbles but I've had better Pizza Margherita at Viva Napoli (even if Viva Napoli's gets soggy around the middle which warrants a quick 5-7 minute 450-degree broil in the oven when I bring it home).    Anyway, it was almost $40 for the two of us & I don't remember ordering alcohol. I think my sister ordered a glass of wine or house salad. Either way, I love laboriously taking out my anger on handmade pasta (which I discovered too late/very recently), so $15 for Cavatelli I can make with a healthy dose of patience & a flick of a bench scraper is sort of a precious waste of simoleons (even if I wasn't the one who footed the bill).  P.S.: For quite awhile, I was wondering why I couldn't find actual tangible ricotta chunks in my delightful pasta dinner. Turns out: the actual pasta itself has ricotta incorporated into it! It's almost like Gnocchi dumplings-- just with cheese (instead of potatoes)!"}
{"text":"Service here is great! Food is good. Drinks are just what a hot day on the patio ordered. Although there is a clear lack of cider on the drink list. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Ate at Lil Baci Taverna last night.  the food was amazing. Cencione with pork and beef ragu was perfect, the pizzas are hands down the best in the city.  I've eaten and queen a lot, but this place takes the cake, queen is great, but they turn it up at Yonge.  GO, Go, GO!"}
{"text":"Went here for brunch and got the eggs benedict.  The eggs benedict was definitely tasty.  However, they gave two poached eggs on only one little quarter of a slice of their homemade bread (kind of like a crunchy pita bread).   When I asked for another slice of bread to even out the proportion of egg/pancetta to bread, I was charged $3.  Seriously? For another quarter-slice of thin pita-like bread? That's not appropriate at all."}
{"text":"Simple, delicious, unpretentious food.  Small but well-curated wine selection.  Service isn't always the most attentive, but it's always friendly.  I've never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Lil Baci is a great, intimate Italian restaurant. The Gnocci is to die for, and the pizza is delicious too! I would recommend to order from their 'Specials' menu as those items are usually mouth-wateringly delicious!"}
{"text":"I've come here a couple times since i live in the neighbourhood, and i'm always impressed by how good this place is.   While simple, the food is full of flavour. I'd say the best part about Lil Baci is the pasta. It's clearly homemade, and the sauces that come with it are super fresh! Pizza is also very nice as well. Like the pasta, all of the ingredients on the pizza are fresh and delicious. The crust and tomato sauce on are what really set them apart from other restaurants i have been to. My only complaint is that the consistency varies. Some nights the pizzas are perfect. Other nights, the pizza is 50% crust! Even though i have only had this happen to me once or twice, i'm sure there must be some difference in skill between the chefs when it comes to making the pizzas. As a regular, it doesn't bother me too much since i know it's a one off, but it wouldn't be a good experience for a first time customer.   Service is another strong point. The staff are always very friendly and accommodating, and hustle hard to make sure you aren't kept waiting! The sad thing is that despite their best efforts, i have seen many poor reviews on service. I'm not sure if it's just the neighbourhood, but i feel as if many people who come here are extremely finicky and upset by the most trivial problems. For instance, a waiter brought 3 plates of food to a party of 4, and came back 20 seconds with the other plate. After leaving, the table complained that the food did not arrive at once. How silly! Not only can the waiter not carry more than 4 items, but surely waiting 20 seconds for another plate to arrive is not the end of the world! Before writing this review, i took a look at other poor reviews for this restaurant, and realized that most of them are probably written by the highly fussy crowd that goes here. If my server had not suggest that i write a review, i wouldn't have known about these small complaints, many of which i would not take seriously. As a regular, i can assure you that the food and service is consistently great, and it would be a shame if you didn't go here because of a few sour reviews!"}
{"text":"What a great brunch me and girlfriend had on Saturday morning. Everything was excellent. The waiter was so kind and the breakfast is unforgettable. My recommendation is go for it. A++"}
{"text":"They burned my pizza. I really wasn't impressed. The crust was totally burnt... I still ate the main part of the pizza, but I normally like to eat the crust too, and it was inedible. I also ordered a Riesling wine, which was decent.  Service was pretty slow/strange too, with multiple waiters serving me (starting with one waiter, but another waiter ends up handling my Visa payment... what's up with that? should be service from the same waiter, otherwise who am I tipping?)  ...  definitely won't be rushing back."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Everything we ordered was delicious and cooked perfectly. The pastas are my fave. Lots of options for all different tastes."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came for the Winterlicious menu. It was also our first time to Lil' Baci.  Our waitress was very friendly and we were seated promptly. The wine list had a good variety, we went with Il Bosco, we both loved it.  For our app's we had the duck meatballs, they were absolutely amazing, so rich and so delicious, this is a must have! We also had the sardines (first time for both of us) and they were fantastic, cooked perfectly with great taste.  For our mains, we had the pizza, classic Italian style, it was awesome. We also had the osso bucco, the meat was fall off the bone tender and the red wine risotto was delicious!  Dessert we had the apple crumble and mudpie, both did not disappoint!   Lil' Baci has it all, great service and amazing food! We will definitely be going back!! I definitely recommend, especially if you can make it for winterlicious as not all of the items above are on the usual menu.  Half liter of wine, plus three courses came to $85, we think it was well worth it!!!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by this place. I had the Eggs Florentine and my wife had the baked eggs with eggplant and tomatoes. Both delicious and good sized portions.  Mine arrived with house fries (potato squares) cooked in duck fat. Fantastic. Regular coffee top ups, fresh juice and great service means we'll recommend this place and definitely return. Maybe try the dinner menu next time."}
{"text":"Super consistent local pizza/pasta place that is good for families or groups or couples or whatever. Laid back, casual, good value, friendly-corner-Italian. Like it and you will too. Very T.O. Joint...."}
{"text":"Tasty food and nice atmosphere. Unfortunately it's a bit cramped so very romantic dinners may be better off somewhere else. Service was friendly and helpful. Decent value for dollar, but the food was nothing extravagant; still quite tasty. I would return again as it is a good addition to the yonge eglinton neighbourhood."}
{"text":"I ordered the Lil Baci Hero for lunch. Pork/beef meatballs worked wonders together in this sandwich. Along with tomato, basil and melted mozzarella this is something I could see myself eating and enjoying every day. Looking at the picture I took of it makes me wish I had two: one for now and one for my fridge."}
{"text":"The fresh made pasta is fantastic. I had the Papardelle with duck ragout and my wife and the lemon and pine nut spaghetti. The flavors blended so well together and tasted so good. The calamari came with fresh tomatoes and chick peas which were dressed lightly and flavorful. Will definitely go back to try other fresh made pasta dishes."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and have thoroughly enjoyed it. The Mama pizza and the sausage pizza were both terrific - the crust is thin and chewy, the toppings inventive (but not weird), and the sauce isn't overpowering. The caprese salad is quite good, although a bit small for sharing. I also enjoyed the wine selection. The dessert as amazing - had some sort of chocolate s'more mousse pot and practically licked it clean. Will definitely return! It's an nice atmosphere for a not-casual, not-fancy dinner or lunch. Service was lovely and very friendly both times."}
{"text":"We ordered dinner through uber eats. The Charred Brussel sprouts were charred to the max. I thought charred means to blacken the surface, not burn the whole thing. They were so burnt they looked black. The Arancini were burnt too and the presentation was terrible. One of the Arancini balls looked like someone decided to take a bite before sending it to us. We ordered an hour before closing, so I guess they didn't care because they knew we can't send it back. The pizza was okay. Would not eat there again just because I can't imagine how somebody would send burnt food to a customer."}
{"text":"Delicious authentic Italian food. I had the caprese salad and the Nonna pizza. It's a little pricey, but worth it when you want something good and satisfying. The pizzas are large enough to share. Nothing quite like thin crust homemade pizza from a stone oven!"}
{"text":"I love the place. The service is great and the food is good. My suggestion the papa pizza.....  is delicious"}
{"text":"It could be a nice experience if only it didn't take them over an hour to cook eggs.  Interior is nice, menu looked promising... But an hour? If you did a mistake - ask customers if they want to wait or get whatever you cooked.  No seriously, who doesn't come for a brunch hungry already? And no coffee included with brunch (someone commented before that it is).  Good point: they admitted that something was wrong and the brunch was on house."}
{"text":"We stumbled on Lil Baci today for brunch.  Super cute menu and both of our dishes were delicious.  Loved the italian twist on brunch of eggs with tomato sauce (and eggplant).  Super yummy!!  I will absolutely go back!"}
{"text":"A gem in the east side!  Often overlooked behind the massive underwhelming line from Lady Marmalade. One of the only places that serve food past 3pm in a Sunday (hangover brunch). Their eggs ANYTHING are divine. Pizza are also crispy and smothered in cheese - they know the way to my heart.   Favorite thing: those damn meatballs. Soooooo cheesy and juicy and just the right amount of tomato sauce to make every bite heavenly.   My go to hangover brunch spot :) highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Brunch  Ambience: 3.5-4/5   Food: 3.5/5  Service: 4/5 (Friendly) Value: 3.5/5  Repeat: Perhaps. It is a great brunch spot for locals."}
{"text":"Had a Nonna Pizza: it was thin crust, which was great, but the ingredients were cut so thin and at almost 19$, I was disappointed that two inches all around the pizza was crust only, with almost no tomato sauce.  This experience was 'meh' from a food perspective; not interesting at all. The service was friendly, the patio very nice, calm, and clean (and the washrooms were fine as well). The interior of the restaurant looked lovely as well. Perhaps I ordered the wrong thing? I might return, but would be more careful about what I order.  Seeing other reviews afterwards, it seems many items are boring and uninspired."}
{"text":"My first review and I'm not a picky diner. My issue is the service and food handling and I'm usually pretty relaxed about that.  Most important, the serving staff handled and cut each piece of bread and cut slices handling each piece without even using a napkin to protect for cross contamination. They do not have running water and they will handle credit cards and touch your food without a second thought  Other service, the pizza's arrived  at different times within 15 minutes of each other until the waitress explained that the final pizza was burnt.. Even with the bad service and food quality issue.  I would would have given 2 stars. The food handling should be brought to the attention of the health board.  Do not eat here until they clean up their act. This is not a BS review, it's a serious problem with this restaurant."}
{"text":"Yummy quality food and friendly atmosphere. Been in for brunch, lunch and dinner. Enjoyed each visit, all had dependable elements as well as small, welcome surprises. Could improve the bread basket, though.  It's not grand or memorable, but a solid and pleasurable neighbourhood restaurant.  We appreciate the menu, yet the features are really where the food shines. Some of the pastas are rather heavy and much more appealing in the winter months. Wine list is understated and just enough selection.  Lovely spot."}
{"text":"Cute place for brunch!  Checked this place out for Mother's Day brunch this year. We required reservations but I suspect on a normal day that you could get a table without them. There are a variety of seating options from small round café tables to rectangular bar height tables and two small patios one on Yonge and one on Glebe. It was raining quite hard when we went for lunch so we couldn't take advantage of the outdoor space but it looks like it could be great for people watching.  Our server was very pleasant and efficient. Water was on our table shortly after we got there and we were immediately offered coffees. Food offerings were pretty standard for brunch with an Italian bent. The pizzas smelled great but we were more there for breakfast foods. I got the eggs Benedetto. The hollandaise was nice and the eggs were poached perfectly. I had high hopes for the duck fat potatoes. They were fine but nothing exceptional. Portions are large... Benedetto came with pancetta. About 100 pieces of it! I couldn't eat all of it bc it made the dish too salty.  The French toast looked great with the macerated berries on top --another huge portion!  Nice atmosphere, great staff, above average food."}
{"text":"Such a cozy restaurant with good portion sizes and great food selection! Their zucchini soup is AMAZINGGGG! It's so healthy because it's pretty much just pureed zucchini with seasoning but it tastes so smooth and creamy. Loved having brunch there and will definitely return in the near future :D"}
{"text":"How this place stays in business, that is a mystery. Been there 4 times, cause I live very close and on Mondays lots of good places  close. Terribly slow service.....so so food....the cook had to come out and serve us since the waitress was lost....wake up Toronto,,,, elsewhere this place would have been history...."}
{"text":"Disappointed in service. He had to be the friendliest dishwasher but server he was not. On previous visits, greeted and served by a very professional and polished young man. This time the server had a baseball cap, untrimmed beard, and long shop-worn apron and didn't understand the protocol. Looks like it won't be long until last pizza is served. Too bad, good pizza, reasonable location, but good staffing is a KPI - Key performance indicator."}
{"text":"It's almost there. Just missing that little bit and it's there. Their pasta could have been al dante. Their pizza could have been less burnt. It was just so close."}
{"text":"Meh. Went with the hubs for dinner last night. The first thing I noticed was the smoke filling the restaurant. The rear door was open and you could literally see smoke billowing out of the place. Supposedly, the pizza oven is 'temperamental'. So we all had to eat with the stench of burnt pizza crust filling our nostrils. By the end of the meal I couldn't wait to get out of there. Service was poor. The server was the most hyper girl I have ever met..when she made it to our table. Somehow the service was slooooooow even though they had 3 servers covering the small restaurant. How does that happen? Maybe because the setup of the place is ridiculous. The pizzas come from another kitchen downstairs so the servers were constantly running up and down the stairs from the basement to the first floor to bring pizzas, bread etc up. I actually felt bad for them. The food: I had the beet salad (felt like a light meal) and hubs had a pasta, house made, with meat ragu. We shared the burrata.  The crusty bread that comes first was amazing. Yum! Burrata was yummy but minuscule. Really? It was about 3oz. Tiny. Burrata should be served big enough so that it can be broken open and the luscious soft middle comes out. Then you can scoop it up with bread/toasts. Wasn't happening here. Disappointed. The beet salad was great - a bit bland though. Nice mix of of purple, pink, and golden beets, with a chunk of creamy goat cheese on top. Some arugula with balsamic and olive oil dressing was beneath the beets. I could have used some toasted walnuts or pine nuts. Y husband had the pasta with ragu - the pasta (I forget the Italian name for it) was a unique shape - sort of like dried peach halves - but tasted like it was raw dough. Seriously - I like weir textures and doughy stuff so I liked it, but that stuff was raw. It was chewy and doughy. I have no idea how he ate most of it. The ragu was tasty. We had no dessert, but the ones on the menu looked good.. Overall, there are much better restaurant in the city. I don't need to go back to asphyxiate for mediocre food at Lil Baci."}
{"text":"We went here on a Friday night and it wasn't too busy. We were able to get a table for 4 on the patio right away.  My friend got their via verde cocktail with rosemary, mint, basil, lime, sparkling water, and gin. It was quite refreshing and a perfect summer drink.   We ordered the piccolo de misto to start, which is their antipasto platter. Chef's choice of two cured meats, one cheese, pickles, and olives. Our plate arrived without any olives. I don't know what happened - did they run out, or forget to put them on the plate? Either way, what is an antipasto without olives? The portions were also quite small for what it costs. A few pieces of cured meats and a few small slices of buffalo mozzarella is not worth $18.   Spaghetti Nero was sold out for the evening, so my friend opted for their calamari and octopus appetizer and a vegetable salad. My other friend ordered the Marco pizza, my fiancé ordered the rigatoni with lamb bolognese, and I ordered the rigatoni mezze.   Of the four of us, only my fiancé was happy with his lamb pasta. The octopus and calamari appetizer was average (but the calamari was very tender), the salad was overpriced, considering it was just an average sized bowl of sliced vegetables tossed in olive oil and lemon juice. My friend who got the pizza was looking forward to Italian style pizza and he was not impressed with what he got. There was no sauce on his pizza and the toppings weren't generous. My rigatoni mezze was average. It said on the menu that there was mascarpone, but I didn't notice any. I also don't know how I feel about corn in a pasta. It seems like it doesn't belong.   Service was average. Not friendly, but we got everything we wanted in a timely manner.   There are so many other amazing restaurants in the area. We won't be going back here for a while."}
{"text":"I came here for weekend brunch with a friend and will definitely be back!  1) The food was very reasonably priced - most meals being around $12 2) The menu was traditional enough to fulfill the brunch craving, yet had enough unique twists to be interesting. 3) Everything we ordered was absolutely delicious.  4) The server was very attentive and friendly.  5) Although we did not sit on the patio, it is a great summer feature! 6) The vibe is laid back, welcoming and relaxed - something I enjoy first thing on a Sunday morning  I have nothing critical to say - this place filled all my great-brunch criteria!"}
{"text":"The service was so slow...took an hour for 1 pizza and baked eggs to come out? Portions were very small, not that tasty and everything overpriced.  I doubt I'll be going back. Sigh. I'm so tired with the mediocrity of restaurants in this city!"}
{"text":"My friends and I were looking for a brunch spot that could take a reservation for a group of 10.  Not easy to find in the Yonge & Eg area, but Lil Baci worked out well for us.  In fact, our group grew to 12, and our server, Keenan, happily added another table to accommodate us.      I can't say enough good things about Keenan. A party of 12 is always a handful, particularly when there are only two servers in the whole restaurant, but he was very patient with us and made great recommendations for our food.    The most popular dishes for our group were the Eggs Benedetto and the Baked Eggs Baci style, but everyone enjoyed their meals.  I was also impressed that all 12 of us were served within 5 minutes of each other.  Again, with a huge group, I was prepared for half of us to be served while the others had to wait for the kitchen to prepare the other half, so this was a nice surprise.  The only slight negatives to the experience were 1. a few of the coffee cups looked like they didn't get as clean as they should have in the dishwasher, but again, Keenan quickly took them away and replaced them with clean cups, and 2. they ran out of drip coffee after about 15 minutes.  However, we were offered Americanos instead at no extra charge, so I was perfectly content."}
{"text":"Lunched here recently. Salad and pizza.  Taste, presentation and quality - boring and mediocre. Many better choices in  the area."}
{"text":"Great spot for brunch. The dishes are delicious. Never had baked eggs before ( ordered Melanazaba!) and it's a refreshing take on omelette style brunch. I highly recommend. Great coffee and very personable staff. Prices super moderate -- will come back"}
{"text":"We've eaten at most (if not all) of the Italian joints around Yonge and Eglinton and Lil Baci has become our favourite. The had a few options of true gluten free foods and the kitchen was very helpful with washing down the station and hands etc. The wine list is a little underwhelming but the food is always tasty and the service is usually on point. It's a good, reasonably priced spot and I think you'll enjoy it!"}
{"text":"A cosy little Italian restaurant. My friend enjoyed her thin crust fungi pizza. The duck pappardelle with mushrooms was very flavourful. Portion was relatively smaller compared to similar places. The cauliflower and brussel sprouts were delicious!   Desserts were decent . Not overly sweet.  Service was good.   A nice choice."}
{"text":"Cute venue with a rustic looking sidewalk patio and convenient location near the Davisville subway station, but lacking in that \"wow\" factor when it comes to the flavors and presentation of the food.   Food- 3/5. No complimentary bread... Sad :'( Came here for dinner on a Sunday since having mad cravings for Italian and this place showed up as being pretty well regarded for its pizzas. We ordered the Nonna (roasted red peppers, roasted eggplant, fresh arugula with EVOO, I asked for no cheese) and Margherita pizzas - both vegetarian. The pizzas are thin crust with a bubbly slightly charred rim, which was so-so. The burnt bits were really bitter and the crust dough in general was nothing special. You might think I'm crazy, but sometimes the pizza crust itself tastes SO DELICIOUS - chewy, slightly sour and yeasty, aromatic... Just perfection. Unfortunately the pizza dough at Lil Baci was not like this. My partner, who loves Italian food and eats 100000x more pizza than I ever do, thought the pizzas were mediocre at best. He rates them 3.5/5 stars lol  Note - pretty vegetarian friendly (at least 1 veg option for apps, pizza, and pasta, sandwiches), but not so vegan friendly since lots of cream and cheeses. My cheese-less pizza (by request) was pretty listless tbh.  Value - 2/5. Mains are over $16. For only 2 pizzas and no alcohol we dropped $50 tonight. Desserts are all $9 and they only have 1 vegan option, the sorbet, which comes in only 1 flavor (tonight was kiwi). Save your cash and instead go down the street to the gelato place please.  Service- 4/5. Our waiter was nice and professional, but kind of aloof and slow. It's not his fault though because he had to service a lot of customers by himself. Food took about 15 minutes to come.  Venue- 4/5. Hipster interior, cute sidewalk patio. Not too crowded or loud, so perfect for larger groups (might want to reserve in advance). Very casual, no need to dress up (it's not one of THOSE Italian restaurants).   Probably won't be back again."}
{"text":"We love coming back to this place for brunch. The food is great and the portions are perfect. The deserts are fantastic and the service just brings a smile to your face.   The interiors are cosy with about 15 tables and a nice view of the street.   My favorite dish here is the lil baci baked eggs. Also recommend the mushroom baked eggs too. Among the deserts, my favorite is the Carmelo mud pie.   The pricing is reasonable - not cheap but no crazy expensive.   Will recommend for brunch."}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place as it is close to my house. Was extremely disappointed with the service.   Ordered the steak medium rare and when it came to the table it was clearly well done. Told the waitress, who then came back to our table and tried to tell us in an exasperated tone that it was medium rare. She then said if we wanted it changed we would have to wait a long time because there was a big party next to us. She then brought it to the table without saying a word. Numerous times we had to ask her to help refill the water or bring salt and pepper because she was ignoring our table. Extremely rude and short. Worst server I have had in a long time.   Food was okay. Service terrible.  Won't come back again"}
{"text":"Food was good, let's get that part straight but I would not return. Although our server was nice she was inattentive to my older parents. The younger people at the table were kept hydrated but my father asked for a cup of coffee three times and never got it. All the food came out at once but my parents was 10m later, why? they burnt the first pizza. Well my pizza was partially burnt, why did they not redo mine? In addition the waiters, while cutting bread were holding the bread with their bare hands. I joked they cut the bread then run their hands through their hair, and guess what she did, yes and then cut more bread. This is basic hygene, the best food in the world is not enjoyed when we see servers risking cross contanimation on customer's food."}
{"text":"What the hack! Piece of plastic came from pizza. sever were so friendly. but i have no idea their kitchen is clean"}
{"text":"I am a fan of the original neighbourhood eatery. This new location I stumbled into shares the growing Yonge&Eg crowd with the fresh Italian goodness Leslievillians have known.  Familiar Lil' Baci fares with the familiar fresh Lil' Baci goodness also to be had here. Decently priced, too. Their pizzas are always good and flavourful--I am a sucker for pizza with a healthy savoury dose of tomato sauce, and even here they don't disappoint. Add to that a large front outdoor patio, and this place ought to be a midtown hit if it isn't one already.  I enjoyed my BLT sandwich. The bacon, much like the bread it is stuffed in, was nicely crispy. Much like the ambiance of this bright and classy location.  {TTC: Southeast corner Yonge and Glebe E., a short couple blocks walk north of Davisville subway station. There might--key word: might--be free parking on the side streets or behind the building.}"}
{"text":"Have been here twice. Once for breakfast and once for lunch.  Definitely a good meal but doesn't blow you away.  Nice selection of unique drinks are cool.   Appetizers really nice.  Great meatballs (if a little small).  The pizza was good if not a little too thin and soggy.  I like my pizza to hold itself.    All in all we live close and will likely be back."}
{"text":"We went to the Yonge location for dinner this evening and won't be going back.  The service was pretentious and slow.  The food was expensive, slow and luke warm. Over $100 for dinner for 2 adults and 2 kids and no alcohol.  When I went to the bar area near the kitchen to pay my bill, (because I had wasted enough of my evening already) the floor in the kitchen was filthy.  This was at about 7 before the dinner rush began.   I make better food at home for much less money."}
{"text":"Had dinner here for the first time a couple of days ago. My dining companion and I both just recently moved to the area, so we are checking out spots in our new 'hood. She arrived before I did, and was already seated with a drink. I sat down and we started chatting, catching up on what's been happening since we last saw each other back in Vancouver.   About 10 minutes into the conversation, I realized that our server hadn't been by our table since I arrived and I was really craving a bevvie. Finally someone came by to take our order, and we both ordered pizza and drinks.  She had a glass of wine and I chose a nut brown ale, as I'm hoping to discover some new local brews. This is the downside to beer drinking: when you have favourites in your hometown, you need to start over finding new faves in your new city. Oh, wait... that's probably an upside - trying lots of new beers! Anyways, on to the food...  I ordered the Funghi pizza with mushrooms, taleggio and truffle oil and my friend had the Pappa pizza with prosciutto, mozzarella and arugula. Both were delicious. She managed to finish her entire pizza, but I had to wrap my leftovers when I threw in the towel after eating 3/4 of it. It made for an excellent breakfast the next morning, though!   Service was slow, and there wasn't much for follow-up until we were done, but we didn't really need anything after we got our food and drinks so it was fine. This place is a bit on the pricier side for a casual eatery, but I'll probably return seeing as how I live in the area and I love pizza! Would also like to try their tiramisu..."}
{"text":"We want to thank Lil' Baci for everything they did for our wedding--the service you and your staff provided was perfect--the food was delicious, and the guests enjoyed it very much; the lemon-vodka shot was quite memorable, and the atmosphere and setting was picturesque for what we wanted.  Lil' Baci will be our special place, and we hope to frequent it soon enough in the future."}
{"text":"Finally tried this cute lil Italian cafe for lunch and was impressed!  Excellent pizza with great flavours and crispy crust. Polpette appetizer (meatballs) tasted homemade. Beet salad with goat cheese and aged balsamic was lovely...kale salad with ricotta was dynamite.  For dessert....affogato with coconut ice cream; panacotta with \"ruptured blueberries\"...all good.  As I said, I was impressed and I'll definitely be back. Bonus: plenty of outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Update: I am now obsessed with this place. The secret is in the meatballs.. Those delicious meatballs!! Oooooo mama"}
{"text":"I went to the Yonge location for Winterlicious dinner with my friend. First time here and the restaurant looked very trendy and hipster. There was a complimentary appetizer of bread with olive oil, which is a classic Italian appetizer. However, I found the crust of the bread to be a bit too hard. The appetizers we ordered were the kale salad with fennel, radish, red onion and ricotta salata. I found the kale to be very oily, but I liked the cheese that was sprinkled on top of the salad and the radish and fennel went well with the kale. As for our main courses, I had trofie pasta with kale, pesto and pecorino. The pasta was in bite sizes rather than a long string of pasta. Never had this kind of pasta in my life. My friend ordered osso buco with red wine risotto. I thought it was delicious. For dessert, I ordered caramelo chocolate mud pie and my friend ordered apple crumble with creme Anglais. I thought they were wonderful desserts, tasted as good as I expected. I would give that five stars and the main courses and appetizers four stars.  As for service however, I felt there was a lack of, but I wouldn't say they were unfriendly. Rather aloof and unattentive. Didn't even introduce themselves when first taking our order and didn't really check on us. Never poured water for us, we did it for ourselves. There was more than one waiter serving us, so I didn't even know who I was tipping exactly. In a way it wasn't too big of a deal 'cause if my dining partner and I have a lot to talk about, I'd prefer service to bother us less.. but not completely no service either if you know what I mean. I'd go again in the future, wonder if the Queen location is better."}
{"text":"So a friend and I were in the area and decided to stop into Lil Baci, having noticed it several times in the past. It just so happened that Summerlicious was still going at the time, but I wasn't hungry enough for a three-course meal, so I just ordered the \"Classic meatballs al forno,\" which is three meatballs served in a small dish.  I will admit that these meatballs were quite tasty. The sauce, which is just tomatoes, basil, and parmesan, was extremely tasty and quite plentiful. The meatballs themselves were essentially falling apart, which would've been weird if I had gotten the pasta but on their own it was fine.  The problem was, though, that my dining companion ordered from the Summerlicious menu and two out of three of her items were essentially inedible. She started with the Seafood Panzella, which is a salad that's described thusly: \"marinated shrimp, octopus, calamari, red peppers, black olives, tomato, arugula, capers, house made bread.\" In theory, this should've been quite tasty. In execution, however, the salad was overpowered by vinegar - to the point where nothing else could be tasted. The bread was fairly soggy, too, indicating that the salad had been made *much* earlier in the day.  Her next course was the Rigatoni Amatriciana, which is described as \"pancetta, red onion, white wine, tomato sauce, parsley, pecorino.\" I'm generally not one to complain about the saltiness of dishes, but we both found this dish overpowered by salt. Perhaps it was the combination of pancetta and pecorino or the chef employed a heavy hand with his/her salt shaker, but neither of us were able to eat more than a few bites of this dish.  Finally, dessert, which was the Cherry Panna Cotta. I will admit I found this very tasty; the panna cotta itself was very creamy and rich, while the cherry topping, which also contained hints of dark chocolate, complemented it perfectly. (My dining companion, perhaps soured by the lackluster first and second course, didn't care too much for it, unfortunately.)  All in all, a fairly terrible experience. We shan't be returning."}
{"text":"Last visit was out last visit!  Service was the worst I have had in Toronto in a long while.  Called to make reservations, twice for a party of 8.  No return confirmation and they had no idea we were coming - so no tables were prepared.  Had one wait person on.  Had to set up our own tables, pour our own water.....When the food finally arrived, everything was there but a pizza.  We were then told they were having problems with the pizza oven (should have told us before ordering).  Too many options in the neighbourhood to wast another minute here.  Zero Stars not an option or I would have chosen this."}
{"text":"This cozy neighbourhood restaurant has a delicious Italian comfort food menu. The only downside is everything is insanely salty. The flavours are wonderful and bold but the salt level kills it. I loved the texture of my pappardelle but couldn't finish it. The meatballs were big and tasty but again overly salty couldn't finish it. I think they definitely need to tone down on the salt then voila! Perfect!"}
{"text":"I love the food here!!!  We live close and come here often, the me u is small but the food is delicious!!! I would mainly recommend it for brunch .  This place is very close to the Davisville subway , great for groups and family. Try their duck fat fries and frittata.   Price is little on the higher end ."}
{"text":"Good but not the greatest. We waited awkwardly by the black curtain to be seated. We were seated right in front of the entrance which was freezing at times when the door opened. Tables were tiny.Servers are very  nice but there was a lot of crashing into each other,dropping cutlery or breaking dishes. Not good from a presentation or customer perspective. On a good note, desserts were fab and flavorful, the fish was great and pasta well made.  To me this is good for brunch or pre-movie dinner spot with a group of friends. Not a date night spot.Overpriced. 110$ for 2? May as well go to CN Tower and at least get a nice view of the City! I'd rather even spend that at La Coquine where service is great and live band music is playing.  6.5 out of 10."}
{"text":"Food is 10-15% more expensive than it should be Cocktails are good and well priced Taste is 4 star and service is 4 star Will only come back if no other options near by"}
{"text":"Winterlious menu was great, started with the meatballs, well seasoned juicy and tender. My girlfriend had the caesar, light dressing was nice because most are over dressed and leave the salad rather soggy but that was not the case and I loved addition of radicchio giving a nice bitter bite. Mains were ribs on mash and salmon on fennel arugula salad with faro. Ribs were sweet and fall off the bone tender and went perfectly with the mash and honey on the plate, very winning combo.  Salmon was also very nice, olives and capers provide a nice briny bite with the salmon. Desserts were panna cotta and maple bread pudding. Panna cotta was beautifully light and the candied orange provided great texture with the smooth creamy vanilla and a great pistachio to add to this winner, bread pudding was also very nice crisp bread with a custardy inside toasted walnuts throughout and the perfect level of sweetness from the maple syrup.  Only was $25 per person for all of this great food all made in house, they are really bringing there game for lious and it shows. This level of quality and care for 25 dollars can't be beat and the portions are generous so arrive hungry.  Hats off to the chef!"}
{"text":"Lil Baci is one of the newer restaurants in the yonge and davisville area, seems always busy, so last night we decided on trying it out. We where seated in the back of the restaurant which I did not mind but it was really close to the staff rest room and the kitchen, which at times got really smoky and we left smelling like cooked food, I think they need better fans at this restaurant. We had the marinated olives to start ,where great little starter. I had the duck balls which where good but been better in a tomato sauce I think. My friend had the seafood salad, she said  it was okay and didn't finish it. For our mains we had the ragu with polenta, it was a big hit with us. All and all it was a okay place for food , service was slow at times.  I would try it one more time I think. I hear brunch is good at this place."}
{"text":"i was psyched about trying this place but it's much like all the other little trendoid \"authentic\" italian cafes.  there were a few choices i viewed on the on-line menu that i was interested in and this is why i chose lil' baci.  when we arrived at 3ish, we were told they were no longer offering their brunch menu (fine) and that we'd have the \"lunch\"  menu.  again, fine.  then it was the \"late lunch\" menu--which was a limited version of the lunch menu.  um...okay.  and then, we were told this was actually the \"late lunch\" menu from the other lil' baci location and they didn't have all of the pizzas listed.  so i picked a pizza.  oh, yeah, they don't have that one now either.  my bf picked a pizza.  nope, they don't have the rapini ready til 5pm.  2 cheese pizzas it is!  bottom line:  options were 3 salads and 4 pizzas.  whatever.    main points:  *cheese pizza had 6 small circles of mozz. *water bottles on tables are nice if you drink a lot of water.  but i don't pay to come out to eat to fill my own 4oz. water glass every 5 mins. *stark wine selection *interesting house cocktails *gave a comped dessert for the birthday guest! *server starting her shift styled her hair in the dining room mirror, put on her apron, and then brought drinks to a table.  (gross.) *if you don't put salt & pepper shakers on the table because you \"offer\" fresh-ground--great!  then actually \"offer\" it.  don't make customer flag down server to ask for pepper mill.   *$8 for a dessert that came in a baby food jar (literally) *interesting vegetarian options on the menu  *none of the aforementioned \"interesting vegetarian options\" available to order *great prices on drinks during cocktail hour (4pm-6pm i think)  wished we had dropped $120 somewhere else :("}
{"text":"Never disappointed with Lil Baci, We've been to both locations several times and is my new local favourite.  Brunch is great and a comfortable place to bring a group of friends."}
{"text":"This is a review for takeout only.   Tried their Margherita pizza, classic meatballs, Butcher's son chicken, and charred Brussels sprouts. Unfortunately, it was a bipolar experience.  Meatballs were delicious and had a wonderful texture, served in a delicious marinara sauce. And the Butcher's son Chicken was the highlight of our meal, impeccably roasted with a delicious, scrumptious sauce. By far the dish of the night for us.   However, the pizza was burnt. Now, let me be clear, I love Neapolitan style pizza, and usually, one can expect a level of char to the crust that adds to the experience - it is, in my opinion, necessary for a proper pizza. Both of the two we ordered were burnt to the point that the crust was not enjoyable. My partner could not finish hers, and this is after countless other Neapolitan-style pizza deliveries from other restaurants where our usual complaint is, if anything, undercooked pizza. Worse, the crust had no flavour.  A good crust made from proper 00 flour and salted and dressed with olive oil then cooked to perfection is a delicacy all on its own - but this was not that. Burnt and bland made the pizzas the standout losers for the night for us. I can only hope dine-in guests get a better experience, and a better pizza.   The Brussels sprouts were under seasoned. Some salt made them edible if not enjoyable. A shame, too, as they were otherwise roasted to perfection.   In short, I'd recommend Lil' Baci - but not for the pizza. Try other options on their menu. Our area is becoming a great area at other restaurants if your goal is Neapolitan style pizza."}
{"text":"Lil Baci was a really nice little restaurant around Yonge and Davisville. Our vegetarian friend brought us here. I had the tonno e fagioli salad for appetizer ($15) and the rigatoni with pork and beef ragu ($20). Both were delicious. Our server was very friendly and helpful.   We ordered bread and there was olive oil on the table but no other condiments. Our server brought us some balsamic vinegar when we asked. There was no parmesan or pepper but the food really didn't need it. The pasta was so good, I would definitely visit again. Our friends ordered some vegetarian dishes. I tried a bite of their mushroom pizza and it was very good but I liked my pasta better. The price is on the higher side of my budget but the portions were the perfect size and the food and atmosphere were great. I would definitely recommend bringing a date here."}
{"text":"I was here for a media event so everything was comped. Opinions, as always are honest. Lil Baci is changing up its image from a pizzeria in Leslieville to a family style Itailan gathering place midtown with more options on the menu (including veggie friendly options). I got a chance to taste many of the delicious things on the menu.   VIBE  I love that there is a place like this that is mid-market uptown. It's located between Eglinton and Davisville but closer to Davisville.   The place reminds me of Sliced, actually. It's sleek and sophisticated with its white tiled walls and marble countertops but open and inviting with its floor to ceiling windows letting in a lot of light. I love the lighting here as well.   If you get a chance to meet Mark Baci, you should be delighted! He is one saucy minx. A charmer, for sure.   WE ATE  Oh, we ate! A lot. I'll mention things that were particularly memorable to me:   -The Beets - three kinds of beets in colour served with buratta. Are you kidding me?! Amazing. I could have eaten the whole dish by myself. This was a favourite across the board. That said, I felt at $18 it was a LOT expensive for an app but we were only getting a portion of it. I also understand how expensive buratta is. If you are in a group, get this.  -The funghi pizza (which you can also get at Lil Baci in Leslieville). I love me some mushrooms dripped in truffle oil.  -The pan roasted heritage chicken breast was moist and flavourful with drippings of olive oil, and topped with tomato and kalamata olives on the side. Rustic. Love.  -The people on my side of the table loved the pappardelle with duck ragu. It was hearty.  -The toscano style chicken liver mousse was decadent and rich. If you like a strong taste, this is a good bet. It's one of those things that can become addictive quickly.  -the desserts were also a big hit. ---mason jars, etc    OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  Get your lil baci over here pronto. I hope this is a big hit in the neighbourhood. Again, much needed and I think it's a perfect spot for a group dinner or birthday dinner (they have a big table in the back as well to cater to a group).   A note: in August, they will be serving sandwiches in the back of the resto called \"Lil' Wich.\" (meatball, cold fried chicken, etc) for $4. You'll also be able to get a soup, salad and drink for $10. Great value and excited to check it out when that opens.   It's nice to see exciting things happening Midtown.  AND PS I went back and had the beets and buratta; the asparagus salad and the pappardelle with duck. All made for a light and refreshing lunch, which was shared. Service was very attentive. Definitely my new spot in the Yonge and Eg area."}
{"text":"The 2 of us came here on labour day Monday for brunch. We made a reservation for noon and were seated right away. We decided to sit out on the patio in the front. Not a lot of seating out there (fits maybe 6 people total) but it was perfect for us.   Good selection of drinks to choose from including wines but we went with prosecco because as my dining companion so eloquently put it: \"why the hell not?\"  Great choices on the menu. It was a tough decision but our waitress was incredibly helpful and we decided to go with the poached eggs ($11) which came with salad and duck fat potatoes (hollandaise on the side) and I ordered the tonno sandwich $11) on their housemade bread: tuna, sundried tomatoes, capers, arugula and olives. I asked to sub the mixed salad with their beet salad (additional 3 bucks) and so glad I did because it was so delicious! The bread was so amazing. Nice and soft...perfect chewiness...And the olive oil they used in the sandwich was heavenly. The flavours of that sandwich were so perfect, especially with the saltiness of the capers and olives...mmmm...  My friend seemed to really enjoy her eggs but one of them was a little overlooked...poached eggs gotta be runny!  If you are in the yonge and eglinton area, definitely check it out for brunch. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I came to Lil' Baci on Yonge for brunch with a friend and had a lovely time. I had eggs benedict on spinach and flatbread and she had a margherita pizza. My meal was delicious and filling. My friend thought her pizza was a bit overcooked though. Server was really nice and even ran down the street to return my friend's phone after she accidentally left it behind. Cute little spot and I'll be back to try dinner at some point."}
{"text":"Lunch BLT was delicious! The salad was also very good, just a tad salty. Arugula was in the place of the L. I much prefer arugula to lettuce so this was awesome. Also the T was roasted. And the B was pancetta I think, if I read the menu properly. It definitely tasted different. Served on house-made ciabatta (?). Very delicious. Quite a variation on the BLT but for the better. $13.  For dessert I got the warm nutmeg sponge cake with roasted peaches, dulce de leche and vanilla ice cream. Quite tasty. I think I'll try the panna cotta next time, which was the waitress' favourite.  Service was quick and friendly. Patio is very cute with nice wooden tables.  Bonus: free still Q water! And $3 for one serving of sparkling or $5 for unlimited sparkling. Q water is awesome and more places should do it. It definitely enhances every dining experience.  I came here after trying out some Muay Thai at TKMT and I definitely wouldn't mind making this a routine stop after my workouts!"}
{"text":"This was quite nice.  I had the duck meatballs with poached eggs.  Delicious.  It was a bit loud (too many crying babies on a Sunday morning for me) and a little smoky for some reason but the food and service made up for it.  We had a couple of drinks and the check was about $50."}
{"text":"Very good and flavorful food, however it was over salted. Dessert was great as a part of the Summerlicious special but entirely too expensive on its own. Great patio and ambiance."}
{"text":"I have been going to the Yonge Street Lil' Baci location since it opened in 2012.  I use to rave about their food to everyone .. and got very excited when i saw on their website that they had a membership w/ benefits for those who are \"loyal and regular customers,\" called  \"Lil' Baci Social Club,\"  as I felt I am a \"loyal and regular customer.\"   About a month ago, when I phoned the restaurant to inquire if they do take away & asked about this loyalty program, the gentleman said all you have to do is come into the restaurant & ask them for it & they will give it to you.  When i came the following week for some pizza with my sister, and inquired again about the loyalty program, the waitress stated that in order to become a member of the loyalty program you have to be \"like family\" and it is given to those who host private events at their restaurant.  I was extremely disappointed by this statement; for over the last 3yrs i have visited the restaurant about once every other month .. for brunch & dinner ... one would think that would justify myself as being a regular customer.  But it does NOT.  And it has now deterred me from wanting to revisit them again any time soon.  And now I have commented to my friends and neighbors.  I feel it is False Advertising; and should either be removed from their website.  Or they should offer it to everyone, as that will encourage patrons of the Yonge Eglington/Davisville Neighborhood to visit their restaurant more frequently.  Thus increasing sales, as opposed to loosing them."}
{"text":"3.75  Was hesitant of this place since reading some reviews.  Seems to be mostly of their brunch.  But I had dinner here instead.   Very friendly staff and helpful regarding allergies etc.  I love thin crust pizza and this was good. AND it wasnt soggy in the middle like some thin crust pizzas I've had from a popular chain-ish trendy place that has about 3 locations in the city... ahem.  The sauce was generous (hate dry pizza) and it wasnt too tart or too salty, nor did it skim on the toppings. Just right! Had a taste of the soup du jour - a bit spicy but yummy.  Had a bit of the origional meatball Baci stuff was good - a bit too soft for my liking but others said it was really good. Generous portions of this stuff. Pasta tasted ok as well - but only had a tiny taste of that so can't fully review.  Ambiance and decor was great - love the rustic look and candle light. Surprisingly lots of room  inside beyond what you see from the street.  Great for a date. And surprisingly for a Monday night was pretty busy!!  Good over all."}
{"text":"I had this place bookmarked and finally made it there and well , I'm disappointed. The menu isn't that exciting and You don't think you could go wrong with pizza but what a wrong assumption. It may not be the worst pepperoni pizza I had, but for the place and the price , you expect way more ."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times in the past & enjoyed the experience. However, last evening I definitely felt things have changed - & not for the better. My husband's pasta (rigatoni mezze) arrived lukewarm & was cool by the time he passed the last of it over to me. It was bland in taste & runny in consistency. Not at all the tummy warming, rich dish the menu described. The wine list is wildly overpriced for the calibre of restaurant. The service was just adequate."}
