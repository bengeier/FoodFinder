{"text":"Love love love! Anything that offers half priced happy hours, I'm down.com. The new owner is fab and friendly, and answered all of our questions with a smile. Try the stout cupcake! Def will be back."}
{"text":"I went on friday afternoon, they were almost sold out of 400 cupcakes (the lady at the counter told us)!.  Must be good right?  They were good.  We got 3- jack and coke-vanilla, and chocolate.  I would say the best i've had in pittsburgh--so thats good right!  A little pricey though--"}
{"text":"I'm a vegan and I visited Pittsburgh for two days for a conference at Carnegie Mellon. I searched on Happy Cow for anything in the nearby area where I could eat and nothing came up. I dropped by old stand by, Starbucks, and was pleasantly surprised to see a cupcake store next to Starbucks that featured a different vegan cupcake every day! So exciting. I went in for a cupcake and was equally excited to see a vegan wrap featured as well. I bought both the cupcake and wrap and was happy with both. The wrap didn't look good - but tasted great. I checked out their website later and was pleased to see they also had a vegan brunch option and some vegan cookies on the  menu. I wasn't in town long enough to go back. I tried adding Dozen to Happy Cow so other veggies could find them, but couldn't add them since they also serve roast beef. Oh well. If you're looking for a good cupcake and veggie wrap, I recommend Dozen."}
{"text":"While a few of the cupcakes (namely the standard flavors) feel a bit overpriced for their quality, many the specialty flavors are fantastic. 

Their unique flavors like the East End Stout, Cosmo, or Elvis are really where Dozen's cupcakes become worth the money.  As other reviewers have said, the flavors rotate daily, so that can be frustrating if they're serving your favorite flavor on an inconvenient day. On the other hand, it's nice to try and explore all the different flavors this shop sells (but seriously Dozen, sell the Cosmo one everyday). They do sell other baked goods, but the cupcakes are the stars of Dozen.

If you have some money burning a hole in your pocket, these novelty cupcakes might be worth a try."}
{"text":"CUPPPPPCAAAAAKKKKEEESSSS!

I love cupcakes! Dozen has cupcakes! YAYYYYY! I have tried several of their cupcakes. You have to make sure to go on the right day, because the menu is always changing, but right now the Thursday carmel corn is delish AND it has REAL CORN. NOM NOM NOM

Also, they have these peanut butter/chocolate/corn flake things that are $3 and the size of my head, they are the best thing ever in my opinion, but a little melty on a hot day. 

Sometimes they have fluffy filled pastries too, they are pretty good and usually have fresh fruit on top. 

The coffee is good too..

OH and they have doggie muffins... Donno how they taste, but gotta love the dog love!"}
{"text":"Haven't given into my sweet tooth enough to know how consistent the quality is. One negative/positive is that they rotate their flavors daily. Bad news is that your favorite flavor (um, Cosmopolitan cupcake?? PERFECTION!) is only served one day a week. Sigh. 

Liked the addition of light wraps and sandwiches (had a tofu wrap once which was good). 

Definitely a place you should try but if you're a cupcake connoisseur, you may know of better."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why the filtered review was filtered, but I almost agree with that review.  this review is for their cupcakes only.

dozen leaves a lot to be desired.  one of the main things behind opening a decent gourmet cupcake bakery is to create a great base for your cupcakes.  the cake portion of all 8 or 9 different varieties of cupcakes I've tried have been incredibly dry, more so than those I'd find at a supermarket. I find myself having to supplement the consumption of these cupcakes with a large glass of milk.

the second problem (and the only other component of a cupcake) is their frosting.  the frosting is much too airy and sugary.  again, much like the base, this dries the mouth out, and i have to drown out the taste of the cupcake/frosting with my glass of milk.

i typically compare the red velvets of the cupcake bakeries i try, since it's one of the more basic ones, and it's almost found at all gourmet cupcake bakeries.  my preference still lies with sprinkles.  although sprinkles' cupcakes are 75 cents more ($3.25 each), they have the most incredibly moist cake, along with the relatively thick and rich cream cheese frosting (on their red velvet).  if you find that you tried sprinkles, and actually preferred a cupcake to have a different consistency, then i invite you to try this place, just for comparison.

overall, the store layout is cute, along with the appearance of their cupcakes, and i have to admit that i have not tried their other baked goods. 

i do crave cupcakes (as i have a huge sweet tooth) pretty often; it's just unfortunate that this is the only location near school that i can frequent."}
{"text":"Another bakery featuring cupcakes that sound and look a lot better than they taste. Nothing too special here, and the varieties/flavors of the other baked goods here is pretty good but nothing extraordinary. 

I also tried their cinnamon buns, which I've heard good things about, but it was not worth the hype. They were somewhat dry and tasted alright. The frosting was good, but cream cheese frosting isn't really that hard to mess up. In short, a bit underwhelming and not really worth the money."}
{"text":"I stopped in here today at this Oakland location.
The gentleman behind the counter informed me that this Oakland location has been open since August 2010.

PROS:
FANTASTIC baked goods;
Reasonably priced;
Cute store;
Friendly Staff;
Offers Vegan products;
Offers specialty stuff and orders for \"cupcake trays\", etc.

CONS:
As of 2/22/11, they are still getting situated in this location, but otherwise, No Gripes!

Keep doing what you do, Dozen!  :)

I ordered the Cinnamon Roll, its huge and delish!
This cinnamon roll had a little tiny sign in front of it saying that it was a \"Favorite\" so, being new, I went for it and it was amazing!  At $3.00 you can tell that this little rolled up doughy peice of heaven is ALL homemade!
The swirl of icing on top is what really captured my eye, though!
This icing was creamy and sweet, but not too sweet!
It tasted as soft and creamy as it looked and, unlike other preservative laden grocery store confections, this icing was not the least bit hard or crusty as you dig into it with your fork!
This was just the right combination of sweet icing and doughy cinnamon goodness!
I highly recommend this one!  :)

I can't wait to go back and try more stuff!   :)"}
{"text":"The cupcakes here range from OK to pretty good, but that's about where my praise has to end.  The creative alternatives are full of near-misses (like the almost-good gourmet pop tarts), and some bakery standards are just plain disappointing.  The cinnamon buns are bland, rescued only by a slathering of cream cheese frosting, while the brownies are downright terrible.

As a source of cupcakes, Dozen is a little overpriced, though not bad.  But it lacks the versatility--as well as some basic competencies--needed to compete as a well-rounded \"Bake Shop.\""}
{"text":"The Elvis (peanut butter, banana, etc) is DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"Didn't know this place existed until a friend showed me. Going to go more often for sure especially for dates. Cute place to have them :)"}
{"text":"They should have never bothered reopening. Horrible pastries, atrocious workers, lackadaisical management."}
