{"text":"Its been more than an hour after given order. Still no food. Very poor service. Not even ask for water. Food was just ok."}
{"text":"I love this place!!!  They make the best Chicken tikka masala in the world . They use the freshest ingredients & the garlic nann is amazing !  Tess B."}
{"text":"Walking in what I first noticed was the dirty front windows and door. Next was the floor that looked to have been mopped, but not swept first. Next up was the dispassionate could care less that you bothered to walk through the door attitude by the owner/cashier. Seems it's standard operating procedure to push around the dirt since the table also had clearly been wiped down with a dirty cloth. Bathroom was the same condition. While I had zero confidence that I would escape without getting food poisoning, both the goat and beef dishes as well as naan and rice were quite delicious and we didn't get sick. Have to give Zam Zam a 1 star based on \"what would my girl think\". She would have definitely given this place a \"ah, I'll wait in the car.\" assessment.  Sorry Zam Zam. Clean up the place and just maybe crack a smile. You've got work to do."}
{"text":"From the moment we walked in the server was not happy. I ordered a few entr√©es the tikka masala was okay. The dal lentils tasted like dirty beans. Those are all things I wouldn't write a review for but What really pushed me away is when the server brought out sugar for my chai tea he didn't notice that the container for the sugar packets was full of ants which started to run out and on to the table. I waited around for the server to to check up on me. I was the only table there, but he didn't come back so I just walked out and will Never give them my business again."}
{"text":"I give this place four out of five stars because the food is very delicious! The restaurant is tidy and decorated traditional Far East with a trendy twist. I would have to say management isn't the friendliest but a simple hello and smile is all I need to pick up my food to go: ) If you feel like trying something new and authentic give this place a try. I do think there is something for everyone to enjoy: )"}
{"text":"They have renovated the place and is now clean and updated .. A little slow service but very good delicious food ! Try their chicken seekh kabab very tasty !"}
{"text":"First impressions:  The food is good. I found the curry  goat fatty. Trying the Curry Chicken this time. What leaves me with a bad taste in my mouth is the staleness of the staff. This is my second time here and the staff treats me more of like why are you here and less like we want your business please come dine with us. So this will be the last time I come here...from the feeling I get here I won't be missed. No big there are many awesome eats Arizona. I liked it most because it was within walking distance."}
{"text":"This place a diamond in rough for the meat lovers. Tandoori chicken is a must-have here. Unlike this place, most of the Indian restaurants use cream to make their curries rich and smoother. That's not how these dishes are traditionally made in the subcontinent.   The curries can be Litle oily at times, if you can see past that, it tastes quite authentic. I mostly order their Kadhai Chicken with garlic naan.   All in all, one of the few places in Phoenix metro area offering authentic indo/pak delicacies."}
{"text":"Let me tell you what you should try at this place. Goat Karahi (ask them to make it spicy and extra gravy) Mixed Grill platter CHicken karahi  I had some people who said this place doesnt have good food, what I like to tell is you will need to know what you order at this place or else you might not like the place and never come back and miss the awesome food I mentioned above. Donot try Biryani.  The place can hold quite a few people but its not too classy or anything. It is a simple place. Heads up order atleast 15 mins before you go. They take some time to bring food to the table."}
{"text":"Well. We walked in, got a table, and no one seemed to be overly concerned that we wanted to order. At all. Even when we stood by the counter. Even when we tried to ask the folks in the grocery section, they  just looked at us. Like aliens.  I'm pretty bummed bc it smelled delicious in there and we were gonna eat the hell out of their menu, but you know what?  You snooze, you lose."}
{"text":"I saw the owner who is the owner of Copper Kettle which had 2 branches ( Chandler and Tempe ). Tempe one is closed. They really cook well. There is a market just beside the restaurant where you can get meat and other Indo- Pak items. Rest rooms were clean. The only thing I did not like was ; size of food they serve in plates. You will definitely find more food in any other restaurant. However quality covers up the size. Finding good Info - Pak food is difficult out of India or Pakistan, here the food is tasty enough. Zamzam's ambiance is much better than Copper Kettle. I think in Apache Blvd ( Tempe ) they target university students so the ambiance is not attractive. You can go for gravy items and butter nan rather than kebabs."}
{"text":"Food was amazing. The only reason I am giving one star less is because the server was rude. I don't know what was wrong with him but he was total disrespectful towards us. I still recommend because food taste yummy"}
{"text":"This place has delicious authentic Indian food. I have been here twice and both times the food was very tasty. The service is usually average to slightly slow. I would recommend the following dishes: chicken biryani, chicken mahandi, and the chicken masala were all phenomenal."}
{"text":"So on a scale of 1-5 with 5 being amazing I will give this restaurant 1.75 for food and -10 for service. I may order take out from here if I am desperately craving Pakistani food but never ever ever ever going back to eat in."}
{"text":"By far one of the most unprofessional people I have ever come across! I called to find out if they had available a special kind of meat which the lady said they did. I told her that I was on my way to get some. It took me 20 mins to get there and she told me that she was sorry but she took an order and sold everything to another customer who apparently had still not picked up the order! I was very disappointed with the service I would never go there again!!!'"}
