{"text":"My cousin recommended that I try this place - she showed me pics of her dinner and it looked amazing!

Came here for a special anniversary dinner. The restaurant is very small and in an obscure location in the middle of Scarborough - not where you would expect to find a good seafood restaurant!

We came on a weeknight and had no problem getting seats. I did hear that it was harder on Fridays and Saturday nights so either call for a table. 

Food was good - nice and fresh, no surprise since the market was right on site! A bit pricy compared to other seafood restaurants but it was good quality and knowing that the seafood wasn't sitting around in some fridge for a long time was worth it. We had scallops, shrimps, salmon and calamari. Yum!"}
{"text":"I I have been a customer of the retail store for ten plus years and they have the best oyster when I suck at home.  (I drop by  three times a month minimum for oyster , sea urchin in the shell and the ocassoonal live  soft shell crab.)


I eat at the restaurant at least five time and each was very average.  But the last time was bad.


We went there right after work on a Friday at 6  pm just to avoid the rush.  (yes I made reservations)  but when they greeted me at the front they were look on around and made us wait 5 minutes to e seated.    It was empty empty and there was only one table there.


Once we  were finally seated we ordered but seriously yhe derive was slow.



We ordered the fried calameri


And a lot of oysters-


Fanny bays
Dench kiss
Kummito
Malpequea


Ã€  tasted amazing but they were not sucked cleanily .  Most had small shells in them (50 %)   they have Been opens foe years and this a rookie mistake.    (I never had that at rodneys )   so the first time the waitress come back I point to the small shells on my plate.   She makes a gasping face and appolgise.  I was not expecting anything but this happend the last 3 time I was there .


The grilled salmon was Ok but the oyster killed my mood. 



I guess I should just buy a box and shuck them myself."}
{"text":"First visit to either location of Diana's Oyster Bar.  As others reviews have stated, this location is quite large and it has a beautiful upscale modern decor complete with a bar, large dining area and an oyster bar.  

Diana's has a large menu and a separate menu for the oysters.   Our party started with some oysters.  They have a large variety of oysters to choose from and the server was quite helpful explaining about the different varieties.  Prices for the oysters vary from reasonable to quite expensive.  

Our party had mixed success with their main dishes.  Some hits and some misses.   The hit was a huge serving of Paella brimming with shell fish. The miss was a supposed boneless Red Snapper that was full of bones.  Personally I had the pasta with clams and it was ok but not great

The ambiance, presentation of food and service were excellent.   Unfortunately the food did not match that same level.

Since it's the food is the reason you go to a restaurant,  I can only give a rating of 3 stars but the experience was still enjoyable enough that I will give Diana's another chance."}
{"text":"My fiance and I came here in the summertime and we were definitely not disappointed. Everything we ordered was up to par with our expectations. They have a great selection of oysters, we probably ordered about 3 dozens oysters between the both of us! The Sicilian sea-bass is a must try, it was cooked just right and the fish was really fresh."}
{"text":"Im giving this restaurant a 5 star because service was above and beyond. Melinda excelled at customer satisfaction. It's always nice to go into a restaurant where service staff are knowledgeable of their product.
Atmosphere was just right for a lunch date.

We ordered some oysters, mussels and calamari, rockefeller oyster.
Oysters was amazing as usual my favourite the live scallop.
Mussel was delish, the wine sauce was deadly..sometimes restaurants will overdo the wine but it was just right for the flavour.
Not a fan of the calamari, texture wasn't appealing. The flavour was there but texture needs work.

Treated myself with a Key Lime dessert, perfect end to a lunch date. Definitely a return visit with friends."}
{"text":"First time ever visiting a Diana's oyster bar and husband and I had a great time. 

- sat at the bar and took advantage of the Tuesday oyster specials
- service by the bartenders were quick and very friendly
- food was delicious
- a la carte meals are a little pricey but expected given that it's seafood based 
- drink menu is limited to beer and wine"}
{"text":"Had dinner there last night (nov 26/13). 

Had a dozen oysters to start. These were better shucked than at Bent and still had some juice left but no where near the level they could be, especially in contrast to the mind blowing oysters at a place like the 360 restaurant above Toronto. I feel the oysters are priced a $1 per oyster too much, especially when you consider they own the seafood warehouse  in the back and you can get two dozen for half the price

My main dish was good and priced properly but my wife's sea bass was $10 too much for that level of fish, it's priced almost at the same rate as a restaurant like Bent minus the master chiefs. 

Now our kids loved the fish and chips, my 5 year old son ate two orders so you could say this was the nice surprise. 

The geography doesn't warrant the price of the meal either as you can guess. If they could drop the prices a bit I would recommend it to other city denizens. 

My wife was furious and felt ripped off since she was the one paying  the bill this time round so I didn't feel the sting as bad ( we don't combine our income - only silly fools do that)

There, I won't return except to the seafood store at the back, it's the best place in Toronto for buying seafood in my limited experience."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that you should just take your money elsewhere. I guarantee you will find better food than what you'll get here. 

To start we ordered oysters followed by our mains which were paella (or should I say rice in soup) and the stuffed sea bream. 

The paella was absolute garbage but I mean if you're down for asian chefs trying to make something they have no clue how to properly make then yeah this dish is for you. The paella was pretty much made with your regular Chinese rice that's been over cooked until mushy and a minute away from being turned into congee. 

The menu stated that the sea bream is stuffed with rice and LOBSTER yet I failed to detect even a millimeter strand of lobster in there. I mean if they didn't state lobster as an ingredient in the dish I wouldn't even care but why would you say it's stuffed with something but then not even include it. 

To conclude, I gave 2 stars because of their fresh oysters and the lady who served us was extremely friendly and attentive. 

*note if you're craving for some delicious paella as I was the other night I recommend trying a restaurant near downtown Toronto called Paracas Peruvian Restaursnt. BEST PAELLA IN TOWN."}
{"text":"Incredible oysters - there on a Thursday and had 12 for $20.00, completed with copious amounts of Lemon wedges, fresh- grated horseradish, and 3 types of sauces. Extremely fresh and delicious. Try with a glass of their Italian Pinot Grigio. To die for"}
{"text":"The wife and I use to go to the old location at Lawrence and Warden for the occasional oyster for the Thursday special.
When they opened up the Markham location, we were excite as we live in Markham and the trip will be half the time.

However, our first visit to the new location was rather disappointing. I must say that the place looks great but the service was really slow.

When we got seated, we waiting a good 15 minutes before someone gave us water and then an hour for the 2 dozen oysters we ordered.

They were short staff, possibly due to the recent opening of the restaurant but they could have planned it a lot better.
Hire more part timers and have more staff for daily specials.

They only had 2 people shucking the oysters but the restaurant is 3 times larger than the Lawrence location. Everyone was basically waiting for their food.

They had more bar staffs.
I might give them another try next time but this review is mainly to make people more aware of the current situation of the restaurant.

I hope they are able to improve on the service soon before new customers stray away from giving them another go."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner last night. Really enjoyed the atmosphere and decor.  Went for couple dozens of raw oysters,  they carry a pretty good variety.  It tasted quite fresh and crisp.  Went straight to main course after ,  ordered the shrimp & lobster pasta as well the Dianas paella. Both were very pleasing and tasty.  

Service was amazing,  learned much about oysters from them.  Only thing was the restaurant was a bit chilly."}
{"text":"Having read the reviews from other Yelp members, we went to Diana's  and ordered the oysters and dishes below:

1.Oysters-Market Price. We ordered one of each. They were really fresh. This was my first time ordering oysters at a restaurant so I couldn't compare it to another restaurant. I liked that they offered fresh horse radish (not the prepared horseradish in a jar) along with other condiments. However, I decided to forgo the condiments and squeez lemon to taste their natural flavors and determine whether I liked it or not.

2.Seafood platter (scallops, jumbo cocktail shrimp, mussels, calamari, octopus)- $60. I found that this dish was very good and was a good mix of the appetizers. Everything tasted fresh, but I found that the quantity was insufficient compared to the price.

3.Smoked salmon-I really liked this appetizer dish as the smoked salmon was not overwhelmingly salty. Again, I would have like a bit more for the price.

Conclusion-Order the oysters and skip everything else on the menu."}
{"text":"Not going there again!

I had reservations yet I was seated at the bar with the drop-in patrons due to \"fully booked\".  But then I saw a couple with reservations that came in after us and got seated.  After some complaining we got a table right away (fishy indeed). 

Service was fast.  But when we asked for extra bread, the new bread came in our old basket, complete the with empty butter container.

Food wise, it was ok.  Our entries were average.  The raw oysters were good.  I guess that`s their point of differentiation; not many places offer that much selection.  The operations and decor reminds me of a place called `Day & Night`restaurant in Markham."}
{"text":"Ordered the lobster roll and fried calamari to go. The lobster roll came with fresh fries and it was delicious! The fried calamari serving was small for the price of 13 dollars but it was still very delicious. I think it was the best fried calamari I've ever had. I definitely recommend this place. The service in terms of taking away our food was very fast and courteous as well!"}
{"text":"Had dinner with the family there last night and it was alright, nothing special. 

Had the following 

1. Clam Chowder 
2. Fried Calamari
3. Seafood Platter for 2 
3. Seabream 
4. Caesar drink 

The bill was $135 with tip - price was average but was not really impressed with the food. 

If you go definitely get the soup, that's the only thing I really liked. 

Our server was okay, didn't come by to refill water at all and we had to ask twice. If there's one thing a server should know is, there should never be an empty glass on the table. 

3 stars is fair"}
{"text":"Nice place, but incredible overpriced it..!!! You can spend a nice time at this place but the nice time spent there will end with a disappointed overpriced bill... I definitely wont go back there unless i take somebody  for a date knowing i will score at the end of the evening... 

Also the Seafood shop at the back have 5 docents box of oysters for about 75 buck plus tax... You can incredible find fresh oysters at Metro for 16 bucks tax in... Btw, that box comes with 33 HUGE oysters in it..!!! Just enough to enjoy a nice evening alone with some beers..!!! (Pictures attached)   

RATE:

Place = 10
Food = 10
Bill = 5"}
{"text":"Great selection of Oysters and Raw Clams!
However, the rest of the food was alright.  We ordered the sea bass, which was decent except I was not a fan of the sweet pomegranate sauce that they put on top.  I would have much preferred just a plain butter sauce.  Also, ordered the Lobster Pasta, which was just alright.  It tasted pretty much like they dumped some pasta into a lobster bisque.  The seafood platter was quite a good deal for $100 it could feed at least 3 people.
Overall, would come here for the oyster selection, but would head somewhere else for my main dinner."}
{"text":"Love, love, LOVE this place for oysters!  They always seem to have an excellent variety of oysters, although not always the same ones.  When they don't have some of our favourites, they're able to suggest something similar and assist in selecting a nice variety to sample sweeter vs. saltier and meatier oysters.  They're also always cleaned well. Appetizers are also always delicious."}
{"text":"Had dinner here the other day, service wasn't bad.  Fried calamari and rockefeller oysters are awesome.  Entrees are a little pricey though.  Service is alright, nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"I try this restaurant last night on New Year's Eve , what a blast! Had a reservation for 8pm and by 8,30pm we had already all delicious dishes on our table. The fish is great and fresh, the service as well ,is prompt and very efficient. ( Catherina was very good and kind on understand our wishes ). Would recommend for sure!"}
{"text":"Although I read 50/50 reviews on the restaurant I still regretfully went to check it out. Last night was my first time going to Diana's and it unfortunately will be my last. Although there were moments of a positive dinner experience at first, it drifted into many things that left me as a dissatisfied customer. 

We were seated quite fast by a very nice hostess. The night seemed promising as the waiter we had was very helpful with oyster selection and telling us what dishes we should try. My friend and I ordered the grilled octopus, a couple of oysters and two mains. I ordered the seafood mixed grilled and she ordered a pasta dish.

The appetizer and oysters were prompt in their arrival. They were also pretty tasty so we were pleased. This was until a family was seated beside us. While waiting for a very long while for our mains to come, the family who was seated beside us received their entire apps and meal before we did. We were wondering why seeing that our meals were very similar and had no red meats like steaks coming. We continued to wait patiently.

When our meals finally arrived much later, I was so underwhelmed with the meal. For $35, I expected the dish to meet flavour expectations. Instead the shrimp tasted just like they were soaked in butter and the scallops/salmon were tasteless. The hot sauces didn't help either. I felt like I could have gone to Red Lobster and eaten a comparable meal for much cheaper. And at least they season their meals unlike here! 
(And they have those biscuits lmao).

When we asked to get our items packed, the waiter cleared the table and brought a box for me to do so. He took my fork away beforehand so I kindly requested another one so I could empty the dish into my box. He left and never returned -_-. 20 minutes passed and I asked another waiter if I could get a fork and the bill since our waiter never retuned. He told us that the guy randomly left for a break.

$60 dollars deep and I left very unhappy. There are a lot of places in the city where you can spend that sort of money and enjoy a fantastic meal with amazing service. This place is not one of them. Save your money and your tastebuds for something better. I wouldn't chance it seeing I did and I hate wasting money on bad food and awful service."}
{"text":"Service is average, food is ok. The oysters seems a little overprice and a bit smaller in size than buying at the wholesale place beside the restaurant. 

Would not come to the restaurant again, but will definitely get oysters though."}
{"text":"just came from here and this place has the WORST customer service. came in last thursday where i ordered the seafood mix grill with salmon, shrimp and scallop for 40 bucks and waited for an hour. reminded the waiter and it comes out in less than a minute. dry as hell because it was probably under a heat lamp for so long, told the waiter. Got it sent back, when the food came back out this time EVERYTHING was undercooked (it came back out in about 5 minutes). scallops were cold in the center, shrimps were just cold as if they threw on the ones from the last plate i returned and the salmon?! it was pretty much just seared, it was ALLLL raw in the middle. i show the waiter and he tell me \"oh you dont want it like that?\" i mean DID I ASK FOR SASHIMI?? food comes back the third time and it was pretty much just thrown in the microwave. tired of waiting to eat and already lost my appetite i asked for the bill and NOTHING was taken off. NO discount. NO sorry. NO NOTHING! i paid and left no tip. 

so i decide to try and give them another try for oyster the following monday. thinking maybe it was just a bad day. we start with 24 oysters. it comes and theres a worm in the oyster. i tell the waiter and this time this guy tells me \"oh thats not a worm its what they eat\", tells me its calcium. he was almost about to walk away and leave it on the table before i told him to take it back cus i dont eat worms for calcium. dumbass! whether or not thats true thats is NOT appealing to eat. are you crazy? waiter basically avoided us after until we asked for the bill. again NO sorry. NO discount. NO NOTHING from this place. once again paid and left no tip.

wouldve been the go to spot for oysters and seafood but never again. 

dont waste your time, trust me! they dont care!

btw my servers name was \"useless\" NORMAN."}
{"text":"The oyster bar was my dirty little secret for months. I go every Saturday at noon faithfully. Paul always recommends 3-6 types of oysters for me to try. The staff is amazing the fish is fresh and having had the opportunity to visit Newfoundland every week for business I can eat here at dianna and close my eyes and be in Newfoundland. Love love love this place. 
FYI. I've been going to the fish store since the day it open thousands of years ago with my parents, want fresh fish, oysters, crab, lobster drop in. Paul rocks!"}
{"text":"I treated my parents for dinner here tonight and my tummy is very happy.  It's very rare for my dad to take his time and enjoy the taste of food and my mom is very rare to have her enjoy eating out. Tonight was a win-win situation. We enjoyed the chowder, to oysters, to our main dishes and of course dessert. The staff were all friendly and helpful. I will totally come here again just to devour in oysters. 

The products are definitely fresh! I have never had amazing seafood in Toronto since we are not next to an ocean. I have always hold Vancouver for having amazing seafood but this can cure that craving for me. 

My parents behaved and it was fun enjoying as a family a new favourite restaurant.

I will definitely come back here to celebrate family time."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday with a large party and the bottom line is that I was disappointed. From the entrance the experience was poor and after just one visit, I question the kitchen's ability to maintain a consistent delivery of food after they botched portions and ingredients. Pay attention to what you order and its ingredients listed in the menu. The taste of the food itself was average. For the same price, I can find better food and a better experience elsewhere. In the end, I think it came down to poor planning and management. It will be a gamble to come here again and it probably won't be any time soon.

Long story:

We made reservations and arrived 15 minutes early (parking was awful, btw), but the table wasn't set up yet. This could have been a problem if the place was just slightly more busy (it was busy) - our seats could have been given away. 

We arrived during the prime dinner time and the specials were already becoming unavailable. 

Several of us ordered the same dishes and they were either vastly different in size portions or there were differences (omissions) in ingredients.  It wasn't obvious until near the end of the meal. For example, I was missing clams (no shells in the remains) in my Bouillabaisse. I also wasn't sure if I was missing fish too, like salmon, because those may have crumbled in my bowl. (Wait, they were giving crumbs of fish instead of proper filets?!) Still, it was obvious when I saw my friend finishing up with a big chunk of fish in his Bouillabaisse that I don't recall having in mine. I did complain and they gave me some clams on the side, but it didn't taste the same nor should it have come down to that in the first place. Another example would have been the difference in two orders of the same pasta dish... One seemed never ending (dense pile) and another was finished relatively quickly. We should have had the same ingredients and portions. 

We did not order oysters. (I could shuck them myself anyway.)

(We speculated that the food was produced in batches and plated unevenly, then primped up for presenation to mask the shortcomings.)

As for dessert, there was some black stuff  on the bottom of one of our creme brulees (likely extra vanilla seeds). Dessert was okay but the rest of the experience dragged it down."}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend for a date. They sat us right away, water in hand and menus on the table. We ordered an assortment of oysters and an appetizer of clams. The food came immediately and everything was fresh and excellent. The grilled octopus appetizer was amazing and so were the scallops. The mains did not disappoint either, mixed grill and grilled branzino"}
{"text":"Fresh seafood but chef skills are lacking. You can get great varieties of oysters here so if you are looking to taste multiple oysters this is the place to go. If you're just looking to satisfy your oyster craving then this place is not cheap at all. You can get buck a chuck at a lot of other places in Toronto.

I can't say the cooked foods were worth the trip."}
{"text":"I had been to this place once several months ago. Today, three of friends and I came for a lunch and again, it provides very flavorful, unexpected and delicious food as usual. I like its yummy food and ambiance so much that my friends and I could enjoy every moment in the restaurant. We ordered 3 kinds of oysters for our appetizer and its popular items like lobster roll, pan seared tuna, grilled Basa and spicy shrimp pasta. They all came out so fresh, unbelievably texture and combination...so yummy!!! Definitely, we would like to come back and try some other dishes very soon."}
{"text":"Haven't been back for a long time. Came for Father's Day. 
Greeter was awesome. Immediate recognized my father has difficult walking and sat us closer to the exit. Oysters were great! Some lost their juice by the time it was served possibly by the way they were farmed or shucked. Was told a farming issue... Waitress was not as friendly as previous visits. Heavier set lady. Seemed almost defensive when mentioned about the juice issue. Other wait staff was more attentive and friendly. Maybe she wasn't happy that we asked other servers for help since she was not present. 
Clam chowder is definitely a must! Got one to go as well for the wifey. 
Caesar salad was served without the leaves being cut. Not sure why but my elderly parents were not happy about cutting up their salad... I guess it looks more presentable that way. 
Soft shell crab was decent. Batter was not what we expected. It was similar to fish and chips type of batter. Usually a lighter batter similar to agedashi dofu. 
Ponzu was not ponzu either. Ponzu is a Japanese citron with Japanese soy sauce. They added some grilled red peppers and I think shallots with minimal hints of citrus fruits. 
Grilled octopus was decent. My mother said it was tastier at Eden on lakeshore. 

Overall not what I expected. Usually a great experience and food is on point. Maybe cause we ordered many specials that weren't on the menu normally or the luck of who served us. Will definitely come back since my parents love seafood and theirs is one of freshest. 
I hope this doesn't come off as complaining but more as constructive feedback to improve. We enjoy eating here normally and would like them to be successful so we can enjoy their food for years to come."}
{"text":"Well I got to say I was disappointed this time, oyster seems not so good as last time and the most important thing is that the service really sucks. Even we finished two dozen oyster, still not coming the main dishes and all night nobody added water and u have to just ask for it again and again."}
{"text":"I visit Diana's seafood a few times a year. It's a bit pricey but worth it. The seafood is always fresh and I've never gotten sick (unlike some other restaurants). Book in advance if you are going for any special occasion. 

One of my go to dishes is the Clam linguine.

I'm looking forward to to visiting the North York location next."}
{"text":"I've always seen them at night markets across Toronto so I thought to give it a try with my family. Really amazing atmosphere. Food was delicious and fresh and I would definitely come back again. Price is a little pricy but its to be expected when it comes to seafood. Oysters are a must try and the lobster is good as well. Looking forward to trying the clam chowder next time as it looks super appetizing. 

Staff members were nice and well educated with the menu. Only thing that could have been better was the time it took to be served. Can't blame them though because the preparation for oysters happen when you order. 

Over all VERY satisfied with my experience."}
{"text":"Excellent Fresh Oysters 
great deal if you are visiting on Tue or Wed as they have specials 
got two dozens from East and West  - love the creamy texture of the Western Oysters and the delicate from the East coast.

ordered also Lobster soup , Was good !

Love it - will come again"}
{"text":"I gave one star because the hostess and the wait staff were all supper nice and helpful. But I would not recommend this restaurant for their food. The seafood was mediocre and for the price they charged you, it was not worth it at all. We didn't like how one of our entrees was prepared and told the wait staff about our disappointment. He was so customer driven and offered to return it back to the kitchen and let us order another dish.  We thought that was nice until the Manager came over with the original plate in his hand and started \"questioning\" us.  His tone was confrontational and defensive; I wonder how he could be in the restaurant business. We were so fed up with his attitude that we told him to charge us for both plates if he thought we were trying to scam his restaurant. Although he offered to take the item off our bill, we could feel it wasn't a genuine offer.  Our evening was totally ruined by him. Stay away if you want to have a nice dining experience unless you are willing to eat whatever they serve you and not say a word."}
{"text":"Note - this review isn't based on their oysters.  Perhaps if I would have had them, I could have given them another star based on the reviews of my fellow Yelpers.

I ventured all the way to Lawrence and Warden from Mississauga to eat here this past Tuesday.  The dining room was full (mind you it is a small dining room - around 10 tables) and there were people on the patio.  There were also a few larger groups of diners, so I had my hopes up.  

I ordered the tomato bisque with crab to start, crab cake and the grilled and butterflied branzino.  My party finished shared the red and white poached pear with blue cheese, candied walnuts and balsamic reduction.  

The meal started off well.  The tomato bisque had a great consistency and colour,  the seasoning was bold, and the crab gave it the added saltiness that the soup needed.  However, I thought that as you continued to eat it, the seasoning overpowered the crab and it got lost in the dish.  The crab cake was a winner - it was moist  and perfectly dense with a nice golden crust.  I only wish that there was a second one.  I was slightly disappointed that there was only one on the plate at a $10 price point.

I really enjoyed the vegetables on my entree.  It was a standard mix, but the addition of beets was a nice and pleasant touch.  The fish was ok.  I wish it was more buttery, but it had a great sear and texture.  I do have to mention that my mom ordered the potato crusted halibut and it was the driest piece of fish I'd eaten in a long time.  It looked so plump when it came out, but it just fell apart.

The poached pear wasn't a highlight at all.  I felt like it wasn't cooked enough, as both pears had a lingering vinegar flavour.  That's about it.

The meal started on a high, but gradually fell as the night went on.  For the price point, and the reputation, I was definitely expecting better."}
{"text":"Food was not prepared by a chef - pre-made lobster roll, soggy, small chunks of lobster and not seasoned well.

Same for the clam chowder -- which was canned.   No excuse for this.

Coffee was good

Highly overpriced for the products."}
{"text":"If you are here for oyster bar, I would say 4 stars
If you are here for their cooked dishes, 2 stars

Service is 4 stars
Decor is 4 stars

But I can't give it more than 2 stars for the cooked dishes because out of six dishes that we ordered, five of them failed, that's a 83% failure. 

Paella was the worst I have ever tasted."}
{"text":"Read the other reviews for the complete lowdown on the restaurant, while I focus on 3 things; food, price and service. 

This is not a \"white tablecloth\" place in any respect, but the prices are very high. The menu is short and there is nothing for kids to order.  The design of the restaurant is kind of like an airport fish-themed sports bar. 

The food is a mix. Yes its seafood, and the mains are fresh, but really... $35 for sea bass?! $12 for 2 small crabcakes that look and taste like institutional frozen food from the PC menu.  Squirting some \"aioli\"  on the plate doesn't hide the fact that the crab cakes are not very tasty - no wow factor here.  The clam chowder is good for $8. but I wouldn't drive cross-town for it. The menu items are all over-priced for the dumpy Scarborough location, wait-service quality, portion size and most of all taste; plain and simple. 

During the day for the lunch crowd, $15 gets you fish and chips but its off the menu at night. 

\"You vill order ze fish from ze fish store in ze back and you vill like it and you vill pay beeg bucks too\"  ---- I made that up - no one said that :-) 

The wait staff are running around and slinging plates.The washrooms are tiny and weren't clean when we were there."}
{"text":"Had the smoked salmon appetizer today.  Good taste, beautifully presented! Capers shredded egg, greens, shredded horseradish and more.  9 bucks for lunch with water!  They are getting really busy there. Overheard they are expanding...good because it's busy when I've been there."}
{"text":"Received lovely service. The food was okay that day, not its best. Really nice to eat lunch on the patio."}
{"text":"As the rating describes, it was just OK (I would probably give it 2.5 stars if I could). I didn't think it was that special. If anything, it was a little overrated. The only items that were worth it (in my opinion) were the lobster bisque and the oysters. I went with my boyfriend on a Tuesday.

The food: 

We ordered an assortment of oysters, the lobster bisque and grilled calamari to start. The oysters were very fresh, presentation is good, and there's an assortment of sauces.  The lobster bisque was nice and creamy with chunks of lobster in it. As for the calamari, it was meh. I've had better in many other places for around the same price ($13). 

Moving onto the main course, we had the catch of the day (Arctic Char) and the salmon. Again, it was meh. I liked the fact that the skin of the fish was crispy, the presentation was good and it was pretty fresh. Other than that, I've had better elsewhere (in terms of freshness, presentation and taste). I didn't think it was anything special. 

Onto the service:

When we arrived, it was a Tuesday, wasn't too busy so we were seated immediately. We were also served rather quickly so that was good. I was actually impressed. Our drinks and appetizers came quickly and our entrees came soon after we finished our appetizers. 

However, when  my boyfriend decided that he wanted to order more oysters after our entrees arrived. It seemed as though after they dropped off the entrees we actually had to flag down out waitress to place another order (and by that time, a lot of the other tables had left so she shouldn't have been as busy as she was when we first arrived). When he finally placed our order for oysters, it took much longer than it did the first time. 

When we finally finished our food, we once again had to flag down the waitress so we can get our bill. It took a little while to locate her and then for her to bring the bill. Finally, when she brought the bill, it was just dropped off and we assumed she'd come back in a few minutes to check on us/bring a machine or see if we needed changed. But in fact, we had to wait like 10 minutes. From the time we were ready for our bill to the time we actually left the place, it took almost 30 minutes. 

Finally onto the ambiance:
 
The restaurant itself looked better than I expected. However, it was very loud, especially given the fact that it wasn't even that busy. There were maybe 7 tables each with 2-4 customers. Perhaps it was the fact that the room was small and partially because of the people that were there that night but I was hoping that the place would be a little quieter.

 The verdict:

So my verdict is this, I would return for the oysters and maybe try other appetizers but probably not the entrees since I can get something better elsewhere for the same price."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday when they had their oyster specials ($15 for 12 Malpeques). My friend and I ordered two dozen oysters and they were incredibly fresh. The food was also delicious, we had a clam chowder and shrimp pasta. I highly recommend the shrimp pasta (forgot what the full name of it was), the sauce is nice and creamy and you get a good portion of seafood.  However, although the restaurant was semi-busy, my complaint lies with the service we received. Our server came off rather rude, and seemed like he did not have time to answer our questions about the menu and the different types of oysters that they had.  We also had to ask for our drinks to be refilled several times, and it wasn't until we were almost done our meal, did he come and ask if everything was okay. However, the quality of the food made up for the poor service. I would probably come back for their oyster specials again, but only if the service is improved!"}
{"text":"We were initially very excited about going to Diana's yesterday.  We have been to Diana's before and they never disappointed once. However, after yesterday, I regret to say this is probably one of the worst seafood establishments out there. You basically pay 4 stars for 1 star service and quality. The moment we walked into the restaurant, there was confusion at the front about our reservation. The hostess who was taking care of us decided to walk the other customer who came in after us to her table first and left us hanging there for 5 minutes. No apology, but not a big deal. We were not in a hurry. When we arrived at our table, we were served with tap water. I mean, fresh from the tap, with still a strong taste of chlorine, clearly not filtrated water. I would totally understand if we are going to a 1 to 2 star restaurant where keeping the budget low is a concern, but this is not something to expect from Diana's! Anyhow, we proceeded to order our appetizers. We started off by ordering a Ceasar salad, steamed mussels with white wine, a dozen of oysters and 4 cherrystones. The salad arrived, fresh, but completely overpriced for its portion and ingredients ($18).  Steamed mussels arrived next. We tasted one each and was completely turned off by its staleness. We complained to the server and a supervisor came to explain to us that this is normal because they are from B.C! What the heck?! Do you think this was the first time we ever had mussels? What rudeness? Treating your customers like a fool! Reluctantly, she took the mussels back. Our final straw -- the oysters and the cherrystones. The oysters were decent and that shouldn't be a surprise. Yet, the cherrystones were a joke! We ordered 4 in total to taste and they charge $4 each. If you charge such a price for one piece, the least you could do is to guarantee their freshness and quality. One of them was the size of a little neck clam -- no bigger than a loonie, a quarter of the size of a normal cherrystone. We waved the server over and pointed it out. She laughed and we asked her to replace that one for us.  She left and then some Asian guy who worked at the oyster bar came over and shamelessly told us that he saw nothing wrong with this. He explained that their stocks came in as bulk and he had no control over their sizes. I calmly told him that this was embarrassing for such a reputable seafood establishment to put such on a plate and that he had the choice to not serve this wimpy clam to the customers. All we wanted was a sincere apology. But all he did was to continue to talk to us in a condescending way! Way to treat your customers and get them to come back! If this Diana's chain continue to serve low grade seafood and hire this group of rude, poorly-trained staff, this will surely destroy their longstanding reputation within a very short time! We left hungry because we didn't see the point of giving them another chance. For the little that we ordered, we paid over $60! For now, we know we will never step our foot back into this particular Diana's again and we will surely warn everyone we know about this horrible restaurant. This is definitely one of our worst experience dining out!"}
{"text":"What would be better than ending 2016 with a high end seafood dinner?? Or so I hoped... On the way there I was almost drooling just thinking about the seafood I was about to feast on! We were greeted right away, arriving at 6pm right on time for our reservation, and wow this place has a nice modern look with this huge oyster bar as the main feature..what an amazing selection of fresh oysters! Although not really into oysters, I couldn't help to try out some Fanny Bays learning that West Coast oysters would be 'less briny'. Following that we ordered the steamed mussels, tuna tartare and their namesake seafood paella. 
I admit, it's my fault for comparing the paella to those I've had in Spain, but I couldn't get past the risotto texture (a lil too mushy) while at the same time the rice being so dry! I was crunching it at times! Overall there's lots of seafood and the flavour is oh-kaaay, but the rice was just too old for a $32 price tag! The tuna tartare was okay too but it was hard to eat in the shot glasses they came in. The steamed mussels were good, but I've had better. So really, the oysters which I didn't even really want ended up being the best part of the meal.

GOOD STUFF: easy to get to, free parking, modern contemporary decor, oyster bar!
NOT SO GOOD: the paella
SERVICE: friendly, attentive and made recommendations 
BANG FOR YOUR BUCK: no, not really, at all (even oysters were pricey)
RETURN POTENTIAL: probably would not return, unless I was in the mood for oysters while in the area, maybe? Definitely NOT for a special occasion!"}
{"text":"I was very pleased to find out that Diana's had opened in the Markham location. As a very satisfied customer of their Scarborough store and restaurant, I was a little disappointed by the length of time it took to get our orders. 
Our reservation was set for 7pm on a Tuesday night. It wasn't a full house, but it was quite busy which made me pleased that they were doing well at the new location. 

Thank goodness I was with two of my girlfriends who made the time go by quickly. While our server was kind, bubbly and actually quite good, it took over an hour for our oysters and seafood platter to arrive. 

Having said that, the food was wonderful, the service was friendly, the oyster assortment was delicious, unfortunately it was just incredibly slow. I'm hoping they'll get it sorted out in the new year. 

I would definitely go back, however if the length of time didn't improve I would consider going somewhere else."}
{"text":"Returned for my birthday (October/Fall) with updated review on some more menu items.

Appetizers:
- Crab cakes: (2) hockey puck sized on a bed of arugula. It was warm and flakey, a good \"side\" if you plan on indulging in oysters, especially on an empty stomach
- Oyster Trio: Only Rockerfeller was available (and waiter said it's been like that for a while). Although we got 4 instead of 3, I would skip this dish. As an oyster lover, I felt like it was complete masked by the rest of the ingredients. I would have rather spent that money on raw oysters.

Oysters:
- Kusshi (always a good and safe choice, but today, the sizes were a lot smaller than previous)
- French Kiss (the best out of our platter, sizable, briny, meaty).
- Salt Grass Point (briny, was supposed to be better than Malpeques, but ours was very thin, small and underwhelming, wouldn't order again)
- South Bay Blonde (nothing really stands out about this, wouldn't order again)

Dessert:
- Special: Tuxedo cheesecake - very rich if you like that sort of thing, not to my taste but hubby enjoyed it a great deal
- Dessert Trio: chocolate cake was nice, creme brulee was okay, curd was waaaay too sweet. Wouldn't order again."}
{"text":"Had a great light lunch here.  The service was excellent.  The oysters are fresh and plump, though the fresh grated horseradish was a little limp and not particularly strong.

The chowder was also a good choice, and I would recommend.  I'll be back with more appetite to work my way through the menu."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars.

I have been to the Woodbine location twice and several times to the Lawrence location. The Woodbine location is larger and sitting is more spacious compared to the Lawrence location.  

However, I was a bit disappointed with the food consistency.   I have ordered Bouillabaise in both locations but preferred the taste and texture of the Lawrence location.  Also, some menu items in the Lawrence location are not available in the Woodbine location.   

Overall, this restaurant is still a great addition to the uptown area for having seafood and oysters.  I will always recommend their appetizer of the day and catch of the day as these dishes are always fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Great for oysters at the bar with beer or wine, but completely mediocre and overpriced for lunch or dinner (and I live across the street - I've been here many times for dinner!). Staff are friendly and knowledgeable,  restaurant is clean, food is fresh. But the food is so unremarkable! One time, for lunch, I ordered a grilled tuna wrap and got canned tuna. The staff were quick to apologize and took it off my bill... but yuck! Canned tuna at a seafood restaurant? 
Calamari is good, fish entrees are always fine... but for the price, I would go just about anywhere else. I don't know how else to explain this other than \"uninspired\". Relatively common fare, and not in a classic way. I would expect this kind of presentation to be about $10 less per plate. 

Last spring/summer they had a mussels, fries, and pint of beer special on. That was delicious! I hope they do that again."}
{"text":"Pieces of the shell left on the oysters. 

Size of the oysters were inconsistent.

Had to ask for bread for the oysters, otherwise they wouldn't give it to you.

Lot's of other places in Toronto that you can get the same food with better service."}
{"text":"really good oyster selection, especially in an area where there is basically no alternatives relatively nearby. If you come here and don't order oysters, there is no point in coming here. 

The cooked items is what is keeping this from a 3.5/4 star review. The steamed lobster was fine (you can't mess up steamed lobster, as long as it is fresh), we had a few fish plates that were ok. Their seafood paella was probably the weakest of all the dishes we tried. It was quite bland, which usually is ok if the seafood can balance it out, but the whole dish was just bland. 

The food isn't bad, it's just a bit overpriced. Stick with the oysters."}
{"text":"Coming to here is of course for its seafood and oysters.  We order 5 dozens oysters. Yummy. Fresh with lemon, seafood sauce and horseradish. I like the horseradish to be stronger

Virginica 1 dz @ $3.18/pc
Colville Bay 1 dz @ $2.90/pc
Kumomoto  1 dz @ $2.68/pc
French Kiss 2 dz @ $2.48/pc

I like the Virginica the best, then the French Kiss

After all the oysters are consumed, I have the clam chowder which proves to be a bit too salty for me. I try the Euro Bass. It is butterfly pan fried fillet. Black cod which is not available for the night should have a better texture. 

The service is worth mentioning the waiter is so attentive and polite. He is so willingly trying to explain and suggest everything for us. Always smiling.  I think he must love and enjoy his work

The restaurant is not big at all. It is good that we come on a Wednesday.  Weekend sure will have a long line up

Oysters still seem to be in my mouth!

Ooops forget to mention that wine is expensive here. A glass of white wine costs $11."}
{"text":"Have been to this Restaurant a few times now, We are in love with the Seafood platter! Lobster, grilled octopus, large scallops, shrimp, salmon and some yummy sides and more! reminded me of being on vacation!! It is a feast and perfect to share between 2, or we ordered it along with a couple of main courses for 4. I even loved the mix of wild rice lentil and diced tomatoes that came with the platter. Definitely the best Seafood platter I have had in Canada 

I love how their Oysters come with freshly grated horse radish, as I can not stand that soupy store bought stuff, they really pay attention to detail here, Try the seafood platter and oysters, you wont regret it.

The location is best for small groups, good for a date and anyone who loves seafood!"}
{"text":"A Hidden Gem in Scarborough. Hubby and I have always passed this restaurant along Lawrence and finally decided to try it out. We have been for both lunch and dinner. Must trys are; crab cakes, grilled octopus, clam chowder, raw oysters ( caspcumpec ), lobster roll (only available at lunch time), clams and linguine and Spanish paella. 

The service was great both times we went, Saturday dinner and Sunday lunch. We took our 3.5 year old daughter with us at lunch and the waiter was very good with her. 

Great experience all around and will return to try their other offerings along with our favourites."}
{"text":"Oysters.... amazing oysters!
Great selection.... 8-12 east coast varieties plus 6-8 west coast varieties. Served traditional style on ice with lemon wedges and fresh grated horseradish. 3 sauces at the table... seafood, scotch bonnet and mignonette (red wine and shallots). Tobasco on request.
These people run a seafood wholesale business in the building behind the restaurant - so freshness and variety are not an issue. Some great main dishes that take advantage of fresh seafood.... try the surf and turf....scallops, shrimp and veal.... fantastic."}
{"text":"Great seafood restaurant. I am a regular at the seafood shop and stopping for lunch having few different oysters and some BC mussels.
Dinner is great as well. Probably one of my favorite seafood restaurants."}
{"text":"We went there on Saturday night
Waited for 30 for our reservations 
But no problem
We ordered our apps + dinner 
The soup came and the calamari
I asked the waitress for a second spoon
After 15 min I get the spoon
On the first spoon I found a hair inside 
I called the waitress over 
She just took the bool away and 5 min after 
Just brings one more soup bool
Woweee
Any ways we finished the dinner payed for the meal ( even for the soup )
I asked her if there was anything she could do for us 
Nothing
No manager came to say just I am sorry 
How can I go there again???"}
{"text":"I can see why the rating is only average here.  First I must say that the food is good here.  I came here for a family birthday dinner over the weekend.  I have no compliant about the food.  However, the dishes are on the small side, also for the surf and turf, the steak is almost like well done when we asked for medium rare.  The reason I can't give another star is the service.  I took my kids there and the first impression I got was THEY DON'T LIKE KIDS!  I mean, everyone was a child once in their life time.  The server gave us huge attitude when we asked if there are any children menu - NO THERE ISN'T!  OK... Then we seemed to be picked by the server on everything we asked for.  Since this is a family birthday event I didn't want to show my displeasure about the service, but I feel that I should say it here.  The server were annoyed by the fact that we took so long to order (but this is not a Hong Kong style cafÃ© or wonton noddle place which is expected to order in minutes).  Then my kids went to check out the Christmas Tree and they were unhappy that my kids were on their way (then they shouldn't put a Christmas tree there!).  I am not sure what I should expect from a high-end restaurant anymore - I think good service and good food no longer co-exist!  My recommendation to everyone is go there just for the food, pre-study your menu at home, and order as fast as you can, and try not to bother your server until you need your bill."}
{"text":"I really like Diana's and have been going to the Lawrence Ave. location for a number of years.  I was excited to see it close to me in Markham.  I have to disagree with some of the other posters about the new ambiance of the restaurant.  It actually spoiled the experience for me.  Diana is at least a $$$ restaurant.  The new place is very big and there is a section down the middle that is stacked with tables - I wouldn't call it intimate dinning. It felt like cafeteria seating.  They really tried - but we were seated in a front table where the parking lot lights and cars were shining directly in my eyes - Guys, you need to at least frost that window or put some blinds there.  We were also directly under a big screen tv - with a basketball game on.  Guys, you need to decide if you are a sports bar, a hamburger joint or a fine restaurant - I found the table was a distraction from the meal and we moved.  The TV's were tacky.  They had really cool salt and pepper shakers on the tables - they were nicely plated but in an odd attempt instead of candles they had the battery powered fake tea candles from a dollar store. That one was a miss.  The wait staff was nice - on the goofy side and knew nothing about what they were serving - \" we have two specials but get the lobster\" we had to say well, what are the specials - and he found a paper and read them to us - Maybe they should use the tv screens to show the specials (just kidding, kill the tvs) - the restaurant is as bright as a cafeteria as well - guys if you want to add a splash of class, dim the lights-  and in a classy restaurant please train your servers to never take your plate away while others are still eating. 

The food was the usual Diana's standard - EXCELLENT and with exception of the staff training and eating in a cafeteria it was great.  

They really can do some simple things as described above to get it right - and if they are ambitious add some room division to make the experience equal the food and the price."}
{"text":"Diana's Seafood is the place to be if you love fresh oysters and a shucking good time with the bartenders!

We were seated at the bar due to how busy they were and we waited 40 minutes without a reservation. I was pretty happy to be seated at the bar because we had no trouble getting service right away! The service was personable and very attentive. Every dish was served with a \"Lord of the Rings\" type description - the staff here at Diana's really put in the effort to make customers happy! 

They were all sold out of kunomoto oysters by the time we were seated but we ordered cherry stones and other east coast oysters suggested by the shuckers. The oysters here are really fresh and served with freshly grated horse radish! 

The clam chowder was A-OK - I would have preferred it to be more creamy but could be just personal preference. My Arctic char was not as juicy and tender as my boyfriend's dish but it was nonetheless still delicious. The roasted beets went really well with the fish! 

I will definitely be back, but next time I will make a reservation!"}
{"text":"Great oysters restaurant in Scarborough. It was tasty fresh and reasonable prices. The servers were so nice to us always smile and asked us how everything is.. Definitely will come back here. Check out the clam's chowder guys. Wont be disappointed"}
{"text":"So firstly the food is a definite 5 Star.   Excellent, tasty and well deserving of 5 stars.  

However the service from our server was absolutely terrible.   I'm going to add him into the top worst 5 servers I've had."}
{"text":"I spent close to a $1k for a family dinner for 14 people, I expect a lot more for this amount of money in a competitive restaurant scene where. Sadly, the only thing that saved the night was the our waitress who was excellent throughout the evening who I learned will be returning to school this summer, so really I can think of no reason to come here. 

First of all, I usually enjoy a glass of wine with dinner when I'm eating out. Typically when my family gathers for a meal for special occasions like these, we can easily finish 4 bottles, but unfortunately the wine list here was just not up to par. Mediocre wine list paired with a ridiculous mark up. While many of the restaurants I frequent do have a rather large mark up on their wine, their wine list is usually more refined and curated. The wine choices and prices simply don't pair up with the expected quality of food based on prices of similar restaurants. 

Unfortunately my family was quite blunt about the quality of their meals when I polled them after. The oysters were okay which is the least we expect since this is where they've earned their name. We had pretty much tried all their apps (ie. crab cakes, squid, various salads, two mussel dishes), ordered a whole lobster, surf and turf, pasta, paella, fish etc. The only memorable dish was the paella, we were otherwise disappointed in the dishes. In fact, my aunt felt that the seafood did not taste fresh.  Everything else was very mediocre or below expectations. 

Lastly, beware of the 15% mandatory gratuity for large size parties. The 15% is calculated based on the total bill including taxes. They are charging 15% on HST (which is not part of the goods or services provided, but a remittance collected on behalf of the govt) when they should really be charging 15% on the subtotal for food and drinks BEFORE tax. This is undoubtedly dishonest. We didn't dispute the charge as we felt that the waitress had earned the full amount based on her service alone. I would give zero for food and wine. 

Through their grocery store, Diana's has built a brand for themselves and it feels like they simply don't care for your business anymore."}
{"text":"Came here for their oyster special twice. The first time it was still newly open for not yet a year and my date and I dined over great food. The atmosphere seemed classy at first and the restaurant was dimmed, which was great for  a date IF only everything else went well. It all went downhill after we got the food and the service however was also terrible as there were two waiters attending to our table and we saw the two debate who should get our table, which I found very unprofessional. 

Second time I came back with a friend recently and the service was terribly slow and the food was only mediocre. We were disappointed that the oysters had bits of shells in them that made it difficult to enjoy. And after about AN HOUR, our appetizers still hadn't come. 

I couldn't understand what the hold up was as everyone else around us got their food already -including the table that ordered after us. We ordered two simple appetizers that I'm sure could have been made in less than an hour-even a main should not take an hour to make. Very disappointing.

Parking is convenient as it is located right in front of the restaurant. The menu prices are a bit pricey for what it is. The decor inside gives a nice, classy ambiance."}
{"text":"I definitely prefer coming to this location much more than the Markham location as I find the food to be much better tasting. I had ordered their Atlantic salmon main with the broccoli on the side, and the salmon was cooked to absolute perfection! 

My date also ordered the surf and turf and that was really disappointing- I would not recommend ordering this. Although the fresh scallops were big and cooked perfectly,  there was only 2 of it and 2 tiger grilled tiger shrimps which was also cooked nicely. However, what made this dish not appealing was the quality of the steak. The steak was thin and looked like a really cheap cut (the menu did not specify what cut it was either, so I guess we couldn't expect too much of it). But for the price of it, you would at least think they would give a decent cut and even if it wasn't a great cut, they could've at least cooked it right ... we had asked for medium rare and the steak came to us as well done. 

Getting oysters is a must when we're at an oyster bar, so we definitely got 2 dozens of the malpeques and fanny bays. I've never had a problem with the oysters at this Diana's (can't say the same for the Markham location- their oysters was just full of sand and broken pieces of shells) 

3 stars because the menu prices are too expensive for what it is and the service is only OK- takes a few attempts to try and get a waiter over. There are plenty of better other seafood restaurants/ oyster bars less expensive and comparable quality of seafood elsewhere."}
{"text":"Wonderful modern space, relaxing atmosphere not pretentious, however the music choice could have been better. If I wanted to be in a club, I would have gone to one. However once we told our server, the manager came by and thanked us for our suggestion of changing it to light jazz and he did!

My husband and I wanted oysters and this was the place to get some! So happy to have found a place that is different from the local Asian restaurants and we both were tired of rice and noodles! We had an excellent server by the name of Winston! He was quite knowledgable about the oysters. We ordered 6 Fanny bay( west coast) and 6 French kiss(east coast) and 2 Kumaomto (Japan) 

The Fanny Bay was excellent, big and juicy and wonderfully fresh tasting. The French kiss was creamy had a milder flavour, both were quite yummy. The Kumaomto was alright and tiny but not worth the price of almost $5 a piece.  

I also ordered the black Cod, it was wonderful, sweet, and a perfect size.
My husband order the black Agnes steak and it was done to perfection! 
The kids had fish and chips, which they seems to enjoyed.
For dessert we shared a slice of key lime pie, which could have been a more more tart and key lime flavour.

We will be back and the price was worth it!!!"}
{"text":"Must Try: OYSTERS! Diana's Clam Chowder, Lobster Bisque, Grilled Octopus, Seafood Linguine 
||
Rating:  (9/10) Food, (9/10) Service, (9/10) Value, (9 /10) Ambience, (9/10) Presentation, (10/10) Cleanliness

My Experience:  
Often coming here for special occasions, Diana's is the gonna spot for seafood. 

Personally I would come here for oysters and try all the variety they have and pair that with a nice bowl of soup and a glass of wine. I enjoy creamy east coast oysters, so Kushi and Fat Bastard are my picks.

If you're feeling particularly hungry, I suggest the Seafood grill for two, which could really fill 3 to 4 people esp if you get Apps and oysters. 

Great ambiance is what sets this restaurant apart from others, including their own Lawrence location. Although a bit pricey, you get value in every dollar."}
{"text":"Lunch on friday around 11:30 sat on patio with 2 friends.  its nice out there!! the plexiglass guard that surrounds you makes you feel like your may be at the docks on a patio not warden/lawrence.  The serving staff is attentive and can be overbearing at times, you will never do without.

The order:

2 doz oysters:
12 malpaque @1.58 each
6 fanny bay @ 1.80 each
6 kumamoto @2.50 each

All are so fresh taste like the sea, served with horseradish, lemon. scotch bonnet hot sauce and Mignonette.  I love the fanny bay!! so meaty.  The malpaque although good i'm going to pass on them next time.  the kumamoto are on the small side but flavour galore.  

1 pasta of the day $17, fettucine with a marinara sauce, shrimps, scallops and salmon.  If you feel like pasta this dish did the trick. although not a ton of seafood in it, would pay more for more of that.

The dissapointment of the day was the softshelled crab fried in panka crumbs with arugula.  The crab was not soft shelled enough and tough in areas, it should be \"soft\" to consume all, many small bones of the shell.  $14 x 2 

I just love the oysters and from now on going to overdose on them with crowd in tow, and share a couple of apps or main.

The above lunch with 4 beers, 2 ceasars and 3 glasses of wine $160 + $25 tip.  2 1/2 hour lunch. (a bit of lushes we are!!) i had only one beer because of driving, my peeps however loved their cocktails

*********note: as i said in other review if your having oysters order them first enjoy them then order your lunch. everything comes a little too fast. however if you are in a crunch for time this may be good.  we wanted leisure.  

*****note #2, the patio allows for smoking the table behind us had a cigar smoker + regular smoker.  many smokers on patio."}
{"text":"Diana's is probably one of my favourite restaurants in the city. I've never had a bad meal or experience here; every dish has been delicious and the service has been lovely. They offer a great selection of seafood and if you don't know where to start you can't go wrong with the catch of the day...they also have a great selection of oysters. The staff is friendly and always ready to provide suggestions and the restaurant is clean and nicely decorated with some nice pieces of artwork. Meals are served in a timely manner and are fairly priced. While there are a handful of non-seafood dishes on the menu, if you're a seafood lover I would definetly recommend checking it out.

5/5"}
{"text":"The service was not good at all. Not even serving bread after sitting for 20 mins. The waiter asked how many buns we need when you requested. (Or they don't offer bread?)
Wait for 30 mins to get our food on a non busy week night.
Stuffed Sea bream full of small bones ($30) (not worth it). The squid spaghetti ($26) was so hard to bit and very oily. Clam Chowder was not hot enough but loop warm. The desserts was not up to standard at all. Tiramisu ($9) was so watery with ugly soggy presentation. Harmony Trio ($15): a cup of cream with hardly dig biscuit at the bottom, a round tasteless short bread and a muffin, Looks weird and tasted bad too.
In general, very pricey and not recommended to try."}
{"text":"Went here during the Monday $15/dozen special. Oysters were good however each oyster had tiny shell fragments inside. Whoever shucked the oysters probably rushed them since we only waited a few minutes to receive an order of two dozen oysters.

I would have given this place four stars, but after eating each oyster my friend and I spent a few seconds picking pieces of shells out of our mouths."}
{"text":"The atompshere, decor, server and other superficial things were good but the food itself isn't memorable. For the relatively high prices, I expected something that would keep me coming back for more. Everything was cooked perfectly but it's lacking any kind of soul. I thought maybe it was only my dish but my 4 other family members seemed to think it was a bit mediocre as well. It's pretty much red lobster quality but with better ingredients."}
{"text":"The ambiance of the restaurant was very classy and clean. It looked like an upscale restaurant with nice oceanic decor. 

For 6 people, we shared the following: 

-Manhattan clam chowder: couldn't really taste or find the clam. I personally would've preferred the regular clam chowder.
-Pan seared scallops: tender, mildly sweet, nicely browned, and delicious! The sauce for the veggie base was a bit too acidic for my liking.
-Clam linguine: it was tasty but the white wine sauce was basically... Oil sauce. They fried it with thick bacon bits that oozed oil all over the linguine.
-Shrimp and lobster tagliatelli: this was much better than the clam linguine. The sauce was just the right amount of sour, the tagliatelli was chewy, and the shrimp was cooked to perfection.
-Grilled branzino: probably my favourite. It tastes light and smoky, and the meat was firm.
-Dinner rolls (free, but worth mentioning): they were surprisingly great! Super crispy on the outside and soft and warm on the inside.

Price: personally I think it's quite expensive for the quality of the food."}
{"text":"I just received the worst service I've ever experienced. I wish I could give this zero stars.

I called in to make a simple takeout order. When the person picked up the phone, I asked to make a takeout order and was asked to be put on hold right away. Then, I asked whether the oyster special was available for take out. She didn't know the answer, so she asked and let me know that it's dine-in only. I started placing my order: scallops, fish and chips, and mixed seafood pasta.

At every stage of the ordering process, there was a snag. 

I asked for the scallops, and the person on the phone kept asking me to repeat myself. Then she asked me to give her the full name of the dish. Whatever, it was no big deal to give her the full name, but I shouldn't have to give her the full name (shouldn't you know your own menu? There's only one scallop dish). \"pan seared dry scallops,\" I said. She struggled to find it. Eventually she advised that the item is actually no longer on the menu and that I must be looking at an old menu. I asked how I could access the new menu and she said it was on the website. I was on the website at that moment and she didn't bother to go on the website to check that she was wrong. She suggested that I order the scallop risotto instead. Fine, I'm flexible.

I tried ordering the fish and chips but found out they were for lunch only, even though if you go to this page (http://dianasoysterbar.com/menu/) it shows as a main. Let me point out that if you go to this site http://dianasoysterbar.com/menu/dinner-menu/ it's a different menu, but still apparently an old menu. 

Ok, fine, I'll order something else. I was being patient.

Next I tried ordering the seafood mixed pasta, but that was also no longer on the menu.

So...what IS on the menu???

I ended up choosing completely different items that were on the menu just because I wanted to get this over with. I had been on the phone for over 8 minutes at this point.

She took down my name and number, and then asked for my credit card number before even letting me know the total. She said she needs my credit card number just in case, since it was such a big order. I advised that I would be paying in cash, I'd be there in 20 minutes, and that I would like to know my total. I was put on hold again. I didn't realize the total would be as much as it was (since there are no prices on the online menu, not that the online menu was very useful anyway. I didn't expect the scallops to be over $30 since I originally wanted just the appetizer scallops and she didn't give me any prices of the new items that I had ordered instead of the discontinued items. I cancelled two items and she still insisted that I give my credit card number because apparently in the past people have ordered and never shown up. That's not my problem. I would understand if the dollar amount was higher, but after I had taken 2 items off my order, the total dollar amount would have been maybe $40, maximum. 

At this point I had been on the phone for over 10 minutes. It was a painful experience from start to finish, and instead of trying to get her to take my order without a credit card number, I decided to cancel all my items and take my business elsewhere.

This was my first experience with this restaurant and needless to say, I do not recommend it, and I will never try ordering from there again."}
{"text":"Decor and space is a much better upgrade from their Scarborough location. However, I do feel the service is better at the old location. I don't blame them as the new location is new and the staff are likely newly trained. 

Came here twice, tried their daily special as well as their paella. I'd say their daily special was much better, so I will be trusting in their special menu from now on. Both times the daily menu was actually different from one another, so this is a pleasant spin on the otherwise slightly limited menu. 

As always I enjoyed their oysters but always a tad bit pricey compared other restaurants. Also they do not do bulk order pick-up for unshucked oysters at this location."}
{"text":"NO LIQUOR LICENSE yet (means they don't serve alcohol).

GRAND OPENING OYSTER SPECIAL: $15/ 12 MALPEQUE & $20/ 12 FANNY BAY.

I expected better to be honest. The interior design and cleanliness is good but all else seems to be lacking. They did open 4 days ago (Nov 30 2015) but considering the had a location opened in Scarborough for so long ... they should be more prepared.

Service is not the greatest, putting aside new wait staff and new busser's clumsiness ... the things that the waitress said to us was a bit unintentionally offensive and silly. (Ie. Table if 4, they take away our utensils, comes back with food i had to ask for my utensils because it wasn't apparent to them that we didn't want to eat with our hands .... then when I ask for utensils they asked us how many sets do we need .... really? ... And the other time they asked if we're full do we want to order more food, we said ya were okay now, they said ya off then bread ... why because I didn't order more food off your menu? That's rude.)

We ordered malpeque and fanny bay oysters, steamed clams, paella and mixed grill. 

Food was good. Oysters were fresh. Sauces were nice (yellow is spicy and made in house). Paella was a bit cold. The clams and the broth was delicious.

But the service was really not quite there for me to suggest this location yet maybe In time when they get better. 

Their credit debit machine is preset at 5%/20% gratitude so if that's not what you want to pay, press other. 

Overall I'd still come back for the oysters."}
{"text":"I've been here twice- once for lunch  and once for dinner (both on weekdays). I've been impressed both times with the level of quality & taste of their seafood. You can tell it's fresh and not frozen, as it should be for a seafood bar. As a seafood lover I believe the prices are justifiable, they aren't that high to begin with. Lunch menu is very affordable & I wish they made the lobster/crab roll avail during dinner! That would really be my only \"complaint\", to have their lunch items available during dinner as well. I would highly recommend the lobster& shrimp fettuccine (can't remember exact name), lobster roll and the clam chowder, delicious. I wouldn't say the service is outstanding but waitresses/waiters have always been very friendly & done what they had to do. Great ambience, definitely a more high end feel & quite a random location. Overall great place, I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"We came here for my daughters birthday. 

Oyster selection was great and extremely fresh. 

Good fish selection all fresh, nice large portions. 

Preparation was good but not very inventive. More or less prepared the way I would make it at home . I don't know about you but when i go out for dinner I want something I would not or can not prepare myself. 

Although dinner may have only been a 3 star I give this place 4 stars because of the amazing server we had. She took made great effort to not only explaining the menu in detail but also took the time to listen to all our questions and really find out what we wanted and made recommendation based on this info. She was extremely attentive in looking after us, something you rarely find in Toronto.  

Definitely a place to try if you like seafood and are in the area.   

P.S. Diana's Seafood Warehouse is Scarborough is likely the best place in the city to by fish."}
{"text":"Diana's is a mainstay of Scarborough and it's easy to see why, their selection of fresh seafood is expansive and they treat their product with great care and respect. There are always at least 10 or more different oysters/shellfish on rotation and you definitely want to partake. Decadent Fanny Bays, refreshing Kusshi, or the complex and meaty Cherrystone Clam will fill your tastebuds with delight. 

I often go for lunch, and they've got some good lunch specials! The lobster and crab roll is loaded with meat and you can get fries, soup, or salad with it."}
{"text":"Came here to try oysters for the first time. The waitress was really friendly and helped us pick the right sauces and wine to pair with the oysters. Ordered the fried octopus which we loved. The risotto was terrible. The seafood paella is really yummy, will definitely be back to try this again."}
{"text":"I took my wife out for a night of seafood, some place different, so I thought of trying out Diana's for a change! While waiting for our seats we tried out a mix of oysters and a drink at the bar right as you enter the restaurant, nice! When seated we started with the seafood appetizer plate for two(grilled octopus, shrimp, lobster, calamari , cheese and veggies) very good! My wife had for dinner, the pasta w. shrimp and lobster in a Brandy sauce, very rich but oh so good. I had the surf/turf which came with veal scallopinni, scallops, lobster, potatoes and greens. DELICIOUS! Dessert was a special coffee for us both, simply because we couldn't fit anything else in our stomachs. Phew! It was a little pricey so be prepared and don't be shocked, but overall a very nice night! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Service is good and so is their seafood.  Been here for a few times for lunch and dinner and never disappointed. They have good amount of oyster choices to choose and I like it.  Tried their soft shell clams as their special of the day, and it isn't bad. Really liked their lobster pasta dish.  Their paella is alright as I found it a bit too wet than the one I tried at Spanish restaurant. Overall, this place is good for seafood in general."}
{"text":"I had high expectations for this place but was slightly let down.  The fish was very fresh but my biggest knock was the high prices and the spices & flavors were just too mute for my liking.  I tried a sampler and the jerk flavor on the fish was almost non-existent.  Overall, not a bad spot for seafood but definitely not the best I've tried, especially at this price level."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVED this oyster bar. It was my first time dining here and for lunch we had 12 fanny bay oysters, a clam chowder, and mussels for appetizers. I could taste how fresh the oysters were and the clam chowder was thick and hearty! The cream sauce for the mussels was the icing on the cake. 
We also had the fish and chips which was great because it was lightly battered, the crab and lobster roll (AMAZING) and a tuna sandwich (I wasn't a fan of). I would definitely come back in the near future !"}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday dinner with my mom.
We made a reservation for a Thursday night, there was quite a number of tables filled considered it's a weekday.

We ordered a dozen of oysters and half a dozen of cherry stone clams.
Diana's never disappoints in terms of oyster and seafood freshness.
We both enjoyed the platter very much.

We also ordered the Diana's Paella, this dish was ok.. Had better paella's elsewhere.

I would just recommend coming here for fresh oysters/cherry stone clams/scallops.

The location in Markham has a nicer interior vs the one at birchmount and lawrence"}
{"text":"Location/Service
- Restaurant is on Woodbine Ave, north of Esna Park (right before Highway 407)
- Plenty of parking spaces available, there are other restaurants within the plaza, so can get slightly busy sometimes
- Very nice interior. Spacious, modern and good ambiance/lightning. They have a lounge waiting area, bar area and tables suitable for large groups (perfect for all sizes and occasion!)
- Staff are nice (including hostess and servers). Quick to provide assistance.

Food
- Oysters. Ordered a dozen and it was based on what's available for the day. Server provided recommendations. Really liked the ones from the East - Lucky Lime and Blue Point. Also had Fat Bastard from the West, I usually eat this - but this time wasn't as good. 
- Went with my family so we each ordered an entree. I had the Diana Oyster Paella. Was initially surprised with the portion size (seemed small), but it was filling enough for me. Seafood (mussel, shrimp and fish) were all delicious! Quantity was sufficient and it didn't have any 'salty' 'fishy' taste. The rice also compliment well with the overall taste

Overall experience is pretty good. It is slightly on a higher end in terms of price - so obviously I won't be coming here on a weekly basis. But I think if there's a special occasion (birthday, get together, dates), it's a perfect place :)"}
{"text":"Diana's Oyster Bar, on Woodbine, is the sister to Diana's Seafood Delight. They opened this restaurant in the beginning of December 2015. They say they are getting a few glitches figured out, but I think they are doing a fine job. At our table, we feasted on two different chowders, shared 24 oysters and had shrimp cocktail, tuna tartar, salmon and a shrimp linguine. Sharing a bottle of Savignon Blanc, reasonable at $55 for the bottle, there were no complaints from our table. Everything was the same excellent quality that we have experienced at the Lawrence Avenue location. The ambiance is fantastic. Although I love the donut shop reconstruction for the oyster bar at the original location, they have spared no expense in creating a lovely oyster bar. It is huge and holds a ton of oysters. I believe the price point here for fresh seafood is well worth it. Service was great. I can't wait to go back here again!

{"text":"Last night, our family of 4 (which includes 2 teenaged boys), went to Diana's for dinner based on a friend's recommendation and those from Yelp! For an appetizer, we shared the Grilled Calamari which was excellent! It was extremely tender, not chewy like most places, perfectly grilled and served with a tomato, caper and olive salsa.

For out main course, 3 of us had the Seafood Mixed Grill and one son had the Black Angus Striploin. The mixed grill came with 3 huge scallops, 3 medium sized tiger shrimp, and a smaller piece of salmon than I would have expected. This was accompanied with nicely grilled mixed vegetables and delicious crusted Pear William potatoes.  The portion was perfectly sized and couldn't quite finish it. My favourite was the shrimp, then the salmon and lastly the scallops but they were all by close. The shrimp and salmon were nicely seasoned, the scallops not so much ... but they were incredibly tender.

My son's Striploin was a generous portion and was well cooked, though a bit gristly in spots. He also added the poached lobster for $7, which was a complete waste of money since it was the size of one shrimp. I'd go with the tiger shrimp for $5 instead. 

The restaurant was nicely decorated and the staff were friendly. Overall, we enjoyed our dinner and will definitely come back in the future."}
{"text":"Seafood pasta was amazing and the service can be a hit or miss. Love that they have a bar and you can watch them handle your food/shuck oysters. Great ambiance for a weekend for two or a couple friends. Not bad oysters and would definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"Smack dab in the middle of Scarberian strip mall purgatory is not exactly the place you'd expect to find a seafood restaurant. But Diana's comes by its location honestly. It stands in front of the seafood store that is its parent. The patio was surprisingly pleasant despite the buzz and rumble of Lawrence Ave traffic. We were eating light - littleneck clams in a garlic fennel wine cream sauce, half a dozen raw oysters (Kushi, French Kiss, Malpeque), beer-battered fried Fanny bay oysters a la Rockerfeller, a glass of Hillebrand riesling and a shared CrÃ¨me BrÃ»lÃ©e. The oysters were delicious, sea-smacked morsels of marine delight. The Fanny Bay Oysters Rockerfeller were excellent - but more nice pub than fancy seafood. The clams were tasty too but what could have been a delicate sauce came out a little briny - oversalted. The creme brulee was satisfactory. It was a surprisingly pleasant meal with attentive service and the food was solid if not inspired. The next time I'm there I'll try some grilled seafood and see how they manage that."}
{"text":"My rating is based on a recent experience on some of their main courses I tried. I did not order their oysters so I have no opinions on that. I loved their decor. It was really pretty and unique. The service was passable. No complaints. The food is where I felt was not justified by the price. The taste was just not there. The presentation and plating was good but I think they need to work on enhancing the flavor of their dishes as they have a small menu. Should you try it if you've never been. Yes. It is a pretty nice place in that pocket.  Would I go back?  No. I have tried better fish and mussels elsewhere."}
{"text":"This review is for the soft opening of this place. They officially opened on 29th Aug and are serving lunch for now. They don't have the LLBO licence and according to them should have it by the weekend. The outdoor seating area is huge and it lies in front of their old store.
Service was great and the server took his time explaining the menu.
I wanted to try oysters as its Diana's after all a name synonymous with good oysters in Toronto.
I ordered half dozen and let the server pick  them for me while I waited for my Yelp Eating Buddy (YEB) We had 2 Kusshi, Lucky Lime and Cotuit. There were 3 kind of accompaniments hot sauce, cocktail and Mennonite.
I am more of purists so just dabbed them condiments a little bit on 3 oysters just to try them and rest I ate with lemon juice and horse radish.Condiments were good too.
All the oysters were fresh and were close to perfection
Kusshi really stood out. 
So far 5 Stars for the oysters.
By this time my YEB had arrived and she ordered the same set for herself. She liked them as well and she is a connoisseur of oysters. 
For mains I ordered the lobster club and she went with the halibut sandwich. They arrived shortly. The sandwiches looked good. The Halibut was actually quite big. We split half and half so could try both items.
Lobster Sandwich was OK  with meat being great and sustaining the delicate flavour of lobster meat. The bread to meat ratio was off overall 3 stars
Halibut sandwich was good. Nice ratio for bread and meat, this sandwich is done just right (pan fried to perfection)
Negative so far was the side of Salad that YEB ordered and the fries were your run of the mill stuff. 
This is a bit of odd location for this kind of restaurant but I am sure it will get traffic when people get the wind of it.
4 Stars over all and 5 Stars if you want to try Oysters.
Wine list is ok with some wines in the 30$+  for the bottle and available by glass. Some in the 50+ range. I can't comment on the selection as I have to try them first.  
I will be back again for oysters."}
{"text":"Had a terrible experience with the manager, Daniel, at the Diana Seafood Restaurant Markham location...

We were a party of 4 and 1 baby, celebrating a birthday. We brought an ice-cream cake (Jamoca Almond Fudge) bought from Baskin Robbins, and asked the hostess to put it in the freezer for us when we got there.

At the end of the meal, we got the bill first instead of the cake. We had to ask the servers twice to bring it. When the cake finally came, it had a nice sparkler candle but we didn't get the usual happy birthday song from the servers. We shortly found the reason why. 

Our cake had deformed, it looked like shit, it friggin melted!! I called the same hostess I initially spoke with, and asked for the manager without telling her the reason. 

Manager Daniel showed up at our table, he asked us how we were doing, and then started telling us there's something wrong with our cake. We didn't say a word about what our complaints were, but he already knew! He said it must have melted on our way to the restaurant. I said I don't live that far. 

He went on saying it's their regular practise to look at the cake first, when it's received from the customer, and it was already melted, but they did put it into the freezer thereafter. I asked him why he didn't inform us then and why he's so defensive, he said it's not their responsibility because we brought the cake there. At that point he was getting upset, the birthday girl was getting upset and said if it's put into the freezer, it wouldn't have looked like that, perhaps the freezer is not working?! Manager Daniel then offered us to go check their freezer. (What's the point?)

We figured the conversation was getting no where, there were no apologies or anything, and instead we were being told it's our fault to bring a cake there. Manager Daniel walked away back to the bar at the back. From a distance he was seen talking to his colleagues, rudely finger pointing at our direction and all.

We saw our initial server at the end and told him the reason why we didn't leave a tip on the bill, we needed to voice our complaints to someone! We ended up giving him a tip in cash, as it wasn't his fault. During the conversation, manager Daniel came up to him angrily and pulled him to back and never returned. I guess he didn't want him to interact with us. Why would someone at a manger position do such a thing?

When we were leaving, manager Daniel stood behind the bar at the back, gave us a cocky smile and said have a good night from a distance.

This is not something we'd expect from your restaurant and have shared this experience on social media. Daniel needs to apologize to us for ruining our friend's birthday dinner and how poorly he acted!!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday and they have their Malpeque (dozen for $15) & fanny bay (dozen for $20) oyster special. Had two dozen oyster for our appetizer and they were very good.

Main entree I had the bouillabaisse($28) and it was delicious. It had muscles, clams, white fish, two fresh crab legs in the soup, and two garlic bread. Everything was cooked very well and was delicious. My party had the tuna tar tar which is like a tuna poke type dish, and the clam dish, overall pretty good.

We had the dessert trio and the lemon dessert was really sour, the creme brÃ»lÃ©e tasted a bit off, but the flourless brownie was good. I wouldn't get it again though.

The venue is actually very nice and modern, they have lots of tables and literally double the size of their Scarborough location. Our waiter was on point and he did amazing job, tall Chinese guy.

Overall I enjoyed this location better than Scarborough. We called ahead and made reservations and then said that they were booked at 6:30 but when we came at 7pm it was pretty much empty...not sure what happened there."}
{"text":"I came here with a date and it was pretty good. The food was great but the service wasn't up to par. The waitress took forever to come and take our order. It also took her a really long time to come and fill/refill our water glasses.

The menu is really cool. This restaurant features oysters from all over the world. They have a large selection of oysters available from both coasts. One ocean provides creamier oysters, while the other coast provides saltier ones. My preference was definitely the creamier ones. They were delicious. 

We also ordered lobster and crab legs. The lobster was fooled really well and the vegetables that came with it were great. I don't remember what the crab legs tasted like but I think they were good. I was there a month ago so I apologize for the lack of recollection. 

Allover, I would return to purchase a platter or try more yummy oysters. Hopefully the service improves."}
{"text":"Oooh, fancy! Came here with my family for my brother's birthday, and I think we did enjoy it. They are quite expensive so I would save the trip here for a special occasion.

I don't eat a lot of seafood but from my family's reaction, everything was quite top-notch. The highlight would definitely be their oysters. With many different kinds, you can pick and choose which ones you want, or get a whole bunch. The fish that I got was quite good as well, picked from their daily menu.

The decor was beautiful and elegant, befitting of a high end restaurant, but the staff seemed to be a little... confused? There didn't seem to be a whole lot of communication between staff, and it did give off a gentle 'chicken with head cut off' vibe. Something to work on...

Overall, an amazing night of food and wine, but once again, I would save the trip for a special occasion!"}
{"text":"Ok, I'm not an oyster connoisseur. I mostly enjoy fanny bay oysters from the hotpot variety and the baked oysters from izakaya places. I decided to start exploring different kinds of oysters to see what I've been missing. I've heard good things about Diana's Oyster bar, so I decided to try.

My friend and I ordered the 12 malpeque oysters for $15, and I added 2 kumamoto and 2 kusshi oysters because I heard that they are good. The one that I think was kumamoto was good, but kinda pricy. At $4.20 an oyster, it was really fresh and tasty (it's like I could taste the ocean), but it was also very small (see pic). The kusshi (2.90 an oyster) were good too. The malpeque oysters were decent.

I also ordered the Oyster Rockefeller. That was basically a baked fanny bay oyster. 3 oysters for 13 bucks. I think I enjoyed this more than raw oysters. I really wish they had more cooked oyster varieties.

My friend ordered the Fish Sampler Trio for $33. It was basically a small piece of halibut, BC Snapper, and Mahi Mahi (probably about 100g each), with a little bit of potato, rice, and veggies. When he first received it, he thought \"that's it for 33 bucks?\" He enjoyed the halibut the most, but the rest were only okay.

One thing about service was that it was okay. When we almost finished our meal, we looked around and saw that other people got bread before their meal. My friend said \"we didn't get any bread?\" Lol we should have asked for the bread, because after spending 100 bucks on our meal for 2 people, I was still kinda hungry.

Service was quick, but friendliness were kinda meh, and we felt we were kinda being rushed.

So after today, I probably won't return here for more oyster adventures. Nothing wrong with the food, but I found that raw oysters is probably not for me. In general, prices were also a bit expensive and the cost exceeds value of the food. But that's the cost of going into unknown territories!

I'd rate this 8/10 for quality, 4.5/10 for value, 6.5/10 for service. 6.5 overall (not an average)."}
{"text":"Came here yerterday evening at around 8 pm for party of 5. We ordered two dozen of oysters, the seafood appetizer, and two paella to share. The service was amazing and so was the food! Would definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"Great space and tastey oysters, but service was very mediocre. Food took FOREVER to come out. We came as a large group, so I understand how things can be tricky for coordinate. However, it shouldn't take 20 minutes for raw oysters to come out when then entire restaurant is essentially empty. At least they gave us bread. 

I guess I'm also picky, and cranky coz I'm so frigging hungry waiting for an hour for my main dish, but it really annoys me when the server doesn't keep track of who ordered what properly and gave my wine to my neighbour, or brings out a dish and asking the group who ordered this. Like I'm supposed to remember what weird name oysters I ordered?! 

The more I write the more anger and hungry I get. It's been 1:50 since our sit down time, and I'm still waiting for my main. 

Will post again after I actually eat.

----------------

OK. 2 hours later, finally got my artic char lunch special. It was done to perfection, and was very good. Or maybe I'm so hungry that anything would taste good at this point. 

To the server's credit, she brought us bread and made sure our water was filled throughout the 2 hour wait. I guess the kitchen is slow or understaffed. 

Anyway food wise, great restaurant, but my personal first time experience was something else. I'd be willing to try again with a small group."}
{"text":"This place is hella expensive!!! With that price, I was expecting something good! But noooooo!!! I ordered a plate of seafood grill or something and it was $40! There are sooo little food it was only enough for a baby! And its main dish! the food didn't even taste good! and it was REALLY SALTY!!!! YUK! is salt really that cheap you just sprinkle it everywhere??? the shrimp i can taste is not fresh, it's frozen. I mean with that price i would expect something fresh...  it was not worth the price!!! And there was a potato to fill up the plate. I didn't pay $40 just to eat a potato!!! It's a seafood plate!!! Will never go again!!!!"}

If you live in Scarborough and like seafood get over there ASAP. If you don't live in Scarborough and like seafood... Get over there ASAP!"}
{"text":"You get what you pay for. 

Fresh seafood and amazing mussels. 

But you can pass on the special wraps they have on menu. They are meh."}
{"text":"I have been buying seafood at Diana's for years now, which is the best spot in Scarborough, by the way, and we finally decided to eat at the restaurant.

The dÃ©cor is nice, modern, clean, comfortable, but not very high end. Still, it has some nice features such as clean bathrooms, music that is not too loud, and comfortable seating.

As is was our first visit we opted for the cold appetizer platter, the hot sampler, and a selection of fresh oysters. The cold platter came with some jumbo shrimp cocktail, a squid and octopus salad, smoked salmon, smoked trout, and tuna tartare. The hot sampler came with some grilled shrimp, grilled scallops, and a piece of grilled salmon atop a bed of mixed grains.

You know how you find that little place on the coast that serves up some perfect seafood  - fresh, perfectly cooked, and redolent of the locale? Well, Diana's is one of those places. The seafood was perfectly cooked, not just well done, but to the nanosecond of perfection.

The shrimp cocktail offered some truly large shrimp that were full of flavor, served with a cocktail sauce made with real horseradish. The tuna tartare was a revelation - high quality diced tuna, marinated in sesame oil and topped with a tomato and pepper garnish that served as an erstwhile ceviche, I wish I could have this every day. The squid and octopus salad was fantastic - served with seaweed and high quality kalamata olives, the octopus and squid were as tender and flavourful as I have ever had. The smoked salmon and smoked trout were wonderful, with the capers, red onion and sour cream they were perfect on the fresh bread and mode a wonderful side by side comparison of fish and smoking techniques.

The large, fresh sea scallops were perfectly grilled to maximize the flavor yet retain the juiciness and soft texture scallop should have. Ditto for the grilled shrimp - simple, pure flavours enhanced by grilling without burning or drying them out. And the salmon fillet? After 15 years of living on the west coast and having salmon as a daily staple, I didn't expect to find perfectly cooked salmon in Toronto, but there it was.  As my wife said, it is hard to cook salmon that perfectly - it flaked apart, with perfect grill marks and no drying, burns or inconsistency - perfect.

The selection of oysters were top notch. My server provided a selection of East coast and West coast oysters for comparison and flavour journey. Regardless of which ones you personally prefer or dislike, they were all incredibly fresh and expertly shucked with almost no irritating shell fragments. Served on a bed of ice with the appropriate garnishes, they were the equal of that other great Toronto oyster bar, Starfish. 

My one pet peeve with Diana's would be the wine list - while well thought out and with very good value, it isn't very extensive, and there's only one bubbly.

I highly recommend that you make a reservation as the place fills up regularly - those in the know know that the food here is definitely worth the price.

Best seafood dinner I have ever had in Toronto!"}
{"text":"5 stars for service and the amazing food we enjoyed today.  

Oysters were amazinnnggg...we had our entree then ordered more.  Winston, hope I spelt his name right, offered great tips and suggestions.

The lunch avocado and shrimp linguine was slightly salty but yummy.  The octopus salad was perfectly charred.

Yum!!!"}
{"text":"Had heard many good things about this place.  So perhaps my expectations were too excessive for the experience.   One of those places that is good to try out, but don't think it's a repeat go-to for me.   I had the catch of the day which was a snapper and also shared a plate of various raw oysters and another seafood platter.  Thought the food was fresh and the preparation was fine.  Service was friendly and efficient enough.   But overall it was just ok."}
{"text":"Very delicious food, fantastic service.

I came here for a Father's Day dinner with my family. We ordered a dozen oysters at the recommendation of the server, who was able to describe all of them very well. We had Colville Bay, which were very very tasty, and Fat Bastard, which were big, meaty and very seawater tasting. Not unpleasant, but I liked the Colville Bays better. The oysters will run you a couple of bucks apiece, give or take. They came with a variety of sauces and fresh horseradish and lemon. Tasty!

For an appetizer, we shared some crab cakes which were dairy-free and very very good. They were huge, which makes the $12 price tag a little less painful.

For the main meal, I had the sea bream, which was tasty, but riddled with a zillion tiny little bones. Usually not a problem for me, but these bones were tiny and short, which became kind of annoying because it slowed me down. My brother had the sea bass, which was meaty and buttery all at once. Very good (but not as eco-friendly, mind you). The older family members split the sea bass, the grouper (on special) and the large seafood platter, which was gigantic. The grouper was very tasty, as was everything on the seafood platter (which I got to sample). The scallops were huge and very flavourful, and the calamari was grilled just right. Just a tiny hint of chewiness and great grill flavour. I could see myself ordering the big platter on a date and just going to town with my partner. Too bad the Hubster isn't a big fan of lobster (wait, maybe that's not so bad at all...)

My only complaint is the lack of variety of sides. Everyone got the same cold (chilled?) lentil salad pilaf thingie and grilled veggies. I wasn't a big fan of it.

Service was friendly and patient, more so than I ever could be with my family.

The place was super busy when we got there, and a mix of casual and trendy. Not really a place for a quiet, intimate, romantic dinner.

Parking is VERY limited. MAKE RESERVATIONS!"}
{"text":"big restaurant to accommodate large groups. Have been to the original dianas seafood on lawrence ave E & can ensure quality and taste is better there. This markham location is closer for me however - been here several times. Generally really slow service - food is ok but inconsistent quality/taste from my experience. Wednesdays are half price oysters i believe which is a nice deal!"}
{"text":"Only one star given for our server, who really did his job; but WORST MANAGER I ever encounter in my entire life!!! We came here with 4 adults and 1 baby for a BIRTHDAY occasion, yet our dinner ends in a dissatisfactory manner! We brought the ice cream cake to the restaurant and clearly stated to put in the freezer. When the cake comes out, its melted. We asked to speak with the manager Daniel, to inquire why the cake is melted since we asked to put in the freezer. Before we begin conversation with manager, his first sentence was \"The cake was like that when it came in, we open up and it was like that (melted), maybe its your car problem?\" REALLY? Then we asked if the cake really melted when first came in, then why wouldn't someone let us know?\" Manager said he thought its like that. REALLY? A MELTED ICE CREAM CAKE IS NORMAL? And that you wouldn't inform your customer?!?!? During the conversion, there is absolutely NO APOLOGY! And Manager said why should he apologize when the cake was melted already. REALLY? When your customer find dissatisfied service and you as Manager DO NOT APOLOGIZE AT ALL? I would have to say, yes its our fault for picking DIANA SEAFOOD MARKHAM location. The food was even average except for oyster. NEVER AGAIN WOULD I COME HERE! And i would never recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This is my 4th time at this restaurant.  I'll have to say they're almost as good as Rodney's.  But, it's not there yet.  Their menu was great, lots to choose from.  The servers were really friendly.  I ordered the Thursday night special, it was $12 for 12 oyster and cherry and live scallop on the side.  The oysters were okay, but if you do go and see live scallop on the menu, you'll have to at least try one.  It's so sweet and delicious!!! The seafood platter was impressive when it arrived and the server was nice enough to remove salmon from the platter for me (not a fan of salmon ...:( ).  However, the seafood was a little on the burnt side, especially the calamari.  And the location is a little inconvenient for me, perhaps, If they have it closer to the highway exist or in Richmond hill, Downtown or Markham that would be great.   

So I'm giving this restaurant a 4 star only because of its location and the food can use a little bit of fine tuning."}
{"text":"When we arrived at Diana's Oyster Bar & Grill after 8 p.m., we waited in front of the hostess table.  No one acknowledged us for a long time.  It seemed like all of their servers were busy and no one was catering to the hostess table.  We waited for quite a while that we finally decided to sit down on the chairs in the waiting area.  Soon enough, someone finally acknowledged us and brought us to a table.

There were a lot of people dining on a Friday night.  We opted for some drinks to start.  I got the Chocolate Martini (2 oz) and K got the Riesling (6 oz).  To my disappointment, the portion of drink in the glass was really small.  I'm sure it wasn't the allotted amount.  There's no way that K's drink didn't even reach higher up the glass...  Mine looked like it had more volume and mine was supposed to be only 2 oz; a third of his!

Since we were at an oyster restaurant, we wanted to try their raw oysters.  However, their oysters were priced ridiculously so we only got two pairs of oysters to try.  The oysters were very fresh and quite good but the sizes of the ones that we chose were on the small size.

We ordered the Grilled Calamari appetizer to share.  It was \"calamari marinated in olive oil, thyme, rosemary, garlic, and serrano pepper for 24 hours, grilled, and served on tomato-basil sauce with fresh spinach\".  It was very good!  It was a moderately small portion size though.  I liked that the calamari was very tender and not rubbery at all.

The Diana's Paella dish was minuscule for an entrÃ©e portion...  It had \"Black Tiger Shrimp, chorizo sausage, mussels, clams, assorted fish, and saffron infused Italian rice cooked in fennel-tomato fish broth\".  It looked great and the quality of the dish was really good, however the size of this $32 dish was not justified at all.  I really liked the firm black tiger shrimps, calamari, mussels, and clams.  The saffron infused Italian rice was also really tasty and soft.  Again, this portion was so small!  After finishing the seafood on top of the rice and a few spoonfuls of rice, I could see the bottom of the dish. 

Overall, their dinner prices were very expensive and their portions were small.  Thus, even though the tastes and flavours were wonderful, I can't see myself coming again for dinner -- my wallet would cry too much.

Also, our male server seemed kind of snotty that night; not the friendliest and seemed judgmental of what we ordered."}
{"text":"Came here on a weeknight with my husband for his birthday.  I had made reservations but needed to change the time but they had told me there was no reservations made for me, disappointed about the mishap but was able to remake second reservations.  

The restaurant was very spacious and big with comfortable seating.  The ambience was quite nice considering for Markham vs your trendy incomparable downtown Toronto restaurants. 

Our server was nice, green though and lacked in service when we made conversations with him asking him about who Diana the owner was and he unsocially and awkwardly didn't give much of an answer?

I give the food a mere 3 stars: 

1) seafood platter for 2: the scallops were fresh and tasty, the rice pilaf were extremely bland and I mean it didn't even have any taste, the crab legs were overcooked, grilled octopus was good at first but became very chewy only after few minutes or so, lobster was chewy, shrimps were fairly large in size and good in flavour but this dish definitely did not meet expectations especially given the price point. 

2) shrimp tagliatelle: flavourful and very rich in cream and shrimps were good sizes but tagliatelle overcooked.  My personal preference is al dente a MUST for pasta. 

3) trio oysters: unsuspected and unexpectedly delicious as we aren't big fans of raw oysters so this appetizer was a great alternative as they are cooked. 

4) fried calamari: very disappointing in the portion as it was way way way too little.  In the photo I posted there seemed to be about 10-12 pieces?  Come on?!?!

It was something different and our first time coming here because we were sick of the heavily populated Asian restaurants in Markham; however, this definitely failed to satisfy the palate and we won't be returning."}
{"text":"Really love the new location. 

Ambiance: more modern and after work happy hour to go.

Price: on the decent medium range for seafood and wine

Service: feel free to look and pick your oysters and she'll fish. They were pretty attentive until it got busier.

Parking: on site and easy to find. 

Food: must try the catch of the day and oysters menu."}
{"text":"5 stars:

We were seated in the patio for dinner tonight and had a lovely experience. I haven't been much I into oysters, but now I'm sold.

Oysters: 5 stars: We tried the malpeque (from PEI), and the fanny bay (Vancouver island). We were told that the oysters from PEI were saltier, and the west coast oysters were creamery. Personally I loved the east coast (PEI) oysters the best. I also really enjoyed how the oysters were very large in size!

Clam chowder: 5 stars: honestly it was one of the best clam chowders I have ever had. Bowls are also pretty big, and definitely shareable with two people.

Appetizer platter: 4 stars: 4 of us shared the appetizer platter- had smoked salmon, calamari, octopus, greens, avocado and olives. However I felt like it was pretty small for a platter.

Paella: 5.5 stars: this was my favourite part of the meal. The paella was loaded with mussels, clams, crab meat, large shrimp. It was delicious.

I would recommend anyone who comes here to share all meals. Everything we tried was great, and it was nice to be able to taste a bit of everything."}
{"text":"Upon arrival, the decor is really nice and modern. However, the hostess could have been more pleasant when she saw us.  The server for us was great except I had to request for our bread. Food took a while to reach us but it was pretty good. The black cod dish was really tasty. My husband had the deboned snapper which was OK....a bit dry. Overall, the experience was nice but could always improve. Probably would visit again but we'll see."}
{"text":"Booked mothers day reservation and still had to wait an hour for our table. The greeter was very poor in communication as she just kept repeating that our table will be ready in 15min. It was actually what she told every customers who were waitinf. The more customers were being backed up, the waiting area was packed with very unhappy customers. 

Bottom line is..if you have an important event don't book at Diana's!! They will mess up your event."}
{"text":"**1/2 stars

Diana's Seafood is located on Lawrence Avenue between Birchmount and Warden.  With a restaurant and storefront, you cannot miss the blue canopy that hovers over their patio.

The interiors remind you of a shoddy imitation of Harbour Sixty with portholes and swinging doors.  Unfortunately attention to detail is lacking as black and white photographs were hung without the use of a leveler (maybe we're on a sinking ship, in which case I may have just lost my appetite), coffees came without spoons or stirring utensils, and a pen not provided for us to sign our receipt.

While I appreciate that the owners at Diana's Seafood have taken a risk and tried to bring higher end dining to suburbia - there is much to be learned at prep school before they reach that level of sophistication.

You walk in to the bar and oyster station as the restaurant opens up towards the rear to a small sitting area.  I can't help but think of poor restaurant design as the layout made for a lot of wasted space.  There is a covered patio, but I wouldn't want to be stuck out there in the dead of winter.

The menu is a single, double-sided laminated page with food on the front and beverages on the back.  A specials page is also provided.

I opted for a glass of Riesling (6 oz - $8) while my dining companion opted for a Heineken (.  My word to the wise - skip the wine here.  The Riesling was undrinkable, and after a few initial sips I abandoned ship.

To start we ordered the Sea Urchin ($14) which is served atop taro crisps and a slice of cucumber.  Sea urchin is one of those things that fall into the \"acquired taste\" category.  It is extremely creamy and rich in texture, with a slight bitter after taste to it which may turn some people off.  I thought the taro crisps were a great textural contrast.

We also ordered a mÃ©lange of oysters: Fanny Bay, Kumamoto, and Kusshi.  This was served with your choice of 3 sauces: vinaigrette, spicy cocktail sauce and Scotch Bonnet.

Diana's Fresh New England Style Clam Chowder ($8) underwhelmed.  It was creamy, but lacked any real clam flavour and had a few scant vegetables in it.

The Seafood Mixed Grill ($31) consisted of scallops, Black Tiger shrimp and grilled Atlantic salmon.  The scallops were lacking a seared crust, though cooked to the right consistency.  The Black Tiger shrimp were naturally sweet and the star of the three.  The salmon was flaky, though the outsides were a bit dry - I personally like my fish with skin-on to get that nice crust on the outside.  This was served with panko-crusted Pear William Potatoes and seasonal vegetables.  The potatoes were fluffy and creamy, and definitely more interesting than your usual mash.


To end off the evening we opted for the Apple & Pear Crumble ($8) which was also nothing to rave about.  The crumble topping was bland and the clumps were too big, but the filling with aromatic cinnamon was quite yummy.

V E R D I C T

All in all, I would have to say I was disappointed with my experience at Diana's Oyster Bar & Grill.  The service could've been forgivable if the food made up for it, but both were mediocre. The meal rang in at $111, which at that price, I could think of dozens of more memorable dining experiences than tonight's.

I left with the thought that I would come back for the oysters, but seeing as oysters require no cooking - that's not saying much."}
{"text":"This place is fairly good, however, it's pricey. I'm surprised it's taken me this long to check it out since I could basically walk here.. When it's nice out.. In the summer hahaha.
It's very nicely decorated. The food is delicious. The service was nice for the most part, although we noticed that we were never served a bread basket while other diners were.
It wasn't too busy, despite the Monday special of 12 Malpeque oysters for $15. We also ordered two lobster rolls, a lunch special for that day. It came with a coke slaw and a side of fries or clam chowder. We got one of each. The soup was creamy and the fries were more more like wedges, and really yummy! I didn't like the slaw as much, but my friend enjoyed it.
It took forever for us to actually get the bill. Once we finished or meals and the table was cleared of empty dishes, everyone sort of disappeared and when we did eventually pay and leave, everyone just ignored us. In a near empty establishment it seems a bit rude that no one would say goodbye. But maybe that's just me being a bit fussy about the little things haha. Overall a really good seafood place, despite the higher price points (but then, it is seafood after all)!"}
{"text":"Came for dinner to celebrate a best friend's birthday and brought in a cake. After mentioning my reservation to the ladies that greeted me at the door I handed them the cake hoping they'd keep it refrigerated until after we were done with our main courses. I was asked to open the cake which I found very odd. It was fine at the time since the restaurant wasn't busy yet, but I can't imagine having to have done so if there were more people at the door. Service was great and the waiters and waitresses were very knowledgable about the types of oysters and specials available. My friends and I all have slightly different preferences in terms of the flavour and size of oysters we liked so we asked for recommendations. I personally like oysters that are sweet, light, crisp and not creamy. Each of us ordered a dozen oysters to start and my dozen consisted of 4 Kumamoto oysters from Seattle Washington, 4 Kusshi from British Columbia, and 4 Raspberry Point from Prince Edward Island. I ordered the Grilled Chilean Sea Bass for my main and it was amazing. The sea bass was grilled to perfection and went really well with the miso sauce. I highly recommend this menu item. Although prices are a little high, the quality of the food and the freshness of the oysters make the dining experience worth it. Will definitely be back again."}

Came here for a big family dinner and actually don't plan on coming back. I only suggested this restaurant since the Oysters at the Diana's Seafood Market was so good. Unfortunately, this doesn't reflect well in the restaurant itself. The wine list selection is very lacking, and mediocre at best for the price being paid. They don't have the option to have corkage fees, so you can't even bring your own Wine, which is very unfortunate when you want to pair your own wine with seafood. A plus side though, they train their staff well and have decent customer service upfront. This won't reflect my overall rating since staff come and go here. I don't know about the manager himself(I assume it's the manager) though, he was pretty rude to my sister when she was asking pretty simple questions. Aside from that, the experience was alright. We did have a table of 14, but the lobster main came super late. Approximately 10 minutes after everyone had their dinner already. There was no way we could have waited for his meal, so everyone finished, but my Uncle. 

Food wise, we ordered mostly everything in the menu. The cocktail sauce for oysters were definitely good, so that's a plus, and the oysters were only okay. The ones at the store were better. Crab cakes are crab cakes, mediocre like everywhere, nothing ever amazing. Mussels in marinara sauce stood out and so did Diana's Panella. Nothing else stood out from my mind. I cannot suggest coming here unfortunately, but if you're nearby and craving oysters with no where else in sight, I guess come here?"}
{"text":"Disappointed in the food in general. May be I've been spoiled elsewhere and was lead down the path by others. I'll chalk it up to me having too high of an expectation."}
{"text":"EDIT: Okay after going back a second time, my experience was a lot better as there were different people working there. Service was 10x better than the first time, and the food was top notch. 



Food - Great
Service - Bad

Arrived on a Monday night to a semi-filled restaurant. The waitress who brought us in gave us a table with a chair missing, even though there was a better table right behind. Gave us attitude when we asked to change tables. Anyways, decided to see past it and made our orders. 

After we ordered and finished 80% of our food did we notice that every other table had bread and we didn't. Asked the waitresses about it and only then did they ask if we wanted any, and made it sound like we had to pay for it. I don't know why they didn't bring us any when we ordered like every other restaurant, but the inattentiveness and the attitude they had when we asked for things just made our experience unpleasant. 

To their credit, all the dishes we ordered were very good, especially the oysters which is what they're known for. Price-wise it's on the expensive side, but for special occasions I don't mind shelling out a bit extra for some decent seafood. But their bad service really discourages me from going back. Didn't ask how the food was, no smiles, just seemed like they hated working there. 

If you want to eat seafood, I'm sure there are plenty of better restaurants out there that have a decent selection and way better service."}
{"text":"Went on an improptu date with my boyfriend on a Monday. $15 for 12 oysters. Oh man... they were fantastic!! We sat at the bar and talked to Phil and William. We both had 12 oysters and a glass of wine. Unsure how the other food is... but I bet its delishious. 

These guys shuck oysters like its nobodys business. Theyve won a Guinness World Record for most oysters shucked by a team of ten last year. These guys mean business. They are knowledgable and friendly. 
We will be back here. Maybe even every Monday...."}
{"text":"To get a 1 star (only cause I can't give 0) from me is a pretty big fail. 

First off the service is super slow. We were a large party with kids, they probably should have thought to bring out the kid's food with the adult's apps. 
They wait for all the dishes to be served, thus making some meals lukewarm by the time you eat. 
They're also in the habit of serving the oysters first, so the hot mains take forever to arrive. 
We arrived and ordered by 7 and an hour later my 5yr old still hasn't received her meal. 
My clam chowder was lukewarm and had more carrots and celery than potatoes and clams. The soup at the original Diana's was much thicker and had more substance to it. One could actually be full on that there. Here not so much. 
The crab cakes and pan fried oysters were nothing to die for. (I added a lot of spice to make it taste anything but fishy). Probably because the crab appears to be canned. 
My daughter had the lobster ravioli. The pasta was al dente but there wasn't much to the lobster. It looked like something out of a can. 
One of our compadres had the lobster stuffed fish. Again not much by the way of lobsters. 

I don't think I'll be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Nothing short of fantastic!  The service was friendly and helpful.  The oysters (fanny bay) were delicious.  The Black Cod was amazing.  Nice clean atmosphere without the slightest scent of fish ... how do they do it?"}
{"text":"This is by far my favourite seafood restaurant in Toronto. Just got back from a trip to portugal and spain. Couldn't wait to come back and have some real fish. The striploin is also excellent when I am craving beef. My wife loves all the pastas!!"}
{"text":"This place is way too expensive for what you get .. Oysters are great but besides the Malpeque every one is around $3 and up.. We had 18 Acadian gold and they were pretty small... That's $53 right there.. Had fish and chips which wasn't that good...$25 which is nuts... They did use halibut but it came out way too dry... Haddock is what you use for fish and chips.... Much juicier... Calamari is incredible and was $13 which is acceptable... We had no drinks -- $3 for a fucking soft drink!!!?? .... Helloooo ... You guys are at Lawrence and Warden.... That's called robbery...
Anyways with 15% tip lunch came to $115 dollars...We're done with the restaurant... I'll walk 10 meters and go buy 100 oysters for $85 dollars and eat them like Julius Caesar all weekend long.."}
{"text":"It only took me 12+ years of living in the area to cross this off my bucket list. I went on a Tuesday for lunch, and to my surprise, there were quite a few diners, ranging from office workers to elderly couples to entire families and a few solo diners.

My mother and I decided to start with the Oysters Rockefeller ($13): 3 broiled oysters topped with bacon, cheese, spinach, and panko. The Fanny Bay oysters were quite big and had a nice crust to it, while still being gooey underneath. Our server offered us some dinner rolls as well, which came out lightly toasted, and was perfect for dipping into the oysters and soaking the remaining cheese.

For our mains, we went with the lunch specials of the day; my mother went with the wild Atlantic cod and chips ($17), and I went with the lobster & crab roll ($18).

I had the option of fries, soup, or salad with my meal and I had to try their clam chowder. The chowder was loaded with clams (as it should be) with the usual accompaniments of potatoes and carrots. The chowder was smooth and creamy, and topped with a few herbed garlic croutons, which alone tasted great, but was a bit overwhelming for the chowder.

My meal also came with coleslaw, and the coleslaw tasted much different from various coleslaws I've had. Diana's coleslaw tasted a bit pickled, and with a bit of a zing to it. I was not a fan. As for my lobster & crab roll, the ratio of lobster to crab seemed skewed more towards the crab side, but overall, it was nice and fresh. 

While it took me over 12 years of finally checking this place out, my next visit definitely won't be in another 12 years. Though I'm more likely going to visit the adjacent seafood market (which I ended up buying Fanny Boy oysters from) for their big selection of fresh (and inexpensive) oysters."}
{"text":"I've been to the other Diana's and this location keeps the quality of food and service. I came with family and we had oyster trio and crab cakes. Those are great. Plus the entrÃ©es are pretty good portion and very tasty. Not overpowering at all. I am definitely coming back again."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a friend's birthday for a quick bite and drink. While the menu was extensive, nothing really caught our eye. 

We opted for a dozen oysters, the appetizer platter, and a few drinks. 

Drinks were fine. We got ours promptly, while others had their drinks forgotten. 

The oysters were good. Decently priced and a good selection. The appetizer platter for two, at $28, I don't know... I just expected more. Two oysters Rockefeller, some smoked salmon pieces, one octopus tentacle, two pieces of seared tuna, and two pieces of crostini. Other than the oysters, everything was so plain. No seasoning was added to the octopus or tuna. Which made them just meh to eat. The octopus wasn't cooked well at all and was chewy and burnt tasting. The appetizer platter was served with an oily soy sauce or something that was on the cusp of disgusting. We had no idea what to do with it. 

Our friends got a bit of everything, from the seafood cakes, to tuna tartar, to the whole fish, and pasta dishes. Portion sizes seemed consistently small and our friends didn't seem all that impressed. 

Service was confusing. I think we started with the bartender and then he pawned us off to his coworker. Being in the industry, it makes me feel like he was annoyed by us or something, which I can understand, since our friends just ordering haphazardly. The one thing that made me laugh and roll my eyes is that gratuity is written on the bill at the bottom with the final total on the top in red pen. It looks incredibly unprofessional to have it written in. With the touch of a button, you can have the gratuity magically printed onto the bill. Amazing, right?! Another thing that they do wrong is they calculate gratuity after tax. I would have tipped 15% after tax regardless. But it's not right (or legal) to charge gratuity after tax."}
{"text":"Visited Diana's Oyster Bar and Grill last night for Monday night oyster special.  Overall I was pleasantly suprised how nice the interior of this restaurant looks.  As the restaurant is located on Lawrence (busy street) the outdoor ambience isn't the greatest, although the patio is a bonus in the summer, I think I would be annoyed by the constant roar coming from the cars.  The inside of the restaurant is very nice and modern.

On mondays, they offer 12 Malpeque oysters for 15 dollars which is a great value. The malpeque PEI oysters overall are smaller size, and not creamy, but overall very tasty.  This was the highlight of the meal unfortunately.

I tried the mussels in white wine sauce.  The serving size was small overall maybe 1/2 pound at most.  This was one of the appetizer items.  The mussels when brought to the table had a very pungent odor, which was very unappealing.  They smelled and tasted very \"fishy\" combined with a strange tangy sensation.  I did not enjoy these at all. As a mussel lover I was very disappointed.

My partner tried the catch of the day sampler which was pricey to say the least at 33 dollars. It included three types of fish:  trout, swordfish and halibut.  The portion sizes of the sampler fish were very tiny. In addition the halibut was overcooked. The sides that accompanied the fish included finglerling potatoes,  garlic rapini and brown rice.  The serving sizes were very small.  I think for the amount of money we paid for this plate of food, both the taste and size of the meal did not justify the price.

Overall I like the restaurant for the interior decor and their oyster special. As some of the prior reviews mentioned I would mainly go eat oysters, and forget about the other menu items unfortunately.  There are better seafood restaurants in the city, at comparable if not more reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I came here with my family in the hopes of trying something relatively new in a neighbourhood that we have lived in for a long while.
Walking in, I didn't really know what to expect but the decor was very beautiful. It set a really classy room and the paintings bring that out. 
Our waiter brought out our bread and water and asked what we wanted to order. As an appetizer, I got the pan seared scallops. This was the best meal of all. The salad had a good mix of flavours and the scallops were cooked perfectly. It left me wanting more since it was easy on the stomach. It wet my appetite for sure.
However, that was the best of the dinner. The wait for our food was atrocious. Our entrees took so long and I can't help to think that we were just forgotten orders. 
Our waiter offered us another plate of bread but we gobbled that instantly. We didn't want to fill up on bread. We wanted more than that though.
Another waitress took it upon herself to apologize for our wait. How come our waiter didn't give us that kind of attention?
I ordered the lobster and shrimp tagliatelle but once the meal came, I was rather disappointed. I waited for so long that I was hungry all over again but meal was lacklustre. There was barely any shrimp. The food left me feeling the opposite of what I felt for the appetizer. The lobster wasn't really cooked properly. It was hot in some places while chewy and cold in others. The sauce was watery though. The pasta was splashing about while I moved my fork to eat it.
That same waitress helped out once more and offered us free dessert because we had to wait so long for our food. We were at least glad about that when we went to get our bill but still had an underlying feeling that we were being ignored by our original waiter as he helped other tables.
Overall, I don't like how we ended up staying at a restaurant for four hours just to get our full meal and service just to have the food be unprepared. Our time at this restaurant should have been at least two hours and yet we came before the dinner rush and left way after it.
The place was also expensive too. It took really long to even grab our bill to pay. Normally, I wouldn't mind costs if it is an expensive restaurant but I do expect it to be worth the buck.
Needless to say, we left with a sour note about this place so I cannot recommend coming here unless you want to be really hungry and just wait around for the most part."}
{"text":"Having money means you can enjoy things that you thought were gross as a kid. Fish eggs, goose liver, raw oysters. Mm-mm! Rich people food. Raw oysters are probably the easiest to achieve. With buck a shuck and other deals, I can pretend to be fancy on my entry-level salary any day!

This restaurant embodies how I feel about oysters in general: just average people trying to be a little fancy on any given night. It's expensive, but not over the top (think the Keg). The decor was very pretty, with an impressive oyster shucking station in the middle, but it still had TVs playing sports and casual families that brought their babies. Diana's is probably the best place to enjoy oysters in Markham. Though they don't do buck a shuck, they do have promotions on certain days of the week. 

Let's talk about the main attraction: mounds upon mounds of oysters. We got east coast Malpeque ($1.95) which were a bit more flavourful in our opinion and west coast Fanny Bay ($2.25) which were creamier. I've never had 'creamy' oysters, so that was cool, but I still preferred the 'un-creamy' ones. Of course, we went for the cheapest ones on the menu, but there are oysters that go up to $4-5 a pop!

Entrees were delicious! Got the grilled and deboned sea bream with veggies ($28). It was a little bit oily, especially since they also give you a small container of butter, but very tasty. One complaint: upgrade your veggies to rice or potatoes for $4??? It's just rice or potatoes! It's not even both! That's way too expensive. Stick with the grilled veggies, they're awesome anyway. SO got the lobster and shrimp tagliatelli ($28). Not so much lobster, but big fat juicy shrimp. Pasta was nicely textured and the sauce was creamy and succulent. Key lime pie ($9) was limey and creamy. Alright slice of pie, but not really worth it at that price. 

Before this place popped up, you may have only seen Diana's as a booth at Night It Up with hordes lining up for fresh oysters. Fresh oysters at an open, blistering hot, market? Yes, it was questionable. But like their restaurant, it didn't disappoint. Consistently high quality, fresh seafood. So go ahead, take your date here! It's fancy, it's tasty, and you know what they say about oysters ;)

{"text":"Please only come here for the oysters and nothing else. Tried their appetizer platter just to try a little bit of everything on their menu. Just that dish alone made me regret ordering everything else. The only dish decent was their clam chowder soup."}
{"text":"Some highs and lows this first visit. The decor is much better than the other location. The dining room is large and modern however still a casual place with linen napkins but no table clothes. Oysters are excellent and good value being that it is a special on Tuesdays. Our other starter was a mixed seafood for 2. Octopus and smoke salmon was top drawer however the grilled squid was overcooked, cold and should never have been served. The main was 3 scallops on a bed of salad and was cooked to perfection. The other main was a lobster and crab roll more crab then lobster but tasted good. Would have been a great meal if thy got the grilled squid right.

The service was a little slow for lunch but we did follow a big group in. Our server did a good job managing everybody."}
{"text":"So finally had a chance to check out this restaurant.  When we walked in we were promptly seated as the restaurant was not full.  We sat down looked at the menus and placed our order.  Be prepared to wait a significant amount of time as it took nearly 1.5 hours to order and get our food.  With two young kids this is definitely a test in patience.  They started by giving you warm dinner rolls which were fresh and delicious.  We ordered the crab cake as an appetizer and you get two for $12 which seemed a bit steep, but they were the best crab cakes I have ever had.  I ordered the shrimp and lobster pasta.  After our crab cakes came out it took well over an hour for the entrees to arrive.  My pasta was a decent potion and was so delicious.  You could taste the lobster as they were generous with the amount they put in and the shrimp.  The sauce was a creamy saffron base and it was absolutely incredible.  The reason I gave it a 3/5 is that the wait times were way too long and it seemed severely over priced.  If you have the time it's definitely worth trying, but don't go if you are super hungry."}
{"text":"We are long time customers of the seafood store sharing the same name.  Diana's is known for supplying seafood to numerous restaurants in the GTA. The quality of the seafood is second to none as this is how the company established its self.  We have visited both the Lawrence and woodbine locations for their restaurant fare.  I have to admit that I am very disappointed and will not be returning.  I have tried their seafood platter at $ 135.00, I attempted to order the sea bass on another occasion to which I was told that the market value was to high and that they had substituted it for black cod, at $40.00, the portion was ridiculously small.  Really, a supplier of seafood.  In any event the portions in ratio to the prices are unacceptable and I will not be returning ever again.  I sure wish the fish house was still around to school Diana's on what a dinner portion should look like.  In any event I will continue to buy her fish at her market but will invest my hard earned money at other seafood restaurants other than hers."}
{"text":"Hi everyone ! Recently  been in Diana's Oysters bar and grill at Markham ( woodbine) location the worst experience  ever, even though it was my first time in this place ! We made reservation in the morning for 7:30pm and arrived on time , they said there is no tables so we had to wait 30 mins to be seated. Afterwards it took 20 mins our server to come and fill up our glasses with water ! Her name was Coco and she did not even say \" How Are You\" she directly ask \" what you want ?\" Which was very rude and unprofessional! Later we asked for a bottle of white wine , but unfortunately they said they run out of wine glasses and brought us some kind of small random glasses for shoots, so we had to use them to have wine ! Later we ordered Seafood mix Plate ! Our server came back to us and said that they run out of Potatos so we will not be able to have potatos ! In addition we got rice with our seafood plate , it was very overlooked and with  a lot of oil, we didn't touch it even ! So for the first date and first time the experience was very bad ! Server was apologizing all the time at the end but that's not enough comparing to service what we were getting ! I usually leave 20 % gratuaty on top off my bill , but this time I left 0 dollars and will never go there again !"}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday night, it was pretty empty when we first came in at 6, but around 7:30 when we left, more than half the restaurant was filled. The seating is very spacious and the atmosphere was modern.  

Near the back there was an oyster bar, a mountain of oysters on ice with labels indicating which oysters they were. 

We tried 5 different oysters. I went to the oyster bar to look at the oysters, and one of the ladies there was very knowledgeable to explain which oyster is popular and to find ones that fitted my taste.  

Got the malpeque, French kiss, raspberry point, fanny Bay and kusshi. I enjoyed the west coast ones much more as they were creamier and had more flavour.  The PEI oysters were light on flavour.  
I also got a live sea scallop which was very good! It was still moving when it was brought to our table.  It was so fresh with a squeeze of lemon.  

We also got a Diana's seafood paella.  It was quite a large portion with many clams, mussels when first seeing the dish.  There were 3 pieces of tiger shrimp, 2 crawfish, assorted fish within the mix, and Chirizo.  The rice was blended with all the sauce and seafood, and every bite was very tasty.  The mussels and clams were really fresh, and did not have any sand. 

The complementary bread was really good with olive oil and balsamic vinegar as a dip! We had to order seconds! 

I asked the waiter and oysters come in daily, and they have different assortments everyday.  

The oysters can be pretty pricey since they are sold per piece and not by the dozen or half dozen.  

Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised I haven't written a review for Diana's, this would be my 2nd most recent visit. First visit was when my BF took me here for Valentine's Day and it was superb (the service, the food, the menu all made the VDay amazing), totally recommend this place for fresh seafood while also knowing how to do a really good steak as well! Came here for lunch recently, their lunch specials are really good. Tried their oysters (dozen malpeque oysters for $15), lobster roll with clam chowder and coleslaw (which was served on a weird teacup plate). The service seemed to hoover around the older customers, because we were not given any bread during our wait for our mains. I had to request a spoon for my clam chowder, service seems to be a bit slow or picky/moody. 
Definitely can say it is pricy for lunch. But it's a seafood restaurant and they didn't cheap out on the lobster in the roll. 

You would not have thought much of this place if you drove by it due to the location of it. It is located next to their seafood store where my BF goes to buy fresh seafood/seafood stock. Prices can be high but you pick and choose what you want.

You get what you pay for! Will come back but probably keep it more for special occasions."}
{"text":"The seafood is so fresh. Had oysters and sea urchin special. The ambience is great with excellent service and nice modern decorations. 5/5!"}
{"text":"The oysters were not inexpensive but decent quality.  Ambiance was very good and service was average-very polite whenever we got their attention BUT we should not have the constantly have to ask for attention to get water or order (since I showed up after the rest of my family).   

The one item I wanted was the cod and unfortunately it was not available which was disappointing since I actually don't like anything else.   I ended up ordering the bruschetta appetizer which is very good.   

Average experience."}
{"text":"diana's, i don't know how i've only met you now. fresh seafood, totally off the hook.

12 for $12 mondays are a must. Succulent, creamy, and finger-licking good. I honestly didn't even like oysters very much until i visited here.

Fried calamari was also very good. and I also had the seafood platter which was nice - massive perfectly seared scallops made it totally worth it. 

Only problem is i came here like two weeks in a row.. and kind of got sick of it. I think oysters are something I'd eat once a while, but by no means in large quantities or too frequently."}
{"text":"I'm a seafood lover and found Diana's slightly disappointing considering the hype around it. I really enjoyed the oyster bar while I expected more from my main. I would definitely come back to try more appetizers and entrees but the prices leave a lot to be desired.


Came here on a Saturday night with friends and sat around the oyster bar. It wasn't too busy and we managed to get seats despite no reservations. But just a tip, do call in for a reservation. You don't really want to sit at the oyster bar due to bad service, more on that later.

We started off with a bunch of oysters and they were the highlight of my visit. We had malpeque, fanny bay, and shigoku oysters. They were fresh and delicious, and I could have ate some much more. I am even thinking of foregoing my entree do just eat the oysters.. They were all pretty similar but if you're keeping an eye on your wallet, you're better off getting the cheaper malpeque where the difference in taste probably does not justify paying more for the pricier ones. I was disappointed with my clam linguine, the pasta was very watery and overall rather bland. The clams were good though!

My night cost me nearly $50. I kind of expected better but I guess coming here on a special occasion would be okay.

Service was rather poor, we were served by the two guys at the oyster bar whose main job is to prepare the oysters and not serve us. We sat by the sink and we filled our own waters, and received bread at the end when we asked. 

All in all, not bad but value and service wisecould be better. I would definitely return here for the oyster bar!"}
{"text":"I went to Diana's in Markham before (after hearing good things about the Scarborough location) and was disappointed in the overall experience so how does the original location stack up? I can say that I enjoyed this location more; dinner was more polished and efficient but to be fair, the Markham location was probably sorting out their issues as I went few months from opening. I ended up giving both Diana's a three star - an overall solid but expensive seafood restaurant, that serves up great oysters. 

Atmosphere was more pleasant, and the service was fantastic and friendly (service was non-existent in the Markham location when I went). Food came out quickly and the servers will describe to you what you're eating. 

I really (only) enjoyed the oysters at the Markham location and it is no different here. The oysters were amazing, slurping heaven and were shucked well. We ordered a great assortment which included: karenbridge bay, kusshi, lucky lime, Marina's top drawer, blue point, and some scallops and clams. I'm no oyster connoisseur and couldn't distinguish most of the varieties but I can say that I really enjoyed the kusshi and blue point oysters the most. 

For the entree I had the sampler (fish) trio which was the 'special of the day'. It was a great way to try multiple items. I enjoyed the tuna (tataki) the most . The snapper and the sole? were great as well. The vegetables also complimented the dish and were crisp. Although unrealistic, part of me wish I came here   just for the oysters.

Value could have been more fair, subtotal for the dinner with tax and tip came in at $75 per person, which is pretty pricey considering the amount of food you get. But regardless, I will definitely come back to Diana's for some fantastic oysters. All in all, this location offers a more pleasant experience than the one in Markham."}
{"text":"Loved it!
Came for lunch, had lobster and crab roll lunch special... overflowing with fresh seafood! They are not stingy at all! Clam chowder was fantastic as well.
Not the biggest fan of the Buffalo Mozzarella and Smoked Salmon. Sounded great, but nothing exceptional.

Overall beautiful place, great fresh seafood! Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"As a seafood establishment that handles raw food daily, is it not a problem if you cannot even keep an ice cream cake moderately frozen for less than 2 hours????????????????????

********WORST SERVICE EXPERIENCE***********My friends and I had the most memorable experience here at Diana Seafood Bar and Grill - Markham location at Woodbine Ave. The food was alright; the environment was ok but the management service here was at the lowest level possible - TERRIBLE. I have worked at a restaurant and I've also worked at many places that requires customer services. Customers may not be always right but as an employee who works as a customer service, WE REPRESENT THE PLACE, THE MANAGEMENT AND THE BRAND WE WORK FOR. So raising your voice to a customer is a definite NO, CANNOT EVER DO. 
 
We decided to try this place to celebrate my birthday on July 10th 2016, reservation at 7:30 p.m. my friends were kind enough to buy me a custom birthday ice cream cake from Baskin Robbins and SPECIFICALLY told the host that it was an ice cream cake and MUST be stored in the FREEZER. Unfortunately, after 2 hours of enjoying ourselves with good chat, wine and food, at around 9:30 p.m. after we finish, the server who brought out the cake did not sing a birthday song like they do for birthday occasions or even say \"HAPPY BIRTHDAY\" at all. Instead they drop off the cake and immediately dash out of sight. We saw the cake and was a little concern so we ask the host if we could speak to a manager on duty. The manager came, Asian, male, mid 30s or even 40s (who knows, Asians have good genes) started off very defensively and starting defending himself and his staff that the cake was for sure in the freezer and that his freezer is perfectly cold and it was OUR FAULT for bringing a melting Baskin Robbin cake. Or that the cake melted on the way to their restaurant. 

FIRST of all, we have not spoken a word upon Daniel's arrival or even mention about anything to the host about why we wanted to speak to a manager. SECONDLY, we didn't even get a chance to SPEAK and the manager, Daniel Ho has already started explaining to us in the rudest and defensive approach ever that his staff and himself had nothing to do with the cake. He said \"Why do I need to apologize, I didn't do anything wrong\" and raised his voice during the communication and made a very uncomfortable and interesting scene for us and the other customers there; not that he really cares. 

This was supposed to be a happy occasion to celebrate but what ended the night was realizing that there are still people with management authority that does not value customer service. I'm not seeking for anything from this I purely just wanted to share my experience to other people and it's up to you to judge. I also want to apologize to the server who served us, he was great and kind and even apologize that this had happened when we gave him the tip directly; only he deserved it. I am apologizing because during our conversation with our server after the incident, the manager, Daniel Ho saw, and immediately pull the server away from us, brought him to the back of the restaurant where the oyster bar was and gave him a very hard time, talking to him while pointing fingers at our table. 

I understand that the Manager, Daniel Ho wanted to protect his restaurant and staff and didn't want to give us any discounts or compensation, just to be clear we were not looking for that nor did we needed that. Why would I even spend time writing a long review, I really don't have time to bad mouth a place because of a melting ice cream cake. Either way, Diana seafood should do a checkup at their Markham location's freezer because like I've be questioning, as a seafood establishment that handles raw food daily, is it not a problem if you cannot even keep an ice cream cake moderately frozen for less than 2 hours?"}
{"text":"Oysters were fat and juicy, grilled octopus was also delicious. We also got Diana chowder,lobster bisque,  and tuna tartar which we finished in no time.  The entrees took a while to come and we think the apps were much better.  We got the paella and clam linguine  which were just ok...the seafood in those dishes were yummy but the pasta and rice itself were mediocre. 

We came to celebrate mother's day and we brought some cakes that we've asked the server to bring out after we finished our entrees. That part took a while but to our surprise it was because our server took our cakes and placed them on a well decorated plate for us - we thought he would've just took the whole box out to our table."}
{"text":"First visit last night.  Service was very good.  Food delicious, but plain.  For the price, this place gets a lower score because of value for the money.  

Seafood chowder was good.  Traces of seafood.  $10.00

The special of the day was just okay.  A rather small piece of fish on top of a pile of pasta.  $32.00

Large Lobster with some type of sticky rice.  $88.00

I'd say everything was just okay.  Celebrating Mom's birthday and she was happy.  That's what mattered.  But wouldn't rush back for another try."}
{"text":"I am glad Diana's is finally in Markham and with a much larger dining area and much nicer too!  There is a lounge area beside the greeting desk for people to enjoy some TV while waiting to be seated, which i find it very neat and thoughtful.  Greeters are amazingly friendly and attentive.  Came here on two occasions already and I have to say, my second visit was much better!

First visit was on their first weekend after opening with a group of 6 which was fine until we waited almost an hour for the food to come, but given it was their first weekend since opening, it is understandable their kitchen and floor staff are in a little panic mode.  Second visit was on a Tuesday night which was much better, seated quickly, server was attentive and provided great recommendation and food came relatively quickly AND hot.  But I have to say, if you are looking forward to their hot food, this place is not your place to be, the hot food are just okay and are expensive, but the oysters on the other hand was amazing!! Lots of variety of oysters and they were all super fresh!

Verdict, if you want oysters, this is the place to be.  Tons of variety and very fresh, but if you do not like oysters and wants something hot, you may be better off finding another place to dine.  4 stars for great oysters and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to try this place out! My aunt was visiting and really want to try raw oysters so we decided to drop by this place for lunch. 

We ordered the soup of the day (I believe it was a ginger, carrot, and smoked fish soup), fish and chips, a dozen malpeque oysters, and a dozen fanny Bay oysters. Everything was very delightful! The soup was very flavourful and smoky, while the fish and chips was very fresh. But omg the oysters were fantastic and fresh! It was so good that we ordered another dozen fanny Bay just to top it off. Granted the price is a little steep but definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Half decent restaurant if you enjoy the company of lobsters and oysters (eww). My wife's decision since it was her birthday. Fairly good service with some fairly decent dishes. My wife did have a few oysters (eww). What stood out for me was the clam chowder which was very tasty...And the grilled octopus on our appetizer platter which was to die for! I've never had a chunk of tentacle that thick before! Yum! We were informed that there was a special dish of the evening...The swordfish with scalloped potatoes. That caught my attention so it was my choice for the main.  Delightful indeed but just a tad bit heavy-handed with the sodium on the fish. I may want to go back for lunch one day since we were told that lunch was the only time which you can acquire the lobster roll off their menu."}
{"text":"I love seafood and have always had a great experience buying from Diana's Seafood Market. So when this place opened up, I knew I definitely had to try it out!

Their interior decor is impressive. You can tell they spent time and money to ensure that their guests are comfortable. But I think if they took some of that and spent it on their staff and food instead, they would undoubtedly receive better ratings, across the board.

Our waiter had a bad attitude, was inattentive and practically missing our entire dinner. 

For apps, we got the Diana's Clam Chowder, House Salad, Fried Calamari, and Steam Mussels with Marinara Sauce. Overall, they were fine aside from the extra long wait time. 

All the mains were mediocre but without a doubt overpriced. The Grilled & Deboned Fish, Penne Ala Vodka, and Sirloin were standard. The Clam Linguine was bland, I would suggest trying it at the Scarborough location instead. The Surf and Turf included 2 scallops, 2 shrimps, an overdone small piece of veal, and 1 potato, topped off with cold gravy (probably from sitting there while waiting for other meals to be prepared). The Lobster and Shrimp Taglietti was the most disappointing. It is poorly named and completely lacked lobster, to the point where I had to track down our waiter to ask the kitchen if they forgot it. The response I received was that, there was no mistake and the lobster was the rice-size pieces of shreds on the plate. Given they label themselves as a seafood restaurant, I was unimpressed with their food. 

All in all, there won't be a second visit, that's for sure."}
{"text":"The one in Scarborough is 1000 times better. They kitchen struggles to keep up with the number of tables.  I get that hiring attractive people is part of the business, but having 4 hostess at the waiting area not knowing what the hell they're doing makes you look kind of silly. Most of the waiters are good, but one made a few mistakes with our order (which is fine, happens all the time) but the least you could do is acknowledge it or apologize and not act snobby about it. The food overall is still pretty good, including the oysters, but I rather drive further to the Scarborough location."}
{"text":"This is probably the best seafood location outside of downtown Toronto. I absolutely love the oysters, the selection is seasonal and my personal favourites are the Marina Top Drawer and Coromendal, and the person who shucks them is a PROFESSIONAL. The rest of the menu is also pretty good, but portions could be a little bigger. I rather drive to this further location than the one uptown. Never had bad service here."}
{"text":"???????????????markam??Diana Seafood????????????????????????ok,????????wifi???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"I'll start with the good. The service, ambiance, and restaurant itself was comfortable and welcoming. Diana's though is over priced and lacks quality where it matters, the food. The bouillabaisse had a strong taste of similar the seaweed that has been sitting in the sun for a day. The rest of the meal was average. Lacked season and pop. Overall the food lacked that something that makes it pop. If you are going to price yourself at the top of the market, then the food should match."}
{"text":"We've been here a couple of times for lunch and dinner now, and honestly, we've walked away each time extremely pleased with not only the food, but also the entire experience.  

We've tried the lobster bisque, clam chowder, crab cakes, baked pear and blue cheese dessert, their raw oysters and pastas.  I've got to say though, it's only their seafood that really stands out, so my suggestion to to go for their raw oysters, soups, and crab cakes and other appetizers in general, and leave the mains (pastas, meats). 

A fairly big caveat is that as far as I know, they don't take reservations, which can get annoying, especially if you want to bring along a couple of guests.

Prices are reasonable, considering it is seafood and most of the oysters are from out of country!

A suggestion though, if you're willing to sacrifice the experience, is to go next door to their fresh market and pick up products there (raw oysters, crab cakes, canned soups) and prepare the food at home.  It's /almost/ the same for a far lower price!

Overall, though, this is an amazing restaurant and I'd definitely come back here for their seafood!"}
{"text":"I like this place for the food. The service is helpful but I found that they made a few service mistakes that could of made my visit better.

First the food, oysters and tons of them. You know what would be good, a menu that lists the oysters they have for the day and a description on what they taste like. Their menu lists a bunch but just east/west coast, but I mean where they are from wouldn't really describe enough of what they taste like. Just a suggestion Diana!

The fried calamari is top notch. The crab cakes, hit or miss in my opinion.
The mixed seafood pasta is pretty good and offers a decent size and ingredients. The lobster roll is also a crowd pleaser!

The Soups, go with the bisque over the chowder.

And then the service, they are very polite and helpful. I called multiple times and they always were nice. My beef though is a few times while we were there we asked simple questions like \"where is this oyster from?\" and they forgot and then later claimed to have told us. Or forgot to bring other things. I'm sure it's case by case, but just my experience."}
{"text":"I liked the atmosphere and general setting of Diana's in Markham compared to the one in Scarborough. We were luckily able to get reservations for the Saturday (day before Mother's day) as most places were almost fully booked..we were a group of 4 adults and 2 kids. We were seated momentarily as soon as we arrived and when I advised we had reservations. It was quite busy, due to the holiday, I believe.

We were seated towards the back of the restaurant, close to the oyster bar, which was a nice scene to watch...the disadvantage of that table was that it was close to the washrooms..

W ended up ordering some oysters, calamari, seafood platter, and a few other items on the menu. The prices are acceptable when I put everything together in terms of the ambiance, service and etc..

If you have young kids, its a tad bit hard to come with them cuz we didn't want them to cry or nething and there were limited food choices for kids...they did have kids size items which is a smaller portion to the regular menu. We were offered that but the 2 kids with us were picky eaters..so we didn't end up ordering kids portions...

All in all, a place I dont mind coming back.."}
{"text":"It was ok. They are located in Scarborough. I dont know if it's worth the drive especially if Oysterboy and Rodney's is closer to me."}
{"text":"I just went here today for my dad's birthday and I was first to arrive. I asked the waitress nicely if they can do something special for my dad since it's his big day. She said I'll see what I can do and ask the back for you. She smiled at me - so that probably means there's a surprise coming at the end of the meal. Super nice !


So what we ordered today was the special for Tuesday's $15 for 12 oysters (malpeque or fanny bay). I found that to be pretty decent. It's not like your regular downtime buck-a-shucks but it's still not too pricey. They oysters were fresh and the sauces they provided were very complimenting. 

Then we went along with the apps: apps for two - grilled calamari, grilled salmon, smoked salmon, cypress salad and some greens and hummus to come with it. Tasty!!!!! Definitely enough to fill up two tummies. 

Entrees were the 2lb lobster which is Market Priced. And the Diana's Paella that comes with clams, mussels, chorizo sausage and Spanish rice. I found the rice to be too mushy for me. 

Then at the end, my dad got the free trio surprise - brownie with ice cream, creme brulee, and the lemon Phyllo pastry. it was all so delicious and I'd definitely come back again to try more dishes. 

I found that the price was pretty pricey but with decent portion sizes. I tried the seafood platter last time $135 and it was so huge and so good to order for 4 people."}
{"text":"The food we ordered was not bad at all.  The oysters are very fresh indeed.  However, the ambiance of this place is really lacking.   The service was ok but I just felt that it was a little bit too rush though our server was very polite.

I just find something is really missing in this place.  It might be the internal decoration, the table layout, or the a little too bright lighting.

Besides, i suggest the restaurant replace their too tiny stainless Steel teapots with a larger and better quality one."}
{"text":"We have been here too many times to count and the food and service are impeccable. If I have a craving for seafood this is out go to spot."}
{"text":"Came here for my sister and my dad's birthdays last year. We've visited the Diana's in Scarborough along Lawrence ave before and quite enjoyed our experience there. Now with a location a little closer to home, it's nice to pop by for a seafood dinner. Summary up front is that the food is good and service is friendly, but prices are a bit up there.

The raw oysters are a must when you go to any Diana's. We love getting a platter with a mix of oysters and I love that they serve the oysters with a little array of sauces to try. I usually like the horseradish with seafood sauce or the red wine vinegar with onions. The oysters are meaty and flavourful, and I have yet to get any sand or shells mixed in there. Still, eat cautiously. 

The mains are pretty good here as well. We usually got the seafood platter that had a little bit of everything like scallops, fish, crabs, lobster, calamari. I had the seafood pasta before which was pretty good as well though the pasta was a bit overdone. Over all, not too salty, good balance of food, and an enjoyable meal. 

I just don't think it's quite worth the price they're setting themselves up at because it's nothing truly unique that they're doing here. It's nice to get some fresher seafood up in the city though and it's a nice place to go on a special occasion."}
{"text":"Oysters are really good!! Service is excellent and the atmosphere is great! But it's noisy with the families and kids. And since it's a small space, you can really hear your neighbor's conversations very clearly.  

Food is good too, but I've had better at this price. I did very much enjoy the appetizer platter for two with the grilled octopus and grilled calamari. :) 

Again, the service is great! I love the staff here and they are very knowledgeable about their oysters!"}
{"text":"I'm giving Diana's a higher rating based on service rather than food. Don't get me wrong. The quality of the fish was very good but the preparation and seasoning of the entree didn't wow me. Nevertheless I enjoyed our evening there and that was due mostly to our delightful server, Karen. She was attentive, knowledgeable about the menu, cheerful and had a great sense of humour. She gave us a couple of excellent recommendations on oyster selection ( French Kiss) and dessert coffee (Spanish Coffee). Overall, we were happy with choosing Diana's for our night out and I would probably go back for oysters and a glass of white or maybe even dessert. 
I had the smoked salmon linguine. The best thing our party ordered was probably the Chilean sea bass which also was one of the higher priced selections at 49 bucks. 
Give Diana's a try if you're in the Markham area."}
{"text":"Horrible. This location was so bad. Came here for Mother's Day. The wait to get get served was really ridiculous. You'd think they would be on the ball considering it was an expected busy day. 

Once we finally got served we put in our drink orders and apps just in case he took long to come back. He brought our drinks and took our orders for dinner and then we waited. An hour goes by no food. When the food comes, it's our entrÃ©es....no apps. There was a mess up with our order so the apps came after, which was frustrating especially with how long we had to wait! The waiter turned it around for a split second when he offered us dessert on the house as we asked for the bill. That was quickly taken away when we had to wait AGAIN for so long just to get dessert! And still no bill until we put in the request again. This may sound mild if it wasn't so difficult to get the waiter's attention. 

Overall a bad experience. Now the food was just as bad. For the price you pay, the quality of the food is just not worth it. Probably not gonna go back."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good here. Good quality, huge portions and quite filling. Decor of the place was amazing and we did not have to wait too long. 

I ordered the seafood paella and it was delicious. There was too much of it for me. I know other reviews complained the rice was mushy but it was fine for me. I thought the rice had to be softer since its a paella. 

Having the clam chowder and tuna tar tar alone can be filling even though they are both appetizers. 

The waiter can recommend oysters for you if you are indecisive and I don't think they'll go overboard and choose the most expensive one. It is on the pricy side so I would not mind going for a special occasion."}
{"text":"I went to Diana's Oyster Bar and Grill with my expectations high. If you are eating Oysters, as long as they are fresh they should be great. As predicted they Oysters were pretty fresh and delicious. We also had soup, mussels, clams, crab cakes, and calamari (grilled and battered fried). I was in Seafood Heaven. Only thing was that the service wasn't that great, our server paid little to no attention which is disappointing as the food was great.

Another time a friend brought oysters from Diana's and it was $100 for 150 Oysters. Pretty much a steal of a deal if you ask me. They were just as fresh just because they were unshucked. Not a big issue for us because we had at least 3 of us including myself that knew of to shuck the oysters. It was just the labour that had to be put in that was time consuming. I don't mind working for my food and I would do it again for sure cuz it was worth it to me. They were so delicious and you know what they say about oysters, they are an aphrodisiac. I recommend Diana's Oysters because they have some great things on the menu and I guess you can say they were some Shuckin Good Oysters. JimStar Out!!"}
{"text":"Excellent foods and freshness! Loved oysters and service. The reason why they lost one star is the service. There was a big crowd of family and my server took lots of time with them. it was a long waiting to call our waitress. But overall it was a great experience."}
{"text":"This was my second time visiting Diana's and I must say that I was very pleased with the food and service. I ordered the paella, which was a repeat order from last time and it was spectacular. Filled with seafood: mussels, clams, fish, lobster and crab in a very delicious rice mixture. The seafood was fresh and tasty.
Our server was very kind and courteous with proper attention to the table. The venue was also very clean and nice and makes for a great date place.
Will definitely return for one of the better seafood options in Scarborough."}
{"text":"3.5 - Had dinner here tonight and really enjoyed the freshness of the seafood, the great atmosphere and the lovely service we received. We started with 20 oysters, large prawns and calamari. The oysters had fresh horseradish and sauces to go with them. They were incredibly fresh and delicious. The large prawns were sweet and the calamari was made from fresh squid. It was fried a bit too much for my liking but my family enjoyed it. I had the bouillabaisse for my entree and my family also ordered the grill platter and paella. They were generous with the seafood in all the dishes. The variety was great! My crab legs and shrimp were a bit overcooked but the mussels, claims and fish were perfect. The broth was also delicious! Definitely, a great seafood joint with very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"A dozen mixed oysters, clam chowder, branzino and lobster fettuccine. All fresh, well prepared and flavorful. The lobster fettuccine could've used a little more lobster meat, but that's a minor quibble. And the creme caramel was pretty excellent."}
{"text":"The building doesn't look very nice on the outside but inside, it's decent. The service was average, if not a bit on the slow side. The cooked food we ordered were a bit too salty and the raw oysters tasted ok at the time... until a few days later when I find myself in the washroom all day and night. I got food poisoning and it took me 3 weeks to flush whatever crap I had out. This was the only restaurant I ate at for the week so it was most likely from here. The Toronto Health Unit checked their restaurant and found nothing though. But keep in mind these people actually warn the restaurants ahead of time that they are going to do a food safety check before they actually come so obviously there's enough time for the restaurant to do a major scrub down. This place has made me scared of eating raw oysters forever. I won't be coming back!"}
{"text":"I missed the Fish House. It used to be at DVP and Sheppard. It then moved to 7503 Woodbine Ave. then it disappeared. Now, there's Diana's. Very cool place. Oysters galore! Great wait staff. Very knowledgeable. You can make a meal just out of the appetizers. 
Come during the week! Ask for Steven!
After my third visit, I can recommend the weekly oyster special and any appetizer listed."}
{"text":"I stopped in at Diana's Oyster Bar and Grill because I recognized the name from their retail store in Toronto. I was very surprised to find a nice interior and some excellent food. That surprise may have been because of the location. It's in the same industrial strip at Carmellina's and it doesn't have great 'curb appeal'. However overall it is excellent.

The interior is large with room for over 100 guests and an oyster bar that seats about 25-30 people. There are several areas and the space is great for large groups. It has a modern feel but not too \"cold\". The service is good, however it wasn't that busy. The waitress told me they have been open only since December 2015.

The food was excellent. We had the lunch sandwich special lobster and crab on a grilled thick bread which tasted excellent and was nicely presented with your choice of regular or Manhatten clam chowder.

They have a full seafood menu and lots of varieties of oysters, Overall I though it was a great lunch and I'm sure I'll b back in the future for dinner."}
{"text":"Came here for a mid day lunch on a weekday to try out their oysters. Based on all the good reviews I had to try this place out. The restaurant is fairly small and when we got here it seemed like it was filled with a bunch old retired people. I had to double check to make sure I didn't walk into a seniors home. Anyway, I ended up trying the lobster sandwich, crab sandwich and a dozen fresh oysters. There lobster sandwich was a-okay (3 stars) and the crab sandwich was double a-okay (4 stars) and the fresh oysters were a triple a-okay (5 stars). I think the sandwiches themselves were fresh and had a decent amount of lobster and crab meat. I liked the crab sandwich a lot more for some reason. Probably because of the deep fried squid tentacles. The main event of course were the fresh oysters and damn were they good. The waitress recommended us trying a mixture of different oysters as they all taste a little different. It came in a large plate of ice and they were all shucked  for us already. Super fresh and tasted even more awesome with some lemon and hot sauce. I liked the big oysters the best. The sandwiches were over $15 each and the dozen oysters were over $30 (each type of oyster having a different price point), so remember to come with pockets filled. A must try if in the mood for fresh oysters."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in Toronto, I have to stop by for the best oysters in the city. The service is phenomenal and the vibe is casual."}
{"text":"I don't usually leave review but I must this time. Came here the first time after reading positive reviews. All I can say is I had an upset stomach after eating here. The amount I paid for the food I can probably get a nice quality dinner at North 44 or other \"real\" high end restaurants. Definitely Won't come back again! That being said I think the market in scarbourgh is still great, just not this new restaurant at Markham."}
{"text":"Horrible decor. Service was ok. Food is overpriced for what you get. Not worth the time and money."}
{"text":"Live scallop was incredibly sweet. Only available around August i believe. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We were pretty excited Diana's seafood was opening up shop in Markham so we don't have to go out of our way to have some good seafood. However, our overall experience with this new location is okay at best. 

The good things first. This place is big. Lots of seating, about double the Scarborough location. Menu items were the same, no liquor license just yet though but will have soon. Service was decent though our food did take quite awhile to arrive. 

The bad: oysters. The main reason we come here is the raw oysters because thats what they are known for. However when our platter of various oysters came out, lots of them were gritty with pieces of the shell on the oyster. The fanny bay were on special, dozen for $20 and I usually like specials but it was like they were trying to get rid of the fanny bays. These were the worst of the selection we ordered. One oyster had a weird filmy white cottage cheese like residue on it. Gross. Table beside us also complained about the oysters and weird smell. So you've been warned.

Hot foods, chowders and appetizers that came were good. I love their complimentary bread with balsamic and olive oil. So tasty! 

Maybe they need a few weeks to warm up but I expected more."}
{"text":"I had a really pleasant experience. Came here on a date and thought the atmosphere was nice and not pretentious. The service was a tad bit slow but everything tasted really fresh so I don't mind. The food is delicious. We had lots of oysters with all the condiments, and an order of steamed mussels which I loved. It\s definitely one of the best oyster houses in Toronto with lots of other fresh and tasty seafood options. Fresh seafood and oysters does come at a price but it's worth the value. Two person dinner about $100"}
{"text":"I'm surprised with some of the negative reviews at this place.  Being a super picky seafood eater, I was quite satisfied.  Everything I ordered has been good to delicious thus far.  

1) Caesar salad: It's like any other Caesar salad but you can taste a hint of anchovies in this one.  The romaine they used was fresh & crisp and the sauce wasn't overwhelming.  There was also a good amount of \"tartness\" to the sauce. 

2) Oyster Rockefeller: I've eaten this dish twice.  You get 3 in one order and it is delicious!  Bacon makes everything great and their oyster is a fair size as well.  Their sauce is also just right - not too salty, not too bland. 

3) Crab cakes: I probably am just not a fan of horseradish but I found the taste of the horseradish way too overpowering in this crab cake.  I wasn't a fan of those but from other Yelpers here, it seems like it's a pretty popular dish so it may just be me. 

4) Tuna tartare: The tuna is fresh but the tartare was just okay.  It wasn't horrible but I wouldn't say it's the best tartare I've had.  The sauce was a bit too bland for my liking. 

5) Lobster bisque: I've gone to their store before and tried their canned version they have in store and it was horrible so I was a little scared to try this one.  However, I am glad I did!  The lobster bisque here is not too salty and not too bland.  There is a very strong lobster taste and there are even chunks of lobster in there.  I was one happy gal drinking that soup!

6) Seafood mixed grill: This plate really isn't that small.  It has one whole piece of salmon filet, 3 scallops, and 3 tiger shrimps.  I am not a scallop eater but the other two fish were very fresh and delicious.  I wish the tiger shrimp was a little more buttery.  Apparently the scallops are made to perfection - not overdone but not chewy and raw.  It comes with a quinoa & mixed grilled vegetable side but if you want mashed potatoes, they can do that instead. 

7) Grilled butterfield seabream: This is DELICIOUS.  For those of you who are not afraid of bones in fish, you MUST try this one.  I can go on and on and on about this dish but I definitely will be getting this again.  The sea bream is extremely fresh and you can taste the fish but it's no an overpowering type of taste.  It is indeed buttery and sprinkled with some lemon juice, it was one of the best seafood dishes I've ever had. 

Overall, my experience at Diana's thus far has been great.  I've only gone to the restaurant twice but both times, the service has been good and the food has been good as well.  I'd definitely be going back."}
{"text":"We were there for 2.5 hours. There were small children in our party.

Painfully slow. Expensive for what you get. Some items were delicious but still grossly overpriced.

Usually I would write more, but the above really says it all.

Not a repeat for me."}
{"text":"Solid work lunch here today with company being the best part.

We had fried calamari to start which was good.

I had the special shrimp po boy with side salad. Salad ended up being a really good Caesar with not too much, but delicious dressing. The roll for the sandwich was enormous and a bit mealy - so I ate half and then just the filling from the other half. 

Service was attentive and prompt."}
{"text":"3.5/5

I've heard about Diana's a lot, but never bothered to make a trip to their Scarborough location due to the distance factor. However, after I heard Diana's was opening a second branch in Markham, I knew I had to pay a visit eventually.

I reserved for this restaurant on a Sunday at 7:30pm, but to be honest I didn't need to have made one as the place wasn't too full. Either way, I did what I did and my family was seated by the booth.

The menu is, not surprisingly, seafood focused as that's what Diana's is famous for. At the end, we ordered Manhattan clam chowder, lobster bisque, grilled octopus, kusshi and fat bastard oysters, oyster rockafeller, bouilabaisse, and clam linguine.

I really liked both the raw oysters and the clam linguine. Both the oysters were huge and extremely juicy, and I highly suggest trying these two kinds if you're not familiar with oysters but want something not too much on the high end. The clam linguine was plentiful with clams, but not just any clams...large clams inside shells. There's not a lot of restaurants that offer generous portions of clams.

Everything else, however, was average to substandard considering the hype behind Diana's. The Manhattan clam chowder was quite watery, and there was a disproportionate amount of clam chowder compared to the tomato soup broth. The lobster bisque was better IMO, and I'll probably order that next time. The grilled octopus is good for someone who might have trouble chewing, but I personally found the octopus to be too mushy when I'm normally accustomed to octopus being more chewy. The oyster rockafeller wasn't anything special, as I found the raw oysters to be better. Finally, the bouilabaisse had a decent tomato broth (better than the clam chowder funny enough...) and the ingredients were good.

Service wasn't the best when it came to trying to track down the server. The food comes out slow if you order appetizers and oysters, as they expect you to finish them before the main dishes come out. However when we realized the main dishes were taking a while to come, it took a while for me to track down the server. The restaurant was quite long with several blind spots, so it was easy to lose track of your server.

Overall I probably would return for special occasions, but this place is quite pricey so I definitely won't commit for this place to be in my pool of regular restaurant visits."}
{"text":"I have only been to this restaurant once and have never been to the fish market (which I have heard great things about); however, the restaurant experience was excellent! I went with a a group of 5 adults plus one infant.  They have high chairs for kids there so that was nice for my friend.

I ordered the fish and chips and so did my friend, and the rest of our party ordered the grilled octopus, steamed clams, raw oysters, lobster club sandwich, and seafood chowder.  Everyone truly enjoyed their meals.  The oysters were fresh and delicious. The fish and chips were crispy and not too greasy.

The service was also great. They were very knowledgeable about the food and very friendly.  The space is a bit small, so I wouldn't be surprised if it gets busy during lunch and dinner hours.  We went around 1:30pm on a Tuesday, and it was almost empty.

I'm very much looking forward to returning to this place!"}
{"text":"Fantastic seafood! Despite it being INSANELY busy, we got sat in timely fashion, although I do recommend booking a reservation in advance.

Our server, Katrina, was delightful. 

Great place!"}
{"text":"Yummy yummy yummy!  Must go here!  Not cheap but worth the drive to Scarborough. ..unless you live in Scarborough then you should already know about this place."}
{"text":"I had the mixed seafood plate when I went this time previously I had the seafood platter. I've been hear multiple times this place never ceases to amaze me the food is outstanding. Phenomenal is an understatement. The seafood practically melts in my mouth. I don't think it's possible to get tired of the freshest seafood in Toronto."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday dinner with my family; the food was a bit of a hit and miss. Ones that stood out as excellent were the pan seared scallops, grilled whole branzino, and shrimp & lobster tagliatelle. Very delicious but light on garnish and small portions. The deboned fish was a pleasure to eat.

The manhattan clam chowder was terrible with next to no clam bits or even a hint of clam juice; essentially marinara sauce that was sprinkled with undercooked potato cubes. I quite like manhattan clam chowder so this was disappointing. The clam linguine was swimming in oil, not linguine pasta, and didn't hold together well. 

We had a half dozen oysters for kicks but selection was small. We also had to ask for bread before they gave us any (they were great though--soft, hot, and fresh!) There were some miscommunications with the staff such as order of service (entrees came before apps even though he said the opposite), stroller placement, and our table location (manager had to say something).

Overall not the smoothest ride with a couple of bumps. At this price point it's not the best experience, but the scallops and fish still anchor a solid three stars."}
{"text":"I haven't wrote reviews in so long, but I had to get this one off my chest since its been on my mind for a long while. To be honest, I was very excited to try this place on my birthday despite all the mix reviews I saw on Yelp, but hey I wanted to try something new so we did. As soon as we got in, it was a terrible experience. We waited to be seated for at least 20 minutes around 12 PM, and trust me it was not even packed. Second when we sat down, it another 30 minutes to get us some water. Third when we started ordering and getting our entrees, that's when it went really down hill. All our food was cold and tasted frozen. All of the portions were small and were pretty disappointed. What was more disappointing was the wait staff especially our waiter. He bluntly asks after we leave a tip, how come this tip isn't bigger? Was there a problem today? (In a confronting manner) How much more unprofessional can you get?? If I really wanted to be truthful and upfront, the service here is terrible and no one should go here to pay ridiculous prices for crappy food and  horrible service. End of story."}
{"text":"Took my mom here for mother's day. Ordered the lobster bisque, paella and a seafood platter. The bisque was really weak and lacking any flavour. It gets a Zero, and it cost $10 per bowl. The shrimp gets 5 stars. Best shrimp I've had in a couple years. Everything else was good too, but those are the 2 items that stood out. Not happy with the bisque at all."}
{"text":"Note that the 2 stars were for the oysters only. I've eaten here about a half dozen times with the 2nd last time being about the best. The chowder had been perfect, flavourful and velvety rich and the 2 seafood mains my friend and I ordered were good however the most recent visit and it should also be noted that there was less than a week between the last two visits, was pretty much a dreadful experience. Our waitress was pleasant but inept and unattentive.  Five or more requests for water yielded tiny juice sized glasses with no ice and we had to ask for refills each time. The main dishes included the lobster and shrimp pasta, spinach gnocchi with crab and a few other seafood mains I can't recall or rather don't want to recall except that it was a unanimous thumbs down from all 6 at the table. My dinner companion beside me invited me to sample her lobster and shrimp pasta which tasted like it had been made with aquarium water and my own spinach gnocchi (gnocchi the size of jumbo marshmallows), was totally devoid of flavour. Key elements as simple as garlic, shallots and  white wine were definitely missing. The waitress explained that it was the first night of the new menu - yikes! Bring back the old one for heavens sake. When asked about our meals we didn't hold anything back (we are all foodies), albeit in a civil tone and even had a visit from the manager. I wondered aloud how the same chef who was cooking 5 days earlier could have been responsible for the wholly underwhelming fare served up this night. No reasonable explanation was offered nor were there any complimentary deserts or drinks offered up in apology. The bill came and instead of joyfully ante-ing up the 30.+ for the mains and the reasonable 8. for the chowder which this night tasted like the Heinz or Campbell's version, we were stunned to find that nothing, absolutely nada, not even the measly 30. drinks total compared to the over 300. food bill had been the slightest bit comped. If they had at least done that we would have left our undeserving waitress the proceeds. I felt badly for my friends because it was my recommendations from the earlier visit which had brought them out this night. Sorry mis amigos. Smarten up Diana's."}
{"text":"Came here on NYE for dinner because Gyubee had a 3 hour wait. Surprisingly, there weren't many people in there so we got seated right away for a party of 6. The dishes are really a hit or miss. Giving this place 3 stars because it's pricey for nothing special, and the only dish I loved (steamed mussels) could be made at home. 

Lobster & Shrimp Tagliatelle ($29) - This was delicious! It comes with a full lobster tail, and a few big and juicy shrimps. Tagliatelle isn't my favourite pasta but this was amazing. The sauce was on point. I would definitely order this again.

Diana's Seafood Paella ($32) - I didn't really like this dish, it just tasted like a plain stew with soggy rice. The prawns were big and juicy, which was the best part of the dish. The clams were not bad either, decent in size. The mussels were absolutely undercooked, the shells were barely opened and the inside was completely cold and mushy. There were small chunks of fish which were pretty broken up, and the rice was very soggy. The broth was bland. 

Steamed Salt Spring Mussels ($36 for 2 orders) - We ordered the white wine garlic and the tomato basil. The white wine garlic was amazing, the tomato basil wasn't bad either!!! They're both so yummy it's addicting.

6 dozens of Malpeque Oysters ($141) - They were really fresh! Looks and tastes much cleaner than those buck-a-shuck places like Nome Izakaya, not a problem but you do notice the difference in quality. 

Tuna Tartare ($18) - I always love a good tuna tartare, but this was just average. Didn't really understand why they served it with rice, and the avocado was kind of raw. I've had better ones. 

Grilled Octopus ($18) - Way too much salad, and had like 5 slices of octopus.

Grilled Calamari ($15) - This was pretty good! You can really taste the olive oil in this dish.

Crab Cakes ($30 for 4 pieces) - I was never a fan of crab cakes but you can actually taste the crab in this dish. It came with a side of .. spinach? I have no idea. 

Diana's Signature Clam Chowder ($10) - Thick and hearty!

Grilled Organic Salmon ($28) - Just like any other salmon dish, nothing special."}
{"text":"A very solid 3 star. 

5 Star dishes - octopus and branzino. Amazing. The taste of the grill is aparent and so flavourful. The salad with the octopus is delish! They say deboned on the menu but they didnt take out smaller bones (only the spine it seems) so watch out for those. 

Everything else not worth it. Paella was not bad, with large just-cooked shrimp and creamy rice, but clams were sandy. Muscles were fresh but small, marinara sauce bland. Lobster bisque was too 'shelly' in the taste. There was also no lobster pieces. It also came out with a film of hardened soup on top.. it had been sitting obviously. Oyster rockafella nothing special.

Service was subpar the whole dinner. We were seated for 10 mins without water. Server got our water order wrong (we asked for a few hot and the rest cold), seemed like he couldnt remember the daily specials, and was just super slow all night and didnt check in on us much. Oyster shucker was super slow - yes there was only 1 guy but oysters should be first to come out.. they came out last. We were told there was a backup on the oysters.. but comeon.. im not dining downtown but im not asking for much here. Place decor is nice and so is seating."}
{"text":"Don't come here for dinner.. Better off to buy the oysters and go home to shuck them.. Knowing they have a special today For oysters.. It took them 45+ minutes for 4 dozen oysters and the entrees another 45+ minutes ... Service was so bad and some what rude .. Didn't even get water until 30 minutes after we sat down.. And also they calculated the tips with the tax and not sub total.. As instructed by their manager.. What a rip off especially with a big group of people.. It makes a big difference ! And I thought it would of been a good experience for my mother's birthday.. I guessed wrong .."}
{"text":"Went there recently for a friends birthday. We had a party of 7, service wasn't great. The waitress was really new and under training, which is find but a lot if her mistakes were corrected in front of us and a lot of directions to her, felt kind of unprofessional. As she is under training I do not mind if you make mistakes but hope the colleagea and correct you and pick out the mistakes later at the side to be more professional. The food was below average for me, wanted the stead medium rare and it was burnt on the edges and unevenly cooked. The oysters were good but there were a few that weren't fresh. On top of it all they charged gratuity on the tax as we were a large party. All the restaurants I have been to if they charge gratuity in the bill its before the tax is applied."}
{"text":"Came in lunch time on a Friday afternoon for a business meeting. 

The interior looks upscale. Didn't expect it from the looks of their exterior.  The place wasn't busy, it was almost empty. 

This restaurant specializes in oysters and seafood. I am not a big fan of oysters, I had the crab cakes as appetizer ($15) served on top of salad and miso-glazed Chilean sea bass ($49) served with asparagus and quinoa. 

The food was delicious, presentation was excellent.  Servers were friendly and attentive.  Very nice, quiet ambience perfect for business lunch. 

I had cappuccino afterwards. Disappointed that it came in a small cup."}
{"text":"It was my first time at the restaurant, but I've been to the market side in the Scarborough location many times over the years. The market is amazing, but this review is about the Markham restaurant. 

The food was pretty mediocre. I had the stuffed sea bream. It was supposed to be stuffed with lobster and rice. I did not see any lobster in the stuffing, it was basically all rice. Not that I was expecting big chunks of lobster, but i expected some lobster... in some kinda format. If they didn't list it on the menu as an ingredient, i would be less annoyed.  

Some of my friends had lobster ravioli but they both noted there were shells in the pasta, which made it very annoying to eat. 

Wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"When we first arrived while having a reservation, we found the hostess not accommodating and irritable when were asking for a table we preferred.

I had the lobster and shrimp pasta which was a very generous portion at $29.00, but not too tasty.

The other guys had the surf and turf which was good.

The fanny bay oysters were a bit off tasting in comparison to the ones i had at bier market.

Our waitress was really nice and accommodating."}
{"text":"I'm an oyster lover and Diana's Seafood hits the spot. Order the Pacific Tiger oysters - fresh, tasty and meaty.  I think they were $2-3 each when I went.  The seafood platter for 2 is alright. Service can be slow."}
{"text":"This place is interesting....in both a good way and a bad way. 

Diana's is Diana's - they have really good seafood. Now what they do with their seafood is sort of a hit or miss.

Overall, it's meant to be a greek restaurant style, but it's more so greek food for the Asian demographic. 

Overall, my general impression is that the chef doesn't quite get the delicacy of the seafood is working with yet cooks it to perfection. The scallops in pesto - over powering and the oil tastes stale. The octopus - grilled perfectly but the tabuleh and humus and pomegranate - too much and not well done. The tuna - served on seaweed salad....doesn't fit on the same plate as pickerel with sweet mash....very confusing and very strong flavours.

But what they do right are the classics. Great deal on Oysters - though i found the shucking to be a little poor - but when you're paying essentially $1.50 a shuck, you accept that.  The lavraki however - now this is the star of their menu. It's exceptional. No confusion - classic greek prepartion - the gril, some salt, some lemon and olive oil. The protein sings and the grill accents. 

My honest recommendation - just go for some oysters and lavraki and you'll have an excellent night. The rest is just confusing fluff."}
{"text":"Diana is the best place to eat fresh, unbaked  oyster in Scarborough
They have oyster special for Monday and Thursday. fanny bay is pretty juicy and fresh;
Grilled calamari is my fav dish here 
Service is friendly, the environment is nice
They also have a fish market beside
Definitely will come back again"}
{"text":"despite the negative reviews for diana's, i didn't experience anything bad at all in my last visit. in fact their cherry stone clams, oysters and scallops were AMAZINGGGGGG. they were so fresh, sweet and meaty! our waitress was very knowledgeable about all the oysters and attended to all  our needs. the only down side is that one of the dead clams in our clam linguine opened revealing the dirty mud inside. of course the manager took that off our bill but also graciously took 4 oysters off as well! nowadays taking the unsatisfactory food item off the bill is an expectation but they went above and beyond by giving us free oysters too!"}
{"text":"I had no idea there was a Diana's in Markham so we decided to try. We've always gotten oysters taken out from the Lawrence location so we hoped this one would be good. We went here for my husband's birthday. Made reservations for a Sunday night but when we got there, there were tons of seats so clearly no need for reservations. 

We got seated right away by the hostess. It took out waiter a while to get to is, probably 20 min after we sat down? It wasn't busy so I don't know what the problem was. I had to ask the girl pouring water what the specials were. Once the waiter came, he was able to recommend us what oysters we wanted. Since we were also dining with our parents, we ordered a variety: Merry Duxberry (Mass), Colville Bay (PEI), Marina's Top Drawer (BC). The oysters were shucked well and fresh and delicious! We all had our individual favourites. Standard presentation. Not too much variety offered though, probably only half of ~20 varieties available this day.

For another appetizer, we ordered grilled octopus ($18) on top of a green salad, pomegranate tabouli and hummus. This was a good portion, octopus was grilled well (not too chewy or dry) and the salad was a good pairing. The hummus was nothing special, was probably store bought. For mains, we ordered Lobster & Shrimp Tagliatelle ($29), Diana's Paella ($32), Seafood Mixed Grill ($39), and Bouillabaisse ($28). The tagliatelle was a little too al dente, very orange (from the saffron), cream sauce was just \"okay\" (a little bland), and the shrimp and lobster were fine. The paella was even more disappointing. Again orange from the saffron but the paella was flavourless! Probably the most bland paella I've tasted ever!  Couldn't taste the seafood flavour! A mix of seafood but forgettable. Keep in mind I love paella so this dish sucked. The seafood grill had salmon, scallops, shrimp, lifeless looking vegetables and a weird baked potato. The salmon was dry, scallops was over, and shrimp was fine. Finally the bouillabaisse was probably the best of the four. The broth was tasty, fishy and seasoned well. The lobster tail was okay, shrimp was fine, mussels and clams were also fine. There was two crouton like grilled bread but the dish was covered with a lid when it came to the table... so obviously the bread was soggy. Doesn't take a genius to figure out--just don't cover the dish! 

They were accommodating for us because we had a baby and he did cry so I felt bad for the other patrons. I walked around the restaurant with my baby so there were a ton of other tables with more privacy so I have no idea why they put us right smack in the middle at a large table. Made \"public\" breastfeeding kind of hard. Sorry but my son needed food! Overall, quite an expensive meal and we didn't even order any alcohol (parents-in-law and husband aren't big drinkers and I'm breastfeeding). Food was meh but the oysters were awesome. Also our late arriving waiter (after whispering to him out of earshot) brought us out a pretty tasty peanut butter cheesecake on the house for my husband's birthday. 

So come here for the oysters. I didn't even see any interesting drink menus. Don't come here for the mains. Maybe get the apps. Expensive and not that well cooked. Nice employees and nice decor."}
{"text":"Pricey but where else would you go for great raw oysters.?

They have a dinner menu too... featuring all sorts of seafood dishes... but I only go for their great selections of oysters from around the world."}
{"text":"I was here for a wedding dress rehearsal dinner and the seafood was awesome. Presentation was gorgeous. Service was great. Can't wait to head back."}
{"text":"The 3 stars is mainly for great service and ambiance. Contrary to many of the reviews here, we found the service to be excellent. We were celebrating joint birthdays between my hubby and another friend. I called ahead of time and inquired about a plating fee for bringing our own cakes. Thankfully, there were none. In fact, we had two dedicated servers for our large party, and they brought two of our cakes out on nice platters and added their own sparklers. They even sang happy birthday lol. The ambiance was also nice as we had a designated area for our group, which included a bunch or babies and toddlers. 

In terms of food, it was decent but not spectacular. The pastas were fine, but my husband thinks I make a better seafood linguine (I do cook often). The only thing that stood out and looked delicious was the sea bream that my friend ordered. It was a whole fish that was moist inside and had a nice char on the outside. There was a bed of grilled veggies under the fish. My friend seemed to really enjoy it. 

Overall, I wouldn't mind coming back, but wouldn't go out of my way to do so. Good space for accommodating large groups, but there are definitely better seafood options out there."}
{"text":"My favorite seafood restaurant by far! The food is absolutely amazing, with a wide variety of flavorful oysters. The interior decor is ravashing, with a very classy yet comfortable environment. The waitors/waitresses/hostesses are all very kind. The hostesses welcomed me with a huge smile! I will definitely be back for more. Loved it!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Made reservations ahead of time for this location considering it's a weekend, waited about 10 mins to get our seat.  The two hostess at the front look like they're in high school and aren't professional at all. (One of them had pretty ripped up tights)

We were prompted by our server fairly quickly after being seated, and the food arrived at a good time one after the other.

The space here is a lot bigger than the Lawrence location that I normally visit, so it's definitely great for larger parties! The oyster bar is huge!

Ordered the oysters, fish cake, lobster/shrimp pasta, and their special of the day (soft shell crab with spinach salad).  Everything tasted just as great as the one on Lawrence, I was impressed.

I would have given this place a 5 star if they had better hostesses at the front and better time management of reservations.  But I will definitely be back, their food always wins my heart.... Until the next time! :)"}
{"text":"Went here today for my birthday lunch with my family and I loved everything we ordered! My dad suggested we go here because he went here a couple months ago and he said that their clam chowder is way better than the one he got in San Francisco, and coming from my dad that means a lot. I couldn't compare it to the clam chowder in SF because sadly I've never been there yet but it's the best clam chowder I ever had! Ever! But then again I'm comparing to those you could get at buffets and at the cafeteria at school.  
We also ordered some fresh oysters.. We didn't know which ones to get because we honestly didn't know there were so many different kinds of oysters but our server was such a great help! She explained to us the difference of east coast and west coast oysters. Since we couldn't make up our mind she gave us a few to try from the east coast and a few to try from the west. I can say that I actually like the west coast oysters better because they're creamier and sweeter unlike the east coast oysters which are salty (but they were still good!) 
We also got baked oysters which were bomb.com! 
And last but not the least we got the seafood platter, it consisted of king crab, lobster, tiger shrimps, squid, scallops, fried rice, roasted vegetables. It was sooo good! It's apparently for 2 people but we shared it among 4. By this time we were stuffed with what we ordered.
The service was awesome! They kept on asking if we were ok and if we needed something. They also made sure our table stayed clean so our clothes won't get dirty. 
Loved everything! Honestly worth every penny! I will be coming back for some clam chowder!!!!"}
{"text":"We went to the Diana's in Toronto exactly one year ago for birthday celebration. It was a great experience and we decided to do it again this year at the Richmond Hill location but it totally disappointed us - the worst dining experience in our lives.

We had a table for 8 adults and 4 kids, each of us politely and clearly ordered our appetizers and entrees. The servers just randomly placed our appetizers everywhere and we had to pass them around ourselves. Also, when the server introduced us the Uni appetizers at the beginning, we all heard her saying 5 pieces (not 4). So my husband asked why there are only 4 pieces on the plate, they just simply said it's always 4 not 5. Not to mentioned they missed one of our appetizer order. 

One of us ordered the Sea Bass for entree and they missed it. When we told the server there is one entree missing, she said she didn't catch it, and Sea Bass was off the menu since two months ago and replaced by Black Cod. We told her that then you shouldn't say it on the menu, and missing our orders is simply your problem. She then went away without an apology. She didn't even care one of us has no entree for the dinner. 

15 minutes later she came back with a plate of Black Cod without even asking if we want it. We aren't beggars over here. 

The worst is yet to come. It was supposed to be a birthday celebration and we brought an ice-cream cake there for the night. We told the receptionist it is an ice-cream cake and it needs to be stored in the freezer, FREEZER, not fridge so that it won't melt. We reminded her twice not to put it in the fridge but when we were about to leave (we didn't even bother eating the cake there, we just wanted to leave and take the cake back home). They gave us a cake that's half the original size - it's all melted. 

I have to say, the food there is not even comparable to what we used to have from Diana's in Toronto. The service is crap. If you want good seafood and reasonable service, just simply don't go there."}
{"text":"As far as food and service are concerned, this is definitely a must-try in Toronto. I have only good things to say about Diana's. 

The gentleman working the oyster bar was knowledgeable and gave excellent recommendations. He suggested 3-4 oysters and was spot on with what we were looking for. He shucked an oyster for me to try before we ordered. We had seconds, of course!

Our waiter suggested a great wine, and checked on us just the right amount to be thorough, but not pushy or hovering. In fact, some of the best service I have had I years! I didn't eat my dessert, and he removed it from the bill even though I said I was full, and not because I didn't like it. 

Our entrees were also great. I had salmon and my husband had the NY Strip. 

The atmosphere was a bit noisy--not relaxing or romantic, but as it was a Saturday night, it was hopping! Lots of large groups. 

Will definitely be back. Wish I remembered the server's name, because I would like to commend him too."}
{"text":"We really liked the knowledgeable waiter telling us of all the varieties of oysters. Great service. The room is really tiny right now . Get in early (7pm) on weekends as they don't take reservations as yet. The main pasta and risotto are a little salty and bland of flavor. The steak is surprisingly good for a seafood place. My son had that and he enjoyed it. We will go back for oyster satisfaction"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my coworker and we decided to order a bunch of appetizers to share.

Appetizer Platter for 2 ($28)
This dish came with 4 items: Smoked salmon, grilled octopus, caprese salad and grilled calamari. The presentation was definitely a disappointment as it didn't look that appealing. Essentially it was just grilled calamari and octopus served with 2 different salads. The Grilled Calamari portion is comparable to the calamari/octopus in this platter, if not less, so essentially you are paying an extra $13 for the 2 salads? I would not be able to justify the portion of the 2 salads worth the $13. Ingredients were fresh but this platter was nothing special and over priced in my opinion. 

Grilled Calamari ($15)
This was nothing special - the calamari was grilled nicely, not too chewy. It was served in an orange brandy sauce which wasn't much of my liking.

Oyster Rockafeller ($13) 
The baked oysters was probably the best dish of all that we tried. It was baked with bacon, spinach, cheese and panko crumbs. Comes with 3 but we ordered an additional one ($3.25) since we had 4 people.

Crab Cakes ($12)
Comes with only 2 crab cakes and arugula salad. It was tastey, but could definitely use more crab meat. I really liked the spicy mayo drizzled along the sides of the plate

Steamed Mussels ($17)
The mussels was served in a creamy sauce wih crispy fennel, green onion and pancetta. I really enjoyed the mussels - ingredients were fresh and the sauce was very flavorful. Portion was big as well, good for sharing. Definitely a better appetizer to order in terms of value compared to the other options.

Ahi tuna tartare ($18)
This was one of their specials for the day. I found the price was very steep, as the portion was fairly small. I did enjoy this dish though, tasted very refreshing with the the mangoes adding a nice tangy taste. They should have included more pieces of chips though as 4 definitely was not enough to go with the tartare. 

Overall the good was good, very enjoyable meal. 
I heard that their new markham location has horrible service. I would definitely recommend people to stick with this location as opposed to visiting the markham location."}
{"text":"Their oysters and clams are fresh, but their hot dishes are soso. I would go back for more fresh raw seafood. Better choice is to buy a box from the other location and shuck them yourself ;)"}
{"text":"Had dinner there to celebrate my husband's birthday on August 27, we had oysters, some seafood rice and pasta. Food wasn't that great for the price, but the worse thing was I had diarrhea and vomited 3 times that night!"}
{"text":"Came here on the suggestion of a friend, and after hearing good things for quite a while. Perhaps my expectations were too high due to the hype, but I wasn't particularly impressed.

Maybe it was my disappointment with the lobster roll only being available on the lunch menu? The Lobster Shrimp pasta I had instead was fine, but didn't blow me away - the lobster was a bit on the dry side and the pasta sauce could have used a bit more flavor. Ditto for the Crab Cakes.

I will say that I liked the chic atmosphere of this place, especially bar-side area. Service was adequate as well. Keep in mind that many that come here do so probably for the oysters, so your experience will probably be different.

I may come back for the lunch menu, but will not be in a hurry."}
{"text":"Went to Dianna's for mother's day and was not impressed. 
For the price I'd expected better. I had the Creole lobster/shrimp special but felt the Creole sauce/seasoning completely overpowered the seafood. 
And the choice to serve it on a bed of risotto (normally a subtle flavoring) was a miss match. The broccolini was bland so overall a disappointment. 
My mother had a similar experience with a mismatched side dish where they served steamed salmon with a strong flavored Ratatouille side.
On the bright side, the deserts were great! the lemon walnut cheese cake was very good, and my mother enjoyed her apple strudel."}
{"text":"Came on a Monday for the Malpeque Mondays - $12 for 12. Not bad, definitely not the creamy taste. Actually...briny to the point where I could practically feel the salt in my eyes.

Ordered Kumamoto oysters to satisfy the creamy taste craving. Half of them were beautifully delish! Other half were meh! I liked the service too. Sat at the bar and the staff at the bar joked that we weren't allowed to sit there and drink water. Food always tastes better with a side of humor!"}
{"text":"One hour wait for $8.00 clam chowder. Thank you for personally digging for the clams ...?
Oysters came very quickly because we wanted them first and ordered before the 7pm crowd. The oysters were great.  Waiter(s) has no service training: when he asked us for drinks, and some said \"just water\", he didn't suggest serving \"water for all\".  Instead, some of us had no beverages because we said no to drinks since we also understand that implies an alcoholic beverage order.  And when we asked for extra utensils, they told us \"you should have a set already\" (definitely not cool to challenge the people tipping you), but due to lack of training on their part, another server cleared away our forks and knives along with the dish! And they serve dinner rolls without providing a dinner roll plate or butter knife. If there was a side plate, maybe they'd remember not to take away our utensils in-use.

Due to slow service, no way is the turnaround fast enough to make any profit on the weekend regardless of sky high menu prices since they've overhired too many untrained employees. Like all restaurants that have opened in that location but have closed since, let's hope they get their act together before it's too late."}
{"text":"Saturday 12:15pm lunch time we dined as a group of 4 adults, 1 toddler, and 1 child. No longer a Scarborough native, I had only ever shopped at the seafood market years ago and didn't realize Diana's had opened a restaurant next door. (Everybody in my lunch party had been to the restaurant except me). The restaurant was not understaffed which is a plus because that means you don't have trouble getting service attention, and they were incredibly patient with the fact that we had a toddler with us, and one who was nearing his terrible 2s. I don't recommend this seafood restaurant as being child-friendly becuase 1)acoustics are loud if a child screams [we tested this] 2)no kids menu, and 3)most children don't like seafood until they are a little older.

The waitress was familiar with our party so the service and conversation were very natural and sincere. I was delighted to read that the menu wasn't overly ambitious, ensuring I wasn't about to experience a Franken-seafood restaurant: There were calamari, octopus, oysters in appetizers, bouillabaise, lobster, and fish in mains, pastas had 1 chicken option for the non-seafood customer, and desserts had an interesting \"cardomom creme caramel\" which I did not take the opportunity to try this visit. Just reading the combinations of food gave me the impression the chef here is very lucky to be entrusted with more creative liberty than other restaurants given the mediocre menus I've seen across town this past winter and spring (if I see another \"pickled beet salad\"...I think I will have a meltdown).  

We asked for our starters and mains to come out simultaneously to skip on formalities so we can immediately tuck in. There is a long wine and beer list for pairing with your food. We ordered a variety of oysters on ice, 1/2 dozen each. Oyster tastes are a personal preference, but they were freshly shucked and came with generous wedges of fresh lemon slices and freshly grated horseradish. I enjoyed their Kumamoto, French Kiss, and LARGE cherrystone clams. These were also served with baskets of ovenfresh hot bread, butter, oil&vinegar. 
  
The grilled octopus was served on a bed of warm arugula salad with couscous and hummus. The hummus was more like a sauce for plating and that was very novel in comparison to ho-hum hummus. The fact that I found pomegranate seeds in the arugula continued to verify my guess that their kitchen is allowed to be creative, or at least, to invest in a spectrum of produce.

The bouillabaise was a generous seafood stew. It contained clams, mussels, fish, scallop, shrimp (I think?) and a lobster tail. The star of the dish was definitely the soup because it was a thick and flavourful fennel and tomato base.  I am not even a tomato soup lover, but I like this one! I personally like the slight licorice taste of fennel, but I didn't notice it in this stew. The lobster tail wasn't particularly special--just frozen lobster. The mussels tasted off, and it was consistently ALL the mussels, so I was surprised and disappointed. The clams were incredibly large, and the fish was meaty and not flaky, something I really enjoy.  I think the menu said the bouillabaisse came with rouille, but I don't recall if I had it or noticed it in the bouillabaisse. (Perhaps it's that mayo-Thousand-Island-looking spread on the garlic bread in the photo I attached). I didn't seek out the rouille, so I guess I can't recollect it!

Overall, I enjoyed the bold creativity of their dishes, the waitstaff service, the freshness and variety of available raw shellfish, and the plating and presentation of everything we ordered."}
{"text":"Great place to catch up and have seafood! Oysters and mussels was a good start and lobster ravioli. Service was slow but good when I had to return a dish!"}
{"text":"Not the waitress's fault however after 45 minutes and after the rest of my table finished their meals I still had not gotten my order of 2 dozen oysters... Having finished my beer that I had been nursing and not wanting to hold up the table I decided to cancel my order and try my luck elsewhere... I know the food here is great but going hypoglycemic waiting isn't ideal!"}
{"text":"Nice place to dine and chat accompanied by some fresh oysters! They have a special for oysters on Mondays; $15 dollars for a dozen of Malpeque! You should expect the service to be kind of slow if you're ordering oysters on Monday. 

I went last Monday and we weren't served until 40mins later. We kept telling our waitress that we've been waiting for a while; she apologized and told us it's a Monday and that it'll take some time. When our first round of oysters came, we placed another order for oysters and that came a lot quicker because the waitress made a note to speed things up. Our third round came pretty quick as well, so we were pretty happy in the end. 

Definitely go to Diana's if you're a seafood lover!"}
{"text":"I love Seafood and I am so glad that Diana's now opens in Markham!

Love the interior decor and it is more plushy than other restaurants in the area. I highly recommend coming here with your date if she/he is a seafood lover and you ready to impress with your wallet.

I really enjoy the Seafood Paella ($30) and the Fish of the Day ($27): lightly breaded pan fried. For Appetizer: I opt for the fresh uni ($15). The lobster bisque ($8) though really disappointing. I was back to the Clam Chowder and I did not like it either.

I like the varieties of oysters that are available. But seriously, Kumamoto for $5 each? I think this is way over priced especially Diana's is a wholesaler of Oysters! 

Diana's does offers oyster special on Tuesdays but only on Malpeques and Fanny Bays. And for other type, good luck!"}
{"text":"Oysters!! Oysters!! Oysters!!

Diana's Seafood now has its own restaurant serving their customers what they have been famous for all these year.... Awesome oysters and fresh seafood.

Diana's Oyster Bar and Grill is located in the same plaza right in front of their retail complex... Nice patio overlooking Lawrence...The decoration is surprisingly plush and chic with a lot of brushed silver... compare to the simple box like exterior!

Friendly waiter recommended Cotuit ($3.25), Kusshi ($2.50) and Lucky Lime ($2.90) to warm us up for lunch... Fresh oysters.. so tasty... too bad is not $1 each I can eat 2 dozen no problem..

For Main I decided to make my lunch date to share his Lobster Club ($14), while I make him eat my Halibut Sandwich ($15). I love my Halibut Sandwich while I think his Lobster Club is so so....Halibut is nicely done with Fresh basil pesto and panko crust...VS the mayonnaise based for the Lobster Club.

Services is excellent... the waiter checked on us numerous of time and making sure that everything is OK.

I wish they have Happy Hour? Maybe they will one day.... Oyster Happy Hour!

PS don't ever order any NON seafood items in a Seafood Restaurants... My side salad that replacing the fries was one of the worst salad I have... it was like one of those leftover package salad that marked down in the supermarket....."}
{"text":"Food's amazing (those appys!) 
Place looks amazing.
Service was reallly amazing. 

All of the appys we had were really well cooked, so they really started our night off well. I had the branzino, and they really knocked it out of the park, althought i didnt really care for the side of root vegetables. My boyfriend got the seafood paella, but they served those mini crayfish things that didn't contain much meat...but the mussels made up for it i think. All in all it was decent! 
You're probably wondering where the oysters went - but i learned that it's much cheaper to buy them at the Fishery down at Lawrence and shuck them yourself for a quarter of the price (assuming you know a good oyster shucker of course!)
I would definitely come here again for a special occasion. :)"}
{"text":"This was a very mixed review for me. We went to this location for one of my friends birthdays and we had a party of 10. We had reservations at 7pm. It was a weekday (Thursday) and it was moderately busy. Many of us arrived after work and were very hungry so we ordered rather quickly.

Our food did not arrive for 2 hours around 9pm!! One of my friends ordered a salad.... which should not take 2 hours to prepare.

I got the stuffed sea bream which was a oven baked fish stuffed with rice, lobster meat, and served with lemon dressing. The fish was cooked nicely but it was a bit overpriced at $30... The oysters we ordered as appetizers were delicious. They had many different varieties and sauces. One of us got the tuna tartare which looked really good. The pasta entrees were rather small for $25 pricing.

My overall recommendation would be to come for a light lunch and order more of the fresh seafood. I wish I had spent my money on oysters and appetizers. The entree items were not worth it in my opinion and took WAY too long to prepare."}
{"text":"We will not be returning to the restaurant after our first experience. It is unfortunate because our meal was good. The only reason why this restaurant is receiving 1 star because of the terrible service we received. We were here last night for my boyfriend's mom's birthday and it was busy because of their oyster special. We waited 40 minutes for water around the table and after we asked, our server replied \"no one asked for water\". I was shocked when the server said that because water should automatically be served to your guests when they are dining with you in your restaurant. The thing that bothered us the most was when the bill arrived, the auto-gratuity was hand written on the printed receipt. Normally, when there is an auto-gratuity, the amount is calculated based on the subtotal, not grand total after the HST. We spoke to the server and she said \"this is our manager's rule and we share our tips\". Although it is just a few dollars difference, we found it very unprofessional and by this point, we were frustrated and just paid for the bill and left."}
{"text":"We were assigned the best table next to the entrance where the atmosphere was very good and quiet. Delicious food and warm service."}
{"text":"I went here with some of my old highschool friends on a weeknight and it wasn't packed. The mood was set more for a romantic date as opposed to a get together with friends (FYI... this did not stop us from being medium loud as we caught up with updates).

The food was good but more on the pricey side. My friend had two crab cakes which were $15 for two slider sized cakes. I had the clam linguine which was okay for $24. The clams tasted fresh and the pasta was garlicky and buttery. I also had the Caesar salad which had real bacon and the dressing was creamy. 

For dessert, my friends tried the tiramisu which looked kind of sloppy but was apparently very tasty.     One of my friends had wanted coffee but their machine was broken. The teas they offered were regular fare such as orange pekoe, earl grey, green tea and chamomile (the four o'clock brand).

The servers were friendly and patient with us since some of us took a while decide what to get."}
{"text":"We ordered some raw oysters, a clam chowder and a seafood platter, which contained an assortment of grilled seafood.  The oysters were fresh.  I can't give 5 stars to a food where no cooking skills is called for, so the oysters got 4 stars.  Seafood platter was a matter of salt, garlic and herbs.  Simple. Beautiful.  And I can grill it just about as good.  Clam chowder?  It could be 4 stars in Toronto by comparison.  But considering Diana's has access to the freshest clams at cost, I expect something more in line as Boston or Cape Cod clam chowder.  No such luck on my visit.  My recommendation is to stick to raw oysters if you come here.

In terms of pricing, it is justifiably expensive.  There is a premium on top shelved, fresh seafood in Toronto."}
{"text":"Not bad - I would eat there again but I find it pricey for what you get.  Typically restaurants where you pay about 30$ or more for an entree, there is some bread as you wait for you food.  Grilled calamari was okay - but it was served on a tomato marinara sauce which really overpowered the dish and took away from the typical fresh flavours of grilled calamari.  Not bad, just not worth the prices."}
{"text":"Some of the best seafood that I have been to.  If you want fresh seafood to eat then this is the place especially having the fresh raw oyster.   Soooo good.

They also have a lobster club that's outta this world too.  One of my favorite restaurants in Scarborough"}
{"text":"Excellent everything! Quiet. Great place for a date. Oysters are always fresh and great selection. Interior decor in Markham store is way more classy than the one in Scarborough. Both stores have great cuisines ! Yummy yummy ! 11 thumbs up !"}
{"text":"Such yummy oysters, and great space. Service is also good. Everything else on the menu is overpriced for the portions given."}
{"text":"Came here on a thursday night with my family. Food was delicious - 10/10 would recommend. However, the cute hostess, i believe her name is Betty, wouldnt give me her number so i am going to have to deduct one star.  Otherwise, would definitely come back for their delicious oysters and entrees."}
{"text":"The food here is perfection. Each oyster was delicious and presentation was great. Yes pricey, but it's not like you're eating this every week so imo it was worth it. 

I have never been to an oyster bar so I can't compare with ambiance, but in terms of quality and staff competence, this place was great. You should go.  

About our waiter

Our waiter was super friendly and exceptionally knowledgeable about each oyster's flavour texture and size. His recos were amazing and we were very very impressed! 

The only reason this place doesn't get a 5 is because of location and a weird vibe I got from some of the other staff who kept looking over at us in an odd and uncomfortable way...lol just kidding. The real reason (even though the stuff before is true) is the ambiance. It kind of feels like a breakfast spot/diner. It's just overall kinda boring. You'll see what I mean when you go, so no need to go into detail here...bottom line is oysters were so yummy! Try it and don't miss out. nom nom nom. :)"}
{"text":"I would give it 3.5 stars but Yelp doesn't allow for half a star.
We went for a weekend lunch with another couple. The lunch specials didn't look too appealing to me so we went with the regular menu. 

Apps: I had the Manhattan clam chowder (tomato based broth with veggies) while hubby had the regular Diana's clam chowder (cream based). They were $8 each. We were quite disappointed with the chowders; the Manhattan chowder tasted much like an over priced vegetable soup, not too clammy at all. The cream chowder was lukewarm and mostly potatoes, and not clammy either. We deninitely felt ripped off with the chowders. 
We also had some fresh Oysters to share.
Oysters were really fresh and there were quite a selection to choose from. They are sold as each (range from $1.8 to $4 each), no discount for bulk so the bill does add up fast if you wanna eat a lot of Oysters. 
The server said on Mon and Thu, they have an oyster discount where you can get a dozen for $15 or $20 depends on the oysters. 

Entrees:
1) Lobster and shrimp tagliatelle ($28): delicious rich sauce and generous amount of lobster chunks (mostly claw meats though) and shrimps. Will get this again if I come back here. This was the best choice of entree IMO.

2) Pan seared scallop risotto ($32): only came with 3 scallops, would expect more seafood at that price. Risotto was on the salty side and I didn't like the green peas embedded in it, the peas didn't go with the seafood at all.  I would not recommend this at all; pick a different entree. 

3) Catch of the day: pan seared BC snapper with potatoes and veggies ($25). Fish was freshly delicious. 

4) Wild Halibut fish & chips with home cut fries, coleslaw, and tarta sauce ($25). It was okay, nothing to rave about. They were very stingy with the tarta sauce for a $25 entree. 

Overall, I think this restaurant is over hyped. Food quality is good, however, I can't justify the price. Unsure if we will return"}
{"text":"Mistake!  Yes it was a big mistake coming here for seafood dinner and not for oysters. First of all, if you're looking for fish, ask if the fish are farmed or wild. Salmon is farmed and Almost all the fish on the menu are farmed. The waiter suggested ocean perch $32. It comes with two ocean perch filets, one scallop, one grilled zucchini, maybe a cup of soggy fried rice, two stems of leafy broccoli and mango slaws. Hubby ordered strip loin with two grilled shrimps and seafood chowder. The waiter asked if we want bread. Deep in my mind, this place is expensive and they ask me if I we want bread?  Of course!  Geez what's wrong with restaurants these days!  We had bread but we got a small bun sliced to 8 thin slices with 6 little containers of butter. LOL. Is this a joke?  Water seems to be expensive too. We were served water in small juice glasses with big slices of lemon. Holy smokes!  We spent almost $80 for a lousy dinner. Overall,  I will not recommend this place."}
{"text":"I had the mixed grill dinner and my girlfriend had the branzino. Both were incredible! Our appetizers (seared scallops and grilled octopus) were also to die for!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to get oysters! After I eat I often visit their market to buy a dozen of my favorite east coast oysters home. Lobster rolls packed with lobsters to the brim. Oysters are always super fresh, always been a east coast girl, to me they taste crisp, clean and sweet. Pairs perfectly with a few drops of lemon juice and a drop of Tabasco. One of the best oyster places to visit if you're in Scarborough!"}
{"text":"I can't get over how amazing the food was.  I was really impressed with the service and the restaurant.  The food was so flavourful and you could tell it was fresh."}
{"text":"Yummy food. I love Oysters! Pretty nice they have a 'supermarket' type of market in the back if you would like to bring some oysters home and shuck if yourself.
Great selection of oysters to choose from.
My beef is with the waitress we had (actually went there some time in Aug/sept sometime this year. The waitress with the short and long hair (think she had a tail of some sort) was full of 'tude!
Maybe its just her voice or maybe she was tired of being asked about oysters all day who knows. Im not an expert by any means, but to have her explain the oysters to me was quite the annoyance. She spoke quite loudly and super duper fast! Easy to get confused when she has more than 12 kinds of oysters to explain. She sounded annoyed. Hospitality is not her thing. Went with my folks so I can imagine how bad they would feel if I wasnt there to clarify her. After her annoyance she came back with this fake niceness that seemed a bit condescending. I did notice everyone else's table had a bread basket except us, I was wondering if it was due to what we ordered. She plonked condiments in front of us and explained the oyster sauces in the super duper speedy fast way she did for the oysters themselves. One that she claimed over and over was a mild one was actually not and was quite salty. 
Anyhoot, did not have a good feeling from her right from the first explanation. 
3 stars for the food - the stars should have been higher but due to her 2 stars knocked down."}
{"text":"Walked in on a Friday night while we are on diet, place wasn't crowded. Pretty cozy environment. Wide selection of oyster. Because we are on diet, we order dozen of oyster, appetizer for two, a grilled fish and a pasta for dinner. Oysters are fresh, with three sauces. French kiss oyster was great and the fresh scallop was the best! The portions are large, grilled octopus was my favorite, not chewy but tender and soft!"}

{"text":"I've been to Diana's a few times and if it wasn't for the distance, I would probably visit a lot more. My friends and I made a reservation for 6 on a Thursday and when I arrived the restaurant wasn't too busy. At around 7 was when things got busier and the waiters took longer to come around and check up on us which was understandable considering the number of diners. They were friendly and always reassured us that water or the menu was coming and apologised for the wait which was nice. Service was great and it's one of the things I enjoy about Diana. 

Food was great too, as always. I got the steamed lobster, 2 pounds with rice and grilled veggies and the bill for that came up to $66. The number seems daunting but for what you paid for, it's very reasonable. The lobster meat was tender and not overly cooked. I love the rice that comes with it, it's nicely seasoned and the grilled vegetables makes for a great accompaniment.

Friends got the steamed mussels and while I'm not a fan, it was pretty good too. Again, the meat wasn't rough but instead tender so that you can actually taste the genuine mussels.

I'd recommend this place to anyone who's a seafood lover. The oysters are always fresh and always a favourite. The restaurant itself is nice and has a patio for those wanting to eat outside."}
{"text":"Slow service wait times of over an hour for food don't impress me especially for the premium price tag. I'll break down the review into two parts service and food. The only good thing that they seemed to learn from their Lawrence location was the need for a large waiting area which was cozy and comfortable which was nice to see but it makes sense when you are unable to provide food in a timely fashion leading to long wait times. 

Service - from seating to when my oysters finally arrived was a total wait time of 60 minutes; despite the server asking us if we wanted the oysters first or just everything as it became available; we chose to have items arrive as they became available. Despite asking the question our oysters still arrived before any food and the actual main course took an additional 10 minutes making a grand total wait time of 1 hour and 10 minutes. For a place with a premium reputation it baffles me that the service quality lacks so much. Examples include missed orders, servers reaching over your shoulders to clear plates, to giving you the bill without asking for it. When we pressed the server regarding the long wait for food his response was \"cant you see its busy?\". With a max seating capacity of over 200 people it boggles my mind how there are only two people at the oyster bar opening oysters. Its like the old saying of the grocery store running out of milk. Take a look at the pictures yourself does the restaurant look busy? enough said. The worst service was at the end where the server just brought the bill to the table despite us wanting to order some drinks. 

Food - we ordered two dozen oysters and half a dozen clams, shared 2 soups and 5 main courses. The soups were sub par and overpriced for what you get. The clam chowder had not much clam meat and the lobster bisque was absent of lobster. I can understand a $5 soup not having much meat but a $10 soup should have at least some meat. The main course took a whopping 1hr 10minutes to arrive after the one hour wait for oysters. Of our 5 mains only 4 arrived when we brought it to our servers attention he said he would put in the order again for us but would take another 30 minutes! Way to piss off your customer even more. The quality of the food was disappointing most of the food was too salty or over cooked. Portion sizes were small and once again lacking meat *surprise* *surprise*. 

If you are looking for the quality known from their Lawrence location I would suggest going back to their original location as the new location is not even close in terms of service and food. The level of service and food to price level is inconsistent and you can get better for less elsewhere. It seems like they are still trying to get things right but just a disappointing start."}
{"text":"Originally I thought I was ordering from Diana's Oyster farm market but ordered from the wrong place at Diana's Oyster in Markham instead.  It's more expensive to get oyster at the restaurant/bar.

I had Oysters from B.C, Rhode Island , W.A, and Ireland . The oyster from Ireland taste like sea water with salt and had more of a smelly taste.  Last one was rotten and had a foul taste. 

32 pieces came up to $128.48 after taxes .
If you get it from the farm it would probably be half the price."}
{"text":"I think Diana's is a pretty average seafood restaurant. The clam chowder was good, it had a decent amount of clams in it, and the fried calamari was okay. The batter was a bit soggy and it came with some fried zucchini which was odd lol. I believe there are oyster specials on Wednesday's as we ordered a dozen of Fanny Bay's. The dish that I was most disappointed about though was the seafood paella. Don't know if it was just a bad batch but the clams I ate were not cleaned properly at all. There was still some sort of sand when I bit into it so obviously it ruined my whole experience there. We should've mentioned that to the waiter but we didn't for some reason. The service was decent though, pretty attentive and knowledgeable about different items on the menu. The prices are pretty high as well so overall don't think we'll be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"Food was good service was good. On valentine's day not bad. Just the lighting had some issues with it flicking had to ask a few time to get fix. Other wise good. But not a good place for date. Cuz the tables are really close to each other. No privacy, especially on a holiday. Good presentation was good. And sizes were big. The flavour a bit a the either sweet sour or bland side. But I'm not complaining, fresh food not too overpriced. It was acceptable. Would go again. But I normally just go to the market for oysters. Loved the filled octopus on the appetizer platter and the grilled calamari, the friend one was good too. Had the clam chowder not bad, did find a bit of seafood grain in it though. Also had the salmon and paella. Salmon was dry on the edges, not a big fan of sour sauce on top,the veggies were really oily(grill I guess mean alot of olive oil). The paella was nice, the rice cooked soft, the shrimps and mussels were big and fresh.... The crawfish on the side.... Was interesting. 

We didn't order wine cuz we were light drinkers and would need to drive home, the bill was about $140 after tax and a generous tip for two :) 

Not bad for this kind of restaurant. :)"}
{"text":"Located in a ghetto part of Scarborough no one would believe you could find fresh and delicious seafood down in this neck of the woods.
I've been coming here for years and I have to honestly say this place never disappoints. Whether it be a large group or an intimate dinner for two this place caters to all.
Hubby and I arrived a tad early for our 6pm reservation on a Friday night and the place was just starting to fill up. The hostess kindly greeted us and led us to our table, past the oyster bar where the bartender also warmly greeted us and around the frosted glass division to our table for two.
Our waiter came over shortly and went over the specials for the evening. He was great at describing dishes and was very informative and knowledgeable about the menu.
Of course when your at an oyster bar you have to order some oysters. We tried some Fanny Bays and  Malpeques. Both were super fresh, creamy, and clean. I love topping them with a squirt of lemon and some freshly shredded horseradish. However if you want to amp it they also bring over a caddy with seafood sauce, hot sauce, and an onion vinaigrette.
Next the waiter brought over some warm rolls and butter which was a good palate cleanser before our appetizers arrived.
Crab Cakes - Served with chipotle aioli atop an arugula salad
I've had my share of crab cakes and I have to say Diana's always does it right. The meat is always fresh tasting and ample with a golden exterior and a flavourful meaty interior. The aioli is a perfect creamy accompaniment to add a touch of heat.
For mains we both ended up ordering the same thing which was the priciest fish dish on the menu but definitely worth it!
Chilean Sea Bass - Miso brushed with potato parsnip smash, King oyster mushrooms, balsamic honey glazed beets and romesco sauce
First of all just by looks alone the plating was a feast for the eyes and the portion was quite substantial for a fish dish! The fish itself was perfectly executed with a nice crispy skin and buttery flakey meat. I loved the addition of the creamy and tangy romesco sauce and the mound of sweet and nutty parsnip mash was a hearty addition.

Finally I could not pass up dessert
Warm Flourless Chocolate Cake with French Vanilla Ice Cream and a Berry Compote
Definitely one of my favourite types of desserts. Who doesn't love a warm melt in your mouth chocolate cake paired with cool and creamy vanilla ice cream. Plus that berry compote added just the right amount of sourness to cut through that rich dessert. I did not leave a crumb behind!
I was so into devouring my dessert that I didn't even take a moment to steal a bite of hubby's dessert. He got the Tiramisu and was equally into his dessert as I was with mine! Again no crumbs left behind!

Diana's never disappoints and today was no exception. Yes it is a pricey restaurant for it's location but your getting high quality fresh seafood prepared to perfection with the utmost service. What more could you ask for? I for one am glad to have such a gem close by without having to trek all the way downtown!"}
{"text":"This place is obviously for seafood fans! Their memu has various kind of oysters and provide you each oyster's name and locations where oysters are from. (This place has a oyster bar that people can see) Their service was a bit quick and the food was excellent for having lunch with friends. In addition, this place has a great atmosphere if you have a plan to out for dinner date. Moreover, I had tried to have their seafood pasta which had cooked with mussel. Be honest, the taste was a little salty so i guess you may need a glass of white wine if you order this. However, my whole assessment of this restaurant is this place is worth coming if you are seafood lover :)"}
