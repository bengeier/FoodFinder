{"text":"Think about a small, cozy and very welcoming place. It's almost like having coffee at your own house. The barista is extremely nice and although they don't accept debit or credit he offered us to pay another day. Ps: loved the attitude.   The coffee itself was very good. I've ordered an espresso and my girlfriend a latte. Both were well prepared and the presentation was very good.   It is also very cheap. If you are in the neighbourhood stop by and enjoy some moments."}
{"text":"Nothing special , especially when you have have Sam James a few blocks West. I ordered a flat-white which resembled to brown diluted water with a flair of milk. Probably , the serving female barista didn't know how to make a proper flat-white. Hopefully , next time :-)"}
{"text":"Great little neighbourhood cafe near K-Town. Prices are very reasonable and staff are friendly. Comfortable spot to hang out with an old school vibe. Solid croissants. Cash only. Would definitely stop by again."}
{"text":"I came to check out the common after several recommendations, and after reading reviews on yelp, i kind of knew what to expect (no menu, cash only type thing). So i get there, and the place is super packed. The customers are definitely a particular type (i.e. hipsters) and they know it. It almost felt like a conscious, purposeful display of hipster-ness, and it's a collective effort from the cafe and its patrons. Anyway, i'm getting off topic because I am old and \"hipsters\" are just a younger generation thing that i don't get.   So I had no idea where to even order since there's no cash register. One girl behind the counter was chatting with someone else, and a guy seemed busy. He asked me what i'd like, I gave him my order, paid, and left. I thought the whole \"cool\" part of not having a menu was to force people to interact. Let me say that there was less interaction here than I've had in any other coffee shop. No \"hi\" or \"how are you\".   I know a lot of people really liked their espresso, so I got a latte. It was okay at first, but after a while it tasted burnt and started to give me a headache (only one other coffee gives me headaches -- Tim Hortons), i ended up throwing away half of it.   Meh."}
{"text":"This is my go to coffee place in the Annex.  Amazing espresso drinks.  Limited seating but the coffee is much, much better than the chain coffee in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"espresso drinks were good and almond croissant was awesome. Coming back soon!"}
{"text":"very white, hipster, gentrifying the neighbourhood and driving out low income residents kind of vibe."}
{"text":"Beside the fact that they charge in cash and they have no menu which this one is strange but the couple of times that I was there I liked their espresso. Unlike so many other fancy cafes that they cant even make a good espresso and they charge you a lot here in The Common they know how to pull a good espresso. And i like the vibe and descent style."}
{"text":"?????????2??50?????????????????????  ?????????  Wifi ??????"}
{"text":"What can I say - pleasantly surprised by this unassuming, understated little cafe smack bang in the Annex. They do an amazing flat white,  or a 'Common' as they refer to it. A lovely space to work if you can get a seat as it is pretty small. A nice place to chill too with a couple of outdoor chairs. Great barista and great prices for an excellent cup of coffee!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed hanging out at this cafe and enjoyed their flat white. It's a tiny place on bloor that there's a high chance of passing by it if you're not paying attention. Luckily, I was following my  google maps.  This place is small but the table are nicely spaced out so you mind your own business. The place only takes cash and there's an ATM inside. They don't have a menu so you just have to know your espresso based drink knowledge and order from what you know. They have a selection of pastries. I ordered flat white and oh man, it was so smooth and rich. I am a fan! Definitely will be back here to chill in a hipster environment while sipping smooth espresso based drink. mmhmmm."}
{"text":"Most fancy coffee places greatly intimidate me, and it didn't help much that there's no written menu. But the person working there was patient and very kind. I've been there twice, once I got an americano and another I got an iced vanilla americano and both times it was amazing. The barista even listened to my mumble about how I wanted a lot of syrup in the cold one to make it very sweet. Definitely one of THE best coffees I've ever had, and at amazing prices. ($2 for the americano, and $4 for the vanilla iced one)"}
{"text":"A quaint little place on Bloor that is my one of my fave places to go to for croissants and coffee! It's relatively new but has the look and feel of having been there for decades. You feel very comfortable when you walk in. Staff is friendly and always willing to help you make a decision when you can't decide between their many treats.  Be sure to try their almond croissants - They are very generous with the almond filling!  So yummy!"}
{"text":"This is pretty nice little hipster coffee bar. The inside has an old church kind of vibe which reminds me of new folk music.  The coffee is great. I like the fact that you have a choice between dark and medium roasts for an Americano. The latte I had came in a tall glass and tasted great without sugar which is kind of my coffee test. The only down side is they have no ice. It was a warm sunny day and my wife wanted something cold but all they have is hot drinks. The only option was that they'd give you a cup to go across the street and get some ice from Future's bakery."}
{"text":"Okay, so at first I was like \"Where the %$#& is your menu and why don't you list the prices of your pastries?\" I was also a bit pissed they had no signage informing you that it's a CASH ONLY coffee shop (luckily RBC has a branch two blocks away, or you can use the ATM in their basement). Then I was a bit confused as to why they also don't believe in providing any sort of trash receptacle. By the time I took my seat I realized I was having a full on hipster establishment experience -sort of like that episode in Girls where Ray's coffee shop competition is this cafe across the street that doesn't provide lids for their coffee cups and everyone's gender is up for debate.  My initial instinct was to fight my surroundings, but then I let down my defenses and opened myself up to the philosophical and informed energies of my fellow cafe dwellers. To my left sat an urban planner developing what appeared to be the design for a parking structure and surrounding buildings. To my right sat a masters student working on a thesis on the modern day role of women in informing policy. I suddenly found myself caring more about the human experience and connecting to a part of myself that I had previously murdered in my attempt to pay rent and splurge on expensive clothing. Maybe instead of selling my soul in the name of corporate profit, I should be pursuing some sort of journalistic mission and ending my support of multinational conglomerates like Starbucks?   So basically I come here now whenever I feel an existential crisis coming on and I make sure to come fully prepared with adequate coinage."}
{"text":"I get the whole rustic coffee shop feel that is all the rage and I'm all for it but I think The Common takes it to far by not even having a menu.   It is a little ridiculous to walk into a coffee shop and not have a menu to scope out!   I ended up ordering a cappuccino which was okay. What was cool is the milk they use is from a local organic producer and you could taste the quality. The espresso in the cappuccino wasn't too special.   The seating was okay but it all looked bare. I wouldn't recommend this spot unless you're getting something to go and know what you want!"}
{"text":"Looks like one of those hippy west coast coffee places for a great cup of coffee, but if looks is what you are going for, then this is ur place. No menu, okie fine, I guess I know what I want. But the weak and bland cup of cappuccino I got was just disappointing and they only take cash..em, that's not west coast hip at all..."}
{"text":"This place doesn't have a menu. Most things of espresso based. So know what you order before you order.   They only take cash! So be prepared.   I ordered the mocha and my partner got a latte. Both drinks were quite smooth in taste which was nice. Not overly fancy with the foam and what not.  A cute coffee and snack spot to visit more often."}
{"text":"I've been there twice. It's a very simple, very hipster coffee place that probably bristles at anyone calling it a cafe. I'm not a fan of the concept because it seems very deliberate.  The coffee smells great. It's what led me into there the first place. As some other reviewer said, it is really easy to pass by. The decor is all white and the seating is limited. There are maybe 4 small tables and a \"common\" bench.  I love it for the great coffee. Reasonable price and better quality than the chains."}
{"text":"Very loud annoying music, don't take credit or debit (common this is 2018) they force you to take cash out of the atm in the back which charges 2.50$ a transaction for a 4$ coffee meaning I'm spending 6.50$ total just to get a cup of coffee.. I mean common!"}
{"text":"This place looks like it would be a nice little coffee shop. Unfortunately the staff is rude, the coffee is mediocre at best, they use a size 4 font for their tea menu, literally can't read it without glasses, the tables are TINY, with complimentary tiny uncomfortable kindergarten chairs, and the prices are steep for the quality. Good for a quick run in, and free (very slow) WiFi, but avoid sitting down if you stand taller than 5'10."}
{"text":"Hands down, best americano. Staff is good, not enough seating sometimes and it looks like a hole in the wall you would easily pass (done that myself a few times). I've only ever ordered from the College location, but the Bloor one just looks slightly better. Wish they were always open. They do private parties"}
