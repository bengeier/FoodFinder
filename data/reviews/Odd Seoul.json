{"text":"The food here is amazing! My friend and I had walked up and down the Strip and completely missed this place! We walked into a bar and asked the bartender what she recommended and she pointed us across the street to Odd Seoul. The food was SO YUMMY! It's a tapas style place, so you can order and share. I wish there had been a bit more description on the menu--I felt a little silly having to ask the server about items. That being said, the servers were very attentive--filled our water glasses, made sure we were happy.  In some ways they were more attentive than I'd like--I'd wanted to lick the plates clean but they kept clearing them before I could. My friend was glad I couldn't lick them! :)"}
{"text":"\"The Manager\" refused to serve a group of 8 who were coming in for drinks before last call at 1:30am, saying \"were more of a restaurant.\" They were not packed and there was a table that accommodate all of us so I'm not exactly sure why or what made her think we were not worthy to be served in her restaurant, whether we came in for drinks or food. We will be sure to never visit this establishment again."}
{"text":"Cool bar but disappointed with service. My cousin ordered a drink without realizing there was honey in it, which she is allergic to. When she asked for a replacement, after one sip, they said that they would still have to charge for both drinks.  No apologies and didn't even ask if she was ok."}
{"text":"the worst service I have ever received in my entire life. worst manager I have ever delt with. I was personally insulted by the staff. I cannot believe this place continues to exist with such contempt for their customers. forced gratuity of 20% while getting drinks only. wouldn't split the bill. incompetent management."}
{"text":"Finally checked this place out and overall had a good time.   Great venue. It's tiny, bustling and industrial. Music selection is great, although it's a bit loud. There's no sign on the outside but finding it shouldn't be a problem. We had to wait for an hour to get seated (Sat night) but not uncommon for a place like that around Ossington.  Food was decent. Here's what we ordered:  OS Wings - 3 full wings (6 pieces in total) came in our order. Not bad but the sauce was overly sweet and needed more balance. Wouldn't order it again.  The Loosey - The meat was delicious, sauce tasted good and anything on challah is great. Only complaint is there was way too much sauce. Not something I'd crave but I'd give it a 2nd chance.  Chimichurri Short Rib Bowl - This was crazy good. Great combination of flavours and the meat was on point. It came with a side of sauce which looked like what was on the wings, so we left it off. At $20 it's overpriced, but I would definitely order it again."}
{"text":"Delicious food and exceptional prices. Really friendly staff. The bulgogi cheesesteak and curry squash poutine are a must. Just a really long wait but you can give your name and have a drink at any nearby bars which are all really lovely"}
{"text":"I love this place!! The food is just amazing! The flavors and fusion of ingredients is something that I wouldn't find anywhere else. If you go it's a must to try the squash poutine, the loosey and bulgogi cheese steak also the kimchi fried rice is quite good and so is the torched mackerel. Beware of the lineups as there are not many tables.  DELICIOUS! Can't wait to go back :)"}
{"text":"We came early on a Thursday night and sat on the bar . The place is small on the dark side with great music. The decor is super cool with a unique tap !   The dark lager was great , I had the smash cocktail which was done with fresh mint, honey and a lot of care ! In fact any house cocktail was done with love.   But the food ! Omg ! Amazing !!   We had squash poutine - roasted cubes of squash with cheese and fusion sauce - just amazing !   We tried pretty much all the small plates for 5-7 dollars each and every thing was great : my fav the cheese steak!   Dare I say it : better then Momofuku!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were looking for a place to eat on Ossington before seeing a play at the Lower Ossington Theatre and we noticed Odd Seoul and went in.  The menu looked interesting and the cocktails sounded delicious.  There is the choice between platters for $25 or snacks.  We opted for the snacks, all were scrumptious except one.  The Loosey was off the charts delicious (it is like a Korean big mac).  Then the Korean fried rice was the best fried rice I had ever had in my life.  Next was the avocado slaw that was just pure Umami.  The streamed bun was fluffy and filled with spicy pork, yum, The squash poutine was a bit bland and off the mark, it really didn't have any stand out flavour.    All of the food was surprisingly fantastic and bill was extremely reasonable for a dinner on Ossington and the server was absolutely fantastic as our water glass was refilled about 10 times.  The servers know their food is spicy and they are on their game."}
{"text":"SO good. Such great service. Servers are attentive, nice and personable. The food is just soooooooooooo good, I don't even know how to tell you guys. I ate everything on the menu besides the rice stuff. oh my god. Way better than Swish by Han (their sister restaurant), service wise. I just don't know what else I can rave about. DEFINITELY RECOMMENDED."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my time at the odd Seoul !  The cocktail and the food are really good and surprising.  I also loved the atmosphere and the service !"}
{"text":"Oddseoul has a laid back and casual vibe (although sometimes the servers can be a little too casual). There's a great selection of foods to share and snack on that aren't expensive. Pretty much every dish we've ordered has been incredible. My favourite is the avocado slaw.   The space is fine but I'm not a fan of the high top shared tables. The chairs aren't super comfortable and it can be annoying to share a table with a group of strangers. Otherwise, this place is great. It's perfect for a late night snack and drink."}
{"text":"This has got to be one of my favourite places to eat at. The best food item on their menu in my opinion is the Squash Poutine. Although all the other items I've tried here have always been good as well. This place does not disappoint and the food is very reasonably priced. My husband and I ordered 5 items on the menu and our bill was only around $45!   We usually go on a weekend and this place is packed and we always end up having to sit at the bar. This time we visited on a Monday and were finally able to find a seat at the tables. The only thing that bothered me on this visit was that there was water leaking from the ceiling right next to my seat. Other than that the service here is pretty good every time I've been and the food comes out very quickly! I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Squash poutine heaven! That is the most memorable dish I've ever had! Forget the usual gravy on fries.These are fried squash cubes with (Japenese?) curry sauce on top. We received some complimentary dishes on the house and heck, the food here is pretty darn good! My favourite were the squash poutine, kimchi fried rice (more like sticky rice), and shrimps. This is a great place to share food with two or three friends and have a candle lit, cozy time together. My friends loved the drinks here and I enjoyed my very cheap can of beer! Loud, nice music. Everyone's happy and full by the end of the night. Thank you for the great experience, ya Odd Seoul!"}
{"text":"7pm, Saturday night, with a friend.  Everything was delicious: the cocktails, the food! Specially good: the mackerel torched.  Others were tasty, but quite greasy.  Ambiance is very nice, crowd too.  5 stars service!  Will come back!"}
{"text":"The absolute best bao in Toronto. Awesome old school hip-hop soundtrack. Stiff drinks. My only quibble: the kitchen doesn't understand timing; orders rarely come out together. But the food is too good to be polite--eat and order some more; hopefully by that time your guests will have theirs too."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time today and was very happy I finally got to go. I've heard many great things about this joint. Thrilled to say my experience lived up to the hype around this place.  First, in terms of the actual space, it's very small. There is probably less than thirty seats so it's a good thing we went on a Monday night versus the weekend. The decor is cool, very rustic and simple. I appreciate the urban feel the place maintains.   Since I went with a couple of friends, we ordered a bunch of different dishes to try. We were big fans of the squash poutine, bulgogi cheesesteak, spicy pork neck rice bowl, the pork dumplings (special) and the blue cheese fried tofu (special). We also ordered \"the loosey\" and the tempura chicken with devilled eggs but we didn't really care for these dishes. The loosey was very mayonnaise-rich and the chicken dish was average (but the eggs were good).  The service was great and very on point. The waitresses were experts on the menu and were helpful. The prices are very reasonable too!  Between myself and my two other friends we spent $29 each for a fantastic meal. Loved the explosion of very interesting flavours that most of their dishes have. Somehow they make the flavours work so well in their dishes.   Definitely a high recommendation for this place. The only negative is the crammed nature of the restaurant. But personally, if the food and service is good - I'd eat in a shoebox regardless lol. It depends on how much personal space you can go without."}
{"text":"great place, really good Belgian beer and bulgolgi cheesesteak. would definitely hope they draw a better tiger at the front of the store though"}
{"text":"We love the food here and have been a number of times, but got such a chilly reception from the host last time we went that I was compelled to write a negative post. As we expected, there was a bit of a wait and even though we wanted to be added to the wait list, the host would not let me run down to use their washroom while we waited. The look of disdain on his face when I dared ask was palpable. Anyway, I thought the whole encounter was needlessly rude. Luckily Hawker Bar is just down the road, and we had an amazing meal and experience there instead."}
{"text":"Loved the \"looney\" and the cheesesteak, special pork neck was a bit too spicy and VERY messy to eat, but still, we had a perfect night with great ambience and pretty amazing food."}
{"text":"It didn't take long for the recently opened Oddseoul to become another hot spot in the city. After a visit here, I can see why it's packed every night.  What went in my belly:  Squash Poutine ($7). Crispy cubes of fried squash covered in a delicious sauce that reminded me of Japanese curry. All topped with bits of kimchi and a bit of mayo, it was one delicious mess.   \"The Loosey\" ($5). It's essentially a slider - with a short rib patty topped with kimchi, American cheese and pickles all sandwiched between toasted slices of challah bread. Tasted like a Big Mac...but so, so, soo much better.  Bulgogi Cheesesteak ($5). Just as good as the Loosey...if not better! The meat was nice and tender, the bun was soft and I loved the addition of the grainy mustard in it.   Spicy Scallion & Avocado Slaw ($5). More of a salad than a \"slaw\" but still pretty darn tasty. Chunks of avocado sitting on top of greens and chilis which provided a nice kick.  Beef Short Rib Ssäm Platter ($25). The short ribs, which were mixed with some stir-fried veggies, were tender and tasty. The wraps got pretty messy but the messier, the better right? The platter came with some addictive kimchi fried rice. The $25 price tag may be higher than everything else on the menu but the portion is pretty substantial and is meant to feed two.  Get here early to avoid a long wait!"}
{"text":"Came here for a late dinner, place was pretty full even at 10:30 pm. This place definitely exceeded my expectations. Ordered the bulgogi cheesesteak, squash poutine, the loosey, and tempura chicken with devilled eggs. Each dish tasted amazing, full of flavours and fresh. I highly recommend the squash poutine. The curry and sweetness of the squash was mouth watering. I will be back again to try other dishes!"}
{"text":"Food is great, service is mediocre. Don't go here for dinner though because it'll cost you quite a bit to fill yourself. The food is still quite amazing!  I wrote an in-depth review of this place. Read here:   http://korcan50years.com/2014/01/08/11499/"}
{"text":"Big fan of the vibe and food at Odd Seoul - I come at least 1-2 times a month. The place is great for a drink, snack or a full meal. Some of the standout dishes are the Squash Poutine, Bulgogi Cheesesteak, Steamed Bun, The \"Loosey\". Delicious, saucy and filling snack food that washes down nicely with beer!  Cocktails are also top notch, although you may be waiting a while for one if they're busy.   Check it out - you'll love it."}
{"text":"I thought this through and bounced this occurrence off my colleagues that were with me that night. They are in agreement with what I felt.  Last week Friday I was at the Bellwoods Brewery with a few of my work colleagues. It was insanely busy. So the waitress suggested we try out Odd Seoul while she put us on the waiting list to return there. So we took her advice and made our way to the Odd Seoul. Our party of three entered and requested a table and mentioned that we were waiting for two other guests. The waiter said we can't have a table if we're waiting for two other guests. We found that strange being that it is considered a Korean\dive bar. A dive bar by definition welcomes everyone and doesn't turn away paying customers. We were just looking for a positive experience.   After we were deterred from a group table, I decided to stay for a drink myself. Standing at the bar with the back of chair in my hand ready to sit beside another empty seat and order a drink; the waiter cut me off with his arm and took the seat away from me saying he needed the seat for this lady (Caucasian) and her guess whom it was obvious wasn't there yet. I thought to myself, that's funny after my colleagues and I were just denied a table because our other two guests weren't there yet. I don't know about anyone else. But it came across as if he didn't care for the darker shade of skin. Racism? If I'm wrong the owner should address this! Like I said I pondered on this for a few days and thought it through. My two colleagues are Caucasian and one of them were from out of town. We did not feel welcome! And it was made obvious especially after they left and I stayed behind! There is no fiction here. I wrote the events as if it were caught on camera.   A little bit of hospitality and respect is all we expected! We will never consider this place again as an option! We went back to the Bellwoods Brewery and had an incredible time. They kept us on the list, even after we left and reserved a table for us. Now that's great customer service!  The rating system won't let me leave the star blank for  zero. Even one is undeserving!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Best Korean food I have ever had hands down! The place is small but I have always managed to get a table. Nice atmosphere! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Loud & delicious! Sat at the bar and put up with the cold winter air every time the door opened (often!) but was worth the discomfort for the great flavours and textures.  My wife and i had the wings, loosey,'slaw & short rib ssam.  Next time I would stick to the small dishes and just order 1 of everything for variety.  Laid back vibe, the staff were hip yet not, if that makes any sense.  Just go. $70 incl. a beer & 1 cocktail."}
{"text":"THE FOOD.  I brought a couple of friends here, neither of whom had heard anything about the place beforehand.  They were weirded out by the decor (one of them asked me why we were in a sketchy hipster bar when I'd promised them dinner), but once our food started arriving, they were on board.  The menu is small but carefully chosen; we had a salad to start and then the tempura prawns (recommended by our waitress, and we loved them so much we ordered a second plate).  We tried the squash poutine, which exceeded all of our expectations.  The spicy chicken rice bowl wasn't particularly spicy, but it was filling and delicious.  Definitely worth another visit."}
{"text":"It saddens me to write this review - as Odd Seoul had become my regular late night spot for the past 2-3 years. I can't count how many people I have recommended this place to, let alone how much I have actually spent here. Last night after a concert me and three friends were looking to grab some bites and drinks so we obviously headed right over to Odd Seoul. We were seated right away which was great but then a drip fell from above. This continued every 5 minutes for the duration of the meal - at one point the drip fell into my cocktail. The drip was coming from hockey taped piping overhead. I didn't say anything because the food was good and I didn't want to come across as a snob. When the waitress came at the end to bring the bill I tamely said \"Just to let you know the pipe above us has been dripping on my head/food/cocktail/lap for the whole night.\". I thought hey maybe that would be good to know for the next customer, maybe they would comp my dripped in cocktail, maybe they would just say sorry for that. No. The girl had such an intense superiority complex - she looked at me with a stone cold face and said \"what - you want me to turn the air conditioning off so everyone else has to suffer in here\" and walked away and literally hid in the back kitchen until we left, wouldn't set up the cash machine for anyone else at our table so one person had to pay for it all.  I wish I could just speak directly with management because this girl should be fired immediately. I don't understand why anyone would be so rude, nobody wants air conditioning drips in their drinks! common!"}
{"text":"This is my kind of place: drinks and really good food that goes down well beer. It's not expensive, the music is at a level where you can hear it but it doesn't prevent you from having a good conversation.   It seems primarily to be a bar, but the food is far superior to the drink offerings. I was blown away by the squash poutine (crispy fried chunks of squash covered in a meat gravy, cheese curds, kimchi) and the Loosey (their take on the patty-melt on challah bread). The torched mackerel is more delicate and pairs nicely with the soju,   It's not perfect. The wine list is boring (clearly an after thought) and the cocktaiils are pricey for the quality of mixer ($11 for a boring whiskey drink mixed with what tasted like OJ from concentrate). Stick to the beers which are reasonabl at $5-7. When it gets busier, the service is very slow with only one bartender behind the bar. They should also figure out a way to torch the mackerel without setting the fire alarm off. This happend two or three times while we were there and was a momentary buzzkill.  I'll be back, but only when it's not too busy."}
{"text":"I was a huge fan of Swish By Han, so I figured I'd have to try their second outpost tonight over on the Ossington strip. We arrived at around 6PM on a Friday night and got a table right away. Once I stepped foot inside, OddSeoul's vibe really reminded me of Swish.  My girlfriend and I each started with a cocktail. I'll give them bonus points for their creativity. We had the Liberace and the False Dawn. Both were a great start to the evening.  Our dishes included:  1. Squash Poutine - Great spin on the poutine! The squash was fried lightly, and went well with the gravy and cheese. Kimchi + kewpie mayo were a nice touch too.  2. Torched Mackerel - Apart from torching the little fillet table-side, this dish was pretty standard. Nothing groundbreaking here.  3. O.S. Wings - My favourite dish of the night! The wings were a fair size, fried perfectly, and the sauce was fantastic. I wish Ajuker fried chicken up in Korea town had this sauce. The perfect amount of sweet and spicy! 3 full wings (drum + flat + tip) for $7? I'd come back just for their wings.  4. Beef short rib and chimichurri rice bowl - This was a huge rice bowl meant for sharing. We were told by the waiter that this, along with 3 dishes, would suffice for two people. We then realized that this rice bowl should be shared between 3-4 people. It was a generous serving and was very tasty. The beef short rib was tender and full of flavour. Mixed with the assortment of veggies and fried egg, this reminded me of a modified bibimbap. A delicious, modified bibimbap. We ended up taking some of this home, as we couldn't finish this.  We then finished with soft serve ice-cream, topped with Korean cereal and honey. This was a refreshing end to our meal.   In summary, I'd come back to OddSeoul in a heartbeat. I didn't get the snobby service that I've read about in other reviews. Our waiter was very patient in answering our questions about the menu, whether it was about the cocktails or the mains. He was very friendly and attentive to our table. He made sure empty plates and glasses were always cleared. Along with the delicious food, I'd say this was a great night out."}
{"text":"1st visit - Squash Poutine + Pork Neck Ssam + Kimchi Rice = Awesome!  2nd visit -  All of the above + wings = Still awesome!  3rd visit (yesterday) - Less awesome :(  Why?  Mackerel - it was very small and didn't taste any different than mackerel out of a tin  Spicy Chicken Ssam - very saucy. Just \"OK\".  Music - too loud  Drinks - strong...just the way I like it!  Restrooms - communal"}
{"text":"It was Friday night so it was very busy but we were able to sit at the bar.  We ordered 5 dishes to share and one drink each.  All the dishes were excellent.  Especially the slaw and poutine.  We were able to get a drink and walk out full for about $50 for two."}
{"text":"I'm sorry but this place is one of the only restos that actually lives up to the hype.  The food is always amazing, the drinks are delicious, the atmosphere is perfect.  The squash poutine changed my life."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is trendy, it can be romantic depending who you are with of course. This is my third time going, I brought two of my friends who have never been before even they were taken a back by the delicious food presented in front of them.   We ordered a variety of things such as Bulgogi Cheesesteak sandwich, Chicken Wings, Tofu that was lightly fried but simply mouth watering.   The price always surprises me as the food does not cost that much and the staff is super friendly and attractive.   I highly suggest you go and experience this Korean & French fusion delight."}
{"text":"Love love love this place. Always amazing food, some of the best in the city. Atmosphere is chill, music is loud, cocktails are creative and delicious. Will always come back."}
{"text":"Why haven't I gone here before, it's just around the corner!!!  It's like a hidden gem, I've passed by it, not even knowing it was there.  We visited on a bitter cold Monday night and the place was 1/3 full.  It's dark, but very cozy. Our table position allowed us to peek into the kitchen and see the action.  We ordered:  Drinks: Bulleit Smash (just amaaaaaazzzzziiiinnng). Burboun, honey/mint syrup, mounds of frothy egg white. Just so smooth and easy to drink, not too sweet, boozy but subtle.  Spanish Harlem - reminded me of a well made margarita.   Food:  Wings - I love the sauce it's coated in but wasn't a fan of the wing itself (seemed it was mostly skin and bones, yet huge?). People just love this dish so I'm willing to give it another try  Mackerel - torched at table side. It's a cute little dish and a very small portion. No flavours come through, just bbq'd fish...not spectacular but ok.  Tempura prawns - oh yes, this was a winner! Huge prawns, crunchy tempura coated in a delectable sauce  Bulgogi steak - nicely marinated steak, divine!  The loosey - Korean version of burger.   And then we had a new dish, I didn't catch its name but it's essentially buffalo wing tofu  tempura with blue cheese sauce on the side! That one was pretty delicious. Yes you're eating tempura tofu but it's just well executed and flavours are perfect! Another favourite.  We heard that squash poutine is all the rage but we were full at this point.  The place filled up at times, the servers were beyond nice and attentive.  6 dishes, 5 drinks, full bellies, tipsy heads = $100 + tip. That's a bargain these days!  I'd go back any time, it's really perfect for either a filling dinner or just a snack."}
{"text":"I can't stop thinking about this place since a friend brought me! It's a sort of Korean tapas-type place,. We ordered the Loosey, Bulgogi cheese steak and  the Squash Poutine among others and everything was absolutely delicious!  Our waitress was very attentive, but the music was crazy loud that you basically have to shout across the table to have a conversation.  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"It was a little loud, but not too loud to hold a conversation. Portion sizes vary greatly between items. The bulgogi cheese steak was so good we ended up ordering a second one to share! All in all really nice, really cool. Bathrooms are a little questionable, but they are unisex -- a big deal for nonbinary people such as myself!!"}
{"text":"Everything are over $20, not worth it at all, my girlfriend were so disappointed by the food they offered. Worst spicy pork bone soup ever. And the bogo go is also really bad and it's 17 dollars !!!"}
{"text":"Coming out of hiding just long enough to spit on this place.  In a nutshell, Oddseoul's owner is a jerk. He's rude, condescending, obnoxious and generally has no business dealing with patrons. I would rather light my money on fire than give it to him.  He slammed the front door in my friend's face after she very politely asked to come in five minutes before they opened because it was pouring out. He was at least polite enough to warn her by yelling, \"You can't come in now. It's not possible.\"  The service is sub par at best with a boring drink menu to help round things out. Soju, for those of you that haven't had it, is very similar in taste to cheap vodka having the same chemically taste, but at least they over charge for it.  Can't wait for this place to go under along with the rest of the new bars that have just discovered reclaimed wood and 90s hip-hop. Sandwiches named after cigarettes and a Korean/American confederate flag? Keepin' it real...boring."}
{"text":"Great place and more importantly excellent food. The sizzler sirloin was delicious especially since it was paired with radish wraps! Also the steamed buns are a must! Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"The food here is really good! The sweet potato poutine and the bulgogi cheese steak sandwich is to die for. The wings are good too. Definitely need to try it if you haven't!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, yummy drinks, great chill ambience.  Stumbled across this place randomly while walking down Ossington after dinner and bar hopping. Decided to go in for drinks and ended up ordering some snacks - best decision all night! At the recommendation of a couple there, we got the \"poutine\" which has a bunch of Korean ingredients; just get it, you'll love it! Also tried the bulgogi cheesesteak; your standard bulgogi served on cheesesteak hoagie, but points for creativity (how have I never thought of this??) and quite good. Creative libations perfectly balanced."}
{"text":"This place is straight up OG!   There were 2 of us, and a plan to demolish the menu. With some guidance from our host, we narrowed it down to 5 dishes.  First up was the torched Mackerel accompanied by a Soy based dipping sauce with pickled ginger and scallions. The fish is brined, lending a lovely understated salinity to the flesh. And if that wasn't good enough, they brought out an industrial blowtorch to our table and flamed that bad boy! All in an effort to release it's natural oils. One of the lighter dishes we had tonight, but probably one of my faves.  Up next on the docket was the Acorn Squash Poutine. Like many reviews below, it didn't disappoint. The squash was slightly crispy, giving way to an unctuous creamy centre. The power of mother nature people! The Japanese Curry based \"gravy\" was subtle and alluring. Loved the acidity and crunch of the Kimchi on top, and damn son, anything with Kewpie Mayo is a winner!  Their play on Ebi Mayo is the best I've had in the city. Simply because the Shrimp was so spectacularly Shrimpy in a good way. Super fresh, meaty, and tender. Loved the uber crunchy coating that served as the perfect clinging territory for the spicy mayo.  My friend had the Loosey. Think of it as Korea's answer to the Big Mac. She doesn't usually enjoy Big Macs, but she totally bigged this up. Now that's a compliment!  One of the specials of the night was a Buffalo style Tofu with Blue Cheese dipping sauce. The interior of the tofu was silken in texture, and the outside reminded me of a McNugget. I really don't know how they accomplished that texture, because I've never had anything like it before, but it was soo good. If you're a vegetarian and wonder what Buffalo Wings taste like, get this! You won't regret it.  Lastly, we had the epic Fred Flintstone sized chicken wings coated in a spicy-sweet garlicky sticky concoction. I am glad we were sitting in the back of the restaurant away from prying eyes, because there is no graceful way of eating these. The wing is still connected to the drumette and is huge with a thick layer of sauce coating it. It was super yummy though! Well worth the mess.  Service was spot on too. Water was consistently refilled, plates were changed, and our server was incredibly helpful in talking us through the menu. Moreover, we were not rushed, and the food came out at a great pace.  An awesome first experience. Can't wait to return when their menu rotates!"}
{"text":"In a love and hate relationship with this place,  The food for what you pay for is outstanding. The service which I think is intended to be this way is pretentious and hipsterish in its most egregious form.  Sometimes I get a craving and sometimes I just walk by thinking to myself I can't stomach the bullshit that night"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service, the pork belly mandoo, squash poutine and the steamed bun (pork) are recommended. The Bulleit Smash is also excellent but stay away if you can't have egg whites.  Also, no sign outside so look for 90 Ossington."}
{"text":"OS chicken wings are too saucy, it taste better after I wipe off the sauce Squash poutine is good Loosey burger was not bad, the taste is very similar to McDonald's Big Mac, but better."}
{"text":"Good food, great drinks & decent prices for the area...the bulgogi cheesesteak was definitely the best thing I ate there."}
{"text":"A friend and I came here on a Thursday night and they were quite busy. Walked in and left our names and received a call 30 minutes later to say our table was ready.    We ordered the kimchi and pork fried rice ($10). It was good but I've had better home made ones before. It wasn't anything special. We also got an order of the O.S. wings ($7) and they were amazing. It was the right amount of spicy and sweet. Highly recommend this dish. Friend also suggested we try the smoke pork belly mandoo ($8). I was afraid that it would be overly oily as it's fried dumplings, but they did not disappoint. I was very meaty on the inside and was not super greasy on the outside. To top off \"thirst thursdays\", we ordered a bottle of grapefruit infused soju ($15). For people who love soju and grapefruit, this is definitely a must try. The grapefruit flavour is potent in the drink. It's meant to be shared so it comes in a bottle and several shot glasses.   Overall, it was a great experience. Service was great, food was great. Would come back to try more things on the menu."}
{"text":"Came in for a snack and drinks (soju).  Tried the bulgogi cheesesteak and the tempura chicken.  I liked cheesesteak much more!  Small portion sizes, so you should order a bunch of dishes if you're coming here for a real meal.  Downstairs has some funky decor.... right outside of the washrooms has some chairs and some other contraption.  Funky is the only way I can describe it.  Overall a cozy place for a bite and drinks (large parties beware though, since space is limited).  Service was friendly."}
{"text":"Great music, great vibe, good drinks, great snack, but do not eat a whole meal here. The food is super salty and saucy. It goes great with drinking but is bad to eat too much of."}
{"text":"If I've learned something from Odd Seoul, it's to avoid being a \"one trick pony\".  Confused?  Don't worry, I'll explain.  The Order: O.S. Wings, Squash Poutine, Tempura Prawns, and the Bulgogi Cheesesteak.  The O.S. Wings were the hit of the evening.  Perfectly cooked and juicy, and heavy on the sweet & spicy chili sauce.  And surprisingly, they were FULL giant chicken wings.  For comparison sake, the three giant wings are the equivalent of six wings that you would get from any standard restaurant.  But unfortunately, that's as good as the food got.  The Squash Poutine features a savory Japanese curry instead of gravy.  But instead of featuring the dominant flavour of curry and squash, the dish ends up competing too much with the flavours of the kimchi, pickled beets and garlic mayo.  The Tempura Prawns were okay, but the prawns were completely overshadowed by the giant lemon wedge on the plate.  Four very puny-sized prawns covered in sriracha mayo, that looked like they were over-garnished to compensate for their size.  Finally, we finished with the Bulgogi Cheesesteak.  If this sandwich is supposed to be resemble bulgogi, then they need to change their name to \"Odd McDonald's\".  It was basically loose ground beef that was slathered with garlic mayo on a french roll.  So have you figured out what I meant about being a \"one trick pony\"?  With exception for the wings, the common theme among all the dishes was mayo.  Maybe that's just bad luck with ordering, but I find it hard to believe that no one else hasn't noticed the same dominant condiment in many of their dishes.  I get that it's supposed to be Korean-fusion, but assembling flavours that compete with each other, and slathering everything with mayo isn't fusion.  For fusion to truly work, you need authentic cuisine elements that COMPLIMENT each other.  That being said, PERHAPS this place isn't about the food?  As an establishment, Odd Seoul has a great vibe and lots of personality.  There's no sign on the exterior.  You could walk by this place many times (which I have), and think that the establishment has been condemned.  I've eaten at their next-door neighbours numerous times and whenever I saw Odd Seoul, I thought it was always under construction.  The interior has a great dive bar atmosphere; from the retro ghetto blaster stereos, to the scarred brick walls, to the empty ammunition boxes at the bar counter.  On a weird side note, if this place is supposed to be a Korean dive bar, then why is the food served on Chinese dinnerware?  If I were to make a return visit, I think I'd come back for the drinks. They feature a small, but flavourful variety of cocktails (I recommend the \"Liberace\"). Great atmosphere, good music, friendly staff, and good drinks. But if Odd Seoul is really intent on being an interesting place for food, then they should really consider revamping their menu options and putting that pony out to pasture."}
{"text":"Nice little bar in the ossington area. We got the Bulleit smash and some tequila based drink. The Bulleit smash was well made. The food is served tapas style - we got the cheesesteak, the loosey and the wings. The cheesesteak was very good and had a great burst of flavors. The wings were whole wings in a crisp batter and a spicy sauce. They were a tad salty."}
{"text":"Went on a Thursday night around 9pm. It was freezing outside and warm inside. The place was packed and we awkwardly stood in the only walkable space while we waited for a seat.... it took a long time for anyone to recognize our presence and the waiter was constantly squeezing by us so I started thinking it might be a bad idea to eat here.   A few minutes later we were seated at the bar and had drinks in front of us.  The bartender didn't pay any attention to us unless we wanted something, in which case he did it right away, the perfect amount of service. We had some kind of leafy salad, beefy wings, and squash poutine and oh dear me was it ever good. The tastiest of the tasty. Award winning noms. Mouth parties and all. We left happy as clams. Possibly happier."}
{"text":"Very cool spot. The food was amazing! We ordered the Hamburger, the hot bun, and the rice dish of the \"extras\" menu. All were delicious, and extremely reasonably priced.   Ordered a stiegl tall can and a glass of wine for drinks. Stiegl is a favourite of mine, and was $6 for a tall can. The glass of wine was around $10 and was very good as well.   The staff were very friendly and attentive. Only downside is the place is too popular and it's hard to get a table.   I will definitely be back. Thanks for a great meal!"}
{"text":"The food was incredible. For the most part the meals are small portions, but great for sharing amongst many people (you can also tell they are not the healthiest meals - so small portions is a benefit).   The cocktails were wonderful. The restaurants atmosphere itself is hugely busy and dark - but if this does not bother you, it will not ruin the experience. On the pricier end, but worth it!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favourite place on Ossington. The food is pretty close to perfection on so many levels. Atmosphere is really chill as well. The wings are killer, the loosey is amazing and the tempura chicken with deviled eggs."}
{"text":"Very tasty & creative menu and love that they're tapas so it's easy to order a bunch of stuff and share with your friends.  It's definitely a snackbar with yummy drinks rather than a plce for a full on dinner.  Their menu is simple and is showed on a lit-up banner, which I love!  Everything on the menu has a East-meets-West theme:  O.S. Wings ($5).  This reminded me of Korean spicy fried chicken I used to eat when I was in Korea, so it was a trip down memory lane.  Super saucy and tasty, it's no wonder why this is one of Oddseoul's popular dishes.  The Loosey\" ($7), which was pretty much a gourmet Big Mac.  It's a slider made with short rib and ground brisket with tomato, lettuce, cheese, pickles and Kimchi hollandaise sauce.  This was one of my favourites of the night!  Soft, tender meat with an explosion of flavours.  Spicy Scallion & Avocado Slaw ($5), another dish that we had to get 2 orders of.  Although it's called \"slaw\" it's not heavy but light with sesame dressing, which I enjoyed.  However, i thought there weren't enough avocado's for it to be called scallion & AVOCADO slaw.     Squash Poutine ($7).  The deep fried squash were pretty yummy but very filling.  It had mayo, kimchi and a curry-tasting sauce all over it - what a beautiful & tasty mess.  Tempura Prawns ($7).  The prawns were just perfect.  Crispy Tempura on the outside and juicy on the inside.  One order comes with 4 big prawns with spicy mayo dressing.  Beef Short Rib with Chimichurri sauce.  With a slew of veggies like mushroom, peppers, carrots, zucchini on top of kimchi fried rice, cilantro and baby lettuce, marinated beef and egg, it reminded me of bibimbap (korean fried rice).  This was very tasty and they were generous with the portion.   I can't wait to go back and try their mackerel and pork buns next time!"}
{"text":"I've only been once, maybe i got lucky, but it was one of the my favorite dinning  experiences.  so, odd seoul? i mean the name conjures up some good juju, right?  it's what first lured me.  then other yelpers pictures of the dark moody spot, may favorite kind for night drinking. seemed a no-brainier when you don't know what to choose.  i'm from out of town, i was staying around the corner, so it all seemed perfect.  we get there. it's packed. the host puts us on the wait list and when i say we'll just grab a drink at the bar, she politely says, \"oh no, sorry, we have a no standing rule\".  I didn't have a phone she could call, so she says come back in 45 minutes. Hit a drink at a nearby establishment and came back just as some bar seats opened.  my favorite place to sit! sold.   ordered drinks that were totally on point. perfectly mixed. creative combinations of fun strong stuff. excellent. then the food. good lord. Canadianized Korean cuisine in a dive bar kinda place? effing fantastic.  I glanced at the menu, noticed a few things we were going to order ( the squash poutine and the buffalo tofu, i think)  then asked advice from the bartender and others at the bar on what to get. for me, thats always a foolproof tactic. if the bartender is taking pride in their job and establishment, just ask them what you should eat. they served us up some deliciousness.   the atmosphere was fun, on the loud side, and lively. it was dark, and a bit tight.   I'd go back if i was ever in Toronto again."}
{"text":"Food: Spicy scallion & avocado slaw - this was a filling salad, worth trying out. Tempura chicken with devilled eggs - tasty and sharable portion size. The Loosey - did not try this but was told by my Big Mac loving friends that it tastes like a Big Mac. As it is a crowd favourite, I will try this next time I eat here. Kimchi & pork belly fried rice - okay. Tempura prawns - good (because I like seafood) but I did not see how this item fit in with the rest of the menu and the amount is not worth the price.  Atmosphere & service: Quite dark inside which most bars at night tend to be, service was good.  Around 9:30 pm on a Monday night was when I noticed less of a crowd.  Price: A little on the high side for me and depends on the dishes."}
{"text":"Would give this place zero stars if I had that option.   #1 - terrible service  #2 - dirty for a restaurant. Shoes were sticking to floor, I did not even bother using their washroom #3 - food was okay, nothing spectacular enough for me to rmbr...  #4- Chinese take out box concept was cute #5- better then going to random ghetto fast food restaurant around the area... At least their fried food is made with fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"This place is great for a quick drink when you're bar-hopping. It's cosy, located behind a tiny, unmarked doorway on the Ossington Strip. It's usually packed.   The drinks weren't that great the last time I went. I tried the Liberace (in a disappointingly tall, small glass and taste-wise could have used more of a spicy kick) and the Bulleit Smash (that looked like a pistachio latte and had enough Bourbon to taste it).   I had a great time another time during the December holidays last year...we drank a beer, pretty much ordered every food item on the menu and crammed three people into a two-seater table. Favs are the Loosey (nice and crispy) for a neat $5 and the deep fried orange something (cannot recall the name).  Staff is a bit brusque and tend to rush you out - whatever."}
{"text":"I've never seen an employee so rude and racist.  I ordered $25 worth of food and gave a $4 tip. On my way out i ordered some extra food for take out.  Not only did he attempt to embarrass both myself and my friends by saying \"Excuse me? Is this the all that you're giving? You ate $50 worth of food and you're only giving $4? Asians....(sigh)\"  The crazy part was that he himself was Asian. In such a multicultural city, I've never seen a bar so rude.  Don't go to this place if you care to be served properly. This literally ruined my day."}
{"text":"Best Korean Tapas in the city! Make sure you order the Bulogi cheesesteak, slaw, and squash poutine!! All so delicious! Great cocktails too! Love love this place."}
{"text":"Overall experience: 7/10 Food: 7/10 Atmosphere: 6/10 Service: 8/10  As my star rating is relative to other restaurants I've tried, and the above number scores are absolute, you may be confused at the disconnect between the two.  Odd Seoul gets 2 stars because it is yet another one of those Ossington restaurants that is fine, but there is nothing unique or wow-ing about it. It's \"trendy\" (aka dark), the service is fine (though after reading some of the horror stories on Yelp about how it can be the opposite, maybe I got lucky?), and the food is regular.  My friend and I ordered the loosey, squash poutine, buffalo deep fried tofu and spicy pork neck. Loosey and pork neck were good, but you can find this kind of tasty food at Yonge/Sheppard, where the real Koreans are. I didn't leave feeling like there was any innovation involved in the food.   Nothing against Asian Fusion restaurants, however I think it will take a lot more than serving dishes on ethnic-looking plates to impress.  THE BOTTOM LINE: it's fine, but lacks food innovation to make it stand out; opt for real Korean food if that's what you're craving."}
{"text":"Cool concept, but a very small space. I kept having to get up to let other tables in and out of their space. The service was attentive. The food was interesting and eclectic, good Korean fusion food. I wouldn't say it's as standout as other reviewers, but it's well done. Nothing particularly stood out."}
{"text":"I loved this place!  The food was awesome as was the service.  Our waitress was able to help my friend and I picked the non-meat dishes; we ordered pescatarian friendly dishes.    Here is the low down on the dishes we tried: a) Tofu buffalo bites - delicious with the right balance of spicy b) Torched Mackerel - they torched it in front of you when you order it, it was yummy sashimi  c) Spicy slaw - refreshing, light and delish d) Squash poutine - OMG my fav thing, gooey, salty, sweet and overall YUM  I highly recommend their cocktails; their bartender makes a mean set of drinks.  As a note, arrive early for a table. The place gets packed after 7pm.  I will definitely be back to try out their other dishes."}
{"text":"Overrated.   Mistake: coming to Odd Seoul on a Friday night. We put in our names and we were told that it would be a maximum 1-1.5 hour wait. We went back to check after 1.5 hours and we were told that the table hasn't left yet. Waited a bit more...prob waited a total of 2 hours before our party of 6 were seated.   I don't drink so maybe I have a skewed opinion of this place, but I wouldn't come back here for the food alone. It was good, but not amazing enough to wait again. For what it's worth, my friends who had drinks said the drinks were delicious.   Best eats: kimchi and pork fried rice, pork belly fried mandoo (very flavourful and authentically korean)  Worst eats: torched mackerel (not worth the price)"}
{"text":"Prawns and cheesesteak for sure! Kimchi fried rice was meh. The cocktails are great too!"}
{"text":"I love Odd Seoul and have been coming here for years. It's a real \"hole in the wall\" restaurant with no name on the door, but always has a line up no matter what day of the week I drop by.  My go-to plate was always the pork neck platter which is sadly no longer on the menu, but there are always plenty of delicious items on the menu. I love the OS wings and the brick chicken (sizzling platter with radish wraps). Both are excellent for sharing and extremely tasty.  The service can sometimes be a little grumpy and the wait can be long during peak times, but if you're craving Korean fusion you can't go wrong with Odd Seoul. It's expensive but worth it in my opinion."}
{"text":"My friend and I shared the squash Poutine (our fav!!), the chicken + devilled eggs, and avo salad (fresh and tasty!). Came out very satisfied with full bellies and a reasonable bill. Highly recommend sharing dishes and getting a variety of flavour and textures (crunchy chicken, soft squash, fresh salad..) and a few drinks from the full bar!"}
{"text":"When you go to Odd Seoul, you can see the different influences when you walk in, and it manages to mix in Korean, Japanese, and Canadian styles of food in an approachable way that makes you go back again and again.  You're seated at the bar until your party arrives, and you can share one of two large tables with others behind the bar, although there are also two seater tables.  There are no reservations.  Once seated, we got the pork neck platter ($25 for two), which was Korean-spicy and not Canadian-spicy; be warned before hand, but do wrap the pork in the pickled daikon radish slices and top off with some Korean chili paste.  We also go the Kimchi fried rice (what you would expect), tempura chicken with deviled eggs (a good surprise), and the loosey goosey, which is a big mac/whopper style sandwich on white bread.  There's also the squash poutine with kimchi, which was my favourite for the night, with the deep fried squash having that poutine colour, while tasting fresher and healthier than potatoes.  Who am I kidding, this is not healthy at all, but it's certainly tasty.  The menu doesn't try to be too fancy, and a lot of these are dishes that are served in countless other places, but it's the thought put into the menu that somehow makes it all work together.  Will definitely make my regular rotation."}
{"text":"The squash poutine was pretty dope, the Loosey wasn't bad but $14 Jap chae? It's like $3 in Ktown. Also didn't understand what's with the Chinese themed bowls and take out box.  If you're wondering what's the difference between their $15 Soju and $18 Soju infusion? It's the $3 grapefruit slices.... It's a cool place to try some hipster confused asian fusion but next time I crave Korean/asian I'll hit up a next place."}
{"text":"Incredible bar. Minimalist hipster vibe. Great music. Stunning, creative, tasty drinks. Short but sweet and intriguing food menu. Great place. Definitely worth checking out. I like the owner, he rocks. Don't know what the guy below is talkin'bout! The poutine is delicious."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here on a quiet Wednesday night. We sat at the bar and ordered a couple of items. O.S Wings, tempura prawns, the loosey and two beers. The bartender took our orders and served our food. We paid cash for our bill and gave the standard 15% tip. The bartender asked if that was all and when we said yes he did not look pleased. I am a person who will tip generously when deserved but for a quiet Wednesday night when we only placed our order once and were never checked on otherwise we felt offended. We will never return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"As before, didn't disappoint. Yummy food and one of my favourite izakayya typish joints! Service is a little aloof but polite still. And at these prices, ofcourse gonna repeat!"}
{"text":"Awesome place!! Came here around 9PM last night for some late night eats and drinks. It did not disappoint. Very reasonably priced and great shared dishes.  It gets busy so try to come early! We had to wait around 30 minutes for a group of 5 of us, but it was well worth the wait.   1.) Food: I highly recommend the Bulgolgi Cheesesteak and Loosey sandwiches. $5 a piece, we ended up getting three orders of each because they were so good!!! One of the best tasting bulgolgi I've had in a while and it's perfect with the cheese. They come in servings of two sandwiches. We were also pleasantly surprised by the squash poutine (delicious, try it you won't be disappointed) - the squash goes very well with the kimchi. I was underwhelmed by the O.S. wings and the Smoked Pork Belly Mandoo. I personally felt the O.S. wings were way too drenched in sauce for my liking (but two of my friends loved it). I had expected the mandoo to be like traditional dumplings but they ended up being deep fried ball-things, which tasted good but just not what I expected.  2.) Drinks: We got two soju infusions (which they make in house) which were awesome. At $18 per bottle there is more than enough to share approximately 3 rounds between the 5 of us (awesome price!). We tried the Cucumber (highly recommend!! it is so yummy and refreshing!) and the Grapefruit.   3.) Atmosphere: Great vibe, small place. Didn't see much of our server, which was okay. As I mentioned it's a really small place so come early if you don't want to be waiting a long time outside. We were there for around 2 hours and by 10PM there was a line.  4.) Cost We ordered around 12 dishes in total, had one beer each, and shared two soju infusion bottles. Total cost was around $40 per person. We eat a lottttt and were completely stuffed by the end of the meal and felt it was very fairly priced.  All in all, really dig this place and will come back again :)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here to try something new.   Its a small place-long and narrow, quite dark but always busy. Considering its size and popularity, there is a considerable wait time to be seated.   The food did not disappoint. We ordered the bulgogi cheesesteak, wings and a few other items. Everything was delish, the prices are good but servings are small. I suggest ordering a little of everything because the flavour fusion of the food is unique and memorable!"}
{"text":"Don't let the small and easily overlooked exterior of Odd Seoul fool you. The bar is typically pretty packed and the menu is very reasonably priced. We ordered 2 orders of the Bulgogi Cheesesteaks ($5 each) to share, glass noodles ($12) and the barbecued ribs plate ($25 for a huge board with a large helping of ribs and coleslaw that you would likely have to eat with your hands). They had a good selection of alcohol and even the typical Korean alcohol like soju and rice wine.   The only criticism I would have is the lack of personal space. The tables are pretty close and the 4 of us were seated at one of the long tables with another group of 4 which put me elbow to elbow with the stranger next to me."}
{"text":"exceed my expectations!  I was kind of worried about going here because of the different variations to the food, but everything I tried was amazing!   it was worth the hour+ wait since we had a group of six and needed a larger table.   we shared some of the food, and my favourite was the poutine! definitely will return again!   ps - the service was amazing, on point, very friendly staff!"}
{"text":"slab o' meat! slab o' meat! that's what I came here for, but, to start off:  - the BULGOGI CHEESESTEAK oozes with flavour and, split between two, is such a tease. appetite officially whet.  - the BULLET SMASH cocktail - tart, strong, frothy  - the LIBERACE cocktail - imagine a pomelo in alcohol form. yessir that's tasty  And for the big kahuna: an off-the-menu PORK NECK*. sections of pork neck/spine lathered in gochujang & garlic, sprinkled with scallions and sesame seeds. barbequed to a charred perfection and served on a slab of wood with a saucy thai-inspired salad on the side. Upon ordering, our server made sure to double check we knew what we were getting ourselves into, as this hefty serving would easily fill two people without any other sides. oh yea? i said BRING IT ON.  fast forward past the unsightly double handed gnawing and meat picking**, and we were two happy souls. shove aside KFC, thisss is finger lickin' good.  I'd have to see how this place is on a busy evening to assess how divey the atmosphere gets but, as far as food and drinks go, I certainly wouldn't mind coming back.  --  *straight up meat, not the rice bowl **wetnaps thoughtfully provided for some sort of civility"}
{"text":"I get the kimchi fried rice nearly every time I come. It's exactly what I want after a night out and I always have leftovers for tomorrow morning. The only reason I deducted a star was because I was once asked to leave by the waiter because we had stopped ordering drinks and there was a line. I understand the issue and we were about to leave anyway but it felt rude after we had a huge dinner and drinks."}
{"text":"This is the hipster heaven in Queen West.   My friend and I came here hoping to get some food after an evening of chilling at   his place near by.   We shared the ribs. They where not bad but not great, a lot of the connective tissue was still intact and they where difficult to break apart.   The selection of drinks was not bad. The service was reasonable.  I would not come here unless craving intense  hipster contact."}
{"text":"My buddy and I were touring the Ossington strip on Saturday night and happened upon this spot once again. The last time we were here we had found the staff to be super R.U.D.E when they asked us to leave bc they were over capacity (There is something to be said about having adequate security at the door OR being courteous when asking people to wait outside/leave). This venue does not know the difference....  However, you all know me, I am the Sage of Second chances, and when we noticed Odd Seoul was next to empty Saturday night (save a dozen diners) we figured we'd give them a shot! However, the treatment we got would not change my previous opinion of this place.   Sidling up to the bar we let the bartender know we were interested in having a quick cocktail before we popped back out again. To which we were told, we couldn't be at the bar, they had reso's coming in. I asked, where we could enjoy one of their craft cocktails, and the response was \"Take a table if you can find one...I don't care as long as it's not at the bar.\"   Oh Really?  So we order our drinks, both of us opting for the Bulleit Smash (lemon tea infused, shaken to a froth over ice with bulleit bourbon, topped with cracked pepper). We did our best to stay out of the way but this place is tiny and divey, so moving a step to the left or right put us in the way of someone/something else.  We got our drinks and we're fortunate enough to find a seat, after another sideways glance or two from the peachy-lass tending bar.   The cocktail was 'OK' at best, I'd give it points for creativity and uniqueness 3.5 star in my books. I'm no cocktail snob so I can appreciate something different (wasn't my cup of tea BUT it was well built and crafty). That being said, the service and attitude of the staff warrant this place a 1 star IMO, so we average 2 for the night.   It'll be awhile before I return here again, and when I do I plan on tasting their Korean Tapas as this will have to be the redeeming quality to bring up their rating - hopefully service improves so I can bring them out of the doghouse..."}
{"text":"Excellent food. We had the kimchi fried rice, \"The Loosey\" sandwich, the chicken wings (my fav) and the coleslaw salad.   Every dish was a great size especially for the price. Our meal with 2 beers was under $50 - very rare to be full for that much considering the quality of food.   Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I always love this place. Awesome servers and delish sharable items. Creative and tasty drinks. Great for late night after the bar, when you really should eat something."}
{"text":"I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about Oddseoul. Okay, maybe they do. Toronto Life said it best when they described the owners, the Han brothers, as having captured \"Ossington's Korean past and hipster present...\".  Anytime I eat something amazing, I have an emotional reaction which stays with me. I call it JOY.   Oddseoul was pure joy. Brace yourself because it's about to get real yummy.  My chef buddy and I caught up over some drinks, drank some more with his likeminded peeps, and then we all got hungry and headed to Ossington. Oddseoul is sexy. How so? It just is. It's a long, dark but inviting restaurant cranking out awesome music. There's a bar upfront and semi-cramped high-top seating, but that's just cause they want y'all to get real close. And they're serving food into the wee hours. A culinary delight compared to usual late night dirrrtyy eats like street meat, Burrito Boys, Choochootrain or Rol San. Only the truest Torontonians will grin at the last two. So we piled in and feasted:  Saba - my least favourite of the night. Still delicious but Hapa's saba still takes the win. Deep fried prawns. Yum! Crispy, tart, and sweet. The special. It's a hot dog. Course it's MORE than a hot dog. Geem/Keem (aka nori aka dried laver aka seaweed), green onions, hickory sticks and some sort of sauce. This thing was RIDICULOUSLY good. RIDICULOUS.  My favourite dish from Oddseoul is also the highlight of my trip to Toronto. Meet The Loosey. She's only $5. I would describe this as a Korean mother's take on a Big Mac:  Toasted sesame bread (perfectly toasted, nice crunch and good chew) Beef patty with those familiar amazing korean-bbq flavours Some sort of sauce, ketchup, pickles  A fried egg  I loved it. Ate it all in four bites and didn't want to share it. I want one now. Help me?  Now I realize I said \"some sort of sauce\" twice, but that's because I don't know what it was. If they come back and tell me it's just mayo, I may as well pack it in and go home. Whatever it was, it was delicious. They may have been the same, they may not have been. I was in no frame of mind to tell, and like I said, it was dark. I could barely see my friends. But their smiles showed through. That is what I call JOY."}
{"text":"We walked past the place trying to find it, there is no signage so you've got to follow the numbers on the doors and mailboxes. We finally spotted the place because their name is fortunately on their health inspection sign (they passed, no worries). We were seated quickly and told there's limited seating time of an hour and a half, understandable as the entire place looked to have space for only about 25 patrons, including the bar. The menu is simple - a one pager without about a dozen tapas, a few larger portion mains, and a selection of cocktails and \"communal\" drinks. We got great explanations of the food items from our server and ordered a few tapas and a main dish to share. I found the service to be polite and honest, perhaps there's been improvement following the many bad reviews stemming from their service in the past.  For tapas we ordered the squash poutine, OS wings, the Loosey, and tempura chicken with deviled egg. Everything was flavourful and apparent in their fusion aspects. If you're into the kind of fusion where the main ingredients are western but the flavours and cooking styles are eastern, this is the place to be. For those looking for unexpectedly new combinations that just work and you wish you'd known about all your life - probably not the spot.  The squash poutine was squash home fries topped with a bunch of sauces that reminded me of Chinese food - the sauce to go with your fatty pork on rice - and takoyaki. There was also a bed of cabbage - to remind you of kimchi? Overall it was okay, a little bit skimpy on portion for the price.   I definitely recommend the Loosey, which is a miniature beef sandwich with slaw - the meat was flavourful and juicy, and the toasted bread went perfectly with it. It also easily splits in two for sharing, which was convenient for ordering with friends.   As to the tempura chicken...tasted like fish batter on chicken. If you ever want a very chewy filet-o-fish, this is it. The deviled egg was great, and I enjoyed the humour of placing chicken and egg at the same time on one plate. It was generally disappointing.   For the main dish we got Brick Chicken - it was a fried chicken base with Korean barbecue sauce, kimchi, and slaw, served with radish bun sheets and white rice. The radish and the spicy chicken went together surprisingly well and I enjoyed the refreshing bitter-sweet-savoury combination a lot, which rounded nicely into a spicy kick at the end. Unfortunately a lot of the sauce is wasted as the slaw slowly soaks it up - if you're hungry you can mix the rice in to get the last of it, though the bottom is mostly spicy sauce from the kimchi. This plate was a highlight of the items we got for the creativity and execution.   We also got a communal rice wine drink which was cutely served in a pot with small drinking bowls instead of cups. The bowls worked well to fit the slices of lime, though overall the rice wine was overshadowed by the lime and I felt like I was drinking an infinite vodka sour with the burn taken off.  For the price at the end I felt I didn't get my money's worth in portion size, nor the excitement of fusion Korean that I was hoping for. A cute place for sure, but I feel better quantity/quality for price can be found in other locations in the city."}
{"text":"The kitchen closes @ 1.45 A.M.The place has limited seating,good interior and music.I wonder why the coleslaw salad has great reviews on yelp.It was utter crap with a huge pile of monotonous salad with green onions and bad dressing.The fried food looked way delicious.We had a terrible customer service the bartender seemed angry as he threw stuffs around at the bar and seemed irritated to take our order.Later we were moved to a table from the bar to be introduced to our server,who blackmailed my friend to tip them more than what we gave them.I will not go there again."}
{"text":"Ok - the food is great (interesting fusion of Asian and North American flavours. The restaurant is eclectic - shabby sheik - cool lighting and rustic feel. The servers are awesome."}
{"text":"I would not recommend this place if you want good food. If you are looking for a place to just hang with your friends this might be a good drinking place but do not come for the food.  To be honest, I'm not quite sure what people are raving about but maybe it's people that haven't had much experience with good Korean/Jap or Asian fusion food. Most of the things on their menu are deep fried. Let's go item by item: - the pork belly was nothing as we had expected. Instead of real chunks of meat, we got a diced up meatball deep fried in a hard ball. The food itself isn't tasty either and just leaves a bad taste in your mouth.  - the avocado slaw had two pieces of avocado in it...lets just leave it at that.  - the fried rice was average at best. Honestly i can make much better fried rice.  - the squash pouting was a nice surprise. Good mixture of flavours.  - just as we thought things were on the upswing, the final dish came- Buffalo tofu. This was the worst thing I've ever put in my mouth, and I've been stung by a wasp on my tongue before. The crust was hard like a rock, and the tofu inside had a texture close to wet sand. My girlfriend couldn't even finish her piece. The girls next to our table didn't even bother with theirs either.   Bad choice!"}
{"text":"First let me start out by saying: Buffalo Fried Tofu. If you're not ordering this you're not living. In fact I had to order a second. Bold taste, perfect crunch and attractive presentation. It will have tofu-non believers, believing. Odd Seoul has tweaked their menu a bit and I was a bit sad to see the curry poutine gone but the squash poutine still had my taste buds singing with every bite. Do you want a show? Get the torched mackerel, a risky option for some, mackerel can be off putting. But, once the waiter (or tress) came to out table with a torch it had people turning in their seats-literally.  Next was them trying to grab the attention of the waiter to order one themselves. It's a MUST. Small portion so it's a great nibble. Everything is basically under $10 for the sharing plates so the more the merrier!"}
{"text":"Ok seriously. Every bite of food I put in my mouth ended up with a WOW in my head.  I'm usually skeptical of \"fusion\" places or restaurants trying to do twist on asian cuisine because it usually doesn't turn out well. But Odd Seoul didn't disappoint.   We got the buffalo tofu, scallion and avocado slaw, OS chicken wings and the spicy chicken bowl. Hang on, I'm saving the best for last, we actually started with the torched mackarel - torched for a while at our table and of course causing the fire alarm to go off :) But mm mmmm mmmm so meaty and delicious! Fish done well  I have to admit even though it was right in front of our face, we couldnt tell which one was the restaurant. I understand being hip n ' stuff but a small sign would help :)   One of my friends said he will definitely return to dine here; and I wouldnt mind as well!"}
{"text":"I finally came here last time I was in Toronto. I heard many great stories about this place and had to try it out for myself. A friend and I ordered one of everything on the sharing plate menu and 2 drinks each on the cocktail menu. Everything was delicious. The food came very fast and was fantastic. The drinks were on points and the staff were very friendly and helpful. Our bartender was able to recommend drinks for us based on what type of taste we like or didn't like and was very knowledgable on the subject.   I suggest making a reservation or calling ahead of time because it is generally very packed. You can try your luck by coming without one but keep in mind you might be waiting half an hour to an hour."}
{"text":"This place is a tiny whole in the wall bar. But very unique.   They have an interesting selection off their menu. All types of fun Korean eats!!!!  The portions are small but filling. The first time I went I had the prawns, very delicious. My friends had the loosey sand which which smelled great but too bad I don't eat beef!  All the dishes are very saucy.  We got the squash poutine, very yummy. We also got the chicken tempura which was ok. Drinks were good.    I find the servers to be inconsistent. One Girl was super nice but the rest are unfriendly and unwelcoming.  Half of the dining experience is the service !!   Another good thing about this place is that they are open late and located right in the heat of ossington!!!"}
{"text":"Oddseoul is basically like a korean tapas bar equivalent of grand electric. First off, you can't talk in this place because gangster rap blasting in your face will make it impossible to have a conversation.  The food was fine, I wasn't blown away. I tried the bulbogi sandwich and the ssam dish (the beef variety) and while everything was delicious I didn't think they blew me away.  I would go back to try a few more of their dishes if I happen to be around but nothing to line up and deal with all that noise for."}
{"text":"Been waiting for so long to go here and it finally happened.   First: we got lucky and on a Saturday night at 9 pm we didn't have to wait for a spot (we don't mind sitting at the bar, and it did look like other groups of two were seated within 15 minutes). Service was hipster: bare minimum but fast. (Example: never asked us how everything was. Took forever to bring our bill because too busy doing other things)  Bartender does not engage with those seated at the bar so if that's your jam, ain't happening here.   Now, the food was sooo good. Our top favourites were the tempura prawns (sans cilantro) and the squash poutine. We also got the bulgogi cheesesteak, the Loosey and pork belly mandoo (our least fave), all very good but we may order differently next time. We shared the cucumber soju, but I did have to ask for a bucket of ice to keep the bottle in to chill.   Overall, really fun and delicious and worth it!!"}
{"text":"2 of the best things I've ever eaten.   I went with a bunch of friends to check this out as it's a mix of Korean flavors and American flavors. We went for the bulgogi Philly cheesesteaks and it was incredible. The meat and cheese was an incredible mix with the sautéed onions and the bread was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. It's simple but incredible.   The second thing that was mind blowing are the mini sliders that came in square cut sesame bread. The toast is buttered (I believe) and it comes with the burger meat and some other sauces that I can't remember. It tasted like a Big Mac but obviously better. For a small slider it packs a punch.   We went through the rest of the menu and it wasn't bad but these two things mentioned are the best things I've eaten perhaps in a long time."}
{"text":"FINALLY had the chance to try this place. Super cute little Korean fusion dive bar on the Ossington strip.  It's usually quite packed and you may find yourself waiting for a spot but it's worth it.  Wandered in here the other night for post-dinner drinks and also Round 2 of dinner.  I only tried a couple items off the menu, which consists of snack sized and larger items - The Loosey, which is basically a decadent version of a big Mac, and the Tofu, which was quite honestly the best thing ever. It's deep fried, spicy, and the perfect pairing with a cold refreshing beer.  I would recommend both those items for sure!    They have a limited selection of beers and cocktails, but the place is meant to be more of a snack bar anyway.  Prices are reasonable as well!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favourite places in Toronto. Food and drinks are amazing and you don't walk away with too steep of a bill! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"While wandering the gangrenous streets of Ossington/Queen West in a poorly chosen skirt and giving up on trying to find Happy Baby/Baby Huey/Happy Child/Joyous Toddler (or whatever the fuck those places are called), you find yourself at Odd Seoul once again, and you're okay with that because it's a great place to go if you just got a little too 'turnt' on complimentary art opening wine and need to go hard into some miniature snacks laced with mouthwatering Korean fusion flavours like kimchi on your poutine, but this time you opt for the feature fried tofu squares with buffalo sauce (amazing, btw) and you're fooled by the 'slaw' that should be called 'green salad', and then due some overzealous vaping you order an 'odd seoul' when you meant 'odd fashioned', which is a nicely spiced spin on the original, just as your friend tells you you can challenge the bartender's obscure cocktail making skills and never be disappointed (unsubstantiated) and bonus: go to stall number two and consult the wall behind the toilet for the greatest bathroom poem of all time."}
{"text":"Very bad experience.  Server spilled sauce all over coat.  Waitress told us to clean the coat and the owner would pay the bill.  After many many revisits to the restaurant the owner has still not resolved.   In fact he became very rude.  We don't need owners like that.   Would have probably been happy with a sorry.  I would never recommend going to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Amazing place!!!!! Great vibe and the food is exceptional!  We had the avocado/coleslaw salad which was incredible and flavourful.  In addition, we had the loosey and the fried rice.  It was all so good and filling.  The service was friendly and attentive! Prices were great and so reasonable.  We will come back again and recommend to others!!!  Thank you!!!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic and unique offerings -- definitely not healthy but great for a night of indulgence. Go for the squash poutine. I've had most of their menu offerings and find them hit or miss."}
{"text":"It's a very cozy place with great food, tasty drinks, fun atmosphere and good music. I went there on a Wednesday night & it was packed and vibrant.  My friend and I ordered the squash poutine which was amazing, the torch mackerel and the tempura prawns which were very tasty and filling. For drinks I tried the cocktail with sake, it was delicious and fresh. I definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"All the food is so good but the cramped sesting stops me from going back. If you don't mind bar seats you'll be fine. Try everything."}
{"text":"great spot. a bit hard to find if you are not paying attention, otherwise it's pretty straight forward.  small selection of beers at decent prices, par for the course for ossington.  the space is small, and seating can be a bit tight, but it doesn't feel tight.   friendly server offering very quick and attentive service. empty plates are cleared almost right away. water glasses were constantly being topped up. always checking to see if you need another drink.  ordered the wings, bulgogi cheesesteak, squash poutine, tempura shrimp, steamed buns. the wings are delicious, tossed in corn starch before frying for a nice crispy skin tossed in an korean hot sauce with a bit of sweetness. the squash poutine was really unique, instead of gravy it's a japanese style curry. the bulgogi cheesesteak is pretty big and quite filling. everything was AWESOME!  all the food with 5 beers, that bill came to just around $75.   can't wait to go back to drink more and try other things on the menu  yeah. the music can be a little loud and a little dark, but it's not that bad for anyone in their 20s-30s. not somewhere i'd take my 60 yr old mother."}
{"text":"The prawns and steamed buns are SO good. I've been craving them ever since and will be coming back for them! The cocktails are also really tasty - the one I remember is the Spanish Harlem. The venue is small and quaint. The cooks in the kitchen are very nice and recommended the most popular dishes to us - thumbs up! The servers/bartenders are okay, not the nicest but not rude at all. Highly recommend this place for tapas and cocktails. Will be coming back :)"}
{"text":"Great late night spot.  Hip hop music and the best bulgogi I have had in a long time."}
{"text":"Hey, I hear you have a strict no standing inside policy.  I only was told of it when I was being kicked out because you shouted about your strict no standing inside policy.  If it was such a strict policy (of no standing inside), you probably should have told me before I waited 50 minutes for a table for 2.  It's okay, I will probably never come back, your policies (and shouting) are too much for me!"}
{"text":"This is probably my favourite restaurant in Toronto for the vibe and amazing food! First Korean fusion food I was introduced to and absolutely loved it. However it's not the most spacious place so you might end up having to wait but it will totally be worth it."}
{"text":"Stumbled into this place before going to see a show at the theatre next door. Wow, were we ever in for a treat! We shared 5 tapas dishes, which was lots of food for 2 people. Our taste buds were exploding! Every dish had the most amazing and powerful flavour. The salad was to die for, and so were the prawns and curry sweet potato poutine. The waitress was super helpful and nice, especially since it was our first time here and the menu takes a bit of explaining. Prices are very reasonable given the quality of food.   I'm so glad we found this place. Can't wait to be back!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place!  We were lucky and had no wait for 4 people.  I loved the Korean flavours with the modern twist to them!  The most memorable dish was the smoked pork belly mandoo.  The skin is the correct type, like the one my mom used to use for yaki mandoo when I was a kid, but with a much more full and succulent  flavour explosion as opposed to the traditional ground pork. Other top picks are the bulgogi cheesesteak, tempura prawns, spicy scallion & avacado slaw (which was not spicy thank god because i can't eat too spicy) and the squash poutine.  Every dish felt decadent and comforting, I really enjoyed everything!  I had the Liberace to drink which was perfect, as I don't like boozy tasting drinks.  It was sweet and balanced.  The food came out very quickly as well, and they do warn you from the beginning that there is a 2 hour max seating limit.  They also tell you at the beginning that they will split up the bill as many times as needed with as many credit cards, which is awesome because a lot of places say that they won't split it up more than once or twice, which is totally stupid.  I will definitely come back to try everything else on the menu!"}
{"text":"This is the kind of place where you take out of town friends and impress them with squash poutine and Makgeolli (rice wine).   One star off for the rude hostess for not letting us pee when we were still deciding rather to wait 2 hours for a table or go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Environment: Very eclectic environment, industrial themed.   Food: Such good food, we basically ordered every shareable.  Our favourite was definitely the pork neck platter.  I would say second were the wings.  All the food is Korean inspired and was very flavourful and well presented.  The mackeral was awesome cause they bring it out on a mini board and blow torch it in front of you.  Service: service was great, our server was very attentive and definitely helpful with our food suggestions, even though we basically ordered everything.  Conclusion, this little hidden place has great food, amazing music, and gets pretty packed later in the evenings. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I finally got in on a Wednesday (I'm writing this review fresh from the restaurant) after two failed attempts (not open on Sunday and long wait on Saturday without no reservation option). It was on my list of restaurants to try based on a NOW review. We tried five things: bulgogi, tempura shrimp, scallion/avocado salad, kimchi rice thing, the 'loosey'. 1) we liked although a bit on the salty/heavy side. 2) I enjoyed because of the crunch, but my bf wasn't impressed. 3) over-dressed in sesame oil dressing; nothing exciting. 4) gross. two chunks of chicken. Tasted like bad chinese fried rice. The egg was the best part. We felt ill after eating it. 5) mayo/ketchup sandwich with mystery meat.   Overall disappointment. I give it a c+ but only because the service was top notch. A little over kill with the getoblasters."}
{"text":"Oddseoul is a fusion snack bar. The bar itself is dimly-lit and looks like a dive, but do not let that deter you from visiting Oddseoul. There's a hipster vibe with hipster prices to match.   The restaurant combines Korean flavours with certain western classics. The food was creative and inspired and prepared with finesse. For example, the Tempura Chicken with Devilled Eggs and Bulgogi Cheesesteak are clearly a play on the East meets West theme.  I also enjoyed the beef short rib Ssam platter which is served with lettuce wraps, housemade pickles, kimchi and bean curd chili sauce. The short ribs were flavourful.  I would coming with a few friends so you can sample a few dishes. The plates are designed for sharing. Its a fun place to have a few drinks and share a few innovative plates with friends.  I would highly recommend this gem on Ossington."}
{"text":"Cocktails are good... Buffalo Tofu is like wings flavour or great vegetarian option.  As for \"the loosey\" ... u thought u would taste kimchi .... NOPE ... because there's so much Ketchup you can't taste the flavour of the meat or anything else in the sandwich ... But I will say it makes a good Big Mac knock off ...  Not much Korean flavour this coming from someone who makes there own Kimchi and the Korean Mother in law say it's pretty good.  The steamed Bun definitely has the Korean flavour great spicy pork !"}
{"text":"You know when you go somewhere and the food is basically average, there are a few mishaps, something is undercooked or not as expected etc etc but the service is great so you forgive the imperfections and promise to return and give it a second chance?   Well Oddseoul is the opposite of that.   The food is outstanding - delicious Korean-inspired comfort food that's full of flavour, cooked well and quick to appear. And pretty good value. Portions are small and share size (kind of... i'll come back to that) but at $5-8 a plate we were happy. Service was up there with the worst I've experienced in the city. Here's some headlines: made to wait for last guest to arrive before seating the others even though the restaurant was empty; cleared half full beers away when we were clearly still drinking and then insisting one was empty so refusing to replace it; not mentioning when ordering that there is only one steam bun in the order (table of three, all sharing) and then refusing to provide a knife to split it; reaching over us to throw down plates and beers... All of these negotiations were handled by the various hipster staff members with distain and attitude. It was the American Apparel of table service. Ordinarily I'd never set foot in the place again, but the food is irritatingly good, so I'll give it another try and set my expectations low. And by the way, just in case any of the servers care enough to read reviews on how they are doing - we tipped low because your service was shitty and we took $6 off the low tip for the beer you cleared away and refused to replace."}
{"text":"Way over hyped. Food is too salty and service could be better. Cocktails are good, but I wouldn't come back for food."}
{"text":"You know you've stepped into a good bar when at the moment you walk in and you get that feeling, that mood that you're in a different place, different time and you feel that deep down in your gut. Well, Odd Seoul is one of those rare bars that I knew I'd love right away. Absent are the large screen TV's playing at every empty wall space, autographed photographs of pseudo-famous people, tacky wall ornaments, and anything that would take away from that rainy, downtown Seoul feel from an 80's movie. The music fit the mood and even though it set up in a small lot, you're not shoving people out of the way for space, and it's packed in here too.  The night I went with my cousins, we had a few beers and a few items off their food list (kimchi sliders and a few other things) and honestly, I found them all to be really good.  We got in right in time because a group of three were just leaving so we took their spots but a steady stream of couples came in and they were told the wait would be anywhere from 65-90 mins long for a table, and it was 10:30pm.  Service was good, not exactly the talkative types but that's what you'd expect from a place like this. There's only a few things that adorn this place and they seemed to have been carefully, thoughtfully chosen and placed understanding presentation and the brand was just as important as what they served. They were selling it all. Both the experience and the good eats.  If you're in town, stop on by here.  Parking: Limited paid street parking Price: $$ Wait: 5-90 mins to get seated"}
{"text":"Odd Seoul is very much like it's brother restaurant Swish. If you are unfamiliar with either, the concept is Korean fusion food done bar style/tapas for sharing. The emphasis on sharing is key, but Odd Seoul offers an equal number of dishes under both.  It's a bit hard to find at first. You know it's somewhere on Ossington between Queen and Dundas. But at the same time you're looking for signage and nothing ever comes up, so your reliance on google maps goes down the drain and you feel like you are geocaching for a lunchbox tucked under a bush behind a fence (if you don't know what geocaching is, it's a good thing). Then you notice an all black, narrow entrance. Is this the place?   Walking in it feels like any other bar on Ossington and Dundas. high bar-style tables and seats, a long bar near the front, small and narrow layout with wooden floors, dark and intimate. So it's comfortable to sit and chat over beers (like Keystone...) while nom-ing on snacks. This is where things get interesting.  I got the Squash Poutine, which subs. squash in for potatoes with kimchi, sauces, gravy and cheese on top. Also had the Cheese Steak, which was one super soft bun stuffed with Bulgolgi. The Pork Bun was like a Asian Sloppy Joe, while the wings were Korean style: Crispy and Saucy with a hint of spice. My favorites were the wings, poutine and Cheese Steak but everything was actually quite good and compliments beer even better.  Despite the mediocre service, I liked Odd Seoul for it's casual atmosphere, well-priced food and location. Although hard to find at first, it's somewhere I'd go back to try new things off the menu."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the KFC (Korean Fried Chicken) here.   Very busy place; good food and drink options.   Definitely make a reservation!"}
{"text":"This place is just phenomenal. Open late, great music, atmosphere, excellent food and cocktails.   It's always a treat (and a super fun night) when soju is involved and they had a good selection.   The poutine was probably one of the best thing I ate in Toronto! Wow! So many unique flavors working very well together. The staff gave us suggestions on other spots to check out and were all around friendly.   Will absolutely visit whenever I'm in Toronto again!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday night with a group of 6 and the place was packed around 11pm. Service was pretty casual but our server was doing a good job of taking care of our table. Some highlights were the squash poutine, loosey moosey, and tempura chicken with devilled egg. The mackerel was good too but the pieces were tiny.   Will definitely be back here as the food is dope and ambience is perfect for sharing food and drink among friends."}
{"text":"Hidden gem. Awesome fusion dishes and a good selection of drinks. Many must tries, but some of stand-outs for me are the bulgogi sandwich, the loosey, and the spicy scallion & avocado slaw. There's no sign on the door so do remember the street number when looking for it."}
{"text":"Eating at odd seoul was like an ode to the soul!   A small space, insignificant in its ambience, its appearance blends in seamlessly with the new rustic urban hipster dive bar trend which has taken over Toronto. Filled with hipster waiters and waitresses wearing hipster clothes, in appearance the place screams a paradox of conformity with non-conformist notions.   There is very little outwardly which would indicate that this is a secret little place of korean fusion bliss. Completely masked as an obscure toronto bar, no sign outside, no website and no one ever answers the phone - dont bother trying to make a reservation, only a hand full of tables at the back, the place is dominated by a bar at the front.   But the food is like an explosion of tastebud fireworks on your palette. The bulgogi cheesesteak, a masterful korean twist of an american classic, the perfect blend of east meets west, the pork belly fried dumplings were a magical combination of flavour and texture and the pork belly sizzler with raddish wraps is phenomenal in its representation of what bulgogi should be. A must try spot for true foodies!"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner on my birthday and left very satisfied. We were seated at the bar because of how busy it was.   We also enjoyed THE LOOSEY ($5), the TEMPURA PRAWNS ($7), the SMOKED PORK BELLY MANDOO ($8) and the daily special, SLOW BRAISED BBQ PORK NECK PLATTER - ($25). The loosey reminded me of a Big Mac and was very tasty. While the prawns and mandoo (dumplings) are quite small, I do think they're worth a try with how flavourful they are. Lastly, the pork neck platter, which I tried on my last visit, was pretty amazing. I really enjoys the Asian slaw it came with and probably would've been content with just the slaw.   For drinks, we tried the MAKGREOLI PUNCH ($35), SOJU INFUSION ($15) and the ODD FASHIONED ($11). Because we were at the bar, we watched the bartender make our drinks, which I thought really enhanced our experience. I don't know if all the bartenders do this, but the bartender that night had quite a heavy hand while pouring drinks (we obviously didn't mind this at all!). We left pretty merry and had a really fun night. I do think it's a combination of the atmosphere, food and service that makes this place so popular. I look forward to going back to this hidden gem!  @wheresmyhoneypot"}
{"text":"Brutal Service.  You can pretty much stop reading right here. The food is excellent. I have never had anything off the menu I didn't enjoy, the service behind the bar is inexcusably rude. I know it's hard to slap food down and crack open a beer with a grimace, but I should not have to ask the bartender thrice to be able to pay up so I can leave. Love the food, I hope they do take away because I won't be dining in again."}
{"text":"The foods and drinks was okay ...they don't have anything else than chopsticks and spoons (if you ask for)so be ready to use hands when you order pork collar(bone in) in the feature menu."}
{"text":"It's dark (in a good way), the music is great (maybe a little too loud?), and the beer, wine, and cocktail selection is unique, reasonably priced.   I wouldn't call it a \"dive\" in the true sense of the word because its nice on the inside, clean, cozy, and they serve good and interesting food at great prices. Very good late night, last-drink-of-the-night spot too. Come here instead of wasting your time at Levack Block.  Service is also very good. My friend spilled her beer and before we got a chance to flag someone down, our server was already there with a mop and a smile. Nice touch!"}
{"text":"The place is mainly a small bar with bar seating and small tables. It has a small Korean snack menu and full bar.  We were seated for beers but then forced to move to sit at the bar when we didn't order food. Funny enough, ppl were eating at the bar. Not a service oriented gesture.  Based on the poor service and small selection of menu options, I won't return or recommend."}
{"text":"The barstool I was sitting on broke and I fell really hard and hit my head and back - completely toppled over because there was something wrong with the stool. I didn't complain and was really polite about it, but at the end of the night there was no apology from the venue, and they didn't even offer to buy me a drink to numb the pain. Honestly, I never give bad reviews unless something wasn't right, and I don't attempt to fall off barstools to victimize myself either. If it wasn't for the blatant fact that management didn't care whatsoever, I probably would have rated this place better. Watch out when you sit down."}
{"text":"i liked the squash poutine. ..everything else I tried (prawns....mackerel ....pork dumplings....loosey. ) were good but mind blowing... every small portions (think tappas)...all kinda on the pricey side  cocktails were cool.  didnt like our bartender...he looked miserable and his service reflected that  good to to once...wouldnt return though"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the atmosphere as the music was awesome. Who doesn't love old school hip hop? We had to wait approx. 45 mins (which was fine). The guy told us we have to wait elsewhere due to the max. Capacity of the restaurant (also fine). But as we were eating dinner, we noticed 3 or 4 groups of people waiting inside the restaurant and all seats were taken! Seemed a bit strange to me.  We ordered the Bulgogi Cheesesteak, Spicy Scallion and Avocado Slaw and a shrimp dish (forgot the name) which were all quite delicious.  Ordered a few other dishes O.S. Wings, a rice dish and kimchi fried rice which all had a similar flavour.  Overall it was an okay experience. I don't think I'll be going back again though."}
{"text":"Came here right when it opened on a Friday night. No wait but as time passes it gets pretty crowded as the bar is pretty small.   Loved the small Korean fusion dishes.  The atmosphere is a bar so expect to order a few dishes per person. The best dishes I had were the steam bao and the squash Poutine. It's a must try. We also ordered the pork platter, pork Kim Chi fried rice and the mandoo. I personally didn't really enjoy the pork platter as I found it to taste like ribs but less meat and more bones. There was no special twist to the rice and mango so i didn't think it was that mind blowing . But from the steam bao and Poutine i would def come back and try other stuff on the menu.   However, it is a bar atmosphere so there is loud background music but not to over powering to carry a conversation. The only thing I didn't like was that it was really dark. And the table was only lite up with one table candle. So it was really dark and couldn't really see what your eating. The architecture of the place is really retro, Hipsterish but you can see its clean. The staff is very friendly and can recommend the famous dishes on the menu."}
{"text":"Great bar for before or after dinner, although don't get me wrong, you could easily make a meal of all their snacks which rival the always great 416.   Fabulous cocktails - best is definitely the Bulleit smash.   Best bites:  - The Loosey: mini Mac, greasy gooey deliciousness - Squash Poutine: doesn't sound that great but trust me it's good! - Pork Buns   Small space - fills up quickly but definitely go for a drink and stay for the food."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic but the service is disappointing. Every time I've been it feels like I'm inconveniencing the service staff. I don't need a song and dance, or introducing yourself with crayon on brown craft paper. But a simple, \"hi how are you\" or \"thanks\" or \"cheers\" when we pay the bill would be appreciated. Just some kind of acknowledgement that we are two humans sitting at your bar. Maybe the staff think cold service is cool?  Food is great though."}
{"text":"Love this place.  One of my favourite restaurants in the city and certainly my favourite out in Ossington area.  The Loosey is so good!  Every dish is creative.  I've had pretty much everything on the menu and it's all good.    Staff are friendly, and service is prompt.    Don't get a seat at the bar near the door - the music is too loud - they need to work on a better system for music in this place.  Also, not a big place so groups of more than 4 might be difficult to get a table.  I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I live in the area and find only a hadnful of restarants in the area have both great food and resonable priced.  The service was excellent as well! I very much enjoyed torched marakel, buffalo tofu and a fresh slaw.  The place was packed on a Saturday and had a quick turn over at the bar.  Cocktails were excellent ($14) so switched to Soju afterwards. Great for dinner but also perfect for a quick snack and drink before heading out for the evening. I'll be back often."}
{"text":"Delicious Korean food and craft cocktails wrapped up in a dive bar."}
{"text":"For an incredibly casual place that seats maybe 20, I felt the servers were a bit pretentious. But the food is good and the prices are better, so I can see myself coming here again if I'm in the area. The food is korean-western hybrid.   Its nondescript, so make sure you know the address. I got there right when it opened, so easily got a table. but by the time we left, it was quite busy. The music was hip hop and loud. Lights are dim. Graffiti everywhere. Cool and casual. There are about 3 tables for 2, and 2 tables for 8. We were a party of 4 and sat at the same table with another party of 4, which was a bit cramped.   Food looks like it is meant to be shared. Everything on the menu was 5-12$, and 5 plates were enough for the 4 of us. We tried: - jap chae (vegan special - glass noodles with stuff) YUMMY - pork belly fried rice (comes with a fried egg)...greasy, but yummy - deep fried tofu was meh, okay - avocado slaw....good but i didn't taste much avocado? - squash poutine.... good  I will come back to try a few other things on their menu. They're right across Bang Bang ice cream, so maybe I can hit two birds with one stone...."}
{"text":"A really nice spot to stop for snacks & drinks; if you don't mind hipsters, or trying to find intentionally obscure locations via GPS on your smartphone. (There was no sign or any other marking outside.)  The cocktails were imaginatively described but more hype than flavor. The service was great. Prices were good.   Favorites: squash poutine and spicy scallion avocado slaw.   The squash poutine uses a Japanese curry for the gravy, so for us, it gave it a homey familiar taste. The cheese curds melted beautifully and the kimchi added the perfect acidic balance. A well balanced dish is taste, texture, and appearance. 5 stars. The slaw had a heavy sesame oil taste that we loved. The base was a dark green spring mix, avocados were abundant, and the green onions shredded fresh. 5 stars.   Sadly underwhelmed by the Loosey. We wanted a smidge more kimchi on it, but can you ever really get enough kimchi? I wish we had tried the cheese steak instead."}
{"text":"Food is great. Must trys are: the loosey, the bulgogi cheese steak, and the brick chicken.  HOWEVER, in the few times I've been there service is hit or miss. It can really improve. I'm not saying to roll out the red carpet for everyone but at least be more approachable to your patrons? That would be nice."}
{"text":"The staff needs an attitude check and their seating policy could use an element of discretion rather than black and white enforcement.  While I had been to Oddseoul before and enjoyed it well enough, my last experience will prevent me from EVER going back. In fact, it was maddening enough that I opened this yelp account for the Seoul purpose of spiting them.  Upon walking into an EMPTY restaurant 5 minutes before our friend, the staff was not only COLD and UNFRIENDLY, they would not let my girlfriend and I sit down, as it is their policy to have the entirety of a group present before allowing you to sit.   To begin with, the fact that there were at this point 7 people at the bar and none at tables due to their policy made grabbing a seat a significantly more logical choice as their bar is SMALL, CRAMPED, and at the front of the restaurant, resulting in it being extremely DRAFTY.  I am of the opinion that, due to their underlying insecurities, the restaurant prefers to keep people at the bar so it looks like they're busy, even when they're not. It is reminiscent of that awkward kid you went to grade school with who did everything in his power to run with the cool kids, despite the fact no one actually liked him. The only difference: you felt bad for that kid, Odd Seoul you shouldn't.  So, given the absurdity of their policy, we opted to sit down at a table and wait for our friend to arrive. Let me be explicit here, we know that we were acting in opposition of their policy, however, the context of the situation led us to believe this would be the easiest resolution as, once our friend got there (5 minutes later), we could simply pull up a third seat and all would be well. Keep in mind the fact that every table at the restaurant was completely and utterly EMPTY... in no way were we detracting from the use of any such table from any other patron.  As we sat down, the waiter said \"are you actually just two?\" to which we responded \"for now, yes.\"  He proceeded to tell us that \"There's no point in trying to trick us\" and, upon me questioning the policy, given the situation, he replied \"well we've been in business for THREE years***, so WE KNOW BETTER THAN YOU\" in the rudest, smarmiest and most despicable tone you can imagine. He made no effort to be reasonable, nor did he have any time (which is ironic, given the fact there were no customers ordering anything yet) for my contention.   The utter disregard for the relationship with the customer was shocking.  He assured us that he would kick us out after an hour and a half, as that is their maximum allowable seat time.  We assured him that he wasn't going to get a cent from us, so we stood up, walked out and went to another restaurant, where our table spent just under $200.  If you're reading this review, you're like me. You care about not only food, but also experience, atmosphere, and being treated with respect. If Odd Seoul was too good for our $200 last night, I'm sure they're also too good for you.   Go somewhere else that might appreciate your business.  If you have any questions about this dining experience or would like clarification on anything I said above, please do not hesitate to message me as I am happy to respond completely and honestly.  *** Upon some research online, it appears as though Oddseoul opened in early-2013, which is less than TWO years ago, and surely not anywhere close to three. Further illustration of this guy's pomposity.  UPDATE (December 3, 2017): please see Curb Your Enthusiasm, Season  9 finale for an instance where this exact issue is encountered by Larry David. He really drives my point home nicely."}
{"text":"This is solely based on the experience of first 5min. Where upon entering the resto,  being forced to a bar + having been denied of seats at the dining area.  Can't speak for the foods Bc we didn't even get to try them... Service kinda blew for the first 5 min to make us wanna get the f**K outta there."}
{"text":"It can be extremely difficult to get a seat here, especially at primetime on a weekend, but do yourself a favor and be persistent. Try 8PM on a Wednesday, which is what I did last week, grab a seat at the bar, and dig in. Freaking good food, and great for sharing.  The bartenders are friendly and make good cocktails too, for not too much money. I highly recommend the Ssam. We had the pork belly and shrimp combo, but I would have tried the spicy pork neck or the steak. it's all good.  Everyone raves about the loosy which is a small burger made of a mix of short rib and beef. Looked amazing. Have to try that next!  The music is fun 80s hip hop. Like.  It's a casual vibe and a young crowd. The food is delicious and not expensive. Lots under $10 and most under $20"}
{"text":"After two year's of having opened its Toronto doors on Ossington street, OddSeoul continues to deliver on their promise of a great late-night snack bar, with good drinks, food and a terrific ambiance. The place, which is open until 2am on weekends and some weekdays, features mood lighting, bar-height communal tables and relics of the 90?s meld with Korean influences and even terminator movie posters!  Though their drinks are the highlight for most late-nighters, OddSeoul's food is meant for the food aficionado. Their select menu features whimsical combinations of Korean ingredients with good ol' favourite American staples. Like The Loosey, which proves to be a very juicy shredded short-rib patty stuffed with kimchee and American processed cheese on challah bread garnished with pickles, mayo and ketchup. In other words, a cleverly deconstructed Big Mac.  Add to that Loosey another juicy ensemble like the Bulgogi Cheesestake, and you've got the perfect Koren-American fusion dish. Owner's Leeto and Leemo Han pay tribute to their American upbringing in Philadelphia with this sweet, savory and oeey-gooey sandwich. Ribeye steak is dry aged for at least 12 hours, shaved and then marinated bulgogi-style in a sweet-savoury marinade. All is sandwiched on a toasted banh-mi bun and sauced with a house-special mustard, mayo and hot sauce.  If the meat is too much and leafy greens are the only thing that resembles healthy-eating, you can always count on the Spicy Scallion and Avocado Slaw to hit the spot. Chunks of avocado sit on top of piles of greens with traces of chilli lingering on the drizzled sesame-based dressed slaw. A salad that easily washes off with any of the cocktails offered.  On the other hand, if size matters (as it should), a Saam Platter can also hit the spot and fill the need for all things carbs and yummy. Offered with varied protein, I defaulted to the beef short rib platter. Think Bibimbap korean-style. Delicious layers of juicy and fatty thin-sliced beef sit on top of fried rice, garnished with cilantro, Thai basil, cucumbers, sweet pickled carrot and daikon, circling around a sunny-side up egg. A sinful meal that, once again, easily washes off with a nice cocktail.  Buen Provecho, Viviana."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Or should I say, no service? My friend and I arrived on a Saturday evening, and we sat at the end of bar. The place wasn't very busy, there were several vacant spots. However, the bartender completely refused to even acknowledge our presence. He avoided serving us by keeping busy with his side duties like washing cups or having extended conversations with other guests. We sat the bar patiently for over 15 minutes without any sort sign that we would be attended to. He would acknowledge and greet other walk-ins while completely ignoring us. It was one of the most horrific experiences I've ever had in a restaurant or bar. I don't know what his deal is. Maybe he has selective blindness in his periphery vision? Or maybe he's one of those racists who refuses to serve Asians because he just assumes we don't tip? A bit ironic considering the place being Korean. In any case, I would certainly never go back there to experience this kind of humiliation again. Which is too bad, because I'm a very generous tipper."}
{"text":"Food was really good and service friendly.  A bit dark in there so it was hard to see. Loved the chicken wings and the deep-fried chicken things - soo good. Gonna go back for that."}
{"text":"Dined in on a Wednesday night, decor matched the trend of the area. Sat at a cozy table for two started off with a cold brew on tap which was refreshing after a days work. We order the chicken wings, kimchi fried rice and steam bun. The wings came out minutes after we ordered so I knew it wasn't freshly made since it was lukewarm, although the presenation was nice haha. Kimchi fried rice and bun wasn't out of the norm to a pallet that frequently tastes tradtional korean food. Overall the beers, service and good company kept me satisfied."}
{"text":"my go to if i'm craving something different, my favourite dishes are the loosey goosey, bugolgi sandwich, shrimps and squash poutine! that alone will feed 2 comfortably. but my absolute favorite item on the menu is the snow white, i really just go and down, at least 1-3 snow whites! always satisfied - not to mention bang bang is right across the street."}
{"text":"Maybe it's just me, but I am having a hard time wrapping my head around the concept of Korean fusion food, made and served by hipster non-Asians, to be consumed by an actual Asian (ie. me, though I heard this place is founded by a couple of Koreans). But that's what this world has become.  I am also having a hard time finding this place. You know it's in the hipster part of Ossington Avenue. But you are at a loss now that all the information you have of this place is next to useless because you can't find a store sign anywhere that screams \"Oddseoul.\" (Hint: keep a close eye for the one sign every restaurant in Toronto must have.)  So let's assume you found the place, great! Clearly they're trying to go for an absolute divey hole-in-the-wall experience here. Time to bust out the hipster eatery checklist: - Inconspicuous entrance and positively no signage identifying the business: check - Minimally lit ambiance: check (it gets bright enough to see adequately during daylight hours though with all those large windows) - Old-school hip-hop, soul and house as background noise: check. And ooh, ghetto blasters and stacks of vinyl records as decor: check.  - Irreverent rustic and vintage/salvage decor; exposed original building brick at every centimetre possible: check (though the bar taps made from an old ammo can is awesome) - And EXTRA BONUS points for not having a phone number. This is the first eatery I have been to ever, where they don't have a business telephone. It'll actually say on your bill, \"Phone No: NO PHONE.\" They're too cool for landlines, yo. Or even a website.  Holy geez. Unless there's some other place nearby I have never heard off, quite frankly this is the most hipsta restro/bar I have ever been to in Toronto-land. Maybe that's enough of a turn-off for some, but try to not let that detract from the food experience they present here. Sure it caters to strictly a young crowd, but despite the too-cool-for-you vibe, I never felt any stuck-up douchebaggery throughout my meal--the service was generally patient, pleasant and highly attentive, but also not warming, which I can live with.  I have heard that Oddseoul gets crowded tight deep in the night, but in the early evening right when it opens, it's all clear and more quiet and tame. Tapas-scale food served tapas-style to share. Then again, about a good third of what we ordered went into only one stomach: mine. Heck, most of the grub is served on plastic Chinese restaurant-style plates and bowls much like what I have at home.  Their wings ($7) were sweet, sour, spicy and crazy all at once. Damn! Literally finger-lickin' good, because that's what you will be doing as you knock your socks and glasses off from its ass-kicking succulent flavours. The $8 kimchi fried rice was a great mix of spicy and umani. And the tempura chicken ($14) were alright, a decent mix of meat with an overdose of fat from the deviled eggs and mayo.  If there was such a thing as a Canadian purity law for poutine, Oddseoul would violate it with their squash poutine ($7). Sorry purists. A fun fusion interpretation of the poutine nonetheless: squash in place of potatoes, some form of cheese somewhere, and a Japanese curry style gravy... it is impressive, this interesting mix of kimchi, gravy, squash and whatnot that melts your brains out. Who'd knew? And the $6 mackerel should come delivered to you in a fixie bike. Instead it arrives fresh, and your server torches it right before your eyes. Makes for a good table show, but it was light and somewhat underwhelming in taste.  Overall food-wise, Oddseoul is an interesting show of Korean spiciness mixing with equal doses of Western spice, fat and balance. I'd make it a once-in-a-lifetime foodie experience, where with a stomach half-empty, one could do easily a satisfying $25/person meal.   {TTC: the Ossington prison bus to Argyle St. You can figure out the rest.}"}
{"text":"I was a bit disappointed in the food here. The flavours felt generic and there wasn't any dish that really impressed me. Overall, a cool vibe and a good spot to grab drinks and a snack. Don't bank on an amazing culinary experience though."}
{"text":"How do I begin describing my odd love for this place?  Hipster-ish vibe without the pretentiousness, loud but laid back at the same time,  Odd Seoul (or oddseoul - however you wanna call or spell it) is a small great bar with amazing food! Food is served tapas style so that you have a chance to try everything (and you should!) The bar is in an unmarked building saved for the Barber pole outside. It is dim and narrow and packed! Old Hip-Hop blasting through the room definitely sets the mood.   Everything about the decor of this place is odd. From the barber pole to the neon pink prescription sign, old stereos to the two barber seats leading to the washroom. Odd but it fits somehow.  As for food - amaze-balls!! We ordered the OS Chicken, squash poutine, sweet bun, yakitori, bulgogi cheese steak (we ordered twice!), torched mackerel and chicken with deviled eggs. Price range from $5-$14. I like the cocktails as well.   Overall, this is a great place and a great addition to the growing food scene on Ossington strip and will tell everyone to check it out at least once."}
{"text":"I was really excited to check out Odd Seoul after hearing about how good it was. I came here with a friend on a weeknight. It was during dinner hours and we were told there would be a 45minute wait. The restaurant is extremely small and there isn't any space for you to wait inside. Expect to step outside and wait for your table. This is not ideal in the cold weather so we went somewhere nearby to grab a drink while we wait for a table. Odd Seoul called us about 40mins later and told us to make our way back. We went back to the restaurant but our table wasn't ready yet. There was another 10minute wait.   Food: some items really stood out. We really liked the \"the loosey\". It was flavorful. The squash poutine was surprisingly really good. I didn't think I would like squash with cheese and gravy. But it was in fact a good combination! The bbq tofu was disappointing though. I just didn't like the combination and there wasn't anything special about it. The spicy pork neck sizzling plate was just an okay. Overall, I had some items that I really liked but I can't say I was too impressed with everything.   Service: the service was great. It is a tiny restaurant so I expected prompt service. Our water was refilled in a timely manner.   In conclusion, I like odd Seoul. But would I wait 45minutes again to eat here? Probably not."}
{"text":"Had the worst experience last Friday... 7 of my friends went in to the bar at 12:30am to grab a few drinks. First off, super rude male bartender - our friend asked for food recommendations but he said \"look at the menu.\" Also, when we asked for some shots he refused to serve us because one of our friends were falling asleep on the bar. Even though he wasn't causing trouble, we overheard him telling the female hostess that \"he refuses to serve our kind.\" (We're all korean). After overhearing this, the male bartender walked away and the female bartender was at the bar. My friend asked her if everything was okay, but she was super cold and dry and said everything was fine. We brushed it off, but since we were refused drinks and got terrible attitude and service we then asked for the bill. To top it off, when we asked for the bill the bartender refused to separate the bill and simply told us to \"just pay and leave already.\" Honestly... Friend of a friends restaurant but this was ridiculous. Never going again."}
{"text":"4/5 - love this place, worth trying!  Odd Seoul is a modern Korean fusion bar resto tucked away on Ossington Avenue with a unassuming front door. Its relatively small and narrow, with people seated at the bar and only a few tables in the back, so I would expect a wait on weekends. This place has a great vibe with hip hop music playing in the background and an overall trendy aesthetic.  They have a good selection of both tapas and cocktails. I was actually pleasantly surprised by the food prices. While $25 for a sizzling plate might seem like a lot, the portion was quite large and would highly recommend ordering this to share with someone. The dish is topped decadently with a vegetable slaw and a side of Gochujang, really delicious!  The rest of the menu consists of tapas, including a bulgogi philly cheesesteak (was fairly filling), a burger (\"The Loosey\"), Torched Mackerel and some salad. The cocktails were also delicious, ~$13-15.   Highly recommend trying if you enjoy asian fusion!"}
{"text":"My husband and I loved this place and can't wait to bring our friends.  It's a cosy and fairly dark place and you will likely face a long lineup but Ossington is a great place for a stroll while you wait. Pricing is also very reasonable.  We got the Avacado Slaw (amazing- will order again), the squash poutine (definitely recommend), the Kim Chi pork belly (won't blow you away but good value and tasty), and the loosy (greasy but worth it!).  Overall we really enjoyed our experience and are looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"Very busy usually, but for good reason.  Great variety of share-able delicious Korean-inspired food.  Our faves are the O.S. wings and the Torched Mackarel.  The Loosey and Bulgogi Cheesesteak sandwiches are also good.  The rice bowls are very good, however not worth $20+ in my opinion.  Has a dimly-lit, hipster atmosphere that we loved ... however my parents would probably not!"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good ! The prawns are amazing! The bugogi sandwich was awesome but I think they could've done better on the bread. Wonderbread is so elementary school"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite restaurants in Toronto with absolutely delectable dishes. Great for a small group of people sharing a number of plates. It is small inside, so I wouldn't bring a group larger than five or so."}
{"text":"I friggin' love this place. It's amazing. Awesome food, gorgeous cocktails, reasonably cheap, and crazy good hip hop. It's all spicy sweet, perfectly prepared, and FUN. I have dreams about the chicken wings, they are divine. Oddseoul makes me happy to be alive. Well worth the wait, highly recommended."}
{"text":"3.5 stars!  My absolute favourite things at this place was the Tempura Chicken with Devilled Eggs ($14) and the Spicy Scallion & Avocado Slaw ($5). The tempura chicken was so crispy and tender and the devilled egg was whipped to perfection. It was nicely paired with a bed of lettuce on the bottom and a creamy caesar like sauce. You did not need the sauce because the chicken had a sweet sauce on it already, which tasted amazing. The slaw was sweet and savoury. It definitely had a slight kick once you ate a lot of it, but it wasn't really spicy at all (I am a weak sauce when it comes to spices).   We ordered the Loosey ($5), which was a petite grilled sandwich with beef, pickles, lettuce, and a creamy sauce. I think there were other ingredients, but I can't remember. I felt the sauce overpowered the other ingredients and it tasted like a Big Mac to me!   Another thing we had was the Smoked Pork Belly Mandoo ($8) aka fried pork dumplings. I could have gone without this one. Nothing special at all. We also ordered the Kimchi & pork belly fried rice ($10). This was my least favourite dish. There wasn't much pork belly, mostly rice and it wasn't as flavourful to me.  However, if you want to be full, the portion of this dish is really big so it will definitely fill you up.   One thing I got to say is that they had good attention to detail when plating food - e.g. they put little peppers on the devilled eggs etc.   For drinks, we ordered an odd fashioned ($11) and a keystone ($5). If you like a strong alcoholic drink that tastes like bourbon, but without the bourbon then an odd fashioned is for you! Keystone was nice and light.  Overall, the price was great and I would definitely go back to try the squash poutine, buffalo fried tofu, tempura pawns, and soju infusion. The place was very small, but the ambience was very hipster. However, if you go on a friday, expect to wait up to 40 minutes for a table or spot at the bar. They had this games area downstairs with a jits table and a darts board. I'm not sure if you could hang out there, but it's definitely really cute. The washrooms are co-ed. The service was okay. The staff wasn't very chatty or overly friendly, but they got the job done."}
{"text":"My regular hangout spot. Everything on the snack menu is good and so is the booze.  Even if you think you're not that aventerous when it comes to food and or drink you'll be surprised! Just try it out!   Recommended Snacks:   The loosey  Bulgogi Cheessteak *** OS Wings*** Squash Poutine  Mackerel  ....But honestly everything is good  Recommended Drinks:  Odd Fashioned*** Spanish Harlem*** Cucumber Soju ***"}
{"text":"A-mazing!   Yes it is a bit small, and yes the music is a bit loud, but the food is so worth waiting a few minutes for a table.  The service was fast and thorough.   As for the food itself, it was absolutely delicious! Don't miss out on the squash poutine and the steak sandwich. It is well worth it to get a big place to share and order other small sides. There are also many drinks available to choose from, so don't be shy to order for your usual favorites (I went for Jameson).   The atmosphere is that of a bar, so don't expect quiet time. It is a great place to get a few friends together and finish the night at one of the bars on the Ossington strip."}
{"text":"Ok, first off this place was a hidden gem in that it was so hidden I walked past it twice before I found it. The decor was your contemporary modern vintage design with the beloved theatre sign as their menu top picks.   The food was good although a fair warning that it was quite spicy! I would definitely go for the spicy sizzling plate if you are with a group. The only thing kind of put us off was that their server felt like she was rushing us the time we were there.   While I love a good seared mackerel, their portion was surprisingly small and so if you are ordering it, make it for one!"}
{"text":"Korean-fusion deliciousness in an intimate, exposed-brick space with great music on the soundsystem? Yes please!  I'd heard many rave reviews about the Bulgogi Cheesesteak mini-sandwich ($5) and I wasn't disappointed. Thinly sliced beef paired gloriously with melted cheese on a bun. Yum Town.  Oddseoul's menu is a mix of small plates ($8 and under) and sharing platters. Here's what our table of seven tried:  Torched mackerel - if you like your fish on the pungent/flavourful side, this dish is sure to impress!  The Loosey - like a mini hamburger on white bread (challah?) with fixins. Mmm  Wings - \"amazing\" said Dan, who hogged them all to himself (Love ya Dan!)  Spicy scallion and avocado slaw - Awesome  flavours  Squash poutine - a revelation!  Pork Neck platter - was enjoyed by all (note: it comes with a salad that's similar to the scallion/avocado slaw)  Add to this a beautiful cocktail list and you've got yourself a winner!"}
{"text":"Waited for 30 minutes for a table.  Space for waiting was limited, went for a drink elsewhere first. The cheesesteak was greasy good. The steamed bun also did not disappoint. The real main star was the pork neck rice bowl, it was enjoyed to the last grain."}
{"text":"Atmosphere 6/10 Service 1/10 Food 8/10  Hole in the wall bar with amazing Korean fusion food. Ordered 6 dishes split between 3 people and left feeling very satisfied.   The service here is horrible, lazy and not welcoming at all. Sat by the bar and was waited on very little with drinks and over all service. Our Waitress was on her phone or talking to the bar staff, had to signal to get her attention and acknowledgement we were done with our meal.   Upon paying our bill, our waitress was not Happy with the Tip we provided and flat out asked for more. I was so shocked and appalled by this behaviour that I would never return to this establishment even just for the food."}
{"text":"Definitely an interesting spot...Probably a solid 3.5, 4 may be a bit generous.  The GOOD: ~~~The Bulleit Smash ($11) was excellent.  It had such a great flavor and texture.  The texture was almost reminiscent of a cocktail made with eggwhite...really cool. ~~~The Bulgogi Cheesesteak ($5) was also good.  Just the right level of spice, grease, and flavor.   ~~~The rest of the cocktail list looked quite well.  The AVERAGE: ~~~The blowtorched mackerel was alright...nothing special, nothing awful.  It had nice tableside presentation.  The flavor wasn't anything spectacular though. ~~~The SERVICE was attentive but rather cold.   ~~~The AMBIANCE: Standard industrial and dark interior.  Bit too loud for its own good.  The BAD: ~~~The pork belly and kimchi rice ($10).   I like spicy food, but this was a pretty spicy dish.  My poor friend couldn't begin to finish his portion of it.  I couldn't call it bland, but the dish was a monotonous spicy flavor.  The pork belly was also lacking that lovely caramelized flavor that it should have. ~~~The beer list is super underwhelming.  OVERALL, I really enjoyed some of the food and drink and was rather disappointed with some of it.  I think that's why the reviews are so schizophrenic.  I'll definitely give it another try, but I'm not in a huge rush to run right back."}
{"text":"i was over in Toronto with my friend and after doing yelp i decided to come to this place for dinner,  we order  Mojito  Kimchee + Pork Belly Fried Rice Pork neck platter also with their house salad  i can't tell you much beside me and my friend had a great time here..service is amazing and friendly ,"}
{"text":"Finally got to try Odd Seoul after hearing all the hype for months.  We waiting a very long time to get a seat (they guessed 45 minutes wait but it was closer to 90) but we passed the time at a bar nearby. Not the end of the world. As someone else mentioned, you CAN'T wait at the bar in the restaurant for a table to be ready. However, you can eat at the bar, if there is space.  The service was prompt and polite and the food itself was varied and interesting, though not as mind-blowing as some have said. Try the squash poutine, that was a big hit with our group."}
{"text":"MUST TRY: Pork neck platter  Frankly, I recommend almost nothing on the menu. It's good korean food mixed with western fast food. My personal preference is to just have korean food.  However, the pork neck platter is super tender and you could easily make a whole meal out of it.   Order the pork neck."}
{"text":"Ok...I really wanted to like this place but.. it did not really do anything for me.  We ate: Squash poutine (4/5): probably the best thing I ate there Bulgogi sandwich (2/5): really greasy and has mayo and ketchup on it =/ Shrimp & pork belly platter (2/5): meh Avocado salad (5/5): Fresh and yuuuummy  The drinks were phenomenal. I would go back just for drinks and a snack, as opposed to dinner.  I will give it another chance, just because my Yelpies love this place so much."}
{"text":"Great place to eat! Excellent Korean food in a very cool restaurant and location. It gets busy and crowded but worth it!!!"}
{"text":"My favourite restaurant in the city! Great price, great food, great music.  Favourite things to order include: - squash poutine - shrimp tempura - O.S wings - loosey   The avocado salad is pretty great too - it has a nice dressing. I've been here several times now and usually order the same thing. Last time though, we tried the buffalo tofu and it wasn't great so I'll be sticking to the usual!  Tried a couple of their specials a few times also, and they were all excellent. Delicious cocktails too!"}
{"text":"Our friends had eaten at Odd Seoul the night before but loved it so much they came along with us when we said that's where we were going. And then they took charge and ordered everything for us, and everything was great. The Loosey sandwich is, as they promised, like a Big Mac but way better. The Bulgogi hoagie was moan and swoony. The squash poutine with curry and kimchi gravy... I've been talking about ever since. The kimchi rice was spicy and crispy and tasty. There were other things but by this point I was close to food coma territory, but very very happy.   We waited about 45 minutes for a table, but they have a very civilized system where they just call your cell when a table is ready, so we were able to relax and enjoy our drinks nearby. The place is tiny and we shared our table with another group, but they were friendly and funny, as were our adorable waitresses, so all was well in the world."}
{"text":"I rarely think food at restaurants is 5 star worthy but odd seoul is a hidden gem. They don't really have a sign outside so it is a bit hard to spot. Went on a Friday night around 9 Pm and there was a 40 min wait. No problem because I was set on trying the food. Everything was worth the wait. Started with some soju for $13 enough for 2 people. We then tried the loosey, bulgogi cheesesteak, wings, mackerel and butternut squash poutine. Tapas size portions but everything was AMAZING!! You will not be disappointed. Service is decent and quick. Nothing spectacular but will do for the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Highly recommend the bulgogi cheesesteak, kimchi fried rice, and chicken wings. Their cocktails are amazing too! Just get anything and you'll likely be satisfied."}
{"text":"Good food , fast service .  Bulgogi could be their most popular option . Prawn and Poutine was also  tasty"}
{"text":"Odd Seoul: a new tapas-style Korean joint located on Ossington in between Queen & Dundas. In it's short time open it's already got quite the buzz about it! I think between the buzz and all the 5 star reviews of this place my expectations were set a bit high!  Service was good. Our server came by quite often to refill our water and make sure everything was okay.  FOOD! My party & I sampled:  Torched Mackerel $6 - super tiny piece of Mackerel. Not worth the $6. Best thing about this dish is that it's torched tableside. Other than that, nothing special.  Tempura Prawns $7 - Okay. A bit bland, and the mayo didn't really bring much to the dish. Good size for sharing.  \"The Loosey\" $5 - Hamburger type dish served on bread instead of a bun. Great size for the price! It was juicy but I  think still lacking some flavour. Overall a good dish and worth trying, though.  Bulgogi Cheesesteak $5 - Didn't get to try this one but it was a hit for everyone that did!  Squash Poutine $7 - WOW! The highlight of my meal here. INCREDIBLE and pretty unique! The squash with the elements of a normal poutine (gravy & cheese) was delicious. MUST TRY!  Spicy Chicken Saam Platter with Lettuce Wraps & Kimchi Rice $25 - If you're here with a group you should definitely invest in one of the Saam Platters as they are perfect for sharing and there is a fairly decent portion of food. The spicy chicken was good, but the star here was really the Kimchi rice - that ish is DELISH. I could come here and eat only Kimchi rice and be happy as a clam! Put the Kimchi rice in your lettuce wrap & you're in heaven.  No desserts available here, sadface.  They don't allow customers to have knives (weird?)  Nice cocktail selection!  Overall there was definitely more misses than hits, but it was a fun experience! If I come back I will be sure to feast on some Squash Poutine & Kimchi rice!"}
{"text":"I don't normally like share menus but this place is just completely unbelievable. I didn't order a single thing I didn't love and my friend and I must have eaten 4/5 of the menu. Special mention to the tempura chicken with deviled eggs but you literally can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Tasty Korean tapas style dishes Ina dim lot dive bar setting. The pork belly mansions were great but I found a lot of the other dishes a little greasy!  The Kim chi fried rice was nice but I was a little less positive on our short rib rice bowl."}
{"text":"Buffalo fried tofu is a vegetarian dream. One of our favourite local restaurants, as good as it gets. Good service."}
{"text":"I'm giving this restaurant a 3 star as i find that they use a lot of MSG. We came to grab a quite bite to eat before a show and enjoyed the bulgogi cheesesteak and chicken wings. The kimchi fried rice and squash poutine was okay. After the show, I was super thirsty and had to drink 2 glasses of water immediately and I knew it was the food from this restaurant that had a lot of MSG.  The flavours were good, small restaurant, but I wish they did not use MSG in their food."}
{"text":"Amazing food, cool staff and great atmosphere!    Came here with my best buds yesterday and we got (don't remember the exact names):  1. Buffalo fried tofu (5/5)- this was SO GOOD I can't even comprehend. I don't even like tofu but this was some next level good.   2. Squash poutine (4.3/5)- the flavours were really good, who knew squash could be so good??  3. Pork balls (4.5/5)- also on point. Came with 6, which was perfect for sharing   4. Avocado slaw (4/5)- I'm not huge on salad. That being said, it was really good! The sauce was perfect    We all got drinks and we loved them as well. I got the Snow White, my friends got a Moscow mule and their spicy drink on the menu (surprisingly really good and not what you expect at all!)   Can't wait to bring more people here!"}
{"text":"Great food, friendly people working there, and add in a very good makeover on the joint itself with a pizza shop menu board and funky jazzy beats that make this place a big winner on the Ossington strip."}
{"text":"This resto is really easy to miss if you just stroll down Ossington.  There was a small blackboard outside the restaurant and we missed it twice even when we were deliberately looking for it... I came here a while ago but a sudden craving for Korean fusion food led to this postdated review  While it looks a bit dingy from the outside, once you go in, the unique deco makes you feel like the most hipster Korean-American gangsta foodie ever.  (the bartender was pretty cool)  The menu changes from time to time, when my girlfriends & I went, we tried: - \"The Loosey\" - nothing like the classic Juicy Lucy, but still quite delish - you should try to find out!  - Tempura Chicken with Devilled Eggs - two nothing-special items combined together made one great dish.  I wish the devilled eggs I make tasted like that, still trying to figure out what seasoning they used - Bulgogi Cheesesteak - not bad, but just tasted like bulgogi with a lot of cheese. - A dumplings dish I really can't remember - it was nothing spectacular though and I didn't get the fusion element in that one. - Rice Bowls with Pork Neck (+ some fancy seasoning I can't recall..) - you need to order one of these if you want to feel full after the meal, we really enjoyed the rice bowl :) The server mashed the rice with the ingredients together for us!  I recommend going in groups so you can try different dishes and share these Korean bar foods.  Most items are around $7-$15, but the rice bowls were at $20/each with different choice of meats and seasoning.  Not sure if they are still offered on the current menu, but I fell in love with this restaurant when I went and would definitely go again."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of traditional Korean flavors, but this place has a western twist. The spicy chicken wings are incredibly addictive, and I've come back a number of times just to have them again! The torched mackerel was tasty also. It's a small place and frequently packed, so try and go early to reserve!"}
{"text":"Odd Seoul was a perfect choice for dinner on a Saturday night out with my friend. Nestled in a low key location on the trendy Ossington avenue, Toronto's favourite artistic corner chock full of bars and other hot spots easily accessible after dinner.   Luckily we got a table at this cozy 30 seater Korean fusion restaurant that does not take reservations. We ordered cocktails to start, I had the Bulleit Smash which was delicious and perfectly tart. Then we ordered a handful of the small plates to share - the Bulgogi Cheesesteak, Squash Poutine, Crispy Buffalo Tofu, The Loosey, Pork Belly Kimchi Fried Rice, spicy scallion and avocado slaw. Almost all were winners, highlights include the deliciously greasy flavourful cheesesteak and the perfectly dressed crunchy tofu. In my opinion the squash poutine was ALMOST perfect just needed a few more cheese curds (I think we counted 3) and a couple more crispy pieces of squash but apart from that it was flavour heaven. The Loosey was also a short step away from top...can't put my finger quite on its shortcoming, but maybe the toast seemed a little dry and the ingredients a little too segregated from one another as opposed to its sandwich inspiration - the epic Big Mac.   Waitstaff was friendly and well paced between share plates...sometimes these kinda dishes get thrown at you and you're in and out in 10 minutes. Or worse, sometimes you get 2 items super fast and end up waiting 30 minutes in between...not at Odd Seoul, they've got it down.  All in all we LOVED Odd Seoul, will definitely be back the next time I'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"I think the name of this restaurant describes the food pretty accurately; they serve Asian inspired fusion food, all the combinations are interesting but some were just odd. After walking past the store a couple of times due to the very minimal signage, I finally found the shop by checking the map again and finding the store that was located next to it. Inside is very dim and all the tables are quite small and cramped.   My friends and I were seated at a long high-top table along with another group of people. I didn't mind too much but getting up for the restroom would be difficult due to all the thick winter jackets blocking the already narrow spaces between chairs.  We ordered quite a few items off the menu. I start from what what I enjoyed the most, which were the tempura prawns. They were fried perfectly, and the mayo-based sauce was very tasty. The squash poutine had a bit too much going on. I really liked the fried squash but not so much everything that was on top of it. The spicy pork neck came out sizzling with a pile of cold pickles, cabbage, green onions on top. We had to dig for the meat pieces. This dish had very strong flavors, especially the pickled radish, and was very savoury. There wasn't enough rice to balance out the saltiness. The buffalo fried tofu on the other hand was a bit lacking in the buffalo sauce, and the fried rice was just a bit too bland compared to all the other dishes.  Overall, this is a good(and kinda pricey) place to grab a drink and maybe some food on the side, but not great if you are on the hunt for a grand meal."}
{"text":"Yay for Han brothers' late night eats bar since Swish by Han! First things first, the restaurant can be easily missed given there is no sign for the restaurant so make sure you just keep track of the address. The place is dark and hip with bar seating, 2 high top tables for larger groups and a few two person tables. As such, it can get quite packed and you will need to get on the waitlist.We came on a Saturday night and waiting around 25 minutes but the waitress gave us a call to let us know our table would be ready soon and the customers before were getting their bill.   For the food, we opted for the Loosey, smoked pork belly mandoo, steamed bun and the kimchi pork belly fried rice. My least favourite would have to be the fried rice. Although it had a lot of \"wok\" flavour, I felt that it was too overpowering and I could not taste any Kimchi and the pork belly was nowhere to be found. The smoked pork belly mandoo was not what I was expecting as  it was a fried dumpling served with a delicious mayo sauce, scallions and a red pepper garnish. I liked the combination of flavours with the crispy mandoo and the smoked pork belly essentially tasted like bacon. As for the Loosey, this is a must try and probably get your own order because it's that good! I loved that the sandwich was saucy along with the delicious patty infused with some Korean/American flavours. I look forward to coming back next time to try some other dishes and of course, re-visit the Loosey."}
{"text":"Consistently delicious, the go-to dishes being the Lucy, squash poutine, cheese steak sandwich. I usually walk out of there having spent $25 on myself and feeling satisfied.   Not 5 stars because: can be long wait, especially if more than 2 people. If it's a busy night the servers sometimes try and rush you out. Service is hit or miss."}
{"text":"Absolutely one of my most loved spots in the city. Incredible food, amazing atmosphere and proper service.  This place is and always will be a milestone for gastronomy.  They also have other restaurants in the city that are amazing.  Han Moto.  (https://www.yelp.ca/biz/hanmoto-toronto)  Pinky's Ca Phe.  (https://www.yelp.ca/biz/pinkys-ca-phe-toronto)"}
{"text":"The first restaurant I went to after landing in TO. I was not disappointed. Loved the take on Korean dishes. Favorite drink was 'makuri', and food was the cheesesteak. The poutine was really delicious as well. When I'm back in TO again, I'd come back here to eat."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times and seriously, it's always a good time. I usually come in a larger group around 10-15 people and yeah it's a little squishy and some of us ends up standing cause this place is pretty small. The customer service here is very good, the employees are friendly and very chill.   I've tried pretty much everything on this menu and they're all very very very yummy and flavourful. The best part is it's inexpensive!! But that's because we order a bunch of stuff and everyone shares it, so it's kind of like an izakaya and we all get to try different things. Their kimchi and pork belly fried rice comes in this cute little cardboard take out box and it's absolutely delicious. Nothing in this restaurant is bland. All the flavours are popppping, or maybe it's just super spicy and msg?? STILL GOOD THOUGH.   However, the wait is pretty bad here but it may be because we always come in a big group. After we're done eating, we always head over to bang bang for ice cream since it's right across. Definitely give this cozy place a try because it's a nice place to hang out and grab small bites/drinks - all good vibes."}
{"text":"Ignore any negative reviews. Is it loud? Yes. Are you elbow to elbow with your friends and follow diners? Yes. Is it hipster? Yes...maybe a bit. Do they not allow you to stand and drink due to space and fire code reasons? Yes. Is the food amazing? YES! I have been 3 times and loved it every time.  As the name suggests, it is Korean - Soul Food Fusion.     The Loosey is to die for. Think of a kicked up whopper! Phili Cheesestake is amazing. Don't judge...just order and eat it. Pork Neck Bowl and Kim Chi Fried rice are epic. Squash Poutine is unlike anything you'll try elsewhere. Curry used as the gravy!  Cheap. Fun. Loud. Unique Flavours.  I send folks from out of town all the time and they always thank me later."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! I have been here three times already! You would easily walk pass it though. There are no signs or anything! Its a great place to hang out with friends. I just love the atmosphere!  As for the food, its great. Its one of my favourite places in the city to get small dishes. We ordered a couple of dishes.  TORCHED MACKEREL: The torch was pretty fun for presentation. The Mackerel was alright, it wasn't my favourite dish of the night.  SQUASH POUTINE: So Good. The squash is crispy on the outside but o so soft in the inside. The curry on it is great and the green onions. Everything just works together in this dish  \"THE LOOSEY\": I love this! its the perfect amount. I swear, they perfected the Big Mac sauce.  The only downside is the wait time!"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh. Teresa found out I had never had Korean food and we came here after a few wonderful pints at Duggan's Brewery. When we walked inside I was like, this is a bar, the food won't be very good. It was long and narrow and dark and at the back there were two high top tables and maybe 4 low top tables (in the back and along one side wall).  We ordered the bulgogi cheesesteak and kimchi pork belly fried rice. HEAVEN IN MY MOUTH. This was revolutionary in my life because I am now obsessed. I want to eat that at least 3x a week.  So freakin' good. The buttery bun that the cheesesteak was on was heavenly. The fried rice was delicious and it had such nice flavours and spice and I loved the egg on it. Droooools.  Service was great. Water was always filled.   Came to about $20. They had bone shaker on tap but not too many other beers that I was a fan of. Food was dynamite though. 10/10 would come again."}
{"text":"I ve been going to Oddseoul for about a year or year and a half. I loved the food at this place and their cocktails are awesome. The last two times I have been there though, the bartenders have been awful... First time I figured he may be having a bad day, it happens. Went back today... I have never come across this anywhere else. He tried to explain to us that we couldn't sit at the bar to wait for the table. So we told him we d get some drinks as we waited. We asked if that was possible and in the most condescending way told us that it wasn't the issue. That he wanted the bar spots for other people. Got it. No problem. If you explained that, we would have gotten it and moved to the bar across the street as we waited for our table. But he felt he needed to be rude and condescending instead of explaining himself. Two times in a row that their bartenders do this? Not for me. I won't be going back there again. Lots of other bars with no douchey bartenders. I have never written a bad review before, sometimes I rather use reviews if a place is great, but I was so angry and dissapointed with their bartending staff, I had to."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to check Oddseoul out for months, and finally did with my hubby about two weeks ago. I guess hype can kill an experience, because after reading review after review of ardent OddSeoulites raving about the dishes and cocktails, I was ready to have an excitingly delicious night of food from my Motherland. First of all, I don't care if it is fusion, it is Korean food, and when you have a dish called \"spicy chicken\", you'd better back that up with some spice!!!! Korean level spice, people, come on! The chicken was mild at best, just really salty, and came with a very sad little portion of basmati rice. The other dishes we ordered were all fine (squash poutine, scallion salad, tofu, prawn tempura) but more salty than flavourful. My cocktails were yummy, but nothing outstanding. My husband enjoyed the meal more than I did, but I don't think I will return. The service was fine, but when we were first sat, and there was only one menu given, and we asked for another one for easier reading, you would have thought I asked our server if he could slowly read the menu to us while massaging our backs...he was very unimpressed. He reluctantly brought us another one, and I would like to know the logic behind that interaction!"}
{"text":"I am surprised at the people complaining about the service, because we found the service to be fine. Especially given how busy and cramped it was. There were no tables, but they got us seats at the bar. The music was maybe a little loud, but I enjoyed the 90s throwback that was happening. The place looks like a dive, it's a total hole in the wall, with no signs to speak of, but I liked the weird atmosphere of weird, old \"ghetto blasters\" on the walls and pics of Arnold in Terminator. It's random, just go with it... But the food....OH the FOOD! We were told that the squash poutine was a must have, so I ordered that and the bulgogi cheese steak, while my friend ordered the poutine and the mackerel. The mackerel was served first. It arrived raw, on a platter and a torch was taken to it to sear the outside and that was it. My friend allowed me a bite and it was so fresh tasting, with a delicious marinade. Next came by bulgogi sandwich. Fresh, delicious bread and amazing bulgogi. Was very pleased. Finally the \"poutines\" arrived. I should say that it was not what we were expecting. I assumed it would be squash on top of fries. But in fact the squash was the fries. THey were lightly fried and covered in a variety of sauce \"gravies\" and scallions and some other stuff that I could neither make out, nor even see clearly (dim lighting). It doesn't matter okay....this stuff was HEAVEN! Both my friend and I took a bite and looked at each other...and proclaimed our new favourite food.  Other people in our party got the wings, which looked amazing and they said they were and The Loosey, which was also proclaimed as delicious. So basically there were no wrong moves. The drink menu was very adventurous...more so than we were, because we didn't take the plunge, although it was fun sitting at the bar and watching the bartender creating them. And splitting the bill for my friend with two others (her birthday), my two \"tapas\" and a generic alcoholic beverage came to just under $30. The prices are extremely reasonable...and honestly once you try this stuff...I mean, I don't want to give them any ideas, but I would have paid more for that fine, fine food. I will be back. Need me some more of that poutine!"}
{"text":"Beautiful interior, nice atmosphere. Some of the best food I've ever eaten. Ever. Menu is well rounded and so is the cocktails. Only draw back was the service didn't match the top tier everything else was at. But hey! Everyone has a bad day :)"}
{"text":"Mediocre rating. Mainly because service was okay, they didn't check up on people. As far as food, poutine was excellent. The loosey was good as well. I'm a wings guy - the wing dish was not great. Fair price for what you get for sure. It wouldn't be my first option in that area - but I may go back."}
{"text":"Our friends took us here last night. They were raving on how good the food was we had high expectations....Odd Seoul delivered! I don't normally give 5 stars but this place did it. Great service, flavourful food, quick delivery, downtown cool vibe and somewhere you would bring your friends who would then think, whoa your cool for knowing about this spot. I am definitely going to go back to this place and try the rest of the menu. A must try!"}
{"text":"The conversation amongst friends went thus ----  \"I feel Asian tonight\" \"I feel like Guu tonight\" \"I don't want to blow my money on dinner, rather on drinks\" \"I don't want to eat alot\" \"I want to go to china town and have seor ak san\"  The obvious answer was Oddseoul. Kinda like the ugly duckling next to swish by han, Oddseoul is wayyyy dingier and slightly lower priced. And also slightly lower quality too while we're at it. But some key dishes that always stand out - the chicken wings and the bulgogi cheesesteak.  I don't care much for their drinks personally. I'd like to pay the prices i'm paying on a little more liquid that also has more quality. Serving it in a stupid little glass does not justify.    And yes, this place could do a lot better on the service. They need to figure out if they DO actually take reservations, or not. this friends and family bullshit is just not cool."}
{"text":"Always a great experience. Can't go wrong with any of the food though recommend the loosey, cheesesteak and mackerel to start. Great vibe and good food. Can't really go wrong."}
{"text":"i crave odd seoul! the wings are to die for. texas loves odd seoul! ;)"}
{"text":"One of my favorite 'off-the-beaten path' kinda places in Toronto. Super unique dishes that not-only balance North American favorites with Korean classics, but also serve the after hours rush. The squash poutine is the most interesting rendition of poutine I've ever had, and I mean that in the best way possible. The Bulgogi cheesesteak sandwich is utter genius, and the porkbelly is out of this world. The kimchi fried rice is some of the best I've had to-date. All these positives, and it's open all hours of the night? Definitely goes down as 'one a'dem ones'"}
{"text":"I'm in love!   Must-order items to devour:  1. The \"Loosey\" (unreal) 2. The poutine (omg!)  3. Buffalo Tofu (this was actually insane and I don't even like tofu) 4. Bulgogi Cheesesteak   Must-order drinks: 1. The Chinatown Cocktail (I don't recall its full name) 2. Cucumber Soju  I personally didn't love the kimchi fried rice we ordered. That's not too say that it wasn't tasty cause it was, but the taste was not as explosive as the other dishes we tried .   Wait was about 1.5h for a party of 7. We ordered family-style and bill came up to 36 dollars per person which included four rounds of soju for the table and two cocktails.   Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"3.5 Stars  (points knocked off for making me wait an hour elsewhere, as described below).   VIBE  This was actually my second time to Oddseoul. It's really important to know when to go here. Closed Sundays. Packed to the gills on Friday. Unfortunately, I had a similar situation to Kris (see below) on Friday. All tables and bar seats were taken but no line. Hostess/Waitress took my phone number and told me she'd call me in 20-25 minutes. I waited at a banh-mi place across the street for an hour with no call. When I returned at around 9 pm, there was a line up and I was told there were still no seats when I had to point out there actually were two seats (I was solo). I was livid and walked out and then they called. So yes, we were both a-holes. I decided to give them a second chance the very next day.   All I have to say is go early/right when it opens or on a long weekend when it's not as busy (when it opens). Music is great. Venue is very small. It's a nice first date place.  Staff are great and friendly (despite what the situation above looks like. I think we had off-days). You will smell Korean food wafting throughout the joint. It will make you hungry!   I ATE/DRANK  The Bulleit is a very solid drink and mine was made my the co-owner so it was the perfect amount of booze and eggwhite and shaken hard.   The chicken wings are EXCELLENT value. They have a bit of kick to them and they are meaty and delicious. I actually couldn't finish mine!  The pork bun is equally as delicious and not as spicy as I thought. It's a medium spicy but the bun cuts through that.   Not a fan of the pork rice, unfortunately (especially with the egg on top).    OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  I hope it becomes an old soul. A great addition to the gentrified Ossington hood even though we didn't get off on the right start."}
{"text":"This place is spectacular! Expect to wait for a table during peak times, but I've also gotten a table here on the fly. BEST late night eats, and also just a great place any time. Fights over the Loosey may end a date, just order two."}
{"text":"Food was delicious! Wings, bulgolgi cheesesteak, slaw, the \"loosey\" all amazing ! Service was good but the food came out at different times which was weird. All in all great food !"}
{"text":"Only gets a 4 because I refuse to hand out 5s! Food was phenomenal. Have the bao and loosey! The mackerel was awesome! I will def definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went again, and it was even better! The music volume had decreased, service was friendlier, and every bite of the food was spectacular.   The atmosphere here is like a seedy hole-in the wall dive bar in the best kind of way.   Did I mentioned how entertaining watching the hustle and bustle in the kitchen is?  (Flaming woks!)   We had some Mackeral, torched table side (fun to watch), and a tasty and satisfying dish. We also had the beef short rib rice bowl, all the elements and flavors  really pop and go together perfectly, and we shared it and  the Mackeral and it was more than enough for two people.   Overall another really great experience here!"}
{"text":"Odd Seoul is a fucking joke. I mean that in all earnest, because I was laughing the whole time, I ate there. It didn't seem real. But it is. Unfortunately. It's a black hole that sucks hipsters in.  I was recommended this place by many people and I'm no longer friends with them.  When I first sat I looked at the gentleman to my right and though 'only douches opt for chopsticks when forks are more appropriate' ...but wait. I'm getting ahead of myself.   First, drinks are served with gas station bagged iced. Square, and easily melty. This will water your already flavorless drink down.  I should have recognized this red flag. In addition the drinks lack execution and even their descriptions are done to death.   Second, I ordered the 'avocado slaw'. This was not a slaw by any standard but a pile of mixed greens who were overly dressed in sesame oil and sweet sauce. The dressing used is what white people think Asian food should be. Overly, nauseatingly sweet. Hidden within were 3 browned avocado chunks and a handful of carrot threads. At this point I asked for a fork and the waiter laughed 'we don't have any, I can bring you a spoon'. As tempting as eating a salad with a spoon was, I opted out and just discarded it, seeing as it was inedible, anyway.    Third, we ordered the 'Loosey'. It's good. But if you replicate a Big Mac you aren't a star.     All in all Odd Seoul wants to be an ironic dive but ends up being a total dud, defying flavor and logic."}
{"text":"Great service! Excellent food! Came in to have dinner with a friend from out of town. Was told there was a 30 minute wait. They called us in 10 and we were seated right away by a friendly waitress. The waitress explained the menu and asked us if we had any questions. Ordered the rice bowls and they were delicious ! Generous portions of meat and veggies. Very flavourful. Filled our glasses with water quite frequently. Very pleased with the service and the food. Well worth the wait! Would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Came here a few times with some Co-workers. Place has a cool vibe but a little tight for big groups. Music is loud and the bar was surprisingly not busy when I've been there. PBR's on Ossington is a bit overplayed but it goes well with snack food. There food sometimes ventures off the path too much, but I guess it's fitting with their name. Had squash poutine and wings, both amazing. Also shared the pork neck platter. I admit, I loved this dish.. but the price?! If you even remotely know how much pork neck costs then you know what I'm talking about. That aside, I'll come again."}
{"text":"Nope. you can;t call yourself a dive bar and hire  an asshole maitre'd.  They told us we could not sit because all of our party had not arrived. Too full of themselves."}
{"text":"I came to Odd Seoul on a Friday night and had to wait a little bit, but nothing ridiculous. As expected, it was packed to the brim but service was quick (and a little unattentive and kind of snarky). We started with the buffalo tofu bites and bulgolgi cheese steak because so many people raved about it. The tofu bites were subpar, but the cheesesteak really stole the show, despite being such a small portion.   Then we shared the sizzling chicken plate. It's served with a side of rice and daikon slices for sharing and while it looked and smelled great, I felt like I was eating chicken with a variety of vegetables that didn't really mesh well drenched in honey. I wasn't too impressed with the tastes of the meal or the amount of food you get for the price. Odd Seoul is definitely a cool place to hangout for drinks, but I can't say I'll be coming back for the food."}
{"text":"Was there for dinner last night and had quite an awful experience. The night started off fantastically, had great drinks and the waitress was very helpful in recommending food. Food, was delicious. Fantastic really, esp the Loosey and the cheesesteak. The music was crazy loud and we asked to have it turned down a titch, no luck, but not that big of a deal.   The problem started after we settled our tab, 120.00 bucks no less, when we were rudely asked if we could move to the bar to finish our drinks. I had a quarter of a beer left...... really?, we couldn't just finish our drinks at the table we had dinner at? So we comply, and move all our stuff, jackets etc, to the bar.....And the bar seats she wanted to give us still had crap on them, no accommodation made what-so-ever for us moving. It was like we were inconveniencing them more by moving, even though they made us. Then.... To make matters worse, ten minutes into sitting at the bar,  we were told if we weren't going to order more food or drinks we had to leave to let others sit down. We turn around, no one was waiting in line. They were literally trying to throw us out, twice, at the end of our meal! Basically: we got your money, so now you can piss off, cause we don't give a crap that you are enjoying a conversation and a cocktail. Absolutely brutal. Tainted the whole meal and the fact that the food was pretty good. Can't believe the rudeness of a business trying to make it in the service industry. Incredible."}
{"text":"I first stumbled upon Odd Seoul about a year ago, and have since made it a staple stop for late night snacking. I'm pretty sure that there was one week in April where I stopped by Odd Seoul no fewer than 4 times for a late night burger!   The famed \"loosey\" is a gooey, saucy burger that will fly your tipsy soul straight to heaven! If you've ever had a Persian style burger that emphasizes the meat and sauce mixture, then you will be familiar with this deliciousness!   I've tried several of the other items including the fried rice, wings, and poutine and have not really been blown away by any of them. The poutine is probably the best accomplice if the loosey does not satisfy your appetite.   The drinks are pretty decent, the old fashion is a win! Service has been quick and hassle free whenever I've been there.   Overall a great stop if you show up at the right time and for the right purpose!"}
{"text":"Cons 1. This place has no sign and it's very hard to find if its your first time.  2. The whole basement including the washroom has a stink of aged oil. And environment in the basement and the sinks are badly maintained. 3. That pork belly thing is fried too hard and has no pork belly in it period. It tasted like a deep(too hard) fried fast food meatball from a freezer 4. Avocado salad has probably 5 avocados in it. 5. The Buffalo tofu was hell. Never had a tofu fried as hard on the crust as this one. Once you bite in, you know wanna finish eating it.  6.the pork kimchi fried rice has nothing special, not enough salt. No surprise in the flavours. 7.OVERRATED. FOOD IS BAD  PROS 1.Drink was okay 2. Service was okay"}
{"text":"\ Koreally good. Kor..poreal...bliss! /  A moment happens on Ossington where all the restos close and things get dark, quickly, for the hungry and thirsty. Lakeview? :/   The bars along Dundas? 8( Plus you want snacks.  Problems all solved by Odd Seoul! The restaurant whose spelling takes 3 attempts if you are me!   The kitchen's open til 2am, the interior is high, deep and narrow, with a very pretty front window and well-chosen fittings (yes, this *is* analogy for the kind of drunk queen west girl you'd score with here).   Odd Seoul's owned by the chef and his brother; Korean guys raised in Philadelphia, so the food profile is ***Seoul-Philly soulful***.   In decent portions at ~$7, you can really mini-feast on everything you want bar food to be.  We got: O.S. chicken wings - super sugary spicy glaze and some crunch. Many fingerlicks (IMHO a perfect couple food but my understanding of romance is historically muddled),  Steamed buns - good but as always too much dough for my preferences, and the  Lamb skewers.   A brief word about the lamb: you eat it and you are 16 at Greekfest with a mickey in your backpack and your boyfriend is rolling a joint and you just made out. Transportive. Herbal. Great.  I'm going back for the Bulgogi Cheesesteak. Oh man oh man.  The staff are nice - smart, quick - $5 Tecate tallboy and a Bulleit smash (classic style, cracked pepper on top. Good.) and a friendly crowd to the tune of 'soju shots all around'.  And finishing my night bounce-swaying to WuTang with a chicken wing in the air?  Yes, please.   Yes please forever."}
{"text":"Yummy ! This place is super good.    Small place and no resos here so the 30-45 minute wait on an impromptu Saturday night visit was expected. Went for a drink next door at bellwoods and they called us back in 25 minutes.   We sat at the bar which was kinda crammed but ok for us. One thing they could improve is to add hooks under the bar for jackets and bags - holding a big winter jacket and your purse while sitting on a bar stool while trying to eat can be a challenge.   The squash poutine is a must try. The mandu are so-so. The kimchi fried rice was pretty good and a huge potion. The loosey was the star of the night. How can you go wrong with buttered grilled bread.   Cheap stiegl pints and friendly enough service. The bill was very reasonable (especially for the ossington strip).   Would go back!"}
{"text":"Odd Seoul Hack: How to Pig Out On Korean Tapas And Keep Your Dignity Too  1) Spot the Hidden Restaurant: Like many hidden bars and restaurants in Toronto (Track & Field, Apt. 200, 416 Snack Bar), the seductive beauty about Odd Seoul is first in finding it. To help you navigate, when you're at Bang Bang, peer across the street for an unmarked storefront. They open 6 PM-2 AM, Monday to Saturday, closed Sunday.  2) Seating: The small space adds charm and character to Odd Seoul, seating less than 50 hipsters. There are seats at the bar, 1-on-1's, or group tables (5-6 friends). No reservations, so you'll have to add your name to the list upon arrival. Waits can be 30-45 minutes (but np, head to Communist Daughter/Get Well for a drink while you wait).  3) Service: Cool/chill but never discourteous. It can be slow, but this is easily mitigated when you know what you want to order (a must try: the sinful and borderline criminally delicious pork neck; see below). Because this place is so popular, I do recommend being mindful of others waiting in line. -Nobody wants to miss out on the pork neck while you take baby sips of your drink and listen to you whine about how you couldn't get tickets to Adele's 2016 sold out concert.  4) Vibe: A dive bar with hip-hop and funk music, usually full of late 20's to 30's peeps. Hipster attire and moustaches are rampant. Wooden tables illuminated by Einstein light bulbs, which set a retro mood with a line of sight view into the kitchen (where the real magic happens).  5) Food and Drinks: Hands down, we come here for only one thing: the off-the-menu pork neck platter ($25). It is a succulent, sweet-spicy-smoky roast pork sections that are marinated in daeji gogi (Korean) spices, with a side of fresh and tangy bean sprout salad - perfect for 2 people. You'll feel like royalty when this platter comes out, and then...  --Fair warning #1, the pork neck does take about 30-40 mins to prepare. Fair warning #2, picture the scene from the Walking Dead, where the zombies feast on some gory guts. Yes, the best way to enjoy this mouth-watering dish is to shamelessly eat with your hands - and nobody will judge! -Other snacks are $5-20, and drinks range from good lagers and IPAs to crisp cocktails.--  Odd Seoul, a cloaked, Korean-American snack bar along the Ossington strip, is one of the most beloved restaurants in Toronto. Whether you are a local hipster, Yelp Elite, or new to Toronto, come here to eat Korean tapas and merry-make; the flavours of the pork neck are out of this world."}
{"text":"I don't get what the fuss is about. Service is bad, food is sub par, drinks are not at 'dive bar' prices. Meh, will not return."}
{"text":"Odd Seoul is a Koren snack bar on Ossington. It's popular; we dropped in around 7:00 on a recent weeknight and had to grab a beer up the street while we waited for half an hour.   The wait was worth it. A bulgogi cheese steak and the \"loosey\" burger were delicious and fast food-esque, and were only $5 each. Tempura shrimp were great too. My wife was a big fan of the wings; I thought they were a little over-breaded and over-sauced. The pork belly and kimchi fried rice was good but not as delicious as the snackier part of the menu. Buffalo tofu was perfectly crispy and nailed the taste of classic buffalo wings.  The room is more welcoming than sister restaurant Hanmoto, but the food is not quite as good. While not every dish was a hit, the price pushes this over the top for me. We got more food than we could eat, plus three drinks, for $80. That's hard to beat."}
{"text":"Easily one of the best restaurants in the city. Great food, great drinks, great service. Literally everything on the menu is unreal bruh."}
{"text":"Seriously love this place!  Best drinking late night food. Great service and great speciality drinks. We got the wings and the fried rice. We also got the steam buns, my only compliant is that the bun was a little too big."}
{"text":"I know this might be a popular spot. But the service \"policy\" is really rigid and not friendly. I was rejected to sit down when my friends were parking the car while there were plenty of place inside. The automatic 20% tips for 5 of us made me feel like robbed. Honestly for the service quality 20% is like a crime. Wings and ribs are rich in flavor but way too salty. Definitely not recommended."}
{"text":"I came with my boyfriend and another friend to this busy bar inspired restaurant on a Tuesday evening. The decor is rustic, but modern, with a mixture of bar seating, high tables and small square tables at the back. Being a small group of only 3, we had to share the high table with another group (which wasnt too bad, just a little cramped)   Food wise we ordered juicy wings, squash poutine, the loosey, bulgogi cheese steak, grilled mackerel, and the 20oz sirloin steak to share. I loved the squash poutine and the sirloin steak. The squash came slightly fried and was amazingly sweet - and not oily at all. The steak came with huge sheets of thinly sliced pickled radish that you can use to wrap rice, steak, and whatever else you want. It was weird at first but quickly grew on me. Unfortunately I disliked everything else we ordered. The wings are wayy too garlicky. While the loosey and bulgogi cheek steak was tender and juicy, however, everything came with a huge helping of onions. It was just a little too much in my opinion.   Pricing wise its slightly on the expensive side for certain menu items - like the $35 steak (it was good, but it didnt seem like a 20oz steak since it was sliced up and covered with a heaping amount of green and white onions).   Personally I wouldnt see myself coming back here...but if you like strong flavours and onions and onions and onions, this would be the place to be."}
{"text":"I liked the atmosphere. The drinks and food were alright.. could have used a bit more finesse. I've had better cocktails and the dishes were hit or miss. I'd come back for a drink OR NINE"}
{"text":"I would have to give this little casual spot a solid 3.5 if I were to look at the food alone. 4 stars if I included the attentive service and price.  This casual restaurant tries to serve some unique Korean-fusion tapas-style dishes but as an avid Korean food lover, I was a little disappointed. The BULGOGI CHEESESTEAK was satisfying but not exciting- perfect amount of beef, mild cheese, and what tasted like mayo and siracha sauce on a toasted bun. The OS WINGS were both crispy and saucy- great combination. The SHORT RIBS RICE BOWL was disappointing- mixing the cold lettuce and zucchini (as the waitress suggested) made the whole dish cold and did not meld the flavours together very well. It made me want the traditional bibimbop stone bowls! Although the short ribs were very flavourful. Lastly we tried the SQUASH POUTINE, which was probably my favourite dish- crisp squash with warm gravy and topped with kimchi. A surprisingly good flavour combination.  OVERALL: Interesting little Korean fusion dive on the Ossington strip. The food is not very unique but makes me wanting the traditional Korean dishes in Korea town more. I would probably only come back for some cocktails and the squash poutine for a late night hang out. Not dinner."}
{"text":"WHAT TO TRY?!  The squash poutine, the tempura chicken with deviled egg, the torched mackerel and if you have a bigger appetite, the sizzling plates are good to share with 2-3 ppl!  I particularly liked the squash poutine because of the intricacies and layers of flavors to this dish. Not like the typical poutine, this dish has mayo, kimchi, pickled radish, black sesame seeds, and green onions. Very different approach to using fried squash rather than potato or yam fries!  The tempura chicken with deviled egg was also good. It's a bigger dish and has enough chicken to share with two ppl. Dip in the mayo and add on some seaweed! Yum.   The torched mackerel is a rather plainer dish where it doesn't have much seasoning to the dish. It's nice to have a dish that doesn't have a lot of flavors going on when all the other dishes are very sauce heavy. The mackerel is torched at tableside and it's great to dip in the soy sauce.   I didn't order the sizzling plates but looking at other tables, the sizzling plate is towering with food so it's good to order to share. It comes with white rice too.   LAST TIP?!  This is a hole in the wall where you might miss it if you're not looking carefully. The name of the restaurant is rather in a discrete location and on top of a mailbox actually! Be prepared to wait in line though because they don't take reservations as the restaurant is rather small and there's usually a lot of people. Especially with prices that are reasonable for the dishes, of course this place is going to attract people to come visit and come back!"}
{"text":"a hipster hang out place... prices are typical hipster place prices.. (overpriced) small portions.. more of a place to taste food rather than to feast on..  waitress does a good job of explaining every dish as the menu can be confusing.  expect to see your typical hipster customer.., v-neck t's, lumberjack dress shirt, and scruffy beard ...  i looked around and thats all i saw..   foods okay, but did not blow me away by any means.  you come here for the vibe more than the food in my opinion."}
{"text":"Probably one of my favorite spots in the city! The loosey and the squash poutine are my favorite items! Everything is tapas and meant to share but could crush a whole poutine to myself! Great cocktails aswell!   Cool chill vibe and great music is always playing"}
{"text":"First of all they have Makgoli that isn't just out of a bottle.  Spending time in Korea I developed a taste for it and only wish they had it in flavours... why can't someone open a Makgoli bar?  I digress.  I really like the idea of Korean tapas and Odd Seoul delivers.  I'm a big fan of the torched mackerel which is admittedly small but quick torching it really makes the flavour pop.   The Bulgogi cheesesteak is the clear winner however, its praise is well earned.    The restaurant itself is inviting and casual and I didn't experience any of the service problems that others did.  That said, I've only gone here during the week when it is less busy.  In all, I'm a fan"}
{"text":"Awesome cocktails.  Delicious dinner of bbq pork next, double orders of pork dumplings and shrimp tempura's.  All around good place.  Wouldn't really call it a dive bar.  Perfect balance of loud(ish) music, good food and solid drinks."}
{"text":"My vacation to Toronto provided some amazing culinary treats over the week we we there.... Odd Seoul was one of the very best, amongst many greats! Maybe I'm a bit biased, as the Lower Ossington neighborhood reminds me very much of my own neighborhood back home, but the vibe is just right while the look and feel of the bar are warm and inviting, while also conveying the proper confidence that you just know you're going to get a really good cocktail there.  We tried several of the craft cocktails - including the Bulleit Smash and the Odd Fashioned - and nothing disappointed! Same for the menu, which is limited in quantity, not in quality! I swear, they could double the number of items and I'd still have eaten them all! Particularly, their steam buns, Bulgogi Cheesesteak and Tempura Prawns were incredible. As a bartender, I always like to get to know the staff, management and owners of the places I visit, particularly when I really like the place, and I did have the fortune of meeting Leeto, who owns Odd Seoul with his brother Leemo, and I must say I wish nothing but many years of success for you both (if you're reading this) and we will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Came here on the recommendation of a Toronto Yelp Elite.  There is no sign out front.  Locate this place by knowing the address.  Is Odd Seoul that good they can pull this off?  Aniya! (Korean for \"that is not the case\")  Some interesting korean inspired dishes that sounded good on paper but failed to deliver on the taste test.  Here are my random thoughts on the food we tried.  - Buffalo fried tofu.  Thick (maybe too heavy?) crunchy battering.  Loved the crunchy texture.  Solid buffalo flavoring.  Both wife and I approve.  - Loosey.  Small patty on toasted bread.  Not bad.  Per the server, their most popular tapas.    - Pork belly mandoo - deep fried.  Only tasted its oily shell.  was OK.  - Chicken tempura with deviled egg.  Chicken was ok.  The deviled egg saved the dish.  - Kimchi and pork belly fried rice.  Big miss!  Not spicy enough and the flavors clashed.  Tasted fishy too.  Not sure where the fishiness came from!  - Bulgogi cheesesteak.  Interesting take.  Def tasted the bulgogi undertones.  Decor was dark with brick walls--smokey tavern feel.  wife loved the ambience.  I find the value in dim lighting.  You notice the distractions on your periphery less and you can focus on what is before you...  Ultimately, 3rd tier food.  An excellent chef can raise their menu to a whole nother level or two.  If you are tourist, do you need to come here?  Probably not..."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in Toronto. I loved everything we ordered. The restuarant was a little difficult to find at night, it's a small place and the sign outside is hardly visible. Very dark inside, which I think was a little uncomforable, I want to be able to see my food.  We had the tempura prawns, bulgogi cheese steak and beef short ribs platter. Everything was delicious. The prawns were my favourite. Perfectly cooked and coated in a spicy declicious sauce, this is a must try item. The short ribs platter was big enough for two to share. The cheese steak was really cheesey and excellent.  They wouldn't let us wait at the bar. It was -20 outside and we were told to go out until our table was ready. Had I not been so excited to try this place, I would have just left. But I'm glad I waited. Definitely worth waiting!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! We found some great spots while in Toronto but this was my favorite. If this place was in Chicago, I'd easily go there once a week.   I made my girlfriend go back there a couple nights later just so I could get another Bulleit Smash; a great egg white cocktail with crack pepper."}
{"text":"Boyf was craving Korean (which he's been doing a lot recently), so we did a little research and Odd Seoul popped up. Since pork bone soup sounded ZERO appealing to me with the recent heat we've been having, I was totally on board with Odd Seoul's take on Korean cuisine, particularly the small plates/tapas aspect. I love being able to order and try several things in one visit, although I will say I was a little jelly of the people who ordered the larger options as they looked AMAZING coming out of the kitchen.   Now for our visit! First, we almost walked right past since the ONLY signage is the little 'I passed my Health Inspection' sign in the front... very bizarre.  We ordered the Squash Poutine, Bulgogi Cheesesteak, SO Wings, and Pork Belly Mandoo.   The food was excellent, particularly the cheesesteak and the poutine - the unique textures and flavour combinations of both were fantastic.  And all of this for under $50!   If you're looking for something a little different, Odd, if you will, I would highly recommend giving this place a try!!"}
{"text":"Wow! Shockingly awful service and even more shocking bill.  I attempted to order one of their cocktails, the Odd Fashioned with Bulleit bourbon rather than the Crown Royal that it came with.  The original cocktail I tried to order was $11. Somehow my Old Fashioned was $18.  I was charged $14 for an old fashioned a $4 for selecting a premium liquor... Sidenote: Bulleit bourbon appears in one of the other $11 cocktails and no other drink on the menu starts at $14.  I brought this up to the waiter, and he just said that's how much it is and too bad.  Side-side note: the service was insane from the moment I walked in and I probably should have just trusted my instincts.  I walked in took a seat at a group table in the mostly empty bar and very unhappy looking waitress asked me if I could move somewhere else (which was fine, but no one there seemed to be in a good mood - which really just isn't a good sign that things are being run well.  After being seated, I was handed off to another waiter, who seemed much friendlier, but who had some of the most intense body odor I've experienced outside of walking past a particularly smelly homeless person. But I was like, hey, at least he's friendly and the drink I got was reasonably good, as was the food.  Again, the trouble came with how he handled the cocktail price... I mentioned that it seemed inordinately high, compared to the prices of the listed cocktails and that he might consider telling a customer if they are about to order a drink that is almost exactly like the listed cocktails, but for which they will be charged $18 instead of $11 dollars for. I'm very glad I didn't order more than one of those!  I'm not personally going to miss the extra few dollars, but I feel that the pricing was completely ridiculous and that they are trying to see what they can get away with. As soon as I walked out the door, I felt like I should have actually fought the charge, but it was very unexpected, as I've never had a bar charge me so much for a cocktail (and I live in NYC, so that's saying something)."}
{"text":"Great place to grab some relatively cheap Asian fushion eats and grab some drinks. The food here is quite affordable and most are Korean/Asian inspired. What I've tried:  - squash poutine.. Highly recommend! Has almost like an Indian taste to it (reminds me of a samosa) and the squash is great, especially the crunchy pieces - wings.. Not bad! For those who love saucy wings, this is for you! - tempura chicken and deviled egg.. So good! The chicken has a great batter to it that really adds to the taste and the sauce that comes with the dish amplifies the taste even more. The deviled egg is yummy too - kimchi and pork belly fried rice.. Prob one of my favs. They served it in a Chinese takeout container! - torched mackerel.. Super cool. They torch it in front of you! Comes with some ginger and a sauce. Serving size is quite small however so be warned! - tempura prawns.. Yummy! A little overpriced I think"}
