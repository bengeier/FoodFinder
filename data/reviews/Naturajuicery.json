{"text":"Si vous n'êtes pas satisfait, on vous paye le repas. Et bien, vous serez satisfait ! Petite ambiance décontracter, jus délicieux et bénédictines bon a sen lécher l'assiette. Vraiment belle découvert!"}
{"text":"This place is excellent and has fantastic juices and juice shots. Filled up here for breakfast as we were passing through on a road trip and this place was the highlight of our time in Montreal (because it was so amazing). Service was excellent and incredible detail was given to food presentation and preparation as well. Never seen such perfect looking and tasting veggies before."}
{"text":"Food=yummy. I liked my house-made pumpkin tea and acai bowl, and my friends enjoyed their sandwiches. They raved about the juice, too. It's fairly vegan friendly and very vegetarian friendly, though there are some meat options as well.   Service=slow! Our food took a while to come out and our waiter disappeared once we had it, though he was certainly working his hardest, as the place was incredibly understaffed. It's a cute spot with great eats, they just a few more folks working there!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch with my sister. A very cute little juicery and cafe. I had a salad and she had a poke bowl. The food is amazing and good quality. The staff is very friendly and kind. I would definitely recommend! And the sun dried tomato dressing is wonderful!"}
{"text":"First time eating here and I don't have any complaints! I did not actually try any of their juices but their food was great!  I ate the cage free chicken avocado sandwich, it had bacon, and other delicious toppings and the waitress was kind enough to substitute the yogurt sauce with mayo for me. She was very nice and kept the restaurant clean and well stocked. Price was average for Montreal. It was the perfect lunch and I will absolutely return!"}
{"text":"1 mot. : fraicheur !   Vraiment, un atout sur Le Plateau pour une clientèle qui aime manger santé et frais.   Il y a plusieurs choix de sandwich et de salade pour le lunch, avec uniquement des produits frais. L'endroit est aussi producteur de 'jus frais', faits chaque matin et non pressé à froid. Ils ont plusieurs cures de detox, les jus sont délicieux et valent l'essai! Également, ils ont un brunch le week-end (je ne l'ai pas essayé parcontre).   Lors de mes récents passages, le service était super gentil et dynamique. Bref, j'y retourne pour un 'fast-food' , qui n'a rien de mauvais."}
{"text":"We walked a good 5-6 miles in Parc Mont Royal so we needed a rest and lunch. This place looked good.   I had a very good chicken breast and avocado sandwich here. The multi grain bread was excellent. I also got a Caribbean fruit smoothie which was so good I slurped it down in no time. Guess I needed to replenish lost minerals. Haha  My friend had the Clarity smoothie which she rated a 9 out of 10.   Everything was very fresh. I would eat here again."}
{"text":"Seriously delicious! I got the Açaï bowl, and my friend got the Florentine, both were SO good! Everything is extremely fresh. There are piles of vegetables behind the counter, industrial juicers and a very friendly wait staff. Super recommend for anyone needing a break from croissants and poutine!"}
{"text":"Chouette endroit pour une pause rafraîchissement. Le menu smoothies et jus est très varié et les combinaisons proposées font toutes envie. La plupart des jus sont pressés à froid et les ingrédients bio.  Le cadre est super joli et parfaitement raccord avec le côté \"naturel\" de ce que l'on peut y déguster. Ils proposent aussi des brunchs, bagels, sandwich et salades de toute sorte. Le personnel quant à lui est très sympa et plutôt cool (c'est pas ultra rapide mais au final ça colle à l'atmosphère chill du café).  Franchement un bon spot pour les amateurs!"}
