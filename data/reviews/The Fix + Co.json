{"text":"I love this place. Had their raw chocolate bar and I will definitely be back.
You pay for very good and clean quality food."}
{"text":"All the juices at the Fix and Co are fresh, delicious and healthy. I love that i can buy multiple at a time and store them in my fridge when i need a healthy fix and my body genuinely feels nourished and energized after drinking them. I recommend everyone in the Etobicoke area to pay this juice bar a visit!!"}
{"text":"Great juices, unreal salads and a beautiful atmosphere inside!  A one stop shop for getting your daily serving of veggies!"}
{"text":"The Daily dose is so delicious!!! I bought the beginners cleanse and so far I'm feeling energized and great! Would definitely recommend trying out their juices!"}
{"text":"Short and sweet, like my visit this week. I'm giving them full marks on the following grounds:

a) Such a breath of fresh air in the longbranch community, this is the new wave that is coming so get used to it stodgy old business owners afraid of change. the young, ambitious business owners are coming with their sustainable, hip, cool ideas.

b) Their location is a tad hidden but a total score once you find it. Very well designed inside with a massive menu which includes smoothies, cold press juices and many other delicious noms - all good for you. I had the Piña, which was kinda like a Piña Colada except healthy and with lots of spinach in it. YUM!

c) Price point is right on par with similar businesses such as Booster Juice who claim to be as healthy but substitute concentrated fruit juices in for real fruit!

The FIX and Co is exactly that, my healthy breath of fresh air fix in an otherwise slowly changing longbranch. Check them out, just north of Lakeshore on 30th!

Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"I was on my way to run an errand nearby, so I figured I'd check out this place's offerings before going on with my day. I had read the other reviews that it was slightly harder to find (thanks other Yelp'ers) so I noticed the black/white sign tucked in behind the cleaner facing 30th and that helped :)

I came in looking for a cold pressed juice as a treat. I asked for the nutritional information and the clerk made a valiant effort to get me an answer, but she suspected that their in-house nutritionist had the binder and thus it wasn't available. Regardless, she came over to the fridge to help me pick one out. I went with the least calorie & sugar option, 'THE ANTIDOTE', which came to $13 with tax.

Considering it was nearly sugar free, it was surprisingly tasty. Their in-house menu looked pretty good, too. The clerk apologized again to me for not having the info ready, which was nice of her. 

It's definitely a pricey place but you pay for quality. The inside is pretty minimal with a handful of seats so I suspect you're best just grabbing take out."}
{"text":"Really great little shop run by two very dedicated women. I highly recommend their smoothies."}
{"text":"Feeling under the weather ... long cold spring in Toronto this year.

Grabbed some juice and power bowls.... already feeling much better.

Might do a cleanse during my staycation in a few weeks!"}
{"text":"Ok so I have been back...multiple times and have tried their taco bowl (I really enjoyed it), Fixer Elixir juice (citrus-y and delicious), and the Blue Crush (tropical), PB & J (decadent), and Higher Ground (sweet and spicy...in the best way) smoothies (all fabulous and all $10 + tax, if I remember correctly). Everything has always been good, however, I will say that there are some inconsistencies in staff knowledge and product quality. Some of the staff are happy to make accommodations for you (e.g. swapping ingredients for aversions/allergies), whereas other staff have tried to convince me otherwise, even though it states on the menu that modifications can be made. I also had the Higher Ground smoothie on 2 separate occasions, and they tasted completely different and had two totally different textures. The first time I had it, the smoothie was creamy, sweet at the start with a spicy finish, and cold - it was perfect. The second time I had it, it was creamy, but it tasted way too much like protein powder, didn't have the spicy finish I loved the first time, and it was warm (maybe not as much ice was added this time?), it just wasn't as fantastic and amazing as I remembered. 

Anyway, this probably will not deter me from returning to The Fix + Co, but it did open my eyes to the fact that certain items on the menu may taste different each time."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times, and each time I find that the customer service is a little less desirable than the time before it. The employees always seem a tad bit annoyed and not really interested in helping. I also find the service a little too slow. The smoothies are delicious, albeit a tad bit expensive. The store interior is quite cute."}
{"text":"So many delicious juices and smoothies! I just wish they were open earlier on weekends and later on weekdays. I feel like I always miss out because they are closed too early."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic juice bar. I had a soup and fresh, cold pressed juice. Both were fantastic. This is one of those places you can eat at without feeling bad about what you had. Love it!"}
{"text":"The location is a little blended in but once you find it, it's a hidden gem for sure! There's a good selection of juices to choose from. And they have mini-desserts that are such a healthy treat if you're craving something sweet!"}
