{"text":"The food was bland. I did not taste any cumin or cilantro.  The sauces taste like pureed tomatoes from a can. They put ground beef in most of their buffet items. No variation in meat. It tasted like some gringos was in there cooking."}
{"text":"This place is hit or miss. Service is decent. The meats in the buffet have been cold on some occasions yet great on others. Aside from that the quality of food has been great overall. It seems though they have issue keeping food stocked on it even when the location is not very busy."}
{"text":"To go order was cold and missing items. Only had two combination plates and an order of cheese dip but found my simple order to still be incomplete when reaching home. Food was bland, disappointing and certainly not worth the money, not even worth the trip there."}
{"text":"Charlotte University Location.    Reading the other reviews here on Los Arcos, I'm going to believe that we visited this location on a bad evening. This was the first visit to this location of Los Arcos, and we were not as impressed as with some other local locations of the namesake restaurant.  The atmosphere of the restaurant is very nice, actually much nicer than any other local Los Arcos location visited previously. Service was acceptable, nothing spectacular but adequate.  We both ordered the same entree, the Arroz Camerones. On the entrees arrival, we found the temperature of it to be lukewarm. It obviously had set several minutes before being picked up to be brought to our table.   I assume their shrimp used in this dish was that of Gulf shrimp. Both orders large shrimp had a very strong iodine taste to it, as typically found in the Gulf of Mexico Brown shrimp variety.   Unfortunately, there was a inordinate, overwhelming large amount of onions mixed in with the remaining ingredients. My companion asked the waitress if this was a normal amount of onions and about the coolness of the plate. The waitress graciously offered to take it back and have the plate remade, which we accepted.  I'm believing that we just visited on an off night and perhaps this location will be better on our next visit."}
{"text":"Beware of sketchy staff who break into cars!!! Oh, and their parking lot cameras are coincidently \"not recording.\" Never going back to this place again. Completely violated."}
{"text":"Second time here, lunch buffet, traveling through the area.  The place was very busy, so someone was enjoying their food, right?  I was not so lucky.  It looked like Mexican fare, but tasted like bland food.  Soon after I finished my meal, an uneasiness set in my stomach.  Ill hours later as I type this.  Just wasn't worth it."}
{"text":"Best Mexican restaurant in Charlotte so far. The waitresses are super nice and friendly. I'm Mexican and eat Mexican food all the time so I'm pretty picky but this place hit the spot. I eat here once or twice a week and it's always good."}
{"text":"So i graduated from a college town that had several wonderful mexican restaurants and since moving to charlotte i have been on the search for the \"one\". after several mexican restaurants, i have finally found the one. they have traditional chips and salsa to munch on while you order, menu looks great, and the decor is amazing. i highly recommend the pollo loco, it was so tasty!! i now know my go to mexican restaurant and i will be coming here much more frequently."}
{"text":"So my friend and I decided to try a new place yesterday. We saw they had decent drink specials like a $5 blue Margarita and $1 miller lite draft. Our server was pleasant and attentive, but the food left much to be desired. My chicken enchilada was dark meat and the margarita didn't taste like tequila, more blue Caracao and sugar in a smaller glass than what I expected. In addition, there were no \"taco Tuesday\" specials."}
{"text":"Good service. Good portions. But the food is bland an uninspired.  You'll  get more flavor at Taco Bell. We tried the Nachos Supreme, Chicken Quesdilla, Cheese Dip with Beef, and Enchiladas Rancheras.  Everything tasted pretty much the same.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Let's start by saying the food was not stellar.  They had a $7.99 lunch buffet with a decent selection.  I would say that the overall quality of the food is about what you would expect from somewhere that offers a $7.99 lunch buffet.  They had taco fixings, a few different fajita options, dips, chicken wings, fried shrimp... and some fried taquito things that resembled the frozen options from Trader Joe's.    I ordered off the vegetarian menu (the buffet wasn't labeled very well-- no mystery meats for me!), and the cheese enchilada was meh.  The bean tostada was actually surprisingly good.  Their guacamole was not freshly made, and it appeared that someone may have simply mixed pico in with a mix.   As far as drinks are concerned--I started out with a margarita, which tasted nothing like tequila.  It was very sweet, and I'm guessing it was about 99% mixer.  I opted for a draft Miller lite after this.  I like Miller lite, it's a good day drinking option... and what was served in that glass tasted nothing like Miller lite.  It had the distinct taste of a Yuengling, but not the correct color.  It smelled a bit like a Michelin Ultra... but had a small hint of a pilsner smell.  This leads me to believe that Los Arcos does not do a good job cleaning out their lines.  Needless to say I could not finish my 16oz beer.    I give this 3 stars, because the actual amount of food you're able to consume with the lunch buffet makes it a good value... but if you're looking for some quality Mexican cuisine I suggest looking elsewhere."}
{"text":"I will definitely come back here. The food portion was huge and for the price, you can't beat that! They have a buffet... although I'm unsure how I feel about a mexican buffet. I will have to try it sometime. Everything on my first visit was perfect. My only complaint is that the restroom was filthy."}
{"text":"I was intrigued by the fact that Los Arcos had a buffet for lunch...you don't see many mexican lunch buffets. I came by myself, the place was hopping with a lot of guys you could tell were work buddies but I was still seated immediately and had water and chips waiting when I got back from perusing the buffet. All of the staff were working their butts off, especially Carlos who was my server. The buffet had everything you would think a mexican buffet should have- build your own tacos, taco salads, fajitas, enchiladas, plus some extras: chilaquiles (!), watermelon, some good looking sauces/salsas. I was surprised that the buffet didn't have soggy overly oiled food...but they were replacing empty pans constantly so there were a lot of fresh options. It's a great deal for 7.50 and the locals seem to know it."}
{"text":"Staff is really friendly and the food is good, but standard, Mexican food. The drink specials are probably the best in Charlotte.  A 14oz frozen Margarita for $3 and a 22oz Dos Equis draft for $2.75 is pretty unbeatable."}
{"text":"Great buffet! Waitress was very nice and all the food seemed fresh and taste great. Came from Florida on business and will def come here again if I ever come back to north Carolina."}
{"text":"This is the best All-You-Can-Eat Lunch Buffet in the area.   The wait staff is so friendly and always comes around to clean plates and keep your drinks filled.   Make sure that you go with an empty stomach because the food is incredible.   It is definitely authentic Mexican food.  They keep the buffet stocked and fresh at all times always bringing out new food.   Definitely worth the drive to this location!   Great place to meet with family or friends as they have TV's on around the tables and the booths so you can watch what is going on in the world."}
{"text":"Wow. Great Mexican food! It looks like a hole in the wall, but the food is really good and super fresh and tasty! I got the Speedy Gonzales for lunch and not only was it delicious, but it only cost $2.99! You can't beat it!"}
{"text":"This place used to be located on N Tryon Street way back in the day (2009-2010) and it was pretty much the go-to Mexican place for UNCC students. Then it mysteriously and suddenly closed. Everyone was bummed.  Magically during my last year of undergrad, a new restaurant was being built near the boardwalk...and guess what it was? LOS ARCOS.  The anticipation was real. I drove by about once a month to see when the heck they were going to open!  Finally, I came in for my first meal. The chips and salsa were on par and the drink specials weren't bad either....it didn't feel like the old Los Arcos though.  If fact, in the years Los Arcos vanished from the scene, the other places triumphed over their absence. No longer were they the go-to Mexican place for UNCC students.  I then developed a love-hate relationship with the restaurant. Sometimes it would be good, but many times, I would feel like eating at another place instead.  I don't avoid Los Arcos, but it is definitely not my first choice for Mexican food in the area either.  Tori and I did get sick from eating here last year. It seemed to be mild, nothing that kept us home from work or school, but it wasn't pleasant!  It was probably an isolated experience though."}
{"text":"Bummed I missed the buffet (I came near to closing time in a Monday) but the Pollo Loco was crazy good: piping hot, spicy and delicious!  Best of all, I could wash it all down with an ice cold $2 Tecate."}
{"text":"Good food but a Friend who works there told me  they recycle their chips and salsa. That's gross man"}
{"text":"The drive-thru and buffett sign threw me off but it was good. Our waitress kept the chips piled and they were hot and fresh , served with house made sauce that was damn good. The steak fajita I ordered came out sizzling and was plenty tasty. It was slow at 530 on a Sat night and the food wait time was minimal. Nothing to complain about here, 5/5"}
{"text":"Great idea to have a Mexican buffet! Good was hot a fresh and they had a great variety! Would definitely go back when we're in the area!"}
{"text":"Went in for lunch. Nice interior. Staff was friendly. Food was very good. Had the choir-sauce appetizer and it was great. Will go back the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Would've been 5 stars if the food wasn't overly salty.  My husband and I didn't do the buffet we actually ordered from the menu and I felt there was no excuse to mess up the food."}
{"text":"I saw an advertisement for this restaurant on the back of one of my Harris Teeter receipts. I called to get more information and the lady that answered the phone told me that they had an All-You-Can-Eat Lunch Buffet 7 days a week from 11-3. So I decided to stop by and check them out. I must say that I am impressed. To be able to get authentic Mexican food for a great price ($7.99 Monday -Saturday and $9.99 on Sunday) and as a buffet is right up my alley.   The staff was very friendly from the time that I walked into the restaurant until the time I left (an hour and 15 minutes later). The serving staff did a great job. My cup was always full and one particular server kept coming back to make sure that I was good.   The restaurant appeared to be clean and easy to navigate.   Those of you that know me know that there are very few restaurants that I put my stamp of approval on and recommended to others...but this is definitely one of them.  Keep up the good work guys!!!"}
{"text":"So good. They have a lunch buffet and it is tasty. Best tortillas I ever had. Queso is delicious as well."}
{"text":"Favorite for years. Fresh food ,fair prices and hard working staff. Not flashy but solid."}
{"text":"The service here was terrible and I'm very disappointed nobody greeted me at the door. So I sat down within eyesight of what looked to be the greeter. Ten to fithteen minutes passed and nobody came to take my order. There were less than 10 people in the restaurant when I finally walked out."}
{"text":"With great relocations come even greater food. Only had the opportunity to get over to their old location near the Flying Saucer once and for some reason it wasn't all that memorable. When a co-worker mentioned going over to their newly opened establishment, I figured, ok, why not. Give em another go. Well, I was pretty impressed.   I don't remeber them ever having a lunch buffet before, maybe they did, just not sure. But in any case, it was pretty awesome if I must say so myself. More than just not bad for $7.50. Although I didn't take notice, I'm sure they have the same menu items as before.  The new layout is definitely worth noting. Great atmosphere, and a nice bar set-up which I think I'll be back to hang out around. Gotta figure out the drink specials next.  Great staff also!"}
{"text":"Great service from friendly staff. The frozen margaritas were the best I have ever had in Charlotte area. Food was good but I was left craving more cheese sauce. Interior was clean and spacious. A lot of people seemed to be drawn to the buffet so I guess it's pretty good."}
{"text":"The food is so good, I ordered a Pollo Loco and it was delicious and the service so special, ask for Lady she is the Best. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Remembered it being better at their old location, to be honest I was quite disappointed this last time. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Adult lunch buffet is only $7.99, $5.25 for kids 4-8.  Bill with tea comes to $9.99.  Pretty good food, stellar service.  Great if you don't have a lot of time."}
{"text":"The portions were very good, the service was good and the environment was comfortable. I would recommend this restaurant anyone."}
{"text":"My experience in this restaurant was terrible  the worst bad service They have no manners  bad food The appearance of the food In the menu you have another presentation and when they serve you it is very different from the menu"}
{"text":"I had high expectations of this restaurant as I've visited the second location numerous times and loved it until an incident with the manager has kept me from going back.(See review on Los Arcos #2)  And from reviews since my last visit, she seems to be running that beautiful location into the ground. It's sad because it has alot of potential.  This location is nothing like the one next to Eastland Mall.  The beer special was good--$1 tecate and heinken But other than that, nothing special.  My server must have been brand new and was 16 so she couldn't serve me my beer, nor could give me any recommendations on what to eat on the menu.  Menus were dirty and old. Bathroom ruined my appetite. The cleanliness was fine, but the smell. I won't describe it, but it's not one you want to experience while you're out to dinner.  Disappointed."}
{"text":"My friend and I go to this particular location all the time and we have never had an issue until today. We witnessed a small child running through the kitchen with his fingers in his nose and mouth touching various items. When we spoke to the manager she was extremely rude and said he was in the office. I didn't know restaurants washed their produced and carried meals through the office. She became combative and said she had better things to do, laughed in our faces and didn't make any attempt to show that she understood it was a serious and nasty problem.  If I could give no stars I would."}
{"text":"The nacho supreme with beef was really good, I especially liked the cheese. The restaurant was dead which is sad bc the food was good and the service was quick. Wings were too spicy for me but my husband enjoyed them."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible management, added fees to my bill when I gave my mom my left over guacamole, rather then throwing it away with out telling us.  Food is mediocre to begin with and bad management makes this a place to never visit."}
{"text":"I came across this place the other day while shopping in the plaza nearby and we decided to head here for dinner. I was surprised by the fact that it wasn't that busy inside given that it was a Saturday night but I actually enjoyed it that way. The restaurant was very clean which was also nice. This was just the kind of mexican food we were looking for, nothing fancy about it just your basic kind that you would expect to find at a place like this. Their salsa was good, not too chunky and their cheese sauce was also delicious. My husband and I both ordered two bean burritos with cheese sauce and a side of rice and we were both pleased. The bean burritos are a good size too so one might be enough for most people, we were really hungry!  We will def. be going back here when we get cravings!"}
{"text":"Came on a Sunday right before noon and just beat the church crowd like we hoped. This was my first time here and I was amazed at how crowded it got so quickly. We were seated right away but people after us weren't so lucky as they were stacked up outside. They had a Mexican buffet and a large menu with many items on it. Note of caution: if you don't like onions don't come here. There are loads and loads of onions in everything! The menu even states they have onions in everything. The only selection my poor wife had was a quesadilla because she hates onions. I chose the buffet and was not impressed with the what they had available. Enchiladas with ground beef and onions, taquitos with chicken and onion, ground beef and onion tacos, Mexican rice with onions, fried okra, French fries, refried beans (surprisingly with no onions), some quesadillas, and all the accoutrements that come along with Mexican food such as salsa, guacamole, sour cream, and cheese. They also had sopas for dessert. Overall the food was mediocre at best. The cost for the buffet for one and a quesadilla for my wife and two diet cokes came to a little over $15. We weren't rushed or anything but with the amount of people there they did run out of plates. The waiter was attentive to our needs as much as he could be; I never had an empty cup. I would not recommend this place to others as I have been to many other places that put this place to shame."}
{"text":"First visit to Los Arcos. I don't live in the area and was excited to try this place out with my brother. He ordered the #1 dinner combo which is a taco, burrito, and enchilada. I ordered the carnitas. We were really excited to see all of their draft beers were $1. When the food arrived, we only had one set of silverware and didn't notice until she left. My carnitas were awful. I could hardly cut them. I ate a small piece and had to tell the waitress that I couldn't eat it. They were over cooked and extremely fatty. Hugh disappointment. I reordered the taco combo which ended up being okay. About half way through my brothers meal, he realized it was wrong. There was no taco, but an unknown item instead. That aside, the three items were weak and small in size.   If I go back, I think the buffet is the way to go. Other reviews say it's only $8!! The family next to us got the buffet and it looked amazing. Between the dollar beers and the buffet, this could be a solid place for a Saturday lunch, but today was not a good experience."}
{"text":"I love this place and all of their food. We always get friendly service and the price is so decent. My favorite is the lunch buffet. So worth it!"}
{"text":"I was staying at a local hotel, craving Mexican, not the frozen kind, but the real deal.  As my luck would have it, I found it here at Los Arcos.  A great surprise on my first bite (and last one too)!  REALLY GOOD!!  It was hot, it was fresh, and it was tasty!!  They had a special drink too that I tried, also refreshingly good!  Graciela was our waitress and she had a very witty personality.  Totally enjoyed the evening and will even go out of my way to come back here!   (If I had to say one thing they could improve upon, it would be the salsa needs some work).  Still 5 stars."}
{"text":"Recently, I was forced to visit this place for a company lunch and again, I was highly disappointed.  The staff was not courteous of the obvious fact that the group outing was for a business purpose and in fact, they treated us as if we were an annoyance  because of our group size.  A group of 8 is not a large party, but apparently for them, they were not ready to handle such a \"large\" group.  Overall, the food was mediocre and the service was horrible."}
{"text":"We found this place last year when we visited Charlotte for the dirt races and was looking forward to a return trip this year. We opted for the lunch time buffet, and were once again delighted with the offerings provided. I'm not usually a fan of buffets as I find things tend to sit around too long, but that simply isn't the case here as most items are put out in small quantities and replenished often. We opted for the margaritas with an upgrade to 1800 tequilia and were not let down as they were fabulous.  The staff members are absolutely some of the friendliest people you could ask for as there seems to be a family that works there that remembered my friend and I from last year....\"You're from Pheeely, no ?\"  Not sure that we are coming back next year, but if we return to Charlotte, we will definitely make a return trip to Los Arcos."}
{"text":"Every time I crave Mexican food I make a stop at Los Arcos.I've been going here all the way back to when they were located on N Tryon St.You can't go wrong with the food and it is for an affordable price.The lunch buffet is awesome too!Staff is very friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"I missed the lunch buffet and went for dinner.  The hostess could not recommend anything at dinner and told me lunch buffet was the best.  Anywho, I ordered the texacana beef, chicken and shrimp with peppers and onions over a bed of lettuce.  The hostess said that would be good for me.  When it came out, I was unimpressed.  It tasted bland and I asked for some dressing over it.  They returned with green salsa.  The hostess said I knew you wouldn't like it and you should not have ordered.  hmmm.  Still not tasty, I took it To-Go.  The only good food I ate at dinner were the chips and salsa.  I will return for the lunch buffet for another review."}
{"text":"The lunch buffet is excellent and affordable. There is a nice variety of foods.   Everything is fresh and plentiful.  And never did I have to wait for a refill of tea.  The staff is friendly.  The restaurant is clean.  This was my first visit and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Well, finally tried this new location. Won't have to go there again! The food is mediocre at best. Small bowl of chips, with an even smaller bowl of salsa. I ordered the mixed fajitas and it was just okay. Not enough meat for me and enough green peppers to choke a horse. No sour cream or guacamole which is essential to good fajitas. Over cooked.  But worse than the food was the poor lighting in this new place. Horrible florescent bulbs give the place the look of a morgue. The one great thing about this visit, was the live music (Fridays 6-8). So many places like this just expect you to be ok with sub-par and just take it."}
{"text":"Consistently good if not standard mexican fare. Their chicken is really good. They cook it with tomatoes and onions and it's always seasoned just right.  They have a queso that you can add ground beef to for no extra charge.  Service is always very good and fast.  Monday is dollar taco night. Lunch buffet is ok."}
{"text":"after our meal, my husband posted on Facebook that he was nominating Los Arcos for the best bargain lunch in the USA!   I was looking for a place for lunch on our way to the Charlotte Airport, and this place turned out to be perfect: cheap but tasty food, fast service, only a minute from the exit off I-85. Our entire meal came to just over $10: 2 beers (Tecate and Heinecken were both on special for $1), one plate with refried beans, a beef taco and a chicken enchilada, and the other plate with chicken fajitas and refried beans. The vegetables were fresh and cooked al dente. Our water glasses were kept full by our attentive waitress. Along with our orders came all-you-can-eat chips and salsa (free).  If we lived in the area, we would be here all the time!"}
{"text":"So we were in the moved for Mexican food and never had experienced this restaurant, our go-to spot is normally Don Pedro. So we decided to give it a try. Needless to say we did not stay to order. They did seat us promptly (the parking lot was nearly empty and there was only 2 other tables with guests) and brought us the traditional chips/salsa.  The chips and salsa had me convinced that the food would not be good. The salsa tasted like tomato soup right out of the can. No flavor! No onions, cilantro, green peppers in the dish! I put 2 and 2 together (empty place and nasty salsa) and quickly decided lets go to our regular go-to spot Don Pedro. If you cant make authentic salsa that is an indicator that the food would not be authentic either."}
{"text":"We walked in and it's a very nice place, we get seated right away on a Sunday afternoon even better. When we sit down we weren't given any menus the waitress takes our drinks comes back and then ask if we wanted menus (which no I just planned on ordering random items I could think of)  We got the food which it wasn't too bad but they do need to start using salt so that the food isn't too bland.  All together it's an ok place I will come back and try it again since it's a new place and maybe they will get things fixed.  The only thing that throws me off is the sign and posting in the menu that states in big bold letters that \"they can refuse service to anyone they want\" I mean c'mon now that's just a shame."}
{"text":"This is an update to an earlier review. I recently revisited Los Arcos and didn't have the buffet. The menu item was superb. And the beer special is second to non in the area. The only suggestion that i have is to have fresh homemade salsa instead of jarred salsa. This will elevate the experience and make it a destination restaurant."}
{"text":"I went here on a weekday night. The food was ok, but I felt that the service could have been better. I really don't like it when I go in a place and feel like I'm an inconvenience."}
{"text":"Came in and they sat me at a table, no menu. 4 min later a waitress comes by and asks what she can get me so I say a menu. Duh. I ordered an horchata and the Hawaiian chicken skillet. My plate was not hot. The skillet was no sizzling. The tortillas were lukewarm. The chicken had no flavor at all. The beans and rice were okay but lacked in flavor as well. The pineapple in the skillet is canned which surprised me because I have a hard time understanding why a chef would chose such cheep ingredients. This is not real authentic Mexican food so be warned.  It's safe to say I won't be coming here anymore."}
{"text":"Hey Amigos if you're looking for some tasty Mexican fare then you've found the right spot. This place is really good and such a surprise to find how large of a space it is in person. Apparently Sunday is when you should experience the buffet but watch out for the after church crowds as I hear they tend to be large so it's a busy time. The food is great and the service is too. I found the whole place to be tidy and the quality and price are exceptional. If y'all are in the mood for some good eats then you've found the place!"}
{"text":"I was here for a business trip near IBM center. I was craving Mexican food as always and was staying in the Druery Hotel which is across the street. The food here is absolutely fantastic! As always I order ACP. Now the interesting thing about their recipe is that they put Monterey Jack Cheese on top of the rice and chicken and baked the cheese rather than pour cheese dip on top. Very interesting ! I have to admit it was very good ! I also ordered queso dip with beef (no charge!). My waitress was very friendly and had a nice chat with her. I was totally full after my meal (NO MAS!). Prices were fair . Overall just a great place , friendly staff, excellent but interesting food , what more can you want? I was a little confused why this place wasn't packed because it was 5pm and there wasn't much people there. Hopefully they get business because I will certainly be back when I'm in Charlotte !'"}
{"text":"My new favorite Mexican place!! Amazing food and equally amazing service. Will be going back for sure!"}
{"text":"I usually reserve 5-star ratings for the unusually outstanding and unique experiences. 4 stars means I was pleased, enjoyed my experience more than most and will return enough to become a regular.  This was absolutely a strong 4-star buffet. With any buffet you need to pick and choose between what looks fresh and what looks like it's been sitting there a while.  The staff did a great job replenishing everything and nothing on the buffet seemed \"old.\" It was all very tasty and I would recommend the 7.99 lunch buffet to anyone.  Server and staff were friendly and kept our drinks full without me having to ask. Everything was clean and spills were cleaned up immediately.  I'll be back often."}
{"text":"Two words:  Lunch Buffet!!!  I usually associate buffets with chinese/asian cuisine, but Los Arcos does it up big with their own lunch buffet.    Sadly, I did not partake in the buffet... I ordered off the regular menu which didn't seem overly priced or too big.  Had a Chicken Taco Salad and it was just the right size for my lunch that day.  Have to say, I was a little jealous of the buffet eaters since they seemed to be enjoying each and ever trip back to the buffet.  I believe this site used to be where Max & Erma's was... but they did a complete gut job.  The space is divided with lots of turns and individual booths so no really big open spaces (unless you count the outdoor patio).   The inside still has the \"new paint/construction\" smell and everything has been kept clean and tidy despite the number of people that come in and out on a daily basis.  I'm assuming the buffet is only offered for lunch, but it seems to be quite the popular spot.  One of these days, when I stop running and training for races, I will be a frequent buffet guest here."}
{"text":"Buffet for lunch did not look appealing asked the waiter for a menu he told me to get up and walk around the buffet. We been slammed my water on the table and was extremely rude"}
{"text":"Moving into the area not too long ago, I've been on the hunt of trying to find a good Mexican restaurant.  I read many reviews about this place and about their lunch buffet.  I decided to do that on a random Thursday afternoon.  There weren't many people when I got there, but it quickly got busy within 10 minutes.  The food wasn't too bad for what it was.  Lots of different things to try, which is great.  One thing that would have been nice is if they had signs of what some of the items were.  I'm not sure if they switch things out throughout the day, but it would be nice to know if my enchilada had chicken or beef before grabbing it.  Overall it was decent.  I wouldn't mind coming back again during another random day throughout the week, or even try their Sunday buffet."}
{"text":"Love this place, the buffet stays fresh and is served up on the weekends. It gets crazy busy with the after church crowds on Sunday which make ordering the buffet a little annoying for the anti social folks like me. However, staff is on top of their tables, and when I had my graduation dinner here I got a little lap dance from my waiter so that's what's up. Carnita is my favorite plate here and the queso with beef is to die for! Get yourself a big ass margarita and get happy cuz your in for a treat!"}
{"text":"Muito bom custo-beneficio. Restaurante com excelentes funcionários, barato, com boa comida e funciona em regime self-service. Toda vez que venho a Charlotte eu faço pelo menos uma refeição nesse restaurante."}
{"text":"It is so so so so good! For $8, all you can eat mexican buffet? Heck yeah! They bring you warm chips and salsa and then you can attack the yummy buffet! There are premade items like mini chimichangas, taquitos, quesadilla, enchiladas etc, then there are entrees like creamed chicken, pork, shrimp etc. And then the taco bar!!!!!!! With beef, cheese, sour cream, fresh guacamole, pico de gallo and other toppings. They also have fresh fruit and a couple of sweet items like rice pudding and fried plantains. What's not to like? It's so great! This is my new favorite lunch place! It's not gourmet, just really good mexican lunch food and I am in love!  Update: ok it's not as good as I remembered the first time. The food is low quality. After eating here a few times I have had my fill and get sick at the thought of going back."}
{"text":"If you like cheap, Americanized Mexican food, look no further.  The food is good and the staff is polite and welcoming.  The beer menu suffers quite a bit (the typical Mexican and American macros) especially to be in a city with some really good brews at your fingertips.  The chips and salsa are tasty.  Next time we go, we will have to check out the buffet.  Sounds interesting."}
{"text":"We were in the area and was craving mexican food and we decided to come here. We came in for a late lunch so we missed the buffet. We got sat right away and had excellent service. I ordered two enchiladas with a taco and rice and my husband got a burrito, enchilada and a tostada. We asked for a hotter salsa and she gave us a squeeze bottle of it which was a huge plus. Both salsas were good but we liked them mixed together.   One thing that I was really impressed was how insanely clean the restaurant was. They had a sanitation rating of 99. The bathroom was spotless and I can see workers cleaning the towels and the buffet.   We want to come here again next time we are in the area and try the buffet!"}
{"text":"The food is good but service is absolutely the worst on the majority of occasions. The servers never smile or act as if they want to work for a tip. You're supposed to get three free baskets of chips and they will short you on chips as your baskets go on. They forget about their tables and prolong the whole time and I've had to go in the kitchens on many occasions to tell them \"hey I need...\" or \"hey could you come here.\""}
{"text":"A Mexican buffet place. Genius.   Great place for lunch. You can get in and out very quickly and the food is fresh and you can control the portion.   I am always hesitant to go to a Mexican place because the portion is always too much. And who needs lunch coma?  If you are in the area and want some mexican food, you should come here. Plenty to choose from the buffet line and it does not dissapoint."}
{"text":"Los arcos is good. Not the best but good. Carne asada is excellent. Wasn't happy that they charge me 75 cent for sour cream for tacos but the location is usually pretty clean and the service is good."}
{"text":"Disgusting  Horrible  The furthest from Real tacos  The waitress this little cutie was a stupid as could be I asked for corn tortillas  Fish tacos cost us more  I said ok She came back with crappie Smelly flour tortillas then tried to convince me they  were white corn  Uh duh I'm not some dumb redneck who thinks Taco Bell is gastronomy exotica   It was a pitstop on a very long drive from NYC to Atlanta Yikes don't stop here unless you like rat taco"}
{"text":"Visited the one on JW Clay Sunday, they always have the best and (strongest) Margaritas anywhere. The buffet was good with lot's of choices and all very fresh. I miss the old Los Arcos location but this one is brighter and better selection. Phillepe is awesome and I congratulate him on his new arrival. Awesome food, drinks, and always fresh."}
{"text":"Food was average Americanized Mexican.  Service was very good and quick.  The chicken burritos were okay could have had more flavor.  The cheese dip was very good.  I would repeat if I were in the area and wanted Mexican Food."}
{"text":"I only stopped in for a light dessert because the last restaurant that I had eaten dinner at only had heavy cakes or cheesecakes and I wanted something much lighter. I stopped into Los Arcos just to have dessert and have the salon. It was very good but they probably just don't have high turnover to keep the quality consistent. But my service was amazing and the staff was very friendly!"}
{"text":"We picked this place, only because we had a coupon for one free entree. When we looked at the menu, we decided not to even use the coupon because they had so many other menu items to offer. We were greeted by a friendly host and he immediately showed us to our seats. The bathrooms were extremely clean and well-maintained. Our waitress was less than impressive. I ordered the shrimp fajitas but forgot to mention that I didn't want peppers. As she walked into the kitchen, I remembered and waited for her to come back out before asking for no peppers. When I made the request, she didn't bother to respond or say anything, she simply rolled her eyes and walked off. I asked my husband if I was imagining things and he noticed as well that her body language was rather dismissive from that point on. The food had great flavor but the drinks were way too sweet. I would recommend this restaurant, I'm hoping the waitress was simply having a long day. The prices are reasonable and the atmosphere is relaxed."}
{"text":"Food has no seasonings whatsoever! The people that eat here love quantity over quality or have no taste buds...If you like slop you will be right at home!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the service was excellent. I really enjoyed my dinner here. I had the shrimp chimichanga and let me tell you... magnificent! If you're in the area, definitely check this place out. I think this will be my new go-to place for Mexican food here in the University area."}
{"text":"Board of health rating is a 92.  Too low considering how easy it is to bring this number up.  Yelp needs to display this number on the front page.  I walked right out with my family once I saw the number.  Thank NC board of health!"}
{"text":"By far my Favorite Mexican restaurant in Charlotte! Being raised here and having been to many of the places to eat here that's a big compliment. This place is always clean, friendly, and fast with service! You have to try the buffet which is always hot, full, and delicious. The good here is fresh, the staff is friendly and the atmosphere is so relaxing. The buffet is extremely affordable (under $8) b/w 11-3pm and great options for all. I'm a vegetarian and I love it! I used to go here everyday before I moved to Cali and I'd always request Sylvia! She's a sweetheart and very sufficient. This place is a must go, whether with a group, family, friends, or alone."}
{"text":"Service was fine but food is inedible!  Real Mexican food is NOT made with processed cheese food! It's made with real cheese. Just gross"}
{"text":"We went to the Panthers game and stayed near this location. The food was great the restaurant was nice and clean the staff was very friendly BUT due to there being a lack of understanding English  (smh) made it ruff! He brung the wrong drinks food cuttery instead of napkins water instead of drinks from the bar ect.... but the food was GOOD!"}
{"text":"Love, love,love this place... lunch buffet is on point! Staff is very friendly. Took my husband for the first time today and he absolutely enjoyed himself! Truly a hidden treasure"}
{"text":"I used to go to this restaurant when it was at Akers center. I went there this afternoon for lunch and I was very disappointed. The restaurant was dirty. There was trash all over the floors. The food was only mediocre. Nothing to brag about. The only good thing about our whole experience was our waiter. He was nice and helpful and kept our drink glass filled. Needless to say, I won't be going back there."}
{"text":"Los Arcos is a solid Mexican restaurant. It is located behind Taco Bell (kind of ironic). The restaurant inside is pretty big. I'm not sure if they built this building specifically for Los Arcos or if it was an existing structure, but if it was already there, they did  a great job renovating. They have a chevron pattern floor - anyone else obsessed with the current chevron craze???    We got the cheese dip to start, which was big for $4.50! I got a combination plate of 2 tacos and rice and beans. Everything has that signature Mexican restaurant flavor. My roommate ended up getting deep fried butterfly shrimp (weird for a Mexican restaurant but that's what she wanted when she saw it on the menu). I think they were frozen out of a box. She enjoyed them though. Overall the food was what we were expecting. Nothing bad but nothing special. It is a great place to hit up when that Mexican craving hits.   While there, I saw that they have a buffet Monday through Saturday for lunch. I will definitely be going back to check it out! I also will have to check out their margaritas and update my review!"}
{"text":"Based on my carnitas dish alone this place should be a five star.   The restaurant itself is very inviting and roomy and comfortable. We munched on chips and salsas while we ordered our food and waited for it to arrive. Delicioso! Our waitress was very nice and friendly. The menu itself is very affordable with many different, classic options.  I went with Carnitas and the man went with enchiladas. As far as taste, they were both spot on. My plate was so huge, there was no way I could eat it all. I was able to share my food and still have plenty to take home.   Sadly,we ordered the queso fundo dip with chorizo for an appetizer and it was so disgusting. I have had this previously in other places but I was appalled at the taste. We did not finish it.  The kid menu is okay. Not the best but still kid friendly.  We definitely will come back."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to drop in this authentic Mexican restaurant. Noticed that the buffet is only during lunch time. My wife ordered the enchilada supreme and I ordered the Hawaiian fajitas and bean taco. Requested NO CHEESE but the waiter brought my first order WITH CHEESE. I don't understand why people don't write down orders anymore. Makes life and your tip better. In the end, both of us left very satisfied."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years. The price has gone up a bit over time but it continues to have excellent food. They have lunch specials (i recommend a lunch #1) and some days a buffet. AWESOME CHIMICHANGAS!"}
{"text":"Great area! They have outside sitting and inside. Relaxing and good service. The food was amazing as well. I also had a drannnk. And it was very good. I heard they have a lunch buffet. I'd love to try that. I would recommend if your in the area."}
