{"text":"Worst dining experience ever! We waited for our food for 2 hours with no explanation of why it was taking so long. There was not a manager in sight the entire time either. We finally got too hungry and asked to pay for our drinks and left to go to paninis next door."}
{"text":"Cucumber infused water is a good way to start. Fast service. Teri Don was good but a bit on the bland side. Overall pretty good"}
{"text":"Had some time to before meeting some others so headed into Kent to try out Newdle. It was a Friday evening and the place was about 1/3 full. The place has eclectic decor... a strange mix of stuff. It's kind of cavernous, and surprisingly loud with relatively few diners. The bar is large but kind of weak. The sushi prep area is awkwardly stuck in a corner and the selection of draft beers is limited. I was surprised the did not carry Kirin beer at all.   I ordered sashimi and it was very good. Watching the chefs prepare various rolls in the corner wasn't awe inspiring, but it easily ranks as the best I've had in the Kent area.  Bottom line, the food quality is good, the atmosphere and presentation is weak. I will definitely be back when the craving for futomaki hits, but with realistic expectations regarding the dining experience."}
{"text":"So, I visited here for the first time two nights ago because I wanted to treat myself after a stressful/productive week and because their menu looks interesting. Also, it was a Tuesday night and they incidentally had half-off sushi.  It was fairly active for a Tuesday night, but there was still ample seating. Others have already described the inside decor and atmosphere accurately, so I won't get into that very much. It's a restaurant that serves Asian food but has a very Western style to it. Like Zakir said. I don't really care for it, but it's nothing I'd tick points off for. For soothing/ethereal/traditional Asian restaurant experiences there is Wild Papaya just down the road, SO!  So I sat at the sushi bar and ordered the spicy scallop maki. First off, their 1/2 sushi Tuesday night deal applies to their 6-piece maki only, not their 10-piece specialty rolls. A little off putting, sure, but whatevs. They actually have a menu that draws attention away from the sushi (although some of their rolls do look appetizing). I also ordered the bibimbap, since someone else here described it and it sounds very tasty. And it is.  The sushi came out almost immediately. I know it's not futomaki (larger rolls) and it was half-off sushi that night, but the pieces were really small... I mean, I admit they are even labelled as such on the menu and all but still... I don't know if I've just been conditioned by other sushi restaurants to expect larger rolls and that skinny maki is actually closer to what's \"traditional\" but it was nevertheless off-putting... at any rate, I would definitely not pay full price for it under normal circumstances.  Literally as soon as I finished my last piece the bibimbap came out. It is served with  a small side dish of a spicy chili sauce, which I applied in liberal amounts. Should I even describe it? It' a medley of rice, vegetables, protein (choose chicken/tofu/pork) and a fried egg on top. You mix it all up, and it's amazing. The runny egg yolk also makes it very good. I love trying new things, and there really isn't anything I can compare this dish to. It was extremely good!  I surprised myself and got dessert, as well. They offer chocolate cake (standard fare, right?) and \"midori cheesecake.\" I ordered the midori cheesecake, which is simply cheesecake with midori liqueur drizzled on top and pooled at the bottom. I still can't get it out of my head, it was that tasty. :) Granted, the midori was kind of strong.  Oh, right. About that! One of the bartenders (Rob was his name) that wasn't even waiting on me asked me how the cheesecake was, and all I did was remark that it was a little strong. Not a big deal to me, though (I'm pretty chillax towards most things). So I was surprised when he came back a few minutes later to tell me that he gave me half off on the cheesecake by way of apology. I was genuinely surprised and touched and impressed. The midori being strong wasn't even a mistake they made, it was really my fault for not being that familiar with the drink. More power to them, though.  I don't expect any business to be perfect, and I know wherever people are working there will be mistakes. That's just life, and it doesn't upset me greatly when something does go awry. What I do care about is how mistakes are handled. Do you blame someone else? Try and cover it up? Do you learn from it and do better next time? Do you fix it and make amends? The latter case is what impresses me the most, and in the case with Newdle Bar no mistake was even made on part of the employees, but they took my offhand remark seriously and surprised me.  Anyway, the staff (both the girl serving me and Rob alike) were very friendly, so all is good in that area.  AAAA+++++++ would do business with again yes yes  But really, I can't wait to come back here. I'm still looking forward to trying their ramen (I've only had the college budget kind... you know, the kind you microwave), twice cooked fried rice,  and"}
{"text":"Horribly overpriced and the sushi is the tinniest thing I've ever seen. The sushi is under flavored because of this. Definitely needs to change before I'll go back. PS not all sushi is wrapped inside of a seaweed wrap....put some rice on the outside for once."}
{"text":"I go there all the time . I really like their food. However, I called in at 9:40 Tuesday 9-16-14. The lady I spoke with on the phone was obviously annoyed that she was getting a call 20 minutes before they close. I asked if I could place a to go order and she told me no and that the kitchen was closed.... The kitchen didn't close until 10. I know it's annoying to get orders close to close but in a business, you are open right up until you close. This really upset me. Hopefully the owner sees this and knows that he lost 3 customers trying to go to his restaurant for dinner."}
{"text":"I love this place. It can be a little pricy. But try bi bim bap and tofu nabe, you won't regret it!! I sometimes order sushi but usually a bi bim bap makes me feel full. Plus they give you cucumber water too. Who doesn't love cucumber water?! :)"}
{"text":"We went there and had a few basic rolls and one fancy one. The $14.00 roll had the thinnest piece of salmon I have ever seen on sushi, both on top and inside. I have eaten great sushi all over the world, including Japan and, even at inexpensive sushi places, I've never seen it this thin. In addition, the roll had a ton of rice; the rice thickness was the same as the items inside the roll.   My wife got a Philli roll and she had more salmon in her $6 roll than I had on mine.    To make the entire thing worse and really earn the 1 star rating, when I told our waiter, he said there was no manager to talk to, then defended the roll saying that is how they always make them. I asked him to take that roll of the bill and he refused. Won't be coming back here again!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time for sushi. The sushi menu is limited and the wait person was not well versed in selections, suggesting squid when I asked for octopus. But no mind.  The unagi was very good; the yellow tail and tuna were ok, too.  I think the rice could be improved a bit; it tended to fall apart easily.  Servings seem generous.  I did not order from the much larger menu, but I will go back and try again.  I'm a real sushi lover, and it was disappointing to have such a small selection.  But that's understandable; I can't image Kent is a thriving haven for sushi lovers."}
{"text":"This was a great place for lunch!  We came just as they were closing, and even though one waitress tersely told us to leave, another graciously let us come on in and served us with a smile.   The food was really good! I loved the bi bim bap and the sushi.   If I lived closer I'd definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Portions suck here which is why it's hard to justify going back or giving it a good rating."}
{"text":"Went a few months ago after graduation with a friend.  We are huge sushi fans, so when I remembered that Kent had opened up a sushi restaurant, we were excited.  We each got a simple salad with ginger dressing - had just enough dressing that it was overpowerful! Ordered six piece spicy scallop roll and the ramen noodles in a soy broth, and man I am so sad that I now live in Cleveland, because I crave it every day!  The server was fantastic and the rest of the staff was very nice. I always stop at Newdle Bar now whenever I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Newdle Bar is having an identity crisis. It is a traditional Asian restaurant that is also trying to be a cool, hip bar hangout for college students? Doesn't mix well, and the interior design reflects that. Bright walls with pictures of the Beatles and graffiti art paired with classical Asian touches. Very awkward.   Food was slightly above average. I ordered the chicken ramen with soy sauce. Didn't try the sushi because I heard terrible things.The lady taking my order was very rude and she didn't even offer me a glass of water, had to ask her."}
{"text":"The worst sushi I have ever had. It was warm, super fishy and off color. I had two bites and left the rest. We left and went somewhere else to eat dinner but was so turned off by the sushi I couldn't eat anything else. It was terrible. Save your time, money and stomach."}
{"text":"Food is beautiful but rice has been undercooked a couple of times. Service is okay.  Almost everything has been really delicious. They never seem busy."}
{"text":"Went here with my girlfriend hoping to have some quality sushi. We were disappointed and not impressed. It was over priced and the sushi wasn't that good of quality if you're use to Cilantro or Hunan palace style of sushi. We got two drinks one called a \" Tokyo tea\" and the other \"long beach\" they were God awful.   We had good service and the miso soup was good. That's about it. Also I got a margarita and it was terrible I didn't think you could mess one up."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible service. The restaurant  was mostly empty, but it still took 15 minutes to place an order. The food we got wasn't correct, and took forever as well.   There is better Asian cuisine in kent, do not recommend."}
{"text":"Ramen with chicken is delicious. Simple dish with lots of flavor. Servers are nice too. Half price on Thursday's, can't beat it."}
{"text":"We went to Newdle Bar in the middle of a Friday night.  They had 6 - 8 tables but weren't real busy.  I had heard about this place and wanted to check it out.  I found the decor to be underwhelming.  The pop art on the wall seemed irritating.  The tables were low end, and the painted concrete floor was unkempt.  The bar lacked any design or character.    We ordered a variety of food.  The ramen and udon noodle soups were very bland.  The bi bim bap was not close to being authentic.  The sushi was ok but a little dry.  For the price points,  I expected better quality food.    On the plus side,  the service was good."}
{"text":"15 minutes into it, still no menu or water. First time here, not so good. Food didn't have much flavor. If you are here for the sports bar feel plus the beer then you are at the right place. However, if you are craving for good yummy food, this is not the right place (expensive and not tasty)"}
{"text":"My date and I ordered Tokyo Breeze sushi, sunomono salad, and gyoza fried dumplings. The food was plated beautifully in decent portion sizes. We enjoy many types of international cuisine, but aren't familiar with Japanese food. The dishes tasted good, and the dumplings seemed authentic (comparable to authentic Chinese dumplings). The waitress was fine, and brought our food at a reasonable amount of time considering how many customers were in the restaurant. I recommend the Newdle Bar."}
{"text":"Yikes, I really wanted to like this place because sushi in downtown Kent? I give one extra star for daring to put any sort of Asian Fusion place in Kent.  I ordered water to drink, edamame, a spicy tuna roll and a roll with shrimp tempura/avocado. My friend ordered ramen and a soft drink. Her drink was entirely flat. My water tasted odd, I wonder if the recent construction in Kent affected it. The edamame had a spice on it that was quite good, but was overcooked so it was challenging to eat without mushing apart the bean casings. When the sushi came out my heart sank.  The presentation was abysmal; the seaweed didn't even go all the way around the rolls and the construction was messy, the rolls were falling apart when I picked them up with chopsticks. The avocado in my shrimp roll was visibly browned and old. My tuna, instead of being a healthy shade of pinky red that shows it's fresh, was an odd shade of too bright translucent pink like pepto bismal.   And that's even before the experience of eating. This sushi was awful, folks. The seaweed was incredibly chewy, how did they even achieve that? The tempura shrimp wasn't even crispy, it was clear they fried it earlier with some batter not even resembling tempura, then must have popped it in the microwave. As I said before, the avocado was old and tasted a bit off. The spicy tuna tasted like nothing (no spice) and there was some bizarre sauce on it that looked like they had squirted soy sauce. I think others put pictures up of it, you can see the effect if you want to scroll through above. It was worse than gas station sushi, I'm not messing around. I ate it because I was very hungry and I paid $6 per roll. I didn't think it was worth bringing up to the waiter because if a restaurant is willing to serve old and browned avocado in their sushi, there is not much pride there in the first place.  My advice to this establishment...taste your own sushi. Then taste some sushi available in Akron (e.g. Sakura Sushi). Either get some fresh ingredients and up your quality, or take this off the menu and focus on noodles."}
{"text":"We're pretty disappointed. This restaurant is no WagaMama's! (We've been there and this is not it). The noodles were okay, not nearly enough vegetables, and there was hair in the soup. We'll give them the pass on the very slow service since it was their first weekend open...but the number of TV's is absurd. There's nowhere to sit without a TV in your face. On top of that the acoustics are poor, there was loud music in the background, and it was hard to hear oneself think, much less talk. I know they're going for \"trendy\", but does \"trendy\" need to mean loud?  edited 5-5-14 -- Nothing seems to have changed with service and noise. And, they STILL don't have rice noodles for gluten free folks. We won't be going here again."}
{"text":"So overall, this place is pretty good. So far, the service has been acceptable, the food is good, and there's really no crowd or noise. I recommend the Firecracker or Vegetarian sushi or the Yakisoba noodles."}
{"text":"Meh...don't come here if you are looking for authentic ramen. This is more of a fusion version of ramen. The broth lacked depth in flavor.  My husband had the pork ramen and I had the chicken ramen, no real difference in flavor other than the protein. After reading the prior reviews we avoided the sushi.    Our service was ok, not very attentive but not completely aloof either.   The restaurant appeared run down and in need of cosmetic repair, though clean.     Overall, this establishment was not impressive and I wouldn't seek it out. Lack luster."}
{"text":"This was the worst sushi I have had, honestly buffet sushi is less of a let down, because I know what I'm paying for. The fish was too warm, the rice was hard, and the seaweed was stale. Not to mention the waiter got my order completely wrong the first time and I had to wait while my friends all laughed at me. The miso soup tastes like teriyaki sauce and onions. Booo!"}
{"text":"Finally done trying with this place. Despite being told by friends it wasn't worth it, I tried it twice. First time I got the chicken nabe. Before ordering, I asked if they had thin noodles (like rice noodles) because I had just had my wisdom teeth taken out - forgot to substitute the noodles and also waited 45 minutes for ONE drink. If you plan to come here, expect 45 minutes or more for an appetizer and don't count on refills of water. Second time was take out. I ordered yakisoba broth noodles with tofu. No tofu was added and it was a teriyaki sauce. Not sure what else to say about this place except that you should save yourself some money and go to one of the many better Asian restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Tried Newdle Bar for the first time tonight and enjoyed it! I ordered the Double Fried Rice with shrimp. I was a little thrown off by the shrimp still having their shells, but nonetheless still delicious!"}
{"text":"I was initially impressed with the servers menu knowledge.  Trying to find a vegetarian egg free item on this menu is very difficult.  The server suggested the bibimbop and it came with a fried egg right on top.  Unfortunately it was 90% rice after I picked that off with some sliced lettuce and sesame seeds on plain tofu.  I was not impressed.  My wife ordered some spider rolls and she said they were excellent.    I might try them again if they get some better veggie options.  I can make three cups of rice at home."}
{"text":"My friends and i love going to Newdle Bar on Tuesday's because they have half price sushi but we always make sure we have plenty of time to go because they are very slow to get your food to you because of how \"busy\" they are. Pretty average sushi, not my favorite, but it's a fun environment!"}
{"text":"Really enjoy their sushi.  Eaten here a number of times, always tasty and well formed... sit at the bar and they make it right in front of you.    Have had the fried rice... big serving!  If there are 2-3 of you get sushi (etc) and order one fried rice and share it.    Last visit, my wIfe got the teri-don.  Very tasty indeed!  It was more than plenty for her, and I had my share of it too (along with my sushi) and we did not finish it.  I've never been there in the evening, but during the late lunch period I have never had long wait.  Nice atmosphere, on street parking.  Next to Insomnia Cookies to top things off with a sweet!"}
{"text":"After hearing mixed reviews from friends, I visited Newdle Bar for lunch with a couple of co-workers, and was pleasantly surprised. The decor is modern and simple, which is completely ruined by the half-dozen LCD TVs strewn about the establishment (what is with the compulsion that restaurateurs have with cramming as many obnoxious TVs as possible into their dining rooms? It amounts to nothing more than a distraction to your patrons!), but, this is supposed to be about the food... I ordered Bibimbap with braised pork, a Korean mixed rice dish. The dish consists of a bowl of white rice, lettuce, veggies, all topped with a fried egg. A spice Korean \"barbecue sauce\" is served on the side. The server instructed me to top the bowl with the sauce and mix it all up, which is the traditional method of preparation.  I must say, the flavors were spot on, and most of the components were perfectly cooked. The steamed rice had the perfect texture, and there was great juxtaposition of textures between the gently cooked veggies and crunchy lettuce. The soft egg yolk added a richness and helped to bind the other ingredients. The pork, however, was a bit dry, but was well seasoned (the dish can be served with tofu or chicken instead of pork).  Overall, this dish was well prepared and delicious, although a little pricey ($9.50). The other four people in my party had only good things to say about their futomaki sushi rolls and noodle dishes, so it was a pleasant experience for everyone.  Of course, a restaurant can't be judged by one dish (or one dining experience), so I will be back to see what the rest of their menu offers!"}
{"text":"Came here with a friend for dinner. Neither of us had been here before. We liked the atmosphere - it was eclectic and inviting. The waitstaff was very nice. Our server was named Isabella and she was amazing! Very on top of refills, very attentive, very friendly. I got the twice fried rice with grilled shrimp and a Philadelphia roll, my friend got ramen with tempura vegetables and shrimp and a gomoku roll. We also each had a bowl of miso soup. Everything I had tasted great, I thought the sushi was a overpriced but the prices on the miso soup and ramen and fried rice was very reasonable and the portions were generous. I would definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"Really good sushi. Really good ramen. Really good bi bim bap. Very bright on the inside and good location. However, horrible tacky design and bad decoration. Also never understood why restaurants play CNN (or any news) on TV's in the restaurant... which this one does. Great food though and fast service! Highly recommend. Best Asian food in Kent Ohio"}
{"text":"I love this place brought my mom here now and she loves their ramen with miso it is pretty tasty. Love their tuesday sushi specials. Totally enjoy Bi Bim Bap... except veges cut too thick for my liking but besides that enjoyable always get with pork and tofu delicious. We have been here multiple times ... its great!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Newdle Bar regularly for a few months now. The serving staff are extremely polite, capable, and fun to talk to. The food always leaves my friends and I full and happy. The atmosphere there is modern but with a touch of nostalgia and I don't mind having business meetings there (especially compared to a lot of other businesses who keep their music up way too loud). I'd recommend Newdle Bar for anything ranging from a first date to a fun night out in Kent with friends. I've even been a part of their new Saturday night dance party, which was a lot of fun, even for a guy who can't dance."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi, noodles and drinks. Funky atmosphere but amazing food. The fried  and steamed dumplings were cooked perfectly and they came with a spicy soy sauce. Wednesday is $5 martinis too. $$/5 I will be coming back for sure!!! A real gem in Kent."}
{"text":"Food tastes good, but be prepared to sacrifice service and accuracy. We only come back occasionally because some of the food is creative and good. Constantly forgetting take-out items (2 forgotten tonight alone), you have flag waitresses down, waiting for a hilariously long time to start your check. So, if you are willing to give it rip in spite of these things, you'll like the food. It just might take a couple of tries and a few hours for them to get it right."}
{"text":"I'm not usually picky with my sushi, but I've had grocery store sushi far better than this place. It was the most Americanized sushi i've ever had, and it was not good at all. It was bland and overpriced for the quality of the food. I don't recommend it, although the people there were nice. If you're looking for good sushi, don't go here."}
{"text":"I'm from California and wanted to try Ohio sushi.  The place is excellent!  The food is fresh, the service, impeccable,  especially Kyle, our server.  He was wonderful to all our requests and questions.  He is extremely pleasant and friendly.  I hope to come to come back here again some day."}
{"text":"The sushi is fantastic! Love the cucumber water they complimentary serve. Nice sit down restaurant with a decent size bar. Tuesdays are half off sushi which is amazing"}
{"text":"I guess I should start by saying that I love sushi, and that I really wanted to like this place. After eating here, I can say that I still love sushi, and that this now ranks as the worst sushi Ive ever had.  When I walked in the door, the first impression I got was that this place was trying to be an urban/modern/hipster/artistic bar/sushi bar. It was too much. It felt like 3 decorators were given a handful of pills and a free hand.  The service was terrible. There was a girl there who was going from table to table, refilling drinks, cleaning, and hustling. Why couldn't we have gotten her??? Our guy just seemed totally uninterested, and wasnt doing half as much as his coworker. The manager was behind the bar for a good amount of time, but didnt seem to be doing much other than refilling water pitchers. You'd think he could have greeted customers. As far as the food goes, the better half got a fried rice dish. The first thing I thought when they brought it out was \"wow....fried rice shouldn't look ....wet.\" She had the same sentiments. I got a roll, which was WAY too heavy on the rice which, in my case, was far too dry. There was barely any filling in the roll, and the fish on top wasn't anything impressive. PS: whoever thought it would be a good idea to use smoked salmon on a rainbow roll was nuts - stick with fresh. Or raw/frozen. Or whatever you use there.  Overall, this place offers below average food with below average service at acceptably high prices. My guess is that the location may keep it in business, which is a shame. If you want good sushi at realistic prices, leave kent and drive a few minutes. Sakura and Otani are my suggestions."}
{"text":"I came here a couple months ago for my birthday. I've always heard people talking about this place, so I decided to come check it out for myself. Honestly it was better than I expected! I love Asian food and although their food is not super authentic (spinach in the miso soup instead of seaweed), it did not disappoint. I got the miso soup as a starter, tofu yakisoba, the Wellington sushi roll as well as the California roll. I often find myself daydreaming about the Wellington roll it was so good - it had cooked salmon and avocado. The only bad was the yakisoba noodles could have been hotter when it came out and the drink I had tasted very watered down I couldn't finish it. Overall though, I will definitely be coming here again and keep this place in mind as a good vegetarian option."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited for the first time one week after opening.  Ambiance - We sat near the back of the restaurant (next to where the band would set up if they happened to have one playing) and didn't notice an overwhelming amount of noise, nor did we feel the televisions were obtrusive at all.  Since this is a combination bar and restaurant in a college town, I might not choose to visit after, say, 9 PM on a weekend, but that's true of any bar/restaurant in a college town since I'm a fuddy duddy.  Service - Our server was very attentive and informative, and food and drinks appeared in a reasonable amount of time.  Food - We both started with the ginger miso soup, which was good.  My husband had a salmon dish, which he found to be perfectly cooked and delicious (he claimed it was buttery in a positive way, but didn't think the dish actually contained butter).  I had the bibimbap, which was exactly what I wanted (and had been craving -- finally!  Somewhere nearby I can hit for bibimbap!), and was well-executed.  Given the wide array of menu options, if I were looking for specific flavors (and didn't know which dishes traditionally have those flavors), I'd probably ask my server for suggestions.  Drinks - The beer list is solid, the wine list is fair, and they have a full bar (obviously).  The water is cucumber-infused, which is a nice touch.    All in, we were very happy with Newdle Bar and will definitely be back repeatedly.  I'm looking forward to trying a variety of items from the menu.  Is this the best restaurant ever in the entire world?  Well...no, but it's an solid, reasonably-priced option for tasty Asian food in a college town in the Midwest."}
{"text":"We had been down from Cleveland visiting friends in the area. They suggested NB for dinner and we love sushi and ramen. Our total group was four adults, two children.   Overall the experience was good, not great. The speed of service from the staff/kitchen was excellent, but the food was tasty yet not amazing. Also, every time the door opened the front 1/3rd of the room got excessively cold.   Our sushi was only mediocre quality when compared with other similarly priced venues in the area. However the specialty dishes made up for that. I had a squid salad that was in a delectable vinaigrette. And my wife's udon noodle entree had a tangy broth that was very tasty though the noodles a bit mushy. Our friends entrees were also adequate, sushi for her, and ramen with meat for him.   In retrospect it seemed those who ordered a noodle dish were more impressed with their meal than those who got sushi. So my suggestion is get something other than sushi for a high quality experience. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Another one of my favorite places in Kent for some nice Japanese cuisine. Authentic and delicious. Nothing more to say!!"}
{"text":"As a former frequent customer of Newdle Bar, it makes me both happy and sad to say that I will never be visiting this restaurant again. And I've given it plenty of chances. Of all of the times I've been here, there's only been a handful of times that my food hasn't come out wrong, the service hasn't been slow or horrible, or our server was actually in a position to be located. As a server myself, I can attest to the fact that the service I had last night was despicable. Our server forgot her pen, \"memorized\" or order, and it came out completely wrong. Since my friend and I were not surprised, we handled the situation nicely. We just asked for a complimentary dessert to make up for the server's mistake after she admitted to putting in the order wrong; in her exact words, \"Oh sh**, I put in the wrong meal!\". She even promised us 50% off of our meals, to which we decided a dessert would be fine instead. After 20 minutes of waiting for our dessert, a manager (who I've seen there all the time) came over to our table and told us that she couldn't do anything about the food because \"we ate it\". To our defense, we only ate the meal because it took over 30 minutes for us to get the meal in the first place, so there was no way we were waiting another 30 minutes for another plate. She didn't ask us what happened, she didn't apologize; she basically told us we were wrong, and that the mistake wouldn't be compensated for. Our server then took over 30 minutes again just to bring us split checks and to process them, and never apologized for the mistake she admitted to making.   If you are looking for good service, come here on a quiet weekday at lunch, and even then you are taking a risk. The noodles are great and the sushi is mediocre, but there are PLENTY of other better places in the area. I like Phoenix Express, its a few miles away in Stow."}
{"text":"I had the Tofu Nabe and it was delicious. With my lunchI had a peach margarita which isn't the type of thing I would usually drink but Im a fan of peach so I wanted to try it and it also was great. A+ on the food.   Now the negative... the service time, and service generally were beyond bad. My dining companion NEVER got her food and despite asking for water refills twice NEVER received them. Finally she asked them to put her food in a to go container cause we had already been there 35 minutes and I was almost done the waiter played on his phone instead of doing that and then used his bare hands (unwashed) to put the sushi in a to go container. She asked them to take it off the bill, and they did.    My dining companion complained and another member of the waitstaff came over to apologize for the waiter claiming it was his first day. She comped some things for us and was very nice. I'm not going to hold a grudge and I will try it again because it seems like a great place food wise but the waiter we had must not have only never waited tables before he must never have had a job or been inside a restaurant, even as a customer. It was amazing when even after my dining companion complained he was on his phone... in full view of the dining room."}
{"text":"I love noodles. I am not the biggest Sushi fan, and can't really compare theirs to other places. I can say they have a dedicated sushi chef working behind the sushi bar (not out of the kitchen). Take from that what you may.  I haven't ordered a cocktail here, but they do have a full bar and seem to have a good choice of spirits quality-wise.   What I love are the noodles. This is as close as such a small place like Kent can get to  a Jon Sawyer (Cleveland Japanese noodle restaurants) place, and its great. I love their Ramen and Nabe both. Served in nice earthenware vessels for their soups. They offer takeout, and it always stays hot. They wrap their containers in plastic wrap. Unlike some (bad) takeout, they always include plasticware too.  Prices are MORE than fair for the noodles, and its always good.  I usually order takeout, but they do have a full dining room. Its kind of cramped and is very casual. I don't mind eating in for sure, but it doesn't have a full-service restaurant atmosphere."}
{"text":"I have only been once, and I thought it was pretty tasty. I got one of the ramen chicken bowls"}
{"text":"First time to this noodle shop.  Pretty much Japanese style noodle dishes and sushi.  Don't go expecting to get any thai noodle dishes.     Liked the open, modern look of the place.  Food was good, but it was lacking something that I can't put my tastebuds on.  I got the noodle bowl - nabeyaki udon dish.  Thick noodles in a light broth with a piece (1) tempura shrimp, a single fish cake, an egg and some vegetables.  Good, but not the best that I've had.   Nice wait staff.  We arrived before 4:30 and we were the only people there so we got all the attention and by 5:30 the place was packed.   Would I go again.. yep, and will try another dish."}
{"text":"I LOVE Newdle Bar. All of their rice bowls are delicious and their ramen is pretty good too. Their sushi used to be kind of a rip off... small, way too much rice, not a lot of meat... but recently they've changed that. They also have great cocktails."}
{"text":"I will start by saying the service was FANTASTIC! I will also say that if you are an entitled brat and enjoy being changed $10.50 for a Titos and tonic then this is the place for you. Way over priced food that isn't that great. And drinks that could pay off the country's debt within one sitting. Good job Newdle Bar for being \"that\" restraunt."}
{"text":"We could tell that the sushi wasn't fresh just by looking at it but we paid for it, so gave it a try. Spicy tuna was terrible. Crab salad was all mayo. The seaweed didn't wrap around the entire roll so they fell apart. Summer rolls weren't wrapped properly so they completely fell apart when you tried to pick them up. Miso soup was the best part but it came in a huge bowl ... luckily that filled me up because we didn't eat much of the sushi."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for Newdle Bar; I really did. I am a huge fan of the elevated noodlehouse concept that has become quite hip lately, but I found their noodle dishes to be relatively bland. The service was also extremely slow, and the timing was all off. One of us got and finished his dish about an hour before the rest of the food came.   Not all was bad though. My fried octopus appetizer was great!"}
{"text":"In our several visits the various noodle dishes have been excellent.  We had the same server on more than one occasion who is very attentive and personable. We are not big sushi fans but have tried some on occasion and it was quite good.  Atmosphere is relaxed with multiple TVs for viewing if you do desire. We will be back for more noodles for sure."}
{"text":"We had the best birthday dinner for our 10 year old last night. Our waitress was phenomenal and made excellent suggestions for dinner and drinks. My husband had the bento box with udon noodle bowl and steak, new addition.  It was fresh and delicious. Our 10 year old had the anniversary sushi roll and my 12 year old had the Golden Flashes sushi roll.  Both were excellent.  The food is amazing and such a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"It was a Saturday in night and it was packed everywhere I else, so I decided to try Newdle Bar.  We were seated immediately...the atmosphere is trendy and cool.  I ordered the Tori Karaage and it was delicious.  It came with miso soup, brown rice, and salad.  I wasn't a fan of the miso soup, but the ginger dressing for the salad was good.  I ordered a bubble tea and the waitress had to come back twice because she was unsure if they had the favors.  The bad part of this place was the service, our waitress wasn't there for refills or to check on us.  Another thing is the music was loud to the point where I couldn't hear the person across from me.  Overall the food is very good and I will be back, it was just the service that needs some tweaking."}
{"text":"Newdle bar is definitely a college spot in the heart of Kent. The food is very good, but be sure to go on Tuesday for half price sushi. Unfortunately, the restaurant is quite loud due to the open warehouse-like ceiling, but if you can deal with that you will enjoy your time here."}
{"text":"Love the sushi rolls. Order lots because they take a while on half-price Tuesday and you won't want to wait for more to be made.   Michelle S. was a great server, she tipped us off about ordering all the sushi at once, checked in regularly without being annoying, and had a pleasant attitude. Hope she is our server again!"}
{"text":"Super yummy food but it is pricey. My boyfriend & I both got noodles & sushi and we paid $60 after a 20% tip. Oh and the Black Widow sushi is AMAZING!!!!"}
{"text":"My sister took our mother and I here the first time we came here.  We came around 12:30 - 1:00pm. Because it is in downtown Kent no matter what time of day it is it's street parking.  I hate street parking, which is why it lost a star.  The seating is close together for my taste, hence another star lost.  The service was good.  Prompt and friendly.  The server we had always made sure our drinks were full.  The food was wonderful!  I had the twice cooked fried rice with chicken.  It was a mouthful to say and I admit that I messed it up.  My darn tongue would not cooperate with me that day.   Since then I have been back several times with my mother.  We almost always go when they first open.  First because it is easier to park when hardly anyone is around and second because we just like to be there when it is nice and quiet.  Every time we go the food is wonderful!  It's always hot and fresh!  Like I said if not for parking and the closeness of tables it would have gotten 5 stars."}
{"text":"The only reason I am giving it a 2 is because the food is decent. However, the service has been awful twice. Im not picky and usually never complain but the waitress was terrible. We were mostly ignored by her and I did not get my glass of wine until I reminded her and it came after our food was served."}
{"text":"I'm glad a friend recommended we stop here when we were in town for a rock show. Their mixed-drink menu is pretty lengthy but I ended up just getting one extremely strong regular martini, which set me up fairly well for the night ahead. The food selection and quality was extremely good -- I'm kinda surprised this place has an average of only three stars. Got the bento box, which is basically the sampler platter -- four pieces of (big and great) sushi, salad, small bowl of noodles, rice, and fried vegetables. Service was fast and friendly even though they seemed busy on a Saturday night. I'm not in Kent too often, but when I return I'll definitely stop in here again."}
{"text":"Food was decent but service was unacceptable (which is why I'll never return). Awhile back, my friend and I went for lunch and ordered martinis. Hers was supposed to have champagne in it but when she received it, it was flat. She asked the waitress if they had possibly forgot to add in champagne and the waitress went to go ask her manager. She came back and said that the manager told her that they no longer added champagne to that martini because it \"wastes\" the champagne having to open a bottle for this drink (but you're still paying full price for the drink). She said they could open a bottle for us if she wanted but that it's kind of a waste. My friend ended up complaining and they promised to send a gift certifcate to makeup for the bad experience - never happened. Customer experience is obviously not a priority here!"}
{"text":"I love sushi and ramen. This place is good but not GREAT. The best time to go is Tuesday night for 1/2 off of sushi rolls."}
{"text":"Everything tastes ok , nothing special . WAY , WAY too much rice with the sushi . We paid steep prices for basically nothing more than white rice . Disappointing ."}
{"text":"My wife and I tried this place and we loved it.  She had the Nabeyaki Udon and I had the Chicken Nabe and both were excellent.  What really makes their noodle bowls are their broths, which are very rich and flavorful.  We both had some margaritas, which were good.  The only downside was that it was a little loud.  But the service was great.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Ramen w/ savory soy=  Hostess =  Atmosphere =  Server = Jon-Anthony   Awful! He didn't greet us, the hostess (Jacqui - the GM) ended up taking our order and even after she passed it on to him, he still did not come by! He did deliver our food but did not indicate that he was our server. Jacqui ended up taking our payment to him and assured us that our experience was not the norm. We will go to the Newdle Bar again but if Jon-Anthony is our server, we may not stay!"}
{"text":"Sam and I stopped in here on a really rainy day, looking forward to a big hot bowl of something good. It was still early on a Saturday evening, and we found a nice spot for the two of us. This was our second visit, and we jumped right in, trying their gyoza, and two bowls of Nabeyaki Udon. The order of five dumplings arrived, served with a spicy ginger dipping sauce and a carrot heavy slaw. It was pretty, but tasted just about average. Two bowls arrived really hot, topped with tempura veggies and shrimp. Big broccoli pieces, carrot, and zucchini floated, and we tried to get at them before they became soggy, pulling them out as quick as we could, though the rest of the broth was filled with floating soaked pieces of batter. The udon noodles were filling, even without catching all the taste of the broth. The waitress was nice. The space leaves some to be desired, especially the zombie looking George Harrison on the wall. Maybe this kind of thing does really well with the sushi scene, but in my humble opinion is a long way from the little noodle spot we figured it to be.  I've had a lot better, for a lot less in other places, but considering what else is around it, I hope they keep pushing, and I'm glad to see something other than what's going on around it."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the sushi here! I've tried several different rolls and all were good! The service is great! And the drinks are good and priced great! We will be back"}
{"text":"By the time you read this review, the place will probably be out of business.  I should have known better because we walked in for the lunch rush and there were only 2 other tables of people.  We thought we'd at least get in and out of there quick, but no, we were there for 90+ minutes.  The water with cucumber slices in it is gross.  My nephew had the yakisoba, and he said the yakisoba at the chow hall in the Marines was better.  2 of us had ramen and it was bad.  The pork just smelled and tasted expired.  The wait staff were inexperienced but tried really hard.  I think they know how bad the food is and feel bad."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I got extremely sick the first time I ate here because although the waiter and manager assured me my food was vegetarian, it actually contained fish. I've been back since and have found it to be adequate. There are very few vegetarian options and the servers do not always understand what is vegetarian versus not (e.g., many of the sauces contain fish but if the dish doesn't have chunks of meat they say it's vegetarian). If you have food allergies, I wouldn't recommend this place. I've gotten the ramen with a vegetarian broth (it's not on the menu, so ask for it), which was pretty good. I did not care for the vegetable roll. The edamame has some weird seasoning on it, but you can ask for edamame without it. Also, most of the times I've been the service was mediocre (nobody would come by for 20 minutes after we were seated or they would disappear forever when it was time for the check). However, it's frequently pretty full and they seem to be improving."}
{"text":"My mom and I went here for the first time tonight and I have to say, overall I wasn't overally impressed with the place. It seems like it tries to be a fancier restaurant, but then realize that it's Kent and put some decor on the walls to make it appeal more to college students. Our waitress was friendly, but nothing too great about her. We got the gyozo (maybe? However it's spelled, it was pan fried dumplings) to start while I got the Ramon dish and my mom got the fried rice with shrimp dish. The dumplings were quite good-I was a fan of the spicy sauce that comes with it. My mom loved her dish, however later in the night it seemed to upset her stomach. I wasn't too fond of my Ramon noodles, I added grilled chicken and it seemed to give the dish a strange smell. Though the best part is that Insomnia Cookies is right next door ;)   I was honestly expecting it to be a noodle place (I mean the name could only suggest that...) but about 80% of their menu is sushi-which I am not a fan of. If you don't mind paying a little bit of extra money & I guess really like sushi then this is the place."}
{"text":"Although I don't often eat Asian food, when I am in the mood for it, Newdle Bar is the place I go.   The decor of the restaurant makes it one of the coolest restaurants in Kent. There are different kinds of pop art throughout the restaurant, which really brings a fun and modern atmosphere to the business.   I ordered the Bi Bim Bap rice bowl, which is a Korean style rice bowl with steamed rice, vegetables and topped with a fried egg. The bowl is seasoned with sesame oil, and I got mine with tofu. The reason I'm giving this review four stars is because although there were all kinds of ingredients in my bowl, the food was honestly a little bland. I enjoyed it, I just don't think I'll order it again.   Newdle Bar is a great edition to downtown Kent."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and they never disappoint. I love the atmosphere, the staff are always friendly, and the food is fresh! I love their sweet and spicy wings and their Bi Bim Bap. This place makes me wish I lived closer to Kent."}
{"text":"Newdle Bar is an average college town Japanese restaurant. My friend and I both ordered the chicken ramen bowl. I ordered mine with the soy broth and my friend had the miso broth. I definitely recommend the soy over the miso broth as it is more flavorful and not as salty. My friend additionally tried sushi for the first time and ordered a Philadelphia roll. Although she didn't care for it, our waitress offered to switch out the order with another grilled salmon sushi roll to try instead. Our waitress was very helpful and knowledgeable about the menu. She was also attentive to us the whole time. 10/10 service"}
{"text":"Sometimes they are closed? They have strange hours. But the yaki udon is superb usually over staffed but always hiring?"}
{"text":"Sushi is just ok, but their ramen is sooooo good!  Their tofu nabe, steamed dumplings, summer roll, and shrimp shumai are also a few of my favorites.  When this place first opened I wasn't happy with the food, I'm so glad that I gave it a second chance!  It's my favorite restaurant in Kent."}
{"text":"I ordered Miso Soup, California roll, and the Philadelphia roll. Miso soup was good, HUGE portion ... not sure why. The rolls were super small and there wasn't much in them. Luckily I came on a Tuesday so the small rolls were half off. Service was fine, but the waiter took forever to take our order. As someone of Asian heritage, I would not recommend coming here if you are looking for authentic Japanese or Korean food."}
{"text":"Ever wonder what it'd be like if Dave's Cosmic Subs opened up an Asian fusion restaurant? Well it's here showing off a weird modern/60's theme.   The menu seems a bit over priced especially for ramen and bland meat over miso soup. The sushi was pretty tasty though.  A full bar complete with a ton of wine will definitely attract me over but probably not on a Friday night.   Maybe a second time will be better.   - @ZakirGhazi"}
{"text":"Trendy, pricey, but clean and entertaining. Newdle Bar is not for the picky eater! But my waiter, Matthew, was adorable & hilarious :) My friend invited my fiance & I out to meet her there & we didn't want to order without her. But after being over 40 minutes late we caved &  we both got the Tokyo noodle bowl, the portions were perfect & the broth was pretty tasty. But I was disappointed that the only drink options we had was awful cucumber water or hot cherry tea- nothing else. Not even plain old tap water was available. The drinks, such as a glass of wine or a martini; were way over priced!!!!  But again, our waiter was awesome! He jokingly harassed our friend when she finally showed up, he was very attentive & offered some of the best service I've had in months. I'd be willing to give them another chance but maybe bring my own tea bags next time?!"}
{"text":"Noodles were ok.  Chopsticks were cheap off brand.  They didn't have any beers on draft.  Sushi (4 rolls) on a Saturday took an hour which was ridiculous. Just sat for an hour with no food.  And once we got the sushi is was pretty bad (bland, dry, just meh).  Just avoid this place if you can get into Paninis or Bar 145."}
{"text":"It nice to have a place like this in Kent. We get take out all the time from there and the Bibimbap is incredible. I'm not sure what is in the sauce, but they should bottle it. I would give it 5 stars if it wasn't quite as loud inside. They need something on the walls to absorb some sound, but also add to the atmosphere."}
{"text":"If I had to rank this on taste alone, it would be 5 out of 5 stars, but unfortunately, the rest of the package brings it down to a 3 star place.  There were 5 people in our group, including me, and we were greeted and seated promptly.  Now, keep in mind that this place IS NOT kid friendly.  I brought my 4 year old here, only because he is a NOODLE FREAK!  He can eat and devour noodles and it was great for him.  Otherwise, there is NO KID'S menu or KID sized serving of anything.  It is NOT  a kid friendly place.  So that alone made it lose a star.  While clean and neat, this place is packed full of seating.  When we arrived the place was 1/2 full and it was hard to navigate through.  I felt claustrophobic.  Our waiter, overall, was horrid.This is why it lost another star.  While he did bring us our initial drinks and answered all of our questions, he did NOT in any way refill any of our beverages.  EVER!  We were forced to drink this HORRID cucumber water.  EWWWW!  I started gagging when I drank it.  My hopes for a pleasant lunch were starting to sink until the food came.  Promptly mind you.  We only waited about 10 minutes after ordering when our sushi came out and it was FABULOUS!  I loved it!!!  About 5 minutes after that, our main courses came.  I ordered the Bi Bim Bop and it was better than I've ever had, and trust me, my mother-in-law is Korean.  I've had authentic.  It's hard to hate a place when the food was hot, flavorful and the wait short.  I ordered the classic Ramen for my son and he absolutely LOVED it!  Even drank the broth!  While the wait for the check was long, the overall experience was good.  I would go back, but I would request a different server.  This guy really sucked!!"}
{"text":"I go to Newdle all the time for sushi on their half priced sushi Tuesdays and it's probably my favorite restaurant in Kent! The servers are all great and the food is amazing every time!! I have ordered the same sushi at Hibachi and found Newdle's to be better. There can be a wait since it is so popular on Tuesdays, but it's super affordable for what you get so it's well worth it in my opinion! I love their potstickers and their ramen as well, and I would recommend this to anyone in Kent looking for a quick easy dinner or date night."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch after getting into town. I used to come here every once in a while back when it was new in town, but I ate meat back then so my focus on the menu was very different.  This time, as I wasn't feeling very well, I only ordered a miso soup and the micado salad. I wasn't expecting the size of either of them so I was only able to pick at the salad, but both were delicious. My husband got a sushi roll (we don't remember the name but it was shrimp tempura and avocado) and the gyoza. He also got the tsunami martini, which he loved. Overall the food was fantastic and the service was very friendly.  Vegetarians should note that most of the menu items are prepared with some sort of non-vegetarian broth. I consulted my server and she said the kitchen is willing to work with people to meet dietary needs."}
{"text":"I was just looking for sushi semi local to my parents house in Lake Milton. What a disappointment. Don't come here. Slow service. Sushi was probably worse then what you can get at getgo. Ramon was ok. Not worth it. I feel bad for all the college kids. They need a good sushi place."}
{"text":"Ramen was good but the noodles were kinda gross, too think, maybe not cooked enough, maybe too much egg. Overall was pretty good as far as Cleveland area ramen goes. Sushi was also pretty tasty, but being out in Kent I wonder how fresh it could really be."}
{"text":"There's 20+ 'not recommended' reviews for Newdle Bar. Looking through them, I'm inclined to agree with a good number of them.  If I go to Newdle Bar, it's only on a Tuesday for half-priced sushi, because I'm not a fan of anything else on the menu. Prepare for a long long long long long wait, and waiters that couldn't care less. Avoid the white tuna, it's not as good as other places, like Phoenix Express in Stow. The Philadelphia roll is great, but only at half price rates. The online menu prices are also wrong, and are higher inside the restaurant. The atmosphere is loud, so don't expect to have intimate conversations with your dining Partner. Ross overall the place is good for a long dinner and some sushi. Many people have mixed experiences but that has been mine."}
{"text":"Three of us for lunch.  When we went in, saw the TVs and noted the high noise level -- that should have been our clue that we were about to make a mistake.  We did not get the hint and stayed.  I wish we had not.  The \"bib im bop\" (Korean) lunch I had was a sad imitation of the real thing.  I suppose they added the same vegetables they use for everything else.  Tasteless and disappointing -- at a high $10.  The service was mediocre at best.    The interior is \"hard,\" VERY noisy and uninspired.  I remember better chow halls when I was in the military.  Bottom line:  A trendy sort of place in the \"new and very cool\" [barf] area of Kent; mediocre food; mediocre service and a LOT of noise.  Best to avoid."}
{"text":"This was a great place. The sushi was good. The noodles in garlic sauce was delicious. It had fresh vegetables mixed in. The cucumber infused water tasted great."}
{"text":"Very good noodle dishes here. We enjoy the ramen and Asian sticky wings. Fun place, nice staff."}
