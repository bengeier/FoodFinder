{"text":"The French toast was thick (only finished 1 of he 2 slices) and the maple syrup has citrus flavours in it which may not be everyone's cup of tea but I liked it because it cut the sweetness. 

The eggs Benedict were good but the roasted potatoes stood out to me more than the eggs Benny.  

We got there at around 10 and had to wait about 5-10 minutes. Shortly after that, the line grew and it got very busy before brunch time."}
{"text":"Got a FREE breakfast!! They quoted us 15-20 minutes however the wait was around 30 minutes. So when we sat down they offered us a free meal. Great customer service :)"}
{"text":"Still thinking about their unexpectedly fab sweet potato and bacon salad. I'm a fan of their eggs benny, bacon and gingerbread pancakes. The staff and owners are great, love their 70s radio selection too."}
{"text":"No wait is too long for a classic breakfast spot. 

On a warm sunny October in Toronto, it was time to check out Emma's Country Kitchen on St. Clair W. The place was packed and the wait time was 20 minutes, but the staff was very accommodating and coffee ($2) was provided in take out cups for patrons outside waiting. Homemade donuts are available too which were a hit with many (arrive early for the bacon maple donut since they run out!).

Inside, the restaurant is light and bright and filled with a wonderful energy. The server was on his game and was very helpful with the specials and all our needs.

The group choice was The Classic ($10) which was a heaping plate of 2 eggs any style, bacon/sausage, delicious home fries, choice of toast and a side dish of happiness. The meal was hot, delicious and coffee refills were done promptly. I was so hungry that I ate it all before I remembered that I should have taken a pic. Oops.

Lots of other great meal options including eggs benedict, pumpkin (boo!) pancakes and quiche of the day.

Meal was ridonkulously inexpensive for Toronto. I would definitely return for more. 

Lots of street and bike parking. :-)"}
{"text":"Came for a Thursday brunch.  

Ordered spiced pear oatmeal with a side order of pancake. Portion of side order pancake is actually good enough for a small appetite stomach. If one thinks Mildred's buttermilk blueberry pancake is awesome, I'd suggest come to Emma before making that conclusion. 

Glad it had moved to current location. More space. Staff are all friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"We ordered the Emma's Benny (eggs benny) and The Classic with poached eggs, buttermilk biscuit, and hollandaise sauce (upgrades). Both are definitely highly recommended menu items. I was pleasantly surprised by their delicious poached egg, which was poached with a tinge of butter, and their crisply baked potatoes. We didn't get a chance to order the maple bacon doughnut, but for those who want to order this, I recommend coming into before 10am as they ran out pretty quickly. 

The only reason this place is not a full 5 star is that the place is quite small, so the wait time is between 20-40 minutes at a time, and you cannot make reservations or wait inside...which is a hassle if it's cold outside. The servers are also not the fastest people, but they are quite friendly once they get to you."}
{"text":"Made it up to E.C.K today, Sunday 12pm. 
First off, the service was efficient & very friendly.  We never felt rushed & coffee (which was pretty good) was always happily topped off.  My brunch date & I ordered the eggs Benny, (wished there could be more variety).   Here is the breakdown;  the eggs are done well, the sauce ok, the peameal ok except for the fact I had to carve off about a teaspoon of fat, given it is bacon, I can over look that......I guess.  The biscuit that everything sat on was not even warm in temperature & VERY salty... I left it behind.  The red skin potatos, we got well done, and that worked out nicely.
Still, I think the Bennies are better in Leslieville."}
{"text":"Went to brunch twice over long weekend, because it was so delicious. Their specialty is comfort food and entrees made just the way you want them. Eggs Benny was classic with buttery Hollandaise sauce. Quiche also very good. Thick cut fries with skins are  perfect. Fruit salad and two types of juices also fresh. Pumpkin pancakes are very buttery. The biscuit is a must as aside order even if you have the Benny, you should still order the biscuit to get the full flavor of the butter with citric flavor.
Excellent service. Servers are sincere when they come by to see how you are doing. No lattes,but nice teas and usual coffees. No hot chocolate (summer), they offered to heat chocolate milk, which was a great substitute."}
{"text":"The best joint to grab east coast style great breakfast. The food is very well cooked and the staff is super friendly. There's not much in the way of decor, but the vibe is warm and friendly. Their pantry full of frozen soups, broths, breads and desserts is awesome and super convi"}
{"text":"Best place to go for brekkie!  Try their beignet, it is amazing!! I was ecstatic to score the last one!! Besides the amazing food, you will absolutely be pleased with their service. It was quite the long line on Saturday brunch, the  servers were friendly and gave us coffee at the counter during our wait.  Definitely beats the rest for brunch!"}
{"text":"Heavenly biscuits and great service. Worth the short wait. Tried the Emma's Benny, granola, and breakfast biscuit and all were very yummy. We were looking forward to trying the donuts but apparently they sell out by 10am. Must go earlier next time!"}
{"text":"What a great place. The service is excellent. The food is fantastic. I took my parents here to have a late Saturday lunch and they loved it! We ended up taking what was left of the baked goods home. High five to the awesome staff! We'll be back."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal! The best food I've ever had in my entire life. Also, the best donuts in the world. The eggs benny, cob salad and sausages are amongst my favourite things to order. These lovely ladies also do catering. This place puts every brunch place in the city to shame.  Love love love. 

Thanks for the great eats :D"}
{"text":"Expect to wait a long time! 
We got there right when they opened yet were told we had to wait 20 minutes to get seated even though the restaurant was more than half empty. Not worth it - especially on a cold winter's day..."}
{"text":"This place rules. Staff is super sweet and the food is quality deliciousness! Weekend brunch and donuts are their claim to fame; however, I am addicted to their lunch specials. Go, go now :D"}
{"text":"I can 100% say this is the best brunch place I have been to. I remember coming to this place when it first opened, and now business is blooming! (As it should be).

The atmosphere has a nice comfortable feeling to it, minus when it's really busy, then it just seems too small for its own good.

But that's besides the point, the food is phenomenal, the service is exceptional as well. 

I normally order the classic breakfast and it never disappoints. I've had their pancakes, French toast, and Benny's and they are all amazing as well.

I don't think I could go back to eating at other breakfast places anymore if I had to go out and eat. Definitely top on my list. 

Give this place a try! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"What an adorable spot!  We stopped here for brunch right before the rush and there was a line out the door right after we were sat.  My friend had the hangover burger which looked amazing, and I had the Eggs Benedict (I'm pretty dependable that way).  I opted for rye bread instead of a biscuit (I don't love biscuits).  The service was very friendly and we had a really nice time!  It's a little out of the way for us downtowners, but next time I'm in the area I'll definitely head back for a donut.  They had maple-bacon...I don't know if I could resist again!"}
{"text":"I am newer to this area and was looking for a diner spot -- headed to the easy-to-spot BOOM! but there was a line up to get a seat ..... so started walking and if the sandwich board didn't tell me the right thing I'd never have looked it's way..... \"Emma's Country Kitchen\".  A classic but spacious country diner in look and feel with country radio in the kitchen and fresh bread from the oven.  I've encountered 2 floor staff -- both enthusiastic, happy, and attentive.  Even has a freezer full of oven-ready entrees to serve for family dinners.  Needless to say I have found my go-to diner at Dufferin and St.Clair."}
{"text":"This is review is just for their donuts! We ordered 4 dozen mini donuts ($70) for a birthday party and they were an enormous success! Absolutely delicious, yeast-risen, not too sweet and made with fresh ingredients. Also, everyone we dealt with was absolutely lovely and accommodating. Thanks for the delicious, home-made donut love!"}
{"text":"We first visited on Friday last week... actually, I visited a bunch of times before they finally opened for business and proceeded to delay returning for over a year. I don't know, I been busy.  I turned left onto St. Clair with a PLAN... about eight blocks later K says Hey, what about going to that Emma's place for breakfast... clever me gets to smile evil again and say Okay.... 

 Sunny day and no line up, in we go. We get menus and order coffee, which arrives and is good. I notice that the menu has the current date on the corner...hmmm, a fresh sheet in a breakfast joint. This is a good sign.

 Are those donuts? (of course they are, what else would make you ask Are those donuts? but donuts?) Very pleasantly proportioned donuts. And a whole bunch of other fresh baked things... Second good sign, they bake their own.

 House made Sage & Onion sausage... seriously? House cured bacon? Enough already, I'm convinced. This place has won me over and I have yet to even order. Why are you still reading this review? Go now and eat. I'll wait.

 Welcome back. Did you see the table the cops were eating at? No? Have a close look. It's just under the shelf between the doors to the restrooms... pretty funny, right? I asked the server if she sat them there on purpose and she got a horrified look on her face as she realised what I was referring to...

 So I had the basic breakfast, eggs scrambled and sausage, rye toast. My eggs were about the best I have had and the sausage is amazing... I ate my breakfast without hot sauce for the first time in a long time, and that include my own cooking... so, it's a good breakfast. K had the breakfast sandwhich, on the biscuit with more cheese than is allowed and bacon every bit as good as the sausage. 
 We have a friend coming in for one day on the weekend form Out West and we ask about Sunday opening... the reply is affirmative and we get handed the brunch menu to peruse... it's a good one, no doubt. 

 We went back on Sunday, Out-of-Towner in tow and had a great breakfast. They both had I Know What You Did Last Night Burgers, which was totally appropriate as they were both very hungover... K let me taste hers and for the first time ever I wanted so badly to be hungover and eating my own I Know What You Did Last Night Burger. The burger is made with the S&O Sausage AND comes with BACON and a dose of happy big enough to wash away the sins of the night before. I made do with another amazing breakfast, this time with bacon and a biscuit. Glorious way to start the day.

 A highlight for me was our server, who was attentive, funny and totally right on. When she took our drink order, we told her we were ready to order. She told us that she had a table ahead of us who were ready to order and she would take theirs and be right back. Having been that other table (at other restaurants, let me be clear) I cannot begin to tell you how cool this was. She did the right thing then and in fact throughout the meal, and that tells me that this place is special. Truth be told, every person we interacted with on both visits was great, outgoing and clearly happy to be where they were. Great food, great vibe."}
{"text":"This is... my ALL TIME FAV BREAKFAST place in the whole city! Coras was always my top choice, but this place has knocked it down. 

Everything is made there, EVERYTHING! 

My #1 choice for breakfast is the bennies which I opted for sausage instead of bacon. 
Also, the oak cake is the perfect way to end your breakfast is you have any room left in your stomach!"}
{"text":"Prices are reasonable. Was informed by server almost everything is made in house, including breads, sausage and even the hot sauce!

Had classic breakfast, but also wanted pancakes. Server told me pancakes come in half order. Done!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a Saturday...ended up waiting about an hour for a table, so if you're prone to getting HANGRY...maybe try coming on a weekday.  Aside from the long wait, everything was excellent.

The Emma's benny was delicious - loved the biscuit!  The griddled potatoes on the side were also very good.  Highly recommend ordering this if you're a fan of eggs benedict.

Also ordered the pumpkin pancakes with a side of bacon.  The pancakes were perfectly light and fluffy.  It had a good amount of cinnamon/nutmeg(?) flavour and lots of walnuts.  The brown butter it was served with was awesome, and I loved their bacon!! 
If your meal doesn't come with bacon, you have to get some on the side.  You really have to.

Service was quick, friendly and attentive.  Even though the restaurant was quite busy, our server was very good about making sure our water and coffees were refilled, and checked on us throughout our meal to make sure everything was good."}
{"text":"My husband and I are new to the city, been looking for good brunch spots to go. Found this on Yelp. We've been there twice and it's one of our favorites! Both food and service are great! We usually get there around 9:30-10 ish, always managed to missed the line-ups. Non-pretentious, just good quality food!"}
{"text":"I like Emma's a lot. Been there for brunch a few times. Waits can get long, but service is good and so is food. My fav is the burger. Prices are a bit steep. Try the donuts."}
{"text":"This review is a little tough, but still gave it a good rating. Here is why...

The food and the service was really great. We had the Benny, extra biscuits and coffee. The homemade biscuits are delicious. Also their house cured peameal bacon was awesome.

However i just struggle a little bit with the price. We paid for the 2 of us $43. This does not include the tip we left for the good service. That is a little pricey for brunch.

I see this place more as brunch treat than a place you go every day of the weekend."}
{"text":"Really long  wait 1 hour and they made people leave into the cold becase store is too small. All sold out of donuts by noon. Was not worth the drive,parking,wait.or 50 dollars. Staff was nice food was mediocre at best. Eggs benny cold sauce hard potatoes. Our table was by cash so every 5 minutes we had a new butt in our faces while we ate..classy. \"you don't gotta eat here\""}
{"text":"We went to Emma's Country Kitchen last weekend and had a nice brunch. It was a nice place, and the staff are very very friendly. 

We had one of the little teeny mini tables near the front with slightly wobbly chairs though, which makes eating meals fairly awkward. My husband and I had to kind of stagger our plates so they could both fit on the little table.

We ordered the eggs benny and the French toast. Both were tasty and very big portions. The food was good, but perhaps a bit too pricey for what it was."}
{"text":"My friend recmmended this place.
It's O.K....not as good as I expected."}
{"text":"the gf and i are so happy that Emma's opened in our neighbourhood shortly after we moved here. It has become our go to brunch spot and all of the friends and family we have taken here have loved it too. my personal favourites are the eggs benny and granola while my gf loves the breakfast biscuit and potatoes. coffee and fresh juices are great with a constant refill on the coffee/tea/water. don't get me started on the donuts.. just go get one.. or ten! they change weekly and i've never been disappointed.

if you go for lunch or during the week please get the BLAT (bacon, lettuce, avocado and tomato) sandwich.. it is amazing and i find myself dreaming of it constantly. The weekday menu changes all the time so keep an eye on their facebook page to find out the daily specials. the burger is also awesome!

the servers are great, in particular, Laura - we love her! she's super bubbly and funny and is totally on the ball. Co-owner Heather is also wonderful and is constantly communicating with customers about wait times and the availability of popular items so you're never left feeling forgotten. keep in mind it is a small and very popular place so if you don't get in early you will probably have to wait a bit but it's worth it. Boom down the road has nothing on these guys.

the chefs are great and the food is made at a very consistent quality, we have been there many many times and never once has the food been under or overcooked. i love that pretty much everything is home made and the time and effort put into their food is evident!

good luck to the crew at Emma's, we genuinely hope they continue to grow their business and stick around for many years to come!"}
{"text":"It was a great experience! The restaurant was comfortable and felt like we were eating at home. The service was pretty attentive and friendly. We had a quiche and the classic breakfast. Both of them tasted pretty good but the classic breakfast definitely got me hook line and sinker. The eggs were scrambled to perfection, have yet to taste such amazing eggs until today, not only were the eggs amazing but it came with bacon and roasted potatoes that definitely made this dish the complete meal!! I would definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"Finally, a weekend brunch spot that isn't filled with a scowling and neglectful staff to serve the Sunday brunch-fiending rush. This charming brunch spot has a variety of your usual brunch suspects: bennies, pancakes, even quiche and cobb salad for those watching their holiday weight. But seriously, Emma knows how to do it right. 

Our server was incredibly delightful- in fact, everyone on staff was charming from the moment we put our name down for the wait-list. While they were accommodating for our table of 5, it was an hour long wait before we were seated. Watch out because this place gets really packed on weekends (like, line-up-outside-the-door-in-minus-degree-weather packed.) I would also say this place seems to be more fitting for smaller parties because of the limited seats available.

Anyway back to the food, I ordered \"The Classic\"($10) and a kombucha tea. Everything was supa fresh and nicely proportioned. The sage+onion sausage was flavourful, my over-easy eggs were ooey gooey inside (for obvious toast dippage), and the cubed red skin potatoes was a nice homestyle touch compared to the typical McCain fries at other breakfast joints. 
I will admit, I was suffering a little bit of buyers remorse when I looked over at my friends Eggs Benedict. It looked so beautiful.. the hollandaise sauce (as well as my ever-flowing drool), was just glistening for my attention, will have to try it next time. 
Kombucha tea was fantastic, and our server came by to happily refill my pot with more hot water. Try their homemade hot sauce, it's soo good. It's not quite like tabasco or sriracha, more of like a savoury ketchup-y hot sauce, all made in-house. I wanted to buy a jar to take home, but they were all out :(

This whole street is filled with great brunch spots, but make sure not to miss this place!"}
{"text":"Food was good. 
Service was very good. 
Price is the problem. 
When you charge $13 for eggs benny and $10 for french toast (and this is St Clair west of Oakwood, not Yorkville) the $2 for diner level coffee is not appreciated. 
Want to support the local places but not when they're this much of a rip off. 
A shame."}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat. Breakfast and brunch has become a huge event on St.Clair and this plaza meets those expectations. The breads are fresh and organic. The meals are very good as well. The atmosphere is very family based and chilled back. The price is going rate for this neighborhood. It's another hidden gem on st Clair. Give it a try. The weekends are very busy so b prepared to wait."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times for breakfast. The line-up is always long, and make sure you go early as sometimes they run out of biscuits and/or peameal. 
Their house cured bacon is absolutely delicious, as is their homemade biscuits. The biscuits fall apart so easily and are delicious as an add-on to any meal. However, they seem to fall apart too easily to be a good bottom for their Eggs Benny. It's delicious, but difficult to manage eating without getting messy. 
Their rosemary and sea salted roasted potatoes are absolutely fantastic.
Servers are fairly nice- but sometimes seem a little overwhelmed. But so would I be if I worked in a constantly full restaurant. 

This is definitely one of my favourite breakfast spots in the city."}
{"text":"I am going to make this review short but sweet:

Emma's Country Kitchen is a gem in the middle of a seemingly otherwise \"dumpy\" area. The location used to be a real divey night club but (thankfully) this cute brunch place took it over.

They are known for their hamburgers and eggs benny, along with their pancakes (which change seasonally). I took my mother here a couple Sundays ago and we both decided on the eggs benny (the burger was already sold out). The hollandaise sauce was delicious and the eggs were done perfectly. While I (unfortunately) cannot eat the English muffin it was served on (oh the trials and tribulations of the wheat-intolerant), my mom said that it was a nice touch. The eggs are served over top of peameal bacon, which I am normally not a fan of, but I really thought it worked well with the meal. The potatoes...WERE AMAZING! They were crispy on the outside while retaining their moisture and fluffiness inside. They are seasoned with thyme, which really brought out the flavour of the potatoes. The only downside was that the coffee there seems to be on the strong side (at least for my tastes) but that is minor compared to the fantastic meal you get, and for a phenomenal price to top it off!

If you are in the mood for a great brunch at a great price and don't mind the trek to St. Clair and Dufferin, Emma's Country Kitchen is your go-to!"}
{"text":"It's about time we had a great breakfast place within (a short) walking distance of our house!

Dropped in on a Sunday at 2:30pm and were greeted by all the staff (3 people on the floor) in a friendly and welcoming manner.  Seated right away.  Coffee poured and orders taken and delivered quickly.  We both ordered the breakfast with two eggs.  My husband had the house-cured bacon - which is a must-try!  I had the sausage which was delicious, nicely seasoned and not at all greasy.  Roasted potatoes on the side were terrific. Portions were good. All in all, a great upgraded basic breakfast.

Meats are from Beretta farms, so you can feel good about eating here.  Also, they have a number of dishes for takeaway - soups, meat pies, cookie dough, etc..  Very handy for busy folk like us. Coffee is good, too!

For anyone with mobility issues; I don't know if the washrooms are wheelchair-accessible, but it is nice that they are on the main floor.  (Very different from most little restaurants in Toronto that have you running through an underground warren to go pee!)  So you can bring grandma or your friend with the busted knee and know they will be comfortable.

Only things I would change:
- There is no HP sauce.  I DO appreciate great cooking. However, I reserve my right to drown it in the condiment of my choice.
- The eggs had salt & pepper on them when delivered to the table, but there was no salt or pepper on the tables.  I would much rather dress my own eggs.  Just something to know if you prefer them plain, or in my case, swimming in HP."}
{"text":"Came here because we saw it on 'You Gotta Eat Here' and left full and happy.

Protip: If you come, make sure you come just before it opens.  We came on Family Day and arrived at 8:55am, by this time, there was already one family waiting in line along with two other cars (plus us) waiting for them to open.  By the time it was 9:10am, they were already full and people were waiting out the door.

Food, we ordered the pancakes (they were delicious, you get 3 of them and they were all very good with the cinnamon butter and maple syrup, yum!), a side order of bacon (nice thick cut pieces although a bit overcooked for my liking), a buttermilk biscuit (generous size, very fluffy and comes with homemade jam and butter), and the apple cheddar fritter (this was probably my favourite of the meal, it just tastes so good).  We also had the hazelnut and nutella donut which wasn't as good.  Do check the menu before you come because, well, it isn't very big but what we had was very good.

Decor, the place is nice, nothing fancy, good amount of light, clean and simple wooden table and chairs although the door does let in quite a draft even though we sat at the back of the restaurant.  Seats about 30 would be my guess.

Service, the place was pretty busy from the get go, so don't expect the world and be prepared to flagged down your waiter/waitress (this wasn't a deal breaker since they pass by quite frequently even if they aren't checking up on you).

I wouldn't hesitate to return or recommend the place to others."}
{"text":"I went to Emma's today based on the reviews here on Yelp. I must say I was disappointed with the kitchen staff. I ordered classic eggs meal with sausage. I asked the eggs to be medium cooked as I enjoy dipping my bread into my eggs. The eggs came hard boiled. I also did not like the bread.  I did like the fact that the eggs were a good size and not tiny like most breakfast places. The sausage had a very good flavour. The coffee was average at best. The best part of of my experience was the waitress/server/cashier/bus person. She handled the whole place on her own. I got refills quite quickly and I didn't have to wait forever for a second glass of water. She was busy and still very polite. She was exceptional. I don't know if I will go back."}
{"text":"Took over an hour to be seated... but MAN!! Was it worth the wait! The food was just so amazing and fresh, came out quickly, the server and all the staff were super friendly (even the girl behind the counter who heard us complaining about waiting but was still super nice about it :P) .. But unfortunately they ran out of their maple bacon doughnut by the time we wanted one, so I guess I'll have to go back again to get one...darn. ;P"}
{"text":"Came here with my husband and 2 friends today to celebrate my birthday. 

We waited for ~15-20 minutes at 1:30pm on a Saturday which wasn't too long. 

We were seated at a 4 person table beneath a kind of nook.  There aren't a lot of large tables at this restaurant and one of the few that could fit 4 ppl were beneath stairs.  It didn't feel too cramped but it was a bit dark.  My suggestion would be to come here as a pair rather than a group...you're more likely to get a table faster and you won't have to potentially sit under the stairs. 

My friend and I both ordered the Eggs Benny.  I love how the eggs sit atop of a biscuit.  I love biscuits in general and the one's at Emma's are pretty good.  The mousseline sauce is similar to a hollandaise sauce but not as thick.  I loved how the potatoes were seasoned with thyme.  The peameal bacon also worked well with the benny. Overall, a very satisfying dish. 

Both of our husbands got the classic.  My husband felt it was a pretty standard dish...nothing too special about it although he did like the sausage.  

We also got a plate of the farm fresh french toast to share.  I personally really didn't like it.  It was made of a chocolate hazelnut bread with bananas and dark chocolate.  Now, I love chocolate, but perhaps because it was soaked in custard, I felt the french toast was very dense.  My husband felt that it was dense but he also felt it wasn't too bad because it gave a good balance between sweet and savoury.  

My friends surprised me with a cake and I appreciated the customer service that they had.  They kept the cake cool in the fridge and helped with cutting the cake etc.  

Overall, I would come back to Emma's.  The eggs benny was delicious and the price wasn't bad.  If I lived closer, I'd probably be grabbing a breakfast sandwich more often!"}
{"text":"I've been to Emma's twice so far and it has been fantastic both times. The dishes they serve are not particularly complicated, but every single item I eat there is the best of class. Their buns are fluffy, their home made bacon bursts with flavor, even their eggs are somehow better than normal. I think it must be wizardry or something. I know I'll be eating at Emma's on a very regular basis from now on."}
{"text":"5+ stars for service.  Despite a line up out the door on a busy Sunday afternoon, every staff member we encountered here was sooo friendly and accommodating!  We arrived around 11am and had to wait an hour for a table.
The eggs benedict (subbed sausage instead of the peameal bacon it would normally come with) were delicious! It comes on the buttery biscuit, which is SO good!
Unfortunately they sold out of beignets and donuts by the time we were ready to order them, but I'll get that next time.  We also shared the french toast (stuffed w/ ham and cheese) - it was just okay, I wouldn't order that again nor would I recommend it.
I also bought a frozen chicken pot pie to bring home. It was good, but a little on the salty side."}
{"text":"We will certainly be back!

We came on a Sunday morning at 11am. Seems that we got in before the rush because we got seated immediately at the counter looking out over the street.

(Note: If you have more than 2 people, you'll be waiting a long time)

Both had coffees (which was re-filled continuously in BIG mugs) and the eggs benny.

The eggs benny did not disappoint! Their biscuits that everyone raves about were AMAZING. And the side of potatoes were perfect and seasoned.. 
MMMMMM  Def lived up to the hype!

We will be back and try something else for sure!"}
{"text":"Wow! I am left speechless with Emma's Country Kitchen. Never have I ever had such an amazing brunch meal that has me excited for my next visit! Such great ingredients and care put into these dishes!This place is amazing!

Came around 10:30 on Sunday morning and had to wait about 30 minutes. This wait was so worth it and not even too bad! 

I ordered Emma's Benny and it was the best meal I have ever had! Served over pea meal bacon and one of their fresh buttermilk biscuits, with amazingly seasoned and moist (if that's even humanly possible) potatoes and really fresh fruit. This eggs Benedict dish was definitely the best ever! Everything was so fresh, succulent and tasty! Every bite had me swooning! The biscuits were sooooo amazing! I already miss them! Such a great dish!

My sister ordered the classic breakfast with 2 eggs, 1/2 bacon, 1/2 sausage, potatoes, fruit and upgraded her toast to the biscuit! The thyme and onion sausage was soo amazing! Would definitely skip the bacon and just get the full sausage next time. The biscuit again was super delicious, and everything was just amazing and super fresh!

Staff were great, friendly and helpful. Overall extremely enjoyable experience! I plan on going back very soon! Their french toast looks delicious!!! And I must come back for a donut!

Definitely recommend this place! It's worth the wait and it's great!!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm so used to writing reviews to warn away people from bad restaurants that this is a pleasant change. Great coffee, can't be said for many places. Everything we ate was good, from the in-store bread to the sausage patties. Finally a place that can make a decent poached egg! Not watery or in old water. My wife's food was also delicious. We don't usually clean our plates as much as we did, but it was satisfying and just the right amount of food. Well done Emma's."}
{"text":"My husband and I chose this little place based on Yelp reviews. I'm so glad we went, it was truly wonderful. First off our server was absolutely one of the best parts of our experiences. She was so sweet and wonderful. We are from Alberta where the service isn't that good and you never have anyone serving coffee and singing a tune !! 

Next the food was amazing!! I had the gingerbread pancakes, so delicious. What a marvellous idea. Totally will be making those at home. My husband had the usual and ate everything. The coffee was delicious as was the hot apple cider. 

Last, but not least. We got a homemade Boston cream donut to go. Wow, best donut I have ever had. I hope to make my way back to this little gem again soon !!"}
{"text":"Am I missing something? We trekked out to Emma's one Sunday morning since we had access to a car (TTCing out for early brunch just doesn't sit right with me) because of the 4.5 stars enticing us. 

It was good, but I am trying to find if they had dropped a star and a half somewhere on their way out from the kitchen to my table. The biscuit that everyone is raving about was way average - tell me maybe I got an exceptionally average batch? It was large, but just felt like a large doughy round thing without the biscuit consistency. The sausage, however, was in fact delicious (and I never ever order sausage with my breaky!!!) They were great even though my indecisive self asked to change my eggs post-order to scrambled (yes, I'm one of those sometimes! I'm sorry!).

Service was very friendly. I wouldn't be opposed to going again, and in fact, if I lived in the area I would probably try some more items off their menu. Boy, did those donuts in the front look good... But alas, since it's a bit far for me I probably will be sticking to my east-end bfast joints!

{"text":"Pretty darn good. It's a shame there's such long lines to get in on weekends, but the staff are polite and do what they can to get guests seated or comfortable while they wait."}
{"text":"Besides the wait like most popular brunch places, Emma's is a great choice.  After 15-20 minute wait, the server offered us complimentary cakes and served us coffee to go with it.  Its always nice when a restaurant takes pride on not only their food but also their service.

Everything on the reasonably priced and the portion are huge AND they all taste awesome.

Have no problem recommending Emma's unless you have a huge group.  Would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Emma's Country Kitchen has ruined any other breakfast sandwich for me.  I now dream of their Buttermilk biscuits and bacon. I went all the way and also stuffed my face with an incredible sage and sausage burger, house made of course.  If you have a chance to visit this amazing place that creates out of this world food, i suggest you do."}
{"text":"Maybe this place has been built up for me which is why I didn't enjoy it like the rest of you reviewers handing it four to fives stars and high fives all around. I am a late sleeper so weekends usually never work out and any place that has a 40 minute wait on brunch day is just not worth my time and hunger. I decided to check this place out with my roommate today because we both had this day off (Wednesday) and figured a week day would be our best chance getting seated here. It took maybe 5 minutes or more to get seated. Sadly they only had those shitty bar stool like high chairs with the tiny table available so we decided to just sit there and hope for the best. 

The staff was very friendly and for that alone they deserve plenty of stars! They were very attentive making sure my tiny cup of water was never out and my roommate's coffee was overflowth and bottomless which is always nice. 

The menu itself however actually enraged me a bit. There were maybe four options for breakfast (one of them wasn't on the menu just told to us by the sever) and three options for lunch which consisted of salmon cakes a cobb salad and a sandwich. I'm sure all three are delicious but com'on really?! It's so limited and not very accommodating to a foodie like myself who has cravings for certain food items. For example: I had read on their website they were offering \"Pumpkin Pancakes\" and I heard incredible reviews of these babies. I had high hopes of shoving these in my mouth only to find out they are no longer serving them (website is not updated) and they only had \"gingerbread pancakes\" available. F*CKING GINGERBREAD! Not everyone likes gingerbread people! When I asked if there was any chance they could just make me plain pancakes and I would pay the same price they said no. Whaaaatt? You can't accommodate just a tad and take the god awful gingerbread ingredient out for me? What kind of place is this? I thought they made everything (but the ketchup) in house? LIES! LIES I SAY!

They honestly lost all the stars by that point. NO STARS! NONE! So I went with the \"Classic\" breakfast option instead which consists of two eggs (anyway you like them) with their in house sausage or bacon and seasoned red potatoes with bread of my choice. It wasn't too long of a wait, maybe 15 minutes so. The food was ok. Honestly it didn't feel very special and like something I couldn't get a similar version of anywhere else. I like the red seasoned potatoes, some were a bit burnt however. My roommate ordered the same with sausage and I ordered with bacon. We switched pieces to try both and he personally enjoyed the bacon for the sweetness and thickness of it. I liked the sausage because it resembled a tiny hamburger patty and the taste wasn't too salty. 

Maybe I need to go back when they have a pancake flavour I do enjoy or wake up early and try to snag a donut which is claimed to be THE donut of all donuts in the city by a lot reviewers on here. But for now I was not impressed. I expected so much more from this homey establishment a block away from my home. For now however, I'll gladly take Boom or Starving Artist over these guys any day."}
{"text":"The food is worth the wait. If you want donuts, get there early!"}
{"text":"If you are prepared to wait, Emma's has a delicious brunch. On Sunday, the wait was around 45mins/1 hr for a table around 10am. Be warned, the wait continues after you are seated. The server actually told us she couldn't take our order because there were too many tables ahead of us. More help is needed! You will also be slightly cramped since the spot is small - especially if you are at one of the tiny bar height tables as my husband and I were when we first came here. If you can look past these things, you won't be disappointed by the food. The eggs Benedict comes on their amazing, buttery biscuits. I suggest taking some to go. The donuts are also great, but it is a shame they are only available on the weekends! We tried the bacon maple - yum. Since I was starving by the time we ordered on Sunday, I ordered the \"I know what you did last night burger\". The patty was made from breakfast sausage and was really flavourful. We grabbed a cottage pie from the freezer to eat for dinner. It was tasty, but some of the vegetables had a pickled taste. I didn't care for it, but it wouldn't stop me from picking up another frozen meal from them. Emma's has a good concept with the frozen food at the back and bakery at the front. I think they need a bigger location and more help! More people need to try their amazing food!"}
{"text":"I wanted to try out Emma's since most of the reviews on Yelp were nothing short of amazing...however I wasn't impressed sorry to say. I came on a weekday which was fine since it wasn't packed and not much of a wait time, that was the positive. Negative, the menu was very limited, only has 4 options maybe even 3? And no fresh baked bread or donuts as mentioned on all the reviews posted....! I inquired with regards to the fresh baked goods and they answered it was only a weekend thing? Seriously, that's very disappointing. And did I mention no speciality coffee...espresso cappuccino or latte, not impressed. Although the staff was friendly but unfortunately not enough for me to return for their mediocre and limited menu."}
{"text":"I love their eggs benny, which is served on their own tasty biscuits. The staff is very friendly and service is good."}

{"text":"I had lunch at Emma's on Thursday May 26th..absolutely wonderful. The always have fresh decaf coffee, in a vacuum thermos so it always tastes fresh. I ordered the  Pizza sandwich with breaded provolone cheese and stewed tomatoes,  please keep this one on the menu...I am in love with it. A butter tart square with walnuts for dessert...what more can you ask for ? Make it a point to go to Emmas and treat yourself to delicious  freshly prepared food, at reasonable prices served by a lovely warm staff. This place is a hidden gem !!!!"}
{"text":"the hollandaise sauce is delicious!  Fall pancakes were great and i don't even like pancakes...the bacon is awesome!!!  love the B.L.T!!!!"}
{"text":"Dined here recently for weekend brunch with three friends. Arrived at 11:30AM and waited a solid hour for a table, which wasn't terrible since we enjoyed a sunny stroll down St. Clair.

Service is chipper and attentive, and ambiance is very quaint and casual. 
Quiche of the day was excellent (9/10), as were the potatoes they come with. (8/10)
Coffee was delicious and donuts looked good (was too full to indulge).

Food was really good, so I could see myself coming back for brunch if I could endure the long wait."}
{"text":"I had the Classic breakfast and it was good. I enjoyed the fresh ingredients they used to make their food. At first, the service at Emma's was very quick. However, as more people started coming in, the service was a lot slower since there was only one waiter working the floor. It took a lot longer to ask for the check or a to-go box. Overall, a nice place for breakfast or brunch."}
{"text":"I remember walking by Emma's Country Kitchen when the menu was first put up on the door.  I scanned it, looking to see if anything would catch my eye and when I got to the \"memories of the farm french toast\" I started to salivate, my taste buds swooned, and I knew the next place I was heading when I wanted to treat myself to breakfast.

I've never been much of a sophisticated foodie.  I'm not able to wax eloquent about the subtle interactions of flavours, and how they weave together to make a meal something special.  All I can do is tell you that this french toast is one of the tastiest things I have ever put in my mouth.  In fact, the only bad thing I could possibly say about it, is that it has left me completely incapable of ordering anything else on the menu.  Add a side of delicious, thickly cut, perfectly cooked bacon and you'll have a breakfast/brunch worthy of any occasion.

The service is wonderful.  Emma's Country Kitchen is run by two of the loveliest ladies on St. Clair West, and I don't think I've ever seen either one of them without a bright smile on their face.  The food comes out quickly, even when they're at their busiest and you are lucky enough to get the last available seat.  Best of all, my coffee cup is refilled at lighting speed, so fast at times that it can be difficult to leave the place when you're done eating!

Now, I saw people whinging about the price a bit, and I can understand that concern.  French toast with a side of bacon and coffee comes to just under $20, which means I don't go nearly as often as I'd like to.  To be honest, if I could have I would have made my rating 4.5/5 due to the price, and I debated whether to go with a 4 or a 5.  Let me tell you why I went with 5.  The second time I went into Emma's Country Kitchen the place was packed, and I did not have time to wait for a seat to open up.  The third time I went, a couple of weeks later, not only was I remembered, I was made to feel as though they were genuinely glad to see me again, and glad that I could grab a table immediately.  This kind of personal touch has been repeated on multiple visits, and has made Emma's Country Kitchen a real pleasure to eat at every time."}
{"text":"Eggs Benny was great!  Great service too.  Very good waiter. This is not a fancy place and it isn't trying to be - and that is a good thing. Pretty busy for 9am on a Sunday. 

I would definitely come again and the eggs Benedict were so good I would be hard pressed to try anything else. 

Tea was quite good too. We avoided the dessert but there was a massive selection of homemade baked goods that looked incredible."}
{"text":"Food was good. Service great. Small place, but decent home style brunches like grams used to make."}
{"text":"The wild blueberry pancakes topped with lemon ricotta were amazing! The Mrs. adored the decor, service, and tulips on the table.   : )"}
{"text":"Emma's has always been our go-to brunch spot, even after we moved out of the area. Can't say enough good things about it. I had originally planned to try the whole menu and finally develop a 'Usual', but everything's always good. Particular standouts are the pancakes they change per seasonal ingredients, daily biscuits, those yummy roasted potatoes, and the weekend donuts if you can get one quick enough!"}
{"text":"The service we received when entered was a bit slow. Place is crowded. But I am really impressed with the daily special, quiche. So good."}
{"text":"Went here based on the reviews on yelp on a late lazy sunday.  Rushed out of the house to make it before the 3pm close, and arrived at 2:40pm, with only one couple in front.  A few minutes later the cashier told me and my boyfriend that they were ``all sold out food except for the couple in front`` what does that mean?  I dont' know but most restaurnts i've worked in or have been too would be happy to help customers up until close to the closing time especially if there's still plenty of time and room in the restaurant to serve them.  Apparently this restaurant does so well it doesn't need your business.  Would not come here again with staff that has such a pretentious attitude."}
{"text":"Emma's opened a few weeks ago and has become my go to brunch spot, whether eating with friends or alone (yeah, yeah, YEAH). I like to think of it as a real reminder of home cooked food - something that I had lost in the fray of all the great different ethnic eats Toronto has to offer. Like a really good pair of old shoes. Listen, I'm not comparing the food to old shoes, just the comfort I get from it.

I love the classic breakfast. It's all the pieces you'd expect from a breakfast special at say, a diner, but everything is done so much better. The eggs are cooked to order properly and taste fresher than eggs generally do, the roasted new potatoes are of nice family dinner quality, the fresh baked bread (rye, white, and honey oat usually) are fluffy and perfect. The meat. This is where I've had the best breakfast bacon in Toronto. No joke. It's thick cut and it's perfect. Bacon that needs some knife action every once in a while. If you decide to go sausage....you get a sausage patty! This ain't no tube sausage. Everything is made in house and you can taste it.

Best part, the best breakfast special in TO only costs $10. So get up to St. Clair and Oakwood(ish) and have a breakfast that you'll really enjoy."}
{"text":"This has become my favourite restaurant to have Brunch in Toronto. The service has always been warm and welcoming, regardless if the restaurant is empty or if there is a line up to outside the door. 

Please do yourself a favour and order a buttermilk biscuit."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend shared the two egg breakfast and the French toast. 

This was our second time here and although we waited close to an hour both times, the wait was well worth it. The staff is very friendly and the service is quick. 

The scrambled eggs were light and fluffy and the bacon was cooked to perfection. We added the biscuit to the meal which was a wise decision on our part. The French toast was not your typical French toast but still delicious. We left very satisfied."}
{"text":"Great service. Delicious food. 

Leek and potato soup was homey and wholesome tasting. I had the best vegetarian burger ever here. With their homemade bun with black beans and corn patty with house mayo. Soo good. Definitely going back for their famous biscut!"}
{"text":"We live in the neighbourhood and will come for weekend breakfast at least twice a month. The trick is either to come 15-20 minutes before opening, or to know when to catch the lulls between waves of customers. Either way, for us, it's worth it. Just suggest to my 5-year-old that we might be heading to \"Emma's\" for breakfast and she's already up and getting dressed. 

The signature items here for us are definitely the buttermilk biscuits and the quiche. I don't think I've ever encountered a place that does either one any better. And then take that biscuit and layer it with Benny toppings...? Ohhhhhhh... (Pro tip: ease your dieter's guilt by ordering a side Benny: half the size, all the flavour!)

The quiche is different each time, favouring seasonal veg as much as possible. It is creamy and fluffy at the same time, with wonderful height and a flaky crust. Side salads are always winners, with tasty dressings and good, solid ingredients like quinoa or toasted sesame seeds to give some heft to the bowl. 

Pancakes are also seasonal: in fall, they will be pumpkin. In winter, gingerbread. Don't forget to smear them heavily with the provided citrus butter. You won't even need the maple syrup, but you'll want to take advantage of it when most places give you table syrup unless you pay extra.

I haven't even mentioned the donuts yet. If you don't get there during the first waves, though, you'll have missed your chance, as they sell out quickly. Our favorites include Emma's standards, maple bacon and cinnamon sugar, but there are always fun and inventive flavours, again mirroring the season (yesterday's pick came with crushed candy cane sprinkled atop a dark chocolate glaze).

For carnivores, the thick, savoury bacon is worth every streaky, crispy bite. I'm less a fan of the sausage, but that's just because I'm a bacon gal at heart, and also the seasonings in the sausage aren't my fave. But if you like a fragrant, handmade sausage patty, you'll appreciate it. 

I'm so glad to have this cheerful, reliably yummy spot in the 'hood, and it warms my soul to see a little local place ring up so many kudos (and queues!)."}
{"text":"Amazing Brunch and really good value. Portions are generous so be hungry. We both had the classic with poached eggs and bacon and an extra side of eggs and sausage which we shared. We were absolutely stuffed leaving. Staff are friendly and attentive. This was our first time and I've no doubt we will be regulars to this place soon."}
{"text":"I spend too much money on this place. Way to much money.. I come here every week, and I don't think I'll stop.

This place is usually packed on weekends so if you plan to go be ready for a wait. If it's for 2 it's not that bad about 15 mins, but if it's 3 or more be prepared to wait at least half an hour.

The eggs benny here is what most people recommend but I say just go for a classic and get both the homemade sausage and bacon. The toast is amazing, perfectly buttered and toasted. The sea salt and thyme roasted red skin potatoes are the best potatoes I've ever had. The onion and sage sausage is mouth watering but the best, by far the best is their house-cured bacon. Crispy with a perfect blend of savory and sweet, it just melts in your mouth."}
{"text":"If it was possible I would give this place a 0. I decided to take my wife out for a Saturday morning breakfast as she didn't have to work. We were told the wait would be about 45 mins and our names were taken. We decided to stay and wait inside as it was cold and raining out. But as we approached the front of the line as time went on, we noticed that there were a number of empty tables and the bar was completely empty. Pretty much everyone said they'd take the bar seats if it was faster. Finally after about 45 mins wait we saw a lady and her young daughter get taken to the bar which had been empty for about 30 mins. The couple in front of us were next and were asked if they would sit at the bar, but elected to wait for a table. They also noticed a number of empty tables and asked the waitress, those tables look empty, can't we just sit there? The waitress said they just needed to \"set the table up\" before they could seat them there... I found this odd. After an hour we were tired of waiting, and seeing as only 2 of the 6 bar seats were taken, we asked politely, can't we just sit at the bar now since we were only like 3rd on the list. They said there were a couple people ahead of us... meanwhile I had noticed a table of 4 with a high chair had been vacant for the last 30 mins. And then the lady in front who seemed to be in charge of this unorganized establishment said to the couple waiting with a baby if they were waiting for a table with a high chair and just took them in... finally... it was our turn and we were escorted to a table in the back, when I sat down I noticed 4 empty tables back here?! I was extremely puzzled as to why this place has a 1 hour+ wait when they have 30-40% of the seating available at all times... I am never coming back to this place again and I wish everyone reads this before they waste 1-1.5 hours of their life waiting for an empty seat that is deemed worthy to be filled by the lady up front. This has to be one of the most unorganized restaurants I've ever been to. 

The one positive thing I can say is that the server was very nice and fast. Oh btw... we ordered a classic breakfast, a benny breakfast and two coffees... the food is mediocre. Maybe it's just the bad taste left in my mouth from waiting so long when there were empty seats all a long."}
{"text":"The allure of this place is the homey-ness of the menu, I think. Personally, it's WAY too loud in there for me on a weekend. I did, however, enjoy the quiche I had. It was creamy and full of veggies. We got some donuts to take with us and they were pretty average compared to other ones I've had around the city."}
{"text":"Whether it's getting that incredible breakfast sandwich for takeout or stopping in for brunch on the weekend, Emma's is a favourite!"}
{"text":"One of the best brunch places I've ever been to!
Sometimes you have to wait because it gets busy right from the first minute of opening, but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"This place come with a lot of HYPE, and I'm happy to say that Emma's Country Kitchen holds up!

After a 1.5 hour wait, which was made better by a jaunt around the neighbourhood, we finally got a table. They only seat full parties, so when your time comes, BE READY.

We got a delicious plate of pumpkin spice pancakes for the table. It is a seasonal item, but it should be a fixture. It came with these praline-like nuts strewn inside, and the whole cake situation was very melt-in-your-mouth. As for my personal meal, I got the burger and it was also juicy, fresh, delectable. Perfectly melted cheese on a fluffy bun makes this girl a happy girl. 

Since we were there quite late, the last of the doughnuts were on special! Pro tip to latecomers, get in on these dealz. You will not be sorry."}
{"text":"My visit was quite a rollercoaster of confusing reality vs expectations discovery

Emmas country Kitchen seems to be incrusted in the Torontonian Brunch culture so far deep, no one want to admit is kitchen is quite dated and well. Average.

The Breakwich, this breakfast sandwiche served on a thick blend dry biscuit, so thick it takes away all the potential flavours from the cheddar or eggs. 

The Blueberry and Lemon Ricotta Pancake are better, the pancake base is fluffy and tasty but the toppings missed the mark, thick and inconsistent  texture is huge problem for a restaurant in competition with restaurant like Portland around.

Emmas country kitchen live off their greatness from the past and customer cant admit it havent subsist and cant let go..."}
{"text":"+ Fluffy whipped ricotta + lemon juice and zest 
+ Ready to queue!
+ A little out of the way but worth a visit 


Emma's Country Kitchen is a GREAT brunch spot in Toronto. The restaurant looks like a bakery from the outside. Inside is small but packed with diners chatting away and tucking into gorgeous looking eggs bennies and pancakes. 
The waiters were friendly and helpful. I went for wild blueberry and ricotta pancakes. I'm not a big fan of mixing berries (or any fruit, to that matter) in pancake mix*. But as a self-appointed pancake enthusiast, I had to see how it's done this side of the border. The pancakes were served with 'whipped lemon ricotta'. It's basically whipped ricotta cheese with a fresh squeeze of lemon juice. The ricotta mix was such a delight. It was airy, fluffy and full of zing. I don't know if whipped ricotta was a thing. I wish I had come up with it! But I will certainly try this at home. The ricotta mix itself wasn't very sweet so there was plenty of room for 'real maple syrup', as the menu proudly claimed. I wasn't impressed by how they mixed blueberries in the pancake, but the whipped ricotta was truly delightful. Emma's Country Kitchen is a little out of the way from Downtown Toronto but worth a visit. 

*Disclosure: I am something of a purist when it comes to baking. Adding berries to pancake mix, or raisins to scones (!) only demonstrates poor judgment on the baker's part, and perhaps, a misguided pursuit to score an easy win with novelty factor. I tend to think the real challenge is sticking to a simple recipe and execute perfectly."}
{"text":"Really good brunch food.  They cure their own bacon and it is good!  They are the only place that can cook eggs the way I like.  Great homemade quiche options and their signature buttermilk biscuits are better than anywhere!  Good teas.  Excellent service as well."}
{"text":"Just ate here today, food is overpriced, very little portion. Paid 11 dollars for their classic breakfast that comes with only two stripes of bacon, or 3 little mini sausages (kids size). The biscuits are stone cold. This is the first and last time I will be here."}
{"text":"I have been a huge fan and supporter since they opened, but today I was really disappointed. Bacon should not be so brittle that it shatters when you touch it. I don't know why restaurants insist on pre-cooking it, but I was really disappointed that it was like eating petrified pork. 

The breakfast potatoes used to be delicious and flavourful and today they were bland and seemed deep-fried?  Also it seems stingy that they charge for jam.

I will continue to support them but hope they give some thought to freshly preparing and not incinerating one of the best indulgences about brunch."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times and each time it was either closed or they were on vacation. When I finally got a seat in which I had to wait 40 mins for, the staff tells me they're out of eggs Benny (the only reason we're there) an hour before brunch ends. Been trying to eat here for 2 years now and I still can't tell you what it's like. Nothing against the food but the experience hasn't been pleasant."}
{"text":"I went to Emma's Country Kitchen with a friend one Friday morning and I loved it. The service was amazing and the food was so delicious! I was especially fond of the blueberry pancakes and wish I'd ordered an entire stack, but instead, I asked to modify my order. The server kindly obliged me since it was a weekday and the sunny side-up eggs and sausage were good. The restaurant was clean and it has a quiet charm that made my experience that much better. I'd definitely recommend it!"}

If you're looking for a great brunch in a cute (but non-typical cute) place, Emma's Country Kitchen is THE place. 

I came with some work friends during a weekday. First mistake, as I learned that the eggs benedict is not available during the weekday. However this hindered my experience only for a brief moment. And then the food arrived. 

I ordered the \"Breakwich\" which as you probably can tell, is a breakfast sandwich. They serve it on their famous, and amazingly buttery, biscuit. No joke this thing melts in your mouth. Satisfying to the final bite, I would say go for it and order 5 if you feel like it. 

The breakwich came with a side. I don't remember exactly what my side was, but I split it with my friend who gave me half of her zucchini salad. The salad was perfectly light and fresh and helped with the guilt of devouring the breakwich in 5.3 seconds. 

I also grabbed a loaf of bread on the way out. This baby had just come out of the oven and literally steamed up by the time I got back to the office. I'm talking condensation and all that. 

For the cherry on top, we happened to spot John Catucci, from You Gotta Eat Here, just casually enjoying a meal. He wasn't filming, so we took it as it's somewhere he sincerely enjoys. And hey, if it's good enough for John, it's good enough for us!

THE BOTTOM LINE: the unbelievable biscuit will lure you back, and you'll more than gladly oblige."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Like the show, \"You gotta eat here\", YOU GOTTA EAT HERE! Everything is made with love. Seriously! You can taste it in every bit. Cheesy I know. There was however cheese on my breakfast sandwich which was absolutely delicious. An over easy egg and avocado I substituted instead of bacon, adorned between two fresh buttermilk biscuits was an ultimate Home Simpson drool moment. 

I, of course, also wanted the gingerbread pancakes(another Homer Simpson drool moment) and I was pleased to hear that I was able to enjoy both (why I love them even more). I had my pancakes as a side rather than a main which came with 2 pancakes instead of 3. I was extremely pleased. They also sell loaves of bread that they make in house, so I bought a loaf of Rye. I think I finished 3/4 of it on my own it was so delicious.

Emma's Country Kitchen is a whole lot of country in a big city, serving fresh food with a whole lotta love."}
{"text":"So fresh and delicious. Great homemade, cafe feel. I continue to go back. However, the past couple times I've been there they are always out of the item I want. I respect that this happens, it just makes me sad."}
{"text":"The food was excellent. Cozy little place. I would definitely go again but only if it was very early in the morning.
It does get busy later in the morning."}
{"text":"Hold the phone! Just came from breakfast with my family. Two eggs over easy, perfectly cooked, possibly the best bacon (cured there) I have ever had, sinfully good buttermilk biscuit, freshly squeezed orange juice, home made jam, whipped butter, fresh red potatoes. Coffee was good but could have been hotter. Service was very quick and friendly. Price reasonable given quality of the food.

We will be back!

We keep coming back for more! Best Benny on the planet, no discussion, no debate, no contest...could eat it every day for the rest of my life."}
{"text":"First taste of Canada and I absolutely loved it! After getting off of my flight from California I was in need of breakfast to get my trip started. The food was so good! & the staff were extremely nice and helpful with being patient and making great suggestions. Our server Brian explained the foods and how they were comparable to the foods in America. I will definitely be back! I ordered Emma's Benny which was made on a biscuit, so yummy. My mother ordered the pancake with ricotta which was very delicious. & my sister ordered the biscuits and gravy. I can honestly say you cannot go wrong with these three dishes. Can't wait to go back and try something else as well. Cheers!"}
{"text":"I came here for brunch on mother's day and it wasn't as packed as most people claim. i arrived at 1:30 and my friend and i were seated right away. 

i ordered the french toast with a side of sausage. the french toast was AMAZING with the vanilla custard and maple syrup! I also got a side of sausage and it comes on a patty-like serving vs. a typical log sausage...i'm pretty sure they're home-made which made it even better. so good! i would definitely come back here but i would say the portions are smaller than what i'm used to for brunch places. I finished my entire plate (which is rare)! maybe i was just hungry though..."}
{"text":"Great options though very limited. Loved semi-sweet taste of the egg Bennies' bread and the taste of the coffee."}
{"text":"My current go-to brunch spot!  Despite the ~30+ minutes wait each time (no resos taken), it's Emma's Benny that keeps bringing me back.

Perfectly poached eggs perch on bacon (strip kind over peameal, please - FYI no additional costs for this sub), enrobed with a light, mousseline hollandaise.  Erm, as light as hollandaise can be, anyway.  I think the best part is the fluffy house-made buttermilk biscuit on the bottom.  They really do make a huge difference; usually I'd eat around the English muffin below the eggy goodness, but at Emma's it's actually one of the parts I look forward to. 

I also really enjoy the dulche-de-leche filled beignets, generously dusted with icing sugar.  They're usually sold out by the time we go in the afternoons, but if you get the chance to try them I'd recommend this rare treat!

Also appreciate the casual feel of Emma's, it's actually casual yet comfy, without being hisptery (although hipster places also have a place in my foodie heart).  That same foodie heart is telling me to go to Emma's again soon..."}

One of the best Brunch places in Toronto, not just because of the food, but because of the atmosphere. Not pretentious or trying too hard, but great service and great food. I've been here a handful of times and the food is always consistent. 

Important note: yes there is a wait. If it's brunch on a weekend, it's a wait for a table. Any of the top brunch spots in Toronto will have a wait, and this spot if not immune. Yes, it may take up to an hour. However, they do take your name and number down, and you're welcome to go run errands or grab a coffee while you wait for a table.  

One of my favourite items hands down is the Breakwich. A biscuit sandwiching a perfectly cooked lightly runny egg, cheese (swiss or cheddar) and meat (sausage or bacon). This sandwich is the epitome of breakfast sandwiches, I doubt I'll ever find anything better. 

I also recommend the blueberry pancakes or the eggs Benedict. If you're particularly adventurous, I would suggest getting the pancakes to share, and adding a side of eggs Benedict and the Breakwich to have the best of everything! The presentation was clean and not over the top, just enough to make you want to devour the food. 

In the front bakery display, they have donuts, which are made only on weekends, and once they sell out, they're gone for the day. I had the pleasure of taking home the Triple Chocolate, the maple bacon and the apple and blueberry donut. Personal favourite was the triple chocolate (oreo crumble on top? yes!). I'm not a donut person, but these donuts are fantastic. 

The service here was great. Even though there is a wait, they are very considerate and patient, taking down names and numbers and letting customers come back later to grab their seats. Even though we had a large party, they never rushed us to order or finish our meals to fill seats, which was really appreciated. The overall cleanliness of the restaurant was spot on."}
{"text":"Great breakfast sandwiches on the cheap. Bacon is excellent. Table side service is excellent, but the wait at the door can be a nightmare. Come early and leave your name, coffee's across the street. Expect to wait if you're a large party."}
{"text":"I like it. I will be back again with my friends. The waitress was very nice with us. Very affordable place. The portions are reasonable big."}
{"text":"We had their beignets, cobb salad and eggs benedict.  Beware - they run out of their beignets by noon-1pmish.  If you want to try it, get there early.  It's worth waking up early for.  Their eggs benny on a biscuits are good enough to make up for the alcohol-free brunch.  Don't let the pics of the cobb salad fool you.  It is flavorful.  There are little bits of goodness so it lends the perfect amount of bacon flavor without all the guilt.  Save the guilt for the beignets."}
{"text":"Went on a two day trip to Toronto with my boyfriend from the states and came across this place.  The coffee was really good and they served a little container of milk with it which I liked.  We both ordered their basic breakfast: eggs, bacon, home fries, and upgraded to the giant house-made biscuit. Everything was very good! The biscuit came with house-made mixed berry jam which was amazing. The bacon was very thick. Home fries were crispy.  The only complaint I have is that they served the biscuit cold, not warmed or toasted."}
{"text":"I had a delicious breakfast here yesterday and couldn't wait to write this review. We dropped by around 11am on Sunday and the place was packed! We were told to expect a 30-45 minute wait but ended up grabbing a window seat within 10 minutes which wasn't too bad.

Our server took our order promptly, and informed us that they were out of peameal bacon so our Eggs Benedict couldn't come as intended. He gave us a choice of strip bacon or sausage, we chose bacon. Although we understand that supplies can run out, I'm not sure how a breakfast/lunch restaurant can run out of peameal by 11am on a Sunday!

That aside, our breakfast was really delicious. The home fries are to die for and the rosemary really adds to the flavour. I found the hollandaise sauce a little on the watery side but the eggs were cooked to perfection. The presentation was great and their orange juice is also freshly squeezed and had just the right amount of sweetness.

A solid four stars for Emma's County Kitchen, and I can't wait to drop by for breakfast again soon."}
{"text":"First timer after all the great reviews. Nice brunch.  Had Eggs Benny and Classic eggs and fresh squeezed OJ. Eggs Benny was perfect. Biscuits are made in-house and were perfect. Great peameal and their version of hollandaise. OJ was actually fresh squeezed and for $4 for a large well worth it. Also bought some great looking donuts and biscuits for later on. Expect to wait but they take your phone number and call when your table is ready so you can roam the streets. Enjoy a relaxing meal as it takes a bit of time to get everything. Don't be in a rush ... life will pass you by."}
{"text":"While the food at Emma's is great, my two experiences reveal flawed customer service. I'd give 2 1/2 stars if I could because the food is great... if you get any.

My first experience, I took an out of town guests. We arrived, on a Sunday morning in February, the coldest of the year - just after the last table was given away. We ended up first on the wait list, and stood off to the side. As more people arrived, they were put on the wait list... and when the minuscule waiting area was full, my friend and I - the first on the wait list - were asked first of anyone to wait outside. We left. (Aside: We went to a different place a block away, and we're seated right away, and enjoyed a delicious brunch.)

My second experience was better, likely because I was there alone and agreed to sit at the counter in the front window... except I was crowded by people waiting who, funny enough, were not asked to wait outside on the coldest day of the year. Anyway, the food was great, the service was OK, but I decided other places are more accommodating."}
{"text":"This place is heavenly. Get the breakfast sandwich on a biscuit.  Incredible and very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast/brunch spot. You can order half a egg Benedict. I usually get a coffee, a donut (so good!) and a side Benedict. I like the idea that I get to taste different things and not overeat. Their bakery is pretty good. The eggs Benedict are on their homemade butter scone. They only have donuts on weekends. I love the bacon maple syrup flavour. They also have free wifi. And the coffee is from reunion islands!"}
{"text":"The food at this place was divine but unfortunately the layout isn't too great in the sense that they really cater to two people. There's only three tables that fit more than 2 capped at 4. On a Saturday at 1130 it was crazy busy and we waited an hour to get seated just passed 1230 at 1245. Thankfully there was Stella's lunchbox across the road to grab some coffees and biscottis (see my review there :)) any who my brother and his gf
Got the eggs Benedict which looked divine on buttermilk biscuits and sides of redskin potatoes which were delicious as I had those as my side with my quiche. The quiche changes daily and I'm a sucker for quiche of omelettes (didn't see those on menu). Quiche was sweet potato leek and cheddar cheese which I inhaled. Overall it was really good as long as you are committed to waiting! Will come
Again on a weekday to try their veggie burger. Also they make 24 donuts a day and we love Donuts But apparently a guy came in an bought 12 and his friend bought the other 12 like total assholes. Or maybe Emma's should start making more than 24...."}
{"text":"God this place is so amazing that I couldn't stop thinking about it until I went back . 

I tried the pancake - you must try this . It is the best pancake I have ever tried . 

Benny - wow - it's really amazing . I highly suggest you try this.

Come : don't take reservation and usually a 40-60 minutes of waiting time . So prepared for that . 

They also have nice food to go , so you can do some shopping , their service is really amazing ."}
{"text":"Everything is always so fresh and they are not afraid to put unique items on the menu, which is updated daily (think corn and black bean fritter sandwich and salmon cakes in a neighbourhood known for pizza and pasta) 
With simple decor and great home cooking they've achieved what they set out to do. 
Oh,  and don't miss the award winning homemade doughnuts on the weekends!"}
{"text":"Fresh food and best eggs benny i had , go early in the morning to avoid line up , this place is always packed for a good reason."}
{"text":"I love this place so much. The wait is worth it every time. Not just for the food, but for the consistently lovely service. They don't take reservations for brunch, but you can leave your name and number and they'll let you know when your table is ready. 

They have your classic brunch offerings, but you can tell they cook everything with love in that kitchen. It just tastes a cut above other places. Also, they make fresh donuts which I sometimes get while we're waiting for our table. Get them early because they sell out. 

I'm partial to their biscuits and gravy served with soft scrambled eggs. It's just so homey and good. You can get a slice of their great oatmeal cake for $2. They can make substitutions for vegetarians. Also, their waiters are so friendly. They keep us coming back."}
{"text":"This place is a classic! I have been too many times to keep count and this place never gets old! 

The atmosphere is sort of loud and there is not a lot of tables so expect to wait if you are not lined up 30 minutes before opening on the weekend. If you are stuck waiting, be sure to grab a donut because I promise they are well worth it! 

The service is usually pretty good! Most of the time I can flag someone down if there is something we need or want to add onto our order. I only think once I had the experience of not receiving a refill on my coffee thoroughout my dining.

The food is amazing. They serve a wide variety of delicious meats, sweets, beverages, the classic works to satisfy your breakfast/brunch needs! Get the pancakes as I'm sure they will make you smile from ear to ear!"}
{"text":"The staff here is so friendly, and I have been here for the traditional breakfast which was delicious.

The only reason I give this place 3 stars is because on my most recent experience I ordered takeout and there was a hair in my food! So disappointing and unappetizing. Because it was takeout I couldn't even bring it back, it was a real bummer. Besides this experience I would definitely recommend Emma's if you're in the neighbourhood and not looking to go to a downtown brunch spot."}
{"text":"Not much to complain about except for the size, but they had a sign up saying they are expanding. We were a group of 5, so took some time to get seated. Waiters were very nice, one looked just like Brad Dourif in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.
If you go here, do yourselves a favor, and get their buttermilk biscuit. It is delicious. I had the breakwich, along with a piece banana nut cake. Their coffee was nice and strong as well. My dad had the veggie burger and said it was good. Mom had the same as me, she really liked the biscuit. Sis had the classic, she gave the place a thumbs up. And my gf tried their yogurt parfait (I tried some), and it was really good. We also had a side of frites. I would recommend."}
{"text":"Everything delicious. Great service. Worth the wait if there is a line. Benny was ridiculous mousseline sauce... oh baby yes!"}
{"text":"Great quality ingredients and tasty dishes but just not worth the wait. 50m for 2ppl at 10am. HALF the tables were empty (see pic) when we finally sat down yet there was a line out the door and a 50m wait.  Why??!  It makes no sense.

Pancakes are just as good as Mildred's Temple Kitchen. Bacon was dry like it was sitting under a heat lamp all morning but admittedly tasty. Sausage patties were bland and undercooked. Toast was not toasted, just warm bread. Potatoes were not crispy as the menu claimed, but again, tasty with a hint of rosemary and salt. Earl Grey Hot Toddy was delicious. Servers are always friendly if you can get past the sour and inexplicably rude counter staff."}
{"text":"If I lived around the area I would have given a higher rating. It's a good neighborhood spot but not a place you would go out of your way to visit. The food is good don't get me wrong. But considering it's just good not great, the place is too small to accomodate kids with comfort, the wait is too long, and the prices aren't cheap... you get the picture. Not worth all the hassle.

I have to say that the donuts are a bit overrated and overpriced. The texture of the donut was a bit disappointing. for a $3 donut I was expecting something out of this world that melts in your mouth. What I got was basically the texture of any fried bread I got in the philippines where I pay $1 and get 10 of them."}
{"text":"Great pancakes.. Horrible queue management. 

The pancakes are some of the best I've had. Light, fluffy, and doesn't have a batter-like texture. 

Agree with previous reviews on queue management. Queue management is HORRIBLE each and every time I've been. Mostly recently, got there at 9:20 (20 mins after opening) with a line up to the door and half the tables are deliberately empty..  Still waited 40 mins. Either they are seriously short staffed or they want to build up the hype. I've waited over an hour in previous trips where they're deliberately not clearing off tables. 

Please come here if you have a warm jacket and wanting to start your weekend morning off looking at half empty tables as you freeze your butt off."}
{"text":"I came here after seeing this restaurant on You Gotta Eat Here. The cinnamon bun pancakes were phenomenal! All their donuts are hefty, flavorful and unforgettable. I would definitely recommend having at least 1 donut with your order. I will be coming back! The only down side was that we had to wait 1 hour to place our order, but once we did, the food came within 15 minutes. People were lining up outside just to get in."}
{"text":"best peameal bacon and biscuit I've ever had...the bacon donut was also amazing, as was the coffee.  Wife had the French toast, and it was great, but not amazing.  5 stars!"}
{"text":"For food only, this place is the best.  But given that they are now asking their customers to fund their staff benefit plan, I'm done."}
{"text":"A small little place but Good food! Would recommend. Buttermilk biscuit is worth the extra dollar! Great service, would come again."}
{"text":"As what i always say when i experience good food! Its \"amnesialicious\" once you tried there food you'll forget your name for a short time:), that's how good their food is. The only 2 people i know there is Heather and Lora, they are the best! The place is small and always packed on weekends w/c we always go. They always accommodate everyone and they know how to take care of their customers. This place is awesome! You have to go and experience the ultimate food goodness of brunchin\":)."}
{"text":"Emma's Country Kitchen has been a mainstay for the St. Clair West Village community since 2012.  They are known for their country buttermilk biscuits and maple bacon doughnuts.  I hate waiting in line for anything and came here right at 8 AM sharp.  The early bird gets the worm is definitely apropos.  I was seated immediately, ordered my breakfast and within 7 minutes it arrived. 

The Classic consisted of 2 eggs, home fries seasoned with thyme/salt, 2 irregularly shaped homemade sage/onion sausage patties and their famous buttermilk biscuit with strawberry jam on the side.  Everything was made from scratch and nothing was processed or store bought.  The sausage was a lot leaner than I would like & under seasoned, potatoes forgettable but the buttermilk biscuit was light, airy, buttery and went well with the homemade strawberry jam.  Overall a solid breakfast.  My other complaint is the biscuit could have been served warm rather than cold but the taste kinda made up for it.  Can't forget to mention their coffee was exceptional, even better than Starbucks...blasphemy I know, but it's true!  Server was very attentive but not in the intrusive way.  I would come back & try their blueberry pancake with ricotta but not wait in line for it."}
{"text":"We waited approximately 40 minutes for a table for 2 and that's basically considered good for Toronto brunch so we were not complaining. Once seated, we ordered the Memories of the Farm French Toast, Eggs Benny and a side sammie and home fries.

Everything was so good and tasty! Portion sizes were very generous and we were told that we had one of the last french toasts left.... which probably means that you should come early because lots of items on the menu seems to be limited in quantities. 

They had run out of all their donuts by the time we walked in the restaurant so we didn't get to try any of their baked goods. 

The prices were great taking into consideration how much food we got and service was great and quick!

We will come back although it is a little out of the way but worth the trip. HIghly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is busy and we waited for about 45 mins for a table for 2. Worth the wait though!

I got their BLT sandwich and added an egg to it - so, so, soooo good! Perfectly cooked egg that had a little runny yolk. My bf got the eggs benny on biscuit which he loved. 

We missed out on the delicious donuts (but truthfully we were so full). Service is great and quick. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"It's alright. Worth an hour or more of waiting on a cold day? No way!  It's alright brunch, pretty decent and fresh biscuits but nothing to get excited about. Had the classic breakfast--pretty standard stuff. A lot more creative options not far away."}
{"text":"Had the B.L.T and the beignets. The muse had the side Benny and breakfast sandwich on a biscuit with the sausage patty.  Oh my god the sausage patty. It's all about that sage! Tastes like Christmas morning.  Everything was outstanding! Will definitely be back. Best breakfast in the city."}
{"text":"Emma's used to be the location for one of my fav Haitian restaurants so when that closed down and this opened up, I was definitely curious. 

The wait was standard 45/ 1 hr for Toronto brunch but the line moved fast-ish. Staff is superb here. Pretty Asian lady with tats served us and she was very friendly and topped up our coffee and water often.

A few bonuses here: they have mayo options with different flavours!!! They make their own hot sauce ($0.50) and worth the splurge although it wasn't quite 'hot' it was very flavourful. 

We got the I know what you did last night burger, quiche of the day and Eggs Benny replacing the meat with avocado. Everything was delish but I didn't feel like I wanted more. My date wished his English muffins were a bit more toasted. Potatoes were fantastic."}
{"text":"Yesterday i was on Emmma's Country Kitchen for breakfast. I got best service always from this restaurant but yesterday it's make little bit unsatisfied because it's late while few times. Its not an big issue i think. Hope next time will be okay :)"}
{"text":"Awesome!!!  Eggs do not usually impress me, but their classic breakfast blew me away. 
Biscuit is a must!  The sausage is an must try!!! 

Sooo good!!!"}
{"text":"What a lovely breakfast spot! It felt  like u were in someone's home kitchen. So quaint and personal I love it! It is quite a small place so the service can be quite relaxed, but on a calm chill morning this place will do you right! I love the set up inside with the wooden booths which makes your outing feel more private and comfortable and cozy. The servers are all very sweet and friendly, and handle a busy crowd very well. My breakfast special of eggs sausage and toast was only 10 dollars and 12 w coffee is a great deal for what feels like a home cooked meal :)! The eggs were almost creamy tasting and the sausage had great flavour.. I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Had the the classic with biscuit substitution and an addition of sausage and baked beans. The baked beans...The baked beans are the best! Soooo yummy! Unfortunately, I was disappointed by the biscuits that they are so famous for. I don't know, they were just ok. In their defense though, I was comparing them to the biscuits at Mildred's Temple Kitchen and it did not match up at all. 

However, I enjoyed every bite of my breakfast. The sausage was different and very yummy. The coffee was in my top 5 for sure! 

Wait times are crazy..  Had to wait 45mins on a Saturday morning... Well worth the wait though!"}
{"text":"Long wait?  Perhaps.  Worth it?  Definitely.   I love the French Toast and eggs benny. If you're patient this is the spot for you."}
{"text":"Great breakfast (ginger pancakes and eggs benny)! Fast service, delicious food and simple but solid breakfast/brunch menu. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"A better spot than the starving artist, Emma's country kitchen is a decent brunch spot in a brunch spot crazy city. The menu has the usual standards like eggs Benny and french toast but everything is done with an eye towards local ingredients and freshness. 

The spot is light and airy and the service was good, despite the fact that it tends to get crowded at peak brunch times."}
{"text":"I went to this place in the morning, setting my hope high after seeing all the great comments in yelp. This place is decent with decent brunch. I tried Emma's Benny, good but not amazing, maybe because I have a sweet tooth. The best part was their soft biscuit. But would like to come back again to try the farm French toast. 

Please avoid the long line wait if you can. I went there at around 11, was told I had to wait for half an hour. Glad when I came back after 20 min, a seat was available. Obviously, this place is very popular on st clair ave w."}
{"text":"Delicious Brunch and the service was top notch . One of my new favourite brunch spots. The portion sizes were perfect. Word to the wise go before noon if you to experience begniets and their donuts. Decor was cute and very homey just added to the whole experience"}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast/brunch. 

I came here on a Sunday for a 9am early (!) brunch. Emma's opens at 9 sharp, and there were people already hovering just outside their door. We soon organized into a line with smiling, eager faces. To me, a line anywhere at 9am on a Sunday tells me the food is going to be great. 

Food and service did not disappoint. I had the Breakwich and a side fruit salad, my friends had the Classic & another Breakwich. We all felt like the food was spectacular and wanted to come back again. 

Simple, fresh, tasty food. Even their tea was good. 

Pretty accessible by TTC and with side street parking for those with a car."}
{"text":"I read Emma's Country Kitchen as being one of the top brunch places in the GTA region. So I hopped on the subway and made my way down to the beautiful neighbourhood of St Clair and walked down to the restaurant. The place was packed at 1:30 pm - and there was a 30 min wait before we were seated. We got to check out local thrift shops an a coffee shop closeby (Zaza Espresso bar-totally worth checking out). As I explored the cute country style decor on the walls, I enjoyed that the business also had ready made frozen foods for sale. 
The staff was so friendly at this place - that really made this kitchen stand out. 

I really enjoyed my food here. I ordered a mimosa for 9$ that was made with their freshly squeeze orange juice. I have never tried a mimosa with fresh juice - but this was heavenly and so light. For my main - I tried Emma's Benny- the buttermilk biscuits topped with two soft poached eggs and mousseline sauce melted in my mouth. I appreciated the fact it wasnt too heavy either. The Peameal bacon was an interesting texture (never tried it) that complimented well with the meal. I couldn't finish my potatoes! I do think they could have been more generous with their fruit portions!

I wish I had more room to try their signature donuts, next time!"}
{"text":"I was in the area so I decided to give it a try. I have been reading all the wonderful reviews on how fantastic this place is.  Well when I went in it was pretty busy for a weekday afternoon. The good thing was I didn't have to wait so long. But is was so busy that the waiter took a while before I got served.  I was facing the kitchen and those guys are really put to work.  Everyone's food looked delicious so I couldn't wait to try mine.  I had the eggs and sausage with a biscuit.  The eggs tasted a bit odd.  I don't know what they added to the eggs. Maybe some kind of spice.  I don't know. Everyone on here seemed to brag about how wonderful the biscuits were.  They were ok nothing special.  I don't see what the hype is about this place.  I wasn't impressed with the sausages.  They were these flat round patty sausages you can buy at the grocery store. This place is nothing to brag about.  It is stuff I can make at home and would taste a lot better.  I wasn't impressed.  What I didn't like was the waiter never came by to ask how I liked my food nor did he even come by to get payment from me.  I had to call another waiter over so I could pay for my food. Overall it was ok but nothing special.

I definitely don't understand why anyone in there right mind would wait an hour to have breakfast at this place.  That is just frigging crazy.  It is definitely not worth the hype.  Not a place that I would go back again."}
{"text":"Service
It was fine, normal stuff. I have nothing to add lols.

Parking
I pray you know how to parallel park (look for Green P signs).

Food
You come here for the FOOD and I say this because brunch/breakfast here is godly. First of all, the classic breakfast IS AMAZING. I almost ordered it but opted for the quiche because it looked so good online. The quiche is not bad but I think it would have tasted better with spinach, perhaps I'm not a big fan of squash. The sides/pastry of the quiche is very crunchy and is super tasty. The content (egg and squash) are okay, but not something I would eat again. For the side, I chose quinoa and I kind of regretted it because it felt a bit dry. The dish itself was fine, but nothing mind-blowing. Now we move onto the big breakfast...it was stellar. To start, the eggs look like perfection. The scrambled eggs were organized and didn't look all spread out on the dish. It was also fluffy when I tasted it, they probably used milk (?) and cooked it at the right temperature and time. The bacon is so big, not a lot of fat, and the right amount of crispiness on the sides. The potatoes, sooooooo good. This dish is the bomb (a happy kind of explosion in the mouth!).

*I just want to add that the menus do change (not sure if it's a daily basis). Their famous donuts are not available on weekdays and from what I've heard it is super packed on weekends. I do plan on coming back for these though lol.*"}
{"text":"I love small shops like these, especially breakfast joints!! 

This is the first place we tried and Toronto and really really loved it! I was starving and wanted two meals but had seen someone eating this on my way in and I am huge biscuit fan, so had to get this!

I got an open face biscuit with gravy on top and two scrambled eggs on the side and let me tell you, it was DELICIOUS! Hit the spot. The price was amazing and the staff was great toO!!!"}
{"text":"I came here purely based on positive yelp reviews, and I can see why it was rated so highly - very nice staff from what I can tell, and big servings of delicious breakfast food!

I had the benny on a country biscuit, and that biscuit was no joke. Totally melts in your mouth. My friend got a burger, which he enjoyed as well. The only downside is that it is quite a small place that's very popular, so be prepared to wait a bit for a table, and some of the tables come with high bar stools instead of chairs that don't provide any back support. Not the most comfortable meal, but it certainly was delicious."}
{"text":"you Torontonians are the most pretentious people on earth. these reviews are BS

i've eaten there. it's fine. no issues.

certainly not worthy of the praise it gets here tho. TO people love to be cool. 

sad"}
{"text":"Had the bean veggie burger with carrot coconut soup for lunch. Everything was made from scratch and fresh tasting... definitely going back, especially for the quiche & pumpkin pancakes. Service was good too... based on my experience, I was surprised to read the many bad service reviews on here."}
{"text":"If you want to comfort yourself via food, this is the place to do it. I couldn't help but feel like I was eating the best breakfast my mom could ever cook. Definitely lots of love in that food. The buttermilk biscuits are incredible. It would be a huge mistake not to get one. Come in hungover and leave feeling great and ready for a nap."}
{"text":"Pumpkin pancakes with fantastic whipped brown butter was not over spiced, but balanced perfectly.   The house cured, thick cut bacon was a treat, and a much better option than the sausage (and I typically like sausage).  The red skinned (home fried) potatoes were not too greasy, but excellent.  
Overall, the ingredients were fresh and wholesome, and all of our plates included plenty of fresh herbs for an additional level of flavour.
I had a good burger with shoestring fries, for breakfast!"}
{"text":"came here for brunch with a few friends and i was soooo happy !! the food was so good and the donuts were AMAZING. the only downfall is the place is a bit small and while waiting for our table we had to switch between waiting inside and waiting outside. but other than that i recommend to everyone !!"}
{"text":"Friendly service, ridiculous portions, very tasty food.

We FINALLY made it here, after hearing people rave about it forever. They have a small selection for breakfast, which is fine, since the items we did get were executed so well.

The Hubster got the classic: eggs, bacon, toast, homefries. I was a little greedier and got the burger: sausage patty with bacon, burger fixins and frites. It was INCREDIBLE. And so so bad for me. Neither of us were able to finish our plates.

Even though they were at peak brunch time (12pm on a Sunday), the staff were cool as cucumbers, even as they darted from table to table. The price was pretty good, $30 for our meals, two big glasses of fresh OJ and coffee. 

I'm definitely going back, once I work off that meal."}
{"text":"They said they don't give pancake as a side in weekends....  Doesn't make sense. Food was ok but nothing special.."}
{"text":"My wife, mother and I ate brunch here this morning. We arrived just after 9am and had to wait 10-15 mins for table. It was worth the wait! I had a great traditional breakfast they both opted for the breakwich. I can see why people moan about empty tables but it's just due to the size of the kitchen and seems to speed up the service. Worth getting the donuts too!"}
{"text":"One of the few breakfast/brunch places that offers half portions and as a solo diner I really appreciate that. The prices are quite reasonable especially for Toronto. The lemon ricotta pancakes were excellent and the benny was solid as well. Good service and comfortable enough seats."}
{"text":"Homey breakfast spot on the west end of Toronto that serves up comfort brunch items like biscuits, fluffy pancakes and a luxurious hollandaise sauce. Note that the wait for this spot is longer than any other since it is so popular (expect to wait at least an hour at the high peaks). Although the wait is long, make sure to stay since the food will not disappoint. The nice thing that Emma's offers is that you can substitute any meat with avocado for no extra charge!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere here is great. The place is clean and the layout is quite pleasant. The server I had was very polite - always had a smile on his face which made my experience that much better. I had the eggs Benny and it was amazingly delicious. The biscuit was nice and soft and the eggs were cooked to perfection. I highly recommend and would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Small menu but everything is worth trying!

Had the Benny and the BLT! I don't know how they do it but the BLT is amazing especially the in house smoked B.

They also have this crazy cake they sell boat loads of, so worth it too!

Enjoy 

I don't understand why anyone goes to the place that rhymes with zoom next door when Emma's is there"}
{"text":"One of my best meals since moving to Toronto. The blueberry pancakes, biscuits and gravy, eggs, and sausage were on point. Will pass on the donuts next time."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. I have attempted twice this year to get in but the ridiculous line up was just too much. So many better things to do with one's time than wait on a sidewalk. 

Luckily (or perhaps not), I happened to be in the area after their rush and there was no wait! I had the special of the day sandwich which was described to me as a breakfast sandwich but in fact was a burger with an egg in it. It was actually very good. 

Unfortunately it is everything else that was just not exciting, or special. Most items felt so boring or basic and didn't match with the high expectation that those long weekend line ups impressed upon me.

The service was also very slow, so if you have hours to waste on the weekend and want decent basics then this place is for you. Just not my style."}
{"text":"My coworker goes here all the time, so she finally took me on a brunch date! The food was incredible! I'm still dreaming about the blueberry pancakes with the whipped lemon ricotta. For my main I got their quiche of the day which was a mushroom and onion quiche. The portion size was huge! And the top layer of the quiche was crispy (as you can see in the photo) which made it that much better!

My coworker got the breakwich which looked yummy! I must come back to try the eggs benny and the biscuits and gravy. Also they have daily specials... one of which I heard were New Orleans style beignet with dulce de leche 

Staff are super friendly and fun to talk to as well. Everything was a 5/5 star experience!"}
{"text":"An updated review for an updated venue...

Emma's used to be between Northcliffe and Lauder but has now moved just a bit east to between Atlas and Arlington.  They're still on the north side of St. Clair but now east of Oakwood as opposed to west of Oakwood.  The move was not very far... like 3 street car stops.

The new location seems a little larger I suppose.  It seems to have more tables as a footprint and the counter's on the right side as opposed to the left side.  It does however seem a little darker inside.  I think the other place just felt brighter.  

The goodies through the display window at the front counter is just a sight still.  This go around they had their hallmark biscuit tray behind the glass as well as some attractive looking sugar doughnuts and other such things.

The staff is professional and very friendly.  I love the fact that they work as a team to make sure everything is just right such as drinks being topped off and that there isn't a thing we need at any time.

Emma's is now (after just last year) the new birthday breakfast/brunch place for my wife and I on her birthday.  Really it starts off the special day this year as it did last year and will continue to do so until I decide that it won't.  I think I want to keep coming here every year.  We don't live that close but for a weekday it was still a busy place around 10am and we had to wait for a table but only a few minutes.

The menu this go around seemed to be more static as opposed to last year in that it was a printed menu with items that looked to be staples as opposed to \"whatever is in season\" like our first visit last year.  I could be wrong but it didn't matter.  What we had this go around was still very good.  Their food is just special.  Think of a place you would commonly have breakfast at or a place that is overly available anywhere you go like a McD's or Denny's or something and then think of what the opposite of that may be... to me that would be this place Emma's.  

Their food is just plain better.  It's above your average place because this place is not average so by definition they are above average and in my opinion, well above average to the point they are great.  Their potatoes for instance in my Emma's Benny that were on the side... they were just a better, more tastier side of potatoes... and that's just the potatoes.  Their benny came with what was referred to as \"mousseline\" sauce.  I had to ask the server what that was because I just didn't know.  It was explained to me by our server that's it's a richer hollandaise because they use cream to make it... umm ya I'm sold.

Their peameal bacon on top of their biscuits (as opposed to English muffins) were simply divine.  I had noticed that their take on a bloody caesar which I wanted to order but was denied (I didn't know it was only 10:19am so shoot me) came with a Sanagan's pepperette for a dollar more.  I wanted to order this but it was too early... you know the law and stuff.

My wife had ordered the pear and almond baked oatmeal and I had a taste.  Ya it was divine.  I only had a taste but my dish was the definition of savory (eggs benny) and hers was sweet with a thick consistency.  My wife also ordered 2 biscuits on the side with butter and preserves.  She loves biscuits what can I say?  It's the reason we came here last year to be honest.  She loves those biscuits...

Now this being only our second time to Emma's and the first time in the new location I want to see if we can come here on a weekend when it's not her birthday for brunch.  

To put it simply Emma's doesn't feel like they're making food for the masses but rather it feels like I'm eating a homemade breakfast in somebody's home and that person happens to be a kick ass chef.  Everything about what they do and serve just says \"care\"."}

One of my fellow foodies (@foodie411) is always checking in to Emma's Country Kitchen.  A quick Google search tells me that BlogTO has named it on its Top Brunch Restaurants of 2012 (not that I agree entirely with any of their lists, but it's a good resource list nonetheless).

We arrived shortly after 1PM and there was no wait. 

The interiors do remind you of a kitchen deli with the cash register and coffee counter up front and the kitchen towards the rear.  You will also see a selection of prepared meals in the fridge near the kitchen which includes pies, donuts etcetera).  The coffee counter also offers up goods to go such as the Lazy Daisy oatmeal bar, buttermilk biscuits and today's special was the Bacon + Almond Brittle.  

They serve Bunn's coffee and freshly squeezed orange and grapefruit juice along with some Boylan's sodas for those of you who want something bubbly.

We opted for the Emma's Benny ($13) which consisted of a buttermilk biscuits topped with two (of the freshest) poached eggs, peameal bacon, and Mousseline sauce (basically a Hollandaise sauce with whipped cream folded into it).  This was served with a side of griddled red skin potatoes.  The peameal bacon and the farm fresh eggs were definitely what made the dish and the Mousseline was something I'd lick off a plate.

On the sweeter side of things was the Memories of the Farm French Toast ($12) which isn't just your average kind.  Theirs is made with a homestyle white bread with Ontario apple cinnamon compote (with walnuts) and it is then drenched in a rich buttermilk custard and served with whipped honey and citrus butter and maple syrup.  Holy sh!t this was good.  It was almost like a French toast + brioche hybrid.  Loved the walnuts.  YUMMY!  I definitely recommend adding a side of bacon ($3 for 2 strips).

My brunch experience here alludes to images of an old grandmother whipping up country classics in her quaint, country kitchen.  That wouldn't be a surprise seeing as the restaurant is named after owner Rachel's grandmother who owned the original ECK in Cheltenham, Ontario.  The food is made with tender loving care and tastes delicious!"}
{"text":"A must-try brunch place in Toronto! The service and food is to die for, and worth the to 1+ hour wait in line for brunch! 

We always start off with a buttermilk biscuit with their amazing jam and butter. Their jam is delicious with their citrusy butter. A favourite of ours on their main menu is the \"I know what you did last night\" burger was recommended by a former employee (who now works at a well known restaurant in Toronto) who still raves about this burger. The burger is amazing. The dripping egg on top of a perfectly made sausage patty with a homemade bun and all the fixings is a must try! Their eggs Benedict is lovely on top of their homemade buttermilk biscuit. The hollandaise sauce was perfect. At the end of the meal, we always have their maple bacon donut which is one of the best I've had. You can put these on hold by calling in early or if you're waiting in line for a while! They sell out fast!

Overall, a great place for some great brunch!"}
{"text":"Came here because of all the great reviews. Was not disappointed! 

Had the classic breakfast ($10 for two eggs, toast, choice of house-cured bacon or sausage, red potatoes). Upgraded the toast to a buttermilk biscuit for a dollar because everyone raves about the biscuit and it was so good (came with homemade jam - more like a real fruit puree - and citrus butter). Really tasty. 

My friend and I also split a laisy daisy oat cake ($2) and a maple bacon donut ($3). Laisy daisy cake was a generous cake slice (sort of like a carrot cake, crumble, and coconut cake rolled into one). Very tasty. The maple bacon donut wasnt really to our liking but the donut bit was very fresh. 

The food was all very tasty and homemade wjth real ingredients. Emma's country kitchen offers good food, generous portions, and at really great prices. 

Staff were attentive and quick but my friend and I did have to wait 45 mins for a table (put our names on a list at 11am on a Sunday) but it wasnt a big deal since we just went tograb a coffeenearby and wait for Emma's to call us 

Will come back to try pancakes and eggs Benedict"}
{"text":"Have been multiple times and always had whatever sandwich was being served that day. It's always delicious! The sandwich is served by itself, but the prices are so affordable that you have no qualms with getting one of their tasty sides. The blueberry pancakes are also incredible. 

Their desserts are really good and really cheap, so leave room and try a few!

Always pleasant and smiling faces on the serving staff who are really helpful and make really good recommendations. The good does take a long while to come out, but we assumed it was because they were making everything fresh and are more than content to chat while we wait. 

I intend to try a weekend brunch one of these days, but have heard that they get really busy. I've only gone for lunch on weekdays, and have never had a problem getting a table right away. 

All in all, delicious food and desserts. Definitely would recommend and plan to take as many people as I can here!"}
{"text":"Always on the top of the Brunch list, I had to try it, to my dismay, it did not live up to it's reputation.

I had THE CLASSIC breakfast, nothing too fancy, eggs, sausage, potatoes, upgraded to the biscuit (was really excited).  My biscuit was cold, flaky and almost undercooked.  My eggs were fine.  My potatoes were flavourless and a bit hard.  My friend ordered the scrambled eggs and it was runny (had to return it because she was pregnant and ordered scrambled eggs for a reason).  

Service was good, the servers were a bit scattered but attentive.  I was really looking forward to trying this place!  Maybe they had an off day?"}
{"text":"Tasty, hearty, comforting brunch. I mean, some people say that the prices are high, but honestly, I've been to other brunch places, easily charge you more than they do, and give you nothing unique - something you can make at home. 

The food here is delicious. I love that they use fresh and unique ingredients, like a freshly baked buttermilk muffin, and french toast covered in a batter unique to their own. You can taste the difference (so cliche, I know). 

The eggs benny, was composed of nothing you wouldn't have seen anywhere else, but it wasn't overly buttery, and the eggs were cooked perfectly. On top of the fresh buttermilk biscuit was great. French toast had a hint of walnut, with and was dipped in a cinnamon concoction that made it extra tasty. 

Although they don't take reservations, I called and she let me know the earlier the better. They would even seat us before the entire party arrived, which was great because apparently 10am was too early for some of our group and some show up at 1030!

We were only there an hour collectively, and no one attempted to kick us out, but a line up formed shortly after 1030am (on a sunday). We made our way nicely without loitering too much. 

Waiters were super nice, and coffee was nice empty (it was a very good coffee).

One of those places I suggest making the trip over to."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast. 

They have moved into a larger location..no line ups and wait time.

Ordered the eggs Benedict, and blue berry ricotta pancakes. Both dishes were great.

The service here is top notch..served by very attentive and friendly staff.

Definitely will return when in Toronto again."}
{"text":"Honestly, out of this world, down to earth unpretentious delicious goodness. I feel as though I'm eating at a B&B run by a sweet grandmother every time I come here. 

The doughnuts are decadent, yummy, and large. I usually get one as an 'appetizer' for brunch, and ruining by appetite, but it's so worth it. Also, if you can, get the Beignets, which is made to order, hot and fresh and filled with dulce leche. TO DIE FOR.

The menu is small but so far everything I've had is absolutely wonderful. My favorites include their pancakes with citrus butter (!), onion and sage sausage, hangover burger with the cooked to perfection fries, and of course the legendary benny on their massive homemade biscuit. 

On a weekend, try to come before 11 or you'll be waiting in line. The owners and staff are super sweet and always lovely. The only thing I'd recommend to them during their busy times is to have a policy of only seating parties who are all present. I've waited a couple of times now when all of my party of 4 has been present and there is a table of two people waiting for their two friends to show up for 20 minutes, occupying the table and ordering nothing.

It's an absolute pleasure coming here to eat. I recommend to all my friends and family."}
{"text":"I just love coming here for brunch so much, it's the perfect weekend treat. The food is so good that i couldn't decide so i actually had two breakfasts this morning, the Emma's Benny and the pancakes.. Cleaned the whole thing up! You might have to wait a bit for a table, but with the most friendly staff and a buzzing atmosphere it is definitely worth the wait..."}
{"text":"I think this is my favouite brunch place! I've only been here 4-5 times but every time I've been the food has been great and the server (the guy always at the counter) is always really nice and friendly :) My boyfriend is not the biggest fan though lol."}
{"text":"This used to be my favourite brunch spot - I've been coming here since 2013. But since they moved to a new location it just doesn't feel the same - the quality is lower than it used to be, service is very slow and cute, cozy and homey ambiance is replaced by a more modern and spacious one. I was hoping that moving to a larger space would help reduce lineups/waiting time, but this doesn't seem to be the case. I truly hope that the staff is just figuring things out and things will improve, I used to love their buttermilk biscuits!"}
{"text":"Came here today for brunch after reading all the great reviews . First off , the service was great!! Fast , efficient , and friendly . We arrived at around 11 a.m . It was busy but not crowded and we didn't have to wait around for a table . 

Now the food was good .. no exceptionally great by any means . But it was good . We got the blueberry pancakes with ricotta , and eggs benny . The pancakes were alright , nothing to write home about and I wasn't overly crazy about the ricotta . The eggs benny was great and the potatoes were well done . We also got a biscuit .. now this I wasn't impressed with , it was plain and dry and I could of probably made a better one myself . Though it was still good . Overall we will come back if we are in the neighbourhood but I won't go out of my way again to go there"}
{"text":"SERIOUSLY fantastic food! I had the Asparagus and Gruyere cheese Quiche. It was a huge slice, very fluffy and fresh with obviously homemade crust. It came with a bowl of fruit that was not only a generous portion but included 8 kinds of fruit! (pineapple, kiwi, plum, nectarine, green & red grapes, blueberry, strawberry and cantaloupe) -- all for $11. The best breakfast and best deal we found in Toronto. My husband's Classic meal was just as hearty and delicious for only $10. Nice server too! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing! Be sure to get the biscuit, it has to be the best I've every had. The food was worth five stars, but their business logic was flawed. Things like not immediately getting your menu, or drinks. They were very busy and only had a few waiters to handle say sixty customers. All in all worth it."}
{"text":"I had the eggs benedict which were pretty good but I expected more based on the rave reviews. Wish there was more choice on the menu and they had run out of french toast as well. I might have to go again and update my review later, but 3 star for now."}
{"text":"Awesome food!! I'd recommend this place to anyone! The pumpkin and walnut pancakes were are calling me back as we speak!"}
{"text":"The freshly squeezed orange juice tastes like an ordinary bottled orange juice. No way it's fresh! And for $6, really?"}
{"text":"I should give this place 5 stars because I have no complaints about the joint. Maybe because it didn't blow me away, but still, this is one of the best, if not the best breakfast offerings in Toronto. Scrambled eggs are served very differently here. They are a creamy and yummy goodness I've not tasted elsewhere. The sausages too were among the best, not too greasy or salty and they are not preformed disks like the fast food chains. The potatoes were a nice surprise being a tad salty but at least they had better flavour than most joints. It's clear this place makes an effort to do food a bit different and a bit better. Coffee was great too. 9/10"}
{"text":"I tried several times to have brunch in here, but the waiting list sounded crazy for a \"partied last night stomach\" (avoid weekends in here if you are hang over).

They were really smart when they arranged the set up of the joint. The measurements are house doll size (specially the: \"hope you are super slim bar spots\"...). However, thanks to the compactness of the furniture, they're able to accommodate more hungry brunchers.

I liked the large counter and it's decoration. The chandelier with the hanging cutlery is marvelously funny. They display with shinny lights their (Justin Bieber) famous baked goods. I saw some random people entering the premises to acquire biscuits.

Although it was a week day, the place was busy with a constant flow of people coming and going. The noise level was perfect; we were able to have a long conversation without screaming. It's definitely a bring your \"bff's\" spot. 

I ordered a bean & spinach burger with fritters on the side, my friend had the salad with chicken, avocado, and a pile of more stuff.

My burger was perfect, I loved the whole concept of vegan comfort food. I cleaned the plate without the guilt, and the heavy-smelly after burps meat gives. Such a good idea to include beans on a patty. They give a juicy-meaty texture; a perfect contrast for the bitterness and crunchiness of the spinach. I'm going to copycat the idea muajajaja.

I also enjoyed the fritters too much. Never thought about putting sage on the potatoes... Another good idea to my list of want to cook stuff.

The only awkward thing was the washroom. I wouldn't like to sit on the table outside it... what if you are attacked by 2nd handed something?"}
{"text":"Unnnnnnbelievable.

Been meaning to try Emma's out for a while, but it tends to be pretty busy. Today we put our names down and waiting for about 20 minutes (they said it would be 20-25 ish). 

We started off with an order of the beignets. They were ridiculous. I don't think I've ever had beignets before; I've only really heard of them being famous in New Orleans. Anyways, basically fried donuts with powdered sugar and a bit of dulche de leche. 

I had the savoury French toast with two eggs, this avocado sauce drizzle, and a side of bacon. I'd been fiending for bacon and it was exactly what I needed. The French toast was good though I wouldn't necessarily get it again. Although if we hadn't had beignets I probably would have enjoyed it more. 

My friend had the pancakes. I tried them and they were amazing too. Very chocolatey but delicious. Big serving too; you'd be hard pressed to finish them. 

Staff was great too and service was speedy. 

Awesome place. Will be back"}
{"text":"My friends and I (table for 4) came at around 9:45am on a Saturday. It was already up to an hour wait but we read such good reviews online that we agreed to wait it. The staff is incredibly nice, which is almost surprising seeing how busy it was! I got the breakwich which was unbelievably good. I didn't have time to take a picture because I ate it so fast. I had it with a side of golden frites which also were amazing. It is really reasonably priced especially for the quality of food. I haven't had such an amazing brunch in a long time. The biscuits are delicious! I am excited to go back."}
{"text":"Tried their Benny and yogurt parfait which were both great. Especially liked that you can order a half Benny when your not as hungry!

They had a strawberry shortcake donut at the time which was good and not too sweet"}
{"text":"IT WAS AMAZING!!! The service, the food, the atmosphere. Server offered me strawberry peach lemonade (house made) 10/10. I had a classic breakfast - potatoes perfectly seasoned, eggs and bacon cooked how I asked. Server was nice, informative, not over bearing. Wish I remembered his name. Emma's country kitchen is my new fav brunch place. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Solid brunch option.  Comfy restaurant.  Good service.  Great food.  Will be back."}
{"text":"I am actually kind of surprised at the ratings this place has received. To start with the good - the staff are very pleasant and attentive. I would describe the service as very good and the biscuits are out of this world. but. I ordered the classic breakfast with cured bacon (i received sausage) the eggs were way under cooked and the food was mediocre overall. I will also never understand why a breakfast place doesn't invest in good coffee - the coffee was downright awful -- I had two apis and left it. The breakfast was $15 - for two eggs, potatoes and protein --  not sure I would call that reasonable as many other reviewers have. Ill pay great money for a great breakfast -- I've had better for less at a chain breakfast place. So to sum up - great servers, decor and environment verging on institutional and the food was mediocre at best. Not sure I would make the trek back to give it another try."}
{"text":"This restaurant is my favourite brunch place in Toronto! Having been here a handful of times and tried a variety of different dishes, the quality is always consistent, the service is always good and I always leave happy and satisfied. 

Surroundings are very homey, waiters are very personable and I liked probably everything that I've ordered. Some of these include: 

Emma's Benny 
Quiche of the Day 
Wild Blueberry and Ricotta Pancakes 
Biscuits and Gravy 

Servings are huge, but if you do have room for a donut at the end then have one or take it to go :) 

There's been a line-up every time I've come here, even on days when the weather isn't great. I don't think they take reservations so do plan to wait about 30 minutes or so each time. 

There's also many charming restaurants and stores nearby, as well as a dog park! Parking is free if you park in the small streets, though a lot of them are only for 1 hour. Paid street parking is also available."}
{"text":"The BLT on white was perfect: fatty, tangy, chewy and crunchy. The lazy daisy oatcake is a must and for $2 you should take one for the road. 

Highly recommended"}
{"text":"I am writing this review without even tasting my food yet! The waitress is amazing seriously she made sure that I order the right thing., i ordered egg benny, did not wait too long for my food to come, it was supper delicious, I enjoyed every single bite of my order  highly recommended .."}
{"text":"This place would get 5 stars but the wait was SO long and they underestimated - so we ended up waiting a hour and 15 minutes, instead of 45 minutes which was originally quoted. Then they asked us if we were okay sitting at the bar (after all that we just said yes because we were running short on time). However, other than that, the food was delicious. I would go back during the week when it's less crowded. The portions were a pretty good size making the price point is fair. I would go back again!"}
{"text":"Others have told you the food is great and it is.  Keep in mind we are talking breakfast and what is a local hangout. The hostess knew lots of people by name so that says a lot.  However no one said to take granola home with us or the bridle. Please pay attention here: the best granola I have ever eaten. Bridle excellent as well.  Get bacon, eat donuts, enjoy the donuts and fritters.  Reminder, this is a small place so you may have to wait a bit but you can start with coffee and donuts before you sit down --- good place to start with dessert, an apple fritter."}
{"text":"Love love love this place!
Biscuits! Home made jam! redskin home-fry potatoes! The service!
Everything about this place is great!
Their menu changes quite regularly but I like being forced to try something new each time I go, although I'm extremely happy that they always have a stack of homemade biscuits.
I want to bring everyone I know here!"}
{"text":"I am giving 5 stars? because my partner really enjoys? the freshness of the eggs. Have been there for three times, will visit again when we want a place for? a delightful brunch."}
{"text":"My friend and I purposely came here for brunch because of the amazing reviews. Not disappointed! This place is awesome and impressed this picky girl :)

We arrived shortly after 10am on a saturday and it was pretty busy. We just waited 15 mins (you'd probably wait longer if you have more than two people or later in the morning).

I got the blueberry pancakes and my friend got the french toast. The pancakes (4-5) were dense and chewy. Loved the maple syrup. The ricotta was a nice touch, just wished there was more of it, I ate all of it before finishing my last two pancakes :P

The french toast is spicy, and comforting. Cheesy, gooey, spicy sauce, and a little acidity from the orange slice. (Would this be cool to put this in a taco for some crunch??)

Service 5/5 (over and beyond). Our server (I wished I knew her name because they don't wear name tags) was extremely friendly, attentive and bonus points for being efficient. She informed us about the menu choices, asked us if we wanted anything to drink or to save us the doughnuts for later. 

Though it was really busy, and she was serving a lot of tables, what I appreciated what that she never neglected us, she was always checking in with us. She would tell us that she will be coming back, apologized if she wasn't present, but I felt like she was spot on. One of the best service I had in a realllly long time. She also filled our waters, asked us how our meal is, and told us to pay whenever we were ready. We felt welcomed and didn't feel rushed.

Decor 4/5. (cute fork and spoon lamp and they have a little wall shelf with antique display. just wish there was even more country ornaments to bring out the country vibe!)

Food 4.5/5 (presentation is very appealing, appetizing and consistent. The doughnuts make you drool over them and I noticed the plating for dishes were consistent at all tables. I'm happy with the way the food tasted, no complaints!).

The buttermilk biscuit was a bummer because it was too salty for my liking.

There's a reason why this place is one of the top brunch places in T.O -- affectionate people, charming environment and dependable food!"}
{"text":"Made a mistake to come on a Saturday, the wait was 2 hours and let me tell you, it was not worth the wait.

Prior to coming, I had set very high expectations, seeing the incredibly high rating considering the amount of reviews. To my surprise, food was very underwhelming. Got the Emma's benny, contrary to most benny's, it came with a mousseline sauce rather than a hollandaise sauce. Yes, a mousseline sauce is supposed to be richer than a hollandaise sauce. However, it just felt goopy and under-seasoned and did not compliment the soggy buttermilk biscuit. I also subbed the red skin potatoes with yukon gold frites. Which also came out cold. Seasoning on the fries were kind of nice, but yet again, under-seasoned. 

Service was really good, servers were nice and polite. I'm not one to complain to servers about my food unless its REALLY REALLY bad. Like fly in my food bad. But this time I was just too disappointed and decided to pick out a complaint. I told her my fries were cold when she asked how was the food and to my surprise she apologized and voided it from the bill. 

I still think that Emma's is still probably a good place to eat due to the overwhelming amount of good reviews. So will definitely have to revisit and try it again someday."}
{"text":"Family friendly and wait times on Saturday aren't too bad. Donuts sell out by 12pm apparently, I haven't had the pleasure to try them yet.

My favorites are the pancakes and bennys. I've tried quite a few brunches around TO and Emma's my favorite in terms of price, parking and the food itself!"}
{"text":"Great service, amazing food! No complaints about anything!! 
Definitely try this gem!"}
{"text":"Went there on mother's day and had a good experience,. We Ordered the quiche and breakfast sandwich on the home made biscuit and both were absolutely delicious. 
Prices are good and service good too. 
Solid place for brunch"}
{"text":"OOMPH. This place is amazeballs (am I allowed to use that word here?) Two streets west of Christie & St. Clair, there exists a magical brunch restaurant with quaint wood furnishings, a large display case, and a second slide door fridge full of magical, scrumptious, heavenly sinful food. 

I came here Sunday morning as a treat to myself before the gym...Not exactly sure what thought process was going on, because man, was I in food comatose after finishing my meal. BE PREPARED TO WAIT. And don't say I didn't warn you. I was by myself and the wait for a bar seat was 40 mins :( though this is one of the places I'd say, is well worth it. To the owners: have you thought about expanding the restaurant? :D

Ordered the Emma's Benny with a side of freshly squeezed OJ to start my day right...because you definitely cannot go wrong with their homestyle biscuits. This is a true biscuit right here - very buttery, flakey and absolutely deeeelicious. Popeye's biscuits got nothing on these.
I decided to substitute my bacon for avocado, as the combo of mousselline sauce, biscuit and bacon would probably leave me food comatose for the rest of the day. 
Will be back to try their pancakes, and I'm just picturing the fluffiest, moistest pancakes that any restaurant can have. 

Comfort food at its finest. Their donuts also look delectable as well *-*"}
{"text":"I went during Sunday brunch hours and while it was definitely busy inside, my friend & I were able to get a table fairly quick. The atmosphere is cozy and comfortable. The staff were very friendly! They were unfortunately out of the Eggs Benny (which can only add to my imagination at how good it must be) but there are many other delicious-sounding foods on the menu. I ended up getting the Gingerbread Pancakes which were heavenly and so filling!

I will definitely be making a comeback to try the other stuff on their menu."}
{"text":"Updated review March 12, 2015
I went yesterday on a spontaneous whim and had a huge craving for The Hang-over Hamburger only to find this burger is only available in their weekend brunch :( anyways since I came late for lunch. I had Cobb Salad and the soup of the day - Potato Cheddar Soup. What can I say more? It was delicious and again Emma Country Kitchen never failed my expectations made me feel very home indeed. Bought my husband the buttertart bar as a treat and he definitely like it except he wasn't a fan of raisins."}
{"text":"Great breakfast! Have been trying to get there for awhile was surprised to see how busy it was even on a Wednesday morning. I had the eggs benny served on their in house homemade buttermilk biscuits, which were great. Shared with my family their lemon blueberry ricotta pancakes which were delicious!"}
{"text":"When we got to the restaurant, there was no one else waiting for a table however it was full so we were advised that a table would clear up in a few minutes. The wait was about 15-20 mins however when the first table cleared up, the hostess ask a couple that came in after us if they wanted the seat - which annoyed me. Thankfully the couple said no and she asked us right after, so we were promptly seated. This started off the meal on a bad foot however our waitress was very pleasant so I perked right up. 

I got the classic breakfast with the upgraded biscuit and poached eggs with the sage and onion sausage. My boyfriend got Emma's Benny. We both also got the house made lemonade, which looked like pink lemonade and was overly sweet. When the food came out, it was hot and steaming. The highlight of my meal would have to be the biscuit as it was warm and very buttery. The size is also pretty big as well so it's good value and more than enough to slop up all the yolk from the eggs. The sausage was a little bland however they were delicious once dipped in the house made hot sauce. The hot sauce is a little spicier and sweeter than tobasco sauce. The potatoes were loaded with flavor and scrumptious - I ate them all and the most of my boyfriend's too so they were a close second favourite after the biscuit! The Emma's Benny was definitely a winner. The sauce was oh so good - it was a mouselline sauce (think hollandaise with whipped cream..drool). The poached eggs with the house cured peameal bacon were perfect on top of the buttery biscuit. To be honest, I wish I had gotten the Benny instead! 

My only complaint about this cute brunch spot is that it doesn't serve alcoholic drinks. A mimosa would have rounded up the meal nicely."}
{"text":"I love Emma's! Consistently delicious and very fairly priced for the quality of food.

Picked this as my 30th birthday brunch spot because I knew Emma would not let me down. She never ever does.

I enjoyed the homemade strawberry lemonade, egg and sausage sandwich on a house made buttery biscuit, and their stellar granola/yogurt/berries dish. So yummy and I was oh so stuffed! I may have also stolen a bite of my bf's blueberry and lemon scented buttermilk pancakes ;) they were darn good!!

Thanks for being awesome, Emma! See you again soon!"}
{"text":"Finally went this past weekend to try this place out after reading a lot of great reviews about it.   It definitely did not disappoint.   I ordered the eggs Benedict and their daily side green salad.    My husband ordered the blueberry pancakes.   Loved the eggs benny - and really enjoyed it made with their buttermilk biscuit.   Salad was great and although I don't like blueberries, I REALLY enjoyed the blueberry pancakes that my husband ordered!  So perfectly fluffy and good!   Service was really friendly as well from the people that greeted us at the front to our servers.    The only reason I'm giving it a 4 stars is that the wait was quite long at an hour.   But I have to say it was definitely worth the wait and would definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Takeaways: Buttermilk biscuits. Generous portions. Fast and friendly service.

ECK is a charmingly cosy spot with weekend-only donuts. Yes, get the donutssss. 

Typical of a brunch institution, expect a wait to be seated - especially if your party is greater than 2. Unlike other spots, ECK is opened real early but... that also means you need to be there before they open at 9am to beat the weekend rush. My friend and I arrived at 9:15am and waited 25 minutes before being seated. 

Quiche was a miss for me (rather bland) but I'd come back to try Emma's pancakes/seasonal items, get another donut, and indulge in a Side Benny!"}
{"text":"The donuts are the best part, but the rest of brunch is still good.  I enjoy their eggs benny, and love their potatoes.  Sometimes, they have specials for their baked beans, which was delicious, and obviously made from scratch (dried beans, etc.).  

Go early, as they usually have long waits, especially for larger groups, and the space is fairly small."}
{"text":"Super good food, very reasonable price, and friendly service.

I have been to many brunch places in the GTA. Always long lineups for those popular brunch places. This is the only place where you put your name and phone number on the list so that they can call you once your table is ready. That way, you can walk around or just simply sit on a bench near the place! We arrived at 10 AM on Sat, waited for about 30 min (not too bad). 

It didn't take long for drinks and food to come out. OMG their blueberry pancakes with whipped ricotta are to die for. Pancakes were fluffy and light, lemon ricotta was truly the game changer. I devoured it. We also ordered the classic (two eggs, choice of bacon or sausages, potatoes, and toast. All for only $10!!!). BUT I highly recommend upgrading your toasts to house-made biscuits (+$1). You get whipped butter and strawberry jam (I believe they make it there). Eggs were cooked perfectly, 2 thick strips of bacon, and very nicely seasoned and cooked potatoes! 

This place has become one of my fave brunch places. I like how food is decent yet still reasonably priced unlike some of the famous places. I highly recommend this place to everyone. It is worth the wait."}
{"text":"On est venus en famille prendre un brunch. Les serveuses étaient super gentilles. Nous ont bien accommodé avec le bébé. C'est bon et très copieux!"}
{"text":"Feels like home!  Great friendly service, their pancakes are amazing and Mmmmm....lemon meringue donuts! It was my first visit and there was already a lineup at 8am on a Sunday, talking to myself \"this place must be good! \". The place has their own baked goods at the front, and homemade sauces, and jams & more! I would definitely come again & try more different items on their menu."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch on a Sunday around 11 am in late August with a group of 5. One of my family members had decided it would be nice to go here, seeing as she heard they used local ingredients.

We ended up waiting an hour and a half for a table, but it was well worth the wait. The place is small and they don't take reservations, so a long wait can be expected. The inside of the restaurant is kind of lackluster, but the food is obviously the most important thing here.

4 of us ordered the pumpkin pancakes, and 1 of us ordered the savory french toast. Everyone loved the pancakes, they were so yummy and filling. They came served with spiced brown butter and maple syrup. The pancakes were already so flavorful that not many extras were needed. Everything else on the menu looked really good too. I know they change the menu seasonally, so I'd like to go back another time to see what's new!"}
{"text":"The best pancakes I ever had!! The walnuts were sublime. I had mine with a side of sausage (handmade sausage patties) they definitely make from scratch here. My friend ordered the eggs benedict and the mousseline sauce on them was light and so delicious. Highly recommend! Even great donuts to take home."}
{"text":"Emma's country kitchen is quaint in the best way possible. We got the last boston creme donut of the day and I thiñk it made my morning. At 11 am on a Saturday morning we had to wait only 10 minutes for a table in this small joint, but I probably would've waited 30-45 minutes. The service wasn't just good but the people who work here seem genuinely nice and good people. There seems to be many regulars. I got the eggs benedict, and my sisters got the french toast (croque Madame style) and Cobb salad. We are all very full. And the flavors were incredible. My sister even called it mind losing. As they say, they are proud providers of classic Canadian food, with items made from scratch but there is definitely a special flair to every menu item with sweet and savory flavors combined!"}
{"text":"This is the best breakfast spot on St. Clair West. The only downside is that it's a hell of a wait on the weekends.

The owners will go above and beyond when providing service for their customers and the food tastes amazing--even if it's as simple as a classic egg, bacon, and hashbrown breakfast. I've never been a donut eater, but after trying their version of cinnamon sugar, I'm hooked.

The frozen meals in their freezer, like cottage pie, mac n' cheese, chili etc..., are also quite delicious. Maybe even dangerous because I'd rather buy from them than make my own dinners."}
{"text":"Come early for donuts and shorter wait! I arrived on a Saturday around 1:30pm and had a 45 min wait and looked forward to trying the donuts but it was unfortunately sold out.

Get the Eggs Benny for $14. Never had any served with biscuits and Emma's was delicious! It was fluffy and the buttery flavour really added to the dish. The eggs were perfectly poached and the serving of pea meal bacon was moist and well seasoned. I would recommend!"}
{"text":"Went for brunch about 1p.m. on a recent Sunday.  Got a table for 2 within 20 minutes.  Not bad. 
The food was excellent: great sausage with the sausage and eggs and excellent potatoes too.  The eggs benny  was equally superb.  Decent prices for the quality.  Coffee was good but not great.
The server was not as attentive as I'd like but I'll give her a reluctant pass considering it was packed. Not always sure whom to blame in such a situation - the boss for under-staffing or the server.  Probably me for going to a popular place at it's busiest time.  Service was at any rate very friendly. 
It was also pretty loud. 
All in all, go at off-peak hours and you'll be very happy."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time unless you're coming here for Brunch on the weekend. They only have donuts on Saturday's, the rest of the week it's a very basic menu. I got there was treated terribly I sat at a table and was asked if I was there alone I said Yes, but the waiter didn't seem to care and put in extra place set. When he dropped off two menus I told him again I was alone, he took my order which was the blueberry pancakes, a side of bacon and a hot apple cider. He told me he would get the apple cider first, instead he forgot and it didn't come until I asked for it when my food arrived. The food was delicious but when I went to pay I was told they don't take American Express, it would be nice if this was listed somewhere I paid and once I looked at my receipt saw that I was over charged for the bacon. The place was nice but not worth it when there are so many other places."}
{"text":"Hands down the BEST breakfast/brunch place. Once you eat here and go somewhere else for breakfast/brunch it just doesn't taste good. Emma's is literally comfort food at its finest. 

Staff are amazing and friendly and after having gone here a few times now, it feels like you're going home to grandma's cooking. 

Like other reviews, go early or be ready to wait in line; weekday or not. I was here at 9:15 am and it was already quite busy."}
{"text":"Great service and great food. Menu is great including plenty of side and a la carte options. We got our food what seemed like just a few minutes after putting in the order even though the place was busy. Cobb salad was delicious with Greg egg and spinach. I ordered the yogurt parfait with granola which was filling and delicious! Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"The food is good is just the serving is too slow and they want the people wait even though there's a empty table.."}
{"text":"This place exceeded my expectations.  They even serve you while you're waiting for your seat.  The staff is friendly.  The prices are reasonable.  The food is delicious.  I had Emma's Benny's (i think it was called), eggs Benedict.  The eggs were pouched to perfection, delicate, yet in tact. Very tasty, left me craving for more, except I was stuffed... Loved their in-house cured bacon and peameal bacon... Mmmmm... definitely coming back.  Oh and the biscuits under the pouch eggs and the sauce... so delicious... the biscuit must have been the best biscuits i've ever had on a Benny... I'm having a very tough time deciding between 4 and 5 stars... i'm not too liberal with my fives... :)  I can't think of any reason not to give it a five... Five it is... :)
Street parking was easily found.  Bit of a line, maybe 25 minutes.  Expected for such a great place... :)"}
{"text":"This place was great!!!! We went on a weekday so we got seated right away. The servers were fantastic and the food was beyond amazing. Though they did tell us there are more options on the weekends. I really enjoyed the atmosphere and the sausage. Definitely going to come back on a weekend!"}
{"text":"Haven't been too impressed by ham I mean Canadian bacon I mean just bacon since we're in Canada until now. Great service, good comforting food, and it's a place is frequent often of I lived nearby. Will have yup return for weekend brunch next time I'm in town.

JONASAPPROVED"}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  The restaurant seemed busy for a Friday mid morning in a neighbourhood where people would be working.  No problem getting a seat.

Potato side was big enough for two."}
{"text":"Love it. The eggs benny was delish. The biscuit that goes with the benny was the right amount of sweetness and the peameal bacon was really one of the best i've had. Very fresh OJ. Great prices too!"}
{"text":"Great food, fast friendly service.  Can't ask for much more than that.  The daily quiches can't miss and the Benny is amazing.  Perfect potatoes and fries.  Although the burger is a bit too heavy for my liking for breakfast, it's one of my favourite as a lunch burger.  If you can get the beignets, do it!  Worth the drive from Scarborough!"}
{"text":"Another weekend, another indulgent brunch. Ain't life grand!

For me, Emma's is 4 stars bordering on 5. It's excellent bordering on crazy excellent.

If you arrive at peak brunching hours (weekends from 11-2ish) you're likely in for a wait. This past Sunday we arrived just after noon and were quoted a 75-minute wait (!!)...Tip: if you're super hungry, walk a block east to Staving Artist (popular waffle brunch place) to compare wait times.

Not a huge deal for us. We grabbed a coffee and smoked a doob in the meantime ;)

Our meal was worth the wait. Eggs benny served on a deliciously moist, homemade buttermilk biscuit with a side of rosemary potatoes was wonderful. As was the cinnamon bun pancakes!! Those pancakes are blissfully good. (Note: they were \"sold out\" of French toast so it's probably amazing too).

My only regret is not purchasing one of their daily donuts...the \"kitchen sink\" donut beckoned to me from the display case when I entered the restaurant, but by the time we left I forgot all about it (doob effects?). Next time, dear donut. Next time."}
{"text":"This place is fabulous 
They make all their doughs and have original recipes 
Last time I tried french toast (which I normally dislike) that had ham and cheese baked inside the dough
You can't find food like this anywhere"}
{"text":"Amazing! Homemade biscuits. Delicious food. I would eat here everyday if I could!!!"}
{"text":"Came for brunch and had to wait for 30 minutes.  Totally understandable and that gave my friend and I some time to walk around and explore the neighbourhood.  By the time we got back, we were next on the list and they had a table ready for us.

I decided to get the breakfast biscuit that came with egg, cheese and bacon and the 12oz glass of freshly squeezed orange juice.  My friend got Emma's Bennys and their lemonade of the day which was strawberry lemonade.  

The food did take a bit of time to come out but nothing outrageous.  I, for the most part did not notice as my friend and I were in conversation.

Please do me a favour and do not visit this place WITHOUT getting a biscuit!  Wow, they are truly delicious.  So soft and fluffy, they were perfect.  I couldn't even finish my sandwich, because they are bigger than your average biscuit.  Everything in my sandwich worked and was so good.  My friend finished off the rest of my sandwich and was floored on how good it was.  The orange juice was also excellent.

It is quite a trek just to come here for brunch but I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Delicious for brunch. A bit of a wait in the mornings, but worth it for the food. Try the eggs benny - it's the best"}
{"text":"THIS....breakfast spot... Is A...M...A...Z...I...N...G. I'll try to keep it short as there are 300+ reviews.

Backstory: I don't know what it is with Toronto and the mouthwatering food. 90% of the restaurants that I have visited for the past 3 years that i've been coming here, have always had me moaning for dear life. My previous go-to breakfast spot was the Senator's near eaton centre. That is the typical tourist breakfast spot so I wanted to branch out and try something different. 

Everything else: Man, I walk in and I could smell the goodness. I view the menu and I realize my only option for pancake was blueberry. Normally I don't like blueberry pancakes because 90% of them come with actual blueberries in them. Here @ Emmas, they blend it and mix it with the batter. I had that with a side of double smoked bacon and eggs. One bite into my food and I wanted to shed a tear. Absolutely delicious. 

Summary: MUST VISIT. MUST EAT. MUST DO BOTH. NOW!"}
{"text":"Went for breakfast twice in one week, had the BLT on whole wheat and a side of potatoes the first time, the BLT was great but I didn't love potatoes. Got the BLT again the second time and ordered the fries as a side and I didn't think they were that good, but the BLT was still great. I will go here again, may skip the side dish though."}
{"text":"Emma's Country Kitchen recently moved up the street, and it's bigger and better! I had the banana chocolate chip pancakes with potatoes and sausage. I thoroughly enjoyed every bite. It reminded of what my grandmother would cook, which is always a good sign am I right? lol Make sure to check out their desserts too!

Follow them on social media to see what they're up, they are very good at keeping it up to date :)

Keep it up, ECK!"}
{"text":"Emma's is very good. The sausage \"burger\" is made with sausage and bread made in house. It is delicious. In fact, it would easily stand up against anything that called itself a burger.

The menu is somewhat limited. There are about 4 breakfast and four lunch choices. A biscuit is an extra 2.50$. Side items are generally 3$ each.

Overall, I found the restaurant to have good service, average cleanliness in the dining room, and above average value.

It is possible to get a table here for lunch, but Sunday brunch can be quite crazy, with lines out the door even on snowy winter days."}
{"text":"Been trying to try emma's kitchen for quite some time now. Their lineups has been too long for us to wait. 20 mins this time was not bad. At least it is beside a park with some benches people can sit and wait. Once you get on the waitlist they will call you once your table is ready. Waited close to half an hour for the call and got seated in an awkward table. It was right beside another table that made my gf seated almost to the edge of the table. Ordered the Benny served with a peameal bacon and country biscuits. Emma's is known for comfort food and this dish definitely fit the bill. The biscuit was rich and the hollandaise was quite buttery. It fulfilled the devil in me while it guilted my healthier self. Nonetheless it was pretty good. Worth coming back after eating a week worth of salad. Next time I do want to try their beignet and maple bacon donut. Both looked appetizing but I was not in the mood for gaining 20 lbs."}
{"text":"It's located on a busy road and that's why parking is a Big Pain in the A**. We wandered around for almost half an hour before we got a spot.

When we entered they had a long queue and we had to wait for another 20-25 mins to get the table and they don't take reservations. I wish one of us could have jumped out of the car while we were looking for parking and got our name in the waiting list.

We ordered Emma's Benny and Biscuits & Gravy. Though I have heard a lot about their Eggs Benedict, I didn't like it too much as the Bene Sauce was not that great. It did not have great consistency it was a bit more sort of watery. I like my bene sauce rich in consistency. My husband makes better benedict sauce than they did. Poached eggs were good though had running yolk and that's exactly how I like it. In fact the server asked me how I like my poached egg and of course I said soft with yolk ooozing out of it.

Sausage and Gravy was okay but I did not like the scrambled egg that came with it. It was too dry for me. I like my scrambled egg creamy and again I make better scrambled eggs then they did.

May be this was one time thing and happened to me. After reading all the other great reviews I cannot understand why was everything with my experience not that great or even good."}
{"text":"Super!

I ordered classic breakfast with no meat and the server suggested avocado.  THANK YOU!

I enjoyed a beautiful morning sitting at the open bar facing the street.  Definitely happy with my choice to dine at Emma's, and would return again."}
{"text":"So good! Love breakfast and lunch here. Have had the quiche and the breakwich. Both really yummy and fresh. Love that everything is made fresh daily as well. The server guy we've had for both of our visits is so friendly and kind. Would definitely recommend Emma's!"}
{"text":"Time of day visited: Saturday morning at 9:00 AM
Amount spent: with tax, tip, for two people, our total was $39.32.

This review is specifically for weekend brunch. Be warned, if you don't come early, you could be waiting to eat for quite awhile. We arrived here right at 9:00 AM on a Saturday morning recently, and by 9:10 AM, most tables were taken. The place is charming, homey, and just the kind of comforting meal environment you would want on a chilly weekend morning.

We ordered the Eggs Benny ($13) with a side of home fries, the gingerbread pancakes ($11), and two donuts (the \"Kitchen Sink\" which is glazed with chocolate and topped with bits of the most random snacks you can think  of, including and not limited to, potato chip crumbs, Cheerios, M&Ms, etc, and a cranberry apple donut - the donuts ranged in price). The Eggs Benny was our favourite, and was topped with a delicious sauce, the biscuit was light and buttery, and the home fries were flavourful and crispy! The gingerbread pancakes were also super fluffy and weren't heavy at all.

Overall, if you want a no-nonsense, comfort food-type environment, Emma's is a great option. Portion sizes are quite large, our server was attentive, and prices are reasonable given the quantities served (I only finished 1.5 of my 3 pancakes - they are quite large, and I had to take the rest home!). If you're in the area, this is definitely a great brunch spot, and I'd highly recommend it."}
{"text":"This place has some amazing food. While they are pretty busy they underpromise and overdeliver on wait time. They do their best to make sure you are seated in a good enough time. Secondly, their small menu helps with that they try to keep it small so the quality is high on each item. We got the classic and added biscuits and pancakes. The biscuits are to die for and they are made in house. Soft, fluffy and just great with some jam. The pancakes are the same. Soft, fluffy and just a cloud with whipped butter. The atmosphere is light and fun and if I had a hangover I would come for that fix. One of my favourite brunch spots and I will definitely be back!!!!"}
{"text":"The inviting atmosphere along with the friendly staff makes Emma's Country Kitchen a mainstay in the community. Oh the food is fantastic too!"}
{"text":"Quaint location, very friendly staff, and delicious food - Had the breakwich with cheddar and bacon, with a side of sea salt and thyme frites. The buttermilk biscuit is fantastic, and the egg was cooked perfectly. A no fail spot, will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Finally a breakfast/lunch spot in my neighbourhood I can brag about!. This place is lovely. Everything is reasonable, tasty and homemade. Did I say homemade? Ya baby I MEAN HOMEMADE: Sausages, breads, buns, BACON. THEY MAKE THEIR OWN BACON! This fact alone would induce a marriage proposal out of me. I had the quiche. Rich but not heavy. B.L.T. -green heirloom tomatoes and did I mention house cured and smoked sexy bacon and freshly baked (in house) bread? Just writing it makes me pause and my eyes roll back in my head in ecstasy.  Oh, ya. It's good.  They also have a pantry of many of their items frozen for quick dinner options at home. The only improvement I can think of would be to have the hours extended a little. They currently open 9-4pm 7days a week.  I think an 8-5pm schedule would be great.  That way you could pick up breakfast to go and dinner on the way home. Bravo Ladies and welcome to the neighbourhood. 
PS
Good coffee too."}
{"text":"I've brunched here a couple of times. It's super busy, so be sure to go early, or be prepared to wait. The good part is, the staff will take your name and number and call you when your table is ready, so it's easier to pass the time as you can stroll around St. Clair. 

The service here is awesome. The staff are very friendly and efficient and they got the food out fast without making the customer feel rushed. 

The food is great. The bacon is thick cut and it's super delish. My favourite part is the donuts!! You can order donuts to go when you order your food. Then when the bill comes, so do the donuts!!! 

Basically it's the best."}
{"text":"OMG - came here with some friends for Brunch and wow!

We did have to wait for about 30 mins for a table for 4 (but it was later in the day). 

Looking at their menu,  we wanted to try everything! the French toast, the strawberry shortcakes..donuts (they were sold out by the time we got there).

but we wind up only ordering two things: 

the classic - 2 eggs any style, house cured bacon or sage and onion sausage, crispy griddled red skin potatoes with sea salt and thyme. Served with toast of your choice. Upgrade your toast to a buttermilk biscuit 

Emma's Benny - Warm and fluffy buttermilk biscuit topped with house cured peameal bacon, poached eggs and smothered in mousselline sauce. Served with a side of griddled red skin potatoes.

big portions - really good!

if you want the benny, make sure you asked them if they still have it as they tend to sell out quick - I had ordered the last one of the day!!!"}
{"text":"The food at Emma's Country Kitchen is great but the service is okay. Make sure you get here early to avoid long lineups and a chance to grab some donuts (they sell out around 11 am). I arrived on a busy Sunday afternoon and the wait was about 45 minutes, and although the hostess took my information down, when I came back I witnessed her give a table away for two to a party who just got there with no reservation. When I was finally seated an hour later, I was told that I had to order after everyone else did, another 20 minutes! Huh?

The restaurant is relatively small and seats 40 people at most. It has a cute mom and pop vibe to it which makes it actually feel like a quaint country kitchen in Toronto dispute the horrendous line ups!

Now I've had my fair share of Eggs Benedict around Toronto and New York and I must say this is one of the best I've eaten! The difference is the homemade buttermilk biscuit and the thick slab of peameal bacon that made it sweet and salty that made all the difference - what balanced it was the delicately poached eggs! This was so good that I could have lived without whatever the Eggs Benedict was plated with on the side. 

Although the menu is small, there are other great options to choose from. If I do come back I'd get the Savoury French Toast or the Cinnamon Pancakes, with a Side Benny of course!"}
{"text":"Greetings!! Went here for breakfast and we enjoyed the biscuit and gravy. The blueberry pancakes were moist and delish!! However the coffee was very very strong and somewhat not enjoyable!!  Our waitress was very friendly and attentive. Definitely would return!"}
{"text":"I can't describe our experience in only one word. The food was amazing, awesome, truly delicious! The staff are very nice too. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Came back for Saturday brunch....SO MUCH BETTER! 

Savoury French toast (a salty, savoury twist to a classic), blueberry pancakes (fluffy, light and not overly sweet) and BLT sandwich (perfect classic made with fresh ingredients) were all on point! 

The wait is long if you get there around 9:30, but doughnuts (delicious! At least the maple bacon one) are still available and they call you when your table is up so you don't have to hover at the entrance."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.

I love the idea of a neighborhood brunch spot and even better when I hear they serve up delicious bottomless coffee and amazing donuts. I normally don't like waiting more than 15-20 minutes for a table but if a place is this good, I'm willing to wait. After 50 minutes on a Saturday afternoon, we were finally seated. 

The servers were friendly and great despite being crazy busy. Unfortunately for us, they sold out of all the donuts so I couldn't try any of their amazingness. They also sold out of their French toast which my sister really wanted to try. Lucky for me they still had my egg Benedict on biscuit. I ordered that and a coffee while my companions had the quiche with salad and the burger. 

Benedict was delicious. Perfect eggs and sauce. They made a great biscuit though I prefer the texture of English muffins. Soggy egg soaked biscuit just ain't the same. Coffee itself was alright. I've had better in brunch joints so I'll say it was average. Tried the quiche.. Delicious and the slice was huge. Burger was average and came with a whole side plate of fries."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite breakfast places with amazing food and excellent service!

Staff: They are so friendly and the food comes quickly. If you come in on a weekend, expect to wait if you aren't there early. I've waited over an hour for a seat because it's that good. If you wish to have a donut or something from their baked goods section, ask if they could put some aside if you're adding your name to the waitlist because they go really quick!

Ambience: It's a small place with some high seating and some regular spots, but there's still space to move around. 

Food: Amazing food! My favourite is the I Know What You Did Last Night Burger which is a sage and onion sausage burger. Their sausages are all freshly made and their not your traditional links but rather they're patties. So good! Their Cornbread and Pimento Cheese French Toast is also amazing and has a little bit of a kick. I've had their donuts before and they are definitely an indulgence.

Mouth-watering goodness!!!"}
{"text":"Emma's Country Kitchen definitely lived up to the hype. 

I should have ordered the eggs benny because I was in love after just one bite off my friend's plate. Hot sauce on the side is also a must.

The cured bacon and the freshly squeezed apple cranberry juice reminded me of my English grandma's cooking, so I'd say they've got the homemade/country thing on lock. 

Normally I find the little pieces of fruit are an after thought and past their best, but at Emma's it was fresh and good quality. 

The service was also really genuine and friendly."}
{"text":"Make you sure you go to this restaurant early as there is a line there each and every day. The main reason there's a line is because the food here is sooooo good although the service can be decently slow. You have to try the pancakes - they were out of this world. Also not an expensive place but it's also not cheap (20 bucks a person)."}
{"text":"Came in for a leisurely Friday breakfast on a PA day so my kid was off school.

Warm and welcoming space with a delicious preview of the home baked goods while you wait briefly for a table. Chill tunes, great service.

My kid was really happy to find hot apple cider sand also that the biscuits did not have egg so she could eat one. It's so fluffy! We also took one to go

I went for the baked oatmeal with pecans, apples and cinnamon. I am very picky about, but enjoy oatmeal when it is done well. This was fantastic!

I wish we lived closer. This is our kind of place. Love."}
{"text":"This review is solely on service, I would have loved to have tried the food and likely would have liked it, but I was turned away before I got the chance to. 

This saturday morning, I was with my girlfriend and her best friend, who happens to be pregnant, and was told that we would have to wait 20 min for a seat to be free. The hostess offered to give us a call on my cell, as we were blocking the entrance, when a table would be free. So we walked around for a bit and never got a call. 

The hostess totally forgot about us :-(

Ironically, we just decided to have our breakfast at the \"Starving Artist\", which btw, was quite tasty.

Question is now, would I got back to this restaurant after all of that? Who knows, it really left a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"After always seeing Emma's on lists of top places to brunch in the city, a friend and I decided to check it out on a weekday morning.  I was surprised that a line was beginning at 10:30 on a weekday, but it wasn't long before we had a table.  The decor seriously lacks; I thought it cold and uninviting.  My friend had the classic breakfast and although good, he said it wasn't the dish to order if very hungry, as the portions were small.  I had the pancakes, which were pumpkin for autumn and they were delicious and very filling (4 I believe).  We ordered Americano's since they were the same price as black coffee.  Anything you might ask for extra of (syrup, butter, hot sauce, etc) is charged to your bill.  Service was prompt.  Not sure if I'd go back."}
{"text":"Upon arrival the hostess greeted us and informed us of a wait. As an afterthought we were then told we had to leave the restaurant as they could not accommodate us waiting inside and were told to go to a coffee shop in the neighbourhood and they would call us when the table is ready, all this during a freezing rain ice storm. I have been to many restaurants where I had to wait for a table but never told to go away and come back later. This was my first and last experience with Emma's Country Kitchen."}
{"text":"I ordered the blueberry pancakes with lemon ricotta, sage sausage and eggs.... DELICIOUS!!!! My husband ordered the biscuit sandwich.... he said it was the best biscuits he ever had! My mother in law ordered a salad and she is still talking about how good and fresh the salad was. They give you a lot of food. Staff was extremely friendly and I will definitely go back when I visit Toronto again"}
{"text":"This place has amazing brunch and one of the best maple bacon donuts I've ever had! Seriously, the pictures on Yelp! don't do the food justice. They use all sorts of spices (don't read spicy) and real farm fresh meats. They griddle their potatoes, use onions in their sausage, and the Buttermilk Biscuits are just golden brown enough to not fall apart until they're in your mouth. Owner: Especially when it's so cold in Toronto, you should consider a reservation system like OpenTable so people don't have to wait outside."}
{"text":"The place was packed on Saturday for brunch. We had to wait for 40 minutes.
I ordered Emma's benny and they were really good. The biscuit was very soft and melted in mouth. However, I was disappointed with their potatoes, they were a little burnt. Having said that, I would still love to come back to the place for their delicious and fresh biscuits."}
{"text":"I went in with high expectations on account of all the five star reviews. It was good, but not five star good. I do like the limited menu choices. I hate choosing. Do a few things really well. Good philosophy. I get that its a country type place without fancy-pants coffee drinks or even americanos, but I was still crabby about drinking drip coffee. 

I had the eggs benedict with the peameal bacon. Like I said good, but not the best brunch I think you can have in the city. Design of the restaurant is also not ideal for cold weather. Someone opens the front door and the draft carries the length of the restaurant (it's not a very big place).

Probably wouldn't make the trek north again just to go here."}
{"text":"I ws looking for a good breakfast place because I was in St clair at the time so I found this place a little bit expensive food came out quick and warm I ordered eggs Eben duct and since u don't eat pork they were able to substitute the pork with avocado that was nice of them. I lt was pretty full in breakfast time the hollandaise sauce was delicious but the poached eggs were a bit overcooked I wanted the yolk yo ooze out a little bit more when I cut into them overall not bad for breakfast"}
{"text":"Cute dinner type brunch place, came here on a Sunday morning and waited for about 20min, not too bad...service was friendly and attentive, menu selection was a little scarce in my opinion, only about 6-7 options to choose from ranging from 9-13 dollars
Got the eggs Benny which tasted great Altho I didn't really like the peameal bacon, too much fat in my opinion but the biscuit and roasted potatoes were good, girlfriend ordered the French toast which tasted a little burnt and it says there was chocolate chips in it but I barely tasted any

Maybe I'll come try out this place out when it's non brunch"}
{"text":"If you're looking for brunch that has a different feel than your standard basic American breakfast this is your place! I came here with a group of friends and had to wait about 15-20 minutes to be seated on a Friday afternoon. The service was great and they made us feel welcomed. 

I had the biscuits and gravy with a side of poached eggs. Wow was it good... I will definitely be back! Just made sure to call ahead to see how long the wait is I'm not sure if they take reservations. 

They also have a mini bakery in the front for you to take home some of their in restaurant made goods! Make sure you check it out!"}
{"text":"Delicious brunch place with reasonable prices! We had the quiche and the peameal bacon eggs benny on a biscuit the other weekend - both really good, although the biscuit was the real standout! Wait time wasn't bad at all - 10mins. Worth going to if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"New favourite breakfast/brunch spot in the city! I've been there twice, both times trying the unique pancakes. First time, gingerbread pancakes, second time, banana chocolate chip. They are the PERFECT cakes! Plus they come with this brown sugar butter that is to die for. Oh and after the enormous plate of pancakes I got an apple fritter. I mean, I'm no food critic but these were crispy, moist on the inside, lots of apples... the best, mmm! 

Service is excellent as well. Lovely waiter...asked us if we had any food allergies, explained the menu perfectly, very accommodating, and just a lovely dude.

Can't recommend this place enough :)"}
{"text":"Had the day off last Thursday and decided to try this place for some brunch.  This is as good as it gets if you ask me.

Pros:
All items are made in house from scratch
Food is excellent
Friendly staff

Cons:
Not as much items available on weekdays

Heard a lot of great things about this place in the past so it was a foregone conclusion that I would make it here eventually.  Upon arrival we were presented with a one page menu.  It seems that not everything is a available to order on a weekday.  They had 4 breakfast items and a couple of sides to choose from.  This is about it as far as anything negative goes.  

I ordered the classic breakfast while my GF ordered the breakwich.  We also ordered the daily soup which was cream of mushroom and a order of fries. One thing to note here.  Everything is made from scratch in their kitchen.  They bake their own bread, they smoke and cure their own bacon etc.  You can definitely taste the difference.

The soup came out first.  I can tell you that this was one of the best cream of mushroom soups I've ever had.  The mushrooms were chopped to a very fine consistency which gives the soup a different kind of texture you're used to. There was a detectable hint of white pepper as well.  My classic breakfast came out next.  Everything about the breakfast was excellent.  I chose the whole wheat and honey bread for my toast.  It was very good, just the right amount of honey flavour.  The eggs were scrambled perfectly.  You know a place is a good if they scramble an egg right.  The bacon was very good.  It was not too crispy and tasted very good.  The red potatoes were the star of the show though.  They were made so that they were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  It was so good I can't give them enough justice here.

The breakwich was a is not your garden variety breakfast sandwich either.  First, it's made with a house baked buttermilk biscuit.  The egg is still a bit runny in the yolk which makes it extra good.  The sage and onion sausage my GF added to it was very good. The fries were just OK and that's only in comparison to everything else we had.  They were above average fries though, don't get me wrong.       

The 2 servers we dealt with were both very nice and knowledgeable about the place.  They could tell you fully about the process of how things get done here if you care to ask.  They were super nice throughout our whole visit and made out great experience here all the more better.  There's not enough good things to say about this place.  

If you're looking for a home cooked type brunch, you must try this place.  I will definitely be back on a weekend to give their full menu a try."}
{"text":"I have a love hate relationship with this brunch spot. Love because they made the most fluffy and delicious cinnamon pancakes I've ever had. Couple that with their signature whipped cream and real maple syrup and you'd have been in heaven. Hate because just after one season of trying these (seasonal menu) pancakes, they were gone. I desperately checked their menu each season for about 2 years until I gave up. Despite my loss, their eggs benny still keeps me coming back for more. It's one of the best in Toronto with their tasty potatoes. Remember to pair it with a side of the house made sausage and hot sauce for the full experience."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend yesterday for my birthday breakfast, and I loved every minute of it. 

Very cute ambience, super friendly service and great food! Their baked goods all looked amazing, and I had a buttermilk biscuit that sort of changed my life... I am typically not the biscuit ordering type, but the one I got was warm, flaky and heavenly. Their homemade berry jam was also incredible. I also got a granola, fruit & yogurt bowl that was filling yet light. I have a feeling their granola is homemade, and it's very tasty. 

Lastly, did I mention they have unlimited (and yummy) drip coffee? 

Overall - great vibe, food and great prices for what you get. I will be back."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a Sunday, around 12:30PM - it's a bit out of the way for me so had to take advantage when a friend offers to drive. The restaurant is on west St. Clair west, in a very cute area with a bunch of other food spots. They didn't take reservations for brunch - it took a while for someone (who appeared to also wait tables and tend the cash register) to come over and put our names on the list. We were told that it was going to be approximately a 45 minute wait (which turned out to be closer to an hour), so we went to a coffee shop a few blocks down (see review here: http://www.yelp.com/biz/ellingtons-music-and-cafe-toronto?hrid=1SCODM3SUWV5W-Gt17tzbQ&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)).

What can I say - the wait was definitely worth it! Between the 2 of us - we shared the memories of the farm french toast (the best part was the buttermilk custard and cheesecake mousse, though the toast itself was a bit burnt) with a side of fruit salad, the daily quiche (my favourite item - it was loaded with mushroom and eggs, and the crust was just right) with a side of green salad, and a \"breakwich\" (a buttermilk biscuit sandwich with an over-easy egg, swiss cheese, and avocado replacing meat as my friend didn't eat pork - this was yum!).

The wait staff was great and very helpful, and the place has a very homey feel - which is a bit different from some of the more hipster brunch spots downtown that I've been to. We also stumbled on their 3rd year anniversary celebration - so got a free donut (we both got the beignets donut filled with dulce de leche, which my friend claims to be the best donut he's ever had) and some ice team. They also sell donuts for takeout, and all of the flavors looked delicious.

I would definitely recommend this brunch spot!"}
{"text":"Great cozy restaurant, where they adapted to my lactose intolerance. Service was great. I wish they had a bigger selection of healthy options. Restaurant was a bit chilly."}
{"text":"Came here around 1 o'clock on a Sunday afternoon.  We knew there would be a line, but were told it would be a 45 minute wait. If you go on Sunday, you'll want to go before 11 probably. Some of the people in front of us eventually gave up, so we got seated a little earlier. It was worth the wait. Everything here was so yummy.

We started by sharing the beignet filled with dulce de leche, which were ridiculously good. And lucky we got the last order of the day. They are made in house, fresh, and they do sell out! I highly recommend them, even though I almost choked on the powder sugar they were dredged in.

I also had the eggs benedict, which came recommend and I did not regret that decision. The whole plate was perfect... from the homemade biscuit, to the delicious mousseline sauce. When I go back, it will be hard to not order this again. But I may need to try something new. Maybe I'll go halfies with someone? :)"}
{"text":"Visited here during weekday lunch time. Needed to wait for 15min for seats. It was my first time to visit and was not expect anything because I am not a big fan of brunch restaurants. But this place is the best brunch restaurant ever I've been!! Had Wild Blueberry and Ricotta Pancakes & Emma's Classic Cobb Salad. The salad sauce was great tasty. 

Ricotta pancakes were homemade 
Cobb Salad was the best ever!

10 out of 10."}
{"text":"Got here for 10am thinking that there wouldn't be a line, was I wrong. Line was for 20minutes, but I didn't mind that as I saw what was being served. Very chummy place as it seemed like a great place for a family breakfast.

Saw the donuts on display while I was waiting for a table and decided to order them to have them put to the side(they were sold out by the time I was done my breakfast). 

After getting seated, was surprised that the menu wasn't any bigger. Menu had the essentials and I decided to go with the benny, side sausage and broco quiche. Benny was runny, sausage was well seasoned and the quiche crust was flakey. Server was at tentative. Overall a great place and I can understand why there's a constant lineup."}
{"text":"The most fabulous brunch I've ever had! The food was delicious beyond words and the staff was pleasant and accommodating. We had the pancakes..to die for and the French toast...a must have. It was worth the expensive can ride. Love, love, love this place"}
{"text":"I SOOO wanted to give this place a 5/5 however the amount of time it took to get our food (so simple two eggs, toast and bacon) took WAY too long! 
The place was super packed for a Friday morning but we only waited about 15 mins for a table which was nothing. We ordered right away and even paid right away but our food took a solid 20 minutes to come. The food was delicious... They make their bread in house so which ever toast you get will be amazing. The eggs were perfectly done and the bacon was to die for. My friend got potatoes which looked so good!!! Honestly the people serving you are happy and pleasant and the food is great. Solid 10/10. They just lost a star for the time management . I will come back and I can't wait to try their blueberry pancakes!!!"}
{"text":"I'm so stoked about such an adorable and delicious brunch spot opening up in my neighbourhood! I had the eggs benedict, which was served on tea biscuits made in-house. The skin-on red potato side was also fantastic, and the decor of the space is bright and cute and cozy. Hooray!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for brunch. Came here on a saturday morning at 10 and had to wait about 35 minutes for a table of four. There was a constant flow of people coming in before and after we left. 

The decor inside is pretty basic / homey, which I enjoy. Its got some charm to it and the servers were very very friendly. They apologized profusely when we tried to order items that were sold out. The servers are enthusiastic and helpful. 

They serve donuts on weekends and many people pre-order them. At 10:15 or so they were basically sold out of the donuts. I snagged the last three to eat while waiting for a table. The donuts are probably best I've had in Toronto with different flavors every weekend. They also have beignets on the menu, but when i ordered at approximately 10:40 they were already sold out.  

I had the eggs benny and the french toast which is savory. Both were very good. The french toast is pretty inventive and definitely had some kick to it. I would re-order both dishes. 

Overall, this is a great brunch place and I would reccomend to everyone. Would probably try to come around open to limit my wait."}
{"text":"You'll know this is a great spot to eat, because of all the people standing at the door happily waiting for their tables! The food is cooked with love and excellence, and most of it is locally sourced! The service was friendly and efficient, and the prices are reasonable. The coffee is actually really great as well!

They nailed it!"}
{"text":"Very good and hearty dessert. Maple bacon donut was delicious. Tip - if u see the donut you want while waiting for a table, buy it first then wait for your table."}
{"text":"FInding a place on yelp to try based solely on its score can be a hit or miss situation, but mere mention of a place that has buttermilk busicuits that are light and enormous was an immediate draw for me. I lived in the Carolinas in the states a number of years and biscuits are a sacred item there, done poorly and your usually out of business. I also can't give all the praise to the food when the service was without a doubt just as amazaing. My server a bearded gentlement was astute, polite and improved my experience greatly. I ordered the basic (subbing the toast for a biscuit as well as adding another one, yes I ate two :P) before even knowing how good they were, the reviews gave me a euphoric feeling about them. Like going to experience a great piece of art. Emma's nailed this in my opinion, everything from the potatoes (non greasy) to the crispy of the bacon was fantastic. I also was able to get almond milk for my black coffee, heaven. If you think your ready, don't eat the day before and make room lol"}
{"text":"not bad not bad.

The meat here is antibiotic free but sadly the eggs are not. I find this kind of disappointing since they try to source local/fresh/safe ingredients. It would be great if they could take this extra step with the eggs!

Since I'm vegetarian there was only one option for me, the daily quiche. But there is no doubt in my mind that sometimes the daily quiche might have meat in it. So there isn't a consistent vegetarian option here. The quiche was just ok, a bit bland for me.

The other poeple at my table really enjoyed their food though; the gingerbread pancakes where a hit and also I was told the bacon is the best bacon ever (not a selling point for me though!)

Also - not cheap. My quiche with side salad, coffee and juice came to $20 (before tip). 

The staff is super friendly and amazing but I would love to see more veg friendly options."}
{"text":"One hell of a find. I'm from the states, recently married, and wandered over to Toronto for an impromptu honeymoon. I normally review restaurants in the US but after finding our way here had to write a review. This place has some incredible meals. The eggs Benedict is incredible and the seasonal pancakes were were hands down some of the best I've ever tasted. Canada is definitely a food destination. Check this place out."}
{"text":"This brunch place is amazing ~~~ This is a super late review, but I had to make it... 
I came here around 11:30AM on a saturday and the place was crazy packed. However, the service here is 5/5 despite the craziness. Our waitress was attentive and caring even though she was running back and forth the whole time we were here.
now onto the food....
- EMMA'S BENNYS 4/5 
perfect poached eggs, the buttermilk biscuit is heavenly 
- THE ELVIS PANCAKES 5/5
fluffy as hell, my boyfriend devoured this so quick i thought he was going to choke 
& it comes with an awesome salted peanut butter caramel sauce 
- LAZY DAISY OATMEAL CAKE 4/5
pretty good oatmeal cake, not too crumbly and not too sweet
- COCONUT CREAM PIE DONUT 5/5
THIS IS SO SO SO GOOD
their donuts are world class. Honestly, they are on a different level. The donuts are super super sweet, the coconut cream was loaded inside the donut & right before they package it, they put a nice amount of whip cream on top. 
** COME SUPER EARLY TO GET THE DONUTS ON SATURDAY !! they sell out really quick !! *"}
{"text":"Destroys brunch. Everything is so fresh from the donuts to the sausages. Excellent service despite it being busy on the weekends. Get there early to avoid the lines, it will not disappoint!"}
{"text":"OMG. Purely the BEST Benny in Toronto. The biscuits are AMAZING! as is the donuts, French toast and all the baked goods and even take out meals. highly recommend."}
{"text":"Good ole Yelp led me to this location when visiting Canada over the weekend and I'm glad it did! There was a 40 min wait on a Saturday around 11:30 however well worth the wait as the food was amazing and the staff were super friendly and welcoming.  I had the gravy biscuits which were cooked so perfectly.  Even the fruits on the side were delicious :) dripped coffee recommended by the gentleman at the bar was by far the best coffee I had during my stay.  Hope to be back soon!"}
{"text":"Food was really yummy. One of the better brunch menus I've enjoyed. Can't wait to go back. 
Tip:Parties of 2 get seated quickly."}
{"text":"I heard good things about this place and convinced my friend to come try it with me and we weren't disappointed one bit. I also heard that there's an hour wait when you show up during lunchtime which is around the time that we showed up. Later on when we got our seat, I was talking to our server and he told me that it was like this every weekend and that we should try showing up at 8am even if they open at 9am to assure that we get a table.  We didn't care about the one hour wait because we really wanted to try this place out.

The only thing that bothered us was that they took our numbers down and told us that they would call us in about an hour when our table would be ready but they never did. Instead we had to show up and wait at the counter instead of waiting which was a bit annoying.

So we were finally seated at like 1:30pm and I have to say that it was worth the wait! I had Emma's Benny and it was to die for like I could of ate like 4 of them. It came with bacon, a side of potatoes that were \"okay\" and a fruit salad that was just \"meh\". Now I know to ask them to better cook the potatoes and to avoid the fruit salad when I go back this weekend.

My friend had the butter milk biscuit breakfast egg and avocado which looked good but she said that she regretted not ordering the Emma'a Benny. Another thing that bothered my with the whole eating experience was that the same waitress that took our number came to check on us a few times and when she asked me if I wanted more coffee and said yes, she would never come back with the refill.


The long wait time and the little service bumps that I only experienced with that one employee will not stop me from coming here again next weekend. If you're in the area on a Saturday or Sunday morning then I would highly recommend that you check this place out because it's definitely worth it!!

See you next weekend, Emma!"}
{"text":"I am the brunch lover and I must say this one is very special and yummy especially good service and server speed so fast."}
{"text":"I visited Emma's for brunch several weeks ago with my brother, and really enjoyed the experience. We arrived around 9:30am on a Saturday morning, and were surprised to learn that they were full! How did it get full in 30 minutes?! It seemed like they opened before 9am (the hours online say 9am). Anyway, I left my number with a staff member, and they called me about 20 minutes later telling me that a table for two was now available. 

The restaurant was packed with a lot of families and kids, and it could get a little loud. 

In terms of the food, I really loved how you could get half a Benny! So my brother ordered the breakfast sandwich (the Breakwich), I got half a Benny, and we split one order of pancakes. 

I loved the Benny, specially because they used their famous butter biscuit over the standard English muffin. The size and price was great and it left me pretty full. The pancakes were good, but not great. I prefer my pancakes more moist, but I did enjoy the lemon ricotta - not too sweet, but tasty. 

The service was spot on - friendly, knowledgeable and not overly distracting (our waiter did check on us, but did not do it too much whereby you are interrupted mid-sentence every 5 minutes).

I was disappointed to learn that they did not have any beignets on special. I visited Emma's once before and they happened to have beignets on special, and they were amazing. 

Overall, I really enjoyed my experience at Emma's and will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Lets just start by saying YUMMM
After reading the reviews I came here on a Saturday around noon expecting a huge line up, which there was. I was told it would be an hr wait , which wasnt a big deal because things seemed to be moving well. We decided to go dwn the street to timmies for a tea while we waited as they took our number dwn and call you when the table is ready. We came back after about 30mins and were told that they called( which was B.S because phone did not ring once). Luckily they didnt make us wait at the end of the line and said next table wold be ours. Which took about 15mins or so. 
Once seated I went with the pancakes , I'm not a fan or ricotta or cooked fruits at all. But... these pancakes were amazzzzing. The lemon flavour in the ricotta was just perfect w the bluberries. I didnt even need syrup on my pancakes as the flavour was just perfect. 
My partner just got the reg ol eggs toast potatoes and substituted his meat for a fruit salad that i ate. Hes not into fruits and only other substitute was pork items which we dnt eat and salad. One of the negatives is  if you dont eat pork theres no alternatives, no turkey bacon and even the beans hve pork in it which was a disappointment. To help I ordered him a biscuit w homemade jam which was out of this world. 
Everything was great and cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"Beautiful establishment.  From the visual display from the front window to the adorable decor inside.  Definitely a hidden gem.  Just from overhearing the front attendant stating they've only been open for 3 months!  It's crazy packed!  Our server was Jeremy!  Cool cat indeed!  

We got the maple bacon donut, 2 coffees, fries, gingerbread pancakes and classic breakfast!

Totes amazing thank you for the wonderful experience yall!

Great vibes and beautiful welcoming staff!"}
{"text":"If heaven serves brunch like this place, then please, take me NOW!

We ordered the pemeal bennies and the blueberry pancakes with ricotta. The eggs were fresh, oozing succulent yolk as I pierced them. The pemeal bacon was soft and juicy, waiting to be chewed up. The bed on which these 2 lay was a freshly-baked biscuit. The whole scene was covered in delicious sauce. Altogether, delivered to my mouth via a fork, sent my tastebuds on a euphoric sing-along. The side of potatoes, tossed in seasoning and oil, roasted on a grill, was the perfect accompaniment. I

Now onto the pancakes.. the fluffy and mouth-watering pancakes.. These had the perfect berry-to-dough proportion and were smothered in sweet ricotta. A combination that made me want the same thing for dinner. 

Service was also quick and friendly! I'll definitely return."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday for brunch with my boyfriend after seeing it highly recommended on Blogto. It was a long wait!! Probably waited a bit more than an hour.

Biscuits and Gravy ($11)
I'm generally not a fan of gravy, but this gravy was AMAZING! I can't image how much butter and fat was added into this recipe for it to taste so good. Oh well, not like I eat it everyday. Love how there were bacon bits in the creamy sausage gravy topped on the buttermilk biscuit = definition of fatty heaven. The scrambled eggs were really good - soft and made just right being slightly runny just the way I like it. It's so hard to find a place that makes good scrambled eggs as most places just over cook them. I personally didn't really like their special hot sauce made in house. 

Quiche of the day ($12)
While quantities last! They served a wild mushroom quiche - rich in mushroom flavor and loaded with mushroom pieces in the quiche. Perfect for mushroom lovers. The crust was nice and flaky and the egg layer was nice and spongy. Really flavorful. Ordered roasted potatoes on the side, they were ok, nothing special - I prefer my potatoes being more crispy.

We also added an eggs benny on the side for $6. This was typical, nothing special."}
{"text":"This place gets 4 stars solely on their pancakes which were fluffy fresh and delicious - possibly one the best I've had and I am not usually a pancake person, with a dollop of butter in the middle that sinks into the pancake as it melts. They didn't have their previous flavours with the ricotta cheese but today's banana chip was great. Mimosa was good tasting but served in terrible water cup. Side order of eggs $3 good, chicken Cobb salad was saved by the tasty dressing otherwise the chicken was dry and bland. Classic breakfast alright - we would rather have the crisp bacon rather than the thick slice pork belly. Decor was clean and simple, service was great. Yes we will return for the pancakes!"}
{"text":"Really nice and quaint brunch spot on St Clair.  Good food, good speedy service.  Exactly what you want from a brunch spot.  They also have pastries at the front you can choose from while you wait as I can imagine it's busier on the weekend.  Went here on a Wednesday afternoon waited 5 minutes for a table and had a PB and J cookie while I waited (highly recommend) that or a bacon donut.  Had the eggs benny and changed my side to their house salad with honey Dijon, shared a side of pancakes, green tea lemonade and a side of extra crispy bacon.  All were delightful!  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I was looking for a brunch place on the way home from Toronto and found this little gem on yelp. It's a bit off the beaten path as it's outside of downtown Toronto in the more residential neighborhoods.

The place gets pretty packed on weekends so we had to wait about 35 minutes. It's fairly small with some tables spread out and a longer table along the window looking into the street. Very much has a country kitchen kind of feel.

After we sat, I ordered \"The Classic\" which consists of eggs, bacon, potatoes and your choice of toast or a biscuit. I went with the biscuit... Everything was delicious (especially the biscuit) and came out fairly quick considering how long it took us to sit down. Staff was also really cool and gave us the history of the place and how they came up with the menu.

Toronto is a food paradise in general, and Emma's Country Kitchen is a small part of why. Very good breakfast in a likely unexplored part of town by tourist, but known by locals."}
{"text":"My first time here and it won't be the last. I didn't give 5 stars because our food took exceptionally long and people who were seated before and after us didn't wait as long for their food. I didn't mind the 45 min wait at 11am, I knew going that there would be a lineup. 

I got the benny with avocado and the boy got the classics with a side of peameal. The food was fresh and delicious.  Unfortunately no donuts, they sold out at about 10:30 but you can call ahead and save one!"}
{"text":"This review is long overdue. This place is not only incredibly charming but has absolutely stunning food. I find a general lack of creativity in breakfast, offerings here are creative, clever and heartwarmingly familiar."}
{"text":"A fine modern diner serving some hearty brunch food that shouldn't be missed!

We heard about the wonderful and yummy dishes that Emma's served but it finally took us 3 tries to visit them (each time was closed due to holidays). So we were glad to see them open on a bright Sunday morning - it also turned out we were not the only ones as there was a line up for 10+ people outside - so you know something must be good cooking inside. But fret not, the staff can take your number and phone you when the table is ready - you can spend the time strolling along and checking out stores on St Clair.

On to the food - once you are inside, you find there is takeout counter with a fridge of homemade goodies like salads, dressings and monster size biscuits! But even more exciting are the custom donuts like cereal+milk, stuffed Oreo and maple bacon . Even if you can't stay, I would receive grabbing someone of the prepared salads which looks amazing.

Inside, the restaurant goes back quite far and the service is very friendly and fast. We ordered the eggs Benny (replaced the ham with avocado) and the lemon ricotta pancakes with a side of peameal.  We got our food within 5-6 mins which was very impressive and it looked perfect. The eggs were softly poached on their homemade biscuits which I think is the star of the dish. Nice helping of home fries rounded it out. But the true star is the pancakes - I got a stack of 4 big fluffy pancakes with a giant dallop of lemon ricotta on top. This is way pancakes should be made - soft, light and full of blueberries!!! You could put some syrup on it but the ricotta and pancakes could be eaten by itself! The peameal was a good balance to the sweetness. As you can tell, we were extremely happy customers. The price is bit higher but well worth it.

We'll be back for more!"}
{"text":"Came here with a few friends today and I had the gri pla parfait with a biscuit for my meal. It was delicious, like actually delicious, perfect balanced with almond slivers, pecans and raisins. The Greek yoghurt for some reason tasted better than any other greek yoghurt I've had in recent memory so it really added to the richness of the meal, yet at the same time it felt light. 

The buttermilk biscuit was a bit underwhelming though, it looked great but tasted like it had too much baking soda in it. 

For desert I had a lemon square which was delicious, it had a soft gooey centre and a perfect tangy favour."}
{"text":"I've been excited to try this place for awhile and read many feat reviews about it!  Unfortunately when I visited I ordered the biscuits and gravy and the dish was a little too salty. I wasn't able to finish the plate because it was very salty. I will return to try the eggs Benny one day though."}
{"text":"Our go to brunch spot in Toronto. They tend to be very slow in the morning since it's so popular but it's definitely worth the wait. All their dishes are full of flavours even though they are just simple brunch food! We especially enjoy their homemade sage sausage, biscuits, and pancake with ricotta cheese. Strongly recommend this place to anyone visiting Toronto."}
{"text":"My partner was nice to get this pancake for take-out to bring home for me to try out! This is the cinnamon pancake, as the blueberry version sold out. It's very flavourful and delicious. Go for it if you're a fan of cinnamon! Personally, I loved the blueberry pancakes much better!"}
{"text":"Arriving on a Sunday around 9:15 am and that was no wait for a table of 2. Though busy but the turnover rate was fast as a lot of the patrons were family and they did not linger too long after they finished their meals.

The food here is fresh and delicious! Almost everything is made in house. I can taste the care and the attention of details they put in their dish!

biscuit and gravy ($11) with a side order of bacon ($4)
quiche of the day ($12)

Quiche was just heavenly! Love the butter crust! The texture was smooth, creamy and rich. Similar to creme brulee! Pro Tip: Skip Fruit Salad Side, though has a good mixture of fruits but it did not taste fresh. 

And make sure you order bacon, you won't regret that.

Coffee ($3) might be one of the weakest link. It was served lukewarm and tasted muddy. 

Service was friendly but since the restaurant was quite busy, you do need to wave the staff down if you want refills and other request.

Their doughnuts and buttermilk biscuits can be order to go. Good option if you don't feel like waiting for a table but just want a snack."}
{"text":"Came here for a Sunday brunch and wait time was around 45 minutes at around 11am. By 12pm, people were told that the wait would be over an hour ( I was seated right by the front counter so I heard much of the conversation of patrons coming in). Be prepared to wait if you are keen on eating here. We ordered a few items here. Bacon donut included. It had a good chewy texture and was not overly sweet. The bacon on it reminded me of shredded asian pork. Be warned that they were sold out of donuts by 12pm. I ordered the eggs Benedict on a homemade biscuit. Portion size was quite generous. The peameal bacon was good and the biscuit was a tad dry and made the meal very heavy. My friend ordered the french toast and my god, it was heavenly. The pimento cheese on it brought it to a next level of deliciousness. I recommend you share this dish with someone as it is really heavy but really a must try at Emma's."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong by going to this place. Tasty food and he service is very friendly and helpful, especially to those who are travelling."}
{"text":"Impress your co-workers/friends by special ordering mini-donuts.  Just did it for my work and they were great!
Still go here frequently but mostly take out now.  There are line-ups on the weekend before opening."}
{"text":"This small cozy place is located right on St. Clair. I went on a Sunday for brunch and the wait was about an hour for a table. So needless to say it gets real busy for brunch!

Service was super friendly and quick. The place is managed quite well and there are lots of servers around to handle the volume they get.

For brunch, the popular go-to is the eggs Benedict but make sure you brought an appetite because the serving is hefty! I've had the Farm fresh french toast and that was pretty amazing. The pumpkin Pancakes are a must-try.

Parking out in front is green p patrolled, but I believe it's free for a certain period on the weekends. Just make sure you allocate enough for wait time in case it's busy!"}
{"text":"This had got to be the best biscuit breakfast sandwich ever! You can even buy the biscuit mix and just add buttermilk ... Yummy yum. Its little out of your ordinary brunch spot location but Yelpers should visit ASAP!"}
{"text":"The thing about breakfast is that it can be (1) sweet, (2) savory, or (3) sweet and savory. As I could still taste my first breakfast of Cinnamon French Toast from Aunties and Uncles, I needed a savory second breakfast. I ordered a traditional plate of eggs and sausage. What arrived was a little more than I expected. The toast was two GIANT hunks of bread, the sausage had a very particular, but good taste, and the eggs were cooked perfectly. I reluctantly passed on their biscuits (which get rave reviews) and their other baked goods, which I will definitely enjoy next time.

Emma's had good service and normal coffee. Overall, it was friendly and seemed to be consistent. It was a more than the classic diner experience I was expecting.

General Diner Cooking Rules:
1. Eggs will be slightly runny if you order them over easy.
2. Pork will be just barely cooked or charred until it is an unrecognizable meat.
3. There will be very little seasoning. Seasoning is your job with the choices on your table.

Emma's was just more attentive to their customers and more focused on plating good food than you usually see at places that subscribe to the \"General Diner Cooking Rules\". I would recommend swinging by for a second breakfast, if you get the chance."}
{"text":"I am soooo happy there's another brunch option with early opening hours of St. Clair besides Boom now! Though the space is small and its often hard to get a seat, it's well worth it for the delicious, reasonably priced food, friendly staff and kid friendly environment! The mains are a tad on the pricey side but are filling and delicious. We were wondering what to get our 3 year old without having to spend $12 on a dish for him and then saw the sides - they have a breakfast biscuit with cheese, egg & bacon that is just perfect!"}
{"text":"Have been hearing about Emma's Country Kitchen (@emmacountrykitc) on twitter for a while and one Sunday, we decided to head there for Brunch when no specific cravings pop up.

Nothing much in terms of decor, very simple with the kitchen at the back but there was quite a few thoughtful touches throughout the place such as the vintage bottles as vases, red checkered fabric as displace case backdrop and the cutlery chandelier. 
When we got there it was packed and the only table lefts was the smaller bar tables at the front.

Iced coffee and fresh squeeze orange juice

 Emma's Benny $13
~ warm & fluffy buttermilk biscuit top with house cured peameal, poached eggs and smothered in mousseline sauce w/ a side of griddled red skin potato
The poached egg was perfectly cook, the mousseline / hollandaise sauce was just as perfect and love the fresh fluffy biscuit. I could easily devour anything on this plate on it's own but having everything together in one bite is just heavenly. .

 Memories of the farm French Toast $12
~ ECK signature homestyle white bread spiraled w/ Ontario apple cinnamon compote, soaked in a buttermilk custard and griddled until golden brown. Served w/ whipped honey and citrus butter and warm maple syrup (w/ a side of bacon $3)
Need I say more after that description?! It's just a creamy yummy goodness 
Oh and let's not forget to add the bacon for the sweet and savory combination.

 Verdict :
Love every part of our Brunch here and will definitely be back.
Will have to try some of their fresh baked goodies next time we are here 
or even get some of their bring home soups / meals"}
{"text":"Small and simple inside, there is nothing about the interior that gives away how good the food is.  I am a huge fan of eggs Benedict and theirs is among the best.  It is served on an incredibly delicious fresh biscuit with a sauce that neither too rich nor too light. I've also had tried French Toast which is deadly and the classic breakfast which is cooked perfectly. They know what they are doing. I'd love to try their baked goods, particularly based upon what I have tried, but I barely eat the rest of the day after going here.  

There are few brunches in the city that are better."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch with two others. We waited about half an hour for a table. Everything about this place from the service to the food is unpretentious. Great fresh ingredients. My friends had the eggs Benny,  and the house cured peameal was thick cut and flavourful. the dish was a bit on the soggy side though as the biscuit was soaked through with the egg and sauce. Have to say that they did perfectly cook the eggs!
I had the chopped salad, it had the right amount of dressing and really fresh greens. I had a biscuit on the side too it was good but I think the other reviews had maybe over-sold it a bit.
I'd come back here again soon though!"}
{"text":"Arrived on a Sunday morning just after 11 and waited about 40-45 for a table.  Our server was very friendly and we did not have to wait too long to order at all.   I ordered the eggs benedict, pretty simple looking dish compared to others I've had, however this benny is by far the best I've had in this city bar none.  The country biscuits, and the potatoes had so much flavour on its own, the taste of the hollandaise sauce was an added bonus.  I didn't think that it would be very filling but I was wrong and really didn't have to eat again until dinner."}
{"text":"The country kitchen of St. Clair is always a winner. I don't live near here, but if I did I'd probably be here at least three times a week. 

I can't get enough of their biscuits, they *really* listen to their customers' egg orders (and I can pull some Sally from When Harry Met Sally shit from time to time) and their red potato breakfast sides are rosemary-ed perfection. 

If it's cold out, try their scratch-made soup of the day and if it's warm and there's a line (it's pretty small, there often is.) enjoy their sunshine soaked bench out front. 

PEPPER POINTS for opening @ 9 for breakfast on weekends. Sometimes a gal is up earlier than the hungover hipsters."}
{"text":"Bottomless drip! Quality food! Reasonable prices!

One of my most favorite breakfast spots in the city. 

Small menu but everything is so delicious and locally sourced. The prices are so fair and reasonable considering the high quality. Their bread is made onsite and they sell it as well! I'm addicted to their rye bread! ALSO their drip coffee is to die for as are their baked goods(lazy daisy oatmeal cake!!!!

Try this place out for a great quality breakfast! Om nom nom!!!"}
{"text":"The food is phenomenal, and affordable. Simple, delicious, comforting and cozy, just like a country kitchen. Go!"}
{"text":"I thought i had decided on the breakwich while waiting for a table. Then I saw the blueberry ricotta pancakes served at a table. It was a tough choice but I ordered the pancakes. They were so fluffy and filling. I had almost half of them and then gave up. Definitely a sharing kind of dish.

My friend ordered the classic breakfast with a biscuit in place of the toast for $1. I would've ordered the bacon instead of sausage but I'm so happy she got the sausage. It was so flavourful.

Maybe next time i'll get one of their speciality donuts to go"}
{"text":"We are regulars here and love it so. Awesome food and service. Not advisable for groups larger than 4 and get there early for the yummy baked goods. Almost always a bit of a wait so be patient as it really is worth that wait."}
{"text":"Fabulous food and fast, friendly service!  The blueberry pancakes with lemon mascarpone were light, fluffy, and very tasty.  The Benny dish was also excellent.  Coffee was good, a bit on the strong side (as I like it), and refills were plentiful.  The decor is a little stark but still nice for an overall positive ambiance."}
{"text":"We have been in Toronto for a week and ate at some very expensive restaurants by far... Emmas had the best meal we've eaten all week. The buttermilk biscuit the red potatoes just excellent my wife had a quiche that was in two or three different layers and it was melt in your mouth GOOD ! Nice portions... Quick and Excellent services. Really good prices DONT PASS UP EMMA's"}
{"text":"We waited about an hour for brunch on a Friday which was a bit surprising. The food was okay but definitely not worth the wait. I also don't really understand why they weren't seating people at times where there were empty tables available. Not very efficient. Will likely not come back."}
{"text":"Quality of the food at Emma's is really good, but the selection is limited. We had their special (French Toast), Ham Sandwich and Biscuit with bacon and egg. Reasonable price. Good and friendly service."}
{"text":"Excellent service and delicious food.  Mark this place down for bottomless coffee.
There can be a wait and note that it closes at 3 on the weekends so if you are hungover and really want to eat here, you might have to force yourself to get out of bed...or off the bathroom floor."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Had the granola and wanted to order more for take out! It's really busy on the weekends for brunch so be prepared to wait in line."}
{"text":"I've been here for brunch twice and have loved the food both times. I would highly recommend trying the biscuits, which are light and fluffy and delicious.  The donuts are apparently also great, as my dining mates would attest. I love the breakwich, which is a great little breakfast sandwich on a biscuit. It only costs $7 so I get it with a side, like potatoes, and that's more than enough to fill me up.

Service is super friendly and nice as well, and the interior is cozy and warm. The only downside is the wait -- we came at 10:45 and waited for about an hour on a Saturday morning. But if you're willing to wait, it's definitely a delicious brunch at the right prices."}
