{"text":"I love the Mr. Greek chain and have eaten at many. This one does not live up to their normal standard. The food portions are small and the pork is fatty. I can usually overlook the inconvenience of having to order at the counter and wait to bring the food to my table.  In this, it just isn't worth it.  I will continue to visit Mr. Greek locations, just not this one."}
{"text":"Over the Christmas holidays I went to Mr. Greek Express in Aurora to pick up an order.  I placed my order for Chicken Souvlaki with rice potatoes and greek salad.  While there I watched the cook put rice into the silver container and stir the rice around with his hands?  Part of his arm was in it as well as the container is deep.  That was not the worst part of it, he had rings on!  I was disgusted!  I told the girl at the container and she didn't care.  She offered me something else in place of it!  I will never go back there again.  Sad really because when it first came to Aurora it was good and then a change of people working and running brought it down.  I have never come across this at Mr. Greek's in Newmarket and will continue to go there if I want greek food."}
{"text":"I was delighted to discover that they have a drive thru, and several good vegetarian options. I ordered the Spanokopita and it was delicious.  I will be back, because I am always looking for healthy fast food options."}
{"text":"Food was ok. But for fast food style \"Greek\" food it's too expensive.  I miss the old mr. Greek restaurant.  It was full service and was the same price."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a very weird set up. One side has only booths while the other side has only tables. When I went, the table side was closed down for whatever reason.  The cashier I ordered from looked angry for some reason but she took my order just the same. The good thing about this place is that the food is served pretty quickly.   I ordered the chicken pita which was really good. The chicken was cooked really well but really no work went into forming the pita itself.  Overall, it was decent experience."}
{"text":"The food here is merely ok. I have a couple of complaints though:  The girl working the cash register was not cheery or even the slightest bit cordial to me as I ordered. No, \"what can I get you\" or \"how are you to tonight?\". Call me crazy, but shouldn't the staff be welcoming or at least nice to customers?   I was informed that a special was no longer in effect. I wasn't told \"sorry\" or \"unfortunately\". Just a basic \"that has ended\", tough luck basically. One of the reasons I came here was for the value, and now that incentive has ended.   The girl preparing the food was wearing gloves however she kept scratching her hair with one of her hands. Not very hygienic.   A couple of times, I have noticed that tables had not been cleared and that staff members would actually sit in the seating area and eat their own food or even sleep (with their head on the table) in plain sight.   I have never seen anyone resembling a managerial type here, but they have some issues that need to be addressed before I return here."}
{"text":"this place is great. If you're a hamster! smallest serving size for $15 a plate... This is in comparison to other Mr. Greek chains."}
{"text":"Just visited this location after a year with my fiancé. Service was horrible seemed like they didn't even know their own menu. I ordered a greek chicken salad and gyros on a pita with greek fries. Once the chicken salad arrived i could tell the chicken wasn't cooked long enough. The chicken was pink inside, i asked for it to be cooked longer and the person working said she would bring it back to me. She came back with the chicken it was still pink. I brought it to the actual chef/ cook and fully showed her each pink part and she continuously said she didnt see it and that it was white. I asked for my money back which i recieved but the fact a \"chef\" / cook would say shes unable to see the pink was ridiculous it looked completely uncooked. I wouldnt advise anyone to order chicken from here you might get really sick. Learn how to cook..."}
{"text":"Greeted as soon as I walked in. Asked for the customer favorite. Was recommended the classic chicken dinner. I recieved it in 10 mins. I ordered chicken with potatoes and vegetables which was a bad decision b/c it didn't taste as well as I hoped it did. The chicken was great though. The venue was clean, great customer service from the waitresses, they made me feel at home and I left with $20 less in my pocket. Great service, alright food to be fair I'll give it another shot real soon."}
{"text":"We used to eat here a lot, so yesterday when we decided to pick up dinner I was really looking forward to it.   What a fail.   They basically reduced the chicken to half a portion, and it was dry and burned. The rice was hard and looked day old.  To add insult to injury, they have increased prices. Less food, horrible quality and more money!!!  I won't be going back. You can get better Greek food in malls."}
{"text":"I ordered a chicken souvlaki dinner and sprite for pickup and when it was brought home, my drink was missing.  I called to ask why it wasnt included and the man who answered said that the manager noticed it wasn't incl in your bag when you left.  So I asked if someone could deliver it as I know they have delivery and I don't live far away and he said that no one can do that.  He then offered to give me a free sprite the next time I come and I asked for his name and he HUNG UP!   Now, on to the food... Idk why everything I got was full of sodium! The salt level is crazy almost to the point where its inedible.  Sadly, I will not be returning... I really wanted to get food at taste of Greek cuisine but they r closed for renovation.   very disappointed with the food here.  This was a waste of money."}
{"text":"Yelp needs to allow a NO STAR rating! This place is the worst place I have visited in well over 30 years.  The service is horrific, horrific, horrific.   Save yourself the aggravation and go anywhere but here.  Very disorganized, no leadership.  All levels of management need to be retrained or fired.  Corporate need to pull the franchise if there is a franchisee.  Service here was always below par but the managed to lower the bar further!    A same, considering the food over all isn't bad.  Definitely not worth the wait!  At least they took the\"Express\" from Mr. Greek.  I have attempted calling them to speak to a manager, but get a busy single.  Over an hour.  I'm sure the phone is off the hook."}
{"text":"Express doesn't actually mean fast nor do the prices reflect that this is not a full service restaurant.   Place your order at the counter, where the cashier tries to awkwardly up sell you on everything (as if she's working on commission)  and then your food is brought later to the table and not at record speed.    Our two seater booth was uncomfortably food courtish.  Food was standard Greek fare without exceptional flavouring.    My pork souvlaki was tender but not memorable and the Greek Salad really skimped on the feta.   If you're here for a quick lunch, don't depend on it."}
{"text":"I would give it a 0/5 if I could. Worst Greek food ever. We came here on a weekday night, and we were the only ones in the restaurant (coincidence? I think not). We ordered the classic chicken souvlaki and chicken gyro plate on grilled veggies with a side of Greek fries. Both the meats + veggies were reheated up in a pan.... needless to say, the \"grilled veggies\" were greasy, and the meats were tasteless. The tzatzuki sauce tasted like month old Greek yogurt, it was incredibly thick, more like a paste than sauce. But here comes to worst part, our Greek fries were swimming in this red sauce mixed with feta cheese. The Greek fries tasted more like mashed potato with tomato sauce. All of this came up to a little over $30. If you're thinking of trying this place out, please just SAVE YOUR MONEY."}
{"text":"Great meal . Lots of food.  Hot and fresh and served quickly.  It's on the pricey side about $20.00 for dinner.  Have been a few times and yet to be disappointed. ."}
{"text":"Went here today with my valentine for lunch. When you come for lunch isn't there an expectation that the service is perhaps a little bit faster than at any other time of the day? This way you can get back to work in time. Or maybe it's just me? Regardless, there is nothing express about this place. The service is extremely slow   We waited at our table for almost 15 minutes before we were served which made our lunch date extremely tight for time. The food was OK, but could have been better. Keep in mind that I ordered their burger. I will reveal the key to a great hamburger... The bun!!. If you want to make a great burger give me to great bun. Their buns are extremely dry.  To their credit, we were greeted when we arrived and were shown where to get a menu to get started. It only went downhill from there. I would not recommend this place if you are pressed for time.  I'm also not a big fan of restaurants that serve  ketchup in individual packets. I know, I know... You don't go to a Greek place for ketchup and hamburger. Fair enough. But, if you are going to serve hamburgers on your menu, ketchup belongs in bottles for the tables."}
{"text":"This place used to be good when it opened.  We hadn't been in a year or so, but it has become a classic case of ,\"Where is the beef?\". We ordered the same family meal we had had previously, but got about half the food we used to.  We all left hungry.  Never again."}
{"text":"Food is pricey, one of the staff forgot my side salad. Poor customer service, decor is average, the food is not as good as other greek restaurants. I guess since its an express location they don't put much effort into quality"}
{"text":"I came at 8:15 (45 minutes before closing).... I came with two others and ordered 4 souvlaki dinners. I get it, you're closing soon but a little more politeness or even a fake smile would be nice...  I also have a part-time job working at the food court so I know what it feels like but no matter what you gotta bite your tongue and serve customers!  There were two girls working...the one taking orders clearly wanted to go home and even told us \"take out only, sorry\".   So they're chitchatting making our food, somehow they messed up my order and made me 1 pork stick instead of 2. They had an extra chicken one hanging around so they gave me that one instead...oh well!   At least everything else was correct and food wasn't so bad."}
{"text":"When it first opened several years ago this used to be a good alternative to going to a regular sit-down greek restaurant. Mr. Greek food (and prices unfortunately) with fast food convenience. Over the past couple years however the quality has gone down dramatically, to the point where I won't eat here anymore. On more than one occasion I've ordered the chicken souvlaki dinner and it hasn't tasted like chicken. This is not an exaggeration, it's actually tasted like a cross between lunch meat and a sponge. I am guessing this is caused by the half-cooked skewers sitting in water/brine for extended periods of time prior to being flash-grilled and served. If that isn't bad enough, the owner/manager is an ass and they nickel and dime you for extra tzaziki. If I'm paying 40 bucks for a dinner for 2 at a semi fast-food restaurant, why do you need to charge me $1 for an extra teaspoon of yogurt?  Heed my advice and go to Fire Pit down the road instead. You will not be sorry."}
{"text":"I ordered a combo, however they refused to give me my drink... expecting me to pay for it when prior to paying the cashier said the drink is included in the combo"}
{"text":"Business owner/manager is unethical, stay away. First off, the food here has never been that stellar to begin with. But nonetheless it's always been a go-to place as it's close by and we've always found the service pretty decent.    However on our previous order we had found raw chicken in my wife's \"Classic Diner\" entrée? When we called back to inform them of this blunder the manager at the time was quite apologetic and offered to comp one of the entrees for next time. Beautiful.   Well a few weeks later we thought we'd give them another chance and order again. So when I placed the order guess what? No record kept of this incident? How convenient eh? Just a quick \"sorry\" from Shereff the manager and that was it.   Well there are other establishments in North Toronto that are far better for Greek food so no real skin off our back. However quite bewildered over the situation my wife phoned back a few minutes later to inquire further? The manager suddenly offered to cover an entrée if we came tonight. Really?? Sorry Shereff but too little too late amigo. By this time we had already ordered from another restaurant in town as we were both starving and you had burned your bridges.   So not only have they permanently lost our business - they've also garnered a very  resounding \"negative\" social media review to boot! Good job!"}
{"text":"My wife and I used to drive by here on our way home for work and regularly go through the drive through for Classic Chicken Souvlaki dinners.  Not the best greek food out there, but the drive through was convenient.    However, the past 2 times they've refused to fill an order for the \"Classic\" option (2 sides instead of 1) as apparently they don't do the classic through the drive-thru.  It's not like it adds any extra containers or anything, but now they adamantly refuse to do it.  If I could give 0 stars I would, for the price there are much better non-chain-restaurant options in Brampton who are now just as inconvenient as Mr Greek Express."}
{"text":"On my lunch break, I popped in. The service was fast and the food was fresh. I'd never seen a Mr. Greek Express before and was surprised to see it had a Drive Thru! It has some tables and booths, decorated like the full sized Mr. Greek restaurants. The food was great and I'd definitely go back!"}
{"text":"This location is anything but fast. It's almost like waiting in a Swiss chalet drive thru, especially if you are ordering lamb. Their food is generally fresh but nothing to brag about. I do love their rice and ask for extra sauce on it, which is just the gravy from the potatoes. The people who work here always seem mad or annoyed which can feel awkward. Only go usually if my parents want a wrap or my dad is in the mood for lamb. It's a healthier fast food option but not my first choice"}
{"text":"This plate of chicken cost me $17, when I asked him if I can have more chicken they said head office doesn't allow more than 3 ounces. What a rip off."}
{"text":"My experience was a pleasant one. Friendly service and the food was delicious, and im picky about my food.... Not sure why the negative reviews..."}
{"text":"I have been to this location a few times. The food is just okay. For a Mr. Greek \"Express,\" there is nothing quick about it. It wasn't too busy when I went yesterday but there were about 4 people waiting for food ahead of me. I couldn't understand why. But when I got my food and my sister hadn't received hers, I saw one of the three girls working drop the fries into the fryer.. the entire time we were waiting, they didn't think to start cooking my sister's fries.  We got our food to go. When we got home and my sister started eating her chicken souvlaki pita, she noticed there was no lettuce. It was just tzatziki and chicken. Who forgets lettuce in a wrap?!?! The rice she got on the side was overcooked and 10% was dark and hard. Again, it was not busy and the three ladies working did not seem very attentive to what they were doing. I am not visiting this location again."}
{"text":"Used the drive through several times and ate inside. The turnover of the staff is very concerning, I don't think I came across same people evry time I come through. Food is just okay, usually made relatively quickly, but if you use the drive through, have to remember that it's not fast food, they still need time to cook it all, so you will be sitting in the car at the window for a while."}
{"text":"Found a hair in my food :( Service was rude, I asked the lady if they had any roasted chicken and got an eye roll (My bad though, thought I was at Jimmy the Greeks lol) The place reeked of dirty mop. I love Mr Greek but this location has got to be the worst one I've eaten at. I hate giving bad reviews, but I also can't imagine having anyone else come here without knowing first."}
{"text":"This place is terrible. We are here right now for lunch.  We waited 20 minutes for our basic salads with the pre cooked chicken.    1.  The portions are so small for the price. I ordered a chicken souvlaki- original size with only salad. I got limp brown lettuce and 6 small pieces of chicken that were so small they were bite sized. The size of the salad would be what another restaurant would serve as a side salad. I will need to get more food as it isn't enough.   2. My co worker ordered a Greek salad with a chicken breast. The chicken breast is burnt, and the lettuce is also brown and limp.  The lettuce was swimming in dressing.   3.  The person prepping the food wiped her nose on the top of her hand and continued food prep. She cut up vegetables and meat on the same service which is far from clean.   4. The person cleaning the condiment station also just took dirty napkins from someone's discarded food plate and put them back into the dispenser.   All in all we should have gone to another restaurant in the area, as there are many."}
{"text":"They have issues with being clean.  There is a funky smell like the mop head hasn't been changed in a while and the floor is a tad sticky in places.  Big time turn off.  At best the food is OK but it doesn't live up to my standards and possibly the companies standards.  Everything seems a bit over-cooked or dry.  You just don't have that warm fuzzy feeling of being welcome or appreciated,  I love Greek food but next time i will love it somewhere else.  I'm not feeling the love here.  The best part of coming here was getting outside for a breath of fresh air."}
{"text":"Every time I go here its either new staff or under new management. The food used to be better when the staff gave a damn. Now it seems as if its minimum wage workers sloughing out assembly line food with no attention to detail. I still go if Im in the neighbourhood but its a hit or a miss."}
{"text":"This place deserves a 1 star. I've been here twice. First time was for an office function. Second time on my own. Both times were disappointing.   The first issue is speed. I don't know if your grill have an issue or something but I don't think it should take that long to prepare food. They should chop off the \"express\" from their name. I feel like the staff are just genuinely slow. They make the salad at the speed of a snail. My mousaka took maybe 20 minutes to make. I know why. This place is obviously not run by people who understand or care about Greek food. The moussaka must have been frozen and the prep time was to defrost and heat it. I guess that's what I get for coming to a franchised greek restaurant.   Their service is basically non-existent, which is ok for me for a fast food place. But what's unacceptable is how they consistently get orders wrong. I even see you inputting POTATOES as side on the POS. How do you end up giving me rice instead? When I came with the office team it was the same. Turtle paced production, and getting orders wrong.   Now onto the food itself, it's edible. But it's far from the quality of Greek food you can get elsewhere.  They don't even have some of the food they advertise like the smoothies.  This franchise needs to shut down. At $15-19 per entrée (with salad and sides), you're paying premium price for fast food quality food with a fat chance of them getting your order wrong."}
{"text":"This place used to be a regular haunt of mine when they first opened in the late 90's. I hadn't been back in years so decided give it a try again and was appalled. The original owners (Greek) have sold up and the current owners obviously have NO experience or knowledge on preparing Greek food. My souvlaki on a pita was totally uninspired as was my boyfriends sandwich. Service was slow and the staff indifferent."}
{"text":"I used to go here with my daughter every month or so as she has lessons nearby and she loves Greek food.  The service seems to have gone downhill in the last few months.  Very unfriendly and disinterested staff.   The food is decent but I doubt we will be back.  There are many other places to eat in the area and I would rather spend my money at a more friendly and welcoming restaurant."}
{"text":"This place lacks in customer service. I didn't like the attitude of the staff. They were not very friendly. Particularly the girl who forgot our extra tzaziki dips. You know who you are!          - disappointed The food is decent though. This place is stingy on the extra tzaziki, and can be pricey."}
{"text":"Well, the place certainly is express. The food is fast - it's also cold - it's ok I guess, but the place feels greasy kind of and doesn't smell like it should. It's fast food Greek food - don't expect too much - don't think I will go back."}
{"text":"Typical Greek fast food joint and nothing special about it. I was caught off guard on the pricing of the chicken souvlaki plate which costs an average of $10-12 at most Places, but was charged $20! Is the chicken made out of platinum? What the heck? I opted to order a chicken on a pita which wasn't really filling and that cost me $10!  Btw, they have a menu on the board with no pricing, so make sure you ask for the price before you place your order!"}
{"text":"Nothing really caught the attention of my taste buds. There wasn't anything special that made this place stand out from the rest of the Greek restaurants. I got takeout. Had the Classic Chicken Souvlaki (Greek salad included) with two sides. (Rice and Greek potatoes). The chicken was good. The potatoes could have been softer and could have came with more of that gravey-sauce. Without the saauucee, the rice tasted soo bland. I was disappointed that my salad only had two black olives in it, and they chinced me with a small amount of feta. The amount of tzaziki sauce this meal came with was disappointing. A blow to the whole meal. It wasn't made fresh/in-house, and was more of a pre-packaged dipping sauce. Definitely not enough.   So in conclusion, I was very disappointed with the lack of potato gravy-sauce and lack of good restaurant made tzaziki sauce. I want more olives!  I don't think paying $15/+tax for this was worth it. You might as well spend your dough and go to an authentic Greek restaurant, rather then these chains. Although to be fair, the Mr.Greek Express location closer to my neighbourhood (855 Milner Ave) is waay better."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places in Aurora for a quick bite. Amazingly delicious food. Usually pretty quick--not as fast as McDonalds, but pretty good.  We frequently get a bunch of takeout here for the whole family, on nights when we're too busy to cook. Even the bigger orders are ready pretty quickly.  Takeout stays HOT! They pack it very well. I'm a big fan of the chicken souvlaki pita, and the foil wrap they use keeps it very warm. Everything holds up very well in the 15 minutes it takes for me to drive home, park in the garage, unpack everything and plate it for the family, and get eating--indistinguishable from having it fresh at the restaurant. They also do eat-in decently well but we're normally doing takeout.  Cheap prices for the quantity and quality of food, and good service. Long hours and frequently open holidays! Really saved my bacon on a couple of holidays, actually, bless them."}
{"text":"We just enjoyed a quick lunch here. I had a very fresh village salad, with large freshly cut veggies and home style dressing, loaded with olives and fetA, and a very generous portion for a 'side salad' fresh and juicy chicken skewers on the side, with my fave; tzaziki! my hubby had the gyro sandwich which was loaded with meat and fresh toppings, and the fries were very crispy and delicious, you can tell they used fresh oil to fry them inn!  We really enjoyed our lunch, if we will be in this area again, we will definitely return to ear here again!"}
{"text":"Well I'm sure most people are familiar with a \"Mr. Greek/express\" by now but I'm going to write this for those who aren't. The Mr.Greek express a fast food chain serving Greek food like all the traditional \"meat on a stick\"/shish kebabs whatever you call it; Souvlaki pork or chicken is what it's known as in Greek town. I've had many meals here eat in and takeout. Can't go wrong its fairly inexpensive and it's well supposed to be quick but they're not -ok they do need to cook the meat. The chicken and pork is always tender.  You have your choice of full dinners \"classic or original\" that come with 1 or 2 choices of sides: rice, potatoes,sautéed vegetables -all meals come with a small Greek salad.  You can go cheap & order a pita sandwhich only.  I've had the fried calamari dinner which is approx. $16.00 comes with 2 sides & salad & pita bread! Huge & filling ;my fav They also now have \"chicken\" gyros which should be good for those who don't eat lamb or beef.  If you're eating in, you basically order at the front cash-cafeteria style then go pick your own seating as they bring you the food order(not bad you still get service) and you don't have to tip but I recommend a small one as they clear your plates too. But it's up to you-that's why it's an \"express Overall inexpensive good food"}
{"text":"What a dump.  Poor service, confusing menu, dirty dining room.  Never again.  I don't understand why someone would spend the money to get into the restaurant business and not do better than this.   Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Service was very pleasant. We ordered and I really botched up. My brain's gone from camp. Anyhoo, the server was super friendly about me messing up my order multiple times. She brought our food to our table. She was also there to pick up our empty plates after. Also, service with a smile.  The booths are cushy, but cracked with age.  I had the pork souvlaki in pita with side salad. Nothing particularly special about the salad. Feta was quite salty. Pork souvlaki was nice and juicy. Love that they grill the pita. It makes it taste infinitely better."}
{"text":"Lovely food and portion size! The staff are super friendly. The place is very clean. Their rice were tasty and pluffy,  potato was so good and it melts in your mouth. The chicken souvlaki and lamb souvalaki is my favourite. The grilled and fried Calamari was stellar.  I came with my family and my former colleagues. This  classic chicken souvlaki dinner comes with a side salad plus 2 sides , pita bread and tzatziki very filling. Definitely one of the best greek restaurant in the GTA."}
{"text":"The food is good but the wait times can be excessive. I just call in my order on my way home from work."}
{"text":"Bae and I wandered in here despite getting the \"no\" feeling and ignoring it. The place itself was super messy, with tons of random food pieces on the floor and all over the tables. Bae decided he didn't really want to eat anything while we were waiting in line.  I ended up ordering a falafel pita, small Greek salad with dressing on the side, and an order of Greek fries. Falafel pita was fine and so was the salad. Veggies weren't overly fresh. Fries were pretty sad - topped with feta but drenched in a super oily tomato type sauce.  For sure would not return again."}
{"text":"The prices are in the high range for what you get on the plate. I had an Gyros on a Pita and it had roughly 5 shavings of meat. WTF. It was tiny.  They also served the gyros on a whole wheat pita with no option for white pitas.  I have been here 3-5 times and everytime I regret it. No more!"}
{"text":"Just went in to get a double skewer of chicken and a salad.....can someone tell me it cost $15.45? That's an outrageous price for chicken and salad. Even though it was a large, it's still disconcerting at these prices. Unlikely I'll go back again."}
{"text":"I wasn't even going to waste my time writing a review about this place, but it annoyed me at how their food & quality has changed so much. I've been a fan since the early 90's just a few years after they opened their first location on the Danforth! The quality has gone down, portions have shrunk and the price has gone up in such a short period of time. I had lunch today at this location. First time in almost 2 years. I was REALLY in the mood for Greek food. Markham has a large Greek community, but sadly very few Greek Restaurants. It was my only option today, otherwise, I would've gone to Greek town.   We ordered chicken gyros dinner. They told us they slice the chicken in the morning and wait for an order then they warm it up. Ewww really? What happened to slicing it fresh per order?? My pork souvlaki dinner was so salty i had to drown out the taste with large amounts of tzatziki sauce. I ordered an extra skewer of souvlaki for my 5 year old and they served it with 2 slices of baguette? Yet on the menu it's listed as coming with pita. When did Greek restaurants start serving French sticks with their food?  I would now put them on the same level as food court Greek food. No thank you Mr. Greek, your glory days are long behind you."}
{"text":"Classic pork soulvalki and chicken soulvalki dinners were on the bland side. Lettuce for the salad had a plastic bag taste. Garlic bun wasn't cooked long enough after coming out of refrigerator so was soggy. Prefer Souvlaki Hut."}
{"text":"Not bad but a far cry from their status of years past. Mr. Greek was THE name in Greek food with the chain dominating the GTA. They seem quite hidden now with the \"Express\" locations seemingly more common. The food is pretty good but seems to have lost a certain authenticity. It's now somewhat more ordinary. With this location being within 10 minutes of Zet's, I would choose the latter every time."}
{"text":"I have ordered on more than one occasion from this restaurant (mostly due to a lack of other locations). With each order they have called me to let me know that there has been a problem. Either they ran out of dinner sized chicken, ran out of garlic bread, forgot my order, there was always something! When the food arrived the chicken usually tasted rubbery. Today I submitted my order and they called to say I was outside of their delivery boundaries. I told the person on the phone that I had ordered from them numerous times and before and I got, \"mmm....no, you haven't!\" WHY WOULD I LIE ABOUT THAT! Speaking to the manager didn't help, he was equally useless so I cancelled my order. Luckily now skip the dishes has some Greek options!"}
{"text":"This is by no means the type of Greek restaurant where you sit down, order your food and get some quality special greek food. What you do get is your typical greek food that most people know (gyro's, souvlaki's etc.) You pretty much go up to the front, order your food, wait for your food, collect your food on a tray and go sit down at one of their tables. Don't expect a large menu or a fish of the day. Or even the grilled calamari that they have at the regular Mr. Greeks. What you do get is fast greek food to satisfy any greek food cravings that you may have.   Oh. and I personally do not like the Mr. Greek Potatoes. For some reason, they just taste horrible every time I get them. I prefer to get the mixed vegetables which comes with zuchinni, eggplant, onions and carrots along with the Mr. Greek rice as my sides."}
{"text":"Not exactly sure what is express about this place.  They always seem to take a while which is why I usually don't go for lunch here.  I don't mind waiting for food if it tastes spectacular.  This does not taste spectacular.    The plus is that it is a big enough place to host team lunches and the decor actually looks nice.  I've been here a few times and usually the tables are clean.    You can order ahead to help save some time.  The food doesn't have the beautiful greek flavours you can find on the Danforth.  It's like the Greek McDonalds.  It will do in a pinch.  Chicken souvlaki is ok, the salad is a bit (ok a lot) sad looking."}
{"text":"I do agree that the meals are fairly expensive for what you get, But I have to say the food is very tasty. The best bang for your buck is the pita's and the burgers."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE service! I'm flabbergasted by how unpleasent my experience was. I came into Mr.Greek at 9:15, believing the establishment closed at 10. After I had finished ordering from the counter with my boyfriend, I was notified that the dining room was closed and we'd have to bring our food home. It was strange. There were a few people in the dining room and one of the staff was sweeping the middle of the floor; rushing them out. I decided to just wait for my food because I didn't want to cancel my order.... pretty inconvenient for us that the lady at the counter didn't tell us until AFTER my boyfriend and I ordered. There wasn't anything to indicate they closed at 9:15..  so weird. Anyways, I graciously brought my Mr. Greek home, even being a little annoyed. I ordered a Chicken Gyro... and instead, the lady plopped my chicken on the Greek fries I ordered.... and just gave me a pita... with NOTHING on it! Just chicken thrown on top of my fries for me to assemble myself. HOW lazy can you be? Here is the receipt and the mess that I was served!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a place to nosh-up before spending a day walking around the Heartland Town Centre outlet googleplex, Mr. Greek Express isn't too bad of a choice. It's that or Tucker's Marketplace.  All your favorites served up quick (well quicker than the sit down version) and no threat of waiter combustion due to a poorly executed opa! I had the gyros and CUTE! Chinese girl had the chicken souvlaki in a pita. You can get fries or greek salad (salad is extra). The fries are decent. The greek salad is nothing to write home about. The gyros I found lacking any zing. The CUTE! Chinese girl gave me half her souvlaki and that tasted a bit better. All 'n' all the pita wrap combos kind of fail but I've had the full dinner items previously and they're more in keeping with the Danforth experience.  The food does take some prep time and if its busy, express becomes something of a misnomer."}
{"text":"The souvlaki is fine and gyros are decent but everything else pretty much sucks, especially the side dishes. Undercooked potatoes, bland rice smothered in tomato sauce, salad dressing from a bag and loaded with preservatives, and frozen French fries..  Stick to a sandwich on a pita and avoid everything else , especially the sides !"}
{"text":"I had grilled squid with vegetables and mr.greek potatoes on the side, the food is good and tasty, and I also like their extensive selection of fountain drinks. Your have to order and pick up your own food and drink, no waiter services, like other fast food restaurants."}
{"text":"TAKE OUT: This is one of my favourite places to eat for a healthier option but I only do take out. During lunch time they are super busy but ordering online and coming in to pick up the food it's just an easier option. Their online menu has pictures for each dish so that you can choose the ones you like. They do have a few vegetarian options but it really depends on how much you really like Greek food. When you go in to pick up your food they are ready right away and cash you out as soon as possible. everything is packed for you and a huge paper bag so you just pay and go.  FOOD: I got the veggie plate which allows you to pick your own two sides from a variety of choices such as: rice, potatoes, roasted vegetables, salad, fries and many more. I chose the roasted vegetables which includes Zucchini, peppers, and onions, and rice. I also added extra red sauce on top of my rice. The roasted vegetables were a little too early for me but they tasted mediocre but the race tasted really good. The Quantity that you get both the sides is more than enough!! Along with this you also get a choice of bread or pita and a salad of your choice. This comes with the dressing and tzatziki sauce. The salad tasted good and the pita is so soft and fluffy!!   PRICE: This cost $12 which is alright pricing but for a veggie plate it could be cheaper as the meat Ones are just around the same price which makes no sense... you were to order individual items it would mean pricey so it would be better to get a meal.   STAFF: Everyone is nice and friendly. Customer Service was great!"}
{"text":"We like coming here but WHY ARE YOU CLOSED TODAY??? On Sunday, April 17, you lost 3 sets of customers while we were standing outside figuring what to eat. It's a shame..."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service. Was greeted by very friendly staff who were very accommodating. I decided to order the moussaka subject in hindsight was a bad choice for \"express\" service. I was served a hockey puck moussaka with a base as hard as a rock...it seemed burnt or over cooked. The filing was dry and not creamy as i expected from Mr. Greek. Disappointed with the meal but the service is the only thing that warrants the 2 stars. I might suggest ordering meat platters which may be more pleasing."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, reasonable prices, and delicious Greek food that is prepared right in front of you. This place is a frequent stop for my family and I."}
{"text":"I always drive by here and since I've had greek food before and loved it, I thought why not try here.  Service was pretty slow for takeout and for the price, the food is not worth it. A little bland, I don't know if it is only this location or if other locations might be better.  My coworkers also agreed that for the price and what you get, it isn't worth it."}
{"text":"the food is always good here. it tastes great, fresh, and the portions are reasonable for the price. however, the service at this particular location continues to disappoint me when it comes to delivery and online ordering. it always takes ages for orders to come, even if it's a small amount. but worse than that is that even though i've only ordered a few times now, among those instances was a time they went to a completely different address ( despite me having a confirmation email showing my correct address ) and then just tonight, my order failed to even arrive. when i called wondering what happened, they claimed to have not received my order, even though yet again, i have an email from confirming my order. so while the food is definitely good, i'm pretty turned off from these experiences and am reluctant to order from them in the future."}
{"text":"I eat here every week at least once -mostly for lunch. Food is extremely fresh and always fast - staff is very friendly. I highly recommend it. My go to lunch is the chicken greek salad."}
{"text":"I wish I couldn't even give this place one star. I ordered takeout from them for a group of 6 people. When the food arrived it was cold and bland. The potatoes were as hard as a rock. When I called them to notify them, they were aware that the potatoes were hard and mentioned that they had switched potatoes and that's all they had. Knowing this they still decided to sell this product, did not refund me but issued a credit. Months later I decided to claim my credit, but of course they could not locate this credit and did not reimburse me. Stay away from this restaurant  they are a bunch of scammers!!!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Greek food, but this particular location left me a cold Desire to comeback. Ordered the Chicken sovoulaki dinner, but it was cold, from the potatoes to the rice and the chicken was not properly cooked at all!!! Very Disappointed"}
{"text":"Best mr. Greek we have been to. Usually order the classic chicken souvlaki $14.95.  Fresh of the grill chicken with potatoes and rice. To start if they bring you a fresh salad.  When you order you food they'll tell you that you might have to wait 10 minutes or however long it takes.  Not a problem you sit down they bring you the salad and your food when it's ready.  Bottomless soft drinks. The staff is super friendly!!!!!"}
{"text":"I visited this place after a very long time (after this review you will know why). Upon entering, they were surprisingly busy for the time and day I went. The time it took from ordering to actually getting my food was about 20 mins, a little odd for an \"express\" restaurant.   Hoping the time it took for the food to be made meant it would be good was soon realized to be a pipe dream. The chicken was very dry and burnt; that didn't bother me. The fact that the food was ABSOLUTELY TASTELESS outraged me. I've had baby food that tasted better. Looking at the potatoes and rice, I hoped for the best as Greek places usually have very tasty potatoes and rice. Once again I was being hopeful and building castles in the sky hoping they would be any good.   I really wouldn't recommend this place to anyone unless you like getting ripped off (I paid $15).   If you want Greek food, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Chicken slouvaki original dinner $12.25 - you get two slouvaki skewers with salad and pita and one side. I thought the meal comes with rice so I asked for potatoes as my side but turns out the rice is considered one of the side options.   The food was good overall. Pita was soft and fresh. Chicken was juicy and tender. Good amount of tzaziki sauce.  Plenty of seating inside. There were also many people staffed when I arrived at around 7:00pm so service was quite fast."}
{"text":"Boy has this chain ever gone downhill. Calamari was greasy. Chicken stick was minuscule.  Salad was ok though. $33 for this. Take your meal choice somewhere else."}
{"text":"Wouldn't visit here again. Slow and indifferent service, super dry chicken in the pita sandwich and dirty, unkept eating area."}
{"text":"Is this what you call Greek food?  FOOD I had a gyros with fries. My Gyros meat looked like shaved sausages when it was suppose to be pork. I honestly don't know what it was.  They put so little sauce in it and tons of onions.  My fries were so bland and tasteless.  I don't think you could have salvaged them even if you recooked them in the most unhealthy oil imaginable topped with ketchup and salt.  RESTAURANT waiting for the food, they had these vents blowing hot air right at our heads. It was the most uncomfortable wait ever.  On top of that, it took forever for them to prepare the food. It really doesn't take that long to put some meat in a pita and slather on a teaspoon of sauce."}
{"text":"I was driving hungrily upon when I happened on this Mr.Greek. Since I have new dietary requirements/restrictions I thought this place could fit my bill....I was right.   I ordered the Greek Salad (no cheese) & the Gyro (I love Gyro). The managers ALVIN & JERAMY heard me complaining that there is no discount for NOT getting cheese. So basically I was paying for something I wasn't getting. He made a smart business decision & offered me a larger salad with added Tomato/Cucumber & a little extra salad dressing. This suited my needs just right & they were very polite about it. The staff that served the food was polite, efficient & smiling & were kind enough to offer cold water to go with my meal. In today's age with competition as tough as it is....ring, ring....well done!"}
{"text":"More like 3.5*. Lunch spot for me on Friday. Really busy spot but service was slow. They should have geared up for the rush. Had the Chicken Souvlaki meal which was good & good value as well. Only $11.00 for the meal. The food was fresh & hot. I'd eat here again."}
{"text":"Fast, fresh, tasty basic Greek food! What's not to like? No it's not big on selection, but what they have is really good! Good pita, fresh salad, falafel was tasty (but on soft side, I like mine crunchier). The chicken meat was very good. Rice was so-so flavor but not dry. Pretty good fries too, thick cut.   We arrived at 9:30pm prior to 10pm closing. Food was prepared fresh and all ingredients were superior quality. The staff was courteous, especially our cashier. She also bagged up our food and we took it back to hotel to eat. The restaurant was clean and inviting. I would definitely eat here again! Thank you Mr. Greek! Opa!"}
{"text":"They have a good family deal with plenty of options and big portions. I wouldn't say that it is the best tasting Greek food but there are not many options around. I honestly prefer Jimmy the Greek at Markville better."}
{"text":"We have been to this place many times.  It's a family own place and the cashier know how I love it no matter how long it's been since the last time I dropped in.    The sits are normal for most restaurants and they keep it clean but some time they get busy and can't get to the table just ask to clean it.    Environment: a bit cold but it's ok bring a light jacket."}
{"text":"I remember coming to this place a few years ago and enjoying it wholeheartedly. Now, the experience is not quite the same. Unfortunately.   The place gives a greasy, unclean kind of feeling. Service is fast, some employees are definitely friendly, but the quality of the food isn't great. I ordered a chicken Souvlaki plate hoping for a good experience. Instead, I received burnt chicken and improperly cooked rice. The only item I managed to finish on my plate, was the salad. I informed an employee of the burnt chicken, and she prepared a fresh chicken skewer for me right away. As much as I appreciated it, I had lost my appetite by that point and decided to take it home instead.   Definitely not a place I'd recommend if you're looking for Greek fast food."}
{"text":"We visited Mr. Greek for lunch today because we were shopping in the area.   I ordered the soup and salad combo. I got the fasolada (navy bean) soup and Caesar salad. The soup was basically like a bowlful of unseasoned beans. Bland is an understatement. It had two slices of very stale baguette on my he side.  The Caesar salad was limp and made with iceberg lettuce instead of romaine. The dressing was quite tasty.   My son had the pork souvlaki with Greek salad and fries. The pork was overcooked and not very well seasoned. The salad needed seasoning. The fries were good.   The service at the counter was friendly and efficient. The gentleman who delivered our food was also friendly and food came out quickly.   The restaurant seemed clean. Prices are high for what we got."}
{"text":"Not sure what happened to this place, the food once fresh and tasty is now table scraps and flavorless. The once friendly servers have been replaced with rude cashiers and food prep staff who have no idea what they're doing.   How does a Greek salad taste like mold, and have nothing but all the end pieces one would normally throw in the garbage???  I had to argue with staff to get the dressing mixed into my salad instead of having it on the side!!  I will never again waste $$ or time on this run down location!!"}
{"text":"I'm a regular at this mr greek as its close to my house. Typical we place family size orders for takeout.  It's pretty typical Greek food , nothing special.  Today wasn't their best day. Grabbed a large chicken salad for myself at lunch time around 3:30pm.  The salad was a bit brown with no tzasiki sauce and the portion was smaller than normal.  It was dead in there so I'm not sure what exactly went wrong.  Cost is about $13 for just a salad which seems pretty pricey considering there was barely any chicken.   I'll probably give it another try at some point in the future but not at lunch time.   Food 3/5  Price 3/5  Overall 3/5.   Wouldn't really recommend this place unless you're looking for a quick bite"}
{"text":"We went in for lunch yesterday just before noon. The lady at the counter taking our order was nice but didn't smile once and seemed stressed out. The place was pretty empty when we arrived, but quite a line-up developed after we sat down. It took more than 15 minutes for us to get our food; not very 'express' if you ask me. The server came to our table twice and asked us our order number before she actually served us our food.  We had a chicken Greek wrap ($6.25) and a gyro pita ($5.95) and I have to say that the food was very tasty and the place was clean. I would probably go again because it is close to where I work and the food quality is worth it."}
{"text":"One of the wrost holy s**t words cant explain how bad it is my grilled chicken was small and dryed as hell didnt even finish my dinner. My gf pork just tasted burnt just overall horrible never coming back  I went to pizza nova next store and got pizza"}
{"text":"This place is filthy!!!, oh and don't ask them to make changes for added cost, they want you to upgrade and pay. Gave it one star because 0 is not an option, please clean up the drips and moldy cheese from the serving counters."}
{"text":"Yesrerday i bought a take out during my work lunch time, this greek restaurent is similer quality to greek food in food court . Taste so dull. They dont have lunch price offer for souvlaki chicken with rice . I got no choice to order dinner price which is 14 dollars for my lunch. Also charge customer for extra sause."}
{"text":"Bland food. Expensive. Staff have poor interpersonal skills making ordering food feel like pulling teeth."}
{"text":"the place seems very confused... it has a fish aquarium and partly decorated like its someones house...   you pretty much get your typical mall fast food greek food here... but significantly more expensive.  my souvalaki was burnt almost black.. parts were inedible. (edible if i wanted cancer from the carcinogens) look at the picture..   then.. while eating the chicken.. i nearly choked when i found out part of the chicken had a skewer which broke off and still in the middle of the piece of chicken.  i will say the 100 drink selection coca cola machine might be their only saving grace.  (FUZE green tea is really smooth and delicious)  Thats about it.."}
{"text":"I was in Heartland and quickly wanted to get some lunch and ordered some take out. Service was lightning fast, I mean I paid and before the debit machine said approved my food was ready. Witch made me doubt the freshness of the food and think that it has been lying on their pans just being kept warm!? Anyhow it tasted ok, wasn't the best I ate but also not the worst. If I would be in the area next time and feel like Greek I would come back."}
{"text":"This Mr. Greek continues to be one of the worst locations out of all. My fiancé bought two souvlakis  last night...when we opened them they were flimsy and only has the  tzatziki, a lot of onion, two pieces of tomato and our meat (which was very rubbery btw). I've head better souvlakis before that were way lower in price and worth every penny. The service was also horrible. Not by the friendly cashier, but by the cook. You can tell he was being stingy and didn't care to give us a proper souvlaki. That location does cater to a lot of businesses around there but if you have the option to go elsewhere, please do!"}
{"text":"Went there last night. Wasn't thrilled with the place. When ordering , I asked what was in one of the soups and the girl couldn't answer. She didn't know . Well I ended up ordering lentil soup which was just ok. I would never order that again Then I ordered classic gyro . The serving size was huge. But it was just ok. I will not order it again. Was too thrilled by it. I suggest if u go there , stick to a basic sandwich . I wasted my $20 last night. But hey, one learns from experience."}
