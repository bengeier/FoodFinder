{"text":"I came here during the week for a late lunch and had the poutine. It was excellent. The gravy on the poutine wasn't the typical brown gravy, but a creamy chicken gravy. The cheese curds were tender and very \"melty\". But the service was the best part. My waiter was incredibly friendly, nice and just overall happy. He was very attentive without being at the table every two minutes. Best service I've had."}
{"text":"Was here for dinner with a girlfriend this week. I had been before for drinks but had not eaten. I'm glad we went!

Service was excellent, our waiter was very informed regarding the menu - my friend is gluten-free and he was accommodating, suggesting some substitutions on various dishes that can be made by the kitchen. We each had a glass of wine, 9oz and an entree. 

I was torn between the chicken pot pie and the piri piri chicken and I'm so glad I went with the latter! I am always very impressed when restaurants are able to cook chicken breasts so juicy while ensuring the skin is crisp. The piri piri sauce had just enough heat and the wheatberry salad on the side was excellent - it was filled with roasted carrot and eggplant (I think) and as a non-eggplant fan that was one of my favourite parts of the dish! 

My friend had the braised lamb dish and the aroma was enough to make me want it next time I go to Bannock. It was an Indian inspired dish, served usually with garlic roti but for her GF substitution she had taro root chips - yum! 

Prices were very reasonable and it wasn't the usually small portions you see at O&B restaurants. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I love anything and everything Canadiana. I'm known in my friend group as loving all things kitschy Canadian--maple leaf napkins, mountie paintings, birch bark candle holders, Aboriginal carvings, etc.--but in a really ultra modern setting. Industrial chic with a Canadian twist. Well along comes Bannock! What a perfect match for little ol' me! I have to tell you I eagerly awaited this restaurant. I saw that Timothy's closed down and that the space was being vacated. When I heard that the Bay--and that brilliant Bonnie Brooks--had partnered up with Oliver and Bonacini (whose other great restaurants Auberge du Pommier, and Canoe have always been fan favorites) I was like ok, gurrrrl, we have a winner and I was not not not disappointed! My boyfriend and I have been twice in three weeks, both times for lunch. I love the menu, I think its really well 'curated.' There is a nice selection with a variety of options if you're not hellbent on bannock or some of the more irregular foodie options. I loved the poutine pizza: it's a must try. While my hips were groaning at the sight of such a gluttonous concoction, I was really impressed in the end. As a Montrealer I thought 'Toronto cannot do poutine,' but I was wrong. The cheese curds were fresh, the gravy was flavourful, and the placement of poutine on pizza dough was definitely something creatively adventurous. I lovedddddd it. Fab. On my second visit I had the chicken pot pie which was rich, scrumptious, and a sensical addition to the menu of a restaurant that prides itself on 'Canadian comfort food.' Not to mention the mashed potatoes were like really really really good; I loved the little gravy pool they created. The waitstaff on both occasions (the one waitress who was a Kiwi/New Zealander was really cute and helpful) and our other waiter was Shawn, he was pleasant and more than attentive with water, bringing the bill, clearing, etc. They have a small-ish wine selection but all the standards are there; the Oliver and Bonancini house wine collection is also available including their good VQA-certified 'Canoe' riesling, a nice fruity (ha!) wine for lunch. 

All in all a wonderful respite from shopping at the increasingly more glamourous Bay flagship store and/or the clusterfuck that is the Eaton Centre. The dining space is not overly large but big enough that we did not have to wait for a table. The 'take-out' area has maybe 7-8 tables where you can snack on baked goods and their coffee. I noticed that a small coffee from the take-out bar was $1.70 and a large was $2, pretty good prices. Also: if you are a HBC Rewards collector you can earn points for your meal (I'm not sure if it is the standard 50 points for every dollar you spend but they 'credited' me for it at the end of my meal). They do not, however, accept the HBC/The Bay credit card if you were interested (I'm such an ol' lady that way and I still use my Bay card to collect those points, don't judge!). Also one thing that is hella silly is that there is no direct connection to this restaurant from the Bay department store!!! You have to walk outside the store and along Queen Street or up Bay Street and then across to the main entrance. The first time my boyfriend and I went there we were sure that there would be a direct connection and we ended up going through the service entrance. Classy."}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday morning to try their brunch menu for birthday celebration. At the entrance, a large glass showcase of readily made gourmet sandwiches, pastries and salads were prepared for the on-the-run crew. Looked healthy! Mouth watering!  Service was great - responsive, tentative, and warm.

Free Run Turkey Burger ($16) was prepared with condiments of tempura onion, avocado and a dill pickle mayo sauce. It came with a few vegetable chips on the side.  The chips were thickly cut and quite hard, requires strong teeth to tear it apart.  However, it was not oily at all and seasoned with adequate amount of salt.  I quite liked it for a different texture and has a sweet taste to it, while absorbing the fiber and nutrients.  No surprise from the burger.  The turkey patty was tasty and juicy, while the sauce was not very distinct.  It was quite a generic burger, despite having the jazzy ingredients.

Roast Duck Poutine Pizza ($16) was made curds, fries, duck, and accompanied by the recommended nasty sauce on the side.  The nasty sauce was an attractive sour and very spicy sauce.  The first sample of the sauce was bearable, but the more you try it, the more if feels like your tongue had gone on fire.  The pizza was a successful combination of two comfort foods.  With a thin crust and a lot of toppings, the pizza was baked just about right to be crunchy and crispy.  The juices all retained to make the pizza extremely flavourful and fun to eat.  Not too complicated or overwhelmed by the burst of toppings~

Huge potion sizes, we could barely finish it.  For an early Sunday brunch, I enjoyed the lightness of the meal, and little oil.  The environment was just great and relaxing, with quite a bit of privacy to feel comfortable."}
{"text":"Loved this place!

I was skeptical at first because I'm not a big Canadian cuisine foodie, but the food is really great.  Their menu offers a great variety of salads, burgers and standard comfort food.  It is an O&B establishment and their reputation has held up with this place.

The restaurant is nicely decorated and it offers a comfortable atmosphere.  

Prices are reasonable.  And the staff is friendly and helpful with menu selections.

Reserved a table via Yelp which worked out great!"}
{"text":"Walked in Saturday night at 7 and got a table for 4 immediately.

Service - attentive, family-friendly.

Atmosphere - especially as the evening went on there were tables of smart-casual dressed people out for a nice dinner so we tried to be not too noticeable in our windblown wrinkly casual family group. We felt welcome though. The finishings were very natural and plain, I liked the different woods and materials that were contemporary but warm.

Food - delicious, pork shoulder on spaetzle with warm apple, salad with various house-made pickles - yum and dressed just right, salt cod doughnuts on fresh cucumber pickles with slivers of preserved lemons, brisket burger with taro root chips. The server and kitchen were happy to bring a bowl of buttered fettuccine. The bread bowl with red pepper dip wasn't really worth it. The Canadian wine was okay. The s'more pie was roasted marshmallows on a cheese cake with a graham crust, not too big, not too sweet, just right.

Offers take-out from 3 - 9 too. The grab and go area has a nice selection of cafe items and sweets.

I would return: just the right mix of comfort and contemporary that satisfies without being too heavy."}
{"text":"Went for summerlicious - really great value! I had the panzanella, donair pizza, and frozen yogurt parfait. Service was ok but they actually messed up my dessert order (I just didn't say anything). Overall would recommend for summerlicious!"}
{"text":"I LOVE most of the O&B chain restaurants! So, naturally, I was super excited to try out their latest addition... Bannock. Whoopee! The establishment is part caf√© and part restaurant... so basically, they serve high end food at reasonable prices. I've eaten at this restaurant 2 times already and both experiences were very much enjoyable. Tasty chicken pot pie, flavourful duck poutine and the juicy turkey burger were really well done - meals were nothing short of delicious. Atmosphere is very nice and cozy..,mmmm. I will definitely go back for another meal at Bannock."}
{"text":"Went for the duck poutine pizza. Definitely a dish to be shared among friends. We devoured our slices, but found ourselves fairly full. The duck was somewhat sparse with the overwhelming fries and cheese curds. Overall, a unique dish that's worth trying.

The rest of the menu seemed fairly standard, except for the bannock bread. A cross between a pita and a naan, tasty.

The night was topped off by their S'more dessert, which was just delicious. 

Oh and the service was excellent!"}
{"text":"I have been to Bannock three times now.  Food is consistently good!  The poutine with chicken gravy is awesome for people like me who don't like the taste of red meat or beef gravy.  Loved the kale salad with lemon dressing and the northern woods mushrooms side dish. Every visit has been a delicious and positive experience and we will definitely go back."}
{"text":"charming restaurant, the front is like a cafeteria where you grab and go.  The decor is very rustic, cottage look but with an modern flair.  The menu was at first confusing cuz is not the regular menu with same items that most downtown restaurants have.
They bring Canada to the table, with items from different regions.
Bannock bannock - house salmon sandwich, delicious, 
Muchrooms & eggplant - veggie bannock also another hit
I didnt have the turkey sandwich,  but my friend said that  wont have it again, she wasnt crazy about it, it was dry....  
Overal, we liked it"}
{"text":"Quick service & friendly staff. 

(My previous review was clarified, I was mistaken)"}
{"text":"Got to try the duck fat potatoes, delicious. The service was excellent. Our waiter asked us if we needed to be anywhere afterwards and since we did he brought out our food fast and quick. He also was there if we wanted anything more. Classy casual atmosphere. Very lively and very busy."}
{"text":"Our group of 5 had dinner here. Very busy place. Our waiter was all business and calculated in approach. In fact, he messed up one of the orders, bringing a smoked salmon wrap to someone who had requested a vegetarian wrap. It was a bit annoying to have everyone eating while one person waited for their order to be corrected. Our waiter did redeem himself in the end, apologizing, and bringing out a free dessert board and adjusting the bill accordingly. Everyone makes mistakes sometimes, right?

The food was very good. I had the chicken piccata, which was perfect; although I've never had piccata with parmesan cheese on it. The asparagus was excellent and perfectly cooked. The whole table had poutine also which was a hit. Chicken pot pie was superb.

As mentioned, we were given a dessert board which meant we were able to taste all of the desserts on the menu. The panna cotta was unanimously awful. The smores cake was divine!! The butter tart was also very good but a tad too runny for my taste.
 
On an end note, I'm not sure why they brand Bannock as 'Canadian comfort food'. I really don't think the menu reflects this 100%."}
{"text":"While I don't think anyone really truly knows what \"Canadian comfort\" food is, Bannock is probably as close as it gets.  It's at a great location right by the Eaton Centre so it gives shoppers an option other than fast food and Mr. Greenjeans (is it still there...?).  

Anyway, I had their artisan bread that came with hummus which is a better alternative than butter.  It was good but would pass on it the next time since it wasn't anything too special.  I had the roast duck poutine pizza. Whoa.  It's definitely for sharing as it is really too much for one person to handle.  It gets too savoury and there's too much gravy (yes, there could be \"too much\" gravy) to really enjoy the duck that's on it.  I love duck so while there's a lot on it, the amount of cheese and gravy takes over so you can't taste much of it and it made the pizza soggy.  It would have been better with about a quarter less gravy. 

The warm s'mores pie was delicious but at $8 just a tad over priced. 

Service was good and I would come back to try the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Mac n Cheese, Chicken Pot Pie and Pork Shoulder were really good! The wait is a bit long but it was worth it. The servers were all very friendly and made excellent recommendations. Great ambiance. Would definitely go again!!"}
{"text":"Another great O&B restaurant.

Summerlicious (lunch menu):
Broccoli and Bacon Turnover - A nice balance of all its elements and very refreshing.

Roasted Haddock - Not a fan of haddock but the gf enjoyed it. The kale, spinach, quinoa, and pear pairings were a good combination and tasted very good. It could've done without the jalapeno relish though.

O&B Meringue and Raspberry Mess - A very light and refreshing dessert, leaves you wanting more.

Regular (lunch menu):
BLT Bannock - I really enjoyed this sandwich, the bacon plus avocado and tomato to the bun ratio was spot on. All the flavours really complimented each other with every bite.

Warm S'mores Pie - This dessert is too warm for my liking so I ordered a single scoop of ice cream on the side (vanilla bean @ $3.50). The dessert was really good, a little heavier, but enjoyable. The marshmallows were torched to perfection, creating a nice oozing layer over the chocolate and graham crackers."}
{"text":"Terrible experience overall.

Service was so poorly coordinated it ruined our entire dinner, though the staff attempted to be polite. We were seated after being asked to wait for a while (even though half the tables were not taken).

I ordered coffee with me dessert, but they didn't serve it until I had finished my dessert (15 minutes after I ordered it). I simply asked them to take the coffee back.

Seating for two can be very tight and you hear the entire conversation of the table next to us.

Food is not bad, definitely overpriced."}
{"text":"Came for lunch.  Our server was nice and prompt.  She recommended the chicken pot pie (apparently it got written up in a magazine and had very good reviews).   Personally, I thought it was just ok - maybe my expectations were too high?   The poutine was good though."}
{"text":"I visited Bannock again with a few other friends on a Wednesday night. It was the last week of school/work just before the holidays, so it was good that we made a reservation because it was pretty packed.

This time, I ordered the arcadian court chicken pot pie as it appears to be another one of Yelpers' favourite dishes at this O&B restaurant. I was quite anxious because I wanted something warm and hearty that night since I wasn't feeling all too well. 

As it arrived on my table, I felt the presentation of the chicken pot pie was quite boring compared to their other dishes. There definitely could be some improvements in that area. Besides that, I thought the chicken pot pie was very filling and unfortunately, way too salty for my taste. It was so salty that I just could not take many bites of it. At least the mashed potatoes and gravy were pretty good...

Even though I was quite disappointed with the dish that I chose this time (perhaps it was just that one particular chicken pot pie...or maybe this 'comfort food' concept means food that is too salty for my liking?), I still enjoyed the ambiance, the music and the setting. The staff, again, were very friendly and polite. I also loved their warm s'mores pie last time and I had every intention of ordering it again. However, it was either the way-too-salty chicken pot pie or myself feeling too tired and unwell, I no longer had the appetite. I didn't even take a bite of my friends' order of warm s'mores pie, and I usually have a second stomach for desserts. ;)"}
{"text":"A fun Canadian resto with fun takes on traditional cuisine. 

The seafood items are fantastic, and we loved the S'mores pie and doughnuts! 

Great location too!"}
{"text":"I finally went to Bannock last weekend for lunch and was not disappointed. I had walked by this place so many times and have been wanting to check it out forever. 

The server was extremely friendly and pleasant and he was really helpful in providing recommendations. I ended up ordering the pickerel tacos with cucumber apple salad which came on steamed buns with caviar tartar. 

The steamed buns were much like the buns of chinese BBQ pork buns, they definitely made the tacos outstanding. I would recommend these to anyone who likes fish tacos. The only place I've had better tacos is in Hawaii...

My friend ordered the pulled pork and cheddar macaroni quesadillas which was also really good. 

In addition to the great food, the service was great, and the prices were reasonable.

I definitely plan to go back again soon...."}
{"text":"Came in for the Winterlicious dinner on a Saturday. It was an OK experience.

The restaurant is set in a very convenient location, just steps away from the subway, Eaton Centre and City Hall. It's on the periphery of the central business district, which makes this place an easy choice for professionals or visitors who are seeking for fairly reliable quality of service and food. 

During our visit, it was the 2nd night of Winterlicious, so the restaurant was quite busy. After a short wait in the small waiting area, we were led to our table with menus and water.

I started with the Sprout and Bean salad, followed by the Pork and Beans entree, and finished with a Warm Toffee Pudding. The salad had some nice texture to it- crisp sprouts, crunchy split peas and chewy firm tofu. The nori had a pleasant savoury appeal, while the mayo brought everything together; but the dish as a whole lacked a spicy bite or tang. Pork & Beans is what it is: a slice of pork belly served atop a helping of beans, with a few slices of sausage. It's garnished with some pork rind, and served with a slice of bannock (flat bread). It wasn't a notable entree for me- you got what you ordered with no surprises for the palate, such as in spice or appearance. While it was cool watching the chef prepare the flatbread in-house, the bannock itself was hard and dry. The bread pudding was my favourite of the courses. Sweet, fluffy, soft and moist; served with chantilly. It's good. :-) 

Overall, food was alright; not special given its O&B affiliation. The staff were professional and hard-working, though I definitely *felt* they were in \"Operation: Winterlicious mode\". There was an tense ambience among the staff, telling me it was a particularly busy night. Server etiquette was fair, but looking like he was already thinking about the next turnover. 

In sum: Convenient, but not memorable. Definitely feels like a place for nearby workers looking for a nice bite or drink. (They do have an interesting drink menu- the ginger pear margarita was yummy.)"}
{"text":"'Canadian comfort food' is the tagline for Bannock, and I confess that I was both intrigued and seriously sceptical. Was I about to discover my Canadianness through my gullet? Would I experience colonizer's guilt while doing so?

Since I've eaten at Canteen at the Lightbox and I know the reputation of Oliver and Bonacini, I was certain the food I would be good quality without being excessively highbrow (because I like being able to order without a French dictionary) - but I had no idea what would be on this menu.

The ambiance:
-Bright windows facing Queen near Nathan Phillip Square make the tables nearby grand spots for people-watching. We knew right away where we wanted to be seated. The interior is adorably minimalist, using raw plank textures to conjure the idea of log cabins and rustic charm without resorting to deer heads and table saws (ahem Montana's). The touches are subtle. Birchbark-themed salt and pepper shakers, jarred preserves and chestnuts as decoration, no-nonsense simple white tables, warm wood touches here and there. Nice, and not too pretentious, though a step up from Canteen where the servers are clad in blue plaid. Great for dates or for a nice conversation-starter sort of dinner with pals.

The food:
-First off, I mixed up 'bannock' with 'pemmican'. I was hoping that the Canadian cuisine on offer might hat-tip to some First Nation influence - but it was not to be. A little sad about that, but that's the academic in me. The food here is richly steeped in our history as settlers (colonizers yes, all of the above) and offers creative twists on blue-collar staples from pea soup, chili, mac and cheese, poutine and neat gamey meats.

-We ordered the bread basket appetizer, because if I was going to Bannock I was darn well going to eat some. The server informed me their bakery was upstairs and it tasted like it. The bannock was a cross between roti and a soft taco, dense and delicious. The artisan breads were unbuttered and fresh, served with a simple red pepper hummus.

-We ordered the pineapple sangria because the people next to us did. It looked so fresh and summery we couldn't resist. It was fresh and cold. At first blush it tasted like juice but the wine taste followed, nice and smooth. It was gone too fast, despite the large wineglass serving size.

-I ordered the pork shoulder ($18) recommended by our server, because frankly I found the menu options slightly difficult to visualize. Pickles? Goat cheese feta? Toasted taro sticks? What would that salad look like? No idea. Good thing too because it was fantastic - melt in your mouth tender with amazing carmelized onions and apples on top, resting on a small bed of onion-infused bannock pieces. Slightly sweet with a faint spice. 

The portion was larger than my normal meat intake but you bet I ate all of it and was sad when it was gone. I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys pulled pork sandwiches, or any carnivores who don't want steak. My only wish would be to have some steamed veggies on the side - come on people, some other food group besides meat would have been nice.

-My after-dinner cappuccino was $4 and was not as large as I would have hoped, but it was still delicious and completely necessary to wash down all that tasty pork.

-The girls next to us were having a great time with a steaming plate of poutine bannock pizza, which, despite being a heart-clogger, smelled fantastic. They ordered it because the people next to *them* ordered it, and if we weren't so full we probably would have too. 

The service:
-Our server was cheerful and genuine and very attentive. She had great recommendations on the menu and made us feel quite at home.

Convenience: 
-Extremely close (2 minutes max!) to the Eaton Centre and Queen subway stop, so even the directionally challenged will be able to find it.

Overall, I'd go again sometime, because the menu is interesting, the food and service were both very good, and because any place that serves fancy 'Canadian comfort food' is bound to start a conversation."}
{"text":"Came here on a really nice summer Friday night in June... The place was pretty much empty. Servers are friendly and attentive. I ordered the chicken pot pie and my friend ordered the duck poutine pizza -  both suggestions via yelp. The pie was fine, nothing special! The duck poutine pizza was gigantic - can definitely share this with 2-3 people. The first bite is really unique, but the taste gets pretty boring after you finish a slice. Also, everything tastes better with a few beers, which is where I bump up 2.5 stars to 3. Tldr: food ok, service good."}
{"text":"Every year we tried a traditional turkey dinner in a restaurant during Thanksgiving. This year we chose Bannook. 

On the web site it said turkey dinner was one of the specials but not until we asked for it. The turkey dinner was priced at $25 each. Reasonable I guess. 

It took more than 45 minutes before the dinners were ready. The restaurant was about half full when we arrived so I didn't think they could blame it on the traffics.  

The soups were not included in the dinner special so we added a mushroom soup and a pumpkin soup. They were very good as usual. 

When the turkey dinners came, we noticed that there was no stuffing? The turkey was a bit dry, so we asked for some gravy and to our surprise they charged us $2 extra for that little bit of gravy that we would not have needed if they gave us enough to begin with. Hate when a restaurant nickels and dimes their customers for little things that they were supposed to provide to begin with. 

No pumpkin pie included either, where were the traditions? So we ordered another desert instead.

At the end, we ended up paying way more than other places for a \"traditional\" turkey dinner at Bannook. We left without turkey stuffing and pumpkin pie.

For turkey dinners, we will not come back to Bannook for any foreseeable future. Still like their soups so may just come back for regular dinner."}
{"text":"Bannock's approachable manner certainly makes sense considering it occupies the main floor of the Bay's flagship store on prime real estate on Queen St. at Bay.  This seems super convenient for those long Christmas shopping days where getting home at a decent hour to cook supper means a few shopping-short cuts where your significant other just going to be getting another tie this year. And the demographics in the dining room likely reflects their location, as well.  There's a pretty vast collection of parties throughout the nearly packed room on a Friday night at 8 PM. There are young couples out for date night, suits likely gathering for a bite after work, mixed age families recouping from their shopping spree, and some likely tourists, as well. Totally my dining style, Bannock is casual and inclusive, so dress however you happen to be and no one will bat an eye.
Speaking of casual, back at my last visit to Bannock, I recall how the dining room reminded me of their neighbour's cargo-pant-shopping experience. I remember peering through the dining room wall window into the department store, and being somewhat reminded of the old school Zellers cafeteria my mom used to take us for grilled cheese when we were kids. Thankfully, since then they've apparently rethought that ambiance-killer, and with their windows covered with light blinds, I can appreciate Bannock's rustic Canadiana d√©cor.  The 68 seat dining room features a bright and tidy open kitchen, pine paneled walls, marble tables, sleek wooden chairs, and modern molded-wire light fixtures above the long communal table.  On the other side of the open kitchen, there's a grab and go take out seating area offering pastries, sandwiches, soups, salads, and treats in the daytime, as well as cocktails and lounge nibbles after 4:30 PM.  While we did have the luxury of a corner banquette table, I found the tables in general to be adequately spaced throughout the room. The music and noise level were both at an appropriate level so that I didn't have to struggle to hear my father who was farthest away.  Likewise, the temperature from our back corner booth was tepid and comfortable for us all. Mind you, it might have been a tad cooler near the front of the house, but considering that the revolving door is a good 10 feet from any tables, it's likely that even I would have been fine.
Service was also warm and inviting. The staff played along with my surprise, changing the reservation at the front after we had sat down to a different name and a party for \"two\".  Our server was friendly, young and energetic, yet professional with a casual style. Our cutlery were replenished between courses, water glasses were consistently refilled, and the meal was neither rushed or slow (1  1/2 hours).  She also made sure our birthday girl got a candle in her dessert. I really can't ask for more from a service point of view in a casual dining environment.
Bannock's cocktail menu is comprised of familiar classics treated to a benign transformation with Canadiana ingredients. There's a heck of lot of maple going on, which is A-OK by me- but if you're not a fan, you may want to peruse the wine or beer lists instead.  All with very reasonably prices, Bannock offers 4 different local draught beers in 12 oz ($5.50-6) or 20 oz ($8-8.50) pours, and another 5 or so local and international bottles ($6.5-9).  In continuing with the local theme, Bannock's 21 wine offerings are nearly all Canadian-made, and are each available by the glass ($8-13) or by the bottle ($36-60).  While some of the table went with wine or beer, over the course of the night I sampled both the Maple Sour (Maple Crown Royal, Maple Simple Syrup, Lime, $9) and the Bannock Caesar (Vodka, Canadian Imperial, sherry, Clamato, Salsa, Maple Bacon, $9).  While the bacon on the latter was a delicious little appy, and the pepper rim was completely addictive, I found the drink itself a little watered down. In contrast, the Maple Sour was really my style.  It didn't just taste sweet (though it certainly was a sweeter cocktail by the time I got to the maple sugar candy at the bottom), but rather, it had a deliciously distinct aromatic maple flavour. Definitely a drink I would go for again.
Like the cocktails, on first glance, Bannock's food menu reads of simple, familiar comfort classics, but with a little further interrogation, you see the Canadiana theme portrayed. Poutine pizzas, bannock BLTs, venison chili, dinosaur kale Caesar salad- these items really say it all. Like Canadian cuisine in general, Bannock's menu garners inspiration from a myriad of cultures, presents them in familiar but playful ways, throws in a few distinctively \"Canadian\" ingredients like bacon, game meat, bannock or cheese curds, and yields Toronto-wide appeal...."}
{"text":"Finally someone opened a restaurant in this neighborhood that isn't fast-food.

I had a great dinner at Bannock, chicken pot pie to die for.  I savored every bite!  I also really enjoyed the butter tart, no raisins, which is bonus in my eyes.

Next time I'm trying some bannock though.

Cute resto, great post-shopping meal!"}

{"text":"3.5*

Went to Bannock last night and had a good experience! The food was alright but it was the service that really impressed me. Our server was awesome! Very attentive without being annoying. She noticed that one of my friend's didn't seem to enjoy her meal -- she only ate about 1/3 of it, sparingly so, and then passed it off to her boyfriend to finish off, although he didn't really like it either  --  and was proactive in offering to replace it with something else! 

We ordered: 

1. duck poutine pizza: was BIGGER than expected and was yummy enough! we shared it as an appetizer

2. pickerel taco: so tasty and light! i really enjoyed my meal, although the portion left you wanting more, but maybe that's the point. fortunately we had the duck poutine pizza as a starter.

3. pork shoulder with spaetzle: only ok - the pork was a little dry and slightly bland.

4. bannock bannock: my friend had it and said it was pretty good! house smoked salmon :)

5. venison chilli: sub-ok. i think it was an off night as i had heard good things about this chilli prior to our visit, however, this was the dish that my friend didn't eat. it was replaced by ... 

6. chicken pot pie: thumbs up! my friend said it was really good and they'd eat it again! :) 

Overall it was decided that we would want to come back but maybe just for lunch to try the sandwiches (for curiosity's sake). Again, service was great but the food was only alright. The star of the evening was the chicken pot pie!"}
{"text":"Food is nothing to knock your socks off...I actually found everything either too bland or too seasoned...there wasn't a good balance, and nothing was really memorable.
Service was ok (no one was particularly warm, but they were very professional). I find that the seating is quite cramped."}
{"text":"At Bannock -we had the most amazing waiter in the world!!!! This guy could make mud pies sound delectable- serious talent. Also- food was awesome and I officialy love Bannock (well, the food I mean).

We didn't know what Bannock was, but they were happy to describe it. An eggless flat bread I believe. Great place for vegetarians. They have a few awesome dish options for veggies including the 'gnocchi bolegnese' made with mushrooms. MMMMM!!! My boyfriend had the chicken brick, something with layers, and said it was DELISH! Dessert was yummy too!

Only suggestion would be to dim the lights for dinner- it was a bit too bright! Maybe not the most romantic ambiance- but I can overlook that and say it was an experience I will surely never forget.

I think the waiter's name was Marcel- ask for Marcel!!  And, give him a huge tip!"}
{"text":"I visited this place with my co workers few months back. I had shrimp and fish cake with potatoes and radish. It was a nice meal. Service was a bit slow, but we were not in rush, so it didn't bother us much. Dessert choice is limited. We had warm s'mores pie that looked very nice. It is not my kind of dessert, but everyone else liked it.
They offer decent choice of other meals, so we are planning to go there again ..."}
{"text":"Another O&B restaurant in town ! 
It's half cafeteria style and half sit down. Menu option is kind of simple, so definitely for lunch but maybe a bit dry for dinner.
Another O&B restaurant in town ! 
It's half cafeteria style and half sit down. Menu option is kind of simple, so definitely for lunch but maybe a bit dry for dinner. 

I came here with a group of six, they have one round table in the corner, which is awesome for groups because no one will be isolated unlike spots at the two end of a long table. They don't have too many tables , so may have to wait if u come with big groups. 

Food-wise, we ordered their poutine duck meat\"bannock\" to share (yah it's not listed under starter, but we saw other people ordering and it looks awesome!) it's basically poutine on a piece of flat bread! For main, I got their pasta of the day which is a boglonese fettuccine. Some of my friends got their famous Mac & Cheese, the lamb, the fish cake and the fish cake looks good.  My pasta was pretty nice but not wow.  I used to like O&B a lot back like 7 years ago when there were not so many little chic , chef owned creative restaurants in downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"Stopped in at bannock for lunch before we went to airport . Never been here before and food was excellent!! We had bread, cream or broccoli soup and for mains we had roast duck poutine pizza and chicken pot pie :)"}
{"text":"Great food, and good service. I guarantee there are a few things on the menu that you have never tried. Very original. Drinks are pricey, 8 for beer and charge for every glass of fountain pop. It has a very classy atmosphere it's bright and inviting."}
{"text":"This restaurant is subtle on the exterior, but what it offers is unique and comforting. Bannock focuses on rustic Canadian cuisine and its interiors definitely reflects that. Candlelight (albeit fake) illuminates jars of preserves and cottage-like wood walls; while the tables and seats bring a contemporary flair.

The menu's dishes reflect what Canada has to offer in ingredients and style. On my visits I have had their boiled dinner and pork belly tortiere; both fantastic. Flavours were great in both dishes (especially the boiled dinner) and was not overpowering. The beer selection is not big, and features some rather standard Canadian choices.

I really like this restaurant for its relaxed atmosphere, and its delicious and simple menu. Great for dinner after or before a nice skate at Nathan Phillips Square!"}
{"text":"Lauren's covered most of the high points in her review (the decor, the dessert), but she forgot to mention the service, which was over-the-top friendly.  Like, to the point of almost crossing the creepy line, but then we saw the wait staff were hovering over everyone and not just us, so that made it better.  They were definitely sharing notes on each table--our waiter made a point of mentioning something that we'd only shared with the host.

The food was excellent, though the bannock basket was overkill--I wouldn't recommend it, given the generous portions (I took half my mac and cheese home with me) and the excellent desserts.  Seriously, save room for dessert.  It's so worth it.  Their dessert menu is a bit silly with the Canadiana (really, a baba au rum made with ice wine?), but the s'mores pie tops anything I've had lately.

And I get to enjoy it all over today when I eat the rest of my (incredibly rich) mac and cheese for lunch!"}
{"text":"Real star review: 2.5 out of 5. I wish Yelp allowed for half-stars.

Another O&B restaurant in the city, they seem to be spreading like wildfire (or poison ivy).

I'll go on record to say that I'm not the biggest fan of the O&B empire, i feel that their restaurants have become too chainy, too similar, and a bit uninspired.

Popped into Bannock for an afternoon lunch with the other half & another couple we randomly ran into while shopping. Yes, I spend Sunday afternoon of the Labour Day weekend in a mall. It's embarrassing. Let's move on.

Restaurant at 2pm was about a quarter full, were seated immediately by a helpful hostess. The dining room is nice enough, full of reclaimed wood (apparently salvaged from a sunken dock in Lake Ontario), blond wood chairs, mason jars of preserves lined along one wall (a restaurant design trend that is a bit past it's prime). The configuration & layout of tables in the space is a bit strange (due to the shape of the room), it's not super cozy, tables are packed in pretty close together.

Ordered drinks. The Bannock Ceasar.($9) is quite good, spicy, boozy & garnished with candied maple bacon (my guess is someone in the O&B empire recently dined at Barque). Good wine list and selection of beers, I had the Beau's Lager ($8.5 for a 20oz pint).

Meal: here is what we ordered:

Pickerel Tacos ($11): lightly battered and fried pickerel with caviar mayo with a side of creamy cucumber & green apple salad. Fish was tasty, as was the caviar mayo, the shell of the tacos were really good, very similar to the outside dough of a steamed BBQ pork bun. Salad was very small, maybe 4 pieces of apple and 3 pieces of cucumber in total.

Clearwater Lobster Roll with Root Veg crudite ($15): lobster salad contained hearty pieces of claw $ tail, light (a bit watery) mayo base. Side crudite was good.

Margherita Pizza ($13): meh, a poor rendition of my favorite classic pizza. Large slices of unripe tomatoes on top was a bit disappointing.

Prices for food were reasonable, but with booze the bill was punched up to about $35-$40 per person.

Overall, an okay option in the Eaton Centre area. For the prices, would rather hit The Gabardine, Teronni or Mercatto."}
{"text":"Bannock was the perfect place to go for our first night in Canada. Their tag line of \"Canadian comfort food\" doesn't really tell the whole story: what we ate was more like Canadian haute cuisine. Sure, we started with an order of poutine (which was great), but it all got fancier from there.

The seared B.C. albacore tuna teriyaki was the most surprising dish. Usually seared tuna is done with ahi, while albacore is left for canned tuna salad. The seared albacore was incredible, though: much more flavorful and tender than ahi, with a buttery, melt-in-your-mouth texture. Our server told us that the fishery that catches these albacore waits until the the time of year when the fish are feeding on the proper stuff, which is what elevates them from canning grade to sushi grade.

The lamb rump was also fantastic. I don't think lamb butt is a cut I've had before, but here is was perfectly prepared: a bit charred on the outside, and medium inside, with great lamb flavor. It was served on a bed of grain pilaf, swimming in a dense lamb stock with lots of garlic and rosemary. My mouth is watering just thinking about it.

The restaurant's namesake dish is pretty good too. The house bannock is smoked salmon with cream cheese and cumin, which is basically what would happen if you ordered a lox gyro.

Our server was friendly, and even full of good advice about where to explore north of Toronto.

The other surprise: red wine from Niagara can be pretty good! In Michigan, they can't really make good red wine at all, and I assumed Ontario would be similar. The house wine, Biff's red, was surprisingly good. The local beer, Mill St., was great, too. Go Canada!"}
{"text":"Went today with friend, dining room layout was a bit crowded and they seated us wayyyyyyyyyyyyy at the far corner. The food was good, friend order was the Shrimp cake, I ordered the Salmon. My portion size was a bit small.  Also ordered the S'mores pie which was delicious!"}
{"text":"I went to Bannock a few weeks after it opened and sadly I was disappointed. I have always had wonderful experiences with Oliver and Bonacini restaurants, so this was somewhat surprising. 

A co-worker and I went for a quick business lunch. We arrived around 12:30 and were greeted and seated promptly. Unfortunately things went downhill from there. The server seemed confused and was unable to answer questions we had about the menu. 

Specifically, we asked for descriptions of the signature smoked salmon bannock and the steak lunch entree. The bannock was described as \"like a pizza\" by the server and the steak was described as a NY strip cut in a smaller lunch portion.

Neither of these descriptions were accurate. When the smoked salmon bannock arrived it was a flat bread sandwich. The bannock was similar to a naan bread and was folded around a filling of salmon, cumin cream, pickled onions and a substantial amount of greens and vegetables that were not on the menu, nor were they in the server's description. Also, it was certainly not \"like a pizza\". 

My co-workers steak was....a nightmare. It was not a NY strip cut, but rather a flank steak cut. It was not cut against the grain, therefore it was quite tough and it tasted sour. So not only was the description misleading, the product itself was sub-par. 

When we requested a manager he did nothing to resolve the issues. In fact, he told us that we were mistaken in our complaints. And that we were confusing him as to \"what we wanted out of this\". 

We left, hungry, out $70 and without so much as an apology for our poor experience. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Best butternut squash soup ever! Delicate, not too soupy not too condensed: just great!
Plus the service and price they were right.
I love them at they have free wifi and also a grab n go counter if you don't want to dine in, with a different selection of food and delicious salads!
I do recommend!"}
{"text":"After the last 2 places my date and I ate at, this restaurant was refreshingly cozy with a Canadiana touch. We got excellent service with Warren, and he talked me through what was on the menu, and talked out what was delicious at the restaurant, and let us know that Licious was on, so a couple things were taken off the menu. 

The duck poutine pizza came out piping hot, along with the chicken pot pie. We were very impressed with the level of professionalism, and enthusiasm we had with the O&B hospitality group. We will be back for more food. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Great staff and awesome food; the roasted duck poutine pizza and especially the warm s'more was to die for! Overall great place to have some childhood comfort food in the city."}
{"text":"I went here for winterlicious and had their crab cake.. sooooo good.. ive heard good things about their poutine pizza but the fact that it has duck on it scares me a little.. i also opted for the dessert on their winterlicious menu...not that great.. had a couple of their drinks - got me drunk so good enough for me :)"}
{"text":"Excellent Food, Nice Setting, Great Service!

Hint: the duck poutine is quite the hearty meal and should be shared with at least 2 people. The next time I am in Toronto, this is definitely a place I would return to."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  I ran across it after a morning of shopping at the Eaton's Centre, and decided to try it out as I was curious as to what they meant by \"Canadian Comfort Food\".  When I read the menu, it was hard for me to envision what some of the menu items were based on the description, and I ended up ordering the Corned beef brisket with soft-boiled eggs (they were serving the brunch menu).  My waitress was delightful and told me she felt I had made an excellent choice.  When she brought the plate to my table, she made a point of telling me that the eggs were exactly as they should be.  Oh my god!  It was sooooo delicious, and the eggs *were* exactly as they should be.  The plate came with a side of bannock which was made fresh and was still warm -yum!  The decor was comfortable yet elegant (you really do feel as if you are in a refined log cabin).  The atmosphere was just perfect.  I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I came here with one of my good friends for Winterlicious dinner and I thought it was a great meal, and I would definitely consider coming back. As I couldn't really choose what I wanted, I kind of forced my friend to share his dishes with me. (LOL definitely the best way to taste more than one dish at a time!)

For the appetizer, I got the Kale Caesar Salad with Harissa-Spiced East Coast Shrimp, Dulse, Bannock Croutons. The dish wasn't too bad except that the dressing was a tad bit much. The shrimps were spiced nicely and had a great flavor to them. I also had a taste of the Black Barley & Piccalilli Salad with Sugar Beet Hummus, Rutabaga, and Dukkah Spice. The dish was very pretty and colourful, however the piccalilli was pretty overpowering. It had a great texture and it was definitely an interesting salad to have. 

For the main dish, I had the Gnocchi \"Fauxlognese\" - Meatless Mushroom Bolognese, Spinach and Thunder Oak Gouda. It was surprising really good. The flavor combination within this dish was absolutely beautiful. The gnocchi was nice and fluffy and the meatless mushroom Bolognese sauce was everything I wanted. I enjoyed this dish very much. I also had a taste of the Pressed Ontario Pork Shoulder with Simmered Cabbage, Northern Woods Mushrooms, Allspice Tomato Sugo. It wasn't exactly the greatest dish. The pork shoulder was nicely done however the cabbage seemed to overpower the taste of the pork shoulder. 
 
For the best part of the meal, dessert, I had the Cheesy Chocolate Cannoli. The chocolate peanut sauce was to die for. I could have honestly licked my plate if no one was watching (lol). When combined with the brittle and cream cheese I think I could have had this every day for dessert and not get sick of it. I also tried the Sticky Bannoffee Cake. The caramel was delicious but it wasn't anything special. 

Overall, I love how they used local produce in these dishes. The vibe of this restaurant is very relaxed and chill even though it could get pretty loud at times. I had a great time and would definitely love to go back and try their other dishes."}
{"text":"Signature dishes. Love the place and the food. We ordered fish cake and it was amazingly good."}
{"text":"I was impressed as soon as I walked in the door when a guy came over, mentioned he was new and couldn't seat us but just wanted to make sure someone said hi to us. That being said the host showed up promptly and seated us right away. I was there with some friends from abroad that I hadn't seen in a long time so we had a lot of catching up to do. Our server was very accommodating and gave us all the time we needed. It was a long dinner with much chatting before we ordered and after our plates were cleared and our server was available when we needed her but never hovered or rushed us. All restaurants should be like this. The food was great too. I had the meatballs with cornbread and collard greens. The meatballs were fantastic and the cornbread was nice and spicy and served warm. I wish there had been more greens on the plate as I am a believer in a healthy balanced plate and this was almost entirely meat and cornbread. So not the healthiest choice, but this isn't the place you go for healthy food. Overall, a fantastic experience that I will definitely return for."}
{"text":"I was expecting something totally different:  Canadian comfort food.  What we got was odd nouvelle cuisine.  Service was weird, too!  The waiter never asked how the rest of us were enjoying our meals, he only addressed my husband.  The food was very under seasoned and the combinations of flavors did not work. My daughter had the Jail Island Salmon (MAPLE GLAZE, SMOKED BACON, MUSHROOMS, WHEATBERRIES, WILD RICE), my son the Chicken Pot Pie, and my husband had the Griddled Octopus (CHORIZO, CRANBERRY BEANS, ALMONDS, STEWED TOMATOES, ESCAROLE).  All were under seasoned and unmemorable.  I had the Onion Glazed Pork Shoulder, which was very tender and delicious, but it came with Spaetzle which was dreadful!  If only we'd known....we wouldn't have visited this restaurant on our last night in the city."}
{"text":"Not dying to go back, but it was ok. 

Get something with bannock bread! The bread is, obviously, what makes this place most different than others. It was worth trying once.  

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I came for brunch on the weekend and had the turkey burger. 

The patty was juicy and big, the pretzel bun was more fun than a regular bun, and the pickle mayo was really tasty. The rest? meh! 

I tried the duck poutine on bannock too - not much duck and not tasty enough for seconds. (I would recommend sharing this with someone else if you get it - lots of carbs on one plate!)

__________________________________________________________
Parking was a bit tricky to find. :P

Service was fine!"}
{"text":"I always enjoy my time at Bannock.  One of the best turkey burgers I've found in Toronto.  A good selection of food that has a unique Canadian twist...  I enjoy how each O&B property had a unique dining experience and creative menus that are separate from one another...  Good and friendly service."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times more since my initial review and I continue to be impressed by the food. I wish it was closer, because I would go more often. It is quite a loud venue though, so be prepared to yell over your meal depending on how busy it is.

However, the last time I was there, I had a non-alcoholic cocktail (I don't drink), but it wasn't worth the money and it was quite bland. I wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"Three words: Duck Poutine Pizza. I really don't think it gets any better. 

I simply love this spot. It's my go to whenever I'm in the financial district. I always seem to get a table relatively quick. Service is also pretty quick. The food is beyond words. Wine selection is great."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner after my fiance finished work one evening.  It was relatively early and so there was plenty of seating and the wait staff were helpful and nice.  

We ordered: 
1) The Duck Poutine Pizza -  It's been recommended by quite a number of people and who doesn't love pizza, duck or poutine on their own...so putting them together must be good right? Truthfully, I didn't love it.  It was a very large dish, so you definitely need to share.  The dish is kind of awkward....you're not sure to eat it with your hands or eat it with a fork and knife...or what? Should I eat it as a pizza or eat it as a poutine....it felt like a confused dish.  In the end, I didn't love it.  The flavours were ok...but everything put together was not an appealing combination. 

2) Chicken Pot Pie - This dish is the epitome of good comfort food. The pie is so creamy and rich and the pie crust is flaky and delicious.  I actually only rated this restaurant a 4/5 because of this one dish.  I would come back to eat this again and again. The dish is quite heavy and filling especially since it comes with mashed potatoes (which I would say are pretty good if you like your mash smooth and creamy).  So in order to not feel like you're going to fall asleep after eating here, I would suggest switching it up for some greens instead.    

Overall, we liked Bannock...but I think only based upon the chicken pot pie.  I would come back to try other dishes in the future for sure."}
{"text":"been to Bannock 5 times now, I am a fan of most O&B restaurants, especially Canteen. The food at Bannock is great, especially on crummy winter days, the Chicken Pot Pie is out of this world, so are the BLT Bannocks if you want something to grab and go. Highly Recommend!"}
{"text":"We went to bannock yesterday April 2016. The food was bland. Service was fine. However, the manager told us they had a reservation on our table when there were empty tables and none had \"Reserved\" on them. This was after we paid promptly and was still chatting. So that means don't pay or you will be pressured to leave. When I got home, my friend messaged me. We both had tummy problems and I had a vegetarian meal. Cross-contamination? needless to say I am not going back. there are too many restaurants in Toronto to be asked to leave after paying. Train your staff properly on how to treat customers."}
{"text":"The food was delicious! The place, almost always, seems to be packed! 

However, I felt something was lacking, I think I'd like to blame the atmosphere, I didn't enjoy looking into a department store while I enjoyed my meal. Also the service always seemed too nonchalant. So in short, the atmosphere was almost boring.  

I've been there twice though, and always enjoyed my meal."}
{"text":"Such a cool place across from the city hall. I had my first and best green mac & cheese at bannock. I forgot what made it green. All I know is that I ate everything to the last noodle and that does not happen very often. You just keep eating it wondering why why why is it green and why why is it giving the flavour. But I tell you it is addictive. It looks a little green, but don't be afraid, you will like it. Not overly cheesy or salty. Moving onto another oddity, I had today's special. Korean pork belly pizza. I am not sure how these two go together and really wasn't expecting anything. But wow the the pork belly was tender and flavourful on a think crust. I ate two slices on top of my bowl of mac & cheese. So this says it all. I am not sure how Korean the flavour is, I can taste soy sauce for sure, but it was a good balance of sweet, salty and fatty. I very much enjoyed my meal and the reasonable dinner price. On the other hand, their coffee is not really good so I took off one star."}
{"text":"Good menu options and good service.  The dining room was full when we arrived so we sat on the cafe side. I had the Octopus and my date had the Pot Pie. Both were satisfying. We also had a glass of the house red which wasn't anything special. Still a good spot to check out - especially compared to the other restaurant options in the area."}
{"text":"I went with a party of 6 and we all enjoyed ourselves.  I got a Caesar Salad to share (which I'm glad I shared) as an appetizer and got the Duck Poutine Pizza as my main.  I should have shared the pizza as well because it was way to big to finish alone.  The pizza dough plus all of the fries = too much carbs.  But overall, the place was great.  

Service: 4.5
Food: 4
Atmosphere: 3.5
Overall Experience: 4

The only downside for me was that it felt more like a food court rather than a restaurant, but as long as the food is good, I'm happy."}
{"text":"Taste was good. Portion size too big perhaps. Sound level is medium. Overall - happy with the experience."}
{"text":"Had the chicken pot pie and a mixed greens salad.  The pie was great:  the filling was like a thick chicken stew (some places can be a bit watery) with large pieces of white meat, although the pastry was a bit dense and well-done for my liking.   The service was glacially slow, and I've found that at a lot of the O&B restaurants.   

No reason not to eat here if you're walking past, but no reason to seek the place out either."}
{"text":"Food is ok. When I am in the mood for heavy food I come here because it is close. I usually have the margarita pizza which is good some times and kind of doughy other times. The inconsistency makes this place meh for me."}
{"text":"Excellent food, wonderful service.  Mostly mall-goers in there, so no great ambiance, but great food and attentive staff"}
{"text":"I usually find O&B restaurants solid, but not extraordinary. The fare: sandwiches and pizza make it probably a great place for a business lunch and I was leery for supper. But I was surprised by how delicious Bannock was: we ordered the trout and tuna mains, and both were super delicious. Really perfectly executed. Smore dessert was a little too rich and the ambiance not the greatest but a great date night meal."}
{"text":"Dinner here is overhyped and overpriced. Good idea but weak execution and thin wine list. Will return to try lunch."}
{"text":"I'm always sceptical when going to a restaurant close to make shopping and touristy areas, but this experience was worth it. The ratings are accurate. They take simple dishes and mage them very tasty using their own flair. Worth it to go."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner last weekend to enjoy the last vestiges of patio season. We were allowed to choose our table since it wasn't busy outside and if you're a people watcher, you'll love this tiny space. Otherwise, it is not a place to bring a first date.

I had a dessert craving so I didn't want a heavy main course, which is very difficult here. Went with the vegetarian Cobb salad, which sounded safe enough since it couldn't possibly be bacon-filled. The salad toppings were served on whole romaine leaves, which made it necessary for me to attack it with a knife and fork. The whole thing seemed to be \"dressed\" in the runny filling of the deviled eggs in the dish... I'd been hoping to avoid the yolks mostly, but that was impossible. Overall, as a balanced meal, it was a mostly acceptable option, if poorly presented.

Now, onto dessert. We ordered and shared a S'mores pie and the butter tart. The pie was heavenly. Roasted marshmallows, dense chocolate mousse (or flourless cake?) and a graham cracker crust. It was topped with raspberry syrup, which I found to be unnecessary and not worth the incremental hit of sugar. Ask for it without, if possible.

The butter tart wasn't so much a butter tart as it was a flaky pastry cup filled with what tasted like dulce de leche. It was runny, overly sweet, and not at all what I expect in a Canadian butter tart.

The table next to us ordered the pie and the sour cream donuts to share, and abandoned the donuts after one bite.

The service was attentive and professional, in line with other O&B restos.

All in all, Bannock didn't have what I was looking for; if I were going to indulge and eat a week's worth of calories somewhere, it certainly wouldn't be here."}
{"text":"Came here for Winterlicious. None of the food was bad, but all I can say that the overall impression my two friends and I left with was... a little bland and underwhelming. Kept waiting for that explosion of complex flavours in my mouth and never got it. Probably great if you're the type of person who only eats white bread for dinner."}
{"text":"Canadian comfort food is this places tag line but its so much more than that. This O&B owned cafe & restaurant takes simple comfort food, upscales it and twists it. From roasted duck poutine pizza to high end mac and cheese this place reinvents comfort food at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"I have been here several times and Bannock never disappoints! The first time, I stumbled in by accident. I had the bannock and my friend had lamb. We were blown away. I returned twice after. The prices were very decent, most mains around 15 - 25. My personal fave is the butter tart!"}
{"text":"The food menus were creative. Location was very convenient. Salads were great but the rice noddles dish that I have tried did not tasted that great."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time today, despite walking by it dozens of times.  I had been shopping for hours, and was tired, fed up, and hungry.  No problem getting a table for one (I had a choice of several spots), and both the hostess and the waitress were attentive and friendly.  As a woman who eats alone often in restaurants, it's nice not to be shunted into a corner to hide!

The menu was interesting, with something for everyone - vegetarian options, lighter meals, sandwiches, and salads, all with unusual twists to them.  I had a hard time deciding.

Had the \"bannock bannock\" which seems a redundant name - a smoked salmon (on the menu, stated \"house smoked\" salmon) on bannock bread, with fresh greens, dill, capers, pickled onion and cream cheese.  It all worked.  The sandwich was accompanied by strange but delicious veggie chips, (which tasted even better with just a little salt).  Also had an excellent latte, made just right.

The crowd on an early Saturday was mixed, with upscale shoppers mixed with young families and some students.  I was astonished at the number of duck poutine pizzas being served - until I came back to my hotel, read the in-house magazine article on the restaurant, and all about what seems to have become a phenomenon in T.O.

Overall, great location (2 minutes, max from Yonge and Queen/Eaton's Centre), friendly and attentive service, and good food.  I would definitely go again, although I have some doubts about the poutine pizza, despite all the raves."}
{"text":"Last Saturday, my (now) husband & I had a simple civil marriage ceremony @ city hall, then went to Bannock for a nice, low key dinner. 

We were absolutely blown away by the customer service! Cannot remember the last time we had a waiter so knowledgable, friendly, and genuine. (Just wish I had caught his name..) 

We had a party of 7, and everyone was pleased with their dish. They treated us like gold! Provided the table with a selection of delicious h'orderves -- on the house ;) Our friends brought a bottle of champagne, which they did not charge a corking fee for, and they let us continue our celebration 90 minutes after the restaurant had closed. 

Bannock really made our night special & we are very happy!"}
{"text":"Great service great meal had the grilled octopus wanted to lick the plate when I was done definitely a fan"}
{"text":"This place is the best !! We came to Toronto for the weekend and didn't know where to eat, so we thought we would give this place a try and we're glad we did ! The food was so delicious and the service was great. Would definitely come back here again. 5 stars !"}
{"text":"Well, I had high hopes, and sadly, they were dashed.  Love the concept, but was more than a little saddened by the experience.

First, the highlights.  Our server was extremely nice and competent, knew the menu through and through and did a nice job of taking care of us.  Also, the tortiere was truly exceptional.  One of the best I've had - just melted in my mouth.

Everything else, unfortunately, was a disappointment.  Salt cod doughnuts were an intriguing concept, poorly executed.  Tasteless, bland, and sad.  The $7 Yukon fries that my wife had were indistinguishable from fast food french fries.  My wife's mushy, disappointing pad thai was something of an embarrassment to the concept of pad thai.  And, don't even get me started about the frozen veggies that came with my tortiere.  Frozen vegetables?  Really?  On a restaurant plate?  Really?  Some were even still a little frozen.  Just like Mom used to make for some, perhaps...  Butter tart for dessert was fine, but nothing remarkable or interesting.

Last, but not least, the room was a little sad somehow.  It seems like it should be terrific, but it's lacking a certain je ne sais quoi that just made it seem tired.  

Wasn't a complete bust, but I, for one, won't be back."}
{"text":"I love this place! The dishes are delicious and hearty, and the staff is incredibly warm. I tried their Orecchiette pasta and it was amazing, as were the taco appetizers and the s'mores pie for dessert. Highly recommend, whether you're stopping in for a lunch in the city or a more leisurely dinner."}
{"text":"I'd give this place a 7.5 out of 10. The northern woods mushroom gnocchi was tasty but a little over-salted for my liking. My boyfriend enjoyed the turkey burger. We ordered a bread basket to start, which was pretty good, but I wish it came with more hummus!"}
{"text":"Fast, delicious, attentive - just three words I would use to describe the lovely Bannock, conveniently located near Toronto's bustling Eaton Centre.

With a Canadian-themed menu and a roomie, busy dining room (as well as pop-in cafe), Bannock is the nice restaurant harried shoppers have been waiting for. Most impressive is the service: even when it's at its busiest, friendly servers consistently check in, make suggestions, and pour refills. Also: it's really fast. Meals are served within fifteen minutes (maximum) of being ordered. 

My only complaint - and it's tiny - is the lack of non-heavy stuff on the menu. With items like duck poutine pizza, fritters, mac and cheese, and venison chili, finding good lighter fare can be a challenge, even with the PEI mussels and salad selections. Crudites come with lobster roll and artisanal bread (which is admittedly delicious) - but how about offering said items a la carte? Sometimes a woman just wants a glass of champagne and a few good, naked oysters (hold the back bacon, please). Alas, it's not at Bannock.

Still, if kitschy Canadian-themed comfort food is what you're after, Bannock is a good bet. The service is tops, the food is fast, and the price point is just right. After spending a pushing hour or two at the Eatons Center or in the hustle-bustle of Yonge Street, plunk yourself onto one of Bannock's comfy chairs; they'll take good care of you."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure what to expect at Bannock as I find there is a lot of hype surrounding the O&B enterprise establishments and I'm not convinced that it's even warranted but alas, I've not tried all their restos so I can't really lump them into one and pass judgment on them as though they are one entity--that would be unfair after all. I did try to take a friend from out of town to Bannock a few weeks back as he always has to have poutine when in town and I thought we'd go for the duck poutine pizza just for a change, but reservations were unavailable for the times we wanted them so we had to move on.

I was able to secure seating for a friend and I on Saturday just before a night at the opera. Since the production would be almost five hours long, I thought it best to eat before and after the performance, plus I'm a greedy pig when it comes to food so that was just me being ...well, greedy. It was busy when we got there, and smelled pretty good. The place has an open kitchen which is the first thing you notice when you walk through the revolving doors which I think used to house the Bay's Juicy Couture section, if I recall correctly. It's a nice little space, a little tight in some areas but manageable.

I was intent on sharing the duck poutine pizza with my friend as people seem to rave about it and also of its volume, but when I saw what the guy next to us was having (pulled pork stuffed in a bannock with a scrumptious and busy-looking salad on the side), I couldn't NOT have a bannock! I didn't want to be suffering itis during the never-ending opera, all cramped-up in those little seats with so little legroom, so I suggested we order a bannock and a salad and share, while he continue knocking back a few drinks at the same time (I suppose this was in preparation for the opera--dammit, why can't I find a man who loves the opera as much as I do??). I was confused when our order came but it appears the waitress either got our order wrong or gave us someone else's meal but we ended up with a cheeseburger and what was probably the Bannock caesar salad. Both were very good, so I didn't mind the mix-up. The salad was fresh and the greens were nice and crunchy with just the right amount of flavour and texture, thanks to the shaved cheese, peppercorns, and bannock croutons which were haphazardly torn up by hand and tossed into the salad. The \"High River Alberta ground brisket\" burger was suuuuper-beefy-tasting and I enjoyed it a lot, quite delicious! It came in a bun that was much like challa bread but a slightly sweet egg bread for sure, topped with a white cheese (not sure which) and a few large taro crisps, which were perfect! 

Service was decent, and normally I might not be so pleased about our order being wrong but I did step out for a moment while my friend ordered and he WAS drinking so who knows what that lush actually ordered! They have salads and other little starters, pizzas and sandwiches, as well as other meat and fish dishes on their menu. I definitely need to go back there to try other items. If you can get a table, I would recommend you check it out. It's the perfect spot if you are planning an evening at the Four Seasons Centre; you can get in and out within about an hour so plan accordingly."}
{"text":"Had lunch here for the first time and enjoyed the food alot.  I stuck to trying Canadian comfort food - poutine and chicken pot pie. A lot of food for lunch and everything came out piping hot. The poutine came with a generous amount of gravy and cheese curds with a touch of green onions and rosemary.  Great dish to share.  The chicken pot pie was tasty and the sauce not too thick which I like.  Good amount of chicken pieces and came with a side of mash potatos served with gravy.  The staff were all very friendly and helpful with our menu questions.  My only compliant is it gets really loud in there and hard to hear our own conversations. But will return to try the other dishes."}
{"text":"My friend and I passed by this place and it doesn't look special in anyway from the outside but the atmosphere inside was really warm and inviting.  We were seated and our waiter (appeared to be) very very nice and charming.  He spoke with us about the menu and we had a little small talk also.  Everything on the menu looked so good that we had trouble deciding what to order.  We ended up choosing the roasted duck poutine pizza.  They told us the pizza was very larger and suggested us to share it, so we ordered an appetizer to go with that instead or another entree.  Both food items were amazing and the waiter was amazing as well.  When we finished, we paid for our food and left a 20% tip.  The waiter seemed to either be unhappy about his tip or decided that he does not have to serve us anymore because we paid and tipped.  He pretty much ignored us...which felt a bit strange since he was the friendliest person just before.  Even when we left, he looked the other way and my friend went up to him and said bye.  We were a bit offended how he completely ignored us 100% after the bill.  Usually waiters would at least say BYE, have a good night!  We just felt he was a bit fake."}
{"text":"I've had The Poutine, The Free Range Turkey Burger, and The Gourmet Mac & Cheese.

Goodness me, this restaurant is astonishing! I have been here on two separate occasions (both being the Bay Street Location) and everything has been incredible, service included I might add, our waiter was incredibly nice and well informed. I'm not sure you could go wrong with a single item on their menu as presentation, creativity, and careful thought on flavour all play a factor in their dishes. The turkey burger was succulent, the poutine divine (save for the green onions), and the Mac & Cheese was heavenly. I don't give out the five star rating often, in fact this will be my first time doing so, but Bannock deserves recognition for its contribution to Torontonian cuisine."}
{"text":"Bannock is my favourite place downtown. I can get a quick coffee or sandwich if there isn't time for a real meal, I can get a beer while I wait for a meeting. I can also go back for dinner and have a delicious yet surprisingly affordable meal. At lunch I really enjoy the Turkey Burger with guacamole and a tempura battered onion ring. The meat is moist which is usually the challenge with turkey, isn't it?

The steak is great. The hearty duck-poutine pizza is a little much unless you really hate yourself, and the chicken pot pie with mashed potatoes is perfect. The meatless options are slim, but all quite good as well. So really, there's no reason not to go.

Reservations now accepted for lunch."}
{"text":"What a disappointment, dishes ranged from just average to subpar, between the three of us there wasnt even one single standout and a few were just downright bad like the apple fritters which tasted like stale donuts and the korean pizza which used siracha instead of tomato sauce, some fusion ideas are just wrong.  Only positives I can think of was the location and service which was friendly"}
{"text":"Lunch at Bannock was amazing!

Everything about this place is outstanding.  The modern and clean lines of the space makes it feel airy while the rustic wood panels and solid wooden chairs make the space feel homey.  The dining area is perfect for large groups of friends and family.  Exceptional food and good variety (burgers & sandwiches, salads, pasta dishes, couple of vegetarian options, bannocks & pizzas, fish, meat & poultry).  Friendly and attentive staff.

If you are looking for a hearty lunch, I highly recommend the Onion Glazed Pork Shoulder ($18).  It was melt-in-your-mounth good.  Pork shoulder was smokey and tender.  It sat on a bed of delicious spaetzle which was rich in flavor on its own.  I love, love the lightly pickled and roasted apple cubes, the sweetness complimented the pork so beautifully.

Boneless Back Rib Burger + Smokey Tomato Jam ($15) was succulent and flavorful.  The maple mustard BBQ made this burger a finger-licking-good heaven on a bun.

Do save room for Sour Cream Donuts ($8).  I wouldn't share the donuts with anyone.  They were perfectly fried.  Golden on the outside and super moist on the inside.  Sprinkle them with thyme and scoop the sauce all over it.  OMG, I want more of them."}
{"text":"Duck poutine pizza. Of course, that is what everyone is talking about. I'm still thinking about it the next day. It's one of those dishes that is perfect for the great white north. The kind of food you need to fatten up before the great hibernation. If bears could, they would order the duck poutine pizza before they slept for the winter. And after a lunch of this pizza I needed a nap. It's definitely worth a trip to Bannock to eat this deliciousness especially if you need to bulk up for a long cold winter."}
{"text":"This is the last O&B restaurant I hadn't tried so I ended up coming for Sunday brunch. The menu has some interesting items, I picked the roast duck poutine pizza (good but way too much food for one person) and Jia had bannock box (an interesting vegetarian option). My main complaint is the staff were a bit rude, although it was busy they could have made better effort to be friendly and helpful. Overall a decent option for brunch with a nice trendy atmosphere."}
{"text":"This was my first time at the restaurant, and I was overall pleasantly surprised.  I came on a Wednesday night, and it wasn't too busy.  I was seated and served right away.  My server, Matt, was very friendly, attentive, and made great suggestions from the menu.

I had their soup of the day, which was potato and ginger.  Strange combination, but was very tasty and refreshing.

For the main, I had the Miheer's curried lamb shoulder, which was served over garlic roti.  The meat was tender and well-seasoned.  The portion size was a lot for me, but I wasn't disappointed by the overall taste.  I didn't have room for dessert, but I did order the butter tart to go.

Bannock is on the pricey side, but I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Actually didn't get served our meal.  However, after a super busy lunch hour and acknowledgement of their disappointing service, they made good by not charging us the items that came very late and still provided it to go.  I'm upset about not getting our meal, but I really like the amount of attention they put towards making it right."}

I tried bannock in October and that was already after all the woo'ing and ahh'ing has died down a bit after their grand opening. This post is way too old and I am sure there are so many posts on bannock already but I am still going to do a post on it just because I want to personally talk about how much I love this restaurant.

When I first walked in, we were told they didn't have liquor license for the day so all beverages would be on the house, YAY! Inside of the restaurant is not very big but they laid out the tables really well with nice touches of interior here and there.

Ordered: CLEARWATER LOBSTER ROLL + ROOT VEG CRUDITES 5/5
*Lobster roll served with root vegetable salad for $16.00
*This was absolutely delicious in every way possible
*It looks small but it's quite filling
*The bread is very soft (potato bread texture) which went well with the chunky lobster pieces
*There wasn't too much sauce for the lobster fillings which I appreciated because that over-rides the lobster pieces and will make your bread soggy
*Root vegetables sald was SO good! I loved the light and refreshing dressing it really complimented the lobster roll
*There were big chunky lobster pieces as well as bits of cucumber
*It had nice presentation plus sandwich was light and perfect for lunch
*I would absolutely get this again

Ordered: MAC & CHEESE 4/5
*Bowl of Mac & Cheese with Great Canadian Cheese and Crunchy flax granola toppings for $14.00
*Plate comes super hot and it's a big portion for lunch
*Because it was so hot, I burnt the top of my mouth when I took a bite...but so worth it! 
*It's drenched in rich creamy white cheese sauce and some more cheese melted on top
*There were lots of spinach in it which was really delicious with the pasta
*This dish would be good if you shared with someone since it is a very heavy dish
*Luxurious version of your everyday Mac & Cheese

Ordered: ROASTED DUCK POUTINE PIZZA 3/5
*Fries, Curds and Duck on Pizza for $15.00
*This was that one dish everyone talked about from bannock
*I love poutine, but wasn't sure if I liked it on my Pizza
*As I was trying to make up my mind, our waiter recommended it to me once I sat down so I decided to give it a try
*This is a huge pizza, probably enought for 2 girls
*It looks absolutely amazing and smells fabulous
*There weren't much duck on the pizza but it was covered in so much fries
*I liked the poutine part, but didn't really like it as pizza
*It just became a giant dough in my mouth as I was chewing it 
*I am glad I tried it but probably wouldn't get it again

Ordered: PICKEREL TACO + CUCUMBER APPLE SALAD 4/5
*Pickerel Taco on steamed bun with Caviar Tartar for $11.00
*This reminds me of the pork buns served at many asian restaurants
*It was very tasty but so small in portion (not enough even for a girl)
*Pickerel pieces were juicy and bursting with flavor
*Everything went really well together in the steamed bun
*Cucumber apple salad was light and refreshing
*Would be good as an appetizer

Ordered: ONTARIO VENISON CHUCK CHILI N/A
*Venison Chuck Chili with Great northern beans and bannock for $15.00
*My friend ordered this and I just had a bite of it
*I am not a big fan of chili (I've finally decided) so I didn't really like it
*But it was very hearty, rich and bursting with flavor

Ordered: ST-CANUT PULLED PORK TOURTIERE 3/5
*Pulled pork pie with honeyed roots and heinz ketchup for $16.00
*Pie crust was flaky and done just right
*Inside is filled with so much pulled pork pieces
*Honeyed Roots didn't need any sauce it was sweet and soft on it's own
*It was served with Heinz ketchup for a reason, everything tastes good with ketchup (personal preferance)

Summary: Bannock is always busy, and I guess people can depend on this restaurant to be at certain level (food & service wise) because it's owned by Oliver & Bonaccini. And they def did not disappoint! I've been back to bannock at least 3 times after my first visit and it just keeps on getting better. I always leave the restaurant satisfied with the delicious food they offer. Did I mention they have the friendliest staff ever? I officially love bannock. If you haven't been there, you are missing out."}
{"text":"We had a margherita pizza $14, daily soup $5, fresh squeeze (blueberry and apple) $5, and green salad, 10.

The food was great. We loved it. The service was good too. Like the atmosphere. Will go back again."}
{"text":"Met up here again with some friends. This time we had a ton of food. I was stuffed after eating a third of the poutine duck pizza  to start and the grilled cheese as a main.

My friend could be heard saying \"this is like crack\" while chowing down on the poutine duck pizza. We pretty much didn't have room for the rest of the meal after that as a shared appetizer!"}
{"text":"Food was average or slightly above.

Service was mediocre."}
{"text":"We tried to get into a couple of highly rated restaurants on Saturday night, but they were all booked. So despite some fairly negative comments about Bannock on Yelp, we gave it a try -- and loved it.  That pizza thing, with poutine, looked like just way too much, not really that appetizing, so we skipped it. I had an excellent trout rubbed with ancho chilies, my son had an absolutely divine -- velvety -- chicken pot pie and my daughter was satisfied with her Pad Thai.  We started with bowls of broccoli soup and that was great too, not overly creamy, more of a broccoli bisque.

Our waiter was fine, personable and really new the menu when we asked questions.  When we first got there, the staff did seem a bit overwhelmed but that was at the height of the rush, so by the time we settled in, they had settled down. 

We dug the decor too, sort of farmhouse meets modhouse."}
{"text":"I really like this restaurant. Have eaten here about 8 times over the past few years. Every time I go, I'd tend to give it 5 stars, and after this most recent visit, I would not change my assessment. The chefs pair together excellent flavours and the wait staff is very attentive. It can be loud for a business lunch but the atmosphere is definitely excellent. I've eaten the pizza, various salads, soups and pasta and all have been yummy. The nasty sauce is really tasty!"}
{"text":"Excellent service! We ate here as a part of the Summerlicious campaign and all three of us enjoyed the food thoroughly. Very well put together menu and a generally good vibe."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying Bannock I'll be back!

The only thing that I can guarantee 100% is that I will not be getting the burger next time.  It was an ok burger at best and that makes me sad to say as I decided on the burger after talking about getting a burger all day due to a craving.

We started with the poutine which was surprisingly and blasphemously good.  Seriously, poutine = cheese curds (ALWAYS) and spiced gravy!  It was very tasty, not to salty, the cheese curds melted in perfectly and the fries were good.

I had a chance to try the pot pie and it was amazing.  It was definitely the best pot pie I've ever tasted.  The pie was perfectly flaky on the outside and the inside had a perfect filling that was rich and creamy.  I've had some that were runny but this was fantastic.

I have no doubt my rating will go up the next time I'm here and honestly it is somewhere between a 3 and a 4.  I was just pretty disappointed with my burger and the root chips.  The root chips were really oily as well."}
{"text":"***3.5 Stars***

I visited Bannock with friends last night, I made reservations just in case it would be packed on a Wednesday.  I am glad I did, the place was bustling at 6:30pm!  We were immediately seated to our table.  The dining area was cozy and modern, I love how it looked out into the Bay store where you could people watch folks shopping!

Food

Appetizer

Bannock Bread basket - it came with the special house dip of the day, it took us a few minutes to realize that the dip was in the bottom of the dish which was covered by the bread.  It would have been nice to have the dip on the side.  Bread was fresh, I did try a bannock, it is kinda like a flat bread.

Entree

Pickerel Taco - soo good, portion size way too small.  They were like baby tacos as my friends described them.  I could have eaten a few more of them.  The steamed bun is similar to the Korean pork buns.  If you want something light to eat and are not that hungry, this is the perfect entree!

Vegetable Cobb - my SO was expecting a bigger portion for a salad but it came in a dandy plate.  It was interesting because there were different parts of the Cobb salad. Overall, my SO gave the dish an ok.

Duck Poutine Pizza - over the top gluttonous, it was good but way too heavy.  My friend and I could not even finish half of the pizza.  I would recommend sharing this dish with 4 others.  I felt sluggish after eating it.

Service

Great service, our waitress kept on filling up our waters and checking in with us.  Our food was brought to our table quickly.

Overall - 3.5 stars
Food - 3.5 stars
Service - 4 stars
 
I will definitely be back at Bannock to try out their other menu items.  Check it out yourself if you are in the Eaton Centre area!"}
{"text":"Got the gnocchi for dinner. Found it to be dry, overdone and overpriced. The elderberry drink I got here was yummy but I won't be coming back for it."}
{"text":"Tried the pierogies here and it was fantastic - perfect textures and flavour wise it was not too rich. The gnocchi dish was also a great choice. I found the butternut squash added a nice playful  sweetness and a hint of lemon really offset the star richness as well. The turkey burger however was very dry and bland with a disappointing bun. The fish tacos were also a disappointment because they drenched it with unnecessary asian fish sauce and ginger. The atmosphere was warm not too dim and the service was excellent. Overall would come again!"}
{"text":"O Canada!
Our home and native land!
True patriot love... and give me duck poutine pizza.

So, after a half bottle of (Niagara region) wine, I'm now writing this review.
I'm not a huge fan of O&B restaurants, so I was very surprised of how great my experience was here.

Service was 5 star.
The hostess was friendly, fun, and engaging.
Our server did a great job recommending his favourites.

Bannock's oh-so-popular duck poutine pizza ($15)  was a hit and lived up to it's reputation.  Loads of fries with gravy, succulent duck meat on top of a thin bannock styled flat bread.  One of my friends at the table made bannock in elementary school (in Calgary) and thought that Bannock did a great job with this traditional aboriginal flat bread.

The Venison chilli was filling and very interesting.  Finely ground venison and lots of beans.  I don't love chilli, but admittedly it really hit the spot on a cold evening.

Our server spoke highly of the pickerel taco with cucumber salad ($13).  It ended up being the least liked dish at the table.  Too sweet.  Too much mayo and apple.  Creamy and sweet with a doughy, soft bread.  It just didn't work for me.

Dessert was spectacular though.
I wanted some more s'more pie ($8)!
I would have to say it's one of the top 5 (dessert) items I've ever put in my mouth.
The chocolate part in the middle was more similar to a ganache and not a brownie.  It wasn't a heavy dessert at all.  The warm marshmallow and graham bits reminded me of making s'mores over a fire pit.  Loved it.

Bannock is a great casual spot for Canadian Comfort food.
I can't wait to come back and try some of the other items!
Now I'm off to find a Zamboni driver and get myself a Timmy's coffee."}
{"text":"Came on a Wednesday night with reservation. Bannock definitely looks quite busy for a Wednesday but we got seated just right at the reservation time for two.

Servers were quick and attentive, they tried to make small talks and they introduced their specials of the night with no problems. I went with the chicken pot pie and my friend got the special: salmon pasta. 

We both loved our food. Portion was generous and holy ALL WINES ARE 50% OFF WEDNESDAYS!! I think that gave us the biggest surprise. We got a bottle of Rose to share for only $22. AMAZING DEAL.

I think everything is pretty good at Bannock. Very satisfied just like other Yelpers =)

Lastly, the restaurant is not too loud, you are able to carry a conversation without yelling at each other."}
{"text":"Bannock - good taste in food for the value however NOT CHEAP ... $$ not really correct should be ranked as $$$ however well worth the visit and nosh ...

Very creative menu and every meal a surprise in flavour where you cant go wrong ... careful not a calorie counting restaurant to visit !!!!

just down right yummy!"}
{"text":"The Duck Poutine pizza was difficult to approach, but well worth the mess that I made."}
{"text":"Walked by here, looked cozy, so I ate.

First thing you would notice is the open kitchen and sandwich area as soon as you walk in.  Right side is the wine bar, left side is the dining room.

The menu is interesting.  I had their tabbouleh, steak, brick chicken, cream of mushroom, warm s'more pie, and butter tart.  Not in one night you silly sausage.  The tabbouleh was not exactly the tabbouleh you would expect.  I would describe it as \"I would not order it again\".  Check out the photo I uploaded for it.  The skirt steak was quite juicy.  Brick chicken was very interesting.  It was chicken pressed on by bacon pressed on by chicken.  Its like a chicken sandwich.  Yum!  Cream of mushroom, which has real mushroom, is pretty good, but not as good as the one I had in Philly (Fri Sat Sun).  Probably because they didnt put in any brandy.

I am not a big fan of s'more, but their s'more pie changed my life!  As one of the follow four squarer said, \"it's like eating a chocolate covered angel.\"  I couldn't agreed more.  I also had their butter tart, which is pretty much heaven in a form of a tart.  Gosh, I am drooling as I type.

They regular menu is pretty diversified.  Got rabbit stew, burgers, pizza, poutine, a lot of Canadian soul food.  They have a special menu, which is written on the wall.  Sometimes they would have rabbit steak, sometimes it would caribou.

This concludes my foodie field report.

The End."}
{"text":"It was ok, but nothing really exciting nor memorable. I had the tataki and chowder and both were lacking flavour. I felt the wasabi overpowered the salad and tuna, while the cod chowder was a tad bland and under seasoned. My colleague had the bologna and eggs and he did like it, but I didn't try it. So I can't really comment. We had good and friendly service."}
{"text":"(Background)
Earlier this week a gaggle of friends and I went to try the Canadian comfort food at Bannock, and it is indeed comfy. What is Canadian cuisine, I hear you ask (as I had asked myself)? Not just maple syrup and beavertails, here they have fresh ingredients in fresh takes on the classics: poutine, Habitant pea soup, wild mushrooms, trout, haddock, pot pie, venison, s'mores, and butter tarts! Habitant pea soup has been traced back 400 years (http://is.gd/E7a3vr)  to have been eaten by the French explorer Samuel de Champlain, a name most of us will recognize for founding Quebec City and making a great map. I digress.

(Ambiance)
The ambiance is modern casual but cottagey, with wooden plank-lined walls and marble accents, garnished with swank lighting. An open view to the kitchen and everything in sight being nicely ordered on the shelves put my slightly OCD-side at ease. From the outside it looks supah fancy but when seated it feels comfortable if a bit open. Our server was Marcel and he is a gem. Considerate and conversational without overstepping, he made good suggestions and provided timely service. Ask for him.

(Mains)
The food was tasty, but not the best I've had for the price. However, I really enjoyed seeing not only one \"option\", but whole sections of selections for pescatarians and vegetarians! Well done there. I had a Chai Latte which was good but a bit weak and lacking foam. Worth $4.50? No. I don't drink but you may want to check out the cocktails, the menu looked pretty tasty, and snuck in more Canadian classics (maple and screech!) I had the Northern Woods Mushroom Gnocci with mushroom bolognese, spinach, fried oyster mushrooms, and thunder oak gouda. This clever veggie dish could have fooled a meatatarian. I would have gone a little less on the spice for the mushroom bolognese, though. At one point what started as a nice heat became spices without the shroominess. The spinach wasn't overly wilted in the heat of the dish, which I appreciate. The gnocci were pillowy and soft, though admittedly the first I've ever tried. They reminded me of a fluffier version of kopytka, the Polish potato noodle. The stars of the dish were the fried spiced (sage? yes!) oyster mushrooms over top of the whole lot, which were absolutely delicious. And that is saying a lot considering I don't like straight mushroom in a bite. I also tried the bannock that came with my buddy's Ontario venison chili and it was like a deliciously herbed and buttery naan bread with sour cream for dipping. Silly me, I thought bannock was a type of grilled unleavened Scottish bread. Thank goodness the chef of Bannock thought otherwise! Also, btw, the \"Nasty Sauce\" on the menu is a scotch bonnet hot sauce. Be warned.

(Desserts)
Dessert was the best, apart from those delectable oyster mushies. I had the artisan butter tart (which does not include raisins, fyi). It was a sugary sweet mess served with berry coulis and whipped cream. So sweet that I recommend sharing. However, this tart had the most buttery melt-in-your-mouth non-greasy flakey crust that I have ever tasted in my life. I exchanged bites for the s'mores pie, perfectly toasted marshmallow halves atop a fluffy chocolatey brownie. The crust, oh the crust, and the heavenly s'mores brownie, are what will probably pull me back here again. Knowing the ingredients hail from my home and native land (though Michael Bonacini does not) make me that much prouder to be Canadian."}
{"text":"I'm in the minority here...I didn't like it at all! Although I usually prefer my food on the rare side (we're talkin' blue rare steak, carpaccio of all kinds, tartare, an absolute sashimi fiend) - the mussels were undercooked, even for me. To the point where some of the mussels had that telltale 'still alive' consistency. Was at dinner with a girlfriend though, so didn't want to be gross and spit it out at the time. Of course, My stomach paid the price afterwards!! (Sorry B, will just have to go with my GUT instinct next time. Har har har). My dining companion ordered the pizza margarita, which she found dry and lacked toppings and commented she preferred the same pizza at O&B's Canteen. The basil was also scarce - about two or three small leaves which were then torn into thirds to place atop five thin tomato slices. 
On the plus side though, the service was excellent and waitstaff were friendly and ready with smiles, always eager to make recommendations or ask if you need anything more. Excellent crew!"}
{"text":"Bannock, another great place owned by the O and B brand! 

This is a great affordable place attached to the bay with a good selection of items to choose from. The food reminds of items you can get from your moms kitchen. From macaroni and cheese, to kale Caesars to chicken pot pie. 

The service is on key, they are very helpful and quick with their service. I go at lunch all the time and they definitely work within my hour! 

The food is delicious, if you're having a bad day at work or need that pick me up of comfort food this is your go to place. 

Just watch out! The place is pretty small so it can get crowded. Try to make reservations if you're going at lunch, as they always get a rush. 

Food is great!! You can easily get a good meal for under 20.00 here."}
{"text":"Bannock has become an old stalwart for me when I want delicious comfort food with a twist. 

I've been here many times and have never been disappointed. Their burgers are done well and the accompanying root crisps are very tasty. I've also had their pulled  pork sandwich and their classic chicken pot pie. 

Save room for dessert, though - their warm s'mores pie is like eating an angel. IT'S THAT GOOD.

Great cocktail list, too! 

Bannock is a great place to take anyone visiting Toronto."}
{"text":"Visited last night ( Feb 4,2016) for Winterlicious with my wife. We tried 6 different dishes.
I had the Soup, Smoked Haddock  and Panna Cotta. My wife had the slaw, General Joel's Chicken and Chocolate cake. 

1. Service - impeccable. We were seated immediately and servers were super friendly and attentive.  I had to wait for water couple of times, no biggie.

- Apps

Soup - Superb. Flavorful and yummy. Would have it any day. add the in house hot sauce for some extra zing. yum!
Ten Vegetable Slaw  - plain.  All you can taste is cabbage. 

- Main

 * Haddock. - Not much on the smoked fish ( portion wise). both fish and hash were on the salty side. I have a feeling it was meant to be that way. 
* Chicken - SPICY! but good. Sauce was tasty but still felt missing something. batter on the chicken could have been more crispy. FWife complained of \"fishy\" taste to rice. I tried it and what i believe were the sunchokes did taste somewhat fishy.

- Desert

* Panna Cotta - nice portion and texture. flavor was bland though. I felt could have used more dizzle or the apple/cranberry garnish. I felt it needed to be a touch sweeter.
* Warm Sugar Beet and Chocolate Cake
Cake was excellent. Nice dark chocolate flavor and not too sweet. Beets were very interesting but pairing did not work for us. Beet flavor was strong and didn't pair well with the rich chocolate.

Overall, 
Service was amazing. 4.5*. took 1/2 off for not noticing water was empty at times.

Food - personally, did not stand out. presentation was nice but flavors were so-so. Soup was the exception. It definitely stood out and my wife was mad at me for suggesting she order the slaw."}
{"text":"Came here during Thanksgiving weekend and got their special. Nice atmosphere, friendly service and delicious food. Bannock exceeded my expectations - Can't wait to come back and try other things on their menu!"}
{"text":"LOVED IT!!! Had the duck poutine pizza and it was amazing. Tender duck (not gamey at all), beautiful ooey gooey cheese that can be stretched a foot high, caramelized onion, meaty but light gravy, and fresh rosemary to tie the beautiful marriage of flavours together. Highly recommended! And what's even better? Shocker - it's the turkey burger! This is the first time I've ordered a turkey burger as I've always shied away from fear of dryness and lack of flavour with turkey meat. But let me tell you, Oh em gee! This burger comes out looking quote unassuming. One bite says it all. This burger is full of flavour. From the crispy delicious onion ring to the dollop of fresh guacamole, to the star of the show - the turkey burger patty , which was literally dripping with juices. It was by far the juiciest, tastiest burger I've ever had. Can't believe I'm saying this about a turkey burger, but it was magical and credit is owed where it's due. Highly, HIGHLY recommended! Oh and the side of taro chips it comes with is pretty awesome too!"}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere... almost like your in a wooden cabin. Fits in excellent with the Canadian 'comfort-food' theme. I've had a few dishes here, the lobster roll, PEI mussels, & boneless back rib burger, all of which I'd recommend. The daily noodle however, is scarce - I've missed it all three visits. Alas, perhaps next time, as I will surely be going back."}
{"text":"Went for Sunday brunch- loved the menu, it was so hard to make a choice. 
Amongst the 3 of us we got: egg Benedict, steak and eggs and the vegetarian option (sandwich) 
Everyone enjoyed their meal, good portion size & good food
I absolutely LOVED their cocktail- the might Canuck! Sooo delish. 

All in all, good experience"}
{"text":"Great place. The food selection is great. Creative menu. Would recommend it. Gets very busy quickly so make a reservation and arrive on time!"}
{"text":"I went to Bannock for dinner on Thursday evening with a group of 3 people. I ordered the margherita pizza (pretty good, cheese was good quality and flavour was amazing), my friends ordered gnocchi and broccoli bacon salad. We all agreed that the price (around $20 for gnocchi and $14-$15 for the salad) does not match up the quality and amount of food you get. The pizza however, was pretty good in all aspects in my opinion.
The restaurant has a really good vibe and servers were helpful.
Considering the quality, price of food, the vibe and service, I would give this place 3 stars."}
{"text":"Disappointed, have been a regular patron ofBannock over past years. Margarita pizza was served warm and lacked taste. Calamari with rice lacked taste.

Washrooms were not well maintained. ( out of toilet paper and flush button was missing.

Date: September 16, 2017. Time: 6:30."}
{"text":"I came here after hearing rave reviews from a friend.
Service was great - our waitress was very helpful and patient.
We had the turkey burger and the chicken pot pie.
Turkey burger was the best one I've ever had! It was lettuce, tomatoes, an onion ring, and this amazing house made dill mayo. Also had a side of chips. Great burger - I highly recommend it!
Chicken pot pie was good but nothing too special. It came with some really good mashed potatoes and chicken gravy though, which I found tastier than the pot pie itself.
Will definitely come back to try the tourtiere!"}
{"text":"Came here with few friends to celebrate a birthday.  
We made reservations ahead of time so once I got there we got seated right away. They save 2 sides to the restaurant. 1 for dining and the other seemed like a take out / grab and go set up. The restaurant is undergoing some construction on the outside so it wasn't that easy to find the entrance. 
I ordered the duck poutine from the reviews and I'm
So glad I got it. It was so flavourful and huge portion! I could only finish half of it.  My friends ordered buyers that came with root chips. The chips are pretty unique but bland , we suggested they should serve it with a dip or sour cream. 
For my friends birthday we ordered the smore pie! It was sooooo good!! We split that and it was enough since everyone just wanted a bite. It came with a candle  and we sang happy birthday once it came. We asked if they could have decorate the plate with her name or happy birthday on it but sadly they said they don't do that.

The restaurant itself, it didn't look too nice in the dining area. I would expect it to have more of modern look and romantic ambience but that wasn't the case. Kind of felt like a Swiss chalet.  This restaurant attracts people from all ages. I saw a small child beside us, a date on the other table and a couple of seniors enjoying a bottle of wine."}
{"text":"Service was amazing, our server was very attentive and great.

The food portion sizes were very small, the \"comfort Mac and cheese\" wasn't the best, however they tried to improve with extra cheese...

Would recommend..."}
{"text":"Came here for summerlious tonight. The food was great! Excellent customer service.  They offered me to try another appetizer on the menu when they saw that I didn't finish a majority of mines (unfortunately, I wasn't a big fan of the ingredients in the other dishes too. So didn't take their offer. Sorry.) . They were being proactive of figuring out if something was wrong about the dish or if it was simply because it wasn't my thing, which is something I appreciated a lot! Keep up the good services!!"}
{"text":"This was my second time at Bannock as a year later I was still dreaming of the duck poutine pizza. I had it again (get one for the table, we splitting between 10 people as an appetizer) and it didn't disappoint. The duck was moist and fries were still a little crisp amidst the gravy and cheese curds.

I tried the octopus main as the waitress said it was amazing. While it was tasty enough, I wouldn't order it again as it was very little octopus and a lot of tomato sauce. The grains salad on the other hand was delicious. It had a melange of grains and some crisp vegetables in a light dressing. It was hearty without being heavy and totally enjoyable. I also had the beets in horseradish creme fresh which were a nice addition but probably not worth the up sell.

Now, I realize that when large groups go out there is a gratuity added to the bill. As I was in a bit of a rush, I didn't notice and tipped again. We then ran into problems as I tried to address this with the server as I wanted to redo the bill. Her attitude wasn't becoming lets just say and her comments of \"I thought I just did a really good job\" were not appreciated. It took me asking for the manager to get this all sorted and she took her sweet time getting back to us. When the bill is almost 1000 dollars and two people already tipped 30%, it would have been great if she just fixed it. I have to say, it left me with a bit of a bad taste in my mouth, despite all the good food."}
{"text":"What a great place, even though I have walked past here a number of times since settling here in Toronto I just never felt the need to in here.

My friend booked a reservation for a group of us and although a large group they very easily accommodated us all. Only downside was how long and many times I had to ask for my coffee.

I ordered the fried chicken with flapjacks. The chicken was tasty as hell and the maple syrup that came with the pancakes was soooo good. I am not sure if the mustard came with my dish or if it was for someone else's but i helped myself to it either way and again it just worked. 

The price I think was fair, didn't break the bank and the service was good, apart from the coffee wait."}
{"text":"We stopped into Bannock for a late lunch over the weekend and had no problem getting a table. The dining room was decked out for winter and the mix-matched pine wreaths were the perfect compliment for this oh-so-Canadiana decor.

We ordered the lobster roll & duck poutine pizza and we were impressed by both.
We even enjoyed watching the christmas shoppers come to and from The Bay, it felt especially wintery and we felt especially cozy -and Canadian."}
{"text":"The food and decor was excellent and not at all pretentious.  The service was also excellent.  It was a very relaxed atmosphere where friends can just hang out, drink and pig out on their delicious comfort food.  Their famous Duck Poutine Pizza is definitely a must try.  It was loaded up with poutine, but there were also enough chunks of duck on the pizza.  We also had the chicken pot pie with mash which was recommended. The filling was just perfect for my taste.  Then next up was the octopus dish.  The tentacles was very tender and flavourful; it wasn't chewy at all. The chorizo pizza was okay but I think I would've prefered another Duck Poutine Pizza!"}
{"text":"I'm glad I got to finally experience Bannock especially during Summerlicious. 

I had the field tomato + stone fruit appetizer. It was a very delicious base, but could use more tomato. I frankly didn't enjoy the nectarines as they weren't ripe enough. It truly was a summer salad and was definitely refreshing. 

The fresh egg fettuccine was quite delicious. Very well balanced, with different flavours in every bite. It tasted good and went really well with the appetizer and dessert. 

I picked the Niagara fruit + whipped cream dessert plate. I love the way it was presented, but again those pesky nectarines got in the way. 

For $28 you're getting a pretty decent meal, and amazing service. I seriously have to applaud the staff. 

My tip to the restaurant would be to upgrade the washrooms, and to not add too much ice to the mixed drinks."}
{"text":"We love Bannock! Everything we had here on a cold evening was so warming and comforting. Their bannocks really took the cake, and the butter tart added to the delicious Canadian traditional tastes. Service was attentive and prompt.

Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Good food, very nice wines, excellent decor and great spot for a chat over dinner on a Thursday night. My sis and I shared the grain salad and duck poutine pizza; she had a Pinot Grigio, and I had the other red wine our server recommended (tastier than the Malbec for 50 cents more). 

The sprout salad was delicious and I felt like a health nut after eating half of it. The duck poutine pizza was also delicious although a lot heavier on the potato and lighter on the duck. I've never been a big fan of poutine but I ate half of what was quite a large crisp flatbread filled with curds and some nice gravy/sauce. I did not feel like a health nut after this one...more like I seem to have gained a healthier butt. 

A couple of criticisms: the restaurant is too smoky, particularly through the open concept kitchen. I hate walking out of a nice meal smelling like dinner the rest of the evening. Servers were extremely friendly and knowledgeable about the wine list, however, they didn't clear our salad plate until we were almost though eating the behemoth of a poutine pizza we had, and my first glass of downed water wasn't filled until the room quieted down a bit. Slight but important (to me) oversights while at the height of busy time during dinner service. 

Good overall. I'd like to try the rest of the bannocks and pizzas next time around, especially after a long after work shopping session."}
{"text":"?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? (catfish) ??????????"}
{"text":"Still don't know what Canadian comfort food means. 

The grilled octopus was great! Do octopuses live this far north? Where do they import them from?"}
{"text":"Here's the thousandth review on the duck poutine pizza! 
It had the perfect ratio of fattening sauce to fries to duck. 
Served pretty quick but they didn't cut it. This made for a difficult share since the crust is hard to cut with a steak knife. 
But the portion is pretty big. Enough for 3 people to be well fed. 

The white wood faced walls are quite nice. 
Oh! And the server was quick and attentive."}
{"text":"I walked pass Bannock countless times when I am downtown so I made an effort to stop by and I wasn't disappointed.  The roast duck poutine pizza ($16) is the real deal here and it is pretty big (can feed 3 people).  As with all the other O&B places you can expect good service and above average pricing but always worth it.  I also got the Cesar salad ($8) and it was very good as well.  

The S'more pie looked amazing but I was too stuffed to have anymore.  I will def come back next time and order it for sure.

{"text":"I went to this restaurant on the corner of Bay and Queen to check out the Winterlicious 2014 menu. First off, it has a great relaxed atmosphere with an inviting (if sometimes way too loud) feel and comfortable seating and decor.
My guest and I decided to order different dishes for each course eat half and switch (the best way to do things!) For the first course we had a kale Caesar salad with shrimp and croutons, and a black barley and piccalilli salad. The Caesar was good and pretty standard (if a little over seasoned) except for the addition of the shrimp. This was an interesting change. The barley salad also suffered a little from intense seasoning with a 'dukkah spice' covering a layer of broccoli and cauliflower being a little too overpowering. The barley itself was light and paired well with a layer of sugar beet hummus on the bottom.
For the second course we had both a gnocchi 'fauxlognese' and a pressed pork shoulder on a bed of simmered cabbage. The fauxlognese referred to a fake bolognese sauce that used mushrooms to replace the meat. It was inventive and tasty. The mushrooms gave this sauce a taste similar, but unlike a meat sauce and it was delicious when paired with whole mushrooms in the dish, soft delicious gnocchi (with Gouda!), and spinach. However, the pork shoulder was almost a complete letdown for me. The pork shoulder itself was fine and was nice and soft for such a tough cut, but the sour and unappetizing cabbage and tomato base left me pretty uninspired. I ate some pork and after a few bites gave up on the cabbage and sort of just pushed it around on the plate.
Finally, for dessert we tried a sticky bannoffee cake and the cheesy chocolate cannoli. Unlike the previous two courses there was no disappointment here. The sticky cake was a banana bread spiced muffin covered with caramel and cr√®me fra√Æche. This combination was rich, warm and homey with the cr√®me fra√Æche giving it a little bite. The cannolis were also great. The chocolate filling was a little heavier that I'm used to in a cannoli, but it was tasty and rich. It was covered in a layer of chocolate sauce and peanut brittle that put this thing over the top. Intense rich stuff.
There were some pretty strong flavours through the evening, not all of them pleasant or enjoyable, but some of them great. I think I might possibly be being a little hard on this restaurant because of my high expectations going in, but I'm going to be a little hard and go with a 3 rather than a 4. I'll definitely be giving this one a second chance during non-Winterlicious season however."}
{"text":"I've been to bannock 5 times in the past and had good experiences with the food and service. Today I came for dinner with my mom and we noticed that there was an increase in the price of the food. We took that with a bit of apprehension, but we liked the food previously, so we stayed. We started with a spinach and walnut salad. This dish was super sour and it was not listed on the menu that it came with super pickled vegetable. The waitress asked us if it was ok and I said it was ok out of politeness. After having 2 more bites, my mom said it was unbearably sour, so she called the waitress over to complain. The waitress simply walked away with the salad without saying anything for the rest of our meal. We received our mains promptly, I ordered the mushroom gnocchi and my mom had the chicken Piri Piri. The dishes were tasty, but they were small portions and honestly, not worth it for the money. The waitress did not check up on us about our mains. When we asked for our bill, she informed us that she could not take the salad off the bill because too much was eaten (as her manager said). For the record, only 3-4 votes were taken. I would've been ok with this if she told us soon after we complained about the dish, but to ignore us for the rest of the meal was unacceptable. It left us with bitter taste in our mouths. We will not return because the food is not worth the money and the rude service."}
{"text":"I had my reservations about poutine pizza but it really surprised me in a very delicious way. Corn bread is a must. Although i'm not sure if I liked their chicken pot pie which is also one of their signature items. 

The service was impeccable. We were so glad that we found this restaurant. Classic comforting food with a twist. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"My late dinner date with my gal was delicious. I had the BLT w fries and she had the turkey burger sweet potatoes fries. The 'B'  in my BLT is chunks of meaty pork belly. It's was really yummy.

We joined a full & vibrant restaurant of people already very engaged in their own table of animated conversations. So the restaurant vibe was just the right fit for our day of exploring & catching up. 

Then, the dinner topped our ladies only day that was mostly spent in the Distillery District. It was a  decadent day; quality time with a friend I haven't seen in a very long time.

The staff was friendly, and decor simple nonetheless a good restaurant pick for a night downtown."}
{"text":"O Bannock!

grilled alberta lamb rump...shake that rump... 
 

\"Truthfully, I think the city is saturated with Oliver & Bonacini restaurants...\"  D√©j√† vu?  That's because it is...remember Canteen.

Last night I went to number eight.  It's been open for about 3 weeks.  It's \"Canadian comfort food\".  And they called it Bannock.  

...

My guess is that somewhere in the O&B hierarchy, someone thought using the Old English word for flat bread was truly Canadian because it was \"brought to Canada through Scottish explorers and traders...\".  I must have skipped that lesson during social studies.  That's right, in West Coast Canada, \"history\" is \"social studies\".  Gawd I don't miss high school at all.  

The reviews for Bannock so far are so bad...although not here.  Yelpers seem to like it.  I don't disagree.  The food was good and flavourful.

Yes, there is a BUT in there.

Regardless of the bad reviews when my friend Aerie suggested Bannock, I was down.  I get down with anything, at least once.  And I'm always down for meeting with Aerie.  Always.

We bantered over cocktails (mighty canuck tastier than hbc) and ban-uhk.  Not literally, because they didn't sound appealing. 

There were many things I liked (and many things I could have done without).  I'll start with the good.  I like the concept: easy to-go counter cafe meets casual dining.  I also appreciate that they use Canadian ingredients, like PEI mussels, BC albacore tuna, etc.

Now on to the stuff that could lead a bad review, if this were one, which it's not...quite.  Not everything on the menu sounds good.  And in my opinion, a lot of things are just set up to fail.  Take the lobster roll - Aerie and I both wondered why they would do one.  Good lobster rolls are few and far between and I doubt that Toronto is the best place place to throw one down.  Other things just sound wholly unappetizing.  For example, the table next to us ordered the roast duck poutine pizza.  Now don't get me wrong, I love duck.  I love poutine.  I love pizza.  I love duck poutine and I love duck pizza.  But duck poutine piza?  I'll pass.  Too too much isn't always so very very good. 

Service was great - friendly and attentive. Kitchen was not.  Open concept means I can see where the hold up is. Our food took a long time.  There were extended delays.  Not sure what was going on because the tables weren't full.  I will let it go.  They knew it.  They apologized for it.  I'm over it.

Overall, the food shows promise.  Aerie and I shared a poutine.  Just poutine, because we love poutine. It wasn't Top 10 material, but it was still very good, even with chicken gravy.

Then we shared the grilled Alberta lamp rump and St. Canut pulled pork tourti√®re.  While lamb is self-explanatory, tourti√®re  may not be.  Allow me, it's a meat pie from Quebec and is traditionally minced.  Why then does Bannock call it pulled pork.  Misleading but good.  The honeyed root veggies too.  As for the packet of Heinz ketchup; I think it was intended to be fun and whimsical.  I thought it was lame.

The lamb was really delicious.  I could have skipped the prairie grain pilaf, only because it tasted so very healthy.  I wanted mashed potatoes or risotto.  I don't do well with whole grains.

Aerie and I got some sugar to go. I had the sour cream donuts.  Shocker.  Y'all know I have a problem with donuts.  

Aerie liked her butter tart.  She said the puff pastry crust was an nice surprise from the usual shortcut pastry.  She also liked the flavour.  I trust Aerie.  So should you.

How were my donuts you ask?  They tasted better than they look.

Overpriced at $8 and definitely won't make Toronto Life's best donut list, but I would like the sauce.  Anyday, everyday, everywhere.  I think it was dulce de leche.  So heavenly.

Well this was definitely one of my longer reviews.  I needed to take it all in and sleep on it.  This is what came out.  My final answer?  I would go again.  But not for dinner.

I would go again for lunch. Final answer."}
{"text":"I was intrigued by the concept for this restaurant, a place that serves Canadian cuisine. Hmm how does one capture the essence of Canadian take on food as the major cities are so cosmopolitan now its hard to pin point what that city is famous for. Sure there are pockets of ethnicity but unlike the countries of yore there aren't any cities I can think off that are famous for a particular dish (Montreal Smoked Meat  and bagels or Nanaimo bars are an Exception) 
There are regional mainstream unique dishes like poutine from Quebec, Items that can't be categorized as unique to a region like fresh seafood items from BC ,  lobster from the Atlantic provinces . Then there are the somewhat acquired taste items like prairie oysters, flipper pies in the Atlantic to sustenance food in the North (some of those are too much even for an adventurous eater). Canada a small country in terms of population offers a vast geography that makes for an interesting contrast in food philosophy as it is an abstract of ingredient focus and technique based in terms of cuisine. 
With such a wide canvas to come up with a menu here, O&B have left a lot to be desired in my opinion. Sure there is bannock bread and some signature dishes of poutine and a butter tart for 8$ (gasp) 
Give me some authentic regional dishes rather than a mainstream attempt at them, most of the menu items consist of common dishes with a twist of somewhat Canadian item. 
Anyway on to the main I ordered a Roast Duck and Poutine pizza after going through the whole menu as it was a combo of two items I enjoy. 
Beer selection was limited as they had Kieth, Mill Street, Labatt 50 and an another beer  (if you are going for a clich√© might as well offer Molson Canadian!) I ended up with Labatt 50. Again give me some of the amazing beers Canada has to offer like La Fin Du Monde, Maudite (or most Unibrue gems for that matter), Dieu Du Ciel Line of beers, Dominus Vobiscum line of beers etc etc 
Anyway the Pizza arrived quickly. Initial impression was nothing special just a hodge podge of gooey stuff thrown on a pizza. Unfortunately the taste wasn't much of a departure from anything one might get from the California Pizza Chicken (CPK) chain of restaurants in US or dare I say CPK frozen offerings. 
The duck was being overwhelmed by the gravy and fries. The cheese curds were replaced by melted cheese and the fries were soggy. The meat had a salty finish that lingered well after dinner. I did enjoy the caramelized onions though. 
Service was prompt and quick so Kudos for that. 
I don't think I am being overly harsh in giving this place 2 stars. To be fair though I will revisit with perhaps a larger group as to try some other dishes and form a better opinion. update have revisited and tried a few other dishes rating still stands as 2 star."}
{"text":"Popped in here for dinner the other night. At first I wondered if I had the place wrong, because all I could see was takeout, but then I took one second to look to my left and saw the dining area. You can see right into the Bay, which I found a bit weird, but c'est la vie.

The menu had many bread-based and other  heavy options. Come here hungry! For some reason, I chose the pad thai over the Canadian options, but hey -- that's what I felt like. My companion had the venison stew, which our waitress said was named one of the \"top 25 meat dishes in Toronto\" (no word on who conducted that survey). He liked it, but said you couldn't really tell it was venison. My pad thai was fantastic. I really enjoyed it. 

The wine list was really great. Their house wine is from Cave Springs (YUM!). I had the red, and I loved it. As well, the service was fantastic. I just can't see making this my regular spot given the heaviness of the majority of their offerings."}
{"text":"Popped in here for an early pre-opera dinner with my lovely mother. We informed the waitress that we were in a rush, and she was very gracious, and assured us that this would not be a problem.

I ordered the the BLT sandwich ($13) which was good. Served with pork belly instead of bacon, it was a fatty choice, but fatty often equals delicious, no? My only quibble? It was served with a small side of root veggie chips, which were not that great.

My mom ordered the chicken pot pie ($16), and it was DELICIOUS. She won the ordering battle on that one.

Service was fast, and we were out in the required time.

All in all a good experience. Food was executed well. Prices were ok. It wasn't out of this world, but I would go back and give it another chance when we have more time."}
{"text":"I went here for brunch during weekend and had peaneal griddled crumpet. It was pretty busy and it took around 30 mins to get the food we ordered. The peameal bacon tastes great! The beans tasted like just ketchup and sweet tho. Overall, great try!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with my boyfriend and had extremely good service from our waiter, who was very knowledgeable of the menu items, and also knew how to be attentive without being intrusive. On our second visit, the waitress was less skilled BUT was nonetheless very polite and helpful. In terms of food, we ordered the duck poutine pizza, and also the tofurkey and quinoa. I was pleasantly surprised withe tofurkey dish because my expectations for it were fairly low (I ordered it because I felt like being healthy that day). But surprisingly the quinoa which I am typically very indifferent towards was very well flavoured and since it's cool, and has some sort of fruit sauce (don't remember), it was very refreshing to eat! Tofurkey was alright, but then again my expectations for tofu are quite high since I'm Chinese, and we have some awesome tofu dishes. Now onto the poutine pizza. It was sooo good, but I do recommend sharing it between two people. I find that since the duck, gravy and cheese in the dish all lean towards the savoury side of things, if you try to eat the whole thing it will be pretty overwhelming, and you may even get tired of it. I found that the pizza was just right when I shared it with the boyfriend, and is a dish that I would probably go back for every now and then.

Also, my bf ordered a gin and tonic, and the bartender was extremely generous with the alcohol, since the drink was quite dry, yet the price of the drink was still very reasonable for $5. Kudos for not skimping on the alcohol like some other restaurants may! I also tried their caramel macchiato, and it was good but can't see it's exceptional. at 3.25 ish for a cup, I see just drop by starbucks next door or something! Overall in terms of food quality, this place is more of a 3.5, but I think the exceptional service I've experienced in my first visit is sufficient to  push it up to a 4 star for me. =)"}
{"text":"I thought if there was ever a place to try bannock for the first time, it should be at Bannock.

I got the BLT bannock ($14). For the price I paid, the portions were more than disappointing. It was the size of a pita with a few potato chips on the side. 

That said, the thick slab of bacon was great. It was more of a 'pork belly' than a crispy bacon. I think they called it \"Canoe Bacon\"; not sure what that meant, but perhaps it was prepared in a manner served at another O&B restaurant, Canoe. 

It's definitely a bustling place on the weekend. I like the concept of serving comfort food, but I think the dishes as a whole were a little overpriced for the portion sizes. Some of the ingredients may be good, but the foods don't seem to take a lot of time to prepare (think pizza and salads, but slightly fancier)."}
{"text":"I had the Pei mussels in curry with Bannock while my partner got the poutine pizza. My dish was amazing. Juicy mussels and bannock was perfect. I've never had such good mussels. Definitely recommend. The curry is a little sweeter than what I usually have, but its still decent. The pizza was alright . I was just snagging the crust from my partners plate. Service was very good and atmosphere is cozy. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"BRUNCH. So good. Fried chicken and flapjacks were sweet, salty and crunchy. Yum! 
Smoked salmon and eggs were yummy too. the presentation is lovely! Best part of all brunch was super affordable. Great value!!"}
{"text":"What's Canadian food?  I haven't a clue.  I came here to find out.

I had the soup of the day, a creamy mushroom soup.  It was really good.  Very mushroomy.

I also had the bannock blt.  The thick cut bacon was moist and flavourful.  There were four large taro chips that came on the side.

It was good, but it didn't really have a \"wow\" factor.  

Oh, the server was on the ball.  I like efficiency and with a smile."}
{"text":"Good service, really heavy food, n healthy options, but our group of five had no complaints. Impressive cocktails."}
{"text":"Great place for us Toronto first timers. The service and management team were excellent. Within my party of seven we tried just about everything and nothing disappointed. The octopus dish was great as was the poutine! Would I go back again? Sure!"}
{"text":"This place is hopping for a Wednesday night. Service was so friendly and lovely, and quite fast for a busy night! Food was delicious and flavourful, and they have a greAt selection of wines to pair w the meals and a relatively good beer selection. Location is very central w A variety Of ttc options to get to it. It's a cozy interior, w nice benches and tables to sit at. Food is exactly what it says on the sign-\"Canadian comfort food\" at it's best. I give food four stars only because I asked for medium rare steak and got a very rare one, it was still pretty good. My bf got a roti which was delicious, I think id rather get that next time for sure."}
{"text":"this review reflects my experience in nov 2013. i initially got a warm vibe when i went to dine here in a dinner party for two. our server's name is marcel, so so friendly, made really great suggestions, and offered timely service. 

we ended up ordering duck poutine pizza and the bannock cheeseburger, and it was more than enough for two people. it felt like it was a special occasion, cause at the end of our meal, we were served up a dessert sm√∂rg√•sbord that included the following: warm s'mores pie + sour cream beignets with dulce de leche + ice cream and sorbet served with a mixed berry compote. i wish i could pick a favourite, but i love my sweets too much to pick just one. 

i'd definitely go back to try their other menu items!"}
{"text":"Last night, we went to Bannock to celebrate two birthdays.  We had made a reservation for the harvest table specifically, but when we arrived, it had been mistakenly given away to another party.  This was quite disheartening because we had our hearts set on the social experience of a harvest table, and the table seating did not have the ambiance we were seeking.  Seeing our upset, the Bannock staff speedily prepared a makeshift harvest table set up for us, complete with towering candles and decor.  They also gave us two complimentary bottles of bubbly, a ton of delicious appetizers and two beautiful dessert boards.  The sorbet was the best I have ever had!  A restaurant can best be evaluated on their ability to troubleshoot and deliver a noteworthy experience despite adversity.  Our birthday boys had a lovely and delicious evening, and I am very thankful to the Bannock staff for their hard work to deliver a speedy remedy along with extensive compensation.  The manager (Norvis) was very gracious and resourceful. Our server was Ashley and she was funny and awesome - even getting me an alternate dinner option (the tacos are a must!) when I wasn't crazy about what I had originally ordered.  I was very, very impressed by the service and quality of food, and will certainly be returning.  Congratulations on such a great restaurant!"}
{"text":"I came here recently for a weekday lunch and had a great experience. The servers were friendly, the food was fresh, and the prices were reasonable. 

The awesomeness:
- their bannocos were perfect for lunch for me. I'm not a big eater so I was looking for something light that wasn't a salad. two tacos and a refreshing cucumber apple salad totally hit the spot. The tacos had a great balance of textures and flavours and was only messy to the point where you'd just laugh (as opposed to messy to the point where you're frustrated... I can't be the only person to have experience that before...)
- their specials are on point! My friends ordered the brunch special (a fricassee that came with a balance of meat, eggs, and fresh greens) and it came heaping on a plate. The portions for them put a big smile on their faces.

The not-so-awesomeness:
- the server advertised a few fresh juices, so my friends picked the maple lemonade, and I went for the strawberry lemonade. Someone later came back to tell me that they were all out of the strawberry lemondade (it was 11:30am). I was a sad panda. 
- I ordered the cream of mushroom soup (my absolute favourite thing on any O&B menu). While this one was just as tasty, it was super duper thick and reminded me of a soup that's been on a pot for a loooong time. Flavour wise it was still good but texture wise it made me feel as though it wasn't very fresh.

Our server was fantastic, she checked up on us often and my water was never past half-empty. As we were about to leave, they called after us as a friend forgot his glasses on the table (again showing how they're always on the ball with service). The place is a great lunch spot and I'd gladly come again."}
{"text":"Went for Sunday brunch.  5 minute wait, not bad for brunch in Toronto.  

Seats were comfortable.  Room was full, but volume level was low.  Coffee was very good, but the star was the Caesar, which was delicious.  Food was really good, but my dining companion didn't get eggs on his great Canadian breakfast, and had to ask where they were (they'd been forgotten).  Service was good.  Expensive overall, but that's brunch downtown for ya.  I'd go back for sure!"}
{"text":"Went here yesterday for a Summerlicious lunch with some co-workers. I love that I was able to reserve via OpenTable. Why get on the phone and talk to someone when you can click buttons at your computer? No problems with the reservation... we had a big corner table saved for the 5 of us. 

It's one of the cheapest lunch options for Summerlicious, only $15. Salted beets for app was good but not particularly memorable. Entree was a fish pie which was delicious -- very very rich and heavy. Three of us ordered it and no one was able to finish it. The pie comes with a very rich and buttery puff pastry on top. So good. 

I had no room for croissant bread pudding for dessert and changed it to ice cream/sorbet. It was all just as well because they had just run out of bread pudding and we would have had to wait another 15 minutes. 

Our server was quite friendly. Service was fast which was good because we got to get back to work on time."}
{"text":"I walked by this restaurant many times and stopped in my tracks by the enticing aroma permeating from within. I finally tried it and WOW! The food is spectacular. 

We had a veggie bannock--which is just a sandwich. Although I know what a bannock is and realize the bread from the sandwich is \"the bannock\", I was expecting a type of pot pie. Still, it was a really delicious sandwich! We also had the tofurkey cutlet which was AMAZING. It is not the brand Tofurky sold in grocery stores, for you vegetarian savvy out there. It's just tofu. It's not breaded (thank goodness) but is smothered with mozzarella cheese--admittedly a first for me after 21 years of being meat-free [note, I started very young; I am not very old]. It is served with the most delicate quinoa and a very strong salsa which I think was loaded with horseradish. I hate horseradish but totally finished this! Alone, each component was good but together it was a magical symphony. The chef is a genius.

The sweet potato fries deserve their own separate paragraph. They are the BEST SWEET POTATO FRIES in Toronto!!!!! First, they are the perfect french fry shape. They are long rectangles--not shoestrings or tiny little nubs that you can find at other restaurants in the city. Second, they are fried to perfection. Third, they are fried with herbs which gives them an amazing flavour; not to mention the fried herbs are pretty tasty. Fourth, they are generously sprinkled with high quality sea salt. Fifth, they are served with a spicy mayo that has a real zing. Again, each component is good on its own but together they create magic.

On the downside, it was a little pricey. Overall, the price of the meals weren't bad but the portions were a bit small for the price. So, I have concluded this must be one of those high-end restaurants. :) The sweet potato fries however are perfectly priced.

The decor is breathtaking. Very rustic and industrial. I found myself really looking at the architecture and appreciating the time spent on every detail. They also have take away for lunch, which is great for people who work in the area."}
{"text":"Food was definitely comforting. We enjoyed everything we ordered. Corn bread was so creamy and sweetened perfectly. The atmosphere was good and the service was excellent. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I was recently at an event at the Arcadian Court that was catered by Bannock. The food was incredible and the employees went above and beyond to accommodate my dietary restrictions. 

Our first course was a Butter Lettuce and Brebiac Salad with eggplant, brioche, garlic and chives. The waiters were so kind to bring me a dish that was both gluten and dairy free. My salad tasted fantastic and I really enjoyed it. 

The main course was a Marjoram scented chicken supreme featuring spinach, potatoes, grilled zucchini & fennel, lemon & basil concass√©, and a mustard Chardonnay jus. They omitted some ingredients off my dish, but it tasted fantastic. The chicken was very tender and it melted in my mouth. The flavour was also very decadent and I really enjoyed this dish.

The main dessert was an O&B Artisan Pecan Pie. I really wasn't expecting to be able to eat dessert but the waiters surprised me with a candied apricot crumble and wild blueberries topped with a lemon sorbet. This dessert tasted amazing! I wish I would be able to recreate it at home but I don't remember everything that was in my dish. 

Our meal was fantastic and I would highly recommend dining in, taking out or getting any event catered by Bannock."}
{"text":"Full disclosure: I'm a fan of O&B establishments. I've always enjoyed the food, and the service is always impeccable. 

I've been to Bannock a few times now and have never had a bad experience. They're all about Canadian comfort food classics and they refresh their menus every so often. However, some of the menu mainstays I've enjoyed include:

Duck Poutine Pizza - great for sharing with friends and seriously who's not a fan of delicious poutine on pizza. Expect to be in a carb coma after devouring this meal.

Chicken pot pie - warm, hearty, total comfort food, especially with the mashed potatoes on the side. It's a satisying meal on a cold winter day.

Cheeseburger - brisket burger, topped with a light-dressed slaw that cuts through the heaviness of the meat. I love the roots chips served on the side, but you can opt for another side if you prefer.

S'mores pie - Do I really need to say much? Check out one of the pictures and you'll know. 

My most recent visit to Bannock was with a friend who has very particular dietary restrictions. We must have asked our server to confirm/re-confirm ingredients in dishes a dozen times, and she was patient and attentive through all of it."}
{"text":"Think of bannock as Canadian comfort food.  Mac + cheese, hearty soups and sandwiches, pizzas, venison+rabbit, pot pies etc.  They also have a cafe area where you can get treats, sandwiches and salads to go and coffee.

There are healthy options on the menu but you'll be hard pressed to order it when seeing the other choices.  Unfortunatley, the food itself is just mediocre, which I have become accustomed to at most O&B chains.  I do suggest trying the duck poutine pizza, but do not suggest ordering this for yourself, unless you feel like you want to eat 2 days worth of calorie intake in one meal.  This is essentially a mountain of poutine with duck meat, curds and fries on top of pizza crust.  It's literally overwhelming, but hits the \"little fat man in me\" spot.  I don't need to have another one...  They do have a \"nasty sauce\" option that is intriguing, however.

I'd return to bannock as a good, quick, sit-down lunch option."}
{"text":"Bannock is my favorite place for lunch in the downtown area. 
The food and service are top notch, despite the fact that its ALWAYS busy. 
The turkey burger is the best I've ever had...so juicy.
Chicken pot pie is filling and delicious, with the little side of mashed potatos and gravy. 
Have yet to have a bad meal here."}
{"text":"My friend and I came to Bannock for summerlicious and I personally expected a lot after reading Yelp reviews and knowing it was one of the restaurants under the O&B line.

For appetizers, I started off with the soup. I'm still not used to the cold soup offerings but the taste was definitely clean and refreshing.

For our main course we both ordered the pizza because I heard it was great. Again it was good but not what I expected. I would definitely say this pizza tried to be as simple as possible. The meat was sweet but I loved the nice onions.

Dessert- i believed mine was the frozen yogurt which was meh. My friend ordered the caramel something ( sorry I forgot the name :( ) but it was disgustingly sweet


Overall ambience was nice. Did feel a bit rushed at the end maybe it was because dinner was about to start."}
{"text":"I was out for a walk on a gloomy Labour Day and happened across Bannock.  I knew it was under construction but had no idea it had already opened.  Feeling hungry and willing to try something new, I ventured in for a quick lunch.  

As you enter you are greeted by a very attractive and amicable hostess.  I was dining solo so she was kind enough to provide me with a newspaper to read while I dined.  

The decor is pretty classic O&B.  Inoffensive and safe, but the room still had some warmth to it.  

I opted for the pickerel tacos, which are not typical tacos as the \"shell\" seems like it's actually bread which has been slightly folded to hold the filling of pickerel, caviar tartar and what I assumed was some julienned apple.  It comes with a small salad of cucumber and apple as well.  This should be a hit dish for the financial district crowd at lunch.  Simple, clean and tasty.

For dessert, I couldn't resist the S'More Pie.  It's a small rectangular chocolate pie with a thin graham cracker crumble on the bottom and four perfectly roasted and gooey marshmallows on top.  It comes with a side of raspberry sauce which is really unneeded, in my view.  It was a bit smaller than I thought it'd be but packed a lot of flavour into that little square.  Next time I'll try the sour cream donuts.

Overall, it's what I've come to expect from O&B.  Very good food, professional service and decent ambience.  I'm sure this place will pack in the peeps day-in, day-out."}
{"text":"I'm giving this the full month of stars due to two things - service and tofu.

1st Service - this is a restaurant that does not get freaked out by a lone diner. I'm traveling on business so after a day of meetings I'm thrilled to b finding alone. Bannock didn't stick me in the dark corner and didn't ignore me thinking I was waiting for someone else. They also offered me reading material should I need it! In short, they made this lone diner feel very comfortable.

2nd Tofu - on the menu was tofurkey scalloponi, I asked whether it was the dreaded branded tofurkey but was told it was house made so I ordered it. What came out was a lovely slab of tofu covered with marinara sauce and mozzarella cheese melted on top. It was served on a bad made up of three furrows of quinoa, wilted salad and a fantastic squash with mustard concoction.

I didn't get my server's name - he is also a flight attendant - but he was just perfect.

UPDATE: visited again tonight and the rating remains. Mushroom gnocchi and roasted beets...I cleaned my plate. My server Marcel was super sweet and the hostess remembered me! Wish I was here for a third night!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of O&B and comfort food and poutine! Of course I had to come to this place! Had to order the roast duck poutine pizza since I'm a poutine fanatic. When it came it looked delicious with lots of fries on the pizza. Unfortunately I found that the duck sauce didn't really go that well with the poutine. I guess I like my poutine salty. 

For desserts I tried the s'mores pie and donut and they were divine. Ultimate comfort food for sure! It was very rich and flavourful and had great texture. Overall the atmosphere was great and the staff was awesome. The place might look not too great on the outside and close parking might be harder to find. I guess I will just stick to the original poutine."}
{"text":"I would've given Bannock a 4 if it weren't for the following:
- went there with co-workers for lunch around noon on a weekday, it wasn't very busy yet the hostess asked us if we would be okay with getting seated at a high top table. All four of us are between 5' and 5'2... seating at a high top table with our legs dangling all meal seemed ridiculous, especially since the place was half empty. When I asked her again if she had seating at a normal table for 4, she glanced at her sheet and said she actually did so we got seated there. No idea why they would try to give us uncomfortable seating as the first option?! made me feel unwelcome
- heard a LOT about the duck poutine pizza, the fries were a little cold and tasted frozen not fresh, the duck was delish but the pizza bread was awful... it was an arm workout to cut it with the knife they provided


Pro's:
- my friend ordered the mushroom pizza, it was delicious, same issue with the bread being difficult to slice but the mushrooms were super fresh
- reasonably priced
- service was attentive
- one of my friend's meals was the last to arrive, after we all received ours, so they gave her a complimentary soup which was really thoughtful"}
{"text":"I was a bit disappointed with Bannock, since I always enjoyed  Oliver & Bonacini and Canteen food, and thought it would be the same standard.  Reading everyone else's wonderful reviews made me think that my experience could have been a fluke, who knows?  The atmosphere was the only thing that was positive tonight, other than that, the food was mediocre and full of salt.   I got the Chicken Pot Pie and Mash Potato, your everyday comfort food.  The mash potato and gravy was alright, but the Chicken Pot Pie was soupy, not much content except alot of peas, and super salty! I drank almost a gallon of water to wash away the salt :(  My friend got the Roast Duck Poutine Pizza, which according to the server - this is the \"It\" dish is flying off the counter.  When she got her dish, seriously it looked like a three year old put together the dish. It was a piece of Bannock with cheese and torn duck piece, plus a pile of fries on top and gravy to top it off. It sure is exactly what the dish name is....Roast Duck Poutine Pizza + .super salt. My other friend ordered the Grilled vegetable bannock. This was semi-acceptable, the grill veggies were tasty but as she got to the end, oil was dripping from the sandwich and the chips on the side were creating a oil puddle of its own. Having had such a salty meal, we attempted to balance it off with the S'mores Pie. It was ok, but unfortunately didn't balance our meal, and left a heavy chocolate sauce feeling meshed with salt in our stomach.   Maybe it was a fluke or because it is fairly new, I only hope they can catch up to the other O&B standards soon.  I think I need another glass of water now....."}
{"text":"Well i were quite disappointed about the restaurant. The quality of the food is not bad but it is quite overprice. We order duck fat poutine as appetizer. It  was good but it charges 12 dollars for a very small portion. Overprice!
Cheeseburger is 19 dollars but with a very small portion of taro chips. I don't think It worthy of the price.
The star of night is Grilled octopus. It is cooked perfectly. I guess maybe I will return during summerlicous  to give it another try."}
{"text":"Bring back the prairie grain salad!!!"}
{"text":"Great surprise! Heard a lot of good things about their mac and cheese, and it definitely did not disappoint! The sweet potato fries were also surprisingly delicious. Besides the food, we were greeted with excellent service and a comfortable environment. I'll definitely be back here again"}
{"text":"Had the sticky ribs and their turkey burger. Apparently the waiter had mention that the turkey burger was voted as toronto's best turkey burger. Agreed the burger was really delicious. However the bun was a little too crispy making it difficult to eat. You can also get the burger bunless if you prefer. 

The price was average for a decent size restaurant. Worth a try if you are near by Eaton centre or the Bay."}
{"text":"Great brunch, the fried chicken and flapjacks are delicious.  Service is friendly and quick.  We're just visiting Toronto and are here twice, loved it!"}
{"text":"Came here for a team lunch on a Friday and despite reservations and everyone arriving on time, the service was very slow. It took us an hour to receive our entrees and our apps arrived after everyone had nearly finished their meals. The restaurant itself was really cozy with the dimmed lighting and modern but edgy decor. Despite the hustle and bustle that connected the restaurant to Eaton Centre, and the open concept kitchen our stay still felt very intimate. Even with the construction going on out front, the restaurant itself was fairly easy to access. I ordered the Bannock Bannock which was their house-smoked salmon with onion, cumin and cream cheese. I love salt as much as salt bae, but man was the smoked salmon heavy on salt. It was beyond the taste of smoked, it was just bloat in a pita. Unfortunately two glasses of water later and a lot of self convincing, I still couldn't finish my plate. I really wanted to like Bannock but will likely not return anytime soon."}
{"text":"The manager followed up with a phone call and apologized. As well I was offered a complimentary brunch for 2. Sorry I forgot to update that info.

My two girl friends and I came back today and brunch was delicious and customer service was great!

O&B restaurants will continue to be my favourites in the city."}
{"text":"I have to give them credit for the Canadian inspired menu, they are really trying to mesh together Canadian fare and this is something that those visiting the city are looking for.

We got the poutine as an app, I got the green Mac and cheese and my husband got the woods mushroom and gnocchi dish. None were incredible which is why the price we thought was not fully worth it."}
{"text":"Been here before, but not in a while and I thought I'd do a live review. Got here just as it opened and was seated shortly. Right in front of the kitchen which is sort of odd as there are 7 tables. But that's ok. 

I'm anticipating the food being good, as it hasn't disappointed yet. However, the coffee was super weak. I sent it back and the waitress suggested an Americano instead, which is a good idea. Except it was even weaker than the coffee!!  Geez, O&B needs to get their coffee together. She recommended the spiced pear cider.  Bingo. Quite tasty. 

Ambience: It's sort of hard to describe. It's somewhat modern, somewhat old cabin-y. I like it. Though acoustically you can tell it's going to get LOUD when full. 

Food: Damn tasty. Ordered the Fried Bologna and Eggs, which is fried eggs with thin strips of Bologna cooked right in. Great potatoes, as well. Side of \"Nasty Sauce\" which is spicy and citrusy. 

Waitress was attentive and pleasant, not overly chatty. Would see her looking over to see if I needed anything, but not asking how I was every 3 minutes. So basically, perfect. 

Overall: Very good food and drink, but avoid anything that looks like coffee at all costs!"}
{"text":"This was a huge disappointment for me.  We got the Duck Poutine Pizza that everyone was raving about and the prairie grain salad.  I found both to be pretty boring - particularly the salad.  My boyfriend liked the salad but mostly for its healthiness as opposed to taste.  The only thing I truly enjoyed was my glass of pinot noir.

Beyond this, I found the restaurant extremely loud.  I cannot count how many times I said \"WHAT? PARDON ME? SORRY?\".  We were sandwiched between two couples on either side of us and we were so close I had to remove my coat before sliding into my seat.

But the kicker, that actually made me give this place a 2 was the terribly bad service.  We saw our server a total of two times over the course of an hour and half.  When we indicated we had to pay our bill to get to the ballet she dropped it off never to return again.  Any time I'm at a relatively nice restaurant and I have to chase a random server down to pay my bill, I'm not impressed.  

Overall, the entire experience was subpar and I will not be returning any time soon."}
{"text":"Been wanting to come here for years - finally had the opportunity before heading the theatre.  Bannock did not disappoint.

I've had my eye on that chicken pot pie for ages now and that's what two of us ordered.  It was excellent and I'm pretty sure one of their signature famous items.  The other person had a turkey burger which looked OK, but I'm pretty sure my choice had it beat.

Service was efficient and friendly, someone was always filling up our water glasses.  Great prices for the downtown core as well, especially on the street it's located on.

Great place - would come back for that same meal again."}
{"text":"Had the chicken pot pie. Chef seems to love dill way too much. Was below average. Rather have a frozen pot pie. Only had top crust. Not a true pie. Crust was ok, thin, not like a pie at all. Chicken was ok, not very savoury. Mash was ok, but not a fan of mash in general."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today with my pal Viranjith. I bought him the briskett and I had a salmon and cream cheese in croissant.

I liked mine. He seemed to whatever his. The home made ice tea seemed to hit the spot he said. Typical good O&B fare.

It was all good. But I dont need to ever pay $8.00 for anything in a croissant."}
{"text":"A pretty modern place in a nice location, if been meaning to come here for a while. It didn't really live up to my expectations food wise. We had the mussels and the margherita pizza and it was okay - just that. The margherita had wayy too much cheese and wasn't spread evenly. The mussels had the green curry flavor so that was something new and exciting. The waiter was also very friendly. 

Overall, a good place to go for lunch if you're in the area but it's not somewhere id go very often."}
{"text":"Came here because we heard about poutine on a pizza!!! $20 a pizza, it's enough to share between 2 people and leave the restaurant happily filled. 

It's a duck poutine pizza, made with a crispy thin crust that can barely hold up the heavy toppings. There wasn't a lot of duck pieces on the pizza, it was hard to taste it out. The fries were good and crunchy in texture. The caramelized onions makes the pizza sweet, giving it extra kick of sweetness to balance out the savoury.  

The overall flavour was quite interesting, quite tasty.... the combination is on the 'heavier' side making it a really filling dish. I have to say I'm glad I got to try this, but I don't think I'll ever crave it or come back for it. 

Super friendly waiter, super fast service and always keeping our water filled!"}
{"text":"Before I started traveling, I never really thought there was much of a \"Canadian cuisine\", and even now it can be hard to pinpoint it beyond poutine.  So, when I heard of this new O&B restaurant that was supposed to be the pinnacle of Canadian cuisine, I couldn't imagine what that meant - until looking at the menu.  Venison, bannock, boiled meats, and, yes, poutine are just a few of the options on the diverse menu.  

I came with a group of 5, and they had set aside a round table for us in a corner that both felt somewhat private and allowed for easy conversation.  They were very patient with us when one person was running a half hour late.  The server was pleasant and friendly, and very helpful at describing the various options we were considering.  

The food arrived in good time, and everyone seemed to love what they had.  I will say I think I made the wrong decision in ordering the burger - it wasn't bad but it wasn't anything special either.  The root vegetable chips that came with it were wonderful though.  

For dessert, how could I not order the s'mores pie - what could be more evoking of Canadian summers spent camping or at a firepit at the cottage?  And it was delicious.  Graham cracker crust with a chocolatey centre, topped with toasted marshmallow.  How can you go wrong?  

All in all, it's a well-executed concept, and I'm looking forward to trying it again, but will choose my main more wisely."}
{"text":"Bannock!

I'm not the biggest O&B chain fan.  I find them a tad overrated and over priced.  But I was very pleasantly surprised at Bannock.  It's a very casual place located at the side of the Bay flagship store downtown.  Bannock is very similar to their Canteen in a modern coffee diner-esque kind of way.

I was a bit under the weather while heading in, and got one of the better servers I've ever had.  As soon as she heard my voice, she said she'll keep the questions to me to a minimum and brought me some honey lemon and water without me asking for anything.  She was extremely pleasant without being overbearing/pretentious like some of the other staff I've experienced at O&Bs.

The now famous Duck Poutine Pizza was the star, and why I went out of my way to go there.  I had been seeing everyone post a picture of this on facebook so much that I felt like I've already sampled it.  It is as good as it looks.  

I didn't have much else this night as I wasn't feeling all that well, but I did have a side of Chowder which I found a bit too rich and creamy.  My friends had the Pork Shoulder and the Lobster Sandwich which was quickly devoured and enjoyed.

Very much looking forward to sampling other things on their menu as soon as I kick this cold."}
{"text":"This place is quite nice and has a nice modern interior design. Very inviting and the server that we had was helpful in terms of the menu. 

Their bread is awesome. Good for sharing.l and as a starter. 

Prices were affordable, not too bad. Then I got the chef's special. I was really contemplating getting the Mac n cheese and I should have done that because the chef's special was not so special at all. The battered fried fish was smokey and way way too salty!!! It was horrible. Each bite I took, I had to down it with water. I wasn't the only one who found it too spicy. A couple of people on my table who ordered the same thing had the same comments about. Anyway, it wasn't a big deal. I tries my boyfriend' s grilled octopus and it was delicious. Great bold flavours in there and the potatoes were delicious with it. Lastly, we had the poutine pizza to share and it was AHH-MAZING.  That one I was really happy about.

I would definitely come here again to try the mac n cheese now since I didn't get it last time. But for my first experience, it was decent. Just really disappointed  about the chef's special. I'm going to give them another chance to redeem themselves by trying it out again and going for their best dishes. Hopefully my rating will change for next time!"}
{"text":"If your last encounter with bannock was over a campfire at Mono Cliffs Outdoor Education Centre as you huddled over in an ill-fitting neon windbreaker and cursed your parents for not letting you bring your gigantic gray Game Boy, you're in for a treat.

O&B's take on our nation's comfort food is hearty, flavourful and definitely fancified (read: the constantly-mentioned roast duck poutine pizza). There are plenty of veggie and pescie options on the well-crafted menu. Everything tastes great, though what could tempt me away from ordering the smoked salmon and cream cheese bannock ($15, essentially a glorified breakfast wrap, but whatever) I'll never know.

My only complaint is that they could really stand to throw in some sides - just the appearance of some greens alongside my blankly-plated dinner would be nice. A handful of taro chips don't count!

Note: the space (part dine-in, part take-out, and attached to a department store), while neat and relaxed, borders on too casual in comparison with the higher price point, which makes it hard to categorize. Slightly too food courty for romance; too fancy for no-mance. Maybe try grabbing something to go-mance?"}
{"text":"All by myself... stuck in Toronto on my own on Valentine's Day for work, I asked the friendly sales lady at Saks for restaurant advice and she pointed me in the direction of this little gem.  

Decor is Canadian rustic chic, with exposed wood and carvings of fir trees and moose.

Super friendly and helpful service.

Started with an amazing Caesar, just the right amount of booze and spice.  Had the beans and greens salad to start, nothing too groundbreaking, but a nice basic fresh green salad.  Had the lamb shoulder as the main course, tender and flavourful, a bit like a Moroccan tagine in flavour but not as sweet.  Sauce was just a touch on the overly salty side.  

Great little unique spot, definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Ok. So the food here is really good. I WANT to rate it 5 stars. We are here in July and while it isn't really very hot outside, the table where they sat us is so hot. We are right near the kitchen. What do you have against air conditioning?  I'm right by a vent and no air is coming out. When I'm spending $20+ per plate (there are 5 of us), I do not expect to sweat the entire meal. 

That being said. We had poutine as an appetizer. So good. I had the chicken pot pie. Delish. My husband had the flat iron steak. He loved the flavor but it was really overcooked. He ordered medium rare and it was medium well. At best. We showed our server. My son had fish and chips. Stellar. One of my other sons had the grilled cheese. Lots of good stuff. 

But...we were in a hurry to leave because we are sweating.  No dessert. You get my point. Sorry."}
{"text":"Visited this restraint after watching an afternoon Jays game.  Friends and I were trying to find a restaurant to eat at, and after doing a quick shopping session at The Hudson Bay, we noticed Bannock on.m the ground level.   No wait at to get a seat for three, and a nice interior area.  We ordered the poutine duck pizza as a sharing dish and I had the fish and chips.  I was very full, and the food was delicious.  Didn't have to wait overly long for our orders to come out too.  We didn't order any drinks and our glass of water was constantly refilled throughout.

Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Definitely above 3,but really hesitate to give a four. But I can be bias,since I only had one dish.
As a fan of OB chain, and a person work downtown with limited lunch choice, I was sooo looking forward Bannock's opening. However, I didn't have a chance to try it until there is a big ttc delay.

I read about their pickle taco on Toronto life, so I went in, sit down just order that. 
During the time waiting, I enjoy the inner deco very much. It was already after dark, feels like some place you can hold on to a drink for a bit, either chat with friends, or enjoy some time alone, or recover from shopping or cramming for LSAT like me,..

Taco was served, as mentioned in the magazine, on some kind of Chinese steam buns, very cute idea. Chicken is a little bit spicy and tender and juicy with this taco, gives a very sore texture. Pickle add up a lot to the flavor, called pickle taco for a reason lol. However, I don't see there is a need to put caviar on top of it."}
{"text":"I have dined at almost every single one of the restaurants in the O&B chain and its a hit and miss. Bannock is bang on!

Nestled into The Bay at Queen and Bay - Bannock offers up delicious food at more than reasonable prices!

I brought William T. here for dinner prior to catching the opera, Rigoletto, at the Four Seasons Centre.

I love the wooden interior and the shelves, lined with pickled vegetables.  When you first enter you will see the take-out counter but just a few steps further will take you into the dine-in area.

We ordered a Caesar and an H&B cocktail. The best part of the Caesar is the piece of bacon at the end... Yes ladies and gentleman - bacon!  However I found the spiced rim was heavy on the salt!  The H&B was by far my favorite - it was a
peachy cocktail.

We ordered 3 entrees to share. The Roast Duck Poutine was amazingly good! If you order nothing else order this! The flavor was so intense that I think it sort of numbed my taste buds and decreased enjoyment of the other 2 dishes. The duck was a bit scant but the gravy made this pizza delicioso!  The crust was nice and thin and the pizza came out piping hot.

The Side Ribs Burger was also very savory though the pork was not as tender. It was served with yam crisps.

The Pork Shoulder braised in onions and topped with a pear comport was tender and the pork just came off the fork. It was served atop a bed of spaetzle and spinach.  The sweetness from the pears married well with the saltiness of the pork.

Unfortunately after having shared 3 mains we didn't have any room for dessert but after having experienced such great food I will definitely be back for some dessert!

The service here was excellent. The servers and wait staff were all very attentive and a \"so uppity it's scary\" kind of nice.  

The bill at the end of the day came to about $95 for 3 cocktails and 3 mains with tax and tip. It was money well-spent.  Definite must-try and highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Comfort food at its finest. Who doesn't want to indulge in a chicken pot pie or tourtiere on a cold winter day? Bannock serves up what cold Canadians are looking for in a meal. 

On this occasion I was craving a greasy meal after a long day at work. The cheeseburger immediately jumped off the menu and I just had to have it. The burger is accompanied by Taro chips, but I swapped them for fries, which were perfectly crispy.

I'll start by saying that the meat they used for the burger was juicy and delicious. It's unfortunate that they hid the taste of the beef with 6 pieces of lettuce and a sauce that I couldn't figure out. Tip: take off the top bun and the lettuce and taste the beef on its own. You'll continue to want to eat this burger with a fork and knife.

I love bannock and many things on their menu. On my next visit, I have to try the raved about duck poutine pizza. Stay tuned!"}
{"text":"Visited Thur April 13 for lunch, party of 3. 
Server had a bit of a think Irish accent, making her difficult to understand. 
 
Pros
Ordered the Chefs special which was a biscuit, with fried chicken an egg sunny side up and roasted potatoes. They could have used some veggies with this dish, now I have an unbalanced diet. Fried chicken was amazing, just a bit big and hard to eat. Should I use my hands and eat it like a burger? The egg was dripping yolk all over the place and ended up using a knife and fork. 
Fast and attentive service, food came in 5 min!
Don't have time to sit, check out the grab and go section. 

Cons
A bit of a walk to the bathrooms which are on the West side of the restaurant. 
A bit on the noisy side, the place was packed for lunch. 
Construction hoarding along Queen that has been there for years. 

Proptip - Tried to make resos on opentable, and no times were listed at 12pm. Called in at 11am and they were able to find a table at 1pm. Not sure if they save some tables for call-in reservations. 

Damage $22 before tip."}
{"text":"I first came to know about Bannock from the Taste of Toronto. Their featured dish at the festival was the Duck Poutine and based on the previous Yelp reviews, it still seems like a popular dish at the restaurant. 

We came here as a group of three and made reservation for lunch. They didn't have any spots available at noon so we took the earlier one at 11. The restaurant wasn't busy when we came but it was packed by the time we left it. I'd recommend making a reservation here before coming. The waiter said dinner time is the craziest here. 

I ordered the Bannock Bannock as I wanted to try something different from the duck poutine and I thought it may be special since it shares the name of the restaurant. The dish itself came in as a flat-bread sandwich and was served with taro chips on the sides. (*Note: I later discovered that bannock is a type of flat quick break originating from Northern England/Scotland; hence the flat-bread sandwich) The taro chips were an interesting substitute for your typical fries. It was hard to tell whether the they were baked or fried as they  were both oily and the starch texture did have some crispiness. They gave me a hearty portion on the sandwich's part which I guess is true to the restaurant's slogan of offering \"Canadian comfort food\". I ended up only finishing half of it as i wanted to avoid having food-itis at work afterwards. Given it was one of the cheaper items on the menu ($15), I was happy with the bargain I got on this dish. The salmon filling was a bit of a disappointment since I could barely taste the smokey flavour. The texture reminded me of the salmon hollandaise that people get at a weekend brunch, minus the egg part ofc.

Service and atmosphere was okay. All of their furnishings were wooden and they had large tables that catered specially to bigger groups. The dim lighting provided a home-y feel, especially in the areas around those large tables where it looked like a corner from someone's dining room. The kitchen was open-concept and you can watch all the actions in there when you walk from the cafe side. Apparently, there is also a pastry upstairs that makes the desserts for the cafe. It would be cool if that can be open up to the public. 

I would return and try their other dishes. Since the portions here are typically big, it's worthwhile to come here in big groups. For those that want to try the duck poutine pizza, It actually came in exactly as how it's named - poutine served on pizza. It probably could get even more popular if people were given the option to take it without the pizza."}
{"text":"Wonderful food and service by Marcell. I had the Ontario harvest venison & rabbit tourti√®re. Excellent."}
{"text":"While it says this isn't kid friendly they do have Mac n cheese and chicken tenders off menu for kids. My 10 and 11 year old split the special of spaghetti with a mustard cream sauce topped with broccoli and salmon and totally inhaled it.

The duck poutine pizza is big and very tasty. The shrimp with lemongrass and chile had a nice heat to it. The desserts are all made to order."}
{"text":"I love the decor and feel in here. It's chic, but not pretentious. It's unique but not weird. Its small enough to feel cozy, but yet you don't feel cramped. The location is central.  It's a place you can come on your own, with friends, with your parents and feel like you've impressed them with an out of the box choice. And the price point is good too. 

Came here around 1:45pm on a Saturday afternoon. They don't take reservations, and the place was full! Waited about 5-10 mins, and we got a nice table for two. 
I did very much like how it was a four person table, with us at the corner seats. It made for a less cramped lunch. 

Our server was friendly and made conversation, but wasn't intrusive. 

The restaurant's namesake is Bannock, which defined on their menu is a thin, crunchy pizza, folded over with food goods inside. 
We got the Duck Poutine Pizza. Although it was very good (and very filling), it was basically fries, cheese and some duck meat on top of a thin crust pizza. We opted for the pizza instead of a Bannock, because he said it was the most popular. 
I think I regret this choice, because although good, I don't like the feeling of grease inside me after a meal, nor was it something unique (fries). 

We also shared the Roasted Pork Shoulder. It was amazing. And I was sad I couldn't eat more because I was full from my one slice of pizza. 

For dessert, I noted Tong J's suggestion to get the Sour Cream donuts. Yum, it was melt in  your mouth. 

My only thing about the food here, is that it's heavy. You have definite itis waddling out of here, so choose your dishes wisely!

They also have a great takeaway lunch area.

It seems like a great place for commuters to meet, but coming here with a car was difficult. Parking around Eaton Centre is expensive (Green P street is $3.50 an hour) but you can also try City Hall as well."}
{"text":"A total jem. Close to the Eaton,  menu worth killing for, if you're on a trip the price is cheap. If you're looking for a burger and fries for cheap good luck finding something that's not a vending cart."}
{"text":"Unique offerings. Has a very Canadian feel to it. The ingredients and atmosphere is very Canadian. The location is perfect. Right across the eaton centre. This is a great place to bring someone who is visiting Canada. The food is tasty. The service is great and the ambience is cool.   

Highly recommend the Piri Piri chicken.  The fish cakes have a lot of potatoes  the duck fat dishes are interesting."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with bunch of my work team. Large group so we had reserved a table and were seated right away. The server was prompt and attentive. 

The restaurant is smaller than I anticipated. Compared to the O&Y in Front Street. However this also has an equal space for self serve and takeaway counter. The decor is simple and functional. The chairs are comfortable but the sofa too soft-you get the sinking feeling. 

I ordered a Veggie Bannock with Portobello Mushrooms, Hummus, Eggplant. I asked for no comfort Cream (to make it vegan). I had a bit of quinoa as well. The soft flat bread was nice and warm and so were fillings. Seasoned perfectly and tasted yum. But the star was the root chips on the side. The taro chips were baked, sliced thin and seasoned just right. The crispy chip like texture was amazing and size
If each chip was large and wish I could have had more. 

With \"Chefs Permission\" I also got Nasty Sauce - scotch bonnet peppers sauce.  Some additions made the sauce made it a bit less hot. But still had some kick. 

Must go again and try other things in the menu!"}
{"text":"Meh. I HAVE experienced better. I went to Bannock for brunch a few (ok, many) Sundays ago, excited to try out the place I'd heard so much about. I ordered the Smoked and Scrambled, which is advertised in the menu to be \"house-smoked salmon, mustard greens, scrambled eggs.\" Sounds pretty good, right? Well...apparently not. 

First of all, we asked our server for some more info on the Smoked and Scrambled just to get a feel for how it was, what it came with, etc etc. All seemed good so we went ahead and ordered the S&S. To our surprise, the scrambled eggs came topped with a generous heap of caviar. Unfortunately, the generosity did not rub me or one of my other dining friends the right way. Neither of us is a big fan of caviar (read: I totes hate caviar) and we would've preferred to have known our eggs would be topped with little fish eggs so that we could've asked our server to hold back the cav'. 

Beyond that, however, the scramblies were super runny and didn't even taste cooked. I don't know how you can mess up scrambled eggs - it's pretty much one of the easiest ways to make an egg. 

My other dining pals opted for the chicken and waffles special which was apparently 'meh' at best. 

Given the price and the fairly lack-lustre food, I doubt I'll be back to Bannock anytime soon."}
{"text":"We arrived late on a Saturday, so getting a seat was not a long wait. Our server was a nice young man originally from Vancouver. My wife ordered one of the specials with squash and I chose the lamb shepard's pie. Our server advised us we had just missed out on the special (what can you expect when you arrive late) so she went with the chicken pot pie, which she enjoyed. I really enjoyed the taste of the lamb, but was surprised that the dish has chunk's of potatoes instead of mashed, but still enjoyed the dish. A gentleman next to us ordered the poutine pizza and I must say it was a good size portion. If we were in the area, we would stop in again to try some of the other menu items. Choice of beer was okay, mine seemed a little warm, but then most of the places we went served it that way, so it may just be an American thing."}
{"text":"3.5. Ambiance is a little bright, would be lovely for a lunch! Chairs are no comfortable. But the service was impeccable and patient. Had Biffs red wine, the house line. It's bright and cheerful red that pairs well with everything on the menu we sampled: grilled pickerel bannocko. Which were outstanding- fish roe, a delicate but zesty sauce, and just fried enough fish. I highly recommend. Then the turkey burger - meh, it didn't blow me away, it was fine, no real stand out qualities. The beef cheek pot roast with grits on the other hand was perfectly made. A amazing dish, braised and then roasted. Melt in your mouth meat. But the grits were frothy and flavored just enough with a buttery undertone. Just so so s'more dessert. But I don't like dessert. So go for it, it's dense brownie, not too sugary and has a touch of whimsy as its top with heavily charred marshmallows."}
{"text":"Literally just stumbled on this in our hungered state.  The title of \"Canadian Comfort Food\" drew us in.  Waiter was fantastic and sold the dishes very well.  I ended up trying 2 local beers, Mill St ale (red), and another IPA.  My conclusion is that Canadian beers are nothing to write home about.  

The food however was outstanding!  We started off sharing the Pickerel Taco + cucumber apple salad.  Great starter.  It had some delicious white fish in a chinese style steamed bun.  Great starter.  Next we shared the Roast Duck Poutine pizza.  If you like well flavored duck, french fries, cheese, and gravy, this is your dish.  We were kinda skeptical on smashing all these wonderful flavors together, but the waiter sold it well and it was amazing.  Pretty large portion so definitely share.  

We ended with the Canoe Fireweed Butter Tart.  Sweet (but not too sweet) honey tart with blackberry and cream sauce.  Very good and different than your standard sweet fare.  Overall a good experience and fantastic wait staff."}
{"text":"Didn't get to try more than a sandwich here but service was above and beyond what I was expecting. Our server was really patient, kind, and fun. We chatted for like 30 minutes about Toronto and Montreal. 

Food was really good too. Their menu was quite limited because it was early Sunday morning but we got an apple and brie sandwich to share before heading out to the Eaton Centre. It was unique and flavourful. It had some sort of homemade sauce that really added some kick!

I'm going to go back on my next trip for lunch absolutely!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant on the ground floor of The Bay.  Had the chicken pot pie which had a puffed pastry crust that was perfectly browned.  Really delicious and nice comfortable decor."}
{"text":"First time here today for lunch. My boyfriend picked this restaurant. Walking in, we saw a dead rat outside. (Later it was gone, so maybe it wasn't dead?) 
We were greeted by the hostess and told there was a wait. We stood over to the side. A man came in looking for change. Instead of politely asking for spare change, he got in my face spitting on me, swore at me and yelled at me. He then turned to my boyfriend and did the same. He walked over to the couple waiting by us and did the same, only he terribly insulted the woman. The man she was with got up to tell the hostess to get the manager. This rude man kept walking around yelling at customers, until he was chased out by security. They seemed to know this man. It was very awkward but certainly an ice breaker. (We chatted with the other couple after it all). I wanted to scrub my face after that, but decided not to let it spoil the day.
We got the burgers and they were delicious! Food was fast. Service was great. I'd return. Just be on the look out for the crazy man."}
{"text":"When we first went inside you can see people cooking and it smelled amazing. The server put everybody into one section of the restaurant so it was a bit loud and crowded. Our table was very close to another group's table, and it was awkward when it came to talking because the other table can clearly hear us. But the lively atmosphere suited us just fine as we were able to talk, gossip and laugh as loud as we want. 

The d√©cor had a warm and cozy feel to it. The tones of brown and tan in the walls and furniture plus the bright lighting added a down to earth feel. We felt really comfortable and intimate, a place to go for a date or with a group of friends. A place to dress up or dress down. 

Our server were friendly and informative, and gave us the daily specials right away. Service was quick and water was refilled frequently. It only took our food 15-20 mins even though the restaurant was quite busy. 

My friends and I were not that hungry, so we decided on sharing a dish. We also felt adventurous and ended up choosing the roast duck poutine pizza for $16. It sounded interesting and we never ate anything like it before. We really enjoyed it. The cheese a thoroughly melted and it tasted good. But it was not that amazing that I would order it again. 

Overall, this restaurant has a lively but cozy atmosphere to hang out with your friends. We only tried one dish, and it didn't taste as special as it sounds. Other items on the menu sounds good as well and we would come back and try more."}
{"text":"Was at Eaton Centre and didn't feel like the food court type of lunch so wondered across the street to Bannock for their \"sugar shack brunch\" and OMG the menu looked amazing.. love this place. If you've never been here - it's \"Canadian Comfort Food\" done VERY VERY well.  Menu changes all the time. Can't believe I've never written a review on this place yet. Everything I've had here has alway been great ! ...the menu choice was hard plus it didn't help that I was starving - after all  it was 2 in the afternoon . 

We ordered IPA draft beer and the Brunch Poutine and the Duck Pizza. 

The beer was delish!! Gotta remember that one for the future 

The poutine was corn beef and cheese curds with a fried egg on top - oh boy can you say lazy Sunday comfort food. It was good but far to heavy and rich for lunch. Only ate about half. 

One might think the table we had was terrible, but it was full view of the open kitchen and I LOVE that!! 

Saw the MOST amazing looking dishes come out of the kitchen - every line cook was professional and calm.

We were seated in the main aisle - so lots of people coming and going  (hub of activity here). I would like say ever server we  spoke to was calm, patient and very informative. Very relaxing for a customer. O & B does an outstanding job in every restaurant."}
{"text":"I always walked by this place and one day me and my friend decided to give it a try. Our server was great and very attentive. I decided to have the Northern Woods Mushroom Gnocchi, it was a great choice. It was flavourful, and the texture of the mushroom bolognese sauce was somewhat similar to a classic bolognese sauce. For dessert I ordered the warm s'mores pie, I highly recommend this dessert, it can be a little too sweet so it will be a good idea to share it with somebody."}
{"text":"I have been to this place 2 times so far, and I will return to it if I make it back to Toronto.

The roasted duck poutine pizza is great, and the butter tart is absolutely delicious.

The wait-staff was very friendly, and service was prompt. The food did not take long after it was ordered.

Biff's bologna and eggs was also delicious - they were served with potatoes roasted with duck fat.

The s'mores pie was also delicious.

Beers on tap include Mill St. Good stuff."}
{"text":"We came for an earlier dinner on a Monday night and had our pick of the tables. Our server was friendly and had plenty of recommendations on the menu. 

We split the duck poutine pizza as an appetizer between three. It was delicious but very filling, so I recommend splitting it between at least 4 (and probably up to 8) or plan to take some home. 

I had the chicken pot pie for the entree, which was delicious and came out piping hot. I barely even touched the mashed potatoes on the side since I had eaten so much already, but that was good, too. 

Great experience overall."}
{"text":"We came on a Monday night after work and made reservation for 530pm. The restaurant is conveniently connected to Hudson's Bay so there was no need to bring our jackets because we walked through the Path. The restaurant has a cozy feel with low ceilings. The hostess was very friendly and knowledgeable. We ordered the maple lemonade but could only taste a slight hint of the maple. For apps we tried the great old Canadian poutine with duck fat and Bannacos which were pickerel tacos....the tacos were amazing...there were only two and we wanted more. The poutine was too salty but the duck fat really gave the fries some good flavour. For the entree we ordered the daily special which was Shrimp and Grits. The shrimp was plump and cooked to perfection. The grits was nicely cooked and had really good flavour. Never had grits so wasn't sure what to expect. Would definitely eat this again. The other entree was the fish and shrimp cake with arugula, radish and sesame seeds. The cakes were ok nothing special. Overall we had a nice meal and left the restaurant very stuff....."}
{"text":"More like 3.5 

I found out about this place and had come here with the intent on ordering from the Summerlicious menu. Advertised as a \"Canadian comfort food\" place and being a Canadian, I thought I'd give it a try. 

In the end though, while sitting in the restaurant, I gave up on the Summerlicious menu and gave in to my cravings. Yeah....I ordered the infamous Duck Poutine Pizza. Accompanying that is the Get Your Greens Salad. What? One appetizer and one entree for two people? Why, yes. That pizza cannot be tackled on your own. The crust had an extremely flat crispy texture, which was great. I wish the duck had a bit more distinction in flavour since it just seemed to kind of blend in with the fries and wash away into the gravy. Salad was a healthy blend of spinach and kale and the dressing was pretty good. 

Now, onto the exciting part. Dessert. Now, this was personally my absolute favourite thing of the meal. My boyfriend and I got the O&B Artisan Butter Tart to share. Absolutely delicious. The tart was warm and flaky. Scoop some of the provided berry jam and whipped cream into the center and you've got a heavenly experience. We wanted to lick the plate when we were done. One of us may have actually done so. 

Drinks-wise, I just settled for a Peach Juice. It had a large slice of lemon right inside of it and may have had a bit of lemonade inside of it. As refreshing as it was, $5 doesn't really justify it (it's in a pretty small glass). 

Overall, Bannock's a-ok! The service here is friendly and it's cool that you can see the food getting prepared in the open-concept kitchen. The decor is lovely, with a mix of casual and elegant. Some items have the perfect portion size for sharing, keeping your tab on the affordable side. The items aren't too memorable but they weren't bad."}
{"text":"I used to visit Bannock for morning coffee or an occasional snack at lunch.  The lunch is OK but the prices are fairly high, especially relative to the quality.  The coffee is decent.

I went to Bannock for dinner for the first time and its ambiance is completely different.  Among our table, a few of us ordered pizza (duck poutine), tofurkey burger, chicken pot pie, pasta with chorizo - a daily special, and the daily soup.  We were all generally satisfied with our meals but none of us were particularly impressed, save for possibly the person who ordered the duck poutine pizza.

The service was great and we didn't have to wait too long for a table.  Otherwise it was overall a fairly average meal."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of this place.  The ambiance, the furniture, the open kitchen, the deli style counter, the huge seating areas, and most important, the unique, Canadian like menu.

I came here with a part of about 6 and they gave us a huge table in the back.  Our waitress was very friendly and helpful. Checking in on us more than often.

The menu was the funnest part. I ordered a rib burger which was made of a real slab of ribs.  However the delight of the night was ordered by a friend.  A roasted duck poutine pizza.  Not a friend to the arteries, but a friend to my tastebuds.

It's slightly more expensive than a typical restaurant, but not as high end as others. In any case, it's a great place to have a fun time with friends."}
{"text":"yes .. ordered the usual duck /fries pizza dish!! the idea was cool , but actually I rather eat my pizza with the regula toppings minus the fries. 
The reason I wasn't too huge of a fan was because the fries was all mushy (i think that it was kinda the idea).. but in the end I didn't think I was eating a 'pizza\" everythig was just mushed into a big serving and I didn't eat the pizza the way I would normally be able to hold it and chew on a triangular slice --- it just mashed up all together on my dish. 
Definitely need to share with people. I cannot finish this whole pizza by myself .

I'm also a little sad too that they dont give bread rolls -- so we ordered a basket with hummus . The bread basket had a variety of different kinds of bread options but not enough hummus for the amount of things we were given to dip! SECONDS on the hummus please!!

I went for dinner with a group of 3 -- on  Thursday night, pretty easy to get seated. Not my fave place because these were the two food highlights i remember from the night. other dish we also ordered to share was yam fries (maybe it was too much fries for the night all together! )"}
{"text":"I've had my Canadian citizenship for quite some time.
If you ask me what Canadian food is, I'll tell you to Wiki it.
Bannock looks to be no doubt Comfort Food.
The kind that we all see at minimum once a week.

Would you like Fries with that?
967-11-11 Pizza(x2)
Timmies Coffee and Donuts
Breakfast Bacon and Eggs
Kraft Dinner: Mac Cheeses

Canadian factors can be seen, but from a half outsider it's still Western.
The Genre is somewhat difficult to differentiate from American cuisine.
Define Canadian Cuisine how you like, but Comfort Food can't go wrong.
Can it?   2.5'd

BLT Bannock(Bacon, Rocket, Tomatoes, Horseymayo $13.00) - Meh
Roast Duck Poutine Pizza(Curds, Fries, Duck $15.00) - A-OK

Canoe Fireweed Butter Tart($8.00) - Meh
Warm S'mores pie($8.00) - A-OK
Sour Cream Donuts($8.00) - Meh

No doubt the location dictates the price-point of the Meals here.
Easily doubled what I really wish to pay for but that's life.
Think along the lines of Momofuku at least the BLT Bannock vs PB Bun.
There's a comfort level the Food brings I agree.
I wish the space had more warmth and coziness to match.

Did I just pay $8.00 for a Butter Tart?  
I wish I knew what Butter Tart was to start with."}
{"text":"Enjoyed lunch here on a rainy Saturday afternoon after shopping. I've always wanted to check this place out since first spotting it on my streetcar ride to Queen West. From the outside it doesn't look like much, but this is probably due to the fact that there's construction. On the inside, I really liked the decor - it's cozy with eclectic decorations (hanging lamps with tree branches was cool). Service was excellent - I found staff to be super attentive and quite pleasant. Now to the food ... I had the chicken tandoori pizza; can I say yum? It was great; the pizza was flavourful and the crust was super thin and crispy. My dining companion had the pad Thai - it's quite spicy so if that's not your thing, skip it. Can't wait to return and try other menu items.

Good for: casual dining, lunch, dinner"}
{"text":"I first visited Bannock for a friend's birthday several years ago, and then another time for a casual patio dinner in the summer. To be honest, I don't remember much about my dining experiences back then since this place didn't really stand out - it was just alright. All I remember about those meals was the Duck Poutine Pizza... It was pricey, but definitely a unique dish to try! It's huge, so I'd recommend sharing this with at least 3-4 people. The fries were crispy, the duck was tasty, and I loved the cheese. This was served on their famous \"bannock\" bread which made it look like a pizza. Not really sure what it was exactly but I'd order it again. 

I recently came back on New Year's Day for brunch. This experience was definitely better than the others - the food was absolutely delicious! Might be because I'm a huge fan of breakfast foods, but the Eggs Bannodict was SO good. The eggs were served on that unique \"bannock\" bread (sorry, still not sure what it is) and was cooked just right to satisfy my taste buds. I also tried the Mac & Cheese with Bacon which also makes for a great lunch. I found the prices to be reasonable and much more affordable than dinner items. Everything was made very well with just the right portions. As for the service, my server didn't even say \"Happy New Year\"... that's okay though, he was still pretty nice.

Overall, I'd come back again for breakfast or lunch if I was in the downtown core. The location is conveniently right by Eatons Centre & Nathan Philips Square so you can't miss it. I was probably most impressed with the Eggs Benny here and would definitely recommend it to others!"}
{"text":"Have you ever written a long and very funny, useful AND cool review only to have your browser shutdown and fail to autosave what you wrote? Uggggh.

Anyway, my GF and I were here recently and I was very impressed. The service was impeccably prompt...my drink came within a few minutes, and I had barely taken a few sips before the meal arrived. I know a lot of Yelpers seem to gravitate to the Duck Poutine Pizza and other meaty dishes, so as a Pescetarians I hope I can share some useful insight into Bannock's other offerings.

We ordered 1) Winter Sangria; 2) Blue Goose Rainbow Trout; 3) Bannock Bannock

The Winter Sangria was full of tart Cranberries and Apple slices...and alcohol! It was the perfect drink for a very snowy, slushy night, despite the fact that those two fruits wouldn't crack my top-fifty list of favourite fruits, and I don't even know fifty fruits. The beverage part though? A+++ definitely will drink again.

The Blue Goose Rainbow Trout arrived on a bed of green mustard-infused mashed potatoes and roasted leek. The fish was cooked splendidly, and the mustard potatoes were lovably lumpy and delicious. I'm going to try my hand at making some of my own tonight.

The trout was a fitting foil dish to the carb-filled Bannock Bannock. As a Canadian, Jew, and breakfast enthusiast, I was super into this dish: Smoked Salmon, Capers, Cream Cheese, and Dill. Yum! The Bannock bread is also inspiring enough to make me want to try cooking it at home too.  

If you're feeling peckish after browsing Topman's new duds, or hungry from fending off creepy Pick-Up Artists at the Eaton Centre, I confidently recommend a stop in here for a Sandwich."}
{"text":"Came here for the Winterlicious 2016 Dinner $25 Tasting menu.

I've always seen Bannock, because it's located RIGHT beside the Eaton Center, but have never visited and I'm glad I decided to go in this year, even though it's under renovations. O&B are Torontonian faves of course! Making reservation at 6pm and dining at that time is great because not many people eat dinner at this time. Bannock began to fill up by 7pm, and for those who go as couples, you might feel a little squished in their seats.

It's really interesting to note that dinner is $25 though lunch is $18, I suppose it's because much less people show up for lunch - however they offer mainly the same dishes and I'd like to believe that they are the same size. It's a really interesting marketing technique because most people aren't available for lunch.

For $25, you were able to have a starter, a main and a dessert. There were three choices for the starter, four choices for the main and three choices for the dessert. I love being able to go with someone else because we were able to try 6 dishes! 

STARTERS: 
1) Winter Greens and Wheatberries (vegetarian/local) ermite blue cheese, apples, tarragon:

I've never had winter greens raw before and though that the texture of the leaves were really interesting - especially in a salad form. It's much more \"bubbly\" than other types of leaves. I thought that the granny smith apples were super complimentary to the salad because it added to the sour taste, which could replace the balsamic vinegar. 

2) Suhas' Curried Tamarack Farms Pumpkin Soup (vegetarian/local)
pepitas, cr√®me fra√Æche

This was my favourite one. Curry with thick creamy pumpkin soup, sprinkled lightly with toasted and seasoned pumpkin seeds - absolutely to die for!

MAINS:
1) Griddled Pork Shoulder Steak (local) beer mustard, warm sherried lentils, collard greens, screeched prunes:

We got this because it was the only item different from the lunch menu. This dish really reminded of the food I had in Europe when I went on a tour and had three courses everyday for lunch and dinner for two weeks. The pork shoulder was extremely tender, but like most European dishes that I dislike - too SALTY. But hey, that apparently is a cultural thing and I only learned that from travelling to roughly 30 cities in Europe when restaurants have told us most Chinese tours tell them to decrease the salt. 

2) Northern Woods Oyster Mushroom Pizza (vegetarian/local) mushroom and thunder oak gouda mornay, arugula, onions:

I had no idea ??? were called Oyster Mushrooms. Definitely a HUGE dish on a thin sliced of pita, sprinkled lightly with their mushroom, arugula and cheese. Not overly filling, but just the right amount. 

DESSERT:
These portions were a little smaller than others. Someone with such a big sweet tooth - I really wasn't too overwhelmed with their dessert, but I guess O&B isn't famous for their desserts. 

1) Moonshine Pannacotta (local) nice spice, stewed apples, cranberries.
Smooth Pannacotta drizzled with cranberries and stewed apples on the side.

2) Warm Sugar Beet and Chocolate Cake (vegetarian/local)
Tasted like a huge brownie."}
{"text":"Bannock is really busy so the service can be hit or miss depending on the night.  It was a hit for us tonight.  There was a definite buzz in the dining room and people seemed in the holiday spirit.  We had made a reservation for 6 and arrived on time but it took another 10-15 minutes for them to have the table ready for us.  We were kept warm and toasty by the roar of the kitchen heat that was streaming from the open kitchen.

I started with the Throwback Thursday drink specials of the night and the Manhattan hit the spot.  The O&B cream of mushroom soup was warming and tasty.  Moved onto my entree of the wood-fired oven pizza special of the day. It was done just fine and the pizza crust was thin and crispy.

Our server was really nice and chatted us up during the meal.

I think you can have a good time here although my expectations and experience of the place don't really match with the menu prices."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic. Service was great. Someone is coming to fill our water every few minutes. We went here for Sunday brunch and there is no wait. It's practically in the Eaton center. Would certainly recommend for brunch and I would like to try this for dinner or lunch as well."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for lunch with my boyfriend, we had the 'Free-Run Turkey Burger' ($18) and the 'Fogo Island Wild Cod Chowder' ($24), the food was fantastic to say the least. Lots of other interesting items on the menu, a return visit is definitely in order. I will say the lunch was rather expensive, but worth it."}
{"text":"It's fine.  

We swung by for dinner on a Sunday evening and it was bustling but not packed. We got a table easily, which I'm happy with.

I got the cheeseburger and my boyfriend got the chicken pot pie. They were nice. The burger was fairly juicy, pink in the middle, and it got messy. Great fries, always a plus. The chicken pot pie filling was creamy and the golden pastry looked great. 

It's the kind of place you can dress up or down. Service was casual and friendly. $12 for a glass of sparkling wine is a little intense.

I feel like Bannock is a good mainstay for when you're in the area and don't want to eat absolute crap because it's the tourist district, or you're planning a work lunch and need to cater to a group of picky tastes with somewhere not terribly offensive. A solid place to have on a list, but not a place I'd go back to without a purpose. 

Hey, maybe brunch?"}
{"text":"The food wasn't bad but it was grossly overpriced for what you get.  I could get something similar in quality for a third of the price elsewhere."}
{"text":"I guess this place is okay.  The location is great, right downtown.  We actually didn't eat at the sit down part of the restaurant, but rather grabbed some sandwiches and a coke and at on the patio outside.  While the quality of the food was good, I had a hard time paying over $20 for 2 (smallish) sandwiches and one coke.  At least throw in a few chips...or a pickle spear folks."}
{"text":"I am always hesitant to order octopus anywhere, I've had too many experience where the flavor just doesn't come through or I am eating the equivalent of rubber. However I felt adventurous and decided to order the octopus, coconut and lemongrass stir fry and am so glad that I did! The octopus was cooked perfectly and was very flavorful, the side cucumber salad was meh but who's focusing on cucumbers when you have octopus on your plate. 
For dessert I got the the ice cream sandwich, it is pretty big and perfect to share. I will most likely visit again and try something new on their menu."}
{"text":"Food is a little creamy. Definitely go with empty belly! Great place to meet friends and talk tho!"}
{"text":"I've been to Bannock before for a coffee or a pastry but today I decided it was perfect for an afternoon lunch. My friend and I split a duck poutine pizza. We had heard a lot of hype about this pizza and were excited to try it. 

Unfortunately, the pizza didn't excite us at all. It took nearly 30 minutes for one pizza and once we received it and started to eat it, we realized the bottom was completely burnt. The server, who was kind and quick to respond offered to replace the pizza but this took nearly another 20 minutes.

This is probably a one off but from now on I'm going to stick to the coffee and pastries."}
{"text":"Came for winterlicious. Yes I got the $18 worth but the menu selection wasn't anything crazy. Cod was fresh, so yay. Chili was average, and that dessert was too sweet. I was really looking forward to something uniquely Canadian, but they didn't even have a duck poutine on the winterlicious menu. Eh. I don't think I'd come back. It wasn't a very fab experience."}
{"text":"Summerlicious Success!

O&B admittedly has things pretty well figured out. Buy the best property locations, bring in an executive chef that can make moderately interesting food that is priced high enough for large profit but competitive to the demographic in that area, and then hire servers that know what their doing. From a business ownership perspective, it's hard to not respect it even if I'm not a huge fan of all of their restaurants.

I'll skip the specifics on food because their Summerlicious menu is made up all things that are not on the normal menu, so in a week from now the food suggestions will be irrelevant. But you can be sure that they did the math on food costs while taking in scale to feed the masses in a quick enough manner. And admittedly it worked pretty well, and the portions actually seemed bigger than other O&B locations I've visited in the past.

While I wasn't wow'ed by anything we ate (Donair Pizza probably the best thing I tried), it was all adequately tasty and the service was on point, so we left with full bellies and a good dining experience. And for that, 4 stars it is."}
{"text":"Fantastic, reasonably priced food right across from the Eaton Centre, what's not to love? This place is a great alternative to the super packed urban eatery and would highly recommend.

If you need a quick fast lunch and it's cold outside, try out the chili...there's a nice sweet tinge to it!

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Amazing menu. High cal Canadiana creativity. But the air in there left me and my clothes smelling like a greasy beaver pelt."}
{"text":"So yummy!! Unique menu and incredibly friendly staff. My mom and I split the turkey burger and the mac and cheese and were unbelievably impressed with our meals. Generous portions too. Will absolutely be returning. Recommended for sure! Grab the s'mores pie for dessert (see picture)"}
{"text":"Bannock Bannock Bannock...is a little boring.

Came here to check out the hype. Excited to try Bannock bread. Waitress was not terribly friendly (my dining companion felt like she was being stared down a couple times...don't ask me why). I went for the 'Bannock Bannock' smoked salmon sandwich served in traditional Native bread. The sandwich itself was tasty, but to be totally honest I could taste a little freezer burn to the bread.

Um, if I wanted freezer burnt bread I could take out a couple slices of rye from my freezer. I dine out to avoid that flavour...

The side of potato chips were amazingly bland. How about a little salsa or pepper...anything to liven them up! Serving a side of regular flavoured ruffles potato chips would of been more exciting.

My friend opted for the famous duck poutine pizza. True to form it is poutine served on slim crust pizza. But again I tasted a touch of freezer burn on the fries, and there were small edges of them that were still cold. The poutine was good, but when is poutine not good? It was nothing to cry home about. I got to try some of her crust, which was the tastiest part of the pizza.

My sandwich was $16. Its...a little on the high price side considering the side was a small pile of bland chips (so bland I left most of them behind). 

I don't think I'll come back. It was underwhelming and did not live up to my excitement of trying hearty Canadiania cuisine. Should of just went to sky blue sky...grumble grumble

Oh what kept my review from downgrading to 2.5, is that the ambience is lively. As is the location."}
{"text":"O&B get it right. We ordered several plates and everyone was a winner. Thoroughly enjoyed the season cocktails and the interior was really nice also. I would definitely go back. Only strange thing is the window looking into people shopping in The Bay."}
{"text":"The roast duck poutine pizza is one of their most famous dishes. And my mouth was watering even before it was served. It is served on a thin crust with a generous amount of fries and gravy smothered on top.  There were also herbs and caramelized onions that added texture.  The pizza came out fresh from the oven and was crispy which contrasted with the slippery cheese that melted in my mouth. It was the bomb.  It's such a creative dish and a must try!!!!!!! Our waiter was charming and very sociable too,  and very helpful with our questions for menu recommendations. Was a golden experience."}
{"text":"Cheeseburger had soggy tomatoes = soggy bread.   Meat was dry.

Gnocchi had a very unappetizing mushroom-based faux bolognese.

Not impressed."}
{"text":"Wow. I'm so impressed and gastronomically content after a lovely evening at Bannock. We arrived a little early for our group reservation and were seated immediately, and our server throughout the evening took great care of us and gave us excellent menu recommendations.

Even with her expert advice, it was quite difficult to choose which dishes to go with - from our experience, you will not go wrong. We started with poutine and cocktails for the table. The HCB cup was a particular favorite for the refreshing kick of diced cucumber and pineapple paired with Pimm's and ginger beer.

Other diners in the group enjoyed the tender octopus and fried bologna. I opted for the lamb kofta, which was hearty, sweet, and well-matched with tabouleh and grilled asparagus, not to mention a delightful side of bannock (flatbread) with a raisin spread.

For dessert, we were lucky enough to sample all four - canoe fireweed butter tart, s'more pie, sour cream donuts, and ice cream. Totally worth indulging in these treats, and again our server was a wonderful guide, patiently explaining that fireweed is a type of honey.

I'm pretty sad that it's my only night in Toronto - next time I'm here, I'll definitely plan to stop back at Bannock to see what delectable new treats they've created!"}
{"text":"Incredible food, so flavourful, and so fresh. I will return here. I was with two friends and their food was excellent too. Service was prompt, professional and our server Ashley was very friendly and knowledgable. One of the best meals I've had in downtown Toronto. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this restaurant since they first opened. Finally got the chance to come due to Winterlicious! The restaurant is divided in two sections: dining & grab-n-go. It was a bit dark when first walked in and the waiting area was crowded. Lucky we got seated immediately. The service was good; gave us a detail descriptions whenever we had questions on the menu and refilled water all the time. 

Ordered pork terrine for appetizier; I was worried the terrine will be too salty. It got balanced out with a little salad and pickles on the side. (Wish the pickles can be more sour for my personal perference.) The portion for smoked turkey pizza was huge! Good that it was thin and crispy. I couldn't really taste the sauerkraut and onion from it though. Thousand island dressing didnt over power the turkey. Couldnt finish the warm toffee pudding because I was already too full. 

Will come back again for their regular price menu!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch this week with two of my Co - workers. We made a reservation online, which I love, I hate when you have to call! It was a pretty close walk for us from work which is nice. The restaurant is spilt into two, one side for pick up and go and the other for dine-in. It is very very loud and packed at 1pm, it is a hot spot for lunching. 
They didn't have a ton of vegan options on the menu, so I had to go vegetarian. I got the miso soup and cornbread and I got the drink of the day which was pear, mandarin, and cranberry I believe, all fresh squeezed. My coworkers got the Mac n cheese and the fish and chips.
The soup was way too salty, I mean WAY TOO salty. It really kind of ruined it. The tofu in it was smoked and great, lots of mushrooms and not too much seaweed. But you could hardly tell over the overwhelming salt. The corn bread on the other hand was a 5, it was amazing. Pan fried in butter lol hot and crispy outside, I could go for some right now!
The Mac and cheese was apparently very good but the fish and chips were lacking. My drink was fantastic. 
I wouldn't mind coming back and trying something else, maybe the soup was not their strength."}
{"text":"I came for brunch with a big group of girlfriends. While the service was great and my coffee cup was never empty, the brunch menu was small (6 or so options) and quite expensive for what it was. I had the grand slam and despite being $21, it was basically 2 eggs with a very fatty pea meal bacon, a tiny sausage, half a potato, and some baked beans. There were a lot of flavours going on (salsa verde, maple syrup, sausage, beans with tomato sauce...), maybe too many. I asked for my eggs over easy, to which the waiter said \"that's how we cook them\" and they were sunny side up."}
{"text":"Always come here with international friends so they can try bannock, Caesars and the duck poutine pizza. It's sooo heavy but it's amazing!"}
{"text":"I was here last week for summerlicious and it was great, you might want to plan ahead and make a reservation."}
{"text":"Throughout history, there have been brave men who haven't turned away from adventure despite overwhelming odds against them. Men like Shackleton, Perry, Byrd, Hilary and Adam Richman. When our waiter Shawn delivered the Roast Duck Poutine Pizza to our table, I knew I was setting off on one of those adventures. 

The lady commented \"That looks like a heart attack on a plate.\" To which I replied, \"That looks like awesome on a plate,\" earning laughter from Shawn and doubling his tip in the process. Granted, the lady was right in assessment. This was a Man versus Food portion size of carbohydrates. But it was also a heaping helping of potatoes French fried in duck fat, melted cheese curds, roast duck and a wafer thin crust. The fries on their own were so perfectly done that the lady kept stealing them, despite the fact that she said her pickerel taco was phenomenal. The combination of duck, fry, cheese and onion though has worked its way into the top five on my end-of-year list of foods I've eaten.

Not every thing was great at Bannock. The Caesar salad was more like Caesar coleslaw with the way it was covered in dressing. And the salad the lady ordered wasn't much better. The Alexander Keith's IPA was more Miller High Life than India Pale Ale, albeit that's LaBatts' doing more. But when Bannock connected hard, there was little doubt that the dish was a homerun.

Sadly, my battle with the Roast Duck Poutine Pizza ended somewhere between Shackleton and Richman's battles with ghost chiles. But that didn't stop the lady from wanting the S'mores pie for dessert (which was awesome as well, by the way). Shawn asked if we needed two spoons. I said \"one and a half.\" He then proceeded to one-up my joke by delivering the world's smallest spoon. I can see why this place scores an average of four-stars on Yelp, and I think that's about right. But Imma gonna give it five stars anyway. 

Editors note: After losing our creativity on New Year's Eve and seeing Bannock right there, we decided to put this initial review to the test. Bannock delivered again. The  back rib burger is what the famed McRib sandwich would be if it grew up, earned its MBA and set a course for a senior vice presidency. The pork shoulder fell apart like the Tacoma Narrows Bridge with a simple touch of fork. I've never been so happy to be a dullard."}
{"text":"We've eaten here several times, each time with another couple. Each visit has been pleasant, the food was tasty and the service friendly. The roast duck poutine pizza is a must-have and a staple of their menu. A vegetarian friend who joined us on a recent visit was pleased with the veggie burger.

The only cocktail I've tried is The Mighty Canuck (quite good), though they have a cocktails to suit a variety of tastes."}
{"text":"Dining Experience: Dinner
Specialty: Canadian Comfort Food
Menu items: Roast Duck Poutine Pizza

The fairly new Oliver & Bonacini brand, Bannock, is a restaurant unlike any other serving Canadian comfort food. You do not head over there for anything else than hearty, ooey-gooey meals. The restaurant offers both a grab-and-go option as well as features a seat-in dining area. Specializing in an array of burgers, sandwiches, pizzas and meats; Bannock really hits the spot with their pizzas and well, bannocks. I reserve commentary on the sandwiches and other dishes as I was not nearly as impressed (hence the 3 stars); thankfully though, the restaurant is amazing for all kinds of flat bread dishes and the service and ambiance are quite delightful so this post is all about what they are good at, the famous Roast Duck Poutine Pizza.

Where to start? This pizza is heaven in a plate. It's poutine meets duck, get married and have kids in the form of fries. The cheese curds are fresh, soft and perfectly melted with the pizza, yet still preserving its shape and texture. The gravy used as the tomato base sauce is splendid and nothing short of perfect. The fries are not soggy even though they are well blended in this mess of a pizza and lastly the duck is succulent, well cooked and yet not overcooked. What a hit the O&B guys have created. A must try whenever you head over to Bannock.

Although I have not tried them yet, I have heard the Carne pizza and BLT bannock are also quite nice. Will definitely hit those on my next visit.

Buen Provecho,
Viviana."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and service! 
Food was good, but nothing too memorable. 
Reasonable price for great-looking plates.
Overall, I would recommend to people who are visiting Toronto since it is located in the heart of downtown. 

We went there for brunch on Sunday, and their brunch menu offers  traditional brunch dishes with some twists. All the components on the plate were cooked to perfection. Home fries were crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside and seasoned well.I ordered french toast
topped with berries and apple butter. The first few bites were heavenly. Good balance of sweetness and richness from the toast and apple butter and sourness from berries.
If you are looking for hearty breakfast/brunch with a lot of food on the plate, this is not the best option for you."}
{"text":"I've. Been to Bannock a few times now and it has proven good. Canadian food if there is such a thing is found here. Most of the brunch menu is served on top of freshly baked flat bread called Bannock, yummy. Dinner and lunch menu has some rare finds such as Organic Turkey Burger also yummy. I loved their Eggs Bannodict, served on top of peameal bacon and bannock bread topped with citrus hollandaise."}
{"text":"Fried duck poutine pizza, sooooo good. Very filling at a good price. We ordered that with a veggie bannock. The veggie bannock was decent but nothing I'd highly recommend, but the pizza was amazing. Def try it..."}
{"text":"HANDS DOWN THE BEST POUTINE I'VE EVER TASTED!  It was superb! The fries were crisp, the sauce was incredibly tasty, and it came together amazingly! The waitress told us that their executive chef was from Montreal, so it all made a bit more sense!

Unfortunately, the overall experience wasn't enough to keep the poutine high going, which results in a 3.5 rating from me. 

Let's start with the bannock appetizer...it was just bread and pita break served in a bowl with mediocre garlic spread. It wasn't anything like traditional Indigenous bannock that I've tried, so I'm not sure what they were going for here.  

We were told that their chicken pot pie was what they were famous and known for, but in my opinion it wasn't anything special. 

I ordered the duck poutine pizza, and it was unique but overall ok. 

One positive is that my cousin said that their steak was amazing! I didn't try it myself though. 

The menu was creative and unique, but fell short of expectations. When the appetizer poutine is better than the mains, it might not be a good thing, but I would go back for that poutine any day, any time. 

Next, the service was super slow! The wait staff wasn't very attentive and were slow coming to take our orders and to give us our bills, etc... We were there during the dinner rush, but does it take 45 minutes to get our main dish at every restaurant? 

Lastly, the atmosphere was ok, not bad not amazing. 

I think I'd return to try some new items, and just to reiterate, I'd come back for the poutine in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch. We ordered the Caesar. I loved the salted rim and the spice was perfect. I ordered the Mushroom Gnocchi for main. Portions were good. I didnt feel over stuffed. I loved the woodsy mushroom taste of the sauce. Great relaxes atmosphere. Service was great."}
{"text":"Me & Yvonne T. shared three dishes. The Roast Duck Poutine Pizza, was the best item hands down even though there was not much duck the gravy made this pizza extremely good!  

Side Ribs Burger was very savory even though the pork was not as tender as I liked. Came with Yam chips of sorts.

The Pork Shoulder was tender & its saltiness infused well with the sweet pear present in the dish. 

We were well satiated by our meal, the service here was excellent & most attentive!"}
{"text":"Walking into the restaurant, you can either have to-go or sit down at the restaurant to eat. Came here for lunch. There was no line-up and getting seated was quick. I ordered the chai latte and the duck poutine pizza. The chai latte was fairly light for my tastes. I highly recommend the duck poutine pizza! I didn't expect the portion to be huge - its definitely shareable between two pizza. It's a carb-filled meal that is super filling. I was only able to finish half of the pizza and ate the rest for dinner. 

Service was great and prices are fair."}
{"text":"You know where you're so hungry that everything you put to your lips tastes like the most spectacular thing you've ever tasted?? 
Well after an afternoon of exhaustive shopping we popped into Bannock for, what I thought was just a sandwich/fries lunch but ended up seriously impressing me with some scrumptious Canadian cuisine! Started off with Poutine (yummm) and Split Pea Fritters. Now, between the two you would probably think the poutine was the table hit but you would be wrong! The fritters are accompanied by a peppery/curried (?) sauce and a surprisingly well put together salad.
My husband ordered a burger and I ordered the pepper flat iron steak with duck fat potatoes. Both were absolutely fantastic but halfway through my indulgent duck fat potatoes and perfectly cooked steak when my stomach communicated to my brain \"that's enough\", I actually frowned in disappointment as I had been eyeing the s'mores pie and sour cream donuts since before our meal.
I'll be back for both, you can count on it!
Service was friendly and atmosphere also good."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner, cozy, nice decor and atmosphere in general.  We each ordered a main - a noodle for me and a meatloaf for them. For was well done in general, their presentation is really worth noting.  The highlight was definitely the dessert of their bruleed cheesecake.  Great finish to the meal.  

Generally a nice place to come with friends/family.  Does a good job with their service and food, and it's well worth the price you pay!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised to see all the mediocre ratings for this place however it's something that I've unfortunately encountered with O&B restaurants in past.
However with the late lunch I had with Iriana it was perfect! no crowded, plus available choice of seating.  Our server was very pleasant and outgoing, his recommendations paid off well when we were deciding which burger to bite into!

In the end Iri settled for the Turkey Burger with Taro Frites! which left her speechless, it was love at first bite for her! lol... and as always she put the onion ring on my plate which I didnt think twice about devouring!

I on the other hand had their classic season beef burger with Taro frites as well. Juicy melt in your mouth hamburgesa indeed.
only thing I wished was for a lil bit more frites on my plate.  Though presentation was nice, the plate looked a bit empty, hence more frites, or some green parsley decor would have paid off a bit.  
However high n sight! the experience was great! would I come back, yes, but not during prime time lunch because this joint gets rammed to the sliding doors."}
{"text":"Heard plenty of good things about this place, but for me it was a bit left to be desired. I don't know if it's what I ordered or what it was.

I ordered the duck poutine pizza. I think this should be a novelty only item on the menu, but something you really eat as a meal. Perhaps share between multiple people so everyone can try this out. I think it could use more duck too.. I could hardly see around the fries and sometimes I'm like is it crunchy fries or is it duck? I gotta say though, the fries tasted really good and the crust was good. It's just the whole thing was too much for dinner.

The pork shoulder was raved about by the hostess. Two of my guests ordered it, one finished, one did not. Looks to be a toss up.

The service was good though, she as so nice and informative. She raved about everything but then offered her own opinion which is what I'd prefer. She came around when we needed.

I think I need to try more of the food to really say whether this is good or not. It's probably standard fare."}
{"text":"It is always a good lunch or hang out spot for friends. I came here few times already and still think they serve really good food. However the only problem was the waiting time (on the food) was bit too long.. If they could speed that up, that would to perfect!"}
{"text":"\"If you were my son, Mac, I would've smothered you by now.
Smothered me in gravy you big dirty man.\" -- Super Troopers (2001)

On a recent business trip to Toronto, and really limited time in the city to eat anything, I knew what I wanted. I wanted to eat some place with local favors, well-rated, somewhat convenient (read near the airport or on the way to our hotel) and where I could get poutine. I know, I know... Poutine is really a Montreal thing. But I was in Canada and I was apt to get pretty authentic poutine without question... Or as close as possible without being in Montreal.

My coworker trusted me to utilize my yelp skills and find us the right spot. I worked my app and found Bannock. As my Dad would have said: \"Looks good!\"

We parked around the corner and braved the cold and found our way to the doors through the inside entrance. We were seated quickly and a server immediately came to us to get our cocktail order. And yes, I also ordered the poutine - yay! While we waited for those to arrive, we decided on our mains. I opted for the Roasted Brick Chicken with Sopressata and eggplant. 

Before you knew it, a steaming bowl of poutine was placed before me and I was in Canadian heaven! Crispy, salty fries topped with gooey cheese curds and a delectable fresh gravy. Who needs Montreal, I ask you? When in Canada... I could have been happy with a second bowl and been done.

However, my chicken came out and it was succulent and delicious. The skin was crispy, and it was layered with rich sage, eggplant, spicy Sopressata and other veggies. I did my best to polish it off, but I think I left a little. I was jealous of the guy at the next table who ordered the Duck Poutine Pizza - that looked like a masterpiece of flavors! Next trip.

Service was good, atmosphere was nothing to write home about, but the food was delightful and I would visit them again."}
{"text":"I had dinner at Bannock on Friday night and it was outstanding.  The server was knowledgeable, friendly and professional. 

I had the chili chicken pad thai.  it was well prepared, full of flavour and good texture and delicous.
it cost me $15.00 and worth ever penny (and some!) 

The meal was complete with a fresh cup of coffee.

We mentioned that we were on our way to a show and the server was mindful of our timing. Excellent in every way.  I cant wait to go back.  The whole menu looks amazing.
Thank you O and B."}
{"text":"I got the turkey burger as recommended by the waiter. It didn't live up to the hype/description given. All the flavour was from the sauces and condiments topped onto the turkey patty itself such that the taste of the turkey patty was indistinguishable. It could have been not a turkey patty and I probably wouldn't have been able to tell. Though, if it was a little cheaper, I'd probably give it four stars."}
{"text":"You must try their duck poutine pizza.  I know it sounds weird but believe me you will fall in love with this dish and will be ranting and raving about it to all your friends - just as I do.  

The pizza dough is made in house and it's thin crust but not so thin that it can't sustain all the awesomeness on top, which consists of duck gravy, duck pieces, caramelized onions, cheese curds and (you guessed it) fries.  For someone who absolutely hates poutine, I still fell in love with this dish.  Forewarning - it's a huge pizza and unless you are really really hungry, order it as an app and share it with your friends (we shared it with four people at our table).

Their onion glaze pork shoulder was exquisite!  So tender and the onions added the perfect amount of sweetness to the dish that I just couldn't stop eating it.

Other dishes I tried off my friend's plate were equally impressive.  Their pork and belly tourtiere (the pastry is so flaky and the filing is so well seasoned), chicken pot pie (one of their most popular dishes and so hearty) and grilled flank steak (whoever grills their steaks sure knows what s/he is doing - the steak came out perfectly"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a cold Sunday morning. It was pretty busy but we still got seated once all (4 of us) arrived. The service was quick and efficient. The food is pretty good. Coming from a Montreal where we love brunch, Bannock provides a good selection of choices but would be considered an average brunch by montrealer standards haha. It is a little on the pricier side but considering it is part of the O&B family I guess that's expected. 
I ended up ordering the mac and cheese (with bacon and deviled eggs) and it was pretty good. I especially liked that they put extra mozzarella on top of the Mac and cheese and egg. 
I also tried a bit of the Bannodict (it was sort of like eggs Benedict but in a pizza-like thing...) It was good too but nothing out of the ordinary. 
All in all, the food isn't bad, the ambiance is nice, the prices are a little higher than expected."}
{"text":"I am not sure why this restaurant is so popular.  The food tastes ok, but is very heavy and greasy. The service is mediocre.  I had high hopes for this restaurant, due to its focus on Canadian food and its excellent location, but have been disappointed."}
{"text":"Lovely service. Can't stress how important it is to me to go to a restaurant and be treated not only respectfully but also have happy staff! When we entered we were greeted with a kind and happy hostess, brought to a table right away and our waiter came. Our waiter had switched shifts halfway, both treated us so well. One even stayed behind to chat after we paid our bill, like he cared for us to return and wanted us to leave happy. Service is A+++! 

My friend and I ordered a mojito and a lavender cider. How delicious!!! We would have ordered more drinks but we were going to a conference afterwards. Drinks A+! 

Let's say I have really high standards for food. We both had ordered the flat iron steak. It wasn't very tasty or juicy and it was a little well done (we ordered medium rare and it came out medium). The rest of the plate was very good. Again extremely high expectations for food but definitely one of the top restaurants in Toronto. Definitely lives up the O&B brand. Food A-."}
{"text":"Had the peameal, a first for me so I can't make a comparison. It tasted pretty good. It's a nice restaurant in the heart of downtown. Very good service."}
{"text":"The place is very convenient when you are looking for more of a sit down good food.  My first time eating at Bannock was a pleasant experience.  The atmosphere is good,  our server was very knowledgeable and warm.  We started with 2 bread bowls 2 bottles of white wine and for my main course I opted for the special of the day.  It consist of duck,  fried haddock,  and green vegetables.  I find the haddock too salty for my taste but other than that it's an ok dish.  I was disappointed but will try it again."}
{"text":"Nothing special here.  Ok to catch a quick corporate brewsky.  Menu is meh.  Food is Meh.  Service is alright.  Nice location."}
{"text":"Greeted by an amazing waiter who called us 'friends'. He made us feel very welcome and definitely knew the menu very well; all the way down to the tiniest of ingredients like the gravy or the peppercorn used. He definitely made the night even if the food didn't. 

The food was great. It came about a little longer than half an hour after we ordered which was amazing considering we had 19 people in our party. I ordered the chicken pot pie (one of their favorite items on the menu) and I absolutely loved it. It came with simple mashed potatoes with gravy. Once I dug my spoon into the pot pie, I smelled the delicious-ness in the food they delivered.

Would recommend this to anyone who hasn't tried Canadian food. :)"}
{"text":"Sorry Bannock, you've been great at other times, but I am extremely disappointed in the Summerlicious lunch I had.

It wasn't planned to visit Bannock for Summerlicious but I was shopping on the weekend and I was nearby during their Summerlicious menu. 

USUALLY, when my food arrives at my table ordering from a Summerlicious menu, I get really excited because the food looks a lot better than the menu description. However, that was not the case for Bannock. It was the opposite. The first thing I noticed was how horrible the presentation was...isn't Summerlicious your chance to market your restaurant? The overall presentation of every dish was very simple, it looked rush, and it seemed like Bannock cared too much about efficiency for Summerlicious that they didn't care much about how it was presented to customers.

Onto the food, everything was mediocre. Best dishes that me and my friend had were the desserts probably.

Appetizer: We both ordered the tomato & fruit, it was alright, nothing special. I would suggest more leaves though.

Entree: The chicken that my friend ordered was mediocre, lacking in flavor, looks like it was buffet food. The burger I got was alright.

Desserts: The best dish out of the entire meal, I mean how can you go wrong with desserts! We got cinnamon donut with ice cream and fruit with whipped cream.

I enjoy Bannock for their main meal and their to-go sandwiches. But the Summerlicious offerings really let me down."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. Today I got the tortiere. The filling was a little dry, and the pastry was ok. Food here is relatively average, and prices are a bit high for what you get."}
{"text":"Went for lunch, ordered chicken pot pie which was quite disappointing. Crust was just thrown on, was cold/warm. Mashed potato was good but also cold. Portion size was super small, not worth $18 or thereabouts.
Fish and chips were however flaky tender and hot. Definitely not worth the money. Ambiance was ok, quite busy."}
{"text":"I met a friend here to catch up over coffee one weekday morning. I only ordered a tea, so I can't comment on the quality if the food, but they did have a number if pre-made salads and sandwiches from their grab and go bar which looked quite tasty.

I can comment on the service though, something I found to be a little unfortunate. While the waitress was adequate, she was not particularly pleasant or helpful. I had to wait for some time at the cash for her to take my order as she had her back to me. When she did turn around, all she said was \"what do you want\". Not a very pleasant greeting. I asked her what type of teas they had and she said \"they're over there\", pointing me toward a row of canisters of loose leaf teas, turning her back on me again and leaving me to read the names and descriptions of each one. I then asked what she would recommend between the baked apple and the green lime tea, to which she replied, \"one's apple and one's lime\". Again, not particularly helpful. 

I decided to get the lime tea and it was good enough. I was pleased with the price though - $1.50 for a loose leaf tea - it beats Starbucks pricing!

Bannock has a rustic, Canadiana environment where my friend and I were able to grab a table and catch up without feeling like we were being rushed."}
{"text":"This place was delicious.  Came here for Winterlicious and can't wait to visit again soon."}
{"text":"I decided to check out this restaurant the other day. It bills itself as a modern take on Canadian comfort food. The menu definitely does seem a tad bit fancy, but not sophisticated. In other words, no item there should intimidate you.  I ordered the smoked salmon bannock b/c I have never had this bannock in question. My girlfriend ordered the turkey sandwich.

When our dishes came out, I was very relieved to see my plate compared to hers. Her turkey sandwich/burger thing did not look appetizing. In fact, she complained she didn't like it. 

My smoked salmon bannock was very filling. But I honestly, can not say I have an opinion of bannock. I understood it was flat bread, but I have no distinct flavour or opinion of it. Appearance wise, it reminded me of pita bread (which says more about my ignorance of this type of bread). It was an interesting experiment in Canadian food.  I don't think I will be making a repeat visit here."}
{"text":"Bannock labels itself as \"Canadian comfort food.\" The place is named after a flatbread and it's evident in the menu. Between the artisans bread app and the grilled cheese sandwich (highly recommend both), I felt pounds heavier an hour after sitting down!

I'd suggest trying the cocktails. I had the gin-based passion flower and it was really good. The others looked interesting too, like the \"a canadian in manhattan.\" 

The restaurant itself is loud and minimalistic -- half sit down, half grab&go -- with scenic views of department store mannequins next door peering through the glass."}
{"text":"Last night the hubby and and I went to Bannock (an Oliver and Bonacini resto) and we got some EXCELLENT food. Service was ... so so, but the food was very nom nom

What I ate:
Roast Duck Poutine Pizza $16 and enough for 4 people.
Delicious thin crust pizza topped with a layer of roasted duck meat topped with a delicious mixture of fries tossed in gravy, fresh rosemary, caramelized onions and fresh curds... I swear the fries were done in duck fat. The ratio balance was amazing in this dish.

Vegetable cobb $14
Considering I ate  1/2 a bag of cool ranch Doritos earlier in the day, and knowing the caloric fallout I would be facing on the aforementioned dish, I decided to go light. The veggie cobb had, mashed avocado, fried tofu,  Barley with lentils and dried cranberries, deviled egg salad with fresh dill, Thunder oak Gouda, Pea sprouts, red and white Quinoa, cucumber slices, diced fresh tomato, 2 romaine lettuce leaves with a side of house pickled veggies (cauliflower, green and yellow beans, carrots, red onions, zucchini, and chestnut mushrooms (I think, it looks like the enoki with a brown cap) . It was surprisingly filling for a salad and very fresh tasting. I loved the textural difference that the ingredients had, my only complaint was that the gouda was cut to be a bit large and imparted some very large flavour that I felt overpowered the dish just a bit, but there wasn't too much of it so you could cut it up and spread it around.

We rounded out the meal with a bottle of Pinot Grigio, Argento, Mendoza, Argentina ($32)
I dare say it's a very good light/refreshing summer wine. The acidity was enough to help cut through the fat in the Pizza dish, and light enough to dance with the veggie cobb.

In short...or in long however you want to look at it, it was a very good meal and I would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Location is primo.  The menu just changed.  I had been here before, said never again.  But, friends convinced me to try again since the menu had \"changed\" and now that they have \"nasty sauce\" on their menu, why not try again?  Well...it's really not *THAT* great, I'm afraid.  If I'm going to spend the same kind of money, I'd much, much, MUCH rather go to Richmond Station, where I was 2 nights ago, or to Rose and Sons, where I went tonight.  At Bannock, I ordered the brick chicken -- it was very salty.  The chicken slabs were overly crunch and the soppressata that is pressed in between the white and dark meat wasn't very present in the dish at all.  The veggies surrounding the plate was the best part of that entree.  I had to order the poutine fries to compensate for whatever it was that was lacking in the chicken main course, and that was nothing really to write home about.  All in all, the best thing was the scotch bonnet house made \"nasty sauce\".  Too bad I can't eat a whole entree of THAT!"}
{"text":"Not exactly the most excited to go in a construction zone, but the food won me over.

If you're looking for a nice view, you might of struck out. Either you have a view of the concrete construction jungle of Toronto, or the lovely mannequins of The Bay. The decor however is very nice with a modern feel to it.

Me and two other friend came here for Summerlicious lunch.

1 smashed cucumber and head cabbage salad
PICKLED WATERMELON, RUTABAGA, MINT, GREEN CURRY

Nice. I would rate it a 4/5 for an appetizer. Quite filling, and exotic flavors. I mean pickled WATERMELON. It's really weird, but good. However, I'm not a fan of pickled items so I wouldn't put it on my grocery list. 

2.roast peameal bacon melt
BANNOCK SAUERKRAUT, CHEDDAR, SMOKED TOMATO MARMALADE

FHKSDJHFDSJK. SO. GOOD. Slices of thick bacon and melted cheese between pita bread. Basically the perfect sandwich in existence. The bacon and cheese was just spilling out the sandwich; just how I like it. It was paired with taro chips on the side, which was really nicely paired with the sandwich. I could barely finish half the sandwich and had to take the other half (+ chips) home. Definitely a 5/5.

3.bannock ices

Basically ice cream. The flavors for that day was Blackberry and Vanilla. For some reason, I REALLY liked it. And I don't like desserts. But it was wonderful.

The food was amazing in short. Amazing in taste and amazing in portion. If you're looking to get fat, come here. (In a good way though!)

The service could of been a little bit better; I had a welcoming hostess, but the server looked like he wanted to be somewhere else...

All in all, I really want to come back for brunch! Or at least to feel fat again ^_^"}
{"text":"My friend and I encountered Bannock while on our downtown shopping extravaganza (woo hoo!). SUPERB location!  I'd read great reviews about this relatively new eatery (plus it's Oliver & Bonicini, so how could we go wrong?), so I figured it would be a treat!  Upon entering for lunch, we realized the restaurant was basically split in two - the deli-countered, limited-menu side, and the \"real\" dining area, with extensive, much lauded, renowned-chef-designed Canadian comfort foods menu.  It was quite busy, so we decided to hit the deli side for a quick but hopefully delish meal.  Atmosphere was friendly, casual, and urban stylish.

At the counter, we ordered and picked up our lunch:  I had wanted the venison chili, but was told they ran out (!)  Okay, switched my order to the Quebec tortiere - a meat pie made of duck and pork.  Sounded tantalizing!  My friend ordered the soup of the day - French Onion, and a Caesar salad.  After luckily finding a spot by the Queen St. window (always entertaining!), we dug in. Honestly, our meal was a bit of forgettable eats.  The tortiere was a disappointing mush of vaguely chicken-like tasting blandness - served with packets of ketchup (!?), and my friend didn't rave about her soup or salad.  After being constantly prodded by incoming customers about needing a place to sit, we packed up and left.  I WILL give Bannock another chance, though, based on the high ratings at Yelp, and the fabulous downtown location.  Perhaps I will do the proper dining area - the snack/deli counter doesn't deserve any special attention!  Can't wait to try the poutine pizza and albacore tuna teriyaki, among other dishes!"}
{"text":"Dropped in to try the Arctic Char. The server was highly interactive, with a friendly, confident and positive mannerism. Absolutely great atmosphere. The Char was 5 star delish with an absolute huge abundance of fresh cut fries that I could not finish and neither could my bud after trying to help. Excellent."}
{"text":"Duck Poutine Pizza. The sole purpose of coming to Bannock!

Bannock is a hip Canadian restaurant that is located on Bay and Queen directly across the Eaton Centre. The place itself is bustling with businessmen and hipsters all the same. Nice dining area with some odd decor and a small cafe on the other end as well. The menu isn't huge, which I like, and offers some nice comfort items like sandwiches, burgers, and pizza. But enough with the foreplay, onto the Duck Poutine Pizza ($16).

There's a reason many of these reviews you're reading is talking about this one dish. Never before have I heard of combining three items as popular in Ontario as pizza, poutine, and duck confit. The duck poutine pizza sounds like a problem for the arteries and Bannock actually did a fair job with it.

The pizza itself is a thin crust with a layer of mozzarella cheese and thin gravy. Then comes chunks and pieces of duck leg confit slightly cooked and topped off with an immense (overkill) amount of french fries. There was also a strong hint of rosemary, which didn't tickle my fancy. The pizza is HUGE and is possible to share between four people (or two hungry men). Sadly, my underwear must have been on too tight as I wasn't even man enough to finish a third of the pizza. 

I enjoyed the different flavors you were getting from the pizza. The cheese was melted perfectly to where you had bridges of cheese stemming from the pizza to your plate. The fries were crisp and the duck meat was good. However, I just couldn't shake how salty the entire pizza was. The portion of the duck leg was rather weak, and they seemed to balance it out by throwing on more fries. The execution was a bit lackluster to say the least.

Overall, the pizza was a bit of a disappointment but was still rather good. It's a unique enough dish to where you better order it. My girlfriend absolutely loved it. (Her heart, maybe not so much, but she did). Bannock is good for people watching too as it's in a busy part of town (since it's right by the Eaton Centre) and is well worth a visit.\""}
{"text":"We were visiting Toronto from Upstate NY - had never been there before. When visiting a new city my wife and I do our best to \"live like a local\"... and we had a difficult time choosing where to eat as it seems Toronto has just about anything you can think of. But we decided upon Bannock because they were listed as Canadian Cuisine - which is something I'm unfamiliar with. We were not disappointed, whatsoever. The food was delicious. The atmosphere was intimate, and kinda trendy. The service was wonderful. The price was very reasonable... we spent $100 for two dinners, desserts, and drinks. Try the Bannock Bannock - the smoked salmon was perfect."}
{"text":"Bannock refers to the flatbread which forms the basis of most of the dishes, it's a versatile bit of stodge used for pizza bases, burger buns and sandwich bread, but honestly it's what goes on and inside them that's really good.

As a party of four we were able to order a variety of dishes and the portion sizes meant that we all got to try a decent amount of everything.  

We shared a couple of starters - the best being salt cod donuts with double smoked bacon lardons, but the split pea fritters were also good, like nuttier felafel with a great texture.

For mains we couldn't not order the roast duck poutine pizza, which did exactly what it said on the menu. A gargantuan stack of chips, gravy, curds and duck on a flatbread. Nothing too exciting, but delicious nonetheless.  More interesting was the pulled pork and macaroni quesadillas - unsurprisingly it turns out that this carb on carb combination is great.  To me the best main was the meatloaf; moist and succulent loaf, topped with baked grapes and placed upon a bed of mixed whole grains - together the meaty, earthy and fruity flavours made this the most interesting dish.

Our desserts were good - a butter tart and a s'mores cake (a chocolate brownie topped with toasted marshmallow) - but not terribly exciting. To be honest, by the time we'd polished off the mains I was amazed we even tried to tackle them...

Service was very friendly and good food advice was given - staff seemed very jolly and happy to assist when required.  Decor was pleasant, modern and airy - a nice place for small groups, but less good for an intimate dinner.

It's nice to finally see a restaurant that manages to do Canadian comfort food the service that it deserves. It's not fine dining and it's not a diner, it's souped up crowd pleasing dishes with some delicious innovative twists at a great price - heartily recommended,"}
{"text":"I like the food on both the deli side and the sit down side.  I often grab lunch here when I'm working downtown.  Their sandwiches and wraps are made fresh, and taste delicious.  The turkey is my favourite.  I really like the quinoa salad as well.  The service is always friendly.  But make sure you don't get their too late for lunch, b/c the food goes pretty fast I find!

I've only been to the sit down side once.  I had the mac and cheese, pulled pork quesadilla.  I thought it would be such a strange combination, but it actually really worked well.  What I liked most was that it had toasted corn nuts on top for a nice crunch!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch with some friends and it wasn't too packed on a Saturday.  We were seated quickly and given menus to look at.  Everyone at the table ordered from the weekend brunch menu -- we got the shakshuka, eggs benny, and smoked haddock hash.  Our waitress was super attentive and everything tasted great.  While their menu items might be more on the tad expensive side, I'd like to think I got my money's worth of food!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times I've enjoyed the food and atmosphere. The restaurant is split into the Dining in section and the take-out section. The take-out section is to the right and there's some pre-made sandwiches, salads and pastries. The sandwiches are pretty good, and there is some seating in case you want have a coffee or have a quick lunch. 

To the left there is the Dine-in section that's also good. I brought a friend here for her birthday lunch and we both enjoyed our dishes. They have some interesting twists on some classics. I would come back if I was in the area for lunch. 

Keep Eating, 

Angela"}
{"text":"Duck poutine pizza - (B) As the waiter said, it's like a duck poutine was flipped onto a thin crusted pizza. This was just okay. The flavours were a bit bland. The dish itself is unique, but the taste was just okay to me.

Vegetable cobb salad - (B) Loved the presentation. The praire grain pilaf was in a long ice berg lettuce. It was paired with a stuffed cucumber and one devilled egg. The salad was okay. Kind of bland. My fave thing on the plate was the devilled egg! So creamy and yummy!

Free-run Turkey Burger - (A) The star of the night! Amazing burger, tender, flavourful, and the taro chips were a nice touch.

Chili Chicken Pad Thai - My friend had this one. I didn't try it because it was pretty spicy. She liked it.  The portion of this was smaller than the other dishes though.

Fish and Shrimp Cake + Duck Fat Kimchi potatoes - (C) -  the fish and shrimp cake was just okay. It was very salty and the fish overpowered the shrimp taste. I couldn't taste the duck fat on the potatoes, but the kimchi flavour was present. 

Drinks: I got the coconut keylime mojito and mango mojito (daily special). Loved them both! Very tasty. 

Desserts: Butter tart (B+) - the crust was very crispy and good. The filling was a bit too sweet for me. The warm s'more pie was delicious - not too sweet, but very flavourful! (A)

The portions were really good for the price we paid. Service was okay. Our server was a bit cold, but he never left our water empty and gave us good suggestions for food. Even when we paid the bill and hung around to chat, he came over to give us water."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place.  I liked the idea of the Canadian comfort food concept and the way they executed it.  As an American we hear here that no one knows if there is anything different about Canada and I feel like they should export this restaurant to enlighten folks south of the 49th.  I had the mac and cheese and boy was it special.  So unique.  Partner had the same because he is a copy cat, but also had the prairie grains salad and it was incredible.  Great decor, fantastic service and a nice little patio which we got to enjoy because of the best weather I heard Toronto has had in October in a very very long time.  I highly recommend dining here. 

Oh and we had to have our dinner rushed so we could make curtain call at a show not anywhere nearby (really really bad planning on our part - whoops!), and they accommodated us without hesitation."}
{"text":"Took some out-of-town friends here for Winterlicious two days ago and we had a very enjoyable meal! Plus, $18 for a three-course lunch is great value for the quality of food that we received.

Appetizer:
We ordered the pumpkin soup and the ten vegetable slaw. The pumpkin soup exceeded my expectations - super savoury and not at all sweet like some pumpkin soups can be - and I heard good things about the slaw as well.

Main course: 
I had the mushroom pizza and it was SO good - a simple but delicious medley of oyster mushrooms, gouda, arugula, and onions atop a thin, crispy crust; I really liked that they used gouda for the cheese, it complemented everything perfectly! Unfortunately, the smoked haddock was not as well received, but both of my friends couldn't stop saying how good the sausage was.

Dessert: 
All three of us opted for the sugar beet and chocolate cake on the recommendation of our waiter. Although I really wanted to love the adventurous flavour pairing, this dessert kind of fell flat for me because I just couldn't get past the overpowering beet taste. My friends seemed to enjoy it though and the chocolate cake itself was very good.

Overall, the food was great and the service was even better. Definitely one of the better Licious restaurants."}
{"text":"Came in for a quick dinner a couple weeks ago. What we ate:

Fish shrimp cake and duck fat kim chi potatoes: pretty good, interesting/funky flavour with the kim chi. Not spicy, very mild.

Chicken pot pie: pretty yummy, nice big chunks of meat.

Grilled pickerel bannacos: nice flavour, but drips everywhere (if that matters at all)

I would come back and try the other comfort food. They put interesting twists on some dishes. Great service as well."}
{"text":"The Oliver-Bonacini-owned Bannock is a split concept restaurant...one side is a takeout place (sandwiches for lunch, etc), the other side is a proper restaurant. This review is for the proper side (dinner).

The meal I ate there the other night was so good that I'm going back tonight to eat the exact same thing...yes, perhaps I'm weird that way, but I can't help myself. I've been thinking about it ever since!

CHICKEN POT PIE PERFECTION...flakey buttery puff pastry; creamy, flavourful filling that warms the soul. (Caution: hot! Be careful or you'll burn your tongue.) CPP is my favourite comfort food and Bannock's version is ridic. (Random hint: if you also love CPP, Summerhill Market's prepared version is excellent if you ever find yourself shopping there.) My only criticism is that Bannock's pie is a tad on the small side. Anyhow, I followed this up with a butter tart baked in the oven of GOD. Absolutely, positively, ahhh mazing.

Ordered their variation on caesar salad as a starter, which was also quite nice. And I stole a bite off a friend's dessert, the smores pie, which was ok but the tart stole the show.

Can't comment on any of the other dishes, but if you feel like a pot pie and butter tart, oh baby, Bannock or bust!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for $15 Summerlicious lunch. Very casual and quick with good Canadian comfort food.

Salt Baked Beets - very fresh red & golden beets with nice presentation. The other Caesar soup was less impressive; essentially the drink in a small bowl. 

Peameal Bacon Melt - the pita bread (bannock?) and peameal bacon was a bit tough, but I loved the tomato marmalade & sauerkraut! It reminded me of kimchi; loved the sweet & spicy combintation! Served with taro chips - my favorite!

Bread Pudding - this was more of a dense/eggy cake... not the bread pudding I like, but I did like the chocolate sauce. 

Apple Fritters - like large timbits.. I liked the berry compote!

Service was quick; I guess it's expected for this casual cafeteria style restaurant. The server forgot our drink so she didn't charge us after. 

Overall, I enjoyed my lunch here. Great Canadian classics with a twist."}
{"text":"I had been eyeing this place for awhile as it looked interesting and the lack of over signage intrigued me into finding out what type of food was behind the giant glass panes that decked the front of the restaurant.

Now, I'll skip right past the mystery if there was any in the first place; it's an O&B restaurant. Not a bad thing necessarily, not a point in its favor either (I try and avoid chain restaurants sometimes). I find this out before I go and am unabated in wanting to go. I've looked at the menu and it looks good so there's no turning back now.

When I go I was here on a date, and so the main focus was really the date and not the food, but turns out the food maybe should have been the real focus....I'll get to that a bit later :D

So, we are looking over the mains and I suggest sharing the duck poutine pizza. I've noticed that most of my fellow Yelpers are also fans of this dish as it seems to account for about 65% of the pictures from here. It does not disappoint, it's cheesy and delicious and the fries are crisp, the gravy nice and flavorful and the shallots adding that extra zing that you need.

It is at this point I commit my first strategic error, I pay more attention to my date. Now don't get me wrong, 100 out of 100 times I'd suggest doing the same, but alas, this date doesn't pan out, which goes to show you that when choosing between your date and pizza, always choose pizza because unlike your date, pizza always works out!

That is all. Go get the pizza!"}
{"text":"We recently did Winterlicious here and the food and service were great however, the seating/atmosphere was not!

Firstly, there is a draft from the revolving door and my friend was sick so it was really affecting her. I was quite chilly myself and kept my scarf on the whole time. On top of that, we were seated next to the kitchen where it was really loud. 

Our server was amazing!! He was really sweet and really took care of us. 

I ordered the risotto and my friend ordered the salmon - both were really great. The nutella dessert cup was amazing!!

Eventhough the food and the sevice were great, not sure we will return due to seating."}
{"text":"This review is for the Bannock walk-up counter, not for the sit-down restaurant.

I work on Bay st. and thought that a Bannock breakfast might be a nice treat. Despite bannock being on the menu, it was not available at the walk-up counter. Their breakfast wraps, the only substantial breakfast offering, were 'sold out'. As if somehow there is a finite quantity of eggs and cheese, which lead me to believe these are clearly made ahead of time and they hadn't figured out demand yet. Why would I pay $8 for a reheated egg wrap when I could go to tim hortons and pay $4? 

I got a scone. It was good. It wasn't worth going to Bannock. I'll go back for dinner one day.

**UPDATE**

Went back for dinner with a group. Service was really great. One of my friends wasnt eating and they brought him a poutine for free! Food was okay. The mashed potatoes tasted fake.  Maybe we went on a bad night? My chicken pot pie was also disappointing, kinda tasted bland and store-bought. I think the only real winning dish in our group was the pork shoulder. 

I feel like I'm the only dissenting voice here which makes me think I'm missing something but I really think I  can cook better 'Canadian comfort food' than this."}
{"text":"Checked out this restaurant because of the ratings. It's not inexpensive as listed in yelp but rather pricey. Plates range 19-25 and apps 9-15. Soup was cold. Burger not bad but overpriced at 20. Service was poor, place packed and 2 waitress on floor for about 30 tables. Not a bad place. Expensive. Spent 160 table of 4. We had 2 burgers, 2 drinks, pot pie, Mac cheese and soup."}
{"text":"Always had a good dining experience at Bannock. Came here with a friend for their Summerlicious lunch. Here's the run down about the food:

Appetizers
Broccoli and Bacon Turnover (local): The textures were great, turnover intricately baked with broccoli and bacon, but it tasted like any other Starbucks pastry. The side salad was great, so was the sauce that accompanied the dish. But I wouldn't recommend it.

Watermelon Panzanella (vegetarian/local): Lovely. The aioli was fantastic. A great summer dish.

Mains
Donair Pizza (local): SO GOOD! The meat was slightly sweet, which adds to the fun of the pizza. HIGHLY recommended.

Roasted Haddock (local): It was cooked well and the greens were delicious, but I wasn't a fan. My friend really liked how \"healthy\" it tasted. I found it a little bland.

Dessert
Tres Leches Cake (vegetarian/local): Way too sweet. The sauce made my throat sore :( I couldn't finish it.

O&B Meringue and Raspberry Mess(vegetarian/local): The meringue bits were way too sweet here too. It tasted like plain sugar, which is what meringues are made out of, but still. We couldn't finish it.

Overall, the Donair pizza was a definite highlight. For around $20 per person, this is not bad at all!"}
{"text":"I came here for brunch on a Sunday at 11:30am. Surprisingly there was plenty of seating available which was great!

I had the Brisket and Boiled which has chunks of brisket tossed with some potatoes, topped with 2 soft boiled eggs and some catsup. Overall, it was very flavorful and the portion size was perfect. However, I would have liked my brisket and potatoes to be a little hotter- it was room temperature by the time I got it.

I would go here if I was in the area ,but I would not go out of my way!"}
{"text":"A little pricey, but the food's flavorful, the ingredients are quality, the interior is warm,  and the service is friendly.

Food:
BLT Bannock: Thick cuts of bacon, non-mealy tomatoes and baby arugula. The bacon isn't salty like the stuff in your fridge, the tomatoes could've used more flavor and the arugula added a nice peppery note. Plus there was a hint of tarragon(?) that went well w/ the horsemayo.

Pickerel taco: This isn't your usual fish taco. First off, the tortilla reminded me more of bao than tortillas. The fish tasty and topped w/ an apple and cucumber slaw that added some sweet, tart and crunch.

Sweet potato fries: Crispy and fluffy and piping hot. They go well w/ Kozlik's spicy brown mustard so ask for some.

S'mores pie: Rich, chocolatey, not overly or tooth achingly sweet at all despite all the marshmallows and chocolate. This is a winner.

It's spendy, but go ahead and treat yourself since it's hard to find food this tasty at a lower price point."}
{"text":"Review #3

So -- I really liked this place and went again last night.
Not sure if I will go back though.

They took my fav pulled pork toutiere off the menu!  Really????!!! Why??  This was an awesome dish, and this was a real miss for me.
So instead I thought I would try the Chicken Pot Pie that was legacy from the Arcadian Court.  Funny -- wasn't like I remembered and way, way too much tarragon folks.  Totally overpowered the dish - it was the only flavor that came through.

My hubby had the steak and the chocolate ice to finish -- he said his was fab.
I finished with the Passionfruit sorbet which was so tart, it gave me unbelievable heartburn for the rest of the night.

Anyway folks -- if I can't eat a meal and enjoy it and not suffer for it all night -- well -- BIG MISS!

I will say that the bread basket continues to hit the mark and the black bean hummous was great.

Shame really -- always been a fan of O+B restaurants."}
{"text":"I came here the other day for a quick bite and the weather wasn't very nice - very rainy in fact, but i stopped by for a quick coffee and some appetizers. They have two sections - one for dine-in, and one for grab and go. Becuase I wasn't staying long, I went to the grab and go section. I ordered a Cortado and their GRIDDLED FISH \"BANNACOS\" - recommended by the girl who was serving me at the counter :) it did not disappoint!

The fish tacos were presented beautifully along with a apple cucumber salad :) the fish was nice and crispy, and the seasoning and garnishes with the taco was excellent! They used a bit more sour cream than i would like, but all in all the tacos were very tasty and i love the presentation of the apple cucumber salad on a lettuce leaf :) 

I was also surprised by the coffee! I didn't think it would be a place where i instantly would think great coffee, but they cortado was great! the expresso was done very well, lots of foam and I enjoyed my drink very much. The only hiccup was i forgot to tell the girl i'm lactose intolerant, so it was done with regular milk... but I did take my enzyme pills so all in all it wasn't too bad :) But next time I deifnitely will make a mental note to ask for lactose free milk!

I definitely would consider coming back here to try some of their other dishes. Being a part of the O&B group, I did have certain expectations of their food and I'm glad to say I wasn't disappointed!"}
{"text":"Bannock was one of the first places I ate at when I moved to Toronto, and it has had a special place in my heart ever since. If you haven't had bannock before, the bannock bannock is a great introduction. Or, if you really need a pick me up, get the ridiculously rich duck poutine pizza.

It's reasonable prices, can't-go-wrong \"Canadian comfort food\" menu and central downtown location make it a destination. The service, as with any O&B establishment is always top notch."}
{"text":"Good food and good service on a busy Saturday night, I had the pasta special and my friend had the meat special. Both were good, the pasta looked handmade and the sauce was nice and light. The meat special was a bit dry but still tasty. 
Have been here several times and tried a number of their dishes. Really liked the pot pie, especially on a cold day. They also do one of the more affordable summerlicious/winterlicious meals.
Also noticed they now do daily drink specials, so that's a plus if you work in the area and are looking for after work drinks!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came here for winterlicious and I was very disappointed with the service. We waited for 20 minutes at our table and no one came to greet us nor asked to take our order. Another table sitting next to us was served right when they sat down. I had to flag a server down after looking around for one several times. I had to also ask another server to remove the dirty napkin on our table from a previous sitting. Overall the food was great. I was told the service is usually okay but not sure why my experience wasn't what I expected. I'll probably give it another chance in the future."}
{"text":"Another O&B creation, Bannock is serving up Canadian comfort food at the corner of Queen and Bay.  An interesting location steeping in Canadian history, across the street from old city hall and practically inside the Hudson Bay Company flagship store (there is a peek-through window in the dining room into the ladies accessories department).

My dinner mate and I are workers in the Financial District ant hill and as she was somewhat fresh from some back surgery I had to find somewhere very local for her healing back's sake.  We 're approaching the Canada Day long weekend, so Canadian comfort food it is for my dear friend with the bad back.

Some tempting, rich sounding dishes and specials almost swayed us but we actually chose from their \"meatish\" menu.  I got the Vegetable cobb consisting of avocado, barley, deviled egg, thunder oak gouda and living sprouts on some romaine leaves.  At $15 it was light but filling enough to call a meal.  Dinner mate got the Tofurkey Scallopini with mozzeralla, roasted garlic, squash mostarda and quinoa... the texture of the tofurkey was really more just like tofu.  Good flavour but not the consistency that was expected given the item's name.

We purposely kept our meal light to leave room for dessert... I hihgly recommend you try to do the same, maybe not the light meal, do what you will there, but you're a fool if you leave this place without trying the not just the Canoe Fireweed Butter Tart, but the Warm S'Mores Pie.  One of the best butter tarts I've ever tasted.... this is true.  But the real show stopper is the S'More Pie.... basically a brownie with a graham cracker base and toasted marshmellows on top.  What the what? you ask.  Yep, I respond.

This spot is definitely worth a revisit."}
{"text":"The food concepts are weird and eccentric, with all sorts of interesting combinations and bizarre ingredients. Generally they do seem to do a pretty good job at making stuff taste at least decent though. I've had the pizza here and at some point wouldn't mind coming back to try the other options. I'd rate the food at 3/5 for flavour and satisfaction, and 4/5 for creativity. Our server was super pleasant though, so top marks to him. Overall an excellent experience."}
{"text":"One word... Underwhelmed! Ordered one of the most popular dishes on the menu: chicken pot pie and it was meh!"}
{"text":"I took a client here for lunch and was blown away! Such beautiful decor and rustic feel. If you are from out of the country, it's fun to try the local comfort food, like Poutine, which was amazing here. I have to say, of everything we tried, hands down the best thing on the menu we had, and perhaps one of the best dishes of my life was simply the beets (a side dish) with pink salt, olive oil, and creme fraiche. $8.00 and truly the most wonderful beets I have ever had in my life, cooked and seasoned to perfection. Not that I didn't love my entree, but I could have just ordered 2-3 orders of the beets and been perfectly content with life.

I got the salmon and lima beans which were also amazingly seasoned. My hats off to the chef, thank you for making my stay here in Canada that much more wonderful."}
{"text":"Bannock really surprised me. 

Over the years, I've eaten at other O&B chain restaurants and I come away with less than stellar impressions of their food. I feel that it's never great or fantastic, it's just always OK. But Bannock is different.  

I came here for lunch with my new team members. It was a celebratory \"get-to-know-you\" lunch as I just joined the team. 

Firstly, the atmosphere at Bannock is reminiscent to a log cabin, a fancy log cabin that is. I liked how you can either sit down and to eat in the dining area or be in the caf√© area, but the look and feel of the place remains the same. 

We were intrigued by what \"Canadian Comfort Food\" was and Bannock's version of what comfort food was impressed us.

We ordered as a lark the Salt Cod donuts ($(9) for the appetizer. The flavours were  a nice touch of not being too fishy or salty, or too doughy.  For the main, I ordered the St. Canut Pulled Pork Tourtiere ($16), a small version of a traditional tourtiere served with roots vegetables like beets, parsnips, turnips and ginger root. The way they make the dish is different: the pulled pork is cooked and then ground to be added to the tourtiere. It was a dish I really enjoyed. 

For dessert,  we had the Warm S'mores Pie ($8) and the Canoe Firewood Butter Tart ($8), the latter being an instant favourite. Pricey, yes, but it's bigger than you're normal size. It's sweet but not as sweet or chemical-tasting than other butter tarts you eat. It's very unique tasting and one to try whenever you're there. 

I tried to buy a tart on my way home but sadly, they were sold out. It's not surprising that it's one of Bannock's most popular treats."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints. It's a restaurant everyone must try once. Enjoy  a warm, comfort-food-filled brunch to soothe a hangover, eat your feelings after a break-up (not that I have) or full-fill your cheat day with a winning smile.

While it's not a healthy choice, it's a good choice. This is one place in Toronto that never lets me down. Everything always tastes so amazing."}
{"text":"I've continued to come to Bannock many times over the past few years.  I always seem to bring out of town visitors here because it seems like a nice, unpretentious place, with clean flavors. This has always been what I associate to Bannock. Unfortunately, the quality of the restaurant has continued to dip. Each of the last few times, I always think I should consider not coming back again.

This time, I would rate the food as a 2 or a 3, and service a clear 0. I've averaged it out and hence the 1 star review. 

The service...was regrettable. We arrived at the restaurant and asked for a table. We were told it would be 15 minutes. We waited 15 minutes and watched others come in, ask for tables and get seated. We accepted the possibility that maybe they had reservations or maybe their parties were larger and needed to be seated before us. That's all before we heard others ask for tables (i.e., they likely didn't have a reservation) but still get seated before us. Ten minutes after our fifteen minute wait expired, I walked up to ask how much longer we needed to wait. The hostess wasn't there, so I stood at the counter to wait, and two ladies came in and stood next to me, not at the counter though. One of the hostess came back a few minutes later and, instead of asking me if I've been helped, proceeded to help the other two. I'm not sure I follow the logic of not helping the person in front of the counter first. A few more minutes later, she finally asked me how I could be helped, and proceeded to tell me that it would be another few more minutes before our table would be available... when the other hostess came back and said oh we could be seated now actually. The best part is when we walked into the seating area, we found it had plenty of tables that were available. I get that restaurants have to stagger people so that the kitchen isn't hammered with too many orders... But at least don't make us wait if they aren't able handle the \"crowd\".

Our waitress doesn't find us for another five to ten minutes. And when she came, she had an accent, making it hard for us to understand what she was saying. Being ESLs ourselves, we tried to figure out what she was saying without being rude... But over the course of the evening, we noticed that her accent faded each of the next three times she came to our table. After \"telling\" us the specials, the waitress went away and came back maybe give to ten minutes later...Without really knowing the specials because we couldn't understand her, and thinking let's get quick items because we're hungry, we placed orders for soup, appetizer, main and side that we were going to share so that we weren't going to wait all night... Boy were we wrong. After we ordered, we checked in on Yelp, chatted a little bit... and then a little bit more... and then for what seemed like an eternity. We start poking fun at how heavy our eyes and heads felt and took turns holding each others head up so that we don't fall asleep face down on the table.

We started taking about how it's been at least thirty minutes since we ordered, then I realized we could see when we checked in to know for sure... Forty minutes!!! The whole time, no one came by our table, the water glass was empty, no signs of our food any where... We managed to flag the hostess as she walked by with more guests to ask, and she sent the waitress over (who's now speaking with a normal accent). And she says that our order will be next out, but it's been slow because of the large party over there. I peaked over to see a table with ten folks... nothing overly large. Another few minutes go by, and I see she comes from the kitchen with some food... I thought \"finally!\" But no, she walked towards the large table and I thought \"What??!!\" But then she passes them giving me a glimpse of hope that she'll double back towards us... That shattered when she stopped at the table behind us. So much for telling us that our order will be \"the next out.\"

Eventually our food arrived, unapologetically.

While I'd like to say it was worth the wait, it was not necessary so. The ginger soup tasted like baby food.. And not gingery at all. Everything was overly salty...yowzas. The fries were strangely overly greasy, undercooked on the inside, but almost burnt on the outside. I'm not sure I've ever experienced fries like that before. The main I had was decent (artic char), but the fish was a little over. I thought there would be quinao with it, but it was a consume with quinao crumbles over it... And yes, it was a bit overly salted too.

The kicker... When the meal was done, we sat and waited a while for the table to get cleared and then waited a while for our bill to come. While we waited, other tables around us got cleared. But then instead of the bill coming to us first, it went to the other tables. By the time it came to us, it was actually thrown on the table...After it clanged, I contemplated maybe not tipping at all...ugh.

*never coming back again*"}
{"text":"I haven't been one to write reviews before, but I eat at different restaurants a fair bit, so I thought I should start. Came here with a friend on Friday evening. It was both of our first times at Bannock and we were excited to try the menu. Place was quite empty. It took me a while to realize that the restaurant was attached to the Bay, hence passerby behind the windows. 

Starting with the positives, service was impeccable. Our waiter could be in a TV commercial - he was very expressive and seemed to have memorized the descriptions of every item. He also checked up on our food appropriately and made sure our water glasses were always filled. 

On to food, I ordered the fish & shrimp cake on our waiter's recommendation. My friend got the chicken pot pie. Presentation for the cake was excellent. Unfortunately, that was about the only thing I was impressed with. My dish had likely been sitting out for a bit because it was on the colder side of warm. I figured it was because they started making our dishes at the same time, and the pot pie takes longer to make (my friend's pot pie was piping hot). One stab into the cake and it would immediately crumble into flakes. Cake was bland. Very bland. I didn't particularly mind this since I usually don't even use salt when cooking, but I can see it being a problem for some others. The cake came onto of a bed of arugula and kimchi potatoes. Potatoes are delicious. Kimchi is excellent. Combining the two made it unpalatable. 

My verdict: For the price, there are definitely better options in the area. 

Note: I woke up in the middle of the night with food poisoning. Vomiting, diarrhea, nausea, and abdominal cramps lasting well over 12 hours. I contacted the manager who took down the details. I've tried to make the above review as objective as possible based on my thoughts before the food poisoning, since I can't confirm that it was due to the restaurant meal. But subconsciously, this unpleasant experience is definitely a strong reason why I am reluctant to come back here again."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was nice, it was cozy yet still upbeat. The servers were friendly, and attentive. The food was good, but nothing really spectacular. A good variety, and portion sizes were perfect for me (though my portions tend to be less than normal). The prices were alright, though bar drinks were questionable."}
{"text":"We stopped in for dinner on a family trip. This place caught my eye on Yelp because of its eclectic variety of dishes. My husband had the Charred Tomato Beef Curry and Duck Fat Potatoes. I had the Blackened Octopus, and my son had a kids order of mac & cheese and shared an order of cornbread with dad. The grownup entrees were so flavorful. My husband even liked the cornbread, which is usually not his cup of tea. Overall, the service and the food was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Should be 3.5, but this is not possible. Have been dying to come here for ages...service was the best part of the experience. Our server was super friendly, the model for great service, he was a little goofy and very attentive, but not obnoxious. Our waters were always full too! 

I had the duck poutine pizza, it was okay. I personally think poutine fries should be crispy and not soft and cheese should be gooey and not congealed...overall a big disappointment. But the pizza was crispy and the serving ample, easily intended for two...or three. 

My friend had the marguerita pizza which he said was good, not great (but he's old school Italian, so I consider this pretty good). 

Glad I came, but I don't know if I'll be coming back too soon."}
{"text":"I was in a rush and did a grab and go. By 2  pm there was only one sandwhich left in the grab and go display - Italian sub. Now this seems pretty plain and basic but I was hungry so got it. It was heated up thoroughly and wrapped in foil. After tax it was over $9 and yes it's pricey but it is SO CRAZY GOOD! I'm serious. the bread was nice and toasty with excellent texture, the cheese was oogey, the olive tapanade was flavorful but not overly salty, the meat was delicious. I was suppose to eat half and save the other half for my friend but let's just say in this case, it was sandwich over friend. If they had another, I'd totally go back and get another one to patch the friendship but they were out...."}
{"text":"Karen was super helpful and walked us through the menu. She recommended the poutine fries with duck added because we wanted the taste of the duck poutine pizza but \"without all the carbs\"(the girlfie). Also had the kale Caesar salad. Was good but the crackers tasted a little stale. The rabbit pasta special was on point, licked the plate."}
{"text":"My father and I had a great time here. We ordered the regular burger and the duck poutine pizza. The burger was really delish and the poutine was OUT OF THIS WORLD. If you want to try really unique combinations of food bannock will make sure you are full! The staff is good and really knowledgeable about the items on the menu. The place can get really busy and it can be sometimes really hard to have conversations because it's like everyone is screaming at each other. Overall, can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"Not going to lie, I only came here to get the Estrella Dam for the Winterlicious contest lol 

First impression of Bannock is that the place is way smaller than I thought it would be. And it's a little weird that you can see into the bay while you're dining. I don't know, dining experience really matters for me and it kind of felt like my friend and I were elbows to elbows with the table next to us. 

I certainly won't be craving anything I tried but the food was good, one of the better winterlicious restaurants I've tried for sure. 

Definitely recommend: 
-pear salad (really good, it was tangy but not too much. I really liked it) 
-duck leg (very juicy, highlight of the meal)
-rice pudding (has granola its at the top, very fragrant and tasty)

Those are totally not the names of the dishes at all but they were really yummy and that's all I really remember about them. Don't know if I would come back but I say it's worth a try"}
{"text":"This is mostly a review for the drinks:

Argh, so disappointing! We came out of our way to try the Mighty Canuck, which I anticipated from the description to be a delightful maple syrup-esque cocktail. It tasted almost exactly like a tart lemonade. Could barely taste any vodka or maple. There was a bit of maple goodness in the sugar rim, but that was pretty much it. So annoyed that we paid $9 for a lemonade.

My partner ordered the fresh peach juice for $5. Again a disaster. Tasted exactly like canned peaches in liquid form.

I will say that the bannock bread appetizer with hummus was quite tasty and interesting, but I don't think I'd return here for other items. Service wasn't very good either."}
{"text":"Our waiter was extremely friendly and attentive. Disappointed by the mushroom gnocchi due to quantity and was a bit too salty."}
{"text":"I kicked off my Summerlicious here for lunch. Chose to do lunch because the dinner and lunch menu didn't seem too different for the ten dollar price difference. I started out with the crispy cabbage salad and my friend had the cold ceaser soup. His soup was pretty but a cold bloody mary minus the alcohol in a bowl. It wasn't impressive, my salad was much better than his soup. 

For our entrees we ordered the peameal bacon melt and the fish pie. He definitely got the better entree, the size of his ham sandwich was huge!!! It was pretty good for a mundane ham and cheese type sandwich. It looked and tasted way better than my DINKY excuse of a fish pie. The only thing interesting about this pie was that the top was similar to lid, so you had the pie bowl and then a cute little lid. May be that was a sign that I should have tossed the top like a frisbee and not eaten it! The pie crust was extremely buttery to the point it made me nauseous, and the heavy creamy fishy filling made me sick after the meal. It simply was not enjoyable. 

The dessert was a doughy deep fried apple flavoured odd shapped ball, called the apple fritter, again wasn't impressed and just wanted my bill and leave."}
{"text":"I had lunch at Bannock for the first time with a friend I haven't seen in a long time. Having both been in the service industry we are very particular and wanted a smooth flawless experience and that is exactly what we got. To start with the food was delicious! I enjoyed the veggie bannock and my friend had the turkey burger and after trying both I can't wait to come back here next time I'm in Toronto. Most of all I'd like to credit our waitress Holly. Holly was very informative and described each item we asked about in detail, which made it harder to decide! After asking us some questions we asked her to decide on our entrees for us and we loved both items. Although the wine list was limited, Holly managed to help us find a wine we both liked. All in all we had a great time catching up at your restaurant and hopefully get the same great service and food the next time we are there."}
{"text":"We went there for brunch and the experience was sadly disappointing! 
Food (Eggs Benedict) was good, but I expected more for the price. It's very crowded on weekends during brunch time but the loud music AND the people talking right beside you make your conversation with your friends very difficult. 
On top of that, we had the crappiest service from our waitress. She obviously wanted us to leave as soon as possible by almost throwing the separate bills on our table WITHOUT a word. And Bannock expects me to tip that kind of service?! 
Toilets are filthy and they are being cheap on water pressure. 
Not a good place to have a relaxing time on weekends!"}
{"text":"Because everyone has to come here once for their roast duck poutine pizza.

Unfortunately, the pizza was just alright.  Sure we all love a thin crust pizza with cheese curds falling off, but the combination of everything comprising the topping was a little overwhelming.  I ended up eating the fries separately for the slices that I had, and I barely tasted the duck pieces because of how many other ingredients were on the pizza.  It's like one of those school projects where the idea is nice, execution could even be effortless, but final result, underwhelming.

Miheer's Curried Lamb Shoulder- Didn't see the curry in the description and expected a chunk of lamb shoulder.. what a flavourful dish though!  It was a very creamy curry with a hint of spice, the lamb was well-cooked and I LOVED the garlic roti that the curry came with.  It was a bit oily but I loved how chewy the roti was and balanced the curry nicely.  Almost wished we didn't have the pizza to start so that I could enjoy more of this dish, definitely a fan.

Service was good, decor is worth a look.. O&B does it well :)"}
{"text":"I came here for brunch and ordered the Eggs Bannodict with spinach. The eggs were served on slice of pizza. The food was delicious and the idea was creative but it wasn't easy to eat the eggs on the pizza slice. The service was friendly and the ambience was good as well. Would love to come here for dinner next time."}
{"text":"Stopped in at Bannock with a friend that visiting from out of town. We both had the cream of mushroom soup to start which was really good...

My Entree was the Lamb Shoulder Roti which I would recommend. It had a bit of a kick to it and was very flavourful.

My dinner companion ordered the Samosa entree (which I didn't know there was such a thing). I tried a little of the samosa, it had a Mexican twist to it with added guacamole and sour cream. It was good, but I'm not sure I would want it as an entree. It was more of an app type thing.

The Roti was so big, I didn't have room for dessert...."}
{"text":"Duck Poutine Pizza - a monstrosity, but an awesome deal (only 20 after tax!)

It's not as much a pizza as it is a mountain of duck poutine on a flour tortilla - the crust was extremely thin and dwarfed by the thickness of the poutine covering it.

Try it at least once!"}
{"text":"Wanted poutine to go while I was in the city. I stopped by and wished I had eaten it in the restaurant. The restaurant was very modern and comfortable inside. I  ordered to go from a very nice man. The poutine took no longer than 10 minutes. The poutine was good, however there was a lot of rosemary on top which changed the overall flavor. (not so good if you aren't a fan of rosemary) Also when the poutine was reheated, the fries get a funky taste so it's better to eat as soon as you get it!"}
{"text":"I've come to Bannock a couple of times and every time it has been alright. Decent service and food, nothing exceptional though. Food is definitely comfort food and often deep-fried or very heavy."}
{"text":"Consistently good food here.  I've been here a handful of times and I've always had a good meal....to be honest I've only ever ordered the Bannock BLT, it's amazing!  Bacon is thick cut, bread is their special recipe, all in all very delicious."}
{"text":"I liked this place for their duck poutine pizza. Got it again last night and it was a disappointment because they changed it. Before you would get fries with lots of duck, cheese and sauce. Now there is hardly any sauce, not as much duck meat, less fries and they added green onions and some other herb (thyme, basil, something like that) which really throws off the taste. What they had before was much better tasting."}
{"text":"First time here and it was because the other restaurant I originally wanted to go to had a private event. Nonetheless, it was nice to finally try Bannock. Overall, nothing really special in terms of service, food and atmosphere. I ordered the mac and cheese which was a nice twist with the mushrooms but nothing that really wow-ed me. I didn't think it was really worth the price. My friend ordered the noodles and soup of the day and wasn't a big fan either."}
{"text":"Came here a second time and I still love this place! I ordered the Bannock Bannock again which is still delicious but I feel like this time they made it fatter. Also, the first time they didn't fold it so I had to guess how to eat the thing and I guess right because the second time I went, they folded it in half.

Also had the mac and cheese which I really enjoyed. Would I order it again? Probably not but it's something worth trying.

I tried their parsnip soup which was good. The main reason why I ordered it was because of the pumpkin seeds in the soup. I was disappointed with the pumpkin seed because I thought they were going to make the seed crispy but it was too soft for my liking. The soup itself was delicious.

The sweet potato fries here are good but they added too much salt. I enjoy my sweet potato fries with a bit of salt and pepper because I think it enhances the sweet taste but they went a bit overboard with the salt.

The roast duck poutine pizza was a disaster in my opinion. I never really enjoy poutine pizza but with that aside, the duck was way to dry. The fries reminded me of KFC fries (nothing wrong with that for those who like KFC fries but I don't like KFC fries). I guess I'm not the kind of girl that enjoys just putting anything on her pizza.

For dessert, I tried the smore's and it's not that great. The graham cracker was a bit soggy and there wasn't enough of it. It reminded me of a lava cake. Go for the tart if you're craving dessert.

Another highlight of the meal was the Mighty Canuck. I absolutely love that drink! The glass is sugar rimmed and there's a sugared orange chocolate candy on top of the drink. I also tried the Back Forty (I think that's what it's called) and there's too much cucumber taste in that.

Service was still great, they refilled our water whenever it was half full and took away empty plates. Also, they didn't charge me for the Back Forty and kindly replaced it with the Mighty Canuck."}
{"text":"Loved the food - esp the duck poutine pizza, could live without the chicken pot pie. Cream of mushroom soup was good. Loved the smores dessert, perfectly gooey brownie, a little too much for one, sharing would be perfect! Server was quite rude, expected better service."}
{"text":"My salad was very good as well as the fries. The grilled cheese my colleague had was da bomb. House wine was pleasant as well - nice atmosphere"}
{"text":"Overrated - decent food, highly overpriced. Nothing exciting about the menu even considering that we had the promotional winterlicious menu. Starters: salted cod mash with chips (tasted fine), pea soup with beef (average soup with a sliver of meat) Mains: steak tacos (chewy steak, handmade shells were too thick), pork chili (nothing special) Dessert: sticky toffee pudding (way too sweet), sheep milk cheese with pear (cheese was really good but probably sourced from somewhere else). Service was absolutely terrible. It took over 45 minutes for us to get our mains and he didn't refill our water until we specifically asked."}
{"text":"I was downtown the other night and after walking past this place for a while I decided to finally check it out and I wasn't disappointed. I ordered the tortilla soup and the grilled cheese sandwich.

The soup was amazing, super tasty and pretty hearty. If you got the large I'm sure it could be a meal. The grilled cheese has some thinly slices apples in it and it was a good touch and gave the sandwich a different taste making it different from all the other grilled cheese sandwiches I've had. The sandwich was HUGE! It was full of cheese and super filling. 

The poutine here looked delicious so I'll definitely be back here to try that because I love poutine i can consider myself a poutine expert. 

The atmosphere of the restaurant is really nice and Id recommend it to anyone looking for somewhere to eat in the downtown core. The wait staff was friendly, I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I came here with a group of 4 for lunch Winterlicious 2014 and it was a terrific meal, and I would definitely consider coming back for brunch or another Winterlicious meal.

For the appetizer, I got the Black Barley & Piccalilli Salad with Sugar Beet Hummus, Rutabaga, and Dukkah Spice. The dish was quite pretty and colorful, but the variety of textures was really the star of the show. The smooth beet hummus, paired with the pearls of barley had a nice texture contrast, and the thin rutabaga on top gave it a nice crunch. The center of the salad was where you could find the piccalilli (Indian style pickled vegetables, like cauliflower and broccoli). It was a really fun and interesting salad. I also had a taste of the Habitant Pea Soup with ham hock, and it had a nice smokey flavour.

For my main, I got the White Fish Cake. It was surprisingly really fluffy and creamy, and I really think the texture was spot on once again. It came with some housemade tartar sauce, and some crunchy elements like radish and coleslaw on the bottom. Also expect a few string beans on the plate. It wasn't a large dish, but it was quite nice and I don't regret ordering it. My girlfriend got the pig and chips (pork shoulder and fries). If you are really hungry that might be the way to go, but my thought was that you can get pork and fries anywhere.

Lastly for dessert I had the Bannoffee Cake with screech caramel. The caramel was yummy, and was definitely the best part of the dessert. Others at the table got the Cheesy Chocolate Cannoli, and I'd say the Cannoli had a little more wow factor. So if I was there again, I would get that one.

Overall, I really liked the vibe of the restaurant. It has upscale food, but at the same time had a family friendly vibe as it was a little loud, but not too loud. My friends had their baby there, and it was loud enough that his crying didn't disturb other tables. I really enjoy the little touches of humble Canadian dishes in the menu. The Native American inspired Bannock, the Nfld Screech Caramel, the Quebec Habitant Soup, the Lake Huron White Fish. It's these flares of Canadiana that really set the place apart from other restaurants, and would keep me coming back."}
{"text":"Ordered the Margherita pizza. A classic that they got right. Service when busy is very slow."}
{"text":"We had reservations for 8pm on Thanksgiving day. They were running extremely late on seating people. We had to wait for 8:45 and still couldn't get a seat at the dinner room. The food was worth waiting for.  We had the turkey dinner. It was delicious. The mushroom soup very tasty too. We also had an order of the fish and shrimps cake and is was definitely a hit. Will go back to eat this again. The server we had, Nicholas, was simply amazing and very attentive. :)"}
{"text":"Duck Poutine Pizza! 

What more can I say? 

Was recommended to this restaurant by the couple my fiance and I were getting dinner with. The couple is getting married soon and actually set this place as their wedding food caterer! My fiance and I knew this place HAS to be good and can't wait to try it.  As couples, we each shared a duck poutine pizza. We also ordered the fish donut appetizer and split it 4 ways. I wasn't too crazy about this dish so I saved room for the pizza instead. The caramelized onion and fries on the pizza.. what a delightful flavor profile! A good amount of duck but i'm not a big meat eater.. i would trade it for more caramelized onion any day. For desserts, we ordered butter tart and s'more pie? The s'more pie was sooo rich and I got chocolate-ed out fast. The butter tart on the other hand.. i can totally eat.. a dozen of these babies! The pie crust was amazing.. and warm sticky center. YUM

A great dining experience. Hope to return to try other amazing dishes in the future!"}
{"text":"Nah! Not going there again! Service, food and price have no match!
I ordered a pizza and a drink. The pizza was like just another frozen pizza, all I could taste was salt. ingredients did not have any taste of their own. 
There is no table service, but a wealthy tip is expected. I had to get up every time either to ask for water or for cutlery or for condiments. The servers would keep ignoring you!
Later, when I wanted to take my leftover pizza, they did not have a pizza box. It seemed as if taking leftover home is frowned upon (or maybe this was the way one of their servers behaved)."}
{"text":"Great place and good with kids. Service outstanding.  Duck pizza and pork shoulder were standouts."}
{"text":"This place is underrated.  Didn't think much of it when passing by.  The place is separated by dining room and cafe.  Food extremely delicious.

Atmosphere 3/5
Food 4/5
Location 5/5

Duck Poutine (~@16$) was HUGE, more then enough for 3 ppl. 5/5 (would order again).
Ceaser Salad (~@8$) (def would order again) - amazing flavours for a ceaser. best ever. 5/5

I would return more often if possible."}
{"text":"This place has a great atmosphere! The decor is beautiful, the food is good, and the staff are nice and fun. I had the broiled eggplant and tomato gnocchi, and at first I tried it and was unsure. But that bite has nothing to do with the whole dish because every bit following was great. There bannock bread box was also good. And let me tell you, I tried a friends roast duck poutine pizza, and OH. MY. GOD. It may sound weird but it was sooo good! It's definitely something you need to share because it is a lot, but it was fantastic! The service was slightly slow at the beginning but we were a big group so I think they were letting us take our time. But honesty, lots of great options and great atmosphere, go if you have the chance!"}
{"text":"The Turkey burger is amazing (2 stars). The eggplant hummus wrap is a disaster since it had an awful smell (think of the rotten smell one gets when they leave the hummus on the kitchen counter for 2 days!). The disgusting eggplant hummus wrap led to the disastrously low rating for this place! This is typical of O+B craphole establishments in Toronto."}
{"text":"Restaurant located in Hudsons Bay, make sure to make reservations even for week day lunches. 

I settled with the Roast Duck Poutine after seeing almost everyone around me ordering it. It is definitely sharable, or even for 2 if you're looking for a heavier snack, but not really a meal.

Our server took our order soon after we arrived at the table and the food came within a reasonable amount of time. I appreciate restaurantsin downtown that try to speed things up but not rushing anything, especially during lunch hours on a work day. Bannock gives the exact feeling and pace.

The food itself is layed out like a pizza style, with a base and duck poutine as \"toppings\". Delicious, but heavy. I was only able to finish half of it."}
{"text":"After seeing some great pictures posted here about the duck poutine pizza, I've finally taken the plunge. As I arrived with my hot date, we were both seated promptly as it was just beginning to get real busy. Atmosphere was very modern and hipster which I had no problems with. 

Went straight ahead and placed the order for food. Ordered the duck poutine pizza and the chicken pot pie. Food arrived quickly and it came together. 

First: Duck Poutine Pizza
Immediate reaction was that there is a generous amount of fries, I wasn't complaining as it looked mouth watering. Had to use a fork to eat of some of the poutine before I dug in with my hands. The duck in combination with everything was splendid. If there's a tip I'd like to share, it would be to fold the sides of the pizza slice and to eat it like a sandwich to really get the maximum experience. This is definitely a pizza I don't mind paying the price for!

Second: Chicken Pot Pie
Was served with the mash. Nothing special about this dish. The flakey exterior was nice but the mash was just....mash. 

Service was very attentive, so I was in and out of there quickly."}
{"text":"Woohoo, my first five star review!
I came here for dinner last night with my best friend, and I already can't wait to go back!!

I had the turkey burger - the patty was thick and REALLY flavourful, and everything went very well together. Our server told us it was voted Toronto's best turkey burger!
My friend got the Bannock Bannock - a bit salty for my taste but still pretty good.
We were extremely full by the time we had finished our mains, but we had heard too many good things about the dessert to skip it, so we decided to pick one and share.
Our dilemma was, we wanted to get the butter tart but also the daily special, the basil froyo (BASIL and froyo?! I know, seems odd) and we couldn't decide.
Upon mentioning this to our server, he told us he'll bring us the butter tart and just one scoop of the basil froyo on the side (w/ no charge) so that we could taste it!
Whaddaya know, Basil and froyo DO go really well together after all, and need I even mention how good the butter tart was? The raving reviews do it complete justice. Its warm filling was sweet and delicious, and it was just the right amount of buttery. The pairing of it with the froyo was wonderful!

What set Bannock apart for me, was the incredibly friendly and attentive waitstaff.
I wish I had gotten the names of the two waiters that served us so I could mention them here!
Waiter #1 was so friendly, joked around with us, recommended food from all over Toronto (due to the basil froyo daily special, we got into the subject of frozen yogourts and he told us we have to try the Blueberry Basil Froyo at Soma Chocolatemaker in the summer - time to go bookmark it!), and was all around extremely pleasant. 
Waiter #2 was the one going around filling up the water glasses, and I've never seen a more smiley person filling up glasses! I felt we overstayed our welcome since we chatted for a bit after paying the bill. Normally we would have gone somewhere else to catch up and chat, but it was late, we were stuffed, and exhausted from a busy work day. However, he made sure our glasses were always full, and made us feel welcome.

Overall, a fantastic experience!"}
{"text":"After Gord and I checked out Old City Hall for Doors Open, we had an early supper at Bannock.

Gord started with Salt Cod Donuts.  So pretty!  He liked them and said he'd get them again.

He also had Atlantic Haddock and Shrimp Cake and Fries.  He also liked this and said he'd get it again.

I ordered Chili Chicken Pad Thai, minus the cabbage.  It came with cabbage, though, so I took it off.  The pad thai was tasty ... except there wasn't a lot of chicken but there were a lot of beans (the server said they'd be ground plus I wasn't expecting green beans, which I hate), tofu (I wasn't expecting tofu and don't like it) and egg.

The menu items are different so it's an interesting place to check out."}
{"text":"(This review is for the Summerlicious 2014 dinner)
I had pretty low expectations for this place after reading the Summerlicious menu. The entrees didn't seem spectacular and there was a pretty big discrepancy in price between lunch ($15) and dinner ($25) even though the menu was mostly identical. 

Reservations were easy to make although the hostess made an error with the number of seats we wanted. My dining companion was quite shocked to hear that our reservation was mistakenly made for 18 instead of the agreed-upon 2. 

Fast forward to dinner: 
The location is great and if you live in Toronto, you've most likely walked bast the restaurant multiple times. The inside is narrow but had comfortable seating. I loved the rustic decor and the novelty moose behind our seats. Free wifi is definitely welcome since you can always escape to your phone if your dinner partner turns out to be a dud. 
I ordered the smoked salmon and beet salad which was delicious and my favourite part of the three course meal. My entree was a korean pizza (simple but great) which I could only eat half of, although I was absolutely ravenous. Dessert was an apple fritter with dulce de leche, a perfect and not too heavy way to end the meal. I tasted my friend's bread pudding dessert which wasn't nearly as good as the apple fritter. 

I can't wait to come back and devour the duck poutine pizza."}
{"text":"Went here for Friday dinner. Bannock is a beautifully decorated restaurant in the Bay building. It is named Bannock after the Scottish flat bread.

We started with the bannock box. It was okay. I guess I am not a fan of dry flat bread, but it came with a nice dipping sauce. I ordered the cod chowder with a side order of Yukon gold potatoes. It was very good and delicious. My friend order the flat iron steak. She liked it a lot.

The service was friendly and he was very patient since we took a long time to order. The washrooms were okay. The only problem was that the washrooms were at end of the restaurant near the other entrance and a homeless man walked in to use them.

Would we go back? No reason not to."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend this past Wednesday for dinner. Ordered a poutine to share as a starter, Mac and cheese for my main and my friend got the chef's daily special (half chicken dinner). 

Unfortunately, the chicken was not cooked. It was bleeding and pink. We sent it back to the kitchen. Casual apology from the server. To our surprise, the kitchen just recooked the same piece of chicken and sent it back on a new plate. In attempts to mitigate or cover the dryness of over cooked chicken, the kitchen squirted gravy onto it. Quite disappointing, a restaurant that is charging this kind of price for a meal would go about these methods to fix their errors. Serving undercooked chicken and then follow it up with an over cooked cut up piece of chicken sounds a bit surprising from an O&B restaurant. If this was Michael Bonacini on masterchef and his home cooked served that up.....he would've chucked the chicken in the garbage and at least given the guest a new meal. To top it off, no real formal apology, we were essentially hustled out of the restaurant as soon as we finished our plates.

Make sure you check your meat before consuming it! My only regret is that I forgot to take a picture of the bleeding chicken to post it on my review.

Update Mar13/18- ending up sending the restaurant an email. They gave a follow up call and will be looking at reviewing service standards. Hopefully this will not happen to future customers!"}
{"text":"Bannock has the right combination of comfort food and modern cooking and has become my family's go-to restaurant for meals downtown. I've been to Bannock three times since they've opened, and with at least 4 at the table every time have managed to sample a good chuck of their menu. 

The tourtiere, the venison chili and the pork shoulder are stand-outs on the menu. And so is the bannock itself. All of the entrees are filling but sensible and not giant American-style portions. The only dish that was disappointing were the pickerel tacos which were more sandwich wraps and only vaguely resembled tacos. The chicken pot pie and the lobster roll  were executed just fine but nothing stood out. The duck poutine pizza is an interesting jest but would have been a much better meal done separately instead of combined.

As mentioned in other reviews the service is a little too intense at times. It's a better option than not being able to flag a waiter at all but the busser with the water seemed like a permanent fixture at my elbow and over my shoulder.

So many restaurants around the financial district seem to be closed for lunch on weekends. This cements Bannock as the place to bring weekend visitors to the Eaton Centre, the Canadian Opera Company, or anything else in the area."}
{"text":"Food: 3.5
Service: 1/5
Ambiance: 3.5/5

Came here for winterlicious dinner. We made our reservation at 6:30, arrived 2 minutes late, and was told that it would take 5 minutes to get our table ready. We ended up sitting down at 6:45. That was not a problem, I understand that it's hard to predict when customers would leave. However, we were seated at our table without any water and service for 10 minutes. I gestured towards our waitress several times, and she acknowledged me back but never came to our table. We asked another server for water and afterwards he went to go get our servers attention. After another 5 minutes, our server, Rebecca, finally came to our table without a smile and looked like she was annoyed more than friendly. She directly asked whether we were ready to order and didn't even bother to apologize for her attitude. Throughout dinner, she carried an expressionless face and put in minimal effort to serve us. 

The food was made up for our terrible customer experience though! The smouldered pork shoulder was very succulent and well flavoured, and the oyster haddock lasgnetti was such a surprise! Dessert is so fulfilling, I really loved the sticky toffee pudding.

The mood of the restaurant was casual and chic, conversation was carried out comfortably.

Overall experience was worse than average. But the food was pretty good and somewhat made up for the bad service."}
{"text":"After three failed attempts to eat here, i finally made it without having to cancel last minute!

The decor is fun, the location is great, the service is excellent. The menu is good. 
In general, i found the food to be a touch bland, but excellently prepared and very thoughtful. The Tuna and the Lamb are my favorite. The choice of starch and accompaniments on the plate definitely elevate the experience. 
A pleasant surprise and star was the daily tomato soup special which was unexpectedly robust and so full of complex flavours (yes i am comparing my soup to a wine here).
As many people have pointed out, the butter tart at this place is a must. The very fact that fireweed honey (which is so rare to find) is an ingredient makes it all the more worth it. 

I'm definitely going back here. But i think given the location and ambiance, this is a lunch rather than dinner place for me."}
{"text":"Finally came back to give this place another try after a fairly bad experience a few years ago. I came with a group of friends. I'm raising the rating to three stars for Bannock.

The service was good this time around, server was friendly and attentive. The food was only OK for me. Myself and a friend each ordered the Roasted Duck poutine pizza and they both came out cold. Another ordered a burger which also had issues with the temperature. The restaurant did take them back and remade them completely.

Overall the flavour was OK, but the portion for the pizza was huge. I had to pack it to go.

Overall I was satisfied with my meal but it came out to $30 for a poutine pizza, a lot more options at that price level."}
{"text":"Came here for the $25 Winterlicious Dinner fix prixe. Got the opportunity to try 6 different dishes because I went with another person. For those who don't know what Winterlicious is, it's an event where a set of restaurants offer special set of courses at a cheaper price than regular meals so people can try new restaurants.

I had the Winter Greens and Wheatberries with blue cheese, apples and tarragon. For my main I had the Griddled Pork Shoulder Steak with beer mustard, warm sherried lentils, collard greens, screeched prunes. Finally for dessert I had the Warm Sugar Beet and Chocolate Cake. My friend had the Curried Tamarack Pumpkin Soup, Oyster Mushroom Pizza with gouda cheese and onions, and for dessert she had the Moonshine Pannacotta.

Overall, the meals were pretty good. The pork shoulder was my favourite, not too salty and it was super tender and I loved the subtle additional flavour of the onions, mustard and the greens. The pork basically melted in your mouth. I also enjoyed the pumpkin soup because I love those vegetable thick soups because I haven't had it in a long time and reminds me of a friend who makes excellent squash soup that has almost the same texture. Finally, I enjoyed the mushroom-oyster pizza. I like how the cheese on it was gouda cheese so it was quite different from your typical pizzas and it was freshly made, the crust was thin and crispy. While the actual pizza itself was easy to cut and eat.

I'll definitely be back again to try this place again. The second O&B restaurant that I've ever been to and they don't disappoint!

The service is pretty good, there are a lot of servers and they always seemed to notice when my water was empty or when we finished a dish and took care of it accordingly."}
{"text":"Like all the other yelpers said, get the duck poutine pizza! It's definitely one of their more known dishes and it doesn't disappoint. Flavours are on point and unique. You probably wouldn't want to finish all of it yourself though. I split a third of the pizza with 2 other friends, and I was feeling quite satisfied already, so splitting this with your party may be a good idea.

I also tried the Bannock fried bologna..which comes with pita bread, potatoes, eggs, tomatoes, and.. fried bologna of course. The dish was interesting but I wouldnt get it again. Too much of a breakfast dish.. And while it was good, there honestly was just too many carbs there (pita, potatoes) and combined with eating the poutine pizza, I felt quite heavy. 

Bannock is a great environment - relaxed and modern, and situated in a great area (across from Eatons). I'd come back to try out their other dishes and some of the desserts ! And come back for that duck poutine pizza when I'm feeling not as healthy :P"}
{"text":"Good place
Great location
Good atmosphere
The Poutine Pizza is awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Came in for Sunday Brunch and If you want to try something new, go for the Roasted Duck Poutine Pizza! It was quite appealing and flavourful but it's a pretty heavy portion so it's best to share it with someone. My boyfriend ended up getting the (medium rare) Steak+Eggs and overall it was cooked deliciously and how he wanted it to be.

The restaurant is a bit outside of Eaton Centre and Nathan Philip Square so it's not a coincidence that it was crowded when we walked in. The hostess also seemed disinterested but the waiters made up for it with friendly service. 

The only problem we had with this restaurant was the LONG wait for the food. I guess it's understandable that there were a lot of customers inside the restaurant. But the waiters definitely filled us with water before we even got to touch the food.

I've also been here before for Summerlicious but I don't recall anything memorable."}
{"text":"Service: friendly, helpful, and nice, no complain

Drink: got the Chai Latte and Daily Squeeze (cactus pear juice) - both tasted good, and loved the cactus pear juice! Pretty pink coloured and a very refreshing scent too.

Food: came here for their brunch on a Saturday and ordered the Eggs Bannodict and Pouya's Shashuka. Both portions were quite big, tasted pretty good at first, but both dishes got very heavy near the end because of the high fat content from cheese, hollandaise, and oil, so we couldn't finish it all.

Also, the fried bannock bits that came with the Shashuka were very greasy and soggy, not crispy as I expected :(

Overall: might return if nearby and REALLY hungry and craving for some fatty foods! Also a good location to go shopping and other entertainment after food!"}
{"text":"A solid place for lunch and dinner. Good service. Just trendy enough. The sit down prices are better value than the sandwich salads."}
{"text":"it's typical oliver and bonacini... competent, consistent, nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times now and the service is always fantastic and attentive. The fairly limited menu comprises \"Canadian Comfort' dishes that never fails to impress. Mind you if they've had a busy day they might be out of certain dishes .. like salt cod donut appetizer. 

The Bannock bread is featured through out the menu from the pizza to the wraps. I've either had or sampled the pot pie, carne pizza, fish cakes, salads, and desserts. I've enjoyed them all....especially as leftovers as the portions are fairly large. Their fresh juices and lemonades with their unconventional blends are also quite delicious. 

They were baby friendly and made room for us to park the stroller though the bathrooms are definitely not baby friendly as there's no place to change a diaper. Definitely recommend making reservations though we've lucked out both times without making any. They also have a neat cafe and grab and go section. 

The decor is truly Canadian featuring antique pine and hemlock reclaimed from one of the Queen's wharfs that sat under the waters of Lake Ontario at York Street for over a hundred years (mentioned on their website). I'd definitely be going back ! 

We had two appys, three mains, 2 mocktails and a beer for $100 all in"}
{"text":"I've been dying to try Bannock since it opened and finally got the opportunity a few weeks ago. We made a reservation for dinner on a weeknight and when we arrived, it wasn't too busy but it was definitely filling up.

I have to say that I really like the look and decor of this restaurant; while I was there for an evening out with my friends, there was a table beside us that were clearly having a business meeting over dinner. It had some really nice architectural features and while it felt cozy, it still felt open with the windows facing out to the street and the windows that face into The Bay.

I was expecting a heavier dinner experience based on some of the other reviews for here, but I still wanted to get a good sense of what the food was like. We all agreed on splitting a poutine for the appetizer and I ended up going with the chef special, which was pulled pork tacos with \"the works\". 

The poutine was great, my one friend and I polished off most of it. Great flavor, just the right amount of cheese and gravy. I could have had two of those for dinner and called it a night. 

The tacos were surprisingly amazing - I wasn't really sure what I wanted when I arrived - I was tempted to try the mac and cheese but from what I've seen on here, the portion size is huge and its rather heavy. I wasn't really feeling like a comfort-food kind of meal so the chef special looked like a pretty good option. Nice small warm soft tortillas with pulled pork, guacamole, jalapenos and a whole lot of other stuff. There may have been onions and or tomatoes; it was so good that I didn't really stop to take a good look at what was in side. There were three tacos on the plate with a small cup of fresh salsa-ey-veggie mix - the tacos were maybe six inch rounds? So not huge and not difficult to handle either. They had quite a spicy kick to them but all of the flavors meshed together quite well and each bite was super flavorful. I was a tad disappointed with the salad that came on the side - it had yellow and red tomatoes, avocado and a few other things... the avocado pieces were a nice balance to the heat from the tacos but the rest of the mix just seemed kind of watery and lacking in flavor. I ate all the avocado out and left most of what else was there. 

I was a bit surprised at the portion sizes for everyone's entrees; one of my friends got the pickerel taco & apple-cucumber salad and the other one got the onion glazed pork shoulder with spaetzel. The pickerel-taco dish didn't look like it had very much food on the plate but I think it was sufficient - the pork was a decent sized plate and I did get to try the spaetzel and it was delicious. However, I think that looks are deceiving. My dinner didn't LOOK very large when it came to the table but it was a good size for dinner and it wasn't overpowering. 

We were all still just hungry enough to try out the Warm Smores Pie, which was AMAZING. I mean, you can't go wrong with chocolate and marshmallows but it was a really great balance of all the flavors. And it was gone pretty quickly so I'm sure my dining partners enjoyed it as well :)

The huge standout for me was the service we received at Bannock. Our server was just the right amount of attentive; I noticed in some of the earliest reviews that people felt the service was overbearing and that they were being interrupted during their meals. Our server got it bang on - he knew just when to stop by and ask if we needed anything or if everything tasted good, etc. He was friendly and rather funny but not in a forced way - it was refreshing to get such good service!

I definitely want to go back here and try out some of the dishes that they're known for, like the roast duck poutine pizza and the macaroni and cheese. I'll absolutely go back to Bannock again in future and if you're in the area and looking for some quality food with a nice but laid back environment, Bannock is just the ticket."}
{"text":"We chose this place while in Toronto because of its Yelp reviews and we we extremely pleased. Our wait staff were very cordial, friendly and helpful. I had the Blue Blue Pizza paired with a white wine. The flavor combination between the thin crust, blue cheese, grilled radicchio, pear and ham was robust yet not overpowering, an absolute delight. Prices were moderate."}
{"text":"Amazing food, not very expensive for brunch, and nice vibes inside the restaurant! I recommend the breakfast poutine and the eggs benny with salmon on bannock. Delicious! The staff is also extremely friendly."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place after seeing an Instagram post and boy it did not disappoint. Walked in (bear in mind it's a Tuesday) and was promptly seated with water in under 2 min. Our waiter was very nice and didn't mind answering a few question. He also lived up to his promise to never have our water empty refilling it multiple times. The duck poutine was great and definitely could be spilt in half and leave you satisfied, however we decided to try something light on the side as per recommended (Mac and cheese) and it was the perfect amount to leave you with some serious itis. Finished it off with s'mores pie which looked as good as it tasty. Would recommend! -"}
{"text":"We came here for the summerlicious menu. We had low expectations because the food at summerlicious are typically not that great but we were very surprised that it was tasty!  All the ingredients were fresh, my steak was marinated and cooked to perfection (medium rare). It was interesting that the steak was served with tortilla chips and guac.  Down thing different and I liked it.  My husband pizza was so very delicious.  

We really enjoyed our dinning experience here and would recommend their summerlicious menu."}
{"text":"Must try: Arcadian Court Chicken Pot Pie

Been here a number of times for lunch and it's been consistently meeting and exceeding expectations. It's casual dining for the hip and the professional... On one side you see the well-groomed men with their Macbook pros, and the other groups of accountamayben suits, it knows its demographics and it serves them well. Service is fast and wait staff attentive, decor is modern but not pretentious. It's a feel good place. 

The food is quite good as well. The chicken pot pie was creamy and comforting. The best dish I had was this beef cheek specialty (I don't think it's on the regular menu) and that was flavourful and extremely tender, with complementary sides as well. The duck poutine pizza is obviously a must try for the curious, it's quite a treat and definitely a creative addition to the menu. The venison and pork shoulder tortiere is quite meaty and maybe a little too gamey for me. But I like the root veggies that it came with. Not a big fan of the ketchup packets though... 

Overall a perfect restaurant for a work lunch... But maybe I shouldn't say in case it lowers my chance of getting a reservation when I need it...

{"text":"I had high hope after reading raving reviews here. Well, it was good but I found out nothing to be crazy about here. 

First, I got an impression that they don't like us. I was with my sister and my 10years old nephew. We arrived a bit earlier than the opening time. I told them I will move to the restaurant area when they open and sat in the cafe area with my sister and my nephew. I Ordered a muffin which was good while waiting. When they opened the restaurant area, the server asked us to sit in the cafe seat where we just left. It was not a dining area and I got an impression that they don't want my nephew to sit in their dining area. Well, though my kid was not screaming and running across the restaurant, but we were seperated from other mature customers. 
Second, the food that I ordered arrived a bit slow. I ordered a a pan of pizza, a steak with grilled potatoe and a poutine. Pizza was so so. Steak was just fine. I prefered the potatoe in the side wich was grilled with duck fat. And the poutine..... The portion was large, covered with bland gravy and cheese which was challenging to consume. It was my first time to try poutine, so I can't compare it with the best one but anyway I don't think I will try poutine again.  And in the end, after receiving the bill added with tax, I thought I won't recommend here to someone who likes to have tasty food with children in affordable price. But if you want to have date, looking for fancy place for meeting friends, this place will work well. But...no poutine for everyone."}
{"text":"I had the turkey burger and the duck poutine pizza that I shared with family. The pizza was alright, but the turkey burger needs some improvement. It was incredibly bland and a little on the dry side, not what you'd expect from a restaurant like this. The root chips that came with the burger should be seasoned with something more than just salt, because the taro itself has barely any flavour.

Another thing I don't like is that the minimum tip by card machine is 18%. I had decent service, but what if it was bad? I don't like being forced to pay X amount of tip. I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Dropped in for an attempt at a quick lunch before heading to a business meeting, so needed to get in and out without much delay. The kind gentleman at the restaurant side advised me that ordering off the menu at the deli counter was possible and likely faster. Plenty of seating on the deli side, too. I took his advice and ordered the pork belly sandwich and a salad with about 35 minutes until my meeting, which was just across the street. Though I sweated the clock, everything came in time and I enjoyed their Caesar's salad very much and the sandwich contents were quite good. I didn't eat the pita bread that the sandwich arrived blanketed in because I knew the carbs would knock me out, plus it turned out that the sandwich was h-u-g-e for one person and should have been for two people. While I was waiting for food I noticed they had cortado on their coffee menu and I ordered one. It was very good. The view out the front is really nice, with the municipal building across the street, which seems to be a city landmark. The staff were all friendly and kind and the prices reasonable."}
{"text":"I ate here for Winterlicious this week. All three courses were incredible and such a great value for $25!  

I had curried pumpkin soup to start, oyster mushroom/Gouda pizza and panna cotta for dessert. 

Such a warm and cozy atmosphere too!! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Two words - POUTINE PIZZA.  Portions are very large especially their duck poutine pizza which is a must get.  I also shared the benedict which came on a very large piece of flatbread so it was definitely an interesting take vs. the normal english muffin benedict but good nonetheless.  

The food was slightly dry but it was reasonably priced and service was very quick.  Solid brunch spot but definitely more on the casual side (there was a cafe area where you could pick stuff up to go I think)."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch on a whim. Had a very nice cod chowder, slightly under seasoned but overall very good. Great server. Place is a bit pricey, chowder and sparkling water was $27. Would come again"}
{"text":"Been here twice for lunch and both times enjoyed it.  It was crowded, but the service was attentive.  Last time I had the grill cheese and enjoyed it.  And the serving sizes are totally impressive.  I dragged along three friends and everyone, EVERYONE walked away completely satisfied.  And the server even took the liberty of bringing us all separate bills which was handy considering no one at the table enjoys figuring out the math.

It is something fairly decent when dining in that area."}
{"text":"My friend chose Bannock for a ladies dinner on a Monday night. Reservations were made with ease and a table for four was waiting for us when we arrived.

We started with the poutine to share - fries, curds and chicken gravy.  It was piping hot and satisfying.  For mains, I had considered the Lobster Roll ($16) but ordered the Chicken Pot Pie ($16) after seeing it arrive to several tables around us.  We also ordered the Flatiron Steak ($23), Whitefish and Shrimp Cake ($15), and the Boneless Back Rib Burger ($15).  

Food arrived hot and fresh.  The pot pie was a soothing warm entree with a lovely flakey top.  The steak was grilled to perfection and the rib burger had a nice smokey flavour.  The whitefish cake was a bit on the saltier side and possibly the weakest of the entree choices.  We also ordered a few glasses of wine all priced between $10-$14.

And then came dessert - butter tart, s'mores pie and sour cream doughnuts ($8/each).  The s'mores pie was amazing with the butter tart coming in at a close second.  I wasn't too keen about the sour cream doughnuts but that didn't stop me from shoving it down my gullet too.  This gave me a serious case of the dessert sweats.

Service was friendly and attentive.  We loved the decor of the room but it was a bit loud in there with tables placed quite closely together.

Bannock has got Canadian comfort food done right.  The meal made me want to come home, put on a Beaver Canoe sweatshirt and watch some re-runs of The Littlest Hobo or Beachcombers."}
{"text":"Sadly I did not have a very good experience here.  I went with 3 friends.  One had the Pizza Margarita, one the roasted halibut and one the pad thai.  I had the gnocchi.  My food was the most disappointing.  The portion for $18 - a full sized portion was miniscule.  it was the mushroom gnocchi.  It was tasty but tiny. It was appetizer size.  Who are they kidding?  

I will not go back.  The pizza and halibut were okay.  The pad thai was some North American version and boring."}
{"text":"My husband and I had the BLT Bannock.  It was tasty, but otherwise unexceptional.  We also had fries which were extremely good.  However, I had the Berry Mojito.  I didn't think I liked Mojitos.  I have changed my mind.  That was the best drink I have ever had.  The rum was smooth.  The berry flavor was yummy, and there was just enough mint flavor to make it refreshing.  I would go back to Bannock for that drink alone."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place.  I've been coming here for years.  It's one of my favourite restaurants downtown.  I have enjoyed everything I ever tried here and the service is always outstanding!  The fact that the Chef Darren has Ukrainian roots (like I do) doesn't hurt either.  

My go-to meal is always the Free-range turkey burger (without bun), although I refuse to forgo the onion ring, dill pickle mayo and the best taro chips in the world.  I could eat those all day long.  I should say I am not a fan of turkey burgers but I love this one and I feel that it is a healthier  option than some of the other comfort food on the menu (although the previously mentioned sides surely are not but you gotta live a little, right?).  

My lunch date yesterday ordered the black bean soup and samosa.  While I didn't try the soup (I regretted later since I love black bean soup), I had a bit of the samosas and found them to have a nice kick to them.  They were served on a bed of greens.  There was a lot going on on that plate - in a good way!

If you are looking for bland and boring food, don't come to Bannock."}
{"text":"Over the years, the Bay's Queen Street location has hosted some memorable dining options. In the heady days of the 1980s we had the \"SRO Oyster Bar\" and \"Bay Street Grille\". It was here that I first tried white chocolate. 

As expense accounts shrank, these spaces turned into \"Great Cooks on Eight\" and a street-level Timothys (although a better pairing of Canadian icons owuld have been a different kind of Tim's). There was also the soaring deco brilliance of the Arcadian Court, with its decent lobster club, death-by-comfort food chicken pot pie, and increasingly wizened lunch buffet. There was also the City View Cafeteria, where those of lesser means could still enjoy a palatable plate of roast beef and a great view of the bustling downtown. Many years ago, the basement held an absolute treasure of a place; a 50's-styled lunch counter, with cheap food and uniformed octagenarian waitresses who threatened to keel over into your rice pudding or chipped beef. It was awesome, even if the coffee was slightly older than the concept. 

For better or for worse, time marches on, and the Bay has now outsourced its dining options to Oliver and Bonacini Group. If you've ready my previous reviews (and why wouldn't you? You're here, aren't you? What could be more important?) you know that my relationdship with the O&B empire is complicated.. I'm occasionally dazzled, sometimes appalled, but most often left with a profound sense of 'meh' when I eat at one of their popular-priced restaurants. Bannock is no different. 

I'll say this up front: service is great. Attentive, friendly, and accommodating when I want to swap starches or sub a salad. Servers are invariably young, tattooed, and attractive in the sense that you stick around. Up-selling is minimal, although I would totally buy one of their \"map of Canada\" tshirts if my closet weren't full of WWE merch. 

Beverage options are varied; it's a great place if you're into teas, juices and other such infusions. I'm a coffee guy. Bannock's brew is strong and rich; just as I like it. 

In repeated visits, food follows the law of diminishing returns. My first meal is great. The table starts with a margarheta pizza on their signature flatbread. It is light and uniquley crusty; the bannock base a not-quite-fit for acidic tomato sauce and silky mozzarella. It is addictive, though.  Split pea soup is suitably smoky and proky; the peas cooked down just enough to retain a pleasant pop betwen the teeth. It needs less salt and more pepper. A rich tourtiere is studded with chunks of roast prok belly (I don't know why people just don't call it bacon). Sticky gravy gets soaked up by crispy, golden duck-fat fried potatoes (swapped out for too-sweet sounding honeyed roasted root veg). A bracing salad lets me pretend I'm eating healthy. A packet or two of Heinz ketchuup (the world's best and only ketchup worth buying), is a cute addition. A poutine pizza arrives at the next table, and poutine tout seul seems like a hit.. People rave about it. I never got the big deal. I'm sure it's great hangover food, or perfect for those who get inexplicably hungry a little before 4:30 PM, but at $16 for lunch or dinner, it seems like a betrayal of the concept. Pickerel tacos are more bao than taco, but pleasantly light. A syrupy-sweet cucumber salad detracts from the plate. Shrimp and white fish cakes are so full of aquatic life on one visit, they'd make the little mermaid cry, but on the next I'd be hard-pressed to discern a bit of shrimp for all their potato. I leave wondering why they didn't kjust call the buggers latkes and get it over with. 

It's a nice room, and a civilized break from a day of shopping. But not my retail-dining Rosebud."}
{"text":"I really was not impressed with the price/quality ratio, at least at the to-go counter. I got a bowl of venison chili and maple lemonade -- both were pretty standard except for the fact that it came out to $15+ and I didn't taste any maple... 

Service was great in that they quickly made another batch of chili (since they had just run out), but that did mean that I had to wait longer at the counter. I recognize that a lot of US publications name Bannock as a go-to place, but I'm not sure if I would return. 2.5 but am rounding up for service."}
{"text":"We made a winterlicious reservation last minute on a Friday night. Because of the bad experiences we had with winterlicious in general, we really set our bar low for Bannock.. which turned out to be ok. It's not a bad place to have a casual date or hang out with friends if you're nearby, however, I would not go out of my way to come back to Bannock. It's basically a cookie-cutter type chain restaurant you can find across the city like O&B. 

I ordered the winterlicious menu, it was very average. My fiance ordered the duck poutine pizza which everyone raved about... huge portion which is great for sharing but it didn't wow me to be honest, the base of the pizza was essentially a really thin flat bread/naan that tasted like it was bought from the store... and the duck meat was not fresh (unfortunately).
I liked the dessert the most, I think I ordered the sticky pudding... which i enjoyed dearly and it honestly saved my experience at bannock!

Extremely friendly staff which is why I am giving the restaurant 3 star instead of a 2 =)!

Service: 5/5
Ambiance: 4/5

Overall: 3/5"}
{"text":"Last week i was craving for a good chicken pot pie... So I called almost every place Google told me had cpp but they all said they didn't have it.... Then i came across Bannock

Hands down the best pot pie I've had in my life.
For $18 you get your delicious pot pie with a large spoon scoop of mashed potato. 

It was so creamy, and filling. The crust is just...... *drools 

I haven't tried anything else myself at Bannock but will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Bannock is the new O&B restaurant which opened up on the main floor of the Bay department store at the corner of Queen and Bay streets.

The restaurant space is HUGE and has both a take-out cafe/coffee shop to the right and a dine-in restaurant on the left hand side. There is a huge open kitchen in the middle so you can see the chefs in action.

I absolutely loved the decor here. It's very eclectic - I would call it \"modern Canadian\". Antique pine chairs, metal and marble all combined. The vibe was similar to the O&B Canteen at the TIFF (ie - relaxed/casual) but the space here is much larger and tables aren't cramped together.


What is most exciting is the menu. It's often difficult to describe typical Canadian cuisine, but by directing a tourist to Bannock, you can avoid the trouble of even trying. A truly well-rounded Canadian comfort menu, it includes soups, salads, burgers/sandwiches, noodle dishes and pizza creations baked on bannock (naturally).

They also have a good selection of meat and seafood main dishes (not too much for vegetarians, I'm afraid, but they did have a few options). Plus desserts!

My DC and I ordered a bannock bread basket ($6) to start out. Now, the last time I truly ate bannock was in 1989 inside a Native American teepee in the far reaches of Northwestern Ontario. As such, I cannot remember whether or not the \"bannock\" at \"Bannock truly looks and tastes authentic or not. But I was not awed with the bannock here - really it's just a plain flatbread and was kind of uninspiring.

Luckily, the rest of the food was all phenomenal! I had the pickerel tacos served with an apple cucumber salad. Only $11. These were delicious - fish was cooked and seasoned perfectly and served in a thick, chewy bannock-like bread rather than a normal tortilla. 

My DC had the ultimate comfort food - mac & cheese! ($14) This was delicious too, but very rich. Portion was large and a doggie bag had to be requested.

We shared a \"Smores Pie\" dessert ($8).  This was hands down the best dessert I have had in a long time. Not too sweet or heavy. Beautifully presented, a light graham cake bottom with dark chocolate cake-light center, topped with a toasted marshmellow top and drizzled with more dark chocolate. This is a must try! 

Price point at Bannock is very reasonable, with sandwiches/burgers ranging from $11-$16 and mains between $12-$23.

There was also a \"Canadian\" cocktail list with cocktails priced at $9 plus a reasonable beer & wine menu with wine starting at $32 a bottle.

The service here was top notch. Considering the restaurant only opened today, I didn't have high expectations. They obviously had lots of experienced staff on hand taken from the other O&B restaurants, because everything ran smoothly. Our server, Ryan, was attentive and polite and knowledgeable on the menu. The hostess was great too.

I expect Bannock will draw in lots of tourists as well as locals, given the location and the promise of delicious Canadian comfort food."}
{"text":"I went here for Winterlicious 2018 lunch ($23) and ordered the following: 
- Roasted Cauliflower Soup: the best part of the meal - so creamy and flavourful
- Squash Risotto: so-so, the fried kale on it was great, but the risotto was nothing special
- Master P's Rice Pudding: very filling, mixed with granola and oats (served cold)
- Estrella Damm Beer: this was on promo with Winterlicious for only $5/14oz! 

Service was great (we made a reservation for 11:30AM on a weekday, so the restaurant was relatively quiet until we were leaving).

Overall I would come back here (definitely for the soup), but would try different entr√©es."}
{"text":"Went for a dinner on a weekday with a friend, and it was packed!
We ordered the famous Duck Poutine Pizza and it was amazing!
It wasn't very heavy on the stomach as I expected as it was thin-crusted.
We ordered beef-wellington(?) and ordered cocktails and they were all tasty!
I would definitely go back to try other dishes on the menu."}
{"text":"I came here with my expectations in check, as I've always been left a little disappointed by other O&B restaurants I've visited--mostly because the price never seemed worth it for the quality of food. This time, my lowered expectations served me well, and I was pleasantly surprised.

Like all other O&B joints, this one is on the pricey side, but not ridiculous, and this time, I really enjoyed my food. Comfort food is hard to do wrong, but when you get too fancy with it, sometimes it ends up all going horribly awry. This was not the cases with the dishes I tried at Bannock.

We started with the poutine, which was cheesey and gravylicious. The gravy had a citrusy twang to it that I actually didn't mind - it worked, and while it wasn't the best poutine I've ever had, it was pretty darn good.

My main was the chicken pot pie. The crust was good - flaky, light, not too thick, and the gravy inside wasn't too heavy. I enjoyed that it was a lighter pot pie, but still didn't finish it, because I was full from the poutine. Everything tasted very fresh. A friend ordered the mac n cheese, which looked really delicious, and a couple others at the table got the burgers, which they enjoyed. 

We ended the meal with the smores pie, which was super delicious, but crazy rich and sugary--of course, that's to be expected when you order a smores pie... I'd recommend splitting it, like we did. 

Overall, even though it's on the pricey end of the scale for comfort food, the meal was enjoyable, and the bright, open dining room made for a pleasant dining experience. The central location is a bonus, too. I'd definitely recommend this place over the other O&B joints around town."}
{"text":"Loved it here. Everything on the menu sounds delicious and I had a tough time deciding. I ended up getting the poutine for the table and the chicken pot pie.

The poutine was really great if not a tad too salty. It filled me up pretty good and by the time my pot pie came I was already satiated. That didn't stop me from devouring the pie, though, because it was THAT good. It was just so piping hot, rich and creamy. Definitely the best chicken pot pie I've ever had.

The space itself looked very modern and clean, with a pleasant Canadian feel to it. Although I normally discount the decor and base my experience mostly on the food, I couldn't help but admire my surroundings and I think they did a great job with the design.  I definitely look forward to my next visit to Bannock and hope it is sooner rather than later."}
{"text":"I am skeptical of the O&B chain of restaurants, but ended up at Bannock needing a pre-Opera place to eat. The interior was simple and welcoming, although after looking into the Bay during my meal,  I did feel an overwhelming urge to purchase a Hudson's Bay blanket afterwards...

The service was intense, very cordial to the extreme. Friendly, but a few too many servers for our one little table. That said, the alternative is much much worse. 

The menu had a great mix of items, it's the kind of place anyone could find something to eat at. We decided on the daily soup, the bannock caesar, the burger + root crisps and the boneless back burger + smokey tomato jam. The burger was tasty, not a top 10-burger, but a good one, the root crisps were a nice change from boring old fries, and the boneless back burger was a McRib done right! (or so says my husband!)

The prices were just right, and the quality of ingredients, with many from local purveyors, was fantastic. Worth a meal for lunch or a quick casual dinner. 

Way to go O&B."}
{"text":"Three words... no not those three little words but close... Duck Poutine Pizza.  This alone could give this place my five stars.  I love a think crispy crust on a pizza so they already have me there, but c'mon confit of duck and poutine on a pizza.  This is heaven on a plate. The flavours are intense but beautiful. 

Ok, foodgasm aside I have come her and brought many friends, colleagues and family here and it is always a blast. The staff here are all super friendly and helpful. It can get a bit noisy, but it is part of the experience. 

I have yet to find. Disappointment on the menu, and in the cocktails department their bacon Caesar is delish!"}
{"text":"I came here for a work lunch during the summer. I had high expectations, but the food came up a bit short. The atmosphere of the restaurant was quite nice for a Friday lunch - it was bustling, but not too loud. The decor is pleasant as well. The servers had our table ready when our large party arrived, which we had reserved in advance. 

To eat, I ordered samosas with chickpea masala, sour cream and guacomole. The samosas were kind of bland (I was expecting more spice for samosas), and there wasn't enough texture in the dish. The chickpea curry and all of the layers of sauce on the dish kind of mushed together. The dish needed a bit less sauce, and more crunchiness. 

The service was a bit slow, but friendly."}
{"text":"On a snowy April Sunday morning what else can a guy want?  Brunch, DUH!  And not just any brunch but one that will amazed him with warm and fuzzy ... in his tummy! Gosh, this is yelp you know =P  Of course, I dreamt about this on Saturday so I had amble time to put my name onto their reservation list.  To my surprised, you DON'T need it!  At least not at 11:30a  Wooo, btw if you are planning to walk around The Eaton Centre (TEC) after or check out the new Saks, you should really consider parking at TEC so that your entire adventure is paid for ... when it comes to parking.

Checking out the menu, I was all excited about the special 1 weekend Canadian Maple Syrup brunch menu, but shortly after i took a peek at the menu, I was drawn to ... \"POUTINE\"! Yes, that's actually what guys want in the morning.  But to 110% justify it, it's a Brunch Poutine!  For a decent 12 dollar it comes with curds, corned beef brisket and a fried egg :)  Aside from that I've also ordered the free-run turkey burger (tempura onion and avocado really got my attention), but since I don't want to look like a fat-so, I told them the Brunch Poutine is for the table LOLL  .... NOT! 

The service was great! Waiter was really promoting cocktail inspired drinks for this fine morning.  He was very attentive and the food came out quickly.  At 11:30am there was only 1 big group (12+) at the far end of the restaurant.  When you first work in from Bay it looked almost like an upscale diner, but once you hit the main dinning room you know the in something fancier :)  Fancier enough to simply just do the \"walk of shame\" in of course, your fancy bar/club attired you wore last night hahaha (yes, I'm laughing at my own dumb humour)

OK - back to the poutine.  Lets cut to the chase ... it's worth more than $12 (@Bannock, plz don't raise the price) but I'd paid $20 for this dish! OMG, it was SO GOOD!  In order to have the full experience I've cut the egg into 3 (so we can allow the other 2 to try .... a bit).  The fries where NOT soggy, it was mixed nicely with turkey gravy.  The curd was soft and not overly stringy.  It was JUST mouth watering tasty!  Somehow the mixture of egg yolk, gravy and fries just works!  ... Reminds me of steak and eggs + RICE! :) 

I'd touch on what other has or the free-run turkey burger, but the highlight of this adventure is definitely the brunch poutine!  We'll come back again! and maybe try the brunch poutine pizza.  But YESSSS the turkey burger is also awesome!  It wasn't dry as expected. The choice of bun was well picked, not too soggy or greasy.  You know what? if they also add a fried egg in it then it will 1+ in my book too.  I might ask for that next time =P"}
{"text":"I was impressed with Bannock. After so many years since its grand opening, I never bothered to try this place despite all the raving reviews of the duck poutine pizza, believing it was just gonna be another over-hyped restaurant. But I was impressed.

I started out with a glass of tempranillo - who would have thought they would have Spanish wine? 
For starter, my friend and I shared a \"get your greens salad\" with DINOSAUR KALE, ZUCCHINI, KOHLRABI, GREEN MANGO.
For main, we shared a duck poutine pizza. 

Honestly, there's not much more to be said besides that the food was extremely good. The salad has interesting flavouring and we polished it off. The pizza was messy and heavy but delicious and my friend ended up taking half of it home.

Great price, great services, AMAZING food. I'm surprised Oliver & Bonacini can deliver this. This is my favourite O&B restaurant thus far."}

No smoked meat here, but the fries were pretty good, at least the crispy ends were very nice. We shared some other dishes that were all above average. I'd go back here."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. To be honest though I expected a lot more out of this place being a big Oliver & Bonacini fan. Nothing really blew me away. Worth a lunch, not a dinner."}
{"text":"The restaurant was in a good location and the service was good. I had the chicken pot pie but it was quite salty. I would probably try again for another occasion but I would be hesitant."}
{"text":"BOTTOM LINE: The only O&B (or should it be BO? ;)) resto I would eat at - it's actually a-ok.

I have a history of being hugely disappointed with O&B restos, which can usually be summed up as being overpriced with painfully slow service. Bannock bucks that trend by merely being decent. We were seated on the high tables, which was somewhat uncomfortable as the chairs had no back. We saw some high seats with backs so I'm not sure why there's such variation. Plus, their regular tables are paired with regular chairs.

We ordered the JAIL ISLAND SALMON (not too dry, well-made risotto with fennel) and the SEARED BC ALBACORE TUNA (the better of the two dishes with juicy tuna served over pickled beans and veggies). They also offer delicious cocktails at reasonable prices. We saw the table next over order the ROAST DUCK POUTINE which looked amazing, though you'd definitely have to share it with a few peeps given its portion size. Perhaps next time..."}
{"text":"my first time here but this place is def a repeat place for me. the menu is small and simple comprised of canadian inspired dishes. it's a damn damn good pot pie. it's creamy but not thick. it comes out scotching hot the way i like it but watch urself it will burn your mouth. The duck poutine pizza is perfect for sharing with your fellow dinning partners. sharing the crumbs that is.If you're going to order the poutine make sure to order the large one you get more bang for the buck. 

service was good here but not exceptional. Forgot the first round of drinks we ordered and found a chicken bone in my pot pie and all i got was a \"sorry it happens sometimes\" 

Pot pie and poutine was so satisfying i gave it 4 stars

Make sure to book reservations during dinner service"}
{"text":"Came for Easter brunch and tried the duck confit poutine and the shashuka. They were both excellent! Best we've ever tasted actually. Our server Fran was a delight and we had a great experience. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I didn't quite know what to expect when I walked through the doors, actually, almost left (CAME THROUGH THE SIDE DOOR WHERE THE CAFE IS), but got seated immediately and gazed at the menu. Canadian comfort food at its finest, well this is the first time I had tried it.

Let me just give mad props to Marcel, who was perfect. Not fake, got us what we needed and was not trying to do to much.

Food was quick, goo and easy. It was a Monday night so that might be why. The entire staff seemed to be happy with their job. I work in the service industry and know that it's not as easy as it seems. 

All and All the next time I am in Toronto I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"This place is only okay. 

I've been here a couple times and it wasn't anything special. The restaurant itself is always really warm which I didn't like. Decor was minimal and understated which was fine, ambience is warm and busy, and the service was generally good. 

The patio was not great, it was really noisy at that intersection. Generally, I found the food to be okay. I had a few of their salads and they were all pretty good. The quality was better than I expected but there wasn't anything that I that was particularly great and worth talking about. Pizza was good, it was different and the flavours surprisingly worked together. 

I might come back if I happened to be shopping and wanted to eat somewhere close by but would not go out of my way to pick this place. Food was decent but I've had better elsewhere, this restaurant doesn't quite live up to the O&B brand and the atmosphere wasn't for me."}
{"text":"I came to try the duck poutine pizza and it was a bit soft for a pizza, but the flavor was great. My friend had the steak and loved the steak itself but not the lacking potatoes or greens that accompanied it. He wanted fries but the server recommended otherwise."}
{"text":"This review is written by a non-local, an American even. So feel free to politely roll your eyes and move on.

For anyone left....  Bannock is the taste of Canada I needed this morning. Wonderfully nice service, wonderfully comfortable food. A place to read the New Yorker and worry about the state of the world, but not really worry too much, in the warm cocoon of hot coffee and potatoes cooked in duck fat.

I had the fried bologna and eggs, which is something like pasta Alfredo except the noodles are julienned bologna.  Wow.  Soft-cooked eggs that just melt into the bologna-noodles.  On the top a tangy tomato sauce that's a beautiful point halfway between salsa and ketchup. On the side a hefty serving of piping hot and crisp potatoes cooked in duck fat. Perfect. And the Bannock: it reminds me of Chinese green onion pancakes, and had a similar crisp, but its own flavor. Which is yummy.

OK, off now to catch a nap, as I've just inhaled my calorie count for the whole day."}

{"text":"For me, this is as good as it gets. I love the quality of the food and the casualness of the environment. They are proud to be Canadian and and serve real down to earth meals. Service is always a plus. 

It's noisey, but that just comes with the territory. If you're looking for an honest good time, these guys will fix you up good!"}
{"text":"Food is top notch. Service was note worthy. I had the eggs Benedict and my friend had the smoked and scrambled. Both amazing. Great for brunch. Not too expensive or crowded (sunday 11:30am). Highly recommend."}
{"text":"For anyone who doesn't believe that Canada has a national cuisine, you need to dine at Bannock. It's comfort food menu is full of Canadian ingredients, national dishes (poutine and butter tarts anyone?), and camp favourites like bannock and s'mores. 

I ordered the venison chili special, which was topped with sour cream, cheese, and sliced onions. The chili was fantastic and I loved the soft, doughy bannock that came with it. I also had a salad with kale, zucchini, kohlrabi, and roasted chickpeas. I liked that this restaurant obviously puts thought and creativity into their salads rather than just offering the standard house, Caesar, and Greek salads. 

Service was great too!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere was great, especially for our work team dinner! I highly recommend their General Joey's chicken and duck poutine."}
{"text":"It's a pretty good place for daily brunch. Great value. But it was under construction right now. Might be a little difficult to find."}
{"text":"Bannock has a great location, right at the corner of Bay and Queen, serving Canadian Comfort Food.

What would be consider as Canadian National Food? According to Wikipedia: Poutine and Butter Tarts.

Does Bannock's menu reflect that theme? Certainly!

I ended up ordering:

Roast Duck Poutine Pizza ($15)

I got to have a taste of:

Boneless Back Rib Burger ($15)
BLT Bannock ($13)
Mac n Cheese ($13)
Peppered Flatiron Steak ($25)

I got to share:

Canoe Firweed Butter Tart ($8)
Warm S'mores Pie ($8)
Sour Cream Donuts ($8)

I found most of the entrees were really salty and nothing good enough to make me feel like I need to come back again!

Desserts though a little overpriced for what we got, but are quite solid. Dumbing sweetness, heavy and creamy.... these are the comforting factors!

Service was excellent and the space is cool...

I cannot say I experienced better...nor I am a fan of Bannock! So I found the experience A-OK!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed dinner here with colleagues. Nice decor and ambiance. Friendly helpful staff. Our group tried a variety of sandwich and salads. I had the Vegetarian Cobb which was quite good with an interesting blend of ingredients. Romaine, lentils, cucumber, avacado, tomatoes and deviled eggs. The ranch dressing was house made. All others enjoyed there meals as well."}
{"text":"O&B seems like the sort of commercialized chain I would admittedly feel an obligation to dislike,  but the quality of food I've had at almost all their establishments has been far too high to write off on that pretension.  Bannock is no exception--this is some of the tastiest food you can get in the downtown core for the price point.  

We took bf's parents here for Sunday lunch and everyone left happy.  Bf got a solid portion of mac and cheese--which is a treat, since I find many gourmet-comfort food places seem to think reducing the portion size somehow affords it more gourmet cachet.  I ordered the shrimp roll, which was seasoned perfectly (just a little spicy) and stuffed into an egg-bread roll.  It was delicious.  Bf's parents ordered bannocks (bannock-as-flatbread wraps), which looked and were reported to be very good.  

On a previous visit, I ordered the pickerel tacos, which were also excellent.  I spent time eyeing other table's desserts and more than a few items looked tempting.  The service has always been very good, and the decor is of the now-run-of-the-mill repurposed wood walls, pseudo-rustic persuasion.  But you can't fault a place for having a slick ambience when it's got the important parts of a restaurant running such a tight ship.  

Bannock also has some takeaway lunch items located on the other side of the restaurant that I'd be interested to try."}
{"text":"A cool place to have coffee or grab a tea. 1 min walk distance to Eaton Center and Hudson Bay. Great location"}
{"text":"This place is very hit and miss in my opinion. The food was very delicious but was a tad pricy for what you were receiving.

I got the Biff's fried bologna and eggs. This was $16 but was very ordinary and did not taste as good as I would have expected for that price. I would recommend spending more money and getting some of the more unique dishes. The steak and eggs my friend got looked amazing and i was slightly jealous . The service was amazing and we got a table very quickly. It is an enjoyable place to have brunch, just be prepared to spend more money and choose from the menu wisely"}
{"text":"5 stars for the duck poutine pizza in particular just because I think it's something everyone should try at least once in their life. I loved that the pizza was made out of flatbread so it was thin, light, crispy, and didn't feel super doughy or carby. It comes loaded with toppings like fries, caramelized onions, cheese curds, very soft and juicy duck pieces, green onions, and some kind of herb. Honestly it was super rich and flavourful and delicious and is a really unique dish, which is why I would recommend trying it! Definitely consider sharing between 2-3 people though because it is pretty big - I ate half and then thought I was about to fall into a food coma. Price is also reasonable at $18 I think, especially if you split with a few people! 

Also big ups to the service, because the waitress who served us last night was super nice and friendly and added to the good dining experience :)

Overall 4-stars for this restaurant because some dishes are just okay... but duck poutine pizza is a must!"}
{"text":"This was my first time in Toronto and I'm so glad we came here! The food was excellent and the service was amazing. The next time I'm in Toronto I'm definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I normally write a long review. Today, I will keep it short. Worst chili ever. Heavy handed with the salt. Stay away from it!"}
{"text":"Ask a canuck about \"Canadian cuisine\", and you'll probably get a quizzical look and maybe some ramblings about elk fat and berries. And while it's true that most Canadian food resembles the meat 'n' starch fare enjoyed by our neighbours to the south, Canada does in fact have a rich culinary history. Bannock does well in bringing to life the memory of foods of yore with a decidedly modern twist. 

Occupying the spot once filled by \"My Favourite Timothy's\", Bannock is truly in the centre of it all. It's steps from the Eaton Centre, City Hall and the financial district. The restaurant itself is bifurcated into a caf√© and a proper restaurant. In the morning, commuters can stop in for coffee, pastries, soups and sandwiches. At night, however, is when the magic happens. 

Making a reservation was quite easy, and we were seated almost immediately upon arrival. I started off with a Back Forty cocktail which was gin, cucumber served in a cocktail class (Bah! I specifically wanted something not in a cocktail glass! I digress.). Determined to try the eponymous dish, the four of us shared a BLT bannock. It's actually quite an impressive portion, so sharing it is definitely recommended. For my main I had the venison chili served with unleaven bread which was amazingly good. It had a real earthy flavour and was spiced to perfection. I ate the entire thing.

The only disappointment came with the dessert. When I read \"s'mores pie\" it evoked an image of something gooey melted over a campfire; this was simply a brownie drizzled with chocolate sauce. Not the best, but not terrible. All in all an excellent dinner option for the most downtown among us.

Obligatory Title Pun: Yes we pemmiCAN.

Menu Readability: It is not lost on me that the menu is shaped like the counter of the \"O\" in their wordmark. Thumbs way up.

Need to mention: Duck poutine pizza seems like a must-get.

What this place teaches me about myself: I hate cocktail glasses. Who invented these stupid things?"}
{"text":"Service was timely, friendly-ish (unless you question their food) and the food was okay.
  Had the fried bologna and eggs with duck greased potatoes.  I am cree, I have my own version of bannock and old style rez food so my frame of reference is based on my childhood experiences.  I must say kokoms fried bologne and bannock is by far more delicious. With that said,  it does satisfy the belly with the fusion of tomatoes and sassyness! 
The bannock here is like a pita but don't question the waitress she might get patronising. Apparently the bannock is made by an ojibway chef. 
 The fresh maple lemonade juice which was too sugary. 
The gast beat and volume of the house music made it challenging to visit while eating."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. 
I was their for late lunch, served very rapidly.
Had the blue cheese pizza 18$, was a bit salty to my taste.  It had blue and mozzarella cheese, prosciutto and pear slices, with something else that I can not identify...  and aragula lettuce.
The portion was big enough and I could have shared had not been alone.
The table besides me had the duck Poutine pizza, they shared. It was huge! Definitely a generous portion enough for tow."}
{"text":"Located right across the City Hall/Eaton Centre, this small restaurant, part of the Oliver & Bonacini chain, offers seasonal menus featuring Canadian cuisine. It also features a \"to-go\" area if you have limited time.

I opted for the Arcadian chicken pot pie and it satisfied all of my cravings with rich creamy flavor. I also had the infamous duck poutine pizza which was so massive and filling! Though the menu may seem limited, there's something for everyone! Unfortunately I didn't have room for their desserts so that will be a must-try for me next time! S'mores pie, I will get you next time!

Overall, I was very satisfied with how this place accommodated my party of 19 with great customer service!"}
{"text":"Came here for summerlicious expecting delicious comfort foods. 

The food was bland. The only seasoning from the array of dishes I ordered was the mint leaf in my dessert. 

Underwhelmed by the experience... Would probably choose another restaurant for summerlicious next time."}
{"text":"This rustic vibe restaurant is partly hidden away even though it's right in the middle of downtown being in the prime location of beside Eatons and Nathan Phillips. But what a find!

It's a mix between Joeys and Jackastors. The food is great quality but also not as pricey as Joeys. 

I got the margarita pizza and it was thin crust, decent size, generous amount of cheese and basil and comes with this secret Chef \"nasty sauce\" which is a very spicy sauce which I HIGHLY recommend. 

It came to $20 in total which isn't bad for a nice sit down dinner at such a prime location! It's also not very crowded or loud so it's great to catch up with a friend here. 

Apparently they have a great brunch menu so will definitely return to check out their brunch!"}
{"text":"Cute little place with both a sit down restaurant on one side, and a 'Grab and Go' counter on the other side.  What most impressed me here was the service - our waiter was spot on: great food descriptions, thoughtful recommendations on both food and drink, and he took it as a challenge to keep my water glass filled, instead of getting grumpy.

As we had an early dinner planned, we really just wanted a light snack.  The \"bannacos\" I had were the perfect size. They were soft tacos filled with rutabaga, caviar tartar sauce, and other interesting ingredients.  Served with an apple and cucumber salad on the side. I absolutely loved the interesting combinations of flavors - every bite was delicious, and I had to stop myself from exclaiming each time.

I had The Mighty Canuck to drink, a mixture of vodka and maple lemonade. It was so very refreshing, I could easily have consumed another gallon or so of it.

Great experience start to finish, and I definitely recommend a visit."}
{"text":"Went for winterlicious and Marcel our server was very nice and helpful and the food was great!"}
{"text":"We had to check out Bannock because we had a good experience at other Oliver and Bonacini restaurants and we were not disappointed. I was here on a weekday around 6pm and it was quite busy as expected. We started with the bannock bread and had the steak pizza and the chicken pot pie. Service was good and food came very quickly. Everything tasted fantastic and the great price for something downtown."}
{"text":"Excellent location for client lunch. Rainbow Trout and Octopus are both delicious entrees. Service is attentive and inobtrusive. Beautiful surroundings and interesting menu. Energetic noise level."}
{"text":"This place has the ambience of a Starbucks.  It is overly bright, with a window looking into the men's section at The Bay.  We ordered a couple of cocktails to start- I had the Bannock Caesar.  It tasted as though it hadn't been stirred-- really harsh vodka taste, and watery clamato finish.  The order of bannock/artisanal bread was strangely presented, with miscellaneous breads piled in a bowl *on top* of herbed butter.  We shared the macaroni & cheese and the shrimp/fish cakes.  Both were bland and unimpressive.  The whole time I felt like I was eating at an airport or something: that kind of chain restaurant, overpriced, generic experience.  WIll not be back."}
{"text":"Several visits and a good meal every time. Duck poutine pizza and the chicken pot pie are especially memorable. A Canadian in Manhattan was also tasty. Friendly service. Wish the chairs were padded, but I guess that helps turn the tables."}
{"text":"I was actually so disappointed in this place. To start things off on a more positive note though, service here was great! Very friendly and attentive. Came to refill my water multiple times. Nice! 

Alright, so when I saw the duck poutine pizza, I knew I had to get it. I came here with one other friend and had to wait a few minutes for a table to clear up, but that was no big deal. The pizza itself could likely serve more than two people (but we weren't too hungry that night, so we could be misjudging). It looked a decent size with heaps of poutine on top. The thin crust made it harder to cut without making a mess out of the entire thing, but we somehow managed.
First bite was great. It was delicious! As we ate more though, I really that the crust really did not compliment the poutine at all. The thin crust was so thin and dry that parts of it were burnt and flaking off. You could barely hold onto a piece without it disintegrating in your hand. We ended up picking out parts of the poutine to eat first so our entire dish wouldn't collapse on itself. The fries for the poutine weren't all that great either. Duck was good though. My friend and I ended up bringing leftovers home since we didn't want any food to go to waste.
I think that if the duck poutine pizza could be improved, then you'd have to make the poutine less traditional and to change the crust. The shape of the fries dumped on top of the ultra thin crust just did not work very well and was very messy to eat. Using a slightly thicker crust and instead of having regular fries, maybe using something flatter could improve the execution. Anyway, I'm not a chef by any means, but these are just my thoughts and opinions after dining at Bannock. 

The restaurant is not very big, and I was put into a corner beside people on an obvious Tinder date. It was quite cramped, and I could hear their entire conversation since I was almost thigh to thigh with one of them. 

It pains me to give this place such a low rating, because I thought I'd really like it. Alas, the only saving grace of the night was the service and my company. Everything else was meh."}
{"text":"O & B's newest restaurant- Bannock (pronounced BAN-nick) is situated at The Bay's flagship store at the corner of Queen and Bay. The overall ambiance had a casual charm that made the dining experience fun and pleasant. The menu offers a wide assortment of \"Canadian comfort food\", an intriguing concept to me because my knowledge of Canadian cuisine is limited to poutines and beaver tails. 

I sipped on a mighty canuck cocktail while waiting for food to come. While the drink itself was quite tasty, it was a bad idea to drink on an empty stomach. 

Now onto the food:

BBQ chicken + tortilla soup- hearty and full of smokey flavours! The soup was so thick with thicken taht it was more of a chilli than a soup, and the crispy tortilla strips added a nice crunchy texture

Bannock caesar- quite satisfying with a generous splatter of cheese. The substitution of traditional croutons with bannock was an innovative twist to a very commonplace salad.

Bannock bannock- house-smoked salmon, onion, cumin, and cream cheese. The flavours were well-balanced, with the tangy pickled onions contrasting the smokiness of the salmon. The bannock itself was slightly spongy, like a naan bread. Overall, this was delicious and I would order it again.

Pickerel taco- caviar tartar and a side of cucumber apple salad. We expected a crispy taco shell, but instead the taco was very spongy and soft, like a Chinese steamed bun. From the bite I had, this was also quite delicious and my friend really enjoyed it. One complaint was that I wished there was more filling to go with that spongy, bun-like taco shell. 

Boneless back rib burger- smokey tomato jam and maple mustard bbq. I ended up eating most of this even though it was my boyfriend's order. The back rib patty was moist and flavourful, and the smokey tomato jam really added a sweet and tangy kick to the burger. I enjoyed it immensely.

St-Canut pulled pork tourti√®re- honey roots, greens, and heinz ketchup. I wasn't wowed by it in any sense, although the flavours were good and the pastry was nicely done. It was a little too meat-heavy for my liking, but I imagine meat-lovers would really enjoy it. I actually preferred eating it by itself rather than with the ketchup. 

Canoe fireweed butter tart- ridiculously yummy! The pastry shell was perfectly flaky and the maple syrup-infused filling was super gooey and rich. It's a winning combination and a fabulous end to an amazing meal. I highly recommend sharing one as it is quite rich. 

All in all, I had a scrumptious meal and Bannock may actually be my new favourite O & B restaurant. I can't wait to return to try out other menu items, such as the roast duck poutine pizza and the warm s'mores pie!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch. Ordered the chicken pot pie and a strawberry mango smoothie.

This place bills itself as \"Canadian comfort food.\" To me, chicken pot pie is about as comforting as comfort food gets and Bannock's is excellent. The crust was firm but flaky and the filling was hearty and tasty. Ideally it would be 25 percent bigger. The smoothie was very good. Service was good.
I know that my 4 star rating is only based on two items - the chicken pot pie and the smoothie - but that's all I have to go on and the next time I go back, I'm ordering those same two items again!
The only reason I'm not giving Bannock a 5 is because it's a tad pricey - $21 for the pie.

** I love the turkey pot pie at Hot Oven Bakery. It's about four times the size of the one at Bannock. The chicken meat at Bannock is slightly more tender than the bakery's turkey meat but the turkey pie is $17 all-in. The chicken pie here is $21 plus tax plus tips."}
{"text":"Great service, great selection of Canadian food. Well thought out dishes.. 

I had the PIRI PIRI chicken and it was really good. It was my first time having it, and it was very moist and flavourful. Not the most exciting dish to be honest.. It's chicken breast.. But if you feel like chicken and like spice it's delicious. 

My friend has the burger, and she said it was  freaking amazing. It didn't look anything that special, but I'm sure it was the fresh ingredients which made it standout.. I wouldn't recommend anyone getting the burger they probably have way better things. 

The waitress let me try a couple wines because I couldn't decide.. The one I went with was great too. T

Their desserts sound delicious as well.. CREME BRULE CHEESECAKE!? Sounds bomb

Will definitely be coming back. I want to try their duck poutine pizza which they're known for. Mm"}
{"text":"Have been here twice and gotten the Bannock BLT and the Lamb Vindaloo Pizza - Both phenomenal but the BLT is a must have. Great service, good food, and the prices are great especially for the location."}
{"text":"I wish I had looked at reviews before ordering the roasted duck poutine pizza. For $19, this pizza is big enough to feed two people, or maybe even three. I wanted the desserts after but shockingly, the \"there's always room for desserts\" after a heavy meal did not apply to me. I had literally no space left and sadly had to leave without trying their smores cake and butter tart. 

Service was excellent, my cup was never left empty, and friendly smiles were always present. I'll definitely come back to try the other menu items, and next time with some friends to hopefully finish my food for me."}
{"text":"This review is long overdue, but I had a wonderful experience here during a surprise dinner on my birthday a few months ago with Sweetheart.

I liked the simple decor - it was kind of rustic but chic at the same time.

The service was phenomenal.  I wish I remembered the name of our server - he was a softspoken gentleman with a really gentle voice.  \"Lets discuss the food in great detail\" he'd say, and I'd think, 'That's the kind of person I could be friends with!'  He spoke about the food with the same kind of reverence one would reserve for spiritual experiences, which I found to be lovely, hilarious, and endearing at the same time!  He was also very attentive and funny.  Excellent, excellent service.

The food was delicious!!!  We shared a duck poutine pizza and the fish cake with fries.  Sweetheart, who's a notoriously picky eater, said the pizza was the best he'd ever had.  The pieces of duck were juicy, flavourful, and generous.  I could've done without the fries, to be honest, but I don't think they took away from the dish overall either.  The gravy was unctuous and flavourful and rich and delicious.  The cheese was squeaky and toned down the saltiness of everything else.  And I loved how thin the crust was - thin and crispy, but not so thin that the middle could be raw or mushy.

The fish cakes (described to us as \"grown-up fish and chips\") were delicious.  We made the mistake of ordering two things with fries but it's ok.  The fish cakes were lemony and herby and sophisticated.  They were nice and tender but still able to keep their shape and not fall apart.  There were big, generous flakes of fish inside.  I kind of wish the order came with 2 instead of 3, but honestly, between both dishes, the two of us were stuffed!

And then the spiced pear juice - OH MY GOD, has any juice ever been more delicious???  I don't think so.  It was diviiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiine.  It was sweet but not too sweet, spiced to perfection, had some fruit pulp in it...it was perfect.  I dream of that pear juice sometimes.  So peary!  

We are looking forward to going back soon!

UPDATE: I popped in when I was passing  by one day to get some pear juice on-the-go and found out it was seasonal so they didn't have any.  I was devastated, naturally.  But I'm going to keep checking back for it, especially when fall hits!"}
{"text":"A friend and I went to Bannock knowing we would order the duck poutine pizza. The waiter was really descriptive about the pizza, and advised us that it would be more than enough for two. For your average pizza-lovers, he was right. But my friend and I really love pizza and poutine, and were able to devour every last bit of it. 
It was delicious and hearty to no end. The hearsay is that usually a party of ~4 will get a pizza to share, and then order individual dishes. We definitely would have done that if we had more people!

For the price ($16 before tax and tip), the poutine pizza is well worth your money. To be honest, I can't say it was mind blowing, but it's definitely deserving of a chance!"}
{"text":"Home of the beloved duck poutine pizza. 

That in itself is probably enough to get you in the door at least once. I haven't actually ever ordered it, but neighbouring tables always seem to be gobbling it down. Thin crust pizza piled high with duck, jus, cheese curds and fries. I assume the crust is also potato based, but I'm not certain. 

I like Bannock for their (new) free wifi, to go counter and food in general. Most recently I enjoyed their version of a caesar salad, made with the-green-of-the-moment Kale and lentils, and I had a bite of a pal's pot pie. Both excellent. The ambience is fine. A bit Bay St Boring, but whatever. 

Service can be slow and it used to annoy me until one fine day*. A pal left his computer and the server tried to chase us down. When they couldn't catch us, they stored it and it was safe and sound until our return. Good people. 

A SHORT PEPPER PLAY:

(Evelyn W and an ass hat enter Bannock and have a seat. Ass Hat quickly goes to the restroom to powder his nose. Server approaches lone wolfess Evelyn W.)
Server: Our juice special today is Peach Strawberry. 
(Server walks away, Ass Hat returns.)
EW: Their juice is peach strawberry.
AH: OK.
(Server returns, before server can speak he is interrupted by Ass Hat.)
AH: I could really go for some juice. Maybe like a peach or strawberry?
(Server gets suuuuper excited.)

*Today was that fine day. I was, like, just there."}
{"text":"Look I really REALLY like this place, BUT when you refuse to serve white sugar but instead only have brown sugar then I gotz a problemo with you all. 

First of all, sugar is freaken sugar okaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay just because its brown doesn't mean its healthier okaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay. 

Secondly brown sugar does not flipping taste good in tea or coffee. 

So knock it off. Have white regular bloody normal sugar available. 

Good grief never been so mad in my life. 

Thank you, 

FYI. Love the Butter Tarts they are to die for."}
{"text":"After a ladies happy hour with two large glasses of wine, there is nothing negative I can say about Bannock. Our waiter was fabulous, attentive, and just the right amount of funny. My friend and I were obscenely hungry and ordered two mains AND a poutine, and we ate every last bite!   The chicken pot pie and mashed potatoes were so good that I was trying desperately to get every last bite of crust off of the dish (could have also been the wine), while the mushroom gnocchi was pillowy and had a very interesting, woodsy flavour. As many have said, the poutine was fantastic with the perfect proportion of fry to gravy to curds. 

My bill for all of this was a little over $60 - a little more than I would usually pay for a weeknight out - but I think it was our fault for being such gluttons!"}
{"text":"Love this place. We came for our annual bday/xmas dinner. It was wonderful as always. It was Friday after work so it was crowded and loud.  Full of people stopping in to fortify themselves between shopping, and after work diners!  

The kitchen seems partially open so when you walk in you step into a wall of delicious smells. 

Started with drinks. I got the sangria my friend got the cinnamony drink. I forget its name.  Both were fantastic


I got the turkey leg special.  Came with mashed potatoes, stuffing, wilted greens, gravy, and pomegranate s.  OK. It was delicious!!  It was a heck of a lot of food and I ate it all.  My friend got the jerk meatloaf. She said that she was only not licking the plate because we were in public.  

We both got the butter tarts for dessert. They were perfect.  Served with berries and whipped cream.  Perfect ending to a great meal!!"}
{"text":"Ontario pork shoulder with spaetzle was amazing. S'more pie was a fantastic finish. Great service, fabulous food, absolutely will be recommending to friends."}
{"text":"I first discovered this place in Jan, and I've been coming back a lot a lot! It has the best location, I will always find a seat here if you come in 2, and it just never gets old bringing friends to share the roasted duck poutine pizza... So yes, I've had that pizza quite a few times now.

What brings me to write this review again is that today's pizza was amazing. They either made it even better, or I just caught them on an extremely good day. It was larger than what I've had before, and the pizza part (bottom-most layer) had more yummy cheese melted on it. Today was really good.

They also have a daily special freshly made juice that comes in a disappointedly small glass (the same glass as your water glass). Friends who ordered it have been surprised and sad. Even though it tastes amazing, it's too little to be called \"freshly made juice\" and it costs $5.

Cocktails are okay. It's nice to enjoy an afternoon cocktail here on the weekend because of how cozy the restaurant feels. Service is hit-and-miss.

Their cafe area, I actually quite like! However the sandwiches (and coffee) are ridiculously expensive."}
{"text":"Great place for a simple tasty launch or dinner, really enjoyed the service and food was really well done, if your downtown you cant miss this place at least give it a try !!there is no way you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"I came here with no expectations, other than vaguely remembering reading about it on here. I was on vacation with my boyfriend and we were nothing but tourists wandering looking for somewhere that sounded decent. We looked at the menu and all I could think was \"it seems like things I already like with a unique twist\"

So we came in, got seated outdoors on a nice day, even though the sun was in our eyes for a bit as it was sunset. I got the herb bannock tray and the turkey burger. 

The bannock and bread plate was phenomenal. It came with some sort of spread on the side that was also really good. I forget what the waitress said, but it was good nonetheless. The turkey burger was also very delicious. My only problem with my food was that I lost a few slices of tomato and some of the dill (I think) mayo fell out, in other words, no problems here.

My biggest issue with the whole place (hence 4 instead of 5 of a rating) is that the service was fairly slow. I mean, getting the food was ok, but getting our drinks was pretty slow, and so was getting the check. We were sitting there for a while, and I'm glad it wasn't a first date that went sour or this would've been awkward. She was the only waitress we saw outside, but she was at least nice. So I would say 4.5, but that's not an option.

All in all it was a really good experience, and I would expect to go back and try something else with this place's strange twists on good food."}
{"text":"I was in Toronto for 4 days and went here twice! Comfort Canadian food ROCKS!!! I love me some poutine! And this is one of the best places to get it! The service we got on the first night was spectacular! The second time, it wasn't nearly as great. I just think that the server we got on the first night was not only more enthusiastic but also better informed about everything on the menu! I wish I could remember his name, caused I would definitely give him a shoutout! Oh well! If your in Toronto, and want some good comfort food, this is your spot!!!"}
{"text":"As an O&B restaurant chain, I expected a lot more. I went here for brunch, the service was terrible. The waitresses were unfriendly and unattentive, you would have to call them three-four times before you can get their attention. 

I ordered the eggs bannodict and my boyfriend ordered the croissant French toast. Both were sub-par. Nothing out of the ordinary. 

If you are looking for overpriced and bland brunch. This is the spot. 
Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"After a busy afternoon of non-stop shopping we decided to try out Bannock for some lunch. The restaurant is split into two sections, the first half is more of a causal coffee shop / grab & go counter while the back half is more of a sit down cozy restaurant setup.

We went directly to the back half to the sit down restaurant side and were promptly seated by a friendly hostess. The menu consists of a wide array of true Canadiana comfort dishes which is definitely what I was craving on this cold rainy day.

To warm up I wanted to start with a cup of soup

Split Pea Soup - Cured short rib, sherry reduction, bannock croutons
Definitely a stick to your ribs hearty kind of soup. Rich in flavor, piping hot, I absolutely loved the addition of bannock croutons floating in my soup absorbing the, thick and creamy broth.

Prarie Grain Salad - Living Sprouts, slegers greens, tahini
Wow was this ever one hell of a delicious salad! Not only was it beautiful to look at but the assortment of grains and vegetables drizzled with the creamy tahini dressing. It was an absolute delight to eat something so yummy and be good for you too!

My Fiance went with the burger

Bannock cheeseburger + root crisps - High River Alberta Ground Brisket
Lucky for me I got to snag a few bites of this burger. Oooo my goodness was this burger ever juicy! Cooked medium well with a trace of pink through the centre the thick flavourful patty exploded with juicy goodness in every bite. Definitely up there with the best I've tried thus far!

Finally if weren't stuffed enough how could I resist dessert!

Warm s'mores pie
Where have you been all my life s'mores pie?? Alternating layers of graham and chocolate topped with perfectly toasted marshmallows in a pool of hot fudge with a blackberry jam alongside was a heavenly end to a super satisfying meal.

Hearty delicious meals and the perfect spot to get some comfort food in a cozy environment. Bannock definitely makes me proud to be Canadian!"}
