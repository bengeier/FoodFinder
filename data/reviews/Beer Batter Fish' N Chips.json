{"text":"I was so excited to try this place when it opened up. I LOVE LOVE LOVE fish and chips with a burning passion. 

I haven't had a fix in a while so I was really fiending for a taste.

I got the cod - batter was nice and crispy, while the inside was tender. Maybe a tad greasy but I'm more than ok with that.

However. 

The fries were really hard. Not crispy hard, but felt more like I was chewing on rocks (ouch). I was really hungry though, so I just ate a bunch of them but felt sick after. There was even a hard clump of 5-7 fries stuck so together that I couldn't even pry apart with a fork. 

When I told the cash, she tried to tell me that the fries are home cut so some of the smaller pieces might be hard. But ... they were all hard so pretty sure they were just over fried. 

Otherwise, the restaurant has a laidback nautical theme complete with picnic bench style seating, which I thought was sweet and cool. 

Maybe I just got a bad batch of chips? Who knows. Probably won't come back anytime soon."}
{"text":"The Irv now sells oysters and fish & chips !  My mind has been blown. Absolutely awesome food!  The best fish and chips I've  had in a long, long time!  The oysters are also amazing - I never eat them with cocktail sauce. But, I do now!  You've got to try this place!"}
{"text":"I'm so happy for this place, and I want desperately for it to thrive. But $17 for a standard hotdog-sized roll, one-third-filled with too-salty lobster? Again, that is a standard-sized hotdog bun, 1/3-filled with lobster, for $17? The chowder was tasty but much too salty, and at $8 a cup is crazy. The coleslaw, traditional, was wilted and much too flavourful, especially after all that salt. I hope the fish and chips are more economical. I really do. Oh...and beware the indoor seating - there are huge, sharp bolts sticking out under the tables that are sure to gouge someone's leg open. Oh, and while we're at it, ditch the radio station that blared nothing but commercials for the first 10 minutes I was there. I'm looking for a respite from that crap. How about some music? Just music?"}
{"text":"I love it. Fresh oysters, amazing fish. Fries are handcut and delicious. Fast and friendly service.  Tried the chowder since my first visit and it was very good. I found it well seasoned and filling. 

Some people seem to be misrepresenting reality in their reviews. There absolutely are 'set meals'. The fish and chips are all fairly priced at $14-$15. You get tartar sauce and coleslaw with it too.  There is no extra charge for those within the fish and chips combo.  That you get to pick your beer batter is another perk and offering it costs money."}
{"text":"new fish and chips restaurant and take out from the irv owners accross the street.

in a nutshell, if the quality, size of the fish portions and friendliness of the place persist, I will change my review to a 5 stars place in a few months (i will definitely come back (often!) and will check on this for you) !

very good fish, good portion of fish, moist and fried perfectly, fries good as well as the slaw... really a good meal!

lobster roll is a lobster bun but that is ok... i didn't try oysters and will likely never as not a huge fan and not sure how big and fresh their selection is (I saw no one having oysters when there today) 

if you take out, check your items before leaving for the moment as they made a mistake with the order of the guy before me... then with mine as well..."}
