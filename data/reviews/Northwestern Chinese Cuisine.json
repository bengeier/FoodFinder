{"text":"The servings were very well sized and the service was pretty quick. The server was a little grumpy. They use a ton of MSG, so the food taste is okay, not the greatest. It was interesting to try, but I won't be heading back."}
{"text":"Ever since I discovered this at Pacific Mall, I had to keep coming back. Once I found out they had a location in Markham, even better!!!  Their potato noodles are so chewy and perfect. You can ask them for extra spicy, which I always do! The menu has pictures of the food so you can easily decide what you want to order.  I received a complimentary soy milk with my soup bowl :) The prices are really affordable and it's located in a really nice plaza.  Definitely my go to noodle soup place!"}
{"text":"Don't let the small store front fool you, this restaurant serves up a mighty, tasty bowl of noodles!   The venue is bigger inside than it looks from the outside.   We got there for opening at 11am, was their first customers of the day. By the time we left at 12 noon, it was almost full!    Good texture, al dente noodles, tasty broth, and good portion of meats.  That's what I want in a bowl of noodles!!   We tried the potato noodle, ramen, and rice vermicelli.  All were good!  Not as refined as Ramen noodles shops but in my opinion, they are tastier."}
{"text":"Service: - quick and friendly service during peak and non-peak hours   Food: - seafood ramen in soup: noodles were soft and loved the soup base as it's different than the other options on the menu. only had shrimps and one mussel in this order.  - pork intestine ramen in soup: intestine were soft; soup base is not as tasty as the seafood ramen in soup.  - potato noodles: different than normal noodles! very textured.   Overall: - relaxing atmosphere; definitely not for big groups."}
{"text":"Have tried both their new location in Markham and the one at Pacific mall.  I have to say both are good but the location in Markham is a restaurant so seating is better.    Food: Great texture of noodles,  it was chewy and the broth was good.  I've tried the one with beef brisket and their house special.  The house special one tasted good but by the time I finished the bowl,  I thought it was too salty for me.  The beef brisket one was tender and delicious.    Decor: Very loud and casual place.  Tables are placed very close to each other so you're going there for the food.  Service is okay,  nothing exceptional to note.  The servers speak mandarin but they give you a paper to write down what you want to order."}
{"text":"I have passed by this place many times, and finally decided to cave in and give it a try. I didn't think much of it at first, just your standard Chinese noodle place. To my surprise, they have an extensive menu that offered different types of noodles and soup bases. I ordered the potato noodle with fish soup base. The noodles were chewy and flavorful, perfectly complimented by the aromatic fish soup base. I am rarely impressed by noodle soup, but this was delicious! I also ordered a side of pork belly bao and spicy fried tofu. I was not a fan of the pork belly bao, but again I am not a fan of pork. The spicy fried tofu was served cold, again not a fan. Overall, the noodle soup was delicious and I will definitely be returning for that."}
{"text":"This place is a little gem in Markham! I never knew this place existed because it's kinda tucked in beside Cha Me Cha and ZenQ.  My favourites are the chicken cold noodles with sesame sauce and the three-coloured vermicelli. The cold noodles are very refreshing and the sauce is very well made. I like vermicelli in general, but I find the ones here because they have three different colours (brown, yellow, white). I don't really like the potato noodles as they're too thick and chewy for my liking.   The service here is average, but they don't really speak anything other than mandarin."}
{"text":"Love the chewy and bouncy noodles but they're really stingy with the meat. Also don't like how the outside store sign is in Chinese.. Didn't really know where the restaurant was at first :/"}
{"text":"|| Must Try: Potato Noodles (Lamb Belly, Beef Brisket)  || Rating: (8/10) Food, (7/10) Service, (8/10) Value, (8/10) Ambience, (8/10) Presentation, (10/10) Cleanliness  || My Experience:    Came here to try the slew of new restaurants in the plaza, with the curiosity of testing out \"potato noodles\". There were a few different noodle options, but we went with lamb and beef.  The soup base was different between the two, beef packing more flavour but the lamb soup maintained the flavour of the lamb meat. The noodles really stood out.  Potato noodles (first time trying) were very bouncy and chewy, unlike typical noodles. Very interested texture and taste, and gave an overall unique texture to the noodles. The noodles were also very, very long, which is an interesting characteristic of potato noodles.  Service was decent, the server was standing beside us the entire time we were looking through the menu trying to decide but then completely failed to take our payment and give us change. Not a deal breaker, but a bit annoying as we were one of the only tables there. Overall space was very clean.   Overall, a great place to try out. Soup base was flavourful, and noodles were unique."}
{"text":"Been here for over half an hour and no one bothered to check with our table to ask if we had ordered or anything after sitting for so long. Finally we asked about our orders to see where our food was and turns out that they took our order, but never actually inputted it in their system."}
{"text":"Chicken Cold Noodle with Sesame: (score:4.5/5.0) the sesame sauce tastes really good, it is rich of sesame. The noodle texture is good, not too soft nor too hard. It also has a lot of vegetables and chicken. The only negative comment that I have is it is not cold enough.   Chinese Hamburger: (score:3.8/5.0) The meat is like pulled pork and the bun is the hard shell bun. I was expecting the taste of the meat will standout, i.e. the meat is marinated with a stronger taste but it is not. It doesn't taste bad, just a bit plain in taste."}
{"text":"One of my favourite noodle spots in Markham! They offer a variety of types of noodles, but you have to try their potato noodles. Their potato noodles are very unique, they're plump and chewy. The only negative thing I have to say is that it seems like they use the same soup base for a lot of their noodles, but their meat flavours the soup. Sometimes the noodles end up tasting similar to one another even if they're different flavours. The shredded duck potato noodles and pork intestine potato noodles are my favourite. Their chicken cold noodles in sesame sauce are amazing as well, very refreshing and flavourful.  Note: they only accept debit over $10!"}
{"text":"I tried this place a few times and they are always busy.  Tried their beef noodle in regular noodle and another kind which I don't remember the English name they used but Chinese is ???. Both are good and have good amount of meat in it. However, I like the location in Pacific mall food court better and that was the first time I tried the noodle soup and their beef tastes better for some reason. Maybe I should go there again for second try. Overall,  this location is still good and like that they open till 10pm."}
{"text":"I haven't tried their original location at pacific mall so I can't compare...but overall the food quality and portion was pretty good and good value. I ordered the beef brisket potato noodle soup. Hubby ordered the seafood potato soup, there were shrimps and fish balls ..and I don't remember what else. Anyways I was turned off by that order because the shrimp skin wasn't peeled. Come on, the bowl of noodle soup  was so hot, how do you expect us to eat those shrimps?!  Atmosphere: We came in on a Thursday evening (7ish) and it was pretty busy, though we got seats for 2 within 3 minutes of waiting. I liked that it was a pretty clean and spacious environment. The vibe was pretty good, a young crowd (I'm pretty old so when I say young I mean above 25 but under 45!). They were playing pretty good (young) music . Btw, this plaza is gettin more busy so be prepared to find parking!    Customer service: Ok, so they were quick and food came out within 8 minutes..but I would say they fail on customer service.  Firstly, why were you giving me empty tea cups with no tea pot on the table?? I notice that also happened to the table next to us. Secondly, why isn't there any free wifi. I asked two waiters if they know the password and they said no. Seriously? U need to get with the trend! Lose points there. Lastly, not a big deal, but they just gave us a piece of paper and rudely told us to write down the our order on the paper.  Overall: I'll come back again and give it another try someday. I'll order something else and try out one of the side orders probably.."}
{"text":"Ordered the three delicacies potato noodles. The three delicacies are fish ball, beef ball, and egg.  The noodles are very unique and very chewy. Would recommend coming here as the noodles are worth a try!"}
{"text":"Came in and asked for a table for three. Seats two groups of two people who came in after me. The final straw was when a party of four that came in after me was seated before me. Staffs will not give you decent service unless you speak mandarin apparently."}
{"text":"Overall - 3.5/5.0  This place features a very spacious and clean environment. Service was also attentive and friendly.  Tried their beef brisket potato noodles and it was pretty good. The texture was super chewy and the beef brisket was very tender. The soup base is fairly clean - it is not oily at all but it had quite a strong peppery taste. It reminded me of the pig stomach soups that you get at chiu chow joints. Not to say that it was not good but I prefer to have a more well rounded and savoury soup base. It is definitely something good to have to warm yourself up on a cold winters day.   I will have to come back to try their other noodles as they have quite a variety to choose from on their menu."}
{"text":"Came into the restaurant and was asked how many people. Told the server that I had 2 and pointed to the back, which I didn't even see an empty table so I asked again and she pointed to a table where someone was sitting there by himself. Asked if I can have my own table and server said no in the rudest way. Why should I share table when there is still other table. Worst customer service every. Left the store right away."}
{"text":"A fairly priced establishment for a unique noodle experience. By far, the potato noodles are the highlight and a must have and deliciously immersed in a wide variety of different broths that are flavourful. The potato noodles themselves have an interesting chewy texture that accompanies any protein or vegetable perfectly. I typically get the sliced lamb potato noodle, which always comes with an abundance of lamb with a strong flavour. I also highly recommend using the house made chili oil that adds a spicy flavourfulto any dish. As well, the \"Chinee Hamburger\" (as it is called in the menu), has flavourful pork in a nice and crispy bun which accompanies the potato noodle well as a side dish."}
{"text":"I like the noodles (???), chewy and soup is good.  Tables are not over crowded so it is fine with kids."}
{"text":"Like many other restaurants, Bai (for short) offers a variety soup base to go with your noodles.  However, the variety in specialty noodles is what makes Bai different.  They've got hand cut noodles, potato noodles, they even have noodles made out of fish (at least that's what the menu says in chinese).  That's what I got. Noodles made of fish.  It was not as good as the potato noodles which was more chewy, but the fish soup base made up for that.  I don't mind coming back again if I was in the area."}
{"text":"Walking into the restaurant, it was a little awkward because the staff didn't come to greet us so we just gestured we were a party of two and chose a table for ourselves.  I thought that it was awkward that we were given only one menu to share while the table next to us (also a two-party) each received one menu.  What's up with that?   The Beef Brisket Potato Noodle in Soup was quite good.  The potato noodles were very chewy and were semi-transparent.  I really enjoyed the tenderness of the beef brisket; they weren't rough at all!  The soup was very fragrant and I suspect again that they used a lot of MSG in it.  The second bowl of noodles, the Seafood Rice Noodle in Soup, were similar in portion and served also in a black bowl reminiscent of Korean hot stone bowls.  The soup broth in this was more clear and smelled of seafood.  The rice noodles were average and bouncier when compared to the potato noodles.  There were five shrimps in there and two half-fish balls.  I guess five shrimps and one fish ball are considered \"seafood\". ...  Needless to say, I will not be running back to this restaurant.  The service was quite bad and while the noodles were much more decent this time than the first experience, I wasn't a huge fan of the experience in general."}
{"text":"I thought to give this place a try since I was in the plaza. Boy am I WRONG!! They missed our orders and didn't apologized in a language I didn't really understand. The potato noodle is so awful and chewy like eating tree branches. I wish I asked for refund, but just didn't give any tips for their poor service."}
{"text":"First time trying this place at this location! Northwestern Chinese Cuisine serves mainly noodle dishes! At an average of approximately $7-$9 per bowl, these dishes were fairly large for one person. so it was absolutely worth it in my opinion!  The place was fairly spacious, with plenty of tables and chairs. From the menu, it's sorted out by a variety of noodle types and or flavours. I got the beef brisket rice noodle in soup. After placing the order, the order came out moderately quickly. The soup wasn't blaring hot, which was nice, but hot enough to stay warm on a cold winter day.  All in all, the prices for Northwestern Chinese Cuisine were decent for such a large bowl of noodles. It would be a nice warm dinner or lunch on a cold day!"}
{"text":"came here from my friends recommendation and I came to this store before in pmall and really enjoyed the potato noodles  However I wanted to try something new and got the beef brisket sliced noodle and braised pork sliced noodle. the noodles were a good texture and the soup had good flavours. the pork and beef were both well cooked and had good taste to it. both of the bowls were $9.99 and had really good portions  my friend got the pork hamburger which was $4 and although it was tasty you get one split in half so pretty pricey   The service however was slacking as the waitresses did not smile and also had little understanding of English. This can be a problem for non Chinese speaking customers but one of my friends could speak Mandarin to communicate."}
{"text":"Potato noodles! This is why you need to come here. If you haven't had them before, you need to try. It's like a delightfully chewy udon.   The broth/soup for the noodles is nice and rich. The hot noodles are always served at a nice scalding temperature (for those of you who like to eat food at this temperature) but I don't mind blowing on the noodles/waiting for it to cool down a bit. Nothing worse than lukewarm noodles. Toppings for the noodles are usually pretty tasty and a decent amount.   The spicy cold noodle is also really good if you're looking for something refreshing, tangy and with a bit of heat. I was a bit disappointed they were sold out of it on a hot day though???   The service is quick for taking your order and getting you your food. You write your order on a sticky note and give it to the server. Hard to mess up!"}
{"text":"We took a peek into what seemed like a small noodle joint but saw that it was quite spacious and decided to go in. The kids like noodles so this was a good choice.   They have all types of noodles from knife cut noodles to ramen to yam noodles and thick rice noodles.   We tried the knife cut noodles with pork and unfortunately we were so eager to try that we forgot to take photos!  It was a very generous portion with semi chewy noodles.   The cold sesame chicken noodles was different from what we expected as it had a slight kick to the sauce and was lighter. I preferred this to the soupy noodle.   The kids shared a chicken ramen (between 3 kids) and it was more than enough. We had also ordered the minced pork ramen and it went untouched so we packed it up.   We also tried the \"hamburger\" which didn't taste vinegary at all. It was quite tasty actually!  Overall, this was a nice find! We will be back to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Love their hand carved noodles. They are thick and chewy in a most scrumptious broth -- I went three times in a week.... The Chinese hamburger is interesting in a good way. Nan like bread stuff with juicy fatty pork belly."}
{"text":"OMFG NEW GEM IN MARKHAM ALERT!!!! This was unbelievably good. This place is run by people that only speak mandarin, so communication is a little difficult if you don't got yo' asian friends with ya. It's great that they have pictures on their menu though, and it's even more great that the food that comes out looks exactly like the picture. They have a lot of choices to choose from, even for vegetarians & vegans! Cold sesame noodles?! Yes please.  The star of the show were potato noodles, which were amazingly chewy and had a great texture to them. They were so good, and my slurp game is so strong. I wanted more and more. The soup base was delicious & extremely flavourful. My friend who took me here told me the potato noodles were so good that she thinks about it sometimes when she's at home.. she ain't lying but I would be if I said that they weren't on my mind right now. Seriously, suuuuuch a gem. We had the thick handpulled noodles as well and those were sooo delish with the right amount of sesame and spice. It's great to find cold noodles in the area that isn't naeng myun; what a pleasant change. Oh yeah, did I mention the portions could feed a small army? We had 3 noodle bowls shared upon 3 people and we couldn't even finish it to the last drop. AND the bill came out to only around $23. Like, what?  This place is 100% going to blow up because I've never had something so simple, unique and delicious in a bowl of noodle soup in all my years of living in foodie central (markham)  Y'all better visit this place before the line starts piling out the door."}
{"text":"I ordered the tofu in sichuan taste sauce that was a really weird experience. I can't decide if I liked it or not. I love the numbing sensation of the spices but then it was also sweet? Can't decide if it's supposed to be an appetizer or a dessert.  My whole mouth is numb while writing this.  The first bite was a surprise cause I thought it  would be hot but turns out it is a cold tofu dish.    We also ordered the pork bone sliced noodle in soup and the braised beef ramen noodle soup.  They were both tastey.  I personally liked the texture of the hand cut noodles better.  I'm curious to know how they cut the noodles so long cause usually hand cut noodles are only about 2 inch long slices. But these were full length noodles.  I enjoyed  the chewiness of it and it was cooked through.  The pork was a big dry but I guess that's just  pork being pork, it did however, fall off the bone.    There are definitely enough noodles in a bowl to stuff your belly."}
{"text":"Not my favourite noodle place, but it was ok. The prices are a tiny bit higher than my liking and the food did not blow me away. That being said, their potato noodles were very good though. I've never had them before, so I can't compare them to other places. Overall, this place is worth a try."}
{"text":"Cold noodles is very good. Probably the best if you like something not too sticky and spicy. If you are heavy taster, then this is not for you. As for fish noodles, we tried 3 colour noodles, it's pretty good. The only reason I didn't give 4 star is because I did not find any signature dish here. Everything is about average. So if I am around area and shopping at T&T , I might eat here. However, there are many options."}
{"text":"Been to this place 3 times now and has been consistently good. Hot bowl of noodles and very tasty. The potato noodle and hand cut noodle is chewy and most importantly, not doughy. The rice noodle is ok. Even with so many Chinese noodle places around, this place is by far the best."}
{"text":"Try the potato noodle, very chewy. Different from the regular noodle. Portion is big, soup is fresh and lots of flavour. Pretty packed but not too nosiy. Definitely a nice place for hot bowl of noddle, will be back to try more."}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese noodles in the city!  They changed the menu & put more tables in the middle since my last review.   Pork Ribs Ramen - the chewiness and flavor of the noodles, the perfect ratio of meat to veggies to noodle, flavourful soup  Beef hand sliced noodle - firmer than the ramen, good flavor and bite"}
{"text":"I'm glad that they have their own restaurant, as I always can't find table in their Pmall Food court location.  I still love their cold noodles, and not much different from their Pmall location.  My fav is still Chicken Noodle with Sesame.  I also like their Beef Brisket Noodle in Soup.  Portion is just right, hmmm, maybe a bit small for guys.  Sometimes, we may need to order some side dishes here.  Or have dessert afterwards in other places nearby :-D"}
{"text":"The food was nice in presentation comparing to the foodcourt in Pacific Mall, but taste is exactly the same. They wouldn't ask you the spicy level because the hot sause / pepper oil is on your table so you can flavor your spicy level yourself - which is great! We ordered the peanut sauce cold noodle, shredded peking duck potato noodle and another side dish of mixed seeweed, shredded tofu and cellophane noodle.Everything was really good and the food came very fast too."}
{"text":"This place is sooo fricken good, i actually came here two days in a row. My boyfriend and I got the beef brisket, duck, and lamb. MAKE SURE YOU GET THE POTATO NOODLES because really, why bother coming here otherwise. The noodles are have a good ratio to soup:noodles:meat and its also packed with soybean skins and fungi. I personally think they give a decent sized portion as I only finished half my bowl both times. However, my boyfriend finished his, the rest of mine and was still hungry."}
{"text":"Came here around 6:00 for an early dinner.  Nothing special about the ambience or service, basic restaurant, good for in and out meal.   Food  Chicken cold noodle with sesame 4stars (recommend) Very appetizing dish. Portion quite decent, I liked the ratio of noodles, meat and cucumber. Sesame sauce is delicious as well.  Esp good for the summer.    Sliced lamb fish noodles 3.5 stars (recommend) There are three types of noodles mixed together. First time I have seen this, very interesting texture. The broth is good, but nothing too special.   Side: chicken legs 2.5 stars (not recommend)  Not worth for the price. Portion is small and I didn't like the spice used to marinate the chicken."}
{"text":"This place is my go-to noodle in Markham!   I come here solely for the potato noodles, the texture is so chewy which i love! I always order the potato noodles with either the beef brisket or the spicy chicken.  The beef briskets are only okay, nothing special.  The spicy chicken is very tasty and they are really tender and flavourful.  The soup/broth is on the salty side so be sure to request for less salty when order."}
{"text":"3 stars at best.   I was happy to hear this place opened up since the food court location (at Pacific Mall) was tasty and extremely good but finding a spot to sit was tough. But unfortunately it does not compare to its original location.   I ordered the usual A1 Spicy Potato Noodle Soup, the texture of the noodles were good (same quality as the food court location) and chewy. However, the flavours were not as impressive. It was a lot less spicy in comparison and the broth seemed slightly watered down. In terms of portion it was smaller as well but there was fair amount of fish balls and vegetables.   Service was horrible here. The servers looked so unhappy while working here, no smile or much of a greeting. On each table, there were menus and a piece of paper to write your order down. It wasn't very busy during lunch around 1PM and we still had a hard time getting a hold of the server. The servers mostly talked among themselves. I was surprised because the lady at the other location was super friendly, explained the different noodle textures and was definitely more welcoming.    Aside from service, I would possibly come back and hope for a better experience."}
{"text":"Probably one of the most unexpectedly good noodle houses I've been to so far. The menu is small but straight forward. I ordered the shredded duck rice noodle and the flavouring was amazing. Not too salty. It was fresh and the noodle soup base actually tastes like soup and not just water with seasoning. The meat and noodle are tender and not rough like some places are. The ambience is quite casual and cozy. Service was good and friendly. The portions are quite good and not too small or ridiculously large. Perfect for a quick bite or date night since the location is surrounded by bubble tea and dessert places! Definitely coming back soon."}
{"text":"Overall, 3.5 for me (doesn't deserve a full 4 stars). Came here on a Sunday afternoon with the restaurant full, we had a short wait. The restaurant is new and clean so no complaints. Service was poor but I never expect much at a these type of Chinese restaurants.  Food overall was good but not amazing.  Beef brisket potato noodles 4/5: I had the beef brisket potato noodles. First time having it and was satisfied. The brisket was tender and the portion size was good.   Tofu 2.5/5: We also ordered a side of tofu which I did not enjoy. There was way too much flavouring on it.   I won't be dying to come back but I would recommend trying if you're a noodles fan."}
{"text":"Rich soup base with flimsy soggy noodles, topped with moist tender meat.   Surprisingly acceptable.  Absurd wait time from ordering food to having food in front of me. All is forgiven with the tasty soup and tender meat.   Decor is as 1 notch above ikea. It's not very good.  Parking is not very good.   3/5 I would need to be in the mood to return. Not much incentive."}
{"text":"Potato noodles? I've never had them before but was pleasantly surprised. I still can't fully describe what it is like so you will have to try for yourself. Overall, enjoyed the broth, noodles (both potato and hand cut) and the beef brisket was super tender. The chinese hamburger on the other hand was not that great. Felt it was dry and salty. Overall a 3.5 for me because of the lack of staff speaking cantonese or english."}
{"text":"I came back a second time and the service was definitely improved! No more waiting 10 years for any basic service like water or the bill :) I ordered the beef potato noodles (~$8.5) again, my companion had the \"3 delicacy potato noodles\" and the pork hocks. Food was good as usual, the potato noodles have great unique texture, nice and chewy. The soup was the best part - the non spicy one has a beautiful peppery kick. The beef were melt in your mouth tender but not too fatty. My companion did not enjoy his 3 delicacies quite as much...the 3 delicacies were 3 types of Chinese round fish cake and meatballs, nothing mind blowing about it. It'll be fantastic if they work on that google translated menu for a bit. The pork hocks were nice too, bit it came just warm enough so quickly became cold as you ate. For the price, I find the noodles great, its not the cheapest meal options around but the quality is something I'll come back for."}
{"text":"Overall, 3.5 stars, rounding up to 4.  Place is well staffed, language is a barrier, mostly speak Manderin.  Nice simple interior, clean; nicely air conditioned on a hot sunny day. Spacious and comfortable..  Ordered a Lamb Intestine Rice Noodle - $8.99  Serves their noodles in stone bowls, same as the ones from Korean Soups.  The lamb soup base was legit!!! Will definitely come back for this.  The lamb was also very tasty!! Lots of variety and thinly sliced, the portion was average..  The rice noodles were ok, i retrospect, probably should have ordered the potato noodles instead.  Overall, this place didn't disappoint, will be back for sure to try other menu items..  Overall, first coming here is 3.5 stars, but I have a feeling the potato noodle will be worth a 4 star..  Place is kinda hidden, it's upper level parking with a small entrance right beside zenQ."}
{"text":"I would say this place lives up to its hype. After reading the reviews I decided to go try it out for dinner. The restaurant is slightly hidden right beside zen q. I ordered the spicy potato noodle which came with a lot of toppings and the broth was super flavourful. The noodles were super chewy and delicious. The spicy cold sesame noodle was sold out so I definitely have to come back.   The servers all know a slight bit of English so I didn't find it too hard to communicate and order what I wanted. I definitely recommend this place to just anyone, especially the noodle soup lovers out there!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner first time with my hubby. Wasn't really interested but cuz of the positive reviews so give it a try. The soup noodle was really good BUT the service was horrible! Our soup noodle took forever to come! Somebody came after us got their order before us and by the time our order came they already finished their meal! Omg! Can't believe they missed our order. It must took them an hr to get our soup noodle. They apologized and was willing to give us 10% off our order. But honestly, 10% is nothing... Then they give us free pop. I don't even like drinking pop with my meal. When we got our bill they FoRGOT to give us the 10% off. I really wanna give them a second chance but I am just too pissed off that's how they treat their customers."}
{"text":"Their soup base was kinda too salty for me personally and their serves wasn't that good..We brought baby in for dinner that day and they wouldn't let us have an extra table for baby so we didn't sit comfortably throughout the whole dinner..."}
{"text":"If I could use one word to describe this restaurant, it would be \"chewy\".  Located at the Langham Square plaza beside Cha Me Cha, the name of this gem doesn't instantly give away that it is a noodle soup restaurant. Came here on a Saturday night and there were plenty of seats available (the -2 C weather (in April) probably affected the crowd). Because we were literally the only customers there aside from 3-4 other tables, we started getting nervous that we made the wrong choice. Totally had low expectations and when the food came out, gotta say we were surprised at how good it actually was!  What we got: - Beef brisket potato noodle soup - Pork ribs special soup with noodle  Noodles were super \"Q\" and perfectly chewy. Never had chewier noodles in Toronto. Noodles were way better than Magic Noodle, Dagu, Deer Garden, you name it. Soup broth was not your typical MSG or salt-heavy base, it had a unique flavour to it. The special soup definitely stood out as well.  Service was friendly and relatively quick for the potato noodle soup item, however it took another 4-5 mins for the special soup to come out. Not sure why the two items didn't come out together given it wasn't busy at all.  Will definitely return to try: chicken cold noodle with sesame and the shaved noodle soup options."}
{"text":"Love coming here for some delicious and cheap eats!   They began as a little food court stall in Pacific Mall but has now expanded into a full service restaurant! They are famous for their noodle soup broth, so it's definitely a must try. The broth they use if very flavorful and unique and you have a variety of noodles and toppings to choose from.  The potato noodle is very chewy and a lot thicker than regular noodles. I love their ramen noodles because they're super chewy and taste very authentic. One of my favorite dishes is the cold sesame noodle with chicken. The sesame sauce they make is very rich and creamy. Paired with the chewy ramen noodles and chicken strips is just pure perfection. I love how they do not limit themselves to just serving hot noodles, but also incorporating cold dishes and appetizers as well!  Service is quick and efficient, just like your regular Chinese restaurant. But I notice that take out orders are often mixed up or incorrect, so make sure you double check before leaving!  Everything is reasonably priced and portions are quite big as well. I always leave full and satisfied, so I definitely recommend everyone to give this place a try whenever you're feeling like a hearty bowl of hot noodles!"}
{"text":"YAY. I'm so happy this opened up so close to home!  The place is hidden right beside ZenQ & has a little single ghetto door.  Don't be fooled by the outside because inside is pretty spacious and clean.    It is very hard not speaking Mandarin since there are some items on the menu that are not translated into English - oh well.  Just tell the girl \"English\" and she'll know from then on the best thing to do is use hand gestures or that you'll be pointing at the menu.  My boyfriend and sister + me wrote down what we wanted as our waitress didn't understand us and it's pretty easy as they're labeled alphabetically/numerically.    The food came out pretty fast & hot in a bowl the Koreans usually use for pork bone soup.  The pork intestines (do not say gross, try it first) was amazing.  The noodles were so... bouncy.  They were soo chewy and filling :) :) :) the pork was actually pretty good.  It added to the flavour and didn't disintegrate in the soup - decent quality.  For the 3 of us, it came out to $21 = $7/person.  & it was very, very, very filling.  Good price for good quailty.   I'll be back next week :)"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this noodle place after seeing the photos on their door and on yelp. And so I convinced my family to try out this relatively new restaurant instead of getting ramen. When you first enter there was this weird \"wash cloth\" smell and they were playing hip hop music on one of the TVs (that's what the tv said...\"hip hop radio\" haha!).  We ordered their sliced lamb potato noodle soup, cold noodle with sesame, and spicy potato noodle soup and shared them among 4 people. When the cold noodles came out I was quite disappointed because the only topping it had was cucumber (which, I guess that's understandable since we got the simplest cold noodle in the menu) BUT there was VERY LITTLE cucumber. In fact, all the bowls came with fewer toppings than I'd like.  Nonetheless, the food was satisfying. Soup base was flavourful (the lamb soup had a strong but not over powering lamb taste), even the cold noodle (which was pretty much just sauce and noodles) was quite savoury and I couldn't stop eating it. Noodles themselves were also good (not soggy, plentiful) and you could see the difference in the types of noodles (some would have a clear coating around it) but they all tasted the same. We were all very full at the end.   I think it's a decent place to get your noodle fix, but the lack of toppings with those prices...makes me wish we went for ramen instead."}
{"text":"Beef Brisket Potato Noodle Soup ($8.50) The potato noodle texture is really interesting, super slippery and chewy. The beef briskets were okay, some pieces were tough but some were tender. Overall its good, nothing special though in my opinion.   Also tried their minced pork meat in a pita. The meat was flavorful, but wasn't feeling the combo with it being sandwiched in a pita. I think I prefer the pork hamburgers at other locations where the bread is toasted and crispy."}
{"text":"Good little noodle shop with tasty broth and chewy noodles!  This place was a little tough to find but it is in the shopping plaza Longham Square around the  outside. It took us a while to find as we parked underground and wandered on the street level to find it. We went on a Sat night for an earlier dinner at 630PM which was busy but we have no problems finding a seat for 2. But the place was pretty full!  Food: We ordered 2 of their noodles: standard potato noodle soup and the shredded duck noodle soup plus the chinese hamburger. The potato noodle soup tasted great - light broth with chewy noodles with veggies, soft boiled egg and tofu balls. Nice blend of flavours which came away with a light taste. My wife ordered the shredded duck noodle which was so-so - seemed like the same soup noodles but minus all of my toppings and replaced with a few bits of duck meat. We were a bit disappointed in this as we thought it was a big duck leg. Finally, the item which I think stole the show was the appetizer which was called a chinese hamburger. It was more like a toasted panini with a sloppy joe filling - it was actually quite good - great flavour on the meat sauce combined with a crunchy toasted bun. I would definitely order this again.  Overall, this seems a nice little noodle shop with a twist on the potato noodles. Flavours didn't blew me away but still tasty. But if you go - grab the chinese hamburger!"}
{"text":"I think this is one of the better Chinese noodle places that seem to be gaining popularity. The signature \"potato noodle\" is a thick starchy chewy glass noodle similar to what you get in some Vietnamese restaurants. I personally love chewy noodles so it was enjoyable but I don't think it's for everyone. I had the shredded duck broth which had good flavour intensity, and the portion was decent. My only complaint is the noodles were cooked unevenly and some parts were not transparent yet and difficult to chew. I also tried another spicy chicken ramen which had a really good kick and very different flavours than the duck broth."}
{"text":"3.5 Star  I am happy with the success of Potato Noodle of Bai https://www.yelp.ca/biz/potato-noodle-soup-of-bai-markham for them to open up their 2nd location. From a food stall in Pacific Mall to now a real eat in restaurant!  I ordered my usual A1 Potato Noodle in Soup ($6.99). Seemed like they toned down their spiciness quite a lot. Maybe I need to ask for extra spicy next time? which they have that option in the Pacific Mall location. But I still enjoy the chewiness of the potato noodle!  A solid place for some noodle slurping if you love to enjoy a bowl of noodle."}
{"text":"Bai is a noodle diner.  It offers a quick fix for lunch and dinner.  I like that, even with a big selection of soup noodles, it maintains its focus on Northern Chinese noodles.  I admire the discipline.  I ordered a lamb regular noodle soup (1 chilli per menu), and BF ordered a beef potato noodle soup (not spicy per menu).  Firstly, the lamb regular noodle soup was not spicy at all.  BF's potato noodle soup was spicier than my lamb noodle soup.  Other than that, the lamb noodle soup was good.  The noodle was smooth and fresh.  The lamb meat was delicious and thinly sliced.  The broth was milky and delicious.    On to the beef potato noodle soup.  Yap, my BF was caught surprised by the spiciness.  Other than that, he liked how richly flavoured the beef chucks were.  He thought the broth was quite good.  What he didn't like was the potato noodle.  This was his first time eating potato noodle.  He found it too chewy yet flavourless.  He said he liked the other aspects (beef and broth) of the soup noodle, so he would order regular noodle next time.  The portion of the lamb regular noodle was good.  The portion of the potato noodle was quite a bit smaller than the regular noodle.  The pricing is good.  Overall value is above average.  Overall 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"This was my second time visiting this establishment. When I entered I was immediately greeted and told to pick any table I wanted. Upon sitting down I was given the menu. My girlfriend and I decided to order noodles and a snack. Specifically we ordered the seafood ramen and spicy rice noodle in soup. We also ordered a ROU JIA MO, also known as the \"Chinese Hamburger\". Our food arrived about 5 minutes after placing our order (which we wrote down ourselves on a piece of paper). Our food was nice and hot. Waitress placed our bowls in front of us without us having to move bowls around. Couple of minutes after we decided to get our bill which also arrived quickly. Change was given to us pretty quick too. Second time here and I was just as happy as the first time. 5/5 stars."}
{"text":"My first time having potato noodles. It has a good texture. Soup base was good, not overly salty but still have good flavor. They have different kind of noodles but more or less same toppings/ ingredients. I had the beef brisket noodle which it was soft and tender. My coworker had the spicy soup base which has a mild kick to it. The beef wrap was delicious. Eat it while it's Hot and juicy! Only one server spoke English and the rest spoke mandarin. But the menu has English and pictures so it shouldn't be too hard for customers to order. Would come again."}
{"text":"This place is the same owner as the Pmall location. This place also has cold sides now and alot more noodle vdirty. However, my go to is always the chinese burger and cold noodles. They are always great and consistent in great flavour! This location is a restaurant, it has modern decor, clean and pretty busy during off peak times even on a Tuesday. The owner lady works. Here now and she is so sweet. Try the lamb puff!! So flavourful! Will be back soon :) they open longer here than PMALL."}
