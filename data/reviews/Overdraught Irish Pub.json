{"text":"Great Irish pub! Good food. Good service. Great selection of beers and drink--especially liked their Irish coffee. All at a very fair price. What more could anyone want? Loud music? Half-dressed waitresses? Okay, you won't find those here. Just good food, good beer, good service, good price."}
{"text":"The food was excellent as was the service. Best burger I've had in a long time. The wait staff was attentive and very helpful."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go for good pub food. In the area this is my favorite, and I have been there many times. I like chicken wings there, they are actually decent size and well made."}
{"text":"Good food, good service, good prices, good beer.

I come here whenever I'm in this part of town and someone wants to hang out in a bar. I've been here at least ten times, and each time I try something new on the menu, and I've never been disappointed.

The selection is what you'd expect at an Irish pub: burgers, sausages, shepherd's pie, meatloaf. All of the meals are well prepared and plated. Their fries are well seasoned.

Beer selection isn't as varied as other pubs in the area, but I'm not really a beer person. They have a good selection of all of the different types of beer and that's what I think is important.

Staff is very attentive and friendly.

It can get quite full on Jays nights, but most of the time we're still able to find seats because it is a deceptively large underground space."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for an early dinner before a Blue Jays games recently. Place was backed, but still able to get a seat. Food and portions were good. Waitress service was always nearby for your refill or check request. Tried to go again for early lunch before we headed back to NYC but place wasn't open at 1PM on a Sunday afternoon."}
{"text":"Worst experience I've ever had in a establishment in my life.. I use to love over draught, food and service was always good, and very close to my condo. Last night my friend and I went for a late night snack and drink. We were greeted by a black hair thin build female waitress, when she greeted us you could tell she was not in the best of mood. She started off by asking us for a drink, she took my friends drink order, I haven't decided yet so she walked away and said \"I guess you don't want a drink\" in a rude tone. When she came back I ordered my drink and asked her if the nachos had pico or salsa, she aggressively flipped over the menu and said, \"everything you need to know is right here, this is why we have menus\" I then replied by saying sorry that I asked, I asked because it didn't mention in menu. She then said \"Ok I'll get you guys your bills then\" As she walked away she then said under her breath, \"i love serving fags\" I asked to speak to the manager who was the assistant manager at the time, I was extremely embarrassed to have bringing this to a managers attention while i was on a date also extremely embarrassed by the waitresses attitude and homophobic sarcastic comments. Assistant manager dealt with it correctly and deescalated the situation. I have never been treated like this in a restaurant and this is SHOCKING. How this lady is employed at a pub with such history of good food and service is beyond me.. I'm still waiting for management to reach out to me to see what has been done to address this behavior that is not acceptable from anyone in today society."}
{"text":"Came here with a bunch of friends after a Rock game. There were only a few people seated so it was nice and quiet. 

Our server, Sarah, was very sweet and friendly. One of my friends and I wanted something fruity. She introduced us to the Foundry Golden Cider. It was delicious. Fruity and just enough sweetness to cover any beer after taste. I also ordered the Potatoes Nachos and shared that with a friend. A bed of waffle fries with lettuce, tomatoes, chilli, jalapeño peppers and sour cream on top and a side of spicy guacamole. It was YUM! Perfect appetizer to go with my beer.

The portions are fair and our server was amazing. However, the atmosphere was very...boring. By the time we were done eating we were the only people at the pub. For a Saturday night, it seems unusual for Downtown. Not sure I'll come back, but you never know. :)"}
{"text":"Great spot before the game.

Real Sports is the go to but reservations can be hard to come by prior to a game at ACC.  I found The Overdraught online and checked it out.  Was not disappointed.  Rich décor with cozy seating and wood finish throughout.  The place was lively and had a friendly feel.  My friend and I ordered the wings as appetizers which were large and deliciously flavoured.  My friend ordered the burger and I went for the traditional fish and chips.  The fish was a good size with a tasty and very crispy batter.  Excellent.  A number of traditional Irish dishes on the menu.

Lots of beer options.  I got the half and half (half Guinness, half Harp).  Don't know if Guinness lovers would frown on that but it was interesting and pretty good.

Don't try making a reservation through their website.  I never got a confirmation.  I called to make the reservation and it was no problem.

Highly recommend the place if you're more in the mood for a pub before the game versus a big sports bar."}
{"text":"Great Service!  I am a vegetarian and ordered the appetizer forgetting to ask if there was meat. The waitress caught on to it before I did because of my entrée and replaced my meal. 

Food tastes great and a very comfortable atmosphere."}
{"text":"Repas excellent. La bière est bonne et ne manquer pas un Fish'n Chips ! Les repas de avec du cari sont excellents."}
{"text":"Great place with nice barmaids, good selection of beers and decent Fish and Chips."}
{"text":"I popped in for a late night burger and a pint. Decent stuff, but nothing to write home about. Pretty pricey, but otherwise good."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner one evening last week because it was conveniently close to the hotel and we were feeling kind of lazy.

I ordered their burger and sweet potato fries and a cocktail. The cocktail was really well made and tasty. The burger was made in house and had a great flavour. The frozen sweet potato fries were standard. They sell frozen fries (white and sweet) and try to fool people by calling them \"harvest cut\". WTF! They are frozen. My dining companion got the frozen white fries and he said they really let down the housemade burger because they were so bad (like frozen McCain's or something). 

The real reason this pub gets a 1 is the service. Our server was completely indifferent for most of our time there until she became outright rude. We got here about 10 minutes before the Blue Jays game ended and as soon as the influx of dejected Blue Jay fans made their way here, she was trying to rush us out the door. 

She dropped off the cheque before we were even done our mains and she didn't ask whether we wanted another cocktail, coffee or tea, or dessert. My dining companion and I were shocked at how rude that was. I was fully prepared to have another cocktail or two, but I'm not going to spend my money when I've been subjected to such rude treatment. You do not get to practically boot current customers out the door because you're trying to cram in as many sports fans as possible. 

So rude. I would never come back here. I don't tolerate that sort of service."}
{"text":"Great food music was so so......a Irish bar should play Irish  small menu but the food was passible. Waitress was great. A most stop on a bar crawl."}
{"text":"Have been here twice now, once with my husband for a meal, and once with a group of 'girls' after work for drinks and snacks. Crazy busy on game nights, it was nice and relaxed on a Friday night with no games on the go - great selection of Irish drinks (and Snakebite on the menu), and yummy food. The menu is somewhat limited, but the \"Irish Poutine\" (lattice fries, dark and delicious gravy, mozzarella, bacon, sour cream and green onions) was fantastic - and big enough to share. My party was very pleased as well with the \"Irish Nachos\" (nachos with the lattice fries as the base), chicken wings, and a not-on-the menu veggie plate (which was nicer than those I've seen that were actually part of pub menus). They had live music on the Friday we were there, a guy singing and playing guitar - very nice backdrop to unwind and shoot the breeze after work."}
{"text":"Food was really good.  I had fish and chips and my hubby had shepards pie.  Liked the atmosphere and on Tuesdays they have Harp for $5 a pint.  Good overall."}
{"text":"No change tables in the bathrooms for infants and food is pretty average,  I suppose that might go someway to explaining why you can always get a table when other venues in the area have a lineup."}
{"text":"Great place because it is not as crazy busy and some of the neighboring restos/bars. Great prices and yummy irish nachos!"}
{"text":"Typical bar food. Typical bar environment. Average food nothing to write home about. The cod was hella overcooked. Average restaurant in every single way."}
{"text":"I recently visited this pub with friends from work. I had the Guinness Steak and Mushroom Pie which was quite flavourful. The one downside was that the steak was tough. However, the rest of the stew, gravy and put pastry were very good. As for the service, the server was nice enough but not very attentive."}
{"text":"This is really just another Front street tourist bar masquerading as an \"Irish pub.\" 

The bar itself is a long and narrow basement space, it has pretty average service, and the beer list is nothing to write home about. I had Big Rock, which I quite enjoy, but there's not much more on tap here than any other bar in the immediate area.

I had the pulled pork sandwich and didn't really enjoy it. The sauce they used wasn't all that flavourful and the portion size was quite small for the price.

This isn't a horrible \"pub,\" but there are much better options in the area."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised; this is right in an \"expensive\" area of town (entertainment district, convention centre, etc) where restaurants tend to be overpriced but this one was fairly reasonable.

Beef tenderloin dinner for $16 in this neighborhood? Yes, it does exist and it was cooked to order and tender. Even more startling is that was the MOST expensive entree on the menu.

Our table also had the steak & mushroom pie, a very generous portion with quite a lot of meat and decent-sized potatoes & soda bread sides and the puff pastry on top was perfectly done.

As an added bonus, the evening we were there had a $5 pint special (for Irish imported Harp lager) which was another surprise in a part of town where a beer can run you over eleven dollars.

The service was fast and friendly and the atmosphere was quaint and appropriately 'pub-by' and the location is extremely handy.  

The fact is that you are not going to get dinner with imported pints for any less in this neighborhood and the food we had was a cut above a lot of the typical 'pub fare' found around the city."}
{"text":"Meh.

For me, because I used to be a semi-regular, the OD serves three great purposes:

1) The staff know how to pour a pint.
2) Lots of sass.
3) It's not any of the other bars on Front @ Uni.

Head here for the beverages and the live music, but not the food and remember to be friendly, 'cause it'll make it a world of difference. And if you get sass, lob some sass right back, but keep it above the belt."}
{"text":"Stopped in after a Blue Jays game,  we were seated quickly, service was friendly.  Beer drinkers at the table enjoyed the variety on offer. Although i was disappointed with the Baked Coconut Cod (could not taste nor see any coconut, sauce was overpowering), others who had fish and chips or Guinness pie enjoyed theirs. Would order something else should I return. 
Review is closer to 3.5 than 4.0."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good. The food was much better than any of us expected. I went on a Sunday with a party of 5, and all of us seemed to love the food. 

We wound up here after having seen that the loose moose and jack astors had long lines. Luckily I spotted this place while walking by. I feel like many people may simply miss it since its down a stair well. When we walked in there weren't a ton of people but the staff that greeted us were friendly and gave us a booth. 

I got the Guinness Steak & Mushroom pie. Hot damn was it tasty. And the soda bread was also super tasty. My only quarrel with it, was that it came with a fairly small cube of soda bread. I wish I had another cube or larger slice. 

I also heard from others at the table that the baked cod was good, as were the fish tacos and the buttermilk chicken sandwich. Overall quite an enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Well very disappointed. This establishment had a paper sign in the window closed for staff appreciation today (Monday June 11). Both it and the neighbouring restaurant above were closed. Considering this is NOT a franchise, it would have been considerate to post something on their website to that effect. The outdoor sidewalk sign was out (why was that not brought in?) 

Needless to say the lack of professionalism will not yield a return trip."}
{"text":"my party just came from next door at canyon creek chop house after eating some huge steaks.

I understand that this is an irish pub, but waitress was extremely rude when some of us were asking for a redbull vodka which i know isn't necessarily irish but most bars have it.  

she gave us a snarky attitude as if we were wasting our time when there wasn't even anyone else around to waiting to be served, and we had to wait another 10 minutes before we were even able to buy beers.  

we left after one round and finished the night at pj obriens which had a nice live band and even though they too were an irish pub, they were able to accomodate us with our not-so-irish tequila shots."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a blustery evening and sat at the bar. Enjoyed a couple of Guinness and the steak and mushroom pie.
Lots of beef in the pie, no complaints at all. Liked the quiet atmosphere and the unobtrusive music.
Service was fast and friendly.
Would return."}
{"text":"Great bacon-cheddar burger. Very good draft beer menu (I tried Kilkenny). Very attencious staff."}
{"text":"The last time I've been to an Irish Pub must have been a Molly Bloom's. Overdraught reminds me of the Prancing Pony in LOTR with the Pints flowing, loud chatter, dim-lit oak wood setting, and song. It's not exactly of course but for someone that doesn't Pub much, it's as close as it gets. 

We didn't encounter any rowdy men hitting on ladies but we left while the night was young. The Music Station seemed to be on Z103 or something and when the Live Musician began playing Pop/Rock, it ended my Hobbit adventures for the night.  2.5 *Star*

Signature Cocktail - Captain Guinness($6.99) is something I personally prefer being a Rum Coke guy, as this version uses the \"Captain\" and a float of Guinness Stout. Nice drink if you're like me and can get full from foamy Beers as this is the perfect balance. 

Guinness Steak and Mushroom Pie($14.00) has A-OK elements and some less so. The \"Slow Roasted\" Beef was tough for the most part so I kind of doubt it being slow roasted. The Guinness Ale Reduction and Button Mushrooms was salty but I find when mixed into the Garlic Mash made for a nice Mash & Gravy combination. 

I wouldn't mind coming again whenever they have $5.00 Pint promotions when I'm in the area because I can imagine myself chilling with a couple GOOD friends and relaxing on the bench after a hard day's work.  Afterwards, on the way to Union Station grab a Sausage on a Bun."}
{"text":"Went to this place after raptors game and great staff, great service felt welcome once we arrived. Had the jerk wings and were great for late night eats and pub. Would for sure make it a local watering hole if I lived in the area. Would come back for more than just one pint ! 8 or more beer selections. Worth a try"}
{"text":"We were at the Convention Centre and came here for a quick lunch.  Surprisingly better than I thought and I would definitely come back here again. Nice atmosphere (had a real Irish pub feel to it) and friendly service.

We had a French Dip sandwich that was generous. Fries are outstanding. Good portions too.  Others had the burger and enjoyed it too.   They got us in and out quickly too.

So, if you're in the area or have something at the convention center, this was a good choice."}
{"text":"It was great to find an Irish pub across the street from the Convention Center. But first, know this -- don't wait to be seated, as the sign says. SEAT YOURSELF. Instead of playing a guessing game as to where else we should sit -- our first choice happened to be \"reserved\" -- we headed straight to the bar. Service was a little slow, but I find this to be of a cultural inclination of the Irish in not wanting to hurry you away. My BF had the shepherd's pie, which he loved, and I had a truly great chicken sandwich with BBQ sauce and avocado with fries. Very comforting food for our very tired souls. I love Irish pubs. I hope there are some in heaven."}
{"text":"I've been in for lunches and before Jays games, and I can't say I've had the same problems as some other reviewers. Especially before the last Jays game, they were quite busy...our server was working hard to get to all her tables.

The place is clean and well decorated in the Irish fashion, which lots of TVs around the bar if you're wanting to watch sports. Food-wise, I highly recommend the BBQ, Bacon & Cheddar burger. Excellent bun, excellent patty, but what stood out was its sauciness. Just perfect. I've also tried the Irish Poutine which was great, with an excellent cheese-to-lattice-fries ratio.

There's nothing that REALLY made Overdraught stand out from all the other \"pubs\" along Front (they were playing Electronic music, which was a bit odd for a supposedly Irish pub), but they've been consistently good for me, which I can't say about the others."}
{"text":"After watching the Toronto Rock lose game one of their finals, with all the frustration we had, it somehow got us all hungry lol...
Quiet tucked below Joe Badalli is the Overdraught is your typical Irish pub that has a good selection of foods and drink.  The ambiance is warm-like and dim which gives the place a typical pub feeling.  The server was courteous, and quite knowledgable about her beer.  I must say me being a wine drinker, I needed some guidance on what beer to choose.  As a result I chose their Hop City Barking Squirrel, which was a light draught, and quite enjoyable. 
For grub, being in an Irish bar, I opted for their Irish nachose, which was hearty-stick-to-your-ribs goodness, however next time i'm here ill be sure to add some pulled pork (which one of our friends chose) oh man did it look delicious! overall, the place was quite warm- homie and great go-to place for after work drinks, compared to Loose Moose, which is just too loud to even have a conversation..."}
{"text":"Just say no to Jack Astor's and the Loose Moose, follow the stairs down to the Overdraught, and get yourself some goddamn potato nachos. Happiness will follow."}
{"text":"Typical Irish Pub ambiance and menu.
The fish and chips were cooked to perfection. 
The beer was a good combination for the food!"}
{"text":"What a fun place! We stopped by for a drink after dinner up stairs. I'm a whore for a punny name. They had live Irish music playing and I was surprised that the place was a little dead for a Saturday night, perhaps it was still a little early. The bartender was very nice and attentive- I hate I didn't catch her name. I could have easily wasted more time here had I not put myself in a carb coma upstairs."}
{"text":"I'm with Gord. Meh. The fish is nice. I hate fish 'n' chips where you get a sliver of fish in a big ass hunk of batter. The fries, meh. The coleslaw the chef called in from home. Chopping up cabbage and adding a president choice salad dressing isn't coleslaw. 

We went on a non-Leafs night. This is a bar for very old people. Don't expect a hip urban crowd. The only high point (and the reason this isn't a 2 star) is you get imported pints for $5 after 9 pm on Saturday.

You do have to suffer through some live music, a guy on guitar belting out standards. There's loads of room in the back to get away from crap you've heard before.

Waitstaff is on top of things."}
{"text":"Fast wifi use guest log in and password fishnchips

Had the shepards pie, with salid all great"}
{"text":"I made a reservation here because I had a large party, with friends coming from out of town.  I arrived at the same time as some of the other guests and were shown to our table.  To our surprise there were people already sitting there!  I told the hostess that these people were not part of our reservation and couldn't believe that someone stole it.

Apparently the Italian restaurant upstairs is a sister restaurant and the manager asked if we would like to move our reservation up there.  I was somewhat offended by the inquiry, as I would have thought the immediate response would be to kick the people out who stole the reservation!  Eventually they did kick them out (not sure if they were given the upstairs option) and we got our reserved table.

Once we settled in, everything went pretty smoothly.  Food was delicious and drink prices were pretty good for a downtown spot close to Union Station.  The only issue we had was that the service, while friendly, wasn't as attentive as I'd like.  We had a nice big able in the back which was fairly private so it seemed like the waitress didn't come back there as often.

Other than the hiccup at the beginning, which wasn't the restaurant's fault, I would come back here.  It was a great spot for our big party and they let us separate the bills without a problem which can be hard to find."}
{"text":"Truly if you have to go to an eatery on this end of Front Street, and you don't feel like the \"grittiness\" (saying it politely) of the Loose Moose, you'd do worse than go to the Overdraught.  Downstairs from Joe Badali's (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/joe-badalis-ristorante-italiano-and-bar-toronto), this pub tries its darndest to stand out from the other restaurants on this strip.

The true novelty of the pub is that it is downstairs with somewhat lower ceilings than most places on this strip, making it feel a little bit cosier than most places.  The décor is very befitting an Irish bar and it does it's best to look the part.  Tons of wooden tables and stools, and barrels built into the ceiling help to give the place a warmer feel.  It definitely stands out from the other kids on the block.

The Guinness is also poured properly.  What would you expect from a place that has a \"beer philosophy\"?"}
{"text":"pretty typical looking pub with a good selection of beers.  dark wood themed walls, tables, chairs.  i can't remember if anything else was wooded, sorry.  i like the layout, it's as if each table has the perfect amount of space in between them.  just private enough, but not enough so that you forget you're in a pub.

the waitress was almost non-existent.  she started out sassy and nice, but that didn't last.  the drinks took longer than i'd like to arrive.  when i asked for a water with the bill, she brought the bill and almost gave me someone else's drink.  our empty glasses stayed on the table until we left and we left before she came back with the water...

there was a young-looking gentleman playing an acoustic who was enjoyable.  he played covers from bands like springsteen, the killers, r kelly, etc.  twas the best part of my experience other than the company i was with.

the overall ambiance was good and i had a good time, but i could've had a great time with better service.  better service, leading to a few more drinks, leading to a bigger tip.  everybody could've been happier.

ehh, i think i'll probably give this place another shot."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a bite to eat , we were greeted Nicely and seated . We ordered a couple of Beers and 2 burgers and I was surprised that the food quality was great and the server was pleasant as well. The place started to get packed as the day progressed , the ambience was nice and location was east to get too."}
{"text":"The Mac and cheese was delicious and the pretzel appy was hot and fresh. Drinks were expensive, service was good."}
{"text":"Good prices for this area, the plates are full, service is good and the taste is good too. I will certainly come back"}
{"text":"I decided to give this place a shot after reading the good reviews on Yelp. I also had a buy one get one free lunch or dinner entree coupon so thought why not? Wrong. 

First off, the location is kind of difficult to find because it's tucked away. The sign is very small outside and you have to go downstairs to find the place. The environment was what you would expect from an Irish pub. The service was alright but the food was terrible hence my low rating. 

I got the baked blackberry cod( $17). Everything had no flavour and the fish was very dry and tasted like frozen fish that was reheated in the microwave. My boyfriend got the pulled pork sandwich ($15) and that tasted much better than my entree. 

I'm glad I came here with a coupon or else it would totally not have been worth it."}
{"text":"Great place, great service. 

Stopped in after a trade show and the staff were lovely. 

I was on my own and the hostess graciously sat me in a nice booth. 

I only ordered a pint and soup but they didn't seem to mind. 

Soup was lovely and the pint of Guinness was well poured."}
{"text":"We came here because the prices weren't crazy, it was near the CN Tower, and we wanted to eat quickly instead of scouring for food.  We get to the hostess stand, and wait a few minutes in a particularly empty place (it was 6pm...should it be this empty?).  We get seated in a corner, and our waitress comes over with a very forced kindness (maybe she had a bad day, at least she tried).

Order food, drinks, etc, same old.  Nothing took too long, or was too fast, it was normal.  The lighting was nice, not too bright.  Food was good, I got the meat pie (they were out of chicken pot pie =[  ).  

One complaint, they really are bad at making black and tans.  The reviewer below me wrote that they know how to pour Guiness correctly, but what about black and tans?  My drink came mixed, with no line of separation between the two.  Did they just pour one into the other?  All I can say is...black and tans don't taste so great when they come mixed. 

All in all it was a good meal.  3 stars is fitting."}
{"text":"Five years later and I gave this place another try last night. It hasn't changed at all inside. We were sat by the hostess quickly near the front, but after sitting for 10 minutes, our server asked us to move to another table because another party became larger. That made our dining experience not the best as we then had to listen to their very loud talking--no fun.  Now we had to ask our server to move us, again. We moved across the room and it was better. 

Our drinks came quickly and we ordered the fish and chips and chicken tenderloins. They were served fairly quickly. The fish was served a bit cold but tasted not too bad, being crispy on the outside and flaky within.  The chicken tenders were served hot and tasted really good with a light breading and were crispy. The salad I had with the raspberry vinaigrette dressing was really good. The fries were good tasting and cooked well."}
{"text":"Now I am confirmed that I love Pubs.. but I cannot stand Pub's food.

Overdraught Irish Pub is a nice place to hang out and have a drink or 2 or 3 or 4 with your friends especially if they are doing a special on drinks. The Black and Tan ($7.20) is nice and smooth and poured the way it suppose to be. But I would not have know when the inside of this Pub was really dark (yes important for a pub as drunk folks want to be hidden and rip in the dark) , and my drink was dark too...

Guinness Steak and Mushroom Pie ($14) is dark too and so damn salty!! I think the reason is the more salty your food is, the more beer you need to drink?? Good that I ate some Ramen before coming here.

Please tell your friend not to pick the table right by the door where the guitar playing singer going to sing. But if you just want to not hear what your friend's conservations those maybe the perfect seats.

They do have daily specials, check their website...

BTW, why are the men working here not wearing kilts showing off their assets??"}
{"text":"Ok place... Nothing impressive, Guinness is Guinness just like at any other place... Service was kinda weird, I thin as soon as Canadian (French Canadian) waitress heard our non Canadian accent she wasn't as pleasant, only came up one time to serve us and give us our check to pay... If it wasn't for the hockey game on TV I'd be concentrating on shitty service and I'd flip on them for their service... Other Canadians we met were a bit more hospitable."}
{"text":"Went in here after a Blue Jays' game. Every other bar in the neighbourhood was packed. There were more staff hanging around chatting than customers. And considering there were only 5 staff, that says a lot!

I didn't eat any food, but had an over-priced pint of cider. The hostess was not interested in being friendly, and I was lucky to get the bartender's attention. Which considering the lack of customers was very rude."}
