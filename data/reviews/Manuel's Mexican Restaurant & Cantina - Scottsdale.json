{"text":"Was rolling around Phoenix trying to decide what to eat, being torn between Mexican food and burgers (was really trying to find a mexican restaurant that served Elotes) and it was getting late so me and my friend picked this place. He raved that his boss went here it was amazing and that did serve Elotes (Sadly, they do not...I asked -insert sad face-) so I jumped on board. The place was busy when we came but there was no wait, the waitress was very understanding when we decided to switch our seats from indoor to outdoor seating after already placing an order on appetizer menu. The chips and salsa that was served were addicting (finished 1 bowl and a half) while I scanned through the menu..still undecided. We decided to try their mexican pizza, half chicken..half beef..this was so freaking good OMG! (if you ever tried Taco Bell's Mexican pizza its 100x better). Honestly would be happy if it was an entree, it definitely can feed 2 people. I ordered the 3 amigos which comes with 3 different types of enchilada, rice and beans. I personally LOVED the chicken/spinach enchilada doused in this yummy white sauce.  Margaritas are served in a huge glass for those who enjoy them, check it out. I ordered the virgin Pina Colada which was eh..honestly couldn't finish because I was getting full and it didn't taste that good in my opinion but maybe that's because I ordered it without the rum..  Definitely wanting to explore their menu some more."}
{"text":"Enjoyed lunch with an old friend from Papago Grade School and North High today at Manuel's here in Scottsdale.  The service was great by our waitress Ashlie and the food good and hot and as always was great.  We sat in the area next to the bar.  Ashlie was very prompt with taking our order and serving it as well. She made sure that our glasses were refilled when needed and was very attentive to what ever we needed. I am sure that this will become one of my regular places to enjoy some good old fashioned Mexican Dishes."}
{"text":"This place simply gets a 5 star in my book for their compassion and outstanding customer service! I was in there on my lunch having issues with my bank card and trying to hash out the situation with my bank over the phone. With my bank being uncooperative and me having to leave to go to the bank to actually pull out money to pay for my lunch, I was extremely frustrated. As I was walking out the staff stopped me and offered me my lunch for free simply because I was having so much trouble with my bank and they felt bad for me. That right there made my day and made me a fan of Manuel's. It's not many places that would take a loss on their end just to make things easier for the customer. And for that reason I will be coming back to this restaurant because of the over the top customer service! I would especially like to thank Jen, Kelly and Colin for being so amazing. I owe you guys!  PS the food was good too!! Especially the hot salsa."}
{"text":"Wow. Thanks to my father I was able to find this hidden treasure. I love good Mexican food and the meal started out strong with great chips and salsa and guac. Service was good and one of the few bright spots. Then it was downhill. Food came out so fast and the meats lacked flavor or the ability to chew without hurting your jaw. Normally we take leftovers but I didn't want to put myself through any more pain. Just like a std, bad food goes home with you too and boy did it ever. Listening to the symphony coming out of my dear little brothers butt was music to my ears. I felt like I gave birth as I sat down on the porcelain praying that this would end. I feel bad because it does have potential, just needs to combine its service to it food. Fresh is important even at low prices. I woke up this morning with a hangover but ended the day with excrutiating indigestion."}
{"text":"Server was very nice however food was horrible. Chicken had fat on each piece and bean burrito was tasteless. I am not sure how they can still be in business."}
{"text":"Again, a great experience!!!! We have been coming to Manuel's a few years in a row now. We always sit outside, next to the door to the bar -- live music! - so our girls (4yrs and 8 yrs) can go dancing after dinner. They absolutely love it. And the service was fantastic, as always! Ricardo was our server and he kept the kids entertained, laughing and enjoying the overall experience. A great night and perfect way to spend our last night in AZ!!!!"}
{"text":"Very good! My mom, hubby & I came in, we were warmly greeted by the hostess, and were asked if we had a preference as to where we would like to be seated. We asked to sit on the patio. It was busy, but chips and salsa appeared almost immediately. I must say, that is some of the best salsa I have ever tasted in a restaurant. The chips were warm and crispy. Our waitress was very friendly and efficient. My mango margarita was big and delicious. We shared two orders of the chicken fajitas, which was more than enough food. The portions are huge!  This was our first time to Manuel's, and it wont be our last"}
{"text":"This place has great service.great salsa. Great chips. The food is outstanding you just can't go wrong stopping at this place .prices are reasonable  for today.  Easy parking. You will enjoy yourself."}
{"text":"Good attentive service.   Waiter always comes by to see if more salsa/chips are wanted.  good happy hour on weekend specials till 4pm"}
{"text":"We went there this past Saturday evening. The place was very busy, but we were seated on the patio pretty fast. Music was nice. The service was non-existent and we were noticeably ignored by several waiters on the patio for more than 40 minutes- we were getting ready to leave when a server finally asked us if we were ever served.  Then the manager apologized and a waitress appeared.  Food was very good."}
{"text":"Ate there at lunch.   Shredded beef taco and cheese enchilada lunch combo.  Taco was  greasy and not much flavor.   Cheese enchilada was ok.  At least it was hot and cheese was melted.     Over priced for what you get at  $9.00 with  no rice and beans.   The \"salsa\" had little flavor and no spice,  no heat at all.  Asked for something spicier and got something mildly spicer but very thinned tomato paste consistency.    Don't understand the other positive reviews about the great salsa."}
{"text":"Simply the BEST in the Valley.   Always fresh, hot chips and fresh salsa. Quick service, superb food, quick customer service and very friendly staff."}
{"text":"I was leery of eating here because the yelp reviews from a couple of years ago seemed so mediocre. It seemed like most of the chains in the East Valley put out food that is not very memorable. The first time I ate here with friends...I settled for their margarita and chips.  About a month ago, we met friends again and I actually ordered off their menu for dinner. I was shocked to enjoy the best chili relleno I've found in Arizona!!! My husband was raving about his chicken chimi. The other couple was totally enjoying their Tampiquena. Who knew??? We returned the other night, enjoying appetizers and fried ice cream. I never would have thought Manuel's would become my new go-to place for enjoyable Mexican food...wow!"}
{"text":"We went there because it's was late, and close to our house. I am glad we did because the waiter made our night!!! The food was good for a four star but the server (Ricardo) was excellent!!!  Ricardo made the restaurant a Five star with his service and great humor!!!!"}
{"text":"Extremely avg to below. People - we have so many Mexican food options that you should not consider this one. Just to say something positive - if this were in BF Wisconsin they'd love it."}
{"text":"Stopped by to pick-up some take out last night, and was really pleasantly surprised!  Not only was it an excellent value for a LOT of food (even the 6'6\" hubby couldn't finish his entire meal) but it was really, really tasty!  We got the beef machaca plate and the shrimp picado, and both were delicious.  I want some more of that machaca again today (since we used what little was left over from last night in our eggs this morning!)  And I echo what one of the other reviewers wrote:  The salsa is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner last night and expected another wonderful dinner.  Unfortunately, while the food was very good, the preparation and delivery of the food was less than average.  Three dinners were served and then we had to wait 10 minutes for the next three and 5 minutes before the final meals were delivered.  Most annoying was the fact the restaurant was relatively empty compared to other times we were there. The waiter's explanation was that there was nothing he could do about the kitchen. Obviously there is some problem that needs to be addressed so that dinners are delivered to the party more seamlessly."}
{"text":"Salsa was good. Everything was an extra charge.we asked for Pico de Gallo and it never came but we were charged 50Â¢extra. I asked for a refill on Mr.pibb but they gave me some diet soda. There was 1 waitress serving 10 tables at 6:30pm. The chicken taco was good but my beef tamale was dry."}
{"text":"Sunday late lunch. We found this place on Yelp. It was pretty dead but it was 3pm We were seated right away.  We enjoyed the nice warm chips and salsa. They served three little bowls of salsa to us, party of three which I really liked.  Quick service. The waiter was pleasant, The food was served very hot and delicious.   I would definitely recommend this place! See photos."}
{"text":"This was the first Mexican restaurant in Scottsdale that I tried.  It was close to home, we had been shopping all day, and decided to try it for a late lunch. I was disappointed - not because the food was bad, but because it wasn't much different than most of the Mexican restaurants in Spokane.  I was hoping for something more adventurous, more authentic, and not the Americanized Mexican food that is prevalent in Washington.  That said, the food was as advertised, and was good for what it was.  The lunch special price was pretty much standard for the area, and the servings were large.  I did look at the individual items on the menu, and noticed the prices seemed high.  But since this was the first restaurant that we went to in Scottsdale, I just figured it was the area. The service was good, and the waitress was very friendly.  To show how unimpressed I was, this is only about a half a mile from my place, and I have yet to find a reason to go back.  Again, the food wasn't bad, but I would rather drive to restaurants with more authentic and adventuresome recipes."}
{"text":"excellent food and especially the atmosphere. I went there several years ago (Scottsdale location) and did not care for the food  or service at that time. It has changed quite a bit an was very pleased. The waitress was attentive and my friend and I both had very good Mexican food."}
{"text":"Our Arizona Balloon Club enjoyed  Manuel's catering for our 2017 Christmas Party.  Their Fajita party platter, Layered Enchilada  casserole, Trio Tray minis, Green & Red Tamales along with Spanish rice and beans were the perfect choice.  Manuel's delivered all on time and set up the food presentation, too.   GREAT!"}
{"text":"I was geeted and seated and that was it, no service. I sat in a booth in the bar area, made eye contact with the bartender that was serving 2 gentlmen that we're seated after I was. I waited and when I figured I waited long enough I walked out.  There were only a few people in the bar. Not worth my time to wait for them to serve me."}
{"text":"Living in metro Phoenix I never expected to eat at any Mexican joint that was not a hole-in-the-wall.  Why?  Because those places always have the best food.  However, I opted to try Manuel's Mexican Food before work recently.  I drive by frequently and always see the full lot and thought it couldn't hurt to give 'em a go.  My go-to Mexican meal is enchiladas and I did not stray from my normal plan of attack.  The meal was supplemented with tasty chips and salsa as is standard in an Mexican sit-down worth eating.  The enchiladas were not spectacular but good and worth the price (around $10.25 if I recall correctly).  My meal was served on a sizzling, gigantic plate with beans and rice.  All around very tasty.  I was very impressed with the service as well.  The waiter was very attentive.  I must be honest that a place like Manuel's will never be my first plan of attack when it comes to Mexican food.  But should I have company that wants to actually sit down to a good meal in nicer surrounds not offered by the standard hole-in-the-wall, I will probably take them to Manuel's."}
{"text":"The Chicken Fajitas are wonderful!  BUT--Here's a tip to ensure they're fabulous: Order them \"well done!\"   Don't worry--you won't get charcoal-y bits of tough chicken.  Rather, ordering \"well done\" makes everything the way you'd normally expect it---nice and caramelized--the onions, peppers, etc. and the chicken takes on a whole new dimension.  It's honestly the way they should be done.  Otherwise, the fajitas come out looking and tasting more like steamed chicken and veggies.  The tortillas are great with them (I get flour) and the beans and sides are good, too.    We've been coming here for years----it's close, the servers know us very well and practically have our beer waiting for us by the time we sit down at the table!  The patio is nice, too (when weather is not too hot)!  Their chips and salsa are also rather additive!  This has always been a good standby for us!!"}
{"text":"The service was excellent, but the food was subpar at best. Bland, lacking any authentic flavor and seasoning or spice. We had 4 different dishes between the table and nothing was better than just okay."}
{"text":"Had a late Saturday lunch about 3:00 PM today and the restaurant had only one other couple eating in our section of the restaurant. There are two sections you can eat at, either the right side of the restaurant where the bar and band set up is or on the left side of the restaurant where there are clusters of booths.  This was recommended to me by co-workers a few months back and we were hoping it would be like La Fonda and that we would have a back up Mexican place to choose from when we craved Mexican.  Unfortunately, for us, there was not going to be a second return to this place.  Kelli our waitress was a delightful lady and she gave us good service but the food at this place was just plain blah.  My hubby and I started out with the obligatory chips and salsa. The chips came out cold and the salsa had the familiar Picante salsa taste like it came from the grocery store. This was watered down salsa with a hint of ketchup. Still remaining positive and not impressed we eagerly awaited our main meal.  We ordered the same plate, Beef taco but one order with a hard shell and one with a soft tortilla. The interesting thing here is that these combo plates did not come with beans and rice. Just beans. To get the spanish rice it was an additional $3.00. At over $11 plus a plate, we opted out and just stuck to the beans.  The food came out hot (beans and enchilada) and interestingly enough, my beef taco (with a tortilla that was wrapped in foil) didn't turn out as hot as everything else on the plate. The right side of my plate where the enchilada and beans were, ended up hot and there was a layer of grease over this portion that wasn't visually appealing. It looked like burnt refried beans. Also it was hard to tell where the enchilada and beans started as it was just all mushed together.  I tried to fork the enchilada but it was a bit tough and had to use a knife to slice it into pieces. The cheese inside was hard and I couldn't really taste anything except the toughness of the cheese. Now as far as my beef taco, yes, it had way too much salt and it was lukewarmish.   Overall this was just so so. For over $30 with drinks, you're better off going to La Fonda."}
{"text":"Where do old rock stars go to just play great music?  Manuels near 90th and Mountain View, that's where.  The three owners used to play for 3 Dog Night, the Stones and a few other renown bands and now they own Manuels.  Evenings in the Cantina can be a great time to kick back and listen to old cover songs or get up and dance.  We also like the Senior Menu - it's just enough food for us and not expensive at all.  You will enjoy this!"}
{"text":"Okay so I always come here for lunch & have a nice meal. Today was different, they seemed to be a little bit more busy. The waitress finally brought me a menu after 10 minutes of sitting at the bar, I do have to say the staff did bring over chips & salsa to me immediately. Ok so I ordered fajitas, once they came out nothing was sizzling & the veggies looked barely warm, & all onions & green peppers & only 1 strip of red onion. Waitress finally came over after I was finished & asked how the food was. Took her an additional 15 min to get me the bill. Her time management was lacking or they needed more servers. I still love coming & will be back but very disappointed in today's experience"}
{"text":"I love the Manuel restaurant chain in general. However this restaurant's portions are much smaller than other Manuel restaurants. Service was just OK with the server stopping by when called only and to drop the check. . Nothing special about the food either worth posting about it..."}
{"text":"Awesome Mexican food and reasonable prices.  Love the chips and salsa!  Also, had a really good experience with the catering they offer.  Been going there for years,"}
{"text":"This is a decent Mexican restaurant.  Nothing terrible.  Nothing amazing.  I came in with my wife and we were seated quickly.  Our server was nice enough, but obviously was running around to many different tables, so didn't have too much time for us.  All the food we tried was pretty consistently fine.  We had the Chips & Salsa, Steak Quesadilla, and the Chicken Street Tacos.  As a comparison, I would say that the food at Cien Agaves in South Scottsdale is better.  I would recommend trying Manuel's for Happy Hour.  The food and drinks are fairly cheap during that time (3-6 M-F).  Also, kids eat free on Wednesdays, so that's a good deal to be aware of as well.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is one of those places that you drive by a lot and think \"maybe we should try it\".  Where do I begin - we got seated fairly quickly, and that's the last good thing I can say.  Pretty sure our waitress was new, or just didn't want to be there.  It took about 20 minutes to get our drinks.  Then she disappeared.  20 minutes later the food order was taken.  Then nothing, waiting, waiting, waiting.  Food finally got there and I would say it was no better than a fast-food place.  We sent one order back - she didn't seem to care why.  She showed up 10 minutes later with an order of the same thing and asked if we wanted it. Um, no.    Husband had to get up and get another drink at the bar.  And speaking of the bar, why are they using plastic glasses?  Seriously, I am at a sit-down restaurant in Scottsdale!    Meanwhile, there is a FANTASTIC waitress serving all the tables around us.  They got their drinks, food, etc. with a smile and prompt service.  That just made it all the worse!  I talked to one of the hostesses and told her it was one of the worst experiences we've ever had.  I see another review for the same day, so I'm glad it wasn't just us."}
{"text":"Our favorite Thursday night hangout just became our favorite weekend BREAKFAST! If y'all haven't visited Manuel's for their new breakfast on the weekends, you've simply got to try it.   They start out with their fabulous chips and salsa (yes, even for breakfast) and their menu has a super selection of classic Mexican favorites. We ordered the Chile Relleno, which comes with their amazing fried potatoes and the magic voodoo green chile that we love at Manuel's! We also ordered the Potato/Egg/Cheese Burro, which is as big as a small infant.  Everything was up to the usual Manuel's standard of excellence and we've been back every weekend since they started serving breakfast. It won't be long before word gets out that Manuel's breakfast is as wicked good as their supper! Now leave me... I need to be alone with my Chile Relleno."}
{"text":"We used to be fans of this place, but we noticed that around 11/2008 they changed their prices and their menu, and we haven't been back since. They do have the best green corn tamale in PHX, but I used to get their nachos, and now they are less than half the serving and about the same price. I know the economy sucks, but they are a tad too expensive for what they serve now.   Not a fan any more!"}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a while, but the food is not what it used to be and the service was very slow. Seriously how many times does the waiter have to walk by and notice that everyone at the table is gone but me. Waiting for the check do nearly 15 minutes. If it were buy it would be one thing but this is a bit ridiculous. Sorry, but have to recommend not coming here. Hate to say that because this place used to be a really great place to come and have lunch or dinner and have a few drinks. Sad to see it go down hill. :("}
{"text":"This is a great, down-home Mexican restaraunt.  Food is excellent and the environment is really nice.  Its not some pretend high end place - its great food, nice surroundings and its never too busy.  Parking is easy and if you are looking for a great place that isn't trying to be all that, this is your place!"}
{"text":"Very good! We were extremely suffering, \"lackofood,\" and stumbled into Manuel's. They seated us quickly, quenched our thirst and gave us chips and salsa faster than we could say, Margarita! We ordered as we, yes, pig style gobbled our first basket of delicious chips! We came around 2:00 in the afternoon and we're glad no one was around us. We had not eaten from the day before, as we had to fast for medical studies. So we were ravenous!!! They brought us another bowl, then our lunch showed up and we are like royals...Nom nom!! The tacos were crispy, chucked full of meat, cheese and lettuce. My husband got the chimichaga and it wasn't lacking! Again lots of meat inside, guacamole and sour cream on top! Warning, We'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Very bad service tonight!!! We are coming here, on and off for the last 9 years were living in this neighborhood and it use to be one of our favors!!! But.... tonight??? Terrible!!! I can't figure out how you Manuel's Management hire this waitress??? She doesn't belong here!!! Not at this location anyway!!! Even tough we called and made a reservation, she acted like she was doing us a favor... her services was lousy and her attitude terrible!!! No class! No customer service! No comments!!! Were most likely think twice before were coming back!!! Very sad :(:(:("}
{"text":"Safe and delicious.  Price is a little high, but everything is a little bit too high in 2012.  I like getting the 3 Amigo enchilada's."}
{"text":"This place is serving third rate food. Fish tacos tasted old and definitely not fresh. Covered in foil I think they premake and reheat. The chicken fajitas were nothing but tenders without the chewy vein removed. What a turn off! What are the odds you find yourself eating grisly chicken. I mentioned it to the server and got the look. I should have sent back the meal and walked out.  If you like cheesy microwave reheated food and hurried service this is the place for you. It sucks!"}
{"text":"A great meal but the highlight was our server Ricardo. Very personable and helpful. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I just reread my review four years ago. It is like deja vu all over again.  The busboy still has mostly a chip and salsa delivery job though when our waitress got sidetracked he brought us more water WHEN we asked. Our waitress had too many tables but couldn't multitask. At the end she apologized for the bad service.  She was always moving so I think Service is a Management problem. The food was good. The drinks were good. We get here about once a year. I suppose a year from now we will feel like trying it again."}
{"text":"March 2018:  this is a nice Mexican Restaurant!  The food is very good and the service is great.  Visit the rest room, the sinks are unique!  Try it, you'll like it."}
{"text":"Had a quick lunch here as I often do after a Home Depot run or when I'm craving chips and salsa.  I have to agree with everyone else's review as far as the price goes; I know it's located in Scottsdale but $4+ for a single taco (and it's funny because that specifically caught my eye when I went yesterday) is stupid, I don't care how much garnish you put on the plate.  I do love when they have their \"margarita sales\" though!    I go here for a few reasons:  it's close.  The salsa is good.  The service is good.  I think the same servers have been there for years and although they never seem to acknowledge that I'm back again (hey, I'm a regular, give me some love please!) they still treat me well.  They're not stingy on the chips and salsa (can you tell this is a major prerequisite for me in judging a Mexican food place?) and the food is decent.  So, I give it an \"A-OK\" as the local Mexican place. Also never crazy busy so there's no wait, and the food is never too spicy so rookie out-of-towners can enjoy their meal too.  If the management is reading this:  your food is pretty good and your waitstaff is very nice, but in general, you're nothing too out of the ordinary and you're scaring away clients with your Scottsdale prices. Take it down a notch and you'll get more neighborhood support. There's WAY too many Mexican places nearby to choose from so do something to make us want to come around more often."}
{"text":"First meal here. Very nice restaurant; recently reminded and done very well. Food is very good for Arizona/Sonoran style Mexican food. Taco salads went well with our group.  The salsa is fresh and good tasting. While I yearn for New Mexico this place will keep me going"}
{"text":"Love the crispy beef tacos!! Their house Margaritas are amazing!!! Their layered salad is my favorite item on the menu!! We ALWAYS ask for Myra to be our server.  SHE is THE best!!!! The hubby likes their Carne Asada and their number 4 combination with a crispy ground beef taco!! Yummy!!!! We came in today and Myra had saved a tip my husband left weeks ago with the receipt because he tipped her too much in the bill.  She wanted to give my husband back the $20 bill. My husband did make a mistake on the tip, but we are sooo appreciative of her honesty!!She is sooooo honest!! Myra always goes above and beyond!! Of course we gave her the $20 back for her honesty!!"}
{"text":"First time eating here. $3.95 happy hour Marquita's. green corn tamales best I've ever had. Tortilla soup excellent  Looking forward to returning soon"}
{"text":"Well I don't understand how people rave about this place, I don't know if it's a chain restaurant but I think it is, the service it's not so good, the portions are ok, and the food is not authentic Mexican, maybe because their location they have many people at lunch time, but I don't think it's because their food.... I like to explore Mexican restaurants but this is a not coming back...thank you."}
{"text":"Most horrible Mexican food today and it's cinco de mayo. Have eating there before but today it was nasty. Complaint online and they gave me a $5 off coupon, no thanks...."}
{"text":"We sat in the lounge because the Colts were playing the Cardinals and found a table with a great view of the many TVs. That was probably the best thing about the evening.  The corn chips were warm and fresh but unfortunately only came in a very small soup bowl. We did order more and they came but at the same time as our food.  We had to order pico de gallo as the complimentary chips only came with salsa. The pico de gallo was ok but not fresh and not worth ordering. The salsa was interesting. Not my favorite, but at least tasted fresh.  I had a miller sharps and I don't think I have ever had a colder \"beer\". Of course Miller Sharps is nonalcoholic but either way, very nice and cold.  I ordered the carne asada. It was not real flavorful. It was tender and good but not great. It actually tasted like a decent steak but I wanted that special spice that makes it Mexican carne asada. It did not have it.  My wife had the beef carne picado and you should too...if you like your dish to have two jalapenos to each piece of tasteless beef. I guess I can't say it was tasteless, it tasted boiled to me. My wife ate most of it but the two little pieces i had were enough for me. I could only muster up enough courage to have on chunk of jalapeno as well. I really enjoyed the re-fried beans that came with her meal. Unfortunately mine came with regular beans that were not that great.   The service was very good. Pleasant, quick and friendly.  I wont go back, I wish I had read some of the reviews first."}
{"text":"I LOVE Mexican food, so even average food will probably garner 3-stars from me.  I would say this is pretty average.  Everything was good, nothing was disappointing (except maybe the tortillas), but nothing was crazy good either.  I will say that while the prices are \"affordable\", I wouldn't call it cheap.  This type of food is not expensive to make nor difficult to prepare, so I think $4.20 for a single taco, for example, is too high.  Combinations run about 10 bucks, specialty dishes $12-$15.  Expect to pay about $8 at lunch.  Overall, not a bad place to go.  I will most likely return if in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I came to Manuel's at 3:00pm for a margarita and a moment to myself.  The restaurant was dead. I walked in and saw no staff, waited 3 minutes and started walking around.... Found the staff hanging out in a booth on phones and hanging out.  Finally I was seated with a menu. 11 minutes later (purse in hand ready to leave) my waitress asks what I want to drink, gets my margarita wrong and has to return it. An employees on break comes outside by me, plops down and starts listening to loud music on her phone and signing. The most unprofessional staff!  My \"steak\" tacos tasted like beef jerky. -I will never be back."}
{"text":"The sign on the outside claimed that this is a \"fine dining restaurant.\"  I suppose it may be fine dining, if you compare it to a restaurant in Tijuana.  So, take their sign with a big grain of salt.  The chips & salsa are better than most.  The chips were fresh and hot and the salsa had a refreshing, cilantro-infused taste to it.    The rest of the food was mushy and bland.  The waitress raised her voice from 15 feet away to ask if our food was okay.  In all, I'd only come back for the chips & salsa."}
{"text":"went there for a lunch on a lazy sunday and it is what it is.  the chips and dip were awesome.  there were 6 of us and the food took a long time.  the lunch room wasnt too busy either.  cost over 100 bucks (all of us had one beer) and they forgot my hot sauce.  but when they remembered that we were in the bar side of the place, it was good.  problem was they forgot alot.   the food is nothing fantastic.  chili's type of food at best.  wasnt disappointed cause that was close to what i expected.  taco was massively oily, beans were burned... the usual.  would i go back?  probably not.  but i had to go once to be able to say it!"}
{"text":"First off, let's just get this straight: Manuel's has THE BEST salsa in town. Period. Having said that, the rest of their menu is pretty fantastic, too. We love the pollo especial, fajitas, rolled quesadilla, green tamales - pretty much you name it, we've eaten it there. Becky is our favorite - and super special - server and she always gives us excellent service. Stop in, say hola, and enjoy some fabulosa comida Mexicana."}
{"text":"Recommended by a friend and she wasn't wrong. Excellent chimichangas, perfectly fried and super flavorful. Just the right amount of guac & sour cream, plus the chips and salsa were a nice freebie. Service was good and attentive; server was a little lackluster, but the sangria was good so who cares. I only had the one dish, but I'd be willing to bet a margarita, a lot of their entrees are similarly delicious."}
{"text":"At Manuel's Mexican Food my wife and I each enjoyed delicious enchiladas served in a reasonable amount of time and HOT!  In my evaluation of restaurants number one on my criteria list is that foods meant to be served temperate to hot should be delivered that way.  Number two is the food should be of good taste, and three includes the attitude of the servers.  We found Manuel's to meet all three measures."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch on Tuesday and what a mistake. Stood at the hostess station for ten minutes and nobody acknowledged us. We finally got our own menus and sat down.   Ordered tea with no lemons and extra glass of ice. Got a tea with extra lemons and no extra glass of ice.  Had our orders wrong. Waitress was very rude and never came back after I complained.  Spoke with Chris the manager who did not care about my concerns about the poor service and issues.  Called the corporate office to complain and left a message with Mr Salazar and still have not heard back.  Last time I eat there and would not recommend this establishment.  There are other choices to spend my money at."}
{"text":"This place has been around for A long time but we just started going a couple of months ago. The staff is really nice. Some of them have obviously have been working there a long time as they seem to know some of the customers. They have a house band although I've never heard them play. The food is very good, hot, and comes out of the kitchen in a reasonable amount of time. Solid choice for a meal."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. Food was bland and everything tasted like lard. Staff was questionable. Paid the bill and left with two plates of food 1/3 eaten. I am done with chain Mexican Restaurants."}
{"text":"First of all, let me say that Manuels is my favorite Mexican food restaurant in the Phoenix area and that this review is long overdue. I've been eating at Manuels in Tempe and Mesa for roughly 30 years and have had hundreds of dinners/lunches there. My review is solely based on the renovations of the Scottsdale and to a slightly lesser degree the Phoenix location. I was so excited to dine at the newly renovated locations, but incredibly disappointed. The look and feel of the renovations look incredibly cheap and poorly designed. The front door looks like it came from Walmart and the led lighting in the entryway makes you feel like your being interrogated. The walls near the booths are covered in the same white dimpled plastic you find in cheap gas station restrooms. I really could go on and on with my critique, but I'm not here to bash my favorite local restaurant chain.  It hurts me to give it 2 stars, but I wanted you to know the opinion of one of your most loyal patrons..... If you want some decorating ideas, please visit the newly renovated Macayos in Tempe and Scottsdale. Please make some changes, start with the lighting, add some vivid colors, use some authentic Mexican decor, etc."}
{"text":"Walked in Sunday at 1pm waited to be seated for 10min and seen by three different staff, no greeting, they saw us standing there and no one said anything to us, that already set the tone, we ended up leaving :("}
{"text":"Love Manuels!!  Always great people and great food at a very reasonable price!!  Not to mention the wonderful refreshing Margaritas!!"}
{"text":"This could be much more, it is still dingy and dirty. The patio is huge new and a wasted opportunity.  Too bad it is dark and tacky. I hope a manager is reading this. You need lighting outside, you need plants, there should be a higher standard of cleanliness. The chairs should be placed neatly after they are bused. I didn't see a a manager once.  The salsa is bland. The other reviewers liked it, inthe past they had a side dish of extra spicy now we just have the extra mild option.  The food is good but could use an update, I agree with other reviewers. This restaurant falls short and is geriatric. I don't mind that this is an older crowd  , but  how is this good business? They have a prime scottsdale location. It must come down to poor management, they are squandering an opportunity.  Get a better manager. Re train your staff. You are heading for obsolescence.  It doesn't have to be.  I find it difficult go there. I went cause my family loves the tamales. They are excellent."}
{"text":"This is my favorite of the chain Mexican restaurants and having family in AZ, I have been to all of them. Consistently good food at fair prices. I prefer a hole-in-the-wall place, but comparing apples to apples, this is the best. Good bar and happy hour too."}
{"text":"So this restaurant has a live band certain nights apparently. The outside appearance is a little rough because they are renovating the restaurant. I was disappointed with the live band, they only catered to the senior citizen crowd. I thought maybe a few spanish songs mixed in there since it is a mexican restaurant would've been greatly appreciated. The drinks disappointingly were not strong either but they were tasty. I got the rolled quesadilla with steak it was delicious, but I wasn't too hungry so it filled me up nice. I wasn't too impressed I'm not sure if I would return. But the staff was very polite."}
{"text":"Favorite Mexican food! Food is consistently good. Good service. Penny is great behind the bar and Christian is the hardest working bus boy ever!"}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant for the very first time last week.  I was so excited to find it and couldn't wait to take my wife on a little date to test out my new found \"treasure.\"  Wow, what a disappointment.  Our server was simply not on his game and we were his \"victims.\"  He took forever to get out drinks and appetizer.  He totally forgot to bring our guacamole appetizer.  He also totally forgot to bring my wife the drink she requested.  The food was bland and more like \"Tex Mex\" rather than legitimate \"sloppy\" good Mexican food.  Just not a good experience sad to say.  PS we sat in the bar area so maybe it would have been better had we sat in the main restaurant.  Wanted to each NCAA championship game."}
{"text":"This place is a neighborhood favorite! They recently remodeled the bar area and patio and it really elevated the ambiance of it. The food is DELICIOUS! Rolled quesadilla, street tacos (amazing deal on happy hour), guacamole (HUGE serving), and their shrimp fajitas are all favorites. Their margaritas are a bit sweet for my taste so I often add an extra shot. Staff is always super friendly."}
{"text":"horrible service, entire order is wrong, waiter extremely rude. never again will we come here."}
{"text":"We've been going to Manuels for years.   Consistent, reliable food and service.  Good margarita's. A good neighborhood place.  Not amazing, not bad. But ask for Mayra!  She is the sweetest server ever."}
{"text":"I haven't been disappointed ever! The people, the food  and the music(weekends) add up to a pleasing experience time and time again. i sit in the bar area booths and can see the T V's plus I especially like my server Tabatha. Tabatha works exclusively in the bar area; she  is friendly competent and caring. Tabatha gets it right and is an Asset to Manuels. Even when she is busy she gives the attention to make sure you feel welcomed and are pleased with your meal.  For excellent Mexican food and good peoole-especially Tabatha - try Manuels -you will probably come back over and over like me! btw I am a lover of chili rellenos - love theirs!"}
{"text":"Every time I go to Scottsdale I make a stop at Manuel's.  Great fast Mexican food!  I usually get the beef enchiladas which are smothered with sauce and cheese.  I have also tried the tacos which are pretty good but I would recommend the enchiladas over anything on the menu.  Nice little outside patio with misters is available."}
{"text":"came here back to back weeks and both times ordered the street tacos and you get 4,, the first time they where a good size the next week they where really small also the first time we sat in the bar area and the waiter was great the next week we sat on the left side of the restaurant and this waiter wasnt good. i was going to give it 4 stars after the first visit but dropping it down to 3 because of the 2nd visit.. Use to love going to the original location growing up as a kid and love the cheesecrisp"}
{"text":"So after two times here with poor service at this location, Manuel's redeemed itself. The food was top quality, and the service was impeccable. It was attentive, prompt, and preemptive. The water and salsa never ran dry. The waiter (I think his name is Bob) was friendly and personable. I'm glad to see Manuel's is back to how I loved it. I always get the #4 combo unless I come on a Monday and get the special with the same things: shredded beef taco, cheese enchilada, and beans. We also get a cheese crisp."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a little snack at about 3pm on Valentines Day...since my sister and I were each cooking dinner we knew this wouldn't ruin our \"non-romantic\" family meals. There was one other other couple in the enitre restaurant. My sister had obviously been there before since she grabbed menus and sat us in the bar right next to the roaring firplace. I was puzzled as it was a beautiful 60 something degree sunny afternoon. The waitress was very pleasant and chatty. She helped us decide what protein we wanted on our Mexican pizza appy. The chicken was a winner and it was great. The appy arrived super fast and HOT. My sister who isn't in the service industry touched the incredibly hot plate and burned her hand. In most other restaurants I have been warned that the plate is super hot. Being in the service industry that is a no brainer for me, however I can see why a consistent warning should be required for those that simply don't think about it. The chips and salsa were excellent. I enjoyed the hot sauce as well as the mild. The waitress brought us 2 mild and a hot to start. My sister asked for a second and  then a third (mild sauce). It never crossed the waitress' mind to ask if she wanted more chips with the mini  salsa buckets, (must have been weird to only me). We had iced teas for beverages which was definitely fresh brewed, sooo nice not to have cloudy.half.day.old tea. The environment was clean, the lone waitress was professional and did an average job with the exception of a chip refill/hot plate warning. Maybe it isn't their policy..not sure as this was my first visit. I will try it again and see how a dinner service runs."}
{"text":"2.5 stars, but I'll round it up for our first visit.  Mom's choice after seeing it featured on Check, Please! Arizona.  We were looking forward to trying the Tres Amigos, for it looked so good on TV.  I thought I heard one of the guests say it was made with flour tortillas, and since I'm allergic to corn, I was happy to hear this.  I didn't even bother to confirm with the server, since I'm tired of asking so many questions.  Well, at least two of the enchiladas were made with corn, so I left that entree for Mom to enjoy.  She favored the chicken tomatillo most.  It was also the only one she found cooked perfectly.  The other two (spinach and shredded beef) had tortillas that were partially-cooked.  We both tried the side of refried beans and liked it.  She thought the rice was terrible and didn't even bother to include it in the leftovers. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/manuels-mexican-food-scottsdale?select=Ra5FvYBankc_ub_K1HrytQ#Ra5FvYBankc_ub_K1HrytQ  I ordered a spinach enchilada in a flour tortilla a la carte. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/manuels-mexican-food-scottsdale?select=aoxX8QUR6l3n4HuOL4dFYw#aoxX8QUR6l3n4HuOL4dFYw  I enjoyed it, even though it's just a tortilla filled with sautÃ©ed spinach and onions, with chopped lettuce and tomatoes on the side.  Would I order it again?  Probably not.  We may return for Mom to try a seafood entree, and I will have to try the beef and chicken enchiladas, but not anytime soon.  The flan was good.  Not the best, as Mom makes the best flan, but we both appreciated this flan's texture.  I actually prefer its flavors the day after. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/manuels-mexican-food-scottsdale?select=LFppwbhhjs4-oTzkyYNesA#LFppwbhhjs4-oTzkyYNesA"}
{"text":"Chain Mexican...the bane of my being.  I've little use for these types of places, but they do serve at least one useful purpose, at least for me anyway. The food is good enough to pass off as your own, but not so good that your guests, the suspicious Mexican couple next door will sniff out your ill-gotten culinary skills. That's right. I said it...there.  Similar to cheating at horse racing, poker, and the way too easy, waiting for my wife to leave the room while I fast-forward puzzle answers on Wheel of Fortune, I routinely have friends and neighbors over for Mexican food I pass off as my own creations.  Here's the funny thing.  Whenever anyone asks for the recipe, I hand over some bullshit recipe I found on the internet. The next time they come over, saying; \"Cheryl made your red chili, but it tasted nothing like this,\" just shrug your shoulders as if to say, \"Sorry Cheryl that you can't cook for shit, it takes years of know-how.\"  Anyway, Manuel's has quite a few dishes that when reheated, taste even better than fresh.  Thanks Manuel's for making me an award-winning Mexican chef."}
{"text":"Family owned for over 25 years at multiple locations. Always great food, with good beans & rice.  They have a killer chimichanga plate, smothered burrito, and good cheese crisps. Service was excellent, all in a fun, upscale casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"First off, I really like their food. I always get the shredded beef.  However, I am writing this really because I was to bring attention to how amazing their manager and staff is.  I ordered carryout in July.  When I went to leave, my car battery was dead (which tends to happen with all cars, new and old, in the hot AZ summer). Frustrated and sweaty, I called my roadside assistance and went back inside to wait in the AC. The manager noticed I was frustrated and hot and asked if I was ok. I explained what happened and he immediately got me water and said he had jumpers in his car.  He retrieved his cables and was able to jump my car no problem!  Thank you for your help! Not only good food but good people!"}
{"text":"Awesome place to fill up! We always come here when we are really hungry for fast service, polite staff and good food. This has been our favorite Mexican food restaurant for 14 years."}
{"text":"We've been coming here for years and consistently have good service and delicious food. Love the margaritas!"}
{"text":"I had Manuel's cater a college graduation party and the food was fantastic!!!!!  They gave me excellent menu selections, the food was ready on time, and the service was amazing!  I will definitely be a return customer.  Thank you Manuel's for making the party a big success!"}
{"text":"Manuel's is the best Mexican food anywhere in any state. They have excellent service, excellent food ,and very reasonable prices. This is my first experience at this Manuel's and it has proved to be just as good if not better than the other ones I have visited in a Phoenix metro area. I am over 55 years of age I have lived in Phoenix my entire life. My wife and our family usually eat at Manuel's no less than two times a month. Give them a try you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great Happy Hour. The bartender, Margo, is super friendly, and we always get great service. Margarita's are good and the chips, are always warm and the salsa is just right.  Their cheese crisp is outstanding, be sure to ask for it crispy. Happy Hour menu has some great food deals.  Definitely our favorite place for Margarita's.  Nice outdoor patio too."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of this place. They have some really good Mexican food here, and good service. My experience didn't blow me away but it was SOLID. The food tastes great and there are enough seats and privacy to be able to have conversations with colleagues. 4 1/2 stars but it rounds up to 5."}
{"text":"very poor service from the moment we walked in and were told not to sit at the mostly empty patio. we couldn't get a straight answer about how long for the patio...so we waited about 10 min. when it became clear he just didn't want to seat us on the patio, we just sat inside. I would say every other table or more was empty, so I suspect the waiting was due to a shortage of staff. our waiter was either very awkward or arrogant. he kind of mocked my mother in law's order. very odd. even with many empty tables, the food took about 20-plus min to come up (we ordered really basic ala carte kind of stuff..tostada, cheese crisp, rice, etc. our food arrived with typical \"careful, the plates are hot,\" which was anything but the truth. my cheese enchilada was tepid at best...to the point the cheese had turned into a congealed lump. at one point I accidentally knocked over a glass of iced tea...I mean ice cubes flying off the table. I would say at least three staff members just mosied on by like they didn't notice. when we finally asked someone to wipe off the table, they said yes and disappeared, never came back. Let's put it this way...I left a 15% tip for the first time in more than a decade....and that felt generous."}
{"text":"First time in. Great service at from Host as I was ordering for Carryout.   Wow, I got home and was blown away with the amount of food, it matched to the price of these days.  I ordered al a carte Chimichanga and  I was still pulling things from the main bag. Chips and Salsa mild/and hot homemade and delicious.  The Shredded beef Chimi was stuffed with meat and was so tasty, the rice was not just spanish rice, it had nice chunks of sauted onions and and peppers. Black beans in another container, like 4oz.  Impressed with the flavor and quantity. I'll be returning soon!!"}
{"text":"Regular customers here. Manuel's never fails to exceed expectations! Marya is our favorite waitress- very attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"Manuel's- or Mannie's has pretty decent Mexican food and lower prices than say, Carlos O'Brien's or Macayo's.  Since I live in the area, my roomie and I always go for happy hour and enjoy cheap margaritas and half priced apps- not too shabby.  If you happen to go and sit in one of the booths by the mural, take a really good look at it. For some reason we always crack up about it. There's a tiny hut, a large man that couldn't possibly fit into the hut and tiny mountains...hmm. Now that I write this, it's not as funny. But after a few margaritas, I'm sure it will be again."}
{"text":"We have eaten at Manuel's many times in the past and have enjoyed the food.  Last Sunday we went for lunch ~2:30pm and found the \"greeter\" standing at the bar talking with other patrons.  He came over and greeted, and sat us, then returned to his conversation at the bar.  That was the last employee we saw during our 15 minute wait - all within view of the greeter.  We finally left without ever being served - very disappointed and not sure if we will ever return ."}
{"text":"For the most part I enjoy the food at Manuel's except for one issue. The lettuce looks fresh but has a chemical taste and smell to it. I don't know if that is a preservative but it is not appealing. Also, If you sit in the dining room the music from the bar overwhelms you. It is too loud."}
{"text":"This is the best Manuel's I have been to here in the valley. It is nice and clean, has a friendly staff, a great location, and decent Mexican food overall. You won't find anything here too adventurous - nothing to burn your tongue or gross out your Mom. The food is well prepared and the rice and beans are perfect. Their Margaritas looked pretty good, though we behaved ourselves for once. *\"Ajo Al's\" down the street might be a better choice."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. Enough to think I've got a grasp of what to expect.  The food here is not quite the great mexican food we have in San Diego, but almost nothing really is in Phoenix. The meat is a little more dry, the rice just isn't right, everything is just a little lower in scale.  Rating on Phoenix standards, the place is okay. The atmosphere is okay, the service is good, you don't wait forever for your food.  I'll eat here every so often as other people I know seem to really like it."}
{"text":"Very Good Food in Generous Portions a bit expensive served by a gracious waitstaff--undermanned when we were there."}
{"text":"We are from CT and every time we come to Arizona this is the first place we go to eat."}
{"text":"If you choose to go here, be warned that there is one very nasty waitress (she calls all the women \"mama\") who decided that she doesn't like me and let my wife and I know it.  Never had an issue with any other server there (or her that I can think of) but there it is for your consideration.  If you sit on thy bar area you can avoid her."}
{"text":"The best Mexican restaurant in Scottsdale. During the daytime a server names Juan is quick and very attentive, beyond expectations.   The food is good and the best chips and salsa, and spanish rice, Margarita's also."}
{"text":"Service was fine during lunch.  Not many patrons in the place.  Food was nothing memorable."}
{"text":"We've eaten here once or twice before and this time didn't disappoint. Despite being noon on Sunday, there wasn't a huge football crowd and we were seated right away. The salsa here is delicious and fresh. I ordered the fish tacos which were excellent - fresh and light. One thing I appreciate about Manuel's: when you ask for a side of something, you get plenty. My husband ordered a side of sour cream and got almost a cup's worth and I got three nicely-sized slices of lime with my tacos. They don't scrimp!"}
{"text":"Very good Mexican food. Their chips & salsa are outstanding. Best beef fajitas in town - flavorful and not too fatty like at other Mexican restaurants. The decor is typical Mexican/Southwestern but could use some updating. The baskets of fake flowers are dusty and just plain ugly. The service is always friendly and attentive."}
