{"text":"Really charming restaurant. Service was very friendly. The food was delicious. Tried the braised lamb and the stuffed peppers. Very big portion size and reasonably priced. Would really recommend!"}
{"text":"Exquisite, I felt I was at my grandmother's on a Friday night after school. The food is delicious and the service is perfectly friendly yet not fake. Best Greek in town, order from the counter as  hus is what Christina cooked for the day. Remember to ask for grilled lamb chops"}
{"text":"A very nicely set, cozy, authentic and clean Greek restaurant that I finally tried after reading all the very positive reviews here. A good variety amount of Greek specialty food from any food group your heart would desire, they have it. I'm not sure if I have anything valuable to add onto all the good reviews that I agree with over here but I'll go ahead and add a few lines just so.... ummm to feel important?   Ok, so as you can see in the pic, I tried the stuffed peppers but I thought I'd made a bad choice from the first bite because the nice lady there recommended me to try their roast pork which of course I had to decline even after sampling a bite which I should admit it was awesome. I can be a very good decision maker sometimes. ? Yeah that's a facepalm.   The dish comes with two stuffed peppers, stuffing is a mix of rice and minced meat along with three slices of Greek potatoes. Honestly, the dish is good generally speaking but IMO nothing to rave about. I found it lacking some punch bcs where I come from, dishes are bursting with flavours and spices. Taste is a tricky subjective thing, I'll leave it there specially for this nice joint.   My only gripe was the price. For $15 plus tip and tax that comes to $20-$21, I think it's overpriced for what you get for whatever you see in the pic at a regular family run small place such as this that has neither exorbitant rent to pay nor the niche to be called an upscale restaurant.   Will I go back? Definitely yes but definitely not for the same dish. I'll try their every other single dish I saw there today, I'm sure they're all tasty and authentic that worth trying. Will I bitch about the price? Yep you guessed right"}
{"text":"It was okay, but not more than that. I think I walked in with high expectations based on a friend's recommendation, so that may have contributed to my overall disappointment.   To be honest, I think I'm probably not the biggest fan of Greek food, so don't base yourself entirely on me for this one. This place was recommended to me by a pretty good source who claimed they offer legit Greek food. I was a little turned off by the cafeteria style pre-made meals sitting on the counter in warmers, but decided to try the porc roast and moussaka, which I shared with my husband. Both were okay, but insanely heavy. We ended up leaving with lots of leftovers.   The service was good and efficient, the prices reasonable and the place was cute. Overall I'd say if you're in this area, it's probably not a bad bet, but I would not make a trip of it."}
{"text":"First let me just say thank you to my wife's, Greek co-workers for telling us about this place. What a fantastic restaurant. The owners and staff were so friendly and welcoming. They had toys for the kids. We told them it was our first visit, and they gave us such an amazing experience, that we'd go back for the service. Now the food was far and way the best Greek I've had. The selection was unbelievable: pastitsio, roast pork, drunken lamb, saganaki shrimp, calamari, cod, stuffed cabbage and that was only what we had... there was also stuffed peppers, moussaka, goat etc etc. Now I'm a fan of Greek food, but normally I find it can be overly oily and salty. Not here my friends. They have it down. I can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Cet endroit m'a été recommandé par une famille Grecque et nous y sommes allés pour découvrir ce qu'est vraiment la cuisine Grecque en dehors des gyros et salades bien connus. Nous avons adoré l'ambiance familiale, les plats présentés a l'avant du resto a même les plaques de cuisson. Tellement authentique. On peut vous dire exactement les ingrédients présents dans chaque plat, ils vous font des recommandations aussi et vous pouvez parler à l'équipe qui cuisine. Le cadre est sans prétention mais très accueillant. Les portions très généreuses et cela peut faire le dîner du lendemain. Les plats changent selon l'humeur de la chef de cuisine a priori."}
{"text":"Amazing food and experience, very friendly owners. We had mentioned we were from out of town and they went above and beyond. Amazing service and a very homey feel! Amazing food tasted very authentic. Excited to visit again in the future"}
{"text":"Certain things we ordered were very good but certain were not so great. They do the best they can with all that massive selections of ready to eat food. We just wish they can downsize the menu a bit so they can focus on what they do well. Still have that home cook food comfort. And can someone please tell that poor nice lady chef to take a break!! She reminds me of my family who'd overworked in their 60s."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't written a review about Christina's My family and I have been there at least a dozen times  Excellent food  Prepared by real greek ladies  When they say homemade, they REALLY mean it There is no 1 dish I can recommend without insulting the rest of the menu Go, your taste buds will thank you"}
{"text":"This little out of the way place was recommended by friends. Service was exceptional, food was great. It really had the feeling of a family run business that cares for the clients."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  I recommend the roasted pork with the Greek potatoes.  We also had the baklava cheesecake and it also was excellent.  My kids had the souvlaki with fries.  They really liked it and the fries are excellent."}
{"text":"First time here and the experience was very mixed. Obviously the owner cares about his menu and food, but the setup is very non-intuitive. You pay for the main ingredient (lamb, porc, pepper) but have no idea what it comes with. When we asked about several dishes, he clearly got annoyed, but this was his messed up menu idea. Forget switching his overboiled potatoes for a salad- not even an option.  We settled on a menu item and one of those mystery plates. The food was rather bland, the hot peppers were tart and expired, very few dishes had much flavour. Compared to Marvins, Villa du Souvlaki and other greek institutions, this was a massive disappointment. Majorly overpriced given what you get.  5 star reviews are probably by friends and family. I give a bonus star for the owner seeming to care, but only worth 1 star. Not going back."}
{"text":"For once the 5 star \"Woohoo! As good as it gets!\" is a legit rating.  Christinas Cuisine is one of my favorite spots to eat lunch and I actively attempt to go there once a week. Everything I've eaten there has been 4 stars and above with a few of them being outright amazing!!!   WHAT A HIDDEN GEM!  Yero pita (lamb/pork), souvlaki pita, Gemista (stuff baked peppers with meat & vegetarian options), Greek Potatoes..... everything feels incredibly home-made and authentic to Greek cuisine. I've brought Greek co-workers and they've loved it as well.  They have a daily hot table with fresh food ready to jump into your plate after being warmed up for a few minutes, it's nice to see what the deals of the day are and they always hit the mark. It's like walking into your grandmother's home and having 10 different dishes you can stuff your face with.  The staff is incredibly competent and efficient. Very friendly and they are passionate about their business. I highly recommend this place if you love Greek food or want to try it.  Cost is very reasonable and of high value.  5 STARS!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were in laval on business and decided to stop at Christinas Cuisine because of the position feedback on Yelp. We were so happy we did! Authentic Greek home cooking at it's best! We tried several items on the menu and have to say it was all A++. Our waiter was soo friendly and the service was fast. Greek paintings and greek music playing was the perfect setting to eat such a fantastic meal"}
{"text":"The only authentic greek food in Montreal. Fresh food cooked daily, beautifully displayed in steam tables. Go up, have a look, ask questions, order what your eyes desire."}
{"text":"Great new greek resto in laval. Brings me back to the Hermes days in parkex. Excellent variety I tried 5 different dishes. All great. Just like mama used to make. I especially liked the roast pork which is their specialty. I will sure be back for take home food."}
