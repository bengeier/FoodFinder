{"text":"Service was ok , went with friends and realized that all our dishes had the same salty sauce. décor is dated to put it nicely. I recommend trying La Croisee in Leaside if your looking for an authentic French dish."}
{"text":"I went on Valentine's day with my bestie and had french onion soup, fois gras, a duck dish and a seafood dish. I can't remember their names...The portions were big, being girls maybe, we were full after the soup and fois gras before the main were served. I love the food! Great service, the waiter's name was Peter, and he was very always paying attention to our bread and water. I had a great time."}
{"text":"There is almost nothing redeeming about this place.  I wanted something close by and picked this because other places were busy, big mistake by me.  The price of the food is competitive with the area so it has that going for them. The quality of the food and service, however, leaves much to be desired. I ordered the rack of lamb, medium rare. When the food came is was closer to medium well. I politely informed the server and he offered to redo the dish. The dish came back the same, medium well and when I informed the server he told me that sometimes the light will affect the colour of the meat to make it look more cooked than it actually is. Let me say that I've eaten my fare share of lamb and steak, I know what medium rare is and what I got was not. The server implied that it was cooked correctly and he was really doing me a big favour. One of the worst restaurants in Toronto.   Stay away!"}
{"text":"We had the Summerlicious menu for lunch. $20 for a choice of 3 starters, mains and deserts - sounded like a deal and the patio looked appealing.  The menu was very bland and tasteless.  When we questioned the waiter about the fish which on the menu stated Sea Bass but in reality was Tilapia, we were told by the waiter that the Chef had told him it was Sea Bass and that we were  \"not to shoot the messenger\"!  The calvados sauce with the mushrooms and chicken was overpowering and unpleasant.  The desserts followed the !listlessness of the first two courses. The Summerlicious program in Toronto is a chance to show off the specialities of the restaurant at a trial price to encourage repeat visits. This menu, complete with a typing error, should have pre-warned us.  The whole experience showed a lack of  interest and the intent was more to make a profit from a $20.00 menu than to positively showcase the restaurant.  $20 wasn't a deal and we won't be going back."}
{"text":"Was walking through Yorkville looking for a spot and happened upon Le Trou Normand.  Fantastic feel, food, and service.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Last time I was at Le Trou Norman was for Summerlicious. It was a 2 star then and it still is.  I recently went back after dinner in Yorkville for crème brûlée and  some drinks. It wasn't a busy night and the ambiance inside was a lot nicer than their outside patio where I sat last time (they even had a guy playing french songs on the acrodeon).   Being a fancy French restaurant in Yorkville, you'd think that they could at least do crème brûlée correctly right? Mais non! Although it means \"burnt creme\" you don't actually BURN the hell out of the creme! Instead of having a nice crunchy caramelized coating, it had a thick, black, charred coating that tasted like charcoal. Also it came in a small/deep ramekin dish (I much prefer the large shallow ones) which meant that the top was charred to a crisp and the bottom was ice cold.  Come on guys, you've disappointed me twice and now it's because of a simple French dessert. I don't think I'll be coming back here again."}
{"text":"The negative reviews almost made me cancel my reservation, but I'm glad i didn't. Yes, the place was dead, but the food was excellent and the service extremely good. The french onion soup and foie gras topped mignon were a treat for my meat loving partner, and the veal medallions were perhaps the best I've ever had"}
{"text":"Bad service, small portions of food and a little bit expensive, didn't like it"}
{"text":"Quaint, provincial feel. From the outside, a narrow patio area leads to the entrance. Only one wait staff, who turned out to be the owner. Said her waiter took the day off today, so she was filling in. Lady by the name of Linda from Inner Mongolia.   French bread was crisp on the outside, soft and warm on the inside. The small bowl of French onion soup was extra cheesy. For appetizers, had the escargot as well as the frog legs. The escargot was pretty special, topped with a breaded shell. Tasted both the rack of lamb as well as the seafood combo platter with mussel, jumbo shrimp, scallop, and salmon. Each entree came with a side of rice, broccoli, asparagus, zucchini, and thinly sliced radishes. For dessert, ordered the homemade creme brulee as well as the creme caramel.   The restaurant was definitely on the pricey side, running about $160 Canadian dollars for two people."}
{"text":"Summerlicious 2010 Menu  Despite the very mixed reviews, hubby and I decided to go to Le Trou Normand for lunch during Summerlicious. I had been wanting to check out this place on my own for a while now and I was prepared for a meal that was either  \"unpleasant\" as Philip Q. said or \"pretty special\" like Howard H raved. Sadly I cannot be a tie breaker as I found myself thinking both gentlemen were right in their own way.  Let's start with the positive... I enjoyed the choices on the Summerlicious menu. After reading about the Sea Bass in reality being Tilapia, we decided to ask about it. Today the Sea Bass was Sea Bass and my hubby by day fisherman by night husband confirmed upon arrival that it was indeed Sea Bass. I ordered the roasted chicken and thoroughly enjoyed it.  Now with the not so good part... I am thinking they were short staffed because our wait time between our salad and main course was over 40 minutes! The restaurant was fairly empty and the waiters were running around like chickens with their head cut off.   The waiters were not attentive at all, no one came by to see if we liked everything (even though we did) and when our Perrier ran out no one offered us anything more to drink. The dessert was probably my least favourite part. I ordered the Apple pie and found it pretty bland.   Considering how expensive this place is on a regular day and how many other places in the city I'd like to try, I probably won't be returning to Le Trou Normand anytime soon."}
