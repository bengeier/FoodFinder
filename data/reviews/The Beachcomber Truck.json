{"text":"I have only had a few items from the menu (quinoa bowl, Caribbean chicken and rice, and parmesan tots) - but they are each amazing. I order the Caribbean chicken every week at Walnut Wednesday! I don't even bother trying any other food trucks...it's that good."}
{"text":"Lots of food trucks today at Walnut Wednesday, I could not decide which one to eat at! Then I saw a guy walking with this quinoa jerk chicken salad. Something that looked tasty and not going to give me a heart attack!  And I love heart attack food! I was happy with my choice, very tasty! Filling, flavorful and healthy. Had lentils, squash, cranberries and feta in it too. Food came up fast. Really nice folds running the place. Big portion, I had left overs, will be so good for breakfast! Really wanted to try the mac & cheese topped with brisket, maybe next time!"}
{"text":"Came to this food truck on Walnut Wednesday. They stood out from the other food trucks based on their tropical inspired menu (hence the name \"beach\"comber). They had shrimp tacos, jerk chicken over coconut rice, ahi tuna salad, ahi tuna tacos, buffalo chicken pierogies and parmesan tater tots.  Trying to keep it on the healthier side, I ordered the ahi tuna salad. The tuna was well prepared, pink in the center with a subtle peppery crust and thinly sliced over a variety of greens. I could eat tuna like this everyday and I'm not a big seafood person. They use a ginger citrus soy based dressing which was bright and refreshing. My only disappointment was not having enough of the dressing. Even after mixing thoroughly, many of my greens remained sad and dry.   At $11, it is pricey but very tasty. Would have again but will probably try a different truck every Wednesday!"}
{"text":"Had the Beachcomber truck out for an event, everyone loved it! I had the Cuban and Parmesan Truffle Tots, they were great! The Brisket Mac n Cheese was awesome and very filling! The Quinoa Bowl was very popular! Fun staff, definitely will have them out again!"}
{"text":"Stopped by Walnut Wednesday in downtown Cleveland and walked past 16 food trucks.  At the 17th truck, I decided to order.  I saw a Cuban sandwich on the menu, which piqued my interest.  So that's what I ordered, along with some Brussels sprouts.  There are a lot of new food trucks in CLE and this one wasn't on yelp prior to me adding it.  Welcome to yelp, Beachcomber!  May your food be tasty and your reviews positive!  My Cuban sandwich was very tasty, but I found myself wanting more filling.  It was low on meat, but delicious.  As for the Brussels sprouts - they were amazing!  They had bacon and other yummy stuff that made me want more.  They were sliced and fried so they cooked quickly.  I would definitely recommend these.  I'll be back to taste some tater tots.  Recommend."}
