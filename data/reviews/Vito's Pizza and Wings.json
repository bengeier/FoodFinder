{"text":"Their pizza could use a bunch more cheese. It was uninspiring to say the least."}
{"text":"I live in burlington i have their pizza once a week and its one of the best pizza i ever had their wings are mind blowing and they have good staff!"}
{"text":"Excellent price.  Excellent taste.   Nice meaty wings 
Close to home.  It's perfect for a quick dinner and in a pinch."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza and wings.  Fresh.  Ask for their pick up specials, you'll get a great deal!  They also have halal toppings for those who observe islamic principles."}
{"text":"Very good wings. Though different from what you would expect from a bar or pub. I don't usually like large wings but they are part of what makes these special. The service was great very small town or Cheer's like. They make you feel like your a friend of the family. 

With a large teenage and young adult population in the area the service cab be a bit brash. You have been warned, remember it's just some fun and nothing more. Also this maybe the source for the concern on price as they are very fair compared to any bar or pub. I like it saucy and paid the extra and still feel the price was fair.

So if you're looking for very good wings but something different give these a try."}
{"text":"Tried Vito's pizza at a party and they had a super crazy spicy veggie pizza. Ordered from Vito's today for the first time...had asked for a vegetarian pizza with half of it made with some spicy ingredients (chili, red chili flakes, cilantro). Also asked for thin crust. The pizza was confusing..saw cilantro on the entire pizza, garlic on half and couldn't find green chilis on it. When tasting it, it was not spicy and both sides of the pizza seemed fine same. Pizza was also not thin crust as requested. Overall, for more than $20 for each speciality pizza was a bit disappointed that we didn't get what we ordered. On the plus side, delivery is free"}
{"text":"Ordered their amazing pizza through skip the dish. Showed up quick and nice and hot. Tons of toppings, more than most restaurants would give that's for sure. Also the marinara sauce is actual sauce not some fake crappy stuff in a sealed package. I would definitely suggest ordering from them and I plan on ordering again very soon. Not much left for the picture as we devoured most of it. The price is a little bit higher than the main stream pizza places but it's definitely worth it! Enjoy"}
{"text":"My kids' favourite pizza. Personally I'm not a fan, very skimpy on the cheese. And I'm a man who likes cheese on his pizza :)"}
{"text":"Had their pizza delivered a few times. Good pizza, generous and fresh toppings. Had anchovies which can be hard to find."}
{"text":"Everything tastes like ass and they try to rip you off. Do not go here. This place went down hill big time and it wasn't anything special before going down hill."}
{"text":"This is not the best pizza in oakville. The price makes it a great choice during late nights or for some drunken food. Other than that they do not offer much besides a great walk in special."}
{"text":"I went in not expecting much based on the reviews I read, but the service was pleasant and better yet the pizza was pretty good."}
