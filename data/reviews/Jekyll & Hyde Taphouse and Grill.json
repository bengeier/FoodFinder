{"text":"Let me start with the atmosphere.. loved it steampunk, Halloween decor , good music. Even the \"library\" was a nice added touch.

Our waitress, she was sweet, friendly and a pleasure to talk to. 

Now the bad part. The $15 shepherds pie.  Made with beef not lamb and portion.was small and  worthy of a $9 price. So many peas and very light on meat.  Jekyll burger and chips,  very good. Beer list very good. 

Would I return? Yes. Just won't  get the shepherds pie"}
{"text":"First visit tonight, and I really hope this place does well. Great decor and atmosphere. The bar area and outdoor fire table are awesome. Our waitress was fantastic (and I wish I could remember her name to give her the props deserved).  Quick to be seated and food came out reasonably fast. In general, great experience. 

However, what they will need to fix is the price point. Food is good. Not exceptional. But it is priced for the high end, and they are not there. I got 7oz steak $17. A Ribeye is $22. A filet is $24. Would go down road to Texas Roadhouse for a better steak for less. Caprese chicken sandwich was good... $11.   Burger... $10. Know a few other people who went and they all said same as I am...cool place, good food. Just pricey for what it is. 

I will go back, but will eat appetizers at the bar, which is more it's sweet spot. If they are going for more, hopefully owners read this and adjusts."}
{"text":"Randomly came across this place on Yelp when we were in the area. The food was great, the atmosphere made for a wonderful date night and Molly's service was fantastic! Definitely try the Irish nachos and shepards pie. On our go to list!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place...wonderful food and friendly people! The food was really good quality; I like how there are options for folks who are trying to be good, and then options for folks who want to eat up a storm!! Really cool decor and a very welcomed addition to Matthews! Looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"Love the decor and atmosphere of this restaurant.  We were a party of 7 on Sunday for lunch.  We received prompt service and were shown both the brunch and regular menus.  There is an extensive draft menu and speciality cocktails which impressed my table.  The appetizers we ordered were hot and delivered promptly.  Our table ate from both menus and there were clean plates all around!! We tried the Shepherds Pie, Fish and Chips, Buffalo Nachos, Burgers, Onion Rings and Spinach Dip.  Must try the cupcakes and cheesecake as these desserts were scrumptious too.  We will be going back again and again.  Can't wait to try a new item from the menu."}
{"text":"Great concept and the food is amazing. Whether you are out on the town or just need a quick beer and burger, i highly recommend stopping in."}
{"text":"Very good beer list; mostly NC breweries with a few craft brewers from other states.  And Bud Light, not that that matters at all."}
{"text":"Service was awful..  We were there 10 minutes to get water and another 15 for our drinks.  After an hour with no appetizer we decided to leave.  We were there once before and the food was good and service was ok but we attributed that to the restaurant being new, so we went back and were  disappointed.  Too bad... it is a great idea.  Unless their service improves I am not sure they will survive."}
{"text":"Tonight was our 2nd time at Jekyl. The 1st was opening weekend so I definitely understand some hiccups on that visit. I didn't expect to be told that what I ordered had been 86'd when the rest of our table was being served their entrees, but it was opening night. Tonight we arrived at 7:30 and sat at 7:40. It was crowded but not crazy crowded. Our server was great, we ordered 2 apps and meals for 5 of us at 8:00. After 10 minutes our server told us the kitchen was backed up and food would be a bit longer. We had no issues with this as we were having a good time. At 9:00 our entrees were served. The apps never arrived. The burger was good although not cooked to temp ordered, but it was still good. I so want to give his place a 5 star as I love the inside and servers have been great. Unfortunately, the kitchen needs a lot of work and there needs to be some hands on management.  It's usually not difficult to pick out the managers, but I didn't see any management on the floor talking to tables. The servers were left on their own. If this place doesn't figure out the kitchen and parts of the front of the house it won't be around long. The servers are the main reason for 3 stars."}
{"text":"My husband and I went in a few minutes before 7  on Saturday night.We were seated within 3 minutes. We ordered our drinks a water  and sprite as well as a chip appetizer. Chips came. They were ok. Over thirty minutes after we ordered our food we were still waiting for our main dish.  I went to hostess and asked for bill for chips and soda and explained about having to wait and why we wanted to leave. The right thing to say would have been we are sorry don't worry about check. Instead she got our waitress so that she could give us our check. As this was happening they brought our food out  to the hostess table and offered to wrap it up.Wrong.  We waited too long. We won't be back. I also think they need to reorganize their flow of traffic. Employees were constantly walking in front of hostess area to bring food outside or bring dishes inside."}
{"text":"They have done a really nice job with the building and atmosphere, and the waitresses' steam punk look certainly separates them from the sports bar options around.  I like the menu and 50 craft beers on tap is terrific.  However, this may be the loudest restaurant I have even been in which made conversation with our friends a challenge, and that is why we went out to dinner together.

There is a menu item for a 1/2 rack of ribs, and in the description it offers a full rack for $4.99 more.  I ordered \"the ribs\", and ended up with the full rack.  Maybe our waitress thought if she bumped up the check it would bump up her tip, or maybe it was so loud she couldn't hear me.  Either way I did not appreciate it.  We did not often see our waitress, but the bus boy did offer to clear my plate half-way through my meal.

I guess the bottom line is this is a nice addition to Matthews, and I hope they are successful.  They have only been open a few weeks, so maybe some of the staff issues will shake themselves out.  I am not sure what they can do about the noise level.  Sitting outside may help when the weather is nice."}
{"text":"One of the best places for a meal in Matthews. The food is cooked to perfection, huge selection of beers, great mixed drinks, friendly and amazing staff. Try the rib eye and pretzels. Finish off your meal with a beer from the large selection. I take my hat off to the owner."}
{"text":"Second time here.  First time was ok. Food is actually pretty good.  Service is spotty."}
{"text":"Went last night, got seated right away at front patio, then just sat there with no service, drinks, nothing. 45 minutes went by. Waiter completely ignored us while taking care of other tables around us. We finally walked out and ate at a place where our business was appreciated"}
{"text":"At some point, it's about the food. You can have great decor and dress the servers in quirky or trendy attire, but you have to have good food. We went on a Friday night and the place was packed. The hour long wait turned out to only be about half that. I understand orders sometimes go wrong, but they missed on both my wife's and mine. My burger, ordered medium rare, was delivered well done and my wife's did not have the sauce on the side as requested, so the rest of us were left to eat while it took 10 minutes to redo. Other than the server bringing a beer over and offering it to me (it wasn't what I was drinking plus I was driving - in fact, I'm pretty sure it was one they had poured by mistake anyway), no effort or comment was made. I'm guessing with all the options in the are we won't be back."}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere, great food, and Molly provided fantastic service! Blueberry cheesecake is amazing."}
{"text":"This WAS my favorite place until an incident happened where my mothers plate broke and had a piece of glass in her burger! Although they should have checked her food before it came out. They didn't and served it to my mom. Thankfully she caught as she was removing her tomato from the burger. After I let the waitress know. The manager came to apologize and tell us that it happens!! IT HAPPENS!! She proceeded to say that they are working on a new order for my mother. I guess it was only for the burger because they just put the previous fries on a new plate and still served it to my mother. Needless to say that if my mother would have been bit into that burger without moving the tomato then we would be in the hospital right now. When I approached the manager regarding this (brunette, skinny, middle aged), she said \"well nothing happened\"!!! That was her response!! Ofcourse , she said we make sure this wouldn't happen again but that response was rude, inconsiderate and absolutely unacceptable! I will not return to this place unless it's under new management. They lost a very loyal customer. I usually go there during my lunch hours as I have done today. But this is the last time!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit! The food was really good! Hospitality was spot on and the atmosphere was inviting! The cheesecake was delicious!  I will definitely return with our business colleagues!"}
{"text":"After three attempts at this place, we've given up. The tap list is the only thing that led us to try again, and then one more time. And it's just not worth it. First visit was basic unpleasantness. Dirty counter at the bar. Ignored by the bartender while he talked with a friend - who was sitting right next to me. Eventually given service that seemed an inconvenience to him and bordered on rude. Loved the attempt at calling me by name after we paid, from reading my debit card. But he couldn't even get that right. Wife and I both have extensive food service and hospitality experience. We have standards, but are also very polite and patient. We've been there.

Second try was also at the bar, and little better, from a service perspective. No greeting, no interest in interaction. Many people behind the bar, and none of them so much as looked at us until long after we arrived. Again, we seemed an inconvenience. By this point we had caught on to the very proprietary attitude of the employees. They acted like it was their place, and we were lucky to be there. 

Last attempt. It was a nice day, and the patio wasn't at all crowded. Figured a drink outside wouldn't be as irritating as sitting at the bar. Asked at the bar if we would get service outside, and we were told yes. Went to patio to find that most tables had a reserved sign, but sat at one of two that didn't. Waited. Waited. Finally greeted by \"you can't sit here, this table is reserved.\" No greeting, no apology. After pointing out that there wasn't a sign saying so, we were directed to sit on the (very dirty) couches in the corner. So we did, but the server didn't follow us over. Waited some more. Finally gave up and asked for a manager. Of course he was all apologies, even offered us dinner on the house. Asked if there was anything he could do to regain our business and I'll end this review with our answer. \"No.\""}
{"text":"went for lunch today with my wife to Jekyll and Hyde in Matthews.  The best move that we have made in quite a while...the décor of the restaurant is really quite nice and gives you a nice comfy feeling...just got in before the lunch specials were over  so my wife had a burger and onion rings and I had the salad and flatbread (chicken)...we have lived in the Charlotte Area for 38 years and in my wife's words, \"the best burger and rings\" she has ever had here in the Carolinas ....my flatbread was excellent and the salad gave it nice touch....our waitress, Alex, was extremely helpful and kept filling up our glasses as soon as they got close to being empty. This is the 2nd time I have been there and the food was excellent again!  And my wife has reminded me  to express kudos to the chefs as they made her burger (well done) moist and very tasty and her roll was to die for...So, .we now have a place in Matthews that we can go to get some delicious food, served in a very nice and comfy restaurant, and served by a very competent and cheerful wait staff...you guys made it a great day....thank you. Very highly recommend that you give it a try..."}
{"text":"Food was meh!!! Nothing to call home about! We sat on the patio and that was nice! Great selection of beers! Would recommend for a happy hour, but not for dinner."}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool. It's like the bartenders and staff all have a british/1700s/Goth theme going with their outfits. Beautiful decor such as high ceilings with elaborate tile as well as a dark wood finish around the whole place. Awesome selection of craft beer and the Irish Nachos were killer. The only thing is that if you plan to go during the weekend, plan for it to be pretty packed at the bar area. The bartenders were attentive and friendly but seemingly a bit overwhelmed and it took a bit to get me and my dad my drinks. I don't blame them when the whole bar is packed shoulder to shoulder! Overall I would say it was a good experience and I'll definitely be back again"}
{"text":"Great restaurant and brewery in Matthews.  Came there as part of a business meeting dinner so we had 20 people.  They were able to serve all of us at the same time and it isn't easy to deliver hot food to that many people at the same time.  The service was great and the food was pretty good.  Bree really knows how to run that restaurant.  Many great beers on tap and everyone had a really good time.  I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Very poor service.  Took about 40 minutes to get a burger at bar.  Bartender didnt seem to care. Never refilled drinks, she seemed out to lunch!

Food was average, for the price expected better.  

Good atmosphere and selection of drafts, but not enough to bring me back."}
{"text":"Irish nachos are hands down one of the best things I've ever tasted, absolutely genius!"}
{"text":"My family went out to dinner here this past weekend and had a wonderful experience.  The food was different and the waitress we had was the best!  I can't remember her name, but she gave my kids hand written jokes with our check.  It was such a nice touch... and of course the kids loved it."}
{"text":"First time here and I'm in love! My girlie-girl side swooned when I discovered that they have prosecco on draft and it's served with blue and blackberries inside! The Irish nachos were a huge hit with my husband - he loved the flavor combination and the best of the best was the Brekkie Burger with onion rings. Oh maaaan! It's got candied bacon and English bacon, mozzarella cheese and a perfectly over easy egg on top with some green onions -- it was perfection! The service was efficient, fast and accurate! I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Fun place!  Great atmosphere and steampunk decor.  Love the pretzel sticks and dip, the nachos, and the salads, especially the Irish Farm Salad.  My dining companion is a Brit and he had the bangers and mash one time and the sheppard's pie the second time we came here.  He raved about them. The burgers looked amazing. Love the cool fire table on the patio and the live music.  Will come back often."}
{"text":"Excellent service with Molly, she was awesome! 
I had the Shepherds pie, it was yummy!!  Food is always wonderful here, would certainly recommend."}
{"text":"Gimmick!  Wings were not good.  Truffle fries were not good. Left after appetizers. Didn't order entree.  Good beer selection but....the one I wanted was unavailable. Overall. 

Thank you Frank for your reply.  Maybe it was just an off time. I'm moving to the area. Hope round 2 is better."}
{"text":"Stopped back in Monday around 4 p.m. on my way through Matthews.  Had a Mother Earth Weeping Willow Wit...yummy!  Felicia took great care of me, but honestly all of the bartenders are very attentive at J&H.  Music in the bar was w-a-y better this time, though...Artic Monkeys, Beck, Cold War Kids, and Vampire Weekend :)"}
{"text":"Interesting menu with items you don't find in most places. Food has been good both times we've been there, and we will be back. Service also pretty good, but we tend to go in off hours so can't comment about busy times."}
{"text":"My new favorite spot!!! I have been here numerous times and have not had a bad experience or meal/drink yet. The amount of thought and planning on there decor and menu shows. 

Food- I have liked everything i have tried from the filet to salads and sides. Presentation is nice so this is a good date night spot.

Staff- Professional and very friendly. Service has always been prompt and fast

Atmosphere- Great stem punk theme. I like how the restaurant is divided from the bar. Cute outdoor patio with fire. 

Prices- Good for quality of food and no higher than anywhere else. Specialty cock tails are higher because they are specialty. Normal drinks in line with other local spots. 

Great addition to Matthews!"}
{"text":"First time here!  I enjoyed the service, food and drinks.  The Pink Lady and Heated Affair were both delicious, albeit pricey for such a small drink in a martini glass.  My French onion soup, as well as the \"hot, charred\" chicken wings, were really good and the homemade bleu cheese dressing is superb. I've got no complaints at all.  Mr T had BLT wedge salad, and flatbread. He wasn't thrilled with their salad options, however, he did like the food. 
One thing is for sure, they do need to have something installed to help absorb some of the sound - it was quite loud in there."}
{"text":"The food is always good. The service is hit or miss. 

Last night we sat outside. Waited almost 20 minutes for a server. When I said something the server said he didn't think we had waited that long. 

We had to ask for plates for our appetizers and those came after we finished and only 2 plates when there were four of us. 

Only one of our group was asked if he'd like a refill. I had to ask for more water. 

We were there for over 90 minutes and saw our waiter about 4 times."}
{"text":"My first time here and I love it! It has a steampunk feel. The food was just as good as expected and the service was above par (Tom was wonderful). Great beer selection! I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"First visit on a night out. And of course thanks to yelp, we stumbled upon this little gem! The ambience  was nice and relaxed. A pretty good place for a date night. I'm still fairly new to the area but passing through matthews and seeing this place is a pretty good look. The service was great, everyone seemed pleasant and helpful. Now on to the important part, typically I don't order chicken breast sandwiches at restaurants due to the lack of flavor or the chicken being dry. I ordered the chicken caprese with steak fries, this was neither of those. It was flavorful and juicy. To say, at first it did not come out hot  (which hot food is a necessity especially with fries)but explaining to the waitress she quickly rectified the situation and served me a fresh and hot plate. My friend ordered the cheeseburger and mashed potatoes. Needless to say, he ate the entire thing. Overall, I enjoyed my visit and will be visiting again soon."}
{"text":"The waiters suck! Have u waiting forever. The food is good but the service is not........ NEVER going back dont care how good the food is!"}
{"text":"I sent a message to Kristine and Frank yesterday requesting a table for 10 for dinner... A friend had an important birthday, our plans had been thwarted, and we needed a yummy and fun dinner location Code Red! 
Jekyll & Hyde came through in FINE form! We all enjoyed deliciously crafted drinks from the Gun Slinger to the London Eye, irresistible apps like the Irish nachos, and from the fish and chips to the salads and sides (y'all, try the Brussels sprouts, not kidding) there wasn't a crumb left on our plates... They brought cheesecake for the birthday girl, and we passed it around along with the peanut butter pie and their homemade bread pudding... What an indulgent meal!
Thanks again for such a great night out! Our waiter, Thomas, did an amazing job at educating us all on the highlights of the menu, AND kept our checks straight as we played musical chairs to chat with the birthday girl!! Thank you thank you!!"}
{"text":"Obviously this \"SJ\" character works here or is in some way affiliated with this place as he tries to slam my review and other establishment's in the area. Classy. Visit the place and post your views. We went to have a beer, and watch the games, simple as that. Our experince was not good.  This is what Yelp is for. So, continue your troll posts as you try to turn all of my negatives into positives just because you say so Mr SJ . Sorry to say I'll miss your next gig, as I won't return.  And yes, please tell Beantown and Kristophers that I sent them.  I get great drinks and great food and service there!"}
{"text":"We've always wanted to check this place out since we live in matthews and it looked really cool from the outside. Walking in, it didn't disappoint, really cool decor and relaxed atmosphere. We got a beer from their great tap selection and then ordered our entrees. I ordered the Shepard's Pie and my wife got the shrimp alfredo. The Pie was subpar, cooked with what looked like frozen peas and carrots, the meat didn't taste fresh either; I was highly disappointed. My wife's alfredo was excellent although the portion was on the smaller side, if you're really hungry I wouldn't recommend it. We'll definitely come back, but maybe just get a drink and an appetizer next time."}
{"text":"We decided to check out Jekyll & Hyde for dinner on a rainy Thursday evening.  The restaurant was busy with almost every table full, but we were seated immediately.  We were brought past the booths and tables to a high-top table by the windows, which was absolutely perfect because I like sitting up high and having a window view.  A small band (2 guys) were playing live music a couple of tables down from us.  It was pretty loud at first being so close, but we grew accustomed to it.  

The interior of the restaurant was pretty cool and modern.  It had a steampunk vibe to it.  

The menu is a good size.  There are a lot of varied offerings (apps, salads, sandwiches, entrees, steaks) without being overwhelming.  The menu items also have an English influence to them, while still being mostly American.  I ordered the jalapeno burger.  There are many unique sides to choose from that you don't find at other restaurants.  Besides the regulars (fries, baked potato, mashed potato, mixed veggie), there's also such fare as mushroom risotto, brussel sprouts, and mushy peas.  To balance the burger, I went with the garden salad, which turned out to be pretty big for a side salad.  The burger was awesome -- cooked just right, juicy, and flavorful.  Out the window, I could see Wayback Burgers down the street and thought how we once paid almost as much for average overpriced \"fast food\" burgers there as these delicious, fresh ones at Jekyll & Hyde.

The restaurant also had a better-than-most beer selection on tap.  I'm no beer connoisseur (light and/or fruity for me, please), but I like to venture out and try local beers from time to time.  This time was a Wicked Week Lunatic Blonde because...why not?  It was cold and refreshing, served in a Jekyll & Hyde branded pint glass.  

Service, food, and atmosphere was fantastic, so we'll be back, adding Jekyll & Hyde to our regular rotation of affordable, casual nearby restaurants."}
{"text":"Excellent beer list! We had lunch here and the tasty pretzels appetizer was awesome. The mustard sauce was delicious. The beer list is huge! I went for Legal remedy white chocolate stout which was unlike any stout I have tasted. It was a light color & light flavor and tasty. The burger is a steal for a lunch combo for $8. The lunch service was amazing & on point. We walked but the parking lot looked ample. The whole steampunk, victorian theme is cool!"}
{"text":"Great choices for beer and wine. Huge menu favoring the Irish side of the world. Fish and chips were awesome!"}
{"text":"Stopped by last night for dinner. Ordered the buffalo chicken nachos as an appetizer. They were okay. Nothing to brag about. My husband had the beer battered fried shrimp which was delicious. I ended up eating half of his because my order came out wrong. I ordered the filet flatbread with no mushrooms. Sure enough it came out with mushrooms. Sent it back and when it car back out it was missing not only the mushrooms but also the banana peppers. I asked the server for a side of them because I hated to send it back again. It was so soggy on the bottom it was literally dripping when I picked up a slice to eat. Needless to say I didn't eat it. We let our server know and nothing was done. Not sure if I would return or not. Not a great first time experience."}
{"text":"Quick and pro service. Waitresses wear traditional English corset too. Wings were big and tasty but the Shephard's pie was amazing. Using short ribs is brilliant. I fought hard but couldn't finish it- I even recommended to another person walking in. The bar in the back is also huge-crazy long draft list with mostly local beer and they are a craft cocktail bar they don't just make a drink they make all their own ingredients"}
{"text":"Food was really good, 50 beers on tap, good service, cool atmosphere and a father's day car show out back pretty cool.we will be back."}
{"text":"Awesome family owned restaurant with a unique atmosphere. It's a great spot for a date or dinner out with the family. 50 local craft beers on tap, full bar and great food."}
{"text":"Great spot, great service!  Wonderful atmosphere for Sunday afternoon to watch football. Pretzel appetizer is special & salad was big & very good. I'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"Had a great afternoon at J&H. Lauren was one of the best servers I've ever had.  She knew the menu and suggested some great ideas.   I'll be back to J&H and ask for Lauren."}
{"text":"Pros
-Irish nachos were good.
-Lots of beer options on menu
-Cool name
-We didn't have to wait long when we went.

Cons
-The plates were completely flat, like eating on a slick slab of wood.  They look cool but are not functional.  Food slides everywhere and if you're sitting outside, it goes through the holes in the table.  The waiter even dropped a small piece on me when he went to take our plates because it fell through the table.
-I like to order my burgers well done.  These were beyond well done.  They were completely burnt.  It was basically inedible.  I couldn't taste anything else that was on the burger.  
-The fries that came with it were basically frozen steak fries, like something I would throw in the oven at home.
-If you're thinking, \"Well I'll just get mashed potatoes instead of fries,\" think again.  My friend got the mashed potatoes with her well done burger (also inedible), and they were basically a baked potato that had been smashed.  She picked up one lump with her fork that was probably a couple inches in diameter."}
{"text":"I have visited twice in the last weeks for lunch and both times it was enjoyed by myself and guests!!!  The steak sandwich is open face and very tasty, they actually cook to your liking and get it exact. I had a side salad(which was huge) and blue cheese dressing that appeared to be house made. The potato soup is very rich and extremely thick, enough for two to share. The fish and chips rock, very light cod with great tasting batter. Our server Tom was very helpful and attentive throughout our meal. I would highly recommend the cocktails made by Pete behind the bar, he is an awesome mixologist. I will be back for sure and can't wait to have others try this place out."}
{"text":"The fish and chips were way too salty.  
The service was good once they noticed me.  Nice people, but can't go higher than two stars.  Had better fish and chips from frozen aisle of Safeway, frankly.   

By the way dear Management, you must do away with the lock boxes you put the bill and credit card in.  If this is some kind of twisted sobriety test, the humor was lost on me and I know I'm not the only one to be befuddled by this.  

One more thing. A respectable brew pub these days imo should have at least one double IPA or equivalently strong brew on tap.  When I inquired after such, I was informed I was not the first to be disappointed at the lack of this.  

Still and all, great potential in the quaint downtown.  Might try it again when next in town."}
{"text":"I have visited a couple of times and I am very pleased. The food has been great and the drinks have been frosty!! The bartenders have been good over all but need to be a little more attentive. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Jekyll and Hyde is really average and very inconsistent. Service is sometimes good sometimes inattentive. Food is sometimes good and sometimes bad. The brekkie burger can be great but I have also gotten it served to be raw. The fries were also cold once. Irish nachos are a treat and really good! Beer selection is pretty extensive. Bartender did not chill shots after being asked three times. They have a lot of potential just come up short."}
{"text":"My wife, daughter and I had a great time this evening. Plenty of draft beer and artisan mixed drinks. We had the Guinness onion soup and shepherds pie. Very tasty! We had Molly as our waitress and she was awesome!  My daughter wanted a dessert after our meal and was willing to use her check card for the first time after saving from her first job. Really says something about the menu when your teen is willing to spend their own money for what is on the menu and not your money. Thanks for a great evening."}
{"text":"First visit here tonight. Parking lot was full so parked next door which was not a big problem since was after office hours. The place was packed and people were waiting. We found two seats at the community table in the bar. Chris P. gave us menus almost immediately and our drink orders were taken. She was friendly and efficient, checking on us several times throughout our meal. Definitely enjoyed the atmosphere in the bar area. My dinner partner and I different entree. Mine was the Shrimp Thai salad and I was very pleased with my choice. It was very flavorful and the portion of jumbo shrimp was generous. I definitely would like to go back to check out the lunch fare."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! The waitresses and bar tenders are friendly and the food is awesome!! I recommend the Sheppards pie. It's fantastic !!"}
{"text":"I really want to like this place. It has a pretty cool vibe and it would be a great place to hangout if it didn't suck so much. 

This was my 3rd visit trying to find something (anything) that would make me want to come back. My first two visits were very mediocre, but my 3rd visit will be my last. Burned burger, skunky beer, subpar service, poorly managed, overpriced."}
{"text":"Service was really bad. I don't think I have ever been to a bar where I have had an empty glass in front of me for 15 minutes on 2 separate occasions. The bartenders were more interested in other things instead of waiting on their customers. We couldn't even get their attention to order more drinks. Nice beer selection with all the local breweries. Pretzel bites were good but burger & barbecue sandwich were dry & below average."}
{"text":"Had the BBQ flatbread, very tasty. Service was on point. Will be coming back in the future."}
{"text":"We live in Matthews. We have decided to try some different restaurants. So, this place has a very cool feel. Great interior, the staff was on point. My husband had the shepherds pie....which was very good, but as others stated it is small and expensive.  I had a Cobb salad, it looked good, however not great tasting. I can eat anything usually love it, the chicken on this salad was literally like chewing on rubber. It was not tasty rubbery either. Because it is a cool environment, I will try it again. But only one more time and then decide if it will be a regular for us. A bit pricey as well, dinner was around 70 with a few IPA's."}
{"text":"Wierd outfits for servers, weird music, steak on salad cold, burger ordered medium but came medium well, draft beer not cold, cocktails were not good.  I will be back when they have plates for the food.  Food flavor was good, but certain they could do better.  Because food tasted good they get the 3 stars."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to this restaurant. The first time the service and food were great; hence, I returned.   The second time was a disappointment.  It was a beautiful day and we chose to eat outside.  My husband discovered too late that his chair had ketchup on it.  When our food arrived my husband's hamburger was missing the very clearly ordered lettuce, tomato and onions.  I ordered the kale salad.  I had enjoyed the kale salad on my first visit and wanted it again.   There was one problem, the main ingredient was not kale.   A few kale leaves were sprinkled on top but that was it.   On my first visit the lettuce used was kale.  I did tell the server because I thought I had been given the wrong salad.  I was given a lame excuse that it depends who is working in the kitchen as to how the food is made.  I do not own a restaurant but I do know that if you have a kale salad, kale should be the main ingredient.   This was a much cheaper version of the salad I received on my first visit.  The server did bring out more kale.  Unfortunately, I will think twice about returning in the future."}
{"text":"Shepherd's Pie was amazing!!!  I highly recommend...the Irish Potato Soup is a must try as well.  Husband order the Ahi Tuna-said it was little outside his comfort zone and thought it was really good and would order it again.  Good beer selection, although they were out of NoDa's Jam Session when we visited-I'll chalk that up to the post-holiday visit...service staff was friendly, quick, and stopped by often to check in.  The bread pudding dessert was okay, I was more of a cinnamon roll than bread pudding.  Atmosphere was nice, the bathrooms were nicely decorated and themed (especially the soap dispenser) and clean.  Overall, very happy with our dining experience and will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"With my family decided to try Jekyll and Hyde since it is walking distance from our home. At first the hostess didn't know where to sit us at a table and finally sat down, it took 10 minutes for a waitress to appear. The waitress didn't seem to be wanting to work or even give us her name when introduced. 

The appetizer was order including what we were going to eat. Part of the appetizer the dough on the sausage was still raw and the sauce for the wings was not the correct one. I had order the sausage and mushroom flatbread by which on the menu states that has caramelizad onions on it, when it arrived it did not have none on it. My nephew order waffles and chicken, the piece of chicken wasn't even fully cooked and it was a larger piece. Chicken piece was sent back and spoke with Manager, another piece came back to us and it still the same way. 

It was a great disappointment on the whole experience, I can say for sure that won't be returning again."}
{"text":"Great meal tonight and Tom our waiter made the evening a special time. I had a perfect delicious steak and my wife had the salmon. Food was prepared perfect and had a really good flavor. This is one of my go to places. Will be back"}
{"text":"Awesome little place!! great food for a craft beer taphouse!! had the bbq flatbread and jalapeno burger! fantastic service!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, my husband and I love the burgers but the meals are great too (yummm chicken risotto!). 
We've been a few times. It's a casual and fun atmosphere. They have live performances like Irish Dancers and music. I'm kind of mixed about it because the dancers mixed around the room in the aisles and it was really neat and entertaining, but it was also pretty loud and hard to have a conversation at the table. So it just depends what kind of experience you're looking for. 
They have lots of seating inside and out but it fills up fast during peak hours. Decent draft and drink selection, too. 
The service has always been really friendly and attentive. It's a little pricy for casual food, but the food is really good quality and great flavored food."}
{"text":"Poor service. Mediocre, expensive food.  
Ordered the pretzel sticks as an appetizer which were fresh and delicious. 
Our entrees were slow to arrive.  The risotto chicken dish was nothing more than dry, overcooked rice (not made to order) with undercooked mushrooms, and overcooked dry chicken breast on the top. The dish had a strange sweet balsamic glaze all over the plate which didn't pair with the rest of the meal. 
The fish and chips, also ordered at our table were pretty good.  
The waiter never filled our glasses though the restaurant wasn't busy at all. 
We won't be back."}
{"text":"Kiley S. was exactly right, this place has a lot of potential but they missed the mark tonight.  Ribs had a great tangy Carolina BBQ sauce but were a bit too charred.  The truffle steak fries were also good but there was nothing \"truffle\" about them.  The BLT Wedge Salad was underdressed and hard to cut (not the best head of lettuce).  Our server Grayson was great and didn't hesitate to comp the salad."}
{"text":"Awesome place great drinks, fun staff, and good food. Definitely a must stop anytime in Charlotte. Stopped in while on a business trip and got to enjoy some of their abundant draft selection to include a few uncommon ciders. Fried pickles were great, and one of my ways to judge a new place. Passed my test with flying colors!"}
{"text":"Love this place, very good tasty food, been here twice already, however I believe the portion size of fries I always get are small, always have to order a second batch"}
{"text":"Great food and service especially when it's not busy. I think we have had everything on the menu at this point and we really have no complaints."}
{"text":"We have been to this restaurant twice and both times have had great service and great food. Our server tonight, Molly, was such a joy. Very prompt and made awesome dessert recommendations. The  chocolate cheesecake was decadent."}
{"text":"This is the new hot spot to be in Matthews. They absolutely need seats for people waiting on a table especially since the wait is upwards of an hour. I do not like the way they laid the restaurant out there are people trying to serve trays of food while people are squeezing by to get to their table.  The bar is way in the back of the restaurant and again very hard to get too and once you get there they have tables crammed up so close to it you barely have any room to stand and get a drink. It took us a good 10 minutes to  be able to order. Then to find a place to wait on your table again back through the cramped and crowded restaurant to the front where you can either stand in the door area or on the sidewalk not really ideal. After we got seated, we chose outside as it was a beautiful night our waiter came to take our drink order and ask if we wanted an appetizer we ordered the pretzel sticks with \"Warm Bavarian pretzel sticks sprinkled with sea salt served w/ house made mustard sauce\". He brought our drinks and took our order after about 20 minutes we still had not received our appetizer he came to tell us sorry the kitchen is really backed up and it would take longer than usual to get our food. The Pretzel arrived and they were Delicious the sauce they serve them with is amazing,  we eventually got our dinner, I had the beer battered chicken with Mac and cheese, which is not at all your normal mac and cheese it has more of an Alfredo sauce and bacon, it was luscious and the chicken was good as well. My niece had the black bean burger and salad and she said they were delectable. The manager came by everyone's table to check on things which was nice. Overall the restaurant layout is lacking, but the food is pretty darn tasty, but you may have to wait a while to get it."}
{"text":"We walked in and were immediately seated outside. Plenty of outdoor seating. Great atmosphere and great food!  Also a good beer and wine selection. Prices were slightly on the higher side but it was well with it. Staff was great. This may be our new regular spot."}
{"text":"Food was expensive and just ok. The vibe is kinda kitschy and strange. Think Victorian alleyway meets TGIFridays."}
{"text":"They brought out husband's fish and chips and my salad was 9 minutes later. This will be a cute hangout for drinks in the summer but the food and overall experience was kind of a rip off."}
{"text":"So party of 12 they cannot accommodate! Once you get your food, it actually tastes good, and the beer is good, but service baadddd! Maybe it was the large party but the kitchen could not keep up at all. So go if you are 3 or 4, but not if more....at least until the figure this piece out...."}
{"text":"Concept of the restaurant is super cool. Love the steampunk and two different sides of the restaurant makes It very unique. Topped with great food, lots of beer options, AND a bangin' Bloody Mary bar, I'm sold. Will return for Saturday night fun!"}
{"text":"I was honestly worried about visiting here after reading some of these reviews. I was pleasantly surprised by the excellent food and the awesome service. My only 2 gripes are, the hostesses are the first people you see and should be a first strong representative of the business.... we came around shift change and all 3 hostesses had resting bitch face, never smiled and never said \"hello\" or greeted us, they just snapped \"how many in your party\" It was a little discouraging. 
 Also the price....we had 4 beers (2 cheap beers each) we shared an entree and had a small appetizer and it was in total over $100 with tip...that to me is a little ridiculous! This is not what you would consider \"fine dining\" so why the expense?"}
{"text":"All I can say is: FISH n' CHIPS w/ MUSHY PEAS & BANGERS !!! Whoa. Like being in London. Not to mention the place is ALWAYS packed && the bar tenders are fun! The beer & alcohol selection are super awesome && drink specials are always attractive! Definitely a nice place to have a date and/or solid dinner after work!"}
{"text":"Growing up in Matthews we have seen many restaurants come and go. We always try to support local restaurants and this will be one we continue to support! From the amazing decor to the outstanding food we could not have been more pleased. Our server gave us amazing recommendations from start to finish. Tom ensured that everything from our cocktails to our dessert were what we expected and more. Not only would I recommend this gem in Matthews to friends I cannot encourage them to get there quick enough.  Amazing food and outstanding service!"}
{"text":"Interesting people watching... unfortunately it's the staff!  The super caddy bartender likes to make fun of his patrons behind their backs, watched a manager get super bent out of shape on some customers, and the waitstaff seems frustrated based on how often they're rolling their eyes at the nonsense going on around them. Given what kind of behavior is going on the the front if the house, I wonder what's going on in the back?!?! Management is a joke!


Oh look mgt responded. Too bad Frank, you were quite a jerk when our group voiced concern so it's pointless and insincere to come on here and apologize."}
{"text":"We have eaten here twice now. Good variety of food it's good service its good good ambience. My only criticism is the salad. It seems they use bagged lettuce instead of fresh lettuce. When they charge $15 for a salad I expect to have fresh lettuce."}
{"text":"Really poor experience --though our server was great the kitchen is clearly a mess. We had a large party and a third of our orders were wrong and 2 people didn't get their food at all (one because they had to send their still frozen fish back and it never got replaced). Then the manager apologizes but more he justifies it saying the kitchen is slammed and he offers a free dessert for the table. Turns out the dessert is still half frozen Sara Lee cake (don't think this was on the menu). 
I was understanding of a large party getting their food in waves but lots of cold food. Also for the price point , one in our party had a very small piece of salmon and a bit of mashed potatoes. 

Bottom line we won't be back due to a variety of issues."}
{"text":"This place is terrible !! The survice sucks and very rude . The food was nothing to brag about not to Metuchen that after I left I was still hungry . I had the pretzel stick witch whre very hard and not enough muster suace . There nachos whre very salty and the bugar I had was cold and not cooked how I wanted it to be it was well done . I will never be going back also they are so over priced"}
{"text":"Good food, good selection of beer, but best of all is the service. Thomas was so helpful with recommendations. Highly recommend a visit!"}
{"text":"My husband and I arrived at 5:50pm and were told we had a 40 minute wait.  The bar area was packed so we opted to hang out by the hostess station. The waitstaff  periodically stopped by the crowd standing there and took orders for bar drinks which was nice. When you watch the orders being delivered to the tables, the food looks amazing and has nice portion sizes. People just coming in are now being given a 2 hour wait time and the majority leave. As for us...1 1/2 hours later we were finally seated.  There was no apology or gratitude shown for us sticking it outAfter waiting so long we had lost our appetites. We ordered the pretzel sticks for an appetizer and received about a tablespoon of the cheese sauce to go with 4 pretzels, so we asked for more sauce.  Our waiter told us there'd be an extra charge. What??  Although he did bring an extra portion, we had finished the pretzels already and he said he'd remove the charge when he brought our bill. BTW those pretzels are fantastic!  Hot, buttery and delicious.  But that sauce is just a rumor of a dip. 
For my entree I ordered the Irish Farmers salad; not impressed.  It was a mixed lettuce base with chopped boiled egg, cucumber, bacon and seasoned potatoes.  The potatoes were basically cold home fries and the bacon was literally 2 whole slices of undercooked cold strips on top of the salad.  I also ordered a side of Brussels sprouts which were just okay.  They had been sautéed (think soft, not crispy) with onions and drizzled with balsamic glaze. My husband ordered a loaded potato and he didn't comment on it. He finished it, so it was apparently okay.  I realize it's a new place and they obviously have a few kinks to work out. The waitstaff is friendly and attentive, so we will try it again when the novelty wears off."}
{"text":"Had an awesome meal and excellent service there last night. Our server Tom was so friendly and thorough. He took great care of us on a really busy and hectic night. He was very knowledgeable about
the menu and shows a lot of professionalism. We had so much fun and really enjoyed the atmosphere. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed in the treatment received here... I can only hope they get better.  My neighbors and I were excited to hear about a new place coming to the neighborhood and planned a get together this evening.  In preparation we called early to reserve a table and were told that no reservations were taken.  Fair enough.... we showed up at 7pm to see several high tops available for our party of 7 but were told that there was a two hour wait... huh?! So we saw a group get up and asked if it was available and a server told us yes... as soon as we sit down, we are told to get up because the table is reserved.... so confusing! and again, I thought you didn't take reservations... I really try to be fair in reviews that I post and this one is necessary.  As a local resident who was excited to see a new business coming to the area, I would expect to be treated fairly.  This whole \"we don't take reservations but have several 'reserved' tables\" attitude and approach is just so unnecessary for Matthews.  I'm disappointed"}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever experienced !! Sat at bar way too long. Avoid at all cost.  Shame, menu looked promising."}
{"text":"They gave us bottom shelf tequila when top shelf was listed on the menu. Deceptive and not worth the price."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Don't be fooled by the the folks who use yelp as a way to make up for their crummy lives. This place has great food and awesome staff. This is NOT a sports bar, or drink till your drunk bar. This is a place you can have fun at and not have to worry about a drunk ass starting problems. Excellent Food, great drinks, and a courteous staff. Lauren and Kristine are always very attentive. If you want a classy place to unwind after work this is it. If you just wanna get drunk and watch sports try Beantown, and tell'em Marty G. sent ya."}
{"text":"We were looking forward to trying this new restaurant. 
Our group of 7 had mixed reviews. 
We started off with fried pickles. They were ok, except it is a puny portion compared to the price. 
The fish wasn't too bad, but I wish there had been a bigger portion. The waitress said the chips were fried and crispy, so I substituted a salad... It was basic. Finally, the mushy peas were nothing more than peas, a big disappointment compared to my dish when I was in London. 
A hamburger ordered medium was more like well done. Not juicy and flavorful. 
The half rack came smothered in a mustard based barbecue sauce.... No other sauce available. 
Beer selection was pretty good. 
Service was fine, but the computer software messed up the bills. 
Overall, smallish portions and  not particularly good.  Would I go back? No, there are many better choices in the area."}
{"text":"First time here - great atmosphere- but very loud - not good if wanting a quiet place for a conversation. Awesome beer selection.  Ran out of burgers at 8pm tonight so they are still have some work to get a seamless operation.  

I have hopes for it so will try again."}
{"text":"My girlfriend asked a question about the veggie burger and, instead of answering, waiter made fun of her for even asking, openly mocking her. I pushed back, repeating her question, and he started going after me. Unbelievable. Had a friend in from out of town that had already ordered, otherwise we would have just left... The actual food we got was decent. On food alone I would have given them 3 stars, maybe even 3 1/2 for some dishes, including a very good flatbread. Decent food doesn't make up for poor treatment though. Hoping this was just a bad server and not indicative of what Jekyll & Hyde is all about."}
{"text":"From the moment we arrived the service was excellent, friendly staff that knew the extensive menu and were eager to help you make your selections. This is a restaurant you could enjoy apps and cocktails or a full in entree. We had the Bavarian pretzels and Irish nachos to start both were DELICIOUS! Dinner was a mushroom angus steak burger for me and my sister had the most delicious authentic beer battered Fish and Chips .
When in Matthews stop by this gem of a new restaurant you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I had to put \"not sure\" for the questions because we were told there's a twenty minute wait since the \"kitchen is backed up\". This is a Saturday afternoon at 1:00 with a half-full restaurant. We left after sitting outside for 25 minutes.
Maybe the place is too new. Maybe we'll try again."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with this place! Great food, great beers on tap and some awesome mixed drinks!"}
{"text":"Things seem to have changed the last couple times we've been back. Starting from the hostess, the service and the food quality. Removing a couple stars."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place. Was so excited for Matthews to get a new restaurant. The decor is awesome. It's fresh, different and gives off a really cool vibe.  Their drink menu is fab. I tried a couple of their cocktails and they were super strong but definitely great. So here comes the not so good part. My husband and I ate there for dinner and it was a total disaster.

We ordered burgers and I had a side of onion rings and my husband a side of fries. I ordered the jalapeno burger. When my burger came out, no jalapenos on it. I thought maybe they were cooked into the burger. I had also asked for bacon on my burger but none in sight. I asked the waitress (who was awful) for the bacon and she never returned with it. My husband was eating his burger and immediately was pulling hair out of his mouth. A few short hairs were embedded in his burger. It was disgusting. We called the waitress over and her first response was \"I hope you're kidding\". He showed her the hairs. She takes our food and goes away and comes back telling us the manager will come out to see us. 15 minutes go by and no manager and no food. She comes back over to refill drinks and informs us the food is almost ready. I asked where the manager was and she said he was busy and would be over soon. Really? He should have been over as soon as it happened. She returned with new food and this time there was jalapenos on my burger but still no bacon. The manager came out and said he has no idea how hair would get in the burger as everyone wears hair nets. Ok whatever. He was apologetic and tried to put the blame on the fact that they had temps in the kitchen, but I don't buy it.  He comped us the meals which was nice and very much appreciated.

I will give this place the benefit of the doubt and go back and write another review. I want them to do well. We have been back a few times but only for drinks."}
{"text":"I had been here before and it was AMAZING! It was for my birthday actually, and the meal was delicious and incredibly filling. This past time I was disappointed. The service itself was great, Molly was an excellent server. The problem stemmed from the food itself. Although it tasted pretty good, the serving size was TERRIBLE. I finished my Shepard's Pie before my boyfriend even finished his fries from the Fish and Chips! $15 and it took me only a couple of bites to finish it- felt like such a waste for the price. The last time I had the Shepard's Pie it came in a different bowl and I was so full I couldn't even finish it! This time I felt like I was eating a kids meal sized version. I'm not sure why they changed the serving size but it made me feel like a real fool. Come starving, leave hungry."}
{"text":"Four of us went to the Jekyl & Hyde Taphouse for dinner tonight.  We started out with 2 appetizers, the pretzel sticks and the Irish nachos.  Both were tasty.  For our meals we had one sandwich and one soup, the Shepherd's pie and the bangers and mash which we shared.  Everything was very good.  Service was great."}
{"text":"This is our favorite place in all of Charlotte. It's the best thing to happen to Downtown Matthews. The food and drink are amazing. We have never, in the year we've been going, had a bad experience. 
The staff is always friendly and remembers everyone's name. Tried the nachos for the first time and I'm addicted. If you don't have a great time here, you are just trying to be miserable."}
{"text":"We had a great experience here tonight!
I loved the atmosphere, the way it was set up with the bar on one side, cool seating on the other and nice outdoor seating!
Our waiter Josh was on top of it tonight, smiling, helpful and checked on us the right amount of times and left us to enjoy our date night, the way it should be done! A+ on his job!
The food was delicious, so dang good!! 
First we got their pretzel & dip appetizer and let me tell you...These. Are. Ah-mazing. You don't want to miss out on these, order them!
My husband got the jalapeño burger with bacon mac & cheese. I got fish & chips(substituted the fries for mashed potatoes and so glad I did) it came with a small amount of their peas(they were wow good) and a sauce for the cod. 
Highly recommend and we will come back soon!"}
{"text":"We moved to the area about a month ago and really wanted to find the best places around town early and get adjusted to everything.  We went to J&H for a late brunch (served until 3 pm!) on a beautiful 78 degree February Sunday.  The theme inside is pretty cool.  Very steampunk and old-timey.  We chose to eat outside since it was such a great day.  Grayson was our waiter and he was very prompt and professional.  My wife had the waffle with a side of potatoes and a Blackberry Bramble to drink because as we know, brunch isn't brunch without vodka.  She enjoyed both food and drink very much.  I had the Brekkie Burger with mushroom risotto.  The burger was awesome.  It has candied bacon, Canadian bacon, provolone cheese and a fried egg on top.  The risotto was prepared as expected and the flavors were perfect.  The location is part of a great collection of spots in downtown Matthews and is about a mile from where we live.  We hope to be back often!"}
{"text":"Had the bbq pork flat bread. Delicious. Very thin bread with lots of toppings that go well together. Meat was a bit too tough but hopefully they get better in technique with that.  Wings were told to be great. Hot isn't that hot here. Would have rated the place 5 stars all the way, with its awesome outdoor seating...although they only played 80's Rock ...ehhh. But the killer of the mood award goes to the server.  Wow was she stone cold and acted as we bothered her wanting to order even a drink. No plates no silverware and no personality other than smug. We've been hearing a lot of people say the servers are rude and they don't go back so be aware."}
{"text":"Returned to have the  Irish nachos,  had them about a year ago.  The Irish nachos have now turned into  \"leprechaun nachos\" because they are half the size from a year ago!  The plate used to be piled high now we are down to just one level, but still delicious."}
{"text":"Started out well when I was able to make a reservation for a Saturday night at 7:45 PM that morning. Upon arrival business was good but not overly crowded. 

While waiting for my friend, I ordered a mixed drink. The drink was obviously weak and hard to accept at $7.00. After my friend arrived, I mentioned to the server that the drink was weak and the second drink was much better. 

Service was slow, and felt like our server was lethargic. Only dealt with him 2 times. Other staff brought drinks and food. My Salmon dish arrived without the Kale Salad. 

When several minutes later my salad arrived I couldn't believe how small the portion was. It was served in a small container made for serving condiments. Literally two small bites. 

The food was good but when looking at the price, service, and atmosphere I don't think it's currently a good value."}
{"text":"I ordered the dinner special, a pork chop with Brusel sprouts and mashed potatoes for $18. It was good, although small and slightly undercooked. My DH ordered a sirloin steak , it comes with a baked potato for $17. This was the most depressing steak dinner I've ever seen. It looked like something out of a a frozen dinner, the steak & baked potato were tiny it look like it was sized for a toddler and to top it off the waitress charged us extra for sour cream & chives. I may go back but just for beer."}
{"text":"Great Irish pub. Try the Irish nachos, they're delicious. Also, we tried the jalapeño burger and the fish n' chips and would recommend both. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Long wait for a table, too loud for conversation indoors. Food was uninspired, Felt and tasted very chain-like. My chicken wings were under cooked, the Caprese salad had tasteless, too firm tomatoes and the \"chef\" substituted baby spinach leaves for the fresh basil. Really? Caprese salad without fresh basil? The ambiance felt contrived/forced. Bustiers on the waitresses? kind of degrading in my opinion. Is this Wannabe Hooters? Tilted Kilt?
  I don't know, and I don't think they do, either."}
{"text":"Started with the pretzels and they were served hot with an amazing mustard cheese sauce.  Definitely start with this appetizer!  3 out of four of us got the ribs and they were fall off the bone good.  One other got the sirloin and it was cooked well and tasted delicious.  The only disappointment was the truffle fries...tasted like regular fries, not bad, just nothing special.  Overall, a great experience with great service!"}
{"text":"Parking - small lot but we found a spot quickly at 6:30pm. Cool looking establishment, tin ceilings & dropped lighting. Lots of outdoor seating. The waitresses wear corsets, men vested. Tables are close together & it's LOUD. The acoustics make it hard to hear. Music playing in the background, I did enjoy the Metallica selection of \"One\".

45 minute wait for table seating but we did arrive at height of dinner time. We went to the bar area. We ordered drinks & appetizers from the friendly bartender. He made a special drink for a gal with us who wanted something sweet, he called it a \"Crowd Pleaser\" she was happy. Tons of beer selections. We ordered Irish Nachos, Spinach & Artichoke Dip & Sweet Thai Chicken Wings. We were waiting to order dinner after we got our table. 

Bad omen was the 4 ladies next to us getting to the bottom of their Irish Nachos to find a black hair. They alerted their server (bartender) who apologized but no manager came by. They told us it was their first time too, sacrificial virgins I assume.

Irish Nachos were just dripping in cheese sauce, sopping - gross. The wings were good, sweet. The spinach and artichoke dip was laughable. A spoonful of dip placed in the middle of a tray of Nachos. We all thought it was a mistake, we asked for more spinach artichoke dip because we had 3000 nachos to go. They brought out a new platter again with just a scoop of dip. We sent it back. 

By the time our table was ready we didn't feel that we wanted to eat dinner. The menu wasn't all that enticing.

This is where I come to find out why the restaurant is so aptly named Jekyll & Hyde's. So we ask the bartender (Dr. Jekyll) if we can move ourselves to a booth to enjoy the desserts & He moved us over to an empty booth. Mr. Hyde comes over and says who sat you here!? I replied Dr. Jekyll did and if it's too much trouble we can cash out the bar tab and put our desserts on a new tab with you. Mr. Hyde curtly said that wasn't necessary, never came back to ask us if we wanted more drinks or anything else to order. He next appeared with the warm  bread pudding which had a side of vanilla ice cream. He put down four plates and walked away. I thought he was going to get the other desserts. So almost ten minutes goes by and the gals have shared the the bread pudding, saying it was yummy and still the other 3 desserts have yet to appear. It's 9:30pm, I'm tired and I want to eat and go home. I ask Mr. Hyde where the other desserts are and he mumbles they're coming, very rudely. He mumbled as he walked away so I loudly said, excuse me what did you say? He turned and said spoke to me like a twat \"I said they're being made and when they're ready I will bring them to you\". What??? I replied cancel our order, the girls protested, they wanted their desserts. He ran away quick, I wasn't sure if he was cancelling the desserts or bringing them. Another 10 minutes passed and now I'm just done. I go to the bar, ask Dr. Jekyll for our check and explain to him that we didn't get our other desserts. He was immediately apologetic and said omg wow you ordered those desserts ages ago, I will check on that and make it right. I said no thank you, we were ready to go. He came back to our table just as we saw the desserts coming to the pass. We asked for our checks, paid the tab and gladly gave him 25% gratuity. Leaving the restaurant the hostesses and our Mr. Hyde who was with the hostesses at the pass gave us the side eye and didn't even say goodnight.

Now tell me why me and my lady friends who are choose to patronize a restaurant should be made to feel like jerks when we leave? Why should any server be anything but humble and gracious. We can spend our money anywhere and we will! I don't take kindly to watching three other people share a dessert while all four of us wait for the rest of the food arrives. Don't be rude about it. 

I took a look at the Facebook reviews and I have to say that I am really put off by the passive aggressive snarky replys to customer reviews. Ask a manager!? Was there one, I'm not so sure about that. I will have to consult with Gabriel Utterson."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and the first Time was amazing. Steak was spot on!

The second time is for brunch and unfortunately had a less than stellar food experience. 
The wait staff (Amanda) is wonderful - first off. 
However, I ordered the seared tuna filet with double kale as a side. 
What I received was a bowl of sesame dressing with a side of kale and tuna. Instead of a filet of tuna, they topped the kale with bits of tuna.... which means the amount of tuna was  far less than what it would have been for the filet, hence the reason why I don't order salads anywhere. In the end, I just stopped eating because they just doused it all with sauce. 

On happy note- build your own Bloody Mary are amazing- So are the mimosas! A tad expensive though, I wish they were bottomless. 
Again, staff was amazing and gave water bowls to our pups. 

Amanda was very apologetic for my meal- so she tried to take ownership, which I appreciate greatly. She was a highlight of the meal since she was awesome to us and our pups."}
{"text":"My wife and I came in on a rainy early evening, we've got a pair of twins we wanted to get a few hours away from so we strolled into this joint eager to check out the ambiance and enjoy a good meal.  

When you walk in the door, the Victorian/Steam punk décor is really impressive.  The overhead lighting flickers and wall paper transport you to another world. The wait staff are dressed in period garb, men in dark trousers, grey shirts and suspenders, the women all dressed in bustiers.  You begin to feel that you in a Disney version of 19th century Londonpub, but then you sit your rear down in a cheap uncomfortable plastic seat, and your handed the stickiest flimsy menu and all that magic is sucked away.  You can see into the brightly lit kitchen and wonder to yourself, why, this was almost so magical, who needs to see the bright white sanitation of a kitchen in a 19th century Victorian odyssey.

Their drink menu is jam packed with deliciousness, but is poorly labeled.  For the typical Charlotte beer snob they have a wide variety of beers, but they don't give you the type or description and if you haven't memorized our 20 some odd beers and breweries you're up the creek.  Ask the waiter, he isn't really a beer guy, but he heard that the NODA is good.  Thanks pal.

Well, if you're looking for good food, strap yourself in because most of it was pretty mind-blowing.

My wife is addicted to fried pickles, so we ordered them.  I was disappointed, they gave you a tiny bit of ranch dressing, which I wanted to drown my pickle in because I wasn't thrilled with the pickles.

The sticky menu had one thing right they label their signature dishes, and with good cause.  I ordered the French Onion Soup, which with Trump being president, are we going to start saying Freedom Soup again?  The French Onion Soup must have made a mess when I took a sip and it blew my mind, because at that time a child started screaming for his life.  I am not sure why a 2 yr old is out at 6pm, olde boy needs to be home, getting a bath before hitting the pillow at 6:30.  You know what kids are out past 6:30, bad kids, kids who don't recycle, kids who don't act well in public.  Kids who's parents just want to enjoy their friends and relive their old life, but Dad has to take their screaming son outside and console him softly by the dumpster begging him to calm down so he can get back to his sandwich before it gets cold and that son of a gun, Todd eats all his fries.  The soup was delicious and unique, you could tell a lot of care goes into their food.  

My wife ordered the Spinach flatbred, which tasted like a flat piece of paper with artichoke dip on it.  I don't remember if there was a spinach and artichoke dip on the menu, if there was I bet its awesome, because outside that piece of paper, it was good.  My wife only ate half, while she chewed on resentment because she asked me if she should get the artichoke flatbread or the pulled pork bbq flatbread.  Guess which I chose.

So sticking with their signature item branding on the menu I choses the Shepard's Pie.  And like the Shepards at the nativity, I've seen the Lord.  It was hands down the best Shepard Pie, I have ever had.  And my Mom used to make Shepard's pie and she'll read this review.  Will she still love me, I bet she will.  It was just perfect, not slapped together and a scoop of Mashed taters tossed on it.  

Since it was my birthday, my wife suggested we get desert.  But since its my birthday, she let me choose, I really wanted her to choose, but you don't get your wishes on your birthday apparently.  I went with the signature, shocker right, Bread Pudding.  My wife never knew what bread pudding was, I am not sure she knew what to expect, but it was great.  

The food is equivalent to some of the best Irish Pub Food I've ever had, and I'll definitely be back.  I hope this place does well, reads this review and uses the cash they make to buy better menus and improve the furniture.  Also hide the kitchen in shame, it takes away from the time travelling voyage I want to be on for the only 2 hours away from my kids I'll get this month."}
{"text":"This spot won me over very quickly.  First of all they have a fantastic scenic layout and atmosphere.  The vibe is very different than most \"Matthews\" restaurants.  It's very hip and the wait staff dresses in a \"moulin rouge\" theme attire. 

The fare is mainly \"English Pub\" oriented, but it's a very diverse menu, if not in the mood for Fish and Chips or Sheppard's Pie.  

Personally the two items I've tried that I was very pleased with was:
1.  The Pork Flatbread: (All natural local pork tossed in Mississippi cattle bbq, candied onions, smoked cheddar topped with jalapeno ranch sauce and green onions.) Very tasty and light....very good for a small lunch.

2.  The Chicken Sandwich that is on their special lunch menu (They do a lunch menu with smaller portions and non regular menu items.

They have a good variety of draft beer and cocktails.  They have a separate bar in an indoor patio, which is perfect for a date or drinks/apps with friends.  

I haven't tried it yet, but they do serve Brunch on the Weekends from 11am-3pm. 

Give it a try!"}
{"text":"We had a great first experience at Jekyll & Hyde! Molly was very attentive without being over bearing. Everything she recommended was spot on delicious! And the chocolate cheesecake was wonderful! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Start with the hostess...completely lost and no idea how to do her job...then the waiter who took our drink orders forgot them and had to come back and ask...coke and water.  Husband ordered burger with fries and ranch dressing...came out no ranch and undercooked fries...i ordered shepards pie..came out no cheese and cold...waiter said, \"oh they are printing new menus soon, we have had a lot complaints about it lately because the kitchen changed it, would you like me to bring you some cheese\" no I want the kitchen to make it correctly, and like it says on the menu. I didnt eat it...waiter asked if I wanted a box for it...I said no I don't actually like it, it tastes like dirty potatos, and he caught a nasty attitude.  Ultimately he offered to take it off the check which I appreciate...but don't bother until they get it together. I gave 2 stars because I don't think there is no hope...they just need help!!!"}
{"text":"First time...decor and ambience was great...we sat at an outside table (which was very dirty), waited and waited...walked over to the hostess to let her know we are there and asked her if someone will be with us to take our food and drink orders. She coldly respoded \"yes\" thats it...waited for another 15 min...no one came to our table..the place was packed..servers saw us sit there and nothing. We just left. Not coming back."}
{"text":"You can't judge a book by its cover...that certainly applies here.  Walk in the place, looks great except for the health score (we ventured on regardless).  VERY slow on the initial service, follow up service was not any better.  Finally get tp order our drinks, ask for the NBA and NFL games in lieu of \"curling\" and womens college volleyball...3 request later we finally have NBA/NFL on TV.  The bar staff may want to spend less time with their significant other/friends/musicians and focus on \"paying\" customers.  Finally able to order/get our food, the flatbread pizza was good, as was the Caprese salad and French Onion soup.  Service level doesn't get any better,  decide to call it a night, get our check/pay and move on.  Next morning, review my bill and notice a $2 discrepancy vs the subtotal after adding each individual item.  After a couple of calls to the manager, turns out they were charging additional $2 on \"beer flights\" due to cost of premium beers....I've ordered a lot of flights and this is a first.  Bottom line, too many other places to go for drink/food in this part of town to go back."}
{"text":"Jekyll & Hyde is the happening new place in Matthews - though you might need to stretch your definition of Matthews a bit, depending on just where you are looking. Technically it is in Matthews, as Matthews does run along Independence for quite a ways, as well as up and down 51 - but most people miss this chunk of land that used to house nothing much at all, simply because there wasn't anything here. Now - just across the street anyway - you have a burger joint, pizza, sandwiches, just about anything you could want. And as a bonus, you aren't far from the hospital, if you gorge yourself too much.

The one thing this area did not have was something truly unique. You could go into downtown Matthews for a few better options, but for those who don't, it was go chain or go home. Jekyll & Hyde at least is something a bit different, and judging by the crowds, people like the option - it has been packed most every time we've gone by. Luckily we managed to peek in on a weekend afternoon when almost no one was there. Not sure if this was good or not, as even the staff was a bit slow moving.

If they are packed in the dining area, there is a bar (the taphouse?) around back where you can sit and drink, and perhaps even order food - but if you don't know it's there, you'll miss it entirely. There is no signage, and I'm pretty sure you have to walk through the dining room to get there. The theme is \"steampunk\" - presumably someone thinks this is a good idea, and it isn't bad, exactly, but it doesn't completely fit their menu either.

They have some Irish-like menu items, such as fish and chips, which might go with the Elizabethan theme. Then they also have buffalo chicken nachos (and Irish nachos, too), and Thai shrimp salad, and Caprese salad, along with risotto and pasta alfredo and pulled pork. A bit of a mix, all in all, which would probably fit better at an Applebees. The bangers and mash was actually pretty tasty - it just didn't fit in with the theme. 

If you should go to the web site, you'll see that Jekyll's kitchen serves the food, while Hyde's bar serves the craft beer, which is where you get the name - no mention of that while you're there, and the staff seems a bit disconnected from diners. Maybe their corsets were on too tight. It's also one of the loudest places I've ever been (when busy)."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place on Mondays! Love the vibe here! Tommy always has a smile on his face and so helpful with everything! Got the salmon and it was delightful!"}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night. Awesome atmosphere, great service and amazing cocktails! Keep up the great work!!"}
{"text":"Tried this since it's new and everyone was raving about it. \"Don't believe the hype\"! Maybe I've been watching too much Chef Ramsey, but the appetizer (spinach & artichoke dip) was straight out of the microwave, parts were cold, and other parts hotter than hades! Had the Shepherd's pie... BLAND... and probably came out of the microwave as well ... my wife's plate was pretty bland as well, the chicken risotto. The kids seemed to enjoy the chicken fingers and grilled cheese... but how could they go wrong with that really?!?! Anyways, it's a new place, constantly crowded (who knows why) but it won't be seeing us again. Maybe they should just stick to burgers and fries... I'm sure the rest of the menu is either as bland or overly salted to cover up the blandness! Almost forgot to add, it is LOUD IN HERE... good luck having a conversation without screaming!!!!"}
{"text":"We've now been here twice for late lunch/dinner in the past two months and both times it's been a great experience.  The service was friendly and very accomodating (the first time we were here we had a large party of 8), the beer selection is great (and you can get flights which is perfect for those of us that like to try a bunch of different beers but can't hang) and the food was really good.  The decor is little different too, it has a steampunk vibe, but not too outrageous that you couldn't take your parents here.  Food is consistently good.  Last time I was here I ordered the Jekyll burger cooked Medium-well.  It was cooked to perfection.  It was juicy and meaty, so good and the grilled brussel sprouts as a side were so good.  Definitely will be back.  I really want to try their brunch/breakfast menu next."}
{"text":"Got the Jalapeño Burger and it was dry and just pretty boring. Fries were solid. Decent beer selection. I'd give them a 3 star rating but they were playing Linkin Park, Nickelback, and Evanescence, so that's gotta bring them down."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night with another couple. Our food orders were cold and took almost an hour. Even the SOUP was cold and it only gets microwaved. The beer list was outdated and the first 3 beers requested were not available. The mixed drinks were inventive and tasty so we may go back just for cocktails but will definitely not eat there again."}
{"text":"I used to really like this place when it opened, but now that I've been there a few times, I'd have to say it's just ok.  First of all, if you eat inside, it's really noisy!  Hard to hear for normal conversation.  Food is just ok.  I had the fish and chips the other night.  It's looks like Mrs Paul's fish right of of the box...and for $16 I expect better.  We had the bread pudding for dessert and it was really dry, very disappointing.  Also, I have ordered the flatbread several times and it comes out differently each time, no consistency.  Service was not very good Friday either.  I ordered a tap beer of the menu and the waiter tells me they don't have it.  I'm thinking he means they are out, not he says they don't offer it.  I show him the menu and he says huh, maybe they do.  He doesn't check to see how the food is and the bill comes as just a total, no itemized bill.  I'm crossing it off my list as a regular place to go."}
{"text":"I came here when they first opened up, food prices and quality were fantastic. Over time they changed their menu and things started to go downhill. I gave it several more tries but it was just never the same. Burger was served to me raw one time. I ordered shepherds pie one night, when it came out it was cold and almost flavorless. Prices have climbed significantly, even just for the burgers. Unfortunately it seems quality has not followed. Service has always been amazing though so I have to give them credit for that. Beer selection is fantastic."}
{"text":"Gotta update my first review.

2nd time here....

I was excited to try the Shepherd's Pie.   If you consider getting it....think again.

I had to pull all the meat out of mine.   The steak was super fatty and gave the dish a super weird flavor.   I literally picked every steak piece out and set it to the side.   The mashed potatoes and the peas and carrots were OK.

While I love the decor inside.....the last 2 times Ive been....the food has just been so so.   I doubt I will come back simply because I dont think the food is that great."}
{"text":"Great food, nice atmosphere, friendly staff all around!  Lots of options for vegetarians, which makes this place even better!  A little cramped, but still nice date night joint!"}
{"text":"Headed here because I had to catch a soccer match on TV and kill some time before an event in Downtown Matthews. This spot is a good one and one that I'm going to recommend the next time I have a Matthews day/night out with my friends who live out in this direction. 

The actual building is great. So many new restaurants are cold and generic. This building separates the bar from the restaurant, which enhances the experience in both areas. The interior design is warm and welcoming, again rare for a new building. 

The beer selection is top-notch. It's great that Charlotte is moving in a direction where this is the norm. They do a great job mixing in local breweries with national and international selections.

The staff is professional and very attentive, even when it gets busy, like it did today. The manager was very attentive. 

This place is great and I'm definitely going to be back whenever I am in the Matthews area."}
{"text":"Delish and total do over! Have gone twice already. It is in the heart of Matthews quant downtown area on historic Trade Street. Such a variety on the menu; ton's of IPA's and local beers to choose from. 

Had the Guinness onion soup, Irish Nachos (crispy potatoes covered in nacho toppings), hamburger, and BLT  mac n' cheese. The variety of salads were great and a friend at my table had the chicken wings and loved them. 

Parking lot in back, casual dress, outdoor seating too, average prices, attentive staff."}
{"text":"Have been here twice now and service is outstanding.   Our server today never let our drinks get too low and they have glasses I would consider too small and causes them to run out fast, especially when you have Irish Nachos with Jalapeños!  A must try! 
The food is might give 4 stars, it was good, but not great and pricey, the five stars is definitely for the service.  Portion sizes were really good, we ordered desert but full enough to have to take it home for later.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place just opened up around the corner from my house! Being a foodie we ordered 3 courses ! We started off with the soft pretzels. They were amazing! I love soft pretzels and these were so fresh. My husband doesn't usually eat soft pretzels often but he seemed to love them!

Next we each got a different burger. Mine seem to be a little plain. Not enough flavor. My husband loved his and the mac and cheese. To me the Noodles in the Mac and cheese were a little over cooked, but being a new restaurant I'm sure they will get it on point! 

Lastly we had the bread pudding! It was huge. The ice cream was so delicious. The bread pudding could use more flavor though. The general manager came around and asked me my option about the bread pudding. He was telling me they feel like they needed to add more flavor as well. We discussed the idea of how to make it amazing, by adding raisins and caramel sauce. I can't wait to go back and try it when they have adjusted the recipe!!"}
{"text":"Brand new so there are going to be some kinks to work out but overall this place has lot of potential. There is a decent sized patio with tables that will be really nice when the weather improves. 

Four of us decided to give this place a try, went in around 6:30 on Sunday and had about a 10 minute wait. The waiter said they were slammed over the weekend so they were out of a few wines, no big deal. 

3 of us started out with the French Onion soup. It wasn't bad but not great either. Hardly any broth and it was served luke warm at best. 

One had a burger & fries which he said was really good. The bangers and mash were excellent. Two had salads which were pretty much just all lettuce and not much of anything else. 

Overall not bad for being open less than a week. I'm sure I'll be back and would recommend giving it a try."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere, the location is super convenient (for me), the service was great. We had the Irish Nachos and Shepard's Pie, they were both really good. Excellent draft beer selection."}
{"text":"Pros:
Cool atmosphere
No wait for seating 

Cons:
Slow service
Food did not come as ordered. My friend ordered a BBQ pork sandwich and it did not have BBQ sauce. I ordered an omelette and it was tiny - two bites worth!
The food came out all at different times. Her sandwich came and the fries came 10 minutes later. My omelette came and the toast arrived after I had finished eating and was cold. 

Would I go back? No."}
{"text":"Ugh...they tried. This was my 2nd time here (1st time was terrible). Our server was very nice (a nice change from last time), but my daughter's fries were dropping in grease & barely warm. Then two tries later & the cook still couldn't get my fillet to medium. The hub's \"brekkie burger\" was so dry that once the egg was gone it was pretty much inedible. This place has such potential! A cute name & theme, but EPIC FAIL when it comes to execution. We left wishing we had grabbed nachos from the food truck at Seaboard Taphouse. We won't be giving this a third try...I really wanted to like this place :("}
{"text":"Not only is the food superior, the staff is on point! Tom was our waiter and gave great suggestions on both the food and the amazing craft cocktails! I would recommend this to any burger aficionado and anyone familiar with steampunk and cosplay familiarities! A most stop for both date night and family fun! Yum Yum! Thanks again Tom!!!"}
{"text":"We went on Friday night (11/10) was not busy so no excuse for the bad service. Sat up at the bar top bc there was no host to offer us a table. Took more than 5 minutes to get greeted by any of the three bar tenders back there, the bar was not busy maybe three other couples? The manager was worse than the bartenders, she stood at the bar top the entire 30 minutes we were there on her phone complaining about how much she \"hated closing shifts on the weekend\". Took more than 10 minutes to get drinks, would have had another round but no one checked on us to see if we wanted one. We were not even offered food menus. We got fed up and asked for the check, had to ask for the check from three different people until someone finally got it to us.

Sadly we won't be returning. Maybe if your manager was less worried about planning a couples thanksgiving dinner at her house and more worried about her guest, we would of had a better experience."}
{"text":"Took my parents here a few weeks ago and was pleasantly surprised. I didn't even know it was there, but the food was really good. We did lunch special burgers and flatbreads and had zero complaints. Great selection of beer as well. I will definitely get back here. I took off one star because service was a little slow, but it was still a very good experience."}
{"text":"First time coming here, arrived 9pm Saturday night.  Atmosphere is neat, kinda steampunk meets Sherlock Holmes movie set.

Got the \"bangers and mash\" for $14.  Received a giant bowl containing a dab of mashed potatoes and gravy with 2 over cooked bratwurst-tasting sausages.  I'm not Irish, I've never had \"bangers and mash\", but....for $14 I was hoping it would somehow taste decidedly foreign.....better than boring sausages plopped on a small patch of mashed potatoes and gravy.  Nope.  I could replicate this at home for 1/2 the price and make it taste 10x better.  Meh.

My girlfriend got the shepherds pie.  It tasted okay, the meat was very tender.  Overall it could have had a bit more saltiness but it was decent.

I think this place is just overpriced comfort food with a novel atmosphere...but.....in Matthews at 9pm you cant be THAT picky.  I'd be willing to try this place one more time, possibly the fish and chips or a burger.

The waiter (Thomas) was cool, very personable.  A++ for him"}
{"text":"Must try the pretzel sticks with house made honey mustard sauce. Excellent Shepard pie with short rib meat! Burger with candy bacon too! We could pick our flights of beer samples."}
{"text":"We loved this restaurant! It was very theatrical and had great service! I would definitely recommend the Bavarian Pretzel Sticks and the Bangers and Mash. Also it had a wonderful beer selection with a number of unique and extraordinary drinks. Definitely a highlight of our trip to Matthews!"}
{"text":"Me and a friend went here however, we did not arrive until about 11:30PM not knowing it closed at 12:00AM. We were able to grab a quick drink. From the short visit we had you could tell that they must have a lot of regulars. Several people came up and talked to us at the bar which made us feel right at home. The service was quick and the bar tender was nice but not to nice so I guess average. But they again it was almost closing time so that might have been the issue. It was only about 10 to 15 people standing around as if they wasn't leaving until
It was actually closed and they all seem to know each other which is why I say seems like they have a lot of regulars. Not sure why they don't close at 2:00AM like most bars but whatever. Yes, I think I will come again another day when I have time to get the full experience. But from the little time spent here it was cool, cool atmosphere and cool people."}
{"text":"Fish and chips was recommended and was completely overcooked. Onion rings too, please adjust the fryer temperatures"}
{"text":"Went last night (Thursday) around 7pm with my friend for a few drinks. It was pretty slammed - especially in the main dining area. The place is very new, so everything was nice, clean, fresh looking. Very good lighting and ambiance. Welcoming. It was busy so it wasn't the easiest to navigate around people but no biggie. 

The bar area is pretty cool with seats at the bar, some smaller tables, and a few long, \"family-style\" tables as well. I like that. People really seemed to be enjoying themselves. I was hoping to sit outside because there is an awesome high-top table with a gas fire pit-thingy built in the middle that looked cool. But we bellied up to the bar instead. 

The bartenders were pretty slammed but were super friendly and we didn't have to wait long to get waited on. They have an entire wall of taps/draft beers and even have a TV (one of 7-8 huge, HD ones) always dedicated to showing updates menu options, even showing all the beers broken down by type! (LOVE that). We tried at least 5 different beers. We really hated one and the bartender didn't even quibble - just took it away and replaced it with a different one. Beautiful. That is how service should be. We also ate a little - I got the Pretzel sticks and cheese dip (YES - MUST try) and my friend sit the Steak Fries (very good and filled us up). 

Overall - I was very impressed and cannot wait to come back to eat a full meal in the main dining area."}
{"text":"Great experience and friendly staff. Food was great. Serving plates are a bit difficult to get off the table but other than that, great experience."}
{"text":"Very cool new tap house with a unique steam punk aesthetic. Super crowded but they seem to be managing. Nice mixed drink options and incredible desserts. Worth a visit or two for a night out."}
{"text":"This place has fantastic baby back ribs. I would give a five but they only have a mustard based bbq sauce. That's a problem as it's not my favorite but I will bring my own bottle of sweet baby rays next time :)"}
{"text":"Drinks are okay. Food is mediocre. Wait staff quality really depends on the day. Been a couple times and have never really been impressed, atmosphere might be okay for just drinks."}
{"text":"This is only place for my family and I to enjoy great food and atmosphere. The staff is professional, and extremely knowledgeable of both the beverage and food menus. A perfect restaurant to have your friends and coworkers meet you, just to relax and enjoy the atmosphere... Excellent"}
{"text":"Loved this place. We went on a Saturday afternoon and ordered a beer and a Bloody Mary. The Bloody Mary was awesome, served with a piece of candied bacon. We ordered the Shepard's pie and the chicken and waffles (from the brunch menu)--both were delicious. We cannot speak highly enough about the food, both entrees were fantastic and the portion size was huge. Our waiter, Tom, was great--very attentive and made great recommendations. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Olivia K gave the most impeccable service. 
She was attentive and incredibly friendly. I haven't ever had a server so sweet and genuine in my life. I've been a server for ten years and wanna be like Olivia when I grow up. She was perfect. Anyone who wants delicious chocolate cake and awesome drinks and service that will make you feel warm and fuzzy inside, come here. I can't rave about the service enough. That makes or brakes a place for me. This girl killed it."}
{"text":"Clean, neat, and cool! Love the steam punk accents. Food was yum! Beer selection was great. Recommend the Legal Remedy World Court White Chocolate Mocha Stout :)"}
{"text":"We had dinner here last night and were disappointed. We had been before right after they opened and the food was great. This time not so much... We started with the spinach and artichoke dip which tasted a lot like the frozen TGI Friday's appetizer you can buy at the grocery store. My husband ordered the brekkie burger and was brought out the black and blue burger. Our waitress didn't stop by our table for about 10 minutes after we got our food to check on it... by that point my husband decided to just eat it as we had our fussy 1 year old with us. I ordered the salad with dried cranberries and grilled chicken. It was super sweet, I thought it came with blue cheese on it but there was none... too bad, the cheese would have helped! The salad was pretty warm but other than being sweet it tasted good. Our daughter had the kids mac and cheese which was just plain old kraft mac and cheese. Her side was applesauce in a plastic cup that they just peeled the foil lid off of. Overall for the price we paid it just seemed like cheap and poorly executed food. Our waitress was nice and kept up with refills, but it was her job to make sure we got the right food. I don't think we'll be back. There are much better options in Matthews!"}
{"text":"the drinks were fair at best, service was fair but food is questionable.  we ordered the Guinness glazed salmon and the ribs. The ribs were fall off the bone tender and that mustard base BBQ sauce was POW! The salmon,  however failed miserably! The skin on mashed potatoes had absolutely no flavor and that piece of salmon was a tad bigger than a slider bun!! we chose to sit outside because the weather was great! now I'm guessing if you come here just for drinks & apps, this is cool spot. Don't get it twisted, this is not where you bring your wife for dinner. this is where you come to do sports nibble on apps and drink great beers and cocktails!"}
{"text":"My husband and I just had dinner here for the first time and were definitely underwhelmed. To start, there are definitely not enough unreserved parking spots for the restaurant. We had to park in a neighboring building lot and walk over. 

Our server, Saundra, was the only saving grace for this experience. My nachos came out cold and 6 minutes before my husband's burger arrived. Now the nachos were super cold - and missing two ingredients. The burger was cooked well instead of medium and was also missing the mayo listed in the menu. 

Although our server was hustling and trying to make the best of the kitchen's errors, she couldn't save our bad first impression. 

At no point did a manager stop by or did anyone else ask about our experience. We paid our bill in full for the pleasure of cold, incomplete meals."}
