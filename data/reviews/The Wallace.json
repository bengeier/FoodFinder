{"text":"Just returned from The Wallace Gastropub, it was...meh.  It could be SO much more though.  Cool look inside, definitely a pub feel.  Nice selection of beer. My wife had tough and greasy calamari though.  I had so-so venison chilli nachos.  Neither of which we would order again.   I asked for the jalapeños to be left off, they weren't.   The worst part for us was the lacklustre performance of our server.  She disappeared at the end of our meal, we both had our coats on waiting for her to get us our bill.  I'm pretty easy going but it was a bit much when she didn't come around for ten minutes. Not sure I'd return, not when there are way better options throughout the city."}
{"text":"This is a nice pub... Hidden gem in many ways. They have a great patio at the back. I have been here many times over the years the service is always great. Not so noisy or claustrophobic like lot of bars. They always show sports here and including a lot of  European sports and games. Have no idea why the pub goes down and resurrects in many different names and owners (?).   The drinks and the food are reasonably priced for a place like this. For me, this place way better than most fox and firkin type places."}
{"text":"First visit to Wallace. Staff outstanding. Food is a delight. Atmosphere is even better. Great place to hang out for all types! Sports events, a great place to watch and relax"}
{"text":"Nice pub, really. Friend had the Salmon dinner and really enjoyed it; I had a House Salad and the Vegetarian Flatbread. Both good!   But let's talk about the real reason I came: THE BEER. So nice to have a place in North York with decent craft beer options on tap! Black Oak Pale Ale, Side Launch Pale Ale, Beau's Lug Tread, Muskoka's Mad Tom, etc. Mondays are MICROBREW MONDAYS where all pints of Ontario craft are just $5!  Also on tap: Delerium Tremens! Houblon Chouffe! Have I mentioned this place has good beer?!  Washrooms downstairs were nice and clean -- believe they have a main floor washroom as well for anyone that can't do stairs.   Overall: most enjoyable. Look forward to returning."}
{"text":"Nice pub. Food was sub par. Overdone chicken in the wrap.  Thai mussels were dry and over salted. Missed the broth.  Beer list was good. Except they were out of most of them.   Friends ordered chicken wings which arrived at the table cold. Sloppy Joe was again dry.  For a gastropub they are missing the mark."}
{"text":"Cute place and fairly spacious. Went for dinner and the place was empty (I guess its usually busier later in the evening). I ordered the fish and chips - they were edible but not great -somewhat soggy and a smaller portion than I was expecting. The service was good and the beer selection was really good. Would return for drinks but not for food."}
{"text":"The name has changed but thankfully the beer selection is still quite diverse. I always thought people would confuse this place with a haunt downtown where people go to oggle. I asked the server whether that was the reason for them changing their name and it was confirmed. On to the main attraction on our previous visit the food was sub par so the main draw for us the excellent beer selection.  This chalkboard had quite a few gems on this visit. Unfortunately the St. Barnadus 12 was out of stock. Never mind I ordered a Sofie beer and my partner in crime had the last bottle of Chimay Blue (hard to find). They were both served in the proper glass.We closed with a Delirium Tremens which is an excellent beer as can only be had on tap in Ontario. Service was decent and despite a bit of a snafu in the billing I would say better than average service here.  The food menu looks the same as before so maybe on the next visit I will try something else as the burgers didn't fare well.  For beer selection I don't think this place has an equal in this neck of the woods.  3.5 Stars"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a drink. They've got a pretty good beer selection! A lot more spacious inside than you'd expect. A large bar with seating in the centre with areas around it with seating. All of the decor is that of an old school pub; everything is wooden. There's even a small patio out back. Service was good. The place was pretty busy and the food looked good. Wouldn't mind coming back for a bite!"}
{"text":"What an awesome, cool little pub! They had lots of space inside, but gave you vibe of a nice, cozy house.  Came here to celebrate a birthday with some drinks and eat a little bit of food. Ordered the Bison Burger, as well as the Fish Tacos and the Kettle Chips. Amazing burger with a good amount of ingredients inside. Amazing flavour as well! The Kettle Chips were also really good, with nice, large chips and an amazing sauce!  The beers here were great too, especially the Hopgoblin, which I was told is one of the only place in Toronto that serve it on tap!  A great little place to visit, and not always crazy busy and crowded like the bars and pubs downtown. Definitely worth visiting if you're in the Davisville area!"}
{"text":"This place is like a bad first date. I think this location is doomed to have utter failures, or at least terrible disappointments, of restaurants. This place looks exactly like the Tilted Kilt which was before it and the Bow and Arrow which was before it. They did nothing but take it over and make crappy food and hire shitty waitresses.  We went to this pub for my birthday. We seated ourselves, and ordered.  Here is what was wrong: The service was abysmal. The waitress must have been new to everything. She didn't tell us exactly what the specials were, she had no idea how to take a drink order, she did not deliver our drinks before our appetizers arrived, she took forever to bring us the bill.   The food. The appetizer, chicken wings, were actually good. Our mains, well, here is a big problem. I don't eat pork. The waitress did not say that the stuffed chicken that they had on special was wrapped in bacon, however she felt it very important to tell me twice that it had a white wine sauce.   I though that it tasted a bit off, but I thought that was because I went from the chicken wing flavour to a white wine flavour. Nope. It was off because it was something i never eat. I stopped eating, but since I had shared some with my partner (to see if he thought it was strange), too much was eaten for me to send it back. (Not that the waitress was anywhere to be seen). By the way, the white wine sauce was actually a thick cream white wine sauce that coated the entire piece of meat wrapped in pig, that covered the pig and made the whole thing just look like a regular piece of chicken with a few sauce lumps on it. I also asked for extra vegetables with this dish and no potatoes. They loaded on some par-cooked carrots and turnips, not really what I was looking for.    My partner got the steak and fries (it was menu - low grade stead and standard fries). The ketchup that was delivered to our table was unopened and still had the interior safety lid on it. We removed this one, and the one on the ketchup of the table next to us. The waitress had no idea how to get the protective cover off the ketchup (or that there was a protective cover on ketchup).  We did not order dessert because by this time I was so fed up with the service and the terrible food I just wanted to leave.   Whatever place takes this bar over with the Wallace fails will not get my business. I am so put off by this place. Don't waste your time or your money."}
{"text":"Found this place by accident when I met up with a friend for a coffee across the street.  Looked pretty neat from the outside so decided to grab a pint and a nibble.  Server was very friendly and helpful. We asked for something off the menu and she quickly went to the kitchen to check for availability.  So I'm kinda a nacho snob and gotta say, these were pretty good! Chips were fresh and crispy and beautiful layered with just the right amount of toppings. Server must have noticed that we were getting low on salsa and brought an extra container without having to ask for it. Impressive. She also offered to reheat the nachos about 3/4 of the way through eating them to get the cheese melty again which is something I've never had a server offer this. What a brilliant idea!  Based on my first visit, I would definately return and recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Happy hour is only Sunday to Thursday from 4 to 7pm.  Our group is down to 5 now from 10.  A few of us are just having vodka, soda and lime.  One whiskey connoisseur loves this place.  Usually we would sample the fine beers of the world but not tonight.  Nice place and a few TV screens lined the walls.  Our server Beatrice was great!"}
{"text":"Came here after a hike with a fairly big group. It's never easy to serve large groups (12 in my case), but a table was reserved for us at the back and we were seated quite quickly. There was a raptors game and it was quite packed. And it's actually a pretty big - bigger than most bars and restaurants in the area.   Once we were ready, our server took our orders (separate bills!! Yikes) and wrote our names down to make sure everything was correct. She answered our questions and recommended beers based on what some of us liked.   Food was good! For a gastropub, they had some good options. I got the fish and chips. It wasn't greasy, and very flavourful.   My favorite was probably the beer selection. They have some feature taps on the blackboard, which is always nice if you wanna try something new."}
{"text":"Came here for a friend's birthday on a Saturday night. Other than our group, it wasn't that busy.   The Wallace has a large selection of beer. Some from local craft brewers and others from all around the world. We were told to order Delirium and were vastly disappointed at the size of the beer for the cost (around $7 for less than half a pint). Other beers were a lot smaller in portion size than we thought as well. On their menu, they offer a sparkling white wine and it's stated that it's $9 for 200mL. Imagine my surprise when I was handed the smallest champagne flute imaginable. There was MAYBE 100mL in the glass. Small alcohol portions aside, we did order a few food items off the menu.   The fiancé ordered their Wallace burger with fries, I ordered their turkey burger with fries, and my friend ordered their mussels. My fiancé enjoyed his burger and it was a fair size served with cheese and bacon. However, they are pretty cheap with the fries. He got half a bowl of it. My turkey burger was very dry and I personally wasn't a fan of it. I got slightly more fries than my fiancé did. Both burgers were served on a potato bun and it was very hard to eat them because they had every intention of falling apart in our hands. My friend really seemed to enjoy her mussels. There was a good portion and it was served with toast.   Service was sub par. No quality checks were made and one of our friends didn't have cutlery. He had to go into the server station to get it himself. I asked for water a few times at the end of the night and it took three tries before I got a glass.   Originally a two star rating, but I respect restaurants that pride themselves in using local, high quality ingredients, as stated on their menu."}
{"text":"I came here with my older brother and younger sister for a reunion of sorts. I had never visited this pub before, but it was a convenient location for us. Upon walking in, I fell in love. I felt like I had been transported to the Emerald Isle. Whilst feeling dumbfounded, I realized I did not know the mores of the establishment and sort of awkwardly waited until a lovely and friendly bar-man, Peter, hooked me up and pointed me to the back patio which was really quaint and private.  The beer selection was awesome and the food was superb. I had a chicken madras dish; it was perfect.   I really appreciated the super-friendly staff and their willingness to entertain our off-colour brand of humour. Our server was really fun to engage with and she gave us perfect suggestions through out the night.  I will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Came here to meet a friend who works in the area.  It's a pretty big bar/restaurant with plenty of seating - tables and at the bar.  it has the décor of that classic old feel pub - dark wood,  large bar in the centre of the restaurant.   I ordered the calamari and it was actually pretty good. It was pretty empty around 1:30pm so probably the lunch hour rush left and of course the after work drinks crew hadn't arrived uet.    The service was really friendly and the beers are nice.  they let you sample them if you are trying to decide which one to drink.  Parking across the street in a lot, or street parking (if you can find it)."}
{"text":"Good beer selection. Meh food. Horrible service. I'd go back to watch a soccer game and have a beer, but I'd eat at home."}
{"text":"(Copied from The Tilted Kilt review as it was called Wallace Gastropub already when I went)  I came here for one of Andre D's urbanist meetups. The name for this place has been changed from Twisted Kilt to Wallace Gastropub.  The inside environment was quite decent, and the servers were overall good...that is if you can wave one down. Otherwise, you're in for a bit of a wait. I had a few instances where I had to wait a good ten minutes to wave down my waitress (if it was an Asian restaurant I'd wave down anyone, but since it's not...).  I ordered a bison burger with a Kronenbourg. The beer was quite good (in fact I really love the variety of alcohol in this place), but the burger was somewhat disappointing...the meat was extremely dry and mushy for my liking (I like the patty medium to medium well usually). I'll definitely try something else next time I come back here."}
{"text":"One of midtowns nicest pubs. Good fare. Get the burger, soup, one of the curry's or a meat pie. It's a pub yeah? Nice wings too. in terms of beer there's great selection, some nice rarities you may not find elsewhere. You can really enjoy yourself at a place like this and many do."}
{"text":"The place has changed a few times, so i really hope Wallace has success in this location. Service is great here and the beer selection is great."}
{"text":"A very English pub. Food was good, a bit pricey, but their burger was spot-on! hand-cut \"chips\" are perfect.   Staff are friendly and helpful.  Small but sufficient patio, and plenty of dining and space to hang out inside!"}
{"text":"Beer selection is greattt.. If you are a beer fan, no way you'd dislike this place.  Great spot to watch soccer games on weekends.. Decent breakfast and brunch.. Never had anything else but I'd return just for the breakfast and beer anytime."}
{"text":"I've walked by this pub a few times and finally stopped in for lunch. I was expecting a dark, maybe a little run down kind of place.  But, it was very bright, and well kept.  The U shaped bar was lined with beer from all over the world.  Nice selection you don't see everywhere. I ordered the buffalo chicken wrap, with fries.  The wrap was very good.  The chicken was tossed in a buffalo sauce that had just enough kick to let you know what you were eating.  The fries were...well fries and tasted good. I'll definitely be putting the Wallace into the Friday lunch/beer rotation!"}
{"text":"I've been here at least twice. Twice before its most recent incarnation.  I came here on Easter Sunday - decided to eat out for a change, instead of cooking dinner for myself. While the menu honestly does not inspire me to return, they do have an interesting and inebriating selection of beer and wine. In the end, I chose the rib steak dinner and a glass of red wine.  I chose roasted potatoes to accompany my medium rare steak. I appreciated the gravy coming on a side dish. I didn't even touch it. The meat was tender but.....bland."}
{"text":"We were here for brunch this weekend with the kids. It was completely empty when we got here around 10:15, but it slowly started to fill up as we were leaving.  The brunch menu was limited, but cooked well. Bonus points for the large servings of fruit on the side. My poached egg was cooked properly, runny, which is always appreciated. The price was right  I had a look at the beer list as well, which is good, and weighted towards Belgian ales. The decor is classic English pub with a nice central bar.  Over all, a perfectly average place for brunch. It doesn't stand out much but it was tasty and convenient. We will likely be back."}
{"text":"Fair size pub with nice atmostphere. I had the best thai mussels, there was a lot and sooo yummy. I will be back for those.  Ok 2nd time different sauce on mussels, still good! Piliterri Chardonnay went well with it.  I also tried the sticky toffee pudding, my fave dessert."}
