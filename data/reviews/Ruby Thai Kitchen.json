{"text":"I ended up at RTK during a run to the mall after work. I took at quick glance on Yelp for other reviews and found that Shannon C. gave it 2 stars.  Okay, maybe I will make this part of my run for that badge you get for going to places with 2 or less star reviews.  Really, though, after getting a sample of their mango chicken, I decided to go with that and some pineapple and shrimp fried rice. I have to say that my food was really cooked well and flavorful.  My chicken was light without being over breaded and I was given huge portions!  I ate leftovers for dinner the next night.

Ruby Thai is located in Carolina Place food court, so you may want to check it out during your next shopping visit in the neighborhood.  The service was very friendly, and surprisingly, they had mashed potatoes as an option among all of the various Asian fare.  I really had to ask about this, since I found it rather amusing.  Mashed potatoes, they assured me were added after several customer requests.  Have to say, listening to your customers is a plus in my book!"}
{"text":"I don't know anything about authentic thai food but overall had a good experience here. Food was great and employees were very friendly. 

I would recommend this place any day."}
{"text":"You guys should be ashamed of yourselves! The only Thai food on your station was the yellow curry. That I am not even sure because I didn't taste it.  Everything else you had was Chinese. The exact same foods being offered at the chinese place across the mall. I am from Thailand and was looking for pad thai and you guys had lo mein. Bourbon chicken and orange chicken is NOT Thai food. If I could give you no stars I would!"}
{"text":"In love with their mango and bourbon chicken! :)
The customer service is great and always fun!"}
{"text":"I agree with the service that I receive from this restaurant stand. The cooks don't understand English or misunderstand your food order. Other than that the food is not that bad."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: The food that isn't Thai, stinks. The lo mein is bland and chewy, the bourbon and general tso's chicken taste like fried chicken chunks doused in a syrup sauce.
The four stars are for the customer service and the pad thai. That pad thai is so good, so far it is the best pad thai I have eaten, although i have only had it from 2 different restaurants. But for the price ($7.00 for chicken pad thai) it is great! I pay around $10 at the restaurant by my house and it is no where near as tasty as Ruby Thai. The crab rangoon was not bad either.
The customer service is great, they are always very cheerful and happy to give you as many samples as you like!"}
{"text":"This isn't Thai food! It's chinese mall food. I should know, I'm Thai. I had Thai grilled chicken aka bourbon chicken with chinese lo mein. It's a joke."}
{"text":"Staff was very friendly , I went there for lunch, food was great, bourbon and mango chicken are my favorite.  Will definitely come back. and price are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Wonton soup is terrible. I don't know what I expected for mall food but yuck. Broth tasted gamey and the wontons themself just looked bad. Couldn't even bring myself to try one."}
{"text":"Sort of a bait n switch. Ordered SpicyBBQ Chicken w veg side. The portion seemed pretty large for the $4.99 advertised meal. I was charged $6.29. When I said I thought I ordered the one meat/one side for $4.99 she threw it to the side and put a few veggies and chicken in a small container and charged me $4.99. About 1/4 of the original meal! If even that much. 

Don't waste your money or your time. It was about a $3.00 meal. I felt totally ripped off! No customer service  she barely said a word and was only interested in my money. I should have refused the food and walked away."}
{"text":"Went here during a visit to Charlotte. Fried rice looked dry, so i ordered the pad thai noodles, bourbon chicken and chicken with vegetables. Burbon chicken had good flavor. The rest of the meal not so much. My son had wonton soup, he had to add several packets of soy sauce to give a any type of flavor. Staff was nice. Won't visit again."}
{"text":"For a food court eatery, Ruby Thai Kitchen at Great Northern Mall's food court (new) serves up an exceptionally nice Pad Thai.   This dish is made to order and comes piping hot with your selection of meat (chicken, steak, shrimp) or no meat.  The noodle was of the right texture and the sauce was not over powering.  I also had a Thai Iced Tea which was as usual - on the sweet side with dark Thai Tea and evaporated milk.  The people behind the counter had good customer service motto - taking your order with a smile and handing your order with a smile. 

I am comparing the exceptionality in the context of other such eateries in food courts.  And in such context,  I would give this place an A-OK."}
{"text":"$5.99 for a 2 meat combo.  We got the Bourbon Chicken (dark meat) and I think it was called Mango chicken(white meat) which is kind of like Orange Chicken.  We chose fried rice for the side.  It was all good considering it was a light lunch and my husband and I shared it.  More than enough food for both of us and it was pretty good too."}
{"text":"Ruby Thai Kitchen has become my go-to food court destination in Great Northern Mall, though I've learned to only order from the Pad Thai/Noodle Bar.  I usually go with the Seafood Noodle Soup.  There is a little bit of a wait, but the food is prepared right in front of you and served extremely hot.  I'm not saying it would beat any reasonable sit down establishment, but I'd be fairly confident putting anything on the Pad Thai/Noodle Bar menu up against anything else from the Great Northern Mall food court--and more definitely against the other Asian places: Sarku Japan, TJ Hibachi and Sushi Bar, and Stir Fry 88 (which I just learned, for whatever it's worth, is franchised from the same group as Ruby Thai--Innovated Restaurant Group)."}
{"text":"Had the Walnut shrimp, not very good as the sauce is way to thick and heavy.  The walnuts are not cooked and just sprinkled on top raw.  The chicken is the only thing that helps give it two stars.  The pad thai is bad even for fast food pad thai.  The lo mein noodles were ok.... their thai tea is over priced and I saw they were advertising it with boba(tapioca) this time so I was thinking cool.... Then they told me they didnt have any boba... so I told them to forget it...However there was so much confusion when I wanted the shimp as part of my combo I ended up with two boxes of food instead of one...for me and my wife... when we were only gonna share one.  Probably just go to Sakura of Japan or Charley's next time...."}
{"text":"The mango chicken and chicken pad thai were delicious. I was very happy with their service. I traveled from afar with my family and was craving some Thai food. I was happily surprised to find a great Thai place in a food court."}
{"text":"Veggies aren't even tasty (Thai noodles tasted like as it was cooked after pork) but the meat are good (according to my daughter as I'm a vegetarian). Fried rice are stale and tasteless. Filled the carryout box with Thai noodles, fried rice and veg in sauce, cost $7.  Not worth $, even at mall eatery area."}
{"text":"Ok, so there was nothing wrong with the customer service. They were really nice. But my \"pad thai\" was totally missing the best parts! No peanuts, cilantro, or lime juice! Just stir fried veggies and rice noodles doesn't make pad thai. For almost ten bucks, I was expecting a little better."}
