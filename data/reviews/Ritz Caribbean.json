{"text":"Reasonable and quick comfort food.  Sometime spice varies from mild to very hot.  Love the BBQ chicken and rice and peas with oxtail gravy."}
{"text":"Some pretty mixed reviews it seems... I must admit the prices aren't the cheapest ($13 tax in for a large jerk chicken plate), but you get a lot of food for your money. Also, other jerk chicken places are not cheap by any means.

I actually really like this place having been 4 or 5 times now. Their jerk chicken is quite good and their rice n peas is delicious. Coleslaw on the side adds a nice sweetness to the meal. I found the food to be pretty fresh on a Friday evening. And portion size is on point. 

Service was quick which is always appreciated. It's more of a takeout joint."}
{"text":"I've been here four times and each time I've tried to order a beef patty, but I was told, \"We don't have beef patties.\" Take it off your menu or make more if you're always out. The roti is okay but the service can be slow, especially for a take out place. I only come here if I don't have time to stop at Cool Runnings."}
{"text":"Over $15 for Oxtail??? And barely any rice and a complete attitude when I asked for my container to be full. NEVER going back. Prices are a gouge"}
{"text":"Haven't eaten here in years but I see there are quite a few locations now around the city now. This location is a decent size with lots of seating compared to some of the others I have seen. Very simple atmosphere--plain light green walls, a couple it light fixtures and some pictures of their food on the windows. 

To eat I got a small curry shrimp with rice and peas as my base and coleslaw as my complimentary side. It was about a 10 minute wait as they made the shrimp and veggies fresh. My food came piping hot which (if you read my other reviews) I love. I enjoyed my meal and thought it was very tasty without overdoing it with the spices. And FYI I small is pretty big portion. I couldn't even finish my meal in on sitting. I 

I'd come back as it's conveniently located in my area and the portion size for the price was decent."}
{"text":"Easily the best jerk chicken in the world but they got my order from Uber Eats wrong and didn't give me any coleslaw, which to me is like not giving me any jerk chicken since it is such a critical contrasting piece of the experience"}
{"text":"Very good  if have had the jerk chicken with rice and peas, as well as the chicken roti. I was told that will be getting a jerk chicken sandwich on a ciabatta bun"}
{"text":"The food is overpriced for the quality of meat and serving size. Chunks of bone in my curry chicken and I couldn't believe the amount of oil in my food. Got curry goat too. Same think with the oil. The flavor of both was just okay.  Definitely not going back."}
{"text":"Ive been here twice and both times I had the jerk chicken with rice and peas and coleslaw. It is delicious! I crave it all the time. With the large size they even put a little curry sauce on my rice. The lunch size is a great deal for 5.99 and perfect size for lunch. I need to try other menu items like the ox tail and curry chicken, I just crave the jerk chicken so badly  that I haven't ordered anything else"}
{"text":"Service is not bad , but the food is terrible.i got 2 large Fish dinners 1 snapper and the other king fish. These fish were poorly brown stewed. Also I got the Jamaican rum cake , it was extremely dry.. it was as if the cake has been out for a week.. I won't never eat there again as the food gets a zero rating .. oh may I add the rice and peas was also terrible. And also the coleslaw it was discussing it tasted like French vanilla.. the food over all is a -0."}
{"text":"I checked out this location on a Friday evening. I got fried chicken with rice, oxtail gravy, salad and a festival on the side. The food was decent for the most part. I won't be getting festival from this location again though. I found it very dry and probably the most disappointing festival I've ever had for fast food. I was very hungry and only had a bite of it before promptly disposing of it. It's  definitely not the best West Indian food I've ever had, but it's edible and I've come to learn what to expect from this chain. 

I would certainly recommend it if this place is close to you and open. The food is just okay. The service though, was excellent. They are fast and friendly, and the location was immaculate."}
