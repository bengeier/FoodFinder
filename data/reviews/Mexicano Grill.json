{"text":"I've tried to order from this restaurant twice through Just-Eat.ca  The first time they were closed but had not informed Just-Eat.ca. The second time we placed an order they said they were 'too busy' and cancelled our order.  Fuck you Mexicano Grill. Fuck you."}
{"text":"Great food, hot service, and authentic atmosphere. Not fancy, but full of flavor, and big portions!"}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican food.  Awesome tacos and burritos and very nice staff.  Definitely worth a try."}
