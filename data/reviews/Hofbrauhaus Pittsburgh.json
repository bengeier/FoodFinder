{"text":"Fun atmosphere. Good food. Big beers.  I would suggest the appetizer sampler (the works). As many below me will agree, the sauerkraut balls are delicious. The bier cheese & pretzels were good too.  I had the Bayerischer Schweinsbraten (pork with sauerkraut and a potato dumpling). It was different than I expected as I'm not too familiar with German food, but still pretty good. The pork was cooked well and had a good sauce. I wish I had substituted mashed potatoes instead of the dumpling."}
{"text":"Fun!  Great energy!    Its all about the beer people.....don't go looking for healthy food.  But you will find a good time and good beer....and its LOUD and jolly, so be prepared!  I was dining with Mom, so we opted for seating in the private dining room.  Big wooden tables, lots of great natural light from big windows.  We were offered seating on the patio too, which would have been really nice too.  We checked out the big hall when we were leaving and saw that there was live music and the entire room was alive and buzzing.  Looks like it would be great fun for a large group for a great night of drinking!"}
{"text":"I am from Cleveland and went to this place because I enjoy great beer and food. We went for late lunch and had an excellent experience. German beer hall atmosphere is true to form with a guy on the accordion and dressed up beer wenches.   Food was phenomenal, beer was authentic german stuff from the Dunkel to the Hefewizen. We did not see the sampler on the menu but when one went by we ordered it.  We had the giant pretzel and the 3 dips bier cheese, ozabel (sp) and sweet mustard were the best (great lakes brew in CLE has slightly diff Ozabel).  My wife had a pan seared pork chop with burgandy mushroom sauce perfectly tender. The sauteed cabbage was spot on. I had the pork loaf which was like a hot dog flattened and grilled. great flavor. Views of the river were great and we even did the german drinking cheer that was made made very popular on the man show."}
{"text":"My first experience at this restaurant was hard to describe. We sat down in the great German hall and had high expectations since the atmosphere seemed so communal and unique.      It didn't take long for the tides to turn on the 'seat yourself,' 'cafeteria style' seating as a server never seemed to appear to take an order. We may have been less apt to judge had a server granted even a simple drink order. But we sat to wait for at least twenty minutes. On the brink of trying the Irish place across the street, we were finally greeted by an apologetic hostess.     When the food and beer finally arrived (wursts on a bun and a liter, for me) we thoroughly enjoyed the cuisine. After the orders were taken there was hardly a wait for the food to arrive. The bill followed suit. The food was wonderful for the portions and quality.  I would probably try this place again on a week night, as we ate in on a Saturday.  It might be less crowded and more enjoyable."}
{"text":"Visiting from Oregon and decided to see what Pittsburgh had to offer for breweries. This place was great!! The service was great! The view was great! I could go on.......... It was kind of slow when we were there so we got to take it all in. The size of the hall was impressive then we went outside and the was huge also. It would be fun to see it full. We did have some beer cheese fondue with pretzels. Very good and filling."}
{"text":"Excellent service, great food, and of course great German beer hall atmosphere.  This place is even better when their beer garden is open because it gives you a quieter option if you don't want to be in the hall.  Monthly beers, to me, are a hit or miss, but they are nice about bringing you another beer of your choice if you don't like it.  Everyone should do a shotski.  I don't care how corny it is but it's so much fun.  Wursts are good.  Also had the Southside Sampler, which was OK.  The cheeseballs were too salty for my liking.  The potato pancakes were great.  OMG I don't know what they're called, but the french fries with cheese and bacon and some sort of green herb were delicious and not heavy.  Highly recommended.  Also highly recommend the streusels.  This place is very crowded during weekends.  I would recommend coming here on weekdays or getting here early."}
{"text":"We arrived shortly after 8, to a line.  We waited, and when we checked in with the hostess, we gave our cell number and were told it would be a 30 minute wait.  An hour and 15 minutes later, we were still waiting.  I went in and asked again how long it would be, and a second hostess said that the kitchen backed up, and that they just started seating again, and it would be another 20 minutes.   I wish someone had told us from the outset that they weren't seating, and that the estimated wait was over 90 minutes. We would have went elsewhere instead of waiting around.  Or, since they did have our cell number, someone could have sent a text explaining the situation.   Needless to say, we never did try the food because we didn't want to wait any longer just to be seated....from the complaints of others that we could over hear, food was taking a long time as well.  If the kitchen can't handle the volume of orders coming back, perhaps they shouldn't seat so many at one time.  I understand that things happen, but you have to be up front with customers, and not let people wait way longer than they are expecting to with no explanation.  Seems like it would be a good place, but this situation left a sour taste in my mouth, and I doubt we will return."}
{"text":"Do you like great beer at a reasonable price and in large quantities ? Do you like awesome German food and atmosphere?  Do you like pretzels that are soo big and delicious it hurts your very soul to see it disappear right before your eyes? IF SOO! Come and get it"}
{"text":"Good authentic German food.  Authentic German beer.  Don't go here for a \"hop bomb\" - the beer the waitress described as \"hoppy\" did not have any detectable hop flavor (at least to this hop head).  The atmosphere is loud - I hope you like accordions!  Great restaurant, just don't go thinking you're going to have conversation with your dining companions."}
{"text":"As far as beer garden type places go, this place is pretty standard.  They've got plenty of beer and lots of hearty german fare.  The only reason I'm not giving 4 stars is because I feel like there's nothing that screams AMAZING!!    I feel like you mainly come here for the ample seating and lively atmosphere.  The pretzels we had were pretty good, but again, nothing amazing."}
{"text":"We love going Saturday and seeing the Bavarian Brats! Always try to grab a table up front, it's just not the same at the bar or at a booth in the front room. Just squeeze your way in if you want to have a fun night. Thursday night is college night and I hear the specials are great (half off beer.)  I recommend a stein of any beer, they're all good, especially the hefeweizen and any seasonal specials, and the appetizer sample plate, which has a ton of snacks to share for cheap. I'm always surprised at how cheap you can spend an entire night here."}
{"text":"Great service and sooo much food! Had a really good time here. Save room for all the food you will be served!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a quiet, romantic dinner by candlelight - well, this . . . this ain't it.  But if you're looking for scrumptious German food (bratwurst, bierwurst, currywurst, pretzels, etc.) and classic German beer in a beer hall setting with accordion music, staff in lederhosen, dancing, and lots of happy patrons you will be crazily happy!  Throw in the sizeable outdoor biergarten and a lively, picturesque river scene - and this is a really nice slice of nice!"}
{"text":"Good food, beer land music. As authentic as you're going to get in the U.S. I recommend keeping it simple. Get a beer and some pretzels and call it a day. Maybe a side of sauerkraut too."}
{"text":"This place is huge.   It's a little overwhelming when you enter the place but the food quality and beer easily makes one feel comfortable and at ease."}
{"text":"I have lived in Pittsburgh for nine years and have always loved coming to the Hofbrauhaus, so now that my boyfriend and I are moving away, we decided to host my birthday party/ our going away party outside in the beer garden by the river. For the most part, we had a lovely time, enjoyed a nice atmosphere with good food and drink and decent service and it was the right venue for hosting all the friends we've made over the last 9 years.  But I feel compelled to add that the end of the evening was unpleasant. I should preface this by saying that my boyfriend and I and most of the friends who were there with us met or currently work in food service and are respectful and understanding of business hours and closing procedures at other establishments. We knew ahead of time that the place closed at 1am, and we had every intention of being ready to go at 1am. But starting at midnight, the wait staff started taking drinks away left and right, rabidly clearing our tables if we dared to look away or visit an adjacent table. Then at 12:30, I was told I had missed last call and I couldn't get another drink. Fine -- I didn't need one anyway, but keep in mind my last one had been taken by an overzealous busser while I was hugging someone goodbye.  At 12:45, we were reminded that we had 10 minutes left to finish our drinks. \"Great, thanks!\" we said, planning to comply. At 12:50, a wall of security guards more or less stood around us, and they brought a police officer over to cross his arms and pretty much just scowl and stare intimidatingly at us as we tried to say our last goodbyes to good friends, which, to say the very least, put a damper on the festivities. I got the sense they were looking for any excuse to kick us out.  If you advertise your hours as being 11:00 am - 1:00 am on a Thursday night, then I think it's only fair to allow your customers to enjoy themselves until the announced closing time. Don't strong arm your customers into leaving before then. We weren't being drunk jerks, we weren't trying to order a lot of food or shots or anything, we were just trying to finish our drinks and say our goodbyes, but the waitstaff and security team just surrounded us with death stares for the last 20 minutes of the night. Had it been 1:15, I'd have completely understood and would have rounded up any oblivious revelers as quickly as possible as part of a cooperative and sympathetic effort, but that was not the case.  If not for that, I'd have given them a 5-star rating, but \"last\" impressions matter, too."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is certainly festive and everyone I went with said the beer was good (esp at that price). I am pregnant and can't drink so I can't comment. Ordered the Jaegerschnitzel- breaded cutlet \"with a bacon, mushroom, and red wine sauce\". The sauce was bland and there was no sign of the bacon, wine, or mushrooms. The cutlet was so overcooked the meat was gray. Ordered a side of mashed potatoes- bland and institutional tasting. I really enjoyed the German potato salad- not sure how authentic it is though! Definitely not the best German food in PGH and there are better (albeit chain) options if you're restricted to the SouthSide Works."}
{"text":"The bar staff here is top notch. Especially Liz! She is a true pro, provided excellent service even under a high demand situation.  Highly recommend the place just based off service alone. The Dunkel is a fantastically balanced and satisfyingly malty brew, grab one. You're welcome."}
{"text":"My friends bachelorette party: we told them we had a party of 10, they sat at us at a table for 8, the waitress told us we could pull up chairs. The manager told us we had to move tables halfway through our meal. My friend had a verified state id, they did not accept it and did not let her drink, the nachos were good, but my salad was drowned in dressing, the waitress never asked me what dressing i wanted.  The waitress forgot to enter my friends food. I fond he short blond haired manager in her 40's offstandish and  very unhelpful! Really bad! They didnt even give her a discount even though they forgot her food. Also this is a college bar where all the students loudly stand up in their chairs and start chanting the taylor swift song by the band! Really annoying and you cant hear anyone in your party!"}
{"text":"I have spent years in Germany. There's nothing like good German food and this is nothing like good German food. Go for the beer and the building but eat someplace else. The beer hall is attractive and authentically replicated. The outdoor seating is superb and has some of the best waterfront views in Pittsburgh. The food is a disappointing : everything seems to be breaded and deep fried and bland tasting. Even the German potato salad was lackluster. They might be better off cutting back on the number of menu offerings and significantly improving the quality of the food. Otherwise I suggest forget about eating here and just order beer and maybe a German pretzel or two."}
{"text":"The food was very good . The service was good too. I couldn't believe how cheap the beer was.  My boyfriend and i had some sort of German chilly fries which was really good.  We also had the giant pretzel.  So good."}
{"text":"I threw an engagement party for my best friends in one of the private rooms at the Hofbrauhaus.  Kelley Williams helped to assist in planning the function and was amazingly easy to work with, quick and super professional.  She made sure that on the day-of, everything was exactly what we discussed.  The buffet menu looked and tasted fabulous!  The servers who were assigned to wait on my guests were very gracious, fun and made the evening go very smoothly.  I don't have one negative thing to say about my experience hosting a party here.  Kelley and her staff made it the perfect experience and I would definitely have another party at this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Very good restaurant with good food and beer, but it is ruined by awful wait staff. Service is very rude"}
{"text":"Went here on a recommendation from a friend. Couldnt have been happier.  All the beer was top notch. All the food was very good, Kinda hard to mess up a hotdog or a brat but they definently couldnt have made it any better. Some what of a gourmet hot dog! LOL. Service was very good as well. Thank you ROB(Bartender)!  Me and my girlfriend loved it and will definently be back!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in the Pittsburgh area I've been here numerous times.  The draft beer is always good but don't except a ton of choices to be on tap all at once.  Don't listen to the negative reviews by the annoying foodies and hipsters.  I mean seriously are they ever happy?  They build a place in Pittsburgh that does not revolve around sports and TV's yet they still complain.  The menu has all sorts of things on it and I love the German potato salad and the red apple kraut.   The place can get really busy and loud though so if you're the type of person that is turned off by that I recommend trying to go when it is more low key.  In the warmer months there is outdoor seating that is used but in the colder months everyone is inside."}
{"text":"I wish, I wish, I wish we had one of these in St. Louis.  First, apparently this is actually a replica version of the actually Hofbrauhaus that they have in Germany (so my friend who actually went said). So. Pretty cool on that front. Thankfully, there aren't drains in the floor of this one like there are for the one in Germany...  They're a German beer hall so so course you have to get the beer steins. They're pretty big. Each stein is probably about 2.5 cans of beer.   The food is decent. The pretzels with cheese are actually really good. Get them. I also got a plate of spatzle with chicken breast, and like everything else here, the plate was huge. I finished it all but I don't know how I did it and I kind of wished I hadn't. Later, we got the ski shots, which are basically just 4 shots on a ski and you have to drink it all at the same time.  The atmosphere in the beer hall: you either love it or hate it. It's rowdy. It's loud. There's people standing on benches. (Surprise revelation of the night: Sweet Home Alabama is apparently a popular song in Pittsburgh.) They do have a great beer garden outside for when the weather is nice and you just want to get it away from all the ruckus inside.  For dessert, we had the apfel strudel and the chocolate layer cake. I really liked the chocolate layer cake though it was at the point in the night when I probably could have cared less what was for dessert."}
{"text":"I've only been here once, but I honestly wouldn't recommend it. The wait for a table was long, the place was packed and noisy, and the atmosphere was just annoying (loud drunk people chanting 'USA', god knows why because it's not an American-themed bar).   I ordered a beer and some food, which was chicken and potatoes. Everything seemed really overpriced. When it came out, it was pretty bland and boring, except for the excitement of finding a large lump of plastic in my mashed potatoes. I alerted the wait staff who told me that the potatoes come in bags that are sliced open, and some of the cut-up plastic must have gotten into the meal. The staff were super friendly and replaced it, but it was still a bit of a let-down.  Maybe it would be nicer to go in at lunch time and have a beer and a pretzel or something. For dinner though, I definitely won't be going back."}
{"text":"This place is really great! The food was excellent, the waitress was very nice, and the atmosphere was pretty cool. There was even a man playing the accordion as the entertainment. He would take song requests for tip money! I wished he would've played my song request \"Schnitzelbank\". I want my $2 tip back. That's ok, my family and I still enjoyed the visit anyway. This is a fun place to eat!"}
{"text":"Live music, fast and polite service, delicious food. I went with Hofbrauhaus Wurstlplatte (grilled bierwurst, bratwurst and frankfurter with mashed potatoes and sauerkraut). Very fresh, cooked to perfection. Also, I went with a sampler of their draft beers. I did like their premium lager but other beers seemed flat to me."}
{"text":"The few times I've been, I have not been impressed. The service has been slow, orders gotten wrong, and the food just isn't that great. I'm not a big beer drinker, but the people I know who are like the selection. It is fun to have polka-esque live music. I would be fine eating home-made German food and not going back to Hofbrauhaus."}
{"text":"Strictly from a tourist's perspective, I think Hofbrauhaus is excellent. I can see how for locals, it might get on your nerves a bit, but as an out-of-towner, this place hit the spot.   We went there twice (embarrassing?) - the first time on a weekend night. The outdoor seating in the back was perfect for drinks and pretzels/beer cheese. We were there for a few hours, and it was relatively uncrowded (although it's huge, so there were probably a lot of people there). People really do stand on benches and sing along with the band in the inside area, but if you are looking to spend time in a place where you can hear yourself talk, the beer garden was perfect.   We went back the next day for lunch, mostly because we loved the beer (the Oktoberfest is delicious) and we wanted to sit outside with a view of the river.  The food was heavy, probably not ideal for a hot summer day, but the rest of the experience was great.   The whole thing is a little kitschy, what with the \"authentic\" (?) Bavarian outfits donned by the serving staff and the accordion player strolling around the joint. And there was a significant influx of college age club-hoppers getting their night started. Also be prepared to get ID'd at every corner regardless of your age. But honestly, none of those factors affected our experience at all - we even bought a souvenir Hofbrauhaus mug to take home."}
{"text":"Can't say enough about how much I enjoyed the beer. The good was food but the portions were actually a little too big (one portion would have been enough for my wife and I). This is a better place for large group or family than a quiet date night, but it's fun."}
{"text":"Love this place - no matter the weather!  I have been here in summer and sat outside with a good view, and in winter and stayed inside and admired the authentic beer hall style.  They offer seating outside in their enclosed porch with a muted view of the river.  It was plenty warm enough!  The beer I tried, a season wheat, was excellent.  So far, every meal I've had was delicious. Recently, I had their dessert, and that was fantastic!  The chocolate cake was rich, moist, and something I wanted to live in lol!"}
{"text":"Such a fun place! The sauerbraten, pretzels and potato pancakes were delicious. I had the lager, which was a good beer. The entertainment was really fun, especially after 9 when everyone was standing on the benches and singing along with Steve Grkman. Go with a group of friends, this place is super fun! Recommend to anyone looking for a casual, but energetic experience."}
{"text":"Although only 4 year round beers and 1 rotating tap, beer is solid and cheap (less than 6 bucks for a half liter, less than 10 for a liter).  The pretzels are delicious, and the potato soup is awesome.  I would only go when weather is good enough for outdoor seating because it is on the river and has a great view, also because inside is too rowdy with a lot of drunk assholes in the beer hall.  It gets so bad on weekends that police officers wait outside for any issues that arise in the beer hall."}
{"text":"What is not to love?   Excellent food, excellent service, entertaining music!  Sing loud with your beer in the air, stay late and dance on a table.  Celebrate with a \"shot\"-ski.  Great time every time I have gone.  Only con is it's pricey.   We love this place!"}
{"text":"I am not a big fan of the original HBH in Munich, but the HbH in Pittsburgh is quite authentic. It can be very loud in the main hall, just like Munich, the food is OK, just like Munich, it is a good place to drink a lot of beer, and it is a wild time.  However, the HbH Pittsburgh gets high mark for having a wonderful beer garden patio, a heated terrace, and a private and quiet dining hall."}
{"text":"+ delicious Bavarian fare and brews, + nice patio with a scenic view, - packed and noisy inside  If you are looking for a typical Bavarian Oktoberfest experience the Pittsburgh Hofbrauhaus branch gets very close. Despite the TV screens showing sport events the interior reminds of the original Hofbrauhaus in Munich.  Similar to the interior the menu is Bavarian and convinces with delicious brews and traditional Bavarian and Southern German fare, some of them with an American twist. Make sure you try the battered and fried Sauerkraut balls and the Hofbrau Dunkel beer!   Besides German Oktoberfest Classics the live bands are playing popular American songs to which the crowd starts dancing after their first \"mass\" (a liter of beer).  If you prefer a less busy atmosphere the outside patio with scenic views over Monongahela River is a great alternative during a nice summer evening.  Average price for an entrée: $15, price for a \"mass\" (1 liter of beer): $12.  + nice location + scenic view from the large patio + good Bavarian fare and beer - noisy and packed indoors"}
{"text":"Food was good, waitress was attentive, but nothing noteworthy.  For a slow Sunday night, we sat in the \"quiet\" hall that faces the road.  When the room is large and currently seating only 4 other parties, its furstrating to sit so close to others when the rest of the room (out of ear shot) is going to waste.  They definitely need to adjust the thermostat.. A 40ish degree night in Pittsburgh dictates furnace usage, not expecting patrons to sit and enjoy their meal whole wearing their coats."}
{"text":"Possibly, my favorite bar in America!  Excellent Hofbrau Beers, solid food, great setting, especially the Beer Garden on a nice day.  This is a beer hall....so if that's your thing, you will love it here.  Great beer cheese pretzels, and the German food is very good."}
{"text":"Great beer, great Schweinshaxe. Absolutely the place to celebrate Oktoberfest."}
{"text":"Meh.  I've experienced better.    I'm amazed by the size of this place.  Indoor hall, outdoor beer garden, inside, outside, upstairs, downstairs, lots of chairs, everywherez!  We've come here several times for big get togethers, and I think that's the best upside.  They can easily accomodate large parties, and the waitstaff does a pretty good job in keeping up.  The food itself, though, is just bleh.  I guess I'm just not into German cuisine.  I mean if Heidi Klum is the pinnacle of German beauty then Hofbrahaus is like the Janeane Garafolo of Deutschland dinners.  Then again, they do have a great selection of beer, and Germans know beer.  So put down a few of their pints, and Janeane Garafolo may just magically transform into Heidi Klum! #beergoggles"}
{"text":"Great food. The pretzels, red cabbage and bierwurst are fantastic!"}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere and yummy beer. We took our three young kids who really enjoyed the love music (yodeling!) , soft pretzels and bier cheese . My husband and i also both adored our meals. I wish I could remember what they were. He had a sausage sampler. I had the fried pork with ham and bier cheese. Yuuuuuuuuuuuuum!! We're from out of town but wish we could come here all of the time!!!"}
{"text":"A great atmosphere for a drink and German food. If you're visiting the Pittsburgh area you should check it out."}
{"text":"Great beer and authentic German fare.  A very good option for big groups - they can handle it.  Generally busy.  Not the place to go for vegetarian options, although they might have one or two.  It is very nice for kids."}
{"text":"Yum!  Good german food Friendly service Beer brewed on site Clean bathrooms  What more could you dream for  My husband would eat there every day if he could  Gluten friendly menu.  It is a menu of avoidance not replacement.  It lists things that naturally have no gluten rather then gluten free products shaped in.  Sorry no GF beer but they have other drinks.  Load but quite out side on the terrace.  It is heated but drafty so bring a sweater if you want sit out there."}
{"text":"The food was excellent.  The entertainment played our two favorite German songs back to back.  The manager opened up the gift shop for us to buy souviniers even though it was closed. Would definately go there again."}
{"text":"Good beer but average service. Warm pretzels and cheese makes a good appetizer.  We went there for lunch on Sunday, party of five: 1. Reuben Sandwich- Good, lots of meat of course 2. Grilled Chicken Sandwich- Yummy, good amount of chicken and fries were fresh and crispy 3. Baby Spinach Salad- Not so good, some of the ingredients such as caramelized onions were missing 4. Chicken Ceaser Salad- OK 5. Southside Chicken- Satisfying and vegetables were good.  Worth trying, if you like good German beer."}
{"text":"Disappointing. Come here if you like extremely crowded and loud places, mediocre, heavy food, and staff that only care about their next table. This place has forgetten what it means to respect each customer's business, even those trying to enjoy a family visit - since it doesn't have to."}
{"text":"Food is delicious, atmosphere is fun, and staff is friendly. Great place to go for a good time. I had the schnitzel - it was out of this world! Definitely try the beer cheese and pretzels as an app, but skip the fried pickles.. Also, make sure you.sit in the room with the performers."}
{"text":"On a bike trip with my family, we thought to stop and grab some beer and fried stuff before the trip back. We ordered, and my 30 year old brother, his 29 year old wife and I (25 years) were asked for identification. My parents were with us and were not carded. We told them we were biking so we didn't have our wallets, and told them our ages, and our dad confirmed we are adults. The waiter wasn't having it. My dad said, \"okay cool we'll just get liters then\" and the waiter took the order without comment. My parents shared their liters with us, and the manager came out and said \"though I can see that you are old as you say, I'm afraid we cannot serve you alcohol and have to ask that you not drink any.\" So much for an authentic German experience.  Also the food's gross."}
{"text":"The Hofbrauhaus is the ultimate experience around Pittsburgh if your into German style food. The food is great and the atmosphere is unmatchable."}
{"text":"Loved the Beer Fries. Slightly pricey. Super friendly service. The atmosphere is very welcoming, making it very suitable for family or dates."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great location with beautiful view of the river. Great beer and a lot of choices on food. It can get crowded so be prepared for a 30-min wait. Service is wonderful and they offer to text you when the table is ready.   Nice place to go for country music lover. I went on a Saturday night and some bands played country music. People all stand on the chairs to sing and dance. Great atmosphere. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This is must when visiting Pittsburgh. Come on Saturday. Live music, dancing girls, and beer!!!"}
{"text":"I don't know if it was the timing or what, but we had a great experience here. I got the Schweineshaxe (a favorite German food of mine) and it was absolutely amazing. Even people walking by our table to theirs asked what it was so they could order it. Fantastic.  Of course the beers were good too, and the view on the deck made for great atmosphere. The waitress had no problem with our taking time to eat our meal and have a few beers, and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves."}
{"text":"I have been there several times and I love this place. The German food is excellent and the Dunkel beer is awesome. The biergarten is a great place to hang out and have a drink right next to the river. I highly recommend the Hofbrauhaus."}
{"text":"I was in town visiting my fiancee's old stomping grounds, and we stumbled on this place.  I got the Sauerbraten and I'm still unsure if I liked it. It was like nothing I'd had before so was unique in that way. Just not sure if I like German food or not. I think I liked it. My fiancee and her father had some other dishes which they were quite pleased with, but the joy was the music. We were there on a Saturday night and there was an accordion band in the front singing their hearts out. They even sang Sweet Caroline, which being a Boston native I had to sing along with. and yet, there was a room full of Pittsburghers singing along! It was a blast.  They also had a special where if you ordered a liter of beer, you got to keep the mug, so I'll always have a memento of Hofbrauhaus in the form of an enormous mug."}
{"text":"Love this place!  It has the best food!!! the beer is very good!  Such a fun time, would reccomend going on a weekend night, the music is best then and so are the people :)  However I go anytime during the week, becuase I love the food and beer :)"}
{"text":"Awesome German food! The atmosphere actually felt like a Bavarian beer hall, and the entire experience was great. The location on the river is also great, and it was wonderful to sit outside to eat."}
{"text":"The potato pancakes were great, the sausage was good, the beers were ok. I thought it was a bit pricey for the food offered. The interior was very good though."}
{"text":"I'm settling on three stars, because the experience really was pretty fun.  The place is a cavernous vault with soaring ceilings that reflect the loud, raucous vibe, the German music, and the clank of beer steins on tables.  Pretty cool.  I am  not above enjoying a kitschy appeal to every German stereotype, and I'm definitely not above the beer choices.  I think I might have just had the bad luck to go there when the waitress I got was having a bad day, because her negativity was so pronounced that I whispered to my dinner companion, \"Did I do something offensive?  Why does she hate me?\"  Hard not to have a bit of a pall settle over the experience when you're wondering if your server is spitting in your food for reasons you can't figure out.  Everyone else was great, though, so maybe that was just an anomaly.  The hostess was super cheerful, the musical entertainment was outrageous and fantastic, and it's basically a great place to go to if you're in the mood for a loud, cheerful time.  The one other challenge I experienced is that there's no nearby parking, so having someone with limited mobility in the party is tricky."}
{"text":"This review is just for my meal...nothing else. I admit I am not a fan of this place to go hang out.  Maybe if I was younger and lived close....but it's way to loud for me. I don't want to yell over the oompah band  the entire time I'm trying to hang with friends.  I'd find the music tolerable if I was drinking heavily. But people come here for the atmosphere knowing what they are getting into...so Im not going to rate this place based on my dislike for something that is at the heart of the business. So with all this being said...I had a good meal last week.  Had a gift certificate there and needed to wait out traffic. I got lucky coming in early in the evening because it wasn't the full band....considerably more quiet.  I ordered the Sauerbraten....really flavorful.  If you don't like traditional sauerkraut, this dish comes with red apple kraut.  Awesome.  My BF had the pork with crackling.  This dish is insane.  Wish I had taken a photo of it.  If you love pork and the fried pork skin....heaven.  For me it was a bit too much work to get the right amount of pork and the right amount of cracklin in each bite to make it nicely flavored. But if you have the time while drinking your huge liter of beer....then go for it."}
{"text":"Do not go to the bier Garten on a sunny Sunday of a holiday weekend. Service took literally hours and some items never arrived yet showed up on the bill. Go to the bar to order anything if the bier Garten is busy, and plan to be there for a long while. That said, if was lovely to be on the river on a sunny afternoon."}
{"text":"We automatically got the \"chain/franchise\" vibe when we walked in because it felt like a weird Disneyworld version of Germany, but it didn't matter because the food was spectacular."}
{"text":"First time at Hofbrauhaus and we will be back.  Delicious food, great service, very clean and accordion music.  What can be better.  We really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about this place. I lived in Pittsburgh all my life and up until recently I discovered this gem! It is fun, plain and simple. The band is great and it makes your dining in experience seem like so much more than just dinner. Their beer is phenomenal and food is great as well. I got \"the works\" burger and I recommend it to anyone looking for a different kind of burger.   A little pricey, yes but I highly recommend to anyone looking for a different experience in the burgh!"}
{"text":"Hofbrauhaus Pretzels And Bier Cheese / Soft Dough Pretzels + Bier Cheese Spatzle + June - Leichtes Weizen = two thumbs up! I've been here twice. FYI: loud audible music if you sit inside - in the main area (if you're into that) though pretty nice outdoor seating."}
{"text":"I visited the restaurant on a Sunday evening.   There was no line to get in but the place was full!  We we seated immediately in the covered outdoor area.   It was comfortable, quiet and had a gret view of the river!  Service was prompt and friendly (thanks Lucy!)  We got beer explanations and recoommendations and enjoyed the very short wait for the food.   I am a breaded pork cutlet  fan so i ardered the weinerschnitzel.   Wow....I was huge, hot, and delicious with not a drop of grease!  The sauce went well with the meat too!   I could have this dish over and over again!  Good food, nice surrounds, and good service AND you don't haveto be part of the boisterous party if you don't want too!"}
{"text":"Ah, a bit of Deutschland here in USA. Beer is good (duh), food it depends on what you order. I was born in Germany and raised off schnitzels and wursts so I may be overcritical on some of their items, but the weiss wurst and sauerbraten are pretty good. What makes this place a great hang out for me is the biergarten .... 1. Awesome view 2. Lots of seats 3. Bathrooms close (lots of beer = lots of trips) 3. I can smoke cigars 4. great scenery.   Inside is load with music and people dancing. Always amusing to watch and take in the atmosphere. I plan on spending time here for the World Cup for sure."}
{"text":"Lots of good-tasting light beer options for those like me with a hops-averse tongue.  Overall the food is okay (bland schnitzels), but anything potato is delicious (potato pancake, German potatoes, fries, etc.).  Great atmosphere, despite the cheesy traditional German pub garb, and the views of the river on the deck are a nice reprieve from the high energy (read: noisy) inside.  I get the sense that the night life would be pretty fun at this establishment."}
{"text":"Absolutely awesome!!!!  Can't say enough positive. Service!!!! Food!!!!  Location!!!!  Love sitting on the river."}
{"text":"Go here with a group of friends because it's a party place. The food is great, German bier garden fare. Limited number of selections on tap, but I guess that is on point for a German bier garden. Did I mention drunk ladies dancing on the table to the house band playing Journey songs?"}
{"text":"We came here as a group of eight on a Saturday night. Our waiter was very friendly and the food was very good. I ordered the schnitzel sampler. This place was very crowded and very festive. People were standing on the benches and singing with their beers as per the theme of the venue.  While this is not exactly my scene, I still have to give this place a thumbs up in terms of atmosphere, vibe, service, and food quality. If you are someone who likes a festive drinking partying atmosphere, then you will no doubt love this place."}
{"text":"Food is god entertainment is exceptional and prices are reasonable.  If you are staying in the area it is a must stop,especially if you are a beer drinker as they brew their own right there."}
{"text":"BE THERE EARLY!!! They serve limited amount of pork shank everyday. Be sure to get there around 5p to taste some! Like the beer, and love the idea of beer sample."}
{"text":"Great German beer, okay German food at reasonable prices in a humongous beer hall/restaurant/patio/bier garden. Live polka music every night in the beer hall which does get very noisy! The restaurant, patio and beer garden aren't as noisy. My favorite spot is the patio at night. The lighting that they use reminds me of an amusement park and you can easily have a conversation. Been here many times and the service has always been great. My only knock on this place is the food. I love German food but I wish they would put in as much tender love-n-care into their food as they do their beer."}
{"text":"On the last night of a trip, I usually tend to go to a place that I know will have good beer.  I have been to the original Hofbrauhaus in Munich.... so it was a no-brainer that I would end up here at some point during my trip to Pittsburgh.   It was a nice night, and the sun was just about set on a nice summer day.  A seat out in the Biergarten was an easy decision.  It was nice to see the old Oktoberfest tables set out with a nice river view.   To start off, we shared the pretzels and bier kasse.  Think about that.  Okay, you got it.  It was pretty much what you think it would be.  Definitely recommend.  I ordered the schweinebraten and my wife ordered the nurnberger sausages.  Unfortunately, they were out of the schweinebraten and I went with an order of the nurnberger sausages as well.  To drink, I had their seasonal Pilsner, and my wife had the hefeweizen.  Later on, I got a dunkel as well.  Everything came on in a timely manner, and tasted pretty much like what we have enjoyed in Deutschland.  The beer, as you would expect, was right on. After dinner, we split the appel strudel, which was very good.  The restaurant was in a great location.  It was right by a riverwalk, which came in handy as we tried to walk off the great meal we just had.  So.... where's the fifth star?  The party next to us asked for mustard and was given Guldens mustard.  While that wouldn't raise an eyebrow anywhere else, this is a German place and you have to get the mustard right.  It would be akin to putting ketchup on someone's noodles at an Italian restaurant.  But all in all, it was very faithful to the original Hofbrauhaus.  Definitely try to stop by here if you have a chance.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great service. Great food (try the apple strudel) and the beer is excellent!  I try to bring everyone I know here now just so I have an excuse to come.  A real German beer garden experience."}
{"text":"It is loud, the food is meh, the beer selection is surprisingly limited.  The only saving grace is its riverfront location and the views that that affords (when you are lucky enough not to be seated in the beer hall).  If you want great German food, and I mean really great, go to Max's on the Northside in what was Pittsburgh's Germantown."}
{"text":"Great installation of the Hoffbrau. Reminded me of Munich with good good, beer and a great view of the river."}
{"text":"I was there for the pork shank but unfortunately I'm told they didn't do it that day (or it was sold out, I don't remember). So I ordered a half chicken with cabbage and potato on the side. The portion is HUGE. I couldn't finish. Even though I was able to eat what I wanted but I enjoyed the chicken as well as the friendly and relaxing ambience. Good place for meeting group of friends."}
{"text":"Pretty loud and the food is good but not quite great although I guess the main reason one would come here is for some authentic German beer which this place delivers to perfection.  Fun, but not a place I would go out of my way to visit every time I am here."}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday night at one of the most packed times.  It's definitely an experience on Saturday's.  They have live music and there is a real camaraderie feel between you and your table mates.  It's always the first stop on our Saturday trip up and down the South Side."}
{"text":"There's not too much mystery as to what the Hofbrauhaus is at this point: huge, rambunctious beer hall with German and Not-German-At-All food offerings.  So I'll just offer a couple of thoughts to optimize your 'Haus experience:   1. Outdoor seating is great on warm days/nights.  So what if the Mon River is often sludge brown?  I still get mad at how criminally undeveloped Pittsburgh's riverfront is.  This is one of precious few spots to actually hang out by the water and I'm a fan.   2. The Weizen is legitimately great.  For beers like this, freshness is everything, so getting bottle versions from Germany definitely lose something on the trip over.  And for whatever reason American microbreweries haven't really mastered this style.  So this is a legit German recipe and it's fresh.  Short of going to Munich it's hard to get better.   3.  Definitely recommend the monthly keg tappings.  Fun time and you get to try out the new offering for free in addition to seeing how they used to do kegs in the olden days."}
{"text":"Came here on a friend's recommendation. After paying for (mandatory) valet parking, we went in and asked for a table for two. Hostess looks at me as if I am off my rocker for thinking that we could get seated for dinner (at 9 pm!) and says, \"We aren't taking names any more tonight, but if you want to wait about an hour, we switch to open seating.\"  Open seating, as she further explains, means that at that point, we will have to wander the restaurant looking for an empty table, fight our way to it, hope no one else grabs it before we can get there, and then wait to have a server notice us.   We took one glance at the frat-boys and already-drunk cougars and decided to try one of the other places near by.   I don't care if they have the best German food on Earth (and looking at the priorities of the clientele, I'm guessing they don't) such lousy service is not going to win my business when there are so many other options in this town."}
{"text":"Best place to party!! European style...  They have an amazing view of the river. And if you are here on a weekend night, you are in for a treat with their Dance on the tables!!  You will forget all the stress."}
{"text":"I love this place! Great food and great atmosphere.  I love the live music, I look forward to that every time I come.  I also enjoy the monthly beers, I usually try that and am never disappointed."}
{"text":"Delicious!  Traditional food and beer. Brings back fond memories of Munich & Bavaria.   Service was very professional and friendly.   We will return again!  Auf Wiedersehen!"}
{"text":"The food is nothing special but I will keep coming back for the beer.  The Hefeweizen is my personal favorite.  I am not that into the band or the raucousness going on in the main room but I do enjoy hanging out in the beer garden.  It is a great place to take a break from a bike ride."}
{"text":"If your not German.. you are walking into this wonderland!! Its impossible not to smile and I have a blast every time I visit. I must order the potato pancakes every time.. so good.   I recommend ockoberfest.. its a really good time."}
{"text":"I used to always come here but probably won't anymore. I ordered a big beer for $9.25 and paid a cash tip to the bartender. When the charge went through on my account it came up as $19.25. Apparently someone wrote in a $10 dollar tip on the charge slip. When I called to get it refunded the manager was rude about it and when I stated \"My beer was only $9, why would I tip $10?\" She said rudely, \"Well I would because I am in the service industry.\" Seriously? Come on. The next manager that got on the phone was pleasant and refunded me quickly.   Not saying this will happen to everyone but it's definitely something to look out for."}
{"text":"Good food, great environment. Really smart addition to south side works. Really like that it's right on the river as well."}
{"text":"Ok so I gave this place five stars based on it's atmosphere and it's unique look inside and outside the building. Also for its awesome beer selection. The food is mediocre at best at least that's my opinion. They have a band here at night and its located in a very nice and safe area which is in the South Side Works of Pittsburgh. I recommend going at least once to try out their huge 52 ounce glass of beer it's 10 bucks by so worth it."}
{"text":"Pretzels and bier cheese. Do it even if you don't think you want them. Amazing. I love the schnitzel sandwich and their spaetzle. The food here is delicious, probably the best German in the city. But we all know that everyone comes for the beer. Hefeweizen is my go-to. Live German music and you can stand on the tables to sing a little Sweet Caroline. And an outdoor biergarten. Definitely a great time and perfect for my large group of drunk, rowdy friends.   The location makes it difficult to reach if you're bar hopping the rest of Southside (without driving and parking in one of the Works' garages). And it was way more fun here when shot skis, a legit Oktoberfest and less intense bouncers were a thing. 2010 Hofbrau would have gotten 5 stars."}
{"text":"A bit too crowded for my likes, but the selection of beer was very broad. The food accompanied the beer very well. The atmosphere was fun, seemed more for the younger crowd. Definitely a tourism spot if you're new to Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"A great German beer hall. The food is authentic, but they have selections for the people who are not fans of German food. Had the sausage meal, it game with 3 different types of sausage, mashed potatoes and sauerkraut. A meal that very filling and at a great price. The giant soft pretzel comes with 3 dips, cheese, stone ground mustard and a horseradish sauce. Atmosphere was very \"polka friendly\" with live music. I hear that it gets a little rowdy at late night. Well worth the visit !"}
{"text":"Looks like a great summer hangout.  Unfortunately, we went late on a cool Monday evening, so not exactly peak time.  We went too late for the kitchen to be opened (and missed out on the free birthday item), and so I didn't look too hard for vegan items on the menu, but it looked heavy on sausages, so perhps not too promising.   I choose a dark German beer - Dunkel - but it proved to be pretty bad, and left a nasty aftertaste (dish water, anyone?) - not at all what I expected from a German, and for this reason I can only give it 3 stars.  The birthday girl had a Manhattan, and that was much cheaper than you might pay elsewhere, so that was a surprise.    Would I go back?  Probably, but I'd be trying a different beer for sure, perhaps the monthly special.  But avoid the dark one."}
{"text":"We took our boss to Hofbrauhaus yesterday for lunch to celebrate her birthday at my suggestion, because we often have alumni events here and have always had a good time.  We had a group of eight and were seated on the deck since it was a gorgeous day.  We arrived and were seated by 12:15.  After waiting 10 minutes, a waitress appeared and asked if anyone wanted drinks.  I ordered a Diet Pepsi and my coworkers all stuck with water.  The waitress left and we waited.  And waited.  And waited.    At 12:40 when we still had not ordered, I went inside and flagged down a busboy, explaining that we were on a limited schedule and had not even gotten drinks yet.  He apologized, grabbed a waitress, and immediately came to take our order.  They said they had gotten crushed all the sudden and assured us our food would be out right away.  At 12:45 (half an our after we had arrived)  they finally brought my soda and said again our food was on the way.  At 1:05 when we still had not gotten any food or seen our server, I once again went inside and flagged down a bus boy, saying that we would need our food packed to go as we no longer had time to eat.  He promised it would be taken care of right away.  At 1:10 our waitress brought out a birthday sundae with a candle in it, which-- while incredibly thoughtful-- was not helpful since we still had not gotten out meals.  She said again our food would be out \"soon\" and I said again that we needed it to go.  We also asked for our checks.    At 1:15 we were finally given our checks (though we still had gotten any food) and discovered that the checks were incorrect.  We paid the incorrect checks anyway because by then we were starving and late.    At 1:20-- over an hour after we arrived-- we finally got our cold food to go.  This was a terrible and embarrassing birthday experience.  We ended up eating cold food in a meeting because of this.  There was no adjustment to our (incorrect) checks.  Despite working across the street from here, none of us will be back any time soon."}
{"text":"Dirndl, lederhosen and bier cheese---oh my! I visited this place on a Friday night and it was an experience. My friend forewarned me how packed this place gets but I wasn't prepared whatsoever. We got there around 7P and got a booth on the side-perfect for the people watching spectacle to come. Got the bier cheese and pretzel appetizer and I wish I could have sucked it up with a straw but inevitably it would have gone right to the booty. Plus I don't think sucking liquid cheese through a straw is socially acceptable?   Then the band started along with a Pens game playing on tv and yeah, the place was madness. I've never seen a place like this before with peeps standing up on their chairs, dancing, drinking and have a merry ole time to Neil Diamond and John Denver jams. And seeing I'm originally from FL and never got into hockey, it was an experience watching a hockey game in the Burgh. The crowd was out of control with security strategically placed throughout the hall ready to break up a fight at any moment (hooray for no crazy frat boys trying to show how ballsy they are!)  When we had to get up to use the restroom, we had to take a few minutes to plan the best route in order to avoid dancing or beer spillage.   Service was ok.....the waitress disappeared for a good while and I don't blame her. Food was good but priced a little too high. Mixed crowed with people of all ages but lots and lots of kiddies. I think it would be a fun place to go to in the summer time with the huge patio they have but other than that, it would be a one in a while kinda place for me to go to. But regardless, still a fun time. Next time, Shot-ski is on the agenda."}
{"text":"I've never been to Germany, but i recognize the company logo from travel shows and even the amazing race. So of course I had to go!  Because I was in town to assist a family member go to the hospital, all I could do was go for takeout. First impressions about the ambiance, when you step inside you kinda feel like your in a dream... you see the vats they use to make beer, wooden interior, german music, and pretty waitresses in german outfits. Went straight to the menu and ordered a pork shank and  breaded pork chop. While waiting for the order, people and families were all smiles enjoying their beers and meals. When it comes to food, they both tasted great, though i strongly recommend the pork shank! The saurkraut and coleslaw delicious.  I just wish driverless cars existed already so I could try out their beers as well before driving back."}
{"text":"Hofbrauhaus is a great spot to spend a night out. The highlight is the freshly brewed beer served by the liter at quite reasonable prices. I forget exactly how much a liter is, but it's less than $10, which is a steal for beer of this quality. All the beers are spot on, I've never sampled any of the food but it seems great for drunk munchies. Service is friendly and fairly efficient, even on crowded nights.  The crowd varies from rowdy college students to tamer, older groups, but it's never unpleasant and there's always seats to be had if you don't feel like standing with your beer. The outdoor area is lively yet relaxing during the summer, there's nothing quite like enjoying a stein (or three) looking out at the river and skyline."}
{"text":"The main hall was only filled 25% ... and we couldn't have a conversation  over the accordin player.   The soft pretzels with bier cheese were good.  Our meals were dense/filling ... but none of us would order our meals again (ham Turkey potato pancake in bier cheese or the pork cutlet breaded with sauerkraut x 2).  The Apple strudel was recommended by our very knowledgeable waitress ... it didn't rise to the occasion.  The beer is served at room temperature so the flavors are not lost  ... aka no frosted glass on a hot day ...   We finished our meal and went out to the beer garden ... the river breeze was lovely and we weren't screaming to have a conversation.  Overall ... not impressed"}
{"text":"A super fun experience every time! Whether you're with family or friends you can always have a good time at Hofbrauhaus. Their service is great and the staff is also great."}
{"text":"I only stopped by briefly for a beer, so I'll keep this review short.  It was my first time going to a Hofbrauhaus restaurant and to a beer garden in general. My first impression was positive. It's a perfectly situated restaurant in Southside Pittsburgh along the Monongahela River. The combination of 1 liter beer mugs, waterfront and waitresses in Dirndls made for a jolly good time.  The environment is very conducive to casual outdoor group drinking. The outdoor area is large with numerous tables. I'm guessing the capacity of the beer garden is close to 150 people. So it's a great place for group parties as well as for taking out of town guests like me who have never been to a beer garden before.    Beer was good I guess, but nothing spectacular. At the time, it was more about quantity over quantity. I didn't get a chance to sample the food, but judging from other tables there are definitely a lot of nice options that go well with beer. Service was pretty average, but waitresses in Dirndls is a plus (maybe?).   As I mentioned before, it's a great place for the occasional group outing. However, as another reviewer mentioned, it definitely carries a huge element of novelty. It's not your neighborhood bar and is not a real cozy place to grab a drink. With that said, I will be back to try the food if I am ever in town again."}
{"text":"Great beer!  Worst service I've seen in a while.  Will be calling the GM on Monday.  I'm too old to be treated like I'm in a college bar.    I would IMMEDIATELY ask Alexander if he wants to even be employed there.  Then start his new hire orientation again.    He wasn't the only bad apple.....just only name I collected and the worst offender.  Maybe it's his manager's fault?"}
{"text":"Love the litre of Dunkel and the nice soft pretzels to go with all that beer! Nice, festive atmosphere -- what one would expect in a place like this. Absolute chaos on the weekends, however, I prefer weeknights and the outdoor patio for an excellent view of the river."}
{"text":"OK was here on business and we walked in from the street and sat down at a table. It was a Monday night so not busy at all.. Inside is the old German arrangement of the large wooden tables and benches, very heavy, hard to move and seat about 4-6 on each side.  It is also a loud place due to acoustics I think......Also with the table/bench arrangement, If someone wants to get up and in the middle of the bench 2 or 3 people will have to move.  We ordered the German Sausage plates and they were pretty good.  There were 3 kinds on the plate. Smaller than other restaurants but still were very good.  Of course lots of German draft beers and the large ones are HUGE and excellent.... Service was just OK.. not friendly but we weren't ignored.  The recommendation I have though, is before  you sit down, walk around and check out the areas to sit.  If it is nice outside (you know those 3 sunny days in Pittsburgh :-) walk around the back and you see beautiful views of the river and lots of outdoor seating; Covered and uncovered.  There is a huge seating area in a lower level also with benches and tables that I am sure is crowded on weekends with good weather and Oktoberfest.  There was 6 of us and we were disappointed we did not see the outside area before we sat down because that is where we would have been,  It gets a solid 4 and if there during warm weather would go and sit outside."}
{"text":"Awesome beer and food. Of course it doesn't hurt I love Bavarian style Hef and savory food!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Hofbrauhaus!! The food is absolutely delicious. My favorite items to get there are the pretzels and beer cheese and their Chicken Marsala Spaezel. However, I have had their wurst and potatoes and that is wonderful too. They also have a great beer selection too! My favorite drink I've had there is their Oktoberfest. The best part of the Hofbrauhaus is their venue though. The inside of the building is the main restaurant/bar area which can get pretty rowdy at night. However, if you would rather have a quieter meal, you can go to the outside area which is picnic table style and overlooks the river. I went to the original Hofbrauhaus in Munich a few years ago and whenever I sit in the outside area, I imagine myself being back in Bavaria!"}
{"text":"I love the Hofbrauhaus when it's not busy.  When they're busy, service can be an issue because the servers are overwhelmed.  However, when they are moderately busy, the food is good (Sauerbraten, baby), the service is good, and the beers are AMAZING!  I am particularly a fan of the hefeweitzen."}
{"text":"I went to Hofbrauhaus with my boyfriend and a few of his friends to grab a drink and check out the Pittsburgh nightlife.  The inside is surprisingly huge but has a very laid-back vibe.  The main hall with live music was packed so we found a table quickly in the quieter hall next door.  Most people around us were still ordering food, but we decided to just go with drinks.  I ordered a liter (yes, a full liter!) of their wheat beer, which was good (if not slightly warm towards the last few sips).  The beer was reasonably priced for the amount they served and overall, I had a great experience here.  Should have gotten a souvenir boot!"}
{"text":"Ah German food, so simple in execution but yet the results are so pleasing.  For those that aren't familiar with German food, here's a crash course on what to expect:  generous helpings of meat, veggies, and beer.  The brand new Hofbrauhaus in Pittsburgh's Southside Works is no exception.    I've been here several times, both before and after traveling to the original Hofbrauhaus in Munich, Germany earlier this summer.  I'm happy to say that the experience here is as close as you can get to the \"real\" thing.  The beer hall is loud, you share your table with complete strangers, beer is served by the liter, and often times there is live German music (did I mention that dancing on the tables is encouraged?).  The food is very good and a great representation of the German style.  But what you'll really come here for is the beer.  Brewed on the premises under direction of the Reinheitsgebot (German Purity Law), they include a Lager, Light Lager, Dunkel, Weizen, and a seasonal brew.  At prices just under $8 per liter, it's a steal compared to other bars in the Southside.  Even if there a few Americanized touches here and there, it feels like an authentic German experience right in your back yard.  What more could you ask for?  Prost!"}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere, large portions and great staff. The cheese dip is great and the beers are worth taking the time to enjoy. Over all it was an experience worth repeating."}
{"text":"There are plenty of places to drink beer in Pittsburgh... more than plenty... maybe even too many... OK  so you want to swill some brew from the Fatherland do ya?  My recommendation, go to the Fatherland.  This place is just silly.  The costumes the women wear are absurd.  The beer is only OK and the food is yucky.  My friend and I ordered soups... which never came.  My friend ordered the steak salad and I some spaetzle dish that was supposed to have \"field mushrooms,\" Marsala wine, cream sauce, caramelized onions and chicken.   The mushrooms were basic and practically non existent.  The caramelized onions, if present, had disappeared into the cream goo entirely.  There wasn't even a hint of Marsala ... not a smidge ... not an iota.  The chicken was cooked to death.   I ordered a Hefeweisen to ease the pain and it was extremely herby tasting ... too much for my taste really... I asked for some lemon (yes you have to ask), and unsurprisingly, it too never came.  I elected to not drink the beer and try a dessert.  The strudel arrived in a sweet sauce with some raspberry flavoring.  It was piping hot because it was nuked into a pile of mush.  DISGUSTING.  I asked the waiter to remove the beer from the bill since I didn't drink it.  He had to ask the manager which seemed to bother him.  He took it off the bill.  The waiter was extremely handsome with a deep velvety voice and was the only fun thing (for me) about the experience.  Though his waitering could have been better his eye candy appeal was top notch.  Good place to people watch and drink, bad place to eat.  The appetizers sounded good but were crazy expensive for one person to order for themselves."}
{"text":"I'm sad to say that I was a little underwhelmed on my first visit to Hofbrauhaus. I saw the other location in Las Vegas, so on my recent trip to Pittsburgh, I made an attempt to visit this location. I was really hoping that the place would be more lively and a fun place to get a beer/ start off the trip, but unfortunately this was not the case. Maybe the place had a quitter atmosphere because it was 8pm on a Thursday?   I also thought the menu was very over-priced, which is to be expected at a gimmicky place like this. However, for a place that claims to be a German beer house, I was confused that the beer selection consisted of 5 choices, none of which were pumpkin flavored.    I'm still giving a 3 star review because the food and beer were good and my friends and I enjoyed ourselves, but had to say that I was a little disappointed. I'm open to trying the Vegas location the next time I visit though."}
{"text":"To be honest this is not my favorite place in Pittsburgh and I have not visited in a while-it is loud, the food/beer is not great and the German bands are annoying. On my last visit I was prepared to write a 2 star review but was surprised at the food and service.  In past visits the food has been horrible however on this visit I was pleasantly surprised how good everything tasted. We only had to wait about 15 minutes on a busy Friday night to sit in the main seating area. Our waitress was very prompt (not friendly but she was busy and quick to get our orders and food). I started with the large glass of the wheat beer.  This is not my favorite place for beer and it is just your average German wheat beer.  We went with the pretzels and beer cheese as our starter. I have had bad experiences with the beer cheese tasting like paste but this time it surprised me and was delicious.  For my entrée I ordered the club sandwich. I changed a few things on it and they had no problem getting my order straight. I choose the mashed potatoes as my side which were equally as tasty.  All in all a great place to have a drink on a Friday night with friends but eat before you come."}
{"text":"We were seated at the enclosed terrace, which was adorable with lights all over the ceiling. It would be a great place to sit at in the spring/summer when you can enjoy the breeze and look out over the lake.   When I looked at the menu, I didn't even bother trying to pronounce the names because I knew I'd butcher it and embarrass myself in front of the server. I pointed to the Bayerischer Schweinsbraten, which was pork roast with a potato dumpling and sauerkraut, while my boyfriend got the Schnitzel Weiner Art, which was breaded pork cutlet with cranberry sauce, potato salad, and cabbage. Both dishes were delicious and the meats were just really tender and flavorful. I loved the potato sides from both dishes; the potato dumpling was really savory and flavorful while the potato salad had soft chunks that had a sweet tinge to them.   You have to end your meal with the Apfel Strudel (apple strudel with vanilla and raspberry sauce ) and vanilla ice cream on the side.  It's not too heavy and it's great to share with someone else!  The food here is solid and you really can't go wrong by coming here."}
{"text":"Been to the original and this was a decent replica. It's definitely a plus to the area of Pittsburgh. It's right next to the river, so get an outdoor seat if weather permits.  It's a huge building and the portions are also huge (so share or bring a crowd).   The pretzel and beer cheese were great. The wursts were quite yummy and juicy. The bread dumpling was slightly too dense and dry. The pork roast was also a smidge dry, but maybe these items are better on other days. The apple strudel was similar to the one in Munich, but I can't put my finger on it...it wasn't as good (maybe the layers were too soggy?)    Please don't come here to get a hamburger...there are a ton of great foods to try.  Prices were good and the overall experience was great. I wasn't here for the music or anything, but it looks to have a fun setup."}
{"text":"Only restaurant I've ever been too that told us that they were too busy for us to order food when the restaurant is only 1/2 full.  It's a shame they didn't let us know before we paid for valet parking.  Usually love the Hofbräuhaus but very dissatisfied with this turn of events.  Poor planning?  I feel sorry for the servers."}
{"text":"Went here for college night. Lots of fun and cheap beer. Pretzels are to die for-- especially after a few rounds of beer. Very crowded though and expect to wait to get in and again to get a table. Good vibes"}
{"text":"When the Schatzi said he was taking me to Hofbräuhaus for lunch last Sunday, I died a little inside. I immediately recalled the inedible meal that I had been served at Munich's Hofbräuhaus. Boy am I glad I kept an open mind, because I had a delightful time at this place!  First, our server, Karen, was the bee's knees! She was pleasant, attentive, and friendly. The food didn't hurt my feelings either. My boyfriend ordered the massive pretzel appetizer and he loved it. He's about the proudest Bavarian from backwoods Bavaria you ever did meet, so he knows him some pretzels if'n ya know what I mean! I ordered the cheese fries. I'm not a big fan of cheese sauce on my fries; I prefer the real deal! But these things were A-mazing. I could eat that cheese sauce by the spoonful. Also, when I asked for my Southern tzatziki aka ranch dressing, Karen didn't culture shame me. So gracious!! And speaking of the ranch, unexpectedly good -- at a Bavarian restaurant, no less!! Maybe even house made?  Now let's talk about that schnitzel. I had the Jägerschnitzel and it was awesome. It tasted pretty authentic, but what does authentic mean? I'd be lying through my teeth if I said I never had crappy schnitzel the whole time I lived in Germany, and I'm pretty sure all of those schnitzels -- even the less tasty ones -- were made by Germans. The schnitzel was not heavily breaded, which I prefer. The hungry Bavarian sitting to my left said that, although his schnitzel didn't taste authentic to him, he didn't care because it tasted so good.  It's a regional thing; an Oma in one town probably has a completely different prep style than an Oma in a town a couple clicks away.  To all ye hipsters, stop beating ye auld drumme of authenticity!  Since we're on the subject of hipsters, there was a noticeable lack of hipsters and young intelligentsia cluttering up the booths. Can I get an amen, praise Jesus, and a hallelujah all at once?!? It could be because Hofbräuhaus is a -- gasp! chain restaurant! Fine by me. The pleasure of a dining experience is inversely related to hipsters. Score!  Another score? The serving sizes should come with a warning. A skull and crossbones would be too severe, but perhaps a \"consult a physician before...\" could be helpful. Seriously, though, anything that saves this girl money and doesn't skimp on quality? Win-win in my book!  Would I go back?? No need to threaten me with a good time!"}
{"text":"one of the best things to happen to Pittsburgh.  To start off we got the giant soft pretzel with the 3 dipping sauces.  all were phenomenal.  I guess i really liked the bier cheese because everything I ate here was smothered in it.  delicious.  Got the sampler with all the different beers they made.  Really liked their seasonal beer - got a whole litre!! THE MAD BAVARIAN was an awesome entertainer.  I would like to listen to more of his music, but i can not find him on a website - if anyone knows where i can listen to more of his stuff that would be awesome!  great German restaurant.  Would definately go back for the bier cheese !"}
{"text":"I love Hofbrauhaus. It can get insanely busy during peak dining/bar hours, but I have also found it to be great for groups and for families. I've never had anything on the menu that wasn't delicious. The hefferveisen is my favorite from any brewery I've ever had. That said, you never know how long your wait will be and how loud it will be even it's it relatively early in the evening (four or five PM). Parking is annoying."}
{"text":"So we went with a group of friends at like 730 on a saturday night.  As expected the wait was about 45 minutes to an hour.  It wasn't too big of a deal, they texted and or called the designated cell phone when the table was ready, so we were free to roam.  After being seated, i perused their gluten free menu.  Overall, I was impressed.  I had the German sausages with sauerkraut and mashed potatoes.   Let me say, i was super skeptical because I actually don't like sauerkraut at all.  Well... I have been converted.   The food was excellent.  The sausages were moist, tender, perfectly cooked and deliciously seasoned.  The sauerkraut wasn't ridiculously sour and the potatoes were creamy clouds of goodness."}
{"text":"Look, you don't have to be a historian to understand the evils that Germany has been responsible for (and therefore I don't need to explain here). But there is an evil that has somehow eluded the iron shackles of shame....the evils of German food.  It is easily in the bottom 3 of ethnic cuisines.  So I guess that makes my review a bit biased.  But let me regale you with some truth, dear reader; WHOM AMONGST YOUR FRIENDS IS A GERMAN FOOD FAN?!!?! What's that I hear?  Crickets?  That's what I thought.  And I am not counting anyone who has friends named Hans or Helmut or Kurt etc...Beer cheese? Let the Italians and French handle cheese, let the Germans handle beer and roads without speed limits.  (Kraftwerk is my favorite German export, check them out sometime).  Potato pancakes are bland and unappealing.  The thing with pancakes is this....they're not good for you, even these starchy messes.  So if you're going to indulge, go whole hog and go to a breakfast place that specializes in them. (Don't you love how pancakes have escaped the wrath of dietitians and the public? It is a desert that has hitched its ride to breakfast.  What a scam, no wonder most of us get sweaty and out of breath just reading yelp reviews). German sausages!?!?! GO TO CURE AND GET GOOD PORK PRODUCTS.  THE GERMANS CAN'T DO PORK EITHER!!!    I guess Hofbrahaus was fighting with one hand behind their back in the first place.  Anyways...this is a fair to middling drinking place.  If you have out of town friends who come from a relatively rural or small town..they might enjoy the gimmick.     The beer garden itself is a pretty nice spot to enjoy beers on the weekend as well...so I have to acknowledge that.  But it is quite Bro heavy...so if that's not your scene, I get it.     IF THIS RESTAURANT WERE A MUSICIAN/BAND: Frankie Yankovic.  Polka is pretty bad by most measures, but old people and drunks  love it.  But they can't defend their love of it."}
{"text":"An enormous place that is perfect for bringing a big group to hang out at the tables.  Got a liter of hefeweizen and dinner was great, huge portions, and most importantly, they got the sauerkraut right, important for any German place.    Check out the gift shop too, the prices on souvenir stuff was a lot better than other places I've been to"}
{"text":"I loved this atmosphere, people were singing along with the live band and the food was amazing."}
{"text":"The wife & I were in town for a concert and our friend recommended this place. We arrived on Saturday, shortly after they opened at 11:00. There was only one party ahead of us in the entire place.  The restaurant resembles a German bier haus, which my wife & I loved.  Waitress was very nice. We started with the beer sampler, five beers for $6.95. The beer is okay, nothing to brag about. We enjoyed the Octoberfest beer and the Dunkel.  We moved on to the sauerkraut balls. These things were awesome. If you are not offended by sauerkraut, you must try these. I then ordered the Hofbrauhaus Wurstlplatte and substituted sauerkraut for regular spaetzle. This is my third German restaurant and I finally found out the right way, how spaetzle is supposed to taste. The sausage was all very good. The wife got the Schnitzel Weiner Art.  The portion was huge so I was able to steal some of her food and it was fantastic. This place is great and cannot wait to return. We came for Judas Priest but loved the Hofbrauhaus..."}
{"text":"They make their own beer and they have my favorite, Hefe Weisen.  The food was good, the beer was fresh and tasty, the musicians were drinking and playing.  The waitresses dressed in the German outfits just made it that much better.   They have a gift room with everything you can think of from mugs to shirts and candy. Very good."}
{"text":"Hofbrauhaus is about the experience, not the food. The music, the noise, the crowd and the overall ambiance make for a fun, festive place to celebrate or drink some over-sized beers.   Speaking of beers I am generally a fan of Hofbrauhaus' selection. The three standard selections (Lager, Hefe weizen and Dunkel) are all good (I have a particular love for the Dunkel). Be sure to check out the rotating specials. And if you aren't sure - ask for a sample or two (or three). The staff is great about this - they want you to enjoy your drink.  In terms of food: stick with german fare. Bratwurst, pretzels and such. Don't be surprised that Hofbrauhaus' salad isn't spectacular. Its a German beer garden, not Whole Foods.   Go with a group, sit outside on a nice warm day and drink a beer. Not much is better."}
{"text":"Nice Germanic environment, spacious seating.. Had pork shank & bratwurst plus beer, all great!"}
{"text":"Went here a few times but this is my first review. Definately loud inside for a Tuesday. We ordered the pretzels and cheese, salmon, Pittsburgh steak salad and Wiener schnitzel. Everyone liked what they had; the portions were large; everything was hot; prices were a little high; and our waitress was pretty absent after the food was delivered. The service definitely could've been better. Overall it was a three star night."}
{"text":"I love Hofbrauhaus.  I went to the one in Munich and this one in Pittsburgh is very similar.  This restaurant has a very European feel, especially the beer hall and the outside seating.  The food and drinks were excellent,  Try the pretzels and have a Hefeweizen!"}
{"text":"We came here on a Sunday night for a late dinner so it wasn't very crowded. There was a guy on stage singing most of the time we were there. He sang both German and cover songs. We started off with beers and the Oktoberfest pretzel - it was so good and I liked the different sauces that came with it. How do you top soft pretzels and beer? With giant pretzels and liters of beer.. can't go wrong with that combination. For dinner, I had the jagerschnitzel - pork cutlet topped with burgundy wine mushroom and bacon sauce and my boyfriend had the wiener schnitzel - similar to what I had minus the sauce. Both were really good and big portions.   Wish we could've seen what it was like here on a Friday or Saturday night."}
{"text":"Amazing food and atmosphere. A very jolly place that is loud and robust and an overall great experience. The food is delicious and the beer is unique and delicious. A bit pricey and hectic but absolutely fun!"}
{"text":"The beer garden here is simply AWESOME.  They just do it right, great place to enjoy a big beer on a warm night.  Kind of out of the way, but come right in, down the stairs, and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Pros: Beer was very good  Cons: Food tastes like frozen and what I can buy in the grocery store - expensive tourist trap  I was told if I were in Pittsburgh, this place is a must.  The service here was top notch.  We were a party of four and Chris was very attentive and knowledgable about the beer.  I got the sampler, which ran under $8 for 5 beers. What a deal!  They were all good.   The food was nothing special. The pretzel appetizer was too salty.  My pierogies tasted like Mrs. T's.  They were supposed to have bacon and chives, but all I got were pierogies with sour cream and onion straws.  We were there for the trivia night, which was enjoyable. During that, I got the nacho appetizer.  Again, nothing special.  The food is extremely overpriced for the quality.  You can phone in the German music and mead hall atmosphere, but it doesn't fix the food.  Go for the beer...after going to dinner at the Cheesecake Factory across the street."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Sauerkraut balls are delicious appetizer.  Parking is a little bit rough (hard to find a spot close by) awesome selection of draft beers to choose from."}
{"text":"Great German fare at reasonable prices! Wonderful ambiance and a great outdoor area, even in cooler weather."}
{"text":"Glad we went. Overall experience positive. Ambience at lunch less raucous than evening dining. Accordian player adds charm and is nice if you are dining with someone celebrating a birthday, as he announces it and recognizes them with song. The view of the river is very pretty. The Dunkel beer selection is a pleasant tasting one, brewed in the Germanic tradition and served in a large clear beer stein. The food as one would expect is typical German fare, no surprises here. Not huge on flavor. But the dessert strudel was made on site fresh, delicate and delicious!  Excellent way to end your meal."}
{"text":"I came here with high hopes after hearing multiple friends rave about it. The food took over an hour and was room temperature at best, our waiter comes back in 20-30 minute intervals. We've been sat since 6:30 and have been waiting for our checks for another 30 minutes. I won't be coming here willingly any time in the future."}
{"text":"A very nifty place to visit while in Pittsburgh. We're vegan so our food choices were limited. But there was a veggie burger and the soft pretzels were vegan (without the cheese sauce). The pretzels were absolutely amazing. So soft and flavorful. My mouth is watering just thinking about them now. The inside part of restaurant gets very very loud, but you can go outside for a quiet place to talk. The restaurant and beer garden area is huge!  The beers can be ordered in a normal size or a ginormous mug that I needed 2 hands for.  They also have a variety of mule drinks that come in the copper mugs.  Their German beers are made on site. There's also a gift shop for souvenirs."}
{"text":"I got the Wurst meal of the month here....it lives up to the title for sure! Don't Forget to ask for real mustard."}
{"text":"A great place to go with large groups of people. Adequate bar food, decent beer, fun entertainment, attentive service. The history is interesting, but the presence of a gift shop adds to the off-putting feeling of fairly obvious American over-commercialization."}
{"text":"The food is always great as is the service. We go when the weather is nice enough to sit outside."}
{"text":"There was a large group of us that went to Hofbrauhaus a week ago.  I had been there a few different times during the week or on a Friday.  This was a Saturday night and they do not take reservations on Saturday nights.  We waited approxmately two hours to get seated (eight of us).    I thought the service was great.  Our waitress was very attentive, especially with the size of our group.  I enjoyed the food, beer, and environment in the bier garden as well.  It is a great place to go with a large group.  I would definately go back to Hofbrauhaus, just not on a Saturday night so I could avoid waiting a few hours!"}
{"text":"Food is ok.  If I want traditional German I would go to Max's Allegheny Tavern.  That being said the beer is top notch.  The atmosphere is great.  It gives you the choice of being in a near authentic Bier Hall or a Ratskellar all in one restaurant.  Great place to go if you wanna have a fun time."}
{"text":"This place was great!!  We sat outside on the massive porch and enjoyed a few liters of beer.  The food is fantastic and the salad could feed a small army.  Will definitely come back when I am in the area."}
{"text":"Carbs aplenty...with a side of meat!  Tasty German food, but my favorite thing are the pretzels with the cheese sauce....love them!  This place has a few different dining atmospheres. There is the big hall, with long tables and communal benches where I have seen people dancing on the tables and singing along with the musician. There is also a more traditional dining room area. Then, there is an outdoor beer garden, which is pretty great when the weather is nice- umbrellas, a river view, and tables for both smaller and bigger groups, so it's a great place to bring a crowd. No worries about having 'everyone in your party present in order to be seated.' They are totally cool with people coming and going. The service is good. Even out in the beer garden, servers come by to check on you frequently, which is good if people keep coming and going from your big group....or if people decide they are hungry at different times.   Now, the beer....I'm more of a cocktail girl, but everyone here seems to enjoy the beer choices...and the sizes. They offer beers in the liter and half-liter size. There is something enjoyable about hefting a weighty 1L glass....this beer is no joke, though. Once, while passing through the indoor hall, someone vomited right in front of me. So, watch out for those liter beers. They pack a punch, and not everyone handles it well. One final note - the outfits the waitresses wear make me feel like a bad feminist for patronizing this place, but I do it anyway."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere but if you're looking to just experience the beer and the food I would suggest going earlier in the evening or at lunch time. It gets packed with a younger crowd at night, the music is pretty loud and they recycle the same 6 songs that college kids love to sing out loud when theyve been drinking. Also you always leave smelling like the food! The outdoor beer garden is great during warm months though because you can sit outside along the river and hear the people you are with. Good experience once in awhile but just be careful as to the time of day you go!"}
{"text":"Went there twice for the lunch buffet - enjoyed it the first time; wasn't too happy after the second. The buffet is a great place to try German food in addition to the add-on starters (pancake was better than the pretzel) and dessert items (puff pastry was better than the streudel). Place was quite and the few who were there looked they were on a lunch break. The buffet table and utensils are outdated but very clean. Staff are usually friendly. Want too happy about paying for parking (street/deck) when most other restaurants validate parking for upto 2 hours). The soups on the buffet are a bit salty but AWESOME!"}
{"text":"Decent traditional German food?  Check.  Delicious German beer?  Check.  Polka music?  Check!!!  Need I say more?  Probably not, but I'm going to anyway.  This place is really fun to visit with good buddies and to get a bit of a buzz.  Will the food knock your socks off?  Probably not especially, though it certainly isn't bad food.  Is the beer ground-breaking?  Not exactly, but it tastes good, fresh, cold, and comes in large and ridiculously large (always a good choice).  Are there many other places out there where you can drink and hear live polka music?  Very few!  Enjoy the atmosphere, have a sausage, and drink a beer.  You'll feel better after you do."}
{"text":"I was traveling for work this week and staying at a nearby hotel.  I wanted something different than \"national chain\" restaurant food but close by and the hotel front desk recommended Hofbrauhaus.  It proved to be an excellent recommendation.  The service at the resturant was quick and efficient from the front door all the way through paying the bill.  The German food that we had was delicious.  I had the house brewed Hefe Weizen and Sauerbraten and Apple Streudel for dessert.  I'd highly recommend this establishment."}
{"text":"This would have gotten a 4 because as great as it is, it's not the original ... and nothing beats the original.  They do, however, do a really really great job with this location.  It's definitely a solid, consistent 4.  The 5 comes from them finally introducing my all time favorite  German beer.  Kristalweizen.  If you've never had a Kristal, I'd highly recommend.  It's basically a Hefe that's been filtered.  Add a lemon and you have a great summer beer.  Drink that in the Hofbrauhaus Pittsburgh Biergarten and you get 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"The Hofbrauhaus is definitely a fun place to visit if you are in the area and love German culture. I went for dinner with my family on a Saturday, and it was only a few minute wait for a table outside. The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable on the food and beer selection, and all food and drink came out quickly!   I ordered the hefeweizen to drink, and the hot brown for dinner. The beer is honestly pretty strong, so if you aren't a huge drinker, you may need to prepare yourself for a little buzz. The hot brown is usually the standard choice for me, because it is basically a potato pancake smothered in cheese. It's very good, but very rich.   There is usually a German band playing inside, so it is always a little too loud to converse with the people at your table, so I prefer to visit this establishment in the summer. This isn't somewhere I would want to go to every weekend, but it is nice to go and get a different experience like once or twice a year."}
{"text":"Came here after the Whiskey and Fine Spirits Festival...great idea. We wanted to sit inside and dance but it was packed so we sat outside. I was bummed at first because I wanted my out of town friends to experience the 'Haus for all its glory but outside was a lot of fun as well.   Fast Service. GREAT Beer. Its was a total sausage...wait...bratwurst fest (which I'm always OK with :-)"}
{"text":"Having been to the real Hofbrauhaus in Munich I was excited to hear about this one in Pittsburgh.  We loved it.  The location is fantastic.  The beer was great accompanied by live polka music on a Saturday afternoon.  We tried the schnitzel which was perfect and the sauerkraut was lovely."}
{"text":"We went here after biking, which may have been a bad choice because the beers are ginormous! Let me tell you, I had trouble riding my bike back after just one... The beer itself was just standard, nothing special, but it seemed a little too easy to drink a beer the size of my head... so they have something going for them.   All we go to eat was pretzels, and they were good, but also nothing too special. I think that the important thing here is that nothing is too expensive, you can sit outside on the river, and the beers are as big as your head!"}
{"text":"Not a bad place to go for an experience.  I don't know how often they have a band, but every time I've been there they have.  So it gets pretty loud in there.  It's not a place I'd want to go all the time, but it's fun every once in a while.  The food is ok.  It's German style obviously, and some of it isn't to my liking, but most of it's at least decent.  If you haven't been there, I'd definitely recommend at least trying it.  It's better with a big group of friends though, not as a date."}
{"text":"The is such a great fun place. Great environment, great music, great food. There isn't a bad item on the menu, great view when you're sitting outside. The service is phenomenal and it's very large and spacious."}
{"text":"This place has some of the best booze and food out there and an AMAZING high-energy atmosphere. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the last 2 times I was in there, the hostess got my # wrong (too noisy) and we ended up waiting nearly 45 mins due to the text message notification not coming through. I recommend checking in on your own accord periodically to ensure you didn't get passed over by mistake! It'd be nice if we could all input our numbers ourselves."}
{"text":"I'm so glad it's finally summer so I can enjoy the patio here. I visited on a Wednesday for my monthly girls dinner. It was not crowded at all. The Beer Garden patio is seat yourself. It has tons of picnic table and bistro table seating as well as it's own bar area and a few high tops.   Service was a little slow for it being so empty. I ordered the Beer Cheese Chicken. It's a huge portion so be prepared. The dinner comes with two chicken breast, mashed potatoes and sautéed peppers and onions. I was really happy with it. The mashed potatoes are amazing!   They have three main beer selections from Hofbrauhaus and one monthly seasonal beer. They have additional craft beers on tap available on a menu in the bar area.    I can't wait to go back for happy hour this summer."}
{"text":"I like the set up and the high ceilings--really adds to the old German beer hall atmosphere. Hofbrauhaus really strives to set itself apart from the other restaurants in Pittsburgh and it definitely earns its gold star for being quite unique. I also really like the outside seating and the view of the river. Great location! I don't like beer in general so I didn't order their beer.   When it comes to the food and service, however, I thought it's a bit on the lacking side. Our waitress was rude and impatient. I'm not familiar with German food or language, so of course sifting through the menu took longer than wanted. The waitress got a bit snappy when I asked her to explain some items on the menu. I ended up ordering the Ofenfrischer Leberkase, which came with a slice of meatloaf, a fried egg on top and some German potatoes. The meatloaf straight up tasted like processed meat with the rubbery consistency of cheap hotdogs. The potatoes were okay and fried egg tasted like fried egg. I did not enjoy my meal.   Overall, I respect the effort and creative attempt to imitate a German beer hall. The rating I'm giving is a very reluctant 3 for the concept. When it comes to the actual food, I don't think this place lives up to all the hype. I recommend Hofbrauhaus as a place to try for the experience, but definitely not a place I will return to satisfy my taste buds."}
{"text":"Great place to have a fun happy hour with friends! They had plenty of space to accommodate our large group and they let us know where we had to sit in order to get happy hour specials, when we originally sat ourselves in the wrong area. The happy hour deals here are great, their craft beer is only $3 and appetizers are half off. We ordered spinch dip, soft pretzles and cheese, and loaded fries. All of it tasted great and came out hot. I also really enjoyed their Original Lager beer, it had a crisp finish and wasn't too hoppy. The atmosphere here is one of the best parts. As you walk in, you feel like you have walked into a restaurant in Germany. There are large wooden tables, traditionally decorated rooms, and German entertainment. It's different from the typical restaurant/bar scene, which I found very refreshing and relaxing."}
{"text":"I don't come here for the food, although if you are a fan of German fare, you may come for the food. I come here for the beer (oh, delicious, yummy beer served in 1 liter mug) and the atmosphere, whether it is dance on the table to live music in the main hall or talking to friends on the balcony enjoying the view of the river.  It's a great place for a group of very loud people, not so much intimate dinners."}
{"text":"The beer is good, yet the food is underwhelming. My husband really loves the beer, a redeeming quality, but otherwise this place is a 2 star in my book. The service was slow when we went, the food didn't come fast or hot. I'll avoid my snobbery, but as someone that is of German descent, and has visited Germany, all of the food we tried is a sad representation. I know most people are interested in the experience, which Hofbrauhaus provides, but if you're interested in delicious German food, find a grandma and save yourself heartbreak."}
{"text":"I was here for a business dinner, and the company was great, the beer was great, but the food was just...okay. Maybe I'm not a fan of German food?  We had a private area on the side, as there was a huge group, and the dinner was buffet. The place was dimly lighted, like most restaurants, but this comes into play later....Nothing was marked, so I didn't know what anything was, except for the big fat pretzels. Them I knew! But they weren't super warm and there wasn't any mustard or cheese to dip them into. But they were decent. There was also brisket, then breaded cutlets of chicken (I think)-is that schnitzel?, some chicken in a mushroom sauce and a few other things, although I don't remember them because I didn't eat them.  The chicken cutlet was good, but could have used some sauce or something. The chicken in the mushroom sauce was deelish, and the brisket...was not brisket. Okay, remember I said it was dark in there? And I may have had a couple beers or so, but I took a bite of the brisket and was like. Woah. Not brisket. Not brisket. I had to ask my friend and she said \"Of course not, you silly Texan, it's pickled sauerkraut!\" So yeah. Not at all brisket.  We had apple strudel for dessert and that was good stuff! But the meal was just okay. Again, it may have been just me and my tastes.  I should be back here next year for the business meeting, and if they have dinner here again, of course I'll go, but I definitely won't get the \"brisket\"!"}
{"text":"really great place to go out with friends. Love the large tables and outside seating. Good variety of food and yummy!"}
{"text":"I have to be honest: Hofbrauhaus is just not my kind of place. The noise levels alone are enough reason for me to keep my distance. But, a friend really wanted to come here over the weekend to enjoy lots of German food and a side of beer, so I came with an open mind, good company, and an empty stomach.  As I mentioned, the noise level here is not kind to the ears - chatty patrons and (some admittedly fantastic) live performances alike make the volume almost overwhelming. This is not a place to come with a large group or anyone you want to have a real conversation with; you won't be able to hear anyone who's not next to or across from you. I'm admittedly not a fan of the seating here either, as the long tables and long benches ensure that getting up and down if you sit anywhere other than the very end of said tables and benches is not easy.  Once I'd sat down and committed myself to staying in that seat for the duration of the visit, it was time to decide what to order. My group started off with a pretty phenomenal appetizer. It was a sampler with multiple sauces (including some outstanding bier cheese), pretzels, fried prickles, sauerkraut balls, and potato pancakes (with applesauce on the side, of course!). Everything on this sampler was perfect and amazing and delightful. I'm not even usually a fan of sauerkraut, and I enjoyed the fried sauerkraut balls that came with this order.  On to the main courses; I opted for the Munich Market Salad because healthy eating and all that (I know, not exactly the place to go for the healthiest meal - had I mentioned a friend wanted to eat here?). And it was a fairly fancy salad - lettuce, strawberries, cranberries, pecans, pineapple, oranges, feta cheese...a pretty good combination, I'd say. Unfortunately, I also ordered the glazed salmon to top it. That extra salmon cost $4.99 - and as my picture proves, my salad came with the tiniest piece of salmon I've ever seen. I admit, that disappointed me, especially compared to the amount of meat on my friends' various orders. If decimal points were allowed, this surprise would definitely be reflected in my final star rating. But, decimal points are not allowed - and I primarily ordered a good salad, and a good salad was delivered to me. I actually intended to eat half of it and take some home for the next day...yeah, that didn't happen. I enjoyed it all right then and there.  So clearly my experience was up and down, but at the end of the night the downs weren't deal breakers. Like I said, I came with an open mind, and while Hofbrauhaus is not my kind of place, my experience and meal overall was just fine (although I certainly won't be ordering salmon on a salad again here). I admittedly won't become a regular patron any time soon, but I can appreciate why people like it and I won't tell people to avoid it entirely. If I'm asked to return again, I know I would enjoy exploring more of the menu. (And if nothing else, now I know that you can buy growlers at the bar here! Yes please!)"}
{"text":"My first real trip to the Hofbrauhaus house. it was for a friend's birthday. It was an Saturday night, but it was completely packed. we had to wait outside for about 35 minutes. There was plenty of outdoor seating, so it wasn't bad at all.  we finally got seated and it took a few minutes to get ordered but I expected that since it was packed. Every seat was taken. I had some wine because I'm really not much of a beer person.  The wine was super delicious.   The food was really good. I know had spinach dip. My boyfriend had schnitzel and he loved it.   The experience is where the 4 star comes in people dancing on tables and singing covers of songs. It's really fun and definitely worth the trip at least once."}
{"text":"Excellent food. I've wanted to try this place for a long time and I finally was traveling on my own and got to come over. It's Labor Day so it wasn't crowded but I sat at the bar anyway. Order pork schnitzel and it was fabulous. Got the bier cheese spaetzel on recommendation by the bartender and was glad I did. Fun place. Beer was fine about what I expected. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"This place always disappoints.  The food, in general, is bland and uninteresting.  Some items, like the potato pancakes, cross all the way into being flavorless.  What about the beer, you ask?  It is no better than okay and often served at the wrong temperature.  More than once, I've received a glass of beer that was damned near room temperature...and no, not all the beers on their menu should be served that warm.. Even when served at the proper temperature, their beers are not remarkable.  They aren't even as good as Sam Adams, which I consider to be just over the line into being good.  With the growth of brew pubs in the region, there are about a jillion places that have better beer.  German restaurants are pretty sparse around here, I concede, but I'm not sure that is much of a reason to choose this place for dinner.  That brings me to the wurst part of going here. (See what I did there?)  IT'S REALLY REALLY NOISY!!!!!11!  There's generally some mook wrestling an accordion to its death and several caucasians of Chads fist bumping and bro-ing at the tops of their voices and the inevitable drunken Yinzers yinzing their lungs out.  N' at."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch. I ordered the lunch buffet.  It was only $11.99 and it had everything I wanted. Everything was amazingly delicious."}
{"text":"Beautiful sunny low humidity July evening in the Biergarten next to the river? Heavenly! What a great place - had no idea about this outdoor biergarten with the Hefe Weizen we fell in love with when we were over in Germany last year. Lots of long open tables with open seating and a few smaller tables for more intimate drinking and dining. Mehr Bitte!!!"}
{"text":"Hofbrauhaus is one of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh because it's a dining experience. There's live music, great beer and surprisingly good food.   You can't beat the atmosphere here. My favorite is sitting outside at the bier garden. The main dining hall inside is always bustling, and it's a lot of fun. My son loves to dance to the music in the front by the band, and it's so cute to watch. If you're coming on a weekend, come early before it gets super crazy and check in ahead of time on the no wait app.   You can't come here without getting the pretzels and bier cheese. The cheese is to die for! I love the hot brown, and basically anything on the menu with bier cheese, but the hot brown is a potato pancake with smoked turkey, ham and bacon on top, drizzled with bier cheese. What's not to love? And I'm not a beer drinker, but I love the hefe weizen. It's a light, sweet beer, and the only beer I'll drink."}
{"text":"Well-known for its beer, Hofbrauhaus was originated in Munich, Germany more than four centuries ago. Today, it's considered the world's most famous beer hall. Lucky for me, I don't have to go all the way to Germany... with only seven hours drive from NYC, I was able to experience the traditional Hofbrauhaus food and beer in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.   Hofbrauhaus indoor dining room features traditional decors with nightly live entertainment, whereas outdoor dining area provides fresh breeze and relaxing water view.  Must-try includes world famous freshly brewed biers (of course), Oktoberfest schweinshaxe, braised classic pork shank and potato pancake. Good eats and hearty meals! Can't wait to come here for Oktoberfest!"}
{"text":"Slightly above average beer and slightly below average food. This place is more of an \"experience\" than just a place for food and drinks if you sit in the main hall. There will be people doing shots, a guy singing/playing the accordion, people getting up on the tables, etc. Next time I go back, I will consider sitting in one of the quieter areas or outside depending on my mood."}
{"text":"Ahhh German food. This place is the pub to be at if you're visiting Pittsburgh! On top of their phenomenal  selection of beer (and mug size) they make German food delectable! The haus is very welcoming, very authentic, and loads of fun. I definitely recommend the oktoberfest beer and any of their Schnitzel! Heck you might as well just join in the fun during the month of October! All of the appetizers they offer are quite tasty and fun to share. Group seating at the long wooden benches and tables with the occasional German toast that the whole place shouts together makes this one of my favorite places to go when I'm visiting Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Three stars for a pretty good lunch at this restaurant. Decent service, decent atmosphere, no wait time for a group, decent price for a lunch buffet. Pretty good food. I would recommend it.   I imagine that if I came on a weekend for dinner and drinks that my enthusiasm would be greater! Overall, a good place to visit."}
{"text":"I was here Saturday for the first time . I have heard nothing but great things about this place so I had to try it out even though I am no huge fan of German food . The restaurant is huge with two big outdoor seating areas . I was  impressed with the fast friendly service . A great place for a large group . The food was very good as well ."}
{"text":"I was apprehensive about how I thought our night would go.  We came for a 21st birthday dinner at 5:30, and didn't get seated til 7pm.  They do not take reservations and even though my husband called and talked to a manager who said they'd do their best to accommodate us, no one passed the word onto the evening manager, so our group of 21 sat waiting for 2 tables.  Once that was done, we all had a great time.  The waitress was sympathetic to our older folks sitting right in front of the 'band' and didn't mind repeating things two and three times to our group.  We got our beers / drinks quickly and really enjoyed the loud, chaotic atmosphere.  There were mostly families and large groups when we were there, I assume the crowd changes drastically after 9pm.  The food was good - no problem substituting spaetzle for potato salad (I find their kartoffel salat a bit too sweet).  I had the Jagerschnitzel which I thought was pretty good.  The potato pancakes were a little over-fried (according to some of our guests at the table).  I've had the wurst platters and they are pretty good.  All in all, if you're up for a loud, adventurous night and meeting total strangers, you'll enjoy the Hofbrauhaus.  We did a lot of singing, shot-skis and just had an all around fun time."}
{"text":"Wow, wow, wow! This place was SO good. I've known Hofbrauhaus for their beer but not for the food. Also, I'd never had German food before this. Although I'm sure authentic German food is best eaten in the homeland, this was a great preface to it! The atmosphere of the restaurant was great. At the Pittsburgh location, be sure to sit outside when the weather permits it. There's nothing like a nice breeze and view of the river. If you sit inside, you'll be sitting family style. When I was there, there was a piano playing on the stage where we witnessed the entire restaurant burst into singing \"Sweet Caroline.\"  The schnitzel was moist and full of flavor. I don't really like cabbage, but the side was really delicious and flavorful! Get the pretzel and bier cheese for an appetizer! You won't regret it.   There's street parking throughout the shopping area, as well as a parking garage. However, if you're planning on indulging a bit, Lyft/Uber is a must.   Fan of good German bier? Drop by!"}
{"text":"This place next to our stays and we decided to give it a try. The foods were pretty awesome!! They have plenty of outdoors sitting. Perfect spot for family group or kids since they have separate quieter dining areas. Def recommend it for people around the river areas."}
{"text":"I can only give the Hofbrauhaus 3 stars and that's a shame considering that it was a nice place with good food and a great atmosphere.  They lost 2 stars for their waitstaff.  We had no idea what we should be doing when we first went in because no one was at the host/hostess stand.  We walked into the bar area and sat down and were ignored by everyone staff member walking by.  I finally asked a waitress if we could get service. She said no, because we weren't officially seated. What?  Are you kidding me???  We got up and went to the host stand and the guy there was an idiot.  He said we can't just seat ourselves, as if that's what we wanted to do or something!  I just wanted someone to pay attention to us. Well guess what?  He sat us in the exact same room as where we originally sat, but in a different spot not far from the original table.  Now does this make sense??  The food was OK, but there's not much enjoyment you can get from the food when you've been aggravated for 20 minutes just to get seated in a fairly empty restaurant.  That's too bad."}
{"text":"Great beer  and food but cheesy set up... However very nice back patio... Overall a nice place!"}
{"text":"Hofbrauhaus is the sort of place I would insist upon taking a Pittsburgh visitor or newcomer to, as it so perfectly encapsulates all that is good and bad about Pittsburgh dining/diners. The joint: a chain, though one that's certainly hard to one by. The fare: gut busting German, slathered in sauces and heavy on the meats. The beer: delicious, and served by the liter. The patrons: loud, and numerous, especially on the weekends at dinnertime and beyond. I always enjoy coming here, though we don't come here that often. Compared to the rest of the chain joints in this part of the South Side, I'd definitely call this one first choice--even if it's just for the people watching and a heavyweight Dunkel."}
{"text":"4.5 stars...  This is the sort of place you come for an experience.  With tall ceilings, long communal tables, and lots of warm wood work, this place feels like our imagined Bavaria. The live music simply added to the atmosphere.  The food was priced on the high end, but I don't think I've ever been to a German restaurant that wasn't. My coworker and I split a giant pretzel which was soft and warm, served with amazing cheese sauce and mustard. I ordered the Jaeger schnitzel and it did not disappoint. It was tender with a crisp, thin crust and the sauce was delicious. It was served with roasted cabbage and German potato salad. While I really enjoyed the cabbage, I wish I would have requested spaetzle instead of the potato salad.  The server was average. She answered our questions and took care of our basic needs, but seemed to be in a bad mood although she never directed it to us. I might be cranky too if I had to wear a German beer maid dress all night at work. Hah.  Go here if you want a fun dining experience!"}
{"text":"Saturday's the tops  Drink a friend, dance with a beer  OANS ZWOA DREI! G'SUFFA!"}
{"text":"Hell yeah loved this place, came here right around Oktoberfest had a liter of beer Farva styel, did a little Ziggy Zaki, and had a great time. The grounds are very spacious and green. Lots of picnic style tables inside and out side. Definitely my new place to go to when I'm in the Burg.  Oh yeah and amazing beer."}
{"text":"The overal experience is great! The place is loud and looks like a huge cafertia! Really interesting expeirence.  The portions are huge! Alcohol portions are huge...you can get samplers if you want for a smaller portion.  They have live band! And you see some crazy things :)  Also, they have alot of sourkraut and sausages!"}
{"text":"This is the place you take your mom when she wants to drink.   Overall, Haufbrauhaus is an excellent night out on the South Side of Pittsburgh. This is typically where I pick when my friends want to get slizered on the South Side and I can't avoid it.   The beer is good the food is decent and the atmosphere is excellente.   Food The food is a bit overprice but the atmosphere covers for the extra dollars. I can't enter the door without ordering the standard pretzels and bier cheese.  The beer is also exactly what you're expecting. They'll let you try whatever you want but if you're going hug, get the big cup. Never disappoints and you look like a bad ass.   The Staff Staff is typically friendly and glad you came  The Ambience The ambience is really what makes this place. You can dance on the tables and chairs to the house band, and all are encourages! The young and old, no discrimination - everyone gets blasted and gets an uber home."}
{"text":"I have been to the original Hofbräuhaus in Munich several times and always enjoyed myself there. When I saw that Pittsburgh had a Hofbräuhaus, I had to give it a try.   I thought the decor and ambience was a fairly close replica of the original, though the Munich Hofbräuhaus has a full band, not just an accordion player, and is much more crowded and lively.   They serve beer by the liter or half liter just as in Germany, and the quality of the beer seemed to be the same as what you find in Germany. Many of the same menu items you see in Germany are in the menu, but there are also some American additions, or at least menu items I don't remember seeing on the menu in Munich when I was there. I had one of these, the chicken bourbon sandwich, which I really enjoyed. It had a sweet bourbon sauce and was tender and tasty.   I think they did a real good job at creating a restaurant that gives you as closely as possible a similar experience to what you would get in Germany."}
{"text":"So my review of the food may or may not really be accurate, considering that I'm a huge lightweight when it comes to beer. I had one stein's worth and... at that point everything tastes delicious to me.  I was visiting a friend who goes to school in Grove City and she said that the Hofbrauhaus was a must-visit place in Pittsburgh. My other friend and I got off the airplane from NYC at 9PM and the three of us headed straight for this place for some dinner and beer.  We went just when Storm Khan was rushing through, though I guess Pittsburgh was relatively safe. The parking was pretty far and the walk kind of sucked. What sucked more was by the time we got there and were pulling out our IDs, my friend from NY realized she didn't have her ID on her, so we had to walk back to the car. The bouncer laughed at us and led us in.  Oh jeez, I have never been to a crazier beer garden. People were screaming along to songs on the top of their lungs, dancing on benches and swinging their steins. We were really hungry, so we opted to sit in a booth so that we could also talk. Basically, whenever the band paused, we would squeeze as much conversation as we could before being overwhelmed by sound again. It seemed like everyone was having a great time. The general ambiance was really impressive!  The food and beers were great! We ordered the Hofbrauhaus Pretzels for our appetizers, and the three of us got the Jaegerschnitzel (me), the pork loin special, and Hofbrauhaus Wurstplatte. The Jaegershnitzel was DELICIOUS. Omg, it was like honestly the best breaded pork cutlet I have eaten in my life. It was very soft on the inside, yet the skin was crunchy and flavorful. The portions were pretty big too. The German potato salad was interesting (more like scalloped potatoes) and the pickled cabbage was delectable, even though I am not a fan of anything pickled. My friend's pork loin was tender and juicy. I'm always scared of pork loins because usually they get too dried out, but this one was good, along with the mashed potatoes! The Wurstplatte was interesting. There were three different types of sausages, which I do not remember what they are called. I like the white one the best because it was so soft, almost like a fish sausage. It wasn't sharp and salty like normal sausages.  The pretzels were very salty (waaaay too much rock pieces on them) and the cheese was salty as well, but I don't like pretzels in general so I didn't dock any points off since I have a bias against them anyway. I ordered a stein of the Hofbrau Premium Lager, which was light and delicious. I think I got tipsy so quickly because I hadn't eaten anything else that whole day to prepare myself for this place. My Pitt friend ordered the Hofbrau Weizen, which was a bit too banana-y for my tastes, though the other two insisted that it was the best beer they had ever had. It was good, but not my favorite.  In general this place is a great experience. If you like rowdy crowds, friendly waiters, and great German food, this place is for you!"}
{"text":"This is no more an authentic beer hall than the Tiki Lounge is an authentic Polynesian hut.  But the inside atmosphere is fun and energetic, with people dancing on tables as the band plays polkaized versions of Neil Diamond songs.  It is very very loud, with open seating after 9pm on weekends, so don't expect to have any conversations.  The outside is more chill and is a nice spot to sit along the river.  That said, the two stars are strictly for atmosphere only.  After 30 minutes of sitting outside went by with no one taking our orders, we had to chase down a waitress.  The beers are not-so-good.  The wheat is the only decent beer in the lot.  Instead of beers, I'd order a shotski--four shot glasses attached to a ski so all drinkers are forced to take shots in unison...Any shot you can imagine.  As far as the food goes, if you're not getting a pretzel, you'll be disappointed.  That's the only great item on the menu.  The sauerkraut is just awful.    The doormen here take their jobs too seriously.  I was startled by two of them yelling \"thief\" at me after I walked out with my group of co-workers.  Everyone around stopped to stare.  After the doormen said people had been stealing glasses, I showed them my left-overs from dinner were the bugle in my handbag.  The funny part is that I was stone-sober and didn't even order a drink there, so had no glass to steal.  I would have been willing to forgive and forget, but I never got an apology.  So I docked a star for poor service."}
{"text":"2 Words:  Awesome Beer.  It had to be the best place in town to watch the Olympics that night.  The atmosphere was superb.  Everyone was singing along with the band while standing on there chairs (with beer in hand).  This experience has added Hofbrauhaus to my list of places to visit when I go to Munich."}
{"text":"It's the atmosphere that gets you.  The first few times you get caught up in the hype.  Once that dies off, you realize that you are just left with mediocre food and beer.  It can be a lot fun though with the right mix of people."}
{"text":"Came to Pittsburgh for a meeting this week and had dinner and beers at the Hofbrauhaus.  Great beers, loved the German stein option, the food was really good, the long tables and bier haus is fun.  Everyone at in my group seemed to enjoy their food and beer.  We had a pretzel appetizer, it was good and so was the cheese, not sure the pretzels where homemade or store bought but they went well with the beers.  For me the best part was the atmosphere.  They had a guy playing the accordion and later a stand-up bass player.  Folks where bringing up birthday and anniversary dedications and the player jumped right in with a celebratory sing-along.  The crowd seemed to know what to do and most participated in the sing-along.  We felt real comfortable and it seemed to be full of a mixed crowd of families from seniors to the kids.  We had fun."}
{"text":"awesome place. came here on saturday for lunch and sat on the outdoor covered porch. you have a view of the river, you are outside but shaded from the sun, what more could you ask for?   i had a few random sides....potato pancake and spaetzle with beer cheese. DH had pork medallions with sauerkraut and mashed potato. all were amazing!!! DH had a beer flight and absolutely loved the maibock. he raved about it all afternoon.   servers were friendly. indoors in the beer hall they had live music of traditional oktoberfest tunes.  highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"If you've never been to Hofbrauhaus, you need to go at least once! It's a good place to start the night if you're planning to hit up South Side. They allow you do stand and dance on the benches to the accordion clad band.  The beer garden outside is nice during the summer if you want to talk with friends and escape the noisy band. The beer is brewed in house... not a big beer fan, but I do like to have one while I'm here.  The mixed drinks were blah. The crowd ranges from 21 to 60's.  Mostly people dressed preppy... read guys wearing pink polos.  For dinner, I was only impressed with 1 time out of 5 times trying it. The schnitzel was the best! German potato salad also was good. The pretzels with beir cheese are overpriced, but good if you're in the mood for that kinda thing. Overall, I'm sure I'll be back, but it's not at the top of my list."}
{"text":"I was here for work, staying right next door at the Hyatt, so on a wintery snowy evening it was the most convenient place to try. First strike against was a bit of chaos in the front, with hopeful diners started to pile up with no greeters. However, once we were seated, the fun began. We had live entertainment with an accordionist deluged with announcing birthday after birthday throughout the evening...apparently this is a popular birthday spot! Nice big place that managed to feel cozy at the same time.  Second strike was by not even 7pm, their most popular pork dish was already sold out! So I had the ribeye instead. It came out medium well instead of medium rare as I ordered it, but it didn't stop me from devouring it. It was delicious as was the food in general (we had the soft pretzel appetizer that hit the spot, too).  I haven't been to a real German Oktoberfest, but with the outfits the servers (all female, it seemed) wore, it was kinda like a Teutonic Hooters!"}
{"text":"Always like coming here every change I get when I'm in a town that has one! great beer, if you happen to come in May, their Maibock is killer...and in the fall their Oktoberfest is great. If you can come to one of their keg tapping nights, those are fun. Food is also really good, a bit heavy, but it's delicious. Will keep coming back every time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Hofbrauhaus is a good place to hang out. Apparently, there are several locations throughout the States, but there ain't one in MD, so I had to check it out. A huge restaurant/pub with plenty of seatings and good atmosohere, and they have their own beer brewing machineries, so their beer tastes extra refreshing. Well, for my food, I ordered the pierogies, and it was okay but didn't really impress me. In fact, it was greasy for me. The dish came with pierogies, cabbages, frizzled onions, and sour cream. Like I already said, Hofbrauhaus will be a good place to hang out with your friends and drink some beer with buffalo wings or something but not a place to go if you are craving a delicious meal."}
{"text":"I usually don't go to bigger restaurants but this place was very calm on a Wednesday lunch hour. I ordered sauerkraut balls with a side of sweet honey mustard, which were piping hot, crunchy and yes, super tangy. The lunch buffet for $11.99 was offered numerous times so I went for it. Schnitzel, soup, salad, brats sauerkraut, mash, and rolls and a few other dishes were the selection. First time I went up, hot and fresh. Second time I went up, food was cold thus the four stars. I got a pecan pie ala mode which was thin, smashed and cold and $6.99! The other reason for four stars. I will be back but will avoid the buffet and overrated and overpriced pie."}
{"text":"Some may claim heresy, but I for one am a huge fan of the new Hofbrahaus.  As much as I liked to go and have as many liters of beer and shotski's as my body pleased back in the day, Hofbra became such a party destination recently that the mood had transitioned from a community feeling of fun to a drunk titanic weighting down the South Side.  With the new ID requirements, drink limits, and elimination of a few of the drinking rituals of past, you can actually go to Hofbra on a Friday or Saturday night to relax and have a genuinely good time.  The beer is, as always, historic to the traditional ways of German brewing.  No crazy variations or additions here...  Water, Malt, Hops, and Yeast.  Done.  For those looking for more adventurous craft offerings, you'll likely disappointed.  However, if you have a true appreciation for German offerings, Hofbra is a great asset to the city in that regard.  The food overall is decent.  Nothing to write home about, but the pretzels and beer cheese make a fantastic drinking companion.  Overall, Hofbra continues to be a great destination for locals and out of towners alike (still one of only three or four in the country I believe!)."}
{"text":"Pretzels & bier cheese + potato pancakes! Yum. The other things I have tried, including the sauerkraut balls, fried pickles, sample platter of wursts and schnitzel were just okay.  I won't be back anytime soon, mainly because I prefer more intimate dining settings. I came here on a double date and we were yelling across the table because it was so loud. I guess that's part of the experience."}
{"text":"they do a good job with the decor and the ambiance. the food and the beer were hit or miss. I did not try all the beer varieties, but the dunkel is ho-hum. Several of the guests reported the saur kraut, a Geman staple, was not good. Everything also seemed to have an abundance of salt, but that's common for restaurants. It is a good place for birthdays and is generally a fun atmosphere. Parking is not so easy."}
{"text":"We love hofbrauhaus and came for a birthday celebration for my fiancé. We came on a Saturday night during their Oktoberfest. They were extremely busy so we went to the back area with outdoor seating and a second outdoor bar. It was packed! We waited about 15 minutes to finally find a group getting up so we could have their table. Service was a little slow but understandable since it was so busy at the tables. We were extremely upset with the outdoor bar. We waited about 15 minutes to get to the front to order our drinks. Once finally getting seats at the very front, no one helped us for atleast another 15 minutes. We were very disappointed by this, it was a little ridiculous. They were only helping people on the left and right side and completely ignoring the middle of the bar. Food and beer were good. There was a snake in the outdoor area that needed removed by a patron!"}
{"text":"It's Like Epcot Center in Pittsburgh, but with Better Food  Yes, this is actually a German beer house here in Pittsburgh at the South Side Works.    The Brau Haus and the neighboring Cheesecake Factory compete for the title of gaudiest architectural monstrosity on the South Side.  It looks like a little beer house plunked down next to the Mon.  When you arrive, you have two choices:  The quiet (read:normal) dining room, and the big beer hall.  We opted for the latter, and were glad we did.  In the big room, your sat next to strangers at big, heavy eight-seater tables.  On one side of the hall, performers in leiderhosen (yes, leiderhosen) play accordions and sing German drinking songs for your enjoyment.  Every so often, the performers call a toast, and everyone in the hall raises a glass and half-sings some German toast song.  It was actually pretty cool, and not that different from Oktoberfest in Munich (or what I remember of it anyway.)  My partner and I split a combination plate ($30), which was more food than either of us could even think of finishing.  It consisted of 2 pork chops, 3 sausages, 3 pork cutlets, mashed potatoes and two kinds of sauerkraut.  The combination plate was a good way to sample some exotic fare without really committing to anything.  We only wished it came with less sauerkraut and more green leafy veggies.  We didn't even come close to finishing the dish, but I still left feeling ten pounds heavier.  There's a reason Germans are so um.... zaftig.  Other (non adventurous) customers near us ordered salads and burgers.  They looked pretty good too, actually.  So you can bring unadventurous/picky eater members of your family to the brau house without fear.    Good luck spelling this place in Web searches.  (Key Words: Brau Haus Hoff BrauHaus)"}
{"text":"The location is great by the riverside. Plenty of space is provided in the restaurant, on the patio, and along the river. Live music is ongoing from time to time. Waitresses dress up traditional German costumes, which is very unique. The food is delicious with reasonable price. You must try sausage sampler, pork shank and brewery beer."}
{"text":"It's a great place for a lot of college kids to come on Thursday night. But their food is OK. Their beer is good price with a lot of beer if you are a heavy drinker. Their beer cheese pretzel is decent."}
{"text":"When family or friends come to visit, they often want to come here because of the fun atmosphere and delicious beer. I'm not a huge beer drinker, but I could easily drink a liter of Heffeweisen here. With its smooth finish and perfect hint of banana, I would highly recommend it.  I love starting with the beer cheese and pretzels. I could eat their beer cheese on a absolutely anything. The pretzels are perfectly salty, and the beer cheese is creamy with just a hint of tartness. The fried pickles are also a delicious starter.  For entrées, I love the bauern sandwich. It comes on a pretzel bun and is smothered with beer cheese. The beer cheese chicken is also delectable, as are the schnitzel options and buttered spaetzle.  If you are looking for a loud ambience, sit in the main dining room and experience live music as well as people dancing on the tables. If you are looking for something a bit low key, sit outside in the heated patio area. When the weather is nice, it's fun to experience the beer garden where you seat yourself and enjoy the beautiful view of the river.  If you still have room left, the apple strudel is really delicious. If you're looking for a fun place to try with friends, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great authentically German-style beers, great nourishing stick to your ribs old-world comfort food and a lunch buffet Mon-Fri  11-2  $12.99(price increases a dollar every year it seems like). Love the outdoor biergarten during warm weather months. Prosit ."}
{"text":"This place is a ton of fun.  I loved the huge beers, pretzels and overall lively environment.  I look forward to going again sometime when in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Spent the birthday night there! atmosphere is good. Ordered pork shank, sausage and salad. The pork shank is pretty good, remind me of the old days in Munich. Sausage is so so. Will be better if there were band playing on stage."}
{"text":"Awesome beer, great food, amazing location. What's not to like? Just one thing to improve would be the service. Not saying it wasn't good, but the servers could be a little attentive. They seem to wander around without looking at anyone and that makes it harder to flag them down."}
{"text":"I had lunch there today.  The pretzel sandwich was very good.  Very german atmosphere."}
{"text":"I've never had german food before so I have nothing with which to gauge my meal. However I will try to provide an accurate rundown.  We sat in the bier garden outside which has a wonderful view of the river. I'd never been to a bier garden before and it appeared to just be an outdoor area with picnic tables where you eat and drink. Excellent. I am a fan of outdoor dining.  They brew their own beer here and have several options they offer year round such as their premium beer, a light beer and a hefeweizen...they also have a seasonal beer each month.  The beers come in two sizes 1/2 Liter or 1 Liter.  We started off with the fries with bier cheese and bacon, which was so delicious!  For my meal I got the jager schnitzel which was basically a fried porkchop in gravy served with german potato salad and some veggies. After tasting the food here I see why the beers can afford to be so large. Everything was so dense, but I guess that's what german food is.  Overall this is a fun restaurant which seems like a place I would enjoy best just for some heavy appetizers and huge beers with some friends. So if your ever in the Pittsburgh area you should go! You'll have a good time."}
{"text":"Even if you don't like beer, just come here for the atmosphere.  Think of loud drunk people standing on tables singing along to all sorts of random songs.  A great time to be had.  Definitely not the type of place you'd want to eat a good meal though, or so I'm told."}
{"text":"The beer is decent, but I can honestly say you can get higher quality German food at an Autobahn gas station than this dump. How much to want to spend on mashed potatoes?  Do like groups of rowdy bros yelling in your ear? Do you like room temperature sausages? All represented here. This is a frat boys version of Germany."}
{"text":"Had a great experience here! Service was fast, polite, and professional. The facility was very clean. The food was very good, quite authentic actually. The pretzels were really good, pretty darn close to what they have in Munich. The beer cheese was great, as was the tender spatzle. The highlight, to our surprise, were the sauerkraut bites...perfectly fried and stuffed with kraut so well-simmered in pork stock that it tasted like a ham hock, delicious! Really great, give it a shot!"}
{"text":"this was my first real german restaurant and i thought it was pretty good. i went with the schnitzel and tried one of the house brews. good stuff!"}
{"text":"We went during lunch when there wasn't much fanfare, but our meal came out quickly and was very tasty. I got a vegetarian pasta and a giant pretzel, both were very good and I would absolutely go back."}
{"text":"Fun environment for all ages.   However, if you are taking your family, I would go earlier as I have seen it get a little more adult themed later in the evening.   Beer served up in large glasses, toasts, good food, and dancing on benches. It's hard to go wrong with that list."}
{"text":"Probably the best restaurant and bar in Pittsburgh. There is nothing else like it, everything is authentic German themed and the food as well as their beer is delicious. The atmosphere and live music makes for a fun and entertaining time."}
{"text":"Hofbrauhaus is a phenominal place to go when you have a group of people with you.  The prices are fair for the food which is Bavarian styled.  I sat in the beer hall when I was there.  Service and food were great.  This chain even brews their own beer on site and you can get it either in a liter or 1/2L.  Seasonal offerings are superb, even if some you can only get in 1/2L."}
{"text":"Cheers!  I love coming to the Hofbrauhaus  on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon.  Most especially when it is nice enough to enjoy the outdoor biergarten along with the views of the city and the river.  Maybe it's the German in me, or the beer in me, or the German beer in me?  Eh either way you put it, I'm down with it.  Now I haven't eaten here but on a few occasions.   The food is good enough.  No particular stars or duds that I can recall.  I love German food, but their version is much more Americanized.  It's okay though, since the South Side offers so much in the way of eateries I am happy to just come and spend a couple hours in the sun downing a liter of brew.     Our last visit here was great.    Perfect weather over the Labor Day weekend led to a great afternoon trying their September style Oktoberfest that is brewed in Munich.  I loved it.  Nice seasonal balance of flavors, served in a huge been stein, you just can't go wrong there.  When I do come here I tend to try their seasonal selection first, there are many that are very good.    Sometimes this place can get crazy, and if you aren't into that kind of atmosphere I recommend coming in the afternoons.   I would probably never come here in the evening again, though I have heard they cracked down on their tolerance of bozo drunken idiots.  This is always good to hear.  Bottoms up!"}
{"text":"Always have to stop by HB house when I am in the area! I love this place! Great beer selection, awesome outdoor seating, and GREAT FOOD!   My man and I usually share an appetizer and an entree as they have very generous portions. This time around, we ordered the sampler appetizer platter and the sausage sampler plate. Of the items on the sampler appetizer platter, I only really liked the potato pancake and the pretzel with the bier cheese dipping sauce! Be warned, all the appetizers are pretty much deep fried so it was too much friedness for me lol. The sampler came with - 2 pretezels, 2 potato pancakes, 4 deep fried pickle spears, and 4 deep fried sauerkraut balls. It's definitely good to share with 3 or more people.  I enjoyed the sausage sampler entree plate. All the sausages were delish and came with plenty of mashed potatoes and sauerkraut. Yum!  Great place to get your eat and drink on!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The schnitzel are delicious, pretzels and bier cheese were to die for! The flight of beers was only six dollars and was excellent! The service was decent, not amazing just a bit slow at times. I loved the live music and cannot wait to go back!! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I went to Hofbrauhaus on a Thursday night... There was a one man German \"band\" playing throughout the night who was fantastic!  He not only sang German drinking songs but he entertained us with dancing music and even Russian music.  There was a nice little dance floor in front of the stage where my friends and I danced the night away... of course we sat down for the meal.  We had the potato pancakes... which were much better than the potato pancakes at another German restaurant in Pittsburgh called Penn Brewery.  I also got schwinenbraten (excuse my poor spelling).  I substituted the sauerkraut for apple kraut... a very good decision.  And had a pretty good bread dumpling.    I went to Germany last summer and experienced my boyfriends' family's homemade German cooking... so nothing really compares to that.... but the food was pretty good... I'd say about a 3.5 or 4 depending on what you order.  But the experience made the night a 5 for sure!  I also recommend ordering a liter to really make the experience authentic... if you're not a fan of beer (such as me) order a radler.  It's typically half lemonade and half beer.. but this restaurant offers that choice or half sprite, half beer.  It's quite good and allows even the non-beer drinkers the chance to join in the beer song fun!  In conclusion, go to Hofbrauhaus.... go with a group (ideally 4 or more) you'll have a blast if you're not afraid to join in the singing and dancing."}
{"text":"It turns out I didn't need my 1 year of German to enjoy my evening here.   While I've never been to Germany (does a layover in Munich count) or a beer garden, I'm always looking for new places to try out when I'm in Pittsburgh.  My friend promised me that there would be lots of beer and boys, and that was all I needed to go.    We arrived on a Friday evening sometime after 9 and it was jam packed with people of all ages toting mugs of beer that were in some cases larger than their heads.  The only food we snacked on was the pretzels and beer cheese dip, which was really good.  Beer, not sure if it was locally brewed or imported, well it was fine but nothing to write home.  The band seemed to take a lot of breaks, but they were entertaining when they were performing.  Smart space.  I'm glad that restaurants are finally wising up and taking advantage of the terrific river front and opening up spaces for outdoor seating, which can be enjoyed a fair portion of the year.   I hope for the massive size of the place that the owners will find ways to prolong the novelty and that it stays open for a long time.  I agree with other reviews that it's best enjoyed with a large group of friends.  Probably not likely that I would return on a future trip.  I'm not sure if its the women scantily clad in Forever 21 dancing on the long wooden benches or the triple and quad shots of Jaeger served from a ski, but the experience didn't feel very authentic and it's not really my thing."}
{"text":"This place is a German-enthusiast dream come true.  It's a great escape from the typical restaurant scene with fun-loving music and all the lederhosen you can handle.  Situated right along the river on the South Side of Pittsburgh, the place offers a great beer hall indoors, patio seating outside, and a lovely bier garden below - each perfect for any group or family looking to enjoy a fun night out.  It's pretty good eats, if you like German-style food, with some darn good beer to wash it all down.  If you're looking for a \"different than the norm\" dining experience in a spirited atmosphere with plenty of beer - this is the place.  As the Germans say...Prost!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Came with a group after 9:30 on a Sunday night (kitchen closes at 9). Since the kitchen was closed, food/drink choices were limited to beer and pub snacks (nachos, chili, and pretzels with various sauces). We ended up getting a round of beers along with all three snacks. The place is definitely very big, which makes it great for groups! I would also say that it was towards the end of the night towards closing so there weren't as many people, although I can only imagine how busy it normally gets during peak afternoon/dinner time. There are a variety of beers that one can get, including the drink specials (one every month), ranging from light to dark beers (stout-like even). Overall, I had a great time eating here. The snacks were all delicious, although I would say that I especially enjoyed the sauce layered on the nachos, which made it quite tempting to pick at again and again. Great place to chill with a group of friends. Will try to come here the next time during normal hours to sample some of their entree/appetizer choices."}
{"text":"Although this is a chain restaurant, which my husband and I try to side step in favor of local spots, I can't say a bad word about the Hoffbrahaus. I'm a consistent fan of the \"Radler\" which is a customizable shandy, half hefeweizen and half lemonade mixed in house. You can also try a darker version with a dark brew and rootbeer.  I've sampled many of their offerings but I've found my niche with the sauerkraut balls as an appetizer (dip them in the honey mustard - wow!) and the comforting, creamy and delicious Rahm spätzle.  The atmosphere is always lovely and entertaining, great place to drink, eat and sing the night away!"}
{"text":"Almost like the one in Munich. Really good food and ok service. Drinking outside by the water is very fun on a warm evening."}
{"text":"If you can't make it to Oktoberfest than the Hofbrauhaus will make you feel as if you are there or bring back memories. Das schnitzel war sehr gut und die hefe weizen war noch besser. The music was non-stop and everyone was having a great . The location is right on the river so you have a choice of sitting in either inside or outside. You can sit outside if you don't want to shout to have a conversation.   The food came quickly, but you can still enjoy some serious pretzels and cheese before your meal arrives. They don't close until 2am so there is plenty of time to pace yourself and enjoy the best beer the world has ever known. So whether a 1/2 liter or a full stein have a good time with some good food with family and friends."}
{"text":"I. Love. Hofbrahaus.   Some of the best German food around - I dont care if its from a world-wide chain - it is DELISH. The bier cheese is amazing, pretzels, schnitzels, potato salad, sausages, sour kraut and of course the beer selection. I love it all. Food is always hot and well seasoned and I have always had good service here - despite the obvious fact that this place can really get crowded and extremely busy. The only reason I am giving 4 of 5 stars is due to it being very overly loud at times if you happen to be there during evening hours (some people like to start the party early, even if you are not sitting in the party hall)."}
{"text":"I left Pittsburgh in 2009, and almost every time I come back for a visit, I find myself at Hofbrauhaus. It brings to Pittsburgh that wonderful German experience, from the delicious German sausages to the huge mugs of beer to dancing on the tables. It can be loud and rowdy, but such is the environment of a German beer house, and there are outside tables for those seeking a quieter night.   Hofbrauhaus is located at the South Side neighborhood of Pittsburgh, and the overall area is nice and clean. At the outside tables, you can kick back and enjoy your 1 liter mug while gazing lazily down the river. I would highly recommend, well, everything, but my personal favorite is the liter of Hefe Weizen. One can order the half liter, the 'little beer' as we say, but one should also be aware that such can lead to a night of ridicule and taunts.  Little beer or not, the experience is a must-try, and at the very least, Hofbrauhaus gives you great food and great beer. Have a DD ready, since one can end up drinking quite a lot here. Indeed."}
{"text":"Visited 3/30/14. Had a great time. Service great Place was packed. Food was fantastic. Only disappointment was the band dressed Up in their traditional outfits playing everything But classic German hofbrauhaus music Band played to the College crowd that filled The room. More country western then anything Else. Guess the owners know they will fill The room. Would have been a 5 star except For the music"}
{"text":"Good beer, good food, good times!  It's always a fun place to take out of town guests for a night out in the city.  The beer garden is a nice spot to have a drink outside in the warmer months and arrive early if you want a spot by the band to dance on the tables."}
{"text":"This was actually our first stop in Pittsburgh, so I guess I should have reviewed this first! Oops!   My friend tells me that Hofbrauhaus is ALWAYS a staple for him to take his out-of-town visitors. The first things that you'll notice even before you enter the building are the beer silos. Yup, they brew their own beers, which makes it cheap for you and me! The next thing you'll notice are.. the bewbs. The ladies who work here don't wear a complete skimpy outfit like they do at Hooters or Tilted Kilt, etc. but they do show off their top heavy bosoms. Very nice. ;)  We came around 8 and my friend immediately requested that we sat inside when we were asked. Why? Wait till around 9PM and you'll see. Okay, impatient? I'll tell yinz (yes, I did pick up on some of their slang)! Around 9 or maybe 9:30, the Haus Band comes on and plays every type of song under the sun, ranging from The Lion sleeps Tonight to Call Me Maybe. Surprisingly, there was a good bit of country music thrown in the mix. Everything was well received by the audience, who seemed to know every word of every song they played. When you throw together people who know how to have a good time, plus a flow of cheap beer, plus a very good band who knows how to play just about every song you can think of and seems to get better the more they drink, what do you get? Everyone dancing their butts off on top of their benches. It is quite a site to see and an experience you must have in life. My friend did give us a disclaimer that if we wanted to talk about anything that evening, to get it out right away because we won't get an opportunity to later. He was right! Lol.  As if all of that wasn't entertaining enough, there's this REALLY old guy who makes an appearance almost every night. He comes out a little bit after the band does and dances with every pretty lady in the building. Some of his risque moves though.. yeah, he gets away with it because he's an old guy haha. Let me tell ya, he's a hoot and a half! I've got some interesting photos and videos to prove it.  So, aside from the bustling festivities, I thought the food was just okay but the beau and friends all loved what they got. Definitely opt for their in-house brewed beers and pay a little extra to keep a [brand new, never used] souvenir pint glass to take home.  We were stuffed and tired from all the singing and dancing, but my friend took us outside behind the pub and showed us the beer garden, which was very peaceful and romantic (surprisingly). It has a fantastic view of the river and looks even more amazing with the reflection of the city lights bouncing off from it. If you're wanting to grab some authentic German grub, but are not in the mood to burn off all those calories just yet, opt to sit outside."}
{"text":"This may be one of my favorite places of all time haha. Seriously, you couldn't have something like this in southern California, people wouldn't be able to handle it. I'm glad its in pittsburgh.  The yelp description calls this place a pub when its more of a beer compound. Big beers, food, music, long communal tables, and a view of the river.  This is a great place to start off the night with a big group of friends. next time i cruise to pittsburgh I'm definitely stumbling by again."}
{"text":"Service has been getting spotty even when business is slow, food has been slowly going down hill as well. The last time we went and had dinner,we were served instant mashed potatoes(no kidding)"}
{"text":"I have really really enjoyed every time I've been here! I've only come for college night, which is Thursdays at 9pm until 11pm with a live band that plays cover songs. I've been here once for dinner, and was very very impressed. Their bier cheese and pretzels are to diiiiiie for and their half rack of baby ribs was amazing!"}
{"text":"I had high expectations for the hofbrauhaus after reading good reviews on Yelp, but I wasn't impressed with the sampler appetizers. The pretzels were very ordinary pretzels you can find in the freezer aisle. The \"meatloaf\" was bologna slices. The biercheese wasn't much more than nacho cheese. The beer was great though.   The atmosphere on a Wednesday night was very quiet and uneventful. But the place looks like it could be really fun during the weekend when there are more people."}
{"text":"Food is ok. Definitely not worth the money we paid. The beer is pretty good. My family is from Germany so I guess I just had high expectations for this place and they were not met. Probably won't make a second trip."}
{"text":"I came here as a suggestion from a local friend. This place didn't disappoint. Service was great, a ton of seating means little to no wait. The environment was great with a feel of a true German beer hall with live music. I had the appetizer sampler and wurstplate, which both were amazing. I ordered a beer sample flight, which complimented the German food very well. My favorite was the kraut, absolutely the most authentic."}
{"text":"The food isn't great. The beer is okay. The atmosphere is a great time, especially in the summer on the patio. It's a \"visit once in a while when it's convenient\" type of place. Have had great experiences with large groups on the outside patio area. But the beer and food isn't awesome."}
{"text":"I came here last night for a private party.  Because this wasn't the standard setup, there wasn't table service--rather, food was served in a buffet line and drinks were served at the bar.  Most of the available food was fried (not sure if this is the case for the regular menu).  I tried the pretzels with bier cheese, fried sauerkraut balls, fried pickles, and fried chicken nugget things (they probably have an actual name, but I don't know what it is).  The first thing I noticed was how extremely salty all of the food was.  This was particularly true of the pretzels, and the source was the bier cheese, surprisingly.  Indeed, it became so overwhelmingly salty that by my second pretzel, I started using the Gulden's mustard at the table to cut it, which helped tremendously.  Quite frankly, due to this problem, I was disappointed in the pretzels and cheese, which I'd heard was HBH's signature appetizer.  My favorite of the foods that I tried was the sauerkraut balls, which were still salty, but at least had some tanginess due to the vinegar.  The chicken and pickles were pretty nondescript.  There was also apple strudel for dessert, which was okay, but not great.  Not surprisingly, I was thirsty after eating all of the extremely salty food, so I ordered a cherry cosmopolitan to wash it down.  I did really enjoy this drink, which was quite delicious and refreshing after all the salt I'd just ingested.  While I'm aware that most people come to HBH for the beer, I'm not a beer drinker, so I was a bit concerned that only beer would be available for drinks.  However, I was pleasantly surprised by the breadth of the drink menu, which included several cocktails, shots, and wines in addition to the beer.  As others have commented, aside from the beer, the ambiance is what really defines HBH.  There was live music playing most of the time I was there, which consisted of a (strange) mix of traditional German songs and covers of '80's music.  Many of the attendees got into singing the covers and did the whole standing on the bench thing, which was fun.  Because of this, it was quite loud in the beer hall most of the time, but I was able to escape this when I tired of it by going out to the balcony, which has a nice view of the river.  Like Mad Mex, HBH is a theme restaurant that people come to to have a rowdy good time with the help of some liquid libation.  However, also like Mad Mex, the quality of the food leaves something to be desired, so don't go there expecting a great meal.  I'm glad I experienced it once, but I wouldn't go out of my way to return unless a group of my friends wanted to come."}
{"text":"If your looking for German food and entertainment there is no better place!  The menu is all German food, desserts and beer!  The place is HUGE! There is a beer hall and bar where people stand on their seats and sing while eating, there is a beautiful porch and below is an outdoor beer garden with lights, there is also a quiet beer hall.  There is a souvenir room and they have a rent your own stein so that you can come back and have a stein with your name ready for you to drink with!  I ordered the potato pancakes with sour cream and apple sauce, it was good! And I got a Bavarian cream puff!  The servers were all attentive even though they were packed!   A must see!"}
{"text":"I have almost never turned down a trip to the Hofbrauhaus.  Check that--I don't think I *ever* have.  I am a confirmed Germanophile, so there's that.  But, what I really like about going there is the atmosphere of gemütlichkeit (geniality, friendliness) that I have experienced myself in Germany.  It's fun sitting at bench seats with a dozen of your friends, drinking from glass steins the size of your forearm, singing \"Sweet Caroline\" for the seventh time, and I've never had a meal that I didn't like.  Hard to miss on good old fashioned meat and potatoes cooking, although it would be nice to see German style salads, which are completely underrated and amazing.  But, overall, it's a fun place whether you're indoors with the din of commotion or out on the more subdued patio, or the outdoor biergarten next to the river."}
{"text":"Way. Too. Loud.  But the jagerschitzel was on point. Our group left in pain after our meal from the accordion."}
{"text":"Great classic German foods, my dad said that the potato pancakes were comparable to the ones his German grandma used to make many years ago! Very fun on Thursdays when it's college night and they have $6 liters of beer. It's a great place"}
{"text":"Great beer, food is amazing. Order the pork shank you will love it. Tried the light lager and it went down so smooth. Great place to have a fun time with friends."}
{"text":"After some time @Church to reflect upon celestial gold... I awaken to my senses that I have not reached the Pitts drink/drive limit. Time for some Hofbrauhaus German Bier Hall Ziggy Zaggy[1].  I check out the line up ziggy zagging out the door.  I went back an hour later. ID check, really?  Guess I don't look drunk enough yet.  I'll do better next time. Everything that I imagine an Oktoberfest Bier Hall.  Great energy, capacity crowd. Loud music lively fun ATMOSPHERE within, airy calmer riverview patio space outside.  Good brews. Hofbräu Munich Weizen. Fun to see the Ski Shots take place. Cannot comment on the Food. Simply an exciting place to be with Friends.  -------------------- [1] That's naturally how I drive by the way"}
{"text":"this place rates a bit high on the bro-meter for my liking, but it can be fun with the right group of friends.  3 stars for doing a SHOT-SKI with my friend's mom."}
{"text":"A German beer garden is a German beer garden, huh?  Not if Monday is trivia night.  How fun!   Pierogies were eh, but sausage plate was good.  My date enjoyed beer in thick chilled glass.  Strudel with French vanilla ice cream hit the spot.  The beer hall has authentic German look and bar is very attractive.  Recommend."}
{"text":"Such a great spot to spend time with a big group. The food is amazing! I tried the pretzels, potato pancakes, pork knuckle, and spatzle. The beers are also delicious! I highly recommend this spot--it's a lot of fun!"}
{"text":"The Hofbrauhaus is a must stop for anyone visiting Pittsburgh. This German beer hall serves beer by the liter at a reasonable price.  The live entertainment in the beer hall makes any evening here fun with friends.  In my several visits here, I have sampled many items on the menu and haven't been disappointed yet!"}
{"text":"After a little more than a week in Ireland with my husband, it was good to get out on a Friday night with the girl posse.  We decided on dinner and a movie and we wanted to try some place we hadn't been to before.  Hofbrauhaus tries to replicate the 400 year old Hofbrauhaus in Munich.  Now since I'm 1/2 German, I thought this place would really appeal to me.  For an appetizer, we started on the pretzels with beer cheese.  I think that they are freshly baked, but they certainly are so delicious.  My main course was the Wursteller, which was Mettwurst, Bierwurst, and Bratwurst.  Piled high with sauerkraut (I love 'kraut.  Why-oh-why do I love stinky foods?), and mashed potatoes, it was so good.  They reportedly have great burgers here too.  No visit to a good German joint would be complete without dessert.  So we split two orders of Appel Strudel with vanilla and raspberry sauce.  I shared one with my friend Marla.  Sherry and Maryann split the other.  Like I always say, \"Pump that insulin, Susan, pump!\"  One thing, this place can get very busy, so it's best to go early like we did."}
{"text":"The facility is huge! The beer is good! The atmosphere is fun!  While the venue is large and the ambiance was enjoyable, the foodie in me would rate the quality somewhere in the realm of chain restaurants such as TGI Friday's or Applebee's.  If you're in the mood to visit the Southside and you haven't checked this location out, I think it's worth a visit. If you're in the mood for food that is guaranteed not to disappoint, I would keep on scrolling. There are plenty of 4 star worthy restaurants in the Southside sea!"}
{"text":"Occasion:  Dinner with colleagues   Atmosphere:  LOUD.  Very authentic I've visited the original in Munich and this place was strikingly similar.  Live music, festive patrons, traditional songs/toasts, etc.  The main difference was that there were separate tables.  Service:  A little slow, but friendly.    Food:  Mediocre, but I don't like German food so not the best judge.  Pretzels and cheese app was excellent.  For dinner I had a salad which was fine and pierogies which were too tough to cut with my fork.  Not good.  Would I return:  Not of my own choosing, but I didn't choose this time either."}
{"text":"This place is bananas. Giant beers? Check. Awesome food? Check. Good location? Check. Second visit, first review. The food is amazing. Schnitzel sandwich, Chicken Sandwich, Steak Salad, Cheese Fries - all hits at our table. Definitely give it a try. Not real expensive either."}
{"text":"Great beer, above average food, fun environment.   Noisy, crowded, not a place I would spend a lot of time at."}
{"text":"Long wait but once you get in it is an experience, the food is great and the beer is as authentic as you can get out of the alps"}
{"text":"Food is good but not an amazing selection.  Inside is very noisy, making conversation difficult, but the outdoor seating overlooking the river is spectacular."}
{"text":"There's definitely a solid beer selection here, and the food's not bad either. However, the atmosphere was a little bit off to me. Even though there's an obvious German beer hall layout and polka band, there was a tangible southern twang (random southern songs, for example) that seemed really out of place at the locale."}
{"text":"Low quality beer.  Tons of fruit flies.  Excessively slow service (with s negative attitude).  Fake German food poorly prepared.  Terrible in every way."}
{"text":"Hofbrauhaus has a great atmosphere. It's very down-to-earth so leave your pretensions at other (more appropriate) joints in Pgh.   But if you're in the mood, it's a great time whether you're standing on the tables belting out Sweet Caroline (for us Pitt fans, or Country Roads for the 'Eers) or doing a shot-ski or just sitting outside on the back area on a pleasant afternoon.  I honestly can't say that the food or the brew here is out of this world. But it ain't half bad either."}
{"text":"The food is good, the beer is better. Definitely a place to try for the ambiance. Recommend going on a tapping night. The place can get pretty packed."}
{"text":"Highly recommended from the locals to go for the experience.  I must say, I wasn't disappointed.  Great looking environment inside and even though I went on a slow Monday night in the middle of December, the place looked like it could be a lot of fun when it's busy."}
{"text":"The bartender was fabulous, I think her name was Alicia...friendly and very informative! She suggested beer and food with no hesitation. When visiting Pittsburgh you must hit this spot at least once it's a great experience."}
{"text":"Moved to Pitt 3 months ago and we've been here five times already. That should say it all. The atmosphere is worth it even if the food wasn't good...but it's delicious. It gets loud!  So maybe not the best for anyone who isn't looking for a bit of a party with their dinner but they have a quiet room or the outside patio. Don't be shy, join in on the fun and maybe take part in the stein holding competition! Get the pretzels, get a dunkel and learn the cheers."}
{"text":"This place is great. The food is fantastic, yum yum yumz.  The beer is also great, I got wasted with my grandma and my parents. Doesn't get much better than that. This is a place that people of any age can have a good time because it's such a drunk shit show.  Only downside is how crowded it tends to get. I had a friend that worked here and managed to get us a seat after like 20 minutes but for the most part people were waiting for at least an hour for a table.  Do it!"}
{"text":"Whew. Wow. So, lemme get right to it.  I went to college in Pittsburgh but moved away from the city in 2010. When this place opened, it was THE PLACE to go on a Friday or Saturday night. The music, the big tables, the big beers, the bier cheese pretzels....  Flash forward to last month when I was back in town for a college friend's wedding. My boyfriend and I came here on a Thursday night with two other friends. The weather was nice, and we opted to eat outside. The place was already pretty crowded, and it was only about 5:00 or 6:00pm. I'm not big on German food, and I ate here a couple times in college, but I had never gotten the ham and cheese sandwich on a pretzel bun, which is what I got this time. Wow! What a great sandwich!!!  My meal was really good. The boys ordered a little too much food for themselves and couldn't finish it all, but we all ate a really good dinner. My boyfriend, who had never been to Pgh, LOVED this place.  After dinner, we stayed for quite awhile, and as the night progressed, we felt so much more out of place! We definitely felt like the old people in the place, and we're only in our late 20s!  I guess in the recent past, Hofbrauhaus has gotten into trouble with how they serve their alcohol, so they've gotten REALLY strict about when they'll serve you another beer, and they DON'T do shot skis anymore. We were ID'd when we walked in, by our server, and each time at the bar, too. We didn't get angry about it, though, cause we definitely saw some people that we gave questioning looks--they looked like college freshmen...  Anyway, we had a great time, but we were all much more sober than we EVER were when we came here in college, so that's why I only gave it three stars this time. I guess it'll just never live up to the memories I have here in 2008-2010 :-)"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go!  Almost impossible to get a good seat in the beer hall though and it is hard to organize big groups.  Also a big plus, they have a changing table for babies in the men's room!  Since I am the beer drinking the hubby takes care of the baby here, way to be progressive Hofbrauhaus!"}
{"text":"3 tourists from Arizona came here expecting great German food and we were very disappointed. The food was just blah with no flavor. We did come here at 4pm on a Tuesday so we assumed this place gets high ratings for the location and the overall experience rather than the food. If you're coming for the food then just drive away. $18 for a plate that wasn't good is just too much. But if you want to have good beer and a good time then it seems like a great place."}
{"text":"In all honesty, this place almost got a bad review if the food wasn't so damn good. My cousin took us here. Three of us are over 21 and the fourth is 19. It is a restaurant that serves a lot of really good beer and amazing German food.   Oddly enough and it makes no sense to me, after 9pm they won't let anyone under 21 inside so there was a moment when things felt really stressful. We then learned we could eat in the restaurant on one side we just couldn't eat on the side with the live music and where the bar was.   When we got our table the hostess was incredibly rude. There was a table with three women on one end and 5 empty chairs on the other end of the same table. The dining room we were in was practically empty so I still don't understand why the hostess tried to sit us at the same table with three total strangers? The women at the table gave her the funniest side eyed look I have seen. Then she puts us at the empty table just one row over but it was missing a chair. Instead of taking the chair from the adjacent table, she marched over to the table where the three women were and yanked one of the chairs from the table making a commotion with this awful pissed off look on her face. Slammed it under our table and walked off. We joked with each other that we should have offered to get the chair for her, maybe it wasn't in her job description or maybe she knew and didn't like the three women at the table.   Then comes in cute little blond girl with glasses and a smile from ear to ear. She is our waitress. Super friendly, offered advice when we asked about menu items and overall had a great personality.  OMG! When the food came I was in HEAVEN! The BEST Perogies I have ever had, I do not like cabbage but I LOVED the cabbage here. It was cooked and seasoned so well I could have eaten it all night.   We walked across to the other side after dinner, took a few facebook live videos of the band and everyone standing and dancing on their tables. It was a great experience. Then we went back to the restaurant side to pick up our 19 year old friend. LOL  I recommend going here for sure, if you have minors with you under 21 try and go before 9pm. The strange thing is when I walked across into that area, there were families with children in there but our 19 year old friend wasn't allowed after 9? So if we would have gotten there at 8:30 and stayed until 11:00 he could have gone on that side so it does seem a little strange, but those are the rules."}
{"text":"This place is like some kind of candyland. It's a franchise of the famous Hofbrauhaus in Munich, Germany, and it shows - the waitresses are all dressed in traditional derndl dresses, the beers are served by the liter, the band is led by an accordion and the people stand on their seats and loudly belt out whatever words they know.  Not even the excessive crowd bothered me. Believe me, it was packed in this place. But this is one of those places where the experience is made better by the huge, rambunctious group of drinking buddies all around you. I will go back every time I visit this town."}
{"text":"This is a great place if you are an undergraduate student looking for huge mugs of beer, along with someone's idea of acceptable German food. As a huge fan of German food and culture, I felt like this place was a Disney-fied version of the country I love. Not super authentic, and nothing was particularly tasty or notable. The crowds are HUGE and there's nothing truly notable or amazing about the place to make it worth elbowing your way through hundreds of drunken undergrads. I would not return anytime soon."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a beer and snack after a bike ride on the first nice spring day this year. Was hoping they would have the marzen on tap since it was March. No marzen on tap, they were still serving the February beer at the end if march, my half liter had a good inch plus of head, so did every other beer I watched the bartender pour. This is a beerhouse, you'd think they would know how to pour a beer. On top if that the beer wasn't even cold, just slightly lower than room temp. The pretzels I got were about on par with those frozen soft pretzels you can buy at the grocery store. I paid $10 for the pretzels and $5 for the half liter. Penn brewery is much better than this place, if you want a good German beer house experience go there. This place is more of a German themed Applebee's, if that."}
{"text":"When this place first opened, I thought it was heaven on earth. But after my first ten visits the novelty has worn off. The food is ok, and the service is hit or miss. If you have friends in town that have never been, it's definitely worth taking them to the hofbrauhaus."}
{"text":"Love Hofbrauhaus, every time we come to Pittsburgh we try to stop. Fun atmosphere and great food. The Hot Brown and Potato Pancakes are the tops!"}
{"text":"I had a great time drinking my massive beers and eating some kielbasa.  The food was pretty good, but a bit pricey for what I got.  I saw some shot-skis going down and really enjoyed the live polka.    There is also outside seating.   I would definitely recommend this place for a group or a party."}
{"text":"This place was awesome.  Service was quick and from the friendliest server.  We loved the beer and the giant pretzel with three different sauces satisfied every one at our table. ( we actually order a second one  it was so good) Schnitzel and sauerbraten were tender and tasty  I loved the fried cabbage and save room for the dessert.  He music was loud be we were having so much fun we hardly noticed."}
{"text":"This review is for the bar only. This is what I want heaven to be like, flowing dunkel, drunk friendly people, the best cover band in the land, and bier cheese that I would literally kill for.  If you would rather drink, dance, sing and have a good time over grinding randomly COME HERE! If you just wanna grind and hook up don't come here you won't have fun. I have been to A LOT of bars and this is my overall favorite, I go at least once a month hopefully more."}
{"text":"Hofbrauhaus is a whole lot of fun.  Servers in costume, a beer hall, and gigantic beers.  If you are in the mood for a non-quiet meal, you should definitely sit in the beer hall.  They have live entertainment (on most days I think) in a wide open seating area.  If you want something a little more peaceful, the patio is nice and has a decent view over the river.  Pretty much everything on the menu is either meaty or deep fried so this is not the place for trying to eat something light, but as long as you are not, everything is delicious.  If you have people to share with and plenty of appetite, the sampler plates are a good way to try a variety of foods - they have them for appetizers, wursts, and entrees.  The beer is great too, and comes in 1 liter steins (they also have 1/2 liters, if you don't want that much).  With tasty German food, beer, and a unique atmosphere, Hofbrauhaus is definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"Undoubtedly the best lager I have had in years.  The assorted appetizers are freshly made and delicious.  The interior definitely resembles a German beer hall (namely the original Hofbrauhas in Munich), although the house band could use more lessons.  Eins, zwei, g'suffa !"}
{"text":"Hofbrauhaus is just so much fun!  Absolutely LOVE the drinking atmosphere. The grand tables, the ginormous \"dining hall\" (or drinking hall?), the lovely covered terrace - it's all great!  I came here for dinner last night and enjoyed a couple brews (I think I had the one for October? They have a different beer every month! AMAZING). I started with the pretzels and biercheese and ordered the spatzle with chicken and mushrooms. The biercheese was definitely the highlight of the meal - fresh homemade pretzels and a light (but still rich) cheddar beer dip. I literally have a craving for these at least once a week!  The spatzle was pretty good, but nothing exciting. For those of you like me who have never really eaten German food before, spatzle is a dense, egg noodle that vaguely resembles gnocchi. The Heidelberger Rahm Spatzle (what I got) consisted of chicken breast, marsala cream sauce, caramelized onions, and mushrooms. My boyfriend got the Kasespatzle (like a mac 'n' cheese) and that was super rich, but very tasty. I'd recommend splitting that one.  Service and atmosphere were great, food wasn't bad. I'd definitely come here again for a round or two and some biercheese!"}
{"text":"A very nice, authentic-ish place.  We had the Wurstplatte, Leberkase, and the Hefe Weizen beer and they were all good. The Kartoffelsalat is very good!  The staff is pretty friendly and the atmosphere feels very warm.  Definitely recommended for those seeking a European touch to their days and seeking to get a beer with some friends."}
{"text":"Big beer steins.  Delicious beer.  Sing-a-long drinking bands.  What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"I think if you're already drunk and are independently wealthy, Hofbrauhaus is fun.   The food quality is actually better than I anticipated."}
{"text":"Their beer was decent but overall I feel like there are better breweries and beer destinations in the city. I do enjoy stopping in occasionally for the atmosphere. The German music, great hall setup, shot-skis and lederhosen can make for a rowdy crowd at times."}
{"text":"Spent the last night of a cross-country roadtrip at Hofbrauhaus, much to the recommendation of a friend we made hundreds of miles away. Safe to say the beer garden left a lasting impression.   Props the barkeep for the chill and low-key conversation. With pints the size of our heads, there is a good chance that I flubbed a few words or two, and I'd do it all again in a heartbeat"}
{"text":"This place is a curious mix of really good and so-so...  The good... - I am looking forward to summer, because their outdoor space is fantastic.  Right on the river with a great view and some fun activities.   - If you are looking for a fun, rowdy vibe in a place that isn't dirty and completely nuts, this is the place.  It's a good drinking atmosphere.    The so so... - The food.   My companion grew up in Germany and wasn't impressed with any of it.   As an American, I thought half of what we ordered was really good.  Half was really not.   The winners were the pretzels with bier cheese, the potato pancakes, and the cob salad.   The pork shank with cracklins, the pierogies, sauerkraut, and cabbage were all not so great.    - The portions.   They must be trying to compete with their ridiculously over-portioned neighbor, the Cheesecake Factory, because every dish we ordered was humongous.  Not a lot of healthy options to begin with and the portions are over the top.   I recommend sharing for sure.    - The music.  They had an accordion player in all of the traditional garb.  He stopped at prescribed intervals to sing some German song and make a toast.  It was cute the first time, but quickly became repetitive.   Would probably have been fine if we were there for drinking and not dinner, but as it was, we were sort of over it.    A couple of other things to know.    - Valet service is $8 and the area where I had to pull it was pretty far from the front door.  When leaving, I had to walk out in the rain to get to the valet stand.  He told me I could wait inside and he'd come get me, but that was only after I asked.  Several people were standing out in the rain waiting for their cars. - If you are there to eat, request a table closer to the bar (and farther from the music).  We had to shout to be heard over the accordion."}
{"text":"A fun place on Fridays and Saturdays when they have the band playing and everyone is dancing on the tables."}
{"text":"In my opinion- it's best time to go to the Hofbrauhaus is on an off time of the day. I met up with some friends from other of town for Sunday lunch at 12:45 pm and we got seated right away. We didn't sit on the main dining room, but sat in the quieter dining room area where it was quieter and we could catch up. Perfect for families of all ages.   For an appetizer, we order the 4 pretzels with beer cheese. They were delicious and the perfect amount to share.    For my main course - I ordered the spaetzle with shredded chicken and mushrooms and a side of potato pancakes. I had never tried this before - but now it will be my go-to.    Our waitress was very knowledgeable about the menu - she suggested what beers for me to try.    For dessert- we split the cinnamon pretzel with cream cheese icing. I loved it and would definitely get it again.   Overall, I enjoyed my experience at the Hofbrauhaus and will be back again soon."}
{"text":"Oh farfegnugen!  Alright - I have no idea what that means but it was a good night at the ole Hofbrau.  I ended up taking my engineers who were craving some German Food.    We put on our best yard gnome attire (atleast that is what it reminds me when I see shorts and suspenders) and took the drive down to Hofbrau.  We were quickly seated.    There was a gentleman who was quite good playing the keyboard and interacting with the crowd.   Many people were doing what appeared to be Ski Shots (shots done with a group that were on a ski).    Please note - if you are the shortest person in your group - you will tend to get wet.    I don't know why but what you think will be a casual shot will end up being a silly experience out of Nickelodeon.  The restaurant was not filled to capacity by no means but we had to wait 15 minutes before we were asked for our first beers.   In the waitress defense, she had 2 large tables.   After we received our first beer and put in our appetizer order we did not care.  Appetizer - I order the team the works - potato cakes, fried pickles, sauerkraut balls, and pretzels.   It was good but nothing to write home about.  Dinner - Bavarian Jägerschnitzel  a pan seared Pork Cutlet topped with a Burgundy Wine Mushroom and Bacon Sauce with Bacon Slices served with Cranberry Sauce, German Potato Salad and Chef 's Vegetable Selection.  My dinner was very good.   The pork was cooked perfectly, the sauce was tasty, and bacon will always be the perfect meat candy to any meal.  The Beer - I had the Oktoberfest beer (limited time) and Lager.  The beer at Hofbrau is always pretty good.  If you are in a group - this is the place to go.  I will be back but there are many local places I would rather go to in comparison - thus the three stars.   There is nothing wrong with the place - I am sure I will be back."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places, especially for the outdoor seating in the summer. If you're not in your twenties or like to party, I'd avoid this place on the weekends.   The soft pretzels and wheat beer are the best around."}
{"text":"love it here! you must come atleast once! for people of all ages and they do great jobs for birthdays! food is good and beer is great! they have a nice view of the river with outdoor seating, come early if you dont have a reservation-- they are always packed!"}
{"text":"Where can I start... This place is awesome! I went on a Friday night! The girls wear a beautiful German uniform. It's a safe environment, there are security at every door so picking a fight in such a fun place will be difficult. The food was served hot and beautifully displayed. Our drinks served cold in ice cold mugs. Our server Nicole was sweet, friendly and was honest when telling us she didn't know how something tasted. This place is beautifully put together. They had live band that night and I got to dance on the benches and some others danced on the tables. The environment is just amazing! 5 stars to this place because of the place is clean, quick to serve us, friendly, food was unique, drinks where served chilled, and the music was top notch. A place to go with family, friends or both at the Same time!"}
{"text":"Are you kidding me? THIS PLACE IS AWESOME. I thought I was dreaming, but when I woke up in a bier cheese stained shirt, sore legs from dancing on tables, and had the smell of beer on my breath - I knew that I had in fact experienced heaven.   Unfortunately though, I awoke still not having a clue as to who the f*** Alice is. And that's ok with me because I will be back a million times more to chant her name anyway."}
{"text":"Excellent food and beer. Atmosphere is loud but not overpowering. Wait staff very good, friendly, and helpful.  Our server Heather did an excellent job."}
{"text":"Everything about  hof brau was fantastic.   Atmosphere, great outside seating.   Even inside is a cool experience - was their during the World Cup and it was a blast. Brat, sauerkraut, potato pancakes - everything we ordered was bring home good.  Beers were cold and fresh out of the barrel.   Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! So much fun. I went for the first time on my birthday recently and had a blast! It's like a huge party/smorgasbord. Neato German looking guy singing up front and calling out the shot-ski's!!! Shot-skis are so fun! (kinda expensive but well worth it). This is a great place to have tons of fun with a whole room of friends and people you will meet for the first time! Loads of fun, Great beer and food!!"}
{"text":"My Wife and I had the beer sampler and the App Plater and everything was great. Our server Cydne was helpful and very friendly."}
{"text":"This restaurant gets a resounding 'meh' from me.  I really enjoy coming here--when it's convenient and usually in the summer because I like the outdoor biergarten.  Their bier is SCHEISS.  FURCHTBAR.  It's going to impress you if you've never had actual German beer.  I have.  It just doesn't taste right.  The best brew of the bunch is the Witbier.  Try ordering the Radler beeer, which is the wheat beer mixed with lemonade.  It's very refreshing.  If you enjoy sodium, you will LOVE the food.  Everything here is way too salty.  I think it's so they sell more beer?  Or maybe it's just bc I've quit smoking, now I think everything is salty.  I will fight you over the beer cheese pretzel.  It's pretty damn good.  Also, the Hot Brown looks a little iffy on the menu but my friend ordered it and she said it was fantastic.  .  Be prepared to losen your dirndl and let your Lederhosen out bc the portions are HUGE.  The caloric value of the food would probably be horrifying.  You can just drink your way through your diet guilt.  The service is usually fantastic and the food does come out quickly  Don't come to the Hofbrauhaus if you've had a bad day at work and need to vent to a friend--I made thie mistake of doing this and this is how I learned that the most annoying sound in the world when you're stressed out is that of an old man attempting to yodel.  Not even a very large witbier could save me."}
{"text":"This place is very popular especially among the younger crowd. But for me going here is like going to Disney world. Not because it's awesome but because when you go you remember why you haven't visited for 10 years. The main hall is EXTREMELY LOUD !  There is usually a live band playing polkas and people are seated at long rows of tables with people screaming to talk over each other and the music.   The food is okay. When we visited we arrived in time for happy hour (5-7pm) and saw on the website that to take advantage of happy hour pricing you had to go to the bar area. We asked the hostess if we could sit outside at a table and still participate and she said \"anywhere\" in the restaurant. But when we sat down at a table they said we were misinformed and would have to go to the bar if we wanted happy hour.   Outside there is a bar, and we had to belly up to get a limited selection of happy hour beers and pay a separate tab.   The appetizers were half price there.   The service was slow too. There was only one server (who was brand new) to cover too many tables.   Long story short, it will probably be another 10 years before I return and recall why I didn't go sooner.   IMO if you want good German food there are much better choices in da burgh.   Ps - there is no free parking. Either you have to valet for $8 + tip or find street parking or garage parking a block away and walk."}
{"text":"First off - I love their beer. It's always delicious, and it's definitely a fun atmosphere.  However, I think their food is a bit of a disappointment. I'm a vegetarian, and the things I've tried have all been mediocre at best.  Overall a fun atmosphere - but there are so many other cool places in the South Side, that I think this just doesn't live up to the hype."}
{"text":"I've only been to Hofbrauhaus few times over the years and so far my experience has been good. Good Food .. Great Beer and attentive staff depending on what time of the day you get there.  The place it self is humongous and well placed along the river board walk. The bier garden is great during summer.  I will definitely go back again for the atmosphere and the beer but not so much for the food."}
{"text":"This is definitely NOT up my ally.  First, I recommend going at least tipsy.  The beers are pretty good for being 'home made' (for lack of a better word) and very reasonably priced.  For me, I just want delicious beers.  They don't have to be home-made.  I rather a beer not home-made that tastes amazing than one that is OK that was home-made.  It's a large place, so it's pretty spacious considering how many people filter in. The live bands are OK, but it gets very kum bah yah-ish.    This is a place for you if you like live bands and lots of noise and people dancing on their seats. When it comes to night life, I am strictly for electronic dance music, so my review may not be 100% fair,  but it is true that I personally have experienced much better.  FYI, they check purses before you leave so don't do anything stupid."}
{"text":"I have wanted to come to the Hofbrauhaus since my 21st birthday but just made it here a few weeks ago.  To be honest, I don't get why people love it so much.  The food is very Americanized German, and the atmosphere is so strange.  I ordered the Bauren Schnitzel ($16.95), which was a Pork cutlet with Ham and American Cheese.  Think a cheap version of chicken cordon bleu.  It was the waxy American cheese.  This was the kind of thing I would expect to get from a dive bar or cheap diner.  I also had a dark beer that, while dark in color, was not dark in flavor.  It was fine just not what I expected.  My dad was super unimpressed with his Weisswurst.  So food was a bust, beer was ok.  I think the low point came when at 6:00 pm on a weeknight people were plastered.  The waitresses were serving multiple drinks to people simultaneously, which is illegal.  Some creepy old man who was there with his TEN children was double-fisting liters of beer.  And he and his children spent the evening running through the tables.  The Von Trapp family with a drinking problem?  Guess that's what I get for eating fake German food.  If you just want to drink, go to the Beer Garden at a time children are not allowed.  Otherwise, skip the Hofbrauhaus."}
{"text":"The food here was really good. The family enjoyed themselves and the ambience made you feel like you were in Bavaria."}
{"text":"A place with atmosphere, public and menu. Beer very close to authentic standards. Good schnitzels and soups. Occasional live music (accordion of course)."}
{"text":"The beer and appetizers are the only reason to go here. The entrees are decent but not worth the price- a novelty place but lacking in actually good meals. The pork was good but not outstanding. We only go here when visitors come to the city because they insist on going. There are dozens of better places in the area for the same money."}
{"text":"The beer and the atmosphere are the absolute best. Service is fantastic and management very attentive. Probably my favorite place to visit when bike riding in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"This has become the goto place with the Fam.  Us parents get to enjoy the bier (this time we went large and got the liter size) and our nearly adult child drives us home, keeping us and everyone around us safe.  It's nice because the the music is entertaining whether you are drinking or not, the place looks festive whether you're drinking or not, you can sit outside or inside, in short - a great place for the Fam!  There are a couple parking garages nearby, as well as metered on-street parking (which is free after 6pm.) This is Southside, so there are a lot of other interesting things within walking distance."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant for a business/social event. Our server was very friendly. The drinks were great. The dinner was excellent and received a large portion. The traditional German band was a lot of fun. Everything was clean and decor provided a German feel."}
{"text":"We met some friends for dinner here as we both passed through town. We really enjoyed the uniqueness of the menu (for us). We were seated at a nice big wooden table on the upstairs patio (which was good, because it looked like a college Oktoberfest party going on in the main restaurant area). We started off with \"the works\" sampler and, despite small portions, everything tasted great (especially the fried pickles, sauerkraut balls, beer cheese. For dinner I had Wurstplatte sampler which was all good. My son had the Bavarian Jagerschnitzel which was very good. My daughter had the Kasespatzel which she said was good. Mom had the cordon blue Schnitzel which she enjoyed. Our dining guest also enjoyed their meals. I also enjoyed a couple half pints of the Hefe Weizen beer. That was good too. So, we give it a five-star rating overall."}
{"text":"We ordered our food and it literally took over an hour for our food to be delivered.  The waitress came over to our table and mentioned that she that the kitchen was behind in the orders because the place was so big and they staff it with 18 year olds.  Well to me that's and excuse and not a solution.  The waitress could have offered a solution by giving us some type of discount or coupons like the coupe that was seated in the booth next to us."}
{"text":"Great service, great beer, great food.  I had the bratwurst with potato pancake and sauerkraut - all were great."}
{"text":"I just love the atmosphere here!! It's very unique and engaging. I had came here a couple of times for food and just to grab drinks. In terms of the food, it was ok. It wasn't anything amazing but it was good. However,  I really enjoy the variety of beer that they offer. In terms of the environment,  the waitresses are dressed in German uniforms and they have a live band playing. Although it is quite loud in here, it makes it fun to stand up on the tables and sing along with everyone else. I would definitely recommend this place for the experience! Also, it's usually quite crowded on weekends."}
{"text":"Eery friendly and loved the atmosphere.   Food was okay, as was my clam chowder, but nothing was out of the ordinary. They seemed really busy even when the place wasn't packed (perhaps understaffed?) and as other reviewers have mentioned, is it REALLY noisy. As in.. not hearing each other talk even sitting at the bar, which could be the downside to the visually pleasing hall. It is a chain, but they only have couple of locations in the US."}
{"text":"So even before moving back to Pittsburgh in October of 2010, I had the opportunity to experience the Hofbrauhaus... and I did not like it then.  So since I moved within a stones throw of the place, I have decided to give it many a chances to wow me in some regard to make me like it and want to come back (I mean, for the sake of convenience, it would be an ideal place to like more than we do).  After numerous attempts at at least liking it enough to come back once a month, I cannot even do that.    The main hall is obnoxious.... I guess I am getting old as I cannot stand how loud it is and it always baffles me how many smaller children and babies are there with their families... especially since I have seen people get rowdy at times.    The only way I will be back is outside in the warmer weather... I like to avoid the aforementioned hoopla.    The food (minus some of the apps) leaves little to be desired in my opinion.  With so many other better dining options in town, this is not somewhere I will go for a full meal.    Service is hit or miss... I often seemed to have more luck at the bar than dealing with a server.    The beer is good... and the prices are good as well for the quantities.... so I guess that should help improve the rating to at least three stars (that coupled with the beer garden)."}
{"text":"This place is awesome if you're looking for good German food. The beer is very good as well. Some people complain about the parking and that you may have to walk a whole block to eat here. Well it is a city and that's unfortunately how it is. Some other reviews talk about how the bands are loud and it's not some quaint restaurant. Well this is supposed to mimic a sort of beer \"tent\" at Oktoberfest, not be the French Landry.  Bottom line is if you want good German food and beer, this is the place. The sauerbraten and schnitzels are great. The service is very good and so is the atmosphere. For anyone looking at this review, ignore the idiots that gave a low rating. They are most likely snobs. I've eaten here with people that had lived in Germany for a long time and even they told me it was very good. I will continue to try different items here.  So there ya go"}
{"text":"This was a second visit to the Hofbrauhaus, and was one place we knew we would get seated without a long wait on a Friday night in Pittsburgh.  The atmosphere inside is a beer hall, with all the accompanying noise and liveliness, but we chose the terrace because it was a beautiful summer evening, and we would have a view of the river.  The food is hearty, ample and amazing.  For starters four of us split \"The Works\" sampler, which I highly recommend:  soft pretzels with beer cheese, potato pancakes with applesauce, fried pickles with ranch dressing, and sauerkraut balls with honey mustard.  Whoops, just had to wipe the drool off my keyboard.  Wursts, schnitzels, and meats oh my.  The fare is pretty authentic German with a few items thrown in for the hipster or pickier eaters in your group.  Not surprisingly there is a great beer selection.  A fun place to go."}
{"text":"Nice and cheerful atmosphere. I had the Hefe Weizen and couldn't stop drinking it. Pretzels and beer cheese are a must. We were scraping the beer cheese container trying to get the last drop. I wasn't a fan of the german potato salad (my sister recommended it because she loves it). It might be because it's definitely nothing like traditional American potato salad so if that's what you're in the mood for, this definitely is not similar. The sauerkraut is the BEST sauerkraut I've eaten. I would most definitely eat a bowl of it alone."}
{"text":"Festive!  Loved the app tray! Pretzels were good, kraut and ham balls were excellent! Fried pickles...yum!  Even the craft beer was good (I'm not usually a fan)."}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times. They have multiple seating options - inside, balcony, and the beer garden. For your first visit, I would recommend sitting inside. This place offers a unique experience of dancing on your seats while the music plays. This is super fun, but do not step on the table, since that will lead to ousting. The beer garden is also fantastic, but it's open only during the warm months. The balcony is just like any other outdoor seating, but you get a really nice view of the river.  All their beers are amazing. The original, the hefe weizen, the dunkel, and the red beer. They also have a seasonal option. The red beer is probably my favorite. The last time I was there, I had 2 liters of that!   I'm not a big fan of their food, but a lot of my friends swear by it. This place is definitely a must go."}
{"text":"Am I the only one that doesn't like this place?  I really just can't get into the vibe of this place.  The atmosphere is terrible, the food is on par with applebees or TGIFridays, and the drinks are irresponsibly large.  Seriously though, why are your beers that big?  It's irresponsible to expect patrons to pace themselves when your beers are the size of a growler.  I know you've had a lot of problems with the PLCB, and yet you continue to over-serve patrons, and then let them stand on crowded solid wood tables before sending them out into the world in an area where they'll almost certainly have to drive out of.   for reference:  http://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2013/05/07/Owners-of-South-Side-s-Hofbrauhaus-settle-in-girl-s-death-for-15-6-million/stories/201305070253  http://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2015/12/24/Couple-sue-Hofbrauhaus-over-intoxicated-customer/stories/201512240152"}
{"text":"This restaurant is very nice. The staff was very friendly and service was great. The food is delicious and there is a great selection of beer. Definitely loved the music and how everyone was dressed."}
{"text":"Went here on a Tuesday night after Germany beat Brazil in a 2014 World Cup match.  The night was very comfortable so we sat outside along the river.  We had the Hofbrau Hefe Weizen beer, the Bavarian Jagerschnitzel and a Dunkel Bourbon Chicken Sandwich.  All were excellent.  The service was efficient and attentive.  My son who is attending school in Pittsburgh said he was definitely coming back with his friends.  The price seemed very reasonable less than $90 for three."}
{"text":"After walking 2 miles on the Three Rivers Heritage trail, my bf suggested to have a beer and dinner at Hofbrauhaus.. I almost tried to talk him out of it because who wants to eat carbs and beer after going on a 2 mile hike??   The reason for this update is to let you know Hofbrauhaus has amazing salads! I was stuck between the Munich Market Salad and Cobb Salad. I decided on the Munich. It had chopped romaine lettuce, strawberries, mandarin oranges, pineapple chucks, dried cranberries, glazed pecans onion and feta cheese. I added grilled chicken for an up-charge (you can also add salmon). The dressing on the salad was raspberry poppy seed.   That salad was ^&%$#@*  amazing! So fresh, so filling and tasty. It went perfect with the light beer option (Hefe Weizen.. my fav!!)   They also offered a Pittsburgh Salad as well as a few other options.  ****You can buy 6 packs to-go. Their beer is also sold at D's 6 packs & dogs"}
{"text":"Ahhhh I love this place!! Definitely a must if you're visiting Pittsburgh or a resident! The beer serving are huge!!! I was having a pretty good time after the first huge glass! And those soft pretzels are to die for!   We sat on the patio, such a beautiful view out there! Love the atmosphere and how freaking big the place is! Definitely perfect for big groups of people! Great if you actually want to go out and have conversation with people.   I also saw a lot of families in there so it looks like it can be enjoyable for almost everyone (maybe not young children)! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant with two friends around Christmastime during the daytime on a weekend. The restaurant was not busy at all, and we had our choice of table. If you like German food, you probably will enjoy this restaurant. German food is just not my favorite. I had difficulty with finishing all of my sausages. Maybe next time I will more wisely order my food. I am not a beer drinker so did not try their beer. (Yes, why did \"I\" go to \"this\" restaurant?!) My friend said that he enjoyed his food and beer. Prices were moderate. Our waiter was nice and served us well."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times with my friends and it's never disappointed me. Several of my German friends have mentioned that the food is not as authentic as it should be. But hey, it's like Americanized Chinese food - nobody would say it's authentic but it can still taste great. I absolutely loved the soft pretzels they have. The schnitzel was on point too. I was especially happy with the large serving size."}
{"text":"As a German, I can say that this place is a little kitchy piece of Heaven for me. Although Hofbrauhaus is a very touristy place in Germany, that doesn't make it any less fun. Hofbrauhaus has delicious Bavarian staples. This place is downright fun! I love going here with my friends to have the same beer I drink at Oktoberfest in Germany!"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful time at Hofbrauhaus when visiting some friend's to celebrate some birthdays. We really wanted to go there because we are planning to go to Oktoberfest this year, and what a better place to prepare than the Hofbrauhaus, right? It was so much fun!  We weren't able to get a table in the main room at first so we went to the side room where we got some appetizers, and a few people got meals. I enjoyed looking over the menu at some of the traditional German dishes. If you are not a fan of German food, then don't expect to like their food. I rather enjoyed the things I tried - including the weiner schnitzel, the kraut balls, and the pretzels.   The beer was really good too and pretty cheap. I tried the Premium Lager, the Hefe Weizen, and the Dunkel. I liked the Premium the best, but the others were good too. You got a ton of beer for the cost, and I was even able to buy the stein for an extra $10 to add to my beer boots and steins collection.   We also enjoyed doing some shot skis, where we all lined up and downed a shot together. One of my friends was the short one on her ski and got a shot in her eye - so just make sure the taller folks bend down a bit! It was pretty funny though.   Once the main room opened up a bit, we headed over there to dance on the tables and cheers each other with our steins. It was a really fun night, and I would definitely recommend a trip there if you are into Oktoberfest-type or binge-drinking activities. Fun times indeed!!"}
{"text":"A friend and I were enjoying our meals.  I am in a bad habit of chewing my straw whenever I am talking to somebody.  I had a regular Coke and since my friend is a diabetic he had a Diet Coke.  The waitress asked us if we wanted a refill and we both said yes.  Whenever the waitress return she gave me the Diet Coke and my friend the Coke.  I would have never known this is my straw wasn't chewed up.  I told her that hey you accidentally gave us the wrong drinks.  If my friend would have drank my drink he could have gone into a severe diabetic shock or got very ill.  I know this can happen at any restaurant but I'm hoping that somebody can start the ball rolling that everybody would get a different color strong or something to know what your guess what."}
{"text":"Very nice selection of food for both adults and kids.   A wide variety of beer to choose from too.   Also, tons of places to sit and is very spacious."}
{"text":"Great place to go with a big group for something different than just heading out to the bars. I've been to the original one in Munich, and its American incarnation was pretty much along the same lines--beer, table-dancing (well, bench-dancing) to cheesy songs that everyone knows the words to, and lots of fun.  As far as beer goes, I wasn't big on their Weizen (wheat beer) and I'm not a fan of lagers in general. Love their Dunkel though, so I always order that. Most of my friends always get the light beer...no comment. Food here isn't very good. Zucchini planks are the only thing I like (huge portion, good for snacking with a group). All the meat dishes are extremely dry and heavy on the salt. Personally, I wouldn't recommend this as a dinner/drinking combo. Eat elsewhere, then come here to drink.  Another negative, the place gets way too crowded. If you come before 10pm, there will be an obscene wait for a table (and it's not fun if you don't get a table). Sometimes table reservations will be booked for the night as early as 7pm. Come late, and you can usually find some friendly strangers to jump in with. It's a little bit of a hassle to come here on a regular basis, but for birthdays or other special occassions, it's a great spot."}
{"text":"I would call Hofbrauhaus the Applebee's of Beer Halls, but that's only because it's a chain. The food is actually quite good and the beer - though not so good as to make me tear up - is good. This place gets PACKED, though, so I suggest either getting there early or else heading down to the outside picnic tables. The scene there is much more relaxed and the view is great.  BEER SELECTION: Lagers all, with the occasional altbier. Solid, but not overly impressive. FOOD SELECTION: Traditional german stuff with an emphasis on sausages. Good and well priced. SERVICE: It gets noisey in the hall, what with the singing, yelling, cheering, and dancing, so you'll have to forgive the waitstaff if they always seem to be in a rush.  Shotskis are to be shared with four people. Jager and Honey Jager shots are poured into shot glasses glued to a ski, then drank at one time by the participants. Have fun!"}
{"text":"Allergy friendly.... Dairy, shellfish, all nuts.  I always forget to take before pics.  Sorry.  Had the Hungarian goulash and beef brat!  My son he needed a straw to get every last bite of goulash and if hot dogs tasted like the bratwurst, he would eat them.... Just as well, no hotdogs for him.  BTW they subbed it no problem for kids hot dog meal.  Steamed broccoli on the side I stead of fries.  Interesting, fun place.  9 of us, big group.  Sat in quiet room."}
{"text":"I enjoyed our experience at Hofbrauhaus.  We went on a Sunday afternoon around 3:30 so the cavernous restaurant seemed very empty.  We were quickly greeted and our request for a table inside but with a view of the river was accommodated with a smile.    We started with the \"Works\" sampler.  Because it was slow in the restaurant, the food came out much more quickly than we had expected it to.  It was tasty and quite a bit of food.  However, it cost more than either of our entrees did.  The pretzels were the standard soft pretzel.  The bier cheese, however, was fantastic!  I wish they would have given us more than just the small cup worth.  The plate also included fried pickels (which were pretty standard as well).  What stood out wer ethe sauerkraut balls (served with honey mustard).  They were unique, crisp and tasty.  The combo was rounded out with potato pancakes served with applesauce.  While I enjoyed the potato pancakes, I expected better from a German restaurant.  Main entrees were the Jagerscnitzel and Kasespatzle.  The Jagerschnitzel is pork with a wine mushroom/bacon sauce.  The pork was tender and the breading crisp and tasty.  It came with a delectable German potato salad and a fried cabbage that I can't say much more about other than \"meh.\"  The Kasespatzle was, as expected, very heavy (the dish contains swiss cheese, onions nad heavy cream sauce).  It was too much for my taste, but my fiance loved it.    While we were dining, a leiderhosen clad accordian player kept the small crowd entertained with traditional German favorites with the Chicken Dance thrown in for good measure.    Overall, we had an enjoyable and tasty experience.  Hofbrauhaus certainly won't be a regular stop, but we will visit again."}
{"text":"It's a fun night out at the HB in Pittsburgh's South Side. For a big beer hall I'm always amazed at how great the food is. It never disappoints! The schnitzel is best in the city, and the sausages are authentic German. The beer selection is great as expected. Best we like the atmosphere of the space - even on a slower night the place is welcoming and cheerful!"}
{"text":"This place is quite the unique experience. Only been here a couple times, and while I don't personally enjoy this type of environment too much, it can be good fun once in a while (or even just for people watching). There's seating both indoors and outdoors-sih (the latter like a patio but not really outside in the cold air), and you can choose to be as close to or as far away from the revelry as you want. Come later at night and people will be drinking and singing, and oftentimes dancing on the benches.   As for the beers and the food, they are quite passable. My personal favorite is the hefeweizen, but they also offer several other standard varieties. There is a lot of German fare food, from wurst to pretzels to salads to various entrees. While I don't personally think they are amazing, they all do go very well with the beer."}
{"text":"Not a beer person, but if you are, make a stop here and I'm almost guaranteed that you'll like it. When I came here with my bf, I felt like we entered a German village. The performances were great, the place was HUGE, and the crowd was just one big happy family."}
{"text":"Joe Malloy! I love that guy. This is such a great place.  About as good as the Las Vegas place.  The food is tremendous, both in flavor and quantity.  The pretzels are wonderful, with beer cheese. Schnitzel was fantastic.  I even loved the sauerkraut balls. This place has more beers than Vegas which is cool.  They have a different beer every month.  Wish I lived in the area."}
{"text":"If you order a liter you can get a brand new liter glass for only $10!  Super fun place! Bier cheese and soft pretzels are as good as it gets!  Definitely good German food.  Bartenders are awesome and super friendly. This place gets off the chain nuts on the weekend at night!"}
{"text":"The food here is great! I got the \"Hofbräuhaus Würstlplatte\" with German potato salad and a potato pancake. I have no issues with the food all! Very well prepared and delicious!   I got their February seasonal beer which was the \"adulerator\". Being that it was like 8% alcohol you are unable to get it in a big liter mug... So i had 4 of the half liters.  It was delicious and boy did i end up feeling it!   My only issue is not being able to give reservations. We had a group of 16, and it would have been great to make them.  That being said, our est wait time of 2 hrs was right on, so no complaint there.   Our service was great! She was very attentive and a fun person! I dont think i could handle that many people at one time! She had no problem splitting up our bill (which was probably a pain) and even reminded us all that gratuity was included for each!  Very considerate!  We ended up having to sit in the dining area and not the bar area so it was much tamer experience that we wanted, but it was still fun!  Good food, good beer equals a great time!"}
{"text":"Just stopped here for drinks by the river.  They offer a German-style beer garden, but it was nice to know that there was a selection of affordable non-beer options.  The ambience was pleasant.  The service was decent.  I definitely will have to revisit for food one of these days.  Looks like it could be a fun time."}
{"text":"Very fun if you are looking to pay attention to the band and not your group mates!  Dance on your seat if you have the gumption!"}
{"text":"This was always one of our favorite places to go in Pittsburgh until last night. When we arrived around 6:30 they said it would be an hour wait. That wasn't a problem as our family was looking forward to this visit for a few months. We were seated at 7:30 and place our order rather quickly. Waitress said kitchen is running a little behind tonight at the time of our order but didn't really say what a little was. Turns out a little means over an hour and fifteen minutes until your food will get to your table. I hope they address the issues with the kitchen at sometime because it really used to be a fun place to go. Would not recommend to anyone until they fix the service."}
{"text":"Not terrible, but still not good.   Hofbrauhaus is a cool place to visit if you enjoy standing on tables and singing... great for friends, not so much for grandma. The staff's  \"German\" outfits and the giant mugs of beer are pretty much the highlights. The restaurant has mediocre live music that only is bearable after a few of the aforementioned beers.   While fun if you're with the right group, don't come here for the food. It's overpriced, inauthentic, and overall pretty bland. After going a few times, I've certainly exceeded my quota. Unless some naive friend decides to have a birthday party here, I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Situated on a lovely plot of land bordering the river walk in the heart of Pittsburgh, this restaurant has a great feel especially in the summer. There is a ton of outdoor seating if you're in the mood. The indoor seating is also welcoming and contains beautiful murals that are reminiscent of German life. The food is delicious, traditional German food and the staff is very friendly. We visited this restaurant on vacation and our server was very open and willing to give us recommendations of good spots to visit in Pittsburgh. I hope I can visit here again on my next visit to the burgh!"}
{"text":"Another e-mail not answered about parking validation options to offset the cost of valet parking.   So, you know what? I'm tired of paying for parking. The food isn't much (except for the potato soup, and I enjoy many beers and wines found elsewhere.   Probably will never visit Hofbrauhaus again.   Valet costs plus tip equals two craft beers somewhere else with free parking.   Good bye Hofbrauhaus. I enjoyed you in Munich in the '60's, can live without  you now."}
{"text":"I have a like/dislike relationship with this place. It is great if you are freshly 21 and/or are in college or are in party mode. The food is nothing special, the drinks are huge, and it is just one big singing/drinking party. The live entertainment they had was drinking beer whilst they were singing and...it got interesting."}
{"text":"I went to Hofbrauhaus Pittsburgh while visiting some friends on 6/6/15. I had an idea of what the experience would be like having been to the 1 in Munich Germany many years ago.   I am going to start with what I didn't like and then explain why I am giving it 4 stars. The restaurant is loud and I found myself screaming at my friends a couple of times so they could hear me. I am not sure if the spotty service was because our waitress was over taxed with tables or she gave us our space so we could continue drinking and eating. Either way, I would have liked her to check on us a couple of times more than she did. I would have liked 2nd drink but by the time she came around my friends wanted the check. The gift shop was also very limited with their sizes for tee shirts. I would have bought more souvenirs than I did if more was available.   However with all that being said it is a really fun atmosphere at Hofbrauhaus Pittsburgh. The band although they made the restaurant loud, I liked how they encouraged people to stand up on the stools and toast. I remember when I went to Germany part of the fun of beer gardens is making \"friends\" with strangers by toasting each other. The cover songs the band played also were very good; and, I thought overall the quality of the music was truly professional.   The portions of food like the beer are HUGE and really good. My pretzel and salad were both so delicious I forced myself to continue eating.   In a nutshell not a great place to go if you'd like to sit down and have a conversation with someone but a really fun atmosphere and a truly unique experience if you're in the area."}
{"text":"No disrespect to those who have come here and had a great time -- I am sure it's possible.  I mean who doesn't love 2490589348 people standing on top of tables smashing their beer mugs (that must weigh ten pounds) together---constant toasting---all while those same people sing a Bruce Springstein song as good as they can for as drunk as they are.    This place is huge -- surely it could fit half the population of Pittsburgh.  It's unique, too, I'll give you that.  And the beer prices aren't half bad!  But let's get real.  I thought two things over and over again when I was here: 1.  Did a frat house rent this place out for a party?  I found out, no..... Says the girl next to me, \"It's always like this\". 2.  Is this a Tea Party gathering?  Evidence indicates no, it wasn't, so again \"it's always like this\"."}
{"text":"Love it here.  The sheer size of the space, and the pervasiveness and tastefulness of the theme, are impressive enough that I sometimes forget how great the food and drink are.  Their seasonal beers are terrific, and of course the Hefeweisen is a solid standby.  The pretzels will blow your mind, and the sauerbraten, spaetzle, and wursts are all pitch-perfect.  I give it four stars because the size, crowds, and noise can get kind of overwhelming to me - a personal preference, I admit!  I give them lots of credit for stepping outside the wurst-and-kraut standards to provide the schnitzel cordon bleu (which, beware: it's way cheesier than you expect!) and the Heidelberger Rahm Spaetzle, a kind of creamy chicken-and-spaetzle marsala that I order when I don't feel like moving for the next few hours.  I'd say Hofbrauhaus is a must-visit!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a quiet place to enjoy a standard drink, Hofbrauhaus is NOT the place for you.  I mean this place gets loud!  You'll quickly see the crowd standing on their seats, singing and dancing along to the music and enjoying Hof's home brew.  Their lager is good, but I think I prefer their dunkel!  Remember, your choice is 1/2 or full liter, so come prepared to drink!"}
{"text":"Use the no wait app. Every time I go to hofbrauhaus, I'm reminded how I want one of those cute costumes for Halloween, etc.!! My favorite part is down in the Biergarten, basically an outdoor riverside bar with picnic tables and walk up service in addition to servers. Everyone loves the pretzels with bier cheese. Over winter, we ate here a few times, and if you love the bier cheese, check out the broccoli and cheese! Yum! They're very easy going with sides substitution. I ordered a schnitzel dish that came with cabbage - which my body doesn't like- and our lovely server helped pick a substitute with a smile!! Bier: yum, I usually stick to the whitest clearest stuff. They serve only their own, the dude has tried nearly all varieties and has yet to leave one to waste!  Ambience, surely everyone's written about: the main hall can be very loud/ downright rambunctious! Live music with chanting and cheers! The more quiet dining room is less decorative, but if you're looking for more traditional family dinner with conversation, opt for this room. The dude and I also enjoy being out on the perimeter tented area.. But you could be right under a speaker..."}
{"text":"So fun! We ordered a pretzel appetizer and figured it would be at max 2 pretzels! Came with 4!!! Sit outside and enjoy the view of the river"}
{"text":"5 stars all the way!! The servers were cute in their clothing and not slutty in my opinion. I know slutty. I've been to the Tilted Kilt. The place was clean, the service was good, and it wasn't too noisy nor were people disgusting drunk. With that out of the way...  The food was awesome. I heart the hell out of German food, and this did the trick. We shared the sauerkraut balls, which were scrumptious. We each had the Oktoberfest Schweinshaxe, which was colossal and amazing. It looked like a dinosaur leg!! We had leftovers for two days. It came with crackling (a southern thing too, something this southern girl knows about), potato dumpling, and more of that good sauerkraut.   Dessert was the apple strudel for me, and it was superb. I don't remember having the pretzel, though. Darren hogged that. lol. I also loved the Prince Ludwig beer.   All in all, Hofbrahaus is a great addition to South Side Works."}
{"text":"Every time I go to the Hofbrauhaus in Pittsburgh, I'm cool with it.  Its not amazing, but its good.  The bang for the buck is there (even though we didn't buy last night, thanks to a great friend).  We went for a boat ride - a boat ride with grownups only.  There are plenty of spots to tie up, but then you've got to walk into the city to get where you want to be.  SouthSide Works was our go-to last night because of the new marina there.  We tied up, hopped out, and were sitting at a table at Hofbrauhaus within 5 minutes.  Chose to sit outside because the weather was phenomenal.  ~ Use the No-Wait app ~ Sit outside if the weather is good.  Its loud in the main room, and it can be fun, but i prefer it only in the winter for some reason. ~ Get the smaller beer, the big beer glass is wicked heavy ~ They have a Gluten Free menu & a kids menu  And do eat?  I'm a big fan of the Works Sampler to get started.  Its a little bit of everything that you probably want to try.  I like schnitzel, so I prefer the Bauern Schnitzel - put beer cheese & ham on it, all good.  IPA-hole went with Wurstplatte.  I was hoping someone would get the weiner art.  No one did."}
{"text":"I've been here for lunch and dinner, but never for late night shenanigans.  I've always been a fan of the food, and the atmosphere was pleasant (I love the polka music!).  But at night, it turns into a room of music, dancing on the benches, and wall - to - wall people.  It was great!  The only bad thing was that they asked for your ID every single time you ordered a drink at the bar, and you couldn't go get a drink for someone else without them being there.  Great time!"}
{"text":"Had a great meal here while visiting for Green Day Concert in March.  We had great service and wonderful huge soft pretzels. Waiter customized a dish for my son and we were seated immediately at prime dinner time.  Only complaint is that they don't have a parking lot and that was challenging. Rest was super."}
{"text":"Went there after a Steeler game. The place was lively and fun. Live german music playing as we walked into the large dining hall. A couple was dancing to the german music. Started with a beer and potatoe pancakes, pierogies , pretzel and potatoe soup. All very good, the potatoe pancakes and soup were over the top. Dinners were good as well, had sauerbraten and pork schnitzel. The family enjoyed the experience, will be back."}
{"text":"Cool place.  Inside was packed and raucous with live music.  Felt like I was in a clean version of Game of Thrones episode!  We were seated outside, which was quieter with nice view.  Food and service was good."}
{"text":"A beautiful place for college kids on a Thursday night during the their college night happy hour. There is live music in the big hall and everyone stands on their chairs with giant beers in hand. Great time! Also, I could live solely on the pretzels and bier cheese!!!"}
{"text":"I joined a group here for food and drinks.   I must say that I am a huge fan of German food and culture before I say this is a great place to eat or meet with friends for some beers. The place is huge and on the river with an expansive patio in the back. Unless visiting at peak times, finding a table should be no problem.  Staff members are dressed in German garb and the music is loud, overall creating a small feeling of being in Bavaria.    As expected, the beer is solid.  With whatever type of beer you choose, I suggest going for the 1L mug as it is an awesome feeling to hold that mug filled with so much drink.  My favorite is the hefeweizen, a wheat beer with a citrus taste that is great in summer.  The food is great too from appetizers to main courses.  The pretzels are hot and soft with a real cheese dipping sauce.  There are lots of choices for entrees but one can't go wrong with a wurst platter.  Jagerschnitzel (pork cutlet with mushrooms) is another favorite of mine.  Great place for food, drinks, or both!  Go with a friend or a large group on a warm summer night and you won't want to say \"auf wiedersehen!\""}
{"text":"Awesomely authentic German bier!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome all the way around. From the food to the service to the atmosphere. The music was fun. The beer flight was awesome and really affordable. The menu was very affordable. Great place to come with friends or family for a special occasion or just any day of the week."}
{"text":"decent food, nice place to get a cold delicious beer and some yummy German snacks. i went here right after i rode around Pittsburgh on a rented bike (you can rent them next door), and it hit the spot!"}
{"text":"I had a great time & enjoyed the establishment and beverages, until the security individual came over and yelled at us repeatedly.  I understand the importance of public safety, but he was rude, entitled, and belligerent.  I have never been so insulted.  I was hoping to enjoy the evening with my friends, but instead we left at 10:30 because the security guard was so awful.  I'm very disappointed this evening..."}
{"text":"Super fun place. You order beer by the liter, need I say more??? The pretzels and beer cheese dip are incredible!  Fun, authentic music and style, all house made brews with a great selection.   We were told it would be a half hour wait, but were able to leave our number and get a text when our table was ready. It didn't even take the 10 mins before we got the text. Our waitress, Kimmy arrived right away and was friendly and quick to smile.  A couple of liters of beer later, bellies full, you can't beat that feeling."}
{"text":"Somehow today was my first time at this Hofbrauhaus. I've been to the Munich and Sydney locations and they have done a good job in Steel Town.  Can't believe how busy it was on a Saturday at 3:00.  There are multiple locations to pull up a chair. There is a smaller room with maybe 20 tables closest to the street, which is the quietest place. The main hall easily has 50 tables and there is an outside deck with maybe another 30 tables. It appears there is another level below the deck but I'm not sure what that is used for.   Service was alright, generally fast but it seems some employees chose clothing maybe a size or two too small. Selection of beer is somewhat disappointing. Four standards and one seasonal that rotates monthly. Really? I've been to much smaller places that can put out better selection than this...   Food was alright, standard fare of Spaetzle, Pretzels, Schnitzel and Burgers. Appetizers are ridiculously priced at $10, but entrees range from $10-20 and seem more reasonable. Sandwiches and burgers are $7-9 and probably the best deal.   My favorite part was observing the German touches. If you have lived in Germany for any time, you will notice things like the picnic tables and silverware/napkins in a stein on the table that are distinctively German."}
{"text":"We had the sampler app which consisted of two pretzels, two potato pancakes, fried pickles (whaaaa?), and some kind of sour kraut ball. It was good. I had pierogis as my main dish and I would advise against it. Hubby had bierwurst. He liked it. Live music and ambience is killer which makes it a \"must see\" while visiting Pittsburgh. Oh!and BEER!!!!"}
{"text":"The covered patio overlooking the river makes for a great lunch spot. There are ceiling fans and you are out of the sun. You can watch boats go by in the river and all the cyclists moving past on the path below. I felt like I was at the German venue in Epcot with the music, the decor, the costumes, etc. Maybe it feels authentic to Germany, too. I wouldn't know because I've never been there.  Warm, soft pretzels are my #1 favorite snack and these were excellent. I would absolutely come again just to have MOAR PRETZELS!  For lunch I had some wurst with mashed potatoes and sauerkraut. All was good.  I tried a flight of all their beers, and they were all fine. Nothing incredibly memorable. Five different things gave me plenty to drink over the course of our meal. Seems like a great place to have fun with friends. I recommend this for a visit.   I'm told it gets very, very loud inside when it is busy, so this would not be great for chatting, unless you sit outside."}
{"text":"Very disappointed that they only take passports for international visitors... Who walks around with their passport!!!  Apparently its a state law... So not entirely their fault... But still. I was very disappointed."}
{"text":"To say it was perfect wouldn't be true.  The beer was great, the food not bad, but how long it took...terrible.  Thanks to Tommy our waiter, he got the manager, whom I did not get her name, delivered our meal and apologized and then took care of it.  We have had good meals before, but service was always quick...I guess it was an off night for them, but the management and server made sure we were treated properly and we will go back.  Thanks Tommy!  We will be back and looking for you!"}
{"text":"Pittsburgh's character right here.  Wiener schnitzel with German Potato Salad or sauerkraut is the way to go.   The apfel strudel with Bavarian ice cream is good way to finish your meal.  The employees wear themed costumes. At a certain time every night the restaurant plays live themed music and you can dance on your table/bench (if you're into that).  They also offer 1 liter mugs and 1 to 3 liter boot shaped mugs that can be filled with a beverage of your choice."}
{"text":"The original Hofbrauhaus is phenomenal! You have to sit in the main dining room. It's best on the weekend evening when hefeweizen has been flowing for a bit. The food is traditional German fare. From your standard schnitzel to giant pretzels with beer cheese. You really can't go wrong here. Once the music starts playing, the food is served, and the beer is flowing you will soon find yourself pounding a beer on the table yelling \"Prost\" out loud with the rest of the diners.  You have to experience this place at least once to understand, but it will be so worth it!"}
{"text":"It was love at first sip! The Hafbru Hefe Weizen is my favorite beer here. I've never been a big fan of banana flavor until I enjoyed this beer. The banana flavor is distinct but not over powering. The hint of clover brings about a balance that allows this beer to not be too sweet. This is a savoring beer. Kick back and enjoy!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place - you can't get better than this in the 'Burgh!  I've always sat outside when going here and I think it's great to be out in the open drinking some good ol' German beer.    Having been to the original Hof in Munich I can tell you it's very authentic.  The food from what I've tasted is good and the beer is delicious - I prefer Hefeweizen's so I can't comment on the other type of beers.     Seeing that this is one of three Hofbrauhaus' in the U.S. (Cincinnatti, Las Vegas, Pittsburgh), Pittsburghers should feel proud to have the opportunity to experience this wonderful place.  So grab some friends and grab a beer at the Hof - and try the pretzels with some beer cheese - delish!"}
{"text":"I get to visit the Pittsburgh area about 6 times a year.  Each time I am in town, I want to be here.  Its just a fun place with a fun atmosphere, Oh and the beer is great as well.  I've had some of the food, but I will leave it to others to review the cuisine.  And as far as the different beers go, I think they have something for all tastes.  What I want to get across with my review is the atmosphere here.  I have been there later in the evening when all are just drinking there liter beers and singing along to various tunes including some German ones.  You instantly feel transported to Oktoberfest.  It is something that is hard to replicate but they get it done.  On my last trip here I actually got to sit outside in the Biergarten area.  Incredible.  It was a gorgeous day, so that played a huge part and the river behind you just adds to the Euro feeling.  However, they have a large bar out there, plenty of tables with umbrellas and waitresses.  Oh and the restrooms are close by.  You will not be disappointed coming to the Hofbrauhaus.  I just wish I could stop by more."}
{"text":"Just went here for the first time with my family.  This place is a good time, but if you don't like the idea of an Oktoberfest kind of place with everyone drinking giant liter beers, then don't go here.  The food was good and they really stick to the German types of food.  I had a sampler of some of the wursts and pork roasts.  It was prepared to my liking and tasty.  There wasn't anything that would blow you away, but if you like German food it's a great place.  There were even some things on the menu I've never had before that were fun to try like sauerkraut balls and fried pickles.   I enjoyed their beer as well.  They have a different seasonal brew every month as well as their regulars.  All were good and stick to the German brewing rules.  For comparison though, I liked what I had here better than the similar beers one would find at Gordon Biersch.  Oh yeah, having four people do a shot off a ski in front of the whole place is a good time.  We actually had our kids along and they did great.  Plus the place is so damn loud they can make all the noise they want.  The live music was also a neat experience.  Long story short, I'd like to come back without any kids and get hammered with the crowd there that I can guess gets rowdy as the night goes on."}
{"text":"This restaurant was amazing! My family and I went here for my 21st birthday a couple of days ago and had a blast. Everyone had a good time hanging out in the spacious restaurant. Everyone enjoyed their drinks, and the food was great. I had some kind of schnitzel and loved it. Also, we ordered many appetizers: the pierogis, spinach artichoke dip, and the pretzel. All delicious!   The service was great, our waitress was tentative and made sure everything was in place. Then when it got busier more staff came out to help. The whole time there was live music playing from an accordion! This guy sung in German and enhanced the atmosphere. The only thing I would change about this place is the lack of parking. There was no parking for at least a block around the restaurant. Otherwise, we had a great time and I'd highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"It's simple. Hefeweizen brought me here and ham hocks brought my GF here. She eats and I drink. Let's rock and roll.   Food (see pic) (65%)   Taste to Price 4.5/5  Quality to Price 4/5  Portion to Price 5/5  Average = 4.5  Service (20%)    Friendliness 4/5  Promptness 2.5/5  Average = 3.3  Cleanliness (15%)   Bathroom 3/5  Dining area 4/5  Kitchen area 4/5  Average = 3.7  Overall Score = [F(.65)]+[S(.20)]+C(.15)]     = [2.9]+[0.7]+[0.6]      = 4.2  What else to know: I love this place! I'm a huge fan of hefeweizen and other Bavarian style beers. Their hefeweizen on tap was amazing especially with their wheat beer glass. We went here during happy hour so it got busy quick. Understandably service was a little slow but our waitress was very friendly.  For food, we ordered the Knusprige schweinehaxen aka the crispy pork shanks. That thing was huge! As someone said earlier, it's enough to feed 4 people. I'm glad I don't live in Pittsburgh, otherwise I would come here everyday!"}
{"text":"While their beer is good the food not so much. I've been a few times but this was the first time I ate here. I don't eat pork so the options are a little limited. I could only imagine as a vegetarian the options are even more limited!   We had the pretzels and beer cheese. The appetizer came with four pretzels definitely enough to share! I also ordered the bourbon chicken and it was just ok. Nothing special actually it tasted like something from Friday's or Applebee's. I also got the Octoberfest beer that was good.  The group I was with ate in the beer hall. There's usually a live band dressed in German garb. But the real entertainment is watching all the people that stand up on the tables to sing while raising their beer mugs!   I'll come back for a beer and to people watch but skip the food."}
{"text":"I have been to the orginal Hofbräuhaus in Muchen, Germany twice and this Pittsburgh replica is dead on considering it's age. The beer is the same formula as Germany however it IS brewed on the premises. You cannot go wrong with German food. The beer is excellent as well. I would recommend this to anyone on the mood for good food and good beer!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Hofbrauhaus is a must visit. I had a very good time, had some great beer, a nice traditional German meal and enjoyed the ambiance of 500 plus people having their time of their life.  My idea of a Beer Garden is good beer, good food, good signing and good fun. Hofbrauhaus was all this and more. As I walked in this place it was packed to the gills, but you were able to move around. Their was a wait for tables, Plan B the bar. After a few minutes, score bar seats. Let the fun begin; the beer:  Hofbräu Premium Lager was very good with 5.1% alcohol by volume. Lots of body. Nice finish.   Hofbräu Dunkel which was a dark beer with 5.5% alcohol by volume. Lots of flavor with a little spice kick. Also very nice. Lighter than most dark beers.  Hofbräu Hefe Weizen was fruity with a crisp finish. Very traditional and good. Alcohol at 5.1%  The beers were all good. They were easy to drink with lots of different characteristics. Very nice. At $5.50 a half liter, great price.  Ofenfrischer Leberkase - Thick-cut grilled pork and beef loaf topped with a fried egg and served with German potato salad. This was absolutely delicious. The pork and beef loaf was outstanding with great flavors. Never had warm German potato salad and it was a perfect compliment to the saltiness of the meat. Tangy, salty explosion of flavors. Yum. Entree was devour in less than 2 minutes; that is how good it was.  I realize that it was the weekend before Christmas, but this place was amazing with lots of fun had by a huge cross section of customers. It was as welcoming a place can be considering the huge size of the place. At different points in the evening the crowd would be signing along with the music. I know kichy, but FUN. Can't wait for a return visit and enjoy some delicious beer and food. Good job Hofbrauhaus."}
{"text":"This place can get packed.  So be prepared to wait!  However, if the biergarten is open, make sure to check it out.  Great place to grab a beer and wait for a table to open up.  Food here is, blah.  However, that's primarily b/c I hate German food.  Pretzels w/bier cheese are quite good, and make a great appetizer.  Definitely a fun place to have a beer, if you can get a table in the main hall."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.  Go on the weekend and sit in the brewhouse, order one of the house beers (I prefer the dunkel if you are into dark beers, the hefeweizen if you are into lighter beers) have some great German food and stand on your bench and sing to the accordian music.  ZIGGY ZAGGY ZIGGY ZAGGY AHOY AHOY AHOY."}
{"text":"My first review of 2018, a review I've been putting off because I wanted to give the Hofbrauhaus a second chance. But I can't go back. Was it the food, no, I enjoyed the huge pretzel and variety of flavorful mustards to dip the perfectly crunchy on the outside, chewy on the inside offering was. The beer was fine if that was you next thought. I had a sampling of all their beers which were all different in their own rights.   I'm not a huge fan of the South Side Works, but that wasn't the reason either. It was in fact that this place was over run with college students and it's noisy. I don't dislike college students mind you, it's just that they tend to take over. As I age, the bars I want to frequent need to be quiet, peaceful and if there are Televisions they need to be set to sports or CNBC. Lol.   It's not the fault of this establishment that I don't like the place, it was just built too close to two major campuses in the Burgh."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere, quick service, seated outside, just a wonderful restaurant!  Will go back again someday!!!"}
{"text":"Huge portions of delicious food. I've tried many dishes here and I've never been disappointed. The food combined with the ambience makes it a perfect place for a large group."}
{"text":"Great beer and great food! I've been to the original in Munich and this is nearly as good an experience. On a Saturday night, it fills up quickly with standing room only, so show up early and stay all night. Once the band gets going, people start dancing on the tables and having a great time."}
{"text":"Excellent German food and beer.  Awesome ambience, great for a lively night out.  When the weather is good, the biergarten is about as good as it gets for outside dining & drinking in Pittsburgh.  An all-around awesome place to go."}
{"text":"Tried the beer sampler here and it was good. My wife had one of there pretzels and loved it. I am not a fan of pretzels myself though. Nice atmosphere with huge picnic like tables. I think it would depend on time of day and live band or not if you would want to bring your kids. We were there in the afternoon and it was quite."}
{"text":"Fun! Great place to cut loose with friends that will stand up on benches and sing like their in the shower. Add beer and German food and you have yourself a full evening."}
{"text":"I wish there were a couple more of these places throughout the country. Amazing, genuine German food coupled with some of the best German beer there is."}
{"text":"This place confuses my sense of what is right and wrong.  The food is gross, the beer is gross...and yet the beer is so cheap, and there's soooo much of it.  This place has become notorious for getting people drunk enough that they end up murdering somebody with their car.  But I'm not really sure who is really to blame.  Any other bar if you say, \"I'm going to stop by for a couple beers,\" you'll have a wonderful time.  Here, you will be totally fucked.  Because for real, a whole liter of beer for 9 dollars is a God Damn good value, but nobody should consume anything based on liter amounts.  The crowd varies from massive douchebags from the local colleges or new grads just getting blathered at the bar, to sweet old couples and families who actually love polka music, but everybody seems to be having a good time.  The music is fun.  The service is pretty great, and to be honest, the few times I've been here when it's really crowded, there hasn't been any overly rowdy behavior, so the security presence was probably a good idea.  The food, as I said is really very gross.  And there is a thing called the Hot Brown, which makes me immediately think about what's going to be happening to my body at some point in the future.  Don't call something the 'Hot Brown' unless you're a Doctor trying to explain diarrhea to a child as gently as possible.  Other things are not so bad, and I'll admit that at a certain level of intoxication, I will shamelessly eat a plate of sausages like I'm in an eating contest with the devil.  Points as well for the beer garden in the back.  Go here to get drunk, eat gross things, and listen to an old sweetie play polka cover and traditional songs.  But get a fucking designated driver if you're a Dbag that's just going to end up murdering somebody with your car."}
{"text":"We have been here several times for the atmosphere-which is one-of-a-kind but just recently had dinner here. The german potato salad was excellent! We shared the platter of pork chops, brats, sauerkraut, & potatoes and for 2 people it was more than enough food-we couldn't finish it all! They also have the live german music playing in the main dining hall. After dinner, be sure to go onto the outdoor patio area and take in the great views of the river & city."}
{"text":"I like the Hofbrauhaus a lot.  There aren't that many of them in the world, so we're lucky to have one!  That being said, we only visit once or twice a year, usually in the fall as we're fans of their Oktoberfest brew.  The pretzels are great, and my husband had the Jagerschnitzel which he said was amazing.  I honestly don't know how these people expect you to eat a meal after a half liter of beer and two soft pretzels, so I ordered a side of beer cheese spaetzle for dinner.  It's SO GOOD!    I definitely recommend sitting in the biergarden if it's nice out--you don't have to wait, it's self seating, the service is fast and they have a full bar down there as well.  There are twinkly lights strung up between the trees, plenty of bench seating, and you get a view of the river.  Not to mention you don't have to do the chicken dance down there. :)"}
{"text":"the pretzels and beer cheese are a big plus. great beer and if the drunken singing isn't for you theres a great outside patio area. i came here on a friday night and was thrown off by having to wait in a line to get inside but nevertheless, i would go back if i was with a large group."}
{"text":"I get the idea. Meant to feel like Germany. Crowded and bad beer."}
{"text":"One more chain to avoid.  Went here to sample German fare in the beer garden-  great atmosphere by the river-  beer was not as good as I expected and food was bad, even the pretzel tasted like it was served at the ballpark.  I had brats and they were salty and average-  the schnitzel was over cooked- the red cabbage was from a jar. The potato pancakes were greasy- no homefries which I love with schnitzel- and no veal-   Not worth the crowds, the price or the hype.  It reminded me of Disneyland without the rides -big disappointment."}
{"text":"The beer is delicious and each month of the year they feature a different brew. We didn't get a chance to try much of the food there, but the appetizer sampler was really good. It was mostly fried items, but those potato pancakes.... OMG, they were soo good! Wished we had the chance to try some of the other dishes, but we were just filled after the sampler plate. Would definitely come here again since the food looked soo good from the other tables. If you're looking to have fun and plan on having a few drinks in place that provides live music on the weekends, then this is the place of for you"}
{"text":"I've always found this place to be a tourist trap.  The service is awful and it's completely overpriced.  This is always a stay away bar for me when visiting the South Side."}
{"text":"I waited over 30 minutes for nachos and they were cold and very unsatisfactory.  The chips were stale and the cheese had hardened. Would not recommend food here."}
{"text":"Went to Hofbrauhaus for lunch as well as late night for drinks. Excellent beer, great service, and unique atmosphere. Outside seating has a pleasant view of the river. The place gets real crowded and loud as the night begins but that is to be expected.   These all sound good until we start talking about food quality. The food was sub-par for its price. If you are looking for authentic German food, you would be disappointed. Nonetheless, I'd recommend getting beer there. If you don't mind crazy crowd, stop by late night to see people singing, stomping on the tables, and getting obnoxious (or you can join the drunks). As for the food? Check out Max's Allegheny Tavern instead."}
{"text":"Don't come here for the food.  It's friggin' German food with cheese sauce galore.  Great beer though.  I don't like anything but the Dunkel, but maybe you'll find one you like.  The rotating selection is nice for a surprise sometimes -- and any place that serves a litre deserves a thumbs up.  Good sausage, potatoes, but the cheese sauce is a bowel wrecker."}
{"text":"Inconsistent at best!   I've had really good experiences here and really bad ones.  Food: it's ok depending on what you get. I've had amazing chicken in the bier cheese chicken but way over cooked when getting the bourbon chicken.   Atmosphere: exactly what you'd expect. A traditional German style beer hall with picnic-style seating and a few booths. Your best bet would be the upstairs balcony...NOT the downstairs gravel lot. I like when they have live ethnic music.  Service: not great, not bad. I feel bad that hey have to wear the cheesy get-ups.   Overall: a little overpriced and touristy, but a definite must-visit when in the burgh, however, if you live here, it's probably not your first choice.   Ps. They have a little gift shop by the entrance/exit...again, a bit overpriced, but you can find some cool stuff."}
{"text":"I know that this place is not \"authentic,\" but I really don't care. As a Florida native, I grew up with chain restaurants and an occasional local Mexican place. German food was not just scarce, but nearly impossible to find in The Sunshine State.  I had been to two other German restaurants in Georgia and North Carolina before trying Hofbrauhaus right after we moved to Pittsburgh a couple years ago. The restaurants were in cliche \"German\" house-style locations and featured mediocre food only enjoyed by true German food lovers. At the Atlanta location, I turned up my nose to most of the food and remember nibbling on a cold pretzel for most of the evening.  Hofbrauhaus could not be any more different! It has four wonderfully unique sections of the restaurant - formal dining, bier hall, patio, and bier garden. I enjoy the bier hall earlier in the evening before it transforms into a bar, and the patio for late nights and spring/fall weather. Plus, it's covered, so we've even dined out there when it was raining.  The beer is great. My personal favorite is the Hefe Weizen - a delicious wheat beer with a light banana flavor. I also enjoy the Dunkel, their dark lager that hits the spot when the weather is cooler. Each month, they have a different monthly beer, and I look forward to Oktoberfest all year. Make sure to order it early in the month of September in case they run out!  I highly recommend The Works Sampler - pretzels, fried pickles, potato pancakes, and sauerkraut balls, all served with a complementary dip. It's a great appetizer to share with a group of four. Most of the entrees are between $10-15, which I think is very fair for the location and quantity of food. If ordering an appetizer, I would split an entree or sandwich with someone. My husband and I often split the Reuben or Schnitzel Sandwich, which are only $10 and plenty big enough for the two of us. Finally, though you probably won't have room, the Apfel Streudel is fantastic and definitely worth stretching your stomach just a little bit more for.  I would question myself if I was truly in the minority regarding my opinion of this restaurant... but all of our Southern friends and family adore this place. Everyone who comes back for a second visit has requested - even almost begged - to come back here. Several friends and family members have even returned to Florida in search of a similar German place and have been unsuccessful. Maybe it's because we don't have \"refined\" German palates, but I don't care... This restaurant has made several of us (including myself) who thought we hated German food now become a huge fan. And any restaurant that changes my mind about an entire genre is a gem in my opinion."}
{"text":"I was visiting Pittsburgh early October and came here during a night of drinking. It is very authentic and had a lot of fun here. They had a band in the front playing German songs and everyone was sitting/standing on the benches singing along. I recommend trying the pretzel and beer cheese because it is life changing. I've never had beer cheese so creamy and delicious. Ziggy zaggy ziggy zaggy OYE OYE OYE!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The location is good but its impossible to find parking. The food is great but they don't offer mustard without a 2$ upcharge which is just ridiculous. The beer is great but the staff should be trained better on what they're telling the customers. Still, great place to grab some Bavarian food."}
{"text":"I really liked the beer selection at the Hofbrauhaus. The food was decent, however, there was not much of a variety. I would still recommend going here."}
{"text":"I have lived in Pittsburgh all of my life and have only been here once. My boyfriend and I went the other night and it was on Thursday. We only went for a drink and because I have never been there. The service was great and we got a seat at the bar right away. Little did we know, it was $3.00 beer night at 9 o'clock. Once we sat down for a minute and relaxed, we saw the band and I got excited. I have heard you can dance on the tables with your beer and have a great time. Once I looked up, I saw a rush of people coming in (mostly college students). It was a lot of fun and great atmosphere, just really crowded.  Since it got so busy we only got the pretzel appetizer with their beer cheese. Neither of us typically like beer cheese but we liked theirs! It was really good. We will definitely be back to try more food.  It is a great place for groups of people. I would recommend a table with a group of people rather than the bar on a night like that. Overall, it was great!"}
{"text":"Went here during Octoberfest with a bunch of close friends where we all had a blast. Best part was everyone was on top of their bench singing along with the band! Traditional beer garden with excellent seating both outdoor and indoor."}
{"text":"We came here the other weekend with a fairly large group of friends (including a few of their small kids). I have been to the Hofbrauhaus in Cincinnati and done the crazy dude bro drink-and-stand-on-the-tables-all-night experience....for this outing, however, my friends and I came here on a tame Sunday evening for dinner.  Despite it being a Sunday, the atmosphere was still fairly festive, with a loud accordion player gleefully playing German tunes through the hall. Luckily, our big group was seated a bit off to the side out of the main dining room by the bar, so we were still able to hear ourselves talk and think. This was my first time being in the Pittsburgh location, and it looks like it would be really beautiful in the summer -- they have a gorgeous outdoor space that overlooks the river. Unfortunately it was February, so all I could do was look longingly at the patio and wish for warmer days.  So as I mentioned, I came with a fairly large group of friends, which included 3 toddlers. I'm not sure if this made our table undesirable or whatever, but the service was pretty abysmal. Our waitress took forever to take our orders, rarely came over to refill our drinks, and just in general pretty much ignored us the entire time. I don't know if she was just a terrible waitress or if she thought maybe the effort-reward ratio was not favorable enough to put up with such a large group. But either way, it was highly annoying to everyone and soured our experience.  As for the food, it was pretty pricey and was on par with the quality you'd find at, say, an Applebee's. Very run of the mill. I got the Dunkel Bourbon chicken sandwich with a potato pancake in place of the fries. The sandwich was unremarkable -- the chicken breast was oddly shaped (way too thick and too short), so it didn't fill the bun at all. The bourbon sauce didn't have much dimension to it -- it was mostly sweet, with only the slightest hint of tang from the bourbon. Although the sandwich was a bust, I did enjoy the potato pancake -- it was crispy without being greasy and had a delicious onion-flavored potato filling. My friends also felt pretty ambivalent about their meals -- the reuben, the schnitzel sandwich -- every item my group ordered was met with a \"mehh.\" Not terrible but not great (especially for the price).  So my takeaway from this experience is that this is not a place to target if all you're in the market for is a good dinner. Perhaps their wheelhouse is beer and merriment, but food and service definitely ain't it."}
{"text":"The food is great, the music is great, the beer is great, the staff is great and the atmosphere is great....I really like it here if you can't tell! Hofbrauhaus is always a fun time if you're looking for tasty food and entertainment. Heads up-Thursday night is college night and it's usually very busy when school is in session"}
{"text":"There is now happy hour, with specials on appetizers and the standard beers! Yay! Also wanted to mention that the lunch buffet is excellent, with a great salad bar, 2 soup options, several wursts (with curry sauce available!), schnitzel, mashed potatoes, German potato salad, fried cabbage, and a rotating meat entree available for ablut $13."}
{"text":"Mmmm......pretzels and.bier cheese [said in a Homer Simpson voice].  And of course the beer and environment are incredible.  Sitting outside on the river celebrating the start of Oktoberfest."}
{"text":"Pretzels And Bier Cheese is a must. College Night on thursday is also the best deal around. The band almost never stops playing and people are up and on their seats by 9:30. The bench seating makes it a great place for big groups, and the outside seating by the river is great in the summer and late afternoons."}
{"text":"This place just makes me want to go to Germany! I love beer and I gotta say the wide selection of beers is great. It's so nice to have so much to choose from. The food is also really good. I think all the items I have tried have been great"}
{"text":"Fantastic food, decent draft beer! My girlfriends and I were there on a Friday for the live band (dressed in lederhosen!). We had a blast dancing on our benches and they even sang the song we requested. Good service and hospitality. Awesome experience all around. Would highly recommend, especially if you're german!"}
{"text":"Good beer and food. However, most of the time when I order a liter of beer it has lots of head (foam) and by the time it subsides I get a third of a liter of beer. I can see a 1 - 1 1/2 inch head but 2-3 inches is not acceptable. Paying $10.50 for a beer and I get a third!"}
{"text":"If you love german food you will love this place. I seem to only go when I can sit outside in the beer garden due to the overwhelming noise inside. The service is a bit slow outside also... so why a 4 star then? The beer is great and the atmosphere is fun. Go knowing that you better get pretzels as soon as they seat you because food will be a long wait. You will enjoy yourself more."}
{"text":"I was in town visiting some friends and they brought me to the Hofbrauhaus. It was alot of fun. It's a traditional German beer hall with the long tables, the 1 liter beer mugs, and wait staff in traditional German costume. The beer was of course great German beer made by Hofbrau and the food was excellent. I ordered a bratwurst dinner that came with mashed potatoes and sauerkraut. I thought the prices were reasonable and the service was good. We ordered pretzels for an appetizer that were perfect. The place can get loud but its expected in a German beer hall."}
{"text":"Super packed on weekend nights. Great beer with lots of choices!... If you can get to the bar.  There was a very long line for the bar tonight so we each only had two drinks within about 2 hours.  Didn't eat here, only went for drinks but the food looked like standard pub food. Exciting atmosphere, even a live band tonight!"}
{"text":"Great drink selections. Creative delivery of the drinks. Service was fast and attentive! Food was delicious every time."}
{"text":"I still don't get the fascination with Hofbräuhaus. Working close by has led to countless happy hours there, and living close by has led to meeting friends there quite a bit...which means I've been there a lot, but rarely because it was my destination of choice.  First, the beer is good and plentiful. Heck, depending on the monthly brew, the beer is sometimes REALLY good, and the food is decent. I've never eaten an actual meal at Hofbräuhaus, but I've tried almost all of their apps since I'm typically there for happy hour, and they're all pretty good. Fried pickles, fried sauerkraut balls, soft pretzels with beer cheese...I mean, what's there to complain about? The perfect app menu for beer-accompaniment.  Unfortunately, Hofbräuhaus loses me with the atmosphere. I'm fully aware that it's the atmosphere that is supposed to be the draw, and based on the crowds they get, it's working. Perhaps I've outgrown the old get-drunk-then-stand-on-a-table-and-toast-in-a-language-that-I-don't-really-know stage of my life, but I often find the main room of Hofbräuhaus to be loud and obnoxious as opposed to celebratory. Granted, I prefer being able to hear the people I'm talking to, and I don't need a random Tuesday in the Spring to feel like Octoberfest, but based on the number of people that go to Hofbräuhaus, I'm clearly in the minority.  The safe bet for a good time at Hofbräuhaus for those of us looking for a more relaxed experience that takes advantage of the positives of Hofbräuhaus while skipping the annoying, is this: get a small group of friends and hit the outside beer garden when the weather is nice. There are few things more relaxing than partaking in a delicious liter of beer in the beer garden...next to the river...on a sunny day. If the weather isn't cooperating, another option is to get there early before the craziness starts in the evenings, but regardless of how happy the tunes from the accordion might sound, the drab environment just never does it for me."}
{"text":"Our first time here. I ordered sauerbraten.  It was excellent. If you are used to German food, it was very good, not near \"sour\" enough for me however. Atmosphere is traditional German family style with loud music and friendly atmosphere. Service however was horrible. Saw our waitress only twice in a two hour period. Everyone's glass was empty and needed refills. Everyone enjoyed their food however. We will likely be back and hope for better service next time around."}
{"text":"I admit that I've been putting off a trip to Hofbrauhaus for a long time. It wasn't that I was against going there, per say, but my absolute hatred of the South Side Works and what is offered there--both establishments and personalities--made me think I would loath it just because of its location. But my affinity for beer, especially beer in giant glass mugs, and the fact that it was the location of one of my good friends 25th birthday party celebration finally brought me in.  I arrived sometime around 11 on a Friday night to a line circling around the side of the building. At once I thought my fears were confirmed, a long line of what I perceived to be South Side douche bags. But as I got closer I realized that it wasn't just a bunch of frat boys in line, but there were people of all ages and all walks of life waiting to get in. On top of that the line moved very quickly and all in all only spent about five minutes waiting to get inside.  Once inside I made my way to the bar area, which was much more spacious than I thought it would be. That being said, Hofbrauhaus was still extremely crowded leaving little room to stand without bumping in to someone or having someone bump in to you. The dense crowd also left long waits for beer. The bartending staff tried their best to keep up, but there is only so much they can do when you have hundreds of people making human sardines around the bar all trying to order a beer at the same time.  I ordered a liter of Dunkel, and when it was finally served to me, tasted pretty good. I'm not all that familiar with German style beers so I'm in no position to comment on its quality, but from an amateur perspective I thought it possessed a strong and unique flavor. The price for a liter wasn't bad, especially considering the location of Hofbrauhaus. I believe the \"big mug\" ran somewhere between $7 and $8. I wish I would have had more time to try a few of the other brews but I didn't get the chance.  The atmosphere of Hofbrauhaus is a bit more rowdy than I expected. Long rows of thick wooden tables and benches line the open space between the bar and the stage which aren't used for sitting but instead standing upon. From this perch one feels like he or she is the life of the party singing songs and swinging mugs about, beer sloshing out like a geyser.  The band was lively, fun, dressed in authentic Bavarian dress, and I could tell they really did have a passion for the music they were playing, but I was really hoping for something a big more authentic. Most of the songs they played were American covers, nothing but a few songs were German.  My experience at Hofbrauhaus was a lot better than I originally thought it would be. It wasn't as much of a corporate juggernaut bar like many of the other bars in the South Side Works area, even though the amount of people they allow to be packed in at once makes you wonder if they care more about their profits or the experiences of their patrons. Will I come back? Probably yes, but only from time to time. I much prefer smaller less crowded and noisy bars, but if I have to pick a larger venue bar Hofbrauhaus would be the place."}
{"text":"this is a great place to go to on a Friday and Saturday night. They have music, Dancing, and they have a great way to bring people together. The beer is great and the food is really good, if you enjoy german food of course. The servings are well worth it. I am not sure that this would be a great place for first date, but it is a great place to go with a group of friends and celebrate an occasion. They have out door seating during the warmer months. The ambiance is nice and open. over all a thumbs up."}
{"text":"Went here to celebrate birthday party for my brother- beer great unfortunately kids night.  We got here at 7pm, did not receive our food until 920, food was a free for all- they had no clue what people ordered and all of the food came out at different times, im finished with my meal now, ordered a steak medium it came cooked more than well done- i finished 15 minutes ago unfortunately my grandfather is still waiting for his dinner.  I couldnt even finish my dinner because it was so bad so im outside smoking a cigarette while the rest of family is waiting on their food- some have been done for past hour.  Pretty pissed at this place for ruining my brothers birthday especially with the whole family here.  If i wasnt enjoying the beer it would have definately scored a 0 or a 1.  We have money to pay for meals so i dont really care if our meal is comped, im just upset that we will not be able to spend another family dinner here."}
{"text":"Came here for some brews after dinner! This place is a lot of fun! Hey have live music with a great German band and it's a very casual and fun environment. They serve the traditional German haufbrau beers hat came in either the .5 or 1L beer steins. I always go with the original lager. This haifbrau house in particular is a lot more lively and more fun than others"}
{"text":"Hofbrauhaus is definitely a novelty restaurant and not somewhere I would frequent.   The environment is interesting where they take on the full atmosphere of an old German beer hall. I don't even know what those would be like but I imagine that it's most similarly like this. The women were clad in scantily short skirts and dresses that really highlighted their boobs. I don't think anyone could have been safe from those...  Anyway, the food. My friends got the Dunkel Bourbon Chicken and Schnitzel sandwich while I got the garden burger. First of all, it was hard enough trying to find something on the menu when everything was unpronounceable. The food itself was okay, the garden burger wasn't my taste because it seemed like they tried to put a mexican-style spin on it while still trying to keep the german flair. My friends seemed to enjoy the Schnitzel and Bourbon Chicken but the mashed potatoes were nothing special and she left the entire thing on her plate.   Overall, I would definitely take someone here purely for their aesthetics but probably wouldn't come here anytime otherwise."}
{"text":"Tons of fun, great live music, food almost authentic. Sausages and schnitzels were great. Beer disappointing out of the better flavors and were waiting for days to tap new beer, friday and Saturday nights Rock."}
{"text":"If possible, I would want to divide this review into three separate portions: the food, the beer, and the atmosphere due to the fact each of these components would get a different rating from me. To sum up the food: 1.5 stars. I've tried several of their more traditional German items (Jagerschnitzel, sauerbraten, sauerkraut balls, and bratwursts) in addition to a few of their sandwiches (the Dunkel chicken sandwich and the pretzel sandwich) and have been very underwhelmed each time. It's always too salty, too greasy, and flavorless. I've tried some of the apps as well (sauerkraut balls and pretzels) and the pretzels, while they taste like those giant super pretzels you'll find in the freezer section of the grocer, are the only thing I will now order when here and only if I absolute need something to munch on with my beverage. The biercheese, again is overly salty, and was served practically ice cold on this last visit. We just used the regular old spicy Heinz mustard for dipping instead.   The beer, in addition to the atmosphere of the biergarten, is really the only reason why I personally come here. I would rate the beer at 3 stars. Out of their standard fare beers, I enjoy the Hefeweizen the most. I love the hint of  banana flavor and wheat beers are my second favorite (after IPAs of course!), and I highly recommend this option if you enjoy a wheat. It is perfect on a hot spring or summer day! They always have a \"beer of the month\" too, which happened to be a Maibock this month. I'm not really into the darker beers, and since that is mostly what is available here, I can't really comment on the darker ones myself, however my friends that enjoy darker beers rave about them, particularly the dunkel.   The atmosphere, particularly the outside Biergarten, is my favorite element of Hofbrauhaus. \"I don't like to sit outside on a beautiful day and enjoy a cold beverage\"-said no one ever! Or at least I hope no one ever......Anyways, it's beautiful near the river where you can watch the boats go by or people making use of the riverfront trail. You can also exit the biergarten right onto the riverwalk where the docks are located. Some of the tables have umbrellas which provided some much needed shade this past Sunday when it was 90 degrees outside! There are servers for the tables or you can enjoy watching a game at the bar, which is also a shaded refuge.   Just a note about my most recent visit this past Sunday afternoon. I went to use the restroom in the Biergarten and there was a female server literally having a melt down, screaming and swearing up a storm on her phone (to her mother since it was impossible to NOT hear her end of the \"conversation\" and I'm sure her mother really appreciated this on Mother's Day) about having to work out in the Biergarten and how she wasn't going to make any money because it was a Sunday, and she just \"couldn't do this anymore\". While it's not like this really bothered me,I just thought-obviously-it was extremely unprofessional to behave in that manner, particularly in the bathroom where paying customers could hear and see her. In this day of technology, I'm sure her whole cuss-word filled rant could have been communicated via text messaging. Just saying.   So in summary, come for the atmosphere, enjoy a beer or two, and I'd advise skipping the food in favor of one of the many other options in the South Side."}
{"text":"I sincerely wanted to like this place.  I have been there 4 or 5 times, always with the same result: exceptionally below average.   The ambience is cute, with the waiters in Lederhosen and the waitresses in drindles, and a seemingly-authentic menu.  The beer is above average, but barely.   Now to the food.  Without the beer, I would give zero stars.  Absolutely horrendous.  The few standouts were the fried cabbage and weisswurst.   The weiner schnitzel was well below average.  The kraut was cold and bland.  \"imported\" or not.  The pork cutlets were so incredibly dry that even gravy couldn't save them.  Cute try at a German bierhall, but the food is awful.  If you are looking for authentic German fare without the Lederhosen and tacky decorations, go to Max's Allegheny Tavern on the North Side.  They have been doing it well since 1903, when the area was called \"Deutschtown\" because of the large number of German immigrants."}
{"text":"3.5 experience. First dinner in Pittsburgh! Also, my first time trying German food!   Party of 4, reservation at 7 pm. TBH, it was pretty empty when we came...but I hear it gets hella packed later at night and on weekends!   Parking: street or parking structure a block away. The area is still under renovation, so please pardon the dust.   Menu: extensive and the font is hard to read (LOL). Separated into:  appetizers, soups, salads, side dishes, burgers & sandwiches, HB specialties, Wurstl, Schnitzel, and Haus favorite.   TLDR;  Service: 4/5- Ladies were super nice and gave us ample time to order. But, they did forget us halfway through the meal...  Ambiance: 4/5- indoor has a country band playing on stage, and a really nice bar with huge beer tanks. Outdoor seating that overlooks the river. They even have games on the bottom floor! The area is a new shopping center, so you should walk around after your meal if it isn't too dark or chilly! There is also a running trail behind the restaurant.   Quality of food: 3/5- maybe this isn't my type of food, but for what it's worth, I would only categorize this as \"American traditional\".   Pricing: 3.5/5- pretty reasonable for the quantity you get! Alcohol is also decently priced.   We finally ordered:   SOUPS 1. 2 Kartoffelsuppe (creamy potato soup) // YUM! Isn't this just like clam chowder without the clams? 2. 1 gulaschuppe (beef stew with tomato/paprika base) // YUM! Maybe because I was on the plane all day, but this settled my tummy.  SPECIALTIES 1. Scheweinebraten (slow cooked pork roast) // Oh wow, big portion! I actually really like the pork. Kind of reminds me of pork loin though? Potato dumpling was not bad...why are people obsessed with this?  2. Sauerbraten (marinated beef) // Oh boy...too much red wine sauce. The beef was also too dry...but the sides were good!  3. Dunkel bourbon salmon (pan seared Atlantic salmon fillet) // Yum! Fresh. Also came with some steamed vegetables.   WURSTL 1. Wurstplate (bierwurst, bratwurst, frankfurter) // I'm not into sausages...my friend ordered this and finished it clean though!  HAUS FAVORITE 1. Half rack of baby back ribs // YUMMM. I haven't had good ribs in forever!!! I like. Better than other places I've had in CA!   Overall, interesting dining experience. I wouldn't mind coming here for some big portion, comfort food! However, quality does sacrifice. Everything is hella rich in flavor...maybe too much."}
{"text":"I went here for a work gathering after an all day meeting in Pittsburgh. We went here because one of our colleagues is the accordion player in the band.It has a reputation of bring a fun place with lots of German beer. I enjoyed the food and wine as well. The German  music was pretty authentic as the band (including my colleague Mike Grk) played anything the audience requested that was a German song.  The band even has some groupees. In all, a fun place to have dinner and drinks in good old Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Really good German style food and great beer.  But the atmosphere is what really makes this place great.  The beer garden is one of the best places in Pittsburgh on a nice summer evening.  The inside can be loud and raucous, especially on the weekends.  If you're looking for a good time, this is the place."}
{"text":"Great beer (especially their Dunkel , a dark lager), good Oompah band for music, good service.  The sauerkraut and ham ball appetizers, the fried pickles, soft pretzels and potato pancakes were delicious.  The wait was 75 minutes so we didn't stay for dinner.  If you want camaraderie singing along to Sweet Caroline while drinking a good brew than this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Good beer. Good pretzels with bier cheese. Good environment. All in all, a good place for some German grub and drinks.   On the other hand, this place definitely attracts the rowdier crowd. With it's long, shared tables, raucous clientele, and live music on the weekends it's not an environment for the faint of heart."}
{"text":"Drinks are good and food is good as well. It's a lot of heavy food. But the atmosphere is great and the servers are friendly"}
{"text":"Went there because I've been wanting to try it for a bit now. They had a sign up that said to seat ourselves, which we did. However, we were completely ignored for a solid ten minutes before getting service. I had the sampler platter. All great food, def would recommend. I also had the litre of the hefe weizen which was an incredible beer. There was a special event on patio which seemed to have all the workers attention."}
{"text":"First time going and it was great!  Food was incredible and atmosphere too!  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times in the past, but today was the first time I ever came for the lunch buffet (I had a coupon for $2 off).  The buffet was all you can eat, and included a nice salad bar, and a small selection of German foods, such as schnitzel, spätzle, three kinds of meats including brats, a wurst, (and I forget the name of the other one), cabbage, sauerkraut, German potato salad, mashed potatoes, two kinds of soups, and rolls with butter.  The only thing missing, in my opinion, were potato pancakes (kartoffelpuffer).   The beer was not included in the buffet, and today I had the August brew, \"Sommer Weizen\" (5.6 % Alc. by Volume, which is a darker, maltier version of the Weizen bier with hints of banana and clove).  I enjoyed the buffet, but would probably prefer to order an entree off of the menu next time.  Today was the first time I sat outside on the veranda, and it was pleasant sitting outside, watching the river and people go by on the nearby river trail.  Nice place for lunch, but no live music today, I guess that is only for when the bier hall is full of people.  Prost!"}
{"text":"Hofbrauhaus is always a fun place to go, whether you're inside or out. I've never gotten a full meal, just appetizers and beer. The beer is good, I wish they had a bigger selection though. The appetizers are on the small size and seem commercialized, which gives me the impression that's how their food would be."}
{"text":"Pittsburgh is lucky to have a Hofbrauhaus. I wish we had this establishment in Jersey. It just made every beer garden I know a boring joke. This place is legit--complete with staff members with outfits, live accordion music, and well, of course, German food and lots and lotsa beer. It's such a fun place. The food's pretty good and affordable and so as the drinks. I'm totally a fan."}
{"text":"Maybe during Oktoberfest you'd get the \"Disney\" like experience others talked about (which would also be lame), but, on the night we came it was just lame.  Walked into some old guy playing keyboard version of Journey's \"Don't stop believing\" and a few young dudes standing on tables, swaying back and forth singing along.  The whole of Pittsburgh doesn't have enough polka outfits to pay each to play one night of the week?   I had German friends complain at how ridiculous Hofbrauhaus in Munich was, but if they saw this, I think they'd want to shoot themselves.  Also, I found the original in Munich not so bad- decent prices, decent food, and mostly full of older german couples or men!  Maybe during Oktoberfest it's awful, but I liked it.   This was just pathetic- the \"german dishes\" were quite frankly terrible.  I forget which sausage my husband ordered, but he said it tasted just like breakfast links.  I ordered the kasespaetzle, a dish I ate a lot of and liked in Germany.  The two versions can't even be compared.  This one was full of nearly raw onions and tasted like it was covered in alfredo sauce, and was pretty much one big lump of doughy noodle.  The only reason it's getting 2 stars is because the beer was good (though not being a beer connoisseur I can't really compare to the original).  I was a little peeved when I wanted to order a radler (my other favorite in Munich, along with the mushroom and potato dumplings which were absent from the menu here) and my 20something should be at TGI Fridays waitress gave me a blank look.   I didn't go here for fun or spectacle, and that is where I went wrong.  Maybe it'd be more up my alley if I ordered a \"shot-ski\" and burned off my tastebuds."}
{"text":"Great spot on the Mon!  Excellent beer and food. We are regulars here and service has consistently been very good. Check out the steinmaster club and get your own locker. Pork Porterhouse and Schnitzels are the way to go!"}
{"text":"What do Munich, Las Vegas, and Pittsburgh have in common? They're each home to the authentic Hofbrauhaus German bier garden.  I was pretty excited to hear about the recent opening of the Hofbrauhaus in the ever expanding Southside Works development.  This place is absolutely massive.  I'm not exagerating when I say that they can probably fit 1000 people between the two indoor dining rooms and the two huge patios.  The long wooden benches in the main dining hall are simply designed for mass, communal consumption of beer.  And really, that's what you want to do here.  Hofbrau beer is served in half liter and full liter glass steins, and it is good.  My favorite is the hefewiesen (wheat beer).  It's one of the best hefeweisens I've ever had.  I also tried the seasonal Maibock on my most recent visit.  It had nice body, but at over 7% alcohol by volume, you're not going to finish too many liters of this before you hit the floor.  The Dunkel (literally, dark beer) was also good.  I don't know if they serve it in the main dining hall, but I'm hoping that they serve beer in the 2 liter glass \"boots\" that they sell in the gift shop.  Back in the day, when I used to live in Madison, WI, there was a German beer hall called the Essen Haus that used to serve beer in these two liter beauties.  There was a game we played with the boot where everyone at the table would take a drink and then pass it to the next person.  If you passed it on, and the next person finished the boot, you had to buy the next boot.  From what I can recall, it was a good time...  As for the food, well, it's German...  If you like wienerschnitzel, bratwurst, and sauerbraten, then you'll be in heaven.  Personally, I find German food heavy and bland, but that's just me.  The pretzels and beer cheese were a great appetizer.  Perfect beer food.  One of my dining companions ordered the \"Hot Brown\" (Turkey and swiss cheese over a potato pancake, covered in beer cheese and, oh, yeah, bacon).  It was really good, but dense.  In summary, go here with a large group of beer lovers and drink yourself silly on good (reasonably priced - $7/liter) German beer.  Fire down a few pretzels to soak up the alcohol.  Das ist gut."}
{"text":"I'm a beer loving girl.  Ever since I was a child I would steal a sip of my dad's frosty mug when he wasn't looking.  Now that I'm an adult and of legal drinking age, visiting Hofbrauhaus Pittsburgh I'm allowed to have a liter of beer,  or as I call it \"beer as big as your face,  without the lecture.   With an accordion player dressed in lederhosen and women with corsets pushing up their assets, you feel like you've been transported on a European vacation.  German comfort food is on the menu with a little American flair. It's a destination spot - obviously I bring my Dad every time he visits Pittsburgh to make up for all of those stolen beers over the years.  Typically the only food I order are Bavarian pretzels and bier cheese.  The food isn't the best, but the beer makes me nostalgic.    If you're looking to get the full experience,  stop by on the first Wednesday of the month - its keg tapping day!  New beer is unveiled,  a parade of men and women playing instruments and waving flags while bringing out the first new keg of the month.  If you arrive early enough (say 6pm) you can get a table and stand in line for a free first taste of the beer.  That tower of mugs will be filled with a frothy brew and I'll have a big smile on my face.  If you're looking for something off the beaten path and feel a bit parched,  fill your mug up with some bier at Hofbrauhaus.  PROST!"}
{"text":"Awesome Sauerbraten. Simply put this is a great place with great food. Good beer and wonderful staff. This is my second time here and if I lived in Pittsburgh I'd be a regular. It's worth driving 50 miles for. The strudel is straight from Germany and worth saving room for. Get the vanilla bean ice cream and you'll be happy.  If your only here for a day, eat here. Unless you just flew in from Germany."}
{"text":"If you want beer and bro time, this is the place to go. Headed here for a colleagues going away party and that's all you see from one end of the patio to another. Not my idea of fun, but it could be yours! If that's what you're looking for- give it a shot!"}
{"text":"Better beer to be had.  Hofbrauhaus is still pretty new and I admit the noisy part of the place is a lot of fun.  I found the beers to be only so-so.  Get the pretzels with beer chesse.  They're really good.  This is the kind of place you go very infrequently with a large group.  One time I was there we were seated next to people who really were not into the vibe.  A real killjoy but a risk you take in a beer hall type of place.  Prices were reasonable.  Can be very crowded."}
{"text":"Walking into this place took me back to Germany, where I was stationed for three years. Very authentic, very Duetches, the girls wearing traditional dresses and bier by the litre or the halb. Und der vas a man playing polka, albeit I was spared lederhosen.      Started out with the German potato soup, fantastich. Very filling and flavorful, great beginning on this awfully cold nacht. Had a bit of my friends pretzel and bier kasse, very nicely done, as well.      Moved on to the entree, Baurn schnitzel. Delicious! Took me back to the jaegerhaus we used to frequent in Lampertheim, it was well prepared with succulent cheese and ham and a fine potato cake. This was accompanied by a very nice dunkelweissen, rich but not overbearing. My only disappoint with the meal was my yearning for a doppelbach, but they didn't have any.      The only reason they get 4 stars instead of 5 was the one man oompah band played 'Don't Stop Believing'. Sigh."}
{"text":"This place was really great - not that they had anything to do with it, we also got to see a double rainbow - my first!  We were within walking distance from this location, so I'm not 100% sure of available parking, but it's a huge place with lots of indoor and outdoor seating.  Food selection was large, pricing was very good and the servers were all very nice.  The gift shop isn't too overly priced - picked up a cool Germany hat for 20 bucks and it's a cool hat to boot!"}
{"text":"Hofbrauhaus is fun to go to but it gets packed and is a bit too much after awhile. The Radler which is a mix of beer and lemonade is delicious though."}
{"text":"Its really good! The fries are on point. Got the pork shank. Meat was fall of the bone. Can't wait to come again and try something new!"}
{"text":"Great edition  of a Bavarian restaurant. This is my second visit. First time I sat outside and the views were amazing. I enjoyed the pretzels, the beer and the sausage plate sampler. First time I came in late with my husband and it was after work. The kitchen was still open but it was the end of their shift.he was a weekday and the crowds were limited. I loved it  The second visit was on a Friday night and it was great again. We initially thought we wanted to sit   outside but it was rainy and humid. The restaurant was very crowded inside but they had live German music with an accordion. There were even people dancing.We decided to sit at the bar and the service was exceptional. I love this restaurant because of the environment, because I love beer in because their menu is authentic German"}
{"text":"Wish I would have come here at nighttime, as I hear people dance on the long wooden tables! That's my only regret! At least the accordian player was still doing his thing during our meal. Totally German place with authentic German food and great BEER in huge glasses.  I also regret not buying one of those glasses. Unfortunately I wasn't that hungry when I came here, so I just got a side of Spaetzle, and it was delicious. My boyfriend got the potato pancakes, and they were also very good. SO AWESOME HERE. If I'm in Pittsburgh again, I'd love to go back at nighttime when the place apparently comes more alive."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great all year round, even better in summer with beer garden and outdoor concert venue next door. Beer brewed here on site. Great German style food too!"}
{"text":"I have always thoroughly enjoyed every evening/night spent here. I love beer and find it hard to complain about a place that makes my love so much more enjoyable. The skis, samplers, food - great establishment. It's huge but tends to get packed especially on the weekends and obviously during the summer. The beer garden is great though. Everyone comes to have a good time and I've never actually seen anyone trying to start something. I once came for a networking event and that was fun too. All in all, never lets us down!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere!!!!  If you love to sing along this is the place for you.  Food is great but if you are eating healthy this will be the one place to come on you cheat day!!"}
{"text":"Had a great time, good food, and great beer! Went on a Thursday and sat in the main hall. Service was a bit slow, but understandable because of how packed it was. Overall, awesome!"}
{"text":"Had a friend's birthday party here in a small, semi-private area and the service was great. As a non-drinker, can't comment on the beer, but the food was very good. Pretzels and bier cheese was a great starter and the Bavarian schnitzel, fried cabbage, and spaetzel was great."}
{"text":"If you like German food and beer you'd like this place. It wasn't my cup of tea but it was run well enough and the wait times were good. I'll say that there aren't many vegan options but I wasn't expecting there to be since they specialize in sausages. The chairs were extremely impractical and uncomfortable though."}
{"text":"Happiness = (Meat + Beer + Carbs)^2  Was looking forward to this place prior to moving to Pgh this past summer.  The first time I visited this beer garden was when I visited the original one while on a beer garden crawl in Munich.  Beer was great.  Meat was great.  Truly memorable experience in Germany.  Now that I've been in Pgh since summer of 2013, this Pgh branch has not disappointed me at all.     Food (8.0/10) = Seems like not many people like the food here.  I personally love what I've ordered.  1. Bavarian Jagerschnitzel = flattened pork smothered in mushroom, bacon, and gravy.  2. Oktoberfest Schweinshaxe = big fat ass pork shank with crispy crackly skin.  ?Beer? = duh.  Hofbräu Hefe Weizen and the Hofbräu Dunkel.  1 L.  No BS with these beers.  Ambiance (9.5/10) = The beer garden is very close to the river.  I havent been in Pgh long, but I don't know any other place with outdoor seating along the river.  The garden is the best.  Has a \"community\" feel to it.  Haven't spent much time inside yet since weather has been good, but looks like a party is going on every time I walk thru.  Service (8.0/10) = Good service.  I get my beer and food.  That's important.  Overall Opinion = Haven't been disappointed by this joint at all.  The best asset of this place, other than the beer, is the beer garden.  If looking for outdoor dining/drinking in a very casual chill environment, check out Hofbrauhaus Beer Garden level."}
{"text":"Love this place! It was my first time trying it out and the atmosphere was so unique! Loved the German music and attire -- gives it a real authentic feel. Plus, the food was DELISH! Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"First time here.  Great location w/ river views. Great decor. Large portions.  Had the liter Hefewiesen.  The bier cheese and prezels are a delicious appetizer. Had the Käsespätzle, delicious...along w/ the Black Forest cake for desert.  Recommended, looking forward to visiting again."}
{"text":"Mediocre pork chops and food in general, but what it lacks in the culinary department it makes up for with FUN! You are guaranteed to a \"dancing -on-the-table\" kind of night on the weekends with live music, but my favorite is sitting outside on a rare not-so-humid summer night."}
{"text":"The experience of walking into this river-front homage to a traditional German bier hall feels less like my idea of Oktoberfest in Munich and more like Bill Murray's life a la Groundhog Day.  I can say this because I've been there 3-4 times and the story always plays out the same way...it's up to you to somehow drive the plot in a different direction.  Perhaps I'm missing the point...after all we return to most establishments seeking a consistent and memorable investment of our time and money...but I like to think we as Pittsburghers take more pride in our small locally owned watering holes than the same hoopla you'd find at Busch Gardens.    There is no formal parking lot at the Hofbrauhaus, just several nearby multi-level parking garages and a handful of metered spots in and around the Southside Works complex.  Chances are you'll pay something to park within walking distance.    Once inside everything seems larger than life...the tall ceilings, medieval sized tables that seat dozens, the shameless display of cleavage, and most of all...my disdain for boring and flavorless lagers.  I'll admit...I am a total beer snob...always hunting down the hoppiest of imperial IPA, but I will gladly find comfort in a nice malty dopplebock if it's available.  Alas, i've learned from the Seasonal release schedule that February is the only time of year when the style is on tap.   The food is exactly what you'd hope for; variations of wursts, schnitzels, potato pancakes and pretzels as well as some \"American\" choices - Burgers, Salads, etc.  It's the cavalade of starch and sausage that you'd want while eating cafeteria style to the tune of Journey's \"Don't stop believing\" honked out on accordion.    Who doesn't like to have their meal-time conversation interrupted by yinzers of all ages shouting a mispronounced \"ZICKE ZACKE\"  atop the same wooden benches that make it near impossible to \"shimmy\" yourself out to use the restroom.    Though I've never taken part in a shot-ski...I get the appeal.  The overall sense of merriment at the Hofbrau is perfect for getting large groups together as an impersonal celebration of special events, birthdays and a place to party with absolute strangers on any given weeknight.  For my money, I'll stick to Penn Brewery to get my fix of German fare with house-made brews...but thats just me; The hop-head whose personal nightmare is accepting being just a predictable part of the crowd."}
{"text":"Very good food but seating is limited during weekenda when the band is going. I highly recommend the lunch buffet during the week!"}
{"text":"How did I miss this place. It's is much like Munich and is a close as you can get to an Octoberfest celebration this side of the pond. Good German food and good service. Last night they had open seating which was fun for us and we got a chance to share a table with some folks who were a blast. We ate and a German band was setting up in traditional garb. They had two accordions in the band and I figured we were in for an evening of traditional German beer hall music - I was way wrong. These old guys were doing cover songs! Great sing along songs which were great. If you just want to sit and eat quietly don't sit in the main hall. In a few minutes everyone was standing on their chairs singing and dancing. It was a blast. Oh and the beer - great German variety and it was excellent."}
{"text":"I've only been to Hofbrauhaus a handful of times, but I have had a good time on all occasions. Whenever I've dropped in, strangely enough, it's almost always been midday on a week day ...  Anyway, I am a huge wheat beer lover to I of course go with the Hefeweizen, which is quite tasty (though I still prefer Paulaner's over all others). I like all of the windows that let in an ample amount of sunshine, if the sun happens to not be behind a rain cloud (that happened to me on one visit; it poured. Thank God I was inside chugging beer). It was always empty on my visit except for one when I went later on in the evening. Then it was filled with college students who gave the place a slightly party-ish kind of atmosphere, and I don't mean that in a bad way.  As far as the food, I can't speak to it as absolutely nothing on the menu appeals to me. I've had their pretzels once and those are really good, but I'm not going to drive all of the way to South Side Works for some damn pretzels lol. I haven't heard many good things about their food. From what I gather most people just show up for the beer, especially during Oktoberfest.  I highly suggest visiting when their tapping the kegs for Oktoberfest. THAT was a fun time. ;)"}
{"text":"This place was great and is super large inside as well as outside. We sat on the Terrace which has a covering in case for rain. The garden area as closed while we were there due to weather.  We tried the appetizer sampler and the Bavarian Sampler for 2 to split with 4 people. Both dishes were plenty of food. Appetizers  - Fried Pickles - I still haven't found one that I like. Sauerkraut Balls - they look like mini hush puppies with cabbage and ham inside.  Potato Pancake - texture is nothing like a pancake but looks like a fritter. Tasty. Pretzels - nothing special Sampler - Smoked pork chop is SALTY. Bleh! Sausages are delicious - though Hot Dog consistency. Schweinsbraten or roast pork - nothing special though I must say it was the healthiest of what was on the plate Strudel - Not sure if this is authentic but the strudel lacked any crisp to it and it was soggy and sad. I would not order this again. Beer - Buying 1 liter of Beer to get a glass is crap - almost twice as expensive as just getting the beer alone."}
{"text":"Location Location Location.  90% of what makes Hofbrauhaus Pittsburgh a lovely place to visit is it's positioning where the river meets the Southside Works. Noon, afternoon or evening, there isn't much that beats the atmosphere inside or outside of any Hoffbrauhaus but this location in particular has lovely view's of Pittsburgh and a stunning river-view terrace.  Everything is pricey but you're paying for the novelty of a traditional Bavarian style atmosphere. I mean hell, the waitresses wear costumes. SO that aside, the food is actually pleasantly tasty schnitzel and even not schnitzel. THe pretzels are a perfect snack, beer cheese on point and last but obviously not least the beer is just dandy. Little size is $5 and Big is $10. But big is a liter and is basically 3 drinks...two of those and you will find yourself dancing on the table(which is both acceptable and expected) to the house band playing various covers and favorites.   Go late for late night shenanigans or early for a hearty meal.  This place is just a good time. GO!"}
{"text":"We finished having our drinks and were about to leave, when all of a sudden this security guy stops us and asks for our id. Note that we had entered with showing our id and were buying drinks by showing Id for two hours. It was very insulting to be treated like this -- being stopped in full public view and questioned. Whatever your rules are, that was clear discrimination.   Horrible experience."}
{"text":"What a great place!  Stayed in Pittsburgh for the weekend and ate there twice. Service was good and very helpful. The food was great and the beer was even better.  It was too hot to eat outside by the river, but inside was awesome. The atmosphere was very lively with plenty of music and singing.  I would definitely go back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Great food, beer, and environment. Pressers We're amazing but too salty. Fortunately the salt could be dusted off. Same for the beer cheese dip"}
{"text":"Whoa... What a treat! The beers here are very good. I love the Gignormous liter glass steins the beers come in. I feel so powerful and manly when I drink out of those... That is, until my arm and wrist starts hurting from fatigue...  Service is great. They are prompt and I've never had to wait to get another round of orders placed.   The food is good. Very hearty and well prepared. My favorite is their pretzels. It's just the right amount of crunch on the outside with a slight sprinkle of salt and has a chewy, warm, fluffy but yet delightfully doughy inside. My goodness... I can eat a big one by myself and still want more. Try it with the dips, the cheese dip is my favorite."}
{"text":"I tend to prefer the more \"authentic\" places in the grittier part of Southside, but for what this is - an ersatz German beer hall - it's very well done, from the decor (which is on the fancier/nicer side of beer halls I've been in), to the beer (which is basic but good, again sticking to the German beer hall motif), to the food (again, think beer hall classics), and to the staff/atmosphere.   Speaking of the staff, they were friendly and helpful without being intrusive (thanks Kate!), although you might find the traditional costumes a bit much, especially in an era of heightened sensibilities. As for the atmosphere, I found the band very helpful to the overall vibe, but as others have pointed out, if you're looking for a quiet dinner/beverage, this probably isn't the best place for you - you'll definitely get much more out of this place if you're willing to buy-in and join in."}
{"text":"It might just be the almost-summer, almost perfect weather. but the patio at the Hofbrauhaus was a perfect place to spend an afternoon with two beers and two plates of good food. My love of German food is well-documented here, and we made good choices in the Weisswurst platter and the pretzel sandwich with ham and beir cheese -  both were uncomplicated and delicious.  I might have liked it a little less if I sat inside where the music was louder and the atmosphere generally kitschier, but on a summer afternoon, the patio suited me just fine - I'm looking forward to a return visit."}
{"text":"Heavy rain did not deter people from celebrating Oktoberfest at Hofbrau in October 2009 as we ended up waiting on the line for a quoted time of 45 minutes before we can get seated in the beer hall at 6pm on a Saturday night. We were hungry and we were thirsty so we tried to make our way to the bar while we waited. Although the bar was fairly large, It was so packed we had to try and cut our way through 3 rows of people before we could even make it to the counter. We decided against it and pestered the hostess again if there was any available seating anywhere. It was also just another excuse to talk to the beautiful ladies welcoming people at the door.  They were immediately able to accommodate us at the separately enclosed quiet room and we took it. That service receives a check mark in my book for now.  There was of course a good selection of beer on the menu priced decently for light and dark beer connoisseurs alike. As for the food, I could've done better with my $14 then get the Weiner schnitzel here which ended up just being a fried pork cutlet with some sides. It tasted just like any standard fried pork cutlet and could be gotten for just $6 at Rose Tea Cafe in Squirrel Hill. I even ordered it with an egg on top (extra $1 charge with meal) and they forgot to put it on. So they decided to charge me $3 for one cooked egg to put on top of my pork cutlet by myself. (I rectified the situation when the bill came) Although the food was pretty standard and nothing to write home about or in this case, to yelp, one nice thing I liked about my meal was the German potato salad side. Of all the sides my friends and I ordered, we believed that that was the best side.  I'm sure the meal would've tasted a lot better if I had a couple more beers in me and we were swigging away in the beer hall but since we ate this sober, I was able to give my taste buds a full chance to try out Hofbrau's quality and a 3 out of 5 star rating of its food.   If I were to come back next time, we would probably just be in the bier hall for its beer at night. We weren't able to experience it, but it looked like everyone was having fun in there."}
{"text":"Love this place!   The food is good.  The atmosphere is Great!   Love the Craft Beer.  The music is interesting & different."}
{"text":"Hofbrauhaus' German-Beer Hall inspired restaurant/pub provides an alternative dining and drinking experience in Pittsburgh. The atmosphere at Hofbrauhaus makes the visiting this establishment worthwhile. There is an eclectic group of people all indulging in heavily encouraged drinking while listening to upbeat traditional folk music. There are also skis for drinking beer; if that means something to you then Hofbrauhaus has it; if that sounds like nonsense then go to Hofbrauhaus to see what I mean.  If you are willing to participate in the high energy cheering and singing, then you'll definitely enjoy an evening here.  When I came here we ordered a few samplers, pretzels, and bratwurst to share. I have no standard to compare the authenticity to, but the quality was surely acceptable.  As for beer, Hofbrauhaus brews its own beer on site. You can order a sample of the house beers and go from there. Also, I've read that Hofbrauhaus serves Cask Ales, but I cannot confirm this from memory."}
{"text":"I was visiting my friend in Pittsburgh and she recommended going to this place. Upon arrival, I fell in love with the seating arrangement, the music and the atmosphere. Our server was incredibly nice and when he realized I'm a vegetarian he brought me a \"vegetarian menu!\" How thoughtful!! I also noticed that they have a gluten-sensitive menu. This just makes ordering food a whole lot easier and I truly appreciate their effort to accommodate! Our food was delicious and our server was more than nice and checked up on us a couple of times. Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"On our way to Baltimore, my coworker wanted to stop for lunch around the Pittsburg area so we decided on this place after the first pick was closed.  I'm not exactly sure where this is located in relation to Pittsburgh but the location was really nice. Looks like all new development.  Since I've never been to anything German before, this was an experience. Although it might not be \"authentic\" it was pretty cool. The waitresses are dressed up in their attire and the tables are all wood. Gave me a Harry Potter feel.   Since we stopped by during lunch, we opted for their lunch buffet. I must say, unless you want something really specific off their menu, the buffet is the way to go! A few different types of sausages, a full salad bar with soup, and the usual comfort German foods. I loved their spicy sausage. Everything was great but I like that kind of food. Carbs and sausage! I saw that there is a location in Ohio too but it's 2hrs from me. I wish I could've got a beer but since I was driving and it was a company vehicle, I had to be responsible.  On our way back, I was tempted to stop here again but it would've been dinner time."}
{"text":"We came to the Hofbrau House as soon as it opened on a Friday for a special promotion luncheon for work. We ended up parking a couple blocks away in a parking garage which was fine, but I would have been happier if the valet was all day and not just for the dinner hours. We were greeted and met our party near the back of the restaurant. The seating is just like you would find at an authentic Oktoberfest in Germany, long community tables. I was so excited to try the food and hoped it would taste like the food did when we lived in Bavaria. Of course we started off with some Hefe Weizen, goes down like silk. Smooth and sweet just like I remember it. We also ordered the Pretzel and Bier cheese app and the Works Combo appetizers for the tables. Loved the sauerkraut balls and the potato pancakes with the apple sauce were fantastic! That works platter would also be good as an entrée, a little bit of everything. I went with the original schnitzel for my entrée. A huge piece of lightly breaded pork, still tender and juicy on the inside with cabbage, buttered spazetzle(substituted this for the potato salad) and a side of cranberries. I had never though of having cranberries with pork, but it was an amazing accompaniment. Loved it! It was also a very large serving with plenty of leftovers to take home. My husband had the Hot Brown. No bread in this as it had the potato pancakes for the base, tons of turkey, gravy tomato and bacon. This was the perfect sized lunch meal. During our meal there was also a man playing an accordion so we had some live German music. Definitely want to come back here again. Great food, great beer."}
{"text":"My favorite place in Pittsburgh.  Great food and great beer that are consistent no matter what night you go.  On weekends they have a live band that comes in and plays crowd favorites and people get on the table benches to dance. If you want a louder experience eat in the main beer hall, for a quieter one go to the dinning area. In the summer it's best to eat in the outdoors beer garden next to the river."}
{"text":"I love this place on weekends. The ambiance is great. Food is ok ok, but the beer is great."}
{"text":"I love this place! I enjoy the food, the beer, and the atmosphere immensely. What I don't enjoy? The service. The service is usually incredibly friendly but takes forever.  And seriously, any place where getting up on the tables and dancing is encouraged, for both men and women, that is definitely the place for me!"}
{"text":"Came here for a quick drink and snack so we got a half liter of Hefe Weizen and the bier cheese fries. The food and drink were great! Service was pretty slow and hard to get the waiter's attention."}
{"text":"My family and I were looking for a fun place to go for our last night out before I went to college, and we decided on the Hofbrauhaus.  It was a great decision.  We got the Giant Pretzel and sausage platter for a starter.  Both were delicious.  The sauerkraut that came with the sausage was soooo good.  I made sure I got a side of kraut with my meal because of it.  The Pretzel was great too, and the sauces were phenomenal.  For my meal I got the pork.  The one i ordered was the Bavarian Jaugersniztwel.  It had mushrooms and bacon on top, and the sauce with it was absolutely great.  The sides were also good.  The waiter told me before that the veggies were frozen and not good, but I ordered them anyways, and I really enjoyed them.  The workers messed up my mothers sides, but they fixed it with no problems at all, and within sixty seconds, we had the new sides.  We even got to keep the wrong sides, which I was very happy to devour.    Everybody at the table liked their meals, and we even had enough room to throw down some apple strudel and chocolate cake.  They were both delicious.  I would defiantly recommend this place.  The atmosphere is beyond fun, and if I am excited for two birthdays from now when I get to spend my 21st Bday cheers-ing German beers and singing along with the rest of the place."}
{"text":"Only a handful of these German themed restaurant/ bars in the entire world and one of them is in Pittsburgh. Go here on a Saturday or Friday night and forget about it, BUT THAT'S HALF THE CHARM! You need to be in the mood to be elbows to elbows, standing on tables, singing, screaming and doing shot skis as a group. The food is good as well. Very German. But I recommend going here for a fun night out with the guys or gals."}
{"text":"This place is always fun on the weekends. I always get their hefeweizen full liter. There's usually entertainment inside and during the summer they have a great outdoor area. I was lucky enough to do a shot ski before they got rid of them and it was quite the experience."}
{"text":"Soo I definitely wasn't expecting the whole Oktoberfest feel when I went in there. This is the first thing I did when entering Pittsburgh.  There was live music and the whole place was buzzing. I loved every second of it and the food was great. The Hefeweizen might have been the best I have ever had and the Bier Cheese served with soft pretzels was fantastic!! Highly recommend to anyone who wants some authentic German cuisine or is looking for a fun atmosphere with their meal."}
{"text":"Hofbraughhaus is a one-of-a-kind experience. During our visit, it was a blast to drink beer out of a liter mug, try different German sausage, sing along with our fellow dining mates, and just enjoy the atmosphere!   The beer served was very tasty, not really heavy, and we really did enjoy the sausage plate. If you're in Pittsburgh and looking for a unique experience, check out Hofbraughhaus!"}
{"text":"Meh. The atmosphere was really nice - we sat outside and had a nice view of the river, but the food was mediocre, expensive and inauthentic.   We didn't try the beer but it's probably alright and would have enhanced the experience. Although no prices on the drink menu is never a good sign!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of the Hofbrauhaus in Munich, so of course I'd love a stateside version! This is true to the Munich original, if a bit smaller in scale. Same good German beer, same good German food. If that's what you're looking for, you're in luck! If not ... I'd strongly suggest you go elsewhere.  Beer: They have the traditonal lager, a hefeweizen, and a dunkel. Each month they have a special beer of the month, and they also seem to have a 5th brewer's selection at most times. Beers come in 1/2 or full liters. That's it!  Food: My family is German, so I do love a solid German meal. I was in town on business, so I definitely took advantage of the situation to stop in. We don't have too many great German spots in my hometown, so I have to get my fill while in Pennsylvania. I had a pretzel followed by a sandwich, and I subbed in a potato dumpling for a side. Yum yum yum!  Atmosphere: Standard beerhall fare. I was there a bit early (6-730ish), so the main hall was relatively empty. There was a German musician on stage, and overall it made for a pleasant dining atmosphere. Since the crowd was pretty sparse (it was also really cold while I was there), I also had great and attentive service. I'm sure that during College Night or on the weekends, though, the place can get crowded! Perhaps not as much as elsewhere in Pittsburgh as the location seems to be pretty touristy, but I'm sure that's a draw for many."}
{"text":"We were first standing in line at the Cheesecake Factory. It was a 45 minute wait and we were trying to catch a movie.  So I Yelped what was close by and this place popped up.  I wait listed it.  We were there in 5 minutes. There were lots of people waiting and I walked up to the podium to check in. They told the person in front of me the wait was 30 minutes.  I gave my name and they sat us immediately. Love that feature!!!  My 16 year old had the roast beef Au jus.  She thought it was tasty. She said she would order it again. I had the bratwurst of the month which was a smokey bacon flavor.  Came with sauerkraut and fries. I enjoyed it along with their own brewed beer.  I like Blue Moon and Shock Top and they gave me one of their brews that tasted similar. We were in and out and able to get to our movie on time."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place since I love German food and drink. Okay, they serve beer by the liter, that is awesome! They have a full German menu, also awesome! The reason for three stars is that the service was pretty much \"meh.\" I think our waitress quit judging by the reaction of our second waitress. The food was alright, nothing amazing, but acceptable nonetheless. I am not sure if it was an off night or if I built it up in my mind to be something it wasn't. Either way, it was an experience, but once was enough."}
{"text":"Best German potato salad Lovely atmosphere Great servers Beer  Bier cheese great Would come back"}
{"text":"I had never been to Hofbrauhaus before, and my German food experience is somewhat limited. I'm also not much of a beer drinker (more of a wine girl). However, I really enjoyed eating at Hofbrauhaus with my coworkers at a conference. The atmosphere feels like a giant biergarten (or at least what I've seen in photos) and is very festive. There's a guy doing live accordion music at dinner that makes things feel more authentic as well. The service was a bit sparse (understandable given the immense size of the place), but friendly.   The food itself was delicious! The one letdown was the beer cheese pretzels. Everyone I talked to RAVED about them, but I found them to be incredibly salty to the point where I didn't really enjoy them, and literally scraped off all the salt from the pretzels. The cheese itself was ok. Seemed like standard bar fare. However, my schnitzel plate was fantastic! Perfectly cripsy, great cabbage sides, and really hit the spot. Overall, fun experience and I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"So good, I had to come back two times in the weekend I was here.  Why I knew I would love this place: two sizes for beers... 1/2 Liter and full Liter. The beer brewed is very good and I can tell they serve it with pride.  Came the first night quite late for some drinking / pretzel eating, and most of all.. standing on the benches signing along with the polka band, making new friends and having a drunken good ol' time.  i wish they would have more of these establishments, as it was high positive energy the entire night! The songs were all very sing-a-long-able... especially the song about Alice!  Next day I came back for an actual meal. The latkas were absolutely amazing, and I had the wurst sampler. All three were extremely good, and I am not sure which one I would choose if i had to choose one. Paired with the mashed potatoes and gravy, it was a match made in heaven. The patio was open the day we went, so we got to enjoy the views of the river as well.   Great meal, great beer, great times! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I can't help but feel like someone brought me to German Disneyland. The outfits (Dirndl) for the waitresses make me feel sad and embarrassed (but...also impressed by their cleavage). How come the bros get by in just a white and blue button up? Well, at least the dude playing the \"accordion\" (it was a piano) was in legit lederhosen. Work it, German Santa. He played some folk-ish music including Edelweiss. I drank their Doppelbock. It was tasty. It was 8.0% but I could REALLY taste the alcohol more than with other Doppelbocks I've had. I like that they have the ABV on there and also describe the beer. Apparently you can choose your beer sizes. That's fun.  We only got a pretzel with bier cheese, a sweet mustard and obazda for $9.50. Too expensive for a hunk of bread. Should be something like $6.   I could see the appeal of this place for Oktoberfest but I think I'll stay away until then. There's better beer to be had that doesn't subject their female waitstaff to dress like beer wenches."}
{"text":"Hofbrauhaus is such a fun concept and is situated in an amazing location right on the water. Walking in, you're overcome by the cute outfits that the staff is wearing, the authentic decor and homey feeling. This location is big and perfect for large groups I like the biergarten concept outside. All of the beers that I have tried have been great. Service is generally pretty good--not over the top fantastic, but no complaints. Avoid the food. It is GROSS. I've tried 4 different items and hated all of them. I guess Germany isn't known for their food, so why should this place be any different? They do not have a happy hour (at least in the beer garden), so don't expect any deals on their pricey pints."}
{"text":"I have been to the Hofbrauhaus in Columbus as well and they are no different. That's a good thing! Affordable food, good beer, loud music, and noisy people! Not a great place for a quiet dinner, but if you are looking to have a fun time and a few beers with friends, go there and let loose!"}
{"text":"There are two very important things one needs when dining at Hofbrauhaus: 1) stretchy pants and 2) a designated driver.  The stretchy pants are for comfort after you have gorged yourself on sausages, pork, sauerkraut or any number of German delicacies.  The designated driver is for when you've drunken yourself into a stupor after one gigantic beer.  I've only been there a few times, but each time, I have a decent experience, great food and awesome beer.  Yes, I know I'm breaking my rule about corporate food, but there aren't that many locations (it's not like it's a Chili's - on every corner) so I don't count it as being too, too corporate.  I forgive because the food is actually pretty good.  My one warning is that if you're looking for a nice, quiet intimate place to dine, go elsewhere.  If it's busy, you might be seated at a table with strangers (there are booths, but not too many).  On top of that, Hofbrauhaus is loud even on its slowest afternoons and absolutely nuts on a Saturday nght."}
{"text":"Ich spreche Deutsch .... but I hate German food.  I do love me some Hofbrauhaus though.  GOOD cheap beer and authentic German food served up with accordion music?  The festival atmosphere is awesome.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The Beer is okay,  not a bad deal for 7 bucs.  The atmosphere is very loud if your inside.  plenty of seating outside, but it does get crowded late, and they don't let  you stand around.  They have a huge area outside with picnic tables, but beware they have a limited menu if you decide to eat there.    The food is alright, nothing to write home about.  In my humble opinion Penn Brewery is (was) more authentic.  and I'd rather spend money there.  This place is good for a large group ready to party and drunk enough to not care about the food.  The best thing I've had here was the sauerkraut balls.  I went here like 4 or 5 times, and I've had my fun there.  Like I said its good for a party.  Get the Shot Ski."}
{"text":"I go out of my way for German restaurants/bierhalls and I can say for sure that Hofbrauhaus Pittsburgh is in my top 3 in the country.  I've been coming back to this place over the last decade and I can tell you that it's been solidly consistent in terms of quality too.  If you like German style beers, you can't go wrong with any of the options that they have on their menu.  From their traditional styles of year-round offerings (Munich Helles, Munich Dunkel, Hefeweizen) to the monthly rotating options, you'll never have a bad beer here. They have one or two rotating options that are on the hoppier side, but if you're the type of jagoff who refuses to drink anything other than IPAs/DIPAs/imperials, just go somewhere else.  Or consider the beers for their historical context and appreciate a different style that's well-executed.  There are few things more satisfying than the taste and heft of a 1 liter stein full of good quality German lager.    The food has always been fantastic here as well.  We always, as in 100% of the time, get the pretzels and bier cheese.  They are fantastic and are the perfect salty complement to your first liter of beer.  Everything that comes with The Works Sampler is also really good and it's good for sharing if you have 3 or 4 people. For my meal, I typically get the Wurstplatte and I've never been disappointed.  My only complaint about it is that I would rather that it come with a Weisswurst rather than the Frankfurter.  The Frankfurter is good, but I'd prefer the more traditional Bavarian white sausage. We've also had the Hot Brown and a couple of the schnitzels before as well and we've been satisfied with everything. I also recommend getting the Spatzle as a side.  I'd go with the buttered option, but the bier cheese Spatzle is also good, if a little on the heavy side.  I agree with some of the other reviews that talk about going on an off-night or earlier in the day if you are going on a weekend.  The wait can be pretty long Thursday nights-Saturday nights and it gets loud with the live bands.  If you're looking for a fun night out with friends, it's not a problem, but if you're looking for a quiet romantic dinner date, go earlier on the weekends or on a week night."}
{"text":"Run far away. Then run some more. We celebrated a friend's birthday here, and the entire thing was actually new to my experience: the dance hall, the three-tiered outside seating area, the hoochies, the brosephs, the smoking, the fighting, how we got stared at for being gay. Won't be back. I actually have adopted use of 'Hofbrauhaus' as an adjective to mean 'way out of control and unpleasant' -- as in, \"Oh, the law school halloween party was completely Hofbrauhaus.\""}
{"text":"They had an amazing crispy pork shank dish that came with a tasty potato side and very well made sauerkraut. I love pretzels while drinking beer, so that was an amazing plus with the bier cheese dipping sauce. The \"German\" beer was pretty standard. It was nothing to coo over. Our waitress was sweet, but it was obvious that she was overwhelmed because she alone was waiting on about 1/3 of the outdoor seating area. This is a fun place to go drink with the pals, especially if you have a larger group to accomodate. Prost!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome! I was visiting my boyfriends family in Pittsburgh and trying to think of places to go during the day when he suggested we go here and sit outside and have a beer. We had a great time! We went on a saturday afternoon and it was a great place to go on a gorgeous day. The beer was delicious and so much fun to drink a whole liter from a humongous glass. We did not do much eating, but am definitely looking forward to coming back here!"}
{"text":"My wife and I (along with our one year old daughter) had a wonderful family meal there while sitting in the outside area facing the \"Mon\" river. We arrived at about 5 PM and were seated without waiting and had a high chair waiting for us at the table. It was a perfect place to take our child because it is loud, even outside.  My wife and I each started with a beer (The Hef and Pils) and were pleasantly surprised by the taste. We sampled the three different dipping sauces for the soft pretzels and found them all to be very delicious. Finally, we split a wedge salad and the dunked chicken sandwich. Both meals were prepared well and served promptly. All of the service was perfect and the pacing of the meal was slightly slower than you might expect for a chain restaurant, which we both appreciated.   I would recommend this restaurant for families and would say that on top of being family friendly it is also wallet friendly.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"We went here 3 days in a row, they had a keg tapping on Thursday night.  What a great place, man it was awesome.  I've been to the Munchen and Vegas one and as soon as I realized there was one here we were like, \"3 nights straight we're coming here!\""}
{"text":"I continue to be a devotee of Hofbrahaus despite not being a beer-drinker.   Who cares about mead when such items as the titanically flavorful vessel of breaded, fried pork called the Schnitzel Sandwich are on the bill of fare? The lettuce, tomato, red onion, pickles and bier cheese only compliment the flap of crisp, succulent pork held tightly within a Kaiser roll, making the foreign familiar and universal. The yinzer in me I had half a mind to ask for slaw and frites on top. Instead, the fabulous, dead-perfect Belgian-style tuber sticks came as a side.  I thought I tasted lard, which is always a good thing when devouring deep-fried foods.   The ultimate potato pancakes can also be had at Hofbrahaus. As thick as hamburger patties, they crackle like kettle chips on the outside, yet are plush, muggy, and starchy like au gratin spuds on the inside. So tasty were they, that I almost ignored the sour cream and applesauce that accompanied these precious, oily, crispy, shareable starters.   One must also consider the carnally creamy, benevolently bacon-laden comfort food tour-de-force that is the Hofbrauhaus Hot Brown...or Turkey Devonshire. No matter. You, the reader, the eater of good food, deserve such pleasures in an increasingly maddening world.   And dessert...praise Thor for dessert!  This time it would be the black monolith known as The Chocolate Stout Cake that would terrify my taste buds. Imbibed with yeasty, beastly, beery essences, the wedge of decadent darkness consisted of a frighteningly fudgy, dense body and an airy chocolate mousse frosting straight from Niflheim.  Is it touristy, ktschy, Epcot-ish? I am not concerned. The food makes its own statement, and that statement comes down bold like Mjolnir smiting mountains.   P.S. The service was terrific overall, and considering the restaurant had just opened for the day, we almost had it all to ourselves for most of our early lunch.  P.P.S. As Kay, her parents, and I gorged ourselves on the Teutonic delicacies, a gentleman in olden Germanic attire serenaded us with his accordion. Unfortunately, he knew no Blind Guardian songs.  P.S. The Hot Brown and the Chocolate Stout cake were specials and are not listed on the website's menu."}
{"text":"Great place to have beer and food!!! I really enjoyed myself especially with the live entertainment."}
{"text":"Wonderful food & great service. Not sure if reservations are possible, but try to call ahead. Fun atmosphere and delicious good if you are a fan of German cuisine, which I am. Was looking forward to some cucumber salad or bloodwurst but alas it is not in the menu. Oh - great beer too! Will make this a regular stop when in PA in the future!!"}
{"text":"This review is solely on the food.  I like the schnitzel a lot - it hits the spot every time!  I also enjoyed the schweinshaxe, but it's a bit pricey.  I'm wondering what it would take to get them to serve real German pretzels, the huge ones.  The sausages are just ok."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!  It's like walking into a palace...awesome beers, great food, extremely friendly service, great music.  You must have an appetizer when you go...try the pretzel, it comes with several awesome sauces for dipping, or the nachos or anyting there.  Their steaks are fantastic, sandwiches, dinners are to die for.  The beer that they serve is fantastic as well...even if you don't drink, you should start if you go there!  LOL  Definitely one of my favorites...."}
{"text":"Pretty good German ambiance, especially the music. The music made me feel like I was at the eatery next to the \"It's a Small World\" ride at Walt Disney World, which I loved.   Plus, the food was flavorful, and there was plenty of it.   Hubby and I both had the bourbon glaze... He had the burger, and I had the chicken breast. Both were juicy and tender.   I know... German restaurant and neither of us had brats. But hey, the fried cabbage was yummy.   We'll probably bring our out-of-town relatives in next time they visit, as there's shopping nearby and a great view of the Mong."}
{"text":"Fantastic beer, large area, boisterous crowd.  The service is decent for how incredibly crowded this place gets.  Can't comment on the food as we drank the whole night. The place gets crazy later at night, everyone was dancing on the tables. Gotta love the live music."}
{"text":"I must say that this place was very enjoyable... We came here around noon on a Monday to find the place pretty empty, but I have a lot of German heritage, so I am having sausage and beers!  I got two sausages with a soft pretzel (off the lunch menu, see photo) and they were AMAZING! Even the mustard that came on the side was good, and I hate that crap most of the time! I also ordered the Hofbrau Hofbräu Dunkel beer (see photo), a 5.5 by volume. It had a nice full flavor, not to heavy and because it was made there it makes it just a little extra special...  We also had a pork sandwich on the table, a potato pancake, and a veggie burger... The fries are worth mentioning as well... VERY good!  I would love to come here on a weekend to sing and drink with a big crowd, but that didn't happen this go around. If I was ever in the area again, I will defiantly come back!"}
{"text":"Ich liebe Hofbräuhaus! Seriously, I love this place. I love the beer, the food, the atmosphere, and most importantly, servers in dirndls. Even if you think you won't like German food, give it a chance. It's incredible. Prost!"}
{"text":"Fun place.  Had the jagerschnitzel.  Nice sized portion, rich mushroom sauce.  Fried cabbage and German potato salad on the side.  All very nice.  The buildings main room is done up like a trad German beer hall.  Nice big bar."}
{"text":"Got here late and had a 32 oz of the dunkel. Good German style beer. The bartenders only let you buy one at a time which is lame. The live band plays Ein Prosit about every 25 minutes but stupidly ends it with the Australian cheer.  We stood on the benches of the tables, had soft pretzels with beer cheese which is really good though not traditional. This place is a sad imitation of the real thing.   Tourist trap."}
{"text":"Kind of like Disney.... expensive, loud, full of people, big furniture and decorations, with semi-attentive staff waiting for large tips. The food is Americanized German food (pretty good) and the appeal is purchasing one liter of beer and seeing people dance on tables. I'm not sold on this.  However, I'd like to try the sauerkraut balls and potato pancakes, and pretzels,with other beers. Beer selection is authentic and plentiful."}
{"text":"Normally, Hofbrauhaus is known amongst college students for its Thursday night beer deals during College Night (9-11 PM). However, I had a college departmental graduation dinner here and was pleasantly surprised by the food as well. As German food isn't know to be the most vegetarian-friendly, I was apprehensive about what my entree options would be. However, there were more vegetarian options than expected, including multiple appetizers, salads, pasta, and garden burger.  For my appetizer, the pretzel and salads complemented each other well. In particular, the pretzel was warm and soft when served and went well with the accompanying mustard. For the main entree, I got the Kaespatzle, which is a pasta with cream sauce, cheese and onions. This dish was slightly heavy and wasn't as flavorful as I was expecting - the first couple bites were good but then the flavors felt a bit monotonous. Dessert included an Apple Strudel and Chocolate Stout cake, both very scrumptious. Overall, its worth a shot to check out the food here, in addition to the beer."}
{"text":"When the whole crew loves a place it is a huge win.   German food was great (Gulaschsuppe, Schnitzel, Weiss Wurst, cabbage, pierogies), local food was also good (Pittsburg Salad), and their take on other foods (nachos) were just terrific.   Did not try the beer but would go out of our way to come here for the food."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for a family party while we were in Pittsburgh over Thanksgiving.  We loved it!    We came in the afternoon because we thought it would be really difficult to get a table at night.   We were a party of 18.   First off  there is every beer imaginable.  You can get the 1 liter stein and purchase it or get a regular size mug.   They also have a full bar.   My husband got the large stein.purchased it.  We both got the 3 brats with saurkrat and potatoes but I substituted a potato pancake for the mashed potatoes.  They bring a basket of large pretzels with bier cheese to start.  The food is good, but it's the atmosphere that makes it fun.   We got there too early for the band, but they had an accordian player there who kept things lively by taking requests for toasts and offfering toasts.  It was a fun afternoon,"}
{"text":"When I used to drink beer, this would be the place to get a good one. Make sure you load up on carbs before you go to the place. Otherwise, you may get extremely drunk from the liters and pints. The view from the restaurant is really spectacular. The river and the crowd are unbeatable."}
{"text":"This place was great.  I wasn't expecting the food to be good or to find much activity on a late Thursday night. I walked in (after a visit to REI) and found a seat right away.  Within 45 minutes, though, there was a big crowd, people were dancing on the tables and there was a great, fun environment. And, the food WAS delicious!"}
{"text":"OK so I went here late at night at about 12 am on a Friday night right after checking out the Interview over at the theater across the st.  The security of this place is absolutely crazy, which makes sense given that when we went all the college kids were off from school, meaning party time.... which is basically what we walked into after showing our IDs to the bouncer. By this time the restaurant area was blocked off and it was just the main bar - beer hall area. They had a cover band playing what you would expect a band to play at a frat party all while wearing leaderhosen.  Most of the patrons were standing on benches and dancing around. Which in a way was kind of unexpected as I would think they stand when singing drinking songs not, Neil Diamon or AC/DC.   Anyway, we walked on to the bar and waited a few to put in our beer order. While waiting one of the patrons tried to cut in front of us, but fortunately the bartender noted this and totally blew the guy off for a bit. Also prior to making our drink order, the bartender asked once again for our ID. Given the high number of college/possibly HS kids I totally got it... and also felt bad for the wait staff as a lot of the patrons seemed just so douchey.  We got our beer right away which was delicious... what you would expect from Hofbrauhaus. Now as we were enjoying our beer we enjoyed the people watching, which was quite entertaining.    After our one beer, we left, as it definitely is not a place for conversation. More of a place to get trashed. Now, I really don't know if this is the normal scene, but I was not that impressed. I will also say we didn't try any of their food, which is something we plan to do when it gets warmer as they have really nice outdoor seating overlooking the river."}
{"text":"I love going to this restaurant, they have a lot of great outside dining available right along side the river so its a great view!   I prefer the outside dining to inside because it gets very loud inside, its hard to hold a conversation.  Great German food dishes , and for someone that doesnt like German food they also have some american food like hamburgers.  Great for beer lovers, too!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times in both warm and cool/ cold months. This is a large space that on weekends can feel very cramped.   Atmosphere - 20, 30, 40 somethings, girl vs guy ratio 2 - 4, frat house, noisy, crowded, massive, messy, spills on your favorite shirt, the majority of people arriving in groups.   Service - Again, it is like a frat house here on the weekends. So service here consists of pushing your way to the bar and sticking your money out to let them know you are ready to order. Summers here are a bit better. The outside bar, which faces the river, has easier access.   Prices - The prices are a bit on the higher side for it being in the SouthSide. Mixed drinks are around $7 and beers around $5 and up.   Food - The beer is decent here, I usually get the Hefe Weizen. I am not the biggest beer drinker so I usually switch to Cap'n and Cokes. I have never eaten here (other than a pretzel) as it is always too crowded. I think the less crowded and less rowdy afternoons are probably a better time to try out their food.   Overall - While I have never had a blast here, as I feel I am getting too old to go, I think the best time to go to the Hofbrauhaus is in the summer months. This is because you can escape the craziness of the main area (lodge?) and head to the bottom level to really enjoy some time down by the river."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great atmosphere, live music, good beer and delicious food! An unexpected find on our trip to Pittsburgh.. and we were pleasantly surprised!"}
{"text":"Fun, lively place.  Loud but fun! Great German food.  We love coming here when we visit Pitt!"}
{"text":"When you're in the mood for some Kitschy-coup, this is definitely the place for you!  I've not been into 'theme parks' for a very long time. Their appeal wore off when they became totally commercialized pre-fab 'facades' of 'fun'. I also lost my tastes for malls years ago when they robbed our country of that hometown real main street experience, and the demise of mom and pop businesses. To me, places like the South Side Works, and the businesses contained therein really aren't much different than a mall attempt at 'themeing' the small town neighborhood business strip at a theme park. Like Disney's 'Small Town USA' - pretty, painted 'sets' with the same ol' chains disguised as 'unique'.  For the holiday, my neighbors and I headed out for something 'different', for a Christmas eve day lunch, and thanks to an Amazon special deal of the day, we ended up in pseudo Bavaria in the pseudo mall/pseudo small town America village that used to be an actual source of viable income for the local 'steel' community.  Fun for a couple of hours when you're in the mood for the Germany beer hall ride, complete with the oom-pa-pa music and sing alongs. Only there are no worries about keeping your arms inside the car, and securing your safety bar.  Now, I must admit, where most places that attempt to 'theme' something in the burgh usually fall flat on their faces, Hofbrau Haus hits the nail on the head, and takes it ALL the way, from the decor, to the menu, the santa-in-lederhosen one man band, and the gals with the push up bras that make their cleavage appear on the verge of exploding.   The menu is ALL German. Now, having grown up with German as a part of my ethnic heritage, that variety of Eastern European food has never been a favorite. The very smell of fried cabbage was enough to make me gag, and I just kind of grew up to appreciate a wider variety of flavors and spices. I only had one relative who WAS a good cook, and even she lost me on halushki. (her side was more slovak than German).  Now, all of that being said...Hofbrau Haus WAS a somewhat fun escape for an afternoon, and the food WAS pretty good, albeit a tad pricey (just a tad, not excruciatingly).  For three adults and one child, we split the appetizer platter, which contained fresh made pretzels, fried pickles, fried Sauerkraut balls, and a large potato pancake, accompanied by honey mustard, ranch dressing, applesauce and Bier Cheese as dipping sauces. It was plentiful, tasty, and unique in the flavor combos.  I had a hard time choosing from the entrees. Every time I read the ingredient lists I cringed when I saw 'fried cabbage', or onions in any way, shape, or form. At first I was flip flopping between a burger and something called the Hofbrau Hot Brown, which was turkey and ham served on a potato pancake topped with swiss cheese, homemade bier cheese, tomato, bacon and parmesan cheese -  and then everyone pointed out that I could get a burger anywhere (and frankly, why kitsch it up, when the real thing is at Winghart's?), so then it became a flip flop between the Hot brown and the Hofbrauhaus Wurstlplatte which was grilled bierwurst, bratwurst, and frankfurter served with sauerkraut and mashed potatoes.  I ended up opting for the Hot brown based on price.  My neighbors got the Heidelberger Rahm Spatzle - Pulled Chicken And Spatzle sauteed with caramelized onions and field mushrooms tossed into a marsala cream sauce, and a wurst dish that was kind of similar in ingredients to the hot brown. For the little one, well, pizza and fries, of course.  The Hot Brown arrived, and although it was a LOT smaller than I expected it to be, it really was very tasty. VERY cheesey creamy. Much larger in portion, so much so that my neighbor couldn't eat it all, thus allowing for extras to be passed around, the Spatzle was yummy too, though I did regret the onions later.   They each had some kind of funky beer, which would never appeal to me (beer just reminds me of recreational drinkers, red necks and frat boys), and though I opted for Diet Coke, they were Pepsi people, so I ended up with iced tea.  There were drinking songs being sung in addition to the holiday songs, with glasses clanking and a few hoots and hollers (and yodels) here and there, adding to a kind of mish-mash of holiday revelry and plain ol' beer hall drinking revelers. At 2 in the afternoon, however, there wasn't any dancing on tables.  The service staff was very capable and helpful, from the man who greeted us at the front door, to the waitress who took care of us.  All in all, it was a quite pleasant escape from 'the usual'. I just can't say it's an escape I'd add to my calendar for a regular visit though. It would indeed be a rare craving for this kind of amusement park atmosphere, for a guy with a not-so-strong desire for German food OR beer. But, again, that being said - even the guy who doesn't have a taste for any of that managed to have an enjoyable afternoon and meal, with good company"}
{"text":"Excellent beer selection and food in a giant German beer hall. What's not to like?   The pretzels, apple potato pancakes, and fried sauerkraut balls were especially good. The grilled brat with sauerkraut is worth getting as well.   The service might be a little slow but you're enjoying the beer hall so don't stress too much."}
{"text":"Ah the things we do for husbands. Like most guys, my husband wanted nothing more for his birthday than to sit around eating carb loaded foods with a huge stein of beer in front of him. This place did not disappoint.  We went on a Saturday night around 6:30 and we walked right up to the hostess stand. No joke though. Two minutes later I turned around and the line was out the door. This place was PACKED.   We were seated pretty promptly and were lucky enough to score one of the booths that flank the main hall. PERFECT seating to watch the debauchery.   The menu is pretty much what you expect. I've been to HB Munich, and this place wasn't much difference. One HUGE difference though. This German girl did not appreciate that the schnitzel was pork not veal.   Service was great despite the ridiculous amount of people in there. There was some sort of ski contraption that people were taking shots from. Provides more and more amusement as the night goes on!   There was a guy singing actual German music for most of the evening. Once it got later though the band came on. They play cover songs. Strangely enough quite authentic as Germans LOVE our cover songs.  The place also has a little shop to buy souvenirs inside in case you want to buy some HB souvenirs."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. The amazing beer brewed in house, the authentic food, the stage music. Everything.  I stopped in on my long drive home from Thanksgiving since I knew I would be driving through Pittsburgh. So glad I did!  I started with some warm, soft pretzels and beer cheese and a half litre of Dunkel (a house brew) that never fails to be delicious. Then went with the Bavarian platter for two that included some delicious sauerkraut, spatzle, schnitzel, fried cabbage, pork loin, and wursts! Overall a very nice spread and everything was extremely satisfying.   Typically though based on past experiences I would favor the Jagerschnitzel. It's deeeelicious.   The real winner of this whole experience though is the dessert. Apple strudel that is so to-die for. Warm, perfectly sweet and satisfying. This is the one thing you HAVE to try if you are coming here.   Hofbrauhaus is an amazing German experience you have to try!"}
{"text":"Accessible parking.  The restaurant feels sterile, even though the decor is Bavarian.  It's too quiet for a place called Hofbrauhaus.  Nevertheless, the beer is fresh and it was a great place to stop on a hot afternoon in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the environment in this place. People go here to be loud and have fun. The outside seating is great and the big hall is s great experience.   If you want to hold a conversation with people and chit-chat...not the place for you.   Beer: I just ordered one without asking questions first...mistake, maybe the first time in my life I ordered a beer and just refused to drink it. I learned after that they have a sampler, if you are not sure, try the sampler first. It will save you some trouble.   So my review for this place is mixed, IF you are looking for a loud place where people are having a good time with good food, do it, I just caution you to sample the beers before ordering a whole stein."}
{"text":"We just came for a beer and to try the pretzels and beer cheese, always a must for a German spot. The cheese tastes less like a german beer cheese and more like nacho cheese sauce, and I also wish it had mustard. All that said, it's still very tasty and hit the spot. They only have a hand-full of beers available, too bad, but there were some good ones in the mix. The best part is that they have a monthly rotating selection. I had to give it a try, and for August they offered the sommerweizer. It had that german beer flavor, just what I was looking for.   The real reason to visit this place is the huuuge outdoor terrace, with an upper section with waiter service and a lower picnic table area with drinking along the river. Really nice vibe and great views. Inside is also huge, totally different vibe with loud, live German music. The only real downside is that it is located a bit off from the main Carson Street stretch, about a ten-twelve minute walk from the rest of the Southside bars. Still, a cool spot worth a visit."}
{"text":"Gotta love the liter dunkels.  The food is decent depending on what you get. I feel like the pretzels and beer cheese are a little over-hyped. The schintzel sandwich is probably my favorite thing to eat there.  The place has a live band that usually plays good sing along songs (you are encouraged to stand on the benches but please don't stand on the table)  The shotskis are a fun thing to do with a group (expensive but where else do you get to take a shot off of a ski?)  All in all a good spot to hang out and chill. Once spring/summer rolls around the outside bier garden is a great place to just relax with a liter of beer and shoot the shit with your friends."}
{"text":"I could sit here and eat the beer cheese for 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. It is the absolute best you will find anywhere!!! Put it on EVERYTHING, because why not???  I ordered a pork chop and smothered it. It made an average chop out of this world!  I'm pretty sure I have to limit my visits here so I don't gain 100 pounds from cheese overload"}
{"text":"Appetizers were really good. Chicken was good but thick cut. Live music was great one of the best atmospheres in south side. Right on the river and great service."}
{"text":"PROS- Amazing food, great beer/ale choices, wonderful service along with a cozy Interior and a fantastic deck.  CONS- Too many out of control college kids who can't handle their alcohol consumption.   Recommendations: You must get the pretzels and secret sauce that comes with it. Get the jaeger schnitzel.  Get a kraner wurst also sehr gut. Get a stein. Get a side of red cabbage and kraut.  The interior is decorated in a warm old-school German tavern style.  The service is prompt and polite. The tap has a number of German ales/beer to choose from (all delicious and served in rather German ceramic mugs or tall pilsner glasses ) The food is incredible. I started with a beef goulash soup that had bursting flavors for my taste buds.  I always buy my jaeger schnitzel which is always cooked perfect with a savory dark mushroom gravy on top.    Lastly, sit outside and enjoy the panoramic views of the river."}
{"text":"This is a must stop if in Pittsburgh.  Great pretzel, plenty of beer to choose from.  The only thing I wasn't able to do was go here on a weekend night.  I was there on a Monday before a Pirates game.  Not many people there.  Great location, right on the water.  Friendly staff.  Seats 800 and I was told they get to standing room only on the weekends."}
{"text":"Good food, good beer, and the staff was pleasant. A little pricey, but on-par for a theme restaurant, I suppose. No complaints at all. It was ~25 degrees outside, but the enclosed patio was a comfortable temperature. Our server seemed to be somewhat new, but wasn't bad at all. The \"Christmasbier\" was addictive, as was the Hot Brown and Pretzels with Beer Cheese. Not sure why Yelp states \"not good for kids\" in earlier reviews. It's a little loud, but was enjoyable; our 8 and 12-year olds had a good time."}
{"text":"If you want to really enjoy a real German beer hall experience, come visit Hofbrauhaus on weekends when the place is packed with people. Excellent energy and vibe!  If you want to really appreciate how good and attentive the service, how huge the space both interior and exterior (patios overlooking the river, what a view!!), come visit Hofbrauhaus during weekdays.   Come visit Hofbrauhaus whenever and you will guarantee a good time!  Great beers, love my Hefeweizen and our Wurst platter - Bratwurst, Wiesswurst and Frankfurter ($13.99) was surprisingly good!   Sausage Feast! Beer serves in Stein!   Prost!"}
{"text":"Came here yesterday and we are back already. Really wish they had a spot in NJ or philly. There hefeweizen beer is delicious and light. They serve beer by the liter in huge steins. Anywho I had two beers and could of had a few (the baby size not the liter ). We had the cheese fries to start and not many places have cheese sauce at the bottom (why? I have no clue). So there was an endless supply of cheese. Apparently you can upgrade to put chili on top to make them like nachos. I was going for more of a marathon not a sprint so I opted out. Anyway, I ordered the hot brown with a fried egg on it. Apparently that's the way to do it, and I would agree that it is. It's a potato pancake with ham, turkey, bacon and egg with cheese on cheese on cheeses. It made me feel like . We had the pretzels with cheese too, so as you can imagine, I felt like I would die later. Thankfully I didn't so I could come back today!"}
{"text":"All I can say is, LOVED This place when I lived in Pittsburgh. Can't wait to visit the St. Petersburg location. So happy there is one here in Florida.    I suggest any of the authentic German options, which are indicated on the menu. I get the roasted half chicken, then ask for different sides, I love the red cabbage and beer cheese spatzle. The German potato salad, the potato dumpling, and the fried cabbage are also amazing.   Planning on trying the potato pancake and pierogies when I can."}
{"text":"I know, I know..... This is a chain.    I have been to the hofbrau in Germany.   While everything is based on this restaurant, I prefer the Pittsburgh version.   Service is always so much better.    While the pretzels are clearly better in Germany, the food and beer are on par.   I am a fan of schnitzel with hefe wiezen beer.    I get the liter because it is my favorite.   The down side to this place is it is extremely loud.....   So keep this in mind...."}
{"text":"Good Pretzel! As good as the one I had in Germany! The atmosphere during their busy time feels like the one in Munich! Servers carry their own change wallet just like in Europe."}
{"text":"Brought my family (group of 9) here for a nice dinner on the patio- great idea! They can accommodate large groups and there is plenty of beer to go around! The atmosphere is true to what you would find over in Germany- loud and boisterous! If you're not into loud music and chanting- sit on the patio- you'll be glad you did! The view is spectacular!  The food was also nice- ordered schnitzel sandwich and potato pancakes."}
{"text":"Went here on St. Patrick's Day so it was CROWDED. There are 2 dining areas and one is like a big hall with a stage. The other one through French doors is as roomy but a lot quieter.  Our party ordered a wurst dish and 2 shnitzel dishes. Shnitzel can be pretty dry so definitely go for the dishes that come with sauce! Taste is great and portions were reasonable but not too large (unfortunately). I like that all the waitresses were in German outfits. Management and staff were nice. One staff member cleared the way to the private bathroom with a changing table for my baby through the drunken crowd so I really appreciated that!   Location is cool because it's right next to the riverfront trail. I'm thinking we'll be back in the summer or spring! Prices for entrees are between $16 - $28 so a little on the high side. No free bread or pretzels :(. I got the apple strudel dessert and while the presentation was beautiful, the taste of the pastry was bland and soggy. I probably should have gone for the cream puff like I planned!"}
{"text":"Ahh so kitsch. The food is a step or two better than the meals at Ikea but their beer is pretty darn good and can easily tip a lightweight like me. I especially like that it's a place where all of Pittsburgh comes. Not just the college peeps. I see very large (in more than one sense of the word), and extended families enjoying time without the kids here, 20 somethings, and a group of people from my school. Again, I just go for the beer and I end up having a good time. It's one of the few restaurants that take advantage of the riverfront and for that I'm eternally grateful."}
{"text":"Hofbrauhaus is like Oktoberfest at Disneyland, it's an experience and fun, but if you look too closely you can tell it's a corporate entity. Does that make sense? I guess I've been spoiled, in terms of German food by Max's Allegheny Tavern, and my own Grandmother, because I've found the food at Hofbrauhaus passable at best. If you want a truly German food experience you'll find Hofbrau watered down, and if you're not into German food, but like the idea of a German Beer House then get the baby back ribs.  Okay, maybe the above was harsh, but in general I enjoy the beer and sitting in the beer garden during the summer. It's great to look out on the river have a liter or two of their Premium Lager and get some pretzels and cheese sauce. All in all, when I'm at South Side works looking to kill a few hours with some day drinking Hofbrauhaus has my back. Also, it's a great place to bring your country mouse cousin when they're in town."}
{"text":"This place was ridiculously awesome. As soon as I walked in, I saw people standing on benches singing and dancing. I wish we stayed inside longer, but we walked right through to the back and went outside where there were tons of tables right on the river.  It was pretty crowded, but the bar was so big that waiting to get drinks wasn't an issue and we didn't have a problem finding a table. The bartenders were friendly and quick. I ordered a laaarge Dunkel for $7.50. Their bathrooms were clean and huge, which is always a plus for me (no lines!).  It's great that you can be rowdy inside or chill outside. Definitely trying to stop in here next time I'm in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place. I had such a fun time there and I don't even drink beer. The cocktails are pretty good. The bartenders can make pretty much anything. They had some good food there as well. The table dancing was my favorite part of my night there."}
{"text":"I like this place. On a summer day I like the patio and balcony overlooking the Monongahela with the breeze off the river.  I like the cold, sharp, crisp beers. I like the fun, live German bands inside. I even like the Disney-esque German uniforms the waitstaff wears.  What I don't like about this place is the food.  I love sauerkraut, with \"sauer\" being the key part of that word. The kraut here lacks the sauer.  The sausages are bland.  The chicken dishes are bland.  Even the beer cheese is pretty dang bland.    The two best things I've found?  The pretzels with mustard (just regular ol' yellow mustard), and the salads, which are big with just the right amount of crunchy iceberg and romaine mixed with just the right amount of flavorful green leaves from other lettuces.  I'm not saying they're the best salads around, but they're better than anything else on the menu."}
{"text":"Wifey and I went to Hofbräuhaus for our annual summer visit.  I've been here a handful of times at night but we like the outside seating and it get's so busy at night.   It's not the best experience for us at night here.  So a few years back we came her during the day and it was great.  So when we visit Hofbräuhaus we usually come here early afternoon so we can soak up the sun, enjoy each other, take some cool pictures of us outside, and drinks some liters of beer!       I'm a wheat beer type of guy so I'm in heaven when I am here.  I'll drink their Hefe Weizen any time of the year but it' summer so I had their \"Sommer Weizen\".  This is just a great summer wheat beer.  Smooth, great color, great summer taste that is very enjoyable.  I wouldn't drink this one all year round if it was offered like the original Hefe Weizen but it's great for the summer.         Our favorite seasonal beer here no doubt is their HB Oktoberfest.  I would drink this one all year round.  We were a little early for this one because it should be available in September.  I hope we can find sometime to come back for that or I'll just have to pick some up at a store no doubt.       My rating is purely for the beer and the day time setting outside.  The bartenders and service was good.  I like the restrooms and they are clean.  Don't get me wrong about the night life here.  I like it here at night but it's too busy for us.  Were getting older we need some more peace and you can find that during the day.  We have never eaten any food here so I can't rate that but it's always tempting.  We just usually throw back a few here, take some cool pics of us drinking a liter of beer, and then we go to dinner somewhere else.         Come here on a warm sunny day, sit outside, get a liter of beer and you will have a great time here at Hofbräuhaus Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"If a large crowd of people standing on benches at long tables in a beer hall, dancing and waving gigantic mugs of German brew back and forth as they listen to a cheesy cover band is your idea of a good time, then Hofbrauhaus is the place for you.   I have a soft spot for a place where everyone is encouraged to party, and this place is just that. We went there on a Saturday night on a recent trip to Pittsburgh and the place was jam-packed and everyone was having fun.   The place is a little \"white\" ethnically speaking, music-wise, etc. The live band played old cover songs you'd probably hear at weddings, e.g., Neil Diamond, Billy Joel, etc.  You will find yourself singing along.   Beer is brewed there, and is good and cheap -- the  liters were about $8. The wheat beer was nice, so was the lager.  We didn't have the food, so I can't comment on that.  Go with a group of friends. It's a fun place!"}
{"text":"Beer Mugs that could crack a skull, check. German band with an accordion, check. Hostesses wearing Dirndl-s? that accentuates their majors in upper body asset management, check. Huge open dining room wit over sized tables and benches, check.  Everything at Hofbraushaus seemed larger than life including the patrons standing on their chairs and downing shots to the chants led by the band.  Our meal was more of a feast including a soft pretzel apps with bier cheese rich enough kill you and the old timer seated at the bar. For my entree I order the wiener schnitzel with steamed vegetables and German potato salad. The pork was fried perfectly and was both juicy and crispy and could easily last 2 meals. The potato salad had a nice balance of spice and was light on the mustard and mayo relative to picnic potato salads. It was a struggle to finish both my meal and my beer, but hey, I'm on vacation. Overindulgence is mandatory."}
{"text":"Been here numerous times this is my favorite stop when I get to go to Pittsburgh. The food and beers are good, the atmosphere is excellent, and the staff are always very friendly and accommodating. We normally will take a fairly nice size crowd with us when we go here and it is always accommodated perfectly. I have not found anything on the menu so far that I did not like."}
{"text":"Great pretzels and beer cheese! I am not a huge fan of their other food, but the soft pretzels definitely make up for where the menu may be lacking. Hofbrauhaus also has a great atmosphere and is tons of fun. I definitely recommend to anyone in the Southside Works area!"}
{"text":"I had my first beer ever here at Hofbrauhaus! I love the atmosphere of the expansive beer hall. Live music was fun, and who doesn't want to clank mugs of beer together while standing on tables? It does get very busy late night and service can get slow, but it's all part of the experience :-) I highly recommend this place; don't leave without having the pretzels and a shotski!"}
{"text":"I cannot emphasize enough how awesome this place is. Traditional German beer hall. The food is outstanding, I've never had a bad meal. The bier cheese needs to be tried.   Beer, let's be honest, this is why you come here. Two sizes, liter (as big as your head), half liter. All brewed on premise. 4 always on tap (my favorite is the Dunkel) and a monthly beer.   The staff is also a blast. From the rocking house band, to the polite wait staff, to the imposing security, everyone is nice as can be. Get up and jam. You can dance on the benches until your legs can't hold you up, but stay off the tables.   I recommend this as a stop anytime you visit Pittsburgh. When you are there, ask for Big Andy and tell him Neil said hi."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about this place! Authentic German cuisine, but also a variety of dishes with an American twist. It took me an hour to decide what to order because there were so many great dishes on the menu. The service was outstanding. Our server, Dana, was friendly, funny, and helpful. Her recommendations were right on and she was very attentive.  This is the best restaurant I've experienced in a very long time."}
{"text":"Decor is 10/10 and so is the beer but the food is garbage. I thought they were going to sell legit Bavarian food because some of it is imported. They managed to even Americanize the pretzel. The giant pretzel was nothing like a Bavarian pretzel- it was a glorified philly pretzel. I am not a pretzel elitist but they don't got the food down. A Bavarian pretzel is dark brown, borderline black, matte, and a lot denser. This was soft and fluffy and the cheese sauce was pretty much a less tangy cheese whiz.   The warm potato salad was garbage - slices were undercooked and seasoned all wrong. The use of food service thin sliced American bacon in the fried cabbage did the dish no favors because it comes off as pre-rendered so the fat didn't lend itself to the dish, instead you had these sad, floppy slices of bacon to suggest the miserable life the pig had. I know you have to adapt to the resources around you but it detracted from the dish. Cabbage was completely unremarkable.   The ultimate abomination was the schnitzel itself. The texture was spongy. It was disconcerting to why a cutlet had that texture. And it was not remotely crunchy for something deep fried which made it even worse. This my friend, is not a schnitzel. The wine mushroom sauce for the jaegerschnitzel was not rich and meaty like a real German gravy but was thin and flavorless like something out of a package.   This food was essentially mediocre theme park (a la Dixieland) \"German\" food and I'm confused why was it so mediocre when German food is probably the safest \"ethnic\" food and arguably has the most influence on American food overall (hot dogs, burgers).   For the love of Gött, HB Pittsburgh, make authentic and GOOD Bavarian food for the prices you charge or lower them if you're going to cut corners.   Silver lining is that the beer is solid and served at the right temperature. You wouldn't be able to tell the difference between this pint and one you got in a Biergarten in Munich."}
{"text":"The beer is good but the food is average. I had their light lager. I had the Bier cheese chicken and it reminded me of Fridays sizzling chicken and cheese-which is actually better at Fridays (and cheaper). Had the pretzels for an app and they were just like any other pretzel. The place was packed so I must be missing something. Parking was a nightmare. Just not worth the hassle to me. They really cram everyone in there. They had live music which was cool. Got there at 4 and had an hour wait on a Saturday. You can't make reservations."}
{"text":"The people here were really nice. I think they take some slack for the outfits, but they were still very kind.   Oh, and the beer is great..."}
{"text":"I'm partial to Hofbrau only in the summer....in the winter, it gets too cooped up, and I really can't stand the obnoxiously drunk singing inside.  I'm sure some people love it, but it's just not me.  I've spent a lot of time at this place, and you should definitely go here if you haven't been here, just be prepared for LOUD.   I highly recommend you go in the summer and head straight for the back...the downstairs patio outside is a great way to spend a summer evening.  A year ago I probably would have given them 5 stars, but nothing has changed and it gets stale after a while.  If you haven't been here though,  you should absolutely go...there's a reason there are so many reviews.    As far as food, I echo Rachel's sentiment:  TGIFridays but with German food.  The food doesn't do it for me.  Definitely a drinking spot only.    On to the things I do like...the 1L of wheat beer, and the beer cheese + pretzels.  You should get a liter of beer because, well, you can't get it in many other places.  And yes, it is brewed in haus."}
{"text":"We had dinner a couple of weeks ago before going to the Phipps winter show. The dinner was excellent, my husband had Weisswürste and I had the Schnitzel Wiener Art both was very delicious just like we had dinner in Germany. We also had dessert I had the Apple strudel with ice cream and my husband had the cream puff both was very good. Beer was also very good we tried the beer sampler, can`t wait until we come again!!"}
{"text":"People like to complain that the food is not the most authentic, but that is not why you go here, you go for the food, the shotski and the ambiance.  If you took time to stop complaining about how authentic the food is, you would realize that the food they have is actually pretty darned good.  I have always enjoyed their schnitzels.  The shank is very good.  THe apple desert is delicious.  And you can not beat the singing!"}
{"text":"Cheap, good beer.  Large portions of great food.    Women in those outfits... yowza!!  I go there for the beer and the food though, not the ladies, but the ladies are a nice addition...."}
{"text":"Deafeningly loud with an insanely long wait, the Hofbrauhaus is a victim of its own success.  I really enjoyed the food (I had the spaetzel entree, and shared the sampler appetizers with our table -- the sauerkraut balls were a surprise for someone who doesn't even like sauerkraut!) and the beer (custom brewed), but can't imagine going back until the shine's off the apple and Pittsburghers have moved on to the next big thing.    Great spot to do heavy drinking, though -- the \"shot-ski\" was a popular choice at the tables around us, and every time one came out, it commanded the attention of the whole hall."}
{"text":"I had steak at a German restaurant. I wasn't in a German food mood really. My steak was good, surprisingly. The mashed potatoes were amazing. My husband had the pork shank and it was gone before I could taste. They have live music every day. I can see it getting rowdy here with the raising beer pitchers and German chanting. Also walking distance from the Hyatt house and Spring hill suites."}
{"text":"I know this kind of a tourist trap/spot for the suburbanites because of its location and other things but I still like coming here. The food is always good and the beers. Well, the beers are out of this world."}
{"text":"A great taste of Americanized Germany without taking a trip overseas.  If you like getting drunk as F, drinking 1L beers, eating loads of food, and staring at bewbs, this is the place for you. The nice-looking waitstaff doesn't provide the best service ever, but how can you complain about cleavage popping out everywhere? That's what I thought. Suck it up and suck it down."}
{"text":"Hofbrauhaus is definitely in my top 5 favorite restaurants! I haven't been to the original but for Pittsburgh, they do a great job. The only real inconvenience is the wait time on the weekends. Also, I've unfortunately noticed the service being not as great in the outside section. But the unique atmosphere and the big beers as well as the excellent service inside the bar & dining area makes it totally worthwhile! There is a cute little gift shop inside. This is my go to for authentic German cuisine and a traditional German experience. You could make a nice evening out of coming here and not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This review is only for the beer and experience. Hofbrauhaus is huge and fun if you are there with a big group. The beer is tasty, especially the lager and dunkel.  IMO the hefeweizen is a bit heavy with the banana and clove but perhaps that's how a true hefeweizen  should taste like.   I get annoyed inside with repetitions of living on a prayer, sweet caroline, sweet home alabama and steelers fight songs so I'm almost always outside. The people there eat it up but having already experiencing four years of drunk idiots singing journey, experiencing it again is nauseating.   The kids are young, Many 21 year olds chose this place to celebrate their coming of age. But really the clientel ranges from these 21 year olds to 80 year olds attempting to get jiggy with it.   Outside is very nice, ample seating and nice views.  Its a great pace to take visitors to see something they can't see everywhere.   Overall, a place to go with friends to enjoy a beer before heading somewhere else or a place to linger all night if that's your thang.    Like tanqueray, hofbrauhaus is good only in moderation."}
{"text":"Went here to break Passover this year  What we sampled:   Beer sampler       Definitely a good way to try different beers, to get an idea of what you like. I was really interested in the Hefeweizen with flavors of banana and clove.  It was definitely interesting smelled like bananas and tasted like cloves.  Appetizer sample      The beer cheese and pretzels were great and the sauerkraut balls were definitely interesting.  I wasn't such a big fan of the potato pancakes though.  Beer Cheese spatzel      Total winner of the night.  It was awesome.  Apple Streudel      A classic, though I don't know if I would order it again.  Not really my thing.   Service was great and helpful!"}
{"text":"Every time I come to Pittsburgh, I make sure to go to Hofbrauhaus! For any German beer fan who has been living under a rock, Hofbrauhaus is a German Biergarten in Munich.  Each time I come to Hofbrauhaus, I make sure to try one of their seasonal beers. So far, I have tried the Weizenbock, Bavarian Wheat and the Marzen. Outside of this, I have tried most of their other beers with the Weizen being my favorite. The great thing about the Hofbrauhaus in Pittsburgh is the fact that they brew their beers there! This means you will always get a fresh beer!  As for the food; the food is always great! It's a little expensive; however, the portions are huge! When I go, I always split the Schmankerlplatte with someone. This plate consists of Schweinsbraten, Smoked Pork Chops, three kinds of Wursts, Sauerkraut, Fried Cabbage, and Mashed Potatoes. It's huge! Everything on it is great!  My only complaint with this place is the lack of parking; however, this is an issue pretty much anywhere you go in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I have to give this place a split personality review.  The party side of me says this place is a heck of a good time!  The foodie side of me says this place compares to a TGIFridays, but with German food.   The first time I came here was right after they opened....so I wanted to come for the food and drink.  It was the dead of winter so the outdoor area wasn't open yet and we were shoved in the corner of the large dining room.  I couldn't decide what to order because I love sauerkraut, I love cabbage and I love German Potato Salad!  It's sad I didn't even want any of the meats, all sides!  So I just stuck to those and apps.  I mean who can go wrong with those choices??   So the fried pickles were good and....fried.  Check.  The sauerkraut was like mush.  Ew.  I expect good sauerkraut from a German place!  I want it crisp and tart.  Just plain mush.  The German Potato salad, mushy as well.  Potato's, mushy....no flavor.  Yuck.  Fried Cabbage...you hear me....FRIED....was mush!  Seriously, horrible!  I would never come here to eat again.    On the other side....   Atmosphere is fantastic! The dining room is really rambunctious! They have people standing on tables and singing.  they have a HUGE shot luge where a bunch of people have to take shots at once.  And the outside...FANTASTIC!  It's this huge open area with picnic tables and a large bar.  Plus you're right smack against the river so it's really pretty out to.  Pretty for a beer garden I suppose!  The beer comes in these huge liters, which is great in theory, but if you're not slamming them back it gets warm and nasty.  I'm always a lager fan, so I had the Hofbräu Premium Lager.  It was pretty much lager like.  Nothing to write home to Germany about.   So remember, food gross but drinking atmosphere GREAT!"}
{"text":"My husband is convinced they make the most delicious lager in town; so nothing makes him happier than a trip to Hofbrauhaus for a liter. I tend to agree, though I go more for the spaetzle and schnitzel.   I personally think their beer is better than than the food. Their brewers are awesome! For good ole' German fare, I prefer the schnitzels at Max's Tavern or the menu at Penn Brewery, esp when they break out the Penn Oktoberfest. But at Hofbraus, there is something very special and festive about the Great Hall with the accordion player or the magically lit biergarten on warm summer nights that makes it an easy choice for any kind of beer and pretzel hankering. Located off the bike trail in the South Side Works area, it is very easily accessible by bike or boat with the new addition of the marina.   We like to try their monthly food and beer pairings as they are usually very good and off menu.  They will let you sample the different beers before you commit to a liter or half liter which is nice.  It is a huge space with plenty of seating inside and out, making it an easy meet up place for family and friends."}
{"text":"I was not impressed.  The beer wasn't very good (I tried the amber one, it tasted like the keg lines hadn't been cleaned in a while).  The whole place smells like a fart.  The worst part was that the doormen were really rude.  My wife's id was hole-punched because she is getting a new one because her name is changing.  Even though she is clearly older than 21 (she's 26) they wouldn't let her drink.  Not a huge deal, they were just following the law.  But they proceeded to assign staff to watch us the entire night.  A greasy ogre literally followed us around and watched to make sure she wasn't drinking."}
{"text":"My husband and I were excited to go here for the first time. I reserved a table through Yelp no waitlist. It worked great. We walked through the door they were tons of people waiting in line and I was able to go to the front of the line and get seated right away. However they seated us on the enclosed patio, where it was cold. The restaurant was extremely busy, so I don't hold this against them. But it took forever for food. The food left a lot to be desired.This place is known for their beers, however of the long list of beers none of them were available. Only had a choice of three beers. $80 later plus tip we left. As we walked through the main room, it looked like people were having fun. But unfortunately we didn't get to have any fun out on the patio. I don't think we will be back anytime soon. If you do go, wait to be seated in the main room, Expect to sit with strangers, and don't go there when you're famished."}
{"text":"Hofbrauhaus is not for me.  They have tasty sandwiches (pretzel sandwich!), pretzels and beer cheese, and--of course--beer. The Dunkel is the best of the regular options, to my taste.    I'm not into the whole concept-- the canned, Disney-version-of-Bavaria with Oompa accordion music, waitresses in skimpy outfits, drunk people standing on communal tables, kitschy sing-alongs, mega-sized TV screens with all the sports events blaring-- just no. The noise and the crowds mean that you need to go there for the express purpose of enjoying the aforementioned other stuff.  There's no doubt it's a fun place; it's just that Hofbrauhaus is not my idea of fun.   I feel a bit bad about writing a critical review without suggestions for improvement, as it's the whole corporate concept that's not to my taste.  The point of this review is to suggest that there are so many better options for grown ups to drink a beer in Pittsburgh, especially if conversation is a goal.  If watching sports, singing, and getting smashed are goals, then you might have a heck of a fun time."}
{"text":"In town for one night from DC and had a great time.  Food was decent but the beer, music and ambiance was part of what made this a great time for my wife and me.   The  best part of our visit though was the service - Kelsey was so helpful, so much fun and so doggone good at her job that even if the ambiance had \"sucked\" I'd make it a point to come back again. Thank you Kelsey- it was a tough night for us and you made it a lot of fun.  We are very grateful."}
{"text":"Great lively atmosphere!  Traditional food and beer.  Our meals were spot on as well as the delicious desserts.  Make sure you add ice cream!"}
{"text":"We are fans of the original Hofbrauhaus in Munich.  Yes it's a tourist trap, but the beer is great and the atmosphere is always festive.  Our own Hofbrauhaus on the South Side is remarkably similar to its German cousin.  The menu is somewhat Americanized but the beer is pure Munich.  Located along the beautiful Mon river trail, close to the new marina, it has become a walking destination for us, especially when the biergarten is open.  My personal favorites are the Oktoberfest beer in season (one of the few beers imported from Germany rather than brewed on the premises) and the schnitzel Holsteiner style (topped with a fried egg)."}
{"text":"Came here in April and tried their April tap called \"hopfen spezial\". It's exceptional- great crisp taste on a sunny hot day. The service is great and all the waitresses are very friendly. I'd come back."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to hit with the guys when I'm in the PGH. The brew is not half bad and the food keeps me satisfied. My only complaint is that this place can get really busy on the weekends and you have to pay for parking in a nearby garage."}
{"text":"I am German and was looking forward to the Hofbräuhaus food. What a huge disappointment!! The food there doesn't even come close to German food! It was just a thrown together of what someone thought was German. Bah!! It was disgusting! The only good thing was the beer. I advise everyone who wants to try authentic German food to not go to this place. German food is so very much better than that crap!"}
{"text":"Just isn't German enough to get more stars from me.  if it weren't for the really big and good beers, I would not keep going back for more..."}
{"text":"I have been here several times to enjoy the beer and music, but hadn't eaten here until recently. I was pleasantly surprised! We started with the pretzels and bier cheese. In general I am not a bug pretzel fan but these were great. And the cheese sauce was AMAZING - I would have eaten it with a soon if I had one. For my entrée I had the Wurstplatte, which is a sampler of the bierwurst, bratwurst, and frankfurter. The food in general is pretty heavy, but I still managed to clean my plate. The wursts were very good, and the sides of mashed potatoes and sauerkraut were delicious.  This is not the kind of place I could be a regular at, but it is definitely a great spot to enjoy every so often, and it is great for groups. While the music can be pretty loud, there are enough tables further back that you can still partake in the fun while enjoying conversation at the same time."}
{"text":"I probably would have rated this higher before I ate hofbrahaus in Germany. The food doesn't compare but is still good. Love the beer garden. Be prepared to fight for a table in the beer hall. And if you like a nice quiet atmosphere, this isn't the place for you! Something fun you should experience in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"This restaurant was amazing!  First, the prices were great.  We were a bit taken aback when the bill arrived, but approximately 12.00 for a lunch buffet was a great price and the drinks were fair too.  The food itself, for a buffet was excellent!  Very German and I would highly recommend the mashed potatoes and the sauerkraut!    Our waitress was prompt and attentive and kept a close check on us.  The entire atmosphere was very, very German, which lent to the entire experience!  As I said, we were there for lunch, so it wasn't crowded and I can't speak to the dinner time activities, but I would definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"Had a great time tonight. Justin was a great server. He's funny and very personable. We ordered a couple of beers. I enjoyed the Pittsburgh seasonal. The works appetizer was very good (I don't like sauerkraut but still found it good). We ordered our dinner to go which they had no problem with. We ate at our hotel next door and the food was amazing. They also had live music and my advice is not to go to the quiet dinning room but into the beer garden."}
{"text":"I always can fall for places that have good brews/drinks, any apps that have cheesy dips (pretzels are a must) and hearty entrees in a cozy or casual setting. Hofbrauhhaus has all my weaknesses in one spot. It's not too far off like the original in Munich, Germany."}
{"text":"Food was awesome. Ambience was like Oktoberfest. Large beer selection with a friendly, knowledgeable staff. It is loud so not a great a place for a quiet dinner but if you are looking for authentic German food in a fun atmosphere then this is the place to go in Pittsburgh"}
{"text":"Best way to start a Sunday is drinking beer while watching football. The Hofbrau Haus has multiple tv a so that you can watch from any corner of the room. They don't have many beers on draft, but they do have monthly beer specials and you can guarantee to find German beer here (go figure!). Service is dressed in something that resembles traditional German dress and are very friendly.   All I have to say about the food, though, is I've had better. We found out the pirogies are microwaved Mrs. Ts that anyone could buy at the grocery store. This makes me question everything else we ate there. We're the bratwurst Johnsonville? The French fries Oreda? Should I just go to the nearest Giant Eagle and make my meal myself?  The answer in this case is yes.   Good beer, microwaved food, in the future I'll just travel to Munich so I don't feel like I'm completely ripping off a culture."}
{"text":"Hafbrauhaus is a lovely large brewery that sits on the river near the southside works.  They have a huge, and I mean huge beer hall that is very similar to the one in Munich.  The outdoor seating is awesome, and definitely my favorite part of the restaurant.  I'm not a beer far, and to be honest I go here often because DH is a beer connoisseur.  However I do love the beer here, and I don't feel bad that I can't sip down a nice glass of Merlot.  The food is just OK in my opinion, but then again I don't love eating large plates of sausage and meats.  The atmosphere is what redeems this place in my eye and it's awesome.  They always have live music and livelier people.  It's totally kosher to get smashed, dance on the tables, and belt your lungs out like a complete idiot...which I love.  Definitely check out this place for a good time."}
{"text":"If you don't like rowdy, this isn't the place for you. We waited an hour on a Saturday evening, which we expected so it wasn't a big deal. When moving to our seats we squeezed through a tight hallway past numerous staff and customers wandering around with beers. It was -loud- but fun loud. I ordered a Hefeweizen to drink and was very satisfied - easily one of the tastiest beers I've ever had. It had a light fruity aftertaste which I loved.   We got the works sampler for an appetizer and everything on it was A+. The bier cheese was sooooo good, and I didn't want to share any of the potato pancakes. We also ordered the pierogie which came on a bed of fried cabbage with bacon and loaded with chives and onion tanglers and was amazing. For my entree I got the Wurstplatte; all three sausages were delicious, and the mashed potatoes and sauerkraut were perfect accompaniment. Best kraut I've ever had by a long shot.   Service was upbeat and attentive, definitely a great experience."}
{"text":"Delicious!!!  I ate pretty much the entire menu with my friends there.  Spaetzle was awesome!!!  Wienerschnitzel with the fried egg on top....amazing...  Service was excellent and the food and drink were great.  It was hilarious watching these old high school group of friends (probably in their 40s or so and were probably Pittsburgh lifers) doing shotskis and drinking up a storm and then we got to see boobs as one of them flashed the entire room.  It was hilarious and so cute because you could tell they had been friends for god knows how long and  truly loved Pittsburgh.  It's nice to see that kind of unquestionable dedication.    And old boobs.  LMAO!"}
{"text":"My husband LOVES this place. Beer selection is great. Service is always great. Food is superb! Music is great to listen to."}
{"text":"I happen to love the Hofbrauhaus. I bring my family and friends here every time they come into town.   Some people like to hate on the haus because it's food isn't super authentic and it's clientele is often frat-tastic, popped collars and all. I look beyond that and see the good beer served in giant mugs, guys dressed in lederhosen playing music, and in my opinion very good food.  Beer: Hofbrauhaus only servers their own beers to you only have a choice of their 4 main beers the Lager, Light Lager, Hefeweizen, and Dunkel. They also have a different specialty beer every month so when you go back you have something different to try.  Food:  I happen to really like their food. I have had several of their dishes and have liked all of them. I have always received good service and the food quality and preparation has always been consistent.   What's not to like. You will have fun when you go here, end of story."}
{"text":"Amazing food! I got to try German potato salad for the first time and it was very good! A little pricey maybe but the large portions make up for that and then some! We'll be visiting again for sure!"}
{"text":"Open until 11pm but close their kitchen at 9pm. From out of town and a local recommended it. Disappointed."}
{"text":"This place just took me by surprise. The ambience was outstanding. The staff were all dressed up and really friendly. The drinks and food were good. The place is not highly priced. I would highly recommend this place for a drink. Cheers!"}
{"text":"First time visiting here. The food was excellent. The service was fantastic. Atmosphere was great. We will come back soon and bring more people with us. If you have a chance please stop in and visit and have a great time. Also, the beer is fantastic."}
{"text":"The Hofbrauhaus here in Pittsburgh is, in my opinion, the best one here in the states (we've been to all of them except Cincinnati). My husband is from Bavaria & it is our favorite German food in the burgh. They have an extensive menu with tons of mouth watering options. You're sure to find something you like. I'm even a vegetarian and have had plenty of options to choose from. Their veggie burger on a pretzel bun with beer cheese is delicious. The nachos without meat & the appetizer sampler (minus the sauerkraut balls) are also good meat-free options.   The atmosphere is so fun at the Hofbrauhaus. It's a great place to go with our son because he is often entertained with a live band. In the summer, be sure to get a seat outside in the beer garden for a great seat along the river.   Always had great service even when the servers are slammed.   Overall love this place."}
{"text":"I dug it, but definitely only the part OUTSIDE where the polka band and college kids shaking their asses on tables WEREN'T.  I was kind of disappointed by the soft pretzels:  They seemed like they came from a microwave and the cheese wasn't as flavorful as I excitedly thought it would be.  Maybe I expected too much?  My hefewiezen was GOOOOOOOODDDDDDDDDDDD to the point where I drank about 2.5 times as much as I should have.  The guy waiting on us was a complete angel-- I'd go INSANE if I had to wait on that many plastered barely legals on a regular basis, but he seemed genuinely unbothered."}
{"text":"This is a weird place. I went with my brother and sister in law over Christmas and our friends didn't know they had to reserve a table beforehand. We put out name on the list and stood around drinking, singing with the band, going to the patio for those who smoked, and closed the place but never did get a table. Never ever. No table for us, so no food ordered or paid for. Just beer. I was glad they cut you off after so many beers, because one of our party had gotten her hands on an extra one after she was cut off and thrown out. (She needed to be thrown out.) But then she broke her leg out front. Crazy night, and I would've liked to try the food but won't be back. Once was enough."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time yesterday instead of Max's on North Side.  The open dining area felt like an authentic German hall sort of thing -- kind of like what I would imagine the German hall at Busch Gardens in Williamsburg would be like.    Service was pretty good.  For an appetizer, we got pretzels and bier cheese.  It was pretty tasty, but the bier cheese was kind of dry and stuck to the roof of my mouth (but it was totally worth it).  Ordered the schnitzel cordon bleu, which is fried veal, ham, and bier cheese on top, and for sides I substituted with a potato pancake and sauerkraut.  The food was really good and fresh, although the bier cheese was still pretty dry (maybe that's how it's supposed to be, I don't know.)  Overall, I had a pretty good experience here at the Hofbrauhaus, although I would still choose Max's over it."}
