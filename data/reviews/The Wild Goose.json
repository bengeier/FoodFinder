{"text":"Had a wonderful time here tonight! Wish I was in the area more often. The pizza here is outstanding! And the staff makes you feel at home as soon as you sit down at the bar. Wonderful place! Can't wait to get back up there!"}
{"text":"We arrived around 6pm on a rainy weeknight, so it wasn't very busy. We were enjoying ourselves until we noticed our waitress didn't split the bill for our party of 12 (6 couples), so we had to spend 30 minutes reviewing the itemized drinks/meals, trying to figure out what each person owed. When I complained about the inconvenience, the waitress talked back with attitude, rather than offering to help. She also billed us for items we never ordered."}
{"text":"I live in St. Louis but come to Willoughby Ohio monthly.  I ALWAYS come by here for a Pizza, every trip.  The ONlY Pizza I have had (outside of my hometown pizza joints) that is superior.  Really good stone hearth cooked pie.

Seamus and McPat rule."}
{"text":"I received a free personal pizza through a Belly deal.  I went at 1:30 pm on Saturday, November 9, 2013 to redeem my deal and was hoping that the Wild Goose would live up to all the positive review.

There are many tv's in the bar and restaurant but things were not loud.  There were about 25 people in the restaurant and that is a great crowd on a Saturday afternoon.  I sat at the bar and ordered my pizza and a beer.  The bartender/server was very nice and placed the order.

The pizza was fresh out to a brick pizza oven and looked like a medium pizza that was cut in half.  The cheese was perfectly melted and the pepperoni delicious.  The pizza crust was nice and crisp on the bottom so that you can hold the slice and eat without having it droop and fall on the plate.

I have to admit, the pizza was amazing and I will return soon for more.  I really loved my visit and look forward to trying the other menu offerings."}
{"text":"Wild goose is a must if your in the mood for pizza! Seriously, some of the best pizza I've eaten in my lifetime."}
{"text":"Rwally bad pizza and salad.  But worse they werw super slow and then left our food out to get cold on the counter for 10 minutes.  Really disappointing lunch."}
{"text":"Stopped in the other night for dinner with the family.  

Ordered a pizza on happy hour menu that was fantastic.  Would order it again.  My wife got coconut shrimp was was good.  My son ordered a fish sandwich that he really liked a lot.  Daughter order the seafood dip as a meal and  enjoyed it.  I enjoyed the fact it was also on the happy hour menu!

Wait staff was around the table with drinks as needed.  She was very friendly. 

The place was crowded which is a good sign into book.  

I would go back in a heart beat.  We enjoy the downtown Willoughby atmosphere a lot."}
{"text":"I am very much a fan of this place. Is a great place to hang out and everyone who works here is very inviting. Definitely one of the best happy hours around. Great beer selection and great pizzas."}
{"text":"My husband and I hosted a luncheon here on a Sunday. The owner was very responsive and helpful as we were planning the event. Liz (I belive she is the manager) was so great as well! We had about 40 guests, and all the feedback was positive. We will be back!"}
{"text":"The pizza crust is really good at this place. They have a nice selection of pizza toppings, including marinated artichokes and roasted eggplant. They have good specials ($2 Coronas on Mondays for happy hour). The bar isn't overall very large, but that's what's nice about it.

Just a warning for vegetarians that go here, their stuffed mushrooms are NOT vegetarian. They have sausage in them, but it's not listed on their menu. I would not typically expect them to have any meat on them, especially if all their menu says is, \"Topped with provolone.\" So just take note of that if you go here and are vegetarian."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere & wonderful pizza! My 3 girlfriends & I shared the warm sundried tomato spinach dip (which was amazing), along with the margherita & bianco pizzas; Delicious from the stone/wood burning oven! Great wine too! Music wasn't too loud so we were able to chat & enjoy ourselves. They took great care of us & we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We heard good things about this place so we decided to try it.     It was pretty busy and when we arrive but we were able to get a table right away. When it's crowded in there it is so loud you cannot even hear yourself think   We've been to places that are loud in the past but this place is ridiculous.     I actually got a headache from all the noise.  We ordered pizza  they are known for the pizza was just mediocre at best we had to wait quite a while before it came.   I know this place gets a lot of good reviews God bless you all but it's not for us"}
{"text":"Very disappointing. It seems the staff thinks socializing with the regulars is more important that serving others. I also saw some fraternizing between coworker and owner which seemed in poor taste. Also, taste, my pals raved about their pizzas, we thought they were fair to good but nothing to get excited about."}
{"text":"What a great place to eat and just hang out.  I went there on a tuesday night with friends who have been there before and recommended the place.  I was immediately  impressed with Wild Goose because of the wide variety of imported beer selection. We were greeted by the owner who was both pleasant and cordial.  He told us the special for Tuesday is buy a pint of beer and a pizza for $7.  We jumped at the chance.  The pizza is cooked in a stone oven and was delicious.  The peperoni was crisp the sausage was very tasty.  The pizza's oozed over with plenty of cheeze and the crust was cooked to the perfect crispness.  The night continued and the staff continued to chat and mingle with us.  We became very relaxed and had some more beers.  Later as we sat the owner was experimenting with a new dish (stuffed pepper) because he got some fresh peppers earlier in the day.  He offered us to try and we eagerly did and it was fabulous.  We recommended he put it on the menue.  In the future Wild Goose will be a place I visit, the daily specials all are very affordable and the food is excellent.  I can't wait"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved Wild Goose
Pizza is phenom
First time
Went for UFC 194
Great screens for the event
Management is super friendly, hospitable
FUN-loving atmosphere
Great service"}
{"text":"Came for lunch on 12/28.  Nice brewpub, plenty of beer selections.  What really got my attention was the EXCELLENT pizza!  We ordered the Tony Roni and the Buff Chick.  Both were spicy as advertised, loaded with toppings, and full-sized.  Crust was really exceptional, thin and crisp/charred around the edges.  I travel to Naples, Italy regularly and this crust rivaled the ones I love from the cradle of pizza.  And of course, the Willoughby Brewery is just a block away offering really great brews!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!  Same owners as morehouse and a few other places and these guys really know how to run a restaurant!  Service is always fantastic, the rotating beer selection is great, and the stone oven pizzas are the best you'll find! They don't carry my favorite irish whiskey (Hellcat Maggie) but I can't hold that against them."}
{"text":"A brick oven baked pizza with my drinks? Well, ok! Actually, it looks like they cook pretty much everything in that oven......Good stuff! Nice place in DTW. Really friendly service."}
{"text":"I have to give this bar a five.  I am a margarita pizza junky and they've got the best I've ever had.  They drizzle a balsamic reduction over the pizza and I am hooked!  The pizza's are cooked in a stone oven and everything I've tasted on the menu has been delicious!  

The staff is fun and friendly.  It's a great hang out for locals or visitors alike!  Very nice selection of craft beers as well.  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Saturday nite visit and the joint was hopping. As a bar, this place is great. As a restaurant, the menu is essentially limited to salads, pizza and a couple of wraps. We had wraps and salads. Food was ok, nothing truly special. Staff was friendly and pleasant. Service was good. However, the noise level was an assault on the ears!  

Not likely to return unless they figure out how to turn the volume down so you don't have to yell across the table!"}
{"text":"This place always seems to be busy every time I go. Always has the best bar staff and the food is always made from scratch. One of the best spots in DTW"}
{"text":"UPDATE: I found out you can do take out as well.  I called ahead and drove down 15 minutes later to pick up a pepperoni pizza to take home.  It was only $8 and it was COVERED with pepperoni.  No skimping!  Warm, soft, crispy, delicious crust.  Another happy experience at WG!

I'm still kind of new to Yelp but if I can figure out how to post a pic of the pizza I will do so!"}
{"text":"My husband and I's favorite place to go. Amazing food and great atmosphere. The chorizo dip is to die for and they always have great seasonal beers. They cook their food in a stone oven right in front of you to see. Clean and well laid out there's almost always an open seat upon walking through the door. The staff is friendly, professional and very personable. They feel more like friends at this point. I highly recommend this place and can't wait to see McPat, Michaela, Hunter, Jeff, Gretchen and everyone else soon!"}
{"text":"The food was very good, had the stone baked pizza and it came out great.  Nothing like cooking a pizza in the stone pizza oven.  My girlfriend had the sub sandwich which was great.  The service was very good.  One of the owners, McPat, came over to make sure everything was OK.  Plan on going back.  Would recommend to others."}
{"text":"Best margarita pizza. Yummy humus. But better to eat in than take out, because it affects the quality. Bummer."}
{"text":"So here was the situation. It was 1pm on a Sunday afternoon, my friend and I were westsiders headed out to Eastlake, and I was as hungover as a college football mascot the day after homecoming. Desperate for any place that wasn't going to make me eat eggs, and would also provide some hair of the dog, we pulled off in Willoughby and searched the GPS for anything that sounded promising. Even though I thought Oliver Twist was the kind of cutesy name that might end up with us sitting in a dining room next to a collection of Charles Dickens theme dolls, we went with it, and parked in downtown Willoughby, which immediately gave me Berea flashbacks. Oliver Twist was closed. But there seemed to be a lot of other eateries on the strip, so we walked down looking for someplace. Closed Closed Closed. Apparently if you can't get your butt out of bed before 11 in Willoughby, you are screwed for brunch. Dejected, we walked back the car, me vocally denouncing the whole lousy place, when we saw people walking in the Wild Goose, and decided to see if they had food. 

Man, did Chance help us out there. The bartender was immediately helpful and super friendly. My hangover was a little dismayed at the prospect of pizza, but the fire pizza oven convinced me and I ordered a simple garlic oil one with some bacon and olives. My friend is one of those guys who can eat a horse, so he ordered the seafood dip, the Irish potato soup, and a Wild Goose pizza. Given how cheap the pizzas were, we were expecting them to be small. But no, they were quite regular pizza sized, and we ended up with a ton to take home. They had just changed the menu the day before, and so they made him the old version of the Wild Goose, which had duck and apples on it, instead of the corned beef one on the new menu. I know, that old one sounds fantastic right? It was, but he isn't into sweet things, so they immediately made him the right one, with no fuss and super quickly, which he also liked a lot. The Irish potato soup was amazing. I don't eat seafood, but he couldn't stop raving about the dip. My own pizza was also great - the crust was thin and crispy the way I love it, and they don't skimp on the toppings at all. If I lived in Willoughby (never going to happen but) I would order pizza from here all the time. 

The entire staff was wonderful, and if you live on that side of town or like us find yourself there accidentally, you should totally stop in."}
{"text":"Fabulous food.   Their craft beer selection is awesome.   We cannot find a bad pizza on their menu.   Just got the \"J Ceasy\" and the \"That's a Buff Chick\"...both are FABULOUS!   Meghan was our fun loving bartender.   I am not sure of our Pizza Extraordinaire cooks name but he is awesomely personable!!!   Had a BLAST!!!"}
{"text":"Friday lunch stop and was hoping for so much more having been here in the past and had great pizza.  Service was worse then the food very slow and not overly concerned with the customers that were there at around 3pm.  Took about 5 min after seating are selfs at a dirty table to get are menus and to order waters. I mentioned we were on lunch break and only had limited time to eat. Took a quick glance at the menu and decided on cajun rubbed wing and seafood dip, only problem was we did not see the waitress for another 10 min after that.  She finally came to check on uae and we placed our orders wings and dip for me, buff chick wrap and buff chick dip for my coworker.  Luckly the food came out pretty quick, my wings were nice and crispy and the dry rub had good flavor but not great for almost $1 a wing.  The seafood dip which was half price for happy hour was very good and the garlicy flat bread that came with it was good but cold.  The wings were good but not worth $10 for what you get and the seafood dip was good but not worth the $8 full price for what it is.  
Overall service needs some work on the off times with out a dought. The food is nothing special for some of the prices on things but o will say the pizza that i have had in the past is and will be my go to after exploring other mediocre menu options."}
{"text":"I've patronized the owners' bars for years.
Today I'm compelled to tell you that they need to need to spell their menu out in terms of ingredients and consider a personnel change.
I have a food allergy.
The allergy item in question was not listed on the menu. 
I ordered and was told...\"no that's listed in the menu\". It wasn't. 
She was rude. Unapologetic. 
I'm not looking for a free handout. 
I have been in customer service for 15 years...
As a local gal...the power in word of mouth is unprecedented. 
Learn about it."}
{"text":"We came to The Wild Goose for lunch, and were not disappointed. We each ordered a pizza and found them all to be delicious. Not too much bread, crispy, with fresh tasty toppings. I ordered the Grace Kelly (added sausage) and loved it. You can build your own or choose from their suggested combinations. 
As a group of five we were also impressed with the service. Joe the bartender took great care of us. 
While we couldn't drink on lunch, I did notice they had an impressive craft beer selection. 
Would revisit!"}
{"text":"Good selection of different pizzas- I have tried most of them and have yet to disappointing. The only thing missing is would love to see an egg and bacon pizza ! If you like spicy some of them have a good kick.

The dips are delicious as well but sometimes they only serve pizza (late night) so be sure to go for dinner.  Lots of tvs for games , largish bar but not lots of tables for dinner."}
{"text":"Decided to give this a try when I was visiting my boyfriend right after he got out of class at nearby Lakeland Community College.  We both wanted to try out a new place and this sure fit the bill--sounds like it opened earlier this year.

We both enjoyed the good selection of about 10 draft beers, including some of the upscale bar standards (Guinness, Harp, etc.) as well as a few more unusual microbrew choices.  It looked like they had a large liquor selection but we did not partake of mixed drinks this time.  As it was a bit later than the usual dinnertime (after 8 PM), it was largely a drinking and not eating crowd and they had a decent sized, attractive, younger group there.  For those of you wondering.

We ordered the hummus, the Hot Potato pizza, and a veggie sandwich.  

The hummus, as others have noted, is clearly the homemade variety and a red pepper flavor, and served with what appeared to be seasoned slices of pizza crust.  I thought it pretty delicious, though traditionalists might balk at their substitute for pita.

The Hot Potato pizza was glorious, basically homemade mashed potatoes (the real kind) on top of a thin crust of pizza, where you can't tell where one carb ends and the other begins.  All of this topped with cheddar and bacon.  Very good, and I have a ton of leftover slices for the money ($12), so even though it's one of the pricier choices it did not seem unreasonable.

My BF is vegan, so he ordered the veggie sandwich sans cheese.  It still comes with a smear of their hummus and also olive tapenade, and many veggies, so I think he liked it as more than just an ordinary veggie sandwich.  However, one noted downside--which I think they could easily fix--as someone looking to go out dining with a vegan in tow, I do appreciate online menus as they confirm whether there are options for him.  The Wild Goose is so new they don't have this yet, but it's something I'd recommend to entice picky, veggie, or vegan folks to your place."}
{"text":"Nice location, inside is cozy and the pizzas are extraordinary. The best was the waitstaff, these guy's were the best, they keep you well maintained and recommend stuff you didn't know you needed (like ranch to cool the smoking pizza we ordered). Highly recommended and we will return."}
{"text":"Loved this place! The servers were awesome. Sat with us at times, gave great recommendations and just made us laugh throughout the whole evening. They have live music on Saturday nights which was also a fun surprise.

The food was also solid. We tried their version of a supreme pizza and it was delicious. Light, chewy crust and a delicious red sauce and lots of veggies. Yum! They also have an impressive beer selection list.

Great time! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"We popped into this great bar on Saturday, the night of the big fight. All the tables ( all tables in every bar in willoughby were reserved) were reserved but a server looked around for us then got us a seat at the bar. Bartenders  were awesome! So friendly, funny, professional, and attentive on a very busy night. The bartenders worked the entire bar non-stop. We had a meatball sandwich and a taco  salad. Good food!! Good drinks and beer choices. Definitely a great place to drop in for a drink or plop down for dinner and enjoy good food and drinks all night."}
{"text":"I gave this place such a low rating due to the false advertisement, both in-bar & out-of-bar.  The reason I came in was because of Cleveland Beer Week 2015.  Advertisement in Cleveland Scene stated that on 10/12 they were featuring Jackie O's from Athens, OH.  From being out-of-town I thought it would be great to get some local beer.  I get there and they are having an Oskar Blues feature for $30 per person.  I still sat down and decided to have a couple of beers, no food.  First beer no problem, second one slight problem.  I ordered off the menu a Skeleton Red IPA from Four String Brewing.  I got a Switchblade IPA from Four String Brewing.  Inquiry about it came up short....as the answer was, that is the same beer.  Wrong.  Two different beers from the same brewery, so lets not confuse them.  For the people that do not know beer that is asking for a Bud Light and getting a Miller Lite.  Same style beer but two different beers.  Bartender was a nice guy, so give them props on that.  I also included a photo from Cleveland Scene with the out-of-bar advertisement.  If I am in DTW again, I will be sticking to WBC."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been coming to Wild Goose weekly for pizza night for the past few months and really enjoy it. We don't deviate too much from pepperoni and red peppers on our pizza. Their regular sauce is great as is their spicy sauce! Draft list is always solid and rotating and Cleveland sports are always on. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Cool place. Great service (joe). Pizza was legit, quality ingredients. Great beer selection. May go back this week I liked it so much."}
{"text":"Really good brick oven pizza.  Nice full bar with a good selection of drought beers.  Service is good.  My only complaint is that the music is way too loud.  It is almost impossible to hold a conversation with the person next to you."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch for the first time this past week.  Located in Downtown Willoughby right next to Arabica Coffee House and owned by the same family that owns the popular Irish bar, Croagh Patricks.  The Wild Goose is pretty good sized but not a lot of tables.  There is a good size bar with a nice looking beer selection.

The Wild Goose is known for the stone oven pizzas but there are  many other selections on the menu.  Since this was the first time there, I had to try the pizza.  I went with the \"Loosey Goosey\" which had red sauce, cheese, pepperoni, sausage, onions, green peppers mushrooms, and black olives.  All of the pizzas are large, 8 cut.  The crust was good - had the crispiness that you expect from a stone oven style pizza.  I've seen some reviews indicating it was too crispy - this isn't your chain style pizza.  The crust was perfect, not burnt and not overly crispy.  The toppings were all very good and fresh.  The sauce tasted great and there was a perfect amount - not too much, not too little.  And finally, the cheese was balanced just right.  For $12.00 this was a great choice for lunch..

There are starts including things such as hummus, goat cheese dip, seafood pub dip and Irish potato soup as well as a good selection of salads and sandwiches.  A nearby table ordered a sandwich which looked great and was huge! 

The staff was friendly and attentive - to be expected by the Coyne family and the service was quick.  Definitely will be checking this place out again."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a few brews and was very impressed with the bar service. Very friendly wait staff made me feel comfortable and valued as a customer. Stone-fired pizza is the specialty of the house and I ordered a pizza to go, the Pesto Goose'o - it was fantastic! Would definitely recommend to anyone interested in experiencing a great time while in Downtown Willoughby...cheers!"}
{"text":"Very nice place. Cool ambiance. Great food. Brick oven pizza!! One toppping pizzas are around $5 during the week until I think... 7pm?  Cannot say enough about the pizzas.  My favorite specialty pizza is the Galway Bay... Seafood on cream sauce.  Oh my.  

Tap beer selection is safe.  Typically nothing too interesting. The happy hour food specials get us here about once or twice a week. 

The guys that run this place deliver outstanding service. I mean...they really rock out loud. They greet everyone personally, and always remember repeat customers. OK... I have to be honest-they are all adorable.  Seriously adorable.  The ladies behind the bar and waiting tables have the BEST personalities, and are seriously cute on top of it.  You really want to hate girls like this, but you just can't.  I like them all.

One of my favorite on the way home stops.

Go here.  Try it.  But don't take my bar stool."}
{"text":"Very good food. Loud environment. They recently expanded the building which really helped with space in the restaurant. I recommend the pizza which is thin crust in a wood fired oven. The pizza I love is the Mac and cheese pizza. The rest of the menu is average. The service is also pretty good."}
{"text":"They advertise a Monday mexi night. We went and were only able to have coronas. They were out of triple sec to make margaritas. And the web site states $2 tacos which they had none to offer. The owner gave me some nonsense about changing menus but then went back to drink with his friends behind the bar. Don't advertise specials you don't have. I local all the Willoughby bars and haven't been to the goose in years and I'm sure that story will be the same. But on the flip side the bartender was very nice and very apologetic. These people own 3 bars in this area. Get your act together gentlemen."}
{"text":"Awesome happy hour - $1.50 Miller Lite and $5.00 pizzas, great bartenders/staff and wonderful food...."}
{"text":"Simple little Bar with very little food. Will NOT be back. We were looking for a place to eat seen online so called and asked if the kitchen was still open and until when? answer;\" yes kitchen is open until 10:30-11pm\" so I asked well which is it 10:30 or 11? \"probably closer to 11 we play it by ear\" ok great !!  so we drive all the way there {10pm}sit down and wait for someone to help us, he finally came over and asked if we were having drinks or food or both we said both but definitely here for food. \"oh well just so you know we only have pizza now\"  well I just called a few minutes ago and asked and they didn't mention that when I asked if the kitchen was open still and we just drove all the way here from Cleveland. \" well our kitchen is open just for pizza only\" so yeah I was not happy about that. why would you say your kitchen is open but not that its only for pizza ?  thanks for wasting an hour of our time we ended up going to Tremont. WOULD NOT GO FOR FOOD ONLY BEER.  I mean how hard is it to make a sandwich or salad that's all you have on the menu anyway."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic. The staff was so friendly, informative and made sure everyone at the bar had a drink in front of them. We are from out of town and there was a bar crawl. The bartenders didn't skip a beat. If we ever come back this way, I will be back"}
{"text":"Went in at 5:15 PM on a Friday with my wife, but almost all the tables were marked \"Reserved,\" and the rest were taken, and the entire bar. This isn't the first time. Shouldn't be so hard to get a beer and a seat at this place."}
{"text":"My friend and I come here every Monday now for dinner and drinks.  I was pretty happy finding this place and until now had planned on keeping this our Monday night out place.  

I dropped my previous rating down a star today...not because of the food though.  It was really good!  We shared a Sullivan (pizza) and it was DELISH.  Here is where the star drops...We had a waitress we had never seen before, and she seemed very rushed and in turn rushed us.  We asked if we could try the goat cheese dip (just a bite), since the waitress was not able to explain how it was, but she said \"Just get it.  It is only $4.00. since it is happy hour.\". That bugged us.  The money wasn't a problem for us, but please don't try and force an charge on our bill.  We know full well that tips are a percentage of our bill, and that came off as VERY rude.  And FYI the goat cheese dip is not what one would normally think of...it was a marinara sauce with a very small amount of cheese melted on the top (at least that is what we were served).  It was great though, so no complaints.  They also had a sort of strawberry margarita on special, and my friend had ordered that.  about 7 minutes later she came back to say that they were out.  How can you be out of a happy hour drink special at 6:10pm?  The place was far from crowded.

We will not be going this coming Monday.  Going to try a new place.  We will be back though, and really hope to make that our spot if the service improves."}
{"text":"The pizza here is very goody his crust pizza. The only problem was every time we went in it took a while for someone to take are order.  We go back each time because we love the pizza. We actually have gotten the BBQ chicken the last three times we stopped in. It is more of a bar atmosphere no have not seen any children in here but would love to take our four year old because she loves pizza."}
{"text":"Not your traditional pizza joint, though you can get the traditional American pizza toppings.  The menu boasts an interesting dynamic of pizzas from mashed potatoes to Mac & Cheese. The pizzas are a thin crust cooked in a stone oven that you can see from the bar area. There is a great variety for beer selection as well. I had the Mac & Cheese and I was a little Leary as restaurant Mac & Cheese is typically bland with soggy noodles.  Not here. The macaroni was cooked properly and the cheese was the typical gooey goodness comparable to Name brand Mac & Cheese. Plus it had bacon, can't go wrong with bacon. Definitely will return.

Seating is first come first serve. And wait staff was friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"Great pizza, you won't find a better dough recipe. The have a brick oven, so it cooked quick. The service is very slow when they are busy, even on friday and Saturday nights. They do make sure you get your food and won't kick you out If you are waiting on drinks or food."}
{"text":"For a newer place, they have it figured out.  Kickass service, coupled with great food at a value.  I could stay there all night.  Brick oven pizza.  McPat (owner) is out and about, either bussing tables, waiting, or schmoozing.  Which he does best.  And that, I believe, is also important,  The customers have to know that someone has an interest in you coming back.  

Good on you, Wild Goose."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, food, patrons and staff, our favorite Willoughby location. Not too many places anymore that the owners take the time to say hello and shake your hand."}
{"text":"Obsessed with this place! The breakfast pizza & macaroni pizza are my favorite. Service has always been good while I've been there."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. I was able to try the bbq chicken pizza and seafood pub dip, both of which were delightfully yummy. I was also impressed with their ample cider list--I believe they had five different brands in bottles and Strongbow on tap. I'm not much of a beer drinker, so I was very appreciative of having so many other options available!

Seating is pub style, without a hostess to guide you, so I imagine finding a table could prove difficult during busier times. Service was a little iffy--the waitresses were super friendly, but our food took forever considering the restaurant was only 2/3rds full. I suspect that they forgot about our order, given a panicked conversation I witnessed between servers after we inquired after our food. 

All in all, I would definitely go back. That pizza was damn good; I've got myself a menu to work through."}
{"text":"The pizza was amazing. The sauce was fresh, the crust was crispy and thin, the toppings tasted like they were from a garden. I was so delighted with the supreme style pizza here (although it has a more exciting name). 
The atmosphere was also really nice for a bar - lots of character, very lively. A decorated board with upcoming band performances was really inviting and cool. The restaurant/bar logo is sweet. 
Only negative - service was slow. There were only 3 people working (waitress, cook, and manager?) but it was 3pm and the waitress had to take a business call and the cook was busy."}
{"text":"Owners are great, extremely nice. They nail the pizzas 100%. Drinks aren't do badly priced either. The set up inside is also nice. Let's you move around if it's not out the door busy. The entire staff is very nice, except one bartender; she was extremely rude to us. 

Other than that, I say one of the top 3 down town Willoughby bars!"}
{"text":"Such a yummy surprise. Even though i tend to have a distaste for DTW due to its d-bag environment, I hope this place isn't a short lived establishment. Attending Happy Hour with my BFF made it a good choice. 5 dollar one-topping pizza, yes please. Our bartender, Tony was awesome. He put up with my inability to make up my mind and always picked something yummy."}
{"text":"Went for Friday Happy hour. The server was fantastic. He was friendly and helpful and made some great recommendations. I could eat the seafoos dip all by itself, it was so good. The pizza we had was great too and the Happy Hour specials were very worth it. Music was a bit loud, but the atmosphere was fun and very cool. Will be back."}
{"text":"Good beer selection and great pizza - it's still definitely more of a bar than a restaurant  but the pizzas are damn good.  The goose balls and dirty Sanchez were a hit with us - not one extra slice remained.  Check this place out - and stay for a pie."}
{"text":"Little place with a bar atmosphere plenty of TVs great place to watch a game hang out with your friends they have an old-school shuffle board at the back room very clean very neat I recommend the stuffed mushroom appetizer oh dip and the true chorizo dip.
They have a wood fired pizza oven that is spectacular and their pizzas come out with good flavor well-cooked and they are very affordable prices are affordable food is high quality service was great I would recommend this to anyone"}
{"text":"Been here a few times and never been disappointed with the quality of the food. Had the sweet and sassy pizza today, which was their version of a pulled pork BBQ pizza. I really like the thinner style brick oven crust and they do a good job with it here... It has a nice crisp with a chewy bite, but no burnt parts. The pizza was very flavorful. The service was friendly and attentive. Sat at the bar today. Would highly recommend... Price of the pizza is a tad high, thus the 4 rather than 5 stars."}
{"text":"I was getting a tattoo in Willoughby and ordered a pizza from here for lunch.  The pizza was good, as was the crust (which I don't often say).  If i am back in Willoughby I would go back and try out more of the menu."}
{"text":"I've been told for a while now to check out Willoughby for some good eats.  I was in the neighborhood so a friend and I stopped here for happy hour.

This place is fantastic.  The service is great and the food is just as good.  They have happy hour from 4-7pm on weekdays.  We got there around 5:30 and it was maybe half full, but by the time we left the place was packed! They had an extensive beer menu and lots of yummy looking specials.  There were so many things we wanted to try but we decided to order the seafood dip and a mushroom pizza with garlic sauce.  Both were soo good. The seafood dip came out bubbling and full of flavor.  The crust on the pizza was amazing and the pizza wasn't too oily.  

Definitely plan to come back here another time to try some of their other food.  It was a good atmosphere to just hangout, grab some beers and a bite.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"What a great vibe in this place! High quality food with attentive and friendly servers. Plus any place that mixes in some Janis Joplin and Otis Redding with the contemporary artists is my kind of place. Try the seafood  pub dip ! Fantatastic! Plus any pizza will send you home happy."}
{"text":"Pizza was super delicious!!  Server was helpful with our pizza decision... Pizza was thin and perfectly crispy without even having to ask for it crispy. Big beer selection and decently priced"}
{"text":"We sat at the bar on a Saturday evening and were greeted very quickly, in fact I was surprised that the bartender apologized that he couldn't get to us quicker. He introduced himself and shook our hands and asked us for our names which I was so surprised by. He told us about the special and when my husband said he doesn't like blue cheese, he said it could be customized if needed. We went with the Hawaiian pizza and omg, it was so good! There was not a long wait at all even though the restaurant was quite busy. I would come here again in a heartbeat! Great food and great service"}
{"text":"Been here a few times now I'm ready to write my review.  Walked in and can't tell if we seat ourselves or we are to be sat.  Server girl walked past us twice, made eye contact and never said anything.  We eventually just asked her if we seat ourselves and she said yes.  This is the first impression of people entering and its more welcoming to customers and a friendly \"Hello\" is nice so they don't stand there like schmucks.  Anyway, we sat on the stage under the random Caffrey's sign from 1996.  Took a while for lil miss eye contact to come over to us.  Once she finally realized we were sat in her section she was fine after that.  The beer list is great for the area.  We got Bodhi's.  Beer prices are good too.  For food we got the chicken salad and the Galway Bay pizza.  The salad was fine.  The pizza has crabmeat and shrimp.  Thought Galway was know for oysters?  Oh well.  The pizza was good and I never complain about too much toppings but the creamy mixture of crabmeat and skrimps was too thick.  The edges of the pizza skin were almost burnt but the topping were barely lukewarm.  Made for a weird taste and texture.  Thin that sucker out and it should bake more evenly.  We ended up scraping half of it off.  Don't know If I would get that again.  We have tried a few pizzas from here now and they all pretty good.  A little amateur in execution, but OK.  Also, we would of stayed longer but we didn't realize it was a Cavs game night and the place was filling up fast with peeps in the carbon copy CLE shirts.  Time to gtfo...."}
{"text":"I think The Wild Goose is just what DTW needed - a nice bar with good food at decent prices.  They have plenty of weekly specials - everything from pizza to soup to martinis - and they have great happy hour pricing.  Even on a Saturday.  

I stopped in for lunch on a Saturday afternoon.  The place was pretty full with everything from frat boys to families.  I went against my better judgment and ordered a vegetarian mushroom sandwich instead of pizza.  I felt like I was ordering steak in a Chinese restaurant since The Wild Goose has a pizza oven right smack dab at the end of the bar.  My sandwich was good, but my boyfriend said the pizza he ordered was awesome.  He had a \"create your own\" pizza with white sauce, chicken, and banana peppers.  

I would definitely go back to eat and especially drink at The Wild Goose.  This is a welcome addition to Willoughby and I wish the Coyne family nothing but luck!"}
{"text":"Stopped here on a whim for some pizza and beer. We got the Murphy pizza which has mashed potatoes, cheese, bacon and sour cream on it. It was very good but next time I think I'll try something a bit more traditional. Decent beer list and the bartender was very nice and attentive. We'll definitely be back to see what their other pizzas are like!"}
{"text":"Can't really go wrong with the pizza here! I've been here 3 times and every pizza has been wonderful! Love the crust! Their dips are great! The seafood dip is my favorite! Half price dips during happy hour. Also daily specials for different days."}
{"text":"What a great addition to the DTW scene, congrats Coyne family for providing us socialites with a wonderful bar/restaurant to get happy in.  I love the openness, long bar, comfortable seating, and better yet, the food and drink.  What's great about WG is that the concept was to have everyone (owners / managers) bring something to the restaurant whether it be wine recommendations, recipes, decorative talent, imaginations, and best yet 'a family working environment'.  It really makes you feel like you stepped into a bar that is owned by a bunch of best friends albeit they are mostly family.  Now to the review of the food.

Starter: 
Potato Soup - WOW!  Thickness of a chowder or creamed down mashed potatoes, but the flavor is terrific.  Topped with sour cream, REAL bacon, and cheese, what a fricken delight. $5.

Appetizer (pic uploaded):
Hummus Dip - Very obvious this is homemade.  Not extremely smooth, slightly textured, but well seasoned / put together.  I've never been a big fan, but I'd get this again.  I thought it was a little pricey at $8 but 1/2 off everyday from 3-7, not that's a good deal.

Pizza (pic uploaded):
The Goose!!  OK, so what do think when the toppings are Duck Confit, Pears, and Blue Cheese??  Yeah....that pretty much sold us ($14).  As it IS the most expensive item on the menu, it's probably one of the more flavorful pizza's I've ever eaten.  The cheese has a very strong flavor so WG does go a little light, but it sure packs a punch.  I thought the crust might have been a little thick, which will always take away from the flavor of the pizza but it still needs to be thick enough to hold up against the ingredients (this is supposed to be finger food - right?).  I also talked with one of the owners and they're still trying to tackle the imported oven since it does smoking hot.  

Overall, I think with time, this will be a great place to go get some unique eats, especially the pizza.  They are planning on running pizza of the day specials along with beer and wine of the day deals.  To comment on 1 and done Charles' review, the beer was very cold and the music was perfect (we had a 10 month old with us) and she slept most of dinner.  I honestly think that the only downside to this location is parking.  So get in early and get your grub on.

Note:  My phone wasn't feeling that good when I took the pics.  I'll try better next time."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is something that the DTW area has been lacking. Has a nice appeal and classy interior but very logical location and menu for a sporting even or hanging out with friends. The Coyne family pulls this one off well just as they have their other businesses. Great drink specials and happy hour from 3-7 daily and quite a few taps and bottles for the beer lover. The brick oven makes quite a few nicely topped specialty pizzas but their menu is lacking alittle. No typical pub grub here, if you want a burger, go somewhere else but if you want a specialty pizza, this is your spot. Not a bad seat in the house either for whatever game you may wish to see. This place has only been open a few days so the staff is very prevalent but I think in the next few months they will get it flowing. Can't wait to go back and try some brick oven goodness!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to be.  Some of the best pizza in town!  The owners and bartenders are fantasic.  Fun place to be."}
{"text":"Ordered salads and a pizza.  40 mins to get the salads and I got the wrong one.  The manager apologized for the wait and when I told him I didn't even get the right salad he salad he said \"well, we don't really chop our chop salad. And if you don't want the chicken just push it to the side.\"  I also told the waitress it wasn't what I ordered when she brought it and she shrugged and pretty much said the same thing.  When we finally got pizza it was pretty average.  The atmosphere is so loud you can't hear yourself think.  I'm not sure what the others are raving about.  They must be relatives or friends."}
{"text":"We had a table of four. Two wood fired pizzas and the goat cheese dip. Great service, great decor, great food, good beer selection. Gets crowded and loud at night, but that's Downtown Willoughby. We went for dinner and it was still \"civilized\". Only drawback is parking, but then again, that's Downtown Willoughby. It's worth it though, love the historic buildings and neighborhood. Great spot."}
{"text":"Family owned and operated! Everything on the menu is superb! Best Pizza in Willoughby!! The service is always excellent!!"}
{"text":"The pizza is absolutely incredible! I'm a huge seafood lover, so my usual is The Galway Bay. The craft beer selection is really good too. Weekend evenings are crazy, and parking in downtown Willoughby leaves much to be desired. I suggest visiting for lunch, because it's insane on Friday and Saturday night."}
{"text":"really cool place. The food was excellent and their happy hour was better than I could have expected. Pizzas are phenominal for five bucks. Very nice and friendly staff had a great time hanging out at the bar. Cute bartenders, fun experience will certainly be back for more!"}
{"text":"Came in with my mom for a lunch after working up an appetite walking around downtown Willoughby. When we came in the place was absolutely empty but it seems like we just beat the lunch rush because after we sat down it started to fill up fast! It seems like this spot has a lot of loyal regulars. 

My mom and I ordered a pizza to split. Picking toppings was so difficult because a whole page of their menu is dedicated to different pizza combos all of which sounded fantastic. Ultimately we decided to play it safe and ordered the Margherita. The pizza has super thin crispy crust and it's baked in a wood burning oven. It was really great! We definitely weren't leaving with leftovers."}
{"text":"Okay for starters the three brothers who own this place are totally fucking sexual and hot I love them every single time I move out of Cleveland I have my going away party at one of their bars needless to say I bounce all over the state and move back to Cleveland I've lived in Las Vegas not for several years and I'm in love with the city but I come to this bar in the very second that I land and bring all of my friends throw all of my parties there nothing like any of their bars anywhere in all of the United States of America"}
{"text":"Great place to drink and watch the Game. Audio is on and service is friendly even when busy. I recommend snagging seats on the left side of the room as it's full of TVs and Projection big screens and the audio is boss on that side. Plus...should it get packed in here, it's closer to the restrooms. Pizza is thin crust and well done. Super like the phat fries."}
{"text":"I'm so glad I found this place!  I was starving late Friday night and was looking for a place to go and decided to use Yelp to guide me in the right direction.  I saw this place serves Pizza so I was sold immediately.  The area was really nice and I heard some good music booming from the outside before I made it in.  After being carded at the door I took a seat at the bar and the bartender took my drink order.  I asked to see a menu and that's where I saw all the pizza's I can choose from.  I kept it simple and ordered a pepperoni pizza and a Blue Moon for my drink.  The layout is really chill.. some tables and some booths to sit at.  There were a few people dancing so naturally I had to get up and dance too!  It's hard to sit still when the DJ is playing all of your jams!  

My Pizza came out shortly after and mannn let me tell you!  This is some of the best pizza I've ever had.  I don't know  what they did to it but it was just soooo flavorful and just seasoned perfectly!  I couldn't stop talking about it.  I'm so glad I decided to come to Wild Goose.  This is going to be my spot everything I come back to Ohio now."}
{"text":"This is a nice place to meet up with friends. The best stone oven pizza on the east side!  Friendly staff and fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"best pizza I have ever had. I am from Cleveland but moved to Pittsburgh and every time I am in town, we eat this pizza and usually get one to go. fun bar, too. good atmosphere."}
{"text":"One of the best happy hours in downtown Willoughby. Besides the decent drink prices, they also offer half priced appetizers. The dips are amazing and pair well with beer. The pizzas are phenomenal and well worth the price. The staff is very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"These lads have got what  it takes!   Of course I am a fan, the Coyne boys are such sweet, hospitable guys, that everyone feels right at home in their establishments. 
But, I must review the food ...that's why I'm here.

Pizza......yum!  I recommend the pesto sauce, with sausage and onions.  Or whatever toppings tickle your fancy.  Thinner crust pizza than I normally enjoy, but perfectly cooked, crisp, and DE-LISH!   
My friend and I both ordered salads with the pizza.   Here's a tip:  Order just one salad...they are huge.  A great split with the pizza, and a few pints of Smithwicks.

I'm looking forward to trying some of their specialty pizzas and menu items.  Follow them on Facebook too, they always have live updates of menu items, events, and just fun anecdotes.  The service is great...believe all the good reviews you've read."}
{"text":"We stopped in here to watch the Browns game and grab some grub.  I was very pleasantly surprised by the ambiance and the quality of the pizzas.  We have been out in the DTW a few times and I haven't been super impressed by the locations or some of the clientele but this place drew a very mature crowd.  Our group tried a couple different pizzas and they were all very good.  Definitely enough to take home as leftovers!!"}
