{"text":"Excellence. The service was impeccable, serve and waited by the owner himself, conversing with him about the wonders of Portugal wont be a problem, the cod is fresh highly recommended in any of its presentations. Great selection of wines, nice family ambiance. Its definitely worth the detour..."}
{"text":"Étant d'origine portugaise, je peux confirmer que Douro est le meilleur restaurant portugais de Montréal. Le service est impeccable, la décoration est typique, sans être kitch, et le vin.... très bon. 
Nous avons commencé par les \"tapas mista\", un mélange de différents tapas dont les gambas, fraîches, bien grillées, les sardines grillées (gouteuses), quelques croquettes de morue (bonnes), croquettes de crevettes (délicieuses) avant de passer au plat principal. 
Le steak du bitoque est tendre, le lapin très bien cuit accompagné d'une sauce très bonne et de légumes cuits à la perfection. La paella est aussi excellente, les fruits de mers frais! 
Au niveau dessert, les pasteis de nata ne sont pas maison mais sont tout aussi bons, la mousse au chocolat onctueuse et l'espresso excellent.

Et il faut finir avec un verre du meilleur porto, vieilli de 10 ans, un must."}
{"text":"Excellent resto!
J'ai pris la paella Doura : un délice!! Belle portion, riches en fruits de mer! Superbe!

Déçue par la mousse au chocolat cependant, trop sucrée, pas assez chocolaté!

Bon service, malgré la personne à l'accueil un peu bête...

Un peu dispendieux mais l'expérience en vaut la peine!"}
{"text":"Hands down, this is one of my top Portuguese restaurants of all time. Marcelino and his brother, the co-owners, are incredibly hospitable and service is top notch.  You can order authentic and delicious Portuguese cuisine in a beautiful setting.  They started us off with some complimentary bread, olive oil, fava beans, soft cheese, prosciutto, and olives. We then ordered the delicious grilled sardines and a house salad before moving on to the shared arroz de mariscos (seafood rice), which had fresh seafood cooked to perfection. Hubby and I loved our first experience so much that we came back two days later for the set menus; you can choose from a variety of paellas, steak, and traditional cataplana (Portuguese stew), which comes with a starter and a dessert.  DELISH! Muito obrigado e até a próxima vez, Marcelino!"}
{"text":"I went here for a weekday lunch on a cold January day - by cold, I mean like -20C wind chill.  Despite the bad weather, this place was open, warm and great food.  There were lots of other patrons enjoying themselves.

For lunch, there was a very limited menu: basically three starters and three entrees.  Three of us had the tomato soup, which was my favorite part of the meal.  It was not creamy, almost like a gazpacho, but warm.  A perfect choice for a cold day!   Our entree choices were grilled mahi mahi over mashed potatoes with veggies in them, charbroiled beef, and paella with seafood and chicken.  Two of our group had the paella and two of us (including me) had the mahi.  I am not a big paella fan and judging by the looks of the two entrees, I picked well.  The fish was grilled perfectly and the mashed potatoes were unique with assorted veggies mixed into them.

Service was good and I would definitely come back for dinner."}
{"text":"Leave room for dessert!!. What a great restaurant to bring a date, a friend or simply to enjoy a great meal! Friendly service, excellent food! I had the sea food platter: lobster tail, blue mussels, clams, giant shrimp, scallop all grilled to perfection with a house blend spice it was combined beautifully together on a bed of rice! Absolutely delicious! But no matter what you order you have to leave room for dessert the ''natas do ciel'' is to die for! ill be back for sure! Happy eating!"}
{"text":"Dropped by Douro for dinner since we were craving something like paella  from all the pictures we saw. When we walked in, they were pretty full and we were thankfully seat quickly even without a reservation. The service is fantastic here. Our server was friendly and gave fantastic wine recommendations based off what we preferred. He hit the nail on the head with the recos!

We ordered their Marisco for two and really enjoyed it. They do not skimp on the seafood! It was delicious and highly recommend to those in Montreal looking for a tasty seafood meal."}
{"text":"We went with a group of 12 people for dinner and everyone ordered something different. The Restaurant has very nice art work and a contemporary modern decor throughout. 

We ordered two plates of calamari and although it was very simple, it tasted good. They also served us three bread baskets served with side appetizers of olives, proscuintto, olive oil, slices of white goat cheese, and Portuguese beans. 

All of the dinner meals were large portions, with plenty of food served on the plate. 

I ordered the reasonably priced acorda de marisco (a seafood dish served with wet bread), and was pleasantly surprised with the abundant amount of seafood that was in my dish. It had garlicly clams, mussels, shrimp, and two very large prawns. There was more seafood than bread, which is the main reason I was surprised. Acorda is an aquired Portuguese taste. So if you don't like eating wet bread, then you may not enjoy this meal, but to be honest this was the very best acorda de marisco that I have ever eaten. 

For dessert I had the pear marinated in Porto wine, and it was absolutely delicious. I highly recommend this for dessert. 

Douro is probably the best kept Portuguese restaurant secret on St Laurent. We were very lucky to have the restaurant owner Mr Alves serve us personally, because he truly made our dinner a fantastic culinary experience."}
{"text":"À midi.pres de la petite Italie,recommandé par des amis portugais.cadre aéré,service professionnel,nappes immaculées,nourriture d'inspiration portugaise,choix de vins idem.pour finir prix( menu à midi) très correct.on y va de temps en temps."}
{"text":"Upon walking into Restaurant Douro, I found it to be very reminiscent of Café Ferreira on Peel Street when it first opened many years ago. With its blue & white tile mosaic wall, it felt like more like a sister restaurant but at affordable prices.  In the evening the restaurant is well lit and bright; it has a clean crisp fell to it with its white walls, trimmed with yellow and splashes of blue.  A fine dining establishment with white linen covered tables and wooden chairs; it takes us to the lands of oceans and sun. The menu boasts a good mix of fish, seafood and grilled meats and all the Portuguese favorites starting from Tapas to Grilled sardines, Bacalhau Potato Croquettes , Lobster and Shrimp, Caldo Verde soup , Pork and Clams,  Grilled  steaks ,chicken and heavenly desserts to boot, and of course the proverbial Portuguese favorites natas. We received copious amounts of food and everything tasted on par and authentic."}
{"text":"I spent many hours here for a long, leisurely, beautiful tasty lunch, coffee and exquisite dessert. When my companion and I arrived in the late morning, the restaurant was still empty, but getting ready for the imminent World Cup crowd, which eventually definitely added to the family friendly and relaxed atmosphere.

I ordered the pea soup and the lobster salad, which was enourmously big, however, I ate every morsel of it. For dessert, the manager recommended a small custard-y dish on a bed of a crumbled biscuit, I am not sure what it was called, but it was delicious. 

Congratulations to the owners and the manager, it was worth driving to Montreal just for lunch from upstate NY!"}
{"text":"Great service. Great food. Decent price for amazing quality. Will be coming back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Great Portuguese resto. I had the rabbit in wine sauce and it was excellent. All the tapas was great and really enjoyed their olive oil with the bread......really good."}
{"text":"There are restaurants that, for some reason, become family favorites. Be it for a specific food item, the wine list, the decor or even the service, these are places that you will go back to time and time again because you enjoy it and are in the mood to go back. They become staple of the rotation when the family seeks a nice place to enjoy a nice weekend meal. For my family, Douro is one such place. Given we recently went back for a nice Saturday evening meal, I figure now would be a good opportunity to talk about it.

For the uninitiated, Douro is a Portuguese restaurant located of the fringes of Little Italy here in Montreal. They serve tapas style dishes or you can stick to the classic appetizer/ main course format if you'd like. Each time I've gone, I have stuck to the tapas menu. Amongst the tapas options on this evening, we went for chorizo sausage, grilled squid, grilled calamari, garlic shrimp and cod cakes. Every item is cooked very nicely without overdoing the ingredients - simply allowing the natural favors of each items shine through with some slight enhancements. The grilled squid is of particular note here.

The next serving brought forth some delicious mussels as well as 2nd helpings of squid and cod cakes. The mussels were rather small but they were still delicious as was the garlic and white wine broth.

To top off the evening, a deliciously fresh pastry. Nice flaky crust and a buttery smooth filling. 

Add to this delicious food a nice bottle of Portuguese white wine and you have yourself a very nice meal to enjoy. The service is outstanding and personable. I have some minor quips about the decor of the restaurant (although I seem to be the only one who feels that way) but they do not distract for the great food you will enjoy. If you are looking for a nice enjoyable Portuguese meal, I highly recommend giving Douro a shot. Maybe your family will enjoy it as much as mine.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"I went here as a group of 8 and it was definitely a night to remember! The food is delicious,  the quantity of food is abundant and the service is without reproach.  

I ordered the cataplana to share and was shocked by the amount of seafood on the dish! This will definitely become a family favourite as we are all seafood lovers! 

As we are not familiar with Portuguese wine,  the waiter asked what our preferences were (flavour profiles and price range) and brought out 2 excellent wines that paired well with our meal."}
{"text":"This is probably the best seafood restaurant in Montréal by far. The seafood stew was excellent, generous, with lobster, mussels, clamshell - the serving is for 2 but it is for 3 at least! . The soup stew is slightly spicy and very tasty. Service is quick fast and the place is packed. So a good recommended place for seafood in Little Italy."}
