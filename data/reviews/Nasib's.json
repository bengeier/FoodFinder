{"text":"Definitely amongst the best shawarma's in town. Nasib and his wife are extremely pleasant and welcoming as well. It definitely gets top marks for taste, service and especially price.   Also, as someone else pointed out - 2 shawarmas at $6.99 is an incredible deal but they are huge so come hungry or with a friend."}
{"text":"This is my go-to shawarma place in GTA, just overall fantastic taste, value and service (the owners are super friendly). Unless you haven't eaten all day, one of their sharwama is usually enough for one person. I like my chicken shawarma extra spicy and toasted just a little bit longer than usual, and Nasib's can do that just right. The shawarma comes out nice and crispy, and the homemade turnips and pickles make it even better.  I will always recommend this place to anyone near the the Scarborough area, give this wonderful family restaurant a try!"}
{"text":"Probably on my list of the worst Shawarma's I have had, the toppings were anything but fresh even though I visited in the middle of the day. The chicken shawarma sandwich had an overall burnt...really weird taste that I have never tasted before and probably never will again. I have never been back since and just writing about it now is reminding me of the dimly lit restaurant. It could have been the odd smell that was hanging in the air, a mixture of cleaning products and charcoal that affected my taste buds. I can only say that the bread was a good softness that didn't rip or crack when bit into which is always a plus with a Shawarma, but I would never set foot here again."}
{"text":"Prices have gone up... 2 for $9 If im correct... and portions have become much smaller... sorry but will not be returning."}
{"text":"Nice place,  foods delicious and owner is very friendly. Not the best place for a family because seating arrangment is not comfortable.  And washrooms not clean at all. Can be more modernized and clean."}
{"text":"This place has amazing shwarma, decent price and great owner. I love eveything about the chicken shwarma plate at this place. Soft and crispy chicken, savory salad dressing, hummus with full chick peas and the cloves flavored rice. Food is just amazing at this place. Definitely one of the best shawarma places around scarborough."}
{"text":"Nasib's shawarmas.. They're like none other I've eaten. Going to school in a neighbourhood where there are strip malls practically devoted to housing shawarma restaurants, Nasib's out shines them all.   The shawarmas, which come in either chicken or beef (or both for just $7!) can be topped with a large variety of veggies and condiments for no extra charge.   I can't speak for the other items on the menu because the numerous times I've been here I've gotten a shawarma, they're just that good."}
{"text":"delicious chicken shawarma, owner was very friendly and service was great! definitely recommend."}
{"text":"There is some Shawarma competition along Lawrence Avenue in Scarborough. Establishments such as Empire Shawarma, Nasibs, and Al Tanoor compete for the best.  Nasib's is located just a few doors down from Empire Shawarma. Advertising 2 beef or chicken shawarmas for $10, I went for it. I asked for extra sauce and spicy as I always do, but Nasib's went overboard. The first shawarma literally exploded as I ate it, make it a very messy situation versus an Empire Shawarma Lituation.   The meat was meh, the vegetables were fresh, but overall, not a memorable shawarma experience. The gentleman making the food was kind, but he was handling cash as well. This one man operation lead to slow service, and this was not ideal for the lunch rush.   I will not return to Nasib's in the future, and will instead try Al Tanoor or stick to Empire Shawarma."}
{"text":"I wish that I could rate this 4.5 stars because it deserves better than a 4 but there are some issues sometimes. The shawarma here is great and the prices are reasonable. I have two issues that pop up here once in a while. First is that the shawarmas can be inconsistent from one day to the next even when Nasib is making them. He is such a great and friendly guy that he loses track of what he's doing while making your food and talking or telling you a story. Another issue that I have had here is with the beef. There have been two occasions where I have had the beef shawarma and it was so mushy that it disintegrated without chewing. I don't know the reason for this(overcooked?) but it really is gross and I have thrown the food out each time. I no longer order the beef. The \"salsa\" is great but you have to ask for it."}
{"text":"Best shawarma in the city. I've had lots of shawarmas in the past and nobody tops them.  Owners are great and extremely friendly. Good people with passion for their food.  Absolutely the best."}
{"text":"Went there on a recommendation from my barber. Friendly staff and owner. The chicken platters  was huge, salads were freshly made, beef shawarmas was the best ever tasted. I was a little short on cash, offer to use debit, but the owner told me to pay him the rest next time. I tried others but this is my go to place for sharwarmas."}
{"text":"A lot of people seem to frequent Empire down in the same strip plaza, however I am partial to Nasibs. I have had a grab and go lunch there a couple times in the last few weeks and always get when I expect. The Beef shawarma is quite good, not as heavily spiced and thus salty as other places. This leaved room to actually taste things and enjoy the toppings. The price is on point, and the service is great. There actually is a Nasib, like seriously he is right there.  I recommend, and will go back."}
{"text":"The Meats are very juicy and full of flavour, never had dry meat here. Tasty hummus and tahini sauce. I can't keep my hand away from their pita chips. The owner and his wife are very nice and are proud of what they are doing, which shows in their food. Great food, good price, great value."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday and the owner was very friendly! The Shawarma plate is one of the best I've had in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Great Shawarma. 1000x better than Empire (same plaza). Very generous servings and friendly owners.  The food here is made with love (seriously, watch Nasib toss a salad.) Their rice is different then most, gently seasoned with cinnamon, I think. It's very pleasant.   My only wish is for a \"lunch size\" or small size entree plate. It's too much food! (Good value, but I'd rather pay maybe $6.99 and get a small version.) Anyway, as Nasib says, this isn't McDonalds. You get what you pay for!"}
{"text":"Favourite shawarma place! Very generous portions and workers are nice. All the sauces are amazing. Get the chicken shawarma plate, or mixed with chicken and beef. And ask for all the sauces! I prefer it over empire. Still dreaming of if"}
{"text":"Very good spot.   I had the mixed shwarma plate and it was delicious. Big crispy juicy pieces of chicken and very tasty beef. The rice is good. Salad is amazing. Better than most shwarma spots. Homemade hot sauce and garlic sauce really good.   The hummus is OK. Like others said it is a bit sour, probably too much lemon juice. Not the best but still edible.   Overall will be back. Friendly service too."}
{"text":"Nasibs is just down the street from my usual go to shawarma joint Ibrahim's BBQ but I wanted to be a bit spontaneous I guess and decided to try somewhere new.   Considering the amount of shawarma shops on Lawrence you have to be good in order to stay in business and I can attest that Nasibs Shawarma is definitely up there.  I ordered a simple chicken shawarma combo and it was amazing, nicely put together and the pita was toasted perfectly. Even the way the ingredients were laid out was perfect. My biggest pet peeve is when you're shawarma falls apart but at Nasibs they definitely know how to make a good wrap. It's going to be a hard choice between this place and Ibrahim's."}
{"text":"Nasibs is one of my favourite food spots to go to. Fairly cheap for given portions. 2 shawarma for $8. Personally I would recommend mixed because it gives a good mix between the think and crunchiness of the beef and the fresh juicy chicken. You can never go wrong with nasibs"}
{"text":"Nasibs, when it was at kennedy and lawrence, was great but unfortunately times have changed and the father and son are not much alike! These days Nasibs sucks from the poor attitude, to the dirty surroundings, to the unpleasant rushed feeling, to the terribly cheap shawarmas...this ignoramus handles money and than makes sandwiches!...never uses gloves and is constantly picking at his crotch?? I DO NOT RECOMMEND!"}
{"text":"Not sure what changes have gone on here.  The succulent meat slowly turning on the spit used to be mesmerizing.  I fondly remember those days.  Now the food is so dry.  So dry.  Although we still love the salad and very imaginative and brilliant use of seasonings, the last few meals have had meat with really powdery dry texture.  Two stars for the very nice staff and good salad, but we need to find a new favourite shawarma restaurant.... it's all about the meat!"}
{"text":"I don't know why people love this place so much. As someone of middle eastern descent, my family has been going to Nasib's (and other such places in the area) for 20+ years. Nasib's is slightly better than some of the others, but even then, it isn't anything special. The value is decent, the taste is fine, but this area is littered with many other places that are basically the same.  I'm going to rant for a bit about one particular thing. If you don't care about it, scroll down.  ***START OF RANT:  For one thing, I'm a bit picky about what toppings I want. There's nothing wrong with that. Then this a-hole, whether he's actually \"Nasib\" or not, almost always puts something in my wrap, and THEN asks if I want that.  Are you ****ing kidding me? Don't cover my wrap with onions and then ask if I want onions. That's just stupid. I swear, even if I deliberately say \"no onions\" ahead of time, like 75% of the time he'll put onions and then be like \"oh yeah\" and try to pick them off. Same with pickled turnips. I don't like them, and he never seems to learn.  I understand that most Egyptians / Lebanese etc aren't picky when it comes to that -- my family and some of my friends are from that culture and they will just get everything. So maybe they're just accustomed to that kind of a customer. But that's not me. Maybe they assume because I'm middle eastern that I'll be the same, but that's a wrong assumption.  And it's even worse when it's something that can't really be removed, like when I say NO to hot sauce, and he has put hot sauce all over everything. I'm not the type of person who would ask to have it remade (maybe I should be) so I've just let it slide. But then I'm left with a wrap that's spicy when I don't want it to be, and I find the hot sauce just makes it so I can't taste the rest of the food.  Oh, and don't even think about placing your order without watching him carefully. I've done that twice. Went nearby to deposit a cheque, came back, and he's like \"two beef with no onions no turnip\" and I say \"no hot sauce right?\" and he repeats \"no hot sauce\" ...hands them to me, I go home, and oh what's that? At least one is not made to that specification. It's like he spaces out when he makes them.  If this were an isolated incident, I'd let it slide. I'm not spiteful. But between going here with my family, a few times with my roommate, and twice on my own? This has happened more often than not, even if I clearly state exactly what I want ahead of time. I've said it in English. I've said it in Arabic (which he speaks fluently). Doesn't seem to help.  ***END OF RANT***  Even if they didn't have this issue, I find Nasib's wraps to be... fine. I find they taste good and are well made, but it's not like I'm ready to give it 5 stars for taste. It's a good shawarma wrap... but Lawrence/Pharmacy has a lot of similar places, and I don't find they do much to set themselves apart. Most of the time the meat is juicy. A few times it has been a bit dried out. That's about the same as I've had at other shawarma places in the area.  Other reviewers are like \"2 shawarma for $6.99? great deal!\" ...really? This area has like 6 or 7 other places with the exact same special, and a few even cheaper. It's called being price competitive. It's not some mind blowing promotion.  As for their dinners, it's about the same as other places in the area: filling portion, but the price reflects that. Some like to praise a place for having large portions, but I don't see the point if the price is indicative of that portion. It's not like I'm getting some insane value. It's nearly $11 with tax (and that's without a drink). If I pay a price premium, I expect a decent amount of food, and that's what it is here, so I wouldn't gush and say \"wow, that was the bee's knees\" ...more like \"that was $10.50 worth of food.\" (although according to their website, it's $1 cheaper Mon-Fri between 5:30 and 8:30 which is a slight bonus)  I'm unlikely to keep this place in my rotation simply because of my above rant. If you went to (let's say) Subway or Mr Sub and they repeatedly put toppings on your sandwich before you specified, you wouldn't stand for that. So why should I?"}
{"text":"WARNING: THIS REVIEW IS ONLY FOR THEIR HUMMUS. The rest of my previous review still applies.  Came tonight. Just bought a container of their hummus for takeout. On the menu, it says that it's $4.99. They do have different sized tubs at other costs. I got one that was $3.99.   I got it to serve to my church's high school fellowship tonight as part of snack time. I did not try it before serving it to them. Their comments were: \"This hummus tastes weird\". \"This hummus is sour\". Upon trying it, it was actually sour. Not sour in a rancid way (although if all of us get food poisoning, then possibly sour in that way as well), but sour in a lemon juice overdose kind of way. Not a good thing. The hummus was also quite thick, and quite chunky (as in you could see bits and pieces of the chickpeas everywhere). I only get hummus at Middle-Eastern restaurants because supermarket hummus doesn't cut it for me, but this was as close to supermarket hummus as I've ever had at a Middle-Eastern restaurant and that makes me sad. =(  *Update*  Sour in a lemon juice way. None of us got food poisoning. =)"}
{"text":"This review has been updated. The place was good for the first few times, but it's definitely lacking for a while now. Meat is usually dry, but the toppings (and their home made sauce) make up for it. Service is great, but I can't give more stars to a shawarma place that is lacking in their main offering."}
{"text":"The best thing about Nasib's is the quality of food..its amazing! This is my go-to place for a brilliant tasting shawarma. Thank you Nasib's for always providing the best quality food at a great great price!"}
{"text":"What to do when your favorite shawarma place won't be open for another 30 minutes but the hangry monster is already loose? Try a new place.  Nasib's is in the same plaza as Shawarma Empire but opens one hour earlier. Bigger than SE with a washroom. Ordered a beef shawarma dinner which comes with a pita to share with hubby; I subbed out the rice for more salad. The veggies didn't look or taste as fresh as SE and the pita was thin and very chewy; however, the meat was tender. Man! The flavors were potent and the meat was salty. Next time I'm going to have to be more patient."}
{"text":"You haven't lived unless you have had the pleasure of trying authentic shawarma. In Toronto, one of the best places to try authentic shawarma is the strip mall on Lawrence Ave. E. where Nasib's is located. Meat is cooked perfectly and very delicious. Nice selection of vegetables. And the prices are reasonable. I love working near this place because it means I am spoiled by having the option of having delicious shawarma on any day that I like."}
{"text":"Nasib's is the best shawarma place in town, hands down! The food is great and the service is good. He remembers all his customers and makes them laugh. Awesome place to eat!!!"}
{"text":"Take out or eat in Shawarma, Falafel and Kebab.  Home made Mediterranean food.  The place could use a woman's touch for sure but the food is great!"}
{"text":"Probably the best shawarma in town and we've tried our share of shawarmas!  The meat has so many rich, complex flavours and the right blend of spices.  The toppings are always so fresh and the hot sauce, pickles and hummus really complement the sharwarma.  You get a lot of your money too; I think two shawarmas cost $6.99 but you'll have to eat one and save the other for later as they are quite filling.  Nasib is super friendly and always makes us feel welcome.  It's so worth the drive to from the west end."}
{"text":"Located right in the heart of Shawarma valley, Nasib's is located a few stores away from Shawarma Empire (which I have yet to try).  I find it amazing that all the Shawarma joints can stay in business with there being such numerous and steep competition.   Nasib's serves up the typical menu and we ordered Chicken Shawarma and a Falafel sandiwich.  2 for 1 deals applies here so our bill for both the sandwiches and a water came to less than $10.    I always enjoy seeing my Falafel balls being made fresh to order and Nasib's did not disappoint.  We requested all the condiments except the pickled hot pepper and voila! our beautiful sandwiches were ready hot off the grill.    I must admit, it was quite a shock at first when I bit into my falafel sandwich.  I found the falafel actually salty.  Then in another bite, I got the falafel and the pickle and oh my...talk about a serious assault on my salivary glands.  The pickle alone was so much saltier than your usual variety and paired with the falafel, I felt like I could feel my blood pressure skyrocket as I continue to finish my sandwich.   With saltiness aside, the falafel sandwich was a yummy explosion of flavours and texture.    My husband's chicken Shawarma suffered the same fate with the salty pickle but without the added assault from the falafel, the sandwich fared much better.    Overall, Nasib's serves up good value, decent product in a expectedly ho hum atmosphere.  Will I come back to Nasibs?  Maybe but I think I'll give Shawarma empire a try first if I'm back in the area."}
{"text":"Shawarmas here are brilliant! YTou can get 2 for 7 dollars and that's cheap compared to the earlier ones I have had. The sizes are pretty good too. The place might be a little tiny. But, shawarmas are great for take-away too. Also, I feel its way better than the shawarma empire's."}
{"text":"2 shawarma's for $6.99 - what a deal got one with chicken and one with beef the chicken version was excellent with juicy pieces of chicken fresh from the meat rack, however the beef version tasted it bit weird. The texture of the meat was a bit sandy and I'm not sure if this is how its suppose to be but maybe it was because he used the last pieces of beef from the meat rack. If the sandy beef texture is of the norm then I will never get the beef shawarma again."}
{"text":"You may not know it, but you're looking at one hell of a great Shwarma joint.   The chicken shwarma wraps are a good size and loaded with tasty chicken. The variety of toppings adds to the dish. Everything is moist, flavourful and not too expensive. The service is honest and done with a big smile.   Just leave room for some dessert, the Middle Eastern style Baklava is simply AMAZING. Tasty delicious nutty sweet goodness in a square that you should not pass up. Get more than one;  hell, skip lunch and just eat more Baklava."}
{"text":"By far the best chicken shwarma and beef shwarma in Toronto.  Trust me, I have searched high and low for good Lebanese sandwiches.   There is a NEW patio out back but the inside is so so.  Take my word, it is worth the drive.  Your taste buds will rejoice in the quality and consistency of this restaurant."}
{"text":"Was very hungry today at like 5pm. Looked around where i was and saw this mom and pop  restaurant. Walked in and ordered a shawarma sandwich. This is the best shawarma sandwich i have ever had! And i have had many of them! Nice and clean friendly guy on top of everything."}
{"text":"I've been eating here for years! Easily the best chicken Shish Taouk I've ever had. It takes a bit longer to cook because they use fresh chicken breast meat but its well worth the wait. Some other perks Nasib's offers is that if you call ahead for the shish taouk, he can start cooking it while you're on your way and you won't have to wait as long when you're there."}
{"text":"By far and away the best shwarma I've had in Toronto.  Nothing even close.  The flavors, the chicken, the sauce, the ingredients... WOW.  Then there's the SIZE.  Good grief!  These things are huge!  I'm a big man and a big eater, and I was hard-pressed to eat 2 shwarmas for lunch.  To be honest, it was a bit much, and I probably could have, should have, just eaten one and saved the other for later.  And I'm saying that as someone who never thinks restaurant portions are big or filling.    Nasib's is far from my home, but I will eat here EVERY time I'm in the neighborhood, and I'll be sure to take out-of-towners here.  I rarely feel that Toronto food is worth showing off, but Nasib's would be an exception.    I only have one complaint: Nasib's is buried on Lawrence, instead of on the Danforth or downtown.  1 star for that!  You force us to eat other shwarmas.  Aaargh!"}
{"text":"THE BEST AUTHENTIC SHAWARMA IN THE GTA! Seriously, if you're ever on the lawrence strip in scarborough, walk in and enjoy the juiciest shawarma. Nasib is always in the best mood possible, i've been going there for about 5-6 years and never ONCE have I had a bad experience! The hummus and garlic sauce is like no other, and the deals they have there are absolutely worth it. I travel almost 2 hours JUST for his shawarma's (that's what she said) but seriously, he's the sweetest and works with his just-as-sweet wife, they make that place the amazingness that it is. 10000000000 stars."}
{"text":"Amazing chicken shawarma. They have a different style of serving it. The owner of the restaurant is very kind."}
{"text":"Nasib has the tastiest beef shawarma! I frequent his store whenever I'm in the area and the quality is consistent and the toppings are always fresh."}
{"text":"Growing up to shawarma was my childhood version of your grilled cheese sandwich. Karama and Satwa of Dubai, UAE had the best authentic havens of this garlic delight toasted to accentuate the tenderness of the meat and catch the tang of the pickles by the fang! 2 for 1 for $7 over here! Yala yala!   Nasib is prime in showcasing effortless proper execution to this masterpiece. His wife is as equally hard working and efficient with the orders. It's lovely to watch both of them contribute team work amidst (sometimes) obvious lover's quarrel as they attack each other verbally in their native tongue, although thankfully allowing no harm upon the grub.   Found this place 6 years ago and have been a fan ever since. The ambiance is kept simple  and the decoration holds tribute to Nasib himself ,picture painted on the glass entrance standing proud beside his ultimate money maker, the CHiCKEN MEAT stacked perfectly! His homemade spicy sauce is also really tasty, not too spicy but may be for some.   His garlic sauce for me, is the seller! Some people like it mild but since I've passed the dating stages ages ago, extra some some on the side for the heartburn bending breath blister it is!"}
{"text":"Good shwarma here.  Its large.  It comes with a lot of toppings, but not pickles.  its 6.99 for 2 or 3.99 for one.  The chicken is tasty and they use homemade garlic sauce that adds a unique taste."}
{"text":"If your looking for a good shawarma this place is a go to in Scarborough. Beef is juicy and tasteful unlike other Shawarma joints that is extremely dry. The hot sauce they put on the shawarma is just the cherry on top to make this a great sandwich. My wife gets the chicken and she loves it. Why I gave this a 5 star because not only is the food great but the staff is wonderful. Family owned and no matter who you are the wife and husband treat you great. It puts a smile to see people of different backgrounds come in and smile and have a conversation with them. Anytime im craving a Shawarma I definitely hit this spot. Keep it up!!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite shawarma place. The owner is one of the kindest people, really funny and charismatic guy. I've been coming here with my family for the last 10 years and I can honestly say it's the best shawarma I've had in Ontario so far. No one is paying me to write this, I really do love it!! Get the fatoush!!"}
{"text":"I have been here about three times, and have not had a single thing I didn't like.  Had the chicken shawarma wrap, falafel, baba ganoush and the pita chips, all very fresh, and extremely reasonable.  Two can get pretty stuffed for under $25.00.  The wraps are loaded with toppings, made to order.  Really busted old strip mall, but isn't that where the best places are?"}
{"text":"This place has been a staple of mine for years, love coming here, friendly, fast and good! One thing I noticed over time is the portion size has gotten a bit smaller but not  tiny by any means. Still one of the best out there IMHO."}
