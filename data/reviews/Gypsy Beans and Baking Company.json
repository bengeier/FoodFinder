{"text":"Cute little coffee shop! Better than starbucks! They have great muffins and specialty drink! The ice Berlin is one I would recommend as well as a Dark mocha.  They don't take Credit cards unless your totally is over $10 so if you just want a coffee make sure you have cash!"}
{"text":"How hard is it to take an espresso order?  2 single shots of espresso please...   Can I have them in one cup please...  That's two single separate shots.  Two times the amount of ground coffee. NOT DOUBLE SHOT(double the water)!!!"}
{"text":"Hey  I enjoy a hot cup of Joe not lukewarm and clean tables free from leftover crumbs. And I don't see why people can't ties there dogs up to the dog rack who wants to smell and look at dog butts while you are eating"}
{"text":"This place is nice.  I'm not wow-ed, blown away, or overly thrilled about the Gypsy Bean, and the coffee, like me, was a bit bitter. Also, I was a bit surprised to find a plethora of grounds at the bottom of my coffee. Usually when I'm swallowing something that's a surprise it ain't coffee beans.  The yellow blanketed atmosphere leant a certain sense of authenticity to the joint even if it felt as if a thickly mustachioed man of advanced age was going to come in any moment with a Betacam and record a bang session with a Peacock eye-shadowed lady of the night. Or early evening.  I do highly recommend going for the people watching and the desserts which are both fairly fantastic. Huzzah!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Dogs welcomed. Large drink and food menu. Food is a little pricey."}
{"text":"Oh gypsy bean, sweet gypsy bean I sing your praises to the world of the internet.  Where shall I start--with the lovely location on a corner where all of the most interesting people walk past.  T  he store has big windows with seating. I love to come and watch the neighborhood pass.  I am a very black-coffee-only girl and their coffee is great.  Their latte drinks all sound wonderful, and the few that I have tried have been delicious and original.    To first timers I usually recommend the mate' chai latte.  I don't usually like chai, but theirs is woooonderful.  It's not from a powder, and is not overly sweet--but it's quite flavorful and complex.    I like that people come in with their dogs.  I've met some nice dogs and cool people.    Their food is great.  They have a lot of vegan and vegetarian options.  The baristas are always great and friendly.  Service is quick.  Free, public parking is close by."}
{"text":"Gypsy is a very welcoming and laid-back establishment. The coffee is good and decently priced. If hungry, they have many different options to choose from (pizza, to pastries, and more). The staff are always nice and timely. I suggest trying The World. Lastly, they recently took down the walls in the back and the open space is great."}
{"text":"Where do I begin. Never in my life have I visited a coffee shop and treated like Gum stuck to the bottom of a shoe. Female employee tries to say I'm lying about the size of my mug which is a 16oz and she claimed it was a twenty. Takes a 20oz and pours coffee into my mug to prove she was right but turned out she was wrong. Basically called me a LIAR! 2nd incident: The Bald head male employee saw me squash an incident and because it was his friend tells me to leave the place. I asked why not tell his friend to leave since he (Bald Head) WATCHED THE GUY try to escalate a situation. He avoided answering the question then states I had given the female employees a hard time. Then the Employee starts to runs his resume to me..lol he was in the army, yada yada and so forth (what a joke). I sent a email several weeks ago via the GBABC website asking the Owner to give me a call. So far nothing! I'm assuming the employee deleted the email since I asked him who and where the Boss was.   Year later and still no contact from the Owner."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times with friends for coffee/tea/baked goods, and I always enjoyed myself.  Gypsy has a nice vibe and decent drinks and treats.  But I do need to warn you not to try the bistro fare.  I only had lunch there once, but once was more than enough.  I suggested a friend to meet me at Gypsy because their website made it seem like they had a decent amount of fresh lunch options.  I was disappointed that there wasn't too much to choose from and the prices were a little high.  I had a veggie stew that was served to me lukewarm, had a weak flavor, and made my stomach sick later.  I really think the soups were being kept at too low of a temp, like, below health code low.  My friend had a turkey sandwich, which I didn't try, but it looked a little pathetic.  All in all, Gypsy is a totally cool place to grab a coffee and scone, they've got that under control, but don't bother getting a whole meal there."}
{"text":"Feeling a bit like a glutton for gentrification, I strolled into Detroit Shoreway, Cleveland's newest emerging neighborhood. I say it's \"emerging\" because I spotted a rainbow flag, a public theater, and an independent coffee shop. Bringing my disposable income, I saddled up to this aforementioned coffee joint, the Gypsy Bean.  The Gypsy Bean is part coffee bar, part bakery, part United Nations, as its internationally themed drinks and decor provide an opportunity to taste a geography bee's worth of worldly treats. This particular coffee shop bakery, so often simply a microwave or toaster at other establishments, is a true bakery easily spied behind the menus. Giant peanut butter cookies, oozing chunks of Jiffy, sat next to baklava and puffy muffins with almond toppings. I went for a \"Skinny Londoner,\" a foamy latte with butter toffee syrup and rum. At $3.50, I could have even been paying in pounds and it wouldn't have been expensive. It certainly didn't taste skinny, though that could have been the cookie I wolfed down with my British treat.  Here, the signs of sprucing up abound, as a new movie theater will open soon across the street and one of Cleveland's best new restaurants, Luxe, is just down the block. Coming from Oberlin, we still pass abandoned factories one after the other, so it's clear that one new java joint slinging mochas can't make up for the post-industrial decline of an entire economy. It has managed to revive a city block, though I don't think demand will grow great enough for it to take over the nearby factory. For now, I'll just enjoy my cup in its shadows."}
{"text":"Excellent coffee. If you dine in, the food is served on chinaware/glass. Prices are incredible and so are their portions! Thank goodness we have something close to Edgewater. Since the pastries are all made in house, you know you're not getting something made by \"Big Food\" (read: Sysco)"}
{"text":"The staff were nice and the coffee was good! Oh and don't forget their unique specialty drinks and delicious muffins of which there is a great variety!"}
{"text":"My rating has dropped bc of the indifference staff have towards customers, and sometimes even attitude. The food is fresh and delicious. My review in 2015 notes the variance of customer service. I'd say it's evened out and become consistent - nothing to write home about, nothing to make you want to go back. Good thing the food is so tasty and the location is on point."}
{"text":"My SO and I checked out this coffee spot while checking out Gordon Square and I really am impressed by Gypsy! I had plain black coffee and it was delicious. The environment was hip without being too forced. There were a lot of tables and available seating. Also, being vegan, I was so happy that they offer many vegan pastry options! I will definitely make it a point to go to Gypsy again."}
{"text":"Wow.  I had somehow never been to Gypsy Beans and Baking Company until this past Saturday.  I have been missing out.  The interior space is gorgeous, light, airy but still maintains that dark wooden coffeehouse appeal.  I had what I can firmly attest to as the best latte I've ever been served in my life.  (Full disclosure: I am a former Starbucks barista, yes, it is true) I had the cinnamon and hazelnut latte (I believe it was the Mexico City) and even with non-fat milk, it was to die for.  If it hadn't been a piping hot beverage, I would've doused myself in it just to bask in it's flavor.  The prices were very reasonable too, and they take credit cards so long as theres a $5 minimum. I am definitely  going back this weekend to check out some sandwiches!!"}
{"text":"I have tried gypsy beans a couple of times. The first time, I got one of their passport lattes, the praline with almond milk. Delicious, but lots of sugar, as expected. The next time, I got a simple almond milk latte. Woah, not good. The almond milk they used was terrible, and it over powered any espresso taste. I guess all the sugar in the first latte covered the awful almond milk, or this one wasn't steamed well enough. Either way, I am still searching for the best coffee in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I tried the Londoner and the Mexico City. Not the best coffee I've ever tasted. Took the advise from another review on Yelp recommending to sit near the window, which was nice. Their pumpkin roll and banana nut muffin was really good. I probably won't be in a hurry to go back for coffee as much as the pastries."}
{"text":"Good first:  Gypsy Bean is a wonderful place to meet people or sit and study. Its location is great, the seating is nice, and the music is just loud enough that you can't really hear other people's conversations, but can hear your own. There are plenty of outlets for plugging in laptops, and the wifi seems pretty fast.  Bad:  Their prices are frustratingly high for what you get. It's cool that they make everything there, but the food isn't of sufficiently high quality that I will ever again pay $2.90 for about 5oz of soup. Baked goods are big, sweet, and refined. They're probably the best thing there. The coffee is bad. It's bitter, burnt tasting, and harsh - both drip and espresso. The price of a tea bag and hot water is silly.   That said, it really is a great place to meet people, they have a nice variety of food options, vegetarian, snack size, whole meal size, but the prices are somewhat high and the beverages are overpriced."}
{"text":"This place is great. It has the cozy vibe I love during the winter. Every pastry I've had has been really good, and I would love to come try the lunch offerings. I haven't been particularly adventurous with my coffee picks, but they do make a mean latte. The only thing I wish is that they had big comfy chairs to curl up and read in!"}
{"text":"THE BEST COFFEE HOUSE IN CLEVELAND. Amazing pastries and coffee. You must try the Mexico City. Great place to study too, lots of space.   Also, it must be mentioned that Gypsy Bean gives back to the community. They have donated food to numerous neighborhood events. Let's give back to Gypsy Bean!"}
{"text":"Starbucks who!? Dunkin What!? Yep Gypsy Beans rules the Gordon Square area. It's the best coffee shop in the area. Everything i've tried has been phenomenal, especially the window of sweets when you walk in, the views are great for people watching while surfing on my laptop and studying and they're open pretty late.  The service is always great and everyone is super friendly and helpful and i've become such a regular i always try to bring cash to pay to keeps costs down like the sign says:)"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today and was quite pleased. The coffee, banana bread,  and cheesecake was all to die for.   Quick tip they really do prefer cash transactions."}
{"text":"cinna' ma buuuuuns.  ok, well, not cinnamon buns.  but the cinnamon cheese muffins.  yes, please.  my ass thanks you."}
{"text":"When the staff at Gypsy Beans makes an off-the-menu grilled cheese that is beyond amazing, you know it's the coffee shop to visit. By far my favorite coffee shop to visit in Cleveland. The space is large and perfect for meetings, reading, working, studying, or simply relaxing. While the muffins are the freshest I've had, the food options are all wonderful, and the coffee is smooth and delightful, it's the Gypsy Beans' staff that makes every visit worth it. Every employee goes the extra mile to make you feel like you're sipping a coffee or eating chili right at home. Gypsy Beans is a visit you must make. Gypsy Beans, please make the grilled cheese your next full-time menu offering!"}
{"text":"I was totally happy sipping away at my coffee and chomping on a delicious lemon-glazed scone here. A yelp bud and I spent way longer here than it actually felt like.  When we arrived at 10:30, it was quiet and there were a couple of students studying or doing work on the computer who were sorta giving me the evil eye because of the baby. But then a few more groups came in during the late-morning/early lunchtime rush and made it lively and not as much of a \"library\" like space. And thank god for that, because not only do I like my coffee shops loud and bustling, but Lorelei never stops babbling, so i like to hang out either outdoors with her or in places where noise is tolerated ... Even encouraged.  Plenty of municipal lot parking nearby. Friendly and cool staff. And very interesting sounding lattes ... Might have to go back tomorrow and have something more adventurous than just a regular coffee."}
{"text":"My boyfriend has been blessed with the opportunity to move to this fair city of ours (from the mean streets of the east coast).  I offered to find an apartment for him and, after an extensive search, found something that can only be described as \"rental mecca\" in the detroit shoreway.  after day 1 of the move, we decided to have a little nosh somewhere in the area.  Enter Gypsy Beans and Baking Company.  The breadth of options for a little establishment such as this is really surprising.  Beyond the extensive, unusual list of coffee concoctions, there are also several house-brewed iced teas.  I opted for the green tea which was a perfect strength and served in an vintage milk jug (which I thought was a cute touch).  The flat breads and pizzas looked great and so we chose two:  1. Chicken and carmalized onions 2. Asparagus with smoked sea salt  The dough was some of the best I've sampled in the city.  I liked that these pizzas were imperfect (I know, random - but I liked the dense doughy bits along side the crannies filled generously with toppings and sauce).  For two slices and two large jugs of iced tea, our bill rounded out to $11.  I'm used to east coast prices and this was laughably cheap to me.      Upon finishing his slice, my boyfriend promptly asked \"Do they sell these by the pie?!\"  I'd take that as a resounding two thumbs up."}
{"text":"The pastries here are not to be missed...simply delicious.  The *only* thing that bums me out about this place (and this is my unhealthy self talking) is they don't have any Splenda or Sweet N Low for coffee.  They have white sugar or Turbinado sugar.   hmph."}
{"text":"Great baked goods and excellent coffee. Good people. Would recommend Gypsy Beans and Baking Company"}
{"text":"Great coffee, fast and friendly service. Moderately priced and warm atmosphere.   Complaints:  Wifi could be better They need some vegan and starch-free food options I feel."}
{"text":"So yum!! Staff is fantastic and coffee even better! Their passport lattes are such a good idea, but a little pricy. My favorite of all times is their cappuccino and chocolate cream cheese muffin. Yum! The apple cinnamon muffin is good too! I crave this place in the mornings!"}
{"text":"I was in town and visiting with some previous classmates.  This was a great place to meet.  We had the privacy of the back room for a couple of hours, superb coffee and really good sandwiches.  Did I mention the bakery was pretty darn good too."}
{"text":"We stopped in here while looking for a place that just did coffee and pie and were pleasantly surprised.  Gypsy had the best coffee that I have had by far.  Peace out Starbucks!  I had the Berlin coffee, delicious!!  We each also had a pastry.  The turnover was so light and flaky. All around a great place.  I wish it was on my way to work so I could stop for breakfast everyday!!   Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Despite not having the very best coffee  (honor goes to Rising Star) this is probably my favorite coffee shop in town because it offers a variety of what you would want-excellent pastries, great beverage variety, great breakfast pockets, great service, music and space.  Keep it up."}
{"text":"Located in the heart of the Gordon Square Arts District on Cleveland's near west side Gypsy Beans is so much more than a cafe-- it's a community institution. Whether you're there for an informal meeting (there is always a handful of Cleveland movers and shakers taking meetings there), to get work/studying done with your headphones on using the complimentary WiFi, or just enjoying some coffee it's easy to feel happy and at home at Gypsy.  The artisanal baked goods here are the real stars. The pastries, cookies, and especially the muffins are all excellent. Gypsy is also a great spot for a quick lunch with a solid menu of healthy and delicious salads and sandwiches. My go-to is the Open-Faced Hummus Sandwich: a couple pieces of lightly toasted grain bread with a heaping spoonful of smooth hummus topped with artichoke hearts, crushed pistachios and roasted red peppers. All sandwiches come with a choice of side (get the Curried Lentils!) and a pickle. While it's nothing that I couldn't make at home it's so good that I hardly order anything else when I'm here for lunch.  Whatever you're in the mood for drinking - coffees and teas (hot or iced), flavored lattes, or fruit smoothies - Gypsy has you covered."}
{"text":"As a baseline I like Counter Culture Roasters and Stumptown - solid espresso drinks. I tried their Galápagos Islands latte and thought it was pretty good (probably should have had them throw another shot in to ramp up the espresso flavor). They had a beautiful pastry case. We had a raspberry turnover which was good sized and tasted good.  They have non-dairy milk. Breakfast foods are limited to pastry and bagels. Nice little shop."}
{"text":"I came here today before the movies. I got the beach baby and a frosted star cookie. Very good and the staff was really quick making the drinks. They weren't too friendly at the front counter but their efficiency made up for it. Limited seating so if get here before lunch, it really picked up around 12ish. The cookie was really good I look forward to more of the food. The display case looked yummy and the prices were reasonable considering coffee places always over charge for food lol. Plus there's a parking lot!!"}
{"text":"This place is Fantastic!  I am a self-admitted coffee shop snob, and have a hard time with and place that isn't my beloved Flying M in Boise. So I am always a little skeptical! Gypsy Beans, you have proved my skepticism wrong! I was looking for a pace to hunker down on a rainy day and work on some grad school applications. The atmosphere is quiet enough to allow for focus on your own projects, but loud enough to not be stunned by silence.    I enjoyed a bowl of lobster bisque and a Syracuse (which is what they call a peanut butter mocha) Both were exceedingly good for coffee shop fare, especially the bisque. Prices seem reasonable for Cleveland, this trip cost me less than $10.   Wireless internet is free and the signal is strong. A perfect study spot! I'll be back Gypsy Beans!"}
{"text":"Just dropped in to Gypsy Beans to get some work done and I love it! I always end up studying and finishing work at places like Starbucks, but this place is so much better. A cozy atmosphere with snacks, desserts, coffee, lattes, everything you need and more. I just ordered a Galapagos Latte and all I can say is...holy fricken yum! Can't wait to try the rest of their drinks. Bye bye Starbucks, I have found the ultimate replacement.  Oh and for people terrified of parallel parking, there's a huge lot right in the back with free parking!"}
{"text":"Cute little cafe on Detroit Ave I would have liked to give it more stars but it needs wifi and well, although the staff was friendly she really did not seem to know their products but rather guessed.  I told her it was my first time in and I wanted something caramely and decadent to go with my latte. She suggested a chocolate cake type torte that was supposed to have caramel in it.  It did not.  It was a half frozen chocolate cake with hard shell of icing on top and a dot of runny caramel on the top. It might have been decadent to someone but not to me. To me it was frozen cake. I ate about a third before pitching it. The latte was good not really sweet considering it had caramel and toffee in it but I liked it just the same and would probably get one again. Maybe I will check them out again and see if I can raise my stars :-)"}
{"text":"We had the hummus wrap and the roasted veggie panini and both were excellent! I also enjoyed our Boylan black cherry soda. Lots of options including vegetarian. Good prices and friendly service."}
{"text":"Favorite coffee shop in Cleveland, and lucky for me it's right across the street from where I do my internship.  I only with I came here sooner!  Their coffee sizes are HUGE compared to most other coffee shops.  My medium cappuccino definitely would have been a large elsewhere.  The prices are fair...I don't think any of the specialty drinks pass the $4 mark.  They have some really creative coffee options, but I just ordered a regular cappuccino.  Well-made, perfect temperature (i.e. not scalding hot), smooth flavor.  Beats any other coffee shop cappuccino I've tried in Cleveland.  The baked goods...oh the baked goods.  HUGE and freshly made in house.  I haven't tried one yet because I know that my arteries will not appreciate me devouring one on my own.  When I can drag a friend here, you can get I will be attacking one of those muffins.  The blueberry muffins are practically overflowing with round, plump blueberries.  The chocolate chip muffins look like they have a about a hundred chips baked in.  I'm salivating just thinking about them.  The lunch menu is small, and I haven't tried anything other than their simple salad which is, well, a simple salad.  Freshly made, albeit a bit in the small side (seems the skimp on the healthy foods and give you excess unhealthy foods!).  Only issue I encountered is that there's a $5 minimum for credit card purchases.  As someone who never carries cash, this is a bit of a nuisance.   I will definitely be back...and often."}
{"text":"One of my goals in life is to find the perfect coffee shop. Thus far, I have been unsuccessful in finding this zenith of perfection, but the Gypsy Bean has made enough of an impression on me to be in the running...  My first visit to the Gypsy Bean was less than stellar; the coffee was too bitter and the workers too rude. However, something about the place drew me back in, and subsequent visits have each improved my opinion. Now I frequently suggest it to friends when we're seeking our caffeine fix.  The atmosphere is comfortable, though a little too quiet sometimes. The seats in front of the window are my favorite to sit at and watch the world go by.   Sometimes the best coffee shops are the ones that take time to grow on you... Give Gypsy Bean a try, and you might find a new place to enjoy your coffee."}
{"text":"Friday last, it was rainy and dreary.  As I headed out to the West Side Market for my weekly grocery trip, I stopped at my beloved Gypsy.    The guy behind the counter makes a helluva macchiato!  Loads of foam, just the way I like it, and espresso.  No milk, just the foam and espresso. (It's a macchiato for cryin' out loud people!)    I make my way back to my car & boom, there goes the macchiato, the perfection, all over my car floor.  Aghast, I pause in shock and then begin the mop-up process.  I proceed back to Gypsy, explain dejectedly that I had an accident & the macchiato is no more.  What do they do?  The macchiato artist makes me another brilliant cup at no-charge.  Bless them!  Even in my protestation that it was my error they understood the need for caffeine and granted me another.    Thank you Gypsy for being amazing once again!"}
{"text":"Gypsy is a great stop on my way to work. The coffee is consistently delicious and the baked goods are all made from scratch in-house.  My all-time favorite muffin is the orange-cranberry-walnut.  Every time I go in, the staff is friendly and attentive.  For times that you want to get some work done or read, the dining room is cozy and clean. One of my favorite local coffee joints."}
{"text":"Great tasting coffee,  good WiFi and delicious food! This became my go to coffee place during our 2 weeks stay in the area. Their sandwiches are amazing with very fresh and healthy ingredients . Their hummus and whole grain salad is amazing! They have many of their menu items named after places from all over the world and have clocks showing different times, Tibet for example!  I also bought the Northern Lights dark roast coffee beans that they ground for me,  it makes a great brew in a pourover."}
{"text":"Something about Gypsy Beans rubs me the wrong way. I am still waiting to have a stellar experience here. I personally think their coffee is over priced and always forget that they don't accept card charges under $5.00....that gets me every time and then I have to buy something else because I never have cash. I've worked from my laptop here a few times and the wifi is unreliable. Last time I was here they either forgot my order or somehow I got bumped to the back of the line because 3 people behind me got drinks before I did.   Maybe I just have off experiences every time I come here. I also want to try their pastries after reading other yelper's reviews about them, but other than that, I'll be grabbing my coffee elsewhere."}
{"text":"Not usually big on coffee shop baked goods but their lemon poppy seed muffin is SO GOOD!!!   Great service too, deserving of a thankyouformakingmydayhappiertip.   Also, soy milk for those dairy-sensitive types. I wasn't crazy about the chai overall but the muffin and friendliest barista who called me \"hon\" in a non-offensive or creepy way made me give Gypsy 5 full stars.   Across the street from Yellowcake, a fun boutique run by a former project runway star and right next door to Cleveland Public Theatre. Three cheers for Gordon Square and this coffee shop with the actually delicious muffins."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite coffee shop in cleveland. I drive 50 minutes from the east side to come here and it's worth it every time. The baked goods are freshly made and tasty. The lattes are quirky and I get one every time I come here. I bring all my friends here when they come visit me. This place is a local gem that feels warm and welcoming every time I go there."}
{"text":"Super delicious cinnamon cream cheese muffin. No, there is not cream cheese smeared all over it. It's mixed into the muffin mixture to create a moist and soft fluffy muffin. They didn't have any on display so I asked the man working. He went to the back and came out with a fresh one they just made!I also got a hot chocolate since it's been pretty chilly and rainy outside which was also great. It's roomy and right in the center of Gordon Square. I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Solid neighborhood coffee shop.  I love the iced mocha and like to try some of the\"passport\" flavors with it. I like to add cinnamon and hazelnut. Breakfast sandwiches are really good. Food items very I've had some amazing ones and some I would pass on. The maple muffin is a solid choice. The downside is I work early so I can really only stop in on weekends. If they opened at 6:30 I would be there a lot more often."}
{"text":"I only stopped in here real quick with my friend before we took off for our drive to Canada, but Gypsy Beans seems like it is the quintessential coffee shop. A selection of brews to choose from and baked goods too. Our raspberry muffins, which were eaten on our drive, were phenom even a few hours after we had purchased them. I ended up with a hot chocolate, as I'm not much of a coffee drinker.   While we waited for our drinks, I took a look around. I could definitely see someone coming into Gypsy Bean to read or possibly for a lunch meeting. I had also seen that they have different bands or musical acts play now and then. I hope that I can catch one during the next time that I am in Cleveland."}
{"text":"The Wi-Fi here is excellent, according to patrons! However, if you have a presentation in 10 minutes, you may want to skip the double shot. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5X8I_iClpk"}
{"text":"What a gem! We stumbled in here while working in the area and it was such a pleasant surprise. I got a latte and it was perfect, and my muffin was so delicious that I wanted to go back for another. The women working were so nice, knowledgeable and helpful. I am a coffee snob and my standards are pretty high, but I was very impressed!"}
{"text":"I stopped and had a Coffee to go and Cheese Danish. Cashier was honest when I asked her if all the Pastries were made on site(Yes).  Both coffee and pastry was excellent!"}
{"text":"Good espresso.  As a coffee connoisseur  former barista, I'm picky about what i drink. This place is great. The sweet specialty drinks aren't my forte, but their espresso is fantastic. That matters in those fluffy candy drinks too!"}
{"text":"There is only one negative about Gypsy Bean, but I actually look on it as a positive, even if it's occasionally inconvenient. There are only 2-3 electric sockets in the entire place. This means that you might actually find people in here reading books or newspapers, or perhaps speaking with other people.  That said, Gypsy Bean is the best cafe/coffee house in Cleveland. There is no second place.   The food is really, really good. I'm always pleasantly surprised. I don't like tomato soup, but their tomato soup is one of my favorite soups.  And, the signature lattes are awesome. I always get them iced, which is the way to go for sure.   I am a fan of them putting the tables out on the sidewalk.   In conclusion, stop by here for coffee before or after your movie at the historic Capitol Theater-your play at the Cleveland Public Theatre-your play at Blank Canvas Theatre-your shopping trip to Turnstyle/Yellowcake/Retropolitan/iLTHY-dinner at Stone Mad/Luxe/XYZ-hell, your Romanburger at Mr. Hero-your appointment at Honeycomb Salon-etc.  Wow...that's a lot of stuff to do right in Gordon Square, huh?  Yes, it is."}
{"text":"The baked goods especially the sandwich cookie with the butter cream frosting. Seriously I am drooling just writing this. I haven't had any problems in the past with service. The counter staff is usually very friendly and helpful at explaining menu items. I have had a wide variety of items from here and have yet to be disappointed though when I have taken others with me some were less than impressed. Definitely a solid coffee house with a nice eclectic mix of people."}
{"text":"The coffee and muffin I had were good. They ask for patrons to bus their own tables, which doesn't happen. Over the course of the night the tables remained dirty. The floors were dirty and the back room we had reserved was also dirty. We had to clean up the mess left by the last group having a meeting there, unsatisfactory."}
{"text":"Great cafe!  I'm always looking to try new types of coffee, but the Red Cedar Select has me hooked!  I'm there almost weekly picking up some whole bean for home.  There atmosphere is nice and cozy. They have board games if your looking to hang out awhile, or you can work on a laptop along the window while people watching out the window into Gordon Square.  Their baked goods and meals are good, too.  Particularly, the chickpea salad.  Check it out before/after a movie at the Capitol Theater!"}
{"text":"Being a Cleveland transplant to Seattle, my coffee snobbery has grown exponentially. We are the coffee capitol of the US. We are lousy with independent coffee roasters here.   When you have a coffee addiction that puts Lorelai Gilmore to shame, where does one go in Cleveland? Here. I come here. Every day. As many times as I can. The coffee is excellent, their lattes knock my socks off (especially the spicy one... ugh, I dream of it!) and the bakery is just divine.   If you are making trip to the Gordon Square Arts District, you must come here!"}
{"text":"Gordon Square may seem to be the most complete neighborhood in Cleveland with its theaters, cinema, restaurants, bars, art galleries, new lake front housing, and ice cream parlor, but it lacks day time attractions. There is no where to get something basic to eat in a casual atmosphere. You may think I am overlooking the Big Egg, but since I do not drink I have no need for hangover havens.   Hence this morning I found myself back at Gypsy's believing my last visit nearly two years ago could only find improvement. It did but only slightly. The strongest lure to Gypsy early in the morning is the energy. Patient 8-5ers line up on their way to their workplaces. The rest of the neighborhood is deserted with empty bus stops and cross walks flashing walk and don't walk to no one. A lone woman serves those beginning their days. She is quick, not overly pleasant but overworked.  I do not like burned anything and the beans here are over roasted. I did not enjoy my cup of plain coffee and can see why most people ask for flavored fancied up drinks. The coffee cake I ordered was dry and at least a day old and that is pitiful since I was here at 7:30 AM. I ate in so I did get my coffee and cake in china ware which is an improvement over the chains but with no fork.   Hopefully someone will open a diner or deli where those with leisure time can enjoy it economically and comfortably in this neighborhood. Gypsy is not it."}
{"text":"Possibly some of the best lattes I have ever had. Great flavors. Good atmosphere and perfect spot to hang out with a magazine, newspaper or laptop. Nicely done."}
{"text":"I am not a huge coffee-shop connoisseur, but I have always had a great experience at Gypsy Beans. Last night, the barista got my order exactly right. Not that it was all that complicated, but the drink was perfect, and that made my night. I highly recommend the Fireside Latte!"}
{"text":"Stopped here from California while visiting family and tasted the first real coffee in a week! Friendly staff and a lot of options. Unlike others have said, they do have sugar substitutes and plenty of vegan choices. Loved the atmosphere as well and seems a good place for people watching."}
{"text":"So very lovely. I never go in for flavored lattes unless it's a very particular time of year (that magical window between pumpkin and peppermint) but the Mexican latte at Gypsy Beans was excellent. Just enough spice to make it interesting, not enough to make it sweet. My bowl of chili hit the spot, the warmth of the wood made my book that much better.  There was definitely enough space for our little gathering of Yelpers but if we needed outlets, we'd be in trouble. Charge before you...barge."}
{"text":"One last update for Gypsy Bean... I swear!   But I couldn't let the world go on without knowing how awesome their tuna salad is... seriously. Don't get me wrong, it's not sprinkled with delicious, magical dust. It's just made healthfully and properly. See, on my journey to find at least a couple of places in Cleveland that don't use 1) the worst, brownish grey tuna, 2) scoop on the mayo like it's going out of style and 3) serve this tasteless, fishy garb and charge for it--I found a winner!   Gypsy bean uses albacore tuna mixed with fresh dill, lemon and *gasp* Greek yogurt instead of mayo! I asked for mine on a bed of greens and there you have it, a perfect, healthy lunch. Finally a wonderful spot that does tuna salad right. You can also order it as is in sandwich form, which is still quite healthier and tastier than anything else you'll probably find around town.   Oh, and please do yourselves a favor and try the matte iced tea. I mean, could this place have more awesome? Free wi-fi, awesome coffees, lattes, teas, healthy lunch options, bakery AND they're dog-friendly! Sold."}
{"text":"This is one of the first businesses to begin the transformation of Gordon Square, and remains one of the best.  Excellent coffees, pastries, salads, and sandwiches.  Nikki is an inspiring entrepreneur, and the staff is helpful and friendly.  Also, she is an excellent caterer!"}
{"text":"From the outside, this place looks like an average chain (somewhere in between dunkin donuts and Starbucks). On the inside, though, it has a lot more charm and character! There are a wide variety of yummy beverages and tasty looking treats. 80s music plays in the background. Their decently priced latte didn't overwhelm me but I liked that They had almond milk! The people watching from the big window is great but they need to get more comfortable seating - love seats, couches, etc. definitely worth a visit - especially if you're taking something to go!"}
{"text":"Great little local coffee shop!! Not only do they have great food they also have great local art all over the shop that you can buy.  I loved the veggie sandwich with goat cheese.  I love walking up to the Gypsy bean for my coffee.  I stop by at least  once a week and I am never disappointed."}
{"text":"This is my favorite coffee shop in Cleveland.  It seems they do their best to make the signature drinks extra special....shaved chocolate on top, real whipped cream, a drizzle of raspberry sauce....really, really good.  I've never been disappointed with any of the pastries either.  They usually have something different and I'm appreciative of anything that is housemade instead of the standard muffins and cookies you see everywhere."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic.  A girlfriend and I meet here for dinner about once a month.  The place has a lovely atmosphere (one of the few places I've looked at the wall color and marveled at how lovely it is) The people are super nice, the tea is excellent, and the bakery is just PHENOMENAL.  I normally order the turkey cranberry sandwich.  It is simple, but just delicious. The greek pasta salad is excellent as a side, as is the mac and cheese.  They have a mexican style salad there that is excellent as well.  My friend and I usually arrive and order an iced tea and our meal, then we go back up for dessert from the amazing bakery case (the cakes are always great, as are the danishes.)  To finish it off, get a muffin for the morning!  They have tons of choices (The cinnamon cream cheese and orange cranberry are among my favorite.)  They also appear to have a lot of great coffee drinks though I haven't tried those.  Last time I was there I had a \"tab\" open so I could go back up and order my dessert and muffins which made me giggle. But seriously, it's in an adorable neighborhood, the people who work there are great and the food and bakery are delicious.  FYI, there is a lot in the back of the building that usually has spaces open.  Otherwise, it's fairly easy to find a street spot. Overall, this is one of my favorite places to go, I'd highly recommend it either for a good dinner, or an excellent place to work!"}
{"text":"Let me make a comment on my past and present experience at Gypsy Bean. My first experience there was about 4 years ago and I went in and got an order of the mac and cheese to go. The mac and cheese was not edible. It had absolutely no flavor and it congealed into a single solid mass of goo.  So now fast forward to yesterday. I figured I would go in and get something healthy to snack on because I was going to be shooting a film all day. I went in and ordered the quinoa. I mean how hard is it to put it in stock or water and boil for a specific time period just like rice? I am a huge fan of quinoa and make it all the time. It's very simple to make. I put in in vegetable stock at a 2:1 water to quinoa ratio and when it's done the seeds have popped open and it's a mass of little curly Q's. At Gypsy Bean however 95 percent of the seeds were not cooked and it seemed like some of them were closer to uncooked. They can't even get a simple thing right.  That was my absolute last time going there!"}
{"text":"So supporting the local shops, at gypsy bean. The barista was friendly and clearly over compensating for the crabby young lady at the counter. \"Why are you people coming in here to buy coffee?\" I hope the owner gets this and reassigns miss nasty to the back room"}
{"text":"Oh, how I wish Gypsy Beans would clone itself and open shop in Medina.    What a sweet little coffeehouse this is with the most clever of drink offerings, and a friendly staff to match.  Parking is convenient, and the corner location makes the whole block smile.  I look forward to the next time I'm in town and can stay awhile."}
{"text":"Love this place! Their coffee is amazing, and their food/baked items are top notch. I sat here for a couple hours working on some projects. What a lovely atmosphere. Great vegan options, so that's always a win in my book!"}
{"text":"This isn't just a great place to get a good cup of coffee. It's got ample parking and is a good place for meetings or to work solo."}
{"text":"I've been to Gypsy Beans a few times over the past month. It's a very solid coffee shop. They sell food, pastries, and plenty of coffee. The baristas are nice, if not a little apathetic (but I think that's to be expected at any coffee shop). One thing that did frustrate me was the fact that the internet wasn't working one time, and it didn't seem like anyone behind the counter cared. Everyone with laptops, myself included, left.  Their iced Toddy is great (not the best in Cleveland, but I still enjoyed it!) - as is their selection of Lattes - so many choices! They even have a few sugar free choices. I got the Londoner. It was great, but next time I might ask for a little less syrup! I would definitely recommend getting one of their several lattes at some point -- they're like coffee-candy!  A few people brought in their kids, plenty of couples having lunch/getting coffee. It's also a great place to get some work done (although outlets along the window bench would be super convenient!). The music is great, but every time I've been there it's always been a little too loud. I'll definitely be returning!  If this cafe had more outlet accessibility, less loud music, and baristas who seemed a bit more friendly (the larger red-headed barista excluded, he was da shit), I'd rate this place 5/5"}
{"text":"Great coffee -- love the Provence mochas -- and I'm a giant fan of their iced tea selection in the summer (which you can see brewing in a number of large glass carafes behind the counter). It's great that the neighborhood parking lot is right behind here, more or less -- you can park, grab a coffee, and walk to all the fabulous places in Gordon Square."}
{"text":"I finally made it to Gypsy Bean for the first time last week, and I wish I had tried it sooner!  I very rarely have a sweetened or flavored coffee drink, but their menu of unique \"passport drinks\" was calling to me...and as much as I enjoy a good Cleveland autumn, the \"Tropics\" was tempting me. I asked the barista, who was very cheerful, how sweet the drink was. He told me it would be pretty sweet, but he could go easy on the syrups, which would lessen the sweetness but lessen the flavor as well. I told him I would give it a try.  This was a great drink! It had plenty of coconut flavor and was pleasantly sweet.  After spending a couple hours here, getting some work done at my window seat while listening to their really good selection of music, I decided to pick up a few pastries to take home for my family before I left. I got a sfogliatella (no, I don't know how to pronounce that...) which was a crispy phyllo-dough pastry filled with cheese, a snicker doodle cookie, a chocolate cookie, and a pumpkin roll, and everything was delicious!  Gypsy Bean is a great cafe with some tasty food and drinks and a friendly attitude. I will definitely be back here soon!"}
{"text":"Great coffee shop that is becoming my go-to option when I want to chill for a little bit. Great variety of espresso drinks. I'm more of a drip coffee person myself, but these espresso drinks struck a nice balance and were not over-the-top sweet like the ones you find at a Starbucks. I particularly recommend The World and The Tropics espresso drinks. A few caffeinated sips and you'll be like 'woooooooo lets do some homework!\" which brings me to my next point.  Relative to most other coffee shops in the area, Gypsy has a lot of seating space. I paricularly like the 7 or 8 stool seats they have  facing the naturally sunlit window. Great for relaxing with your laptop and doing some work.  Mostly a coffee shop, but there is also a limited menu of pastries and food. They had philly cheesesteak sicilian style pizza slices. Legit!"}
{"text":"This is a nice little coffee shop.  Very friendly staff.  Drinks were good quality.  They have free wi-fi which to me is a must for every coffee shop.  I was there in the afternoon so I didn't see the place when it's busy, but it seemed like it would be a great place to study, read, or just chill for an afternoon."}
{"text":"We walked in about fifteen minutes from closing which clearly annoyed the barista. The coffee was pretty good and the microwaved slice of pizza was edible but not earth shattering.  To be fair, the menu intrigued me enough that I want to go back and give it another go. I'll just be sure to get there a little earlier."}
{"text":"Great first impressions are important to me. You too?  Came for coffee and a little something post breakfast bar livery service.  The little something was a raspberry baked dough thing. Simple, cheap, and great.  Like a hamentashen well balanced dark roast.  You will like the indie coffee shop vibe and Detroit street views.  Cool spot and prices good."}
{"text":"Delicious chicken tarragon wrap, good coffee, laid back young vibe. Perfect for a quick lunch or cup of coffee. Eclectic, kind and patient staff. Great spot to post up and do paperwork or study. They prefer cash!"}
{"text":"Good coffee, great food, pleasant atmosphere.  Love the big windows for people watching."}
{"text":"Was in Cleveland for the Weapons of Mass Creation Fest and was told about Gypsy.  All I had was a coffee and a scone both were good.  I over heard people raving about the sandwiches.  On my list of places to eat."}
{"text":"Nice place, and gets bonus points for actually being OPEN. We tried finding a coffee shop around the Cleveland area on a Sunday evening and everything was closed by 6. Sucks that coffee shops close so early here. Anyways, found that this one was open and hopped in the car since it wasn't walking distance away.  We had a cappuccino and a latte to drink.  And a banana with chocolate frosting muffin for dessert. Was delicious. Window seats were nice to sit by as I love to people watch.   Staff was very friendly. Would come back."}
{"text":"Tasty fresh pastries. We were passing through town and they had nice seating and good treats at this little shop."}
{"text":"I adore this coffee shop in Gordon Square. It's a little gritty, but isn't that what makes it so CLE?  Of most of the cafés in the area, this one has the most seating. Tables everywhere! They also line the walls with rad local art for sale, which as any of you know, is the key to my heart. I'm currently staring at a phenomenal, framed drawing by Chris Deighan that I'm trying so hard to exhibit self-control on. Really fascinating people also roll through here, which makes it fun to people watch.  Really awesome selection of fancy coffees and teas here, and this is one of the few places that doesn't give me a sugar rush on their drinks, which I truly appreciate. This café has tons of natural lighting, which is either a blessing or curse depending where you're sitting. My favorite table is the one in the very back, smacked against the wall (aaanddd.. there's an outlet!). When the midday light hits, it won't hurt your eyes back there.   While the muffins are to die for, they also just expanded their menu to include lunch! They now have sandwiches, paninis and other small sides. It's safe to say this place is now more than just a bakery and café. Also, I loved the little message engraved on my table when I lifted up my coffee just now. Can't fake that kind of character :)"}
{"text":"Prime hipster people watching at this joint. Cute indie girls are to this place like hot hippie girls are to Trader Joe's.  OK, now that I've come out as a total creeper, I do have to say that I love hitting this place up before or after an outing in the ever-evolving Gordon Square. You know, get wasted at the Happy Dog and then sit around here for a couple hours sobering up with amazing coffee, a killer muffin, and hot indie girls. I MEAN, free wi-fi. Or as I call it, wizzle-fizzle."}
{"text":"Great spot! Large & sunny, with a robust drink menu & plenty of creative options from their \"passport\" drinks, each named after a city around the world. I haven't yet tried their pastries or sandwiches, but everything looks fresh & lovely, so truly, it's a feat of my own self-restraint that I've been able to keep from indulging thus far. This is a great spot to meet up with a friend or client, or to camp out with your laptop for a bit. I love their bar area, facing out onto the street, where you can both get your work done & watch the world go by."}
{"text":"Moderately priced. Muffin was perfect, so soft and moist. Black coffee was very good, they have a lot of options. Every latte flavor you can think of. Awesome assortment muffins!"}
{"text":"Oh, how I want to like this place...it's close to where I work, and I want to support local businesses.That being said, I am done with Gypsy. If you are a regular or friend or the barista, you might get a smile and some prompt service. The rest of us seem to be a nuisance to her. The place is dirty- no surprise since the patrons are the only ones who bus the tables. Gordon Square is thriving, and this is the only place to get a cup of coffee (currently). As much as it kills me, I'd rather drive a few miles to Starbucks, where at least the product is consistent and the service is friendly."}
{"text":"This is a great place to get something to eat and just watch the world go by in Cleveland's newest hot neighborhood.  The food is reasonably priced and the non-coffee beverages are decent enough (I don't drink coffee so I can not comment on them but from what I hear from friends they are good)."}
{"text":"I'm not gonna freak out about this place like all these other people who seem to have had too many espressos as they wrote their reviews. It's a good place. I don't really go there to hang out and people watch like everyone else seems to, but I do get hot drinks there.   The coffee is good. I haven't eaten there because the pizza in the display case looks slightly better than the pizza that's been on my counter since last Friday. I have heard the food and pastry from the kitchen looks and tastes much better than the stuff in the display case. But if you want to know more about the pastries, don't ask me, go ask a fat person.   The girls are always friendly, but the guy who regularly retrieves my coffee for me is undoubtedly disgusted with me. He may have me confused with someone else, but I have never seen this guy anywhere other than at Gypsy Bean. Plus I know for a fact I haven't been involved with his girlfriend. Or boyfriend. Or whatever his case may be. It's become a bit of a game to me to see how mad he is at me for coming in to get coffee."}
{"text":"I love Gypsy Beans, nice crowd never too loud, warm atmosphere, great shopping nearby.  A plus is that they're open until 9 - wish they were open later!  Great place to hang out, work, whatever...good place to get away from the bright, over-produced gloss of S Bucks."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in the area, I make this my morning breakfast stop on the way to work to grab a quick coffee. It's an easy in and out and I can always find a parking spot. The coffee is great and their muffins are insane!!! So good! Tons of different flavors to choose from and you can't go wrong with any of them."}
{"text":"I rarely drink coffee. So, why am I here more than once a month ? It's a great third place. Dates, meetings, yelp office hours, coding sessions, you name it. Its location is central for those meeting on the west side of Cleveland (between Lakewood and Downtown CLE, at Gordon Square!).   My favorite feature is the back room, featuring a cute large conference table that seats 8 comfortably for meetings and a door that closes if you're concerned about noise. Most importantly, it's able to be reserved for free, (huzzah), often  is a couple weeks in advance.   Yes, some of the time, I don't even buy anything, but I never received any scowl and baristas have always been friendly. I'll pick it up on the next time. Of course, free wifi is a big plus.   A great addition to the Gordon Square neighborhood. Given the size of the space, it's well organized, never too loud, and offers a variety of snacks including desserts (e.g. scones and croissants) and things with more sustenance like pizza bagels."}
{"text":"Gypsy Beans is such a great local coffee shop! Every time I stop in, this place is packed. They have free wifi, and a bunch of tables to get some work done. Their lattes are fabulous with just the right amount of foam on top.  I have not been in for food yet, but from what I read, I need to. I will definitely be back in soon, especially since they are dog friendly. You can't go wrong with that!!"}
{"text":"I was genuinely underwhelmed by Gypsy, what with all the hype. I didn't find the atmosphere welcoming, and the prices were, um, astronomical for what I ordered food-wise. I also found the chai to be bland and disappointing."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere of this place. I had the macchiato and it was delicious, possibly one of the better macchiatos I have ever had. The only problem that annoyed me were the tables and chairs as most of them seem to wobble. Other than that, great place to do work or have some coffee or tea."}
{"text":"I stopped in here to grab a coffee on the go and was impressed with their huge selection! They had vegan treats, over 20 flavors of Italian sodas, and what they called the coffee passport. A big chalkboard listed multiple places around the globe, each with their own unique flavors.   I had an almond milk iced latte and it was probably the fastest latte ever made! I had barely taken my wallet out and it was already in front of me! It was delicious and I was happy to see simple syrup at the counter for the coffee, despite it being mid January. Nothing is worse than trying to add sugar packets to ice coffee!   I'm looking forward to going back to try more coffee flavors and maybe a snack or two. :)  The store also had local handmade cleveland cards and notebooks for sale. It's always nice to see stores supporting local work! There was also store merchandise for sale, like coffee mugs and bags of their coffee beans."}
{"text":"I'm only giving 3 stars because of a recent bad visit- don't counting that one, would get 4 stars. Last time, I ordered a chicken sandwich with chevre. The chicken was undercooked- not a good thing with chicken (salmonella). Otherwise, the food is usually well prepared and tasty. I don't really care for the coffee- it tends to taste burned (are the beans roasted too long or do they just add extra grounds to the pot?). I order tea. The atmosphere deserves 4 stars- warm, slightly rough around the edges. I think they were hoping to become a hipster hangout, judging by the location, the barista with the handlebar mustache, and the ambience. Instead, most of their customers are gay professionals, single white women who like being around gays, and neighborhood yuppies who don't feel like driving to Starbucks. This joint is more Gordon Square than Detroit Shoreway. That is, it is like Cleveland Heights without the black people. Being inside Gypsy, you would have no idea that 2 blocks off Detroit you would  hear Spanish all around you."}
{"text":"Always fast and friendly.  The coffee is top notch and the homemade pastries are to die for.  Be sure to say hi to Nicki, and if you visit more than half a dozen times, they are likely to remember you and your drink."}
{"text":"Breakfast person? Go to gypsy and get the Greece!!  Especially if the ingrdients of the day are asparagus and goat cheese!  Their food is made fresh every day and they only make a limited amount to make sure they don't waste any food. So make sure to get their early for breakfast before it's all gone.   The owner, Nikki, is FANTASTIC! and she really makes sure that she hires the friendliest and most efficient staff around!  Need a pick me up on a slow work day? Get the Toddy! or if it's cold out get the red eye!"}
{"text":"Local coffee shop with a sizeable menu. The Passport Lattes are what draws people in. At least me that is! Specifically the Syracuse, which is peanut butter mocha bliss! Every time I'm in there, there are plenty of people enjoying their coffee, chatting with friends or being productive on their laptop. But I usually get in and get out, with good coffee in hand!"}
{"text":"Great place! Gourmet coffee without the pretentiousness, great cafe food, and great place to work on your laptop.  I come here some mornings when I need to get out and still get some work done. I don't mind the 25-minute drive! It's one of the few local coffee shops left in the city, and pretty much the only one with real food any time of day.   If you're sick of stale cheese danish and rock-hard \"scones\", this is your joint. Today I got a very good-size scrambled egg, bacon and rosemary breakfast bake in phyllo dough, a cookie and a large coffee (eat-in, so with tax) for $6.85.   Wi-fi is great, plenty of places to sit (long window counter if all of the tables are full) and typically good indie music. Lots of solos here, but I've seen a lot of groups of 4-6 hang/meet too (I think there's a conference table in the back, too.) Staff is always super friendly and helpful (not judgy or snobby like some other places) and I never feel out of place here."}
{"text":"I can't adequately express my sorrow that Gypsy Beans & Baking Co. opened so close to my departure from my job at Near West Theatre this January, which is only a block away.    This eagerly anticipated addition to the ever-blossoming Detroit Shoreway neighborhood has garnered much attention and many fans in the past year or so that it has graced the corner of 65th and Detroit.  Gypsy's basic theme as a Euro-style coffeehouse revolves around a remarkably eclectic, worldly selection of unique and delicious coffee drinks, lunch and dinner dishes, and pastries.  Want a sandwich?  Forget plain old turkey, try the roast turkey with cranberry chutney (my favorite sandwich there).  They also have pomegranate salad thing with goat cheese...it's amazing.  Their soups are really good, too.  Their regular house coffee is always fresh and tasty, but I usually veer toward the specialty coffees, 'cause I'm that kinda gal.  These drinks are all named after the locations that inspired each individual concoction.  I am partial to The Moscow, which is a combo of white chocolate and raspberry, or The Berlin (chocolate and cherry), though they tout the Mexico City as their \"must try\" coffee.  And the perfect complement?  A scone, or a slice of carrot cake.  Delicious.  The space is open and light, with a large wall of windows and various seating choices, from counter seating, tables in the main dining room, and a private room in the back that can be reserved for the occasional lunch meeting or other event, a smart move considering the main crowd of customers coming through.  The decor is simple, my favorite accent being the row of clocks mounted on the wall which tell time in multiple time zones.  Yep, I could spend all day here... which is completely possible, since they have WiFi.  I'll definitely be making a reunion trip over there soon."}
{"text":"Some of the best coffee in Cleveland. Nice baristas and a very comfortable and casual atmosphere.  The americano is made with coffee instead of water like Starbucks (I think they call this something different there) but regardless it feels like the \"right\" way to do it.  Every drink I've had here has been delicious and I miss living around the corner from them"}
{"text":"I'm coming back here! I needed a spot to cool off and make some quick calls while working in the Gordon Square area, and Gypsy Beans was a convenient stop. I didn't have much time, but ducked in for an iced coffee. Utilized the free wifi, and made my calls. Both the staff and the clientele were friendly. Folks were chatty, and told me I should try the baked goods or lunch offerings. I'll be working in the neighborhood again soon, and I'll be sure to stop again."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this coffee shop. I've been several times in the last couple of years, but every time I have felt like the prices were high and the quality was average - especially considering the smaller cup sizes that are typical for local coffee shops (vs Starbucks). This could be a perception - maybe I am just feeling like I don't get as much for the money.   They offer a dozen or more different flavors of coffee beverages. I have enjoyed trying a handful of them. They also have bakery items and a small menu of food items. I wasn't really overly impressed with any of the ones I tried.  The atmosphere is where Gypsy Beans really excels. They have several small tables, barstools, and even a small room in the back where people meet. They have boardgames and an overall fun, community atmosphere. The location helps with this - located on Detroit, near the LGBT center and hip local venues, it draws a diverse crowd.  So if you are primarily in the market for a great atmosphere where you can hang out with friends and support a local coffee shop, you'll probably love Gypsy Beans. If you are mainly looking for high-quality coffee and food, you may be disappointed. I recommend that you give it a try for yourself if you are on the fence."}
{"text":"Love love love Gypsy Beans! From their drinks to my personal favorite the open faced hummus, it is all delicious. It is topped with pistachios, red peppers and is on top of toast points.   The inside is quaint and pretty spacious. The drinks are good. Baked goods are really tasty too."}
{"text":"i've only been here once to get some coffee to go. the first thing that caught my eye was the variety of latte drinks on the menu. i think they called it their \"passport drinks\" (or something along those lines) because each latte is named after a city. i tried the mexico city - a hazelnut + cinnamon latte - which tasted great. my friend had the moscow - white chocolate + raspberry latte - which was pretty decent as well.  the interior is spacious. i could picture myself comfortably reading a book or studying here. i haven't tried any of their other drinks or pastries yet so i won't comment on that.  the one thing that really left an impression on me was the service. my friend accidentally spilled all of her coffee so i ordered a new one for her. the barista promptly made a new drink and gave it to us. when i tried handing him cash for the new drink, he refused to take it. even after i insisted that he should take the money, he wouldn't take it. a pretty rare, heartwarming moment if you ask me.  i'll be coming back whenever i have a chance to. a business like this deserves customers."}
{"text":"Items Selected: Carrot Cake Muffin Blueberry Scone Oatmeal Raisin Cookie Cinnamon Roll Banana Nut Bread Butterscotch Brownie Chocolate Chip Peanut Butter Muffin  Located on Detroit Avenue and providing locals with everything from Vegan Cuisine and Good Coffee to local Art and Sounds, Gypsy Beans & Baking Company is an independently owned Bistro offering an all-day menu plus baked goods in a comfortable setting, a sampling of seven items on Sunday morning showing good skills with a focus on Quickbreads, Brownies, Cookies and Muffins.  Located in a slowly growing Arts District, patrons on this particular day sparse as the restaurant did good business with to-go orders, it was after lengthy perusal of options that choices were selected, the still-warm Cinnamon Roll undoubtedly the best of the group beneath a slather of Cream Cheese icing while the Carrot Cake Muffin was also quite good and chock-full-of spice beneath an even thicker layer of the same Frosting.  Disappointed in the dried-out Banana Nut Bread, while the Scone was more a triangular Muffin than the British version juxtaposing pockets of Butter to those of Sugar, better bites were found amongst the fluffy Peanut Butter Muffin studded with Chocolate Chips, the Oatmeal Raisin a well-done bakehouse standard but not particularly memorable when compared to the thick and fudgy Brownie topped in Butterscotch Chips."}
{"text":"I came here on a rainy Sunday afternoon, 15 April 2018, with a friend after the sweat local Cleveland event (free workouts). I was hungry and needed protein that would fill be up. This place didn't disappoint. Infact, I was so focused on eating and chatting with my friend Estefania that I forgot to take a photo of my food....lol. Oh well, you will have to come here to try this place out for yourself.  I ordered the Thai chicken wrap which was very delicious. The sesame peanut sauce is definitely what makes this wrap stand out. YUM. I also ordered a side of chili which I believe came with the meal (a side dish option comes with the meal). The chili was alright and it didn't have much flavour.  Overall, I had a good experience here. Sandwich was a bit on the pricey side. I will definitely be back though because I would like to try one of their vegan food items.  P.S. I love the art on the walls and the big tables. The big tables are great for study groups."}
{"text":"I've always wanted to blog about a coffee shop...while sitting in the place I'm yelping about. So, today is my day!   I searched high and low for a good coffee shop to do work in. One that wasn't too crowded, that had good pastries, with solid internet, (yes, no fading signals!!) and good good coffee. I found that , here in Gypsy.  One major plus for my lack of parallel parking skills, is the fact that there's parking behind the coffee shop. YESSSSS. For free. DOUBLE YESSSS.   Sitting on the corner of 65th, with the Capitol Theatre right down the street, this place is a great place to just chill, grab some strong coffee, eat a yummy pastry and get to work. I'm sitting here on a Friday afternoon, with maybe 3-4 quiet ppl, at a table by myself, with ample outlets for my laptop. Triple yes.  I walked in and was instantly greeted by the guy at the counter. It was so distracting- there were so many different kinds of lattes and all super unique! And they have drip coffee. Yes. I stumbled upon one of those \"inside Ohio\" blogs the other day and Gypsy was mentioned. And I'm so glad it was.  I ordered an ice toddy. Mmmm. Nice, flavorful, and STRONG. I especially like that. I got hungry...and asked the guy behind the counter what he recommended- and he stated that I should try his fave- a breakfast cookie of some sort- and it's good. Really good. It has oats, grains, walnuts..with an apricot filling on top...it feels healthy...and so tasty...and only 65 cents! WHAT! So cheap.   And they're clean here. In the last hour I've been sitting here, they've cleaned the tables, and the guy is not sweeping the floor. I always hate entering coffee shops that are grimy and dirty...this place is clean.  I like. I approve. I've found my cool coffee joint to do work at...I just wish it wasn't so far from me...but hey, at least CLE never has traffic. The coffee is great here- give it a try!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was a really cool local coffee hangout, but don't try to go here for lunch. The service was a little sketchy, and the lunch food was not good. The pizza was good until I figured out that the dough wasn't cooked all the way through. The lady serving me didn't seem to know what they had from their menu that was available.  During the ten minutes I was in there, I had several cryptic conversations with her, two of which went something like this.  Me: \"I just like to get something for lunch to go.\" Her: \"What?\" Me: \"I'd just like to get some lunch for takeout, please.\" Her: \"Huh? What?\" Me: \"To go. I want to get lunch to go.\" Her: \"Oh.\"  And then with the salad... Her: \"What kind of salad dressing would you like?\" Me: \"I don't know, Italian?\" Her: \"Oh wait, we only ever have one kind.\"  They did have a ton of indulgent treats in their pastry case, including cookies the size of personal pizzas. All of the pastries were so unnecessarily oversized, however, that they were almost unappetizing.  Also, I might add that on their website (http://gypsybeans.com/), they call themselves a \"bistro\" with \"the freshest seasonal ingredients prepared with worldly influences.\" In what universe is marginally cooked, mediocre pizza a good idea? The only thing they had fresh was the iceberg lettuce in my salad. What kind of bistro is this???  Overall disappointing, but I'll go back to try their coffee!"}
{"text":"So, I just bought my husband a pretty fancy espresso machine for his birthday. Obviously, he is spoiled. But more importantly, he is very into coffee and I am therefore along for the ride. We are now on a combined mission for some locally and recently roasted beans. First step is to get into the CLE coffee scene, right? So we saw Gypsy Beans on Yelp and decided to stop.   Apparently a grimy coffee joint containing unpleasant, rash employees now deserves a 4 star rating. I just don't get it. Yes, we had some slightly annoying questions about where his beans are roasted and sourced from, but come on! He was straight up rude. Might as well have said, \"Can you please shut up and give me your money now?\"   So, we ordered. Me - a vanilla latte. Tasted okay, but doesn't anything containing liquid sugar? Tasted my husband's cappuccino and ewww...just bitter. The milk was either foamed by a first timer or just someone who didn't give a sh*t (wow I am officially a yuppie).   My biggest problem: crumbs and dirtiness wherever you look. Gross. I am not normally one to notice things like this, but there was so much gunk under the espresso machine that I think it was developing into some sort of being.   I know this was a harsh review, but ugh....I just really got the creeps about this place. It makes us even more excited to return to Rising Star Coffee for some amazing beans and great advice."}
{"text":"If Gypsy Beans was closer to my apartment or on the way to work, I would stop there every morning. They make a nice cup of coffee. The food is pretty good also. I am a big fan of their iced coffee. It is a nice place to get work done or have a conversation with a friend. It is not too quiet so if you need to answer a work related phone call, you won't seem bothersome to others and not too loud where you cannot concentrate. A nice, well rounded coffee shop."}
{"text":"Obviously they have great coffee, but try the food! Get the veggie-licious on a croissant with goat cheese. It's life changing."}
{"text":"Popped into this shop today, and it was a fun experience! I ordered their Antarctic latte and a Danish and wasn't disappointed with either! If you're looking for somewhere on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon to sit down relax and grab a quick bite! This place is sure not to disappoint!"}
{"text":"I've been sampling the area's local coffee shops and today decided to spend the afternoon studying here. It had the feel of a Nero Coffee Shop (for those of you that know the UK). They have a sizeable food menu for a coffee shop and a case full of bakery. I didn't have any food, but the drinks were good. I'm a little disappointed that there tea is not fresh loose leaf, but the one I had was still very good. It is a full leaf silk bag instead which is a good compromise. The place was very busy with a good noise level on a Sunday afternoon, but there was plenty of spots in the parking lot to the left (east) of it just off Detroit and street parking as well. The tables were all full when I arrived including the stools along the windows facing Detroit. As I was sitting though I noticed a kind of back room where I think there was extra seating - I will check this area out next time as it might be quieter as well."}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday afternoon and thoroughly enjoyed myself. This is a cute locally owned corner coffee shop that serves delicious espresso drinks and pastries.  For some reason, when I first walked in and read the menu on the board I thought that the Passport Drinks were their tea selection, but actually they are their speciality espresso-based drinks. Since I only realized this afterward, I just went for a regular mocha which I still found to be delicious.   I also ordered something that looked like an oatmeal cookie with a raspberry center that was also very good. Yum!  This looked like both a good place to hang out with friends or do some work solo. I came with some friends and we sat looking out the front windows. Very enjoyable.  Bonus points as well for the guy who made my mocha being noticeably cute.   Definitely a place I would be happy to come to again next time I am in town."}
{"text":"Great little local coffee shop in the area that serves tons of coffee from all over the world. Staff is friendly and helpful and it is in a great location in the middle of Gordon Square. There are many free parking lots around the area which is definitely helpful! On the outside it may look small, but the inside is very spacious and tons of working areas with lots of great art around the room!"}
{"text":"Coffee from all over the world and a great selection of food as well. Great location and decent parking options around the square"}
{"text":"Close to home, very relaxed place. Awesome pastries. Although I quit coffee, they have an excellent selection. The MexicoMexican was my favorite.   I actually have a kind of...awkward, maybe disturbing history or attachment with this place. I wont go into that story.   Sitting here on the patio, I notice the hatred I have for the fairly new bus stops.  1. They're metal (great for Cle weather) 2. They probably cost a fortune 3. They're riddled with holes providing basically no shelter, whatsoever.   I just noticed this newly installed well call it a sculpture for lack of a better word right now on the corner. Its literally 4ft. In front of me and I just noticed it. They may have installed it while I was inside to be honest.   Ill post pics of these for better mentally stimulating imagery.   I shouldn't be writing this while here, way too much going on!!! This crazy world... Til' next time."}
{"text":"First impression? The girl at the counter was a total b*@&$. I mean - I understand it's early - that's why I am getting coffee. You don't need to roll your eyes at me when I don't know the exact terminology for the pastry I am selecting. You have like 100 of them - and none of them are labeled, so we will have to use descriptors here.   I ordered the Mexico City latte and the boy ordered the The World latte. They were good, but about halfway through they became so sweet that I couldn't finish. I still really liked them - but next time I'd ask for less syrup.   Overall, I had my hopes high... this place was good. Just not amazing. Bummer."}
{"text":"Can't believe I haven't written a review for this place up until now. I used to come in here all the time when I was in university, I would stay for at least a couple hours and get a drink, dessert, and usually a soup. The baristas are always incredibly friendly, and I confess that one time my debit card was cancelled due to the Target security breach, so it didn't go through when I tried to purchase my items and the barista kindly let it go, and told me I could get them next time (which of course I did!).  They have really unique flavor combinations of their drinks, and I like that their mochas aren't too sweet for me. Their bakery is hit or miss in my opinion, but I like coming in here because of the location and atmosphere, and to see some friendly faces. I would definitely recommend to others in the Gordon Square Arts district area, and still stop back from time to time!"}
