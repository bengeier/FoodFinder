{"text":"The pizza here was really good! I'd recommend it mostly for a take-out, they don't have much seating inside the tiny restaurant. They have recently added two little tables and a few small chairs out on the patio.   Roma's sells pizza by the slice (it looks like they have three types to choose from at any given time) or you can order from their varied menu. I had the Hawaiian, which oddly enough also had mandarin oranges on it. I wasn't sure how I'd feel about the oranges, but they were friendly with the pineapple and the whole thing worked.   The sauce had a great flavour, the crust was just right and the whole thing was a delicious hot and cheesy experience. If you're in the neighbourhood it is worth a try, I was pleasantly surprised by this pretty unassuming pizza joint."}
{"text":"Stereotypical pizza joint through and through. See the hefty pizza guy in the back flipping pizza dough. Sports on the TV in the front. Rotating mix of pizzas to buy by the slice for a very reasonable price.   Decent pizza crust, good toppings, pretty heavy on the oil. More a guilty one off than something you should be eating often.  A-ok for takeout or delivery."}
{"text":"I Just received the pizza I ordered for the first time and it was terrible. Decided to give them a chance because they are closer then my regular (Gus') I usually have to wait 1:15 or more and momma was hungry! Comes within 30 mins and I couldn't  even finish the first slice.  I just got off the phone with Gus' Pizza because I know it's delicious. Chose to order something in my neighbourhood and was sadly disappointed. The sauce the toppings or lack of everything! Asked for well done and it wasn't even cooked in the middle. I recommend that they taste the food that they are producing. Can't get the sauce taste out of my mouth! At least when you order from dominos or Pizza Hut you know what you are getting. This was just horrible. I will never betray you again Gus' Pizza"}
{"text":"Had a Greek style Pizza an WOW let me tell you it was amazing. Good quality Pizza for sure. I think it's a new owner now as I tried this place forever ago and didn't taste that great. Wanted to give another chance as I live down the street"}
{"text":"This is the most authentic Italian pizza in Calgary.   We got pizza delivered tonight by a lovely young guy (as usual), and it happened to be the wrong kind of pizza (never happened to us before). STILL, the best pizza ever.  Salads are so delicious. Real feta and olives and perfect olive oil dressing.   This is the only place I order from."}
{"text":"This was our first time ordering from Roma's, been waiting anxiously for the right time and tonight was the night!  Staff was great, friendly. Pizza, so disappointing. I think the worst part was the cheese, too thin, runny, did not taste like quality mozzarella.  Toppings were good (we had the Roma's Special).Tomato sauce, ok. Husband also agreed whole heartedly that the cheese was a big no-no.  The dough and bacon on top were burned, REALLY wish our experience could have been better.  Thumbs down."}
{"text":"Ordered a small pepperoni pizza for take out on a Saturday night. This was my first time visiting and was surprised how empty the place was on a Saturday, but given how you could order and pickup, I thought perhaps most of the business is take away. I waited about 7 minutes to pick up my order because there was only one person in the restaurant and he took 3 phone orders while I was standing there. The whole time I could see my pizza sitting on top of the oven in a box ready to go.  When I did get my pizza and brought it home, it was just ok. Don't get me wrong, the flavor and crust consistency is above the normal mass producing chains, and is probably the saving grace of the pizza. The disappointment was from the toppings' quantity. The pepperoni pizza comes with mushrooms which I am allergic to, so I order mine without. The lack of one ingredient however should not mean such a sparse coverage.  There wasn't much pepperoni and loads of cheese.  Now I love cheese,  but it can be a bit much if not supported by the crust or other toppings, especially when not best quality aka greasy.  Other things of note- the hours and prices listed online are not consistent with the ones on the store front or menu. The price for a small pizza is a bit on the high end, which wouldn't be a problem if the pizza was better."}
