{"text":"I have never gone to a Korean restaurant where they charge extra for rice!  We had Bul Go Gi, which was reasonably priced, but the flavor was lacking. Where was the marinade? The service was slow and, by the way, they only accept cash. I don't like to give negative comments but I will never go back there again."}
{"text":"all you can eat here doesn't make ECONOMIC sense - unless you can eat like a starving uni student or a professional athlete!  Special 2 = $24 per person, so a total of $50 for 2 people. - each meat purchased individually costs $12.99, so that's at least 4 main meats to eat before your close to even - the soup and rice are included but really not needed (soup was too salty) - the kim chi dishes come regardless if you order al la carte or buffet  So if you could have 2 mains for $12.99 each and be full, why would you AYCE BBQ? Perhaps for the variety? After all, for the Special #2, you can choose from the 8 different meats!  Let me explain how it works - you can order 3 meats to start, and when you have FINISHED these 3, you can order more.  We ordered our 3 meats - kalbi, pork belly and bulgogi - each was a mountain of meat, probably 400-500g on each plate. How close did we get to finishing these 3 plates to try any of the other 5 available meats? ~about 70%.  So we had to ask for a special favour just to try the sirloin and spicy pork (which was all fat). The sirloin was worth it though.  Beware, don't cook everything because you'll be charged for uneaten COOKED meat. Which makes me wonder a bit as to what happens to the unused uncooked meat, which had been sitting on our table for about an hour....  having said all this - the meat generally is better than average quality - tender without too much gristle. The staff, who don't speak much english, were friendly but they hovered a bit too much to try to stop patrons burning the hotplate.  So, my advice, unless you really can eat a lot, is to order the dishes separately and you be just as full and probably spend half as much!"}
{"text":"Took my mom, my siblings and my cousins for my mom's birthday dinner. From the time we came in, until we left the we were treated like VIP guests. We each got theDinner Special 1 (chef's order and choice) and the bbq meats were delicious. It was full meal (soup, veggies and all the delicious korean side dishes) The pork and the chicken were crowd favourites.  I think the biggest win was when the owner found out it was my mom's birthday, he went to the bakery got a huge birthday cake for my mom and brought it out for dessert (on the house!) I've been to my fair share of restaurants and I've never had anyone do that before. That alone rates 5 stars. I highly recommend this place, great food and excellent customer service."}
{"text":"THE WORST DINING EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE! I have no idea how this place is still open. Beware when you go with the All You Can Eat menu, because that's exactly what you will need to do to not be robbed by this place. They will bring out the cheapest meat first, in huge quantities, setting you up for failure to finish your order. Anything you cannot manage to finish will be charged. This rule is typical for AYCE, but quite difficult to follow if the food is absolute crap. It felt like they purposely make the food unappetizing so you can eat less and charge you for whatever you do not finish. We apologized and told the server that we cannot finish the kimchi pancake because it tastes horrible.... to which she replied \"you have to finish it or I will charge you and pack it for you to go.\" Not sure what makes her think I would want to take it with me to enjoy at home if we already did not want to eat it there. The soup was also very unappetizing. If you are craving Korean Barbecue, spend your money elsewhere. You will feel like you are committed to a horrible duty at this restaurant rather than having an enjoyable meal. You will leave this place pissed, over stuffed with crappy food and regret you ever stepped foot in this \"restaurant\"."}
{"text":"Their policy of only allowing you to pick your own meat after 8 plates is ridiculous. Not only were you not allowed to pick what kind of meat to have next, their services was lousy and the food wasn't that good. The boss was very rude and had a bad experience overall. Don't go there. It's not worth the price and there are better Korean BBQ restaurants in Christie. HORRIBLE!!"}
{"text":"The worst place to go for Korean BBQ ever! When I get there for all you can eat bbq, man who looked like the owner of the restaurant kept turning off the grill. He told me it is difficult to clean the grill when meats are burnt, but THE MEAT WAS NOT FULLY COOKED YET!!! Did he want me to get food poisoned or what??? I asked other waitress to turn the grill on, and she did, and the owner came back and TURNED IT OFF AGAIN!! I am not mentioning how RUDE he is! He is rude to customers, and I saw he was yelling and shouting to poor waitresses. Wow.. what a place.... I am never ever going  back to that place again. I recommend some other bbq place. This is the last one I am going for bbq."}
{"text":"They deserve LESS than 1 star. I decided to get the Korean BBQ menu with 3 other friends. After cooking some meat, our BBQ plate needed to be replaced and we pointed it out to the waitress. When we did, she said \"I know, I know\". It took maybe 30 minutes for her to give us more water. Most meats were unmarinated (e.g. wasn't richly seasoned as per their menu), all BBQ plates came ungreased making meats prone to sticking and the plate burning. She and the owner were micromanagers, that is: monitoring how you use their stove. They seem to not care at all about replenishing your water, side dishes or utensils. The cost of the above was around $27 per person - cash only - and the waitress actually counted our payment to make sure we gave a tip. They are overpriced for probably the worst service I've had so far - regardless of cuisine - in Toronto. Contrary to its name, there's nothing really \"real\" about this restaurant, other than real bad service. You're honestly much better off just ordering a bucket of chicken from KFC if you're craving meat."}
{"text":"After living in Japan for years, and visiting South Korea, I developed an intense fondness for Korean BBQ. I've tried several Korean BBQ restaurants in Toronto, and for price and quality, Bryan's is far and away the best. Their food is delicious, the waiters attentive, the atmosphere nice and cozy; a great whole package. My wife and I generally come here to splurge and do the all-you-can-eat deals. In some restaurants, this means you get sub-par meat, but at Bryan's, so far everything we've had has been great.   As some people have probably mentioned, they do require you to eat everything you GRILL, or they will charge you a hefty fee. This does not include meat you leave on the plate, though, so it hasn't been a problem for us.    Besides the all-you-can-eat, their normal food and side dishes are very good, too, so if you don't feel you can eat enough, there are many good dishes. My wife and mother particularly liked the Korean pork bone soup.  Highest recommendations!"}
{"text":"Attention was great,  but the food really bad, and the side dishes are not a big deal, On top of that they don't take credit cards or debit. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"PLEASE READ TO THE END.... AND DONT EAT HERE... I do not often Come on Yelp to make reviews.. but for here I MUST MUST MUST write one on this place.. i originally wrote one before ... but due to yelps shitty ass automated system.... they put mine and many others review under not recommend... PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASEEE.. I advise you to go read those comments before you read the recommended one( the not recommended ones are at the bottom of the page..) .... this place was complete disaster... and after reading all the comment in the \"not recommended\"....it brought me right back to the moment i sat down in that restaurant... it was completely horrible... i only put 5 stars in hoping that this would make it to the recommended section..SO THAT PEOPE CAN SEE AND BE WARE! . but who knows if this will... NEVER EVER EAT HERE ...  BAD SERVICE, BAD FOOD, SUPER CHEAP quality .. I came to eat real Korean bbq food... Instead they gave nothing of such... They gave us the cheapest dishes to grill so we would get full. I'm 5 dishes in... And still they gave us nothing of the good stuff.. Just the crappy pork and chicken... Wtf.. No samgypsal..... No bulgogi... No short rib... Just cheap. .! The dishes I had was... Marinated pork... Marinate chicken... Unmarinated cheap steak... Marinated pork... Marinated chicken... In that order..not to mention the pork and chicken was like 60%fat.... WORST part is... When everything was done and finished.. The guy stared us down for a tip.. When he realized he wasn't getting a good tip... He demanded for 10% tip... Demanded almost four times... Psh.. Like so I will.. If I wanted to eat this shit.... I would of went to Korean Grill house.. At lease their service is good."}
{"text":"CLEARLY none of these one star reviewers have been to Korea. The 'AYCE' options may be slightly deceptive, but just ask questions. Can you not ask questions? I'm asking questions right now. It's easy.  Owner Bryan is a bit of a dick, but his demeanour is 'grumpy uncle' at worst. He warrants a half star off tops.  Solid KBBQ if you're not a moron."}
{"text":"I had the most terrible experience here. Food quality was okay. But the service is beyond belief. I was cooking the meat and the owner comes to our table and rearranges the meat saying you should keep the meat near the center or something. I found it really weird of him but I said \"okay......?\" he went away. After I asked him to change the grill since this one has gotten charred from using it for long with different types of meat, he complained to me saying that was because we didn't keep the meat on the center but I'll change the grill I was thinking \"okay.......? Doesn't the grills usually become charred from use and other places just change them on their own.....?\" this was all great service in comparison. After the owner changed the grill he placed all the meat in the grill himself and said we charge for uneaten cooked meat but not for uncooked. I thought \"okay.......? Does that mean you reserve uncooked meats that went to other people's tables already?\" and I took some off the grill since he put way too much on the grill. He started saying I can't be doing that. I thought \"okay......? First he placed it in the grill...  And why would he not just give us smaller portions and multiple times.....?\" we finished the meal very unpleasantly and then came the fun part.  The kimchi pancake appetizer came after we were done the meal. We asked for the bill without much thought to that. The waiter came over saying he needs to charge us extra $2 for the leftover meat on the grill pointing at the scraps. I was incredulous but told him okay I'll just eat that last scrap that nobody wanted. He went away. Then the owner came back told me that they now had to charge us extra $7 for the kimchi pancake appetizer we didn't even touch. I said \"are you being serious?\" with disbelief. He said well yeah you didn't even touch it! I said well yes, it came well after we were done our meal. He insisted we must pay. I don't even care about the 7 bucks, but I got angry at the poor business ethic of the owner. I refused, he swore at me, I swear back, then I just paid for the bill with the extra charge and we left the restaurant. Never ever before in my life had I have such an experience at a restaurant! Amazing."}
{"text":"The worst Korean BBQ I ever had. The All-You-Can-Eat option is really really a bad choice, for that it does not have the varieties, and they would easily run out of your appetite. In addition, no real waitor seems to present there, instead just the owner and an old lady."}
{"text":"Went here for all you can eat kbbq. Meat quality is really good, good cuts of beef and nicely marinated. Side dishes were nice but nothing special (had the toppoki and kimchi soup). Overall very happy with the food.  Our server was really nice and accommodating, wait time was really reasonable and we were brought everything we asked.  Tl;dr: really good food and service, spend a bit more and come here instead of going to chain kbbq's."}
{"text":"The place is cool looking and the food is pretty good but I won't go back again.  If you're gonna check it out anyways make sure you go with good friends that you can laugh with cause I imagine Mr. Grumpy Pants could go from mildly endearing to annoying if you're not with good company. And for the love of cake and candy do not ever take a date here! Fortunately I was with good friends so when Mr. Grumpy Pants began nagging us about not moving the vent and how to grill the food we got a good giggle as soon as he walked away. Actually we spent a good chunk of the meal giggling and doing little things to annoy him lolz. I wish I hadn't used the bathroom here. They were sooooo gross and dirty and there was actually a sign telling customers not to flush toilet paper but to put it in the rubbish bin. Eeeeewwww! So gross. If they cleaned the place up, fixed the toilet and got Mr Grumpy Pants under control this place would actually be decent cause honestly the food was really not bad at all."}
{"text":"I've been there so many times and this is by far my most favourite Korean BBQ place in Toronto! The food is delicious and it's all you can eat! The staff is very attentive and nice, they always come to the table to see if we need anything. The reason I rated it a 4 star is because when you order an appetizer that's included in AYCE, they give you soooooo much. And they charge you extra if you can't finish it. It almost feels like you go there to eat Jap Chae. No, you go there to eat BBQ! But we still want some appetizer so we pick the more expensive option, I mean come on, let me taste a little bit of everything."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE! Absolutely terrible. I honestly don't understand how they are in business. It's all you can eat, however didn't allow me to pick what I wanted to eat. And if I decided to choose, I had to pay more?!"}
{"text":"Dear Bryan,  You cannot demand a tip from your customers.  There is no \"rule\" in Canada that says one must give a tip despite stale sidedishes, telling us to rush and cook everything, and your frequent price increases for things that were free just a short while ago.  No tip = unhappy customer.  Never ask for a tip again! And stop your price increases.  Seriously the prices go up every time I go there!"}
{"text":"Didn't like it. The whole place is dripping in grease burners are covered with caked on food. Forks and knives covered in caked on food. Utensils were not consistant. The water they brought to our table in an old scratched up container from the dollar store with chipped plastic and again a nasty film all over the rim. We gave them some cash for trying, but left without eating. Will never step foot in there again."}
{"text":"I have eaten at many Korean BBQ AYCE restaurants and I have to say that this one is by far my favourite.  Pro:  - good selection of meat with authentic preparation methods  - homey feel with a TV that always has the game on - additional side dishes such as AYCE soup and rice cakes or Korean pancake  Con: - coupled with the owners poor English, there are many rules that may take you by suprise -Each order consists of 3 types of meats; finish those meats, get the next. Only one order of sides (rice cake, pancake, dumplings etc)  If you take the time to ask about how they do things in this homely little Korean place it should become your favourite AYCE KBBQ place too. It should definitely be the best for the money."}
{"text":"NEVER COME HERE!!!! Dont come here, they force you to eat all the cheap meats before they serve you the good stuff (like samgyupsal). You're not allowed to not cook the meat dish you don't want to eat and then ask to receive the next one even though they say that uneaten raw meat will not be charged, only the cooked ones. They're tricky and difficult people... NEVER COME HERE!!!!"}
{"text":"I love Korean BBQ, and this place is fantastic!   Here are the reasons this restaurant is a great place for AYCE BBQ: -Delicious, delicious meat! -Great location (5 minute walk from Bathurst station) -Friendly service -Reminds of me of many restaurants in Korea; the decor is not pretentious, just homely and comfy  Went here 3 times: twice had the AYCE BBQ (once after finishing a marathon... soooo good) and once had items off their regular menu.  Full happy belly every time!"}
{"text":"THE BEST authentic Korean barbecue that's AYCE. For $20, you can really enjoy the whole Korean barbecue experience (minus Gal-bi).  When you order the AYCE barbecue, they will bring out 8 different kinds of meat in random order. You have to finish one plate in order to get next. It's like playing a video game where you have to clear Stage 1 to advance to the next stage. I was enjoying their side dishes and the soybean tofu soup so much, I was only able to finish 5 of them.  When I was there, the order was 1. Rib eye steaks, raw, not marinated (quality meat!!) 2. Thick cut pork belly. 3. Marinated Chicken (Not spicy) 4. Marinated pork, spicy. 5. Marinated beef, thinly sliced. (Bulgogi)  * There's a $40 fine if you don't finish what you put on the grill. If you can't eat it, don't put them of the grill.  Don't go to one of those Chinese owned Korean B.B.Q. AYCE and waste your money.  This place is owned and operated by Koreans.  P.S. Cute Korean male servers. lol"}
{"text":"I m gonna start off this review with my brother and mother got food poisoning from this place. The service in this place is slow, but it's  alright, the server seems nice but the way you have to order food seems surprising odd to me(it makes me feel uncomfortable). Foods are meh over all for that price, definitely not recommended."}
{"text":"A group of us went to eat at Bryan's BBQ after we discovered Joon's Restaurant was closed every second and fourth Tuesdays. There are a ton of Korean restaurants in the Bloor and Christie area but Bryan's happened to be across the street and they had an all you can eat barbeque so we decided to give it a try.  It's been a while since I've had All-You-Can-Eat (AYCE) and when I do it's normally Japanese, which tends to be pretty good with a wide of variety of food to choose from. However, we left Bryan's BBQ less than satisfied.   There are two options if you decide to have AYCE. Special #1 is available at $18.99 and with this combo you get a random assortment of meats that comprises of beef, chicken and pork. At least we know we're not getting some random meat dish.   The other option, Special #2 gives you more of a flexibility in that you can choose which meats to BBQ.  We went with Special #1, as we were not picky with what we wanted and really, how can it go wrong - we all enjoy different types of meat and don't mind surprises. However, we spoke a little too soon... eating AYCE at Bryan's BBQ had a lot of restrictions and limitations.  We felt like we were 5-years old all over again except replace the vegetables with the meat!  Here are some rules to their AYCE:   1. The restaurant dictates the order of the meat you are serviced, which is fine because we knew that ahead of time.  2. You cannot order the same meat that you just had, meaning you can't order beef again if you just had beef. You have to order the exact order of pork, chicken and then beef. If you only want beef after the first round of order, you would have to eat pork and chicken before the second helpings of beef.  3. Each meat plate is huge in portion - we started off with pork and chicken and we were told that we had to finish all the pork and chicken before the beef dish would come out. Saying that the plate of chicken was massive is probably an understatement and there was probably enough to feed at least 10 people.   We wanted the beef so we had no other option but to finish the chicken and pork. When we finally finished everything, the beef was brought out. According to the waitress, if the raw beef meats are left untouched & uncooked, we won't be charged extra... good to know...   It seems that this is the restaurant's antic to fill up diners with the chicken and pork so they don't eat as much beef...  It certainly worked because we were unable to eat it all. The beef itself, however was quite bland and tough so wasn't even really worth consuming all that chicken and pork for.  We were pretty surprised that the restaurant was full on a random Tuesday night but there is only one girl working the entire restaurant. Her service wasn't bad but she didn't have the time to attend to each table when they had requests.   I will not return to Bryan's BBQ for their All-You-Can-Eat in the future. They also offer an a la carte menu but as we didn't order from that menu, I cannot comment on the quality of those food items."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic. Great staff and service. We'll be back in a heartbeat. Huge portions for AYCE. Wear your fat pants."}
{"text":"When it comes to the quality of the meat  they service for the AYCE service, I definitely would come back for it one day. Service? No. I'm sorry, but don't turn off the frickin grill randomly when I am cooking my food. My food is not cooked enough to the way I like it. I am annoyed about the service really. But the meats were awesome. I think that is the thing that will bring me back to this place. The beef, the pork belly... yumm! I just want more salt please, and a little better customer service, then I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"DO NOT go to this restaurant. We tried AYCE and they served us stale kimchi and garlic. Meat quality was bad. My prissy friend had to spit out 2 times because of the food and kimchi were STALE. Never come back! 2nd * for staff - kinda nice"}
{"text":"Holy...I should have checked the reviews before going there. Last time I went to this place was probably 5 years ago and can't say I had a bad experience but this time it was totally the opposite. I'm probably going to repeat what many others are saying, but it's the truth. First thing , if you're only 2 people better go somewhere else! We got full after the first serving. They will bring the same size no matter if you're 2 or 20! Was it worth paying $24.99 per person? HELL NO!  For the price you get a choice of 3 meats. We ordered regular beef which was okay; then there was another beef which I'm almost certain was for stew and not BBQ(so hard to eat). On top of that there was so much of it(oh and you have to pay it if you're not done, can't get a substitute) Haha and the pork...first time the guy brought the dish it looked nothing like the picture. It was so fat! We had to return it and got another dish of the same but actually looked as it should have been. So much inconsistency! I imagine everyone is getting same treatment just to see if they can go away with it. So what do we have? Overpriced meal that's not even decent! oh yeah, the pancake was good! pretty much the only thing I could say. The owner(I assume) was too impatient, kept blaming us for doing something wrong! We had to bother them to change the freaking plates. There was nothing right with this place. Save your money and just go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"For some reason Bryan's will not serve a single person the AYCE BBQ menu.  Server is nice, but the fact I can't eat alone in peace makes this a 2 star for me."}
{"text":"Should have read the yelp reviews before going in. Learnt my lesson. We went there for dinner with the AYCE option around $26 per person.  After the first couple refills the servers were slow to check up on us. And the final meat we got tasted rubbery and was mostly bones. I felt a bit sick that night after eating.  Also the dumplings we ordered took about 45 mins to arrive to the table.  This is my 2nd time going here. There will not be a third visit to Bryan's from myself at least."}
{"text":"Not a true all you can eat. For the premium menu you get to pick 3 meats which are super sized. Not allowed to order more meat until you finish it all. You can't even get a small portion of everything of your choice like at other Korean BBQ. Its more like eat 3 big orders of meat not all you cab eat."}
{"text":"It's very frustrating when you have the waiter forget about what you order ALL THE TIME!! (Seriously, I have to remind him everytime when I order anything) And they make you wait and wait and wait to get your meat, lettuce, sauce or side dishes. The worst thing is, they try to make you full by giving you a lot of chicken, and say you can't waste any meat.  And if you want to take advantage of the lunch price, think again! Because they charge for each additional bowl of lettuce. Seriously?? My lunch actually ended up more expensive than the dinner price.  Food-wise, things are alright. It's not bad, but nothing really special.  So if you are really picky about services, Bryan's BBQ isn't the right place."}
{"text":"Must avoid. As soon as we walked in, we regretted it. No server was on site. Just the owner and the kitchen lady. There was no customers, but a table was full of dirty dishes and wasn't cleared until we were done. We ordered short ribs, but the owner said they weren't fresh today. That should have been the sign to get the hell out of there, but we were hungry... Meats were cut too thick, resulting in longer cooking time. When we ordered a second round, the owner seemed annoyed and kept emphasizing he would have to charge us if we didn't eat everything.   All in all, horrible dining experience. Avoid at all cost.  This place definitely does not provide \"solid KBBQ\"."}
{"text":"TLDR: Just stay away from this place, service is non-existent.  My fiancé and I walked into this place after a last min decision to go get some BBQ while driving through Korean Town. Usually we look at reviews, but we didn't this time because we walked in on a whim. Worst mistake ever.  I'll start at the beginning. We got seated and looked at the menu. It was explained to us that the cheaper of the two options they have, means that we get \"random\" dishes sent to us every \"round\". We didn't like the sound of that, so we opted for the more expensive option. In hind sight, we probably would have been better off with random, because I'm not even sure we got the dishes we ordered anyway.  We ordered the short ribs, marinated pork, Bolgogi seafood tofu soup and kimchi pancake. After about 10-15 mins, we finally received the short ribs... Which we devoured in pretty short order as we were pretty hungry. Then we waited and waited and waited, then after many attempts to get the servers attention, one of the girls finally came over. We enquired about where our other dishes were and got some very confused looks. We had to reiterate what we ordered again and requested some rice too. The we waited again. Eventually the pork arrived. Just the pork. No soup or pancake in sight. So we asked about that again and the rice. \"Oh you want rice?\".  So we eventually get our rice and soup. Still no pancake. So I enquire about that again, to even more confused looks. We finally get the pancake as we're finishing off the pork, no sign of the bolgogi. So we ask about that, \"Oh it's coming right now\". What a lie. We finished off the pork and then the pancake and then we waited what was easily 15-20mins, before I finally managed to get someones attention to enquire where the god damn bolgogi was.   We eventually get it and order some pork belly as we get the dish, cause this was apparently the end of \"round 1\" and from \"round 2\" onwards, we're only allowed one dish at a time. I'm sorry, if \"round 2\" onwards is one dish at a time, what did we just experience in \"round 1\". Mean while, other people are being seated and served all their \"round 1\" dishes in quick order.  I would have been better off just getting the food myself."}
{"text":"**BEWARE**  This place is the craziest dinning experience you will ever have. If you are a risk taker for dining, then this is the place for you.  You choose 3/8 meat selections. You finish everything you order before the next order can go in.  I ordered the sirloin steak assuming it would be like every other place and have sliced meat cut in small pieces. Instead, they legitimately give you whole steaks cut from the rump. Lol. Literally a bunch of crappy 8-10oz steaks. I literally laughed when that came out because there is no way you are eating much after.  If you leave food, you are paying per oz/gram. I can't remember the amount, but you are incentivized to take the left overs and flush it down the toilet rather than let them charge you for that junk meat.  This place should not be in business. The owner is cheap as chips and operates with the mentality of trying to make the customer lose. Rather, most successful businesses leave you feeling satisfied with the food quality or happy getting what you paid for.  You will feel neither leaving this place."}
{"text":"Random walk-in around 10pm on a Saturday night.  The strange AYCE rules others posted about are alive and well, so were the OCD behaviour of the owner.  Both are both as comical, annoying, and irrational as others have noted.    We had the steak, pork belly, and chicken.  Meats were not good quality - steak was extremely chewy, and the pork belly had zero flavour; chicken was decent.  One of my DCs informed me that in traditional Korean BBQ certain meats are served not marinated (neither the steak nor PB were marinated)...fine, but pork belly, even without marinade, should have flavour (fat IS flavour baby!), but it was literally tasteless; I stress this, not bland, but actually tasteless.  The steak was chewy to the point of not being edible - granted we did overcook it a bit, but it shouldn't have rendered the meat inedible.  For the sides we ordered the soon tofu soup and seafood pancake, as well as a pork bone soup a la carte.  All of these were good, albeit the soups a bit on the salty side.    We also ran into the extra charges for \"wasted food\".  We argued that what we left cooked but uneaten was not edible, either it was like eating rubber or had no taste - we were not out to waste food; we didn't even cook all of the raw meats and didn't order second round.  While arguing with him over why he should not be charging us for the \"waste\", the owner indicated that uncooked is not charged while cooked is.  At this point I pointed out to him that once that food has been delivered to our table, the health code precludes him from serving it again to other customers, even if it had not been touched at tall. Asked him what he's going to do with the rest of the raw meats, and he said don't worry about it, I'll eat it myself.  Wanted to point this out as the waste food policy seems to suggest that he may be reusing meats already served to prior customers.  Could be unrelated, but at least two of us had stomachaches less than 30 minutes after leaving the restaurant.    Don't bother coming here.  And if you still want to give it a try, do NOT go for the BBQ, AYCE or not."}
{"text":"The WORST OF WORST place ever  When I went there, a waiter was not kind and i was not sure the meat was fresh. Anyway i do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Folks, finally... Great Korean bbq at Great price. I'll walk you through some of rules and regulation of this place. you will get 8 different kinds of meat. 2 dishes will be served at each time and next dish will not be served if it's not finished. Dishes will be served in random orders. $40.00 of fine will be charged if cooked meat is not finished.  Their AYCE course comes with those meat, bowl of soybean tofu soup and unlimited steamed rice. All for 18.99, it's a steal!!  Attentive staff, Decent food. For the price, quality of meat was superb. Awesome place to be if you want to shove your face in to Korean barbecue. LOVE IT!!"}
{"text":"Ate here with a couple of my friends not too long ago on a Friday night and turns out they were actually getting ready to close. Their store hours on Google did not actually reflect the store hours posted at the restaurant so customers will need to beware of that.   The food on the other hand was great. It's disappointing that you are required to order at least 3 different types of meats and can't just order one kind, however the meat was delicious. The waitress was extremely friendly and helpful. She would constantly come over to our table and would help us to refill our side dishes and even helped us to cook our meat. She cooked it to perfection and my friends and I absolutely loved the experience.   When the people around me ask me to recommend a Korean BBQ place to them I would always recommend Bryan's as my first choice for an authentic experience."}
{"text":"This is the worst place I have ever been to, especially the customer service. I went there and I lost my appetite when he was putting the food on the grill so when I went to tell him I don't want all you can eat and just charge me for what I had and they refused. The way he was speaking was so rude and when I told him I wanted to speak to the manager he turns around and he said he was the manager. Are you kidding me? You were very rude from the beginning and you are claiming you are the manager? So I told him I want to speak to the owner and all of the sudden the owner went to get something and if I wanted to wait for him, meanwhile it was a she and I could hear them talk to her in the background. So I told him I will wait. So am waiting..and waiting......so he comes back and he charges me anyways. Are you kidding me? This is the worse service ever and PLEASE DO NOT go to this place because everything is bad. From the customer service to the place and everything that comes with it. I have been a waitress for 14 years and I love going to Koreans BBQ places but this had to be the worst in the world. How can you say your the manager and treat your customers like this? And by the way it's CASH ONLY, I wonder why. If you like Korean BBQ go to the one on Beaver Creek and highway 7, it's the one place where I know I will like the food and customer service is ok."}
{"text":"Best way to describe this place is, eating at someone's house and feeling really uncomfortable because the host is overbearingly micromanaging. I felt like a child again, being told what not to do with their stove and how we should be cooking the meat. For instance, the waitress told us that the grill pan tends to burn faster if we have it heated on, with no meat cooking on it. Or how we MUST keep all the meat directly below the vacuum vent and turn the stove off if we're done cooking the meat.   She literally came over to our table every 5 minutes, repositioning the vacuum vent in the same place, turning off our stove when our meat wasn't done cooking, and lowering the heat when the meat clearly needed more time to cook.   What a shame too, because the food itself is really good. But I would never come back here. I wonder which started first; the micromanagement or bad business, because I cant imagine why anyone would be so overcontrolling unless their business is going bad and they're trying to save money on every single thing.   See ya never, Bryan!"}
{"text":"Not a bad Korean BBQ. For the most part the food was pretty standard for the price and quantity. Service was more than I expected. When I appeared hesitant about how to start cooking the meats the wait staff assisted and continued to do so when needed, which was very helpful when (neck deep in conversation) I could've burned something. I suggest trying any of the meats that say \"spicy\" or \"marinated\" because if not it is rather bland. And rice is not complimentary. Be sure to order it if you'd like it."}
{"text":"CRAP! CRAP! CRAP!  -the side dishes are absolutely atrocious. If you go to any decent Korean restaurant, you'll realize how bad it is here. The japchae (glass noodles) was bland and stale, and the kimchi wasn't fresh. Not much variety either.  -terrible service--I was with Koreans and they (owner and waiter) focused on the other guests. I know why--they knew the Koreans wouldn't return knowing how bad the food is.   -the meat is OK, but don't even bother with the samgyeopsal. Prices are average and portions were actually quite small.  -you can't get excellent BBQ on Christie, but I suggest Korean Village instead. Although  a bit pricier, it's better in every way: side dishes, taste, and service."}
{"text":"If I could give it negative stars I would.   Bryan is incredibly rude to his staff there, also incredibly rude to customers.   Things that come with AYCE at all other Korean BBQ restaurants that doesn't come with your meal at Bryan's: - Lettuce - Extra sauces  - Refill of side dishes - rice - soup - the ability to cook your own food and eat at your own pace and choose your meats - reasonable service   My friends and I have been to a lot of Korean BBQ places this place has been by far the worst, watching him cuss in Korean at his servers and going around yelling at customers for things they would do in any other KBBQ restaurant.  Just no. Do yourself the favour."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner last night, been here couple of times. Remember the first time being here, the set up looks like the restaurants that I used to go often during my childhood. We Ordered the AYCE bbq that you don't get to choose which meat, we couldn't get pass the third dish unfortunately.. Second time as well.  Last night was the third time there, ordered the one that you get to choose which meat comes first and it comes with appetizers and soup. We were able to eat ALOT this time. Honestly, the meats were only okay, all the soup choices were very salty (you can get more than one but you have to finish one first, same as the meat), appetizers we got kimchi pancake, very average.  The only best thing about it was their vent system and they cook it for you."}
{"text":"Banchan (side dishes) are tasteless and very scarce. Prices are steep for such a run downed looking place. Pay for rice? Are you for real? Not impressed. This is not a place for Koreans to go to, it may be acceptable and praised by non-Koreans but this is far from a true Korean BBQ. They don't give u the true fillers that you should get for your BBQ! Tsk tsk! You should be ashamed to call yourselves real Korean. If I could give this place 0 stars I would."}
{"text":"How have people given this place 5 stars? I may not be Korean but I'm married to one, all my friends are Korean, I've been to Korea and I know what real Korean tastes like. It's not this place!  It looks like a true Korean BBQ from the outside but far from it when it come to service, quality, quantity and taste onto inside.  Ban chan is horrific. Selection? There is no selection and the quality and taste just makes you want to spew!  I didn't do AYCE, I went for BBQ at $12.99. The pork belly was rubbery and tasteless.  The quantity of meat given was pathetic.  What a minute, this is supposed to be Korean BBQ? Where's my rice? Oh wait, you have to pay for it. Absolutely ludicrous. Where's the marinated thinly sliced green onions to go with the wrap? No mushrooms? Really? Chunks of onions, instead of serving it in thinly sliced rings?   People that think they know Korean BBQ truly don't if they rated this place more than 1 star. I'm begging you all! Please do not support this place, they do not deserve any recognition, hype or praise.  There are so many better places for Korean BBQ that are \"real Korean\".  This place my be run by Koreans but they might as well be Korean Grill Time (most fake Korean  BBQ out there) are owned and run by Chinese."}
{"text":"This place was great!!  I lived in Korea for a couple years and it's the most authentic I've been to. Every thing is the same right down to the owner coming up and telling you if you're not doing it right. I understand the negative reviews but that's just the culture over there. To him he's just being helpful. I'd definitely recommend this place for the real Korean BBQ experience.  And for those who don't know what the lettuce is for, it's to wrap the meet and sides with rice. You don't eat everything separately."}
{"text":"My friend and I walked it craving a korean bbq. First it smelled like fish inside an there were plates on the table next to us, probably the staff's dinner. They could have taken it away right away...  The menu is very confusing as to what you can and mostly what you can't have. We took the $25 AYCE special because the special #1 didn't include appetizers and other stuff. So you can order 3 types of meat (for the two people), not 3 types each and small portions no no! Same you can pick one appetizer for 2.   Food came in a very random order. One soup and then oh a bit of meat, after 20min here is the rice (we asked for it). We had 3 huge piles of meat. Meat was marinated and good but not thinly chopped at all. The opposite. I don't know if it's how it's supposed to be for korean bbq but I did not like that. The only veggie we had was lettuce and there were no sauces. Makes it even harder to finish all that meat...  I feel like it's AYCE but they just try to stuff you with meat. I would like smaller portions of meat but a wider variety. As for the taste of the food itself, it was ok i guess.  Server was nice at least.  My biggest issue with this place is that it looks very unsanitary. Will not come back.  Also, they only take cash. There is an ATM in the restaurant with a $1.50 fee"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. Food 8\10 Service (young waiter) 9\10 Boss 1\10  The food was good, meat was fresh and tasty. There are a lot of rules so gotta be careful which ayce you choose. There is the $18.99 one and $24.99.  I had the $18.99 ayce and there is no control which meat comes first. They have 8 different types of meat for this ayce set but comes out in \"random\" orders. Only 1 type of meat each time you order and you gotta finish it before starting another meat order. Wow was the portion huge! Obviously they won't give you beef at the beginning. We finished 4 types of meat (chicken and pork) and no beef in sight. Huge scam, random my buttocks.  What's worst was their service particularly (only) the boss's service. He did not understand English that well and his attitude was the worst. He kept repeating himself over and over how you gotta finish your meat first before you can order. He was a total control freak over the way we cooked our food. We were just moving the vent a liytle bit and he came over to tell us we shouldn't touch it. He was really annoying and was getting on my nerves. Never had such a terrible dining experience. This is not how you do business. Can't even enjoy my meal.  The younger waiter on the other hand was very nice and helpful. He got us everything we asked and was very attentive even though he was the only waiter (with his boss).  Also, we kept facing problems with our grill turning off and not able to turn it back on. He actually had to change the grill  Never coming back again unless the boss is gone. He totally ruined the dining experience."}
{"text":"This restaurant claims that it is all you can eat. The servers who do not speak English well advertised this when we came in. The server told us that you can only order Kalbi - a beef short rib on their menu once and you can only order 3 items per round. When our second round came around we were not able to order Kalbi again. This is extremely disappointing because this is the only item I wanted to eat. It is safe to say that they are NOT \"All You Can Eat\" and that I will NEVER return. Their customer service was terrible."}
{"text":"Came here the other night when business was slow. Ordered the Ayce option, we ordered the pork belly, chicken and beef. Pork belly was more on the fatty side, but i didnt mind that. The waitress came to cook the meat for us and came back to check up on us from time to time. She made conversation with us and was generally really nice and kind. The soup was a bit too salty but still edible.  I do not think Bryan's deserve this low rating, i came back another time when it was more busy and service was slower, but it wasn't absolute shit like how most people complain about it here. They put restrictions on how much you can order depending on how many people you show up with in order to not waste food. The servers still got their job done with a nice tone and food showed up in a timely manner. Will 100% come back, price is fair, food is edible and servers are kind."}
{"text":"Service was super weird. The staff were extremely protective of the grill. The fire on the grill kept going out so we would turn it back on and a bit higher but the staff would literally rush over to turn the fire down, and a minute later the flame would go out again. The staff also kept turning off our heat when the meat (including pork) was still uncooked. This repeated for at least 3 times until we got annoyed and told them we wanted our meat cooked on higher heat. Even then, they still wouldn't really let us do our own grilling AT ALL. They watched us like a hawk and every time we tried to use our grilling tongs they would rush over immediately and take over. The first time I took it as attentive service, but after everything that had happened it was just too much. The meat also does not look fresh at all, with weird colouring. The lettuce was not washed clean. The this-is-ridiculous point for me was when they served us pork even though we ordered beef, and they insisted that it was beef when it was clearly pork. When our real beef came, it tasted so bad we couldn't stomach it. (We probably weren't even in the mood to eat anything else at that point). The server wouldn't give us the bill and wanted to charge us for not finishing the food even when we told him that the food tasted bad. He was \"nice\" enough to offer us to go containers for a fee and also said that we don't have to finish the \"beef\", but had to finish everything else. Will not come back again ever. Lesson learned - ALWAYS consult Yelp before going to a restaurant I've never been to."}
{"text":"It was freezing night when we were walking along Christie and Bathurst and we don't have idea where else to eat. My phone was depleted and never had the chance to check it on Yelp. So we were just choosing random restaurant and ended up here when we saw it was an all-you-can eat korean grill-like restaurant.  It wasn't a bad looking place in a Korea town. Place was decent, well lit and waitress was nice. Unfortunately, this is not the best place if you feel like having a korean bbq! The meat were not that fresh, the pork had lots of fats, the chicken didn't look good  and the beef was plain and no marinate! The pork and chicken were not marinated well and the beef wasn't marinated at all. The place is actually pricy. Next time, I will just stick to Korean grill restaurant."}
{"text":"The food here is alright, but the overall experience wasn't the best. Like others have mentioned, the service was pretty terrible. The owner was there and he pretty much came over to yell at us a few times for various reasons.  First of all, it's not true AYCE. Basically they only let you order certain items for certain amounts of people. For example, we only had 3 people at our table so they wouldn't let us order the noodles. Okay - whatever. Also, they don't let you order a new item until all of the items on your table are finished. They gave us one bowl of soup and told us we had to finish it first before we got our second bowl. I get it.. wasting food is not cool. But I don't feel like we should be treated that way either.   So, we were allowed to order 3 raw meats to cook. They staggered the meats to come out one by one so by the time we finished cooking the beef - which was quite quickly since we don't like to eat it well done.. the stove was left on and beginning to char. The server did not tell us we should turn off the stove, but I guess it is common sense to? But where was our second plate of meat? Well the owner wasted no time to come over and turn off our stove and yell at us and tell us we should be turning off the stove when we're done with it. Ok. Fine.   Then, the next plate of meat comes out. Pork belly. Which is 99% fat. And well, I guess you can guess what happened next. A grease fire. the stupid vent they have hovering over the stove wasn't good enough. And then you know what happened next. The owner came over to yell at us again. Opened the door and told us not to touch the vent.  At this point, we just wanted to finish what we had and get out of there. Definitely only walked in here because the place we wanted to go to was packed. And definitely won't come back here."}
{"text":"It was good, no real complaints.  The meat was well flavoured and seasoned and the service was prompt and careful. But the atmosphere and decor were super dingy.  I would maybe come back if I'm in the area, but it wasn't really my kinda place."}
{"text":"How do you say YUMMY in Korean? Not much more to say really...we were a party of three and ordered the all you can eat BBQ and was completely satisfied!! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great Quality Tasting Meats! And super fast service! The staff were friendly and attentive and so many sides and options ! The portions were huge too!! Deff for a group of 3/4!"}
{"text":"0/5 if I could!!!!!!!! Worst experience of my life. We had the special #2 ayce, but it is NOT AT ALL,  all you can eat. The servers, although nice and attentive, will start to get on your nerves when they start turning off the grill while you are still cooking (to save gas?). I came with a group of 7 and we're given two tables to sit next to each other. Side dishes and appetizers come in huge portions and you thus likely won't get a chance to try a bit of everything. Kept arguing with us that we needed to finish the gigantic piles of meat (they bring it out one dish at a time, but three the first time), before we can order another dish. You can order kalbi only once, as they are \"expensive\" . Owner is completely insane and obnoxiously rude to us. They would not allow our table to share anything, even though we are all paying the same price. Kept reminding us that we will be charged for leftover cooked foods. At the end, they added 10% service charge. Rules are ridiculous, management a horror, and the establishment is absolutely disgusting. Save your time and money and DO NOT come here."}
{"text":"Tried this place with some friends after a long night out at the bar... and then after hitting up a karaoke joint across the street... so, it was likely 4am or so.   Decent looking place. The pot of tea they gave us was lukewarm. Blech! I ordered the Bulgogi Bibimbop and enjoyed it. My friends ordered the Beef Dumplings and they were weirdly shiny and tasteless. They also ordered Chicken Soup and said it was \"just ok\". The sides were decent - nice and spicy.   This place is cash only. They have an ATM but it doesn't work. The man serving us was nice enough, but to hear him hacking back a loogie in the back was definitely an appetite killer. He also sat and played video games on his laptop a few tables away from us. It was 4am so whatever, but maybe turn the sound off?"}
{"text":"This place is a ridiculous rule on food DO NOT GO THERE, or you will regret my first time try also my last.the price are expensive CASH ONLY f...king scam ."}
{"text":"Hm, so what can I say about Bryan's Korean BBQ. Not the worst Korean I've ever had (although I haven't really had bad Korean) but definitely not the best. Mediocre at best would probably be a fair enough description.   My friend and I came here after a late night out at JFL so we wanted a bite to eat before calling it a night. We stopped at Bryan's as they were still open (2:30am, this is why you've grown on me Toronto). Then again, Korean bbq at 2:30am is probably not the best time to go. Haha.   Oh well, that's what I'm basing my review on. We each ordered meat (kolbi for my friend and pork for me). Think it was about $15-17 each. We were greeted with the saddest variety of banchan dishes I have ever seen. Think there were 4-5 dishes (kimchi, bean sprouts, ginger, salt, and one other thing. Seriously, we were not impressed.  Anyways, sad thing is this is still better than anything out west but for Toronto standards, not worth going to in my opinion."}
{"text":"I feel like I'm being generous by giving this place one star.  As you can see from my reviews, I rarely ever give a \"1 star rating\" to any place and when I do, it's usually for one single reason: horrible customer service.  And this place lived up to it too.   My boyfriend and I decided to go on a Sunday night.  The place itself was pretty well-lit but was definitely run down and seen better days.  It was a husband & wife operation (with chef(s) at the back).    1. $19.99 vs $24.99 The first mistake we made was to go for the $24.99 option where you got soup as well as dumplings (steamed/fried)/rice cakes/lettuce/grilled vegetables/kimchi cake.  If you had a table of 4 or more, you had the option of jap chae as well.    DON'T GO FOR THE $24.99 option.  SO not worth it.  The soup was SO disgustingly salty, I thought I was going to suffer from dehydration.  When we told her to remake it, the woman brought back an equally salty soup.    They also pile a bunch of chicken for you because it's the cheapest meat.  Their intention is such that you'll be so full that you won't be able to order the other meats afterwards.    The $19.99 option provides you mostly with just the meats - I say just go for that if you're even going to step foot in this restaurant.   2. Stingy on resources I had accidentally touched raw meat with my chopsticks and asked for another pair.  I pretty much had to get down on my knees and beg for another pair b/c the man was so reluctant to give them to me.  I finally told him I just dropped them on the floor and he finally gave me a new pair.    3. CRAZY Micromanagement  I could have sworn this man checked on how we cooked our meat every 5 minutes.  The first few times, it was tolerable.  After that, it became unbearable.  He wouldn't let us cook it at intense heat (to prevent meats from drying) and pretty much made us cook them at low heat, thus drying all our meats, making them taste even less desirable.  He also kept shutting our gas off.    His constant micromanagement caused serious indigestion.  And if that was his strategy in getting his guests to eat less, he won.    Oh, and because I didn't want to chew the meat around the bones of the kalbi, my boyfriend & I were given some serious hell about how we're wasting food.  I then flat out told him that I recently had oral surgery, at which point, he just kind of avoided any sort of eye contact and kept saying the same thing about how I should eat the meat around the bones.  I then told him AGAIN that I couldn't do that.  And he just finally left.    4. Meat quality & marinating  I don't know where they get their meat but someone needs to investigate these farms because the meat was as tough as leather.  The meats also lacked any flavour, especially the steak.    **OVERALL** I agree with other Yelpers here.  HORRIBLE customer service and seriously STINGY!!!!!!!!!  I don't understand why these Louis Vuitton owning bosses (look at their LV bags at the back of the shop) would be SO stingy and offer an AYCE service AND be so rude at the same time.    Word of advice to these owners: save the micromanaging for your own spawn, forget the AYCE service if you're going to be so cheap, and oh, read your reviews because in case you're wondering why you're so empty, it's because you're epically rude."}
{"text":"We came here after not wanting to get super expensive food at the Korean Village restaurant. I have a mixed feeling about this place.   The good: The service was good. Our male server was friendly and he kept up with our orders. Explained everything nicely to us because the bbq all-you-can-eat style is quite different at this place compared to the average all-you-can-eat. We didn't find this style a huge problem as other yelpers did, but it was probably because we got the $24.99 instead of $18.99 set. The kimchi pancake and soon-tofu was above average out of everything else.   The bad: The meat were just bad. They weren't very marinated. Even mixed with the vegetables, sauce, and garlic, it still tasted plain. The only good tasting meat were the chickens that we ordered. The steak and pork belly were very plain. Steak was also terribly hard to eat considering how hard and tasteless it is. It was like chewing on something weird.   Another bad thing i want to mention is the way the bill is set up: they include their own tip in the bill. Personally, I just find that terribly rude. Its almost like they expect not to be tipped from their service (which weren't bad for us). Or they didn't get tipped countless other times and needed people to actually tip for the servers... Either way, its rude.  Probably wouldn't come back here again. The bad outweighs the good. Think there are better AYCE bbq with a similar price with better food.  Tips: - Ask about the difference between the two types of AYCE korean BBQ - The kimchi pancake is very filling!  - Tips are included in your final bill"}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE!  Brutal. Absolutely brutal. The owner is a food nazi with ridiculous rules. First off what kind of all you can eat provides 8 options but you are only allowed to order 3 at a time?  What's more, you are not allowed to order any more until you finish all three you order and then you may only order another 3. Better yet they give you huge amounts of the cheap stuff and only a little bit of the expensive stuff that of course comes 10 mins later.   Want to be a even more impressed?  How about how they load the cheap meat all on to the grill so that u have to finish ALL of one thing before you can eat another?  Or how they turn off your grill when they say your food is done. And how they basically offend you and imply you are stupid for overcooking when they are really just being cheap on their gas.   Let's continue by also saying that your leftovers no matter how few will be weighed and charged at a rate of $5/100g if you have any leftover. I had about 2 oz left and he demanded I finish or he would charge me. Does saving that small bit help you more than losing a customer's repeat business?  How about pissing a customer off so much that he and his gf are now actively telling anyone who listens about your ridiculous \"AYCE\"?  This place is one of the worst experiences in the food industry available on the planet.   Btw the pork belly is ok and so is the bulgogi. Kalbi was garbage. But of course you need to eat through mountains of the the first two in order to get 4 strips of the garbage but more expensive Kalbi. Only to be forced to order 3 more different types of things in order to get the one you want.   The world is a worse place with Bryan's BBQ in it. Do yourself a favour and leave if you are there. You'll be happier if you kicked yourself in the nuts and squeezed lemon juice in your eyes."}
{"text":"We came here for the AYCE. It's true that there are a few rules that other AYCE places do not implement but if you can get past that, it's a decent place to eat and the overall score does not reflect this restaurant quality.  I heard about Bryan's through my Korean friends, after taking a look at the Yelp page, it was hard to get a group to come as they were wary of the 2* average. People mainly complain about the 3 meat/round rule and the service.   3 meat/round rule did not bother us as it takes time to cook the meat and it is the same way as Jang Won- must finish before next order.   Service wasn't spectacular but it wasn't poor. The girl tried her best to get everything we needed with a smile - although there were some communication errors, we assumed English was not her first language.   The quality of food was pretty good. We got mainly samgyapsal (pretty much Korean bacon) and it was good. The place was tidy and they refilled all our side dishes and replaced our grill without having to ask. Keep in mind that you can only order Kalbi once but all the other meats are unlimited.   Overall I don't think Bryan's deserves the low rating. I really enjoyed the suction tubes that cleared away the smoke and that the meat cooked pretty fast and the servers did not come by to turn down the grill. We used to always go to Jang Won but since they started doing that, our meal would run for 2hrs+ and was not as enjoyable.   Would recommend this place and would come back again for AYCE kbbq."}
{"text":"Judging by the buffet-loving crowd on a weeknight, Bryan's BBQ Real Korean seemed like it was worth a try.   This place is CASH ONLY. There's a minimum of 2 BBQ orders to use the grill-your-own BBQ, so no table BBQ for 1 person only.   Their BBQ buffet options include side dishes like seafood pancake, kimchi pancake, soybean tofu soup or dumplings. There's a strict \"no waste\" policy for buffet customers, they will weigh your leftovers and charge you accordingly. Or if buffet's not your thing, you can order individual entrées.   I tried the LA Kalbi to grill at the table. Though it was not the world's best Kalbi, it was still tasty. The final redeeming quality of this restaurant was the friendly and attentive service."}
{"text":"One server on Sunday night is a bad idea, who is really nice and doing his best.   Mean owner who insisted on us paying more tips, in addition to yelling at the poor server. Outright robbery.   Cash only. It's 2015.   Let alone the strict rules you have to follow for the \"buffet\" price you pay.   Amazing how greed can drive people to such indecency."}
{"text":"Very confusing in ordering - but this place isn't as bad as some of the reviews have made it out to be. The food is good, the time is fun. The ordering is a little too complex for an all you can eat."}
{"text":"Absolutely hate this place?too many rules?it seems like eat in a prison?One of the female waiters is so so rude...this is the ?first time? and ?last time? to eat in this BBQ restaurant?"}
{"text":"How is this place still open? If you're even thinking about going here, DONT. If you're there right now, RUN. It's even more embarrassing that its run by Korean people and in Korea Town."}
{"text":"The food is coming fast (because u have to cook it urself) however,there's one waiter who is severing the whole restaurant."}
{"text":"Why, why are you not open today even though your business hour said you are open........"}
{"text":"All you can eat..8 different dishes of meat BUT COMES IN RANDOM ORDER.  So what you actually get is: cheapest cheapest meat, cheapest meat, cheap meat, cheap meat.....by the time you get full you still don't get the quality meat you wanted..and you have to pay extra for what you didn't finish.  They would take back the uncooked meat and it makes me wonder if they just serve it to the next customers who comes in.    Shit customer service.  The guy would just throw all of the meat on the grill without asking us, then kept on coming over to our table demanding how we should cook the meat, and kept on turning off the grill when the meat wasn't even fully cooked.    Im usually a very generous tipper, however I was never ever demanded by anyone of how much I should tip.  I was not at all satisfied with the meat (pork, chicken, spicy pork, then spicy chicken.....where is my bulgogi? Where is my samgypsal? Where is the meat I was coming for?) nor was I satisfied with the customer service.  And even so I was still going to give a 10% tip.  However just as I was about to leave, the guy came to my table and demanded for tips.  I ignored him at first (cuz I got super pissed) then he raised his voice and demanded more.  So I took the tip money off the table and left (I know....bitch move).  He then turned to my boyfriend and demanded for tips (lol my bf give him a toonie)   DO NOT COME HERE!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"So my friend just moved in from Vancouver 2 weeks ago.  I wanted to show him around Toronto and bring him to a bunch of restaurants.   I have to admit that walking by Bryan's BBQ had me a tad worried  at first.  It was around 8pm at night and the place looked empty and small. We almost passed the place but something inside me just decided to give it a go.  Good thing too because I would have missed out on some great food!  I do confess that at first, ordering was confusing, but the guy that was working there explained how everything worked in their restaurant.  It wasn't like other table top korean bbq places in Toronto where you point at different things in the menu and they bring everything out.  Here, you choose 3 main things from their list... and trust me, it was WAY more than enough.  My faves were the bulgogi and the sliced ribs.  They were marinated amazingly!  Oh, at the end of the meal, we were so amazed and full that we forgot a bag with our groceries in it :P Came back 4 days later and they were kind enough to hold it for us!   Will definitely recommend the place and will obviously be coming back here again!"}
{"text":"Two stars seem about right for Bryan's BBQ. The side dishes are forgettable, the meat is decent quality, but the place needs some work. As we were eating, some big black blob fell from inside the vent onto our grill. Yuck. We guessed it was the grease build up but still, not good at all. My friends came here because they wanted to try all the meat (they have some weird rules) and it became a game for gluttony, trying to eat everything to eat all the meat. I didn't experience the horrible service that many people rant about here though, must've been a good day."}
{"text":"Right off the bat, Bryan is an AYCE place. Meat quality is meh, average at best. But for $25/person, you'd expect better.     We were looking for a homey style joint so this definitely was it. With the pleasantries out of the way... here comes the nightmare:     Their serving style (per their claims, \"the REAL Korean way\") and other rule restrictions border them on being Nazis.    I'm all for not wasting food and we should order what we can consume, and like most places, if you over order, they will fine the crap out of you for unfinished plates -- very fair.     At Bryan's, they take this concept to the next level. You can order 3 plates of meat to start (which is BS, because they serve you ONE PLATE at a time, and forget what else you had ordered and you end up having to reorder anyways).    So for my party of 4, we were forced to eat one order of meat at one time. When we asked for the missing plates, we were told we WILL NOT be served our next meat until we finish what's on the table. Are you serious? We wee being handled and treated like kindergarten kids here?    Next is their OPTIONAL side plates, like soup, japchae, dumplings, etc. We were first served soup (which only one of us wanted). We followed up with the server about our missing japchae... Her rely was \"not ready yet\". So we waited, but 2 seconds later the next table got theirs. We asked again 15 minutes later about our missing dish, her answer became \"you haven't finished your soup and we won't serve you noodles until you are done your soup\". I explained to her that the soup is for one person while the noodles was for the rest of us. Why do we have to wait for her to finish her soup (which she did later) before we could be fed. She then changed her answer to... \"not ready yet\". That's when I lost it and TOLD her to \"get me my noodles NOW because the next table had been served TWICE already and I am not waiting for soup to be done by dinner else before I can eat my noodles. Do not LIE to me about ready nor not\". She reluctantly, brought us our noodles. ...same with the pancakes btw.    Next, their grill was not seasoned... so when we tried cooking meat, it got stuck on and burnt really quickly. I asked if we could have a bit of oil to season the grill, that was a TWO ASK effort as the first time I was greeted with a blank stare. Such a simple request, such a complicated effort.    Lastly... this one killed the deal. In the bowl of rice, there was a large piece of broken ceramics in it. In a Korean restaurant, where rice is served in metal bowls, where did this broken piece of SHARP object come from? Nor does it really matter, sharp piece of object mixed in food (same color as the food being consumed?) WTF!     To conclude, STUPID ASS service rules, DANGEROUSly contaminated rice... There are plenty of choices at the price level for much better experience and safer conditions."}
{"text":"This is hands down one of the worst restaurants I've ever had the misfortune of dining at in my lifetime. I came here with my friend who wanted to eat at an all-you-can-eat Korean barbecue restaurant. We came here on a whim without checking reviews first as we were walking around Korea town. Big mistake! We decided to order option 2, which includes an all-you-can-eat portion of your choice of 3 meats, a choice of soup, and a choice of appetizer for $24.95. We ordered the steak, chicken, and bulgogi. We were told that we each had to order the same soup and appetizer. The first thing to come out was the chicken and steak, as well as the sides. The steak plate was 4 pieces of a very cheap cut. The chicken plate was piled high with with pieces of nothing but dark meat. All of the chicken pieces were very fatty and it looked very unappetizing. The steak was completely unseasoned, absolutely no flavor at all, just cheap beef. The chicken was only picked at because of all of the fat.  We had to keep asking for our appetizers and our bulgogi. The bulgogi came out next. We cooked it and tasted it. It smelled and tasted as though it was spoiled. We told the waitress. She took it back to the kitchen, but returned a short time later to tell us that the meat was fresh and that it's supposed to taste like that. By this time, we STILL had not received our soup or dumpling appetizer. We had to ask for our apps a total of 4 times. We also had to ask for white rice. The soup finally came out...in one bowl. My friend and I were expected to eat soup from the same small bowl! The dumplings came out a short time later. We each took one bite of them and we were done. The filling was disgusting and the dumplings themselves were stale. It tasted as though the outsides had dried out before they were cooked. We finally told the waitress we were done and asked for the check. She saw all of the uncooked meat left and told us there would be an extra charge since we didn't eat it all. We told her that reason it was uneaten was because the food was absolutely horrible. She did not push the issue, but if she had, things would have gotten ugly because I would have flat out refused to pay extra. First off, this isn't a buffet where I'm choosing how much to put on my plate. The kitchen is responsible for the large amount of \"scrap\" quality meat that they are piling on plates. Second, when a customer complains about the quality of the food, you acknowledge it by either taking off the bill or at the very least offering something else. And you certainly don't ask them to pay more. They are lucky I agreed to pay what I did. I have no idea how this place is still in business."}
{"text":"Funnily enough, my friends and I were searching on Yelp to see where we were going to go for dinner. Since maybe of the restaurants in Koreatown have about four stars, we decided to just enter a random place instead of debating about it. After we sat down and made our order, I checked the Yelp app to see how this restaurant ranked. I can't believe we were unlucky enough to walk into what is practically the only two star place in the entire area.   My friends and I fortunately did not have to deal with the rude owner many other Yelpers mentioned in their reviews. Service was friendly and quick (the waitress even helped us cook the meat). Oddly enough, this place plays Youtube videos for their music. On the day that I went, it seemed that Charlie Puth was getting special treatment.  We opted for the KBBQ (but not AYCE). We ordered the samgyupsal and some other pork meat that I can't remember. We also got the tofu soup. The soup was delicious, but the meats were disappointing. The samgyupsal seemed to be tough and hard to chew. The other pork dish was a lot better, but still paled in comparison to other places I've been. The sauces they provided made the food a lot more edible.  Only three side dishes were provided, which is far less than other restaurants I've visited. While they were not too bad, this place just seemed to lack in everything.   I'm going kindly give this place three stars because service was friendly. I can definitely see why it ranks so low in comparison to other restaurants in the area"}
