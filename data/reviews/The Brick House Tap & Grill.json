{"text":"Food is ok.   Service is super slow.  Pizza and gyro that was here before had a way better menu.   The prices are also high here.  You get pittsburgh prices in North huntingdon.   The old restuarant at this site was way better."}
{"text":"$4 for a Michelob Ultra draft?  Is it a craft beer now?"}
{"text":"So sad when the there Friday to get a favorite Diablo pizza ordered extra hot sausage. When pizza arrived had ground sweet sausage for the extra hot sausage. Being this time of year when hot Hungarian peppers are maxing out in gardens guarantee there was not one whole Hungarian pepper on our large pizza. Told waitress about the sausage and pepper shortage she said the owner made it. We have been getting Diablo pizza since they opened and she said they just started with the sliced hot sausage wasn't true. She plunked our bill down and walked away. She said she would tell the owner but I know she won't. So owner I say to you myself that was a very poor excuse for a large Diablo pizza. Best pizza ever just crashed and burned."}
{"text":"I would give this please one star just because bartenders always nice, but the lady own the place is the most ignorant person could be a restaurant owner"}
{"text":"Very large selection of beer. Out table got two small pizzas (which were very good), wings (which were phenomenal), and iceberg wedge salads (which were more like whole heads of lettuce but still quality). 

Lots if food for a relatively good price and would have been pretty quality price without the beer. (But let's be honest the beer makes the meal). 

The atmosphere was ok. Pretty barren, however lots of televisions which make it a pretty good place to watch a game! Totally would come here again as we had a hard time finding anything else in the area."}
{"text":"Food is better than average, but a touch steeply priced. Drink prices significantly high for the area. Open ceilings add to the poor acoustics. Very loud and lots of echo. Ambiance thus minimal. Good experiences to date with the servers. Overall, was expecting a nicer experience each trip, but very average, especially given the size of the check."}
{"text":"Stopped in tonight to grab a pizza for a quick dinner.  We ordered a large pizza with mushroom and green pepper.   There was nothing special about the pizza.  Ordinary thin crust and not a very flavorful sauce.  Also, disappointed since the toppings did not seem fresh,  but like they were out of a jar.  Also, at $2.20 per topping on a large pizza, it can get a little pricey.  

They have a decent menu, and I have had the pasta on other occasions, so I probably would stick with one of those options rather than the pizza."}
{"text":"I enjoy going to the Brick House.  LOVE this type of atmosphere.  I 've never had anything to complain about anytime I've been here.  The food has always been good.  LOVE the Rachel sandwiches.  Service has always been good."}
{"text":"Beautiful place...food is pretty good.....but they never have any idea of what beer they have...no accurate table beer menu...the dry erase board is useless....and the servers only know what's on tap if they write it on a piece of paper while I r waiting...why must customers play the \"what's on tap\" game?!?  How do u sell what no one knows u have?  Ugh"}
{"text":"I frequent this restaurant a lot. Food is always good and the staff is very friendly. I have to recommend the Cheese Ravioli, as I love Ravioli and theirs is among the best out there.  
Plenty of TV's to watch your favorite game. A full bar with comfortable seating. 
The pizza is also a favorite of mine. 
I highly recommend to take the family or friends here for an enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"We frequently order take out (since the eat in service is not very good and we live near by). We have ordered 10+ in the past, without any major issues, but tonight was different. First, we always order the Pasta Diablo but with spaghetti noodles. Not a major change, just a switch of noodles. After 2 mins on hold, they said they would not do the change, because the owner didn't want them changing menu items. Then, I always order the Pasta Lucci's with extra sauce on the side (they never add much sauce and it dries out when I have leftovers so I always order extra). It arrived with no sauce on the side, but I was charged. When I called, they said it was on the meal and they could send out a side of sauce but I would be charged ANOTHER $2.50 + tax. Needless to say, they have lost a frequent customer. I will not pay $40 for a meal when I'm unable to even make a change as simple as pasta noodles."}
{"text":"Good location, has continually impressed me in the dozen or so times I've visited. Food is very good - Gyro pizza is my favorite pie in the area, and the fish sandwiches during Lent have always hit the spot. My only negative is that it is closed on Sundays, as my wife, kids, and I like to go out for family meals on Sundays."}
{"text":"I have to agree with Dave m. This place was disappointing the soup was bad the food was tasteless and the service needs a lot of work! But it is new and maybe they can work the kinks out. The bar area is nice and has a big selection."}
{"text":"great food, always a place to get take out. love their pizza. Wife loves their Smoked samos dish. Increased prices made me change this to a 4 star"}
{"text":"Wait was not worth it.  Ordered a Chicago pizza, and it was in no way a Chicago pizza.  It's pretty hard for me to order pizza anywhere and my kids not liking it. Ended up throwing away leftover pizza. Wasn't even good cold the next day.  Bummer because its so close to home. And I was kinda expecting a Brick Oven."}
{"text":"Checkout the Fontina Chicken.  Great food and beer selection- awesome place to watch a game. Big Screen easily visible from any spot in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Super cool sports bar - great atmosphere, awesome beer selection, good food.

I was out this way for a 5k, and not being very familiar with the Irwin area, I did a Yelp search to find a good place for after the race to grab a bite for lunch - and maybe a beer ;-) I wasn't real sure what I was going to get with this place - since the ratings weren't that outstanding - but I was not disappointed one bit! In fact I was quite pleased - it was exactly what we were looking for. 

'Bar' type food on the menu - sandwiches, salads - and apparently the pizza's are pretty good too. I went for a burger, and it was delicious! Medium rare with pepper jack cheese and sautéed peperoncinis (I typically get sautéed banana peppers on my burgers, but they improvised and I was fine with that). I got a small caesar salad and some tasty chips to accompany my meal. 

TONS of beers on tap - If I could guess I would say about 30, so lots to decide from and it wasn't easy! Lots of local beers too. Exposed brick walls and TV's all around the bar and the restaurant. If this place was closer to where I live I would definitely frequent for sporting events. 

Anytime I'm out that way and am lookin' for a casual fun place to go, I'd be back."}
{"text":"Ate at the Brickhouse tonight, even after reading the mixed reviews. Overall our party of 4 was satisfied, but there are legitimate concerns that should be adressed. If tap is in your name, why is there a laminated wine list, and no beer list; not even paper?There is a tap list in the bar with the name and alcohol % only, no descriptions. The bar was too deep to read the tap handles. The 20 taps were at least 50% macrobrews, the rest meh. 

We had the pan and traditional pizzas, and the stuffed salmon. All were good, and I thought reasonably priced, although I understand some people might think it should be priced like Eat and Park or Applebee's. The service was good, but the staff appears inexperienced and untrained. As an out of towner, I didn't know what 6 cut meant as a size. 10 inch get it, 6 slice get it. Told waiter I was familiar with triangle slices and I didn't know what 6 cut meant. He couldn't tell me that meant 6 slices, and used his hands to show me a small was like a Pizza Hut personal size, but it was more like a 14\" diameter. 

With an experienced craft beer manager, beer list, and staff training, this could be a a real draw from more than north huntingdon."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time despite some of the reviews and was impressed. I loved the atmosphere (spacious and modern), several tv's ideal for sporting events, etc.. Fair pricing and food was good. Server was pretty irritated with us, although it wasn't busy and we met with another couple (she could've been a little nicer). 
Will definitely return & recommend."}
{"text":"This is one of those places that has lots of different things.  As usual with places with a big menu, the food was okay but nothing special.  I got a deep dish pizza and while it was not bad, I would not consider it to be a real deep dish pizza.

The inside is pretty plain and almost feels like you are eating in a warehouse there are however a few pictures here and there.

This place is okay for families or quick bite to eat.  I would not be opposed to going back to this place however I would not be the one to suggest going there."}
{"text":"Okay folks new does not mean good. Wedding soup had no meat, sub par service, it has not been often where I have had to clear appetizer soup and salad plates when the server arrives with entrees since there was no room to set our food on the table. The food was expensive, lukewarm, poorly cooked and bland or tasteless. Sadly as dissatisfied as we were in the entire experience and believe me it was obvious the waitress was oblivious."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised with this place
Food was good, service was excellent and prices were reasonable. I had the calzone, my only complaint was the ricotta cheese wasn't spread throughout the calzone. Fish sandwich was really big and salmon was good. Also had calamari as appetizer which was very soft and fresh.

Will be back"}
{"text":"The remodel of the restaurant is really nice 
Ambiance is good. The main thing I enjoyed its pizza I think this is their thing. I like to have a choice in the hood that has so little options 
I hope they can improve some other dishes and keep the place cool. The bar is really nice looking service nice and amiable"}
{"text":"I've been more and more disappointed with the food lately. Pizza is still great but not sure but the steak hoagie went way downhill... I threw the last on in the garbage"}
{"text":"Great addition to North Huntingdon!  The restaurant is very new, so they do have a few kinks to work out.  However, overall, the service is good, at least at the bar, and the pizza is excellent!  Definitely one of my go to places for pizza and decent food in the area.  I'm sure once they have some more time, the place will work out any food or service issues that other diners may have experienced."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that they have done so much with this place and it looks so much nicer inside since changing hands. My husband and I have yet to eat inside because it is always packed. Last night, I decided to order something and  go pick up it up. I ordered a steak salad for me and a Reuben for my husband. I asked the girl who answered the phone if the sandwich came with anything. She informed me, after having to check the menu, that it came with fried chips, french fries or a house salad. I told her that I wanted fries. 
She told me that it would only be 10-15 minutes. This shocked me because the place always looks so busy. At any rate, I arrived 10 minutes later and it turns out my order was ready. However, there was a gentleman in front of me buying beer and, since the girl working the register and phone was young, he had to wait until she rounded up another employee to ring him out.
Then, when it was my turn, the girl asked me if I had placed an order. I said yes, 10 minutes ago. She asked for my name, which is not a common last name. This was not enough apparently because I had to give her my phone number and what I ordered. Well, low and behold, it was the only order sitting on the counter! Image that!
The worst part of this was that the total was over $24! This was a total shock to me. I asked her why it was so much. Well, she informs me that the salad was $13 (what?!) and that the Reuben was around $11. I looked at a take out menu, which states that sandwiches come with fried chips. There is an upcharge of $1.50 for fries and $2 for a house salad. I informed the girl that this is not what she told me on the phone, and that I only wanted french fries if the sandwich came with them. She was totally in shock and had no idea how to handle the situation. She literally stood there just looking at me, like \"well, umm. Yeah, the menu says $1.50\". Well, didn't she look at then menu when I asked her over the phone?!
Luckily, another employee was close by and came to her rescue. He took $2 off of the bill. The girl was nearly in tears. She apologized and said she has only been here for 5 weeks. I said that it was fine, it's no big deal, but I was thinking that she was rather incompetent. Plus, I think 5 weeks at a job is long enough to be able to read the menu, which does clearly state the upcharge. 
I had heard some not so good things about this place, and I will probably never visit again. It is over-priced and service is sub-par. I can't even use the excuse that this is a new restaurant since the owner has two other restaurants (that I know of) close by that are fairly successful."}
{"text":"Went there for my birthday and it did not disappoint. I am in love with thier marinara sauce. Friendly and clean."}
{"text":"Below average food and some of the worst service in town second only to Rodney's. How do you mess up a grilled chicken salad and a steak hoagie??"}
{"text":"We started with the wedding soup and that was so freaking good. Then I have the stuffed salmon with risotto and my husband had chicken park with spaghetti. Both meals were delicious!!!  Great draft selection as well! Good bar atmosphere:-)"}
{"text":"Pizza is excellent - especially the Sicilian!  We all enjoyed our food, soup and salads.  Service is much better than before."}
{"text":"I got the seared scallops which were just okay I love scallops but was slightly disappointed... The sauce was good but just mediocre... My boyfriend got an Italian calzone and thought it was \"solid.\" I wish I could try the pizza cause that's what they are pretty much known for. They have a lot of tvs and drinks aren't bad, pretty quiet atmosphere."}
{"text":"Went for our annual couples dinner and was impressed. My husband stuck with pizza and was pleased....Lucianos quality. I had the grilled salmon with balsamic glaze and it was delicious. Drinks were good as well."}
{"text":"After working for the family at other locations, this was different than expected! The menu has a variety of items and the beer selection is one of the best in the area. 

My sister and I ordered a pan pizza (always my favorite) and my mother ordered the greek salad, which was great! The Brick House is just what this area needed.

The service was okay. I only say \"okay\" because I myself am a server and tend to over-critique my server. She was attentive and nice, but didn't engage like I do when I wait on a guest. 

I will certainly be returning!"}
{"text":"Not very impressed with overall experience. The large neon sign said wing night Wednesday and I was in the mood for wings so we stopped. Don't be fooled by the full parking lot; still plenty of tables open. Mostly customers just at/near the bar. We were seated quickly and the waitress came over rather prompt. She wasn't very welcoming, and just asked what drinks we wanted. Said she would give us time to look at the menu, didn't suggest anything or even mention wing night. Not sure she wanted to be there. We ordered loaded fries and wings. The fries were good; however contained a piece of aluminum foil, at least that's what we figured it was. The wings were a let down; the sauce was good, but you could tell that the wings had been made awhile ago and weren't fresh at all. Very annoying, and we would have gladly waited for fresh wings. The waitress asked the classic \" is everything okay? \" better question than \"how do you like your food?\" Sad, since they should take more pride in what they serve and how they serve it."}
