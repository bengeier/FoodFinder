{"text":"Went for lunch the restaurant is nice, staff were kind, good service. Unfortunately the food was bad. I had the vegetarian burger and the corn inside of the burger was absolutely disgusting, I had to remove all of it. The burger was mediocre and bland. I can't say anything about their dinner menu but I would not recommend going there for lunch."}
{"text":"Located where was the Rosalie this nIce place is great for a drink and hangout with friends  3 levels with different ambiance.  Good also to organize your corporate events.  Decor is great and the service very good too."}
{"text":"Drinks were good, the DJ on Saturday night was great.  The restaurant has a really fun atmosphere and the food was tasty.  I had the salmon tartare and it was good, the menu has lots of options that looked good and had options for different budgets (it would be really easy to go all out here). Nothing seemed to be over the top WOW but for the location and it atmosphere it was worth it.  Everyone seemed satisfied with their food, I would definitely try it again."}
{"text":"Fun new spot on rue de la mountagne. Beautiful and cozy setting. Excellent food and great coctails. Try the calamari with general tao dipping sauce and the salmon tartare."}
{"text":"I think this place might be closed. Google states that it is \"Permanently Closed\" and I called during their posted open hours and the phone number is \"un-assigned.\" I haven't been to the physical location so I can't confirm. If anyone has further info, please share and I will be happy to change my rating."}
