{"text":"Months before moving down here I was told about,and eagerly awaited, trying food from the S.A.G truck. I wanted one of everything! Exercised restraint and started with a Brisket Sandwich and an order of Hush Puppies. From the first bite, It was difficult to eat with the massive, euphoric smile that tickled each earlobe! Brisket was spot on tender without being overly smokey. The Slaw was nice and crunchy and I opted for the sauce(tomato vinegar based) on the side. Which, every drop, quickly made in the mix. All served between a big ol' soft sesame seeded Martins Burger bun. Sat in my car and took the whole thing down, Quickly!Also,The Hush Puppies were as good as I had hoped they would be. The Guys are extremely friendly and gracious. When asked \"How it was\" while throwing my trash out. A silly grin and a thumbs up said it all!
  Tried the ribs on my next visit. Also very
Good. IMO, a little light on the initial seasoning. Want to try the (Pulled, chopped pork) or as I'm told BBQ? Next time.
I do see the price increase over the past year though, still a great VALUE! Well worth it. If you don't  truly understand operating
and food costs then, the dollar menu it is. But I'm lovin THIS! Da dat dah, dat dah"}
{"text":"I'm new to the area so I've been trying out local BBQ establishments to find a new home and feed my periodic cravings.   I saw the SAG food truck out front of Cashion's and was curious; \"how good can a food truck be?\"   Apparently it can be really good.

If you purchase by the pound they will give you two buns and a side of sauce, enough for the whole pound.   I've tried to recreate this flavor with liquid smoke and a crock-pot and I can't come close.   The hickory taste is dominant, yet balanced.  The sauce is Western style with a little tartness as well as a sweet finish.

I can't speak for the rest of the menu, however, I'm excited to go back and buy a pound of brisket due to the positive reviews here. 

It would be nice if I could purchase a side of hush puppies and additional buns.   

Quality BBQ."}
{"text":"We have had their pork, chicken & briskit. It is all soo good. My wife not being a big meat eater, said we can go back every weekend! Since moving here from California we have been to many bbq restaurants and have not been impressed. Smoke and go is the real deal! Real smoked meat with flavor. also like how they keep their sauce on the side so if you per fer a diff rent kind. The customer service is wonder full too. Very friendly staff to help you make your decisions."}
{"text":"Everyone loves to rate BBQ and claim they know the best spot.  After finding this jewel a few years ago, I'm convinced Smoke n Go is the best tasting BBQ I've ever had.  Service is just as good as the food."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, good bbq and a cozy outdoor firepit area to relax after dinner. I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"All I have to say is, this place is one of the best if not the best BBQ I have had since I moved to NC. They are friendly and courteous. I have been here 3 times in the past 6 weeks without disappointment. I will keep going back. You should definitely try it!"}
{"text":"this truck comes to my job and ive tried it several times hoping for a great experience and ive yet to get it the fried chicken and mac and cheese are ok but thats it. The potato salad is the worst ive ever had in my life the BBQ is ok ive had better, alot better but the reason i gave to stars is the smell of the grease !!!! i think they fry everything fish and chicken in the same grease yuck!!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome BBQ takeout. Quick, a ton of food, service with a smile. We ALWAYS have left overs for a few days. We usually get 1 lbs of pulled pork a large Mac n cheese, Med. Coleslaw for my husband and I. A cheeseburger for my daughter. The pulled pork or chicken is great on a taco too.

My only suggestion would be to give more buns with the pound of meats. There are never enough... But that's how we discovered putting it on a Taco works too.

Not a fan of the fried Ochra but maybe That's because I'm not a Southerner? 

Anyway, keep up the good work! My family loves this place. So convenient and yummy."}
{"text":"I ordered a turkey leg with Mac and cheese and green beans. They messed up the order and gave me potato salad instead of Mac and cheese - which tasted sour and overall inedible. The green beans were overpowered by seasoning and equally unappetizing. The turkey leg was dripping with grease and yet somehow still overcooked and dry. Even better I spent the next 12 hours sick to my stomach. I will not eat here again, but I'm giving a star because they at least provide friendly service."}
{"text":"Consistently good bbq. Friendliest service ever. Gotta love good food and good people all in the same spot."}
{"text":"Our favorite BBQ in this area and we have tried many since moving here in 2014.  Great service, wine prices are a little higher than comparable restaurants however."}
{"text":"I used several groupons to try Smoke and Go and I was able to sample a few of the menu items over several visits.  The fish, chicken, brisket and mac and cheese were all decent but not good enough for a return visit in my opinion.  The bbq sandwich on the other hand would probably be a reason to return but I don't tend to eat bbq that often....that being said, the mobile crew were all very nice and the wait time is minimal if you happen to be in the area with bbq on your mind."}
{"text":"Nice location,  friendly staff, reasonable prices. Accepts credit cards.  But . . .

Ordered a cheeseburger and coke.  The burger did not smell or taste good.  I think it was because the meat was a cheap, frozen patty with more filler than beef.  It grabbed all the worst flavors from the smoker.  Nasty.  I threw it away after two bites.  I also threw the Coke away because it was served lukewarm.

Unfortunately, a rare let down since I pretty much like everything."}
{"text":"This review is based on their Fish Sandwiches and sides. I got their tilapia fish sammy and thought it tasted a little fishy. Definitely not fresh but still edible. Nothing special added to it but your basic tartar sauce and optional cheese and hot sauce. The bun was also a little stale. Honestly, I also don't think it was worth the price either. You can spend a few bucks more and get it gourmet style from Bone Fish Grill. Service is great. They are probably the nicest food truck folks I've ever encountered. I didn't care for their fried okra. It was too bready and tasted previously frozen. But if you're on the go and passing through then this place is a go-to."}
{"text":"The best BBQ in the Lake Norman area. The ribs, brisket, and pulled pork are amazing. All the sides are delicious. The review would not be complete without mentioning they are so friendly and helpful. Follow them on Twitter and Facebook so you know where they are."}
{"text":"This little family operation might be one of the best kept secrets in the Cornelius/HVille/LKN area.  They setup shop at cashions @ the intersection of Catawba Ave & 73 on most Saturday & Sunday's.  They trailer their BBQ pit directly to the site,  so you know they are doing things right because the smell is just amazing.   I do a lot of BBQ myself,  but when I am in a pinch, or in the BBQ mood and don't feel like spending all day on it, this is perfect.   The portions are large enough to split between two,  and the prices are really pretty fair for the quality of the product.  The staff is awesome always smiling,  and happy to be serving you.  The pork & brisket, are excellent examples of what good BBQ is all about,  the meat.  You get a perfect amount of smoke,  and it is not all sauced up.  You actually taste meat instead of just a sticky/sweet artificial smoke flavor.   Their sides are ok, the slaw is chopped fine and is light and crunchy.   The Mac & Cheese could use a little tinkering with, the last few times we have had it, the flavor was a little bland for me.    You really cannot go wrong with any one of the BBQ items.  Check it out if you are in the area, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I was on a brief vacation to Charlotte and I really wanted to try some NC BBQ. Being from San Diego, well yeah I need legit BBQ.

So it was 35 degrees outside at 4pm at their normal Saturday gas station location. They had the most amazing brisket and chicken. I had to get seconds for later on. I totally can taste the vinegar smoked into the meat.

The people were great and told me to wait in the car (being a California girl.... yeah they figured I'm not handling this cold well) and they brought it directly to me

The mac n cheese was pretty decent too and the gentleman in charge of the twitter account actually took a break from cooking to greet me!

All I have to say, if you're in Charlotte on a Saturday, get there early because beef ribs was sold out quick. And since I'm allergic to pork, can't comment on their pork ribs."}
{"text":"SGB is the bomb BBQ! Mouth watering ribs, brisket, pork and chicken. The smoker hits your nose the moment you pull up. The staff is friendly and courteous and the food came out quick and hot. Make SGB your next BBQ stop!"}
{"text":"I had never been here before today and I must say the Chopped Pork sandwich with french fries was amazing! My family and I will definitely be back. Beyond the food, the customer service was outstanding. I am so impressed and happy to have found this gem! Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Update to my last review. Portions have gotten smaller and prices have gone way up! It went from $8.99 per lb for pulled pork BBQ to over $12 per lb. I loved it when we first moved here but in my opinion it's overpriced. You can get great BBQ for much lower prices at other places."}
{"text":"I was extremely impressed with their smoky, surprisingly delicious, pulled pork BBQ sandwich. The sandwich was large. The meat was tender. The pork had noticeable smoke rings, just enough burnt ends, and a wonderful smoked flavor that is exceeding hard to find nowadays. This is GOOD BBQ!

All the employees were friendly and courteous. 

As I drove away, I gave everyone there a big thumbs up to show my appreciation of their efforts. They all waved and gave me huge smiles in return. 

This is excellent pulled pork barbecue, and far superior to the vast majority of barbecue restaurants. If I lived in Huntersville or Cornelius, I would eat here once a week. I think that you will pleased if you give them a try.

{"text":"For the fifth time I have driven to truck around 6:00 PM on a Saturday. Dinner time for sure! But, again, no brisket. No offer for a discount to try something else on my fifth trip there! The last time I went, they asked me to try the ribs. More expensive and not what I wanted, but I did. Bad choice! Tasted like charcoal fluid. So now I feel like I should go to Lancaster's BBQ, at least they will have something beef.
Guys, lack of planning costs you customers. Lack of empathy to get a customer back costs you everything!"}
{"text":"Great staff and food, but the price has gone up so much that I am not sure I will be returning."}
{"text":"Got a pound of their BBQ and it was amazing. The sauce is out of control (I could drink it lol). Also, the people working were super friendly which is the best part!"}
{"text":"Amazing - the pulled pork was one of the best I have had.  Recommend the bacon wrapped shrimp.  Great atmosphere for BBQ!"}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY love this place! I got to try them at a fall festival and their bbq is so delicious, one of the best I've tried! Also you will leave here feeling amazing because the service you get is phenomenal."}
{"text":"One of the BEST bbq Sandwiches I've ever had. I ordered the shaved pork sandwich $6 (no sides). It's a fairly large sandwich piled \"all the way\" with slaw and smothered in a tangy bbq sauce that is seriously delicious. I agree, it's a bit on the pricier side, but I will have no problem ponying up the $6 next time I see the Smoke & Go Food Truck. Yum!"}
{"text":"Awesomeness... how Bbq should be done , hardwood smoked , great flavor and juicy .. slaw was chopped just right , will be back !!"}
{"text":"Oh, my.  Why has it taken me so long to try Smoke and Go?  They usually park their food truck outside the Cashion's gas station on the corner of Catawba and Sam Furr each Friday and Saturday, so they are easy to find! 

Their BBQ has a real wood-smoked flavor that is just phenomenal.  I have never had BBQ with flavor like this.  And it's chopped, too.  The only downsides?  And this is really based on personal preference -- their sauce is tomato-based, not vinegar-based, and their coleslaw is slightly sweet.  I do wish other sauces were available for those of us who prefer the eastern Carolina style of BBQ.  However, with BBQ this tasty, I can just skip the sauce!

I'll definitely return for lunch and will absolutely consider them to cater any upcoming parties."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place! Their food truck comes to my office park and I decided to order a pulled chicken sandwich, cole slaw, and green beans. The green beans were good and seasoned well but chicken sandwich was disaappointing. Very salty and overly seasoned;  not the type of BBQ flavor i was looking for. The cole slaw wasnt terrible but a little too soggy with mayo for me. I ending up throwing half of food away. Im not sure i will try again at this point. I will probably stick with occasional trips to Jim N Nicks."}
{"text":"I work at the Bank and sometimes find it hard to get good quality lunch for your money. I'm new to the \"Food Truck\" so I didn't know what to expect. 

My first visit at the S.A.G. I ordered the Fish Plate, with fried okra and coleslaw. The food was so amazing!!! And the service was right along with it!!  As if I was sitting in my mother's kitchen! 

I returned today and ordered the Chicken Wing Plate and it was absolutely wonderful! I normally don't write reviews, but after reading their bio, I had to make mention of this great food and excellent service! I knew it was something impeccably different about the owners and the food!! 

What an awesome experience!! You all will most definitely be my caters for my next big event! God Bless"}
{"text":"I am not a big BBQ eater, but after Rob B's review, I had to make an effort to catch Smoke & Go when they were open.  Saturday was the day.  I wasn't too hungry so I ordered the fried chicken (one of my favorites).  The veggies were slim picking (they ran out), so I ended up with fries because that's what one of the kids wanted.  The other wanted a hot dog...she said it was de-li-cious.  In any case, the chicken was well prepared, not overly seasoned, and definitely not salty.  Other patrons were buying BBQ by the pound so I will try that the next time.  I did get a slice of the red velvet cake.  I am no expert on red velvet cake but this cake made my tummy feel great!"}
{"text":"Just want to add a few things. First off, the hours and days available change weekly. We went to go last Saturday and the truck was nowhere to be found. If you go to the website and click on the \"WeeklyMenu\" button it will say where and when it will be that week.

Took the miss' today and I just wanted to throw out how ridiculously awesome the brisket sandwich ($6.35) is. I definitely enjoyed it slightly more than the chopped pork. It's a huge portion of tender, smokey beef brisket simply piled on this bun. Throw on their sauce and coleslaw and you've got yourself one heck of a lunch. The miss' is also now a fan of the chopped pork sandwich. It was a little too big for her so she ate half today and has the other half for her lunch tomorrow...that is, if I don't get to it first!"}
{"text":"As it has already been stated, most Saturdays you can find this mobile establishment at the Cashion's Quik-Stop at the corner of W. Catawba and Sam Furr.  Sam Furr, who named that road?

Anyway, I highly recommend their barbecue, which I have delightfully enjoyed on numerous occasions.  Never have I had a disappointing meal, however I must admit to not venturing deeply into their side dishes.  I come for the great barbecue because that's all I want.  Now that they have established themselves as purveyors of a superior product their prices have been steadily nudging northward, and the sole reason I deduct a single star.  It's a recession, we're all hurtin'.

My recommendation is to buy their pork barbecue in bulk, pick up some buns and cole slaw from the adjacent Harris Teeter, and try not to make a pig of yourself.  It pairs nicely with a domestic cerveza of the \"any\" variety."}
{"text":"Smoke n Go can be found in Huntersville at the Cashion's at the corner of Sam Furr and Catawba on most Saturdays. Not sure of the rest of their schedule though. 

My hunger and their appearance never seemed to be in synch until today. To celebrate, I had a chopped pork sandwich that was HUGE. I'm not kidding. Could have easily been two sandwiches. It had a good smokey flavor, all meat, no fat, good bark and was served with a Western North Carolina type sauce and some coleslaw on top of a sesame seed bun. I have to say that it was pretty damn good and I look forward to another visit to try some more of their fare."}
