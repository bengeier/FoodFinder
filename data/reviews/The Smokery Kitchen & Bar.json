{"text":"The food is very very good! The restaurant  decor and atmosphere is clean and pretty. I'm not a big meat person but the coffee brisket I loved! Everything on that dish was good: the cole slaw, the corn bread! The boyfriend had the fried honey chicken (spicy) and it was really good too. The chicken is moist on the inside and very crispy on the outside. The corn that came with it was very tasty as well! I didn't get to try the dessert because I had to leave early, but my sister had the crime brûlée and she said it was amazing! Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Best fried chicken I have ever had! 

Not cheap, but I would still go back again.

One of St out file's better choices."}
{"text":"We walked in feeling we were under dressed as we came from work. ..but were made to feel welcome the minute the hostess met us at the door...my husband started with the lobster croquette app and was happy he did!! Followed by the Chorizo sausage and I had the Half rack with Mac and Cheese on the side ...Ribs and I go way back so I am generally highly critical...they were excellent. ...for dessert. ..the s'more ..I could eat 5....we had a Fabulous meal...Excellent service and will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"The Smokery gets a lot of things right. I gushed about the menu to friends after grabbing lunch one day (mushroom soup w/ Parmesan), so we all (8 + a toddler) went for dinner. As of this writing they're serving a Summer menu - mains include coffee beef brisket, BBQ pulled pork, honey fried chicken, house made chorizo... a few started with poutine (why yes, you can top it with pulled pork), and the table got a mix of brisket, chicken and ribs, pulled pork and porchetta. Pretty much all entrees come with cornbread, cabbage slaw, fries and/or mac 'n cheese or mashed potatoes. I got the pulled pork, which was tender and delicious and had just the right amount of BBQ sauce; everyone was thoroughly impressed with their mains. While the beer selection isn't extensive, it's certainly quality over quantity. On tap you'll find Beau's Lug Tread and a seasonal selection from Beau's, Amsterdam and Nickel Brook. The back bar is great as well. OH I almost forgot dessert: creme brulee is on the menu, and while it's usually my go-to, there is a S'MORE dessert. Yes. Graham cracker crumble crust, chocolate ganache middle, toasted marshmallow top. SO GOOD. Our halfling guest (the toddler) was quite pleased with his fries as well! If I have one tiny complaint it's that the menu could use more vegetables and greens.

Service was great - very prompt and professional but also warm and friendly. The owner Chris looked after us and clarified any questions, give us some info on the food prep, and took the time to go through the whole menu with a friend who has a gluten allergy. 

The decor is well thought out without being over the top. Understated and casual but refined. The location is also excellent, right on Stouffville Main with ample parking across from the GO stop.

I and my group were thoroughly impressed with and will most definitely be back."}
{"text":"I was totally disappointed in my first experience here. I went for lunch on a Sunday - found out they only have a buffet brunch option, which is fine but the quality of food was disappointing. They had 4 hot food options (eggs, hash, bacon and bread pudding) and a few cold items (devilled eggs, potato salad, carrots, fruit salad). Not really a lot of options for $24/person. They also had porchetta that was barely cooked and wrapped in in foil and kept out. We were there for 2 hours and it was not kept hot or cold - isn't that a food hazard? Service was slow (hard to get salt and pepper or a second cup of coffee). Overall, I am disappointed. I hope they get better with time, or maybe brunch isn't their strong suit..."}
{"text":"Fresh beer, the best beef brisket I've ever eaten and a great atmosphere. I will definitely be recommending this to my friends. Thanks to the guys at Rouge River foe sending me here."}
{"text":"Wait staff was inattentive and dismissive when we first walked in the door, not impressed right off the bat. Decor and menu style do not match whatsoever. Although the food wasnt bad, it was horribly over priced, this is downtown stouffville not downtown toronto. Also did not enjoy the man, not sure who he was, seemed to be the owner/manager, bothering every table about wine selections even after their food was delivered to the tables seemingly just to push wine sales, i was just trying to have a nice quiet meal. I will not be back."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. This review is for a lunch we had. $15 for soup of the day, one of their lunch sandwiches and a housemade chocolate chip cookie -- great value! The zucchini-basil soup was delicious; peppery with good basil flavour. My lunch date had the pulled pork sandwich and it was good stuff, the meat wasn't fatty and the BBQ sauce not too tangy with some heat from the spicy mayo. I had the breaded chicken and it was tasty as well. The arugula was crisp and fresh but there was a little too much dressing in my sandwich and oil dripped from the bottom as I was eating :p The cookie was a delicious end to the meal. It was thick, chocolatey and chewy, maybe it was Alton Brown's The Chewy!"}
{"text":"Very nice! The Smokery is what happens when BBQ goes a bit upscale. We tried a Caesar salad with real house-made bacon, and a roasted pear and blue cheese salad, both quite good. For mains we had the lamb stew and the pulled pork plate- slow cooked, tender and delicious. Servings were a reasonable (not too big) size and good value with most entrées about $20. Service was prompt and friendly but could have been a little more attentive- servers should check to see if diners need seasoning (no salt or pepper on the tables), if the meals are satisfactory or if we want another drink. Likewise a plate of cornbread or rolls would have been nice while we waited for our meals. Little things, but things offered routinely in most restaurants. In all, a nice spot, good food, fair prices- we will definitely return."}
{"text":"I've driven by this place a few times before I decided to give it a try. Came in between prime dining hours and the place was almost completely empty, minus a couple of tables. The decor is very modern and trendy, with rustic wood accents from the birch bark and sliding barn door, white subway tile, industrial metal seats and the subtle dress of the wait staff.

As it was lunch time-ish, was provided with two menus: one for sandwiches and another with their lunch and dinner options with categories of starters, BBQ, mains, desserts to name a few. Prices were roughly anywhere from $7 for an appetizer to $30.

The food can really speak for itself: house made pickles, delicate long-smoked meat that is so tender that the meat fibres separate with a touch, delightfully light cornbread. The plating was nothing to speak of, and was rather minimalistic.

The service, while attentive, really could be kicked up a notch. It's not great to see the wait staff watching tv and checking their phones. And I hate it when they take my plate away, especially when my guests aren't done. And it almost seemed that the waitress was borderline annoyed.

The Smokery is confusing, portraying what would be rustic Southern cuisine in a very modern and upscale way that doesn't work. Ribs, smoked brisket, pulled  pork, it should be homey, warm, rustic and messy good, and cheerful staff to boot, like Stockyards on St. Clair."}
{"text":"If it's takes 35 min for food to come out from the kitchen for party of 4 in the empty restaurant, that can only mean that dishes are made of frozen food.
Horrible quality of food!
Did not like it and do not recommend it to anyone else."}
{"text":"Food was good.  I had the coffee brisket, found it a bit dry.  Portion sizes were perfect. Everyone in our group enjoyed their meal.  Didn't get our appetizer so we were given a free dessert.  Cheesecake was delicious .  Will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"I came here with my family.  We had a reservation because it was a large group.  We came here because our family that live here recommended it.  The room was ready when we arrived.  The service was so slow.  I could not believe that it took us over 3 hours to order and get our dinners.

I ordered a burger.  The waitress didn't ask how I wanted it cooked and as food was finally coming out came and told it it was going to be cooked medium and she guessed she should have said that earlier.  It took a while from then to get my food.  My burger came out ice cold and it at some point had been cooked well done.  I only tried to eat part of it because I was so hungry.  I ate the side of Mac and cheese.  That was good and most importantly hot.  Three other people got burgers and they all got there's like mine.  The pear salad that another member of our party got was so salty no one could eat it.  

I was so disappointed.  I left the here hungry and the server didn't come back to check how we were just to clean up our plates.  I'm not sure what happened here because we were only brought there's because they had good experiences.  I would not come back to this place!"}
{"text":"Delicious food! Modern decor. I consider this a classy bar for a small but growing town. The mac and cheese is baked with more cheese on top, drool worthy. The honey fried chicken is also bomb. Plus they serve rouge river beer, up and coming brewery from Markham. Their winter pale ale is actually a really pairing with the quality comfort food you can get at the smokery. MMM!"}
{"text":"I cannot tell you how much I love this place! The owner is not only incredibly supportive of families (we have a one year old and they went out of their way to make us feel welcome) but the food is absolutely delicious!
It's not often I head to Stouffville, but when I do, The Smokery is definitely on the list.  Don't miss it."}
{"text":"Frastrated employes were not trained properly that is they couldn't do a good job, my dinner was not raw and my fries came half way cooked. They need more time to get the the experience and to that level to serve the people."}
{"text":"Visited  there last  night.  Food was delicious but took over an hour to get. I spoke to our server who seriously,  did  not care. They did  not give  us  bread  or any comped appetizers. He had  said, \"we're  busy\". The restaurant  was not  full and EVERYWHERE else with  a full house, never took an hour to prepare  food.   Also, same naive server made a stupid comment  in reference  to my friend's background. She was highly  insulted.  Will not  go back."}
{"text":"Awesome 'downtown' dining experience right here in stouffville! Fabulous atmosphere and decor too. Would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a lunch with a buddy at The Smokery. I really like the decor which is faintly upscale without being overwhelming. We selected from the Stouffvillicious menu to just try things out. As it turned, we both chose the soup and brisket sandwich with the chocolate chip cookie dessert. The soup and the sandwich were both outstanding and as I am not a chocolate chip cookie fan, I took that home for my daughter who assures me that it was excellent. Hard to believe that they are three great restaurants side by side in downtown Stouffville. I will be back to sample more of the menu."}
{"text":"Modern & Cozy | Craft Beer | Whiskeys & Scotches | BBQ | Limited Seating

Kitchen closes at 9pm but bar can open longer if you request it.
Little cozy restaurant seats about 40 in the front end but has private room.

Street parking available, no private lot from them.

They also have a wide selection of whiskeys and scotches. The owner also mentioned they do whiskey tastings every month.

Roasted bone marrow $11
It was good, comes also with kale chips but wasn't mind blowing.

Coffee beef brisket $21 
Really tender, definitely a recommended dish. Comes with mash potatoes but may not be enough for an average growing man. (My friends had to order more)

Honey fried chicken $16
Generous portioned plate, comes with nicely seasoned fries. The chicken was moist and juicy on the inside and crispy on the outside. Definitely another recommended dish.

Pork ribs rack $21
It was unfortunately drier and harder than I expected. It was not fall-of-the-bone ribs and it was a bit burnt. The cabbage-slaw it came it didn't have much flavour to it although it was a nice portion. For this price I would have chosen the brisket if I had known.

Coffee banana lava cake $6
It was not lava-y at all. No spill once I cut in. It was okay.

Spiced bourbon caramel cake $6
It was nice but nothing too fancy.

Coffee creme bruleee $6
This was good, the flavour and texture of the filling and the crust was perfect.

Overall, I'd definitely come back and give it a second try."}
{"text":"I'm so excited to write a Stouffville review that my hands are literally shaking. Something is happening in Stouffville folks, the community i growing and with that a trickle of new cool businesses are beginning to take root - Enter, The Smokery.

Located about 500 m east of 9th Line along Main St Stouffville, it's next to two of the towns already shining stars (Fish Bone and Red Bulb).

Looking at the outside, you might think this is going to be a rough and rugged smokehouse, well son you'd be wrong. While this place isn't rugged, it certainly isn't pretentious. It's a perfect balance of elegant and rustic. My kinda spot.

I had a chance to chat with the owner/head chef who told me of his storied history working and running kitchens in Toronto for years. And now opening his own place in S-ville, all his wildest (and let's face it my wildest) dreams are coming true.

First off the menu. I got a look at the lunch menu and it's mostly sandwiches that are more than reasonable in price. I went with the smoked Turkey sandwich on an Onion Bun. Holy Hell - the Turkey was brined before it was cooked and so it was so moist and flavourful, also the slices were so thick and the portion was huge! Delicious!

I also understand that there is a brunch service on the weekend that includes buffet and champagne cocktails? HWHATTT?!?!?!? Get me up early for a drive to Stouffville to have brunch and cocktails anytime. The Owner also informed me that because their spot is a little better decorated than some smoke houses, that the misconception is that they are expensive, when IN FACT, according to chef there isn't an entree that exceeds $20.

Ok ok ok... now my fav part, here comes my fave part! The BAR! The Smokery has my dream back bar, equipped with only the highest quality cocktail spirits around, and guess what? The same guy cooking your dinner is also a huge cocktail nerd like ME, so he's crafting amazing classic cocktails using premium spirits. AND to add to that wonder of his bar, he's also supporting a local craft brewery (Red Falcon) on tap in a couple of varieties. 

I didn't get to sample the cocktails or dinner menu, but you can bet I'll be back and bringing my wallet! Oh and for those drivers, parking can be found around back, at the GO station OR on the street.

Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"Very tasty food! Interesting menu with unique options. Nice atmosphere. Fair prices. Owner and staff are very friendly. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"We found this restaurant on yelp and decided to give it a try. We loved everything about it! Service was great, the ambiance was awesome with a very clean and modern decor. The food was amazing, and was very decently priced. We ordered the pulled pork with Mac and cheese, and the pork ribs (the meat literally fell off the bone!) with brisket hash. Both meals were delicious. If you're ever in Stouffville , definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"Just ate here for the first time and it was really good! Prices are really good too. We got an appetizer, two entrees, side and dessert for 50 bucks. Was totally pleased with the price.

I had the chorizo burger, great flavour! The pulled pork burger was yummy too. The slaw was a nice added crunch on top. The cornbread is actually the best cornbread I've ever tried. Not saying I'm an expert in cornbread or anything but I couldn't stop eating this one. It had a nice grit to it that I enjoyed! We had the chocolate banana cake for dessert and that was sooo good. It comes with a little mint sprig on top and it was such a nice added flavour to the rich chocolate. 

I would 100% come back here and would recommend this place to anyone who's in the mood for BBQ and BBQ sandwich!!"}
{"text":"About a year and a half ago a friend and I got takeout from The Smokery for the first time. We took it back to his place and proceeded to have one of the most memorable chicken dishes that we'd had to date. After all that time we're finally back at The Smokery to order that same dish, but to experience it fresh! Here's how it went.

The Smokery is a mid sized restaurant along Main Street Stouffville. It has a somewhat upscale bar/restaurant feel that still manages to maintain a relaxed and inviting vibe. They have two main dining rooms, one for typical small groups, and one for large groups (I assume).

The dish that has had my friend and I talking about it for years is their Honey Fried Chicken. With this dish you'll get three pieces of chicken, coleslaw, corn on the cob, cornbread, and pickles. The type of chicken that you'll be served is house brined dark meat, i.e. drums and thighs. Things start getting special on two fronts. First of all, they brush the chicken with this irresistible warm honey glaze, that satisfies your savoury-sweet desires to the nth degree. But then things get a little silly when you bite through that impossibly crispy chicken skin. You may have asked yourself, \"I wonder how crispy chicken can be while still being desirable?\". Well The Smokery has found that sweet spot, and serves you up pretty damn succulent meat at the same time.
Combined with the other pieces on the plate, you'll be presented with an extremely intelligently thought out meal. The corn on the cob is gently buttered with a fitting sprinkle paprika to tie it in with the savoury theme. On the other hand, the cornbread takes a step to the sweet side of things, and the coleslaw provides the opportunity for a change of pace, but isn't so tangy that it departs from the rest of the meal.

This chicken is boss. Combined with a cool environment, reasonable pricing, and good people, I felt compelled to give a 5 star review. That being said, I know nothing about the rest of their food. If you're in Stouffville, stop by for some great dining."}
{"text":"Something has gone horribly wrong here. This very review was once a 4/5 stars. I suggest all that have given more than 2 star reviews to eat here again and update your reviews. This place should be rated WELL BELOW the 3 stars it has.

I went to the Smokery during its first week or so of operation and thouroughly enjoyed the meal although it was a bit pricey. 

I returned a few months later, and what I found was SHOCKING to say the least. Every single item on their already over-priced menu was raised by $5. That means a pulled pork plate with mac and cheese and corn bread now cost a whopping $20!!! Unbelievable! 

The other terrible change was that the food was COMPLETELY different than my first visit. The pulled pork was obviously of the grocery store microwave packet variety. Simply putrid in taste and consistency. The coleslaw was completely different, and now flavorless. 

I am so disappointed. After my first visit I was happy that we had a decent BBQ option in Stouffville. All I can say now is that they have KNOWINGLY cut massive corners and started serving flavorless microwave quality BBQ. They probably had tons of business the first few weeks and then started greedily reducing quality and raising prices to maximize profit. 

I WILL NEVER EAT HERE AGAIN. Even if they bring the quality back up and cut the price to a reasonable level, I simply can't eat here out of principle. They are greedy and have ABSOLUTELY NO CLUE what good BBQ is. You can get real BBQ that's actually really good for about half the price if you take a short drive outside of Stouffville.

This place is called The Smokery and I'm pretty sure the only thing smoking, is the frozen pack of pork as its pulled out of the microwave."}
{"text":"Came here today for the first time to try their OrderTheYelp item which is the House Made Yelp Corn Dogs

Place wasn't busy, it does have a very trendy look, and warm atmosphere. Servers were friendly, and there are a lot of interesting items in their menu to choose from.

Me and my fiance each got the $5 corndog special, and the corndogs were a good serving size, the food wasn't greasy at all, and I loved the dip!

We also bought an extra order of cornbread for $3 and the cornbread was GREAT! 

We were left happy and would surely return frequently after having a very good first impression on this place.

{"text":"Finally came back after an amazing yelp elite event here and I was not disappointed like I usually am when I revisit places that I have high hopes for.

Again, I really love the atmosphere and decor of this place. It reminds me of a classy and clean home in the woods. The owner is amazingly nice and came back several times to make sure we were okay and if we needed water refills. It's nice to see the owner give such effort into running their restaurant, instead of the usual owners that sit back and watch their servers go crazy over a busy restaurant. There were only 2-3 other tables at the time, and it was almost time for closing time and the owner was still working hard. Kudos, Chris!

The drinks are a little pricey but the food prices are on par with any other western restaurant. I was planning to go to the gym after so I didn't stuff myself with the amazing honey fried chicken that I tried at the previous event. I had the soup of the day, which was squash something.. LOL, I don't remember but I remember it being absolutely DELICIOUS. So hearty and homemade, I loved it! For my meal, I had a caesar salad, which was the BEST caesar ever. Dressing is very light, it's peppered to perfection, the croutons are crunchy and delicious AND the bacon bits that were in it were almost as thick and big as the croutons!! What?!?!? Amazingness. My friend had this sausage dish and the sausage was HUGE. I was so surprised that I blurted out \"wow that's a huge sausage\", which got a few laughs from my friend and the owner. My friend said that was the best sausage he has ever eaten, and it was amazing indeed. It tasted like it was prepared in kitchen instead of buying it from a meat shop. It also came with 'delicious' coleslaw (quotations because I didn't try it, and I don't like coleslaw) and the yummy cornbread. 

I'm DEFINITELY coming back to try more food here, even though I don't live in the area. Smokery is the gem of main street stouffville."}
{"text":"Cannot say enough about the wonderful service, cocktails and food. The coffee beef brisket is amazing as is the poutine. We've never had a bad meal here.   Chris the owner is super friendly and knows how to run a restaurant. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Had a very enjoyable night. Very friendly staff and was surprisingly kid friendly (we brought an 8 month old).  Food was top notch.   The pork belly app was the highlight for me. Crazy good.   Also had the bone marrow. Surprisingly not that heavy compared to other places I've had marrow. Still tasted great. 

We tried the fried chicken (spicy version) and it was tasty. Kinda reminded me of giant Kung pow chicken. Very crispy!  Also had the chorizo sausage. Salty, spicy, yummy. 

Will go back to try the rest of their menu!"}
{"text":"Was watching diners drive ins and dives BBQ tour in Memphis and mouth was salivating for ribs. Do a quick search in Stouffville and come up with The Smokery.

This place does not have the look of a smoke house, but it does look modern. The place wasn't too busy and I wasn't sure it was even open. They closed off half the place cause it wasn't busy enough. But it was open, thankfully.

The ribs, they were decent but a bit in the dry side for me. Asked for a side of their sauce and that was better. I really like how their mains all come with side of slaw or fries, corn bread and pickles. Felt a bit like their ribs are a bit on the lean side. Was hoping for lots of meat.

The owner said they smoke for about 5-6 hrs with pesticide-free applewood, I'm no expert on wood for smoking but pesticide-free seems important and I've heard applewood is good for smoking!

I'd love it if their corn bread was hot, but room temperature was decent too. The best part of the meal, the honey fried chicken was the best!

I'd say it's not yet Memphis good but it was good enough for the night. The place is clean and they have a good selection of beer on tap, pretty much the seasonal stuff. When craving ribs in Stouffville, Smokery fits the bill."}
{"text":"Nice decor and friendly staff. Food was good but a bit pricey. The parking lot behind didn't have a lot of spots, but it was easy to park on the street."}
{"text":"Visited the restaurant on Saturday. We had a party of 10 people.

They ran out of Salmon, didn't have any chicken left, the meals didn't come out all at once, the burgers were cold, one of the dishes was not spicy as listed.  The brisket was fatty and not enjoyable.

Would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Came here on Saturday night, and it wasn't busy. Lots of free parking everywhere, in the back lot or on the street.

The decor of this place is really nice and modern and service was friendly and quick.

They have Beau's and a few seasonal beers on tap which is a nice touch. 

I ordered the spicy fried chicken and was pleasantly surprised! So crispy on the outside and nice and juicy inside, without feeling too greasy. The coleslaw was only alright though. Cornbread was good! 

Other dishes that my party had were the pulled pork and mac and cheese and the cheeseburger (which was seasonal). I didn't get to try any, but I was told the pulled pork wasn't anything to write home about, and the mac and cheese was too fancy. But it's all personal preference. 

Fries were delicious also.

Overall a very good experience. I would come back given the chance."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch last week with a friend. The interior is great - love the space and love the sliding barn door to make the upper level a private room. 

Lunch was ok. I had the chorizo on a bun with a corn relish with fries. The chorizo had a great flavour although a tad over cooked and I was disappointed that it was served on a 'Wonder Bread' run of the mill hot dog bun - for the price and flavour that dish deserves better. My friend had the porcetta with apples sandwich - he said it was amazing. It looked great and was served with fries and on what looked to be a ciabatta bun. Wait staff was friendly and attentive. 

I'm going to go back in a month or two. It takes time to get your legs so I'm hoping that is the case."}
{"text":"We decided to head over to a Stouffville during \"Stouffvillicious\" Days to try a new restaurant, and we were quite pleased with what we found!
During Stouffvillicious at lunchtime, for $15 you could have the daily house soup...we had sweet potato squash, drizzled with balsamic reduction, followed by a choice of house smoked meat sandwich...we had a porcetta and a brisket sandwich, followed by a fresh baked chocolate chip cookie. It was all delicious! They also had a nice selection of teas to choose from, which we appreciated, along with a well-stocked bar. Their dinner menu for Stouffvillicious was very interesting...and we plan to return soon!"}
{"text":"Newly opened for about a month now 
I believe the person who served us is the owner of this place, Chris
Super friendly and easy to have a conversation with

When you go for smoked BBQ meat you might not be picturing fancy decor or eating with a knife and fork but this is what The Smokery Kitchen and Bar is offering. A classy meal with even a wine list but served up with BBQ smoked meat. Not what I was expecting when I came here but if the food is good then that's all that really matters to me.

Coffee Beef brisket meal $20 - hands down the BEST beef brisket that I have had so far. The meat was juicy, flaky, tender all at the same time and had great flavour. Comes with cornbread (really sweet and yummy), coleslaw and mash potato (pretty disappointed with these two sides. It was just too simple and lacked flavour)

BBQ Pulled pork meal $18 - meat is good but I'm use to eating my pulled pork in sandwich form so eating it by itself was a bit weird. Comes with mac & cheese, coleslaw and cornbread. The mac & cheese was good but once again I though it lacked something. It just looked like a simple mac & cheese that I could make at home. Needed some colour like green onions, bacon bites, anything really to make it stand out from being a regular mac & cheese.

I find that the two meals above were a bit on the pricy side for what you get. I thought the portions were a bit on the small side. If my sister didn't give me some of her meal then I'm pretty sure I would have left still hungry. 

Lindt chocolate cheese cake with coffee syrup $6. This cheese cake was simply amazing. I was sold when he mentioned the word Lindt. You can really taste the Lindt chocolate too. The coffee syrup added that extra level of uniqueness and awesomeness to the whole package. 

Because of the beef brisket and the Lindt cheese cake I can see myself coming back really soon to try the wings and beef ribs. Just too curious what these might taste like."}
{"text":"Came here a couple weeks ago with some friends and maybe my burger was already cold by the time I got there but I was definitely not too impressed with my whole experience.  First off, I have an extreme OCD peeve with my burger being mushy, hence why I'm just...not a saucy girl.  I don't like too much sauce in my burgers.  However, the pulled pork burger sounded quite appealing and generally, I love pulled pork.  

I was a bit disappointed, however, because my pulled pork lacked flavour (was a bit watery) and my burger was ..mushy.  Ack!  I ended up just forking out the pulled pork because quite frankly, a mushy burger bun is an epic waste of calories.  

The sides (slaw) and fries were just average.  I just felt that everything really lacked flavour in general.  Overall, it was a pretty sad experience and maybe one day, when I'm brave enough, I will go back for a second chance."}
{"text":"Place has potential but lacked quality, presentation and flavour and priced Hugh for what you get. Dissapointed."}
{"text":"We were in the area for the holiday season, and we headed here for dinner. What a nice little space!

The decor is upscale but welcoming, and the service was quite attentive, that may be partially because it wasn't very busy the day of our visit.

They have a nice beer selection of mostly local micros. We started out with some duck confit poutine, which was really lovely, with a nice gravy and a lot of fresh cheese curds.

I also had the honey fried chicken, which had a kind of small sized chicken, but the chicken was high quality and really tasty overall. 

Definitely a tasty place, and a nice addition to Souffville!"}
{"text":"Good: service 

Bad: all the food

Came with family and we got the smoked salmon tagliatelle, honey fried chicken, bbq smoked ribs, fried cauliflower, beet salad, and lava cake for dessert.

The smoked salmon pasta had NO smoked salmon in sight, only tiny flakey remnants of what seemed like canned salmon. It also had no flavour and was dry.

Honey fried chicken was the only alright thing we had. But then again you can get much better fried chicken in any other restaurant...even popeyes.

Beet salad was ok. Not much to say.

Ribs were dry, so burnt that my parents had to scrape the burnt surface off, and in general disappointing. Go somewhere else for ribs.

Fried cauliflower was alright but then again you can still get better 'bbq cauliflower' elsewhere. 

Finally, the lava cake wasnt a lava cake! It was just a cooked chocolate cake.  Nothing flowed out when we pierced the cake. 

Only giving 2 stars because the service was good. But dont come here expecting great food."}
{"text":"We enjoyed this place so much we went back the next day! EVERYTHING is fresh cooked/made on the premises.  Only critique I had was my pulled pork poutine came out cold. Still ate it and it was delicious! We will be back."}
{"text":"Fantastic food.... Coffee brisket is delicious and the honey hot fried chicken will make me come back.  They smoke everything in house including making their own bacon which makes even a simple Caesar salad memorable."}
{"text":"4.5 stars. A very cozy restaurant on Main Street Stouffville. Love the homey wooden decor :) Took clients out for a late lunch and we were very pleased with our experience at The Smokery! The fall menu was very appealing. We wanted to try everything on the menu lol.

I really enjoyed my Bourbon Bramble ($11) - it is a sweet cocktail made from my favourite duo bourbon and elderflower liquor ^^ The Beau's Lug Tread ($7.25/pint) crafted beer was very tasty too. My clients ordered coffee ($3) and refill was on the house, thanks!

I ordered the 1/2 rack cola braised ribs ($21) to share, and added 2 pieces of their well known honey fried chicken ($5)! It also came with house made BBQ sauce, and cornbread, cabbage slaw & fries on the side. I love cornbread and this one was quite satisfying!

For dessert, we shared the apple creme brulee with actual stewed apples ($6) and the spiced bourbon caramel cake with vanilla bean ice cream ($6). They were both delicious and not overly sweet, which is good! The Lindt chocolate smore is more rich and sweet if you crave for something sweeter ^^

I will definitely come back again. Price is on the higher side but with the quality of the food, I don't mind it as much. Highly recommend this to those in the area looking for good eats, and those coming from afar and want a taste of what Stouffville has to offer!

P.S. There is a separate private room to host parties too! Perfect for the holiday season and celebrations!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the tasteful, beautiful decor. The lighting, floor, wall color and furniture worked together to look elegant and simple. Even the washrooms were nice. I liked the welcoming atmosphere and friendly staff. Most of all I liked how the food was satisfying and tasted good. I could feel that the food was made with love and care. The experience was wonderful and relaxing."}
{"text":"Tried The Smokery on a Friday evening. Personally I found the service slow and the staff disorganized. Some servers were rushed and stressed whilst others stood around idol. The portion size is small and their eclectic menu is mismatched at times. The chairs are incredibly uncomfortable and I would highly advised them to rethink their seating arrangements. The decor and the food styling seems confused...BBQ with a wine bar setting and highly populated by young families. All in all the food wasn't worth returning for.
Like anywhere-see for yourself & try to visit at off peak hours"}
{"text":"We liked The Smokery for a lunchtime snack - the quality was high in the burgers, fries, cauliflower soup, and cookie we ordered. The dining room was clean and attractive, and the service was calm. However, I wish the manager that day didn't have body spray on because that really upset my nose and sense of smell for the food. 
Because we're North Americans, and we're used to food served to us in trough-sizes, the serving plates here will look small, and the lack of garnish makes it look empty, hence, you will initially assume the portion you're getting is small -- but nonetheless, for us it was the perfect healthy amount to eat at that time of day."}
{"text":"Lunch Special $15 includes a Sandwich of your choice, Soup and a Cookie as a dessert is a pretty good at The Smokery Kitchen & Bar.

Ontario Craft Beer on taps which is seasonal and on a rotating bases sounds good to me.

Porchetta Lunch Sandwich+Tomato Gazpacho+Chocolate Chip Cookie ($15)

Roasted Pear Salad ($9)

Amsterdam Sweetwater Squeeze Radler - light and refreshing for a hot summer afternoon

Seasonal menu but some of their Signature items will always be available i.e. BBQ and Smoked Meat.

We were luckily to have Chis be our server as he is really professional and knows the menu really well. 

And of course I know I will be back again for lunch and even dinner soon!

{"text":"The food was amazing and very reasonably priced. I have never had such great macaroni and cheese as a side. The atmosphere was nice and not rushed. The ribs were delicious and cooked  perfectly. I will definitely be back to try more. Thx Chris. and Stephanie and especially the  chefs."}
{"text":"Food was good although very small portions.  My son ordered veal brisket and was still hungry. I ordered ribs and they were different very dry but smoked so a different taste then what I am use to.  Service was terrible it was a Saturday night and they had 2 servers.  Not sure if I would go back."}
{"text":"A small hip restaurant in a growing community (Stouffville) with friendly staff. Probably a 3.5-4.0 Stars but I will up rate this place because it isn't a 3. Came here for a lunch session because the Yelp pictures of this place seems interesting. When I got here the staff was very friendly, but the restaurant only had half of the seating open so it looks very small inside because the door was closed to the other room. Did I say the staff was friendly? Everyone who entered the restaurant seem to know each other? 

In terms of the food, they had a lunch menu, a fix price lunch sample, and also a kids menu! The lunch sandwiches with fries were around $12-13 but the fix course was sandwich and soup and dessert for $15 which seems like a little better deal. I got the beef brisket sandwich, it was pretty good but I got to say of all the food we ordered the quantity of it seem to be a little bit on the small size which is why I got to give it a little lower rating. 

If you were to get a dessert, you must get the cookie! Warm, fresh, and soft chocolate chip cookie.... so good..... *drool*"}
{"text":"Love this place, fresh & flavourful food, wonderful service! The owner is also very friendly!"}
{"text":"Second best burger in the area. Sorry Baldwin still wins for me. However this is better than my last year favourite Smash Kitchen and Bar. 

The service for a single server is very well done. He knows the food and drinks (though I didn't have any drinks. ) I can overhear the explanations and he knows where the components come from including the maple syrup that comes from a neighbouring supplier that is used with their bacon. 

The burger is a unique blend of pulled pork with a juicy beef patty and aioli sauce that ties them all together. It is presented very well and does not look like it was just thrown together into a big blob. The flavour mix was well balanced between sweet salty and sourness. 

I split the burger with the mrs. so I can try out one other thing i saw which was the pork belly appetizer. 

The smoked pork belly appetizer was very flavourful. Since it had some other things with it including apple and some green thingy which was apparently Brussel sprouts after I checked the menu. The Brussel sprouts were cooked so well I didn't even realize I was eating that yucky vegetable. The flavour mix was complicated and fun for me. The sprouts probably added that very slight hint of bitterness which improves on the taste. 

However the burger is still well more value for the $. 

Since I am on a diet in a way I cannot grab the other thing that I was eyeing on the menu. But I will definitely try the pulled pork with corn bread and Mac and cheese plate."}
{"text":"As a Vegan I wasn't sure what to expect. With a name like The Smokery I was only expecting everything to be focused around smoked meat. I initially came in to warm up and have a drink. I was pleasantly surprised by the selection.  I had a Portobello mushroom dish over green lentils and half a baby grilled Romaine  which was wonderful!  Im so happy there are places that cater to a non meat diet. Thanks!"}
