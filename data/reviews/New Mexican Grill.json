{"text":"If you are a fan of Mexican cuisine and love green chile, this is the place for you. 2 locations, family owned and operated, made fresh daily. Huevos rancheros & machaca beef are favorites, always covered in green chile."}
{"text":"Service is slow even when there is no one In there. Took them 25min just to make my one Order. Aegean though still one of my favorite Mexican places in chandler."}
{"text":"We took the advice from fellow yelp-ers and tried this restaurant out when we were in the area. The food was full of flavor! I had the machaca beef enchiladas -- one with green sauce and one with red sauce. I'm a fan of their green sauce, it was outstanding. I will go back soon!"}
{"text":"I went with family to order take out from here a few weeks ago. Both my mom and I hate beans, so we ordered our burritos without them. The employee behind the counter assured us they weren't made with them to begin with. My sister wanted to pay for some chips and salsa with hers too, but he also assured us that it came with them for free. When we got home, I took a bite a discovered there were beans in my burrito, as well as my mom's. Also, there were no chips with the order. Clearly the employee that took our order either didn't know what he was doing, or didn't care."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! It is a small bay in a strip mall, but don't let that fool you! Seating is a little limited and the lunch hour is busy. Peruse the menu board and place your order at the counter.  The staff are friendly and welcoming! And the smells eminating from the kitchen will have you drooling like Pavlov's dog!  The green chili stew and fry bread is a meal I could eat daily. Another fave is the green chili burrito. It is huge and the flavour is amazing. I occasionally pair this with a machaca taco. A lot of food, so plan for a nap.  Try it out!"}
{"text":"Wow! Ate here about 2 years ago and decided to give another try.  I shouldn't have!  Not much New Mexican about this place, other than the titles on the menu items.  My first instinct should have sent me away when I saw there signs in the window misspelling \"chile\", when referring to NM chile, it is spelled \"chile\", Texas style and others is \"chili\".  The chile is no different than any other run of the mill \"Mexican\" restaurant around town. Salsa is very \"Mexican\".  It seems as the chile they are using doesn't come from NM. I think a ride to Santa Fe for the owners to try the NM flavors and learn the style would do them well.  Green onions, machaca and carne asada are not scene on NM food menus. Never again for me."}
{"text":"This is the first time that I have been moved to write a review.  I am visiting the Chandler area, and I found this restaurant on Yelp.  The food is fabulous.  Its a great value.  The people working there are warm and friendly.    I had lunch there today.  I saw that they had a veggie, bean burrito.  I asked them if they could add green chile.  \"Sure,\" they said \"how about some red chile sauce on top.\"  I asked for green chille sauce instead. \"Sure,\" they said \"we can put cheese on top and bake it.\"  Its like having your own kitchen.  While I waited for my burrito I munched on all the crisp fresh tortilla chips I could eat along with 3 different kinds of salsa.  When one of the cooks brought out the burrito it was about the size of Montana.  He looked and me and said, \"Now that's a burrito yeah/\"  It sure was a burrito.  It was the best burrito I have had.  It was made with a really delicious and fresh tortilla, which I assume they made at the restaurant.  Then for dessert they brought over some cinnamon covered tortilla chips that were just great.  The cost of the meal was about $6 including a bottomless iced tea (brewed).  I came back later in the day to pick up a great dinner for 3 and it totalled $15.20.  The only problem with this restaurant is that it is in a bad location that gets little foot traffic and it is hard to spot.  This is obviously a family business, and these folks have put all of their love, money and labor into it.  We are always complaining that there aren't enough good restaurants, or that there are not enough good value restaurants.  Well, here is one!  But, I am afraid they will not survive long term just based on traffic.  I hope that fellow Yelp members will try this establishment, so that it may flourish, as it deserves."}
{"text":"My group had Fry Bread, Tacos, and Burritos. Carne, chicken, beef. All were DELICIOUS and flavorful. Love the look and feel of the place (reminds me of my favorite taco stop in Tucson). When you go in it's like you've found a delicious surprise restaurant hidden away from public eye. The fresh ingredients on the plates were refreshing.They have an open kitchen so you can see everything that's going on. Then, on top of that, expansive menu was impressive. I want to go back- and I'll tell people I had great food+service there."}
{"text":"Awesome carne asada tacos. Everything is home made, The chips and salsa are fresh and delicious. We will definitely be back for more!!!"}
{"text":"New Mexico Grill in Gilbert is now closed on Sundays which was the only day we ate there. Why did they close on Sundays when they were busy? We drove all the way over to the Chandler location and we were the only customers the entire time we were there. The food seemed to be the same, but I'm not driving out of my way again. We discovered Tacos n More on Higley which has better food and ambiance, but we do miss the green chile."}
{"text":"Just had the best Chili Relleno (sp?) I've ever had!  The tortilla they give you on the side is huge and yummy with this.  We just have not had anything here that we didn't like!!  I still recommend this place with the highest rating....SOOO Good!!"}
{"text":"Could there be a half star? He who must eat could not eat the green chili pork - salty and the meat- sorry did not taste like pork. The red sauce had a poured out of a can taste. Sorry but we walked out - haven't walked out in a long long time."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! if you want really good Mexican food in this area, this is the place to go. The prices are great and the food is even better!"}
{"text":"If you like green chili pork this Is a great place to go. Just know the hatch green chili sauce has some heat. Some days spicier than others."}
{"text":"I'm only giving  four stars because I've only had one item from the menu. My wife and I popped in yesterday and I ordered the carne adovada frybread. It was absolutely amazing! I ordered it Christmas style (red and green chili). I can't advise beyond that but the staff is extremely polite and the free chips and salsa is also very good. Will certainly be back."}
{"text":"Loved the Gilbert Road location, but it closed. Today I ordered the number one combo. The beans had a burnt taste, the taco was in a pool of grease, and the enchilada was ice cold as I watched it sit on the counter for a few minutes waiting for the other food. No gloves on the cooks and the staff seemed overall unfriendly.  The two stars are for the salsa, it's yummy!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious! N the best part is they have veggie options! A must go for Mexican foodies! :)"}
{"text":"Dined here for the first time on 5-26 with my wife & daughter. My mother-in-law said we should try it and we are glad we did. I ordered a Bean Tostada and a Ground Beef Taco. The taco first. It was Crispy, Crunchy and lots of flavor, loaded up right. Only negative was it fell apart as soon as you took your first bite. No worries though, nothing a fork couldn't handle.. Now on to the Bean Tostada. One of the best I have had in years. It was a thinish shell, yet supportive enough for the all the goodies on top. The beans are way flavorful as well. We also ordered a Fry Bread sans the Honey.. WHOA Nelly. NOT your ordinary Fry bread. Most fry bread is a greasy lump. However here that is not the case. Light, Fluffy and just the right amount of Powered Sugar on top.   I will be back as well. A hidden gem, without signage (which is 100% ok with me), so the \"hipsters, wannabees, and doofus'\" stay away and don't ruin this place, like they do with most places in Gilbert/Chandler."}
{"text":"I give NM Grill 2 stars because it used to be quite good. I noticed the change when I got take-out on Cinco de Mayo, they changed the chili. I got the red chili beef enchiladas and a beef taco. The chili looked like brown gravy, not the bright vibrant New Mexico Chili and tasted more like gravy and not like a true red chili should. Also the salt level was off the charts. The food here is generally on the salty side but this tasted like I was licking a salt rock. The taco had no meat unlike their usual crunchy tacos and looked like it was run over it was so flat. I figured maybe they were just having an off night so I gave them another chance tonight. I got the red chili cheese enchiladas and tried a taco again. The red chili is still the same strange brownish gravy looking salty sauce, not New Mexico style chili at all, they must have changed their recipe which is not good. The taco had meat and was good like usual but the salsa had no flavor. Please work on the chili recipe, this is not red chili. I was born and raised in New Mexico and have been eating chili my whole life and what you are making now cannot be called red chile."}
{"text":"This is definitely a \"hole in the wall\" restaurant. Authentic food. Fast and nice workers. Definitely try this place!!"}
{"text":"Great 1st time experience. Very nice servers. Ordered carne asada tacos and beef chimi with my wife. Food was excellent. Great flavor in carne asada. Kid had a quesadilla which was just ok but that didnt stop him from eating his whole plate clean."}
{"text":"Ate hear again  Recommend anything green chilie pork here  Burrito is best value Fish tacos are insane too  Free Jalapeño salsa- got extra for my eggs all week"}
{"text":"Came in with my fire crew 2x this week!  Had posole, was super good with fry bread. Thanks Ralph keep you the great food. KDS/GFD"}
{"text":"Chicken burrito with green sauce  (#7) and pork burrito with green sauce (#4). Both excellent flavor and huge portions. We had to get a take away box for one of the burritos. Service was decent. The food was definitely worth the trip."}
{"text":"I found this place last year & I'm so glad I did. Every time I go, the food is always wonderful. The tacos, enchiladas & beans are probably the best I've had."}
{"text":"Very Filling!! Never have had New Mexican style food (born in the Midwest, out here on work assignment) and it was delicious! Cooked to order, and was a big portion!  Ordered the Green Chili Pork Breakfast Burrito, with extra eggs, and was amazed at how much food I received for $7 total!   Try this place!"}
{"text":"Discovered this place thanks to Yelp.   Friendly,  attentive staff and clean dining area.   Food came quick and everything was tasty, with reasonable pricing.  Our group ordered chicken fry bread, adobada fry bread, and a couple of burritos.  Everything tasted great and the kids (small and tall) all gave thumbs-up.   Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying this restaurant. I Ordered $50 worth of food to go and then waited for an hour in the restaurant to get my food. I realized something was wrong when the people waiting ahead of me were getting their money refunded and leaving empty handed. The manager comes out and says they're going to close the restaurant early because they're running out of food. That's fine but then she proceeds to tell me we are going to have to wait outside now for our food. That day, it was about 104 out so you can imagine my frustration at this point. I decided to just call it a lost cause and get my money refunded so as I was about to ask the manager for  a refund, she asks me if I'm waiting for my food and I ptry to explain that I'm done waiting and want my money back when she cuts me off and says, somewhat rudely, that if I'm not waiting for my food, I need to leave.   I end up getting my refund (minus the tip that I gave) and leave empty handed having wasted an hour of my time. I will not be coming back after this experience."}
{"text":"New Mexican is a small chain that makes pretty good fast food quality Mexican food. It's not expensive, tastes good, and the staff are all friendly. There is another place that's cheaper and better, but it's a little farther out. New Mexican is a fine replacement."}
{"text":"I am from Albuquerque, NM and I was happy to hear that they serve NM food. I love Hatch chili and this restaurant didn't disappoint. I had the red chili stew with pork and the beef burrito with red chili. Both were awesome. I will come back this weekend for the posole. I grew up on this food and since moving to Phoenix in November of 2011 I couldn't find New Mexican food until today. Hatch chile is the best!!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time yesterday. I was very pleased with the chile relleno. The deep fried exterior did not overwhelm the delicious cheese filled hatch chile. The red sauce on top was a winner.  Everything tastes fresh and the salsa bar is an added bonus. I will be taking my family here very soon."}
{"text":"Excellent salsa.  Chili rellano was great. Long way for us to travel. Need a location in Cave Creek"}
{"text":"The machaca breakfast burrito is ridiculously good less than $4.50.  Their green chile sauce is what separates this place from the 'Tos burritos joints.  Their fresh salsa is excellent too.  If you tried the place on Gilbert & Queen Creek, then you tried the wrong location.  This one on Lindsay & Pecos is awesome."}
{"text":"I love this place. They have a great menu, but you can also walk in and tell them something you are in the mood for and they will find a way to make it if at all possible. Great for breakfast too."}
{"text":"We were so amazed to actually find some New Mexican food in our area, but what was even more amazing is how authentic the food tastes. Tastes like food you would have at your abuelas house. Fresh ingredients, awesome salsa, the green/red hatch chili sauce is crazy good. Service was fast, place is clean with a nice environment. My family and I will def be frequent customers. 5 stars and I would for sure recommend a visit"}
{"text":"Took a while to figure out where it was since they don't have a sign. Now I think our 6 year old could get us there thanks to the weekly visits. (Although I am convinced that my husband makes solo visits and doesn't tell me.). Yum. Everything so far. Yum."}
{"text":"My wife and I go here once a week.  I love the chicken enchiladas and she loves the taco salad.  Free chips and salsa bar.  Appears to be owner operated and the owner really cares about his customers.  I'd definitely recommend.  There are just not many Mexican restaurants that serve food this good ... in the Phoenix area ... at least not that I've been able to find.  I'm new here though.  I'm not from Albuquerque, but have to agree with one of the previous yelpers.  Albuquerque has the best Mexican food anywhere.  Nearly every Mexican restaurant there basically blew my socks off.  We need to import more New Mexico restauranteers!"}
{"text":"I love New Mexican Grill.  They have the best carne asada around (in my opinion).  I have ordered many things and all have been delicious:  The carne asada is delicious.  I regularly order the carne asada burrito, which comes with beans, guacamole and pico de gallo inside, but the good news is, those extra ingredients aren't so overwhelming that you are left wondering where's the beef?!  We have also ordered the carne asada street tacos (YUM!) and carne asada quesadilla, also delicious.  The chicken is very flavorful too.  Have ordered the chicken quesadilla kids meal, it was HUGE and my son (who eats more than any adult I know, didn't even finish it-although that may be due to the fact he enjoyed the chips and salsa bar a little too much).  The green chile pork is so good as well.  It's moist and tender and the green chile definitely has a kick to it, helps get those seasonal allergies moving!   They also make a wonderful chimichanga, which can sometimes be hard to find, even here in Phx.  I know this for a fact because my father who lives in Florida, comes out to visit once a year and we *have* to go to 4-5 Mexican restaurants each visit in search of the perfect chimi.  Now I wouldn't trust his Floridian taste buds, but I make it a point to sample each myself for quality assurance purposes.  We have gone to fancy places, sit down places, casual places, hole in the wall places and this one, so far, has the most flavor machaca and perfectly deep fried tortilla.  Finally, they have a great little chips and salsa bar where you help yourself.  They make 3 types of salsa, regular, hot and a green jalapeno.  I mix all three into a perfect little salsa trifecta.  Their guacamole is excellent too.  As for the rice and beans, I have had both and they were tasty too.    In conclusion, the prices are good, the food is excellent, the portions are big and I always love supporting local business!"}
{"text":"Went there on Saturday night due to a friends recommendation. Went there with my family and was told immediately that they were closed. Kind of weird that at 7:55 PM on a Saturday they were closing especially when people were ordering at the counter.  I have worked in restaurants all my life and understand that people want to go home but a little surprised that if I get there while they're still they did not want to take my money.  Disappointed."}
{"text":"Love this place! It seems I find myself there at least 3 times a month. Friendly staff, great food and excellent value for the money make this place my \"go to\" restaurant when I'm feeling those hunger pangs. Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"My wife had the chicken salad and was pleased, although she never eats the shell. It's common that she's not filled without eating the shell but that wasn't the case here and she gave it a thumbs-up. I had the enchiladas but was disappointed they couldn't be made with flour tortillas. I chose both with pork and the pork was very good. I still wish flour tortillas were an option with enchiladas as an option, and how adding tortas to the menu?  Great potential, listen to your customers, and update the menu, then we'll be back even more often!"}
{"text":"Nice local mexican restaurant.  There is a chips and salsa bar (serve yourself).  The chips are crispy and fresh, and the salsa options are good.  We ordered the red chile pork burrito and the veggie fry bread.  Both were well made with nice flavor.  Not the best mexican food around but definitely a solid option.  Would go back"}
{"text":"Green chile pork stew rocks!! As does anything else you add green chili too (carne asada burrito w/green)."}
{"text":"This place is small, but big on flavor. Was not sure what to get, so My wife and I ordered the Green chile Stew - wow. That had some serious flavor along with the chicken we shared it kind of. I ate most. We also ordered the Machaca Frybread, was very good as well. Wife ordered the Chicken Chimichanga and the portion was big and tasty. I will come back for more..."}
{"text":"Legit!!! You get all of the good New Mexico experience without having experience all of the usual New Mexico garbage- I moved from NM nearly 5 years ago and have been looking for some good NM food- this place hits the spot!  The owner is there most of the times I have been and comes out and chats with you.  This is a true family run business, which I am always a huge advocate... This place sits in a strip mall- nothing fancy- just good food.  Not a snobby or overpriced mexican food joint, just legit grub.  I like the carne dish with x-tra green chili- (always go with extra green)... Salsa bar is pretty awesome as well, although the food comes out too quickly for me to truly enjoy the salsa bar... :)  Awesome food- I enjoy going here once or twice a month."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!! I can't get enough of the green chili pork, either the plate or burrito. I would eat this everyday if I could!!"}
{"text":"Always have great things to say BUT. If you're going to close at 7:45 then thats what should be posted on your sign not 8:00.  Its a burrito. It'll take about 4 minutes to cook"}
{"text":"This review is for the location on Gilbert Road.   First, I LOVE the food here. I always order Posole to go in addtion to a regular full breakfast.    Although I love the food, I'm really over the service and the time it takes to get the meal. Twice I've been here where I ordered the food and it took 45 minutes to get my scrambled egg combo.  They were not busy and only had one other 2-top table in front of me.  I've also been waiting for my food and seen call ahead people come in and wait more than 30 minutes for an order they called ahead for!    I can hear and see the ladies in the kitchen so I know someone is back there, but they are so SLOOOW it's crazy.   If this place can get their service and timing down it'll be a huge hit and a big money maker. If the food continues to take as long to come out, I'll be finding another breakfast place soon."}
{"text":"Great food, but every time we order to go, we come home to find that our order is always wrong. Very frustrating."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Their chicken burrito is delicious & my husband loves the green chile pork. I'm a huge fan of most items on their menu, the only reason I held back a star is because their chicken salad is kinda pathetic. It's shredded iceberg lettuce with minimal toppings. I'm not a fan- I wish they would upgrade their salad selection so there would be a few more \"light\" options on their menu."}
{"text":"My husband and I eat here at least once a week, sometimes even multiple days in a row. I love their chicken chimichanga smothered in the best green chile sauce ever!! We have ordered almost everything on the menu and have never been disappointed with any of it. Everything is delicious! Love, love, love this place!!!!"}
{"text":"Finally a restaurant that actually serves New Mexican food that tastes like New Mexican food. The red chile \"looks\" the way good red chile should look, dark red. Not bright red like california red chile.  The enchiladas and the green chile pork burro were awesome. Although it's 30 miles from my house it's well worth the trip and I'll be back-soon! Thanks 'Don S.' For the review that brought me here."}
{"text":"CANNOT even put into words how legendary their food is. Grilled chicken burrito smothered in green Chile sauce is life. Love the salsa bar, too."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place. We are fortunate enough to live close by, but I would drive many miles to eat here if necessary. We are from New Mexico and are big Mexican food fans - particularly breakfast burritos (my husband) and enchilada sauce (me), and at New Mexican Grill both are delicious. We actually buy a quart of the red and green sauce each time we eat there to take home and use during the rest of the week! I can never choose between the red and green, so I am always getting some of both to enjoy.  The staff is always friendly, the restaurant itself is simple but clean and they choose a different charity each month you can donate to at the counter - very cool in my opinion. It is well-priced and SO good. Just writing this makes me want to grab dinner there tonight. :) If you appreciate good chiles and sauce, you will love this place as much as we do."}
{"text":"We live very close to the Gilbert Rd. & Queen Creek location, but I would drive miles for their food! My husband is a big breakfast burrito fan and loves their version. I am a enchilada sauce junkie, and let me tell you - both their Red and Green sauces are amazing! Every time we eat there, we get a quart of each to take home and use it throughout the week - on basically everything! They are always friendly, and although the restaurant is very basic, it is always very clean. Also, in lieu of tips they choose a different charity each month that you can donate to - very cool!  For anyone who appreciates excellent red or green sauce, I can't recommend this place enough! Just writing this makes me want to get take out from there tonight. :)"}
{"text":"\"Hey babe, what's that restaurant over there with no marquee? It's packed.\" That first observation speaks monuments about a place. All tables are taken and a line to order in a place that's tucked into a corner of a strip mall with absolutely no signage, I'm in! Tucson has very little to offer, but they do have great Mexican food which is impossible to find in the PHX area... until now. This place feels like it was transported from tucson to chandler. A must try!"}
{"text":"What a great lil spot! Even my kids choose this place for their normal quesadilla or bean burrito over all the rest! Everthing I have tried has been great. The Chile relleno is as good as it gets and it was hard for me to finally order something different. Then I discovered the green Chile stew! My only somewhat gripe is that the spiciness of it seems to be random. I like my food hot and have the tolerance for it but have had this same dish served mild and way spicey, a week apart. They could do without some of the hand written policies posted around like others said...but the food and the people are great."}
{"text":"Love the food. Hate the customer service. My husband and I decided to go there tonight. We arrived at 7:50 forgetting they closed at 8:00pm. We debated on leaving, but then saw that another couple walked in. So we walked in right behind them and saw that other couple was being able to order. So we stood in line and waited. An older lady stood by the counter and told us they were closed nothing else just \"we are closed\". Mind you the couple in front of us was still ordering. This service left a bad taste in our mouths. So if you come here be prepared to be treated badly. My suggestion to the business if you are closed then lock your doors!"}
{"text":"good food, free chips and salsa and soda refills. The chicken nachos serve at least two. Our favorite snack shack"}
{"text":"My wife and I were regular customers here( 2-3 per week) till a few months ago.  We were shocked to see signs being posted throughout the restaurant. The owner seems more concerned about pennies than dollars.  We have never felt so unwelcome to a place. We felt we would try again this weekend to see if things have gotten better. To our surprise, it has gotten worse! A red letter sign on the front door about outside drinks with the statement,\" and don't even ask.\"  It just turned us away. This place was almost always packed for breakfast. There was 4 cars in the parking lot this morn.  Sad to see a business slowly failing over trivial things. Food was always good. :-("}
{"text":"I used to love the New Mexican Grill, but the last 3 times have just made me not want to go there anymore.  First strike - with 45 minutes left until closing, the ice machine had run out of ice and they weren't going to refill it. My husband asked if they could get him some from the back and the answer was \"the soda is cold, why do you need ice?\" We drank warm soda with our dinner. Second strike - my debit card won't run through their card machine. It runs everywhere else and I've never had a problem anywhere. I still use it today, everywhere. They refuse to swipe it and they said the chip must be defective. I had no other way to pay so I left.  Third strike - I  went there last week for fry bread. Middle of the day, lunch time and they were cleaning the fryer. 45 minutes for fry bread. Again, I walked out.   I hate that they're the only place that sells fry bread. I dread going there as customers don't rank very highly there."}
{"text":"Food is really good here, authentic New Mexican dishes with great spicy salsas as well. I ordered  the green chili stew and it was amazing. We also had the carne asada tacos  and they were also very good with plenty of flavor.  The service is really good too."}
{"text":"Wow. Come here for breakfast. Just do it, you won't regret it. The carne adovada breakfast fry bread might just be the best breakfast you've ever had. Hubby had a breakfast burrito smothered in green chili and claims \"I've died and gone to heaven.\""}
{"text":"My absolute favorite local place. Excellent food and friendly staff. Never tried anything I didn't like. My favorite is the chile relleno with grilled chicken, green chile on the side! Also great breakfast.."}
{"text":"Terrible service and very rude people. I lived in New Mexico for 10 years. The food is very average. Green Chilli was salty. Owners took our money 15 min before 8 and they kicked us rudely shortly after 8. I won't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"The place is OK. I was a little peeved with their Carne Asada burrito. The description on the menu doesn't say anything about having beans, but what they gave me was a burrito packed with refried beans and only a few pieces of carne asada meat. When we asked for one without beans, they were a little rude about it, so I told them not worry about it and just dealt with the burrito I had. Later, the manager then even went to my table and talked to me about being \"picky\" and how they have quality beans.   My husband's meal was decent. It's definitely not New Mexican style Mexican food, nor is it super authentic Mexican food, but it's decent food. I wouldn't go back, but I don't hate them either."}
{"text":"I've had a lot of their menu items and have yet to dislike anything. Great service!! Great salsa!!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here 3 times now all of which have been exceptional. The cashier asked me if I liked spicy dishes which I do and recommended the #4 which is a green chili pork burro enchilada style. Amazing is all I have to say about that dish.   Second visit I decided to explore the menu a bit and got a steak quesadilla and a taco, quesadilla was good taco was a bit over priced for what I got.   Third visit was back to the #4...my wife got nachos which looked ok, not great but ok.  Needless to say given the value and the #4 I am pretty sure I will be back many times...planning on exploring the menu a bit more though."}
{"text":"This is some of the best mexican food we have found.  Haven't found one item on the menu we didn't like.  The green chili is outstanding and you know it's homemade when it has just a little different kick to it each week.  Oh yeah, and the fry bread.  Outstanding."}
{"text":"Food was awesome! Green chili burrito was deliciuos, chili relleno was to die for! We'll be back often!"}
{"text":"So good! I come here whenever I can. I usually get chicken and cheese quesadilla. I will soon venture out and try something else! I could probably eat their chips and salsa everyday. The employees are very nice and welcoming also! Great service!"}
{"text":"Finally!  A great Mexican restaurant in Arizona!!  I had the green chile beef burrito and it was fantastic.  The prices are the best around and the amount of food you get makes it even better!  I will be coming here from now on.  I can't wait to come back and try the breakfast!"}
{"text":"We used to eat here quite a bit, but the quality has gone down. The chicken was always moist and fresh, but the last five or so times it has been dried out and flavorless. We usually order 'to-go', but the last time we ate in I was surprised by the lack of cleanliness. I'd like to see them clean up and learn to serve chicken safely without it tasting like saw dust."}
{"text":"Everything is so delicious here. It is so good they don't even have a sign on the building but it is always busy. I love the huevos rancheros with green chili. I crave it. I highly recommend this place!!!!"}
{"text":"This is just down the way from where I live.  The food reminds me of small town New Mexico cafe food you find all over the state and makes me long for home.  I like their breakfast fare and the quick am service.  My only real gripe would be the ice tea which did not taste good on all of my visits."}
{"text":"carne asada burro was phenomenal.  The owner Ralph and his staff is always nice.  Love this authentic New Mexican food restaurant.  Hatch chili salsa, is tasty.  Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Absolutely the rudest person I have ever come across while ordering food. I tried calling in an order and was basically yelled at for not ordering the way this guy thought I should order. The food will keep this place in business for a while but eventually these fools will run all of the business off. Beware of this place and it's horrible service.."}
{"text":"Great food but the only thing holding them back from a 5 star ranking is the process in which they take orders.  they only have one register and the people that go there tend to take their time figuring out what they want.  the line can build up quick and takes forever.  Worst part is when you order take out.  You literally stare at your bag sitting on the counter the whole time the idiots in front of you contemplate their order.  My recommendation is to have them add two registers and the problem would be solved"}
{"text":"Great food...The best RED sauce in town...Very friendly & quirky service!!"}
{"text":"I went there after work and asked if I could have a quart of beans and rice the girl behind the cash register said I needed to call in a order. For a quart of beans and rice?? It's not like I was asking for a party platter. Then I asked for three small containers and she asked the cook and he said there was not enough for the customers. If they are running out of food there is a problem!  This place has HORRIBLE customer service . They just lost a long time customer!"}
{"text":"Yummy!  I was in AZ in August and had a Navajo Taco in Cameron.  I have thought about that deliciousness ever since!  Finally I'm in AZ again and was on a mission to find me a Navajo Taco!  Lucky for me I found this place right here in Gilbert.  Ordered the machaca (shredded beef) fry bread, mmmmm just as good as I remembered.  Good food and good service...I will be back before I leave and I'll be thinking about this until the next time I visit Az."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE! It is as close to true New Mexican food as it gets in Arizona! The style and staff even remind me of New Mexico; I feel like I am there. Super authentic. My wife and I enjoy order to-go food after a long day at work because it is so delicious and speedy!"}
{"text":"Good, Quick Mexican Food. Made to order. Fresh salsa & chips. Great Guacamole. Good prices."}
{"text":"Wow. Excellent food. Green chiles are the best. We always order extra chips and salsa because they are so addictive. If you like New Mexican in the style of Los Dos Malinos, you'll love this place."}
{"text":"I have been to both locations this one was a lot cleaner and the people were way nicer! The food was really good I enjoyed the red chili sauce a lot great flavor! The nachos were good too we had the carna asada. Very clean and I will be back!"}
{"text":"At at New Mexican grill tonight I had the green chili pork burrito and the beef chimi. They were both really good the staff was very pleasant and let me try the sauces before I ordered my food. The only thing I did not care for was I like spicy food but all of it was really spicy I think it could be toned down just a touch. All in all great place with great green chili!"}
{"text":"Excellent new mexico cuisine, the green chili pepper sauce and stew are on par with the best around.  Everything is good, but if you don't get it enchilada style you are missing a treat!"}
{"text":"Este lugar se ha posicionado en puesto numero 1 de comida mexicana de la zona!! Nos encanta!! Hemos venido ya dos veces en una semana y repetiremos muchas más seguro. Genial para familias, un sitio muy económico pero con comida de muy buena calidad. El trato de los empleados es sublime. En definitiva, lo recomendamos 100%."}
{"text":"Gave this place a second try before writing a review and it didn't help.  I am from NM (Santa Fe) and this place really does not deserve to be called NM Food.  I will admit their Red Chili is good, but their Green is pretty bad.  It actually had a floury texture to it and not very spicy at all.  When I saw the word \"burro\" on their menu I knew they were trying to cater to Arizona crowd because no one in NM calls it a burro.  The chips and salsa were okay, but only because they were free.  The first time we were there we ordered two enchilada plates, mine with red and my wifes  with green.  When we got home they decided to make both xmas which was annoying because I was pretty clear when ordering.  We also tried the \"burro\" which was about average.  In summary I was hoping for a Little Anita's takeout and got a Filibertos."}
{"text":"Has been off the charts every time I've been -  breakfast burritos are awesome, green chili pork - the best!  Have a fried egg on your burrito or try it Christmas style (1/2 green 1/2 red sauce) -  nothing but good food - very reasonable too!!!!"}
{"text":"We tried the New Mexican Grill on Gilbert and Ocotillo in Chandler.  The restaurant just opened and we are always looking for a good place to eat that is close to home.  The New Mexican Grill fit the bill!  The tortillas are fresh and everything we have tried so far has been great!!!  Thanks for coming to Chandler"}
{"text":"Food is tasty and certainly different than other Mexican food shops in the area. The meat is flavored better and machaca is tender and juicy."}
{"text":"SO again I venture in today early for a breakfast item.... hard to decide so I go with the special of the Day.... A green chili burger and a side of fries... Ii have had this before and needles to say it was great prior... not so much this time... they forgot to put the green chili sauce on the burger... what a disappointment... while I was awaiting my meal a gentleman was also there who seems like a regular picking up breakfast burritos to the point the owner knows what burrito by name the customer is talking about and asks for chips to go after the bill was paid... the girl says \"this would have been nice to know before as we charge for chips before 10AM\" so the customer lets it go after saying that's crazy we are regulars and spend a lot of money here on a regular basis..... as he is waiting he gives me a look like I know exactly what he is talking about.... so after his food is ready he asks again so can I get some chips? her reply was \"like I said before I would have liked to have know this before so I could charge you\" Customers reply was that's fine I wont be coming back, and walks out... he forgot his keys apparently and returns 5 minutes later... the waitress or cashier reply's \" I thought you weren't coming back\" WTF who says that to a customer in the first place? he leaves and raises his voice this time. he replies this time I really won't be back and I will not refer any of my clients to you either!!!! I do not blame him one bit... as I tried to enjoy my burger that was incorrect in the first place the taste went bad rapidly as I overheard to owner and the cashier talk bad about him for the next 5 minutes... also to add to the prior statement the owner's reply to the customer was \"that's fine we don't need you\"  I rapidly got up and made my final exit!!!!! the sad thing is the food is great but the lack of service over a .30 cent bowl of chips is sad...... I would have been happy myself with a bowl of chips and it would have made a great start to my day!!!! but they proved otherwise toady..... WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!!!!  very poor service and a lack of respect for others... I am A business owner and we were awarded by a notable company recently for BEST OF MESA 2014   so I get the customer service aspect which lacks greatly here......"}
{"text":"Love this place!   Best Huevos Rancheros -- even better than restaurants in NM.  It's casual dining, friendly staff, clean establishment and authentic NM food.  Love their food!  Sandi"}
{"text":"It is different. I don't know if they changed owners or cooks but it's just not as good. Maybe an off night. Had the shredded beef enchiladas and they barely put any chile, the corn tortillas were either over cooked or not fresh but hard and not from frying. I removed the tortillas and scooped out the beef - it wasn't tender but stringy and hard. I poured salsa from the salsa bar on it. I'm so bummed I really, really liked this place. They are still really busy so maybe an off night.  I hate eating out and wasting money and calories on mediocre food."}
{"text":"Tried their new store at 3140 S. Gilbert Road...very hard to find (no frontage, no signage, no street visibility) but well worth it!  Excellent carne asada.  My wife loves their signature \"FRY BREAD\"  which is a meal and a half.  Love their use of green chili in a number of dishes.  We've been back twice since discovering the place last month and plan to be regulars at this new location."}
{"text":"Green hatch Chile sauce and fry bread. Can I say more? My daughters love the bean and cheese burritos. The machaca breakfast is very flavorful! We eat here at least twice a month."}
{"text":"Everything I've had here is awesome! Quality food & their green sauce is amazing! Can't go wrong with a carne asada burro!"}
{"text":"Their machaca breakfast burrito is wonderful.  The staff is friendly and the service is quick (call ahead for take out).  Also, the fresh jalapeño, pico, and hot salsas are the bomb."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!  If you love hatch chiles, you'll love this place.  The green chile stew and fry bread is my all time favorite."}
{"text":"We were car shopping nearby and decided to try this place.  My wife ordered the green chile enchiladas and I got the green chile pork burrito.  We ordered both Christmas style so we could taste both chile sauces.  The sauces were very good.  The red was a bit tastier, and the green was a bit too gravy-like, meaning it was not as loaded with chopped green chile as I would have liked.  Sadly, the fry bread was a greasy mess and not good at all."}
{"text":"The FLAVOR and the QUALITY - AWESOME!!!   I am SO BLESSED that this place is near my home - I can stop in or order out and the food and service is exactly PERFECT!!!   Their home made chips and variety of salsas are TO DIE FOR!!! I usually get the Taco Salad - either shredded beef or chicken. The tortillas that they use are are FLAWLESS and grilled perfectly for the taco salads... Everything that I get is PERFECT!!!  I wholeheartedly recommend that you try this GEM of a grill - the food is FANTASTIC, and the service is IMPECCABLE !!!   I give it a SOLID 5 STARS !!!!!"}
{"text":"All the firemen and cops come here, questions?  It's definitely New Mexico style, not typical Sonoran style, and 4 Stars is too low of a rating.  The food is simply wonderful, especially if you like red & green chile.  Just don't expect luxury, as it is a small corner walk up counter, but it's clean and cozy"}
{"text":"WOW....I really had to think about writing this review as I was truly appalled as I witnessed first hand some unacceptable and simply HORRIBLE customer service directly from what seemed to be the owner or one of the owners.  After having a super long line of customers during the lunch hour as the food is very good, I have to say that the less than tasteful attitude of the person who came out of the kitchen only to speak down to an older gentleman who was eating a burrito with rice and beans was simply unacceptable.  Irregardless of what may have been the situation, to see this person come out of the kitchen and degrade a customer in the Spanish language thinking no one would witness his bad attitude says very little of the establishment.  I thought to pay for the meal of the older person who was being embarrassed in front of a line of customers although I decided to stay of it as I was an invited guest and I did not want to embarrass those who brought me to this establishment.  I can guarantee you I will NEVER go back and I will make sure to get the word out that this establishment has a ZERO for customer service.  First, to have an owner come out of the kitchen and complain about a $4 meal when the line is out the door with customers wanting their good food is absolutely not acceptable in any right mind.  Second, customer service should be a priority as this will bring customers back for continued business irregardless of how good or bad the food may taste.  Third, we are all human beings and we should have respect for mankind. Seriously, the East Valley is known for being a community of kind and respectful citizens although today this has changed with the actions of one human being.  How sad the owner is a Hispanic who has no self respective or much less any respect for customers who are of a Hispanic background.  They should reconsider their actions in order to truly reap the benefits of the difficult economic times and how important customer service falls into play when you are a small business,  CUSTOMER SERVICE was simply horrible although the FOOD was really good.  I feel for the employees of this establishment as they have a boss that fails to have a heart as a human being!!"}
{"text":"Born and raised in Albuquerque New Mexico this place by far has the most Authentic Mexican food! Staff and pricing are amazing so if you're looking for a true Mexican food this is the spot to be!!!!"}
{"text":"I really like this place, I visit often about twice a month.  The food is always fresh and fast and the staff is very pleasant.  I am a vegetarian and they do a great job on the veggie burrito, it's HUGE!  I love the green chili sauce, nice and spicy! I gave 4 stars because the ambiance isn't anything to write about. A few tables, a small patio with a few tables, sometimes they're dirty but I think that's because they are always so busy."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Everything is always delicious and fresh!  Carne asada, grilled chicken, rolled tacos, nachos, burritos are all fantastic! Wish they were open on Sunday's and served beer!  Our favorite Mexican place!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot in Gilbert, I've been here like 6 times now and every time I have something great. The second I saw Fry Bread I knew I had to have it. Their meat here be it the carne asada, the chicken or the pork are all seasoned well and taste incredible. I think the steak (Carne Asada) is the best of the three fry breads I have had. The Chicken tacos the best taco and the Chorizo burrito the best burrito (But I haven't had the carne asada burrito). Nice little place with a free chip/salsa bar and delicous food. If you're in the Gilbert Area and want some delicous food or have been craving Fry Bread you need to come here."}
{"text":"This place must be a local favorite because it was very busy while we were there. And I can see why. The food was fantastic and the portions big. I love that you also get chips and salsa without an extra charge. Happy to have found this place!"}
{"text":"New Mexican Grill is great! I love the food and leave feeling satisfied. pricing is pretty standard compared to other awesome options on the east valley. I love their breakfast burritos most of all - so if you're around during breakfast stop in and grab one. I'm a little bummed that they close up shop so early and sometimes their staff are little aloof. If you order takeout though, expect delicious food! That's what you are sure to get!"}
{"text":"The food is fantastic!  The red sauce and green sauce are made in house and authentically delicious!  I love the machaca beef and the chip and salsa bar."}
{"text":"Food is good, atmosphere is awful. Customer service is bad- forks are so cheap they actually MELT when you put them in the food!!!  And you cant help yourself to another one when this happens (it happened to each of us at a table of 4) because there is a mean sign that says dont touch the forks, we will bring them to you. So sit there for 10 minutes with your melted fork until someone might come by. BTW this place likes to put mean signs everywhere... no kids at the chips, dont do this, dont do that... Seating is virtually none existent, drinks are in front where people are lined up to order or wait for orders, so to get a drink, you must fight your way through a crowd twice.  Last straw, we drove all the way there today to order take out, closed for the heat!!!  Seriously?? I went to work today!!! Went to another place down the street and they gladly took my $40 for chimis just as good!"}
{"text":"By far one of the best places EVER! Food is always amazing. Great flavor, great portions, great prices. There's nothing I can complain about this place. Staff is friendly and nice. My family eats here almost every Friday and we have never had a bad experience. Would recommend to anyone! The only bad thing is we don't live by it, lol great place! Whenever someone is looking for a New Mexican place to eat fast or sit down I always recommend this place"}
{"text":"Worth every star. Chicken crunchy tacos-awesome, cheese enchiladas with red or green sauce-great, green chili pork soup-excellent.  Everything we have ordered has been wonderful.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Every time I come here I leave feeling satisfied. The only downside - they ran out of the posole before we could get any. This place is the real deal for people seeking excellent Mexican food."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by friends. We would have never visited it or knew it was there considering they don't even have signage up outside.  Why wouldn't you?  I love the chicken fry bread!!! Fry bread is delicious.  Yummy!! My husband loves the Juevos Ranchero and Chimichanga   Why did you stop serving breakfast all day?? That was a perk.   I would give this place a 5star on taste, but only a 3star on portion size.  Why do places think you want barely any meat? I feel like they've recently cut back on meat portion.  They aren't super cheap so I don't know what's going on.   I think if they advertised, at least starting with a sign of some sort they would increase business enough to not have to skimp on food portions.  Maybe put a coupon out to let people know you're there.   Also, you need to offer free refills on all beverages, not just Soda. Stay competitive."}
{"text":"I have never been anything but impressed by the food or service at New Mexican Grill. The indian fry bread is good, but the hatch chiles are the real attraction! I absolutely love this place!"}
{"text":"Yummm! I would recommend the chicken and carne asada tacos, fresh grilled meats with good portions."}
{"text":"Some of the food is really good! The chicken enchiladas has some weird stuff added and those weren't great. Tacos are really good and the other enchiladas are good. The red and green chili sauce is very good. I would have given them 4 stars but the lack of some basics in New Mexico food meant I couldn't bring myself to do it. Huevos Ranchos should always be served with beans and hash browns of some sort, and they didn't have Sopapillas. But I'll go back and eat there again for sure.   I'm excited to try their breakfast burritos."}
{"text":"I have no complaints. This is probably the best in the area I've tried so far, super accessible and easy to grab a nice big burrito. The green sauce is my favorite."}
{"text":"The service was good the fry read was really good. The bf seemed to enjoy his chimi. Only a couple of problems. Lack of real dishes (I'm sure due to small size of the place) so cutting my frybread with plastic utensils on a paper plate (not cheap stuff) was a challenge. I'm fairly certain the red sauce was canned but it was tasty anyway. I liked the rice and the ground beef was very well seasoned. I'll come back, definitely."}
{"text":"My husband and sons are huge fans of New Mexican Grill.  Went there today for lunch.  The nachos with carne asada were awesome!  As we were finishing lunch they brought over a bowl of cinnamon  crisps.  What a nice touch!  Definitely worth going the staff is really friendly, the green sauce is amazing and the cost for lunch for 5 was under $50!"}
{"text":"This is a diamond in a coal mine on that intersection. Great food to eat in or take out. All freshly prepared, and very tasty, love their red chili beef sauce, and their grilled tacos. The kids love the fry bread.  They are a great new business in our community, they donate their tips to local non-profit organizations.   Also, did I mention their service is great!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of my most favorite Mexican food restaurants in the area, mostly because it is New Mexican, which is awesome! I lived in New Mexico as a child and finding this place as an adult has been a real treat. I absolutely love the green chile, and the red is also very tasty. My favorite is the Chimichanga with green sauce, but the  fry breads and the breakfast are amazing too."}
{"text":"The first thing you need to know about the New Mexican Grill is the closing time shown on Yelp for Friday night is wrong!  They close at 8:00 pm not 8:30 pm.  I've submitted a correction to Yelp.  This is significant because we were hoping to enjoy a nice visit with friends over dinner and arrived at about 7:40 only to be clearly informed that our dinners would be prepared as take out orders.  I can appreciate closing times, but just stop letting anyone else in once you get close to your closing time.  Allow your customers who arrived well before closing time to enjoy their food without giving it to them in a \"to go bag\" and pointing them toward the door.  They did finally agree to let us unpack our dinners and sit at a table while they swept up around us, significantly diminishing our dining experience.    The second thing to know about the New Mexican Grill is that the name implies that the cooking style is \"New Mexico\" style not that it is a \"New\" Mexican grill.  Get it? New Mexican Grill.    Anyway, other than the cheese quesadilla and grilled chicken tostada, the third thing you need to know us that the food is outstanding!  Given that it is the \"New Mexican Grill\", there are a lot of green chile options, which I love.  I had the chicken chimichanga with green chile sauce and it was superb.  Excellent flavor.  My only complaint with the food is the servings are smaller than expected and the rice and beans were minimal; more of a garnish than sides.  With that said, I will definitely be back to explore more green chile recipes grilled in that wonderful \"New Mexico\" style."}
{"text":"This is seriously good staple Mexican food.  Everything I had was good, and the green sauce was great!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to the other (well-reviewed) location, but the food here is delish!  I had the Pozole and fry bread.  Spicy pork and hominy deliciousness!  Good prices, and my friend enjoyed his dinner of huevos rancheros.  Restaurant itself is a spare, ambiance nothing to write home about, but the folks are super nice and the place is very clean (smells like Fabuloso!) and the food, YUM!  :)  They have a chip bar with a variety of excellent salsas.  And they have Coke Zero in the fountain, my fave!  We will be back for sure. It's a little hard to find, tucked back across from Fitness works, in the strip with Rosati's and Epic Salon.  Currently there's not a sign, just a sandwich board out front."}
{"text":"Words do no justice to how amazing the Machaca Beef Burrito is. Smother that bad boy in their Green Hatch Chili sauce and I am one very happy customer. If I get a water, I can get out of here for around $6, too, so it's not a heavy hit on the wallet. Their Chicken Quesadilla is amazing as well - loaded with cheese, seasoned chicken, onions, cilantro, and some other good stuff that I'm forgetting, and topped with sour cream and guacamole.   I've been here a dozen or so times with coworkers and the service is always very friendly.   Oh, and you get to fill up on chips and homemade salsa while you wait for your food to come out. Om nom nom."}
{"text":"Well, I just got back from a trip to Vegas and have been craving some Mexican food. I came across this place and read a few of the reviews. It sounded great!   I went to check it out, turns out that they were just getting ready to close, and there were a few customers finishing up their meal. The man at the counter seemed nice, but also seemed a little forced. I ordered the #3, 2 chicken enchiladas with rice and beans, and wanted to try the carne asada tacos too. Although the flavors were good and had a nice spice to them, I found some gristle in the chicken. I can over look that. Then the tacos seemed to be overly tough/chewy. I don't know...maybe I just came at a bad time. I'm willing to give this place another try, only I'll be sure to do it while they are not getting ready to close. I'll also post another review upon that time."}
{"text":"Been here several times and will continue to go back. I always love the food and so worth all the little qwerks of a small mom and pop restaurant.   I wish they still served breakfast burritos all day.  It seems like every time I go there, they are closing a little earlier. And it's not uncommon for them to start closing up 30-minutes before the actual closing time, so plan ahead. If you call 15-minutes before they close, good luck getting someone to answer.  Would totally go 5 stars if not for those little things."}
{"text":"We've been to several Mexican restaurants ranging from cheap to expensive. This place tastes more expensive than it is. Made fresh daily and it tastes like it. Awesome awesome  awesome."}
{"text":"I am from Albuquerque and am probably the pickiest Mexican food eater ever, because I am simply spoiled by having grown up with great New Mexican food. There are only a few places that meet the standards here, and this is one of them. It is hidden and only word of mouth, but so worth it. I have only been once, but want to go back to try everything. The Pork Green Chile is sooooo gooood. Seriously, it satisfied my New Mexican food craving. If I can't be there, I have this place to tie me over. I would recommend it to anyone craving real New Mexican food and spice. The staff was also so nice and helpful."}
{"text":"Everything on the menu is great.  Red chili, green chili.  Both amazing.  I really like their fried bread with ground beef Navajo Taco, Christmas style.  The food is everything about New Mexican Grill."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast burritos! Clean place, fast prep but they don't take shortcuts on flavor! Has become out Sat AM tradition!"}
{"text":"I found this place originally by chance. I walked in and absolutely loved the food. I had the chorizo breakfast burrito. All of their food is fresh and homemade! My burrito wasn't greasy, very flavorful and the tortilla was light and delicious. If you dine in, you get their freshly made chips and choice of three salsas. The staff are super friendly and welcoming. It is probably once of the best Mexican restaurants in the valley!"}
{"text":"I've been going to New Mexico since the late 80s.   This food captures the essence/flavor of that wonderful Hatch chili  (should be green) lol Seems like you can only get it in New Mexico.   The New Mexican Grill figured it out somehow :-) I got the open face enchilada with ground beef and cheese  with two eggs over easy on top and green sauce.   I ate all the lettuce and tomatoes LOL you know the little side salad they give you? I never eat that because it's gross wilted and most times and afterthought at best.   This place has such fresh great food the salad was crisp and ice cold! I loved it, it worked well mixed in perfectly with my enchilada.   If you don't see what you want ask the chef he's pretty cool. I didn't see what I wanted on the menu and he was able to guide me through to the most delicious NM meal I've had in a long time.   If you don't want to drive all the way to New Mexico. You don't have to just drive down to Gilbert and check this place out! I promise you if you love New Mexico food it's worth the drive.  I like that I had a really good song paper plate they serve the food on. They also had super sturdy forks and knives don't get me wrong I would much rather have a real plate and real forks and knives but for the price of this place I'll put up with it LOL"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times now and I love this place. Breakfast burritos and carne asada quesadillas are on point. They take credit cards and they have a salsa bar with unlimited chips during lunch time."}
{"text":"Just had the Huevos Rancheros for breakfast. Having grown up in Albuquerque, I'm always excited to try a new New Mexican restaurant. If you're from New Mexico you know how awesome it is to find a new place that serves Hatch chiile. The New Mexican Cafe did not disappoint. The Huevos plate was just like what I used to having back in New Mexico. The place is very clean and you can't beat the price."}
{"text":"What's not to love. Best Green Chile Stew I've ever had! And for $7 to boot. My wife loved the Chimi and I ordered enchiladas with green sauce just to try them. They were as good or better then some restaurants charging twice the price."}
{"text":"I visited New Mexican Grill for the first time last night (Lindsay location), with my sister and two of her kids.  They had all been here previously.  I was very impressed!  The physical location itself is very well kept and quite clean and the huge menu of choices presents itself nicely as you walk in.  The staff were all friendly, attentive and accommodating.  The food is fantastic.  I am an Arizona native and grew up with a mexican family (my mother's best friend), so I've been raised on Sonoran and New Mexico style mexican food.  AZ has its fair share of questionable establishments; believe me, this is NOT one of them.    Everything was prepared at the time of ordering and the freshness of the ingredients plays out very nicely in the dishes.  A hallmark for me, or a gauge by which to judge how good a given restaurant of this nature is, is the quality of their rice and beans.  Absolutely top-notch here.  Carefully prepared and not overly laden with other flavors.    The same can be said throughout their menu.  Even my nephew was very impressed.  He's not a pro (yet), but he is in a culinary program and is highly aware of kitchen procedures, health guidelines, etc.  The kitchen here is open and can be readily seen, so he noted several things that he noticed and was impressed by.  Everything from the state of the kitchen, to food prep to how good the actual food was.  All in all, very well done!  Give them a shot, you won't be disappointed.  I'm also a bit of a chorizo aficionado, so I think I may return there this morning and have some breakfast!  :D"}
{"text":"This place is really good. My father-in law told me about it we drove by it like three times. Finally, we realized that the place had no signage. Then we decided to try it, WOW! It's was awesome! So delicious, so much flavor. Personally, get the green chili pork, totally worth it. Did I mention they have fry bread, and they are reasonably priced. It's like chipolte meets filibertos. Meaning great food, simple decor.  You serve your own chips too."}
{"text":"This place was recommended from a friend....   Drove 20 min to try it as my bf is from Silver City New Mexico so we were excited to try it and have some green chili!   I ordered a pork green chili fry bread, my bf ordered the carne asada fries.   Nice little place. Food was ehhh...  Chunky red salsa was really good.  Fry bread was ok. Fry bread was huge but lacking flavor; so I've had better. My bf's carne asada fries were something else. 0/10 we saw as they microwaved them. If you're particular about microwaved food, you know it gives it a different taste. They tasted like left overs and mind you the microwave takes the crunch away from the fries. The meat tasted like old leftovers as well. Super crunchy or just super chewy depending on the bite.  They have free refills which is a plus right (sarcasm)"}
{"text":"This review is solely about their 'Navajo' taco.. aka \"Indian Fry Bread\".  I've only had this dish (carne asada) here and probably will stick to ordering this as it is plentiful, tasty, and repeatedly enjoyable. My sis ordered their pork 'fry bread' and I was disappointed because I asked the chef guy if it was shredded and he said yes (me thinks he don't know what he be takin' bout) ... it was cubed and not as flavorful as my carne asada.. mine was delish! The young girl at the front was nice and their place seems really clean and since it's finally a locally owned restaurant that *doesn't* suck in S Chandler (everything around here is a chain), I am officially a FAN :)"}
{"text":"Awesome NM cuisine. Had the stew and enjoyed every drop. Sweat factor high if you like. Los Dos, there's competition in the valley!"}
{"text":"We were visiting Phoenix and Gilbert from out-of-state and our friend pointed us to this restaurant for easy-going New Mexican food. The food and atmosphere is more for lunch and is a simpler version of may be a Baja Fresh or La Salsa, which is okay for lunch or an easy dinner.  The food was good and pleasant. The waitress Sharon was awesome though and was the life the restaurant once you started eating. She was helpful and got extra dressing for us.  The day we were there, the tea machine and horchata drinks were not working--only the soda machine. We got a Bavarian Creme-filled Churro for the road and that was delicious!  For the money, I felt it was a few bucks too much for what you get. In California, you could get similar Mexican food for cheaper which is why I dropped it a star."}
{"text":"I'm from southern New Mexico and I was feeling homesick so I went here hoping to get some more traditional southern NM food as opposed to the AZ Mexican food that fills this area. I was not disappointed at all. I had the green chile pork burrito plate and I also got some posole for later. Food was perfect, exactly what I was hoping for. I took my order to go and it was ready fairly quickly and everyone was so nice! Also their chips and hot salsa are fantastic! Very satisfied"}
{"text":"We were running errands in the Gilbert area and this restaurant came up in our Yelp Search. It's a pretty small restaurant but it wasn't too busy when we had gone in.  I ordered the #6 Combination Plate (which is as follows: grilled chicken burrito with pico de gallo, beans, guacamole, cheese smothered with Hatch Chile sauce and topped with sour cream) with only rice and my date got the #6 Combination Plate (which is: three Carne Asada tacos with onion, cilantro, tomatillo salsa) with rice and beans.  While we were waiting for our food, we enjoyed some free chips and salsa from their complimentary chips and salsa bar for dine-in customers. They had three types of salsa - a pico de gallo style, a green chile one, and a hot salsa. All were equally delicious ... the hot salsa definitely had a big kick to it and the other two salsas were really flavorful.  As far as the food goes, the burrito was really really big ... way bigger than I had expected it was going to be. I had ordered it smothered in the green chile sauce, which I thought was just okay but the chicken, beans, guacamole, and sour cream made for a delicious combination. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I tried a bite of the Carne Asada tacos and they were really good as well - they had the perfect amount of onions & cilantro to compliment but not overpower the meat.  Also, the price was definitely right. I paid $8  and some change for my giant meal, half of which was leftover. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Excellent Mexican food the salsa is spot-on perfect I would eat a shoe covered in it. Try the chili rellenos or the tacos all great beans and rice are perfect together."}
{"text":"Pretty good chow here and a great place to go for Sat and Sun breakfast particularly if you sit outside on a nice day.  It is removed from the road a bit so it is more relaxing without having all of the cars buzzing by.  They have Posole on the weekends that is pretty darn good.  If you get it with the fry bread it is even better.  They have good breakfast burritos but I find them to be of varying quality.  Sometimes I go and they are moist and flavorful and other times they are a bit dry.  When they are right they are some of the best i've had.     I tried their Chile Relleno and the the green sauce they use with it is wonderful but portion size was a little small.  Nachos are loaded up nicely and also good.    In regard to the style it is a \"order up front\" place where they will then bring food to the table.  You serve your own drinks and grab your own chips but depending on who is helping you, you may get some refills from the wait staff.  Not a place to take a date but certainly a good joint to grab some good chow with some nice flavor."}
{"text":"I had heard some great recommendations about this restaurant and decided to try it yesterday morning, and everything surpassed my expectations. Ralph, the owner, is always around the restaurant to talk to customers and make sure that everything they've ordered is up to their liking, and the food is phenomenal. Haven't been for lunch or dinner yet, but the breakfast burritos are definitely worth going there for."}
{"text":"Pleasant welcome by Sherri and Damian. Tried carne adovada, machaca and green chile. Straight cash New Mexico! Too far for Sadie's in Albuquerque so now you have your new local NM Mexican joint. Give it a try.....you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Excellent fast casual Mexican food. HUGE portions enough for two meals. We will definitely be back for more deliciousness!"}
{"text":"Really a fan of the chille relleno here.  Get it with carne asada and covered in green sauce, mmmmm. Not a fan of the new closing at 5 pm on Saturday :("}
{"text":"Quaint \"little\" grill with good eats and cozy seats. Food is really good, fresh and fast. My youngest loves it. Have had half the menu and love everything from the chimis to the sopapillas. Wish they had more drinks I offer and there could be more space. They are always busy when I go. Service is always polite and have had many good recommendations."}
{"text":"My favorite New Mexican Restaurant has always been Los Dos Molinos in Mesa, which I still like a lot.  However, since I live in Chandler and this restaurant is only 2 miles from my house, it has become our new favorite.  We love the fresh \"help yourself\" salsa bar which has some of the best and most flavorful sauces I have ever tasted.  The food portions are very large, so we have started ordering off of the a la cart menu.  Everything seems to be made from scratch, and if you love tacos - be sure and try their machaca beef taco or their shredded chicken taco.   This location is very, very clean and you can tell management really cares about you as a customer."}
{"text":"Went here with my fiance this past weekend, was a little difficult to find at first, but definitely worth doing so.  Had the fry bread with Machaca (and red hatch chili sauce) and the combination of flavors was absolutely amazing. The frybread was perfectly crisp on the outside, and very pillowy inside, and actually remained so as it cooled down.  All of the ingredients were very fresh, and everything was very wonderfully flavored. The machaca was just perfectly spicy and their red chili sauce added a perfect bit of kick to the whole dish.  I'm definitely excited to go back and try some of their other offerings, especially the green chili and pork. All food was very reasonably priced, and nothing seemed small enough to make you feel lacking (and if that were a problem, unlike most other places of a similar scale, they do have chips and salsa while you wait) Plus, any place that serves breakfast all day is already streets ahead to me."}
{"text":"I've been eating here since they first opened and have always loved the food and service is good. A couple of weeks ago I had to work late so decided to call for take out.  I looked the number up on my phone and placed my order.  When I arrived the young man said he didn't have my order; he said \"you probably called the Gilbert Rd store\". He showed me the number and I had. So, I asked if he could make the order for me and he said; \"no you ordered from the other one and you have to go there.\" I told him I live in the other direction and would call the other store to cancel and again he refused to make the order for me. He said \"it will take you just as long to drive down Gilbert as it will for us to make it so go there\". I was appalled!!! It was 8pm and I had just worked a 12 hour shift and now I had to go 3 miles out of my way.  I realize it was my mistake but the way I was treated was unacceptable. I always enjoyed going there for lunch; Ralph and the day staff are very pleasant but I won't go back.  Also, they now serve on paper plates and use plasticware.  Prices have risen, portions are smaller and now we have to eat on paper.....I don't think so!  I have many colleagues who feel the same; these prices are not fast food paper prices.  Good way to lose business; it's a shame that a great place is going downhill."}
{"text":"Amazing chile rellanos!  This is the place to get authentic New Mexico style green chile dishes.    Their fry bread is delicious as either a taco or dessert.  I haven't had a bad meal here.  They offer chips and great salsa if you eat in.  My family loves this place and it is our go to mexican place.    It is tucked away in a corner of a strip mall that you can't see from the street.  It is a great find and once you know where it is you will keep coming back."}
{"text":"Did not disappoint!!  First time having fried bread, \"sope\" style and it offered a different vehicle for the traditional toppings of a tostada- fried to order and as huge as it was, we ate everything-  The chimichanga offered the New Mexico flavors we were hoping for!! It came with a spice red sauce snd there homemade Hatch sauce- first time trying Hatch, and im in love !!"}
{"text":"After being suggested to this place a handful of times by my  brother, my family and I went this past Sunday after church.  WOW!  Living in Santa Fe for three years, we knew what to expect with \"New Mexican\" styled food.  It was right on the money.  None of us realized how much we had missed the flavor!  Everything we ordered was delicious (huevos rancheros, posole, tamales, enchiladas, burros, fry bread & the tortillas!).  The owner was extremely friendly.  Service and food was great.  I have easily told 5-7 people about this place since yesterday afternoon.  We were ready to go back for dinner that night!  A must try. Little hard to find as it doesn't have a sign on the building.  But worth the search :)"}
{"text":"on my first visit I enjoyed the place.  The chile relleno was good, the beans and rice were good.  My friend loves the beef taco plate.  We will try this place again."}
{"text":"The food here is outstanding! It's one of those places where you want to try everything on the menu but also want the delicious thing you ordered the last time you ate here! Their salsa is the best I have ever tasted and we order it to go sometimes just to enjoy for a day or two at home. The only downside I can think of is its a little small and there's not a lot of seating but the food well makes up for that. Service is prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"My wifes favorite New Mexican restaurant. We love their green salsa. Breakfast burritos are great as well. Their service could be better but in general they are pretty quick and nice!"}
{"text":"I came here last week to try out the huevos rancheros that my dad and sister claimed to love. I had been to New Mexico Grill once before for an ok bean burrito so I figured the huevos rancheros would be a safe bet.  Much to my dismay, neither the red or green sauce was vegetarian. My only other options were a quesadilla or bean burrito so I went with another burrito. Again, it was ok. I used lots of the thin, red salsa to add some spice. I was very disappointed with their salsa verde though. Normally I prefer it to red, but theirs was so bland.  To my father's dismay, the rice wasn't ready yet so he couldn't sub the potatoes with it like he usually does. I don't blame him since the breakfast potatoes are just disgusting. I'd bet dollars to donuts that the flavorless cubes come straight from a freezer bag. I'm not sure why the rice wasn't ready yet just like I couldn't understand why they didn't have chips out either.   What really angered me about this place is how I was treated when I asked for corn tortillas for my husband's chorizo scramble. My husband is newly gluten intolerant, and he forgot to ask for corn tortillas instead of flour (maybe it would have been helpful if the cashier asked). When I asked for the corn tortillas, the cashier wanted to charge me $2.59 for three small tortillas! It's ridiculous for two reasons: 1. I'm sure they buy them from Food City for $1/dozen like I do. They definitely aren't made in house. 2. Why can't they show a little customer courtesy by happily giving us a substitution? Instead, the manager demanded that I bring him back the unused flour ones before he would replace them. Why? Was he planning on serving them to someone else?  After this terrible treatment, I won't be the least bit sorry if this place goes out of business. They must be having financial troubles if they are cutting this many corners."}
{"text":"Lunch.  Small spot.  Very friendly staff. Green chili stew was great. Best I've had in AZ. Comes with fry bread that was ok.  Will be back."}
{"text":"I'm from CA and was looking for Mexican food, this was not exactly what I was looking for, but better. Great food."}
{"text":"Unlimited chips!! The fried bread is very good! The toppings are all tasty and the portions are generous."}
{"text":"New Mexican Grill has the best Mexican style food in the East Valley...hands down.  My wife and I have lived in the Gilbert area for so long and have never been to any place that has the flavor, quality and genuine value that New Mexican Grill has.  We hope to make this a regular place for us as Gilbert is starving for great places like this.  The menu is fantastic with great meats from green chile pork to carne asada.  All of them with their own unique flavor.  The owners/management is friendly and truly cares to make their restaurant excellent in every aspect.  From breaklfast burritos, to fry bread, to great homemade salsas, everything about this place keeps me coming back for more.  Stop wasting your time at other places and make this your only stop in the East Valley for great food!"}
{"text":"So I found New Mexico grill via Yelp. You know I has to be good when you get there and there is a line out the door. Ordered the Green Chile stew w/fried bread and found a nice seat outside. It came pretty quickly, it look and smelled excellent.  My first bite caught me off guard because of the spice. But once I embraced it, I have to say it is extraordinary. The chunks of pork, soaking up the broth and potatoes and chile is excellent. I look forward to coming back and trying  something else!"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb. The ONLY reason I am giving it four stars is because they are pretty greedy with the hot sauce and we LOVE their hot sauce. The green burrito is off the hook and my husband (who is VERY picky about chorizo) says it's yhebest he's ever had. It's not greasy at all. Highly recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"The wife and I have been searching for a good Mexican joint since we moved to AZ seven months ago. Until today, we hadn't had any luck. (My wife is from West Texas, so we're a little picky about our Mexican food.)  We absolutely loved this place. I had the chorizo breakfast, she had the machaca breakfast, and we shared a bowl of pozole. It was all amazing. It tasted like a party in our bocas!    This is definitely our new Sunday morning hangover breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"The best new Mexico hatch green chile I've tasted so far. Love the dry bread smothered pork burrito. If you love green chile this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Really cool to find Fry Bread in the east valley! And once again...yay they satisfied a vegetarian!! Three salsas mild and hot and hot!! If you like hot, you have to try the hot red salsa!! Good for you meat eaters and vegetarians! We will be back  Visit #2-hatch green Chile is VERY good! Offers breakfast and vegetarian options...yay!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, and the prices aren't too bad either. I had the bean, cheese, rice, and guac burrito. Super yummy."}
{"text":"If you're looking for authentic Mexican food this isn't the place. I got a beef tostada, side of rice and a side of sour cream. The beef has a strange taste to it, maybe it's how it's seasoned. I can't put my finger on it but something is really off. The people are really friendly and the food came out fast. It's just not good Mexican food. I've had better food from food trucks. But I think it's safe to say that I won't be back."}
{"text":"Went for dinner tonight and was very impressed. This place may not be fancy but it serves up some of the best green chile i have ever eaten. I have tried chile all over the southwest and this ones right up there. Fast friendly service and great chips and salsa. I hope more people find this place because it deserves to be a valley staple."}
{"text":"Update: So it's noon, and we order breakfast burritos, only to be told they no longer sell breakfast past 10 am. Let me be clear, this is not transitioning from French toast and pancakes to burgers and pasta, where I can understand not serving breakfast all day. This is Mexican food. And for a place that is called \"New Mexican Grill\" they should know that breakfast from \"breakfast burrito\" is a relative term and they are served ALL day in New Mexico (we're from there - we would know). People eat burritos for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  They just lost a large client base. We've been going there for years and we won't be back. It's just a bad way to do business, and as a result I assume he will sacrifice a large client base."}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican food i ever had....period. I had the Chicken Burrito with rice and it was better than excellent"}
{"text":"My first time here was yesterday and it will NOT be my last!  I love New Mexico style food and this place satisfies my craving for it.  This is close to home, too so it will become a regular stop for me.  Had the machaca beef burrito and the meat was tender and seasoned so well.  Love the green and regular salsa, too.  So glad my friend found you!"}
{"text":"Fish tacos were awesome especially with two fried eggs over medium...customers from outside of town visiting on business also enjoyed the food there!"}
{"text":"We came here hoping to have some frybread with our dinner. When I ordered, they said there was only one frybread left and they weren't going to make more, even if I waited. Um, okay. It didn't seem busy until a few minutes after I arrived. Unless you're paying attention, you'll walk right past the place to order. It got pretty crowded at the entryway with several people arriving. I'll update this review once I have had my dinner. This visit was for takeout."}
{"text":"Different to what I am used to in New Mexico, but great for Arizona. When I first went here by myself, I ordered the Tamale by itself. It was lunch time and I didn't want too much. Wow. The tamale was masa steams served under pork meat with chile.  Very different and very good.   Later I went with dh. I really wanted chile cheese fries, but knew I needed a buddy to eat them with me. The portion was HUGE! Dh and I shared the fries that had everything on it. The meat was great and cooked crispy. The chile was Christmas and was really a great combination. We also had ordered carne adovada plates.   We had so much food we did not have enough room on the table. We finally just asked for a box and boxed up our dinners. We had chile fries we could not finish. That was more than enough for the 2 of us.   Now, I know some people are thinking the dinners are not good after taking home. They are quite good after for left overs! The leftover dinners were quite tasty.   We spoke to the bus boy and he said he and his girlfriend share one meal. Next time we plan to do that. We are newbies!   Next time we go we plan to go for breakfast in search of the closest thing to NM for a breakfast burrito."}
{"text":"Great homemade chorizo! Non-pretentious place. Not a great location, but were steadily busy. My husbands chicken burrito plate with green sauce was freakin delicious! We can't wait to try more stuff. I was excited to see they had green chile cheese corn tamales, it's been a while since I had a good one, so high hopes to get my chompers on those. A little pricey on the dozen tamales ($18.99) but must be good, right? We were there early so they didn't have the chips made for the day, but their salsas packed a lot of flavor. Nice people, good food, solid place!"}
{"text":"Seriously some of the best tasting flavorful Mexican food around. I'm in love with this place. Sooooo good! I got the carne and pollo asada tacos."}
{"text":"Great food and service. From chips & salsa bar (best salsa!) to the entrees to the complimentary dessert chips (fried flour dusted in cinnamon sugar). We loved it all!"}
{"text":"If you want delicious Mexican food for a fair price, look no further. This place has amazing green chile and yes you might as well slather it on anything you order here. It's worth it! Big portions, great service and prices."}
{"text":"I liked the food, but the space was small. Service was okay, but not exceptional. Food came out fresh, but not at the same time."}
{"text":"We eat here pretty much weekly. My husband was born and raised in Albuquerque; I lived there for 7 years so we are super picky regarding green/red chile. The green chile is HOT (recently especially) but it's so tasty. I love the red equally so I do 'Christmas' (that's green and red!) on my food. Try the chicken burrito, the ground beef burrito, carne asada tacos, chorizo breakfast plate (order any time), chile rellenos, and if you can spare some calories, the fry bread. Free chips and salsa. Note to iced tea drinkers: it's the gold peak stuff but they do offer unsweetened. Fresh brewed tea would make a good upgrade one day. I hope you enjoy it!!"}
{"text":"This place has fresh made to order Mexican dishes.   Casual dinner atmosphere.  Very friendly staff.  New Mexican Grill is my new fav Mexican restaurant!"}
{"text":"These guys sell some good a** frybread! Fish tacos are delish too. Haven't tried much else since we usually only go when we want frybread."}
{"text":"Holy deliciousness!! We tried this place for the first time after I was having some serious cravings for Mexican food & this came up in the search & had decent reviews. Well I can tell you I'm SO glad we decided to try it. Seriously the best place for southwestern style Mexican food we have been to since we've lived in AZ (going on 3yrs now).   I got the pork stew with green chile sauce & 3 rolled tacos. The stew was incredible & so filling I could only eat half. It's loaded with if chunks of pork, potatoes, corn & lots of other delicious things. The rolled tacos were so fresh & perfectly crispy but not overly greasy like some places. My husband had a #8 which was similar in taste to my stew but had smaller chunks of meat & no potatoes. It came with rice & beans which he said were the BEST rice & beans he's ever had which is saying a lot. We got a kids meal with a crispy chicken taco for our daughter & she loved it too & ate almost everything on her plate which is rare these days with her picky taste.   All in all it was definitely 5 stars worth & we will be frequenting here often, even if it's just for takeout because the place is TINY & busy but well worth any wait. YUMMMMMM!"}
{"text":"Taste of the food is the best around but $8 for a burrito smaller than my cell phone? No thanks"}
{"text":"Having lived in Albuquerque for many years my wife and I love New Mexican food.  The place is a gem!  The green chili sauce is unbelievably good!  Breakfast burritos (chorizo is my favorite) smothered in green chili are phenomenal.  Their posole is wonderful too.  Huevos Rancheros, sopapillas oh my!  This is some of the tastiest stuff I've found in Arizona."}
{"text":"Just found my go to mexican food place there food is amazing and you get alot for your money very tasty food can't wait to go back and try more of there dishes definitely a must try it's delicious :)"}
{"text":"Hole in the wall restaurant. Authentic Mexican food. Warning the hot sauce is actually hot"}
{"text":"I love this place. My work is a few offices down and have been going here for a few months. Very reasonable prices and staff are friendly. I love the shredded beef rolled tacos. My husband had the carne asada burrito with the green sauce. He loved the flavones and burrito did not have fillers like some other places. Very authentic. Chips and salsa good and fresh."}
{"text":"I never post reviews but this place is review worthy! I'm a NM NATIVE so a taste of home is always nice!! That is exactly what I got!! Amazing frybread epic red and green chile!! I'm in love with this place and the owner is such a sweet heart to my daughter!!!"}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of New Mexico style Mexican food and especially the infamous green hatch chiles.  I never noticed this place before but found it on Yelp and its just down the street! The place looked extremely clean and the man that took my order helped me decide on what to get and was very helpful.  I went with the # 4 (green chile pork burrito smothered with hatch green chile sauce) and and the fry bread with carne asada.  The green chile was very tasty, I did expect more heat; but was still good nonetheless.  The fry bread was very soft but the carne asada to me lacked a little taste. Maybe it was an old batch?  Being an avid carne asada maker and eater, I know that the seasoning does it all; this was was subpar.  I'm anxious to try other things on the menu, and I also left without getting my bottled Coke that I had paid for. :("}
{"text":"The food here are amazing!!!  It was recommended by my coworker so one Friday evening after discussion with hubby \"What do you want to eat tonight, and he said No Chinese please...\" I took him here. First sign, the place is small, clean, and was pretty full. ..there was a line to order.  That was a good sign. Second sign, you can see the people working in the kitchen when you made it to the counter to order  and they were  so busy but professional. The place is clean, the guy behind the counter was  very polite. And the lady who brought food to us was very nice and attentive. The place feels like a family own restaurant. I will be back."}
{"text":"I've had my share of fry bread but boy oh boy!!!  This was the best I've had outside the reservation.  Hubby got green chili and I ordered ground beef.  Not greasy and full of flavor!!  This is a small place with. Few tables inside and a cute outside patio.  Posole on Saturday and you can get a tortilla or fry bread with it??  SOLD!"}
{"text":"Authentic homemade and fresh! Truly amazing food. If you've ever been to Santa Fe, NM and miss the food - red/green chile - look no further as New Mexican Grill will not disappoint."}
{"text":"im on this chile relleno kick. they are so dang good, people.   first of all, this place is a little difficult to find. they are next to Natalia's.  I drove right past them the first time and almost gave up until I called to figure out their location. there's no signage with their business name listed at the shopping center's entrance and there's also no signage above their front door.  just look for natalia's.   the meals are huge! it's like $8. it comes with amazing rice, beans, and your spectacular cheese stuffed green chile smothered in red or green sauce. you get a fantastic tortilla on the side (which i save to make a burro out of the leftovers the next day).   you get warm chips and salsa with your meal as well.   it's an order at the entrance, sit down and get your own salsa type of environment. very casual. very delicious. very affordable."}
{"text":"FOOD: We had been once before and the Pasole was awesome! The service was not bad and the green chile rocks.  The Indian Bread Taco had hardly any pork or red chile.  We were disappointed.  The Green chile stew was hot and delicious. The food depending on what you order I would give it between a 3-4.      SERVICE:  Service-on a scale of 1-5, it's about a 1.  Last week we went on a Friday evening not realizing how early they closed.  It was about 15 minutes to 8:00pm and the waitress who rung up our order was very short when we asked about the menu options. AFTER she took our order, she made it very clear that they were closing in 5 minutes.  Had we known this before we place our order we would have walked out.  The chips and salsa  CRUMBS were out and the salsa was almost empty. They made it beyond clear that they wanted us to hurry up and leave.  There were two other customers eating when we sat down.  The other customer later asked the gal behind the counter for more salsa (which by now had already been put away) and she said again stated that the reason they put it away is because they are closed.  They also asked us to refill our drinks so they can shut the soda machine off.    Being in the food business myself, I know this one thing-poor customer service will ruin a business.  Staff should be as courteous to their first customer as they are to the last one.  The salsa container should remain out until the LAST customer leaves.  If they close at 8, then they should allow the customers at least 30-45 minutes to finish their dinner without feeling rushed. Service with a smile and staff should  accommodate customer requests without an attitude.  I get the chips being empty, but a sign maybe could state that due to the freshness of the chips, the last batch will be put out at 7PM-sorry for any inconvenience?  Also, I saw at least 2 car loads of customers drive up while we were eating and leave when they saw they were now closed-what a missed opportunity for business!  I know I was not the only unsatisfied customer that evening cause the other lady was quite vocal at the staff lack of customer service.  I was talking with a neighbor and surprisingly she had the SAME experience! Except they mopped while she ate.  I couldn't believe it and on two different occasions.  Lots of potential-but the service killed it for me.  Maybe I will just  return for take out."}
{"text":"My most recent experience with new Mexican Grill is a blend of good food and good customer service due to the manager Sydney addressing my concerns.  The food at new Mexican Grill is generally very good. We decided to go there on Friday night. My husband ordered a carne Asada burrito, but they forgot to put the carne inside the burrito. I called the next morning and spoke to the manager about my concern. She was very nice and promptly addressed the mistake.   I would recommend going here as their food is good, they offer free chip with your meal, and clearly are also committed to good customer service which I much appreciate.  If you do go, try the green chili Ground beef enchiladas. They are very good, some of the best I had and they carry a spicy kick"}
{"text":"Fantastic!! Had the green chilie pork once and the pork chimichanga another time. Great. And the salsa was amazing! The green salsa was the best I've ever had....just something about it. And the second time (not so much on the first) the pico was awesome. One of the few things I found in Phoenix area worth writing home about!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend this place to anyone who's looking for some quick, cheap Mexican food.   Out of all the different things i have tried, the carne asada burrito is by far my favorite! It's always hot and juicy and you can actually taste the steak's flavor. I suggest getting it without the guac and beans (so that leaves you with the meat, pico de gallo, and cheese) because in my opinion, those 2 things weaken the flavor and order it \"dry\" (no sauce).   The burritos, regardless of which one you order, are an excellent size. They're always stuffed full with the perfect tortilla-filling ratio. A lot of other places tend to have the tortilla rolled to where you get nothing but tortilla itself when you bite into it half the time. Plus, their tortillas rock! I don't know if they're made from scratch or bought, but they are delicious!  The fry bread is also great. I always order the sugar & honey one, but I don't use that much honey with it. I think it's too sweet, but the fry bread is delicious with just the powder sugar.   Staff is always very nice and welcoming. Even if you don't know what you want right away, they'll patiently wait until you are. The chips and salsa are self-serve. You can choose between 3 different salsas, but I always stick to the mild because the other 2 lack flavor in my opinion. The only problem I have with the salsa is that at times it's very watery. I remember I went once with a friend and the salsa was very watered down. We had to basically scrape our chips on the bottom of the salsa bowl to get any chunks of tomato.   Overall, I've always been fairly satisfied with each visit. If you're ever nearby, give it a try!"}
{"text":"First off, I will let everyone know that this location is WAY BETTER than the Lindsay location. The atmosphere inside is 100% Southwestern. Lots of cool colors and they have booth seating UNLIKE the store atmosphere of the Lindsay Avenue location. Now, for the food. We had ordered the weekend special Pozole. $6.99. With awesome fry bread. When we ordered it, the manager came over to us (guy manager) and told us that they were out of Pozole because it had been a busy day and offered to make us fresh Pozole and also said if we would want a snack like Nachos and he would take care of it. That was very nice! He said we could have any meat we wanted. We chose Machaca ( dried shredded beef). It was a huge order. It had cheese, Machaca, guacamole, beans, sour cream and poco de gallo. It was DELICIOUS!  We of course wanted to save room for the Pozole so we boxed it up and ate the Pozole. It was Fresh and hot! Came with onion and cilantro mix. Was very good and we WILL return due to the food and great customer service. Thank you guy manager! It was appreciated. It was worth the wait for the Fresh Pozole"}
{"text":"This is an order at the counter type place. 3 of us ate for $22 so not bad. They have complimentary chips for those who dine in- but they tasted stale.  I got a breakfast burrito with potato, egg & cheese. It was pretty big & tasted great. Everyone in my party was happy with their food.  The inside dine in area is small but They do have an outdoor earring area."}
{"text":"The most authentic New Mexican food my husband and I have been able to find since moving to Tempe from Albuquerque.  We have been struggling to find good green chile dishes around here, and the breakfast burrito here FINALLY hit the spot.  The spice isn't as strong as we are used to, but the flavor is right on.  A little hint of sweetness to the chile was something we weren't used to but overall loved this place! It's a tiny place but the portions were huge.  We each had a bacon breakfast burrito smothered in the green chile.  Next time we could definitely share.  The tortillas are homemade and taste incredible.  The kids meal was a little pricey but it was nice to find something simple our kid would eat (a quesadilla ca'e with rice, beans and a drink)."}
{"text":"Ok, so if you are coming here for service with a smile, a warm hug and an inviting atmosphere...keep on driving. If you are coming here for excellent Mexican food at a reasonable price with huge portions - this is the place! We don't live in Gilbert, in fact we don't even live close to Gilbert - we are in the very far north valley and will drive 45 minutes to eat this delicious food!  The services leaves a little to be desired and the store front is very basic and small, but there is plenty of outdoor seating. The burritos are excellent, enchiladas delicious (plenty of cheese), both red and green are good, stuffed sopaipilla was out of this world. My two year olds quesadilla was one of the best I have ever had. Oh and the cinnamon sugar chips....mmmmmazing. Sure, your blood sugar might go into the high 300s, but they are totally worth it - warm, crispy, sweet goodness. All four of us ate with drinks and desert for less than $30 - you just can't beat it. This ad has been officially endorsed by a born and raised New Mexican who knows Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for the first time today. The staff is very friendly, prices are great, and the food is quite tasty. I picked up the Green Chillies and Egg breakfast burrito. For $5 this thing is packed full and fresh. The atmosphere in the restaurant is relaxed and inviting, and the staff was smiling and helpful even at 7:30am. I will definitely return to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Good food, good price. Flavorful with fresh ingredients. Street Tacos were good but nothing new. Beef Machaca Burrito with green sauce was big and very tasty."}
{"text":"Super fast service and the food was great! I had the carne asada green chile burrito, my husband had the carne asada nachos, and our kids split the carne asada fry bread. The portions were pretty large and the prices were great. We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"WOW! In a city surrounded by blah... this food is amazing. We recently moved here from Austin, TX where the food scene is on point. So glad to have a strong food option when making dinner decisions.  My wife and I LOVE New Mexico and have traveled through and visited multiple times after spending the night in Santa Fe for our 1st anniversary 17 years ago. We LOVE authentic New Mexican food and have our favorites in both Taos and Santa Fe.  To find a a delicious restaurant in Gilbert and it be New Mexican Cuisine was a gift. Their Salsa Bar was wonderful offering three different options. SO Good.  I'm a sucker for a Chile Relleno and there's was fantastic. I had the carne asada add on and I can't wait to have it again. Will be back!"}
{"text":"SO happy we found this little hole in the wall right near our house. The prices can't be beat and the food is amazing!! Management was SO polite and helpful to my family. Every time we have come in we feel like we are treated like family!   The chorizo breakfast burrito is one of my favorites. We used to go to The Coffee Shop for burritos but we just found food that is 10x better for 1/2 the price!   This is definitely a spot we have added to our regular digs."}
{"text":"This is without question the best Mexican/southwest food I've eaten, maybe ever. I ordered the smothered chicken burrito, green sauce. The sauce was perfectly spiced, the chicken was tender, and it was HUGE. The rice was light and delicious, and the beans...omg. Do yourself a favor and give this spot a try, you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"The food here is really terrific! I ordered the Machaca breakfast plate and traded out Chorizo for the shredded beef. What a great choice. The little potatoes and refried beans and great tasting coffee were the perfect combination.  My wive had the Huevos Rancheros and she said it was amazing!  The food here is very fresh and prepared with care. The tortillas a the only thing not prepared in house, but the recipe used is that of the owners mom. They were really good.  I am SO happy that we finally found a great Mexican restaurant place near by to head to on the weekends for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Based on another review, I tried the machaca chimichanga. I tried half green and half red sauce. I'd recommend the green, very tasty! My husband enjoyed the quesadilla but didn't prefer the taste of the #10. All the ingredients were quality and the service was friendly. We will be back."}
{"text":"Well, we have been here twice, the first time we did not eat there because we could not find it, as it has no outside signage!!!  Then I came home and called and they said oh yea we don't have a sign but we are right next door to Natalies.  okay so we go back a couple of weeks later, my daughter had the bean & cheese burrito and she gave it 4 stars it was plentiful and the salsa from the bar really sealed the deal.  I had the fry bread with sugar and honey and it was delish!!!  We will definitely go back again!  I would recommend this to anybody as it is clean, friendly and free chips and salsa and of course the food was VERY good!  The only thing is they need a marquee at the top of their restaurant or some kind of sign, unless you know right where it's at you will miss it!"}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE! Me and my boyfriend's go to place when we want to go out to eat! Very casual and the food is amazing! Definitely get anything smothered in their green chili!"}
{"text":"I really like this place, excellent food!! Love their green sauce,  good salsa bar, great green chili sauce. Our favorite New Mexican food in the area. Always fresh and seems like they are always cleaning everywhere when we visit, I always like seeing that. Staff is friendly as well.."}
{"text":"Omg super delicious! My sister and I were driving around looking for a good Mexican spot and came across these guys on yelp. Definitely worth the 45 min drive. Very delicious and the place is very clean. Great customer service! I'd definitely try them again"}
{"text":"Rolled Tacos, Cheese Enchiladas are absolutely perfect. The only reason I give this 4 stars is that the location on Lindsay is small and crowded, and the other location closed.  I need to go back and try some other options, but I always seem to fall back on these two options....."}
{"text":"Stopped by at 7 this morning to grab a breakfast burrito for my son only to realize they don't open until 8 on Saturdays. The owner saw me and was kind enough to whip the burrito up for me. Greatly appreciated."}
{"text":"After seeing this place reviewed a few times by my friends, I finally convinced my family we needed to give it a try.  It was much more 'hole-in-the-wall' than I expected, but my husband reminded me that some of the best places are.  I had the carne asada fry bread with green sauce. I didn't love the meat, but the sauce was the perfect level of spiciness for me. My husband ordered machaca with red sauce and said his was kind of bland.   The self-serve chips and salsa were surprisingly good considering they were sitting under a heat lamp. I wouldn't call the service bad, just more laid back than I'm used to while eating out.  It was kind of hard to tell who worked there and who was just hanging out watching the game on the television."}
{"text":"Love thier season beef! Great little place. They do seem to run out of food anytime after 7/730. But great food."}
{"text":"This was pretty good. We tried a fry bread, burrito, and quesadilla. Good green Chile, but the fry bread itself and meat was very salty. Ate half and called it a day. Small restaurant, but if it's mild weather there is more seating outside."}
{"text":"Horrible Management regarding Customer Service. Their food is awesome (stars: 5) but the manager has limited customer service skills demonstrated (stars: 2). Without us buying food at the place, he is nothing. You don't ever tell a customer 'I told you before...'. The worst part was, he walked away AS he was talking to the customer. Unacceptable. If you're frustrated, then leave the building the rest of the day, because every time that manager is there when I come in during the last three of the last six times, the manager says rude things to others and the employees don't have smiles. I get frustrated as I know what customer service is about. I feel for the employees too. They even look unhappy when he's there and stressed. No one wants to work in those conditions. The place is Much more pleasant when the manager is gone. The atmosphere is happier and the customer experience is excellent when he is gone. Please get a new manager that knows what customer service is all about, and demonstrates it consistently. Let the people do their jobs rather than micromanaging what you taught them to do. The young blonde girl at the counter, for example, was awesome and has excellent customer service skills. Please fix this situation because it's sad when this place has such good food to have this managerial situation holding them back from additional success and obvious employee satisfaction."}
{"text":"Their Carne Adovada is ridiculously good and their portion size in relation to their prices are very generous. They are worth the drive and there are tons of options to choose from however I would highly recommend the Carne Adovada. The staff is helpful and attentitive and the facility is clean inside and out. Keep up the great work and I hope you extend your business to other side of the Valley. I wish you guys success and am looking forward to coming back soon!"}
{"text":"I'm giving five stars because this is some BOMB food! Rice is oh so good, liking it a lot! This place has definitely replaced filibertos for me, will be coming back for more!!  Mmmmmm.....Good!!"}
{"text":"The food was good. The service was pretty good.  It's not a sit down get served restaurant like you might expect. You go up to the counter, place your order and they bring it to your table. You get your own drinks and chips. This isn't a criticism just letting you know.  It was a little more expensive then I thought but that may just be because what we ordered.  The Best part was there was this young girl working there who started to sing with my daughter. It was quite entertaining. There was an older lady there as well who was very friendly.  It seem to me there's a lot of good people working there so I'm routing for them to succeed and you should give them a shot."}
{"text":"Great food, finally good food that doesn't cost an arm and a leg. New Mexican food is my fav, I'm a fan for sure! Bummed the times I've came in there wasn't any green sauce for the chips. Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. The green chili was amazing and I loved the fry bread. I look forward to going back."}
{"text":"Food is really good and consistent. But the customer service could use a little help. We are from southern New Mexico and it is our favorite in this area."}
{"text":"Usually go there for breakfast, my favorite plate is the Huevos Rancheros with green chili, its amazing! pretty big and filling. Tried it with a side of Carne Asada that they just had finish cooking and it was out of this world. Service is friendly and fast."}
{"text":"Very good steak burrito and the service was on top of it. The employees keep it clean and the food tastes fresh.  Great salsa!"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh! Finally!! Being a native New Mexican meant that I was really missing \"home-town food\" after moving to Arizona six years ago. We came upon this place by recommendation of our daughters boyfriend. It's about 35 minutes away from us one way. We don't care! We drive it every Saturday.  DELICIOUS!!  The machaca crispy taco plate is AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Read the reviews and could not believe the praise and comments.  I had to check this place out.  It is in a strip mall and at first glance, I was not overally impressed.  Open the doors and was met with a huge menu and great detail for each item.  Placed the order and got my own chips and salsa.  Now the adventure begins,  chips and salsa was warm and fresh.  After a couple of minutes of covnersation, food arrived.  From the first bite to the last, flavor and presentation were outstanding.  You would not think the kitchen could produce such a excellent meal, but they did for the entire group.  Well done."}
{"text":"Great New Mexican food for a very reasonable price. Today was my first visit, but definitely will not be my last. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I grew up in NM, and this place has some great food that tastes a lot like home - Mexican food that has much bolder and better flavors than a lot of the other \"Mexican\" restaurants found around Phoenix.  I had the machaca enchiladas with red and green chile, and both chile sauces were excellent.  I'm tired of so many restaurants that don't have a green chile sauce but instead serve some green tomatillo stuff, and the New Mexican Grill was welcome relief with their sauce that is delicious.  The mild salsa was good, but I'd like to see the same thing with a medium or hot version.  The hot salsa was a more liquid-type of salsa which I'd give 3/5 stars.  Refried beans were 4/5, and the rice was slightly lacking in flavor, but still tasty enough I cleaned my plate.  I was very satisfied with the value here - good portion size for the price, and delicious."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad experience here, except for the wait at times when they are busy.  True red and green chile sauce here, which seems surprisingly hard to find in AZ.  If you're from NM and miss the cuisine, this place is a quick and cost-effective spot to get your fix.  My favorite thing here has to be the enchiladas."}
{"text":"I decided on the green chile pork mixed w beans chimichanga  w red chile sauce. So good! The pork was small cubes, not too much beans. The sauce was perfect; flavorful and not overpowering. Came w small sides of beans and rice. The take out order comes w a generous portion of chips and the salsa of your choice. We got hot and it was. We also got the grilled chicken burrito w green chile sauce. The green chile sauce was hot and not as flavorful as the red, but still very good. Finally, the grilled chicken soft tacos in corn tortillas. The chicken was diced small. Perfect.   The woman that rang me up was super nice and mentioned that my order was checked twice.  That made me feel good so I didn't have to do it myself.    I hope you give this place a try and I can't wait to get breakfast burritos on Sundays!  Update: 1/4/13.  They no longer give generous portions of chips or hot sauce which is a bummer.  They don't even give you enough hot sauce for the number of items you order.  They've also left things out of our to-go order several times since our first visit.  Their food is still really good so we'll keep going back for now."}
{"text":"Was good first time here. Place is pretty small. They need to serve beer too nothing better than a cervesa and some tacos lol"}
{"text":"This places has delicious salsa with green chile in it. It's probably the best salsa around. I know, that's a bold statement to make. I had the chile relleno topped with carne asada. Oh man, was it good. So many places use some weird batter concoction but this place has the recipe down."}
{"text":"One thing I always go back for here is the Chile Rellano with Hatch Green Chile sauce and carne asada! This is one off the very few places where my wife prefers to eat beef (convincing a Hindu to eat beef takes a lot of effort!), food is always on point, flavorful and fresh! If you dine in, the service is fast, it's nothing fancy in there but very well maintained."}
{"text":"Great food...but a lot of room for improvement.  For starters they need to hang a giant menu above where you order instead of simply having a stack of menus next to the cash register. This would certainly speed up the ordering process. They could also probably benefit from hiring more outgoing and fun employees. Nobody has been mean or anything, but \"shy & quiet\" aren't good character attributes for people dealing with the public.  Besides all of that, I've yet to have a bad meal here. The food is good and pretty consistent. Sometimes the wait-times have been outrageous, but the flavor has never been lacking.  Overall: I'll definitely return; but, I'd love to see this place improve, so I can give them at least one more star. The food merits it."}
{"text":"Oooooooohhhhhh man was I impressed by this little joint! I got myself a carne asada burro and WOW was it good! And huge! I was only able to eat about half of it. And the little salsa/chip bar is so pleasant! I can see I will be returning time and time again. LOVE."}
{"text":"Very good Carne platter.  I had the tacos.  Meat was very tasty.  The beans and rice sides were tiny.  You won't love the portions but you will love the taste."}
{"text":"Wow...! New Mexican Grill is right on point. Very delicious food. This is down-home cooking -- soul food for your inner New Mexican self. [Yes, this is \"New Mexican\" food, not \"Mexican\" food. There is a difference.]  The red chili was so good that the mere memory of it now is making my mouth water; I highly recommend it. The fry bread, beans, rice, tostada, and green chili is all good too. Oh, and dude, don't sleep on the chips & salsa -- the best I've had in a long time.  I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"New Mexican is a good place to eat. Standard food at good prices. There are better places for Mexican in the area, but one is far off and one is three times the price. Worth a try."}
{"text":"This place was just plain gross.  As others have noted, we should have run out the door when we saw them microwaving everything.  I couldn't recommend New Mexican Grill less.  Not worth it."}
{"text":"Ok food  is good for sure! We have a toddler and I asked in the child meal could we half and half the beans and rice the girl at the register said sure, then when we get the food the \"manager\" (I'm assuming) says sorry we don't do that I told her I would pay for it and she was very rude and said sorry we don't do that. Really? I explained to her that a toddler is picky and we need to get both I would pay for a side, I got attitude, why do I get attitude from a employee?!?! She is a small tiny thin girl with a bad attitude, avoid her and all is well! They have messed up our take out orders twice now. We paid for extra tortillas and never received them TWICE now. I asked for both hot and mild salsa for the chips and again got attitude and told i need to pick one or the other, really? Customer service sucks, make sure your order is correct and don't dine in and it's ok."}
{"text":"We were excited to check this place out. I hear they have great breakfast burritos but they aren't offered in the afternoon. I was told this in a very rude and discourteous manner by a short girl with black hair around high school or college age. She should be let go. Absolutely condescending and that's the first impression you want to give your customers you need to think your strategy.   My mom had a quesadilla that was so burned the only flavor it had was that of charcoal. I had a shredded beef burrito and thought it was rather good. Very flavorful and not short on meat. It was super filling and I enjoyed it.  My Dad had the pork and it was not shredded but these weird unchewable rubber nuggets. Let's just say it's a good thing they offer flavorful endless chips with flavorful salsa.   The atmosphere is grim. There is a TV blasting away.  It felt like I was at an auto repair shop waiting for an oil change. I was happy to leave.  I'd still like to try the breakfast burritos for TAKE OUT but I'd have to get the approval of the snarky girl upfront who apparently has better things to do than appreciate the fact she has a job."}
{"text":"Just left this place hungry.  I ordered a Chili Relleno Dinner for 8.99 and watched a woman microwave a dark, flat, patty of grease, that was not fresh or even recognizable as food.    A relleno has the shape of a pepper not a hamburger.  I took it back and was told it's made fresh everyday AND THEY REFUSED TO MAKE ME ANYTHING ELSE!!!   So luckily they refunded my money or I was going to call the cops!!!  Never in my life have I been treated like that, called out like I was a clueless liar and told that a pile of shit was fresh or even a pepper!!!  Delusional....  STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE...NOT FRESH"}
{"text":"They have yummy, fluffy fry bread that are huge! I like that you can get it with carne asada which I prefer from the standard flavorless ground beef that come in an Indian Taco in most places. The asada was flavorful. The ingredients were fresh. They also gave you an option of red or green chile sauce, and I opted for red on the side. The taco did not need the extra sauce but I tasted a few bites with it and enjoyed the flavor of the sauce. It would be bomb on some enchiladas.  I got take out and it also included some chips and salsa. You don't see that too often anymore.  Most places charge extra for these.   I didn't try anything else besides the fry bread taco but I'm already excited to go back and try more items. So... Yay! I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"This has been bookmarked for quite sometime now, so we decided to finally try it.  We had the Beef Flautas plate, Carne Asada Tacos plate and a Kid's Quesadilla.  The food was good, but not memorable.  I asked for hatch green chile sauce on the side and it was watery and not flavorful.  If they improve and master this sauce, like fire roasting it, it would really put them on the map out here.  Even if the chile was pan cooked and browned with onions and garlic, it would have made an awesome sauce.    Other than that...we're still looking."}
{"text":"Ok. All my Burque peeps. It's good. Salsa is not hot like sadies was. But it's good. Food is amazing. Makes me miss home. Dam need more places with green chile. That is all."}
{"text":"I love this place! Everything I've eaten here is delish. Chip & salsa bar-bonus! It's true they do need better signage tho"}
{"text":"So delicious! Amazing green Chile, enchiladas, fry bread, and tacos! Everything we have ever tried has been delicious! Super friendly people and clean too! Love this place!"}
{"text":"First time here...Worse service ever....server yelled at me...for no reason...I was hoping to find a great new place but not here!   I ate the cheese enchilada which was marginal at best.."}
{"text":"The food was delicious! I ordered the Green Chili Stew with Pork, it was so tasty! The flat bread was a great compliment to it. Everyone at my table enjoyed their selection as well. Their chips and salsa is really good."}
{"text":"Our favorite place close to home for breakfast, lunch and dinner too. Got company visiting? We run over and get a big batch of breakfast burritos. Best local place for authentic Mexican food! We're here at least once a week and tell everyone we know about it and we love supporting local family owned businesses! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We're from New Mexico so we were super excited to eat here. We've been here a couple of times and decided to take our son there since we've gone without him. WOW! A little disappointed that we spent $51 for breakfast for a family of 3. We ordered two breakfast fry breads (egg whites and shredded chicken because we don't eat pork nor the yoke of the egg), a breakfast quesadilla (machaca & egg whites), 3 churros, and a cup of coffee. So, they don't have on their menu that they charge extra \"for using more eggs\" when asking for egg whites, but when we got the quesadilla my son questioned where the eggs were and the egg whites were sparse on both fry breads. I had to drench mine in salsa for some flavor and my husband commented on how bland it tasted. The churros tasted like they were filled with butter and not Bavarian cream. All this for $51? I will be making this with more seasoning and more egg whites for MAYBE $15 at home. So sad!!"}
{"text":"So much food for a good price!! We've had the frybread and chimichangas so far and they never disappoint :)"}
{"text":"Solid fast Mexican food.  Enchiladas, nachos, and rolled tacos are good.  Will try more stuff later."}
{"text":"Being from NM its hard to find great Mexican places to eat!  This little hole in the wall holds its own!  The only bad thing is, the line out the door!  People waiting for their orders should not block the doorway!!!"}
{"text":"I was very impressed! The food is absolutely excellent and the atmosphere is very friendly. I had the enchiladas and they were the best I've had. My husband had the quesadilla, which was huge!! They have unlimited chips and delicious salsa. We will continue to support this small business and we are extremely happy to have it in gilbert."}
{"text":"We just moved into the area a few weeks ago and I am glad that I stumbled into this place.  I absolutely love Hatch green chili's and this place does not disappoint.  So far I've had the pork green chili burrito and it was pretty good, albeit I tend to like mine spicier, but then again I am sort of a masochist when it comes to spice.  We also tried their chicken enchiladas and fry bread today which were excellent.  The complementary chips and salsa are definitely an added bonus (also to your waistline) for those that dine in. As I write this I am already thinking about going there tomorrow to try one of their breakfast burritos.  Ralph, the owner, is very nice and I enjoyed talking with him.  I will definitely be frequenting New Mexican Grill in the future."}
{"text":"These are the best green chili breakfast burritos -perhaps even compared to New Mexico.   His green chili seasoning is just a cut above-family secret seasonings.  Really worth it even if the strip mall setting doesn't indicate it!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious and authentic for being a small place.  The salsa was not runny but full of ingredients and tasty which is my personal meter for grading mexican restaurants."}
{"text":"Food was delicious I ordered a #8 which was Green chilli plate and it was delish! The cashier lady wasn't very pleasant, she stared me down the whole time I was reading the enormous menu, which made me feel uncomfortable and rushed. I wasn't welcomed Or thanked as I left. Just really handed my bag and sent on my way."}
{"text":"This place is amazing I have tried many different things on the menu everything is great!!!! Only wish they were a full service restaurant !!! Maybe one day !"}
{"text":"great food and good prices.  food has been 5 stars 6/7 times that we ate there.  complimentary chip and salsa bar for dinner is a pretty cool edition too. i fell in love with the chile relleno (so delicious everytime) so i havent ventured anywhere else on the menu yet.  the girlfriend always gets their machaca taco/chz enchilada/ tostada (#1) combo which is also delicious.  both meals for under $20.  dont forget to leave a tip for the courteous staff!!"}
{"text":"Had the carne asada tacos and carne asada fry bread. Both were very good.  Nice flavor to the meat.  Large menu selection. Will go back. Gave 4 instead of 5 stars since the unsweetened iced tea tasted stale."}
{"text":"I've been there for Breakfast several times now.  The food is fantastic, the service is quick, their Chips are always warm, and the salsa has just the right kick.   You really can't go wrong ordering anything on the menu with green chile.  These guys do it right!"}
{"text":"Man, the food has really fallen.  We have been here a number of times and loved the food, left very good reviews and wanted to go back.  Went today and talk about dry bland shredded beef tecos.  Polite young guys running the place but no freakin salt or seasoning and over cooked.  Whoever made the shredded beef, wake up and add salt and pepper.  Didn't even finish my food and am disappointed.  Won't be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"We showed up for dinner.  I note they have a breakfast menu, but we did not try any of that.  With only one visit obviously we haven't sampled extensively.  I tried to keep it simple.  I got a burrito.  Note that you should not count on dining here.  They have very few tables.  If you're lucky you'll get one.  But you may have to take out.  So the burrito comes up.  It was fine.  I can't say that it \"wow'd\" me.  It didn't.  But it was fine.  The rice was pretty good.  The beans were the typical paste-like splat of refried beans.  Never been a fan of that.  Some places do the refried beans with some flavor!  These were typical, bland, and uninteresting.  I am willing to try them again.  But this meal did not compel me to return soon.  Oh...the chips and salsa were fine also.  Everything is just A-OK."}
{"text":"We have eaten here 4 times now the 1st three times were for their great breakfasts. Today we were late enough that I opted for lunch rather than breakfast, I had the Chili Stew an excellent choice!  So far this place has been consistently great and I'm pleased to recommend it to you. I will also echo the previous praise for Ralph and his staff, they have been both friendly and efficient on all of our visits."}
{"text":"This is a great family run New Mexican restaurant. Food is fresh and authentic and really reasonably priced. Everything I've tried has been delicious, fry bead, tacos, enchiladas, red chili stew, breakfast burritos, all were great."}
{"text":"We found this place by accident and it turned out to be a happy accident. The food was excellent and is the best Mexican food I've had since I left California. I will be going back again and again."}
{"text":"Loved this place until the last few visits. Not as clean as in the past food not as good."}
{"text":"Best Green chili pork anywhere in Arizona. Wow. I have gone to this little eatery about 100 times in the last 2 years (not kidding). I've found they have the best flavor items in the following categories, of any Mexican food place in the Valley: 1. Anything with green chili pork.(burrito, fry bread topping etc) 2. Best Fry bread anywhere 3. Stews - monster sized stews (green chili is awesome) that come with a fry bread! Huge amount of excellent tasty food. 4. Amazing  grilled carne asada street tacos"}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place, because it is really close to my house, and it would have been great to have a good New Mexican place close by.  The food here isn't bad, and if you prefer Sonoran Mexican it probably fits the bill just fine.  For my taste, everything was way too bland, nowhere near spicy enough.  Granted, I've been spoiled by Los Dos Molinos, but regardless I expect to see some fire brought if I'm eating New Mex.  This place couldn't quite deliver."}
{"text":"I can't comment on or rate the food, but note to others:  they CLOSE at 5:00 pm on Saturdays. Say what?  We drove down, based on recommendations, but are now looking for another spot for dinner. I'd give 1 star, based on a bizarre restaurant philosophy (really??  On a weekend night??) but that's a bit harsh. I'll update my review when or if I decide to try again."}
{"text":"What the HELL is wrong with you Yelpers who like this place?!    A rare Yelp miss, but an almost unforgivable miss.  I am tempted to write a letter to Yelp to audit the accounts who posted positive reviews for this place!  You're either tastebud deficient or a friend of the owner.  First of all, we should have walked out when we saw that two employees were just sort of lazily hangin' about and chatting it up in a booth in the back of the joint.  Both looked unkempt and disinterested; thought they for sure were just a couple of hungover college kids.  At first I thought they must be on break, but nope they were both involved in us getting our food.  Whoever is managing this place needs to get it under control.  Employees like that will kill your business!  The chips and salsa are a joke.  They are just sitting out there under a heat lamp with a sign that says, basically, please don't take too much so we can save money.  Uh,.. never seen something so remarkably cheap in my life.  Even the sign looked cheap, printed on some old paper, off center, and filthy.  The chips were hard and seemed to have been sitting out for a while and likely not fresh.  The salsa was below average and didn't taste fresh.  I am convinced the tomatoes were out of a can.  I tried their \"specialty,\" if you dare call this piece of shit special, the Green Chili Pork Burrito.  Again, no way in hell was this fresh. Also bland and boring.  The rice was room temperature and the beans watery.  My wife thought hers was just boring and the kids barely ate it.  Stay away!!!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here easily 45+ times on various Saturdays over the past four years and definitely recommended.  Love the chips and salsa!  Just had a chance on my visit this last week to try the enchiladas and recommended.  I usually order the same thing and never regretted it.  but I will be more adventurous in ordering upcoming.  Brought new friends this last visit and they have already returned for a 2nd visit without me!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food. Breakfast burritos are a steal and crazy good. Green chile pork plate is super good.  Location makes you think \"we should get this to go next time\". Service is fast if not slightly indifferent seeming. Green chili though."}
{"text":"Don't miss out on this place. I had simple soft chicken tacos and the flavor was out of this world.  The beans and rice are incredibly fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"The good, the mild salsa mixed with the jalapeño salsa was tasty.  I also enjoyed the green corn tamale.  The bad, everything else.  I ordered the number 1 combo.  1chicken taco, 1cheese enchilada, & 1 bean tostada.    The chicken in the taco was fried to crispy bits of jerky and actually cracked when I attempted to chew it. The cheese enchilada had way too much cheese. I never thought I would say that.  I requested red sauce but was served green.  The rice had no flavor or seasoning other than black pepper.  Since the beans had no flavor, I didn't even try the tostada.  I may stop back for a tamale if I happen to be in the area, but even that isn't likely.   The young man I expressed my displeasure with as I threw out all of the food stated had he known he would have tried to correct it.  While I appreciate the gesture, if any one had come by our table at least once, we may have provided the opportunity."}
{"text":"First, I was born and raised in ABQ NM. I really WANTED to like this place BUT.........  This is not authentic New Mexican food. FYI- I ordered the bean and cheese burrito with half red and half green chile.  CONS: - Staff is mediocre and not very friendly - The flour tortillas are not authentic.  It was like plastic and not anything like you would find in a good New Mexican restaurant. - The green and red chile are not authentic, they look more like the chili \"sauces\" that you see in AZ rather than the pure \"gold\" that you find in NM. - There was no garnish on my meal except for a coupe of scallions - The beans were SUPER salty -  The rice was nothing special and tasteless  PROS -The salsa and chips were ok - Atmosphere is ok  I will not return and I feel terrible for having to write a negative review."}
{"text":"Awesome food. You get a lot for the price. I love their Carne Asada green chile fries and their green chile burrito."}
{"text":"Great breakfast burritos, quick and always friendly, good place to have lunch. Nothing fancy just real home made Mexican food, kinda hidden from main streets so you can call it a hidden gem"}
{"text":"We had Shredded Beef Tacos, Red Chile Beef Burro, and Quesadillas.  All were wonderful.  We went on opening day, had dinner.  They open at 7A for breakfast and I am seriously thinking about going back tomorrow morning.  Is it bad to eat at the same place twice within 12 hours?  I am really excited for this new establishment, can't wait to tour the menu!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal all around. Little shop with wonderful customer service and probably the best Mexican food I've ever had. I travel to Gilbert a few times a year and I stop in this gem several times a trip."}
{"text":"Good little mom and pop place.  Chili Relleno not overly eggy or breaded and cooked to perfection.  There are several meat options to add to the Relleno, I chose Carne Asada; but, would probably go with Adovada next time or even plain Queso.   I recommend giving this place a try if you are in the area and enjoy New Mexican food."}
{"text":"I love this place!  I went there on a total whim with my dad once, and then again with my husband and both times I was extremely impressed.  The huevos rancheros was delicious, and the green chile is sooooo good!  I even really like the chips and salsa.  The price for the quality and portion size is really great too.  I would definitely recommend this place to somebody that is looking for a unique and tasty experience, especially the breakfast (which is served all day).  Yum!  The atmosphere isn't the greatest thing in the world, kind of a small hole-in-the-wall type place but still felt cozy and clean.  I like that it's just a small/family type shop.  Give it a try, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Wonderfully TRUE New Mexican food!  I've had Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner here and each visit has been great.  My fiance is from NM and we've brought visiting relatives (also from NM) here and they've all loved it too.  The owner is super nice and we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"We have been here twice now.  Everyone raves about the salsa, but I don't get it.  I have had better salsa.  My husband doesn't like the place a lot, but will go if I want to.  I like their shredded beef tacos and stuff.  The enchillads actually come out cooked in the middle.  They cost more than I was expecting and the al a carte menu adds up quick.  Service is friendly."}
{"text":"Review based on breakfast only  The good: Pork and green chili very good Decor fits the concept  The Bad: No complimentary chips till 11am. Even though they have them sitting right there in the kitchen.   No half and half for coffee only powdered creamer  No Mexican rice for breakfast. The potatoes they serve are bland and covered with cheese  Tacky handwritten notes on window blinds. See photos  Cashier who takes the order doesn't know the menu thus creating confusion for the kitchen and customers.   I'll probably return but take the food to go."}
{"text":"Seriously the best breakfast burritos ! My husband and I get them twice a month on Sunday mornings! The staff is always so nice and their food is great.. Prices are good too! A+ from me :)"}
{"text":"I noticed this place was hot on Yelp so I wanted to check it out. I'm not sure what distinguishes New Mexican food from the other states, so I didn't know what to expect. When I ordered I was told they make everything fresh, from scratch and make their green chile with Hatch chiles, that excited me. I get Hatch chiles every year and love cooking with them for months to come. If I had to guess, I would say that they boil their chiles because their green chile wasn't as flavorful and tasty as the ones I roast.   I ordered a green chile pork chimichanga. I was disappointed with the tortilla, definitely not made from scratch. As, I tore into the chimi I realized they gave me chicken instead of pork, no biggie. The chicken wasn't cooked together with the green chile, they were cooked separately and then combined into the chimi. I guess that's the New Mexican way? After I make my green chile I add the meat and let it simmer for an hour to let the meat absorb the flavor of the green chile. I was disappointed with my chimi. The beans were excellent and the rice was alright.   The restaurant itself is very small and I would prefer to take my food to go and eat the comfort of my own home. The woman taking the orders at the register was very nice and friendly. I will come back and try some other menu items, but not the green chile."}
{"text":"I liked this place.  The menu kind of bugged me - in that they don't have anything above the cashier, merely copies of the menu taped to the counter next to the register.  But that has nothing to do with the food.  The chips and salsa were good, as was the fry bread / chimi that we tried.  It's not really close to us, so I won't be going out of my way to eat there - but still a worthy choice."}
{"text":"Top notch breakfast burrito. All ingredients are fresh; they also don't follow the trend of other places by using tons of potato filler in there. I tried the machaca breakfast burrito - it's got peppers, tomato, green chile, cheese, egg and potato. Great mix, piping hot, and huge. For around $4. I could probably split it and still be full. I will be back regularly for this quick stop. Next time I'll try the chorizo - they make it themselves and claim it's lean and not greasy."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. Fast service. Delicious and authentic food. Can't wait to go back on Saturday to try the posole."}
{"text":"If you want flavor this is the place to go.  It is the real deal.  I could eat this food every night.  Chili relleno's are to die for.  Tamales too.  Haven't had a bad meal yet.  Only draw back is a cold beer would complete the meal."}
{"text":"The fry bread was horribly over cooked today. Don't think I'll come back. Had to ask for a metal knife to cut it. Shouldn't be hard to bite through."}
{"text":"Pretty good. First time here. I had the pork fry bread, and my wife the carne asada tacos. I liked the flavor of the asada better than the pork. Will be back, excited to try their breakfast."}
{"text":"I can't explain how much I love this place.  The tamales are delicious.  Packed with perfectly seasoned pork. The green sauce is the best I have ever had. Living in California the last 5 years I really missed green sauce and food with flavor. This place gives me both. I have also read some reviews on here talking about customer service. We have been here 4 times and they have always been kind and accurate with our order. Try them out. You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"We use to go to Serranos. Then we found new mexican.   The flavors is so much better. I haven't tried a lot on their menu but absolutely love the carne asada burrito with the hatch green Chile sauce. Keep up the good work! See you soon..."}
{"text":"Oh Yelp, you VERY RARELY let me down. How you have misguided me! This place has 4 stars!?!? In Arizona!? Bless their hearts, they tried. Beans tasted fake, salty, and microwaved to molten hot pocket lava status. Tortilla was disgusting, and far from authentic. I don't understand these reviews. IS THIS REAL LIFE?!? I am Hispanic, so I am critical of Mexican food, but still, don't tease me Yelp!!"}
{"text":"Fix your hours on Yelp. Nothing like driving to a closed restaurant that says they should be open. I know that is petty, but it is annoying."}
{"text":"You have to look a little hard to find this gem.  The New Mexican Grill is a small hole in the wall restaurant (in a new building) at the end of a Medical park type area.   I lived in Albuquerque for nearly 10 years.  There is one thing you figure out real quick and that is the difference between good and bad New Mexican food.  This place is fantastic.  So far I am working my way down the menu and haven't found a bad item yet.  They will even throw an egg or two on your enchiladas and you can have it \"Christmas\" style (red&green chile)  There is only one drawback.  Dont be in a hurry, this isn't Taco Bell."}
{"text":"We love this place. It is our favorite, for sure. Great tasting food!!! Delicious salsas. Not always the friendliest staff, and the blaring tv is unnecessary. You will love this mom and pop place with a small space for dining indoor and out."}
{"text":"Today I finally got to this wonderful place for a late lunch. Had the carne asada fry bread, Christmas style. Only one word can describe this: YUMMMM!!! Not only was this worth the short drive from Chandler, but it's going to be a regular place for me. Cute little dining area with kachina and gorgeous baskets. Friendly and fast service."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  Lots of flavor, nice staff.  The hatch green chili sauce is wonderful.  It tastes just like the sauce at the Pepper Pot in Hatch, New Mex.  The Fry Bread is delicious!  Not too greasy and very soft.  The green chili stew is quite spicy, but full of great flavor!  This place is a MUST try!"}
{"text":"Free chips on tap, can't beat that. Green sauce is good, tacos aren't bad. I recommend the chicken over the asada. But can't go wrong either way. Bathrooms are way in the back. One location."}
{"text":"The food here is so good. We come here mostly for breakfast and always over order because we have our favorite things there and order them all. Their flat breads and tortillas are delicious. Our only bad thing to say about it is they aren't open on Sundays anymore!"}
{"text":"This placed was crowded on a Friday night mostly with young families. They give you a little dish so you can pile on fresh chips with three different salsas by the counter- unlimited! So it's nice.  I ordered the Chile Relleno- a thin, roasted green chile stuffed with cheese, served with rice and beans. I thought the chile would be more stuffed with meat or quinoa or something but it was really thin with cheese, and the rice and beans were nothing too  spectacular. My friend's quesadilla was just OK too."}
{"text":"Love this place. Fresh menu items made to order. My favorite is the Carna Asada Burrito with Green Hatch Chilies.  Yum Yum"}
{"text":"Perfection! Green chile sauce in pork stew bowl w/frybread, corn and cheese tamale, and ground beef/green chile chimi. This is now our favorite casual serve restaurant!"}
{"text":"Chips always fresh, delicious salsa. I love the pork chile stew with fry bread. Never disappointed, unless line is long---but worth the wait."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  I have met Ralph (the owner) and his son numerous times.  I am always treated with a smile and good stories.  The family run business does a good job bringing Hatch chili to the valley.  Unlike Arribas, there is no soupy, chicken-stock laces salsas here, just good spicy kick with amazing flavors.  I even go as far as to but their hot salsa by the quart for use at home.  I highly recommend the pork green chili burro... comfort food at its best.  I also like the tamales (except that they get microwaved).  But overall, a warm vibe with cool employees and good food.  For my daughters and wife, VEGETARIAN FRIENDLY!  (No lard, veggie alternatives)"}
{"text":"We tried this place for the first time yesterday. The food was so great we decided to go back today  and it was just as good. The service was quick and kind, the salsa is delicious (though we've only tried the medium), fry bread is amazing... Just go here. You won't regret it. We generally don't eat out often but this will be my new go to place!"}
{"text":"Good food. Chili relleno was great. Great people great atmosphere. High quality food and service"}
{"text":"Gluten free eater here! I love New Mexican cuisine and my normal go-to is blue adobe, but wanted to try a quicker version.   First off, they had a pretty decent menu, but I was sad to learn the enchilada sauces had wheat in them (New Mexican enchilada sauces don't). I regularly order carne asada tostadas. I love these at other restaurants. I loved everything about this. The beans has great flavour, enough to taste the bean but not be pasty. The carne asada was well seasoned steak with very little fatty pieces. I added the mild red salsa over the top and it was delicious.   My mom, another gf eater, ordered the chicken salad and rolled beef tacos. The salad was basic but all the the pieces together were tasty. The chicken was a bit salty. The rolled tacos were yummy. I had to sample them. It had enough meat to give it texture but not overwhelm. The corn tortillas were so good. Great flavour.   My husband had the chilli relleno. He loved it. Best he had.    Needless to say everything was delicious. A little less salt would have been nice but otherwise we will be back."}
{"text":"So delicious. I used to work across the street and we regularly would get breakfast burritos for the office. I got so hooked we now drive from Tempe to eat here. So delicious! Get your burrito smothered! Mmm"}
{"text":"Due to an intense PMS induced craving for fry bread, and Google's inability to find me anywhere else nearby where I could satisfy said craving, I decided to give these guys another shot. Well, I'm glad I did. Props, guys. You have definitely stepped up your game."}
{"text":"I love the food at this restaurant. I usually go to the one on Lindsay rd.  However,  today I had the worse experience ever with them. I called in an order before 11 am, they told me it would be ready in 15 mins. I got there and waited until 11:25 and still had no breakfast burrito. I asked them about it, they said it was on the way out in a minute. I waited another 5 mins. Needless to say, I left at 11:30 with no food and a refund, since they haven't even started cooking it yet. Not sure I will come back to this location again. The only reason they are getting 2 stars is because the woman up front who I believe is the manager,  was very nice apologized and refunded me my money and provided me a $5 gift card for my time."}
{"text":"I come from a family who were all born and raised in New Mexico. My standard for New Mexican food is extremely high. The rolled tacos were pretty good, the green salsa was on point, but the red chili with cumin lost me. It killed all the delicious natural flavor of red hatch chili. It also took forever to get helped."}
{"text":"Fantastic food...my only complaint is the owner needs to suck it up and buy a sign for the location. I've lived 2 miles away for 3 years and just recently found the place!"}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for good Mexican food and lucky for me, it is definitely not hard to find in AZ. However, Mexican food that truly stands out in AZ is the real kicker here once you've eaten enough of it. This place is such a gem. Their Hatch green chile sauce is made from miracles. It's just the right amount of heat... and it's a hearty green sauce, not that runny bs you get at most places. I've had their tamales and the chicken burrito with the green sauce (yaaass) and both were phenomenal. Portions are definitely massive so proceed with caution and expect a healthy food baby. And don't skip the chips and salsa bar. :)"}
{"text":"This place has amazing food--always tasty, consistently reliable in taste meaning no variation depending on when eating there, and very nice service. I've eaten breakfast, lunch, and dinner at the NMG and have never been disappointed. Def warrants a return trip and well worth your first time. Today we met the owner, Ralph--great dude!"}
{"text":"I was a weekly customer until today. The waitress made a simple mistake today by confusing the order, no big deal right? Wrong, she went on to take an accusatory tone with two insulting remarks and then told us next time she would charge us for the wrong order. She should have just owned the mistake and made it right rather than insult our family breakfast. I won't be back, way out of line."}
{"text":"Chicken enchiladas with Green sauce. What a wonderful surprise to find this little gem of a spot! Inexpensive lunch date. Tucked into a strip mall. Thumbs up from me!"}
{"text":"This place is great! I come here strictly for the fried bread. The staff is always welcoming and so is the environment. If I am ever unsure about what I want, the staff will offer sampling sauces, meat, Ect. The owner always come by my table and says hello and is always friendly. The food is extremely affordable, plenty and of course... Delicious!  I have actually arrived at other restaurants and got back in my car to come here... This place is so good I wrote this review before I finished my plate! Thanks NMG!"}
{"text":"It's a little tough to find this place but I'm certainly glad I did!! It shares the parking lot with Rosatis.  Taste: authentic, kick, delicious!! I got the machaca burrito with green sauce. WOW! I will never go to a chain place again for this dish. It was sooo good. And price: it was the same if not better priced than a chain so of course I'd rather something homemade! I got an order of chicken nachos for the kids which was huge. The picture doesn't do it justice--great taste, portion and price. Lastly, the place felt really clean. There is tasty chips and salsa if you dine in. We were there around 3:30 on a Sunday . It was quiet but still 3 or 4 customers came in within 30 minutes. I will definitely go back here!!"}
{"text":"For the food, I give a 5. I love New Mexican Grill. I learned of them from their Gilbert & Germann location. I assume they closed it because it was competing w the Lindsay location.  Their green sauce and salsa is fabulous! So why the 3?   Just too many not-customer-friendly things.  Like the fact I can't get a lid for salsa. And when I ask, I'm provided one lid. There are no napkins at the table. Even for a spill, I asked and was provided 1.  There is no cutlery to self help. But a sign that says \"we will bring cutlery to you\". And then some other negative sign by fountain beverages. It's like I'm eating at a highway stop by a prison - uncomfortable.  Don't punish the many for the behaviors of a few.   I've seen other Mexican places give free chips while you wait for take out; lids alongside, napkins at table.  And the prices are in line too. So for the atmosphere I gave a 1.    Total score a 3 ...but lots of potential!"}
{"text":"Great Tacos!!! The Bavarian Cream Churros are AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!! Better than Disneyland!!"}
{"text":"The BEST Mexican food in Arizona. Im a native and Mexican food is my favorite and the heritage I've lived for many years."}
{"text":"Drove from Queen Creek to the Pecos and Lindsey location for a to-go order and trip to the park after with the kids. I paid 20 dollars for my food and asked for a cup of water. They handed me a tiny plastic cup, to which I begged for a cup with a lid. After arguing with the manager for 5 min with a toddler in my arm and two kids running around. I left pretty annoyed at the place for not sparing a 5 cent cup that would make all the difference in this momma's world to take to the park with A LID.  I didn't get one.  This may seem petty, but they also got my order wrong and therefore I came to the conclusion that if I make the effort to drive all that way, spend a good amount on a couple tacos and burrito, I expect a business to return the kindness even if it is as simple as a cheap water cup with a lid,  and getting the order right.  The food was decent, but I won't be back. Consider the customer service when you decide to satisfy your Mexican food craving."}
{"text":"I've been eating here pretty regularly since it first opened. Since it's not in the busiest easy to find part of Gilbert, it used to always be easy to get in and has great food. Evidently, people are finding out about this place because now, at the right time, you'll be waiting sometimes out the door to get in. This place IS that good. I'll still stand in line, I don't care. Price is reasonable and food is great. I usually try to get something different every now and then and have never had anything I didn't like there. Staff is always great and has a nice outside area."}
{"text":"I'm working my way through the menu and I must say I'm thrilled to finally have found a place that cooks New Mexican style just like my mom does..there is a HUGE difference between New Mexican vs. Mexican food. New Mexican style is unique and so flavorful. I'm so happy to get the comfort food from my childhood right here in chandler..5 stars once I complete the menu :) Thank you New Mexican grill for making this gal feel like she's home away from home, finally!"}
{"text":"We've tried New Mexican Grill twice so far.  We were attracted to the restaurant because we've been to New Mexico several times over the past few years and we love the cuisine and culture.  It's a small place, with no more than six tables.  All meals come with complementary chips and salsa, which you help yourself to.  They have three salsas--tomatillo, pico de gallo, and a spicy red salsa, each of them are good.  We've tried their carnitas tacos, red chile pork stew, huevos rancheros and chorizo, egg, and potato burrito.  The sauces have that distinctive New Mexican chile flavor, and each of them are homemade.  I really like that you can order breakfast any time of day.  Their chorizo is made from scratch, and is very lean--I loved it, it was some of the best around.  All of this comes at very reasonable prices ranging from $4 for burritos and up to $7 for their larger entrees and combos.  They haven't decided on a final menu yet, they said they plan to evaluate what people like most, which is great because they really value their customers' feedback.    My only complaint is that while their chips are very good when they're fresh, sometimes I run into a few stale ones.  They just need to throw any old ones out when they replenish the supply.    Lastly, it's important to mention that the folks running the joint are friendly and nice people.  They take pride in their culture as well, as their decor is distinctly New Mexican, with traditional pottery, rugs, and paintings sprinkled throughout the dining area."}
{"text":"OMG!! The chimichanga with machaca and green is to die for!! I had to slow down because I was eating it so fast and I knew I would get heartburn if I didn't pace myself!! The chips and salsa were also amazing, as well as the rice and beans!! The only fault is that they don't serve alcohol!! A nice margarita would have been perfect to wash it down!! However, you can bring your own liquor if you want! There's a Walgreens down the street!!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a breakfast place on our way to run errands.  We've surely passed by this place before and never noticed it, but thanks to Yelp we had a delicious breakfast of machaca on fry bread with green sauce and a machaca burrito with green sauce.  The burrito was huge and the fry bread practically covered the plate. I've only had fry bread at fairs so this was amazing.  The menu board had so much on it we will definitely return with the rest of the family."}
{"text":"Huge Mexican food fans and everyone in my family loves this place! I'm more of a chicken person and their grilled chicken (on the street tacos, nachos, grilled chicken burro) is amazing! No other fast-casual Mexican food place around here has chicken like this - cubed, seasoned, grilled and fresh. The nachos with grilled chicken are my absolute favorite but everything I have tried here is great. Obviously it's not gourmet Mexican food but for convenience, price, and flavor it blows all the other nearby fast-mex places out of the water! Native-American flair makes them unique as well but I have yet to try their fry bread. Been here at least 10 times in the past year and we will return. Only complaint would be that the interior of the restaurant is not the cleanest and they have odd open hours sometimes. Judging the food and affordability gives it a 10/10 though!"}
{"text":"Of course as an original New Mexican, I'm always on the lookout for a yellow flag, zia sign, green chile with a happy face, something that will indicate a NM restaurant...so I'm driving north on Lindsay near Pecos and I see a sign with New Mexican food options.  I stopped in for lunch, had the chile relleno and it was absolutely delicious!  So good, I had to take my family for dinner.  We had the cheese enchiladas (X-Mas style with an egg on top,  if you're from NM you will understand) my kids had smothered burritos and chorizo plate, all great reviews from family.  At my lunchtime visit, I was disappointed they didn't have sopaipillas on the menu, but they do have fry bread with powdered sugar which cured the fix at dinner.  Very happy I found this small joint;  very unassuming, very easy to miss.  But definitely stop in for your chile cravings!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and hearty portions.  I go for the posole on the weekends.  In the restaurant now on a Sunday morning and every table has customers with a bowl of posole on it."}
{"text":"We're from Albuquerque, so we're always on the lookout for good New Mexican food.  Several family members have been raving about this place for months, so I was excited to try it.  I was not disappointed.  I had the chimichanga with shredded beef and red chile.  It was amazing!  I tasted my sister's green chile enchiladas, and they were equally delicious.  The owner and his staff are very welcoming and friendly.  The seating area is somewhat limited, but the owner told us that he is working to add more seating in the future.  The only thing I would do differently next time is remember to buy some tortillas to take home for later."}
{"text":"It was ok. HUGE portions. But trying to cut up a GIANT burrito with a flimsy plastic fork/knife was somewhat of a joke! There isn't much seating (inside). The chips (although limitless) left a LOT to be desired (tasted like store bought) and the cups you get for salsa are teeny tiny- which the chip doesn't even fit in!! The girl at the counter was less than helpful or friendly-since it was our first time. The food was hot, fresh and fast. But the whole experience was lacking. They (the unfriendly girl at the counter) would not accommodate needing something small for a 20month old. We had to purchase the $6 kids meal, so she could eat 5 bites of a quesadilla- a baby doesn't need beans and rice or a soda... It was awkward having the credit card slip have a \"tip\" spot, since you order at the counter. So do people that pay cash get asked for it? Or are they supposed to leave on table? We didn't see anyone leave anything on tables around us. But there was a woman that brought our food and asked if we needed anything BUT everything was self serve?!? Not sure how to gauge that one. We will probably be back, but $33 for a 3 adults and a baby for lunch (no drinks purchased) seemed a bit much to order at the counter and eat on paper plates with plastic utensils."}
{"text":"Had breakfast, was great homestyle New Mexican SW flavors. All handmade/homemade chow. Very friendly staff. Get your Xmas tamales ordered!"}
{"text":"So far I have been here five times. I would go more but the fiancé kind of limits it to one week. This week I went twice so I tried the chimi. My only complaint is that it's too big. Thank god they didn't give me beans also. The portions at this place are huge I never seem to have room for chips. I like the three sauces at the salsa bar. But my favorite is the hatch green sauce. I love the chili Relleno. It's hard to find a good one in az. I will say it's probably just as good with red or hatch. I love the tostada I'm not sure how but it doesn't break when I eat it. I never found that before usually they crumble. The other thing is the Diet Coke is always perfect if you read my other reviews I don't eat at places with Pepsi too often. Lately the trend is the new 50 flavor coke machine which sucks. Not here the coke is great.   Most of all I have to say the people who work there are awesome. They take pride in what they do and it shows.  Hope this place never changes I love it"}
{"text":"High marks for new mexican grill.  Very low key place.  They dont even have a sign out front.  However the food delivers.  I have had several things on the menu and they were all solid.  Sauces are over the top good.  Service is sometimes a little hit or miss, but always friendly.  Love the salsa bar"}
{"text":"With a heavy heart I'm giving this place only three stars. I love their food, don't get me wrong. It's the level of customer service that really sucks. The kids working there have an attitude that makes you want to use some quality adjectives, throw the bird, and just walk out. Their damn good food has a hold on me. It's like an abusive relationship that I just can't walk out of. If they were to actually be friendly and stop acting like they're doing YOU the favor, this place would rock. Please! step up your game. You're killing me softly."}
{"text":"best new mexican food. we moved from nm to the valley. miss the green chile. finally found a place to enjoy great food at a great price."}
{"text":"I have been here 5 or 6 times and the food has always been pretty good.  The one consistent thing about this place has always the service, or lack there of.  Employees are less than friendly and it feels as if I'm inconveniencing them by asking questions about the menu.  This morning I stopped in at 10:33a to purchase a couple of breakfast burritos and was shocked to hear they were done serving breakfast at 10:30.  Really, like making a couple of green chili burritos at 10:30 in the am is inconceivable. They looked at me like I was crazy.  Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Pretty awesome. Had the #4 and a crispy taco. Everything was really good.  Definitely a return to place."}
{"text":"I've dined here once before but didn't remember until I arrived and saw the place.  I called ahead so I could pick up and there was a line out the door. Food was good but there's a wait when you come at lunch.  Lots of people lined up at the door for food to go.  High demand for the food -that's promising. It's sorta chaotic with one register and all the people who want to order.  I called in my order and wasn't sure how or when I should pay or pick up. I kind of felt they didn't handle it the best way possible.  Like they didn't begin making my order at the time I called. The location isn't too far from CGCC - two thumbs up for that cuz it means the ASU campus isn't gonna be too far either."}
{"text":"One of the best. Have been going here for over a year and the green chili with anything is not just good but great. Kind of a fast food atmosphere and does not serve alcohol (a cold Pacifica would be a great complement to the food) but the food more than makes up for the lack of ambiance. The green chili has a bit of the peppery zip that one finds in good Hatch chilis. Everything is fresh and service is always friendly and competent, even when the place is really busy. The green pork burrito is the headliner, but the crispy tacos, and the combo enchilada, tostada and taco plate are all very good. A little more spice than traditional Arizona style Mexican, but not too much and very tasty.  Look forward to the day they take it to a larger location with more of a sit down atmosphere some cold cerveza, but hope they keep the little strip center locations they have now as well."}
{"text":"This place is great and the service was stellar.  I ordered a bunch of food to-go and it didn't take very long and the order was correct.  Their salsa verde is not as good as the ones in SF but it was decent.  The huevos rancheros burrito was deconstructed onto soft tacos, which was fine but unexpected.  I would definitely come back when I'm in town again!"}
{"text":"Just moved to Arizona and found this place. Food was amazing. I had the steak nachos, wife had a taco and tostada. Everything was fresh and cooked to order. We will DEFINITELY be back."}
{"text":"I grew up in Silver City New Mexico and grew up with a certain kind of Mexican Food taste ... this place NAILS IT.  I love anything green chile on their menu.  The tacos and enchiladas (love the flavor of their red sauce) are amazing too, and more recently I had their red chile plate which because a favorite.  Anything and everything I have had here is amazing.  I love their beans and rice too ... Not much of a kids menu if your kids don't like Mexican food, but they do have cheese crisps for them (just no chicken nuggets or grilled cheese like some other Mexican kids menus do)   Anyway - this place is in my top 2 of go to Mexican Food spots in the East Valley (QC, Gilbert, Mesa etc)  Do yourself a favor and EAT HERE - you will be sending me a compliment thanking me later."}
{"text":"Best green chili in Arizona, staff is friendly and there isn't anything on the menu that has disappointed! My three year old even wants it more than McDonalds!!!!"}
{"text":"Four stars for the food, service, cleanliness, and convenience. An extra star for the Green Bay Packers memorabilia. Woo!"}
{"text":"We tried this place the other day for the first time and it was very good. We ordered the carne asada taco plate, Hatch Green Chile Burrito and the fry bread with honey for dessert. We will be back:)"}
{"text":"This is one of our FAVORITE places. We drive over 15 minutes, the food never dis-appoints.  We were in the habit of going a couple of times a week!  We did however have a bad experience a few weeks back. We arrived 30 minutes prior to closing. Ordered and sat down to begin enjoying the yummy chips and salsa. Our food was delivered and a few minutes later they came out into the dining room with the mop bucket. I was completely disgusted as the smell of pine sol is not what I usually enjoy smelling while trying to enjoy my dinner. They also had the drink machine torn apart for cleaning so we were unable to refill our sodas. I understand that employees are anxious to end their shift and go home, but seriously? These things should not happen before the posted closing time.  They even turned a few customers away saying they were closing. My understanding is that you take orders up until closing time in a restaurant.  We weren't familiar with the people on staff that evening, but I know for certain that this would not have happened if Sherry had been working that evening, but with the new girl on shift we definitely did not feel welcome at all.  With all this being said, our food was amazing as always just totally turned off by the poor lack of customer service that night."}
{"text":"So the guy who reviewed about the microwave aint  lying.  I didn't read til after ordered food but my wife and I sat outside to watch the cook put a styrofoam to go box in microwave and then load up beans in a to go order. Yes. Gross. I know we use a microwave all the time which ain't good and our phones are bad yadayadayada. But for a \"grill\" type restaurant to use one is a no no. The food was good with the behind the head thought of microwave even. Had tacos on Tuesday carne asada. Excellent radiation taste. My wife had chicken burrito which was excellent she said. Minus the radiation flavor. Otherwise all in all pretty decent I would give it four stars but the microwave destroyed it. Do away with the microwave in this place would be definitely a 4 to 5 Star Place. What is a little strange to stick Styrofoam in there maybe to heat up for to go order? don't know don't care gross."}
{"text":"Went this morning for breakfast and it was excellent. I had the breakfast chorizo plate and husband had the huevos rancheros both were more than enough food and freshly made! I can't wait to go back and try the fry bread! :)"}
{"text":"This place has excellent food!  I have been at least four times and have tried something different every time. I have not been disappointed. The staff has always been friendly and helpful. My only complaint is the area for \"dine-in\" customers. The are is small and feels cramped. If they ever change locations to a larger storefront I'd be a regular!"}
{"text":"Dan got the carne asada tacos and I got the rolled tacos but I feel like there were better things on the menu. My tacos were alright. $5 for three. It was a light lunch.   Dan liked his tacos. He said 4.5/5 for the tacos. Atmosphere and service is average. Wasn't blown away with friendliness or helpfulness but it was good.  The chips and salsa bar was nice but I prefer thinner chips. That's just me being picky though.   It was just alright.  Wasn't in the mood for a burrito or chimichanga but maybe next time. They sound good.   Food 3/5 Price 3/5  Overall 3/5"}
{"text":"So, I gotta say this place is good.  I never write reviews but I eat here every week.  My whole family loves this place and wether we eat in or pick up its good.  Green chili is hot. Get in there and check it out."}
{"text":"Had tacos 1 chicken 1 machaca the chicken was all white meat it was good.  The machaca was fantastic.  Green chilies sauce was hot but super good and worth the heat.   Chips and salsa are good."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. As a New Mexican native I crave hatch green chili and this place offers just that. The breakfast burritos are very large and filling. The pork and green chili breakfast burrito is one of my favorites. It's a small restaurant with New Mexico decor and the staff are just wonderful. They definitely bring New Mexico hospitality to Arizona."}
{"text":"Simply put this place is amazing. I would recommend something specific but I like everything so far so I can't."}
{"text":"The very first time I ate here, it was delicious! But the second time I ate here, I got take away (just like the first time) and it was horrible... Total 180 from my first experience and the sad thing is that I wish I reviewed this place the first time because it was 4 stars but this last time was horrid! They messed up every order, gave dinky portions, and the flavor - non existent sadly.... No Bueno"}
{"text":"Honestly one of the best breakfast burritos I have ever had. I am never normally out this way but go out of my way specifically to come here now. Anyways, back to the food. I made my own breakfast burrito with Chorizo, Potatoes, Green Chile and Sour Cream. All ingredients taste incredible fresh and you can tell they pay attention to detail and make certain everything is the highest quality ingredients. I definitely tasted the difference. Their chunky salsa is good enough to drink. Also tried their tamales done Christmas style of course. And they stand the test against right up against my other favorite New Mexican in the Valley. (Blue Adobe and Los Dos Molinos) If you are in the area run don't walk and try this incredible little New Mexican joint for yourself. Friendly, informative service and also helpful with with suggestions. Go now!"}
{"text":"Best green chili fry bread!!! I have had several other things off the menu and have never been disappointed!"}
{"text":"Frybread and Hatch chiles, you can't go wrong with that combo! Get ready for some hearty New Mexico style eats at this restaurant.  The menu consists of Mexican food favorites, breakfast items, and frybread. I had the machaca frybread. It was made in record time, perfect for lunchtime eating. The frybread was puffy and slightly crisp around the edges with a heaping portion of oregano-infused, slow cooked shredded beef, cheese, tomatoes, lettuce, sour cream, and green onion. You have your choice of red or green sauce for your frybread as well. Since this is New Mexico style fare, I had to have it XMas style, with both green and red sauce :). It was such a big meal I could only finish about half of it and packed the rest to go. The only slight negative was that I wish the frybread were a little more crisp but that's me being really nitpicky about the meal.  Service was very friendly and they make you feel right at home here.  I'll be back to try more items from their menu next time I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Mmmmmmm green chili....enough said!  This place is a gem, good food, friendly staff, and good value!"}
{"text":"This place has absolutely the best re-fried beans in the valley. Its quite small inside but all the food I've had there is great and so is the service. The chips and salsa are good but not great that's the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars."}
{"text":"The green chili sauce is soooo good and the pricing is excellent! I just wish they were still open Sunday's."}
{"text":"I've been going to New Mexican Grill in Gilbert since they opened shop. For a few years now, the food has been flawless. The green chili, the burritos, etc were all the best i've ever had. 5-stars easy.  However, the past several times i've been since the beginning of the year, EVERYTHING has been extremely SALTY. The chili relleno, the carne... even the rice and beans all tasted like they had been cured in salt. I felt like a horse going to town on a salt lick. The first time, i chalked it up to a mistake... but now the 4th or 5th time in a row and i'm thinking the salt is here to stay.   I still gave 3 stars because, even with this food is quickly depleting the worlds salt supply, its still better than most places out there."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on Friday, so crowded! Had green chill star with fry bread, now it's one of my favor spicy stew."}
{"text":"Terrific, fresh and creative NEW Mexican dishes prepared expertly from a rather extensive menu.  The breakfast items are served til 10:30 and then the chips are put out for added pleasure with the 3 tasty salsas. I'm from Boston and never appreciated spicy dishes but LA raised Hubby does.  We both leave sated and smiling every time which is, lately, twice a week.  Now that the owner has added a wondrous green chile cheeseburger once a week we are guaranteed to be there on Tuesdays, rain or shine.  Friends, I dream about this burger! All aspects of this meal are delectable including the meat, the bun, the fries and the green chile sauce. The only reason I'm not giving New Mexican Grill the 5 stars it deserves for quality and taste is a bit of inconsistency.  Today's burger was delicious but with a different sauce and the fries were not as crisp and light as previous weeks.  It was still a wonderful meal as were all the others we've had in the last year: Savoy meat stuffed burritos and chimichangas, lighter taco salads, green chile pork stew, machaca beef nachos with green chile sauce.  All were worth writing home about!  Some of the very special places in our world can be hard to find and New Mexican Grill's lack of signage puts it in that category.  I happen to believe this adds to its cool factor.  You will not find this little treasure unless you know where to look!"}
{"text":"Food is great. That's it. They seem to do everything possible to alienate the customer and find a way to fail as a business. (See Chandler location) Cooks usually can't manage and no one here understands the first thing about running a business. Buy a sign! It's for those who don't know where you're located. Spend money to make money.  Cutting everything and cheaping out on products, menu availability, along with owners bad attitude about taking care of a customer will most certainly result in another failed location.  Find an investor, hire a manager, put up a sign and train the owners to care as much as some of the employees.  Might just make it!"}
{"text":"I am very confused how to review this place.   Atmosphere: Rivals McDonald's (1 Star)  Service: Not very good  Cost: In relation to the area, seems a little expensive for what you get  Time to get food: Sooo long!  Took about 30 minutes to basically get fast food.  Food: Pretty darn good (4 Star)  The chips and salsa were pretty terrible.  My mom had the taco salad, it looked very fresh & delicious, but they brought it out without all the components (forgot sour cream and guac)  My dad had the hatch chili & pork stew, pretty delicious, but a little spicy.  I had the 3 carne asada tacos, pretty delicious.  I also had the plain fry bread, a lot better than I have had in the past, but different.  It was not greasy, but it is a little thicker than I have had in the past.  Next time I will get the dessert version.    Will I come back? Very likely, but I will call in the order and do to go so I don't have to wait forever.    The food was the only bright spot (except for the chips and salsa)."}
{"text":"The chili verde is spectacular.  Not for the faint of heart. Very hot and spicy. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I've got to give this place a 5 star! We drove from Maricopa to go furniture shopping and decided to stop here for lunch. The restaurant was clean and decorated nicely, and the staff was very friendly. My boyfriend had the carne asada burrito and I had the shredded chicken chimichanga. While we waited we helped ourselves to their chips and salsas. Now, I am very picky with chips and salsa, I really like fresh authentic Mexican food and can't stand things like pace picante and tostitos, sorry but no. The New Mexican Grill has awesome chips and salsa!!! Even though I usually like thinner chips, I really enjoyed theirs. Our food came out piping hot and everything was flavorful and moist, nothing was dried out, including the rice. Both the green and red hatch chilies were very tasty; i preferred the red and my boyfriend liked the green better. Also their prices were pretty fair so that's always a plus. We had an excellent experience and will absolutely be going back!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast place..homemade tortillas are worth the trip! So are the delicious, authentic  refrained beans. Had delicious breakfast with bacon and  potatoes, tortillas and beans. (I don't eat eggs)"}
{"text":"I never review businesses or restaurants however after New Mexican Grill messing up every single order we have placed, having terrible service, the prices changing on every visit they finally made me mad enough that I will leave them a review. The straw that broke the camels back was the raw bacon in the breakfast burrito this morning. When you order and ask for extra crispy bacon, and receive raw bacon that is not a mistake or over sight, that is just not caring and thinking it is funny to mess with your customer base. I will not be returning. And will have nothing positive to say about them to anyone."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. People were very friendly and the relleno was hot, fresh, and delicious!! The only recommendation is to get the signage up so people can find you!!!"}
{"text":"I had the chili relleno and it was great. They were out of green sauce so I had to have the red. I don't usually care much for red but it was wonderful with the relleno. I will go back. Food was good and fresh."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how this place gets 4 and 5 stars. The staff (except for the rushed cashier) was very nice, but the food was very basic and nothing like the reviews. I ordered grilled chicken tacos, when I received them I confirmed two times that they were grilled since the chicken was shredded. The girl said they were grilled both times, but it was actually shredded. The chicken was dark, dry, and no flavor. The sides are very basic, however, the salsa was good and cheap prices (if you want so-so food)."}
{"text":"Everything in Reading is simply delicious. The three days I was attending a convention I never had an average meal.  Roasted marinated chicken is one of their more popular savory crepes. Now I know why :)"}
{"text":"Great little mom and pop Native American/Mexican-style joint in a strip mall. Tip 1: Be careful how you order, because the base price on let's say a $4 breakfast burrito can easily reach $8-10 when you add on potatoes, enchilada style, sour cream, extra meat, etc.Tip 2: Its hit and miss, but usually in the mornings, you cannot order chips and they do make some killer chips. 3: Try the fry bread, you won't be sorry! Tip 4: Closed on Sunday. Tip 5: The \"salsa\" is more of a hot sauce and both the green and red sauces are pretty hot, even for a guy who likes spicy."}
{"text":"The best I repeat best breakfast burrito I've ever had. I've tried other menu items but the breakfast burritos keep me coming back"}
{"text":"We paid $46 for breakfast for a family of 3 (2 adults and a child). Quite a few hidden costs. We asked for egg whites, which they had, but they charged extra because they said they use more eggs. When we got our meals, there were barely any eggs in it. The food is good, but the quality of the food and the restaurant's atmosphere is not worth $46."}
{"text":"Love this place. They make real New Mexican (S. New Mexico) food. Love getting the carna asada tacos. The hatch red is SO good.  let does get a little busy around lunch time but it is woth the 5 minute wait.  I haven't been here for breakfast but their nachos are so good. Big enoung for two. I get them and my 4 kids can't finish them."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast burrito. Best one I have had to date in the east valley.   Update. I've been here a couple more times and brought some friends along. They agree with me on the breakfast burrito. I haven't had anything else."}
{"text":"Yummers!!! My chicken burro was delicious! The chicken was very flavorful and tender.  I am very picky when it comes to red sauce, their sauce was smokey and good :)   I will definitely be going back. The staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"This review is for a call in breakfast burrito take out. Had to wait a few minutes on hold for someone to take my order. Order was kind of long and I had a couple special requests. Person on phone not only understood me but I could also understand them. (thank you) Was very accomadating and the order was correct when picked up. Order was ready when my wife arrived and the burritos were pretty darn good. First time here for all in our party and everyone was happy with the food. Ready to go back and try some more of this place."}
{"text":"I had the Machaca with red Chilli enchilada style. Best Mexican restaurant that's family owned. #supportlocal"}
{"text":"Great little place with awesome breakfast burritos!   The green chile sauce makes any burrito outstanding."}
{"text":"Awesome food with plenty of choices!  In and out with little wait. Especially loved d the old school country music in the background!"}
{"text":"Don't let the strip mall or \"ambiance\" fool you.  This is great FRESH Mexican food!  From the chips & salsa to the frybread, the fresh homemade tortillas & the hot sopapias...this is our new favorite Mexican place.  Give this place a shot!  It won't disappoint!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing! So far me and my fiancé have stopped by for breakfast, and lunch. The breakfast burritos are delicious, you could never go wrong with that! The chilli relleno plate was amazing as well.  Over all the food is great, and to top it off the staff is very welcoming. Very well ran and up kept restaurant. Would recommend anyone in the area to stop by and dig in!"}
{"text":"This place needs better signage.  The only reason I found out about it is because my neighbor told me about it and I'm in this little strip mall at least twice a week.  To think that I could have been eating here, but haven't because I didn't know about it, for the past year makes me a little sad.  The food so far has been very good.  No skimping on flavor going on. The green chili pork stew is wonderful.  The carne asada tacos pop with flavor.  The salsa bar is a great touch.  I can't wait to try the pozole this weekend."}
{"text":"This was fabulous!  Found it on Yelp when looking for Mexican food on my way home. Ordered take out of crispy tacos, cheese enchiladas and a relleno. Very friendly people and good prices. Got home to taste the incredible aromas we suffered through on our drive and all lived up to the anticipation. Everything delicious and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"the breakfast burrito is delicious and big!  It will not disappoint.  I love the local, personal feel of this little shop, but I really hope they are doing well.  The past several times I've been, they haven't had any permanent signage up, and I worry that people drive right by and don't even realize that there is a great little restaurant there!"}
{"text":"It is a great little hole in the wall on the Northeast corner of Lindsey and Pecos.  You probably wouldn't notice this place if you were driving by because it is set back off the road and it is quite small.  My wife and I like New Mexican style chile and there is a big difference between it and the Mexican (Sonoran) kind.  The green chile at this place is made with Hatch chile's.  The green chile isn't as spicy at this grill as it is in New Mexico but the flavor is undeniable.  My wife had the Chile relleno Christmas style this morning and I had the red chile pork  adovado with eggs.  My wife loved her relleno, even though it was only mildly spicy, and I thought the adovado was a decent substitute for real New Mexican food.  The adovado is in no way as good as Dick's Hideaway but if you don't want to drive 30 miles, it will do.  We have had other things on the menu including the Juevos Rancheros and we like it all.  I held off the fifth star in hopes that he will use Chimayan chile's for the red sauce and Hatch XX hot for the green.  Hey, a guy can dream!"}
{"text":"We love the food from here! But why I gave them only 3 stars is because they don't give the tips to the employees. But instead give them to charity. If this was the employees choice it would be one thing, but it's the owners. When I tip it's because I appreciate the service and think my server deserves it. I just think that's a bad owner for you and does not encourage servers to do their best."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite breakfast burrito place. Would make a long drive just to get these yummy burritos. They just changed to stop serving breakfast burritos & all breakfast at 10:30 am and are now closed on Sunday's & increased all their prices. People should at least know the new details before making the trek out here. Sad to see it go but I'll find another place. Maybe if they go back people will come back but these changes are not good."}
{"text":"It's pretty clean little place good tacos enchiladas and tostadas but not big on the chilie beef really lacked any flavor.  Like another yelper said, they need a big menu board.  If I was near by I may or may not stop by, I'd prefer Some Burros for this type of venue ."}
{"text":"Nom nom nom. Yummy food with free chips and salsa, great prices and free cinnamon chips. I say yes :)"}
{"text":"Just ok for me. Green Chili is ok, not great. The other mexican food plates are pretty basic. I feel like its missing a little bit of authenticity. Some of my other family members love it."}
{"text":"Great food.  Service is super fast. The food was made and at our telephone before we got back from getting salsa and chips."}
{"text":"The chicken taco combo is awesome! Spicy chicken soft tacos with cilantro and onion. Yummy spicy salsa. My new favorite local restaurant!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had breakfast here today. She had a breakfast burrito and I had a breakfast quesadilla. They were both awesome. We love New Mexico and New Mexican cuisine. This place is totally legit and it's right here in Gilbert. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I was a loyal patron of the Gilbert/Queen Creek location. New location is just as good with a little bit less seating. Food is so good here, you can tell they know what they are doing. Service is great. Frybread tacos are amazing as are the regular tacos. They will smother anything you want in red Hatch Chile sauce or green sauce. One of my favorite places for quick quality food."}
{"text":"Tried this for the first time today. Outstanding! Friendly staff and the food is delish.  Green chili on fry bread is excellent.  Kids had nachos and beef tacos and both loved them.  The jalapeno salsa is excellent as well."}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying that I was born in NM, so the standard to which I judge Mexican food has always been high.  Most so-called Mexican places in the Valley are very mediocre and over-priced for what you're getting.    A family friend (also from NM) recommended New Mexican Grill. Trusting their judgement, I had to see for myself what the fuss was about.   Walking in, my first impression was that the place in very simple. A big menu greets you just as you walk in the door.  An ordering counter and kitchen to the left, simple table set-ups to the right, and a self-serve chips and salsa bar in the middle. Looked like the crew that was working on Sunday was pretty young, so you never know  how that will go.   We placed our order and helped ourselves to chips and salsa. After a few bites I knew we were in for a good meal. The salsas had that distinctive fire-roasted taste that so few other places do. Big thumbs up. The service was prompt and the food arrived at our table in no time at all. Our group had a little bit of everything, with each item more delicious than the next. The ground beef enchiladas with red sauce and a fried egg were like something straight out of my grandmas kitchen. The green pork tamales were moist and full of flavor. The carne asada tacos were overflowing with tender steak nestled in warm tortillas.   It seriously took some will power to NOT go back and order another dinner.  If you are looking for an authentic New Mexican meal packed with mouth watering flavors at a very reasonable price, look no further than New Mexican Grill."}
{"text":"Very delicious food! Also received a free drink from the owner for being a loyal customer and wearing my scrubs! The owner is a little grouchy but mostly kind, the staff is great! Eat here!"}
{"text":"The owner and his staff are very welcoming and friendly. But...  I grew up in New Mexico and was so hoping a place claiming to be REAL New Mexican food would actually be awesome here in AZ.   We tried three different dishes and have to say, not really impressed. Just Okay, Still searching for that 'wow, I am home' place but sadly, this is just not it.  Onward!"}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place for quite some time now and glad I finally was able too! Very good flatbread tacos! I recommend for sure!"}
{"text":"The tamale was terrible. Sauce tasted canned and very small and not flavorful. Ground beef and potato taco was very plain. Hubby said his beans were very salty. Everything served on styrofoam and with plastic cutlery.  Nothing worth a second visit."}
{"text":"The good part about Phoenix is that all Mexican food tastes relatively great and I always love a free chip bar.  Food arrives relatively fast and though the food isn't great to look at, it is very satisfying. I had the chillie releno which was covered in green and red sauce. It took me a hard time to find the pepper. However, the crust was crunchy and the filling was gooey inside the pepper. It also came with rice and beans. They handed me a tortilla for the food but I thought it was unnecessary. I ended up taking it home and throwing it away."}
{"text":"Amazing little hole in the wall. Awesome salsa bar, great tacos and taquitos and I love the rice and beans!"}
{"text":"Loved the tacos! Chips and salsa a bit subpar. Tried their special pork burrito enchilada style but it wasn't quite good actually. Rice and beans really authentic. Will def go back for those carne asada tacos and beans and rice."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try based on Yelp. Nice little dine in restaurant with limited seating, friendly staff and a wide selection of menu items.   I decided to try their #4, green chili pork burrito plate. It didn't disappoint. Chips and salsa available for you to serve yourself.  Give this place a try and let me know what you think."}
{"text":"First time visit, played it safe with chicken burrito with red sauce, it came with beans and rice. Self serve chips and Salsa.  Overall not bad, more than enough food, served hot on paper plates.   Busy restaurant with limited indoor seating."}
{"text":"This is an awesome authentic Mexican style restaurant. It allows room for a sit down or you can take it to go. Open kitchen. Quick service. Driving by it, you would never think anything of it. Great prices, Definitely a must try!!!"}
{"text":"This is a nice little spot. Homemade New Mexican style food is done well. Red sauce, green sauce, meats are all good. My usual meal here the past 5 or 6 visits has been the two enchilada plate. I like the pork with green sauce and beef with red. The chips are good. 3 different salsas to choose from, all with different characters to enjoy.  I don't understand why people give a 1 star review because they don't serve breakfast past a certain time or they have plastic utensils. I know it's a bummer if you wanted chorizo or something, but the food here is good regardless of what time you come. Counter employee changes are fairly frequent but I've never had any issues. $7-9 for a big plate of flavorful homemade food is a good value to me.  My family enjoys it and we've brought other families here and they're now regulars too. It's also one of the only places around to get good fry bread if you're into it.  Los dos Molinos and Richardson's aren't in this immediate area but NMG holds it's own in an easy and casual, value-oriented way. Yummy!  Check it out if you haven't been here. Hopefully you'll enjoy it, too!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent New Mexican food. Chimichanga was a bit soggy and serving sizes could be larger.  Nothing extremely \"New Mexican\" about this place. The owner was pretty cool though. All in all this is just cafe style mexican food a tiny step above a place like Filibertos and a step below Arribas. You can take it from there.   If you want a real treat and a good dive, try Elmers tacos. Much better although it's in the geto."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. By far my favorite Mexican food place on this side of town. I always get a chimichanga, but have had their tacos, quesadillas, and burritos; all good. The staff is always friendly, and the food comes out quickly. The flavor in their food is sooooo good. I would highly recommend to eat here."}
{"text":"Fairly new to the Gilbert restaurant scene and it's only been open for a few months, but this place is pretty damn good. I've had a lot of New Mexican food...IN New Mexico and this place would fit right in.  If you're in the know, this place is similar to Weck's and even does the Christmas style. Portions don't seem large, but are deceiving. I can barely eat my entire meal and usually question if it's going to be enough food.  Service is friendly, but the place is pretty small. Definitely feels like a down home diner with great food. Give it a try! Prices are really good and food is way better."}
{"text":"I ordered the carne asada fry bread loaded with green chili. It was so fresh and the fry bread was perfectly cooked and crisp. I have to say that I was disappointed with the fat pieces that were in the carne asada. I hate when restaurants do not take the time to cut that out. Next time I will be getting pork green chili fry bread and a Navajo taco. It was so good and they were fast and friendly. I heard that the breakfast burritos are amazing. Oh and one more thing...they make their tortillas homemade too and they are so light and fresh.   I live in Central Phx but I will be making many trips to this place again!"}
{"text":"Okay,  obviously anyone who likes this place isn't a native Arizonan who knows what real Mexican food is!  First indication that it was not going to be great was the salsa tasted like it came from a jar.   We ordered a quesadilla which was pretty good,  however the \"guacamole\" was basically pureed avocados.   I ordered the pork green chili burrito with green chili sauce and cheese on top, which was actually pretty good and the pork was really tender.   The rest of the food lacked something to be desired.    We also discovered a hair in the chips, and then when my daughter got her food,  she found a hair in it as well!  When we told the waitress about the hair,  instead of refunding us for the meal,  she gave us $10 in a gift card, which is worthless since we won't be eating there again."}
{"text":"Good was great. Great Chips served warm with 3 salsas. My husband said its the best New Mexican food he's had this far in town. Service was on it too"}
{"text":"We were traveling from out of town, saw the reviews for this place and decided to try it out. I am so glad we did.  The atmosphere is nice. They have outdoor seating as well.  Service was fast.  I tried the #10 combination plate, Ground beef burrito smothered in red sauce on a plate with beans and rice.  They have self serve chips and salsa for dine in.   The chips were fresh and crisp. Salsas were good. The red one is omg hot hot hot. Good flavor, but it lingered on my tongue forever it seemed. The best part was the burrito. It was so gooooood!!!! I have never had a ground beef burrito that tasty. The beans and rice were bland but the burrito was oh so good. Definitely a repeat place."}
{"text":"The food is as flavorful as the other reviews suggest. I had the pork adovado burrito and it was amazing. My husband had green chili pork burrito and it was almost too spicy for him to eat. Even the salsa is special with green chillies in it  The bavarian cream churro was fresh and soft. I've never eaten a churro like that and was amazing!"}
{"text":"The food here is awesome. Ralph the owner does an amazing job with all of the food and there is a large variety. Love the atmosphere. I recommend all my friends here."}
{"text":"Very delicious New Mexico food in az. I have tried the chicken enchilada, chicken tacos and hubster had the green chile pork burrito smothered in hatch green chile sauce, topped with sour cream, onions, with a side of rice..which he enjoyed.  Everything is prepared to order...hot and fresh. normally we take it to go but they do have a quaint small dining area. Plenty of parking, small patio and they sell breakfast but I have not tried that. if your craving some good \"new\" mexican food with a flair..this is a solid place for it in east valley."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times since getting to the Chandler area. The fry breads are great. The beans and salsa are definitely worth having. Got there late on a Friday and had to get something unplanned due to them running out of fry bread. It's always busy but they get the food out in a timely matter. The only thing I didn't care for is that there are no napkins until you receive your food. Would be nice to have while you're eating the chips and salsa."}
{"text":"We ate here last Friday for company lunch, my first time. I couldn't believe the portion sizes and how inexpensive my Carne Asada Flatbread was. Very filing and very good."}
{"text":"Let me just say that I was VERY surprised how authentic and delicious this place. I'm from NM and can verify that this is true NM food. Love this place!"}
{"text":"The inside is small but the food is good. Green chili has a nice bite without being overly spicy. I have the green chili pork stew: the potatoes were fried as opposed to boiled but the overall completion of the dish was rich and deep. The fry bread is addicting."}
{"text":"Not fresh and bland.  Wish I hadn't wasted the visit...can't believe everything you read on Yelp."}
{"text":"We stumbled onto this place for lunch today thanks to Yelp.  I ordered the #4 chile verde  and my wife went with the #3 enchiladas.  Very good food, fresh homemade taste, and you get to support a local small business.  Can't beat it for a good lunch."}
{"text":"I kept it simple and had a crispy shredded beef taco with a side of sour cream.  Good customer service, nice plating of the single taco.  They added extra lettuce and tomato on the plate.  Quick and easy, close to my work.  I recommend!"}
{"text":"Amazing!  Great food in this place!!  Watch out for the green chile sauce... It is awesome but the heat sneaks up on you!!  Oh but it is so good!"}
{"text":"I wonder why I never discovered this place.... until now. This is good new mexican food. I had the breakfast bacon and eggs with potatoes....mmm yummy. The tortillas...yea now that is a tortilla! I cannot wait to try their breakfast burritos next time. Go try it....friendly service as well."}
{"text":"Really good green chile ! Small inside but has seating outside on the patio... Always busy! Plan to go there early before it's packed inside"}
{"text":"I am thankful for the other reviews that pointed me to this place. I love the breakfast burritos, just pay the small charge for the cheese, its worth it. I have also tried the tacos, ok, and the chimichanga, very good! The owner comes out to the tables most times we are there, seems like a very nice person."}
{"text":"Alert! The salsas are to die for! soooo gooood yum yum I wasn't that into the chili verde pork I ordered because the pork wasn't falling off like the way I like it. But man the salsas saved it. They provide salsas and chips at a small counter as self-service and there were 3 different kinds when I was there. Almost couldn't leave the counter :P"}
{"text":"I dropped my car off at Santan VW for maintenance and told my bf I was hungry. I was craving Mexican for breakfast and found this little spot nearby. I walked in and got a hello from a guy who was sitting down. The girl that was on the cash register didnt look or seem friendly. I didnt want to judge but she just looked annoyed. I asked if they served breakfast only. She answers no we serve everything in a monotone voice. I had the carne asada plate, bf had the breakfast quesadilla, and we had horchata for our drink. We waited 15 mins for food. The girl running the cash register served us our food when it was finally cooked. I noticed they had a lot of native american designs in their restaurant which I thought was cool. I asked oh are you guys native because I see the designs you have. She says what do you mean? I repeated myself and said umm I dont know... Then she walks away. Made me feel dumb for even trying to start a convo with her. Sorry for ruining your morning. Geez. The food was good. I liked the taste of my carne asada. Tortillas was fresh because it was made right then and there. Rice was a little too salty and mushy. My bf liked their quesadilla. The red sauce was the best! The spicyness was perfect. Not too spicy or too hot for those who cant handle spicy food. Green sauce was just okay. I preferred their red sauce. Will I come back? Probably not because of the rudeness of the girl who served us today. I come for awesome service not just how good the food is. And plus there are other mexican places I can go around Chandler and Gilbert area. I didnt even get a goodbye or thanks for coming guys. And they saw us walked out. Ehh first and last visit.. 3 stars overall for food and service was no bueno.."}
{"text":"Impressions from my first visit: Great food and prices. Very friendly staff. Casual, clean, inviting atmosphere. Family friendly.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"As a new Arizona resident and a Chef of 30 years from Seattle WA in search of new favorite places to dine. I often trust in the Yelp reviews. This place had good reviews so we tried it out. First off the layout of the place was not conducive to the customer. A lot of the customers seemed to be regulars and loved the place. We both had the shredded beef tacos which were mediocre at best but our rice was stone cold! It was alright but we won't be going back. May I suggest you all try Backyard Taco in Mesa."}
{"text":"I used to live in Albuquerque and I SO miss the food from New Mexico. This place is as close as you are going to get. The green chili burrito is outstanding. We actually ordered a large order for my birthday party and everyone loved it. I think we probably created quite a few fans that night."}
{"text":"The green chile stew was fantastic. The pork green chile burrito was just ok. Loved the fry bread!"}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican food. Reminds me of the places along the California coast!!!  Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"The food was good until I found two hairs  not a very clean place. They were very nice and friendly.. finding the hairs killed it for me"}
{"text":"Every time I go there I am never disappointed. The Fry Bread with green sauce is so delicious and the staff is extremely friendly. The portions are huge and well worth the money. I would definitely recommend this business to friends and family!"}
{"text":"Awsome breakfast burro's here, get them smothered in green chili and cheese, YUMMMIEEEEE!!!!  The green chili stew is the best also, I order mine with added carne asada, but just the way it comes is incredible taste.  Eat here on a regular basis now and have never had any complaints."}
{"text":"This is a hidden treasure - outstanding food, great value, terrific customer service. Don't let the paper plates give you heartburn - it's the wonderfully full stomach and smile on your face that counts! Everything involving Hatch chilies is recommended."}
{"text":"I have had the opportunity to eat here three times and have been quite pleased with the food and service.  I have had three different burritos  and was pleased with all of them but the green chili pork. I felt that while there was a massive amount of pork, it was on the dry side.   In the end if you are looking for quick NM food this is the place. Large quantities  of quality food for a fair price."}
{"text":"We go here every time we visit our daughter and Arizona our family is from New Mexico and we miss the food so happy to find good New Mexico style food especially the sopapillas looking forward to our next visit"}
{"text":"Ambience is good, free chips & salsa for dine in customers. We ordered chimichanga, nachos & burritos. All items was served in 10min. Food tastes good, but they don't have fajitas/ grill veggies which are my favorites.   I like to visit this place as it's close to my place. Otherwise if I want to eat excellent Mexican food. I prefer Carlos O Briens"}
{"text":"Update - I cannot get enough of this place. I love their green chile stew with frybread to dip in it. I love their chips and salsa (dine in for the green one!). Today I tried a frybread entree for lunch (I chose machaca and green sauce) and it was delicious.   This place is usually really busy, and for good reason. Their prices are a steal for what you are getting (flavor and portion wise)."}
{"text":"The burritos were authentic and great all around, the service was good and I'd highly suggest the green sauce!"}
{"text":"It was good food. Born in NM and lived there for 18 years- this was not quite \"New Mexican\" food. To be fair they probably do not have access to fresh red/green Chile. I am not sure they make their own tortillas.  Overall I would go back because it reminds me of home."}
{"text":"I don't  stray too far from my usual order. Carne asada and chicken tacos. But there is no need to stray when they are soooo good. Tuesday's they are less than 2 bucks each and it's always ready for me in 5 minutes or less."}
{"text":"Good \"fast casual\" place with a very large menu.  Fair prices, though they seem a little petty with all of the various signs posted regarding how many little plastic ramekins of salsa you can take, refills on soda, not to touch the silverware display, etc.  I concede the authenticity factor with having meat or stock, or lard in most everything (beans, rice, and even in the salsa) but a few additional vegetarian options would be most welcome on the menu."}
{"text":"I bought their Red Chili Sauce from their restaurant and it was awesome! I cooked about 3.5 lbs of sirloin meet (cubed) and added the whole jar is red chili and it soo good. I would recommend you give this a try. After feeding my friends I had enough left over to have with fried eggs the next morning!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I were craving some mexican, so we decided to try this place. We called about 25 minutes before their ridiculously early closing time of 8pm. The woman was incredibly rude, asked us how far we were (which makes sense it was the nasty tone she used), then told us twice to hurry and make sure we were there before closing. Despite telling her we were less than 5 minutes away. We get there about 15 til, food's not ready and there are 8 people inside still eating! Clearly they weren't getting out of there on time anyway.   Based on the reviews I expected really exceptional food, I can put up with rude staff for good food. Rude staff and mediocre food? Not so much. We ordered a burrito, some tacos, beans and guac. All of which were just bland, the flavor people speak of must come solely from their sauces. I feel meat should actually be seasoned and not wholly reliant upon red sauce. The chips that came with the meal super thick and overcooked. The portion sizes were also very small compared to most other \"mom and pop\" mexican joints. Usually for the same price we have enough leftovers for at least lunch.   I'm honestly disappointed, I was hoping to find a place that could replace the Villa's by our old house."}
{"text":"I think I will be back--for takeout. I was beginning to wonder if there was any decent mexican food or good hole-in-the-walls in my immediate area.  Very flavorful food better than what I have tasted around the Gilbert/S Chandler area. Even the rice and flour tortillas were tasty and usually I very 'meh' about rice or anything carby. The honey fry bread was nice though this is my first taste of the stuff. The only negative thing I can say is about the lack of seating area; its very galley style and narrow. The menu is posted on the front wall as you come in by the cashier. Taking one star off for lack of seating area but the food I think makes up for it. At the moment there is no signage out front so you will have to either use your GPS or pay attention to the building numbers but its out in front on the outer corner of the building on the right hand side."}
{"text":"This place is amazing food and the best New Mexican food you can find in the valley. I have had several menu items but my two favorites are carne asada burrito smothered in green chili sauce and the chili relleno with ground beef, smothered in green chili sauce.   New Mexican Grill also has great breakfast burritos and are always willing to take our very large work orders and always get our order right.   Super friendly staff and prompt with food!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable food. If you are in Gilbert, you have to check this place out. Authentic new mexican style food, great portions for a low price. I definitely recommend the carne asada burrito or Chile Relleno. It can get crowded for lunch, so get there early!"}
{"text":"Great little place in Gilbert. Had pasole, chorizo breakfast burrito, green chile burrito, and green chile stew. All pretty good! And the staff is really nice!"}
{"text":"I've given this place as many chances as they are going to get. The food is great especially the green chile. Food service is marginal and whether your food gets to you as you asked is a toss up. What has really turned me off is the service. I'm not sure but I believe I got attitude from who I think is the owner the last time I was in and we hadn't even ordered yet. When I turned around and led the family out he realized what he had done and shouted \"have a nice day\" sarcastically as we walked out the door. This is unfortunate because I will never go back even though the food is good.  Much better service at the little breakfast spot next door."}
{"text":"Yummmmmmmmmm. I am now fat and happy. The food is all homemade and delicious. The food is comparable to julios on val vista and baseline. The owner was there and was friendly/engaging. Def recommended!"}
{"text":"The best Hatch green chili in AZ! Super friendly staff. A little slow to get your food, but that's ok because the chips and salsa bar is flowing! Great for families!"}
